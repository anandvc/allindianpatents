				<td>PROCESS FOR PREPARATION OF A MULTILAYER COATING SHEET<br>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of a visual properties-<br>
matching multilayer coating sheet, to a process for partially finishing the surface of<br>
a substrate, and to a visual properties-matching multilayer coating sheet.<br>
Processes of the above-mentioned type are known from US 5254192. This<br>
document describes a process for repairing a damaged portion of paint or coating<br>
on a vehicle to achieve an exact colour match. The damaged paint of a vehicle is<br>
repaired by using an adhesive backed film that has a layer of paint identical with<br>
the paint on the vehicle. The paint has been applied to the film and to the vehicle at<br>
the same time and under the same conditions and has been dried and cured under<br>
the same conditions. So, an identical colour match is achieved between the<br>
painted vehicle and the repair film in the event the paint on the vehicle is scratched<br>
or otherwise damaged. The paint layer can be a monocoat or a colour coat/clear<br>
coat layer.<br>
A drawback of the known processes is that the repair film has to be produced in<br>
the vehicle factory together with the application of the original coating at a point in<br>
time when it is not known whether repair films will be required for the individual<br>
vehicle at all, let alone that the size and the shape of the required repair films are<br>
known. Furthermore, since the paint on the repair film is identical with the paint on<br>
the vehicle body applied in the factory and cured under the same conditions,<br>
limitations with respect to suitable base films apply. The factory applied paint of<br>
automobiles is typically cured at high temperature, for example at 140°C. Many<br>
polymeric materials which would be suitable as base films do not withstand the<br>
curing temperature of the factory applied automobile paint.<br>
The factory applied and cured paint gives rise to a hard coating layer. However, the<br>
flexibility and elasticity of such a paint layer generally is insufficient for repair films,<br><br>
given that repair films often have to be stretched and bent during application, for<br>
example when the coating on curved substrates, such as exterior mirror cases of<br>
automobiles, is refinished with the repair films. Application of the known repair film<br>
to curved substrates can give rise to mechanical failure, such as cracking, of the<br>
coating layer.<br>
The gloss of a factory applied coating of an automobile typically decreases with<br>
time due to the action of atmospheric and environmental etching. Also, the colour<br>
may undergo subtle changes over time. The known repair films produced together<br>
with the automobile are generally stored in the interior of the automobile or of a<br>
building where they are not exposed to atmospheric and environmental etching.<br>
Therefore, when the known repair film is used for repair of an automobile of which<br>
the gloss and colour values of the coating have changed under the influence of<br>
atmospheric and environmental etching, the repaired area will differ from the<br>
surrounding area in colour and gloss.<br>
The invention seeks to provide a process which alleviates the above-mentioned<br>
drawbacks. More in particular, the object of the invention is to provide a process<br>
which allows the preparation of an individualized visual properties-matching<br>
multilayer coating sheet suitable for repair purposes. This means that the multilayer<br>
coating sheet can be made to individually match the visual properties, such as<br>
colour, effect, texture, and gloss, of a surface to be matched. Additionally, it should<br>
be possible to prepare the multilayer coating sheet in the individually required size<br>
and shape. It should also be possible to use a wide variety of suitable polymeric<br>
base film materials and to tune the hardness, flexibility, and elasticity of the<br>
multilayer coating sheet to the required values, so that application of the repair<br>
sheet to bent and curved substrates is possible without mechanical failure of the<br>
coating layer.<br><br>
The invention now provides a process for the preparation of a visual properties-<br>
matching multilayer coating sheet comprising the steps of<br>
a)	determining the visual properties data of a surface to be matched in<br>
visual properties;<br>
b)	transmitting the data from step a) to a system configured to receive<br>
such data, and determination of the composition data of a coating<br>
composition having an acceptable match of visual properties;<br>
c)	preparing a visual properties-matching coating composition according<br>
to the determined composition data;<br>
d)	providing a base sheet layer optionally having an adhesive layer and<br>
a backing layer on one surface;<br>
e)	applying the visual properties-matching coating composition to one<br>
surface of the base sheet layer to form a colour- and/or effect-<br>
imparting coating layer;<br>
f)	optionally, drying the applied colour- and/or effect-imparting coating<br>
layer;<br>
g)	optionally, applying a clear coat layer on top of the colour- and/or<br>
effect-imparting coating layer;<br>
h) optionally, drying and/or curing the clear coat layer; and<br>
i)   if the base sheet layer in step d) was provided without an adhesive<br>
layer and a backing layer, application of an adhesive layer and a<br>
backing layer to the uncoated surface of the base sheet layer.<br>
With the process of the invention it is possible to prepare an individualized<br>
multilayer coating sheet which can be made to individually match the visual<br>
properties, such as colour, effect, texture and gloss, of a surface to be matched.<br>
The multilayer coating sheet can be prepared in the individually required size and<br>
shape. It is also possible to use a wide variety of suitable polymeric base film<br>
materials and to tune the hardness, flexibility, and elasticity of the multilayer<br><br>
coating sheet to the required values, so that application of the sheet to bent and<br>
curved substrates is possible without mechanical failure of the coating layer.<br>
The process of the invention can be used for preparing multilayer coating sheets<br>
for coated substrates. The multilayer coating sheets prepared according to the<br>
process are particularly suitable for repairing the exterior coated surfaces of<br>
automobiles and large transportation vehicles, such as trains, trucks, buses, and<br>
boats. However, the multilayer coating sheet can also be used with great<br>
advantage on small vehicles or on surfaces of buildings or other constructions, for<br>
examples bridges. The multilayer coating sheet can also be used for all non-repair<br>
purposes where a visual properties-matching surface finishing is required.<br>
The coated surfaces of automobiles and transportation vehicles often comprise a<br>
clear top coat on a colour- or effect-imparting base coat. The multilayer coating<br>
sheet is very suitable for matching the visual properties of such coated surfaces.<br>
However, the visual properties-matching multilayer coating sheet is equally suitable<br>
for repairing a substrate having a colour-imparting pigmented top coat. The<br>
multilayer coating sheets can be used to repair minor damage in the coating of a<br>
substrate, such as small scratches or dents. Alternatively, it is also possible to<br>
apply the multilayer coating sheet on a larger surface, such as an entire body panel<br>
of a motor vehicle, for example a door, a wing, or a hood.<br>
In step a) of the process the visual property data of a surface to be matched are<br>
determined. Examples of visual property data are colour data, gloss data, effect<br>
data, and texture data. Depending on the type of surface to be matched for visual<br>
properties, one or more of these data have to be determined. Besides colour, a<br>
paint film shows numerous further visual properties. Colour can be expressed by<br>
the paint film reflection as a function of wavelength of visible light. Alternatively,<br>
colour can be expressed in accordance with the so-called CIE Lab system, as<br>
defined by the Commission International d'Eclairage, or similar systems, such as<br>
the CIE Luv, CIE XYZ systems or the Munsell system. Particularly when effect<br><br>
pigments, such as for example aluminium flake pigments or pearlescent pigments,<br>
are used, the look of a paint film is not one of uniform colour, but shows texture.<br>
This can include phenomena such as coarseness, glints, micro-brilliance,<br>
cloudiness, mottle, speckle, sparkle or glitter. In the'following, texture is defined as<br>
the visible surface structure in the plane of the paint film depending on the size and<br>
organization of small constituent parts of a material. In this context, texture does<br>
not include roughness of the paint film but only the visual irregularities in the plane<br>
of the paint film. Structures smaller than the resolution of the human eye contribute<br>
to "colour", whereas larger structures generally also contribute to "texture".<br>
Texture data can for instance include the particle size distribution of the effect<br>
pigments in the toner and the optical contrast, defined as the difference in<br>
lightness, between the effect pigment and the other pigments present in the<br>
coating. Also particles which are not directly observable by themselves can<br>
contribute to the overall visual appearance of a paint film. Des-orienters are an<br>
example of such particles. Effect pigments are generally flakes tending to take a<br>
horizontal orientation in a cured film. To prevent this, and to obtain more variation<br>
in flake orientation, spherical particles are used, referred to as des-orienters. Using<br>
des-orienters in a metallic paint results in more glitter. The determination of texture<br>
data is described in more detail in International patent application WO 01/25737.<br>
The visual property data can be determined by known instrumental analysis. Using<br>
an angle-dependent spectrophotometer colour and colour effect data can be<br>
uniquely identified. The instrumental analysis quantifies colour and colour effect<br>
parameters, examples of which are lightness, hue, and chroma data, and their<br>
angle dependence.<br>
If the surface to be matched is the surface of a motor vehicle, an alternative way of<br>
determining visual property data is the retrieval of the so-called colour number,<br>
optionally refined by a colour variant code. The colour number is the code that<br>
represents the manufacturer's paint colour and colour effect, and can be found on<br>
the vehicle of interest. Paint colour and colour effect may vary within one colour<br><br>
number, for example due to minor variations between paint batches or application<br>
variables, such as relative humidity or temperature. Those variations can be taken<br>
into account using a variant database.<br>
Still another way of recording visual property data involves the retrieval of the<br>
Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), which can be found on every motor vehicle.<br>
The VIN is a structured combination of characters assigned to a vehicle by the<br>
manufacturer for identification purposes. The VIN consists of three parts, to wit the<br>
World Manufacturer Identifier (WMI), the Vehicle Description Section (VDS), and<br>
the Vehicle Indicator Section (VIS). The VIS, in conjunction with the VDS, ensures<br>
a unique identification of all vehicles produced by each manufacturer. Once colour<br>
code variants have been linked to the combination of VIS and VDS, the VIN can be<br>
used to determine the visual property data of a vehicle. The use of the VIN to<br>
determine the visual property data of vehicles is described in more detail in<br>
European patent application EP 1355242 A.<br>
It is also possible to use a combination of the above-mentioned methods for<br>
determination of the visual property data. Any other known method for<br>
determination of visual property data may also be used, for example visual<br>
comparison of the surface to be matched with colour swatches. The most<br>
appropriate and thus preferred method of determination may vary. For example, if<br>
the visual properties of an aged automobile are to be determined, an instrumental<br>
analysis of the visual properties may be preferred, because the visual properties<br>
may have changed too much over time to be adequately described by the colour<br>
code or the VIN.<br>
In addition to the visual properties of the surface to be matched, also the size and<br>
the shape of the required visual properties-matching multilayer coating sheet can<br>
be determined. If the multilayer coating sheet is used for repair purposes, the<br>
required size and shape may be equal to or slightly larger than the damaged<br>
surface to be repaired.<br><br>
Data such as the VIN and the colour code of a vehicle, as well as the size and the<br>
shape of the damage, can easily be retrieved and determined by a vehicle owner<br>
or fleet administrator. Thus, a visit to a vehicle body repair shop is not required for<br>
determining the visual properties data of a surface to be matched. If the visual<br>
properties data are determined by instrumental analysis, for example with a<br>
spectrophotometer, such a determination can be carried out quickly and without<br>
major out-of-service time of the vehicle in a vehicle body repair shop.<br>
The determined data are transmitted to a system configured to receive such data.<br>
Transmittal of the data can be via any means suitable for transmitting such data.<br>
Typically, the data are transmitted via a communication network suitable for data<br>
transmission. The data may be transmitted by voice, for example via a telephone<br>
line. The data may also be transmitted in the written form, for example via a letter<br>
or telefax. In a preferred embodiment, the data are transmitted electronically, for<br>
example via the Internet by e-mail or via an on-line Internet connection. The<br>
system configured to receive such data typically is a computer system under the<br>
control of a suitable software program. A suitable computer may be a general<br>
purpose computer having a central processing unit, a memory, means for loading<br>
an application program into a defined address space of the memory, and a<br>
computer monitor. Also connection means to a communication network for data<br>
transfer from and to remote locations, such as a modem for connection to the<br>
Internet, are useful.<br>
After transmission of the data, the composition data of a coating composition<br>
having an acceptable match of visual properties are determined. Coating<br>
composition data can be determined in a number of ways, i.e. by means of search<br>
procedures, calculations, or combinations of the two.<br>
For example, use may be made of a databank comprising composition formulae<br>
having visual property data linked thereto. Using the determined visual property<br><br>
data of the surface to be matched in visual properties, the most closely matching<br>
coating composition formula can be found.<br>
Alternatively, it is possible to use a databank having visual property formulae with<br>
spectral data linked thereto. Known calculation methods can be used to calculate<br>
the visual property data of the visual property formulae and compare them. Also, a<br>
databank can be used in which the absorption and reflection data, the so-called K<br>
and S data, of pigments are stored. Using K and S data in combination with<br>
pigment concentrations makes it possible to calculate the formula of which the<br>
visual property data most closely match the visual property data of the surface to<br>
be matched.<br>
It is possible to combine the aforesaid search and calculation methods.<br>
Once the coating composition data of a composition having an acceptable match of<br>
visual properties have been determined, a visual properties-matching coating<br>
composition is prepared by mixing the required components in the required ratio. In<br>
one embodiment, the coating composition data are displayed on a computer<br>
display or the data are printed out, and subsequently a coating composition is<br>
prepared according to the displayed or printed composition data. Alternatively, the<br>
computer can transfer the coating composition data directly to an automated<br>
mixing machine. The automated mixing machine may automatically prepare the<br>
visual properties-matching coating composition based on the composition data.<br>
When the size of the required visual properties-matching multilayer coating sheet<br>
has been determined and transmitted, it is possible to calculate the required<br>
amount of visual properties-matching coating composition on the basis of the<br>
surface to be coated. In this case, the visual properties-matching coating<br>
composition is suitably prepared in the required amount. Otherwise, it is possible to<br>
prepare a standard amount of the visual properties-matching coating composition.<br><br>
The visual properties-matching coating composition typically is a liquid coating<br>
composition which can be applied by spraying. Depending on the envisaged<br>
purpose of the visual properties-matching multilayer coating sheet, the visual<br>
properties-matching coating composition may also be a highly viscous liquid<br>
composition or a powder coating composition. The visual properties-matching<br>
coating composition may be water borne or solvent borne. It may suitably be<br>
prepared by mixing one or more colour- and/or effect-imparting modules, one or<br>
more binder modules, and a diluent module. Also a crosslinker may be added to<br>
the visual properties-matching coating composition.<br>
If the colour- and/or effect-imparting coating layer formed from the visual<br>
properties-matching coating composition is not covered by a clear coat layer, it is<br>
preferred that the colour- and/or effect-imparting coating layer is crosslinkable.<br>
Crosslinkable coating layers can be obtained from two-component coating<br>
compositions based on hydroxy-functional binders and isocyanate-functional<br>
crosslinkers. Such compositions are well-known in the art and they are available as<br>
solvent borne compositions and as water borne compositions. Crosslinking may<br>
occur at ambient temperature or at elevated temperature.<br>
It is also possible to use coating compositions which are curable by actinic<br>
radiation. In a still further embodiment, so-called dual cure compositions may be<br>
used, which are curable thermally and by actinic radiation. Such dual cure<br>
compositions may for example comprise binders having hydroxyl groups and<br>
(meth)acryloyl groups, and an isocyanate-functional crosslinker optionally having<br>
(meth)acryloyl groups.<br>
After preparation of the visual properties-matching coating composition, the<br>
composition may be applied to the base sheet layer, as described further below.<br>
However, it is also possible to first apply the coating composition to a test panel<br>
and to determine if the visual properties of the applied coating have a sufficient<br>
match with the visual properties of the surface to be matched. Such a<br>
determination can be carried out by instrumental analysis, as described above. If<br><br>
the difference in visual properties is below a predetermined value, the coating<br>
composition can be applied to the base sheet layer. Otherwise, a new improved<br>
visual properties-matching coating composition may be prepared for use in the<br>
subsequent process steps. The above steps may be automated, carried out for<br>
example by a robot under the control of a suitably programmed computer.<br>
The base sheet for the base sheet layer may be made of various materials. The<br>
base sheet may consist of an aluminium foil or an aluminized layer, for instance an<br>
aluminized polyester film, plastic or paper. The base sheet can be rigid or flexible.<br>
The base sheet has to be sufficiently flexible to follow the substrate's contours<br>
upon application. Therefore, the base sheet used in the process preferably is<br>
flexible and elastic. However, for spot repairs the spot frequently is sufficiently<br>
small to be treated as if it were a plane, which means that base sheet flexibility and<br>
elasticity are of minor relevance. When the fade-out technique as described further<br>
below is applied, the base sheet used suitably is transparent and colourless. In<br>
other embodiments coloured and/or non-transparent base sheets may be used.<br>
Coloured and/or non-transparent base sheets may be easier to handle and<br>
contribute to the hiding power of the multilayer coating sheet.<br>
It will be readily understood that upon contact with the applied visual properties-<br>
matching coating composition the base sheet layer should not be dissolved or<br>
excessively swollen by the coating composition or components thereof. Swelling of<br>
the base sheet is also undesirable, because it can compromise the dimensional<br>
stability thereof.<br>
The base sheet layer typically comprises a polymeric material, for example<br>
polyvinyl chloride, acetate, polyethylene, polyester, polyurethane, polyamide, an<br>
acrylic polymer, polyethylene naphthalate, polyethylene terephthalate or<br>
polycarbonate. Examples of other suitable materials are polyvinylalcohol, natural or<br>
modified starch, polyalkylene oxide, e.g. polyethylene oxide or polymers modified<br>
therewith, polymers and copolymers of (meth)acrylic amide or meth(acrylic) acid.<br><br>
Also mixtures, hybrids, and blends of these materials can be used. The base sheet<br>
may consist of a single layer. Alternatively, the base sheet may be multilayered in<br>
itself. The base sheet may for example include a barrier or sealant layer that<br>
prevents any potentially damaging solvent of the coating composition to be applied<br>
on one surface of the base sheet from reaching the adhesive layer on the other<br>
surface of the base sheet. The base sheet may also comprise a surface layer<br>
which has been particularly adapted to be coated with a coating composition.<br>
The base sheet layer suitably has a thickness of at least 10 m, preferably at least<br>
20 |jm, and most preferably of at least 30 m. Generally, the thickness of the base<br>
sheet layer is below 150 urn, preferably below 120 urn, and most preferably below<br>
100 urn.<br>
As mentioned above, the multilayer coating sheet may have to be bent and/or<br>
stretched during application to a substrate. Therefore, the base sheet layer is<br>
preferably made of elastic and flexible material. The elongation at break of the<br>
material preferably is at least 100%, more preferably at least 150%, and most<br>
preferably at least 250%. Many of the polymeric materials mentioned above exhibit<br>
these properties.<br>
The base sheet may be provided in the form of a roll. The roll may be inserted into<br>
a device that enables unrolling and die cutting activities, so as to provide a base<br>
sheet of the desired size and shape. In one embodiment, the unrolling, die cutting<br>
device is automated, and can be operated from a computer platform that enables<br>
digital design. A digital design, characterizing the required size and shape of the<br>
base sheet, is suitably based on the determined size and shape data transmitted in<br>
step b). The die cutting activities may alternatively be executed after application of<br>
the visual properties-matching coating composition. It is also possible for die<br>
cutting activities to be executed at both stages of the process.<br>
If for example a visual properties-matching multilayer coating sheet for a bonnet of<br>
a motor vehicle is required, the software platform may suggest the best fitting form,<br>
either through calculation, using a vehicle part dimensions database, or using<br><br>
three-dimensional imaging software in combination with for example digital<br>
photography. The unrolling device then unrolls and die cuts at a desired length.<br>
The width of the resultant rectangular or square piece of base sheet resembles the<br>
roll width. The base sheet is fed into a base sheet coating area, where the base<br>
sheet is coated either completely or partly according to the desired end size and<br>
shape. The latter example might include fade-out areas, preferably situated at the<br>
outer border of the design. From there, the rectangular or square base sheet - with<br>
the desired coated and optionally faded-out areas design - is fed into a die cutting<br>
area, where the final coated sheet is die cut to the desired end form. This end form<br>
may include larger parts of uncoated base sheet.<br>
In another embodiment, the base sheet is provided in the form of a stack of sheets,<br>
in variable forms with variable surface areas. The forms might for example be<br>
rectangular, oval or round. The surface area generally ranges from 1 mm2 to 10<br>
m2, and preferably from 0.5 cm2 to 5 m2.<br>
The base sheet layer optionally is provided with an adhesive layer and a backing<br>
layer on one surface. The adhesive layer serves to adhesively bond the visual<br>
properties-matching multilayer coating sheet to a substrate. In one embodiment,<br>
the adhesive is a pressure-sensitive adhesive. Alternatively, the adhesive may be<br>
activatable thermally or by actinic radiation. The adhesive layer may comprise<br>
further functional additives in order to include additional desirable properties in the<br>
adhesive layer. For example, the adhesive layer may comprise anti-corrosive<br>
ingredients, such as anti-corrosive pigments, providing the visual properties-<br>
matching multilayer coating sheet with anti-corrosive properties.<br>
It is preferred that the adhesive used increases in adhesive force over time after<br>
adhesively binding the visual properties-matching multilayer coating sheet to a<br>
substrate. If the adhesive initially has a low tack, re-positioning of the visual<br>
properties-matching multilayer coating sheet immediately during application is<br>
possible, thus facilitating the application achieving exact positioning and an<br>
invisible repair.<br><br>
The adhesive layer can be applied to the base sheet by any known application<br>
technique suitable for this purpose. Examples include application by a knife, roll<br>
coating, and transfer coating operations. The adhesive layer may be transparent.<br>
The thickness of the adhesive layer suitably is at least 2 m, preferably at least 5<br>
urn. Generally, the thickness of the adhesive layer is below 50 urn, preferably<br>
below 35 urn.<br>
A backing layer is applied over the adhesive layer. The materials of backing layers<br>
normally used for this purpose include paper, e.g. crepe, flatback, tissue, and<br>
polymer films, e.g. polyester, polyvinyl chloride, polypropylene, polyethylene,<br>
fluoropolymers, cellulose acetate, and polyurethane. The backing layer may<br>
suitably be coated with a release agent to provide easy removal of the backing<br>
layer upon application of the visual properties-matching multilayer coating sheet.<br>
The release agents are typically based on binders containing silicone, a substance<br>
pressure-sensitive adhesives do not readily bond with. Acrylic emulsion release<br>
agents are an example of non-silicone-based release agents.<br>
It is preferred to have air egress channels in the adhesive layer. Such air egress<br>
channels facilitate the application of the multilayer coating sheet to a substrate.<br>
Due to easier removal of air bubbles, a smooth coverage and fewer wrinkles can<br>
be achieved. Air egress channels can be created by an embossed surface of the<br>
backing layer facing the adhesive layer. Other methods of creating air egress<br>
channels are equally suitable, for example by the presence of microscopic glass<br>
spheres in or on the adhesive layer. A layer of microscopic glass spheres shields<br>
the adhesive, allowing the multilayer coating sheet to be repositioned during<br>
application. When pressure is applied, the glass spheres are crushed into the<br>
adhesive, giving rise to air egress channels and instant high bond strength.<br>
Suitable base sheet layers provided with an adhesive layer and a backing layer are<br>
available commercially, for example from Avery Dennison under the trade<br>
designation Avery 6904 Easy Apply.<br><br>
When the base sheet layer is provided without an adhesive layer and a backing<br>
layer, these layers can be applied in a later step of the process.<br>
The visual properties-matching coating composition is applied to one surface of the<br>
base sheet layer. In one embodiment, the coating composition is a base coat<br>
composition such as is typically used in base coat/clear coat systems on motor<br>
vehicles. Such a base coat composition is a liquid coating composition comprising<br>
pigments and/or effect-imparting particles, such as mica particles or metal flakes.<br>
Application thereof is preferably carried out by spraying. However, other application<br>
methods are also possible, provided that the effect-imparting particles are oriented<br>
in such a way that a colour effect can be matched independent of the viewing<br>
angle. Suitable base coat compositions are available commercially, for example<br>
from Akzo Nobel Car Refinishes under the trade designations Autowave and<br>
Autobase Plus. If the visual properties-matching coating composition does not<br>
comprise effect-imparting particles requiring a specific orientation in the coating<br>
layer, the above restrictions on application methods do not apply and all known<br>
application methods can be used, such as rolling, curtain coating, brushing, hot-<br>
melt application, air brushing, or ink-jet printing.<br>
It may be that a visual properties-matching coating composition having an<br>
acceptable match of visible properties cannot be found in the data file containing<br>
coating composition data. In this case it may nevertheless be possible to prepare a<br>
visual properties-matching multilayer coating sheet according to the process of the<br>
invention. A coating composition having the best possible match of visible<br>
properties is selected and applied to the base sheet layer as described above. The<br>
base sheet layer should be transparent. The colour- and/or effect-imparting coating<br>
layer is applied to the base sheet layer so as to achieve a hiding power gradient<br>
within the coated area, with full hiding power being achieved in the centre of the<br>
area of the applied coating layer and the hiding power decreasing towards at least<br>
one border of the area of the applied coating layer. This can for example be<br><br>
achieved by gradually decreasing the applied layer thickness of the coating<br>
towards the at least one border of the area of the applied coating layer. This<br>
technique is commonly known in the refinish sector as fade-out. When the slope of<br>
the colour and effect difference over a certain distance does not exceed a certain<br>
threshold value, the resulting colour and effect difference is practically invisible to<br>
the human eye.<br>
The invention also relates to a multilayer coating sheet wherein the fade-out<br>
technique has been applied. Such a visual properties-matching multilayer coating<br>
sheet comprises, in the following order,<br>
a)	a backing layer,<br>
b)	an adhesive layer,<br>
c)	a transparent base sheet layer,<br>
d)	a colour- and/or effect-imparting coating layer, and<br>
e)	optionally, a clear coat layer,<br>
wherein the hiding power of the colour- and/or effect-imparting coating layer<br>
decreases towards at least one border of the coating layer.<br>
Such a multilayer coating sheet is particularly suitable for repair of minor damage<br>
to the exterior coating of an automobile.<br>
The multilayer coating sheet suitably has a thickness of at least 40 m, preferably<br>
at least 50 m, and more preferably at least 60 urn. The thickness generally is<br>
below 500 m, preferably below 300 urn, and more preferably below 200 m. In<br>
view of the required elasticity upon application of the multilayer coating sheet to a<br>
substrate, the elongation at break of the multilayer coating sheet suitably is<br>
essentially the same as described above for the base sheet layer. In order to<br>
achieve the required elongation at break values, the crosslink density of the<br>
coating layer(s) of the multilayer coating sheet before application to a substrate<br>
preferably is sufficiently low. When elasticity and elongation upon application are<br>
not critical, for example in the case of application of the multilayer coating sheet to<br><br>
a non-curved plane substrate, the crosslink density of the coating layer(s) may be<br>
higher, for example about 50 kPa/K.<br>
After application of the visual properties-matching coating composition, the applied<br>
colour- and/or effect-imparting coating layer may be subjected to a drying phase.<br>
Drying includes physical drying by evaporation of solvent and/or water and curing<br>
by chemical crosslinking reactions. If required, drying can be accelerated by<br>
heating, irradiation with (near) infrared radiation, or air blowing. When the coating<br>
is susceptible to actinic radiation-induced curing, the applied coating may be<br>
irradiated with actinic radiation, such as ultraviolet light or electron beam radiation.<br>
When the coating is prepared from a dual cure coating composition, it may be<br>
preferred to carry out thermal curing after application of the coating composition<br>
and to suspend curing by actinic radiation until after the visual properties-matching<br>
multilayer coating sheet has been adhesively bonded to a substrate. Such a<br>
stepwise curing of the composition has the advantage that the visual properties-<br>
matching multilayer coating sheet remains sufficiently flexible and elastic to allow<br>
stretching and bending during application to a curved substrate without mechanical<br>
failure such as cracking of the coating layer. A post-application-to-a-substrate cure<br>
step by actinic radiation may provide the coating layer with the required hardness<br>
and resistance properties. The thickness of the colour- and/or effect-imparting<br>
coating layer suitably is in the range of 5 to 30 m. In fade-out areas as described<br>
above, the thickness may be below the indicated range.<br>
After application of the visual properties-matching coating composition to the base<br>
sheet layer, an optional spectrophotometric control system measurement of the<br>
colour and/or effect data of the applied coating layer may be executed in order to<br>
check if the visual properties have an acceptable match with the visual property<br>
data determined in step a). If the visual property data of the applied coating layer<br>
differ by more than a predetermined threshold value, it may be required to select a<br>
better matching  coating  composition  or to apply the fade-out technique as<br><br>
described above. The optional control step may alternatively or additionally also be<br>
carried out after application of the optional clear coat layer, as described further<br>
below.<br>
When the determination of the visual property data in step a) of the process<br>
indicates that a clear coat layer is required to match the visual properties, a clear<br>
coat layer is applied on top of the colour- and/or effect-imparting coating layer. The<br>
clear coat layer may be applied on top of the dried colour- and/or effect-imparting<br>
coating layer. Alternatively, the clear coat may be applied wet-on-wet on top of the<br>
colour- and/or effect-imparting coating layer. Wet-on-wet application means that<br>
the underlying colour- and/or effect-imparting coating layer is not fully dried or<br>
cured before application of the clear coat. It is also possible for the colour- and/or<br>
effect-imparting coating layer to be partially dried, for example by subjecting it to a<br>
so-called flash-off phase of 5 to 15 minutes, during which a substantial part of the<br>
liquid diluent can evaporate.<br>
Application of the clear coat may be done by spraying. However, other means of<br>
application, such as mentioned above for the visual properties-matching coating<br>
composition, may be employed as well. The choice of the appropriate application<br>
method may depend on the visual properties, such as gloss, to be matched. The<br>
application method giving the best match of visual properties is generally preferred.<br>
The clear coat layer is preferably crosslinkable, as described above in respect of<br>
the visual properties-matching coating composition. Suitable clear coat<br>
compositions are available commercially, for example from Akzo Nobel Car<br>
Refinishes under the trade designation Autoclear. So far, good results, in particular<br>
with respect to weather resistance of the applied multilayer coating sheet, have<br>
been obtained when the clear coat comprises a mixture of a polyester polyol, a<br>
polyurethane polyol, an organic solvent, and a flexible isocyanate-functional<br>
crosslinker. In one embodiment, the isocyanate-functional prepolymer Xthane IW-<br>
P26, commercially available from ITWC, Inc., Malcom, Iowa, United States of<br>
America, has been used as crosslinker. The molar ratio of isocyanate-groups and<br><br>
hydroxyl groups in the clear coat suitably is in the range of 1.5 to 0.8, for example<br>
1.2. Generally, the clear coat additionally comprises other components and<br>
additives which are usually present in automotive refinish top coats, such as<br>
crosslinking catalyst, wetting agents, and light stabilizers.<br>
After application, the clear coat may be subjected to a drying and/or curing step, as<br>
described above in respect of the visual properties-matching coating composition.<br>
The clear coat layer suitably has a layer thickness in the range of 20 to 80 urn.<br>
In another embodiment, the clear coat is a flexible, solid polyurethane film having a<br>
very low crosslink density. The clear coat layer contains unreacted polymerizable<br>
olefinically unsaturated groups, such as (meth)acryloyl groups, with at least a part<br>
of the unreacted polymerizable olefinically unsaturated groups being maleimide<br>
groups.<br>
Such a clear coat layer can be prepared by mixing and reacting hydroxyl- and<br>
isocyanate-functional prepolymers. Either or both of the prepolymers additionally<br>
comprise the polymerizable olefinically unsaturated groups. As an example of a<br>
hydroxyl-functional prepolymer comprising polymerizable olefinically unsaturated<br>
groups the addition product of (meth)acrylic acid and butanediol diglycidylether<br>
may be mentioned. An example of an isocyanate-functional prepolymer comprising<br>
polymerizable olefinically unsaturated groups is the addition product of 1 mole of a<br>
diisocyanate trimer and 1 mole of a hydroxyl-functional maleimide.<br>
The glass transition temperature (Tg) of the clear coat layer before irradiation with<br>
actinic radiation is in the range of -40 to 40°C, preferably between 0 and 20°C.<br>
Such a clear coat also has a very high flexibility. The elongation at break at room<br>
temperature preferably is in the range of about 300% to about 500%.<br>
After application of the multilayer coating sheet to a substrate, post-curing of the<br>
clear coat by polymerization of the olefinically unsaturated groups can be initiated<br>
by irradiation with UV light or visible light. UV-A light or visible light is preferred.<br>
Upon post-curing the Tg of the clear coat increases by about 20 to 50°C. The final<br>
Tg of the post-cured clear coat preferably is in the range of 40 to 65oC, which is<br><br>
similar to the Tg of commercial clear coats. Such multilayer coating sheets which<br>
were post-cured after application exhibit a favourable weather resistance.<br>
The presence of maleimide groups has the advantage of a higher Tg increase<br>
upon curing as compared to a clear coat having acryloyl groups only, based on a<br>
comparable concentration of polymerizable olefinically unsaturated groups.  In<br>
addition, maleimide groups reduce oxygen inhibition during radiation curing.<br>
If the base sheet layer was originally provided without an adhesive layer and a<br>
backing, an adhesive layer and a backing layer can be applied to the uncoated<br>
surface of the backing layer after application of the coating layers.<br>
As mentioned above, the visual properties-matching multilayer coating sheet<br>
obtainable by the process of the invention is very suitable for partial finishing of a<br>
substrate. Partial finishing of substrates includes the repair of small scratches or<br>
dents in a larger surface of a substrate, for example a scratch in the door of an<br>
automobile. Partial finishing also includes the application of a visual properties-<br>
matching multilayer coating sheet to an entire body part of a motor vehicle. Also,<br>
the application of graphics and lettering in predetermined colours and effects on<br>
large transportation vehicles, such as trains, buses, trucks, and airplanes is<br>
included.<br>
Accordingly, the invention also relates to a second process for partial finishing of a<br>
substrate. This second process comprises the preparation of a visual properties-<br>
matching multilayer coating sheet as described above and, additionally, in any<br>
workable order, the steps of<br>
j)        removing  the  backing  layer from  the visual  properties-matching<br>
multilayer coating sheet;<br>
k) applying the visual properties-matching multilayer coating sheet to<br>
the surface of the substrate to be finished, with the adhesive layer<br>
facing the substrate surface to be finished and forming an adhesive<br><br>
bond between the visual properties-matching multilayer coating sheet<br>
and the substrate surface; and<br>
I)        optionally curing the coating layer(s) of the visual properties-matching<br>
multilayer coating sheet applied in steps e) and g).<br>
The process is also very suitable for refinishing a damaged substrate. Depending<br>
on the condition of the substrate to be partially finished, it may be appropriate to<br>
carry out one or more additional preceding steps in order to prepare the substrate<br>
for the application of the visual properties-matching multilayer coating sheet.<br>
Examples of such additional preparation steps are cleaning of the substrate,<br>
including degreasing and removal of existing coating layers, filling of dents with a<br>
suitable filler, such as a putty, application of a primer layer to the substrate, and<br>
sanding of the substrate. Also removal of dust by pressurized air or with a dust<br>
cloth may be beneficial.<br>
The process of partially finishing the surface of a substrate includes the step of<br>
removing the backing layer from the visual properties-matching multilayer coating<br>
sheet, thus exposing the adhesive layer of the visual properties-matching<br>
multilayer coating sheet. In one embodiment, the backing layer is removed<br>
completely in a single step. Alternatively, it is also possible to remove the backing<br>
layer partly and to start with the application of the multilayer coating sheet to a<br>
substrate. Removal of the backing sheet and application may then be continued<br>
successively until the whole multilayer coating sheet has been applied to the<br>
substrate. This stepwise procedure may be preferred for relatively large surfaces to<br>
be finished with a single multilayer coating sheet, because the stepwise procedure<br>
may enhance applicability and lead to a better quality of the end result. The<br>
backing layer can normally be removed manually.<br>
When the adhesive layer of the visual properties-matching multilayer coating sheet<br>
comprises a pressure-sensitive adhesive, no further preparation steps of the<br>
adhesive layer are generally required prior to the application of the coating sheet to<br><br>
the substrate. If other types of adhesives are used, an activation step to activate<br>
the adhesive may be required. Depending on the type of adhesive and the method<br>
of activation, the activation step may be carried out prior to, during and/or after<br>
application. Examples of activation steps are treatment of the adhesive surface<br>
with water or an appropriate organic solvent. In the case of heat-sensitive<br>
adhesives, heat treatment may be required.<br>
The visual properties-matching multilayer coating sheet is subsequently applied to<br>
the surface of the substrate to be finished, with the adhesive layer facing the<br>
substrate surface to be finished and forming an adhesive bond between the visual<br>
properties-matching multilayer coating sheet and the substrate surface. As<br>
mentioned above, the substrate surface may be a two-dimensional object or a<br>
three-dimensional object having a curved surface. Since the visual properties-<br>
matching multilayer coating sheet is essentially flat, it has to be made to conform to<br>
the substrate during application in the case of three-dimensionally shaped<br>
substrates. If the adhesive layer comprises a pressure-sensitive adhesive,<br>
pressure is applied to the multilayer coating sheet after it has been made to<br>
conform and positioned on the substrate in order to form an adhesive bond<br>
between the multilayer coating sheet and the substrate. Application of the visual<br>
properties-matching multilayer coating sheet to a substrate may be carried out<br>
manually, optionally using suitable tools, such as a squeegee, a felt-covered<br>
squeegee, or gloves. Gloves prevent contamination and can lower the friction while<br>
moving the hand or a squeegee across the surface of the visual properties-<br>
matching multilayer coating sheet and simultaneously applying pressure. Also<br>
other tools, such as a razor knife, a heat source for heating the multilayer coating<br>
sheet, or a rivet brush, may be used. The application of larger visual properties-<br>
matching multilayer coating sheets, for example on trucks or buses, may be aided<br>
by a mechanical sheet guidance system, enabling the application of longer<br>
stretches of sheet in a single operation. It is also possible to apply the multilayer<br>
coating sheet to a substrate by the so-called wet application method. By wetting<br><br>
the surface of the substrate with an application fluid, the film can be positioned on<br>
the substrate without firmly adhering to it. In one embodiment, the application fluid<br>
can be an aqueous detergent solution, for example 1 weight-% of detergent in<br>
water. Alternatively, the application fluid can be an organic solvent or be based on<br>
an organic solvent, such as ethanol or isopropyl alcohol. One advantage of using<br>
organic solvent based application fluids is the combination of slideability and initial<br>
tack. The latter enables the polymer sheet to be fixed when desired, while<br>
maintaining its easy repositionability. The initial tack is based upon the solvent<br>
activation of the adhesive on the back of the foil.<br>
The application fluid may also be a mixture of water and organic solvents.<br>
The detergent liquid provides slideability and positionability to the pressure-<br>
sensitive coating sheet until the water film has been removed. A plastic squeegee<br>
can be used for the removal of the water layer, preferably by squeegeeing from the<br>
centre towards the edges of the multilayer coating sheet and gradually increasing<br>
the applied force until apparently most or all of the water has been removed.<br>
If, for example, a visual properties-matching multilayer coating sheet is to be<br>
applied to the bonnet of an automobile, the backing sheet can be removed and the<br>
sheet applied at once by two individuals, one on either side, holding the film. After<br>
the sheet has been applied to the bonnet, repositioning, air regress and<br>
pressurized adhesion can be executed by one person. The sheet is made to<br>
conform and adhere to the front of the bonnet, without air bubbles or any other<br>
surface defects being visible. On all sides of the bonnet, a certain surplus of sheet<br>
remains as a free form. This surplus is folded to the sides and the backside of the<br>
bonnet, and adhered as smoothly as possible.<br>
If the coating layer(s) of the multilayer coating sheet have not been fully cured<br>
before application of the sheet to a substrate, an additional post-application cure<br>
step can be carried out after application of the sheet to a substrate. The post-<br>
application cure may be thermally initiated, for example by heating with a hot air<br><br>
blower or by irradiation with (near) infrared radiation. Alternatively, the post-<br>
application cure may be initiated by actinic radiation, such as ultraviolet radiation.<br>
Subsequent to the application of the visual properties-matching multilayer coating<br>
sheet to the surface of a substrate, and after the optional post-application curing<br>
step of the coating layers, matching of the visual properties of the multilayer<br>
coating sheet and the surrounding surface may optionally be further improved by<br>
one or more after-treatment steps. Examples of such after-treatment steps are<br>
polishing of the surface of the multilayer coating sheet and the surrounding<br>
surface, and heat treatment of the multilayer coating sheet. Warming of the<br>
multilayer coating sheet by heat treatment can cause the settlement of minor<br>
irregularities in one or more of the layers of the multilayer coating sheet, such as in<br>
the adhesive layer or in the coating layers.<br>
The processes according to the invention have the additional advantage that<br>
damage to a coating layer, such as a dent, a scratch, or a bare area, can be<br>
repaired in less processing time and without damaging the area around the<br>
damaged area. Since spraying of coating compositions is not carried out on the<br>
substrate, such as a motor vehicle, it is not required to tape off the parts of the<br>
coating adjacent to the damaged area, since there is no need for protection against<br>
the deposition of spray mist. Thus, when a vehicle is partly refinished, the out-of-<br>
service time of the vehicle for refinishing can be significantly reduced.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the process for preparation of a visual properties-<br>
matching multilayer coating sheet according to the invention, steps c) to i) are<br>
carried out in a central multilayer coating sheet manufacturing location. A central<br>
multilayer coating sheet manufacturing location receives the visual property data of<br>
a surface to be matched in visual properties from two or more remote locations.<br>
Generally, the central location will serve a multitude, typically 20 or more, for<br>
example  up  to  500,   local   body shops.  A  central  multilayer coating   sheet<br><br>
manufacturing location may for example serve the body shops of a country or a<br>
part thereof, or a continent, or even the whole world.<br>
In this case local paint storage, mixing, and spraying operations at a vehicle body<br>
repair shop are not required, which saves time and money. Additionally, the<br>
preparation of visual properties-matching multilayer coating sheets can be fully<br>
automated in a dedicated central location, which again saves time and money.<br>
Automated preparation of the coating sheets has the further advantage that the<br>
exposure of human workers to potentially hazardous solvent fumes during<br>
application and drying of coating compositions is minimized. If the data determined<br>
in step a) are transmitted electronically via e-mail on one day, the visual properties-<br>
matching multilayer coating sheets may be prepared fully automatically under the<br>
control of a computer, for example overnight, and the finished visual properties-<br>
matching multilayer coating sheets can be posted to the vehicle owner or a vehicle<br>
body repair shop the following day, as the case may be. The out-of-service time of<br>
a vehicle can be further reduced in such an embodiment.<br><br>
