				<td>Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a blasting apparatus and a blasting method for removing or flattening a underwater base rock, and more particularly, to an apparatus and a method of blasting a underwater base rock, whereby a hole for laying an explosive is formed in a base rock, using a guide pipe in a barge and preventing any other materials from flowing into the hole for laying an explosive; and whereby an explosive is accurately loaded into the hole for laying an explosive through the guide pipe, without a diver to dive under water. Background Art<br>
Generally, when the foundation work of a bridge post needs to be performed to install a bridge structure in water, when an ocean structure with any specific puiposes needs to be built, when a channel of a ship is formed, or when a port or a harbor needs to be constructed, if a protruding or irregular base rock exists under the water where the aforementioned construction is performed, the underwater base rock removing and flattening work needs to be performed prior to the aforementioned construction.<br>
A method of removing an irregular underwater base rock typically includes performing a process of boring a hole for laying an explosive in the base rock, a process of loading an explosive in the hole for laying an explosive, and a process of blasting. In a conventional art, these processes of boring, loading and blasting are performed manually by divers or mechanically by an exclusive line with special equipment.<br>
Disclosure of Invention Technical Problem<br>
When the blasting method is performed manually by divers, the divers go under water to the underwater base rock, bore a hole to lay an explosive using a rock drill, and load an explosive in the hole, for blasting. Thus, the processes are very hard, the work efficiency deteriorates, and a long time is needed for the boring process. Consequently, the cost of labor of the divers rises and the cost of construction increases. Specifically, the divers are like to have accidents concerning safety.<br>
To solve the aforementioned problems in the manually performed method, the blasting method is performed mechanically. An exclusive boring machine which is capable of boring the underwater base rock is installed on a barge, and the exclusive line with specific equipment which is capable of performing the loading of an<br>
explosive and the measurement is used.<br>
However, in both of the manual method and the mechanical method, an explosive is loaded in the hole for laying an explosive after boring the base rock. Accordingly, earth and sand, sludge and the like are filled into the hole for laying an explosive. When the hole for laying an explosive is filled with the earth and sand, sludge and the like, an explosive is not accurately loaded, thereby causing a problem in that the explosive fails to be exploded upon blasting.<br>
Korea Patent Registration No. 284837 (hereinafter, referred to as a 'Prior art') suggests a method of blasting underwater base rock to solve the aforementioned problem.<br>
In the prior art, after a boring process for blasting an underwater base rock is performed using a rock drill from a ship, a plastics pipe is driven into a hole bored in the underwater base rock. The plastics pipe is driven so that its upper end is exposed above earth and sand to maintain an empty wall. In this state, since an explosive is loaded, the hole under water is unlikely to be filled with earth and sand.<br>
Although the prior art provides the aforementioned useful effect, it unnecessarily needs additional processes, such as a process of completely separating a bit from a casing and a process of inserting an additional plastics pipe into the casing, to maintain the empty wall in the hole bored in the base rock.<br>
Moreover, since the plastics pipe maintaining the empty wall is exposed in water, a diver needs to dive under water to load an explosive into the plastics pipe. Therefore, the prior art has the same problem in the conventional blasting method performed manually by divers. Technical Solution<br>
To clearly solve the problems of the prior an which need to be improved, an object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus of blasting an underwater base rock, in which a boring guide unit which is adjustable in length is prepared so that, when a guide pipe positioned at a lower position is stably set on an underwater base rock, a pressurizing unit is always exposed above the surface of water, irrespective of the depth of water, thereby enabling a hole for laying an explosive to be formed, without earth and sand, sludge and the like by the guide pipe, and enabling an explosive to be loaded in the hole for laying an explosive, through the guide pipe from a barge.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a method of blasting an underwater base rock, comprising: stably setting a guide pipe on a base rock, by pressurizing a pressurizing unit and allowing a guide pipe to pass through earth and sand; excavating the base rock to form a hole for laying an explosive in the base rock, by allowing a bit of a rock drill to be input through the guide pipe; separating the bit<br>
from the hole for laying an explosive and the guide pipe: and loading an explosive in the hole for laying an explosive through the guide pipe, so that an diver does not need to dive under water and on a barge, an operator directly loads an explosive in the hole for laying an explosive.<br>
Advantageous Effects<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a boring guide unit is freely adjustable in length, thereby exposing a pressurizing unit above the surface of water, irrespective of the depth of water. After a guide pipe is stably set on a base rock by pressurizing the pressurizing unit by a rock drill on a barge, a hole for laying an explosive is bored. Accordingly, the guide pipe effectively prevents earth and sand or sludge from flowing into the hole for laying an explosive as bored.<br>
Furthermore, after the excavating process, a bit of the rock drill is separated from the guide pipe. Then, an explosive is loaded into the hole for laying an explosive through the guide pipe from the barge. Accordingly, since a diver does not need to additionally dive under water, the problem of a base rock blasting process performed manually by divers is clearly solved.<br>
Furthermore, since the entire process of blasting the underwater base rock is very easy and more simplified, the work time and air are considerably reduced, thereby reducing the cost of construction. Brief Description of the Drawings<br>

A rod 8a with a bit 8 is connected to a lower end of the rock drill motor 5. so that the bit 8 is rotated to excavate a base rock 1. by the operation of the rock drill motor 5.<br>
The dominant characteristics of the present invention are that it is possible to form a hole 9 for laying an explosive in the underwater base rtKk 1 and to load an explosive in the hole 9 for laying an explosive, by using a boring guide unit 100 on the barge 2. without a diver who directly dives under water.<br>
As illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2, the boring guide unit 100 according to the present invention comprises: a guide pipe 110 passing through underwater earth and sand 10. to be set on the base rock I; a length adjusting unit 120 connected to an upper end of the guide pipe 110: and a pressurizing unit 130 connected to an upper end of the length adjusting unit 120.<br>
The present invention having the aforementioned constitution according to the present invention will be described in more detail with reference to embodiments.<br>
The guide pipe 110 is positioned at a lowest end of the boring guide unit 100. A female coupler 111 is formed in one body with an upper part of the guide pipe 110 so as to be connected to the length adjusting unit 120. The lower end part of the guide pipe 110 has a general pipe shape to easily pass through the earth and sand 10 and to be stably set on the base rock 1.<br>
A number of discharge openings 1 12 are formed, at vertically equal intervals, on an outer circumference of the guide pipe 110.<br>
When the rod Xa and the bit 8 passing through the inside of the guide pipe 1 10 are simultaneously rotated to excavate the base rock 1, earth and sand, sludge, pieces of crushed base rocks, and the like rise upwardly along the guide pipe 110. Then, the discharge openings 112 formed on the guide pipe 110 allow the earth and sand, sludge, pieces of crushed base rocks, and the like to be more effectively discharged to the outside.<br>
The length adjusting unit 120 connected to the upper end of the guide pipe 110 connects the guide pipe 110 to the pressurizing unit 130. One or two length adjusting units are connected so that the top end of the pressurizing unit 130 is always exposed above the surface of water, irrespective of the depth of water.<br>
That is, depending on the depth of water in a place of work, the appropriate number of the length adjusting units 120 is used to be connected to the upper end of the guide pipe 110. The pressurizing unit 130 is connected to the upper part of the length adjusting unit 120, so that the pressurizing unit 130 is consistently exposed above the surface of water.<br>
A male coupler 122 being connected to the female coupler 111 of the guide pipe 110 is connectedly formed at the lower end of the length adjusting unit 120 performing the above-described function. A female coupler 121 being selectively connected to the pressurizing unit 130 is connectedly formed at the upper end of the length adjusting unit 120.<br>
The pressurizing unit 132, which is positioned to be exposed above the surface of water by the length adjusting unit 120, includes a guide holder 131 and a male coupler 132. The guide holder 131 is attached, in one body, to a lower end of the pressurizing unit 130. The male coupler 132 being connected to the female coupler 121 of the length adjusting unit 120 is connectedly formed under the guide holder 131. Accordingly, the pressurizing unit 130, the length adjusting unit 120 and the guide pipe 110 are connected together, so that an inner opening thereof is continuously and op-eratively connected.<br>
When the transfer frame 6 of the rock drill 3 being moved up or down is secured against the upper surface of the pressurizing unit 130. the boring guide unit 1 00. in which the pressurizing unit 130, the length adjusting unit 120 and the guide pipe 110 are connected, is moved down by the pressurizing force of the transfer frame 6, so that the guide pipe 110 passes through the earth and sand 10. to be stably set on the base rock 1.<br>
Further, when the boring guide unit 100 is positioned under water and performs a boring process in the base rock 1, the boring guide unit 100 is supported through a<br>
supporting holder 12 installed on the barge 2, thereby effectively preventing the boring guide unit 100 from being moved.<br>
The position of the female and male couplers 111. 121. 122 and 132 is not limited to the embodiment of the present invention. These couplers may be positioned in different positions. However, even if the couplers 111. 121, 122 and 132 are different in position to be installed and in kind in order to mutually and continuously connect the guide pipe 1 10. the length adjusting unit 120 and the pressurizing unit 130, these should be within the scope of the present invention.<br>
A method of blasting an underwater base rock, using the boring guide unit 100 according to the present invention in the aforementioned constitution, will be described.<br>
© A process of stably setting a guide pipe<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 5, a boring guide unit 100, which is linked to be suitable in length to allow a pressurizing unit 130 to be exposed above the surface of water, is put in water by an operator so that a lower end of a guide pipe 110 is placed on earth and sand 10.<br>
When a transfer frame 6 of a rock drill 3 is positioned on the pressurizing unit 130 and then is moved down, the boring guide unit 100 is moved down by the pressurizing force of the transfer frame 6 and the guide pipe 110 positioned at a lower part of the boring guide unit 100 passes through the earth and sand 10 and is stably set on a base<br>
l'(K'k 1.<br>
Then, the boring guide unit 100 is maintained to be interposed between the base rock 1 and the transfer frame 6, thereby being firmly supported, without being moved.<br>
@ A process of excavating a base rock<br>
When the guide pipe 110 is stably set on the base rock 1 by the pressurizing force of the transfer frame 6, a rod 8a and a bit 8 are driven to be moved down and rotated to enter the inside of the boring guide unit 100 through a guide holder 131 of the pressurizing unit 130, as illustrated in FIGS. 6 and 7.<br>
The bit 8 is progressively moved down to reach the base rock 1 and sequentially excavates the base rock 1, thereby forming a hole 9 for laying an explosive.<br>
Then, the guide pipe 110 separates the hole 9 for laying an explosive from the earth and sand 10, so that earth and sand, sludge and the like are prevented from flowing into the hole 9 for laying an explosive during the excavating process or even after the excavating process is completed. The earth and sand, sludge and pieces of crushed base rocks, which rise upwardly, together with water by a strong rotation force of the bit 8. pass through the guide pipe 110. the length adjusting unit 120 and the pressurizing unit 130 and are discharged outwardly.<br>
Then, the earth and sand, sludge, pieces of crushed base rocks and the like are better<br>
discharged through discharge openings 112 formed in the guide pipe 110. so that the hole 9 for laying an explosive is maintained so as to be clean.<br>
® A process of separating a bit<br>
When the hole 9 for laying an explosive is formed in the base rock I by the process of excavating the base rtx:k, the rod 8a and the bit 8 are transferred upward and completely separated from the guide pipe 1 10, so that the inside of the boring guide unit 100 is hollow in order to load an explosive in the hole 9.<br>
© A process of loading an explosive<br>
When an explosive connected to a detonating fuse is put in the guide holder 131 of the pressurizing unit 130 after separating the bit 8 from the guide pipe 110. the explosive sequentially passes through the guide holder 131. the length adjusting unit 120 and the inside of the guide pipe 110, without letting the explosive to go outwardly, and is accurately loaded in the hole 9 for laying an explosive.<br>
That is, the boring guide unit 100 functions as a transfer path through which the explosive is guided to be accurately loaded in the hole 9. Accordingly, even though no diver directly dives under water, it is possible for an operator in the barge 2 to lay the explosive.<br>
When the explosive is loaded in the hole 9, the operator pulls the boring guide unit 100 above the surface of water and connects a leading wire to the detonating fuse, thereby blasting the explosive and effectively blasting the base rock I.<br>
In accordance with the apparatus and method of blasting the underwater base rock of the present invention, the process of blasting the underwater base rock 1 is simply and quickly performed on the barge 2, and the blasting process is realized without divers at the expensive cost of labor.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
