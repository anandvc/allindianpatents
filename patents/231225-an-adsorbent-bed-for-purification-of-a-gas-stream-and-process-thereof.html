				<td>The present invention relates to an adsorbent bed for purification of a gas stream and process thereof.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001]    This invention relates to a pressure swing<br>
adsorption (PSA) system and process for purifying<br>
impure gas streams containing more than 5 0 mole %<br>
hydrogen, and more particularly to such a process for<br>
the production of high purity hydrogen from various<br>
hydrogen-containing feed mixtures such as synthesis<br>
gas.     The improved process provides higher hydrogen<br>
recovery and lower adsorbent inventory as compared with<br>
previously disclosed PSA processes for hydrogen<br>
production.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0002]    There is an'increasing need for high purity hydrogen in the.chemical process industries including steel annealing, silicon manufacturing, hydrogenation of fats and oils, glass making, hydrocracking, methanol production, the production of oxo alcohols, and icomeriisation processes. There are a variety of known processes wherein hydrogen is produced, including steam reforming of natural gas or naptha.  In this process a feedstock such as natural gas is compressed and fed to a purification unit to remove sulfur compounds.  The desulfurized feed is then mixed with superheated steam and fed to a reformer to produce primarily H2 and CO.  The effluent stream from the reformer is sent to a heat recovery unit, then to a shift converter to obtain additional H2.  The effluent from the shift converter passes through a process cooling  and recovery unit prior to sending the effluent<br><br>
.to a PSA system wherein high purity (e.g. 99.9 mol.% or greater) hydrogen is produced.<br>
[0003]    The H2 gas being fed to PSA systems can, however, contain several contaminants in widely varying concentrations, (e.g. the feed stream to the PSA from a steam methane reformer (SMR) may contain one or more of C02, CH4, CO and N2.  This combination of adsorbates at such widely varying compositions presents a significant challenge to the design of a PSA system, particularly with respect to adsorbent selection and configuration of the adsorber/adsorbent bed.<br>
[0004]    Representative prior art PSA processes include Sircar et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,077,779; Fuderer et al., U.S. Pat., 4,553,981; Fong et al., U.S. Pat No. 5,152,975; Wagner, U.S. Pat No. 3,430,418 and Batta, U.S.. Pat #3,564,816.<br>
[0005]    More specifically, Bernard et al.in U.S. Pat. •# 5,912,422 discloses a PSA process for the separation ..of hydrogen from a feed gas mixture'that contains CO and other impurities such as CO2 and hydrocarbons.  The feed mixture is passed into a first adsorbent to remove • CO2 and/or hydrocarbons, and then into a second adsorbent that is a faujasite type zeolite with at least 80 % lithium exchange to remove primarily CO impurity to produce hydrogen.  If N2 is present in the hydrogen-containing feed mixture then Bernard et al. , introduces a third adsorbent between the first and second adsorbent to remove nitrogen. [0006]    Golden et al., U.S. Pat .# 4,957,514 disclosed the purification of hydrogen using barium exchanged Type X zeolite.<br><br>
[0007]    Golden at•al., US Pat. #  6,027,549, disclose a PSA process to remove C02 and CH4 using activated carbons having bulk densities in the range of approximately 35-38 lb/ft3.<br>
[0008]    Johnson et al., in US Patent 6,302,943 and in EP 1097746A2, disclose adsorbents for H2 recovery by pressure and vacuum swing adsorption, wherein the adsorbents at the product end of the bed have Henry's Law constants between 0.8 and 2.2 mmol/g/atm for CO and between 0.55 to 1.40 mmol/g/atm N2.<br>
[0009]    There remains a need for improved PSA system and process having lower adsorbent requirements and higher product recovery as compared to existing PSA systems and processes for hydrogen production. [0010]    The present invention addresses this need through the use of a novel selection and arrangement of adsorbents within the adsorbent bed.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
[0011]    In accordance with this invention, each adsorber (bed) of the H2-PSA system is divided into four regions.    In a preferred embodiment the first region comprises an adsorbent  for the removal of water from the feed stream. The second region functions to reduce high (&gt;10% by vol.) level contaminants (e.g., C02)  in the hydrogen containing feed to less than 10%. The third region comprises an adsorbent capable of reducing the concentrations of all impurities entering this layer to less than 1%. The fourth region consist of adsorbents having high Henry's Law constants for N2 (e.g. greater than 1.5mmol/gm bar and preferably<br><br>
greater than 2.3 mmol/gm bar) and GO (e.g. greater than 2.94 mmol/gm bar) to remove the remaining impurities to achieve the desired product (H2) purity.  In one embodiment the second region may be omitted and/or combined with the third region.  Other embodiments are also disclosed.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
[0019]    In accordance with the invention, an improve-PSA system and process is provided for purifying a gas stream containing more than 50 mol.% hydrogen*<br><br>
[0020]    Typically H2 feed gas to a PSA contains several contaminants, such as H20, C02, CH4, CO, and N2. As used herein, all gas component percentages are mol.% unless otherwise indicated. Such a combination of adsorbates at such widely varying compositions presents significant challenge to efficient adsorbent selection. •• [0021]   A preferred embodiment of the invention is illustrated with reference to Figure 1.  In this •embodiment, the PSA process uses an adsorbent bed comprising four regions of adsorbents.  For the purposes of this disclosure, the first region is that  ; which is closest to the feed end of the bed as indicated by the arrows indicating the direction of gas ' flow.<br>
[0022]    The first region of the bed comprises adsorbents to remove contaminants like water.  The adsorbent for the first layer (first region) may be selected,from the group consisting of alumina, silica gel, silicalite or zeolites.<br>
[0023]    The adsorbent for the second layer/region is utilized for the removal of C02 and some CH4.  In a preferred embodiment, this layer comprises activated carbon having a bulk density of 38-46 lb/ft3 (measured by ASTM Standard D-2854), which may be mixed with a weaker adsorbent (for C02 and CH4) such as alumina. The purpose of the mixture is to minimize the temperature gradient of the layer as well as the thermal swing associated with the heat of adsorption. The most preferred activcited carbon is G2X activated carbon available from Takeda Chemical Industries, Japan.<br><br>
[0024]    With respect to the mixture, different fractions of alumina and activated carbon may be used. The optimum quantity of alumina and carbon for the mixture is dictated by the PSA process operating conditions, feed composition and the local gas phase concentration in the bed.  Mixtures of other strong and weak adsorbents may also be used to achieve the desired reduction of thermal gradients in the bed.  One such mixture could be activated carbon and ZnX zeolite or alumina and ZnX.  Additional details on using mixtures of strong and weak adsorbents in PSA processes are disclosed by Ackley et al., US Patent # 6,027,548. [0025]    The adsorbent for the third layer is utilized for the removal of residual CH4 and the bulk of the N2 and CO in the feed stream.  A preferred adsorbent for this region is activated carbon having a bulk density greater than or equal to 38 lb/ft3' As with layer 2, G2X activated carbon is the most preferred material. Cation exchanged forms of zeolites A, X, Y (e.g. ZnX and ZnY), chabazites and ^ mordenite, and more particularly, X zeolite exchanged with Zn2+ and Cu2"1" ions at different percentages of exchange may be used. The synthesis of Zn2+ and Cu2+ exchanged X zeolite is given by Khelifa et al., Microporous and Mesoporous Materials, Vol. 32, pg 199, 1999 and references therein.  In addition, alternative materials for region 3 of the bed may include impregnated activated carbons having bulk densities in the range of 32-45 lb/ft3.  An example of one such impregnated activated carbon is Sn-activated carbon (Sn-AC).  More specifically, the activated carbon is impregnated with about 35% SnCl2.2H2O salt and then dried at 180 °C to produce AC-<br><br>
SnO2.  Additional information on the synthesis of Sn-activated carbons (Sn-AC) is given by lyuke et al., Chemical Engineering Science, Vol. 55, pg 4745, 2000. Relatively less preferred materials are activated carbons for region 3 of the bed.<br>
[0026]    As indicated above, preferred adsorbents to be used in the second and third regions of the bed preferably have a high bulk density, in the range of 38-46 lb./ft3 . The use of such materials results in higher H2 recovery (about a 10% improvement) over conventional processes and lower adsorbent inventory for the PSA process.  Among the adsorbents having bulk density in the preferred range, adsorbents having the highest dynamic capacity for the contaminant should be chosen. For the purposes of this invention, the dynamic loading capacity is defined as is the difference between the loading under adsorption conditions and loading under desorption conditions.<br>
[0027]    Since regions 2 and 3 remove the majority of C02, CO, CH4 and N2 present in the H2 containing feed mixture, the largest thermal gradients and thermal swings are present in those two regions of the bed, with region 2 having greater thermal gradients and thermal swings in the bed than region 3.   Two mixture combinations of adsorbents were compared for region 2 of the bed.  A lower density activated carbon (BPL, available from Calgon Carbon Corp. USA) having a density of less than 38 lb/ft3 was also analyzed for comparison to G2X performance.  The results are shown Table 1 below.<br><br>
[0028]<br>
Table 1:  Regions 2 and 3 (see Fig. 3) Temperature Swing and Dynamic Loadings of CO2 and CH4 on activated carbons (G2X &amp; BPL) , alumina, and mixtures of A201 alumina and G2X activated carbon.<br><br>
(Table Remove) A = delta<br>
[0029]    Table 1 clearly illustrates, that the adverse thermal gradient in region 2 of the bed is reduced significantly by mixing G2X carbon with a weaker adsorbent (e.g., alumina).  As shown in Table 1, mixtures of G2X carbon and 25% or 50% A201 activated alumina (available from UOP, Des Plaines, IL, USA) were evaluated to reduce thermal swings in the bed.  The thermal swings were reduced from 25K for the G2X carbon alone to 20K and 16K for the respective mixtures.  The delta COa and delta CH4 (loadings decreased 14% and 18%, respectively for the 75% carbon mixture.  The dynamic loadings of the mixtures are* higher than the simple weighted average of the adsorbent loadings due to the reduction in the adverse thermal swing, i.e. due to the lower heats of adsorption and the increased heat capacity provided by the higher density, weaker adsorbent.  A secondary advantage of the use of a mixture in region 2 is the impact upon the base<br><br>
temperature in region 3.  The delta N2 and delta CH4 loadings (not shown in Table 1) are about 10% higher due to the lower temperature in region 2 resulting from the mixture.  Thus, in the most preferred practice of this invention, the second region consists of a mixture of a stronger and weaker adsorbents (e.g. a mixture of alumina and G2X activated carbon) to reduce the concentration of high level contaminants that are present in the H2 containing feed mixture.  By using a mixture of adsorbent in region 2, the reduced thermal swing-actually increases the.local dynamic capacity of the bed and reduces the adsorbent inventory required. [0030]    The final cleanup for N2 and residual impurities (e.g., CO, CH4 , 02, Ar) is done in region 4 of the bed.  In accordance with the invention, the most preferred adsorbents for region four have a N2 Henry's Law Constant between 2.58 mmol/g.bar and 10 mmol/g.bar, preferably between 2.58 and 4.3 mmol/g.bar.  Adsorbents having a CO Henry's Law Constant of greater than 2.94 mmol/g.bar is also preferred.  In the practice of the invention, adsorbents with high Henry's law constant achieve increased dynamic capacity, as well as lower bed pressure during equalization and purge steps in the PSA cycle. Consequently, higher H2 recovery and lower bed size factor are achieved due to lower bed pressure prior to counter-current (with respect to feed direction) blowdown in the PSA cycle.  By using adsorbents with high Henry's constants in the purification zone of the bed, the spreading of the mass transfer zone is suppressed during the co-current pressure changing steps (e.g., bed-to-bed equalization) in the PSA cycle.  The sharpness of the impurity<br><br>
concentration fronts lead to increase in recovery and lower adsorbent inventory.  Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations indicate that adsorbents having the above Henry's Constant (&gt;2.3 mmol/g.bar) include CaEMT, CaMOR and LiMOR and absorbents with Henry's constant ^1.5 rnmol/g.bar such as VSA-6, Baylith KEH 650, KEJ407, CaX(2.0), LiX(2.0) (&gt;86% Li), LiCaX (2.0) and binderless LiX(2.0) (&gt;86% Li), where (2.0) refers to the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio could be used, however absorbents with Henry's Law constant &gt;10 mmol/g.bar are generally not suitable in the practice of the invention.  Note that the Henry's Law constant is based upon isotherm model and a specific temperature.  The .specific pressure only relates to the determination of the delta N2 loading.<br>
[0031]    Alternative materials for region 4 include naturally occurring crystalline zeolite molecular sieves such as chabazite, erionite, clinoptilolite, arid faujasite, and suitable synthetic zeolite molecular sieves such as ZSM-2, ZSM-3, EMC-2 (containing hexagonal faujasite possessing structure code EMT), beta, mordenite, heulandite,A, D, R, T, X, Y, and L. Also, other metal exchanged zeolites containing cations selected from group I ( e.g., Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs) and group II (e.g., Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba) of the periodic table may also be used.  In addition, zeolites A and X having at least 50% of its AlO2 elements associated with cations chosen from the group formed by calcium, lithium, zinc, copper, manganese, magnesium, nickel, strontium and barium could be used in region 4 of the bed.   Furthermore, mordenites exchanged with Li or Ca cations, EMT, FAU, MOR, and CaX could also be used<br><br>
in the purification zone (region 4) of the bed to remove impurities such as N2 and traces of CH4, and CO to produce high purity H2 .  The three letter codes identifying the tetrahedral frameworks are structure type codes assigned by the international Zeolite Association in accordance with rules set up by the IUPAC Commission on Zeolite Structure' Types, W.M. Meier et al., 4th Revised Edition, 1996.  The most desired Si/Al ratios for the adsorbents selected for region 4 of the bed are as follows:  CaA (Si/Al = 1.0), LiX (Si/Al = 1.25), LiX (Si/Al = 1.0), CaX (Si/Al = 1.25), CaX (Si/Al = 1.0), Li-Mordenite (Si/Al = 5.0), Ca-Mordenite (Si/Al = 5.0) and CaEMT (Si/Al = 1.0).  In addition, zeolite containing lithium/alkaline earth metal A and X zeolites (Chao et al . , U.S. Pat Nos . 5,413,625; 5,174,979; 5, (598, 013; 5,454,857 and 4,859,217) may also be used in region 4 of this invention.<br>
[0032]    For 'the purpose of this application, the Henry' s Law Constant is defined from the following-equation representing a linear form of the isotherm in the low partial pressure region:<br>
[0033]    In evaluating the N2 Henry's Law Constant (X0KH) , the pure component loading ratio correlation (LRC) (Yang, "Gas Separation by Adsorption Processes, 1987) was used.  The LRC isotherm equation yields an expression for KH:<br><br>
where, KI and HI are determined from the LRC constants:<br>
[0034]    The LRC constants are determined from pure component isotherm data.  For N2 adsorption on CaX(2.0),  the LRC constants have the following values: X0 = 3.77, Al =23.56, A2 = - 3151,  A3 = 1.0 and A4 = 320.  In selecting adsorbents for N2 cleanup (region 4) in H2 purification, it is only necessary to define a limiting value for X0KH and an upper limit N2 partial pressure defining the maximum amount of N2 that is likely to be found in the H2 stream.<br>
[0035]    PSA process simulations for H2 production using  adsorbents with the highest Henry's law constant provided the highest M2 working capacity (i.e., required the smallest N2 cleanup layer) in region 4 as shown in Figure 2.  When N2 working capacity was correlated with the Henry's Law Constant of the N2 isotherm, the linear correlation illustrated in Figure 3 for conditions of 310K and PN2 = 93.6 mbar was produced.  The data points in Figure 3 are from the adsorbents in Figure 2.  The largest Henry's Law Constant tested occurs for CaX (2.0) at 2.38 mmol/g bar.  It is from this data that the inventive Henry's Law constant range was determined. Henry's Law constant<br><br>
&gt;10 holds the adsorbate so strongly that desorption would require lower desorption pressure and/or higher desorption temperature.  The result is' that the purge gas and power requirement for the system would be increased to unacceptable levels.<br>
[0036]    The increased H2 recovery and lower adsorbent inventory required by the PSA process of this invention is further illustrated in the examples given below. In order to compare the PSA process performance using the adsorbents of this invention with prior art, the four bed PSA system shown in Figure 4 will be used. The valve switching logic is shown in Table 2 and details of the PSA process given in Tables 3-5. However, it should be noted that the twelve step PSA cycle is used only to illustrate the enhanced PSA process performance achieved by replacing (prior art) adsorbents with the advanced adsorbents for regions 2-4 of the bed.  In addition, other PSA cycles may also be used to show the enhanced PSA process performance without deviating from the scope of this invention. [0037]    Figure 4 shows four adsorbent beds (El, B2,B3 and B4) and associated valves and conduits that will be used to illustrate the enhanced PSA process performance of this invention. Referring to Figures 1 and 4, one embodiment of this invention is disclosed over one complete PSA cycle, and the PSA valve switching and steps are given in Tables 2 and 3, respectively.  Also,, region 1 contains alumina, region 2 contains a mixture of 50 % each of A201 alumina and Takeda G2X activated carbon, region 3 contains G2X activated carbon, and region 4 contains CaX(2.0).<br><br>

[0058]    It should be recognized that the aforementioned examples utilized similar operating PSA process conditions to illustrate the enhanced performance using CaX(2.0), VSA6 and high bulk density activated carbon relative to prior art PSA processes using 5A zeolite.  Other embodiments which use more or less adsorbers in the PSA cycle could easily be designed by those skilled in the art without deviating<br>
from the scope of this invention. [0059]    Figure 5 compares the PSA process performance, obtained via computer simulations, using the PSA processes of Tables 4-6.  Note that in the upper drawing of Fig. 5, that for about the same H2<br><br>
purity (99.99%), the H2 recovery using 5A zeolite (PA) is about 76% (Table 6).  By using the adsorbents of this invention, the H2 recovery is about 80% (Table 5, i.e., IV!), and 84% (Table 4, i.e., IV2), respectively. The lower diagram of Figure 5 shows the total bed size factor (BSF, lb/TPDH2) obtained using each of the aforementioned adsorbents and the PSA processes of Tables 4-6.<br>
[0060]    Figure 6 shows the total bed size factor (BSF, lb/TPDH2) obtained using each of the aforementioned adsorbents and the PSA processes of Tables 4-6. The lower diagram shows the percentage reduction in bed size factor of this invention (IV! &amp; IV2) relative to the prior art (PA).  Note that IV! gives about 35% reduction over the prior art (PA) and IV2 gives about 50% reduction in the bed size factor' relative to the prior art (PA).  The 50 % reduction in bed size factor in IV2 implies that IV2 needs only half the adsorbent inventory relative to the prior art (PA) process.<br>
[0061]    Variations of the invention are also contemplated.  For example, the region/layer of each bed could be replaced with multiple layers of different adsorbents. For example, the adsorbent layer could be substituted by a composite adsorbent layer containing different adsorbent materials positioned in separate zones in which temperature conditions favor adsorption performance of the particular adsorbent material under applicable processing conditions in each zone. Further details on composite adsorbent layer design is given by Notaro et al., U.S. Pat. #5,674,311.<br><br>
[0062]    Further, consideration of the dynamic or rate effects may achieve enhanced PSA process performance. In particular, the adsorbents selected for regions. 2-4 of the bed could be improved by using higher rate adsorbents in those regions.  Also, higher surface area/higher porosity adsorbent and/or smaller particles would provide higher adsorption/desorption kinetics. In addition, in region 4 of the bed, a higher rate material such as binderless LiX(2.0) would be desirable.  This material could be placed in the entire zone (region 4) or on top of region 4.  The adsorbent used in region 4 of the bed (e.g., CaX) could be caustically digested (c.d.) to produce adsorbents with different adsorption/desorption rates.  Also, smaller particles may also be employed here as well to improve rate.  Adsorbents having diameters in-the range of 0.5-2.0 mm are preferred in regions 2-4 of the bed in the practice of this invention.<br>
[00633    Although the above PSA processes are discussed in relation to H2 production, the recommended adsorbents may also be applicable to other separation processes.  Examples include helium recovery from natural gas or cryogenic sources (e.g., NRU/HRU), CO2 production from synthesis gas, or in other PSA processes to produce H2 and CO, or. H2 and CO2 from various mixtures containing these components.  In addition the PSA process of this invention could also be used with hydrogen containing feed gas that contains additional impurities such as oxygen and argon. [0064]    Specific features of the invention are shown in one or more of the drawings for convenience only, as each feature may be combined with other features in<br><br>
accordance with the invention.  Alternative embodiments will be recognized by those skilled in the art and are intended to be included within the scope of the claims.<br><br><br><br>
