				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR ELECTRIC<br>
MOTOR TORQUE MONITORING<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]       The present invention generally relates to electric motors, and more<br>
particularly relates to methods and apparatus for monitoring electric motor<br>
torque.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Electric motors (e.g., permanent magnet synchronous motors) are<br>
used in a variety of applications, including vehicle applications. In hybrid<br>
vehicle development, the electric motor is a fundamental component of the<br>
hybrid powertrain system. Among other functions, the electric motor is a<br>
torque source. For example, the motor may be operated to produce a positive<br>
torque for propelling the vehicle in a motoring mode. The motor may also be<br>
operated to produce a negative torque for energy generation in a generating<br>
mode.<br>
[0003] The actual torque output of the electric motor may not necessarily<br>
correspond with a desired or commanded torque, and thus affect the torque<br>
integrity. For example, the electric motor may produce a torque output having<br>
a polarity that is opposite of the commanded torque. The commanded torque<br>
value may be compared with the actual torque output of the electric motor to<br>
determine whether a threshold is exceeded for control. However, a number of<br>
variables (e.g., measured motor speed, conditions contributing to losses,<br>
sensed rotor position, or the like) may affect the determination of the actual<br>
torque output.<br>
[0004] Accordingly, it is desirable to provide a method and system for<br>
monitoring electric motor torque. Additionally, it is desirable to provide a<br>
method and system for detecting motor torque integrity of hybrid vehicles.<br>
Furthermore, other desirable features and characteristics of the present<br>
invention will become apparent from the subsequent detailed description and<br><br>
the appended claims, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings<br>
and the foregoing technical field and background.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005] Methods and apparatus are provided for monitoring a motor torque<br>
produced by an electric motor. In one embodiment, a method is provided for<br>
monitoring an achieved motor torque produced by an electric motor in<br>
response to a torque command. The electric motor is operable at a motor<br>
speed. The method comprises determining the achieved motor torque based<br>
on a rotor position of the electric motor and a phase current of the electric<br>
motor when the motor speed is not greater than a first pre-determined<br>
threshold, determining the achieved motor torque based on a loss-compensated<br>
power supplied to the electric motor when the motor speed is greater than the<br>
first pre-determined threshold, comparing the achieved motor torque with the<br>
torque command, and indicating a fault when the achieved motor torque is not<br>
within a pre-determined margin of the torque command.<br>
[0006] In another embodiment, a controller is provided for monitoring an<br>
achieved motor torque produced by an electric motor in response to a torque<br>
command. The controller comprises an input, an output, and a processor<br>
coupled to the input and the output. The input is operable to receive the motor<br>
speed of the electric motor, the torque command, a rotor position of the<br>
electric motor, and a phase current of the electric motor. The output is<br>
configured to provide a signal indicating a fault. The processor is configured<br>
to determine the achieved motor torque based on the rotor position of the<br>
electric motor and the phase current of the electric motor when the motor<br>
speed is not greater than a first pre-determined threshold, determine the<br>
achieved motor torque based on a loss-compensated power supplied to the<br>
electric motor when the motor speed is greater than the first pre-determined<br>
threshold, and produce the signal when the achieved motor torque is not<br>
within a pre-determined margin of the torque command.<br>
[0007] In another embodiment, a software program is provided comprising<br>
software instructions arranged to run on a processor to monitor an achieved<br><br>
motor torque produced by an electric motor. The software program, when<br>
installed and operating on the processor, results in the processor determining<br>
the achieved motor torque based on a rotor position of the electric motor and a<br>
phase current of the electric motor when the motor speed is not greater than a<br>
first pre-determined threshold, determining the achieved motor torque based<br>
on a loss-compensated power supplied to the electric motor when the motor<br>
speed is greater than the first pre-determined threshold, comparing the<br>
achieved motor torque with the torque command, and indicating a fault is the<br>
achieved motor torque is not within a pre-determined margin of the torque<br>
command.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF AN EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT<br>
[0014]       The following detailed description is merely illustrative in nature<br>
and is not intended to limit the invention or the application and uses of the<br>
invention. Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any expressed or<br><br>
implied theory presented in the preceding technical field, background, brief<br>
summary or the following detailed description.<br>
[0015] A method, controller, and software program are provided for<br>
monitoring a torque output of an electric motor, such as a permanent magnet<br>
(PM) machine. In general, the torque produced by the electric motor is<br>
monitored to determine motor torque integrity, secure the delivery of torque<br>
from the electric motor, and provide a warning or transmit fault information if<br>
the motor torque integrity is not within desired operating criteria. The term<br>
"secure" is used herein to generally refer to an indication of reliability of<br>
variables used to determine the motor torque and of the motor torque itself.<br>
Appropriate remedial actions may be taken in response to the warning or upon<br>
receipt of the fault information.<br>
[0016] In one embodiment, a motor torque monitor (MTM) is provided to<br>
monitor the torque produced by the electric motor, for example, as part of an<br>
overall hybrid vehicle torque security. The MTM may be integrated into<br>
multi-layer or multi-level control architectures for vehicle systems. For<br>
example, the MTM may be integrated with layer one diagnostics (e.g., a basic<br>
diagnostic layer) and assume the functionality of the layer one diagnostics<br>
including, but not necessarily limited to, electrical and performance<br>
diagnostics for resolvers, current sensors, voltage measurements, temperature<br>
measurements, or the like, of a vehicle system. Additionally, the MTM may<br>
assume the functionality of forward path torque control functions associated<br>
with the control architecture including, but not necessarily limited to, current<br>
feedback control, pulse width modulation (PWM), temperature compensation,<br>
torque limiting, torque protection, or the like.<br>
[0017] Referring to FIG. 1, a vehicle control system 100 is shown in<br>
accordance with an exemplary embodiment. The system 100 comprises an<br>
electric motor 102, a hybrid powertrain control system 104 coupled to the<br>
electric motor 102, and a vehicle controller 122 in communication with the<br>
hybrid powertrain control system 104 (e.g., via a serial peripheral interface<br>
(SPI)). The vehicle controller 122 interfaces with one or more control<br>
systems, such as an anti-lock brake system (ABS) electronic control unit<br><br>
(ECU) 108, a power steering system 110, or the like, and may interface with a<br>
central gateway 112 that provides communication with other vehicle control<br>
systems. One or more additional electric motors may be coupled to, and<br>
thereby controlled by, the hybrid powertrain control system 104. Although the<br>
system 100 is described in the context of a hybrid vehicle powertrain (e.g., a<br>
gas-electric hybrid vehicle powertrain), the system 100 may be implemented<br>
for other systems incorporating one or more electric motors.<br>
[0018] In this embodiment, the hybrid powertrain control system 104<br>
comprises an engine control module (ECM) 114, a transmission control<br>
module 116, a battery management module 118, a motor control processor<br>
(MCP) 120, and a hybrid control processor (HCP) 106, although the hybrid<br>
powertrain control system 104 may include additional ECUs, processors,<br>
modules, or the like. For example, in one advanced hybrid vehicle<br>
implementation, two electric motors are typically used with an internal<br>
combustion engine or with fuel cells, and each of the electric motors is<br>
controlled with a separate MCP. Additionally, the hybrid powertrain control<br>
system 104 may be partitioned in a variety of other configurations.<br>
[0019] Among other functions, the hybrid powertrain control system 104<br>
controls the operation of the electric motor 102 through the MCP 120. For<br>
example, the MCP 120 performs forward path torque control functions<br>
including, but not necessarily limited to, current feedback control, pulse width<br>
modulation (PWM), temperature compensation, torque limiting, torque<br>
protection, or the like. The HCP 106 establishes a pre-determined hybrid<br>
operating strategy and coordinates a variety of operations of the hybrid vehicle<br>
in furtherance thereof. For example, the HCP 106 determines a preferred<br>
motor torque for a given driver command and for a particular vehicle<br>
condition based on the pre-determined hybrid operating strategy.<br>
[0020] FIG. 2 is a block diagram of a motor torque monitor (MTM) 200 in<br>
accordance with an exemplary embodiment. Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, the<br>
MTM 200 is incorporated into the MCP 120 in one embodiment. Executable<br>
instruction sets within the MTM 200, such as stored in a memory 202 of the<br>
MTM 200, comprise software code for monitoring operations of the electric<br><br>
motor 102. One or more of the components of the MTM 200 may be<br>
embodied in software or firmware, hardware, such as an application specific<br>
integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated,<br>
or group) and memory that execute one or more software or firmware<br>
programs, a combinational logic circuit, and/or other suitable components, or a<br>
combination thereof.<br>
[0021] A primary function of the MTM 200 is to monitor an achieved<br>
torque produced by the electric motor 102, report the diagnostic result, and<br>
trigger remedial action if a fault is detected. The term "achieved torque" is<br>
referred to herein as a calculated torque output of the electric motor 102 based<br>
at least in part on a secured rotor position of the electric motor 102 and<br>
secured phase current signals or based in part on the estimated motor torque<br>
(e.g., based on an ideal power considering some or all losses). In the process<br>
of securing the achieved torque of the electric motor 102, the MTM 200<br>
acquires one or more sensed current signals, a resolver signal, a Vdc signal, a<br>
torque command (e.g., a torque setpoint signal or a requested torque), a motor<br>
speed signal, and information from one or more calibration look-up tables<br>
(LUTs) (e.g., from other data storage devices accessible by the MCP 120<br>
within the hybrid powertrain control system 104 or via the HCP 106 or within<br>
the memory 202 of the MTM 200). By securing the achieved torque and the<br>
torque capabilities of the electric motor 102, the MTM 200 operates as a<br>
higher level control (e.g., a layer two control of a multi-layer or multi-level<br>
control architecture) to capture or indicate faults that may not have been<br>
captured by a lower level (e.g., the layer one diagnostics). In the event a<br>
particular signal is determined to be unsecure by the MTM 200, a remedial<br>
action may be taken. For example, the HCP 106 may initiate any number of<br>
different programs, executable instructions sets, or the like.<br>
[0022] In one embodiment, layer one diagnostics of a multi-layer control<br>
architecture are applied to at least some of these signals prior to being received<br>
by the MTM 200. Generally, the information contained in these signals are<br>
transferred to the memory 202 of the MTM 200, and the information<br>
contained in each of these signals is secured, directly or indirectly, by the<br><br>
MTM 200 prior to determining the achieved torque of the electric motor 102<br>
and securing this achieved torque. A maximum loop time (e.g., about 10 ms)<br>
may be selected to ensure the receipt of the various signals by the MTM 200<br>
and secure the achieved torque and torque capabilities.<br>
[0023] Layer one diagnostics are applied to the one or more sensed current<br>
signals, which represent a current supplied to the electric motor 102. For<br>
example, a voltage source inverter (not shown) may be used to supply current<br>
to the electric motor 102. For a three-phase electric motor, the voltage source<br>
inverter supplies a current for each phase of the three-phase electric motor<br>
(e.g., a first phase current (ia), a second phase current (ib), and a third phase<br>
current (ic)), and three sensed current signals are derived from the three<br>
currents corresponding to each phase of the three-phase electric motor. For<br>
example, the voltage source inverter produces three-phase voltages (e.g., Va,<br>
Vb, Vc) from a supply potential (e.g., a battery or DC bus voltage (2Vdc)) and<br>
drives the electric motor 102 with the three-phase voltages. The voltage<br>
source inverter converts the supply voltage (2Vdc) into an AC voltage which is<br>
used to drive the electric motor 102, and the AC voltage is based on three<br>
phase currents (e.g., ia, ib, and ic). Applying layer one diagnostics to the<br>
current sensor signals may determine, whether current sensor wires are faulty,<br>
whether a current-sensing circuit has a short to a power supply (e.g., a<br>
battery), or the like.<br>
[0024] Following layer one diagnostics of the three-phase sensed current<br>
signals, the MTM 200 secures the sensed current signals. For example, the<br>
MTM 200 compares a sum of the phase currents (e.g., ia, ib, and ic) associated<br>
with each of the sensed current signals with a current threshold. The current<br>
threshold may be calibrated to judge a balance quality of the phase currents (ia,<br>
ib, and ic). If this sum exceeds the current threshold, the MTM 200 transmits a<br>
signal indicating a fault alarm. If this sum is within the current threshold, the<br>
sensed current signals are secured.<br>
[0025] In addition to the sensed current signals, layer one diagnostics may<br>
be applied to the resolver signal, which indicates a rotor position (9) of the<br>
electric motor 102.   The layer one diagnostics applied to the resolver signal<br><br>
may determine a short of the electric motor 102 to a ground or to a power<br>
supply (e.g., a battery); verify a resolver offset, or the like. A resolver<br>
decoding chip (not shown) in the MCP 120 may also provide intensive<br>
diagnostics to ensure the correctness of the rotor angle produced by the<br>
resolver. Based on the rotor position (θ), sine and cosine values of the rotor<br>
position (θ) may be calculated by the MCP 120 or other processor or retrieved<br>
from a calibration LUT (e.g., as part of the layer one diagnostics). A motor<br>
torque integrity test performed by the MTM 200, when the motor is at speed,<br>
indicates a fault if an error of the rotor angle exceeds a pre-determined<br>
maximum error, and this indirectly secures the rotor position signal.<br>
[0026] Following layer one diagnostics of the resolver signal, the MTM<br>
200 secures the resolver signal. For example, the resolver signal may be<br>
secured by the following relationship:<br>
sin2 (θ) + cos2 (θ) = 1	(eq. 1).<br>
If the relationship shown in equation 1 is false (e.g., indicating an incorrect<br>
rotor position (0), an incorrect look-up table value corresponding to the sine or<br>
cosine values of the rotor position (0), or the like), the MTM 200 transmits a<br>
signal indicating a fault alarm. If the relationship shown in equation 1 is true,<br>
then the resolver signal is secured.<br>
[0027] Although layer one diagnostics may be applied to the motor speed<br>
signal, which indicates the angular speed of the electric motor 102, the motor<br>
speed signal is indirectly secured by the MTM 200. The MTM 200 may<br>
perform a motor speed correlation test during the normal course of operation.<br>
The motor speed correlation test includes, among other analytical functions, a<br>
comparison of an engine speed and one or more electric motor speeds. For<br>
example, in a hybrid vehicle embodiment, the engine speed and the electric<br>
motor speeds (e.g., typically two electric motors) should follow a pre-<br>
determined relationship (e.g., based on the hybrid operating strategy). The<br>
motor speed correlation test indicates a fault if the motor speed is not within a<br>
pre-determined operating range, and thus operates, in this capacity, as a<br>
rationality test for indirectly securing the motor speed signal.<br><br>
[0028] In addition to the motor speed signal, the Vdc signal is indirectly<br>
secured by the MTM 200. The Vdc signal represents a high voltage, direct<br>
current (DC) bus voltage provided to the electric motor 102. Layer one<br>
diagnostics may be applied to the Vdc signal to determine whether the Vdc<br>
value exceeds a predetermined voltage range (e.g., is out-of-range (OOR)<br>
high or OOR low), whether a sensor for measuring the DC bus voltage is<br>
properly operating, or the like. Additionally, layer one diagnostics can<br>
perform a rationality test by correlating the Vdc measurements from different<br>
locations of a battery pack supplying power to the electric motor 102. The<br>
motor torque integrity test performed by the MTM 200 indicates a fault if the<br>
DC bus voltage, represented by the Vdc signal, is not within a pre-determined<br>
range, and thus indirectly secures the Vdc signal.<br>
[0029] The MTM 200 acquires the torque setpoint signal from the HCP<br>
106 (e.g., as established by the hybrid operating strategy). For example, the<br>
MTM 200 reads a torque setpoint from an SPI register and reads a message<br>
rolling-counter associated with the torque setpoint. The torque setpoint may<br>
be established based on a torque command (e.g., produced in response to a<br>
driver input and in accordance with the hybrid operating strategy) to balance<br>
system torque (e.g., for vehicle propulsion). The MTM 200 secures the torque<br>
setpoint, and thus the torque command, by testing SPI communication<br>
between the HCP 106 and the MCP 120. For example, the MTM 200<br>
performs a rolling-count detection to test whether the torque setpoint<br>
corresponds with the updated message. If the message rolling-counter is not<br>
updating appropriately, the MTM 200 transmits a signal indicating a fault<br>
alarm. The checksum determination may also be performed for securing<br>
message transmission, and a time-out fault will be declared if the MCP 120<br>
does not timely receive new SPI messages.<br>
[0030] FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating a motor power test 300.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 1-3, the motor power test 300 secures the motor power<br>
associated with the particular operating mode (e.g., the motoring mode or the<br>
generating mode) of the electric motor 102. A torque command is secured<br>
(e.g., by securing the torque setpoint with the MTM 200), as indicated at 305,<br><br>
and the motor speed is secured (e.g., indirectly via the motor torque integrity<br>
test), as indicated at 310. A motor power is determined (e.g., via the MTM<br>
200) based on the secured torque command and the secured motor speed, as<br>
indicated at 315. The polarity of the motor power, and thus the operating<br>
mode of the electric motor 102, is determined, as indicated at 320. For<br>
example, the motor power is compared with zero. If the motor power is not<br>
greater than zero (e.g., the electric motor is operating in the generating mode),<br>
a supply current (e.g., a DC current (I_dc)) to the electric motor 102 is<br>
compared with a positive calibration threshold ((+)cal_threshold), as indicated<br>
at 325. If the DC current (I_dc) is greater than the positive calibration<br>
threshold, the MTM 200 logs a power check fault and may also transmit a<br>
signal indicating a fault alarm, as indicated at 330. If the DC current (I_dc) is<br>
not greater than the positive calibration threshold, the motor power is secure,<br>
as indicated at 335.<br>
[0031] If the motor power is greater than zero (e.g., the electric motor is<br>
operating in the motoring mode), the DC current (I_dc) is compared with a<br>
negative calibration threshold ((-)cal_threshold), as indicated at 340. If the<br>
DC current (I_dc) is less than the negative calibration threshold, the MTM 200<br>
logs a power check fault and may also transmit a signal indicating a fault<br>
alarm, as indicated at 345. If the DC current (I_dc) is not less than the<br>
negative calibration threshold, the motor power is secure, as indicated at 335.<br>
In one embodiment, the calibration thresholds compensate for the field-<br>
weakening effect at high motor speeds.<br>
[0032] FIG. 4 is block diagram illustrating a motor torque determination<br>
400 in accordance with an exemplary embodiment. Referring to FIGS. 2 and<br>
4, the calculated motor torque of the electric motor 102 is based on<br>
electromagnetic principles, in this embodiment. For example, the MTM 200<br>
calculates a motor torque based on the secured rotor position (e.g., represented<br>
by sin (9) and cos (9)) and the secured current sensor signals. Phase currents<br>
(e.g., ia, ib, and ic associated with the secured current signals supplied to a<br>
three-phase electric motor) 402 and the secured rotor position (e.g., sin(9) and<br>
cos(0)) 404 are obtained by the MTM 200.  The phase currents and secured<br><br>
rotor position may be stored in the memory 202 or in other memory locations.<br>
The MTM 200 transforms these phase currents (ia, ib, and ic) to a two-current<br>
representation (e.g., a d-axis current (id) and a q-axis current (iq)) based on the<br>
secured rotor position (sin(θ) and cos(θ)). The MTM 200 determines flux<br>
linkages (e.g., a d-axis flux linkage (Ψd) and a q-axis flux linkage (Ψq)) based<br>
on this two-current representation (id and iq). In one embodiment, the MTM<br>
200 retrieves the fluxes (Ψd and Ψq) from one or more calibration LUTs (e.g.,<br>
in the memory 202) 406. The motor torque (T1) may then be determined from<br>
the following relationship:<br>
T1 = (3/2) p (Ψd  iq - Ψq  id)	(eq. 2),<br>
where p is the number of pole-pairs of the electric motor.<br>
[0033] FIG. 5 is a flow diagram of a method 500 for monitoring an<br>
achieved motor torque produced by an electric motor in accordance with an<br>
exemplary embodiment. The motor speed of the electric motor is compared<br>
with a pre-determined threshold, as indicated at step 505. Depending on the<br>
motor speed, the achieved motor torque can be determined from either an<br>
electromagnetic torque relationship, such as the motor torque determination<br>
illustrated in FIG. 4, or an estimated torque based on a balance of power<br>
(including compensation for one or more power losses) supplied to the electric<br>
motor. Referring to FIGS. 1, 2 and 5, the MTM 200 determines, for example,<br>
if the motor speed of the electric motor 102 is less than a calibrated low motor<br>
speed threshold (Cal_LowMotorSpeedBreakPoint). This threshold may be<br>
selected based on processor tolerances (e.g., based on division by low speed<br>
values) of the MTM 200 or the MCP 120.<br>
[0034] If the motor speed is less than this threshold, the achieved motor<br>
torque (Tachi) is determined from the electromagnetic torque relationship, as<br>
indicated at step 510. For example, if the motor speed of the electric motor<br>
102 is less than the calibrated low motor speed threshold, the achieved motor<br>
torque (Tachi) is determined to be the motor torque (T1) based on the secured<br>
rotor position (sin(θ) and cos(θ)) and the secured current sensor signals, which<br>
provide the three phase currents (ia, ib, and ic), such as previously discussed in<br><br>
one exemplary embodiment (e.g., the motor torque determination shown in<br>
FIG. 4).<br>
[0035] If the motor speed is not less than this threshold, the achieved<br>
motor torque (Tachi) is determined from the estimated torque (e.g., based on the<br>
power balance and including loss compensation). In one embodiment, the<br>
motor electrical power (Pelec) is determined from a product of the DC bus<br>
voltage (Vdc) and the DC current (Idc), as indicated at step 515. One or more<br>
losses (e.g., motor losses, inverter losses, or the like) of power are<br>
compensated in the motor electrical power (Pelec), as indicated at step 520. For<br>
example, pre-determined or estimated power losses associated with one or<br>
more sources are added to the motor electrical power (Pelec) to produce a<br>
compensated motor electrical power. A motor torque (T2) is determined from<br>
a ratio of the compensated motor electrical power and the motor speed, as<br>
indicated at step 525.<br>
[0036] The motor speed is compared with another threshold, as indicated<br>
at step 530. For example, the MTM 200 determines if the motor speed of the<br>
electric motor 102 is greater than a calibrated high motor speed threshold<br>
(Cal_HighMotorSpeedBreakPoint). If the motor speed is greater than this<br>
threshold, the achieved motor torque is determined to be the motor torque (T2)<br>
as indicated at step 535. If the motor speed is not greater than this threshold,<br>
the achieved motor torque is determined based on an interpolation of the<br>
motor torque (T1) (e.g., based on the secured rotor position (sin(0) and cos(9))<br>
and the secured current sensor signals) and the motor torque (T2) (e.g., based<br>
on the compensated motor electrical power) and the motor speed, as indicated<br>
at step 540.<br>
[0037] After determining the achieved motor torque, the achieved motor<br>
torque is compared with a torque command or requested torque, as indicated at<br>
step 545. For example, the MTM 200 determines if the achieved motor torque<br>
(Tachi) is within a pre-determined margin (e.g., Cal_Threshold*) of the<br>
requested torque. A signal is transmitted (e.g., by the MTM 200), indicating a<br>
fault alarm, if the achieved torque (Tachi) is not within the pre-determined<br>
margin, as indicated at 550.  The achieved motor torque is secure (e.g., Test<br><br>
Pass) if the achieved torque (Tachi) is within the pre-determined margin of the<br>
requested torque, as indicated at 555. The pre-determined margin<br>
(Cal_Threshold*) may also be selected to be motor speed dependent.<br>
[0038] One or more portions of the method 500 may be embodied in a<br>
software program comprising software instructions, instructions sets,<br>
executable modules, or the like, and arranged to run on a processor (e.g., the<br>
MCP 120 or the like) to monitor a motor torque produced by an electric motor<br>
in response to a torque command. The software program when installed and<br>
operating on the processor results in the processor performing or executing<br>
one or more portions of the software program.<br>
