CMS TRAFFIC SYSTEMS LIMITED,<br>
Plot No.155, Sector 2, Millenium Business Park,<br>
Mahape M.I.D. C,<br>
Navi Mumbai-400 701, Maharashtra State, India<br>
An Indian Company registered under the<br>
Provisions of the Companies Act, 1956<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains tfre nature of this<br>
invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -	J M|<br><br>
This invention relates to a wireless system for controlling Road Traffic Signaling system.<br>
Rapid urbanisation has led to increase in no. of vehicles and this has resulted in heavy congestion on the road at all major intersection. A Traffic Signal Controller does the function of providing free and safe passage to each vehicle. To achieve mis Traffic Controllers are installed connected with traffic lights mounted on strategically place poles. The invention relates to making mis connectivity wireless. This is achieved by cost effective methods and to solve this X is ensured mat the maximum number of vehicles are kept moving in a given road network. To achieve this there has to be effective and reliable communications from Traffic Controller installed at individual junctions.<br>
In the present day scenario given the city wide application cost using cable and/or using available PSTN lines is very high and has been the major cost factor for the communication sub system used in Traffic Controller and Management.<br>
One of the cost-effective methods of transmitting data between controllers could be through wireless communication system, considering that the volume of communication is bare minimum. The module being developed can also provide for communication link.<br>
The system envisaged include usage of RF modules interfaced to the controllers. These modules shall operate at frequency approved by relevant authority. The average distances required for mis shall be in the range of 150 - 200mtrs. The RF module shall be transmitting at low power.<br>
-2-<br><br>
The present signaling system uses Traffic Signal Controller interconnected with the signal heads through copper cable. The controller is located at the kerb side and the poles are spread around die junction on all approaching to ensure proper visibility to the road user ITiis necessities kying of inter connecting cable across the carriageway. This can be done either through overhead routing or underground routing.<br>
Standard practice has been to lay the cable underground through ducting across the carriageway and trenching along the kerb side. This activity involves high level of labour and also disruption of Traffic Trenching along the kerb side inconveniences public at large. Also this activity involves obtaining clearances and permission for digging from controlling authorities. The job is time consuming and labour intensive.<br>
Dae to repeated underground activity of several utilities there is high possibility of underground cable getting damaged. The repair of damaged cable again involves permission from authorities and finite time delays. Hie repair activity also involves digging and their by causing inconvenience to public and road user. Also cost of cable is also a consideration. It is object of the present invention to provide wireless system for controlling the road traffic signaling.<br>
The system will consist of one RF Master Controller &amp; several RF Slave Controllers. The number of Slave Controller shall depend on the junction geometry and number of links that the vehicles use. The data / control information flow between the master and slave shall be achieved through RF modules. The RF Slave Controller electronics shall be housed in a proper cabinet, which can be mounted on the same pole as the Traffic lights. One such cabinet shall have arrangements to also house the Master Controller electronics. This can be powered either by DC power or AC maim power. The cabinets described above shall be also including the power dTSÂ¥%l&amp;&amp;bmcs filr the traffic lights. To ensure proper implementation each of this cabinet has capacity to drive 8 signal groups. Each of this signal groups can be designated to control either vehicular / pedestrian traffic<br>
3<br><br>
In case of DC version each of this units shall be powered through independent set of solar panel battery and DC - DC converter. On load side, LED Retrofit will be used as a load.<br>
In case of AC version each of the slave shall have AC version, each Slave will have AC input &amp; its SMPS.<br>
The Master Controller is programmable and shall have complete data related to the timings, group configuration, conflict table, and detector channels among other control parameters. For vehicular group, each group lines are configured as first line green, second line amber &amp; third red. For pedestrian group, same lines are configured as green line for "do cross" lamp, Amber for wait lamps &amp; Red for "don't cross" lamps.<br>
In order to cater for dynamic assignment of timings, detectors are used to sense number of vehicles on the road or register Pedestrian demand to cross the road. To enable this 8 detector channels connections are provided to each slave. Each detector channel can be configured as a vehicle or pedestrian detector. This depends upon the configuration of a group. Thus each detector channel is associated with a group.<br>
The system also provides for sensing of errors, faults. A major fault mat can occur<br>
is related to Conflict at the junction. To enable this a special conflict monitoring data is<br>
available in the Master Controller. The conflict can occur as any two of the three Red,<br>
Amber, and (keen occurring simultaneously.   This is termed as Intra Group Conflict.<br>
. In case of inter group conflict green lights corresponding to conflicting movement-<br>
of vehicle come on simultaneously.   The Conflict Monitoring matrix and associated<br>
circuitry in the system is capable of detecting faults as described above, hi case such a<br>
fault is sensed all the associated Slave Connector shall go into fallback mode.<br>
Note:- Flow-charts &amp; block diagrams are given herewith for more detail or clarity.<br>
