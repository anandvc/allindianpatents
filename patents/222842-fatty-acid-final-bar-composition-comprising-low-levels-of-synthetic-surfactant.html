FATTY ACID SOAP / FATTY ACID BARS WHICH PROCESS AND HAVE GOOD LATHER<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br>
WO 2005/068600<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/014383<br><br>
-   1   -<br>
FATTY ACID SOAP/FATTY ACID BARS "WHICH PROCESS AND HAVE GOOD LATHER<br>
5        The invention relates to predominantly fatty acid soap/free fatty acid bars (i.e. having fatty acid soap and/or fatty acid as base) comprising low levels of synthetic surfactant.-<br>
      Specifically, it relates to bars which can have very  high <br>
10        levels of soap and/or high levels of free fatty acid and which, because of these high levels, one skilled in the art would not previously have believed could be processed and/or foam well.  However, by using a "pure" fatty acid/pure soap stock (i.e., stock with no more than certain amounts of <br>
15        unsaturates and substantially free of lower chain length fatty acids or fatty acid soaps) to make a precursor bar composition before combining with synthetic and other bar components, unexpectedly it is found possible to provide such bars which process and lather well. <br>
20<br>
While fatty acid soap is known to be an efficient, inexpensive cleansing product, it can also be harsh (e.g., non-mild) to the skin.  The short chain (e.g., C14 and below, primarily C12 and below) and unsaturated long chain (e.g.,<br>
25         sodium oleate) soaps, for example, provide good lather and detergency, but can also be harsh and drying.<br>
The applicants have noted that removal of the generally more soluble, harsher components noted above from a soap chain <br>
30         distribution do not generally affect the structuring and the processing properties of a bar (which properties are more<br><br>
WO 2005/068600<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/014383<br><br>
-   2   -<br>
dependent on the less harsh, insoluble, longer chain soaps) but could affect, for example, lather properties.<br>
One major challenge, therefore, is to find a bar which is <br>
5            made from fatty acid soap stock (it should be noted that unsaturated, more soluble soaps such as, for example, oleate, generally are derived from the same source as longer chain, insoluble soaps, i.e., from non-nut oils such as tallow or palm) which stock can be used to make bars which <br>
10          process well, retain good foam properties and which have desirable mildness properties.<br>
The applicants have now found it is possible to create a precursor bar formulation from fatty acids and/or fatty acid <br>
15           soaps having no more than a certain mol % unsaturated chain length components and, of the remaining mol % saturated components, substantially no component of chain length C14 or below (except for residual or artifact components which are extremely difficult to eliminate from the added <br>
20           synthetic surfactant altogether; these may comprise less than about 1 %, preferably less than 0.5 % of the stock and are preferably absent and, in any event, would result in more than 1 % of any Cj.4 or below fatty acid or soap components in the final bar).<br>
 25<br>
The precursor bar, which acts as a kind of matrix for additional components to be blended or mixed into the final bar, can be formed in one of two ways.  First, it can be formed by mixing/blending the unsaturated fatty acid (0 to<br>
30           12.5 mol %), saturated fatty acid of chain length Cis  and up<br><br>
WO 2005/068600<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/014383<br><br>
-   3   -<br>
(50 to 87.5 mol %) and caustic (12.5 to 50 mol % of, for example NaOH or KOH), depending on the extent of desired neutralization in the precursor matrix.  In a further embodiment, it can be formed by mixing pre-formed soap with <br>
5            fatty acid so that no neutralization with caustic   is required.<br>
When a final bar comprising 40 to 88% by wt. fatty acid soap and/or fatty acid (at 50 mol % caustic, assuming it is made<br>
10           by a neutralization method, there is 100 % neutralization and the bar is 100 % soap; at less caustic, there is mixture of soap and fatty acid) of this precursor is blended/mixed with synthetic surfactant, water and filler, unexpectedly it has been found that the bar processes well (e.g. has a<br>
15           firmness of at least 100 kPa using cheese wire measurements) and has exceptionally good lather (bar lather assessment greater than 50 ml by prescribed methodology), as well as desirable potential mildness.<br>
20           Thus, in one embodiment of the invention, a precursor bar/matrix formulation is made by formulating 0 to 12.5 mol % unsaturated fatty acid (e.g., oleic acid); 50 to 87.5 mol % saturated fatty acid of chain length C15 to C24, preferably Cie to C20; and 12.5 to 50 mol % caustic (depending on level<br>
25           of desired neutralization). The key is to form a precursor as "clean" as possible, to the extent is has substantially no soaps or fatty acids (if underneutralized) with chain length C14 or below. When such precursor/matrix is later blended<br>
         with other bar components, it will process well and, even in <br>
30           substantial absence of soluble fatty acid acid/soap (except<br><br>
WO 2005/068600<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/014383<br><br>
- 4  -<br>
for what may be brought in by other bar components other than those firming the precursor) unexpectedly provides excellent foaming.<br>
5  In a second embodiment, the same "clean" precursor is formed but it is formed by blending pre-formed soap and free fatty acid (again with 0-12.5 mol % unsaturates and substantially no chain length components C3.4 and below) without caustic to neutralize.<br>
10<br>
In effect, the applicants have found a bar which can be made from non-nut oils (usually defining a mix of soluble, unsaturated, and insoluble longer chain saturated fatty acids) rather than a mix of tallow and nut oils (where<br>
15  shorter chain saturates are normally found) .<br>
When short chain length soaps (which provide good user properties) are minimized, use of synthetic (e.g., anionic) is one way to make up for the loss in the bar user<br>
20  properties.  According to the subject invention, however, there is minimized both the use of short chain soap/fatty acids and of synthetic surfactants (which may enhance other properties such as foam, but may also be harsh), while maintaining good user properties.<br>

U.S. Patent No. 5,387,362 to Tollens et. al discloses bars<br>
++   +     + containing tailored mixtures of Mg , Na and K ions to react<br>
with lauric acid, select C14-C18 fatty acid and oleic acid.<br>
In the subject invention, lower chain length fatty acid (e.g. 30  lauric) are minimized or substantially absent. Also, Tollens<br><br>

appears to be a pure soap bar composition, while the bars of the subject invention require at least above 7% by wt. synthetic.<br>
5   U.S. Patent No. 5,262,079 to Kacher et al. discloses<br>
     partially neutralizing mono-carboxylic acids to form framed bars with high levels of anionic and nonionic firmness aids. The subject invention minimizes levels of synthetic (less than 25 %, preferably less than 22 %, more preferably 20 % <br>
10   or less) and does not require firmness aids.  It is also an extruded bar. The Kacher bars also must use above 15 % water.<br>
     U.S. Patent No. 6,121,216 to Narath et al. describes <br>
15    enhanced processing by minimizing soap level.  The subject invention does not seek to minimize soap, but to offer beneficial soap blends.<br>
     In a first embodiment the present invention relates to <br>
20   predominantly soap/free fatty acid bars where a precursor bar with no more than a certain level of unsaturated and substantially no fatty acid soaps or free fatty acids of<br>
 chain length C14 or below are used as a base or matrix for<br>
making high soap fatty acid, low synthetic bars which <br>
25    process well and foam remarkably well.  The soap stock used to make the precursor bars is primarily from non-nut oil containing, for example, some soluble, unsaturated (e.g. oleic) and mostly insoluble, longer chain length fatty acids.  By minimizing the level of unsaturates (e.g., oleic <br>
30   acid) and of lower chain saturates, the applicants obtain<br><br>
WO 2005/068600<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/014383<br><br>
-   6<br>
bars that process well, have good lather and are acceptably mild.<br>
Use of low levels of appropriate synthetic surfactant helps <br>
5    assure that desirable properties such as lather and mildness are maintained.  The bars can be made by neutralizing fatty acid with caustic (up to 100 % can be neutralized), or by blending soap and fatty acid prior to surfactant addition.<br>
10  Specifically, in one embodiment, the invention comprises a final bar composition .comprising:<br>
(1)	a precursor bar composition comprising 40 % to 88<br>
% by wt. final bar composition wherein said<br>
precursor is formed within a defined formulation<br>
15	range when the following mol % of components are<br>
mixed:<br>
(a)	0 to 12.5 mol % of unsaturated fatty acid;<br>
(b)	50 % to 87.5 mol % fatty acid having chain length Ci6 or greater, preferably C16-C22; and<br>
20	(c)  12.5 % to 50 mol % caustic,<br>
(2)	7 % to 25 wt. % synthetic surfactant;<br>
(3)	5 % to 15 wt. % water; and<br>
(4)	0 to 20 wt. % filler<br>
wherein said precursor bar composition is substantially free<br>
25  of soap or fatty acid having chain length C±4  or  below; wherein said final bar has substantially no soap or free fatty acid of chain length C3.4 or below except for any which might be brought in by components other than those in the precursor bar composition; and<br><br>
WO 2005/068600<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/014383<br><br>
-   7   -<br>
wherein said final bar composition has lather of at least 50 ml as measured by a standard lather appraisal method (BLAM).<br>
In this first embodiment, the final balance of soap, free<br>
5     fatty acid (if any) and caustic (if any) is determined by how much fatty acid is neutralized by caustic.<br>
In a second embodiment of the invention, the fatty acid soap and fatty acid used to make the precursor are formed by <br>
10    dispersing soap into fatty acid, or visa versa, prior to<br>
 addition of surfactant and other bar ingredients rather than  forming bar precursor by neutralization.<br>
 The invention will be described by way of example only with 15   reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
-	Figure 1 shows a model of the range of mol % amounts (within shaded region) which may be used to form the bar precursor of the invention (when using neutralization embodiment).  The precursor<br>
20    formed is substantially free of soaps/fatty acid of chain length<br>
 C14 and below and, when used to form final bar, will provide a bar<br>
which processes well and has unexpectedly good lather. All values represented on this diagram are in mol %.  The *X" on the caustic axis can for example represent either sodium or<br>
25    potassium.  Representing caustic in the manner allows for water to be considered on the tertiary axis when preparing the soap base.<br>
      The present invention relates to predominantly soap/fatty <br>
30    acid, low synthetic (7 % to 25 % by wt) bar compositions which •surprisingly both process and lather well.  Specifically, by<br><br>
WO 2005/068600<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/014383<br><br>
-   8   -<br>
using a precursor bar composition with a low level of<br>
   unsaturates and substantially no component of chain length C14 and below, it has been found that it is possible to formulate final bars which surprisingly process and lather well. <br>
5<br>
    More specifically, the applicants have modeled a range in which mol % ratios of (1) long chain saturated fatty acid (e.g. palmitic/stearic), (2) unsaturated fatty acids (e.g. oleic); and (3) caustic (e.g. *s (Na20)), when combined, form<br>
10      a matrix (see Figure 1). When other bar ingredients are then mixed/blended with the precursor, a bar of optimal properties is formed.<br>
Bar manufacture was accomplished by heating a mixer to about <br>
15      80 - 90°C, adding the fatty acids (e.g., palmitic/stearic and oleic), followed by addition of the caustic to form precursor (precursor can also be formed by adding preformed soap and fatty acid, if any, without using caustic); and then followed by the addition of surfactant and other bar materials.  The <br>
20      mixture was dried to a target moisture and then cooled.  The cooled material was then extruded via a bench top single screw plodder, made into billets and pressed.  Lab evaluations, including lather volume, were then performed.<br>
25      The mixer employed was a ploughshare mixer and batch<br>
 preparation was as described: melt fatty acids, add caustic, add surfactant, then remove at the targeted moisture level. From the mixer the material was placed on a 3-roll mill in order to be quickly cooled.  The subsequent ribbons were then<br><br>

perfumed and extruded on a 2 stage, single screw Mazonni plodder.<br>
As noted, according to a further embodiment of the <br>
5       invention, fatty acid can be combined with previously formed soap (rather than forming soap via neutralization) prior to combination with synthetic surfactant and other materials.<br>
   More specifically, in an embodiment the final bar 10     compositions of the invention comprise:<br>
(1)	40 %.to 88 % by wt. of a precursor or base bar<br>
composition which can be made either by combining<br>
fatty acid (having maximum amount of unsaturates<br>
and saturates substantially free of chain length<br>
15	C14 and below) and caustic; or by blending<br>
preformed soap and fatty acids (also with maximum a amount of unsaturates and substantially free if<br>
C14 and below) without neutralizing.<br>
(2)	7 % to 25 % by wt. preferably 10 % to 22 % by wt.<br>
20           synthetic surfactant;<br>
(3)	5 % to 15 %, preferably 6  % to 13 % by wt. water, and<br>
(4)	0 to 20 % by wt. filler (e.g., carbohydrates; waxes; emollients; salts such as carbonates,<br>
25	silicates; talc etc);<br>
wherein (1) is substantially free of C14 and below fatty acid soaps and free fatty acids; as is also the final bar except for any C14 and below soaps/free fatty. acids which may be brought in, for example, with synthetic surfactants.<br><br>
WO 2005/068600<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/014383<br><br>
-   10   -<br>
It is preferred, however, that final bar have less than 5 %, preferably less than 3 %, more preferably less than 2 % and most preferably less than 1 % by wt. C14 and below.<br>
5      The final bar also has lather of at least 50ml measured by standard lather appraisal test.<br>
When the precursor is made by neutralization, the mol % of starting reactants which are combined to form desired<br>
10       precursor which is low in unsaturates and substantially free of fatty acid soaps/free fatty acids of chain length Ci4 and below is as follows (see Figure 1) :<br>
(1)	about 12.5 to 50 mol % caustic (50 mol % results in full neutralization); <br>
15       (2)  about 0 to 12.5 mol % unsaturated (e.g. oleic fatty   acid), and<br>
        (3)   about 50 to 87.5 mol % long chain fatty acid of Cig<br>
and above (e.g. palmitic/ stearic)<br>
20       Precursor bars/matrices formed within the preferred region may contain 0 to 65 % by wt. free fatty acid (depending on level of neutralization); high levels of long chain (Ci6 and above) fatty acid; and low levels of unsaturated fatty acid. Using underneutralization, it can be seen that these <br>
25      precursors can be used to form final bars with very high levels (up to 65 %) of free fatty acid.  Historically, superfatted bars contain 5 % to 10 % free fatty acid at most, and even formulation based on synthetic with added<br><br>
30      acid.  Thus, the amount used in the subject invention may  <br>
WO 2005/068600<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/014383<br><br>
-   11   -<br>
far higher than might previously have been believed possible.<br>
  Each of the components in the final bar composition is <br>
5      described in more detail below.<br>
With regard to the base or precursor bar composition, although certain molecules were used in the experimental models, it should be understood that' the molecules used can <br>
10      be broader than those specifically exemplified.<br>
Thus, for example, the unsaturated fatty acid may be oleic, linoleic or elaidic.  The unsaturated fatty acid as noted, can be used at a level of 0 to 12.5 mol % as starting <br>
15      reactant during formation of bar precursor (e.g. when using neutralization methods). Even if blending preformed fatty acid soap and free fatty acid, unsaturates should comprise no more than 12.5 mol % of combined soap/fatty acid.<br>
20     The long chain fatty acid is preferably a C16-C24, more<br>
   preferably Cie to C22r even more preferably C3.6 to C20 fatty acids and mixture thereof and is used in an amount from about 50 to 87.5 mol % of starting fatty acid, if using neutralization or of total soap/fatty acid blend, if not <br>
25     using neutralization.<br>
Finally caustic may be NaOH or KOH or any compound similar to these which will release a group IA metal such as, for example, caustic alcohol (C2H5ONa). The caustic may be used<br>
30     in an amount such that the fatty acid is under-neutralized,<br><br>
WO 2005/068600<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/014383<br><br>
-   12   -<br>
leaving a mixture of fatty acid soap and fatty acid. Generally, this is obtained by using 12.5 to under 50 mol % caustic.  It should be understood that the caustic may fully neutralize fatty acid (e.g., 50 mol %). such that bar has only <br>
5         fatty acid soap.  It is a benefit of the invention, however, to be able to obtain bars with much higher amount of free fatty acid than would normally be able believed to be obtained, thereby providing mildness benefits while still allowing good processing. <br>
10<br>
In another embodiment, a neutralization process need not be used, and the fatty acid may be combined with soap previously made prior to addition of surfactant and other bar materials to bar precursor.<br>
15<br>
The precursor bar may comprise 40 % to 88 % by wt., preferably 50 % to 86 % by wt., more preferably 55 % to 85 % by wt. of final bar (for example, if final bar has 5 % water, 7 % synthetic and no fillers, precursor bar would comprise 88 <br>
20       % of precursor bar composition).<br>
According to the invention, various surfactants can be used to blend/mix with the precursor bar composition.<br>
25       The synthetic surfactants include anionic surfactants,<br>
nonionic surfactants, amphoteric/zwitterionic surfactants, cationic surfactants, etc., such as are well known to the person skilled in the art.  Among the many surfactants which may be used are those described in U.S. Patent No. 3,723,325<br>

 The synthetic surfactant comprises 7 % to 25 % by wt., preferably 10 % to 20 % by wt. of the final bar composition.<br>
25    The final bars if the composition may comprise 5 % to 15 % by wt., preferably 6 % to 13 % water.<br>
Finally, the final bars may contain 0 to 20 % by wt. filler materials which may include anything from carboxylates (e.g.<br>
30    glucose, maltodextrxns) to emollients (glycerin, propylene glycol), salts (e.g. carbonates, sulfates), water, starches<br><br>

         Protocol<br>
    Bar Lather Volume Assessment (BLAM)<br>
5      Principle<br>
To determine the volume of lather which can be generated and collected from a given bar formulation under a strict regiment of washing. <br>
10<br>
    Apparatus<br>
Toilet bars <br>
2 large sinks<br>
15        Measuring funnel<br>
The measuring funnel is constructed by fitting a 26.7 cm (10 H  inch) diameter plastic funnel to a graduated cylinder which has had the bottom cleanly removed.  Minimally the <br>
20        graduated cylinder should be 100 cc's.  The fit between the funnel and the graduated cylinder should be snug and secure.<br>
     Procedure<br>
25        Before evaluations proceed, place the measuring funnel into one of the sinks and fill the sink with water until the 0 cc mark is reached on the graduated cylinder.<br>
i.	Run the faucet in the second sink and set the<br>
30       temperature to 95°F (35°C) .<br><br>
WO 2005/068600<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/014383<br><br>
-   16   -<br>
ii.    Holding the bar between both hands under running water, rotate the bar for ten (10) half turns, iii.    Remove hands and bar from under the running water. <br>
iv.    Rotate the bar fifteen (15) half turns.<br>
5           v.    Lay the bar aside.<br>
vi.    Work up lather for ten (10) seconds,<br>
vii.   Place funnel over hands,<br>
viii.  Lower hands and funnel into the first sink,<br>
ix.    Once hands are fully immersed, slide out from<br>
10                     under funnel.<br>
x.    Lower the funnel to the bottom of the sink, xi.   Read the lather volume, xii.    Remove the funnel with lather from the first sink and rinse in the second sink. <br>
15<br>
The test should be performed on 2 bars of the same formulation, same batch etc. and the volume should be reported as an average of the 2 assessments.<br>
20          Yield Stress Measure<br>
The bars of the invention preferably have yield stress of at least 90 kPa, preferably 100 kPa measured using a cheese wire with a diameter of 0.5 millimeters and having a 200 <br>
25         gram weight attached.<br>
        EXAMPLE 1 - Establishing Prototype Model "<br>
The applicants sought to design a model soap base (defining <br>
30          ternary structuring system of the invention) to which additional surfactants could be added.  The idea was to<br><br>
WO 2005/068600<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/014383<br><br>
-   17   -<br>
define a combination (or range) of long chain saturated to unsaturated soaps that could be acceptable to act as soap bases to which other surfactants could be formulated into. Having at least some free fatty acid was desirable to impart <br>
5       mildness.<br>
Using phase factors, the applicants established a model where the axes are scaled as mol %.<br>
10     In general the following observation was made with regard to level of caustic used and resulting levels of soap and fatty acids:<br>
(1)	using 50 mol % caustic results in full<br>
15	neutralization (all soap and no free fatty acid) ;<br>
(2)	37.5 mol % caustic results in 3:2 ratio of soap to fatty acid;<br>
(3)	25 mol % caustic results in 1:2 ratio of soap to fatty acid; and<br>
20         (4)     12.5 mol % caustic results in 1:6 ratio of soap to fatty acid.<br>
    EXAMPLE 2 - Bar Preparation<br>
25       The mixer used in the preparation of the bar was a<br>
ploughshare mixer and a batch preparation was used.  The procedure was to melt fatty acids (i.e., at temperature of about 65 to 105°C), add caustic (to neutralize some or all free fatty acid), add surfactant, and remove at desired<br>
30      moisture.  From the mixer, material was placed on 3-roll mill<br><br>
WO 2005/068600<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/014383<br><br>
-   18   -<br>
to quickly cool.     Subsequent ribbons were extruded on a two-stage,   single screw Mazzoni plodder.<br>
                          EXAMPLES  3-30 <br>
5<br>
Examples 3-30 below are all examples within scope of the invention wherein saturated longer chain length soaps/fatty acid are maximized; saturated, lower length soaps/fatty acids are minimized or absent, and level of unsaturates is always<br>
10         below a maximum mol % of fatty acid/caustic mixture (e.g. prior to saponification) .  Examples 3-30 are prepared via neutralization by caustic; Example 31 is prepared by adding soap into fatty acid before surfactant addition rather than by neutralization.<br>
15<br>
It will be noted that the bars process well (e.g., yield stress of at least 90, preferably at least 100 kPa as measured by cheese  wire method defined in protocol) and have foam value of about 50 or more, preferably above 50, more<br>
20          preferably above 60.<br>
It should be noted that a typical 82/18 soap bar lathers at a range of about 50-60 mol and Dove (C) lathers in a range of about 110-120 mol when measured by same method. <br>

10            This example shows soap/fatty acid for where large chain is 75 % (molar ratio), unsaturates are absent, and fatty acid is underneutralized (25 % NaOH).  As seen, where long chain are maximized and both short chain and unsaturated minimized or absent, we obtain hard bars (processable) with good foaming.<br><br>
