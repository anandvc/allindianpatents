				<td>METHODS FOR PREPARING 1,1,TRIS(4-HYDROXYPHENYL)ALKANES BACKGROUND<br>
The present disclosure generally relates to a method for preparing l,l,l-tris(4-hydroxyphenyl)alkanes.<br>
The l,l,l-tris(4-hydroxyphenyl)alkanes, such as, for example, those disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,579,542 and 4,992,598, can be used as branching agents during the polymerization of polycarbonates. As such, it may be incorporated into reaction mixtures containing dihydroxy aromatic compounds such as bisphenol A and carbonate sources such as phosgene or diphenyl carbonate, among others.<br>
An exemplary l,l,l-tris(4-hydroxyphenyl)alkane, l,l,l,-tris(4-hydroxphenyl)ethane (also referred to as THPE), can generally be prepared by the reaction of 4-hydroxyacetophenone with phenol. The reaction is analogous to the well known reaction of phenol with acetone to form 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane (also commonly referred to as "bisphenol A"). U.S. Patent No. 5,756,781 discloses reacting "phenol and 4-hydroyxacetophenone" in the presence of effective amounts of an ion exchange catalyst and a mercaptan as a co-promoter such that the resulting l,l,l-tris(4'-hydroxyphenyl)ethane is substantially free of various reaction impurities.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,756,859 discloses reacting "phenol and 2,4- pentanedione under acidic conditions and in the presence of an effective amount of mercapto compound as promoter." This patent further states that "[t]he acidic conditions may be provided by the addition of any acidic material, especially a relatively volatile material such as hydrogen chloride." The patent next states that "[t]ypically, hydrogen chloride gas is passed through the mixture during the reaction."<br>
Among the disadvantages to this method are that the quantity of catalyst used is relatively high and the volatile acids employed, e.g., hydrogen chloride gas, are generally corrosive. Other methods include the use of sulfuric acid in conjunction with 3-mercaptosulfonic acid as the promoter.<br>
Accordingly, there remains a need in the art of efficient methods for preparing 1,1,1-tris(4-hydroxyphenyl)alkanes in high yields.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY<br>
Disclosed herein is a method for producing l,l,l-tris(4-hydroxyphenyl)alkanes. The method comprises reacting a mixture of an aromatic hydroxy compound and a ketone in the presence of at least one ion exchange resin catalyst and optionally a co-catalyst to produce the 1,1,1 -tris(4-hydroxyphenyl)alkane.<br>
In one embodiment is provided a method for producing l,l,l-tris(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethane. The method comprises reacting a mixture of phenol and 2,4-pentanedione in the presence of at least one ion exchange resin catalyst and optionally a co-catalyst to form the l,l,l-tris(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethane.<br>
The above-described method may be understood more readily by reference to the following detailed description of the various features of the disclosure and the examples included therein.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The present disclosure may be understood more readily by reference to the following detailed description of preferred embodiments of the disclosure and the examples included therein. In the following specification and the claims that follow, reference will be made to a number of terms that shall be defined to have the following meanings.<br>
The singular forms "a", "an" and "the" include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.<br>
"Optional" or "optionally" means that the subsequently described event or circumstance may or may not occur, and that the description includes instances where the event occurs and instances where it does not.<br>
The modifier "about" used in connection with a quantity is inclusive of the stated value and has the meaning dictated by the context (e.g., includes the degree of error associated with measurement of the particular quantity).<br>
As used herein the term "aliphatic radical" refers to a radical having a valence of at least one comprising a linear or branched array of atoms, wherein the array of atoms is not cyclic. The array may include heteroatoms such as nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, silicon, and phosphorous, or may be composed exclusively of carbon and hydrogen. Examples of suitable aliphatic radicals include methyl, methylene, ethyl, ethylene, hexyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, tertiary-butyl, pentyl, neopentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl, dodecyl, hexamethylene, trifluorornethyl, trifluoroethyl, methoxy, ethyioxy, oxyethyleneoxy (O(CH2)2O), trimethylsilyl, mixtures thereof, and the like. The aliphatic radicals may be substituted or unsubstituted and may comprise one or more substituents including amino groups, halogen atoms, cyano groups, nitro groups, hydroxyl groups, mercapto groups, C1-C10 alkyl groups,  C1-C10  alkoxy groups, C1-C10 alkoxycarbonyl groups, C1-C10 alkylthio groups,  C1-C10  alkylamino groups, and the like.<br>

The reaction of the aromatic hydroxy compound with the ketone can be achieved either in a batch mode or in a continuous mode. Typically, when the reaction is carried out in a batch mode the aromatic hydroxy compound, the ketone, the optional co-catalyst and the ion exchange resin catalyst are mixed and the reaction temperature is maintained at about 30°C to about 120°C, and more specifically at about 40°C to about 100°C. In one embodiment, the reaction temperature is at about 55°C to about 75°C. The temperature of the reaction can be measured by using thermocouples inserted into the mixture or by measuring the temperature of the external heating media, for example, measuring the temperature of the oil bath. In one embodiment, the ketone is added drop-wise to a mixture of the aromatic hydroxy compound, the<br><br>
optional co-catalyst, and the ion exchange resin catalyst. The time taken for the reaction of the aromatic hydrhooxy compound and the ketone in a batch mode varies from about 5 hours to about SO urs.

In the continuous mode, a mixture of the aromatic hydroxy compound, the ketone, and the optional co-catalyst is passed through a reactor comprising a fixed bed of the ion exchange resin catalyst. The mixture is maintained at a temperature wherein the reactants remain in a liquid state. Typically, the mixture is maintained at a temperature of about 40°C to about 65°C, and more specifically at a temperature of about 4S°C to about 65°C. In one embodiment, the mixture is maintained at about 50°C to about 60°C. The reactor bed is maintained at a temperature at which the aromatic hydroxy compound reacts with the ketone to provide a l,l,l-tris(4-hydroxyphenyl)alkane product. The temperature may be maintained using oil circulators. The temperature of the oil may be measured using thermocouples inserted in the oil circulator. Typically, the temperature is maintained at about 30°C to about 120°C and more specifically at about 40°C to about 100°C. In one embodiment, the temperature in the bed is maintained at about 55°C to about 75°C.<br>
The weighted hourly space velocity (hereinafter referred to as WHSV) at which the mixture of the aromatic hydroxy compound, the ketone and the optional co-catalyst are fed in a continuous reaction mode varies from about 0.2 to about 5 and more specifically from about 0.3 to about 3. In one embodiment, the WHSV of the mixture of the aromatic hydroxy compound, the ketone and the optional co-catalyst varies from about 0.5 to about 1.<br>
Optionally, the reaction may be carried out in an inert atmosphere such as in the presence of nitrogen, helium or argon.<br>
Any acidic ton exchange resin is used in the reaction of the aromatic hydroxy compound and the ketone. As used herein the term "acidic ion exchange resin" refers to a cation exchange resin in the hydrogen form, wherein the hydrogen ions are bound<br>
to the active sites. The hydrogen ions can be removed either by dissociation in solution or by replacement with other positive ions. The active sites of the resin have different attractive strengths for different ions, and this selective attraction serves as a means for ion exchange. Non-limiting examples of suitable acidic ion exchange resins include the series of sulfonated divinylbenzene-crosslinked styrene copolymers, such as for example, copolymers crosslinked with about 1 to about 20 weight percent of divinylbenzene relative to the overall weight of the acidic ion-exchange resin. More specifically, suitab le catalysts include acidic ion exchange resins crosslinked with lower than or equal toabout 8 weight percent of divinylbenzene relative to the overall weight of the acidic ion exchange resin catalyst. In one embodiment, suitable catalysts include acidic ion exchange resins crosslinked with greater than or equal to about 2 weight percent of divinylbenzene relative to the overall weight of the acidic ion exchange resin catalyst.<br>

The optional co-catalyst is generally selected from the group consisting of a mercaptan compound, a hydroxy benzene compound, and a hydroxy naphthalene compound.<br>
Typically, the mercaptan compound comprises a compound of Formula (IV): <br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein A is a monovalent or divalent aliphatic radical, aromatic radical or cycloaliphatic radical,; 82 is selected from the group consisting of an hydrogen, a<br>
hydroxyl, -S-H, -S-R3, -COOR4 and SO3R4; and BI is selected from the group consisting of -S-H, -S-R3, -SCOOR4 and SCOR4, wherein R3 is a tertiary alkyl group having 4 to 25 carbon atoms and R4 is selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen, an aliphatic group having 1 to 12 carbon atoms, cycloaliphatic group having 3 to 12 carbon atoms, an aromatic group having 3 to 12 carbon atoms, and m is an integer having a value 0 or 1.<br>
Optionally, the mercaptan co-catalyst can be employed in salt form. If the co-catalyst employed is in the salt form, the salt gets converted to the free acid of the co-catalyst in situ when it comes in contact with the ion exchange resin catalyst. For example, a sodium salt of 3-mercaptopropane sulfonic acid can be converted to 3-mercaptporopane sulfonic acid upon contact with the acid catalyst.<br>
Non-limiting examples of suitable mercaptan co-catalysts include 3-<br>
mercaptopropionic acid (hereinafter called 3-MPA), a substituted or an unsubstituted<br>
benzyl mercaptan, 3-rcmeapto-l-propanol, ethyl 3-mercaptopropionate, 1,4-<br>
bis(mercaptomethyl)benzene,	2-mercaptoethane-sulfonic	acid,	3-<br>

In one embodiment, 3-mercaptopropane sulfonic acid can be utilized because of its commercial availability and low cost, among others.<br>
Non-limiting examples of suitable hydroxybenzene and hydroxy naphthalene compounds include resorcinol, catechol, hydroquinone. and the mono- and di-methyl and mono- and di-ethyl ethers thereof, para-ethyl phenol, ortho-cres ol,para-cresol, phloroglucinol, alpha-naphthol, 5-methyl-alpha-naphthol, 6-isobutyl-alpha-naphthol, 1,4-dihydroxynaphthalene, 6-hexyl-l,4-dihydroxy naphthalene and 6-methyl-4-methoxy-alpha-naphthalene.<br>
Typically, when the co-catalyst is employed in the reaction, the amount used varies from about 0.01 weight percent to about 10 weight percent based on total weight of the reaction mixture. In other embodiments, the quantity of co-catalyst employed is 0.05 weight percent to 5 weight percent based on total weight of the reaction mixture. In still other embodiments, the quantity of co-catalyst employed is 0.7S weight percent to 3 weight percent based on total weight of the reaction mixture.<br>
The reaction mixture so-obtained may then be contacted with a solvent to precipitate a solid material, e.g., the l,l,l-tris(4-hydroxyphenyl)alkane. The solvent used for the precipitation can be, but is not limited to, chlorinated solvents, toluene, xylene or mixtures of the foregoing solvents thereof. Non-limiting examples of suitable chlorinated solvents include methylene chloride, ethylene dichloride, dichlorobenzene and chlorobenzene. In one embodiment, the solvent used is ethylene dichloride. Generally, the amount of solvent used comprises a volume ratio to the reaction mixture of at least 2:1, more specifically the volume ratio is 2.5:1, and most specifically the volume ratio is 3:1. More solvent may be used, but this may lead to a decrease in the yields of l,l,l-tris(4-hydroxyphenyl)alkane. The pale yellowish brown solid material that precipitates contains at least 90% by weight of the particular 1,1,1 -tris (4-hydrox yphenyl)alkane.<br>
The solid material comprising 1,1,1-tris (4-hydroxyphenyl)alkane so-obtained may then be subjected to different purification techniques. Typically, when THPE is prepared using the above disclosed process, the solid material comprises THPE, bisphenol-A (hereinafter referred to as BPA) and phenol. In one embodiment the solid material may subsequently be contacted with a methanol-water mixture containing at least 20% methanol by volume for 0.5 to 2 hours. In one embodiment, the proportion of methanol in the methanol-water mixture is of the order of 20-40% by volume. The solid material may then be further refluxed hi a mixture comprising an alcohol containing a decolorizing agent. Suitable decolorizing agents include, but are not intended to be limited to, alkali metal borohydrides, alkali metal dithionites, activated charcoal, combinations comprising at least one of the foregoing decolorizers, and the like. Suitable alcohols comprise straight chain or branched or cyclic aliphatic alcohols containing from 1 to 8 carbon atoms. Non-limiting examples<br>
of suitable aliphatic alcohols include methanol, ethanol, iso-propanol, iso-butanol, n-butanol, tertiary-butanol, n-pentanol, iso-pentanol, mixtures of at least one of the foregoing aliphatic alcohols, and the like. The mixture may optionally be treated with activated charcoal to achieve further decolorization if desired. The mixture can then be treated with water, optionally containing the decolorizing agent, to precipitate a visually colorless l,l,l-tris(4-hydroxyphenyl)alkane, for example.<br>
In   one   other   embodiment,   the   solid   material   comprising   1,1,1-tris   (4-hydroxyphenyl)alkane may be purified by employing an adduct crystallization technique,  in this purification method, for example, when THPE is being purified, THPE is mixed with BPA or phenol or a mixture of BPA and phenol and this mixture is heated to a temperature such that a homogenous solution is obtained. Typically, the temperature required to achieve the homogenous solution varies from about 50°C to about 180°C, and more specifically, from about 100°C to about 140°C.   In one embodiment, the temperature varies from about 120°C to about 130°C.   The time taken to obtain the homogenous solutions varies from about 10 minutes to about 3 hrs and more specifically from about 0.5 hours to about 2 hours. In one embodiment the time is Ihr. The system is maintained in the homogenous molten state for another 0.5 hours to about 3 hours to ensure the formation of a uniform homogeneous mixture before being cooled down.  Subsequently, the temperature is decreased at a rate of about !°C per minute to about 10°C minute, and more specifically, at 1°C per minute. Solid THPE precipitates out at about 50°C to about 150°C, and more specifically, at about 100°C to about 140°C.   In one embodiment, the solid precipitates at about 120°C to about 130°C. The system is then left untouched for about 1 hour to about 15 hours to obtain complete precipitation of the solids. The solids are then filtered and dried.     The solids  so obtained are analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography (hereinafter referred to as HPLC) technique. In one embodiment, the reaction mixture before being contacted with the solvent to precipitate the 1,1,1-tris (4-hydroxvphenyl)alkane can be directly subjected to the adduct formation process described above.<br>
For example, when THPE is purified using the adduct purification method, the THPE-BPA-phenol or THPE-BPA or THPE-phenoI adduct so formed may then be subjected<br>
to a desorption step to obtain about 95% pure THPE. The adduct is first washed with a solvent and then subjected to a methanol-water crystallization step. The solvent used for desorption includes, but is not limited to, chlorinated solvents, toluene, xylene or mixtures of the foregoing solvents thereof. Non-limiting examples of suitable chlorinated solvents include mefhylene chloride, ethylene dichloride, dichlorobenzcne and chlorobenzene. In one embodiment, the solvent used is toluene. Generally, the amount of solvent used comprises a volume ratio to the reaction mixture of at least 2:1, more specifically the volume ratio is 2.5:1, and most specifically the volume ratio is 3:1. More solvent may be used, but this may lead to a decrease in the yields of l,l,l-tris(4-hydroxyphenyl)alkane. For the methanol-water crystallization step, the adduct may be contacted with a methanol-water mixture containing at least 20% methanol by volume for 0.5 to 2 hours. In one embodiment, the proportion of methanol in the methanol-water mixture is on the order of 20-40% by volume. In one embodiment the desorption may also be carried out by subjecting the THPE adduct melt to distillation to strip off phenol.<br>
In one embodiment, the ion exchange resin catalyst may be reused for subsequent reactions. For example, in a batch mode reaction, the catalyst may be filtered off and reused in the next batch reaction. In the continuous mode, the fixed bed reactor may be subjected to multiple passes of the reactants for a number of hours. Unreacted phenol and ketone may be recovered and reused in the process. Both the above described purification techniques result in effluent comprising l,l,l-tris(4-hydroxyphenyl)alkane. This effluent may also be recycled in the reaction.<br>
As previously discussed, the l,l,l-tris(4-hydroxyphenyl)alkanes obtained herein can be used as branching agents such as may be desired for producing - branched polycarbonates. For example, THPE can be added to the reactants used during polymerization. The desired theological effects of branching provide higher viscosities and higher melt strengths relative to an otherwise similar resin prepared without using THPE. Branched polycarbonates derived from l,l,l-tris(4-hydroxyphenyl)alkane are suitable for use as films or sheets. The branched polycarbonates can also be blow molded to prepare structured containers.<br>
A number of polymerization methods can be used for producing the branched polycarbonates, comprising the l,l,l-tris(4-hydroxyphenyl)alkanes. Suitable methods for fabricating these polycarbonates, for example, include a melt transesterification polymerization method and an interfacial polymerization method.<br>
The melt transesterification polymerization method is generally carried out by combining a catalyst (e.g., quaternary phosphonium salts or sodium hydroxide or tetraalkyiammonium salts) and a reactant composition to form a reaction mixture. Next the reaction mixture is mixed under sufficient pressure and temperature conditions for a time period effective to produce a branched polycarbonate. The resultant product mixture generally comprises a carbonic acid diester of the formula (ZO)2C=O, wherein each Z is independently an unsubstituted or a substituted alkyl radical, or an unsubstituted or a substituted aryl radical and the l,l,l-tris(4-hydroxyphenyl)alkane.<br>
In the interfacial polymerization method, l,l,l-tris(4-hydroxyphenyl)alkane, one or more co-monomers, and phosgene are reacted in the presence of an acid acceptor and an aqueous base to produce a polycarbonate. Tertiary amines, such as for example, trialkylamines are preferably used as acid acceptors. An exemplary trialkylamine is triethylamine. Suitable aqueous bases include, for example, the alkali metal hydroxides, such as sodium hydroxide.<br>
The following examples fall within the scope of, and serve to exemplify, the more generally described methods set forth above. The examples are presented for illustrative purposes only, and are not intended to limit the scope of the disclosure.<br>
In the following examples, a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) technique was used to quantify the conversion of the aromatic hydroxy compound of Formula (II) and the ketone of Formula (HI) to the particular l,l,l-tris(4-hydroxyphenyl)alkane. The HPLC was initially calibrated using standard samples of the aromatic hydroxy compound, the ketone, the l,l,l-uis(4-hydroxyphenyl)alkane, and the bisphenol. The standard samples were diluted with acctonitrile and injected into a Zorbax XDB, C8 5µ reverse phase column commercially available from<br>
Agilent Technologies. The reaction mixture was withdrawn at regular time intervals, diluted with acetonitrile and injected to the HPLC column and compared to the HPLC chromatogram of the standard samples to follow the formation of l,l,l-tris(4-hydroxyphenyl) alkane in the reaction.<br>
The color value of the l,l,l-tris(4-hydroxyphenyl)alkanes prepared by following the methods of this disclosure preferably have a percentage transmission at the corresponding wavelengths in nanometers (run) as indicated in Table 1 below<br>

Example 1: This example provides the preparation of THPE using 2,4-pentanedione (PD), phenol, 3-mercapto propane sulfonic acid (3-MPSA) in a batch mode.<br>
In a 1 liter 4-necked round bottom flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer pocket, and a water-cooled reflux condenser with a calcium chloride guard and an air leak tube was charged phenol (306 grains (g)), IER A-121 (2% crosslink; 23 g) and 3-MPSA sodium salt (6.62 g). The flask was immersed in an oil bath and the oil bath was maintained at 40°C. PD (25 g) was added drop-wise to the reaction mixture over a period of 10 minutes under stirring. The temperature of the oil bath was then raised to 75°C when the reaction mixture turned red in color due to the dissolution of the 3-MPSA solids. The stirring was continued for about another 22 hours and this resulted in a thick red colored slurry. The slurry was then filtered and the filtrate was poured into a 2 liter conical flask and diluted with 1,150 milliliters (ml) of ethylene dichloride and stirred for about another 3 hours at room temperature (i.e., 25°C). The precipitated THPE solids were filtered and washed with about 150<br>
ml of ethylene dichloride till a colorless filtrate was obtained. The solids were again washed with about 200 ml of water.<br>
The purification process included stirring the crude reaction product into a methanol-water mixture (40:60 volume by volume, ISO ml) for 0.5 hours. Next the solids were filtered off, dried. The solids so obtained were then dissolved in methanol (62 ml). Sodium borohydride (NaBH4 5O milligrams (mg)) was added to this mixture, followed by stirring for half an hour, to provide a pale yellow colored solution. To this solution was then added 124 ml. deionized water containing NaBR4 SO mg dropwise in about an hour, and the mixture was stirred for another hour. Colorless solids precipitated out which was filtered and washed with water (ISO ml.) and dried. The solids were dried at 60°C under vacuum to constant weight. The color value of the l,l,l-tris(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethane prepared above was found to have acceptable percentage transmission (%T) at the corresponding wavelengths as indicated in Table 2 below.<br>

The color values were analyzed spectrophotometrically by weighing 2.S grams of the particular l,l,l-tris(4-hydroxyphenyl)alkane in a 30 miliiliters vial and dissolving the sample in 5 grams of methanol. The percentage transmission was then measured using this solution in a UV-visible spectrophotometer in the range of 300 nm to 750<br>
nm.<br>
Examples 2-7. These examples provide a method for the preparation of THPE as generally outlined in Example 1. Examples 2-5 employed 3-MPSA as the co-catalyst<br>

Example 11: In this example, THPE was purified by forming the adduct. In a 500 ml round bottom flask, THPE (15.37 g), BPA (11.4 g) and phenol (37.64 g) (THPE:BPA:phenol:: 1:1:8) were taken and heated to about 150°C in an hour to obtain a homogenous solution. The heating was continued for another 1 hour and then the temperature was decreased at a rate of about 1°C per minute, when the solids precipitated out at about 126°C. The mixture was then allowed to stand for another 20 minutes and then filtered. The product obtained was analyzed using HPLC and indicated 60,61 weight percent (wt. %) THPE, 10.71 wt. % BPA and 28.66 wt. % phenol.<br>
Examples 12-20. In these examples, THPE adduct was prepared using the method described in Example 6 above.
