				<td>Description	<br>
The invention relates to a process for the continuous<br>
production of polymers, in particular of condensates<br>
and preferably polyester polymers, from the starting<br>
materials for the monomer or monomers and their<br>
conversion into the polymers in a single reactor having<br>
a plurality of reaction zones and a reactor in cascade<br>
form whose last chamber is configured as an annular<br>
disk reactor or disk-cage reactor.<br>
The use of a plurality of horizontal and vertical<br>
reactors with or without built-in stirrers or mixing<br>
devices for carrying out continuously operated poly-<br>
merizations is known. In all these processes, the<br>
reactors are operated under different operating<br>
conditions which differ in terms of pressure and<br>
temperature. The reactors are connected by double-<br>
walled pipes which are heated. The<br><br>
transport of the product between the various reactors is generally effected by<br>
means of pumps or by means of the different operating pressure.<br>
US Patent No. 6,096,838 discloses an apparatus for polycondensation that<br>
can produce polyester of the desired quality efficiently, with a minimum of<br>
energy and minimizing the necessary reactor structure and arrangement.<br>
The large number of reactors and connecting elements make the plants very<br>
large, require multistory buildings having a large area, elaborate construction<br>
measures and therefore make the plants very expensive.<br>
An annular disk reactor in which the conversion of prepolymers into<br>
polymers by condensation is carried out is likewise known from US patent<br>
3,761,059. This annular disk reactor is used as a horizontal reactor. This<br>
reactor has the advantage that it is only partly filled with product. The<br>
product to be reacted is lifted from, the bottom by means of the annular disks<br>
and is conveyed in thin layers into the vapor space and flows downward with<br>
continual renewal of the product surface.<br><br>
As a result of the formation of the thin layers, the volatile components in the<br>
polymer can easily escape and the ;reaction process can be influenced in an<br>
advantageous manner. Although the stirring device is not continually<br>
located below the level of the product, it is continually wetted and is<br>
repeatedly rinsed and washed by the product.<br>
However, a disadvantage of these annular disk reactors or disk-cage reactors<br>
is that they operate effectively only above a particular product viscosity. If<br>
the viscosity is too low, the product does not remain on the annular disks, so<br>
that it is not transported into the gas space and sufficient films cannot be<br>
formed. Instead the annular disks only cut like knives through water.<br>
It is an object of the invention to device a process and a reactor for the<br>
continuous product of polymers	<br><br>
which can be realized in a simple manner without high<br>
plant costs and an apparatus for carrying out the<br>
process.<br>
According to the invention, the polymer is produced by<br>
conversion of the starting materials into monomer or<br>
monomers, further conversion into prepolymers and on<br>
into the polymers in a single vertical reactor which is<br>
divided into at least two, superposed reaction zones of<br>
which at least one zone comprises an annular disk<br>
reactor and/or a disk-cage reactor.<br>
In a particular embodiment of the process, an end<br>
reactor for the further polymerization is installed<br>
downstream. This downstream end reactor is advanta-<br>
geously an annular disk reactor or a disk-cage reactor.<br>
In place of an end reactor, it is also possible for an<br>
SSP (solid state polycondensation) to be provided<br>
downstream.<br>
In the process of the invention, the starting materials<br>
for the production of the monomers are mixed with one<br>
another in appropriate ratios outside the vertical<br>
reactor and are then introduced at the top into the<br>
uppermost reaction stage. It is also possible to<br>
introduce the starting materials separately into the<br>
first reaction zone. Here, the conversion into the<br>
desired monomers occurs. The monomers are taken off<br>
continuously and conveyed via lines, which may be<br>
located within or outside the reactor, to the reaction<br>
zone located underneath.<br>
The vapors and gases formed in the production of<br>
monomers or prepolymer can be conveyed from one<br>
reaction stage to another reaction stage via connecting<br>
lines between the reaction stages and can subsequently<br>
be discharged.<br><br>
Of course, the vapors formed in the respective reaction<br>
can also be discharged individually from each reaction<br>
zone.<br>
To achieve better mixing and acceleration of the<br>
reaction, a stirrer can be provided in the first<br>
reaction zone of the vertical reactor. Here, the<br>
stirrer can be located centrally or eccentrically. The<br>
stirrer itself can be mounted at one or both ends.<br>
The reaction can be carried out under superatmospheric,<br>
subatmospheric or atmospheric pressure and the reaction<br>
mixture can be cooled and heated in the desired way.<br>
Cooling or heating is achieved by means of a jacket<br>
installed on the outer surface of the reactor and/or<br>
installed heat exchanger elements through which cooling<br>
or heating media (gaseous or liquid) can flow.<br>
As indicated above, the reaction product from the first<br>
reaction zone is transferred via lines which can be<br>
located within or outside the reactor into the second<br>
reaction zone and is there converted into prepolymers<br>
having the desired degree of polymerization or desired<br>
viscosity. The low-boiling condensation products given<br>
off as gases or vapors result in sufficient circulation<br>
of the product, so that a product which is sufficiently<br>
uniform in terms of its viscosity is obtained and is<br>
taken off at the lower end of the second reaction zone.<br>
In this reaction zone, too, the course of the reaction<br>
can be influenced in a desired manner by means of<br>
superatmospheric or subatmospheric pressure. Likewise,<br>
a jacket on the exterior circumference of the reactor<br>
or built-in heat exchanger elements through which<br>
cooling or heating media can be passed is/are also<br>
provided here.<br><br>
In a particular embodiment, the second reaction zone is<br>
divided by dividing walls so that the medium is forced<br>
to follow a predetermined route. For example, the<br>
medium is conveyed in a spiral from the outside inward<br>
or in the reverse direction and then downward to flow<br>
out into the third reaction zone.<br>
The reaction product is introduced into the third<br>
reaction zone via lines at one or more points on the<br>
outer edge of the reactor. In a particular embodiment,<br>
the product from the second reaction zone is heated to<br>
a higher temperature outside the reactor before it<br>
enters the third reaction zone. In addition, the<br>
reactor is surrounded by a jacket or provided with<br>
internal heat exchangers which can serve for the<br>
introduction of heating media or cooling media in the<br>
third reaction zone, too.<br>
In the third reaction zone, the conversion of the<br>
prepolymer into the desired polymer occurs. The<br>
products having relatively low boiling points formed in<br>
the reaction are discharged at the top of the third<br>
reaction zone and are processed further outside the<br>
reactor.<br>
Devices which reduce the carry-over of product<br>
particles into the downstream condensers are provided<br>
in the upper part of each reaction stage.<br>
According to the invention, the third reaction zone is<br>
configured as an annular disk reactor or disk-cage<br>
reactor. To fit the annular disk reactor or disk-cage<br>
reactor known per se to the hemispherical shape of the<br>
reactor of the invention, the stirring elements<br>
installed on the stirring or transport device have<br>
differing diameters. They increase from the wall of the<br>
reactor to the middle.<br><br>
To achieve even better and more uniform condensation,<br>
dividing walls and/or overflows are provided in the<br>
third reaction zone in the hemisphere. Thus, the entire<br>
third reaction zone is divided into a plurality of<br>
small reaction stages, with material flow occurring<br>
from the outside inward. The material flow is<br>
determined by the throughput and the rotational speed<br>
of the stirring and transport device. As the stirring<br>
elements move, the material taken up by them flows back<br>
into the same chamber. The product flows from chamber<br>
to chamber over the weirs.<br>
To achieve complete emptying of the chambers formed by<br>
the dividing walls and/or overflows, drain holes or<br>
other drainage facilities are provided at the lowest<br>
point in the walls.<br>
Should the viscosity of the melt in the outer small<br>
reaction stages still be so low that the melt does not<br>
adhere sufficiently to the stirring elements, the<br>
transport of the material to the surface occurs by<br>
means of scooping elements installed on the shaft or<br>
the support frame or on the disks or stirring elements.<br>
The diameter of the individual stirring elements, for<br>
example annular disks, is so large that only a small gap<br>
remains between the wall of the reactor and the outer<br>
edge of the stirring elements.<br>
The level of the reaction medium in the individual small<br>
reaction stages is determined by the height of the<br>
overflows.<br>
The stirring elements of the stirring devices are<br>
installed on the latter so that the center point of<br>
the stirring elements lies on the axis of rotation of<br>
the stirring devices. This ensures that each stirring<br>
element performs a symmetrical motion when it rotates<br>
about the axis of the stirring devices.<br><br>
An advantage is that material which adheres to and is<br>
therefore lifted by the stirring elements is renewed on<br>
each rotation without the stirring and transport device<br>
being adversely affected. All parts dipping into the<br>
fluid material are wetted during one full rotation when<br>
the level is appropriate.<br>
Parts of the stirring element surfaces which are not<br>
wetted by dipping into the fluid are gradually covered<br>
by a film of the material adhering to the wetted areas<br>
during the rotational motion. These films then travel,<br>
like the adhering material in the case of complete<br>
wetting of the stirring element surfaces, to the inner<br>
edge of the surface and fall as a film into the fluid<br>
material.<br>
When annular disks are used, the stirring elements can<br>
advantageously be constructed so that the annular areas<br>
of the annular disks are perforated or slotted.<br>
Embodiments in which the perforated or slotted annular<br>
disks are provided with openings which are larger the<br>
higher the viscosity are particularly advantageous. In<br>
this way, a viscosity which changes during the process<br>
can be taken into account in a simple way for an<br>
optimal process.<br>
An arrangement of the stirring elements with different<br>
distances between them, namely becoming smaller or<br>
larger from the outside to the inside, is likewise<br>
advantageous for the same purpose. The distances<br>
between the individual separation or overflow elements<br>
can also be chosen freely depending on the desired<br>
course of the reaction. The arrangement of a differing<br>
number of stirring elements in the individual smaller<br>
reaction stages of the third reaction zone can likewise<br>
be chosen freely. It merely has to be ensured that a<br>
product which is substantially uniform in terms of its<br>
properties is obtained in each case. For this purpose,<br><br>
it has to be ensured<br><br><br>
that the stirring elements move the product, result in<br>
film formation and/or transport from the product liquid<br>
into the vapor space.<br>
It is advantageous for at least one end disk of the<br>
support frame to be elastic. In this way, it is ensured<br>
that thermal expansions between the reactor wall and<br>
stirring device are taken up by the stirring device and<br>
not by the actual shaft bearings.<br>
After passing the last dividing wall or the last<br>
overflow weir, the finished product is taken off in the<br>
middle at the lowest point of the vertical reactor.<br>
Should the desired degree of polymerization not yet<br>
have been achieved, the product obtained in the<br>
vertical reactor can be transferred to a downstream<br>
horizontal annular disk reactor or disk-cage reactor.<br>
It is likewise possible to pelletize the product<br>
obtained and process it further in a further separate<br>
process, e.g. SSP.<br>
The downstream annular disk reactor is a simple vessel<br>
with an installed stirring device. It is advantageous<br>
for the geometric components used as stirring elements<br>
to have little play where they move past the bottom<br>
part of the reactor.<br>
The material is continuously introduced at one end of<br>
the downstream annular disk reactor and conveyed to the<br>
other end, during which process it is continually<br>
lifted from the melt as a thin film on the stirring<br>
elements and flows back into the melt while undergoing<br>
the reaction. The desired polymer is discharged at the<br>
other end. The low-boiling products formed are removed<br>
from the reactor above the melt.<br><br>
Both in the case of the stirring devices provided in<br>
the third reaction zone in the vertical reactor and in<br>
the case of the stirring devices provided in the<br>
downstream horizontal reactor, the geometric elements<br>
provided as stirring elements can be arranged on the<br>
shaft or the support frame with differing angles of<br>
inclination.<br>
The invention is illustrated below with the aid of the<br>
drawings.<br>

stirring elements in plan view;<br>
Fig. 5a and b show forced routes for the material in<br>

reactor 1 in plan view;<br>
Fig. 6a-c show details of the bottommost reaction<br>
zone .<br>
Figure 1 shows the vertical reactor 1 for the production<br>
of polyesters. However, other polymers can in principle<br>
be produced using the reactor of the invention.<br>
The reactor 1 has three reaction zones A, B, C which<br>
are superposed in the vertical reactor.<br><br>
The starting materials 31, 32 for producing the<br>
monomers as starting material for the desired polymer<br>
are mixed in a mixer 33 outside the reactor 1 and<br>
conveyed from a stock vessel 34 via line 30 into the<br>
reactor 1 at the top. The introduction of the mixture<br>
of the raw materials can also be effected at the bottom<br>
of the reaction zone A.<br>
In the first reaction zone A of the reactor 1, the<br>
starting materials are converted into the monomer. The<br>
monomers are taken off via the first line 35 and intro-<br>
duced into the second reaction zone B below the liquid<br>
level of the reaction mixture. In the second reaction<br>
zone, the further reaction to form the monomer or par-<br>
tial polymerization of the monomers occurs. The partial<br>
polymerization is controlled in a desired manner by<br>
means of the reaction temperature and/or the pressure.<br>
To influence the reaction temperature, the reactor 1 is<br>
enclosed by a heating jacket and/or provided with heat<br>
exchangers 47. Each of the reaction zones A, B, C can<br>
be provided with separate jacket segments 2, 3, 4 or<br>
the heating jacket and/or the heat exchangers 47 are<br>
all supplied with cooling or heating media.<br>
To reduce the carry-over of product particles into	the<br>
condensers (not shown) and recirculate them to	the<br>
reaction zone, precipitators 46 can be provided in	the<br>
individual reaction zones.<br>
After the desired viscosity of the prepolymer has been<br>
reached in the second reaction zone B, this is taken<br>
off at the lowermost end of the second reaction zone B<br>
by means of a line 9. The prepolymers are, after they<br>
have been heated in heating devices 37 additionally<br>
provided outside the plant, introduced into the third<br>
reaction zone C at one or more points at the outer<br>
edge.<br><br>
An annular disk reactor or disk-cage reactor is located<br>
in the third reaction zone C, with the wall of the<br>
reactor 1 being configured as a hemisphere or part of a<br>
hemisphere 7 at the bottom end. To circulate and move<br>
the material, a stirring device 5 is provided. The<br>
stirring device 5 comprises a hollow shaft 12 on which<br>
mixing means 15a to k, e.g. annular disks, segments of<br>
annular disks, scoop-shaped profiles and the like, are<br>
arranged. To achieve better control of the<br>
polymerization, dividing walls and/or overflow weirs 8<br>
are provided in the hemisphere 7.<br>
One or more of the mixing means 15 are provided between<br>
the individual dividing walls and/or overflow weirs 8.<br>
Material flow is achieved by means of the mixing means<br>
15, e.g. annular disks, which may be vertical or<br>
inclined. The course of the reaction is controlled so<br>
that the polymers have reached the desired degree of<br>
polymerization after reaching the middle zone formed by<br>
the dividing walls or overflow weirs 8. The polymers<br>
are then discharged from the reactor 1 through the line<br>
38.<br>
Figure 2 shows the vertical reactor 1 which corresponds<br>
essentially to the reactor 1 described in Figure 1 with<br>
a downstream horizontal end reactor 39. As a<br>
modification to the course of the reaction described<br>
for Figure 1, the starting materials 31, 32 are<br>
introduced directly without prior mixing into the first<br>
reaction zone A of the vertical reactor 1.<br>
In this variant, the conversion into the monomer is<br>
aided by a stirrer 6. The reaction product is<br>
transferred from the first reaction zone A into the<br>
second reaction zone B, as in the description for<br>
Figure 1. As a modification, the reaction product from<br>
the second reaction zone B is introduced directly via<br>
line 9 into the third reaction zone C at one or more<br><br>
points at the outer edge of the reactor 1. Heating<br>
elements (not shown) can be provided at the inlet.<br><br><br>
An annular disk reactor or disk-cage reactor is located<br>
in the third reaction zone C, as described in the case<br>
of Figure 1. Here, the stirring elements consist of<br>
annular disks provided with holes 16. The reaction of<br>
the prepolymers to form the polymers is, in this<br>
variant, carried out only to a particular viscosity or<br>
to a particular molecular weight and the material taken<br>
off at the outlet 38 is then transferred to a<br>
downstream end reactor 39. The end reactor 39 consists<br>
of an annular disk reactor or disk-cage reactor known<br>
per se. In the end reactor 39, the polymerization is<br>
completed.<br>
The annular disk reactor is a jacket-heated double-<br>
walled vessel having a heating space 40. The material<br>
introduced at the inlet 41 is conveyed by the stirring<br>
device 5 from the inlet 41 to the outlet 42 and in the<br>
process is mixed, stirred through and subjected to a<br>
high surface action for the further polymerization.<br>
An outlet 43 is provided for discharge of vapors or<br>
gases.<br>
The stirring device 5 is in principle constructed as<br>
has been described for the third reaction zone C of<br>
Figure 1. As a modification, no shaft 11 but instead a<br>
rotatable support frame comprising the end disks 44 and<br>
the longitudinal spars 14 is provided. The mixing means<br>
15, e.g. annular disks, are fastened to the<br>
longitudinal spars 14. The individual annular disks 15<br>
are fastened so that they are inclined to the<br>
longitudinal spars 14. Likewise, scooping elements can<br>
be provided in place of the annular disks 15 or the<br>
scooping elements are additionally arranged on the<br>
annular disks 15.<br>
The longitudinal spars 14 can be round or profiled.<br>
Likewise, perforations can be provided in the<br><br>
longitudinal spars 14, particularly when profiles are<br>
employed. The<br><br><br>
perforations help the viscous reaction mixture to run<br>
down during the reaction occurring during passage<br>
through the end reactor 39.<br>
Illustrative embodiments of the stirring devices 15 are<br>
shown in Figures 3a to 3k and Figures 4a to 4g, without<br>
these constituting a restriction.<br>
Figure 3a shows a stirring device having a shaft 11<br>

elements 48.<br>

cylinder 12 with annular disks provided with scooping<br>
elements 48.<br>

disks or segments of annular disks.<br>

the hollow cylinder is perforated.<br>
Figure 4e shows a modification of Figure 4d in which a<br>
plurality of neighboring scooping elements 48 are<br>
combined to form a larger scooping element.<br>
Figure 4f depicts a variant having obliquely mounted<br>
annular disks.<br>
Figure 4g shows various variants of the perforations 16<br>
and scooping elements 4 8 which can be employed<br>
individually or in combination.<br>
The annular disks 15 or 15a to k depicted in Figures 1<br>
and 2 can have the configurations shown in Figures 3a-<br>
k. They comprise, for example, a flat annular sheet<br>
provided with a multiplicity of holes 16. This annular<br>
disk is connected in the region of its circumference to<br>
the longitudinal spars 14, e.g. by the longitudinal<br>
spars 14 being passed through the annular disk and<br>
welded in place. Likewise, the annular disks 15 or<br>
other mixing means used as stirring devices can be<br>
connected at their outer areas or inner areas to the<br>
longitudinal spars 14.<br>
Figures 5a and b show possibilities for the forced<br>
routing of the product in the second reaction zone B of<br>
the reactor 1. These arrangements comprise dividing<br>
walls 45 which are wound concentrically within one<br><br>
another and direct the material from the outside inward<br>
or in<br><br><br>
the reverse direction and then downward into the third<br>
reaction stage. Improved homogeneity of the monomer or<br>
prepolymer is achieved in this way.<br>
Figures 6a to 6c show different variants of the<br>
bottommost reaction zone. Different support construc-<br>
tions for the disks 15 are shown here. Figure 6a shows<br>
a shaft 11, Figure 6b shows a hollow cylinder (cage)<br>
and Figure 6c shows a support frame construction.<br><br><br>
