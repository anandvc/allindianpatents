METHOD OF COMMUNICATING SIGNALS IN A MOBILE<br>
COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a method of<br>
communicating signals in a mobile communication system, and<br>
more particularly, to a method of processing control<br>
information associated with handover in a mobile<br>
communication system.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Generally, the present invention is applicable to<br>
various communication systems. LTE (long term evolution)<br>
network evolving from UMTS (universal mobile<br>
telecommunications system) is explained as one example of<br>
the various communication systems, to which the present<br>
invention is applicable, in the following description.<br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of LTE (long term<br>
evolution) network as a mobile communication system to<br>
which a related art or the present invention is applied.<br>
The LTE network system has evolved from a<br>
conventional UMTS system. And, the 3GPP is working on the<br>
basic standardization of the LTE system.<br>
An LTE network consists of a user equipment<br>
(hereinafter abbreviated UE) , a base station (hereinafter<br>
abbreviated eNode B) and an access gateway {hereinafter<br>
abbreviated AG) located at an end of a network to be<br>
connected to an external network.<br><br>
WO 2006/135185	2	PCT/KR2006/002252<br>
The AG includes a UPE (user plane entity) node<br>
responsible for a user traffic processing and an MME<br>
(mobility management entity) node responsible for a control.<br>
In this case, the MMS and UPE nodes are able to communicate<br>
with each other via a new interface in-between.<br>
At least one or more cells can exist in one eNode B.<br>
An interface X2 for a user or control traffic transmission<br>
is defined between the eNode Bs. And, an interface S1 is<br>
defined between the eNode B and the AG.<br>
Layers of a radio interface protocol between a<br>
terminal and a network can be classified into L1 first<br>
layer), L2 (second layerO and L3 (third layer) based on<br>
three lower layers of an open system interconnection (OSI)<br>
reference model widely known in communication systems. A<br>
physical layer belonging to the first layer provides an<br>
information transfer service using a physical channel. A<br>
radio resource control (hereinafter abbreviated RRC) layer<br>
located in the third layer plays a role in controlling<br>
radio resources between a terminal and a network. For this,<br>
the RRC layers enable RRC messages to be exchanged between<br>
the terminal and the network. The RRC layers can be<br>
distributed to network nodes including the eNode B,<br>
respectively. Instead, the RRC layer can be located at<br>
either the eNode B or the AG.<br>
FIG. 2 is an architectural diagram of a radio<br>
interface protocol between UE (user equipment) and . UTRAN<br>
(UMTS terrestrial radio access network) based on 3GPP radio<br><br>
WO 2006/135185	2	PCT/KR2006/002252<br>
access network specifications.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, a radio interface protocol<br>
vertically includes a physical layer, a data link layer,<br>
and a network layer and horizontally includes a user plane<br>
for data information transfer and a control plane for<br>
signaling transfer.<br>
The protocol layers in FIG. 2 can be classified into<br>
L1 {first layer), L2 (second layer), and L3 (third layer)<br>
based on three lower layers of the open system<br>
interconnection (OSI) standard model widely known in the<br>
communications systems.<br>
The respective layers of the radio protocol control<br>
plane shown in FIG. 2 and the radio protocol user plane<br>
shown in FIG. 3 are explained as follows.<br>
First of all, the physical layer as the first layer<br>
offers an information transfer service to an upper layer<br>
using a physical channel. The physical layer is connected<br>
to a medium access control (hereinafter abbreviated MAC)<br>
layer above the physical layer via a transport channel. And,<br>
data are transferred between the medium access control<br>
layer and the physical layer via the transport channel.<br>
Moreover, data are transferred between different physical<br>
layers, and more particularly, between one physical layer<br>
of a transmitting side and the other physical layer of a<br>
receiving side via the physical channel.<br>
The medium access control (hereinafter abbreviated<br>
MAC) layer of the second layer offers a service to a radio<br><br>
WO 2006/135185	4	PCT/KR2006/002252<br>
link control layer above the MAC layer via a logical<br>
channel. A radio link control (hereinafter abbreviated RLC)<br>
layer of the second layer supports reliable data transfer.<br>
A function of the RLC layer can be implemented by a<br>
function block within the MAC. In this case, the RLC layer<br>
may not exist. And, the MAC and RLC layers exist in an<br>
eNode B of a network.<br>
A packet data convergence protocol (hereinafter<br>
abbreviated PDCP) layer of the second layer plays a header<br>
compression function to reduce an IP packet header size<br>
containing unnecessary control information having a<br>
relatively big size to enable efficient transmission of<br>
packets of IP such as IPv4 and IPv6. The PDCP layer exists<br>
in the AG of the network. The PDCP layer exists at an MME<br>
(mobility management entity) or the PDCP layers exist at<br>
the MME and a UPE (user plane entity), respectively.<br>
A radio resource control (hereinafter abbreviated<br>
'RRC' ) layer located in a highest part of the third layer<br>
is defined in the control plane only and is associated with<br>
configuration, reconfiguration and release of radio bearers<br>
to be responsible for controlling the logical, transport<br>
and physical channels (hereinafter, the radio bearer will<br>
be abbreviated RB) . In this case, the RB means a service<br>
offered by the second layer for the data transfer between<br>
the UE and the UTRAN. And, the RRC layer in the network is<br>
located at the eNOde B.<br>
As downlink transport channels carrying data to a UE<br><br>
WO2006/135185	5	PCT/KR2006/002252<br>
from a network, there are a broadcast channel {BCH}<br>
carrying system information and a downlink shared channel<br>
(SCH) carrying a user traffic or control message.<br>
And, the configuration of RB means a process of<br>
regulating characteristics of protocol layers and channels<br>
necessary for offering a specific service and a process of<br>
setting their specific parameters and operational methods,<br>
respectively. A traffic or control message of a downlink<br>
multicast or broadcast service can be transmitted via the<br>
downlink SCH or a separate multicast channel (MCH).<br>
Moreover, as uplink transport channels carrying data<br>
from a UE to a network, there are RACH {random access<br>
channel) carrying an initial control message and an uplink<br>
SCH carrying a user traffic or control message.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred<br>
embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are<br>
illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
In the related art, a UE transfers signaling to a<br>
base station controller (RNC) in moving away into a new<br>
base station (eNode B). However, since only the base<br>
station controller is able to handle a data loss problem<br>
that may occur when a UE moves away into a new base station,<br>
the data handling is slowed down.<br>
This document provides a method of signaling by which<br>
a problem of data loss, which occurs when a radio UE moves<br>
away into a new base station, can be efficiently handled.<br>
Handover methods according to embodiments of the<br>
present invention are explained with reference to FIGs. 4<br>
to 6 as follows.<br>
First of all, network entities shown in FIGs. 4 to 6<br>
are able to perform various functions.<br>
A serving GPRS supporting node (hereinafter<br>
abbreviated SGSN) takes charge of a UPE function of<br>
transferring a user traffic to an eNode B and an E-RNC is<br>
responsible for an MME function of taking charge of various<br>
control functions.<br>
Both of the SGSN and the E-RNC are included in an AG.<br>
So, a MAC layer and an RLC layer are located at the eNode B<br>
and a PDCP layer is located at the SGSN.<br>
A T-E-Node B (hereinafter abbreviated SNB) indicates<br><br>
WO 2006/135185	12	PCT/KR2006/002252<br>
a new target base station to which a UE is going to move<br>
into and an S-E-Node (hereinafter abbreviated SNB)<br>
indicates an old source base station where the UE is<br>
located before handover.<br>
FIG. 4 is block diagram for a first handover method<br>
according to a embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, once a radio UE decides to<br>
initiate a handover to a TNB from an SNB, the SNB transfers<br>
an container to the TNB. The container includes information<br>
associated with the UE executing the handover operation. In<br>
this case, a sequence number (hereinafter abbreviated<br>
SeqNum) for data received/transmitted by the UE is included<br>
in the container.<br>
The TND transfers a data unit to the UE performing<br>
the handover operation according to the sequence number. In<br>
particular, the TNB transmits a data unit of an RLC or MAC<br>
layer corresponding to the sequence number to the UE. The<br>
sequence number is the information for a number for<br>
identifying at least one data unit transmitted to the UE<br>
and can be implemented in various forms. Preferably, the<br>
sequence number is managed by the RLC or MAC layer for<br>
example.<br>
FIG. 5 is a block diagram for a second handover<br>
method according to a embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, before initiating a handover, a<br>
UE informs an SNB that the SNB should suspend data<br>
transmission/reception (Flow Suspend message) and informs a<br><br>
WO 2006/135185	13	PCT/KR2006/002252<br>
TNB that the TNB needs to initiate data<br>
transmission/reception (Flow Request message).<br>
The Flow Suspend message can be transmitted like<br>
A501' shown in FIG. 5 and the Flow Request message can be<br>
transmitted like '502' shown in FIG. 5.<br>
In this case, a sequence number of a data unit of an<br>
RLC or MAC layer to be transmitted/received by the UE is<br>
included in the message transmitted to the TNB by the UE<br>
(503). In this example, a downlink sequence number<br>
DL_SeqNum is transmitted.<br>
The TNB is able to transmit at least one data unit of<br>
the RLC or MAC corresponding to the sequence number after<br>
having received the information. The downlink sequence<br>
number is a sequence number for identifying downlink data<br>
transmitted to the UE from a base station, i.e., the TNB<br>
and can be managed by the RLC or MAC layer.<br>
If transmission/reception control of SGSN as an upper<br>
node of NB (TND or SNB) is required for handover, the SNB<br>
having received the Flow Suspend message informs the SGSN<br>
that the SGSN should suspend data transmission/reception<br>
(504). The TNB having received the Flow Request message is<br>
able to make a request of initiating the data<br>
transmission/reception to the SGSN (505).<br>
In case of making the request for the data<br>
transmission/reception (505), the TNB is able to deliver<br>
the sequence number information (506) transferred by the UE<br>
to the SGSN. In this case, the sequence number (506). needs<br><br>
WO 2006/135185	14	PCT/KR2006/002252<br>
to be recognized by the SGSN. So, the sequence number 506<br>
can correspond to a sequence number managed by a PDCP or<br>
security layer located at the SGSN. Namely, since each<br>
sequence number should be information recognizable by a<br>
network entity to which the sequence number is delivered<br>
and should correspond to a sequence number managed by the<br>
network entity.<br>
An E-RNC, as shown in FIG. 5, is able to manage an<br>
active set to support mobility of the UE. In particular, at<br>
least one eNode B used for data transmission/reception for<br>
one specific UE can be managed by being included in the<br>
active set for the UE.<br>
For this, the E-RNC receives measurement information<br>
(507) of the UE for reception power of several cells to<br>
manage the active set. The measurement information can be<br>
delivered to the E-RNC via such a base station as an SNB or<br>
can be directly delivered to the E-RNC from the UE. In FIG.<br>
5, both of the TNB and the SNB are included in the active<br>
set for a specific UE.<br>
Meanwhile, in the embodiment shown in FIG. 5, the E-<br>
RNC is able to deliver information 508 to each eNode D<br>
included in the active set and the corresponding SGSN. The<br>
information indicates that the eNode B which received the<br>
information 508 is included in the active set.<br>
FIG. 6 is block a diagram for a third handover method<br>
according to a embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, an E-RNC enables an eNode B to<br><br>
WO 2006/135185	l5	PCT/KR2006/002252<br>
be included in or removed from an active set according to a<br>
request (Active Set Request) made by the corresponding<br>
eNode B (601) . In this case, the eNode B can make a<br>
request an inclusion/removal in/from the active set<br>
according to a request (Flow Request/Flow Suspend) (603}<br>
made by a UE.<br>
One active set is managed for each UE. The UE or<br>
eNode B can make a request to an AG for including/removing<br>
a specific eNode B or cell in/from the active set via such<br>
a message as Flow Request, Flow Suspend, and Measurement<br>
proposed by the present invention. In general, one eNode B<br>
in an active set transmits data to a corresponding UE or<br>
receives data from the corresponding UE.<br>
Meanwhile, in case of bi-cast that one UPE transmits<br>
data to at least two eNode Bs simultaneously, the at least<br>
