COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See section 10; rule 13)<br>
Title of the invention<br>
METHOD AND COMPOSITION FOR THE GRADUAL PERMANENT COLORING OF HAIR<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai-400 020, State of Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br><br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method for the permanent coloring of hair with longer lasting conditioning and with minimized hair damage.<br>
Most hair coloring products fall under three major groupings:<br>
1.	Temporary hair color<br>
2.	Semi permanent hair color<br>
3.	Permanent hair color<br>
Temporary color is a leave on product that causes minimal damage to the hair.  However, temporary color causes stains, and leaches out' under rain or with perspiration.  Temporary color washes out with the next shampoo.  Temporary color also does not give any control to the consumer over the amount of color deposited or the permanency of the color supplied.  Temporary color does not result in a wide variety of colors and it has only a limited appeal.<br>
Semi-permanent hair color comes as a rinse, and it causes minimal damage to the hair. However, semi-permanent hair color washes out to some degree with each shampoo and washes<br><br>
2<br><br>
out completely within- about 4 to 6 shampoos.  Semi permanent hair color does not give the consumer any control regarding the amount of color deposited or the permanency of the color.  Semi-permanent hair color has limited popularity with consumers.<br>
Permanent hair color generally comes in two parts: a dye solution and a developer solution.  Because of the damaging nature of current permanent dye treatments, most home coloring products come with a post treatment conditioner. In a permanent hair coloring treatment, the dye solution and the developer solution are mixed and then applied to the hair, which is then left for about 25 to about 35 minutes. The hair is then rinsed with water, treated with a post treatment conditioner, and then rinsed again with water.<br>
The application of the dye solution and the developer solution affords permanent hair coloring.  However, this method does not provide any conditioning benefit.  The conditioning benefit comes through application of the post treatment conditioner, and it is only temporary.  The conditioning benefit is lost with the next shampoo. Moreover, with permanent hair coloring treatments, shampooing the hair is usually not recommended after said treatments.  Thus, hair is left feeling, dirty, and can stain towels and pillows.<br>
Coloring products need to be applied every four to six weeks since hair grows out of the scalp at the rate of approximately one half inch per month.  Each coloring application causes damage to the hair, and that damage is<br>
3<br><br>
cumulative.  Hair touch ups after the initial treatment would also damage hair more.<br>
It would be desirable to develop a method for permanently coloring hair that conditions hair, gives hair a soft clean feel, and minimizes the damage caused to hair by the coloring process.  The present invention provides such a method.<br>
Conventional hair coloring products cannot be used safely in the shower.  It is an object of this invention to develop a method for permanently coloring hair, which can be carried out safely in the shower.  It is also an object of the invention to provide a method for permanently coloring hair wherein the user has control of the amount of durable color deposited without hair damage.  It is also an object of the invention to provide a method for permanently coloring hair wherein the user has control on the amount of lifting/lightening without causing hair damage.  It is also an object of the invention to provide a method for permanently coloring hair wherein the user can employ the product as her daily hair care product to avoid new out growth of uncolored hair.  It is also an object of the invention to provide a method for permanently coloring hair wherein said method involves less mess and difficulty than conventional permanent hair coloring methods.  It is also an object of the invention to provide a method for permanently coloring hair wherein said method brings about gradual color changes with each application.  Since gradual color changes are to occur, such a method would be virtually mistake free because the consumer could stop or alter the coloring method<br>
4<br><br>
if he or she did not like the course the hair coloring was taking.  It is also an object of the invention to provide a method for permanently coloring hair wherein the amount of hair coloring composition employed can be varied from application to application in order to adjust the hair coloring results.<br>
These and other aspects of this invention will become evident by a detailed description of the invention given below.<br>

What follows is a description of the ingredients that can be included in the compositions of the present invention.<br>
HAIR DYES AND HAIR COLORING AGENTS<br>
The part A compositions of the present invention- include as an essential feature one or more oxidative hair coloring agents.  These hair coloring agents are present in compositions of the present invention which have a conditioner base, and compositions of the present invention which have a shampoo base.  Such oxidative hair-coloring agents are used in combination with the oxidizing systems of the present invention to formulate permanent hair dye' compositions.<br>
11 <br>
Permanent hair dye compositions as defined herein are compositions, which once applied to the hair, are substantially resistant to washout.<br>
OXIDATIVE DYES<br>
The dye forming intermediates used in oxidative dyes are essentially aromatic diamines, aminophenols and their derivatives.  These dye forming intermediates can be classified as; primary and "secondary intermediates, couplers and modifiers, and nitro dyes.  Primary intermediates are chemical compounds, which by themselves will form a dye upon oxidation.  The secondary intermediates, also known as color modifiers or couplers and are used with other intermediates for specific color effects or to stabilize the color.  Nitro dyes are unique in that they are direct dyes, which do not require oxidation to dye the hair.<br>
The oxidation dye intermediates, which are suitable for use in the compositions and processes herein include aromatic diamines, polyhydric phenols, aminophenols and derivatives of these aromatic compounds (e.g., N-substituted derivatives of the amines, and ethers of the phenols).  Primary oxidation dye intermediates are generally colorless molecules prior to oxidation.  The oxidation dye color is generated when the primary intermediate is sactivated" and subsequently enjoined with a secondary intermediate (coupling agent), which is also generally colorless, to form a colored, conjugated molecule.  In general terms, oxidation hair dye precursors or intermediates include those monomeric<br>
12 <br>
materials which, on oxidation, form oligomers or polymers having extended conjugated systems of electrons in their molecular structure.  Because of the new electronic structure, the resultant oligomers and polymers exhibit a shift in their electronic spectra to the visible range and appear colored.  For example, oxidation dye precursors capable of forming colored polymers include materials such as aniline, which has a single functional group and which, on oxidation, forms a series of conjugated imines and quinoid dimers, trimers, etc. ranging in color from green to black.  Compounds such as p- phenylenediamine, which has two functional groups, are capable of oxidative polymerization to yield higher molecular weight colored materials having extended conjugated electron systems.  Color modifiers (couplers), such as those detailed hereinafter, are preferably used in conjunction with the oxidation dye precursors herein and are thought to interpose themselves in the colored polymers during their formation and to cause shifts in the electronic spectra thereof, thereby resulting in slight color changes.  A representative list of oxidation dye precursors suitable for use herein is found in Sagarin, "Cosmetic Science and Technology"," Interscience, Special Edition, Volume 2, pages 308 to 310.<br>
It is to be understood that the oxidizing aids of the present invention are suitable for use (in combination with a source of peroxide as detailed herein) with all manner of oxidation dye precursors and color modifiers and that the precursors detailed below are only by way of example and are not intended to limit the compositions and processes herein.<br>
13 <br>
The typical aromatic diamines, polyhydric phenols, aminophenols, and derivatives thereof, described above as primary dye precursors can also have additional substituents on the aromatic ring, e.g. halogen, aldehyde, carboxylic additional substituents on the amino nitrogen and on the phenolic oxygen, e.g. substituted and unsubstituted alkyl and aryl groups.<br>
The hair coloring compositions of the present invention may, in addition to the essential oxidative hair-coloring agents, optionally include non-oxidative and other dye materials. Optional non-oxidative and other dyes suitable for use in the hair coloring compositions and processes according to the present invention include semi-permanent, temporary and other dyes.  Non-oxidative dyes as defined herein include the so-called "direct action dyes", metallic dyes, metal chelate dyes, fiber reactive dyes and other synthetic and natural dyes.  Various types of non-oxidative dyes are detailed in: Chemical and Physical Behaviour of Human Hair" 3rd Edn. by Clarence Robbins (pp 250-259); "The Chemistry and Manufacture of Cosmetics".

We have found by experimentation that daily hair care products can achieve durable desired hair color.  As noted above, the daily hair care product consists of two parts.<br>
Part A: Dye intermediates in va conditioner or shampoo base at alkaline pH<br>
Part B: Hydrogen peroxide in a conditioner or shampoo base at acidic pH<br>
Part A is mixed with part B and applied to hair.  The reason current hair coloring products come in two packages is because the mixture of the coloring component and the oxidizing component is unstable and the two components must be kept apart until just before use.  Similarly part A and part B of the present invention must be kept apart until just before use.  By varying the concentration of the actives and the treatment time, the amount of color on hair could be varied while minimizing hair damage.  To make the product more convenient and fool proof, part A and B can be packaged in dual dispensing systems where both parts are mixed out side of the package when dispensed which is then applied to the wet hair as a conditioner or shampoo.<br>
28 <br>
Depending upon the amount of color desired, the treatment time could be varied from two minutes or longer.<br>
Such conditioner or shampoo treatments would add color to hair gradually without damage due to lower contact time. Each subsequent treatment would add color until the desired shade is obtained.  Depending upon the concentration of the actives and contact time, a desired shade may be reached in six to eight treatments.  We have found that since any one treatment does not exceed the threshold of irreversible damage, the total .damage resulting from multiple treatments is lower than the damage from a single conventional treatment.  Such a process gives the user control on the amount of color deposited on her hair, and also the option to discontinue further applications if the color delivered is not to her liking.  She also has the option to switch to another color shade immediately without having to wait the six to eight weeks that is recommended for conventional treatments.  With conventional hair color treatment, it is not recommended to perm and color hair simultaneously due to extensive damage.  However, since this method colors the hair with minimum damage, perming can be done in the same time frame with this progressive coloring treatment.<br>
METHOD FOR USING COMPOSITIONS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Shampoo the hair as usual.  Pump the composition of the invention into the palm and mix.   Apply product to the hair like a regular conditioner. Rinse the hands.  Leave product in the hair for about 2 minutes for color maintenance to<br>
29 <br>
about 5 minutes for color change.  Rinse the hair thoroughly.<br>

EXAMPLE # 2<br>
L'Oreal Dark Brown permanent hair color<br>
Color the hair tresses using L'Oreal dark brown permanent hair color.  Follow the instruction sheet.  Measure the change in color delta E using McBeth ColorEye.<br>
The changes in Delta E values are summarized in below table. You can see from the results that change in color after one 30-min. treatment with L'Oreal Dark Brown is very similar to six- 2-min. treatment of color conditioner.  The good correlation was observed with number of treatment and change in the color of the hair.  It takes six treatments to achieve a single 30 minutes treatment of permanent color.<br>
L'Oreal's Preference: Invention: Dark Brown Dark Brown: Delta E  Delta E<br>
1	treatment -30 min.	4.19<br>
2	treatments-2 min. each	1.68 4 treatments-2 min. each                         3.45 <br>
6 treatments-2 min. each                            4.02<br>
It can be seen that six treatments of two minutes per each treatment with the dark brown color composition of the present invention, resulted in approximately the same color change, Delta E, as one thirty minute treatment with L’Oreal's dark brown color composition.<br>

EXAMPLE #3<br>
The combing experiment was carried out to evaluate the extent of damage.  Wet combing evaluation technique has been used to correlate damage.  Lower wet combing force indicates less damage.  The above tresses were evaluated via Instron to measure combing force.<br>
Results indicated that the tresses treated with L'Oreal dark brown required much higher combing force than tresses treated with color conditioner.<br>
39<br><br>
EXPERIMENTAL<br>
To evaluate the wet combing performance of a Dark Brown and Light Brown Co]or Conditioner of the invention the measurements below were made.  The combing force of hair treated 30 times with Light Brown composition was measured and compared with combing force of hair treated with one treatment of L'Oreal Preference.  Also, tensile strength damage caused by the composition of the invention was compared to tensile strength damage caused by a commercial color product (Preference by L'Oreal).  Wet combing experiments have been carried out on the Instron 5500 series.  All testing was carried out by applying 0.3 ml of product to bleached and waved 2g hair tresses.  Results are expressed in terms of the maximum load (highest force encountered during combing) and combing energy, (area under the combing curve).  Finesse extra moisturizer and Extra body have also been included in this study as internal controls.  Wet combing results are given below.<br>

The above data indicate that the combing force of hair treated 30 times with Light brown composition is very similar to the untreated hair tresses.  However, the combing force of hair treated with one treatment of L'Oreal is much higher than hair treated with Light Brown compositions. Again, as mentioned, higher combing force indicates difficult to comb and higher damage.<br>

TENSILE TESTING<br>
All tensile testing has been carried out on the Diastron MTT600.  The tensile strength of approx. 50 individual fibers were measured for each treatment.  The diameter of these individual fibers is measured prior to testing to allow the force to be normalized against cross sectional area.<br>
That is:      Stress = Force/Cross sectional area<br>
The tensile properties of hair may be taken to reflect the extent of structural integrity.  Various measurements may be used to assess these tensile properties.  Common parameters include the stress at break, work to break or extension to break.  The complex structural properties of hair dictate that the wet and dry tensile properties reflect the properties of different regions.  Wet tensile properties may be regarded as being representative of the alpha helical keratin protein within the hair's microfibrils; while the dry tensile properties also includes a substantial contribution from the intercellular cement.  Many previous sets of results have shown that changes in tensile properties as a function of a treatment are more often seen when considering the wet tensile properties.  For this reason, these experiments represent measurement of the wet tensile properties of the various hair treatments.<br>
Each set of crimped hair samples was soaked in water for 30 mins prior to testing.  In addition, the slots in the<br>
44<br><br>
tensile testing carousel were filled with water to ensure that the fibers remained soaked for the progression of the experiment.  All tress treatments were carried out by the requester.<br>
Break stress results are shown below.<br>

The above results would seem to be suggesting that the chemical treatment L'Oreal Preference color has lowered the break stress, while the conditioner of the invention has had no effect on this tensile parameter remains as  untreated. It indicates that hair treated with L'Oreal preference is easier to break compare to the untreated hair and the hair treated with conditioner of the invention.<br><br><br>

The composition resulting from the mixing the developer composition and the dye composition has a pH of greater than or equal to 7.5.  This mixture is applied to the hair. After a period ranging from 2 to 30 minutes, the hair is rinsed with water, optionally treated with an after treatment composition, and then rinsed with water again.<br>
Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the following mathematical formulae schematically describe the color change results and the hair damage results, which are obtained through the use of the compositions and methods of the present invention.<br>
Final color    concentration<br>
Change result = of dyestuff  + pH<br>
+ contact time<br>
+ number of treatments.<br>
Hair damage =  (pH + concentration of oxidizing agent) times the contact time; with the proviso that when the contact time is about two minutes or less, then there is no appreciable hair damage no matter how high the number of treatments.<br>
Thus, if the contact time is kept at about two minutes or below for each treatment with compositions of the invention then there is no appreciable hair damage no matter how many color application treatments according to the invention are performed.<br>

The above results indicate that a composition of the new invention can deposit 30% more color than a conventional hair color composition.<br>
Treatment product<br>
The new composition can be used as a treatment product also.<br>
The result of the following experiment suggests that the new<br>
56<br><br>
conditioner base deposits about 30% more color than conventional surfactant base. Along with this, the new base gives very little damage compared to a conventional base. A post treatment conditioner is therefore not needed. However, with a conventional base, one would need post treatment conditioner.<br>
Take equal amounts of color conditioner of part A and B (formula #1), mix and apply to the hair tresses, leave on the hair tresses for 30 minutes, and rinse well. Measure the change in color delta E using McBeth ColorEye.<br>
The changes in delta E values are summarized in the table below. It can be seen from the results that the change in color after one 30-minute treatment with the base of the invention is about 30% higher than color developed by a conventional base.<br>

Treatment of hair with compositions of the invention as described herein gives said hair good attributes such as lower wet combing force, higher break stress, lower amounts of cysteic acid (which are an indicator of hair damage),<br>
57<br><br>
good hair color change, less color fading, less damage to hair, and more intense color to hair as described just below. Also described below is a method for applying a composition of the invention at set time intervals so as to avoid root outgrowth and reduce color fading<br>
Combing index-<br>
The combing experiment has been carried out to evaluate the extent of damage. Wet combing evaluation technique has been used to correlate, damage. The combing index was measured to evaluate the extent of damage.  Higher index (more than one) number indicates lower damage.<br>
Combing index = Combing force of untreated hair/ combing force of treated with color shampoo<br>
The above tresses were evaluated via Instron to measure combing force.<br>
Treatments	Combing force<br>
Untreated hair	26.15<br>
Treated with color conditioner	9.25<br>
Combing index = Combing force of untreated hair/ combing force of treated with color shampoo<br>
58 <br>
= 26.15/9.25<br>
= 2.82<br>
Wet combing force:<br>
After conventional hair color treatment, it is hard to comb the hair. Harder combing indicates more hair damage. The combing force was measured using an Instron tester.<br>
The combing force with new conditioner composition is preferably in the range of 5 to 55 gmforce, more preferably 5 to 20 and even more preferably 5 to 10 gmforce.<br>
Break stress:<br>
After conventional hair	color treatment, the hair becomes<br>
weak and easy to break.	The weak hair is again a sign of<br>
damage. The strength of	the hair was measured using an<br>
Instron.<br>
The break stress with a conditioner composition of the invention would preferably be in the range of 0.005 to 0.03 gmforce/micron, more preferably 0.005 to 0.025, and even more preferably 0.005 to 0.018 gmforce/micron.<br>
Cysteic acid:<br>
59<br><br>
Much of the hair damage associated with conventional hair color treatment comes from the oxidation of cystine residues to the corresponding cysteic acid, with a consequent decrease in the tensile strength of hair as these cross-linkages are destroyed. A good measure of oxidative damage is thus the amount of cysteic acid formed in hair.<br>
Infrared transmission spectroscopy has been used to determine cysteic acid content in hair. The ratio of absorption at 1040 cm-1 /absorption at 124 0 cm-1 would indicate the extent of damage. Lower the ratio indicates less hair damage.<br>
The ratio of 1040/1240 with new color compositions would preferably be in the range of 0.01 to 1.5, more preferably 0.01 to 1.0, and even more preferably 0.01 to 0.5<br>
Total hair damage:<br>
Hair damage done by hair coloring compositions can be calculated, schematically, according to the following mathematical formulae:<br>
% Damage = Chemical damage X Physical damage<br>
% Damage = amount of cysteic acid X combing forcegm X breaking stress<br>
forcegm/micron2 X 100<br>
% Damage using L'Oreal's conventional preference permanent hair color for example =<br>
60<br><br>
0.75 X 48 X 0.02 X100 = 72 % damage<br>
% Damage using new hair color composition:<br>
0.25 X 20 X 0.015 X 100<br>
=7.5% damage<br>
The above numbers indicate that the hair color compositions of the invention damage the hair to a much lower extent than conventional permanent hair color. The invention relates to a method for adding color to hair which involves causing about 5 to about 10% damage to said hair per week, based on the above formulae and depending on the frequency of use.<br>
Color change/color control:<br>
The conventional permanent hair color system gives the color change delta E of 5 to 65 on blonde hair,, and color change up to delta E of 1 to 8 on brown hair with one treatment. In conventional hair coloring treatments, consumers have little or no control of color, control of hue and control of lightening.<br>
With the composition of the invention and its method, there can be can delivered delta E of 0.1 to 65 on blonde hair and delta E of 0.1 to 8 on brown hair.<br>
61<br><br>
When a dark brown color composition of the present invention is applied to dark brown hair, then after one application there can be a delta E from about 0.1 to about 0.2.<br>
When a dark brown color composition of the present invention is applied to virgin blonde hair, then after one application there can be a delta E from about 10 to about 30.<br>
When a dark brown color composition of the present invention is applied to bleached blonde hair, then after one application there can be a delta E from about 20 to about 40.<br>
Root outgrowth:<br>
A conventional permanent hair color system is used once in 4 to 6 weeks. During this time due to the new hair growth, roots look totally different than rest of the hair. On average the hair grows 1 cm /month or 0.3 mm/day.<br>
With the present compositions and methods, using said compositions as conditioners, one would add color on each application of said compositions. Laboratory evaluation indicates that one would add 10 % of the color change per conditioning treatment.<br>
The amount of color added is determined by the following mathematical formulae.<br>
The length of the new hair = 0.3 mm X no. of days<br>
62<br><br>
% color added to' new hair (lO days)  = No of days X % color added per day<br>
= 10 X 10%= 100% color<br>
Due to the constant addition of the color 10% per day, one will not be able to see root outgrowth.<br>
The invention relates to a method for adding color to hair which involves adding to said hair about 5 to about 10%, preferably about 4 to about 8% color per day, based on the above formulae and depending on the frequency of use.<br>
Color fading:<br>
A conventional permanent hair color system is used once in 4 to 6 weeks. During this time color fades with washing, and outside exposure due to the weathering effect. The amount of color fading will depend upon washing and outside exposure. Assuming that person washes his/her hair 4 times a week and exposes him/herself to outside conditions, for 2.0 hrs a day, the percentage of the color loss can be calculated using following equation.<br>
Laboratory evaluation indicates that one would lose 1% of the color per wash and would lose about 0.75% of the color/hr of outside exposure.<br>
% Loss of color = no. of washing X % color loss/wash + no of hrs. of exposure X<br>
63<br><br>
% color loss/hr<br>
%Loss of color per month = 20 X 1.0 + 40 hrs X 0.75<br>
= 20+ 30= 50%<br>
% Loss of color per week = 12.5%<br>
So, on average a consumer would lose 50% of the hair color. That is why most consumers want to recolor their hair every 4 to 6 weeks.<br>
With the present composition and methods, one would add color on each application of composition, according to the schedule set forth by the following mathematical formulae.<br>
% Color addition/week = no of conditioning treatment week X amount color added/treatment<br>
Laboratory evaluation indicates that one would add 6 % more color per conditioning treatment;<br>
%  Color addition/week = 3 X 10% = 30%<br>
With new composition, we would lose 12.5% of the color but we would add 30% of the color. Due to this, one would not see any fading of the color and color stays fresh everyday.<br>
The invention preferably relates to a method for reducing the color fading of hair to about 0 to about 10% per week,<br>
64<br><br>
based on the above formulae and depending on the frequency of use.<br>
More intense color:<br>
The typical permanent color composition, upon application goes through an oxidation mechanism. Each of the dye intermediates can produce pigments through oxidation and polymerization. According to Le Chatelier's principle,  the state of a chemical reaction is a dynamic state in which the chemical reaction is occurring in both directions. The rate of reaction depends upon the ratio of the rate of forward reaction to the rate of backward reaction. The higher the ratio the faster is the reaction. The factors affecting the rate of reactions are as follows:<br>
1.	Reactants<br>
2.	Products<br>
3.	Pressure<br>
4.	Temperature.<br>
A main difference in the reaction of method of using conventional permanent color system and new invented system is the temperature.  With the conventional system, the reaction takes place at room temperature, at about 70 to 75F, while with new system, since it is used in the shower, the reaction takes place at higher temperatures of about 100 to 110F. According to Le Chatelier's principle, the effect of temperature is very significant to the final rate of reaction.<br>
65<br><br>
Under identical conditions, laboratory evaluation indicates that one would increase intensity of the color 5% with 10F-temperature difference.<br>
Therefore, according to the mathematical formula just below, 15% more color is added using the compositions and methods of the invention as opposed to conventional hair coloring methods.<br>
% Additional Color = delta T X % change in color per one degree F difference<br>
= (100F- 70F) X0.5<br>
= 30 X 0.5 = 15% more color due to new method<br>
At the same time that hair damage is avoided by the methods of the invention, the consumer's hair is gradually being brought to the desired shade and color.  This gradual change of color has two advantages: first, since the color is changed gradually, the consumer can stop the process if she does not like the color her hair is turning to.  Second, some consumers do not want an abrupt change in color because they may feel embarrassed in public after having made such an abrupt change to the color of their hair.  Moreover, the method and compositions of the present invention can be used in the shower, and on a daily basis, because the compositions and methods of the present invention, by contrast with current color compositions, do not employ poisonous levels of chemicals and also because compositions and methods of the present invention involve hair<br>
66<br><br>
application steps that are up to about two minutes in length.  By contrast current hair coloring compositions require approximately 30 minutes' time for each application, an amount of time, which is clearly not suitable for use in the shower.<br>
The methods of the present invention are not as messy as conventional permanent hair coloring methods.  The methods of the present invention do not use chemical compositions that are as smelly and noxious as those used in conventional permanent hair-coloring methods.  Because the methods of the invention can be carried out in the shower, they do not involve the dripping and the mess associated with conventional permanent hair coloring.  The methods of the present invention do not use chemical compositions that can stain fixtures in the bathroom or that will stain the scalp and the face.  Compositions 1 and 2 upon mixture form a composition with a pleasing viscosity and that is pleasing to the fingers.  This is because one or both of compositions 1 and 2 contain a cationic conditioning agent.<br>
A dual package which can be employed in the products and kits of the present invention is 0. S. Patent No. 6,082,588 to Markey et al which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
 KIT CONTAINING AN INSTRUCTION SHEET<br>
The invention also relates to a kit for carrying out the hair coloring method of the invention.  The kit comprises a developer solution, a dye solution and a post treatment solution, each in a separate container or in a dual<br>
67<br><br>
container, as described herein.  The kit also contains written instructions that explain how the compositions of the invention are used.<br>
The consumer admixes the components of the kit according to written instructions, to obtain the aqueous reaction mixture.  The admixture may be conducted in a separate vessel external to the kit, or may take place in a container of the kit adapted to provide sufficient head space for mixing.  The components that are mixed are the developer composition; the dye composition.  The reactants may also be admixed on the hair of the user.  Essentially upon mixing, reaction of the dye and the developer will commence.  After treatment for a desired time the mixture of hair developer and hair dye is removed, preferably with water or a conventional shampoo or a conventional conditioning shampoo.<br>
As noted above, dye intermediate composition and peroxygen composition are mixed together, and the resulting mixture is applied to the hair and allowed to remain for a set time, usually about 1 to about 2 minutes to about 1 hour or more preferably about 30 minutes to about 40 minutes.<br>
Desired change in hair color by the method of the invention is described by the mathematical formula above.  Desired change in hair color can be achieved in a number of other ways.  In the first instance, the consumer can compare her hair color with desired hair color or the hair color of a sample tress.  Hair dyeing by the method of the invention can be repeated until her hair color matches the desired hair color.  It is noted that the compositions used in the<br>
68<br><br>
methods of the invention have lower contact times and thus repeated use of these compositions will not cause hair -damage.  An unexpected discovery of the present invention is that for damage to hair to occur, contact time in each treatment must go above the threshold value of about two minutes.  Thus, the consumer can lighten or color the hair through repeated applications wherein the duration of each color application is about two minutes or less.  The following two advantages are thereby achieved: first, there is a stepwise approach to the desired color; and second, a minimum of hair damage is done.<br>
By the method of the invention, durable desired hair color, with longer lasting hair condition, clean soft feel, and a minimum of hair damage is achieved.<br>
In following the method of the invention, the consumer can compare the color of her hair with the desired hair color, which can be printed on the package of the product.  The consumer can also vary the number of days of application of the product, and the consumer can also vary the amount of time the mixture of composition 1 and 2 is left in the hair on each application.  The number of applications can vary from about 7 to about 30 applications.  The time of each application can vary from about 1 to about two minutes.<br>
The method of the invention occurs over the course of days. Therefore, the final color of the consumer's hair may be affected by the amount of exposure to the sun of the hair during the course of treatment.<br>
69<br><br>
- 69 -<br>
Desired hair color can also be reached by comparing hair after each treatment until it matches hair tresses taken from the consumer during a prior treatment.<br>
Desired hair color can also be reached by testing the hair after each treatment with instruments, which measure the color of the hair.  When the measurements of hair color of the treated hair reach a desired level, the treatment can be stopped.<br>
Indeed, reaching the desired hair color can be achieved by the use of any matching or comparison method commonly employed in the art.<br>
