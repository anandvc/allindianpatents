A MULTI-SPEED TRANSMISSION<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No.<br>
60/893,882, filed on March 8, 2007. The disclosure of the above application is<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002]	The invention relates to a control system for a multi-speed transmission,<br>
and more particularly to a hydraulic control system having a plurality of solenoids and<br>
valves operable to actuate a plurality of actuators within the multi-speed transmission.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003]	A typical multi-speed, dual clutch transmission uses a combination of<br>
two friction clutches and several dog clutch/synchronizers to achieve "power-on" or<br>
dynamic shifts by alternating between one friction clutch and the other, with the<br>
synchronizers being "pre-selected" for the oncoming ratio prior to actually making the<br>
dynamic shift. "Power-on" shifting means that torque flow from the engine need not<br>
be interrupted prior to making the shift. This concept typically uses countershaft gears<br>
with a different, dedicated gear pair or set to achieve each forward speed ratio.<br>
Typically an electronically controlled hydraulic control circuit or system is employed to<br>
control solenoids and valve assemblies. The solenoid and valve assemblies actuate<br>
clutches and synchronizers to achieve the forward and reverse gear ratios.<br>
[0004]	While previous hydraulic control systems are useful for their intended<br>
purpose, the need for new and improved hydraulic control system configurations within<br>
transmissions which exhibit improved performance, especially from the standpoints of<br>
efficiency, responsiveness and smoothness, is essentially constant. Accordingly, there<br>
1<br><br>
is a need for an improved, cost-effective hydraulic control system for use in a<br>
transmission.<br>

DESCRIPTION<br>
[0034]	With reference to FIG. 1, a hydraulic control system for use in a dual<br>
clutch transmission in a motor vehicle is illustrated schematically and generally<br>
7<br><br>
indicated by reference number 10. The hydraulic control system 10 includes a plurality<br>
of subsystems including a line pressure subsystem 12, a torque converter clutch (TCC)<br>
control subsystem 14, a lubrication control subsystem 16, an electronic limited slip<br>
differential (ELSD) subsystem 17, a clutch control subsystem 18, an electronic<br>
transmission range selection (ETRS) subsystem 19, and an actuator control subsystem<br>
20. The hydraulic control system 10 is operable to control the dual clutch transmission,<br>
as will be described in greater detail below. Additionally, the hydraulic control system<br>
10 may include various other subsystems without departing from the scope of the<br>
present invention.<br>
[0035]	The line pressure subsystem 12 is operable to provide and regulate<br>
pressurized hydraulic fluid, such as oil, throughout the hydraulic control system 10.<br>
Accordingly, the line pressure subsystem 12 may include various components (not<br>
shown) such as a hydraulic pump, a fluid source, a line pressure blow-off valve, a line<br>
pressure regulator valve, and/or a filter. In the example provided, the line pressure<br>
subsystem 12 includes a fluid communication channel or line passage, indicated by<br>
reference number 28, which directly provides pressurized hydraulic fluid to the TCC<br>
control subsystem 14, and the clutch control subsystem 18, and the actuator control<br>
subsystem 20. The line passage 28 is illustrated schematically in FIG. 1 as a plurality<br>
of separate lines, however it should be appreciated that the line passage 28 may be a<br>
single continuous passage or a plurality of linked passages in series or in parallel<br>
without departing from the scope of the present invention.<br>
[0036]	The TCC control subsystem 14 controls the operation of a torque<br>
converter (not shown) in the dual clutch transmission. The TCC control subsystem 16<br>
is in direct hydraulic communication with the lubrication control subsystem 16 through<br>
a fluid passage 30. The fluid passage 30 may be a single passage or a plurality of<br>
linked passages in series or in parallel without departing from the scope of the present<br>
invention.<br>
8<br><br>
[0037]	The lubrication control subsystem 16 provides lubrication and cooling to<br>
a variety of components throughout the dual clutch transmission. For example, the<br>
lubrication control subsystem 16 may direct hydraulic fluid through a plurality of fluid<br>
passages (not shown) to components that generate heat.<br>
[0038]	The electronic limited slip differential (ELSD) subsystem 17 is operable<br>
to control an axle clutch 31 located in a differential gear box (not shown) of the motor<br>
vehicle. The axle clutch 31 is coupled to a pair of half-axles 33 which in turn are<br>
coupled to a pair of wheel assemblies 35. The axle clutch 31 controls the difference in<br>
speed between the pairs of half-axles 33 and wheel assemblies 35 in order to eliminate<br>
the difference (or "slip") between the pairs of half axles 33 and wheel assemblies 35.<br>
An exemplary ELSD control subsystem is disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Patent<br>
Application No. 11/950,465 filed on December 5, 2007, and hereby incorporated by<br>
reference as if fully disclosed herein.<br>
[0039]	The clutch control subsystem 18 is operable to control a dual clutch<br>
assembly that includes a first clutch 32 and a second clutch 34. The clutches 32, 34<br>
may be used to engage one or more input shafts or countershafts (not shown) within the<br>
dual clutch transmission and provide dynamic or "power-on" shifts by alternating<br>
engagement between the clutches 32, 34 and the actuator control subsystem 20.<br>
[0040]	The electronic transmission range selection (ETRS) subsystem 19<br>
receives the shift command from a vehicle operator and in the present embodiment is a<br>
shift by wire system. The ETRS subsystem 19 is operable to control a park system 37<br>
upon receipt of electronic control signals. The park system 37 is operable to provide at<br>
least two modes of transmission operation including a first mode or out-of-Park mode<br>
and a second mode or Park mode. While in Park mode, the park system 37 prevents<br>
the transmission from moving the vehicle by preferably locking an output shaft (not<br>
shown) of the transmission. While in out-of-Park mode, the park system 37 is<br>
disengaged and the transmission may move the vehicle by engaging any of the forward<br>
or reverse speed ratios. An exemplary ETRS control subsystem is disclosed in<br>
9<br><br>
commonly assigned U.S. Patent Application No. 11/950,483 filed on December 5,<br>
2007, and hereby incorporated by reference as if fully disclosed herein.<br>
[0041]	With reference to FIG. 2, the actuator control subsystem 20 controls the<br>
actuation of a plurality of synchronizers, clutches, and/or brakes in order to selectively<br>
engage a plurality of gear sets (not shown) within the dual clutch transmission to<br>
provide a plurality of forward and reverse speed ratios and a Neutral. The actuator<br>
control subsystem 24 includes two variable force solenoids 150, 152, an odd/even<br>
actuator security valve 160, an even actuator security valve 162, an odd actuator security<br>
valve 164, three on/off solenoid valves 170, 172, and 174 and four "three-area" piston<br>
actuators 180, 182, 184 and 186.<br>
[0042]	Solenoid 150 includes a fluid port 195 that is in communication with the<br>
line passage 28 and a fluid port 197 that is in communication with a fluid communication<br>
passage 200. Fluid communication passage 200 is in fluid communication with the<br>
odd/even actuator security valve 160. Solenoid 150 is operable to communicate the<br>
pressurized hydraulic fluid from the line passage 28 to engage the 2nd, 3rd, 6th, and 7th gear<br>
ratios of the dual clutch transmission, as will be described in greater detail below.<br>
[0043]	Solenoid 152 includes a fluid port 199 that is in communication with the<br>
line passage 28 and a fluid port 201 that is in communication with a fluid communication<br>
passage 202. Fluid communication passage 202 is in fluid communication with the<br>
odd/even actuator security valve 160. Solenoid 152 is operable to communicate the<br>
pressurized hydraulic fluid from the line passage 28 to engage the 1st, 4th, 5th, and Reverse<br>
gear ratios of the dual clutch transmission, as will be described in greater detail below.<br>
[0044]	The odd/even actuator security valve 160 is operable to communicate the<br>
pressurized hydraulic fluid communicated from either of the solenoids 150, 152 to one of<br>
the odd or even actuator security valves 162, 164. More specifically, the odd/even<br>
actuator security valve 160 includes a fluid port 203 in communication with fluid<br>
communication passage 200 and a fluid port 205 in communication with fluid<br>
communication passage 202 for receiving the pressurized hydraulic fluid from one of the<br>
solenoids 150, 152. The odd/even actuator security valve 160 also includes a fluid port<br>
10<br><br>
207 in communication with a fluid communication passage 208, a fluid port 210 in<br>
communication with a fluid communication passage 212, a fluid port 214 in<br>
communication with a fluid communication passage 216, and a fluid port 218 in<br>
communication with a fluid communication passage 220. Fluid communication passages<br>
212 and 220 are in communication with the even actuator security valve 162 and fluid<br>
communication passages 208 and 216 are in communication with the odd actuator<br>
security valve 164. The odd/even actuator security valve 160 includes a valve 222<br>
slidably disposed therein. The valve 222 is moveable between two positions in order to<br>
allow selective communication of the pressurized hydraulic fluid from fluid port 203 to<br>
fluid port 207 when in a first position and fluid port 210 when in a second position and to<br>
allow selective communication of the hydraulic fluid from fluid port 205 to fluid port 214<br>
when in the first position and fluid port 218 when in the second position. The position of<br>
the valve 222 is controlled by activation of the solenoid 170.<br>
[0045]	The even actuator security valve 162 is operable to communicate the<br>
pressurized hydraulic fluid from the odd/even actuator security valve 160 to the actuators<br>
180 and 182 in order to engage one of the even gear ratios (i.e., the 2nd, 4th, 6th, and<br>
Reverse gear ratios) of the dual clutch transmission. More specifically, the even actuator<br>
security valve 162 includes a fluid port 230 in communication with fluid communication<br>
passage 212 and a fluid port 232 in communication with fluid communication passage<br>
220 for receiving the pressurized hydraulic fluid from the odd/even actuator security<br>

allow selective communication of the hydraulic fluid from fluid port 262 to fluid port 272<br>
when in the first position and fluid port 276 when in the second position. The position of<br>
the valve 280 is controlled by activation of the solenoid 174.<br>
[0047]	Actuators 180, 182, 184, and 186 are preferably three-area piston<br>
assemblies operable to each engage a torque transmitting element. With reference to<br>
FIG. 3A-D, actuator 180 will be described in greater detail, it being appreciated that<br>
actuators 182, 184, and 186 are substantially identical to actuator 180 and accordingly<br>
actuators 182, 184, and 186 have corresponding components. Actuator 180 includes a<br>
first piston 286 and a second piston 288, best seen in FIG. 3A. The pistons 286, 288 are<br>
slidably disposed within a piston housing or cylinder 290, best seen in FIGS. 3B-D. The<br>
12<br><br>
pistons 286, 288 present three separate areas 292, 294, and 296. Area 292 is located on<br>
the first piston 286 and areas 294 and 296 are located on the second piston 288. Each<br>
area 292, 296, and 298 have different sizes or surface areas. The pistons 286, 288 engage<br>
a finger lever 300 of a synchronizer assembly (not shown). The actuator 180 includes a<br>
fluid port 302 that communicates with the areas 292 and 294 of the pistons 286, 288 and<br>
a fluid port 304 that communicates with area 296 of piston 288. Fluid port 302 is in<br>
communication with fluid communication channel 252 and fluid port 304 is in<br>
communication with fluid communication channel 244. Accordingly, the pressurized<br>
hydraulic fluid communicated from the even actuator security valve 162 may enter the<br>
actuator 180 through one of the fluid ports 302, 304 and contact one of the areas 292,<br>
294, 296 of the pistons 286, 288 in order to move the pistons 286, 288 between various<br>
positions. Each position in turn corresponds to a position of the finger lever 300 of the<br>
synchronizer assembly. For example, FIG. 3B illustrates the actuator 180 in a neutral<br>
position, FIG. 3C illustrates pressurized fluid from the fluid port 302 moving the piston<br>
288 to the right to initiate a 6th 4th gear ratio, and FIG. 3D illustrates pressurized fluid<br>
from the fluid port 304 moving the piston 288 to the left to initiate a 4th gear ratio.<br>
[0048]	Returning to FIG. 2, actuator 182 includes a fluid port 306 in<br>
communication with fluid communication channel 240 and a fluid port 308 in<br>
communication with fluid communication channel 248. Pressurized hydraulic fluid<br>
delivered to actuator 182 from fluid port 306 is operable to engage the Reverse gear ratio<br>
and pressurized hydraulic fluid delivered to actuator 182 from fluid port 308 is operable<br>
to engage the 2" gear ratio.<br>
[0049]	Actuator 184 includes a fluid port 310 in communication with fluid<br>
communication channel 266 and a fluid port 312 in communication with fluid<br>
communication channel 274. Pressurized hydraulic fluid delivered to actuator 184 from<br>
fluid port 310 is operable to engage the 7th gear ratio and pressurized hydraulic fluid<br>
delivered to actuator 184 from fluid port 312 is operable to engage the 5th gear ratio.<br>
[0050]	Actuator 186 includes a fluid port 314 in communication with fluid<br>
communication channel 278 and a fluid port 316 in communication with fluid<br>
communication channel 270. Pressurized hydraulic fluid delivered to actuator 186 from<br>
13<br><br>
fluid port 314 is operable to engage the 1st gear ratio and pressurized hydraulic fluid<br>
delivered to actuator 186 from fluid port 316 is operable to engage the 3r gear ratio.<br>
While specific gear ratios for the dual clutch transmission have been associated with<br>
specific actuators 180, 182, 184, 186 in the embodiment provided, it should be<br>
appreciated that the specific gear ratios initiated by the actuators 180, 182, 184, 186 may<br>
vary without departing from the scope of the present invention and is controlled by which<br>
specific synchronizers are coupled to the actuators 180, 182, 184, 186.<br>
