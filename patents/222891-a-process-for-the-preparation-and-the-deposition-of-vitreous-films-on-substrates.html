				<td>Description of the Industrial Invention having the title: "SOL-GEL<br>
PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF VITREOUS FILMS<br>
POSSESSING HIGH ADHESION PROPERTIES AND STABLE<br>
COLLOIDAL SOLUTIONS SUITABLE FOR CARRYING OUT THE<br>
SAME" in the name of the Italian Company NOVARA TECHNOLOGY<br>
S.r.l located in Milano, viale E. Jenner, 51.<br>
The present invention relates to a sol-gel process for the preparation of<br>
vitreous films characterized by high adhesion on the substrate of interest, to<br>
the vitreous films obtained thereby, and to the colloidal suspensions obtained<br>
in the initial phase of the above mentioned process, that can be removed and<br>
maintained as such for indefinite amount of time, before being processed<br>
again to achieve the film deposition.<br>
More particularly, the object of the present invention is a process for the<br>
preparation and the deposition, on the surface of suitable substrates, of<br>
vitreous films comprising the operations of dissolving one or more metal<br>
alkoxides in an aprotic solvent, of adding predetermined amounts of an<br>
aqueous solutions of a catalyst to the solution thereby obtained, of<br>
monitoring with adequate precision the hydrolysis reaction, of the eventual<br>
extraction and removal the amount of alcohol produced in the hydrolysis<br>
reaction, of the gelation of the sol on the surface of interest and of the final<br>
drying of the film. It is of particular importance in this invention, the<br>
possibility to stop the process after hydrolysis and before film deposition to<br>
isolate a sol that in the apparent condition of a clear and stable solution, can<br>
be stored safely for long time at room temperature.<br>
The vitreous films are used in the field of<br>
telecommunications on physical carriers for both optical<br>
and electronic applications; because of their remarkable<br>
resistance to temperature, abrasion and corrosion, silica<br>
films are used, as an example, in processes typical of the<br>
electronic industry as surface planarizers in a<br>
semiconductor after previous treatments have created off-<br>
plane circuitry. Similar silica films are also used to<br>
produce electrical insulation between intracircuitry<br>
elements or between conductors of different circuits on a<br>
semiconductor chip.<br>
Moreover [A. S. Holmes et al., "Applied Optics", 1/9/1993,<br>
vol.32, n.25, pagg. 4916-4912] , silica films find<br>
applications as antireflexion and as planar wave-guides, or<br>
even as host material for active dopants for nonlinear<br>
optic as well as optical sensing applications.<br>
Many methods were developed for the preparation of optical<br>
devices [A. S. Holmes et al., ibidem], among other, as an<br>
example, can be called the thermic oxidation of silicon, or<br>
the technique of deposition under reduced pressure, known<br>
as "sputtering", chemical vepor deposition, etc.<br>
The technologies to which the above-cited methods refer<br>
are, however, relatively complex and sophisticated, their<br>
practical exploitation require specialized equipment and<br>
time-consuming procedures that result in relatively costly<br>
operations.<br>
Moreover, the limited productivity to which often they are<br>
coupled erodes the convenience for their industrial<br>
application.<br>
It is a consolidated conclusion [A. S. Holmes et al.,<br>
ibidem; Rui M. Almeida, "International Journal of<br>
Optoelectronics", 1994, vol.9, n.2, pagg. 135-142], that the<br>
more promising technology for large scale production of<br>
vitreous films is the sol-gel technology. Such a technology<br>
is based on three fundamental steps:<br>
a. sol formation in alcoholic medium (particle suspension<br>
or dispersion in a liquid),<br>
b. gelation or transformation of sol by condensation into<br>
gel (a solid skeleton inglobating a continuous liquid<br>
phase),<br>
c. drying of the gel.<br>
In the procedure for vitreous film deposition on substrate,<br>
the sol is applied to the surface to be coated and the gel<br>
is formed as consequence of the solvent evaporation; a<br>
drying phase by simple heating complete the coating<br>
procedure.<br>
It is however known that in the production of vitreous<br>
films, even through sol-gel based technology one have to<br>
face limitations, specially in the thickness of the films<br>
obtained and/or in the tendency of such films to crack,<br>
often in the drying phase.<br>
Solutions to the problem were promptly sought and some of<br>
technical answers reported in this field by the scientific<br>
literature and by recent patents, with no doubt contain<br>
preludes to future industrial application. Examples of such<br>
important reports are following:<br>
Italian patent application n. NO 98 A 00004 describes a<br>
sol-gel process for the preparation of thick films of<br>
silicon-dioxide that improves the well-known procedure<br>
by the addition of a certain quantity of fumed silica to<br>
the hydrolysis product of silicon alkoxide.<br>
- A. S Holmes et al. already quoted article describes a<br>
process of high-temperature consolidation of a<br>
multilayers film.<br>
U.S. patent n. 6.130.152 describes a sol-gel process that<br>
teaches to add a combination of two solvents with<br>
different boiling point to the hydrolyzed solution<br>
(tetraethylorthosilane, ethanol, water and acid).<br>
- U.S. patent n. 6.017.389 describes the preparation of<br>
siliceous films starting from the combination of<br>
tetraethylorthosilane and silica in anhydrous ethanol<br>
that is hydrolyzed by aqueous ammonia and necessitate of<br>
a very high thermal treatment at the end.<br>
All the known solutions, of which the precedent paragraphs<br>
are only a few examples, make the sol-gel technology<br>
attractive for the preparation of vitreous films, but do<br>
not offer a fully convenient process for a broad industrial<br>
application either because of the temperature requirements<br>
or because of thickness, or for particular technicalities<br>
that could negatively influence the industriability of the<br>
process.<br>
The Applicant has now found that it is possible to prepare<br>
and to deposit on substrates, according to the sol-gel<br>
technology, vitreous films following a procedure presenting<br>
none of the disadvantages of the known art, nor the<br>
limitations to general applicability so far reported on<br>
count of sol-gel technology.<br>
As a matter of fact it is a first object of the present<br>
invention a process for the preparation and the subsequent<br>
deposition on suitable substrates of vitreous films<br>
comprising the following steps:<br>
Preparation of a solution in an aprotic solvent of one<br>
or more alkoxides having the general formula<br>
Xm - Me - (OR)n-m<br>
where Me is a metal belonging to groups 3°, 4° or 5° of<br>
the Periodic System of the Elements; n is the Me<br>
valence; X is R1 or OR1, with R1 equal to or different<br>
from R, m is zero or an integer number equal to or lower<br>
than 3; R and R1 are hydrocarbon radicals with a number<br>
of carbon atoms up to 12.<br>
Hydrolysis of the obtained solution in the presence of a<br>
catalyst by addition of water.<br>
Eventual removal of the alcohol formed during the<br>
hydrolysis reaction.<br>
Deposition of the sol on the substrate of interest.<br>
Final drying and stabilization of the film characterized<br>
by the fact that the preparation of the sol occurs in an<br>
aprotic medium.<br>
The film deposition can be carried out immediately after<br>
completing thehydrolysis reaction, or the colloidal<br>
dispersion obtained in this phase can be removed, whatever<br>
be the level of hydrolysis reached and stored indefinitely<br>
to be used at a desired time: this peculiar solution is<br>
characteristic of the process of the current invention and<br>
also define the second object, of the invention as just here<br>
stated: to provide a stable sol constituted by the<br>
hydrolysis products of an alkoxide corresponding to the<br>
above-reported formula, dissolved in an aprotic solvent,<br>
from which eventually the alcohol produced by the<br>
hydrolysis itself would have been removed. On this ground<br>
are important aspects of the process of this invention the<br>
following:<br>
simplicity of preparation of the sol composition and<br>
stability thereof in time at room temperature;<br>
easiness of film casting, according to known techniques<br>
executed under mild conditions and with acceptable<br>
times;<br>
rapid gelation times, with film, remaining homogeneous and the<br>
mechanical characteristics of the substrate remaining unchanged;<br>
not need for post-treatments.<br>
As a consequence of such a process the films, also object of the present<br>
invention, are characterized by:<br>
- high adhesion to substrate;<br>
- final shrinking without crackings;<br>
- good mechanical and insulating properties;<br>
good planarization capacity on the substrate surface;<br>
- good optical properties.<br>
Referring to the process for the preparation vitreous films according to the<br>
present invention, in the above alkoxide formula the "metal" can preferably<br>
be silicon and, among all possible alkoxides, particularly suitable to the<br>
purposes of the present invention can be the following:<br>
- tetramethylorthosilicate<br>
- tetraethylorthosilicate<br>
- tetrapropylorthosilicate<br>
- ethyltriethoxysilane<br>
- methyltrimethoxysilane<br>
- methyltriethoxysilane<br>
The alkoxide or mixture of alkoxides can be dissolved in a suitable solvent<br>
and reacted with predetermined amounts of water in the presence of a<br>
catalyst, preferably of acid or<br>
basic character: the reaction can be accomplished, under agitation, at room<br>
temperature, for a time included between few minutes and few hours. The<br>
medium is an aprotic compound and can be preferably chosen among<br>
acetone, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane; the alkoxide can be dissolved in such a<br>
solvent or mixture of solvent at a concentration between 30 and 60% by<br>
weight.<br>
Hydrolysis reaction can be carried out through addition of predetermined<br>
amounts of water, so to maintain the molar ratio H2O/Me between 0.5 to 5,<br>
preferably between 1.5 and 4 and, even more preferably between 2 and 3. s<br>
far s the acid catalyst is concerned, this might be any mineral or organic acid<br>
with Ka between 0.1 and 3.<br>
The basic catalyst can be ammonia, other amines suitable for the control of<br>
pH in the sol, or other suitable to the purpose.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the inventive process, the<br>
hydrolysis can be conducted in the presence of aqueous molar solution of<br>
HCl.<br>
The molar ratio between alkoxides and acid can range from 1/0,001 to 1/1,<br>
but is preferably that such a ratio be maintained between 1/0,1 and 1/0,01.<br>
At the end of the hydrolysis reaction, the product has the appearance of a<br>
clear liquid, free from solid particles due to traces of insoluble gels. It is<br>
possible at this point, according to an original and innovative aspect of the<br>
present invention, to obtain a sol with improved stability by elimination of<br>
the alcohol formed in the hydrolysis reaction.<br>
The removal of the alcohol can be accomplished following any methods<br>
known to the state of the art. To the purpose of exemplification the applicant<br>
reports the experimental event that in the case of ethanol produced by the<br>
hydrolysis reaction, this is removed subjecting the sol to a predetermined<br>
partial desolventization in constant evaporation under reduced pressure,<br>
keeping the colloidal suspension at a temperature of about 40°C.<br>
As previously mentioned, the process according to the present invention can<br>
be interrupted in its course after hydrolysis, thus obtaining a sol that is an<br>
object and an integral part of the present invention, characterized by high<br>
stability and such as to allow its long time storage without deterioration or<br>
contamination by insoluble precipitates that will compromise any further use<br>
thereof. The storage and conservation of such sol can simply be at room<br>
temperature.<br>
The final sol so obtained after the hydrolysis reaction or after storage, is<br>
used for the deposition of the films having the characteristic properties<br>
already described. Deposition on the desired substrate does not present any<br>
particular difficulty and can be carried out according to the various<br>
techniques used in the known art as knife deposition, dip-coating, spin-<br>
coating. An important property of the sol according to the present invention<br>
is that of join to its high shelf stability its short time of gelation once<br>
deposited on the substrate. Referring, as an example, to the deposition for<br>
spin-coating the films are deposited in seconds using rotational speed of the<br>
order of 1500/2500 rpm and they do not any washing or post-treatments. The<br>
coated substrates can be moved immediately because the instant-gelation<br>
makes it solid at the time of removal from the spin-coater. In fact it is an<br>
important property of the film according to the invention to demonstrate<br>
excellent adhesion with regard to the majority of the substrates used in<br>
industry as, for example, silicon semiconductor wafers, gallium arsenide,<br>
polycrystalline silicon, glass, quartz glass etc..<br>
The final drying of the film has the purpose to completely eliminate the<br>
residual solvent from the gel and to complete<br>
the film stabilization; it can be conducted setting the<br>
film-substrates in an oven at temperatures between 80°C and<br>
500°C. The operation is completed in 10-20 minutes time-<br>
span and is occurring without the appearing of<br>
inhomogeneities and defects on the film due to impurities<br>
and or cracking caused by excessive shrinking of the gel in<br>
the drying phase.<br>
According to an alternative embodiment of the inventive<br>
process, separate alkoxide solutions can also be prepared<br>
the same undergoing hydrolysis at different times. The<br>
distinct sols obtains thereby can be used to deposit films<br>
on different samples of the substrate of interest on<br>
different substrates as well as on the same substrate<br>
according to a deposition order suggested by the skillness<br>
or the technological needs, or they can be recombined into<br>
one sol of more integrated properties for better matching<br>
the specifications required in the deposited films.<br>
Finally we should underline that in the process according<br>
to the present invention there are no problems concerning<br>
film-thickness and it is possible to obtain any value of<br>
thickness, between 10 run and 2 nm. The final thickness is<br>
controllable by monitoring concentration of network<br>
precursor into the sol as well alkoxide or alkoxide<br>
mixtures types entered. The Applicant has determined that<br>
alkoxides corresponding to the above formula with X equal<br>
to R1 contribute thickness higher than the ones of the film<br>
obtained via alkoxides where X is equal to OR1: special<br>
formulations of sol that controls film thickness through<br>
the use of different type of alkoxides is not only possible<br>
but, at times very practical within the frame of the<br>
process of the present invention.<br>
In the following are reported some achievements in the<br>
field of present invention only for the purpose of<br>
supplying practical examples without any limitation of the<br>
invention itself to those embodiments.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1:<br>
Preparation of a sol based on tetraethylorthosilicate.<br>
A 11. round flask containing a magnetic stirrer bar is<br>
loaded with 266g of an anhydrous acetone and 156,8g (0,75<br>
moles) of tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS). Keeping the flask<br>
at room temperature, under constant stirring 32,4g of HCl<br>
1M aqueous solution are added by slow dropping (molar ratio<br>
TEOS: H2O: HCl = 1: 2,3: 0,016). The addition of water<br>
requires about 15 minutes. During this time the temperature<br>
rises from 20°C to 40°C.<br>
Stirring of the mixture is maintained for about 15 minutes,<br>
then from what is now a clear liquid a volume of 50c is<br>
collected and stored in a glass container with screw<br>
stopper (Solution A).<br>
With the same procedure an identical round flask is loaded<br>
with 266g of anhydrous ethanol. The same procedure used to<br>
prepare the acetone sol (solution A) is now used to prepare<br>
an analogous sol in ethanol (solution B) both solutions are<br>
left on the laboratory bench.<br>
After 2 days solution B shows clear sign of gelation.<br>
Solution A maintains its original status after 1 month<br>
without any indication of gelation.<br>
Example 2.<br>
266g of anhydrous dioxane and 156, 8g (o,75 moles) of<br>
tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) are loaded on 11. round<br>
flask containing a magnetic stirrer bar. Following the<br>
experimental procedures of example 1, 41,6g of 1M aqueous<br>
HCl are added (molar ratios TEOS: H2O: HCl = 01: 2,32:<br>
0,016) .<br>
After 30 minutes a fraction of liquid (50ml) are removed<br>
from the flask and stored in a glass container with screw<br>
cap and called Solution C. The remaining solution is<br>
transferred to a rotating evaporator and subjected to<br>
evaporation at a reduced pressure (about 100 tor) for about<br>
20 minutes, keeping the internal temperature at 5°C and<br>
collecting about 80ml of evaporated liquid. The evaporation<br>
is interrupted and an equal volume of dioxane added to<br>
replace the ethanol solution removed. The evaporation is<br>
restarted under the same conditions. In parallel, the<br>
concentration of ethanol in the evaporate is determined by<br>
gas chromatography. The operation of evaporation and<br>
replacement of evaporate with dioxane is repeated until the<br>
chromatographic analysis of the collected liquid shows 99%<br>
extraction of ethanol generated in hydrolysis. A sample of<br>
50ml of the sol so treated is transferred to a glass<br>
container with a screw cap and stored as Solution D.<br>
Solution C shows clear signs of gelation after 30 days,<br>
while Solution D maintains its original condition after 365<br>
days without sign of gelation.<br>
Example 3.<br>
177g of anhydrous dioxane, 122g (0,588 moles) of TEOS and<br>
68,4g (0,384moles) of methylthreethylorthosilicate (MTEOS)<br>
are introduced in a 11. round flask.Following the<br>
procedures of example 1, 41,6g of HCl 1M aqueous solution<br>
are added (molar ratios TEOS:: MTEOS: H2O :HCl = 1: 0,65:<br>
2,22: 0,0416). After 30 minutes a fraction of 50ml of the<br>
liquid is removed, stored in a glass bottle with a screw<br>
cup and labeled Solution E. The remaining liquid is set<br>
into a rotating evaporator and evaporated with the<br>
procedures of example 2 completing 3 cycles of evaporation<br>
and dioxane addition.<br>
The chromatographic analysis of the evaporated solvents<br>
indicate that 99% of the ethanol produced in hydrolysis has<br>
been recovered. A sample of 50ml of the liquid remaining in<br>
the evaporator flask (sol) is removed, stored in a glass<br>
bottle with a screw cup and labeled Solution F. Solution E<br>
shows clear signs of gelation after 30 days while solution<br>
F maintains its original condition without signs of<br>
gelation after 365 days.<br>
