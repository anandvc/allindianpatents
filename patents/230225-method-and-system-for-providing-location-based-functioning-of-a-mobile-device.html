				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method and system, product for providing event service based on locations of mobile users<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Mobile communications and computing devices have recently come into<br>
widespread use. These devices provide communications, computing, and<br>
connection capabilities in small, easily transported packages. Examples of such<br>
devices include mobile phones and personal digital assistants (PDAs). A<br>
capability that is becoming available for these devices is a position sensing<br>
capability, which allows the device and/or a communications network to which the<br>
device is connected, to determine the position of the device. The position sensing<br>
capability allows support of the capability for location-based events. A location-<br>
based event is triggered when a location-related characteristic of a mobile user, or<br>
a group mobile of users, as determined by the locations of the users' mobile<br>
devices, satisfies a pre-defined rule. Examples of location-related characteristics<br>
include a location, a velocity, or other location-related activity. For example, a<br>
user might define a rule that when person A enters a particular region and person<br>
B is located within 2 miles of a particular address, a message will be transmitted to<br>
a third person C.<br>
A system that supports location-based events needs to update the locations<br>
of the mobile users of the system. Typically, the locations of the mobile users are<br>
updated based on a fixed, periodic schedule. Periodic updating is used because,<br>
due to the cost and complexity of mobile device location determination, it is very<br>
expensive and difficult to track the locations of mobile users in real-time. A<br><br>
typical mobile network may include thousands or millions of mobile users. A<br>
problem arises in that the network traffic overhead associated with updating<br>
locations of mobile users based on a fixed periodic schedule is very high. A need<br>
arises for a technique that provides updating of locations of mobile users, but<br>
reduces the network traffic overhead as compared with conventional techniques.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention is a method, system, and product<br>
for providing event service based on locations of mobile users. The present<br>
invention provides improved efficiency by using a "location cache" to store recent<br>
location information for mobile users, reducing the need for expensive and time<br>
consuming positioning requests, and by intelligently scheduling times when<br>
location determinations are to be made. The present invention maintains<br>
information about the event conditions and event related users' past locations,<br>
velocities, and other information. A record for an event is created when a<br>
location-based event is registered and expires after the event is triggered. For each<br>
user associated with an event, the system keeps the predicted event time when the<br>
user's location meets the event condition. The predicted event time determines<br>
when the next positioning will be performed. At the predicted time, a positioning<br>
request is sent to obtain an actual location of the mobile user. Depending on the<br>
positioning result, the event management module either triggers the event or<br>
updates the predicted time and the user's past locations. The predicted time is<br>
computed as a function of the users' past locations and velocities information,<br>
destination location information, and the characteristic of the event.<br>
A method for providing location-based event service, according to the<br>
present invention, comprises the steps of: a) obtaining information indicating a<br>
current location of at least one mobile user, the at least one mobile user including a<br>
selected mobile user, b) determining if at least one condition relating to a location of<br>
at least one mobile user is satisfied based on the indicated current location of the at<br><br>
least one mobile user, c) performing at least one event, if at least one condition is<br>
 satisfied, and d) determining a time interval to wait before repeating steps a) - c).<br>
The step of determining a time interval to wait may comprise the steps of<br>
selecting a mobile user that is least likely to cause a condition to be satisfied, and<br>
determining the time interval to wait based on the selected mobile user. The<br>
step of determining a time interval to wait based on the selected mobile user may<br>
comprise the steps of estimating a time at which the selected mobile user is likely to<br>
satisfy a condition based on at least one of: a distance from a current location of the<br>
selected mobile user to a region relevant to the condition, a velocity of the selected<br>
mobile user, and determining the time interval to wait based on the estimated time at<br>
which the selected mobile user is likely to satisfy a condition and a time tolerance.<br>
The obtaining step may comprise the steps of searching a cache operable to store<br>
information indicating locations of mobile users for information indicating a<br>
location of the at least one mobile user, using the information indicating the location<br>
of the at least one mobile user as the information indicating the current location of<br>
the at least one mobile user, if the information indicating the location of the at least<br>
one mobile user is found in the cache, and querying at least one mobile positioning<br>
server to obtain the information indicating the current location of the at least one<br>
mobile user, if the information indicating the location of the at least one mobile user<br>
is not found in the cache.<br>
The at least one event may comprise transmitting a message. The message<br>
may be transmitted to a mobile user or to a non-mobile user. The at least one<br>
condition may relate to a location of one mobile user, the at least one condition may<br>
relate to locations of a plurality of mobile users, or the at least one condition may<br>
relate to a location of a mobile user and to a time.<br><br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
An exemplary block diagram of a network system 100 in which the present<br>
invention may be implemented is shown in Fig. 1. Network system 100 includes<br>
network 102. Network 102 provides communicative interconnection of a plurality<br>
of devices, such as mobile user devices 104A - 104F and network devices 106A -<br>
106C. Network 102 may include both wireless and wireline networks<br>
interconnected as appropriate. The transmission medium in a wireless network is<br>
typically electromagnetic radiation, such as radio waves or light. The transmission<br>
medium in a wireline network is typically copper cable or fiber optic cable.<br><br>
Network 102 may include one or more local area networks (LANs), one or<br>
more wide area networks (WANs), or both LANs and WANs. One or more<br>
networks may be included in network 102 and may include both public networks,<br>
such as the Internet, and private networks and may utilize any networking<br>
technology and protocol, such as Ethernet, Token Ring, Transmission Control<br>
Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), etc. Although not shown in Fig. 1, network<br>
102 may connect, interconnect, or interface with one or more other wireless<br>
networks or with one or more wireline networks.<br>
Mobile user devices 104A - 104F may include any type of mobile electronic<br>
data processing system or communication device that is operated or possessed by a<br>
mobile user of the wireless network. Examples of such electronic data processing<br>
systems include personal computer systems, such as desktop or laptop computers,<br>
personal digital assistants (PDAs), wireless communications devices, such as<br>
cellular telephones, etc. In an embodiment in which the mobile user devices are<br>
computer systems, the computer systems may connect directly to network 102, or the<br>
computer systems may connect indirectly to network 102 through one or more other<br>
networks, gateways, firewalls, etc. In an embodiment in which the mobile user<br>
devices are other types of devices, such as PDAs or wireless communications<br>
devices, the connection to network 102 may be direct or indirect, wired, wireless, or<br>
a combination of wired and wireless, as is appropriate. Typically, the user interface<br>
of mobile user devices 104A - 104F is a graphical user interface, but other interfaces<br>
may be used as well. For example, the client systems may include cellular<br>
telephones communicatively connected to a touch-tone response unit or a voice<br>
response unit, which accepts touch-tone or voice commands and transmits them over<br>
network 102 and which receives responses over network 102, converts the received<br>
responses to audio, and transmits the received responses to the client systems.<br>
Network devices 106A - 106C may include any type of electronic data<br>
processing system or communication device that is operated or possessed by a non-<br>
mobile user of the wireless network. Examples of such electronic data processing<br><br>
systems include servers, routers, switches, bridges, voice or tone response units, etc.<br>
Network devices 106A - 106C may connect directly to network 102, or the they<br>
may connect indirectly to network 102 through one or more other networks,<br>
gateways, firewalls, etc.<br>
Location management system 108 is also communicatively connected to<br>
network 102! Location management system 108 interfaces with network 102 and<br>
with mobile user devices 104A - 104F and network devices 106A - 106C that are<br>
connected to network 102 and provides services based on locations of mobile users,<br>
as determined by mobile user devices operated or possessed by those mobile users.<br>
An exemplary block diagram of a location management system 108, shown<br>
in Fig. 1, is shown in Fig. 2. Location management system 108 is typically a<br>
programmed general-purpose computer system, such as a personal computer,<br>
workstation, server system, and minicomputer or mainframe computer. Location<br>
management system 108 includes one or more processors (CPUs) 202A-202N,<br>
input/output circuitry 204, network adapter 206, and memory 208. CPUs 202A-<br>
202N execute program instructions in order to carry out the functions of the<br>
present invention. Typically, CPUs 202A-202N are one or more microprocessors,<br>
such as an INTEL PENTIUM® processor. Fig. 2 illustrates an embodiment in<br>
which system 108 is implemented as a single multi-processor computer system, in<br>
which multiple processors 202A-202N share system resources, such as memory<br>
208, input/output circuitry 204, and network adapter 206. However, the present<br>
invention also contemplates embodiments in which system 108 is implemented as<br>
a plurality of networked computer systems, which may be single-processor<br>
computer systems, multi-processor computer systems, or a mix thereof.<br>
Input/output circuitry 204 provides the capability to input data to, or output<br>
data from, location management system 108. For example, input/output circuitry<br>
may include input devices, such as keyboards, mice, touchpads, trackballs,<br>
scanners, etc., output devices, such as video adapters, monitors, printers, etc., and<br><br>
input/output devices, such as, modems, etc. Network adapter 206 interfaces<br>
location management system 108 with network 102.<br>
Memory 208 stores program instructions that are executed by, and data that<br>
are used and processed by, CPU 202 to perform the functions of location<br>
management system 108. Memory 208 may include electronic memory devices,<br>
such as random-access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), programmable<br>
read-only memory (PROM), electrically erasable programmable read-only memory<br>
(EEPROM), flash memory, etc., and electro-mechanical memory, such as<br>
magnetic disk drives, tape drives, optical disk drives, etc., which may use an<br>
integrated drive electronics (IDE) interface, or a variation or enhancement thereof,<br>
such as enhanced IDE (EIDE) or ultra direct memory access (UDMA), or a small<br>
computer system interface (SCSI) based interface, or a variation or enhancement<br>
thereof, such as fast-SCSI, wide-SCSI, fast and wide-SCSI, etc, or a fiber channel-<br>
arbitrated loop (FC-AL) interface.<br>
Memory 208 includes event management module 210, location acquisition<br>
module 212, mobile applications 214A and 214B, and operating system 216.<br>
Event management module 210 manages locations of mobile users and event<br>
conditions that are defined based on the locations of the mobile users in order to<br>
carry out the location-based event processing of the present invention. Location<br>
acquisition module 212 communicates with systems that determine the locations of<br>
mobile devices operated or possessed by mobile users to obtain information<br>
indicating the locations of the mobile users. Mobile applications 214A and 214B<br>
perform other location based processing. Operating system 216 provides overall<br>
system functionality. Location acquisition module 212 includes location cache<br>
218, which provides caching of location information for improved performance of<br>
the system.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, the present invention contemplates implementation on a<br>
system or systems that provide multi-processor, multi-tasking, multi-process,<br>
and/or multi-thread computing, as well as implementation on systems that provide<br><br>
********only single processor, single thread computing. Multi-processor computing<br>
involves performing computing using more than one processor. Multi-tasking<br>
computing involves performing computing using more than one operating system<br>
task. A task is an operating system concept that refers to the combination of a<br>
program being executed and bookkeeping information used by the operating<br>
system. Whenever a program is executed, the operating system creates a new task<br>
for it. The task is like an envelope for the program in that it identifies the program<br>
with a task number and attaches other bookkeeping information to it. Many<br>
operating systems, including UNIX®, OS/2®, and WINDOWS®, are capable of<br>
running many tasks at the same time and are called multitasking operating<br>
systems. Multi-tasking is the ability of an operating system to execute more than<br>
one executable at the same time. Each executable is running in its own address<br>
space, meaning that the executables have no way to share any of their memory.<br>
This has advantages, because it is impossible for any program to damage the<br>
execution of any of the other programs running on the system. However, the<br>
programs have no way to exchange any information except through the operating<br>
system (or by reading files stored on the file system). Multi-process computing is<br>
similar to multi-tasking computing, as the terms task and process are often used<br>
interchangeably, although some operating systems make a distinction between the<br>
two.<br>
An exemplary block diagram of the interaction of processing modules<br>
included in location management system 108, which are shown in Fig. 2, is shown<br>
in Fig. 3. Location management system 108 acquires location information related<br>
to mobile users, stores and manages that information, and determines whether<br>
location-based conditions that have been defined have been satisfied using the<br>
location information. Location management system 108 includes location<br>
acquisition module 212, event management module 210, and may include other<br>
mobile applications, such as mobile applications 214A and 214B. Location<br>
acquisition module 212 includes location cache 218 and communicates with<br><br>
mobile positioning servers 310 over network 102. Event management module 210<br>
requests location information about mobile users whose locations are being<br>
tracked from location acquisition module 212. When a position request comes<br>
into location acquisition module 212, location cache 218 is searched first for<br>
information with which to fill the request. The cached information may include<br>
information such as an ID of a mobile device operated by or in the possession of<br>
the mobile user, information relating to past locations of the mobile user, such as<br>
the past n positions of the mobile device, and other location related information.<br>
When an item is found in the cache in response to a request, it is<br>
determined whether the item is too stale to use. Each cache item will expire after<br>
certain amount of time, which is a heuristic function of the velocity of a user, past<br>
positions of the user, and application specified quality of location parameters. If<br>
information with which to fill the request is found in location cache 218, the<br>
cached information will be returned and real position sensing will not be<br>
performed. If information with which to fill the request is not found in location<br>
cache 218, real position sensing will be performed and location cache 218 will be<br>
updated with the obtained information.<br>
Mobile positioning servers 310 communicate with mobile devices, typically<br>
over a wireless network, and obtain information indicating positions of the mobile<br>
devices. If information with which to fill the request is not found in location<br>
cache 218, location acquisition module 212 requests location information about<br>
mobile users whose locations are being tracked from mobile positioning servers<br>
310.<br>
Once information needed to fill the request is obtained, location cache 212<br>
transmits the information to event management module 210, and may also transmit<br>
the information to other mobile applications, such as mobile applications 214A<br>
and 214B. Event management module 210 uses the received information to<br>
determine whether a location-based condition defined for a particular mobile user<br><br>
has been satisfied. If so, event management module 210 triggers the performance<br>
of an event.<br>
The event management module 210 is organized on top of the location<br>
acquisition module 212. It maintains the information about the event condition<br>
and event related users' past positions, velocities, and other information. A record<br>
for an event is created when a location-based event is registered and expires after<br>
the event is triggered. For each user associated with an event, the system keeps<br>
the predicted event time when the user's location meets the event condition. The<br>
predicted event time determines when the next positioning will be performed with<br>
an initial value that is guaranteed to be before the real event time. At the predicted<br>
time, a positioning request is sent to the positioning module of the system.<br>
Depending on the positioning result, the event management module 210 either<br>
triggers the event or updates the predicted time and the user's past positions. The<br>
predicted time is computed as a function of the users' past positions and velocities<br>
information, destination location information, the intervals between previous<br>
predicted event times and the characteristic of the event.<br>
An exemplary flow diagram of a process 400 of operation of location<br>
acquisition module 212, shown in Fig. 3, is shown in Fig. 4. It is best viewed in<br>
conjunction with Fig. 5, which is an exemplary data flow diagram of operation of<br>
location acquisition module 300. Process 400 begins with step 402, in which a<br>
~ current location of a mobile user is obtained. Event management module 210<br>
requests location information about mobile users whose locations are being<br>
tracked from location acquisition module 212. When a position request comes<br>
into location acquisition module 212, location cache 218 is searched first for<br>
information with which to fill the request. The cached information may include<br>
information such as an ID of a mobile device operated by or in the possession of<br>
the mobile user, information relating to past locations of the mobile user, such as<br>
the past n positions of the mobile device, and other location related information.<br><br>
Each cache item will expire after certain amount of time, which is a<br>
heuristic function of the velocity of a user and past positions of the user. If<br>
information with which to fill the request is found in location cache 218, real<br>
position sensing will not be performed. Instead, the cached information, such as a<br>
previous position of the mobile user, or information based on cached information,<br>
such as an extrapolated position computed as a function of previous positions and<br>
velocities, will be returned. If information with which to fill the request is not<br>
found in location cache 218, location cache transmits a position request to mobile<br>
positioning servers 310. Position request 502 includes information identifying one<br>
or more mobile users and/or mobile devices operated or possessed by mobile<br>
users. If position request 502 includes information identifying a mobile user, that<br>
information is translated into information identifying a mobile device. Mobile<br>
positioning servers 310 communicates with the identified mobile device, typically<br>
over a wireless network, and obtains information indicating a position of the<br>
mobile device. Mobile positioning servers 310 transmit position result 504, which<br>
includes information indicating a position of the mobile device, to location cache<br>
218. Position result 504 typically includes position information in the form of<br>
latitude and longitude of the mobile device.<br>
Location cache 212 caches location information included in position result<br>
504 and transmits the location information to event management module 210<br>
In step 404, event management module 210 uses tiie location information to<br>
determine whether any event conditions that have been defined for the mobile user<br>
for which location information has been obtained have been satisfied. Event<br>
management module 210 maintains information about the event condition and the<br>
information related to mobile users associated with the event, such as past<br>
locations of the mobile users, velocities of the mobile users, and other information.<br>
A record or entry for an event is created in an event database when a location-<br>
based event is registered. The record expires after the event condition is satisfied<br>
and the event is triggered. The information in position result 504 is compared to<br><br>
location-based event conditions that have been defined. For example, a condition<br>
might be defined as: within two miles of a particular address. To perform the<br>
comparison, the latitude and longitude of the address is obtained from a commonly<br>
available geocoding service or database, and the distance between the latitude and<br>
longitude of the address and the latitude and longitude included in position result<br>
504 is easily computed. If the distance is less than two miles, the condition is<br>
satisfied. Conditions of any required complexity may be defined and evaluated by<br>
the present invention. For example, in addition to conditions that are based only<br>
on location, conditions that are based on time or on the combination of time and<br>
location may also be defined. An example of such a condition might be defined<br>
as: within two miles of a particular address after 2:00 P.M. today.<br>
In step 406, if it is determined that an event condition was satisfied, then<br>
process 400 continues with step 408, in which defined event processing is<br>
performed. The event processing may be as complex as is required, but typically<br>
involves transmission of one or more messages to one or more parties. For<br>
example, if it is determined that a mobile user is within two miles of a particular<br>
address, a message may be transmitted to that address including information to<br>
that effect. This, for example, might be used to indicate that a party has almost<br>
arrived at a destination and that those at that destination can expect the party to<br>
arrive shortly. Likewise, a message may be transmitted to one or more other<br>
parties, informing those parties of the satisfaction of the condition.<br>
In step 410, post-processing of the event occurs.<br>
If, in step 406, it is determined that no event condition was satisfied, then<br>
process 400 continues with step 412, in which a predicted time for the next<br>
location update is determined. Event management module 210 maintains<br>
information about the event condition and the information related to mobile users<br>
associated with the event, such as past locations of the mobile users, velocities of<br>
the mobile users, and other information. A record or entry for an event is created<br>
in an event database when a location-based event is registered. The record expires<br><br>
after the event condition is satisfied and the event is triggered. For each mobile<br>
user associated with an event, the event management module 210 determines and<br>
maintains a predicted event time, which is a time at which it is predicted that the<br>
location of a mobile user will satisfy an event condition. The predicted event time<br>
is used to determine the next request for the location of the mobile user will be<br>
transmitted. The predicted time is adjusted to ensure that the location request will<br>
occur before the event condition is actually satisfied, so that event condition<br>
satisfaction is not missed or delated.<br>
For example, a location and velocity of a mobile user may be used to<br>
determine a predicted time as follows. The distance between the mobile user's<br>
location and the closest location included in an event condition with which the<br>
mobile user is associated is determined. This distance is then divided by the<br>
velocity of the mobile user to determine a minimum time that it will be before the<br>
mobile user's location could satisfy the event condition. The minimum time may<br>
be reduced to ensure that the location request will occur before the event condition<br>
is actually satisfied. The minimum time is then added to the current time to<br>
determine the predicted time.<br>
In step 414, the process wait until the predicted time, then loops back to<br>
step 402, in which a location update is performed.<br>
An exemplary flow diagram of a sub-process of step 412, in which the<br>
predicted time is determined, is shown in Fig. 6. The sub-process of step 412<br>
begins with step 602, in which it is determined whether the correct mobile user is<br>
being tracked. The correct mobile user to track for a given event condition is the<br>
mobile user least likely to cause the event conditions associated with that mobile<br>
user to be satisfied. For example, this may be the mobile user farthest from a<br>
relevant region, the slowest moving mobile user, etc. If the mobile user least<br>
likely to satisfy the event condition first is not selected for tracking, then in step<br>
604, the mobile user that is least likely to satisfy the event condition first is<br>
selected for tracking. The process then continues with step 606. If, in step 602, it<br><br>
is determined that the mobile user least likely to satisfy the event condition first is<br>
selected for tracking, then the process continues directly to step 606.<br>
In step 606, the selected mobile user is tracked and the predicted time for<br>
location updates is set based on that selected user. The predicted time is<br>
determined using a heuristic function. For example, the heuristic function may be<br>
based on the distance from the selected mobile user's current position to the<br>
relevant region, the velocity of the selected mobile user, including the speed and<br>
the direction in which the selected mobile user is moving, the selected mobile<br>
user's past positions, and a time tolerance. In some instances, such as when a<br>
mobile user is close to the destination, the heuristic function may be a simple<br>
calculation, while in other cases, such as when the mobile user is far from the<br>
destination, the heuristic function must be enhanced to cover changes in the<br>
mobile user's travel may occur. For example, for a mobile user that is 1000 miles<br>
away from a destination and traveling at 50 miles per hour, a simple calculation<br>
would yield a predicted time of 20 hours. However, this should not be used as the<br>
predicted time since the mobile user's travel may change - the mobile user may<br>
take a flight and arrive at the destination much sooner. Thus, it is advantageous to<br>
use a lower bound for velocity when the mobile user is far from the destination, so<br>
the the predicted time will not be too late.<br>
The time tolerance specifies the amount of inaccuracy in detection of<br>
satisfaction of a condition that can be tolerated. In other words, for a given time<br>
tolerance t, detection of satisfaction of an event condition must occur within time t<br>
after the event condition is satisfied. For example, if the time tolerance is set to 10<br>
minutes, and the condition is a mobile user entering a region, then the system must<br>
detect that the mobile user has entered the region within 10 minutes after the<br>
mobile user actually enters the region. The time tolerance may be either a system-<br>
wide default or the time tolerance may be specified by the mobile user for a<br>
specific event.<br><br>
When the selected mobile user is far from the region, or is moving slowly,<br>
or both, then the estimated time for the selected mobile user to enter the region is<br>
large and the computed time interval until the predicted time are correspondingly<br>
large. When the selected mobile user is close to the region, or is moving quickly,<br>
or both, then the estimated time for the selected mobile user to enter the region is<br>
small and the computed time interval until the predicted time are correspondingly<br>
small. However, when the computed time intervals become less than the time<br>
tolerance, the time intervals are set to the time tolerance, rather than to the smaller<br>
computed value. This improves system performance by reducing the number of<br>
position requests, yet it still ensures detection of the satisfaction of the condition<br>
within the time tolerance.<br>
A simple case is where a single user enters or leaves a region. In reality, a<br>
location-based event may have a complicated condition. For example, one mobile<br>
user enters a region, one mobile user leaves a region, multiple mobile users are<br>
within a region, multiple mobile users are outside a region, a mobile user<br>
enters/leaves a region when other mobile users are within the region, etc.<br>
Different conditions can further be combined together by Boolean operations.<br>
However, at any given time, a complex condition can be evaluated by evaluating<br>
the location of a single mobile user.<br>
Consider the following event condition as an example:<br>
When three mobile users A, B and C are all located within California, send<br>
a message to D.<br>
Assume the event is registered at 1pm. If at that time the condition is already<br>
satisfied, then the event is triggered and we are done. Otherwise, there must be at<br>
least one mobile user outside California. Let's assume A and B are already inside<br>
and C is outside. Then instead of keeping track of the positions of all three mobile<br>
users, it is only necessary to track C. In this case, C is determined to be the mobile<br><br>
user least likely to satisfy the condition first, and C is selected as the mobile user<br>
to track.<br>
Suppose at 4pm, C enters California. Within the 3 hours, the location of C<br>
was determined 10 times, with the first 5 position requests having large time<br>
intervals between them because C was unlikely to arrive quickly. The last 5<br>
positioning requests have a fixed interval equal to the time tolerance because C is<br>
approaching the destination. But within these 3 hours, the locations of A and B<br>
are never determined by the event system. When the selected mobile user, C,<br>
satisfies the condition by entering California, the system obtains the locations of<br>
all three mobile users to determine whether the complete condition is satisfied. If<br>
the condition is met (all three are in California) then the event is triggered. If the<br>
condition is not met, then A or B or both must be outside California. Again, the<br>
mobile user that is least likely to satisfy the condition first is selected for tracking.<br>
Even if the mobile user that is selected for tracking enters the region before other<br>
mobile users, the event is still detected correctly. The system may make more<br>
positioning requests than would have been necessary had the "correct" mobile user<br>
been selected for tracking, but the event is still detected correctly.<br>
The process shown in Fig. 4 repeats until the event is triggered or is deleted<br>
from the system by the administrator or user. In the example above, the complete<br>
event condition can be stated as a conjunction of three condition elements: A is in<br>
California, B is in California and C is in California. For this type of condition, in<br>
which the condition elements are ANDed together, only one mobile user must be<br>
tracked and the condition is the mobile user either entering or leaving a region. If<br>
condition elements within a complicated condition are ORed together, then the<br>
condition elements can be treated as multiple events with the same action. For<br>
example, if a condition is:<br>
When A or B enters California, send message to D,<br><br>
then the event can be treated as two separate events: (1) When A enters California,<br>
send message to D and (2) When B enters California, send message to D. Both<br>
mobile users must be tracked, as this condition is really two separate events. Each<br>
of these conditions depend upon a single user entering/leaving a region. Once one<br>
of these event is triggered, the overall condition is satisfied and it no longer<br>
necessary to track the other event or events, which should then be removed.<br>
A mobile user moving toward a region R is shown in Fig. 7. The current<br>
distance of the mobile user from the region is D and velocity is v. Here D is the<br>
shortest distance between the mobile user and the region and it does not consider<br>
the direction of the movement. The event has a time tolerance t. A vector p is<br>
used to represent the user's past n positions. The heuristic function, which outputs<br>
a time interval for determining a predicted time, can then be described as: T = f(D,<br>
v, p, t). It is to be noted that D may also be taken as a heuristic involving the<br>
location and velocity of the user and the target region. Thus, D may be defined as:<br>
D = h(R, 1, v), where R is the target region, 1 is the location of the user, and v is the<br>
velocity of the user.<br>
