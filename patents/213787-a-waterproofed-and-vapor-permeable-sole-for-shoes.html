				<td>WATERPROOFED VAPOR-PERMEABLE SOLE FOR SHOES<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a waterproofed vapor-permeable sole for<br>
shoes.<br>
Background Art<br>
It is known that the main problem noted when using shoes provided with<br>
an ordinary sole made of natural material such as leather or the like is<br>
constituted by wet environments.<br>
When rain and bad weather cause the streets to be wet and slippery, it is<br>
in fact not advisable to use shoes with a leather sole, since leather, indeed<br>
because of its characteristic of being vapor-permeable and healthy for the<br>
foot, is not impermeable but indeed absorbs water.<br>
The thinner the leather, the faster it becomes impregnated with water or<br>
moisture until it wets the user"s foot<br>
Another drawback is that the leather tread is not patterned but is smooth<br>
or sometimes even polished with waxes.<br>
This is a further problem in wet environments; since grip is unsteady in<br>
such conditions.<br>
Accordingly, the use of soles with a leather tread is constrained by<br>
weather conditions, and therefore shoes having this type of material are<br>
mainly provided in summer collections by shoe manufacturers.<br>
An attempt to obviate this drawback has been made by inserting between<br>
the leather tread and the foot resting region an element made of<br>
polyurethane or PVC, which element however inhibits vapor permeation<br>
and relegates the use of leather to a purely aesthetic matter.<br>
A sole, disclosed in EP-0 619 959 by the same Applicant, has also been<br>
devised which comprises a tread made of leather or similar material which is<br>
at least partially covered, in an upward region, by a membrane made of a<br>
material which is permeable to vapor and impermeable to water.<br>
The thread is then assembled at least peripherally with at least one upper<br><br>
part made of rubber or similar material which has a plurality of through<br>
holes at least in the regions affected by the membrane.<br>
Although it is a considerable technical step forward, since the leather<br>
tread is waterproofed, such sole has drawbacks, the main one being the very<br>
nature of leather, which is a vapor-permeable material, as mentioned, but<br>
whose perspiration degree is not high enough to rapidly dissipate all the<br>
heat and vapor that form during use inside the shoe.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The aim of the present invention is to further improve the vapor-<br>
permeability of a sole made of leather or the like waterproofed according to<br>
the method disclosed in EP-0 619 959.<br>
A consequent primary object of the present invention is to provide a sole<br>
which also has good ground grip characteristics in all operating conditions.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a sole which also has shock-<br>
proof characteristics.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a sole which has the same<br>
features as currently commercially available soles having a leather tread.<br>
Another object of the invention is to increase user comfort<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a sole which can be<br>
manufactured at low cost and therefore can be sold at a competitive price.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a sole which can be<br>
manufactured with known equipment and methods.<br>
This aim and these and other objects which will become better apparent<br>
hereinafter are achieved by a waterproofed and vapor-permeable sole for<br>
shoes, characterized in that it comprises a tread which is made of leather or<br>
similar material and is at least partially covered in an upward region by a<br>
membrane made of a material which is permeable to vapor and impermeable<br>
to water and is sealed in its peripheral regions with respect to said tread,<br>
said tread having through holes in which inserts made of plastic material<br>
such as rubber or the like are assembled hermetically, said inserts in turn<br><br>
having through holes.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
Further characteristics and advantages of the invention will become<br>
better apparent from the following detailed description of an embodiment<br>
thereof, illustrated only by way of non-limitative example in the<br>
accompanying drawings, wherein:<br>
Figure 1 is a plan bottom view of a sole according to the invention;<br>
Figure 2 is a transverse sectional view of the sole of Figure 1, taken<br>
along the line II-II<br>
Wavs of carrying out the Invention<br>
With reference to the figures, a waterproofed and vapor-permeable sole<br>
according to the invention is generally designated by the reference numeral<br>
10 and comprises a tread 11 which is made of leather or similar material and<br>
is covered in an upward region, substantially in a plantar region, by a<br>
membrane 12 which is impermeable to water and permeable to vapor and is<br>
preferably made of a material such as the one commonly known as Gore-<br>
Tex.<br>
In this case, the membrane 12 is peripherally spaced from the edge of the<br>
tread 11, and a peripheral upper trim 13 made of rubber, polyurethane, PVC<br>
or other equivalent material is assembled on the tread 11, for example by<br>
injection in a mold, covering and sealing the peripheral regions of the<br>
membrane 12 and leaving a large central opening in which the membrane is<br>
visible.<br>
As an alternative, the membrane 12 can have the same dimensions as the<br>
tread 11 and its edge can be sealed along the entire perimeter therewith by<br>
means of appropriate adhesive of the hot-melt type, based on water or<br>
solvents or the like.<br>
This is done to allow the upward fixing of the welt and of the upper.<br>
The membrane 12 constitutes a water barrier yet preserving the vapor-<br>
permeability characteristics of the leather.<br><br>
According to the invention, the tread 11 has through holes 14 in which<br>
inserts 15 made of rubber or similar material are assembled, for example by<br>
injection in a mold; the inserts also form antislip and wear-preventing<br>
protrusions 15a underneath the tread 11.<br>
The inserts 15 are shaped so as to provide undercuts which are adapted to<br>
avoid their disassembly from the tread 11.<br>
In the present case, the configuration from the top downward provides<br>
for widths which decrease and then increase.<br>
The inserts 15 are further provided with through holes 16 which connect<br>
the region below the membrane 12 to the region below the tread 11.<br>
This is done in order to improve the vapor-permeation action of the<br>
material that constitutes the tread 11.<br>
It can be convenient to arrange at least one vapor-permeable protective<br>
layer 17, such as felt or the like, at upper outlets of the holes 16, so as to<br>
protect the membrane 12 against blunt bodies such as pebbles or the like,<br>
which can penetrate and spoil it<br>
It should also be noted that it may be advisable to arrange over the<br>
membrane 12 a vapor-permeable or perforated protective layer 20, such as<br>
felt, light jersey, non-woven fabric or the like.<br>
This layer is a rather flimsy film which requires adequate protection in<br>
order to be treated or otherwise assembled with the other components of the<br>
sole 10.<br>
In practice it has been observed that the intended aim and objects of the<br>
invention have been achieved.<br>
The sole in fact has improved qualitative characteristics in terms of vapor<br>
permeation with respect to waterproofed leather soles, thanks to the<br>
presence of the holes 16, and also features antislip characteristics due to the<br>
presence of the inserts 15 with protrusions 15a in which the holes 16 are<br>
provided.<br>
It should also be noted that it can be manufactured without particular<br><br>
difficulties with ordinary manufacturing methods.<br>
The invention thus conceived is susceptible of numerous modifications<br>
and variations, all of which are within the scope of the inventive concept.<br>
All the details may furthermore be replaced with other technically<br>
equivalent elements.<br>
In practice, the materials employed, so long as they are compatible with<br>
the contingent use, as well as the dimensions, may be any according to<br>
requirements.<br>
