				<td>SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR PROMOTING INTRINSIC CONDUCTION<br>
THROUGH ATRIAL TIMING<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to medical devices and more specifically to<br>
implantable medical devices.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
There are a variety of medical devices that sense data, provide diagnostic<br>
information, and/or deliver therapy. When such a device is implantable (in whole or in<br>
part), it is referred to as an implantable medical device (IMD). In the present application,<br>
"IMD" refers to devices that sense cardiac events and deliver pacing therapy. Such<br>
devices may or may not also include other functions such as defibrillation therapy (e.g.,<br>
implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)), other monitoring capabilities, alternate<br>
cardiac therapies, or non-cardiac monitoring and/or therapies. Thus, the term pacemaker<br>
may be used interchangeably with IMD in the present context with the understanding that<br>
either term may refer to a device with capabilities beyond those required of a pacemaker<br>
alone.<br>
Recently, there has been a recognition that intrinsic conduction and ventricular<br>
depolarization, even if somewhat prolonged, is preferable to ventricular pacing;<br>
particularly pacing in or near the right ventricular apex. In general, this preference results<br>
from the unnatural propagation of a depolarization wavefront that is generated from such a<br>
pacing pulse (as compared to intrinsic depolarization).<br>
Previous pacing modes tend to operate at one extreme or another. For example, in<br>
a true, single chamber AAI/R device, atrial pacing and sensing is possible, but no ability to<br>
provide ventricular pacing (or sensing) exists. On the other hand, DDD/R has historically<br>
been the default selection for dual chamber devices. The DDD/R mode will operate to<br>
maintain AV synchrony; however, the AV delay is necessarily such that intrinsic<br>
conduction is precluded in most cardiac cycles. This results in ventricular pacing in a very<br>
high percentage of cardiac cycles.<br>
The present assignee has developed new modes that promote intrinsic conduction<br>
and are referred to herein generally as ventricular pacing protocols (VPP). One such VPP<br>
 <br>
is Managed Ventricular Pacing™ (or MVP TM) which is commercially available. A<br>
variety of VPP embodiments have previously been described, for example, as in U.S. Pat.<br>

No. 11/257,643, filed October 25, 2005, (Atty. Docket No. P21974.00).<br>
As a generalized explanation, a VPP operates in an atrial based pacing mode to<br>
promote intrinsic conduction. Ventricular events are sensed and as long as a ventricular<br>
event is sensed in a given cardiac cycle (e.g., A-A interval) the device continues to operate<br>
in the atrial based pacing mode. This allows for ventricular sensing during the entire A-A<br>
interval. Conversely, if there is no ventricular event, the device provides a ventricular<br>
backup pace in the subsequent cycle, timed from the atrial event (paced or sensed) that<br>
initiates this subsequent cardiac cycle. Thus, in a VPP it is possible to have an entire<br>
cardiac cycle devoid of ventricular activity while ultimately maintaining AV synchrony.<br>
There are, of course, many variations and embodiments provided that are not described<br>
herein for the sake of brevity. It should be appreciated that operation in an atrial based<br>
pacing mode includes mode switching a device into such a mode (e.g. AA1/R, AD1/R) and<br>
into a mode that provides ventricular pacing (e.g., DDI/R, DDD/R, VVI/R, etc.) as<br>
necessary and potentially on a beat by beat basis or alternatively, operation in a complex<br>
mode that includes more comprehensive behavior (e.g., FIDDI) without necessitating<br>
mode switching to achieve the functionality described.<br>
One benefit of a VPP is that the protocol may be initiated with patients regardless<br>
of the status of their AV conduction. Those having intact or partially intact conduction<br>
will benefit in that conduction is promoted and ventricular pacing is reduced or eliminated.<br>
 <br>
For those patients with heart block, the VPP will quickly move to provide ventricular<br>
pacing and periodically check to determine if conduction has returned. Both in initially<br>
recognizing the need to pace and performing the conduction checks, the methodology<br>
employed is transparent to the patient.<br>
As previously indicated physicians implanting a dual chamber device often utilize<br>
nominal settings and program the device to DDD/R due to its simplicity. The VPP allows<br>
for the same type of comprehensive reliability across patient profiles and without the need<br>
to program numerous parameters upon implant. The VPPs are preferable in that that they<br>
reduce or minimize ventricular pacing when intact conduction is present.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
FIG. 1 is a schematic illustration of an implantable medical device (IMD) 10<br>
having pacing capabilities. While not illustrated, IMD 10 may also include a variety of<br>
other monitoring, diagnostic and therapeutic functions. Further, FIG. 1 is not meant to<br>
comprehensively illustrate all components of an implantable pacemaker.<br>
The IMD 10 includes a housing 12 that contains a microprocessor 14, memory 16,<br>
a power supply (e.g., battery) 18, a communication module 20 that facilitates telemetry to<br>
an external device and a pulse generator 22 for generating pacing pulses. A sensor<br>
interface 30 is provided to collect data from one or more sensors/electrodes, one or more<br>
of which may be disposed on leads 32, 34. The pacing stimuli generated by the pulse<br>
generator 22 is deliverable via the leads 32, 34. Also illustrated in FIG. 1 is a VPP module<br>
24. It should be appreciated that these functions may be algorithms stored in the memory<br>
16 or incorporated into other hardware, software, or firmware.<br>
In operation, the IMD 10 senses cardiac events and provides an appropriate<br>
response. Most typically, cardiac events are sensed via electrodes on the leads 32, 34.<br>
These electrodes pick up electrical signals indicative of specific activities within the heart,<br>
typically represented as an electrogram (EGM) when generated from device data or an<br>
electrocardiogram (ECG) when based upon surface collected data. As is well known, the<br>
cardiac cycle includes an atrial depolarization represented electrically by a P wave,<br>
ventricular depolarization represented by the QRS complex, and repolarization represented<br>
by a T wave. While sensing algorithms can be relatively complex, in general a sensed P<br>
wave indicates intrinsic atrial depolarization while a sensed R wave indicates intrinsic<br>
ventricular depolarization. For a given pacing mode, if a P wave or R wave is not sensed<br>
within a predetermined time frame, then the IMD 10 provides atrial or ventricular pacing<br>
with appropriate timing, if supported by that mode. There are numerous variations to this<br>
generalization such as overdrive pacing or various tachycardia pacing therapies. The main<br>
point herein is that the IMD 10 senses data and responds in some fashion to that data.<br>
As discussed, the present invention relates to an IMD 10 that selectively operates<br>
according to a VPP, such as for example, the MVP™ mode. There arc many variations<br>
among the various VPPs and for the sake of clarity not every variation will be separately<br>
described. FIG. 2A illustrates a ladder diagram with sample timing data. The specific<br>
example relates to how a premature ventricular contraction (PVC) is addressed under one<br>
 <br>
of the current VPPs; however, this diagram will also be used to explain the basic operation<br>
of a VPP.<br>
The nomenclature presented will be consistently used throughout this description.<br>
In each diagram, the atrial channel (A) and ventricular channel (V) are illustrated. Events<br>
are indicated relative to one another according to time. In each example, atrial pacing<br>
(AP) is presumed with an A-A interval of 1000 ms. It should be appreciated that intrinsic<br>
atrial events (AS) may occur and are accounted for; however, they are not discussed in<br>
these examples. At time Tl an atrial pace (AP) is delivered. At time T2, the atrial event<br>
has conducted and intrinsic ventricular depolarization occurs (VS). The time between the<br>
AP and the VS is the AV delay. While the timing of the AP is known, the VS occurs<br>
naturally, thus, while expectations and averages may apply, the precise timing of the VS<br>
and the duration of the AV delay are not known until they occur. At time T3, the next AP<br>
is delivered; as indicated above the A-A interval is 1000 ms. The VA interval is the time<br>
from the VS to the AP (T3).<br>
At time T4, a premature ventricular contraction (PVC) occurs. A PVC is any<br>
sensed ventricular event that is not triggered by a properly conducted atrial event or may<br>
be a properly conducted ventricular event resulting from a premature atrial contraction<br>
(which still leads to a ventricular event that is premature in overall timing). Thus, even<br>
though the PVC occurs after the AP at T4, it is effectively "too early" to be a proper<br>
ventricular event and is therefore considered a PVC. Nonetheless, the PVC is a<br>
ventricular event / ventricular depolarization. As such, the time from the VS to the PVC is<br>
referred to herein as the first V-V interval (V-V (1)). With the caveat that intrinsic<br>
ventricular events may vary, if the A-A interval is steady at 1000 ms the V-V interval<br>
(absent PVC's, conduction block, or other abnormalities) should also be approximately<br>
1000 ms. Another type of PVC may also occur and would<br>
Departing from the example for a moment, if the illustrated PVC were a properly<br>
conducted VS (i.e., occurring later in the cycle), then V-V (1) would likely have been<br>
about 1000 ms. The next AP would occur as illustrated at time T5; followed most likely<br>
by an intrinsic ventricular event rather than the illustrated VP. In other words, this is how<br>
the VPP would work if events were normal. In general, any sensed ventricular event<br>
occurring during any portion of a given A-A interval satisfies the criteria to continue<br>
normal operation. The exception to this is a PVC as will be explained in detail. Only<br>
 <br>
when a complete cycle (A-A interval) is devoid of proper ventricular sensed events, will<br>
the next cycle include ventricular pacing.<br>
In this example, the PVC occurs during a defined crosstalk window. That is, a<br>
period of time following the AP where sensed ventricular events are effectively ignored (at<br>
least the first such occurrence). Thus, for purposes of the VPP, the PVC at time T4 is<br>
ignored and is effectively equivalent to not having a sensed a ventricular event occurring<br>
in the A-A interval between times T3 and T5. As such, the response of the VPP is the<br>
same in either instance (no V event or early PVC). That is, the A-A interval (T3 - T5) is<br>
deemed devoid of ventricular activity. Thus, in the next A-A interval (T5 - T7), a<br>
ventricular "backup" pace (VP) is delivered at time T6. In this example, in the cycle<br>
beginning with the AP at time T7, conduction returns and the VS occurs at time T8. If<br>
conduction had not returned, various options arc available based upon the specific VPP<br>
embodiment. Such options would include, for example, conduction checks, and operation<br>
in a dual chamber pacing mode for various amounts of time.<br>
Returning to the specific example illustrated, when the PVC occurs and is ignored<br>
under the current VPP, certain issues arise. That is, although the PVC is ignored as a<br>
ventricular event, it does depolarize the ventricles, although at a less than optimal time and<br>
with less than an optimal contraction. Again, in normal timing, V-V intervals (in this<br>
example) should be approximately 1000 ms. Here, because of the PVC, the V-V timing is<br>
1000 ms in the cycle prior to Tl (not illustrated), 800 ms for V-V(l), 1050 ms for V-V(2),<br>
and then about 1000 ms for V-V(3). This sequence is normal, short, long, normal.<br>
Furthermore, the long duration (or "pause" as used herein) following the short duration is<br>
terminated with a ventricular pacing pulse. While this mode of operation is generally<br>
appropriate, there is some belief that this type of pattern, particularly when terminated<br>
with a ventricular pace may be proarrhythmic in a small patient population. This theory is<br>
widely disputed and its validity is not known. However, the present invention provides<br>
mechanisms to minimize this scenario if there is in fact validity to the concern.<br>
In a first embodiment of the present invention, illustrated in FIG. 2B, the timing of<br>
the events is substantially the same as that of FIG. 2A. The distinction here is that the<br>
PVC, despite occurring in the crosstalk window is considered as a ventricular event; thus,<br>
a ventricular pace is not provided in the next cycle (T5). Rather, intrinsic conduction<br>
occurs and a VS is noted at time T6. The V-V variation is approximately the same (1000<br>
 <br>
ms, 800 ms (V-V (1)), 1200 ms (V-V (2)), 1000 ms (V-V (3))); however, the long pause is<br>
not terminated with a ventricular pace. Rather, intrinsic conduction is permitted; thus,<br>
reducing the disruptive effects that might result from pacing in such a situation for certain<br>
patients. If the VS had not occurred at time T6 and none occurred at all in the A-A<br>
interval (T5 - T7), then a ventricular pace would have been delivered following the AP at<br>
T7. To summarize, in this embodiment the acceleration in ventricular timing (800 ms),<br>
followed by a deceleration (1200 ms) is terminated by an intrinsic event as opposed to a<br>
ventricular paced event.<br>
FIG. 2C represent another embodiment referred to as a VPP with ventricular rate<br>
stabilization (VRS) or rate smoothing. In dual chamber modes, (e.g., DDD/R) VRS<br>
address the same type of acceleration/deceleration in V-V timing generated by PVCs.<br>
However, in a dual chamber mode, ventricular pacing is almost always provided and<br>
certainly always available. Thus, the AV interval and the VA interval are completely<br>
controlled and in response to a PVC, these intervals are varied to gradually return to a<br>
normal timing pattern. With the VPP, there is no control over ventricular timing; thus, this<br>
approach is impossible.<br>
At time Tl, the AP is delivered and a VS occurs at time T2. An A-A interval of<br>
1000 ms expires and the next AP is delivered at T3. As in the previous examples, a PVC<br>
occurs (during the crosstalk window) at time T4. To ultimately affect the V-V timing, the<br>
A-A interval is modified. Thus, after the PVC the current A-A interval is truncated and an<br>
AP is delivered "early" at time T5. In this example, the shortened A-A interval is about<br>
750 ms. As an example, the VS has generally been occurring about 250 ms after the AP in<br>
this "patient". Thus, at time T6 the VS occurs. By chance, this happens to approximately<br>
align with the previously scheduled 1000 ms AP (which does not occur) at time T7. It<br>
should be appreciated that these two times may or may not correspond. Another AP is<br>
delivered at time T8 with a normal VS at time T9. The result is that the prior V-V interval<br>
(not shown) is about 1000 ms, V-V (1) is about 800 ms (PVC is an early event, hence<br>
some acceleration of V-V timing); V-V (2) is about 950 ms (because of the early AP and<br>
resulting VS); and V-V (3) returns to the normal 1000 ms interval. The resultant V-V<br>
intervals are substantially "smoother;" that is, their durations are relatively similar and<br>
large accelerations and large decelerations are avoided. Once the A-A interval is<br>
shortened, this approach allows a smoother, more gradual return to normal timing rather<br>
 <br>
than a one cycle jump. In addition, the ventricular event occurring between times T5 and<br>
T8 is intrinsic, which as described above is preferable to relying upon ventricular pacing.<br>
More atrial cycles could be relied upon to effectuate the smoothing, with each resultant V-<br>
V interval varying by a smaller amount; thus, while taking longer to return to a given<br>
value an even smoother transition is provided. The number of cycles and the delta<br>
between consecutive intervals may be selected to provide the desired degree of<br>
"smoothing."<br>
Thus, this embodiment controls A-A timing to effectuate variations in V-V timing<br>
without providing ventricular pacing. As such, this embodiment represents a VPP having<br>
a ventricular rate stabilization or smoothing effect.<br>
There are several factors to consider within the scope of the present invention in<br>
varying A-A intervals to effectuate V-V timing. The "early" AP must not be too early so<br>
as to pace when the atrium is refractory and/or similarly result in a conducted event<br>
occurring when the ventricles are refractory. Furthermore, the amount of the adjustment is<br>
based upon known or expected AV timing (which as explained, is not controlled by the<br>
device). In other words, the desired effect is to achieve an intrinsic ventricular<br>
depolarization at or about time T6 (in this example). Thus, the IMD 10 determines the<br>
likely AV time that will result, and shortens the A-A interval by this amount.<br>
FIG. 3A is an example of how the prior VPP(s) would treat a PVC occurring<br>
approximately 400 ms after a properly sensed ventricular event and within the same A-A<br>
interval. Again, the example assumes atrial pacing in every cycle with an A-A interval of<br>
1000 ms. Thus, the A-A interval previous to the first illustrated (referred to as A-A (0))<br>
was 1000 ms in duration, with a VS at about 250 ms and no PVC occurred.<br>
At time Tl, the AP is delivered and an interval of 1000 ms is started. At time T2, a<br>
VS occurs (about 250 ms). A PVC occurs at time T3, which is about 400 ms after the VS<br>
and thus about 650 ms into the cycle. The notation at time T4 indicates when the next AP<br>
was scheduled to be delivered (e.g., at the termination of the 1000 ms interval). In<br>
general, the way that the previous VPPs treated a PVC occurring after a VS was to add an<br>
interval or in other words delay the subsequent AP. This effectively means that a VA<br>
interval is initiated at the PVC (T3). The value of this interval may be varied; in this<br>
example a value of 920 ms is utilized (current A-A interval (1000 ms) - 80 ms (where 80<br>
 <br>
ms is the AV interval for a backup V pace). As such, an AP is delivered at time T5 and a<br>
normal VS occurs at time T6, with the pattern normalizing through time T9.<br>
The result is a 1000 ms V-V (0), a 400 ms V-V (1), an 1150 ms V-V (2), and 1000<br>
ms interval for V-V (3) &amp; (4). Thus, a long pause (1150 ms vs. 400 ms) occurs in V-V<br>
timing. In this instance, the pause is terminated by a VS. In another scenario, no VS<br>
occurs during the A-A interval defined by time T5 to T7. This would result in a VP<br>
occurring proximate time T8, thereby extending V-V (2) to about 2000 ms. Thus, the<br>
pause is longer and is terminated by a pacing pulse.<br>
FIG. 3B illustrates an embodiment of the present invention that smoothes the V-V<br>
intervals in response to the same PVC occurring at 400 ms by controlling A-A timing.<br>
Again, an AP occurs at time Tl (initiating a 1000 ms interval) followed by a VS at time<br>
T2. A PVC occurs at time T3. The current VPP embodiment attempts to have the V-V<br>
intervals be relatively smooth, progressively larger, and gradually return to the appropriate<br>
value (e.g., 1000 ms in this case). Thus, V-V (1) establishes the initial interval at 400 ms.<br>
The IMD 10 determines what V-V (2) interval should be, based upon the value of V-V (1).<br>
Based upon what this value is (550 ms in this example), the desired timing of the VS at T5<br>
is determined. Since the IMD 10 cannot control when the VS will actually occur, it<br>
calculates what the likely AV delay will be, subtracts this interval from the time T5 and<br>
provides an atrial pace at this time (T4); contrasted with the example of FIG. 3A where a<br>
long VA (920 ms) is added to the PVC before the next AP. The interval (VA) between T3<br>
and T4 must be appropriate and non-refractory. Furthermore, the IMD 10 (based upon<br>
patient historical data) determines that this VA is not likely to lead to conduction block.<br>
The AP is delivered at time T4 and the VS occurs at time T5 (about 250 ms later in<br>
this example). As indicated, V-V (2) is about 550 ms and a subsequent jump to 1000 ms<br>
would be too large a delta; thus, the above process is repeated. A desired V-V value is<br>
determined; the necessary timing of the VS is determined, the likely AV value is<br>
subtracted, and the AP is delivered at that time. Here, the AP is delivered at T6 and V-V<br>
(3) is 700 ms. The same process is repeated again and the next AP is delivered at time T8<br>
with a resultant V-V(4) of about 850 ms. Finally, the AP at T9 returns the V-V interval to<br>
the initial rate of 1000 ms. Correspondingly, the A-A interval from T4 - T6 is 700 ms, T6<br>
- T8 is 850 ms, and from T8 - T9 is 1000 ms. Thus, by varying the A-A intervals using<br>
the VPP smoothing function, the resulting intrinsic ventricular timing may be influenced<br>
 <br>
and the resultant V-V intervals adjusted to avoid large deltas between sequential cycles<br>
without actually pacing the ventricles.<br>
If an AP is scheduled following a PVC and another PVC occurs prior to delivery of<br>
that AP, several options exist. First, the IMD 10 determines if the timing of the second or<br>
subsequent PVC would still permit the scheduled AP to be delivered in an effective<br>
manner. If so, the AP is delivered. If not, then a standard delay may be added to the AP<br>
timing (e.g., delay by 400 ms); the delay may be set to the duration of the interval between<br>
PVC's; or the above process is repeated in its entirety as the V-V intervals (may) have<br>
been changed by the occurrence of a subsequent PVC.<br>
It should be readily appreciated that the examples used herein are for illustrative<br>
purposes only. The numerical values selected merely aid illustration and arc in no way<br>
limiting. The specific values that would be chosen would vary depending upon patient<br>
specific criteria.<br>
FIG. 3C illustrates how the above embodiment would respond to an atrial<br>
refractory event. Comparison is made between FIGS. 3B and 3C. At time T3 (in each<br>
figure), the PVC occurs. At time T4 (FIG. 3C), an atrial refractory event (AR) occurs thus<br>
prematurely depolarizing the atrium. Of course, if conducted the ventricles are refractory<br>
so this does not affect ventricular depolarization. If the AP were delivered at the same<br>
time it was in FIG. 3B, the atrium would be refractory and would not depolarize. Thus,<br>
despite the desire to smooth the V-V variability, the AP must be delayed because of the<br>
AR. In this example, the AP is delayed 400 ms from the AR. The delay may be a<br>
determination of atrial repolarization or some surrogate such as A-V intervals (averaged,<br>
median, etc.) for a given rate, or an A-V value plus an offset such as 50 ms to assure<br>
reliability. The AP is delivered at time T5 and the VS occurs at time T6. The process then<br>
continues as previously described. In this case, V-V (I) is still 400 ms, V-V (2) is 750 ms,<br>
which is greater than 550 ms of FIG. 3B but still significantly shorter than the 1100 ms of<br>
FIG. 3A, V-V (3) is 900 ms and V-V (4) returns to 1000 ms. Thus, an atrial refractory<br>
event causes a somewhat longer pause, but the present embodiment is still able to smooth<br>
V-V intervals by adjusting A-A timing and avoids ventricular pacing.<br>
FIGS. 4A-4C are substantially similar to FIG. 3A-3C, however the PVC occurs<br>
600 ms after the VS, rather than 400 ms. The resulting processes are the same and the V-<br>
V intervals, in this example are as follow:<br>
 <br>

In certain embodiments of the present invention, the A-A intervals are adjusted<br>
during VPP operation so that resultant V-V intervals are influenced, without providing<br>
ventricular pacing (as a general rule). The determination of values may be based on<br>
various criteria. For example, once a given (short) V-V interval occurs (e.g., due to a<br>
PVC), the next V-V interval (and each thereafter until the desired rate is achieved) may be<br>
increased by some predetermined percentage such as 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 or 45<br>
percent. Alternatively, a predetermined value may be added to the subsequent V-V<br>
interval (and each thereafter until the desire rate is achieved) such as for example 50, 100,<br>
150, 200 or 250 ms.<br>
Thus, the desired V-V interval is selected. To implement this interval, the A-A<br>
interval is calculated accordingly and the atrial pace is delivered at an appropriate time.<br>
The determining factor is the AP to VS time value (AV delay or interval). In other words,<br>
the desired time for a VS to occur is selected and the AV delay is subtracted to determine<br>
when to pace. The present invention provides various mechanisms to determine this likely<br>
AV delay.<br>
In one embodiment, the AV delay times are recorded by the 1MD 10 over some<br>
period of time. This may be for the overall implant life or some subset such as the last 12<br>
hours, the previous 100 cardiac cycles or other predetermined period of time. The AV<br>
 <br>
delay is averaged or a median AV value is determined and utilized. By using a<br>
statistically significant but relatively short time line, the median AV delay, for example, is<br>
more likely to be accurate than over the lifetime of the implant. For example, the median<br>
over the previous 100 cardiac cycles would account for the patient's current condition and<br>
status.<br>
In another embodiment, a table of AV delays is kept for various A-A intervals.<br>
Such a table 100 is illustrated in FIG. 5A. A given data point may represent one of several<br>
potential items. A data point may simply indicate what an AV delay for a given A-A<br>
interval is, based upon patient experience. Alternatively, the data point may be an<br>
averaged value, median, etc. of AV delays for the same A-A delay. Finally, the data point<br>
may represent the shortest successful AV delay for a given A-A interval. This may be a<br>
single event or alternatively, a plurality of successful conductions at this delay may be<br>
required prior to entry into the table. The table is meant to indicate at least what AV<br>
delays are likely to succeed (i.e., conduct successfully) at a given A-A interval and to the<br>
extent the data is available, the shortest tolerable AV delay for any given A-A interval.<br>
The table provides various discrete data points, from which other data may be<br>
extrapolated. That is, if the above methodology requires an A-A interval of a given<br>
duration to smooth V-V intervals and that A-A interval has no data in the table, the likely<br>
AV delay may be extrapolated.<br>
In another embodiment, the extrapolation of data takes into account the non-linear<br>
relationship between A-A intervals and AV delay. In reality, the AV delay can only be<br>
truncated so much (successfully) regardless of how short the duration of desired A-A<br>
interval. Choosing between relatively long A-A intervals (e.g., 1100 ms vs. 1000 ms) has<br>
different tolerances than relatively short A-A interval (e.g., 400 ms) variations. Thus, FIG.<br>
5B illustrates a sample graph 200 where a non-linear component is added to an<br>
extrapolation of the data obtained from e.g., the table 100 of FIG. 5A. This margin<br>
increases the likelihood that a selected A-A interval will result in a conducted event. It is<br>
generally preferable to err on the side of providing a longer A-A interval (resulting in a<br>
longer V-V interval) than to try to have too short an A-A interval that fails to conduct.<br>
In another embodiment, a decision is made to smooth V-V intervals. A calculation<br>
is performed to determine what A-A interval is required to effectuate the desired V-V<br>
interval. The IMD 10 then determines whether this A-A interval will successfully conduct<br>
 <br>
(that is, actual data supports the interval and its requirements). If so, then the A-A interval<br>
is utilized. If not, then a ventricular pacing pulse is provided to ensure the desired V-V<br>
interval. This embodiment is the least preferred, and distinct from the others, for the<br>
above stated reason that ventricular pacing is always less preferable to conduction.<br>
Generally, it would likely be more preferable to revert to the prior VPP (e.g., FIG. 2A).<br>
However, the present invention provides for a variety of embodiments so that various<br>
options may be provided to clinicians who may then select the most appropriate VPP for<br>
their patient.<br>
FIGS. 6-7 are flowcharts that present the methodology of various embodiments<br>
consistent with the teachings of the present invention. The IMD 10 is programmed to<br>
operate (300) according to a VPP (ventricular pacing protocol) such as, for example, the<br>
MVP™ mode. As a general summary, the VPP operates by freely providing atrial pacing<br>
as desired and of course, relying upon intrinsic atrial depolarization whenever appropriate.<br>
Ventricular pacing is generally withheld and a full cardiac cycle (A-A interval) is<br>
permitted to lapse without ventricular activity. If a cycle lapses without ventricular<br>
activity, then a ventricular backup pace is provided in the next subsequent cycle,<br>
appropriately timed from the atrial event. The next action(s) taken will vary based upon<br>
the embodiment of the VPP. For example, in the following cycle (after a ventricular pace)<br>
ventricular pacing may be withheld again to allow for intrinisic conduction. If this pattern<br>
is repeated a certain number of times, a mode switch to a dual chamber mode (e.g.,<br>
DDD/R) is made for some predetermined amount of time. This generalized description<br>
addresses normal operation of the VPP when proper ventricular events are sensed and/or<br>
no ventricular event is sensed.<br>
Returning to the flowchart, this process is described. An entire A-A interval<br>
(whether defined by atrial pacing at some rate and/or intrinsic atrial depolarization) is<br>
monitored (310); that is, the ventricles are sensed for ventricular depolarization in<br>
response to a conducted atrial event. It should be appreciated that various blanking<br>
periods arc still utilized during a given A-A interval and should not lead to confusion<br>
regarding monitoring over the "entire" A-A interval.<br>
During the A-A interval, the ventricular channel is monitored for conducted events.<br>
If no (320) ventricular event is sensed, then a ventricular pacing pulse is provided (330) in<br>
the subsequent A-A interval. After that, the process returns and continues to operate<br>
 <br>
according the parameters of the VPP. Conversely, if a ventricular event is sensed (320) a<br>
determination is made as to whether this event is a PVC (340). It should be appreciated<br>
that during this monitored A-A interval, a first sensed ventricular event may be classified<br>
as a PVC if it occurs so early in the cycle that it would not have resulted from conduction.<br>
Conversely, a proper ventricular event may be sensed and then a second ventricular event<br>
within the same A-A interval may also be sensed. This second (or subsequent) event<br>
would be classified as the PVC (340).<br>
If no PVC is detected (340), then the IMD 10 will operate (350) in the next<br>
subsequent A-A interval as it has in this interval. That is, no ventricular pacing is<br>
provided and the entire A-A interval is monitored. Thus, the process returns to normal<br>
VPP operation (300).<br>
If a PVC (340) is detected, then the VPP initiates (360) the ventricular interval<br>
smoothing function, which is illustrated in FIG. 7. While the process is described in a<br>
particular sequence, it should be appreciated this order is non-limiting and that various<br>
actions may occur in a different sequence and/or simultaneously. Furthermore, while<br>
various actions are called out for explanatory purposes, there may not be any specific<br>
action taken as the result is the gathering of a known variable or value (e.g., determining<br>
A-A intervals - this value is typically "known" to the IMD 10).<br>
The IMD 10 determines (370) what the prevailing A-A interval is at the time of the<br>
PVC. If atrial pacing has been prevalent, this is simply the escape interval for the atrial<br>
pacing component, which will likely (but not necessarily) be rate responsive. In the above<br>
examples, this was 1000 ms for illustrative purposes. If the atrial rhythm was intrinsic,<br>
then the AS-AS intervals were sensed by the IMD 10 and while not controlled by the<br>
device, the timing was known.<br>
The IMD 10 then determines (380) a value for V-V(l) which is the time from the<br>
previous ventricular event to the PVC. In order for the event to be a PVC it must have<br>
either occurred too early in the cycle and absent the present methodology, the next V-V<br>
interval would be too long (and likely terminated by a VP); or the PVC occurs after the VS<br>
and therefore introduces a very short V-V interval which would be followed by a long V-<br>
V interval. Therefore, the IMD 10 determines (390) what the appropriate value for V-<br>
V(2) should be based upon the value of V-V(l) and the A-A prevailing rate. That is, the<br>
 <br>
objective is to return to the V-V prevailing rate in a smoother or gradual, stepped fashion<br>
and avoid large variances.<br>
The IMD 10 may utilize various methodologies in calculating V-V (2). As<br>
illustrated, one example (A) is to add some incremental value to the V-V (1) interval. This<br>
may be a standard value (e.g., 50 ms, 100 ms, etc.) or may be a value linked with the value<br>
of V-V (1). For example, if V-V (1) is particularly short (200 ms) adding 50 ms may<br>
result in an unworkable V-V (2). Therefore, there may be a minimum allowable V-V (2)<br>
value. Thus, while various options are available the result is that some value is added to<br>
V-V (1) to arrive at V-V (2). In the other example (B), V-V (2) is created by increasing<br>
V-V (1) by some percentage (e.g., 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 %, etc.), with the same<br>
caveats relating to the V-V(2) value being too short and therefore extended to a<br>
predetermined minimum.<br>
Once the value for V-V (2) is determined, the IMD 10 determines when an AP<br>
would need to be delivered so that intrinsic conduction would lead to a VS at the<br>
appropriate time. Thus, steps 400 and 410 arc effectively coincident as determining the<br>
AP timing necessitates knowing the expected AP-VS timing and vice versa.<br>
The IMD 10 evaluates (420) whether the A - AP timing is likely to permit/<br>
facilitate conduction (430). If not, then the timing is reevaluated (440) or as indicated for<br>
one embodiment, ventricular pacing is provided. In order to evaluate the likelihood of<br>
conduction, various methods may be utilized. In one embodiment a table of known AV<br>
delays is provided and either utilized or a value is extrapolated if no corresponding data<br>
point is present. In another embodiment, average or median AV delays are stored and this<br>
value is utilized. In another embodiment, a patient specific table is created (as above), and<br>
a non-linear modifier is utilized for extrapolation to account for the non-linear<br>
correspondence between A-A intervals and AV delays over the spectrum of possible A-A<br>
intervals. Finally, another embodiment is to utilize a given value if the IMD 10 "knows"<br>
(based on stored data) that conduction will very likely occur and to provide ventricular<br>
pacing if this confidence in a specific value is unavailable<br>
Assuming the timing of the AP and the expected V-V (2) arc satisfactory and<br>
would reasonably lead to a conducted ventricular event, the AP is scheduled. During the<br>
interim, the atrial channel is monitored for refractory events. If an AR occurs (450), then a<br>
 <br>
predetermined delay value (e.g., 400 ms) is added to delay the AP until the atrium is<br>
repolarized.<br>
At the appropriate time, the AP is delivered (470) and the ventricular channel is<br>
sensed (480) for a VS. If the VS does not occur, then ventricular pacing is provided in the<br>
subsequent cycle according to the normal operation of the VPP. Assuming the VS docs<br>
occur (490), the next A-A interval (and V-V (3)) is calculated (510) (using the described<br>
methodology) and the appropriately timed AP is delivered (520). That is, V-V (3) is<br>
longer than V-V (2), and each interval progresses toward the desired duration.<br>
The current A-A interval (and effectively V-V interval) arc compared (530) to the<br>
prevailing A-A interval. If they are the same or very close, then the process is complete<br>
and operation returns to normal according to the VPP parameters (300). If the A-A<br>
interval is not substantially equal to the prevailing (or desired) A-A interval, the process<br>
returns to step 510 and another incremental V-V value is generated. This process is<br>
repeated as often as necessary to return to the desired rate. In the examples previously<br>
described, this would take 2-3 cycles; however, this is non-limiting.<br>
FIG. 8A is a timing diagram again illustrating basic operation with one existing<br>
embodiment of a VPP. Atrial events are paced and the A-A interval is 1000 ms, in this<br>
example. Similarly, the VS - VS intervals arc also 1000 ms. At time T5 an AP is<br>
delivered that is followed by a VS at time T6. At time T7, the next AP is delivered (1000<br>
ms after T5). Because of the VS at T6, no ventricular pacing will be provided in the A-A<br>
interval between T7 and T8. As illustrated, no ventricular event is sensed in this interval.<br>
The AP is delivered as scheduled at time T8 and a ventricular pace VP is delivered at time<br>
T9, in this example about 100 ms after the AP. The next AP is delivered 1000 ms after the<br>
last, at time T10 and a VS occurs at time Til. The VS events are illustrated as occurring<br>
about 250 ms after the AP.<br>
The result of this pattern is that when conduction is present the V-V interval is<br>
about 1000 ms. The VS-VP interval is about 1850 ms, the VP - VS interval is about 1100<br>
ms (due to relatively short AP-VP interval, which is deliberate), and the next VS-VS is<br>
again 1000 ms. This is normal operation and no PVCs or other extraneous events are<br>
present. Operation in this manner is well tolerated by the patient population and results in<br>
a dramatic reduction in ventricular pacing for patients having some degree of intact<br>
 <br>
conduction. That said, even absent a PVC there is a pause that is terminated with a<br>
ventricular pace.<br>
FIG. 8B illustrates a new embodiment of a VPP according to the present invention<br>
that may be used in and of itself as well as in combination with the above ventricular<br>
interval smoothing functions. At T5 the AP occurs, followed by the expected VS at T6.<br>
At T7, the next AP is delivered. One of the basic principles of the VPP mode is that<br>
ventricular pacing is precluded in a cycle following a cycle were ventricular activity was<br>
sensed. That said, there is no requirement that a given A-A interval have any specified<br>
value; intrinsic atrial events could always inhibit a scheduled AP. Thus, the present<br>
embodiment utilizes the ability to "control" or rather influence intrinsic ventricular events<br>
through the timing of atrial pacing.<br>
Following the AP at time T7, there is some expected time during which a VS is<br>
likely to occur and this range is illustrated as range Rl. This is patient specific and based<br>
upon history (or demographical data when specific patient data is insufficient or<br>
unavailable). Thus, the range Rl could provide for an AV delay that is much longer than<br>
what would typically occur for dual chamber pacing modes. Nonetheless, even with<br>
patients having prolonged conduction, there is generally some predictability. If no VS<br>
occurs by the end of the range Rl, then the timing of next AP is advanced or accelerated<br>
so that a VS is likely to occur at time T9. Time T10 indicates when the originally<br>
scheduled AP would have occurred. The same calculation methodology previously<br>
described may be used herein.<br>
The A-A interval between T7 and T8 is truncated and devoid of ventricular<br>
activity. As a practical matter, had the AP not been advanced this cycle would most likely<br>
still be devoid of a VS. Now, in the cycle from T8 - Tl 1, ventricular pacing is available,<br>
but the PAV (paced AV) interval is not set to the short (80 - 100 ms) duration as<br>
previously used. Rather, sufficient time is given that intrinsic conduction leads to the VS<br>
at time T9. In considering resultant V-V intervals, there is still a pause (though shorter<br>
than in FIG. 8A); however, it is terminated with an intrinsic ventricular event rather than a<br>
ventricular pace. For intermittent dropped beats, this is the most likely result; that is, if<br>
given an opportunity intrinsic conduction will likely reemergc after a single skipped cycle.<br>
The next AP is delivered at T11 (1000 ms after the early AP at T8). At T13 an AP<br>
is delivered and no VS occurs during the expected range R2. Thus, the IMD 10 schedules<br>
 <br>
an early AP to occur at about time T14. In this example, a VS occurs after the expiration<br>
of the range R2, but prior to delivering the early AP. Thus, the early AP is cancelled and<br>
the originally scheduled AP is delivered at time T15.<br>
As illustrated no VS occurs between T15 and T16 (a shortened A-A similar to T7-<br>
T8). Thus, with the delivery of the AP at T16 it is hoped that a VS will occur as<br>
previously described. There may be block or other issues and no VS occurs within the set<br>
PAV interval. As such, a VP is delivered at T17. This simply illustrates that after a<br>
truncated A-A devoid of ventricular activity, the next cycle will have ventricular activity;<br>
either through an intrinsic event that is given a better chance to emerge due to the early AP<br>
and delayed VP, or if necessary by the VP. It should be appreciated that these events are<br>
illustrative and that no correlation is meant to be indicated by the proximity of events<br>
having missed beats; they are proximate simply for illustrative convenience and are<br>
otherwise unrelated. One could assume that numerous cycles elapsed between the<br>
described cycles having accelerated atrial pacing. The VPP may take certain action based<br>
upon patterns emerging over a number of cycles and the present embodiment does not<br>
exclude such action and merely presents various possible scenarios in proximity for ease<br>
of illustration.<br>
FIG. 9 is a flowchart illustrating a VPP using A-A interval modulation to reduce<br>
the occurrence of providing ventricular pacing following a skipped ventricular beat while<br>
controlling V-V intervals. The IMD 10 begins operation (600) according to the VPP of<br>
the present embodiment. Over time, the IMI) 10 will record data (605) indicative of the<br>
patient's AV delays at various A-A intervals. Until that patient specific data has been<br>
recorded, preprogrammed AV data may be utilized as a surrogate. For purposes of this<br>
example, we assume that some number of previous A-A intervals (whether paced or not)<br>
have had successful ventricular conduction. Thus, the initiation of the A-A interval (610)<br>
simply represents a cardiac cycle following a cycle where a conducted ventricular event<br>
occurred. Once again, the A-A interval may be paced or entirely intrinsic and an<br>
assumption of consistency due to rate is made for illustrative purposes only.<br>
This A-A interval begins and an AV range timer is initiated (620). This timer<br>
represents when, for this rate, this patient will likely have a conducted ventricular<br>
depolarization. The timer is referred to as a range timer as some margin may be added to<br>
the expected timing to account for normal and/or tolerable variations. As a VS occurred in<br>
 <br>
the previous cycle, ventricular pacing will not (615) be available in this cycle. The<br>
ventricular channel is sensed (630) for a conducted event. The IMD 10 determines if a VS<br>
has occurred (640), if a VS occurs then the next cardiac cycle will also be precluded from<br>
having ventricular pacing (650) and the process returns to 610 for the next A-A interval.<br>
If no VS occurs (640), the IMD 10 evaluates the status of the timer (660) and continues to<br>
monitor until the timer's expiration.<br>
If the timer expires without a VS occurring, then the protocol "assumes" that no<br>
VS will likely occur in the current A-A interval (670). Ventricular pacing is precluded as<br>
previously indicated. The IMD 10 evaluates (680) the timing of the previous VS and what<br>
an appropriate V-V interval would be, assuming a skipped event in this interval. Next, a<br>
calculation is made as to when an AP would need to be delivered (early, as compared to<br>
the expected A-A interval) that would likely conduct and result in a VS as this time (690).<br>
While described as separate steps, it should be appreciated that these calculations are<br>
related. That is, the current rate, the likelihood of atrial capture, and the likelihood of<br>
conduction leading to a VS, as well as the resulting V-V interval are all utilized in the<br>
determination.<br>
Once the timing has been calculated, this early AP is scheduled (700). Until that<br>
time, the ventricular channel continues to be monitored (710) and if a VS (720) occurs, the<br>
early AP is cancelled (730) and the process returns to step 650. In other words, the VS<br>
occurred outside of the AV range timer but within the original A-A interval; thus, that<br>
interval is considered as having a conducted ventricular event and the process proceeds<br>
accordingly.<br>
Assuming that no VS occurs prior to the scheduled delivery, the early AP is<br>
delivered (740). In the A-A interval initiated by this AP, ventricular pacing is available as<br>
the previous (truncated) cycle was devoid of a ventricular event. In other VPP<br>
embodiments, the VP is delivered rather quickly post AP (e.g., 80 ms); in the present<br>
embodiment, the AP was timed so that assuming normal conduction (preferably specific to<br>
this patient), a VS is likely to occur at an appropriate time. Therefore, an AP-VP interval<br>
is initiated (750) wherein upon expiration a VP will be delivered, unless inhibited by a VS.<br>
The AP - VP interval is selected so that the VP is scheduled after the expected VS<br>
(optionally plus some margin). In most cases, a VS will occur but in those rare instances<br>
where it does not, ventricular pacing is provided.<br>
 <br>
As indicated, the ventricular channel is monitored (760) for a VS during the AP-<br>
VP interval. If a VS occurs (770), then the VP is inhibited and the process returns to step<br>
650 as this cycle is has a conducted ventricular event. As previously discussed, the<br>
resulting V-V interval is somewhat longer than the preceding V-V intervals; however, this<br>
pause is terminated by an intrinsic ventricular event rather than a paced event. If no VS<br>
occurs (770), then the scheduled VP is delivered (790) and the next steps are taken (800)<br>
according to the specific VPP.<br>
Through the new embodiments discussed above, various VPPs have been provided<br>
that alter atrial timing in order to effect a change in ventricular intervals. These VPPs<br>
allow for intrinsic conduction to occur over an entire A-A interval and only if that interval<br>
is devoid of a ventricular sensed event will ventricular pacing be provided in the next<br>
cardiac cycle. This modification of atrial timing may be made in any cycle where it<br>
appears unlikely that a ventricular event will conduct and/or in situations where a PVC<br>
will create anomalous intervals. It should be appreciated that by utilizing these<br>
embodiments, various arrhythmias arc likely avoided. As a consequence, the need to<br>
deliver cardioversion or defibrillation shocks is reduced.<br>
In general, patients tolerate one skipped ventricular beat well; however, a<br>
ventricular event (paced/sensed) will occur in the cycle subsequent to the skipped beat.<br>
Absent the above described atrial timing modifications, the existing VPP may result in a<br>
V-V interval equal in duration to twice the lower rate minus the PAV (assuming<br>
normal/consistent AP-VS durations). Ventricular timing is not controlled in this manner,<br>
this is simply the numerical result. Referring to FIG. 8A, the VP at time T9 is scheduled<br>
to be delivered at the end of a PAV that is initiated with the AP at time T8. Thus, the<br>
timing of this VP is not related to the previous VS but in retrospect, the interval between<br>
these two events may be measured. To be completely accurate, the maximum duration<br>
(assuming fixed A-A intervals at the LRl) is twice the atrial lower rate interval (LRI) plus<br>
the AP-VP interval minus the AP-VS interval (2*LRJ + (AP VP) - (AP VS)). As<br>
indicated, in various circumstances it may be desirable to shorten this interval and/or end<br>
the interval with an intrinsic event rather than a paced event. Thus, the A-A intervals arc<br>
varied to achieve these effects.<br>
As discussed, modifying atrial timing will likely result in conducted events<br>
occurring at a desired time. In order to make this more likely, A-A intervals may be<br>
 <br>
selected based upon patient data that indicates previous successful conduction at that<br>
interval. Despite this, the possibility remains that an accelerated atrial event will initiate a<br>
cycle where conduction does not occur and a ventricular pace is delivered. Thus, there are<br>
two factors in consideration. The first is the likelihood of successful conduction at a given<br>
atrial rate. The second is the resultant VS to VP interval, when ventricular pacing is<br>
required. These two factors will define the boundaries of the permissible atrial<br>
acceleration as well as the PAV that is set.<br>
Referring to FIG. 10, portions of two timing diagrams are illustrated. Timeline A<br>
illustrates the prior VPP with a maximum V-V interval, in one scenario. It should be<br>
appreciated that the illustrated timing of the VS is arbitrary and if it had occurred earlier in<br>
the cycle, the resulting V-V interval would be longer. Thus, "maximum" is relative in the<br>
sense that the actual AP-VS timing may vary, the A-A interval may vary, and a different<br>
PAV may be set. However, the relationship defined by the variables, regardless of their<br>
specific values in a given example, does in fact establish the relevant reference points.<br>
In this example, the IMD 10 is providing atrial pacing at the lower rate interval<br>
(LRI). An atrial AP is delivered, followed by a ventricular sensed event (VS). At the end<br>
of the A-A interval, a second AP is delivered and no ventricular event occurs. A third AP<br>
is delivered and the PAVA (e.g., 80 ms) is initiated. At the end of the PAVA, a ventricular<br>
pace (VP) is delivered. In practice, a VA interval (not illustrated separately) begins and<br>
upon expiration, the fourth AP is delivered (at the same time the LRJ would have expired).<br>
This diagram simply illustrates normal operation upon skipping a ventricular beat for this<br>
VPP.<br>
Assuming the A-A interval is set to the LRI, the illustrated VS to VP interval is a<br>
retrospective maximum, relative to the timing of the VS. As indicated, VS to VP may be<br>
defined as:<br>
V-V (max)= 2*LRI + PAV(A) - AV(S)<br>
Thus, in some of the embodiments that seek to accelerate atrial timing this may be used as<br>
the maximum V-V interval tolerated. As indicated, V-V timing is not controlled directly.<br>
Another metric similarly defining a boundary condition, again referring to FIG. 8A, is the<br>
AP(7) to AP(8) interval plus the PAV (AP - VP). This would equal the lower rate interval<br>
plus, e.g., 80 ms.<br>
 <br>
Referring to timeline B in FIG. 10, the progression is the same as timeline A<br>
through the delivery of the second atrial pace AP(2). As previously described, a range Rl<br>
is provided that establishes the expected timing of a conducted ventricular event. As<br>
illustrated, no such event occurs and the range interval Rl expires. As such, an<br>
accelerated atrial pace AP(E) is scheduled. As previously explained, a desired timing for<br>
an VS to occur (Target VS) is determined; the AV delay (target) is determined, and from<br>
this the timing of the AP(E) is calculated. The AP(2) - AP(E) interval is evaluated to<br>
determine if conduction is likely to occur in this patient; if so, the timing is utilized and if<br>
not, then the values are reevaluated. Upon delivery of the AP(E), a PAV(B) is initiated;<br>
upon expiration a ventricular pacing pulse VP will be delivered unless inhibited by a VS.<br>
Assuming the VP is delivered, an optional AP( R) may be delivered simultaneously or at<br>
approximately the same time. This prevents retrograde conduction into the atria from<br>
affecting the efficacy of the next AP(5). As illustrated, the delivery of the VP in timeline<br>
B corresponds to the delivery of the VP in timeline A and is therefore the maximum<br>
acceptable in this embodiment. As such, timing parameters that result in the VP being<br>
delivered as illustrated in timeline B or sooner are generally appropriate.<br>
With this understanding, certain relationships may be established for the variables.<br>
The use of the "↔" indicates the interval between the two items.<br>
AP(2) ↔ AP(E) ≥ AP(2)↔ Rl (expiration); and<br>
≤ LRI; and<br>
≥	shortest known A-A w/ conduction<br>
(optional)<br>
(where known A - VS ≤ AP(E) - VP)<br>
PAV(B)	≤ LRI - (AP(2) ↔ AP(E)) + PAV(A); and<br>
≥	AP(E) ↔ Target VS<br>
↓ PAV(B) ↓ VS-VP<br>
↑ PAV(B) ↑ VS Opportunity<br>
That is, the shorter the PAV(B), the shorter the VS-VP interval. Conversely,<br>
the longer the PAV(B), the greater the opportunity to allow a conducted event; that is more<br>
time is provided for conduction to occur. It should be appreciated that the usage of these<br>
 <br>
values / rules as boundary conditions is not a requirement of the present invention, and<br>
may be selectively utilized in various embodiments.<br>
In a given patient, there may be multiple cardiac cycles where the range<br>
timer Rl expires and an accelerated atrial pace (AP(E)) occurs. As indicated, this will<br>
typically result in an appropriately timed ventricular sensed event. However, if it does not<br>
the ventricular pace will be delivered. If a ventricular pace is delivered under this scenario<br>
multiple times, then a decision may be made to forego the above described PAV(B)or more<br>
accurately to shorten it so that a ventricular pace is delivered as the desired target VS time.<br>
That is, if it becomes apparent that intrinsic ventricular conduction will fail under these<br>
conditions based upon past attempts, then there is still benefit in accelerating the atrial<br>
timing and providing ventricular pacing to smooth the V-V intervals. The number of<br>
attempts that should be made prior to taking this action may be selected by the caregiver.<br>
As general guideline, sufficient attempts should be made to establish whether intrinsic<br>
conduction will emerge when accelerated atrial pacing is utilized. In an extremely<br>
conservative setting, one failed attempt may be utilized as a basis to accelerate atrial<br>
pacing and provide ventricular pacing to achieve the smoothing interval. Alternatively,<br>
more attempts may be made such as 5, 10, 20, 100, etc., before changing the approach. Of<br>
course, this numbers are merely exemplary and are non-limiting. As another variable, the<br>
number of failed attempts may be cumulative over time and a successful attempt may<br>
restart the count. Alternatively, having a high number of failures with a minimal number<br>
of successful attempts may also change the pattern. Finally, the timing of the failed<br>
attempts may increase or decrease the relevance on the decision. That is, if a number of<br>
attempts have failed and there has been a long interval (e.g., days) without a skipped<br>
interval, the algorithm may attempt to promote intrinsic conduction and accelerate the<br>
atrial interval despite the number of previously failed attempts as the patient's status may<br>
have changed in the interim. All of these variables may be programmed by the caregiver,<br>
set to default values, or may be disabled.<br>
As previously noted, a desired timing for a sensed ventricular event is<br>
calculated. The appropriate AV delay is subtracted to determine when to deliver the<br>
accelerated atrial pace (AP(E)). The AP-AP(E) interval is evaluated to determine whether<br>
this is feasible. Of course, this is merely exemplary and the ordering or steps taken may<br>
vary. In some embodiments, whether or not to attempt the accelerated timing is based<br>
 <br>
upon data if available, extrapolations of available data, generalized patient demographic<br>
data, or device determination (i.e., trial and error).<br>
In other embodiments, the decision whether to accelerate atrial pacing and<br>
the specific A-A interval chosen is made only if patient specific data is available and/or if<br>
the extrapolation required is highly probable. One way of collecting data is by making<br>
observations at different atrial rates implemented when the device is in a rate responsive<br>
mode. While data obtained in this manner is perfectly acceptable, several issues exist.<br>
First, at the time of an event requiring this determination, the patient may not have<br>
experienced an atrial rate (due to rate responsiveness) or one sufficiently close to provide<br>
relevant data. Second, many patients will not have the rate response function enabled.<br>
For example, certain heart failure patients may simply rely on atrial pacing at the LRI. For<br>
those patients, there is never an ability to collect data at the varying atrial rate (absent<br>
intrinsic atrial rate changes).<br>
FIG. 11 is a flowchart describing one process for collecting data so that<br>
patient specific data is available for the calculations. The process is referred to herein as<br>
AV conduction testing and would be performed by a clinician at implant and/or during<br>
selected follow up appointments. The IMD 10 may also automate some or all of this<br>
testing and perform the testing on a periodic basis; likewise, such testing may be done via<br>
remote programming, assuming appropriate safeguards are in place.<br>
The AV conduction testing is initiated (900) and the first issue is to<br>
determine if the patient has intact conduction (905) to warrant proceeding with the test. If<br>
not, e.g., the patient has complete heart block, the test is terminated (910). The issue may<br>
be transient and the test may be reattempted at a later time. If intact conduction is<br>
present, at least to some degree, the test proceeds. The IMD 10 is programmed to pace at<br>
the LRI (915) and the AV delay (AP-VS or AS-VS) at this rate is recorded (920) into<br>
memory. If a patient has intact conduction, then operation at the LRI has the highest<br>
probability of success and is thus a logical starting point for the test; this is not, however, a<br>
requirement of the test. A number of cardiac cycles may pass at the test rate and the<br>
recorded AV delay may be an average of those values.<br>
Once sufficient data at the LRI has been recorded, the atrial rate is<br>
increased (925). The test determines whether there was AV conduction (930). If not, the<br>
test may be terminated (910). Though not separately shown, rather than terminating the<br>
 <br>
test, multiple attempts may be made at this rate or at other atrial rates. However, at some<br>
point a lack of AV conduction will result in the termination of the testing (910).<br>
Assuming there was AV conduction at the higher atrial rate, the AV delay is recorded and<br>
stored in memory (940). Again, multiple cardiac cycles may be monitored and averaged,<br>
or data may be obtained from a single cycle. Assuming progressively increasing atrial test<br>
rates, the next determination is whether a maximum atrial test rate has been achieved and<br>
tested (945). The maximum test rate may correlate with the 1MD 10 upper rate limit<br>
(URL); however, as the testing is for purposes other than providing sustained pacing at a<br>
given rate, this maximum may exceed the URL. If the maximum atrial rate is achieved<br>
(945), the test is terminated (910). Alternatively, testing may occur until conduction fails<br>
rather than terminating at a predetermined atrial rate. Assuming the maximum atrial rate<br>
has not yet been reached (945), testing continues.<br>
As illustrated by the "OR" box, (950), testing may take one of two<br>
pathways (and multiple test may be performed so that both approaches are taken). In a<br>
first approach, the atrial rate is again increased (925) with the remainder of the test<br>
continuing as described. In this manner, with each successive iteration, the atrial rate is<br>
rising. The amount of each increase will determine the "resolution" of the results. That is,<br>
the smaller the increment the more data collected. Conversely, the less data collected, the<br>
more extrapolation required. Increments may be made in timer interval adjustment (e.g.,<br>
10, 20, 30, 40, 50 ms increments) or by adjusting beats per minute (bpm). At 60 bpm, the<br>
A-A interval is 1000 ms, at 70 bpm the A-A interval is about 857 ms, and at 120 bpm the<br>
A-A interval is 500 ms. Thus, whatever gradation is desired in terms of direct variation of<br>
the A-A interval or in terms of bpm is utilized.<br>
As an alternative (950), the A-A interval may be returned to the LRI for a<br>
period of time before each successive test cycle at a higher rate. This alternative may be<br>
utilized as the exclusive test mechanism or a complete test may be performed by<br>
iteratively increasing atrial rate and then separately performing a second test with a return<br>
to the LRI with each iteration. As an example, the test may for measure AV delay at the<br>
LRI (e.g., 60, bpm), then 61 bpm, then return to 60 bpm, then 62, bpm, then 60 bpm ... 80<br>
bpm, then 60 bpm, etc. until the maximum atrial rate is tested. Again, the time spent at the<br>
LRI and/or the test rate may be independently selected and may be one cycle or any<br>
number of cycles. The purpose of returning to the LRI is to simulate the effect of an<br>
 <br>
accelerated atrial pace which would be a one cycle change from e.g., the LRI to the<br>
calculated atrial rate for one cycle. It is under these conditions that conduction and the AV<br>
delay data will most likely actually be utilized.<br>
As indicated, the testing is performed by a clinician, most likely in a<br>
medical office setting. The results will provide data that is patient specific across the<br>
range of permissive atrial rates. In addition, those patients using a rate responsive function<br>
may also generate data on an on-going basis. Thus, at step (960) certain patients will have<br>
their IMDs operating with a rate response function. As the atrial rate varies, the<br>
corresponding AV delay and success or failure of conduction are monitored (965) and<br>
updated in memory (970). When available, this data may be more useful than the initial<br>
test results if the patient's condition has changed. Finally, it should be appreciated that the<br>
results of accelerated atrial pacing can provide data and this data may optionally be<br>
weighted due to the relevance of the results in context.<br>
FIG. 12 is a partially completed, sample table of data that may be collected<br>
during AV conduction testing or through rate response monitoring. The first column is<br>
atrial rate in milliseconds. The second column indicates whether conduction was<br>
successful at this rate. The third column indicates what the AV delay of successful<br>
conduction was at this rate (averaged if more than one data point). It should be<br>
appreciated that at the LRI or at common rates with rate responsiveness many data points<br>
will be collected at a given rate over time. As the patient's condition may vary, these<br>
frequently updated data points may be limited to a recent subset to reflect current data<br>
(e.g., data collected in the last day, last week, etc.) rather than over the lifetime of the<br>
implant. The fourth column indicates whether the data point(s) were obtained during AV<br>
conduction testing or through rate response (may indicate the temporal relevance of the<br>
data). The fifth column indicates whether the atrial rate was reached progressively or<br>
through a single change. While not necessarily limiting, an indication that successful<br>
conduction was achieved with a large change, the likelihood of success with the<br>
accelerated atrial pace may be increased. The next column indicates whether there were<br>
multiple confirmations at this rate. This may simply indicate that during testing, the atrial<br>
rate was maintained for some number of cycles (as opposed to one); this may indicate<br>
success during rate response as well as during AV conduction testing; and/or this may<br>
indicate success during more than one AV conduction test. The end result is that success<br>
 <br>
was achieved on more than one attempt. The next column indicates the percentage of<br>
successful conducted events out of the number attempted. Finally, the last column<br>
indicates whether there was success at this atrial rate recently. Recent is subjective, but<br>
will be established for a given device or by a caregiver as clinically relevant. Whether<br>
conduction needed to occur in the last day, week, month, etc. to be considered recent is a<br>
selectable parameter. This table is not meant to be limiting; the sample data shown is not<br>
required and alternative data may be included or substituted.<br>
By using this data, a determination can be made as to whether to attempt an<br>
accelerated atrial pace at a given A-A interval. For example, testing on this patient<br>
indicates that conduction was never successful at 400ms. Thus, logically there is no<br>
reason to attempt accelerated atrial pacing at this rate. The LRI (1000 ms), 975 ms, and<br>
700 ms all have been shown to be successful and would be acceptable. At 650 ms, there is<br>
a high degree of success; however, no recent success. This is not necessarily troubling.<br>
First, rate response may not be enabled thereby precluding pacing at this rate (hence<br>
precluding recent success). Second, rate response may be enabled (and is since column 4<br>
so indicated), but this rate simply has not be reached with no negative implication.<br>
Though not shown, other relevant data points could be recent failure at this rate and/or if<br>
this rate has been recently attempted. The 600 ms rate has almost the same data except<br>
that success was only achieved during initial AV conduction testing. Again, this alone is<br>
non-problematic; however, if recent failure occurred (again not illustrated) at this rate that<br>
would counsel against using this value.<br>
Finally, at 500 ms conduction was successfully achieved but only 65% of<br>
the time attempted and there were no recent successful attempts. Again, there may not<br>
have been recent success because the rate response function never attempted to pace at this<br>
rate. Whether or not a value of 65% would permit accelerated pacing at this rate would<br>
depend on the hierarchy of values programmed by the clinician. In the simplest form, a<br>
numerical value may selected (e.g., 80 %) and conduction must have been successful at<br>
this rate or higher in order to be utilized. More complex evaluations may be made. For<br>
example, a lower percentage may be acceptable if recently successful or some other factor<br>
mitigates the "low" rate of success. Of course, what value is actually selected may be<br>
clinician specific. In some cases, relatively high rates of success may be warranted<br>
(90+%); alternatively, for some a 50% rate may warrant an attempt. Finally, in some<br>
 <br>
cases any degree of success may warrant an attempt at that rate. Ultimately, the data is<br>
collected and provided and the various cutoff parameters are selected by the clinician.<br>
The present invention has been shown and described with respect to various<br>
illustrated examples, embodiments and figures. These are not meant to be limiting and<br>
one of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate that numerous variations are within the<br>
scope of the present invention.<br>

An atria] based pacing protocol promotes intrinsic conduction. An entire cardiac cycle is monitored for ventricular<br>
activity and permitted to lapse with ventricular activity. Ventricular pacing is available in a cardiac cycle immediately subsequent to<br>
such a skipped beat. When monitoring for intrinsic ventricular events, an event is expected within a given window. If no such event<br>
is detected, the cardiac cycle in truncated, leading to a shorter cycle that is devoid of ventricular activity. The subsequent cycle has<br>
a high likelihood of a ventricular sensed event and a greater than normal AV interval is provided prior to pacing.</td>
