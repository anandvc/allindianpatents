				<td>PLUG-IN HYBRID EVAP VALVE MANAGEMENT TO REDUCE VALVE<br>
CYCLING<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 61/030,658, filed on February 22, 2008. The disclosure of the<br>
above application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002] The present disclosure relates to vehicle emissions and more<br>
particularly to evaporative emissions control.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The background description provided herein is for the purpose<br>
of generally presenting the context of the disclosure. Work of the presently<br>
named inventors, to the extent it is described in this background section, as well<br>
as aspects of the description that may not otherwise qualify as prior art at the<br>
time of filing, are neither expressly nor impliedly admitted as prior art against the<br>
present disclosure.<br>
[0001] Internal combustion engines combust an air/fuel (A/F) mixture<br>
within cylinders to drive pistons and to provide drive torque. Air is delivered to<br>
the cylinders via a throttle and an intake manifold. A fuel injection system<br>
supplies fuel from a fuel tank to provide fuel to the cylinders based on a desired<br>
A/F mixture. To prevent release of fuel vapor, a vehicle may include an<br>
 <br>
evaporative emissions system which includes a canister that absorbs fuel vapor<br>
from the fuel tank, a canister vent valve, and a purge valve. The canister vent<br>
valve allows air to flow into the canister. The purge valve supplies a combination<br>
of air and vaporized fuel from the canister to the intake system.<br>
[0002] Closed-loop control systems adjust inputs of a system based on<br>
feedback from outputs of the system. By monitoring the amount of oxygen in the<br>
exhaust, closed-loop fuel control systems manage fuel delivery to an engine.<br>
Based on an output of oxygen sensors, an engine control module adjusts the fuel<br>
delivery to match an ideal A/F ratio (14.7 to 1). By monitoring engine speed<br>
variation at idle, closed-loop speed control systems manage engine intake<br>
airflows and spark advance.<br>
[0003] Typically, the fuel tank stores liquid fuel such as gasoline,<br>
diesel, methanol, or other fuels. The liquid fuel may evaporate into fuel vapor<br>
which increases pressure within the fuel tank. Evaporation of fuel is caused by<br>
energy transferred to the fuel tank via radiation, convection, and/or conduction.<br>
A plug-in hybrid evaporative emissions control (EVAP) system is designed to<br>
store and dispose of fuel vapor to prevent release. More specifically, the plug-in<br>
hybrid EVAP system returns the fuel vapor from the fuel tank to a hybrid engine<br>
for combustion therein. The plug-in hybrid EVAP system is a sealed system to<br>
meet zero emission requirements. The plug-in hybrid EVAP system is a sealed<br>
system intended to meet zero emissions requirements. More specifically, the<br>
plug-in hybrid EVAP system my be implemented in a plug-in hybrid vehicle with<br>
 <br>
minimum engine operation that stores fuel vapor prior to being purged to the<br>
engine.<br>
[0004] The plug-in hybrid EVAP system includes an evaporative<br>
emissions canister (EEC), a purge valve, and a diurnal control valve. When the<br>
fuel vapor increases within the fuel tank, the fuel vapor flows into the EEC. The<br>
purge valve controls the flow of the fuel vapor from the EEC to the intake<br>
manifold. The purge valve may be modulated between open and closed<br>
positions to adjust the flow of fuel vapor to the intake manifold.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0005] A control module for an engine of a vehicle includes a mode<br>
determination module that determines whether the vehicle is in a fuel-saving<br>
mode based on an acceleration of the vehicle. A diurnal control valve (DCV)<br>
control module selectively closes a DCV a predetermined time after at least one<br>
of determining that the vehicle is in the fuel-saving mode and determining that<br>
the engine is stopped.<br>
[0006] Further areas of applicability of the present disclosure will<br>
become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be<br>
understood that the detailed description and specific examples are intended for<br>
purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the<br>
disclosure.<br>
 <br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0007] The present disclosure will become more fully understood from<br>
the detailed description and the accompanying drawings, wherein:<br>
[0008] FIG. 1 is a functional block diagram of an exemplary hybrid<br>
engine system of a hybrid vehicle according to the present disclosure;<br>
[0009] FIG. 2 is a functional block diagram of an exemplary hybrid<br>
engine control module according to the principles of the present disclosure; and<br>
[0010] FIG. 3 is a flowchart depicting exemplary steps performed by<br>
the hybrid engine control module according to the principles of the present<br>
disclosure.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0011] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is in<br>
no way intended to limit the disclosure, its application, or uses. For purposes of<br>
clarity, the same reference numbers will be used in the drawings to identify<br>
similar elements. As used herein, the phrase at least one of A, B, and C should<br>
be construed to mean a logical (A or B or C), using a non-exclusive logical or. It<br>
should be understood that steps within a method may be executed in different<br>
order without altering the principles of the present disclosure.<br>
[0012] As used herein, the term module refers to an Application<br>
Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a processor (shared,<br>
dedicated, or group) and memory that execute one or more software or firmware<br>
programs, a combinational logic circuit, and/or other suitable components that<br>
provide the described functionality.<br>
 <br>
[0013] A diurnal control valve (DCV) controls the flow of air into an<br>
evaporative emissions canister (EEC). The diurnal control valve is normally<br>
closed to minimize emissions. The diurnal control valve is opened to allow fuel<br>
vapor in the EEC to be purged when the hybrid engine is running. A hybrid<br>
engine may excessively turn on and off. Consequently, the diurnal control valve<br>
may excessively cycle between an open position and a closed position. The<br>
excessive cycling may cause the diurnal control valve to suffer unnecessary wear<br>
and/or damage.<br>
[0014] To reduce cycling of the DCV of a plug-in hybrid evaporative<br>
emissions control (EVAP) system, the hybrid engine control system of the<br>
present disclosure includes a DCV control system. The DCV control system<br>
closes the DCV a predetermined time after the hybrid engine stops running.<br>
Alternatively, the DCV control system closes the DCV the predetermined time<br>
after a hybrid engine system of the vehicle enters a deceleration fuel cut-off<br>
(DFCO) mode. While the operation of the DCV control system will be discussed<br>
as it relates to plug-in hybrid vehicles, the principles of the present disclosure are<br>
also applicable to any vehicle having an internal combustion engine..<br>
[0015] Referring now to FIG. 1, a functional block diagram of an<br>
exemplary hybrid engine system 100 of a vehicle is shown. The hybrid engine<br>
system 100 includes a fuel system 102, a plug-in hybrid EVAP system 104, and a<br>
hybrid engine control module 106. The fuel system 102 includes a fuel tank 108,<br>
a fuel inlet 110, a fuel cap 112, and a modular reservoir assembly (MRA) 114.<br>
The plug-in hybrid EVAP system 104 includes a fuel vapor line 116, a canister<br>
 <br>
118, a fuel vapor line 120, a purge valve (PV) 122, a fuel vapor line 124, an air<br>
line 126, a DCV 128, and an air line 130.<br>
[0016] The fuel tank 108 contains liquid fuel and fuel vapor. The fuel<br>
inlet 110 extends from the fuel tank 108 to enable fuel filling. The fuel cap 112<br>
closes the fuel inlet 110 and may include a bleed hole 132. The MRA 114 is<br>
disposed within the fuel tank 108 and pumps liquid fuel to a fuel injection system<br>
(not shown) of the hybrid engine system 100 to be combusted.<br>
[0017] Fuel vapor flows through the fuel vapor line 116 into the canister<br>
118, which stores the fuel vapor. The fuel vapor line 120 connects the canister<br>
118 to the PV 122, which is initially closed in position. The hybrid engine control<br>
module 106 controls the PV 122 to selectively enable fuel vapor to flow through<br>
the fuel vapor line 124 into the intake system (not shown) of the hybrid engine<br>
system 100 to be combusted. Air flows through the air line 126 to the DCV 128,<br>
which is initially closed in position. The hybrid engine control module 106<br>
controls the DCV 128 to selectively enable air to flow through the air line 130 into<br>
the canister 118.<br>
[0018] The hybrid engine control module 106 regulates operation of the<br>
hybrid engine system 100 based on various system operating parameters. The<br>
hybrid engine control module 106 controls and is in communication with the MRA<br>
114, the PV 122, and the DCV 128. The hybrid engine control module 106 is<br>
further in communication with an oxygen sensor 134. The oxygen sensor 134<br>
generates a canister oxygen signal based on an oxygen concentration level of<br>
the fuel vapor/air mixture in the canister 118. The hybrid engine control module<br>
 <br>
106 is further in communication with a driver input module 136 that generates an<br>
acceleration signal based on an accelerator pedal position of the vehicle.<br>
[0019] Referring now to FIG. 2, a functional block diagram of the hybrid<br>
engine control module 106 is shown. The hybrid engine control module 106<br>
includes a purge enablement module 202, a PV control module 204, a DFCO<br>
determination module 206, and a DCV control module 208. The purge<br>
enablement module 202 receives the canister oxygen signal and determines a<br>
purge status signal based on the canister oxygen signal.<br>
[0020] For example only, the purge status signal may be determined to<br>
be an enabled signal when the canister oxygen is greater than or equal to a<br>
predetermined value. The purge status signal may be determined to be a<br>
disabled signal when the canister oxygen is less than the predetermined value.<br>
In addition, the purge enablement module 202 may receive other system<br>
operating parameters, such as an oxygen concentration level of exhaust gas of<br>
the hybrid engine system 100 and a mass of air flowing into the hybrid engine<br>
system 100. The purge enablement module 202 may determine the purge status<br>
signal based on the other system operating parameters.<br>
[0021] The PV control module 204 receives the purge status signal and<br>
an engine status signal from a hybrid engine (not shown) of the hybrid engine<br>
system 100. The engine status signal includes an engine on signal when the<br>
hybrid engine is running. The engine status signal includes an engine off signal<br>
when the hybrid engine is not running. The PV control module 204 opens the PV<br>
122 when the purge status signal includes the enabled signal and the engine<br>
 <br>
status signal includes the engine on signal. The PV control module 204 closes<br>
the PV 122 when the purge status signal includes the disabled signal or the<br>
engine status signal includes the engine off signal.<br>
[0022] The DFCO determination module 206 receives the acceleration<br>
signal and determines a DFCO status signal based on the acceleration signal. A<br>
DFCO mode is a fuel-saving mode whereby fuel injectors (not shown) of the<br>
hybrid engine system 100 are turned off when a throttle (not shown) of the hybrid<br>
engine system 100 is closed, and the hybrid engine is driven by the momentum<br>
of the vehicle. For example only, the DFCO status signal may be determined to<br>
be a DFCO on signal when the acceleration is less than or equal to a<br>
predetermined value that indicates that the hybrid engine system 100 is in the<br>
DFCO mode. The DFCO status signal may be determined to be a DFCO off<br>
signal when the acceleration is greater than the predetermined value. The PV<br>
control module 204 closes the PV 122 when the DFCO status signal includes the<br>
DFCO on signal.<br>
[0023] The DCV control module 208 receives the DFCO status signal,<br>
the purge status signal, and the engine status signal. The DCV control module<br>
208 opens the DCV 128 when the purge status signal includes the enabled<br>
signal and the engine status signal includes the engine on signal. The DCV<br>
control module 208 closes the DCV 128 when the purge status signal includes<br>
the disabled signal. The DCV control module 208 closes the DCV 128 after a<br>
predetermined time when the engine status signal includes the engine off signal<br>
or the DFCO status signal includes the DFCO on signal.<br>
 <br>
[0024] The predetermined time is calibrated based on a temperature of<br>
air flowing into the hybrid engine system 100. To minimize cycling of the DCV<br>
128, the predetermined time may be set to a large value, such as 60 seconds.<br>
To minimize emission of the fuel vapor, the predetermined time may be set to a<br>
small value, such as 10 seconds.<br>
[0025] Referring now to FIG. 3, a flowchart depicting exemplary steps<br>
performed by the hybrid engine control module 106 is shown. Control begins in<br>
step 302. In step 304, the engine status signal is determined. In step 306,<br>
control determines whether the engine status signal includes the engine on<br>
signal. If true, control continues in step 308. If false, control continues in step<br>
310.<br>
[0026] In step 308, the canister oxygen signal is determined. In step<br>
310, the PV 122 and the DCV 128 are closed. Control returns to step 304. In<br>
step 312, the purge status signal is determined based on the canister oxygen<br>
signal. The purge status signal may be used for the control of other types of<br>
emissions.<br>
[0027] In step 314, control determines whether the purge status signal<br>
includes the enabled signal. If true, control continues, in step 316. If false,<br>
control continues in step 318. In step 316, the PV 122 and the DCV 128 are<br>
opened.<br>
[0028] In step 318, the PV 122 and the DCV 128 are closed. Control<br>
returns to step 304. In step 320, the engine status signal is determined. In step<br>
322, control determines whether the engine status signal includes the engine on<br>
 <br>
signal. If false, control continues in step 324. If true, control continues in step<br>
326.<br>
[0029] In step 324, the DFCO status signal is determined. In step 328,<br>
control determines whether the DFCO status signal includes the DCFO on signal.<br>
If true, control continues in step 326. If false, control continues in step 330. In<br>
step 326, the PV 122 is closed. In step 332, the DCV 128 is closed after the<br>
predetermined time. Control returns to step 304.<br>
[0030] In step 330, the canister oxygen signal is determined. In step<br>
334, the purge status signal is determined based on the canister oxygen signal.<br>
In step 336, control determines whether the purge status signal includes the<br>
enabled signal. If false, control continues in step 338. If true, control returns to<br>
step 320. In step 338, the PV 122 and the DCV 128 are closed. Control returns<br>
to step 304.<br>
[0031] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the foregoing<br>
description that the broad teachings of the disclosure can be implemented in a<br>
variety of forms. Therefore, while this disclosure includes particular examples,<br>
the true scope of the disclosure should not be so limited since other modifications<br>
will become apparent to the skilled practitioner upon a study of the drawings, the<br>
specification, and the following claims. For example, while the operation of the<br>
DCV control system was discussed as it related to plug-in hybrid vehicles, the<br>
principles of the present disclosure are also applicable to any vehicle having an<br>
internal combustion engine.<br>
