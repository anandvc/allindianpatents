				<td>This invention relates to a process for the preparation of chiral 2,3-substituted propyloxy substituted-2,2-dialkyl-3,4-diarylchromans and their salts.More particularly the present invention is directed to 2,2-di-lower alkyl-3,4-di arylchromans bearing a 3-lower alkylamino -2-hydroxy-propyloxy group on either one of the aryl groups or the benzenoid portion of the chroman nucleus. Such compounds have significant pharmacological activity as antiestrogens and high order of antifertility activity.<br>
Synthesis of racemic mixture of 3-alkylamino-2-hydroxy-<br>
propyloxy substituted-2,2-dialkyl-3,4diarylchroman has been<br>
reported by Ray et al.(Contraception,Vol.35,pp283-287).such<br>
compounds possess many fold higher antifertility activity as<br>
compared to corresponding conventional tertiary aminoalkoxy<br>
substituted derivatives.	<br>
Since chirality of ligands is known to affect their binding to chiral estrogen receptors for initiating estrogenic activity, hence the importance of preparation of R-and S-3-alkyl-amino-2-hydroxy-propyloxy substituted-2,2- dialkyl-3,4-diaryl-chromans.<br>
As used throughout the specification and in the claim, the terms lower alkyl and lower alkoxy embrace both straight and branched chain alkyl and alkoxy radicals respectively,containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms,for example methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, tert-butyl, n-amyl, sec-amyl, n-hexyl, 2-ethylbutyl, 2,3-dimethylbutyl, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl,cyclohexyl,   in  the case of lower  alkyl  and<br>
methoxy, ethoxy, n-propoxy, isopropoxy, n-butoxy, tert.butoxy, n-amyloxy, sec-amyloxy, n-hexyloxy, 2-ethylbutoxy, 2,3-dimethylbutoxy, cyclopropyloxy, cyclobutyloxy, cyclopentoxy, cyclohexyloxy, in the case of lower alkoxy .<br>
The main objective of the invention is to provide a process for the preparation of chiral 2,3-substituted propyloxy substituted -2,2-dialkyl-3,4-diarylchromans and their salts.<br>
Another objective of the invention is to introduce the chirality in the antiestrogen binding site of the molecule which may selectively bind to the chiral estrogen receptor and produce the final biological response.<br>

having      hydroxyl       group       at       any       phenyl	ring     prepared     by<br>
known      methods      ( Indian     Patent     No. 129188,     filed    on    12.11.1970,<br>
Synthesis,68-70, 1988) with chiral epichlorohydrin in presence of<br>
