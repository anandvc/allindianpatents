				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present    invention   relates   to   a   carrier  bar of a spinning machine with<br>
pneumatically loaded top roller bearing and load arms, attached to the machine by means of supports, wherein the carrier bar is formed by polygonal pipe pieces conducting compressed air and attached to the machine.<br>
In such spinning machines, as known, for examples from DE 37 32 132 C2, the centra* compressed-air supply for the Individual top roller bearing and load arms Is provided via a centra! compressed-air line which is conducted along the length of the machine as a hose. Further hose lines branch off from this central line to the top roller bearing and load arms. However, all hose lines are damage-prone and, moreover, require additional installation space.<br>
The present Invention is based on the task of improving a spinning machine of the kind mentioned, to the extent that the central compressed-air supply line is more insensitive to damage and does not require any additional installation space.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a carrier bar of a spinning machine with pneumatically loaded top roller bearing and load arms, attached to the machine by means of supports, wherein the carrier bar is formed by polygonal pipe pieces conducting compressed air and attached to the machine, each of the polygonal pipe pieces being provided with closure elements at its ends, whereby a connecting pipe piece is capable of being inserted into the front openings of the closure elements of two adjacent polygonal pipe pieces.<br><br>
-2-<br>
In the spinning machine designed according to the invention, the carrier bar for the top roller bearing and load arms serves, at the same time, as centra! compressed-air conduct. Hence, a separate, damage-prone tube line for conducting compressed air is not necessary. The carrier bar being built up from individual pipe pieces, which are connected to each other in a conducting fashion with the aid of closure elements and connecting pfpe pieces, allows a modular design of the carrier bar and the compressed-air conduct for spinning machines of varying length.<br>
The cfosure elements can be Inserted in a sealing fashion into the ends of the polygonal pipe pieces, preferably by means of an adhesive. The connecting pipe pieces can, for example, be inserted into the front openings of the closure elements with O-ring seals.<br>
Further advantages arise in that the polygonal pipe pieces may be attached to the machine in the region of the closure elements, whereby the closure elements seal the inside of the polygonal pipe pieces against the points of attachment. Here, the points of attachment of the polygonal pipe pieces can preferably be located in a region of the closure elements, which is not compressed-air-conducting, and the seating between the closure element and the polygonal pipe piece can be located Inside the point of attachment seen from the end of the polygonal pipe piece. This prevents, for example, a bore hole for a screw connection having to be sealed between the polygonal pipe piece and the machine. The compressed air is conducted completely around the attachment point. Moreover, the closure elements reinforce the polygonal pipes.<br>
Blind plugs or compressed-air hose lines can also be inserted into the front openings of the closure elements. A blind plug can be inserted, for example, at the end of the entire carrier bar. Should compressed-air-conducting carrier bars be located on either side of the machine, they can be interconnected by means of a hose line, which may be inserted into the front openings of the closure elements.<br><br>
-3-Brief Description of the Accompanying Drawings<br>
A preferred embodiment of a compressed-alrlconductfng carrier bar of a spinning machine is shown below in accompanying drawings and described in greater detail.<br>
The following is shown;<br>
Fig. 1   A lateral view in partial section of two adjacent polygonal pipe pieces of a carrier bar;<br>
Rg. 2   A front view of a sealing element of the polygonal pipe pieces from Bg. 1;<br>
Fig. 3   Another embodiment of two closure elements for polygonal pipe pieces.<br>
Fig, 1 shows two polygonal pipe pieces 10, 11 of a carrier bar of a spinning machine embodied here as rectangular pipe pieces. Polygonal pipe pieces 10 and 11 are each provided with closure elements 12,13 at their adjacent ends. Closure elements 12 and 13 have a continuous groove 14,15 on their side pointing inside polygonal pipe pieces 10 and 11; into these continuous grooves an adhesive can be filled to seal closure elements 12, 13 against polygonal pipe pieces 10 and 11. Closure elements 12,13 are provided with opening 16, visible in Fig. 2, on their external front side; into this opening 16 a connecting pipe piece 17 can be Inserted, which is provided with O-ring seals 18, 19. This connecting pipe piece 17 represents the compressed-air connection between polygonal pipe pieces 10 and 11. At the end of the carrier bar formed by polygonal pipe pieces 10,11, a blind plug or a hose line can, however, also be anchored in opening 16 to connect with a carrier bar on the other machine side. Closure elements 12 and 13 have, moreover, bore holes 20 and 21 to attach polygonal pipe pieces 10 and 11 on the machines on the machine, not shown in further detail here. Bore holes 20 and 21 are located in a region in which no compressed air flows. Rather, the compressed air is passed above bore holes 20 and 21 and led through connecting pipe piece 17. Bore holes 20<br><br>
-4-<br>
and 21 therefore do not have to be sealed. Sealing points 14 and 15 of closure elements 12 and 13 are located pipe-Inward relative to attachment points 20, 21 seen from the end of polygonal pipe pieces 10 and 11.<br>
Ffg. 3 shows an alternative embodiment of closure elements 12r, 13' which are not, like closure elements 12 and 13, provided with continuous grooves 14 and 15 for an adhesive, but which have Instead tapered ends 22 and 23, onto which a sealing ring can be placed which is not shown here. The remaining design of closure elements 12' and 13 'falls In line with that of closure elements 12 and 13.<br><br>
