				<td>NON-NUCLEOSIDE REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE INHIBITORS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to novel compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, their use, either alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents, in the treatment or prophylaxis of HIV infection, and to pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The disease known as acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), particularly the strain known as HIV-1. In order for HIV to be replicated by a host cell, the information of the viral genome must be integrated into the host cell's DMA. However, HIV is a retrovirus, meaning that its genetic information is in the form of RNA. The HIV replication cycle therefore requires a step of transcription of the viral genome (RNA) into DMA, which is the reverse of the normal chain of events. An enzyme that has been aptly dubbed   . reverse transcriptase (RT) accomplishes the transcription of the viral RNA into DNA. The HIV virion includes a copy of RT along with the viral RNA.<br>
Reverse transcriptase has three known enzymatic functions; it acts as an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase, as a ribonuclease, and as a DNA-dependent DNA polymerase. Acting as an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase, RT transcribes a single-stranded DNA copy of the viral RNA. Acting as a ribonuclease, RT destroys the original viral RNA, and frees the DNA just produced from the original RNA. Finally, acting as a DNA-dependent DNA polymerase, RT makes a second, complementary DNA strand, using the first DNA strand as a template. The two strands form double-stranded DNA, which is integrated into the host cell's genome by another enzyme called integrase.<br>
Compounds that inhibit the enzymatic functions of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase will inhibit replication of HIV-1 in infected cells. Such compounds are useful in the prevention or treatment of HIV-1 infection in human subjects, as demonstrated by known RT inhibitors such as 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT), 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (ddl), 2l,3'-dideoxycytidine (ddC), d4T, 3TC, Nevirapine, Delavirdine, Efavirenzand<br><br>
Abacavir, the main drugs thus far approved for use in the treatment of AIDS.<br>
As with any antiviral therapy, use of RT inhibitors in the treatment of AIDS eventually leads to a virus that is less sensitive to the given drug. Resistance (reduced sensitivity) to these drugs is the result of mutations that occur in the reverse transcriptase segment of the po/gene. Several mutant strains of HIV have been characterized, and resistance to known therapeutic agents is due to mutations in the RT gene. Some of the most commonly observed mutants clinically are: the Y181C mutant, in which a tyrosine (Y), at codon 181, has been mutated to a cysteine (C) residue, and K103N where the lysine (K) at position 103 has been replaced by asparagine (N). Other mutants, which emerge with increasing frequency during treatment with known antlvirals, include the single mutants V106A, G190A, Y188C, and P236L; and the double mutants K103N/Y181C, K103N/P225H, K103N/V108I, andK103N/L100l.<br>
As therapy and prevention of HIV infection using antivirals continues, the emergence of new resistant strains is expected to increase. There is therefore an ongoing need for new inhibitors of RT, with different patterns of effectiveness against the various mutants.<br>
Compounds having tricyclic structures, which are inhibitors of HIV-1, are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,366,972. Other inhibitors of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase are described in Hargrave et at., J. Med Chem., 34, 2231 (1991).<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,705,499 proposes 8-arylalkyl- and 8-arylheteroalkyl-5,11-dihydro-6H-dipyrido[3,2-B:2',3'-E][1,4]diazepines as inhibitors of RT.<br>
WO 01/96338 and US patent 6,420,359 disclose diazeplne structures having quinoline and quinoline-N-oxide substituents as inhibitors of RT. The exemplified compounds have activity against HIV WT, single and double mutant strains. WO 02/076982 and WO 03/011862 also disclose diazepine structures having substituents structurally different from the present invention.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

Antiviral activity<br>
The compounds of the present invention are effective inhibitors of HIV-1 wild type reverse transcriptase as well as the clinically significant double mutant K103N/Y181C. The compounds also may be effective inhibitors of, for example, the single mutant enzymes Y181C, V106A, and Y188C.<br>
When administered in suitable dosage forms, they are useful in the treatment of AIDS, ARC and related disorders associated with HIV-1 infection. Another aspect of<br>
the invention, therefore, is a method for treating HIV-1 infection which comprises administering to a human being, infected by HIV-1, a therapeutically effective amount of a novel compound of formula I, as described above. Whether it be termed treatment or prophylaxis, the compounds may also be used to prevent perinatal transmission of HIV-1 from mother to baby, by administration to the mother prior to giving birth.<br>
The compounds of formula I may be administered in single or divided doses by the oral or parenteral routes. A suitable oral dosage for a compound of formula I would be in the range of about 0.5 mg to 3 g per day. A preferred oral dosage for a compound of formula I would be in the range of about 100 mg to 800 mg per day for a patient weighing 70 kg.

Methodology and synthesis<br>
Exemplary reaction schemes, disclosed in WO 01/96338, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference, show the many synthetic routes to the tricyclic core illustrated hereinafter. The compounds of the present invention may be made using the skills of a synthetic organic chemist. Exemplary reaction schemes are illustrated in Schemes 1 to 8. Substituents R2, R4, R5, and R11 are as defined herein.<br>
Schemes 1 to 3 show the methods for the preparation of aryl- and heteroaryl-phenols.<br>
Scheme 1<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
wherein P or P' is a hydroxy protecting group and X is a leaving group<br>
Briefly, protected phenol 1(i) can be coupled to a heterocycle or an aryl, for example<br>
via a Suzuki coupling, to give 1(N), which is deprotected if necessary, to give 1(v). Alternatively, phenol 1(iv) can be coupled to aryl or heterocyclic derivative 1(iii) to give1(v).<br>
Scheme 2<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
Briefly, the a-bromomethyl ketone 2(l) is condensed with an appropriate reagent, for example formamide, or RaCSNH2l to form the corresponding heterocyclic compounds 2(ii), 2(lli) or 2(v). If necessary, the heterocycle may be protected, giving 2(iv), before condensation with alcohol 4(i) shown below.<br>
Scheme 3<br>
 (Figure Remove)<br>
Alternatively, a heterocyclic moiety can be introduced by an in situ heterocycle formation. Aldehyde 3(1) can be condensed with NH2OH to give 3(li). Further condensation with an alkynyl derivative gives the heterocycle 3(H), which thereafter can be deprotected to give 3(iv).<br>
Scheme 4 shows a general method for the coupling of substituted phenols to the tricyclic core.<br>

modification of heterocycle oraryl<br>
deprotectlon or functional group modification, if necessary<br><br>
Compounds of formula I<br>
Generally, phenol 1(v) can be condensed with the alcohol 4(i) using, for example, a Mitsunobu type reaction, to give 4(ll). Thereafter, the heterocycle moiety can be further modified by, for example oxidation, or the heterocycle may be deprotected to give compounds of formula I.<br>
Alternatively, Schemes 5 to 8 show the coupling of the tricyclic core to phenols bearing substituents which are precursors of the E-D portion of compounds of formula I.<br>
Scheme 5<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
Alternatively, a boron-containing compound 5(1) can be condensed with the alcohol 4(i) to give 5(11). Thereafter, the heterocyclic or aryl moiety can be introduced by a Suzuki coupling to give 4(11).<br>
Scheme 6<br>
(Figure Remove)<br><br>
Alternatively, 6(il) can be produced by a condensation reaction as described above, in which Z is either an aldehyde or a halogen. The heterocycle moiety can then be introduced by direct coupling to produce 6(iii) or via an in situ synthesis to give 6(iv).<br>
Scheme 7<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
Alternatively, 4(1) and 7(i) can be condensed using a Mitsunobu reaction to give 7(ii). Thereafter, coupling, saponification or functional group modification can be used to convert 7(11) into compounds of formula I.<br>
Scheme 8<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
In another example, 8(i) can be converted into its corresponding amine by a palladium-mediated amination reaction followed by either deprotection or function group modifications, to give compounds of formula I. Alternatively, the amine in 8(ii) can be converted into compounds of formula I by a series of deprotections and/or functional group modifications.<br><br>
