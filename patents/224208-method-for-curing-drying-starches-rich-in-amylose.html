				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The subject of the invention is a novel process for<br>
preparing pregelatinized amylose-rich starches.<br>
Its subject is also the starches obtained by this<br>
process.<br>
Pregelatinized starches are generally prepared by<br>
thermal, chemical or mechanical techniques which can<br>
cause swelling of the starch granules so that they are<br>
soluble in cold water.<br>
The preferred techniques are spray-drying, cooking on a<br>
drum or extrusion. Autoclaving or indirect heating on a<br>
heat exchanger are cooking processes which tend to<br>
produce complex colloidal dispersions consisting of<br>
intact, fragmented and swollen granules.<br>
It is well known that amylose-rich starches, that is to<br>
say which have more than 50% by weight of amylose, are<br>
particularly difficult to disperse and require high<br>
cooking temperatures.<br>
The document US-A-3 086 890 describes a process for<br>
preparing pregelatinized amylose. This process consists<br>
in autoclaving at 191°C, under pressure, a solution of<br>
amylose containing at most 25% by weight of dry matter,<br>
and then drum-drying at 110-200°C. The powders obtained<br>
are amorphous and form irreversible gels after<br>
dispersion. Their apparent density is high, that is to<br>
say generally greater than 0.4 g/ml.<br>
The document US-A-3 607 394 describes a process for the<br>
pregelatinization of starches having amylose contents<br>
of less than 60% by weight. This process consists in<br>
cooking the starch at 149°C, followed by drum-drying,<br>
spray-drying or another type of drying means.<br>
The document EP 0 366 898 describes a coupled cooking/<br>
spray-drying process which makes it possible to obtain<br>
amorphous products, which are practically free of<br>
retrogradation, and which have an apparent density<br>
greater than that of an identical starch which has been<br>
subjected to the same process but in two separate<br>
stages, that is an apparent density greater than<br>
0.45 g/ml. The cooking of amylose-rich starches is<br>
carried out on a jet cooker at 143°C and the spray-<br>
drying is carried out with an inlet air temperature of<br>
220°C. This document presents, in Figure 7, a<br>
comparison of various prior art pregelatinized<br>
starches.<br>
Starting from this teaching, the applicant has now<br>
found, after long research studies, that it was<br>
possible to prepare a pregelatinized amylose-rich<br>
starch using a particular process leading to products<br>
of low apparent density while working at not very high<br>
temperatures, which none of the prior art techniques<br>
made it possible to obtain.<br>
The subject of the invention is therefore a process for<br>
preparing pregelatinized amylose-rich starch,<br>
characterized in that it comprises the steps consisting<br>
in:<br>
forming a suspension comprising an amylose-rich<br>
starch and water;<br>
subjecting the said suspension to steam jet<br>
cooking at a temperature of between 125 and<br>
135°C so as to obtain a pregelatinized amylose-<br>
rich starch paste;<br>
- drying the said pregelatinized starch on a drum<br>
dryer at a pressure of between 2 and 10 bar, so<br>
as to obtain a pregelatinized amylose-rich<br>
starch.<br>
The pregelatinized amylose-rich starch obtained may<br>
then be recovered and ground so as to obtain a powder<br>
having a particle size which is chosen according to the<br>
uses which will be subsequently made thereof.<br>
The expression "amylose-rich starches" according for<br>
the purposes of the present invention denotes starches<br>
having an amylose content greater than or equal to 50%<br>
by weight, and preferably of between 50 and 80% by<br>
weight, obtained from any plant origin, such as in<br>
particular maize, potato, cassava.<br>
Preferably, the process according to the invention uses<br>
a maize starch such as, for example, EURYLON® marketed<br>
by the applicant.<br>
The invention also applies to chemically or physically<br>
modified amylose-rich starches. Preferably, the<br>
modified starch will be chosen from the group<br>
consisting of acetylated, hydroxypropylated, carboxy-<br>
methylated and fluidified starches, and starch octenyl<br>
succinates.<br>
According to a preferred variant of the process<br>
according to the invention, an acetylated starch will<br>
be chosen.<br>
The starch suspension is prepared at a dry matter<br>
content of between 30 and 40% by weight so as to obtain<br>
a suspension in water.<br>
This suspension is then pregelatinized using a tuyere<br>
at the outlet of which a steam counter-pressure is<br>
applied which is sufficient to reach a cooking<br>
temperature for the suspension of between 125 and 135°C<br>
while maintaining an acceptable viscosity so that the<br>
flow rate of the milk coming out after cooking is not<br>
too low. For example, a counter-pressure of the order<br>
of 2 to 3 bar will be applied.<br>
Surprisingly and unexpectedly, this cooking temperature<br>
is necessary and sufficient to obtain good<br>
pregelatinized starch solubility. The amylose fraction<br>
exists, according to the process in accordance with the<br>
invention, in amorphous form, whereas the prior art<br>
processes for cooking amylose-rich starches lead to an<br>
amylose which has a high tendency to undergo retro-<br>
gradation.<br>
The expression "tuyere" is understood to mean any<br>
direct steam jet cooking device allowing instant<br>
cooking of a starch suspension using pressurized steam.<br>
A pregelatinized starch paste is obtained after this<br>
cooking, which is then dried on a drum dryer.<br>
Such an equipment makes it possible to reproduce, on<br>
one and the same device, the cooking and drying stages<br>
by exploiting the heat transferred from the surface of<br>
the drums heated with steam to the starch paste. Steam<br>
pressure values of the order of 2 to 10 bar will be<br>
applied, for example, according to the type of starch<br>
used. The starch paste is uniformly spread in a thin<br>
film over the hot surface of the drums by applying<br>
components. The drums are driven in rotation, at a<br>
speed of the order of 5 to 8 revolutions per minute.<br>
Thus, the cooking of the paste is continued,, followed<br>
by drying. The film formed is then scraped using a<br>
scraping blade so as to detach a sheet which can then<br>
be ground.<br>
The process according to the invention makes it<br>
possible to homogeneously obtain pregelatinized<br>
amylose-rich starches without the need for the use of<br>
very high temperatures as taught by the prior art. The<br>
process according to the invention is perticularly<br>
advantageous because it uses simple techniques, with a<br>
lower energy cost than the known techniques of spray-<br>
drying or autoclaving.<br>
The pregelatinized amylose-rich starches according to<br>
the invention are characterized by an apparent density<br>
of less than 0.4 g/ml for a mean particle size of<br>
100 micrometres, which is particularly surprising given<br>
the higher densities obtained according to the prior<br>
art techniques and in particular those described in<br>
patent EP-B1 0 366 898.<br>
Their solubility in warm water is good, in the region<br>
of 80%, whereas it is less than 30% when the tuyere<br>
cooking stage is eliminated.<br>
These starches have, in addition, various applicative<br>
advantages such as, in particular, a good compression<br>
capacity, and in particular very good capacities to<br>
form a film. This capacity is particularly advantageous<br>
for film coating tablets in particular, but also for<br>
numerous other applications requiring the formation of<br>
a barrier to moisture and to air. To the knowledge of<br>
the applicant, such pregelatinized amylose-rich<br>
starches capable of having film-forming properties did<br>
not exist on the market. The subject of the invention<br>
is therefore, in addition, the use of pregelatinized<br>
amylose-rich starches for the manufacture of soft<br>
gelatin capsules or of hard gelatin capsules, as well<br>
as for the coating of solid forms in pharmacy, human<br>
foods, animal foods, agrochemistry or plant substances<br>
such as seeds.<br>
The subject of the invention is also the use of<br>
amylose-rich starches obtained according to the<br>
invention for the preparation of freshening films, also<br>
called flavour sheets. These flavour sheets are small<br>
squares of edible films, which are very fine, highly<br>
flavoured, and used as breath fresheners by dissolving<br>
rapidly in the buccal cavity. The applicant has<br>
observed that in addition to the remarkable film-<br>
forming properties of the starches according to the<br>
invention, the latter had an advantageous capacity to<br>
encapsulate molecules with low solubility in water,<br>
such as flavourings or certain active ingredients.<br>
Indeed, during the formulation of such films based on<br>
film-forming polymers, when about 5% of flavouring or<br>
of active ingredient which are sparingly soluble in<br>
water is added to the film-forming preparation, a total<br>
phase separation occurs, during the spreading of the<br>
film, between the hydrophobic molecules and the other<br>
components. The film-forming solution is pushed to the<br>
sides of the band of film, whereas the centre is only<br>
composed of flavouring and of active ingredient. The<br>
film obtained therefore does not constitute a<br>
homogeneous film-coating. The addition, before<br>
incorporation of the flavouring, of a pregelatinized<br>
amylose-rich starch according to the invention allows,<br>
surprisingly and unexpectedly, inclusion of the<br>
flavourings or active ingredients which are sparingly<br>
soluble in water, on the one hand, and an excellent<br>
film quality, on the other hand. Without wishing to be<br>
bound to any theory, the applicant is of the opinion<br>
that this encapsulation property is linked to the<br>
amorphous state of the precooked amylose according to<br>
the process in accordance with the invention, given<br>
that the precooked amylose-rich starches according to<br>
the prior art processes do not possess this<br>
encapsulation property. The film obtained has the<br>
desired properties, namely good solubility, adequate<br>
mechanical properties, strong flavouring and no<br>
adherence between each film during packaging.<br>
Thus, an edible film which is highly flavoured or which<br>
comprises an active ingredient which is sparingly<br>
soluble in water, characterized in that it comprises a<br>
pregelatinized amylose-rich starch according to the<br>
invention, constitutes, to the knowledge of the<br>
applicant, a novel industrial product. The expression<br>
"sparingly soluble in water" is understood to mean,<br>
according to the present invention, flavourings or<br>
active ingredients which have a solubility in water of<br>
less than 5% by weight.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the film<br>
according to the invention, the latter comprises, on a<br>
dry matter basis, 5 to 40%, preferably 5 to 25% of<br>
pregelatinized amylose-rich starch according to the<br>
invention. According to a still more preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention, the said pregelatinized<br>
amylose-rich starch is stabilized, for example, by<br>
acetylation or hydroxypropylation.<br>
The film comprises, in addition, any other film-forming<br>
polymer commonly used in practice, such as in<br>
particular amylopectin-rich starches, modified or<br>
otherwise, amylose-rich starches, modified or<br>
otherwise, standard or special maltodextrins, film-<br>
forming polysaccharides and proteins such as gelatin,<br>
pullulan, plant gums, gluten.<br>
According to a preferred variant, the edible film<br>
comprises 5 to 40% of pregelatinized amylose-rich<br>
starch according to the invention and 40 to 80% of<br>
amylopectin-rich starch. The balance for 100% consists<br>
of flavourings, active ingredients, sweeteners, one or<br>
more humectants and optionally colourings. The final<br>
water content of the films according to the invention<br>
is generally about 12%.<br>
The expression amylopectin-rich starch is understood to<br>
mean the so-called waxy starches, derived in particular<br>
from maize or potato.<br>
According to a still more preferred variant, the said<br>
film comprises, on a dry matter basis, 5 to 40%,<br>
preferably 5 to 25%, of pregelatinized amylose-rich<br>
starch according to the invention, and 40 to 80%,<br>
preferably 40 to 70% of waxy starch fluidified by the<br>
acid route.<br>
A waxy starch derived from maize fluidified by<br>
techniques known to persons skilled in the art would be<br>
preferably chosen.<br>
Of course, the film according to the invention may be<br>
used as it is as a flavour sheet for freshening the<br>
breath, but it may also be used for the film-coating of<br>
various supports, in particular dietary or<br>
pharmaceutical supports. There may be mentioned,<br>
without limitation, the film-coating of tablets,<br>
confectioneries, or any other support.<br>
The advantageous properties of encapsulation of<br>
substances sparingly soluble in water of the starches<br>
according to the invention may also be exploited in any<br>
other type of application requiring such properties, in<br>
aqueous medium or in the dry state.<br>
The invention will be understood more clearly on<br>
reading the following examples, which are intended to<br>
be explanatory and nonlimiting.<br>
Example 1<br>
Amylose-rich starches, modified or otherwise, are<br>
prepared according to a process comprising the<br>
following steps:<br>
- preparation of a suspension of starch and water<br>
cooking in a tuyere<br>
drying on a drum dryer<br>
recovery of a powder<br>
In all cases, the initial starch is EURYLON®7 marketed<br>
by the applicant, having an amylose content of 70% by<br>
weight.<br>
The various process parameters are presented in<br>
Table 1, as well as the apparent densities and the mean<br>
particle sizes of the various products obtained. The<br>
apparent density is measured according to the<br>
pharmaceutical technical method 2.9.16 of the European<br>
Pharmacopoeia, 3rd edition. The mean particle size is<br>
calculated from the particle size measured by sieving<br>
on successive sieves of 500, 315, 200, 150, 100 and<br>
50 micrometres.<br>
The displacement density is measured according to the<br>
method described in patent EP-B1 0 366 898.<br>
Example 2<br>
In order to illustrate the film-forming properties, the<br>
product obtained according to test No. 3 of the<br>
preceding example is solubilized in hot water (70-<br>
80°C), with mechanical stirring, at 15% of dry matter.<br>
The Brookfield viscosity is 4 000 mPa/s at 70°C and<br>
5 000 mPas s at 60°C.<br>
This solution is placed on a polyethylene support over<br>
a thickness of 45.7 micrometres.<br>
The solution thus deposited is dried at room<br>
temperature, and gives a rigid film, which is<br>
nonbrittle, and which is insoluble in water.<br>
This film can give rise to very numerous applications,<br>
since it can serve to coat all types of solid forms<br>
which it is desired to protect, whether they are<br>
pharmaceutical (tablets, gelatin capsules), dietary<br>
(fries, tart bases, confectioneries) or agricultural<br>
(seeds, granules).<br>
These film-forming properties may also be applied in<br>
the manufacture of soft gelatin capsules or hard<br>
gelatin capsules.<br>
Example 3<br>
Flavour sheets are prepared according to the following<br>
procedure:<br>
Formula<br>
• In a jacketed stainless-steel bowl, disperse the<br>
CLEARGUM in a mixture of water, glycerol and<br>
saccharinate. Heat to 90°C.<br>
• Pour into the bowl of a KENWOOD mixer, add the<br>
pregelatinized amylose-rich starch and the<br>
flavouring. Mix for 1 minute at the minimum<br>
speed (solution S).<br>
• Pour the solution S into the stainless-steel<br>
bowl and heat to 85°C, degas the mixture as much<br>
as possible.<br>
• When the mixture is at 85°C, form a film on a<br>
plastic plate (thickness of paste = 1.5 mm) with<br>
an automatic film applicator (bar-coater B-2105,<br>
RK printcoat) equipped with a scale preheated to<br>
60°C.<br>
• Allow to dry in an oven at 20°C and 80% relative<br>
humidity for 2 days and then end the drying at<br>
20°C under an uncontrolled atmosphere.<br>
The film thus obtained, which is highly flavoured, is<br>
very soluble, supple and flexible, nonbrittle and not<br>
cracked, regular and homogeneous as regards the<br>
distribution of the flavour, transparent. It does not<br>
stick on contact with other films during prolonged<br>
storage. It can therefore be easily used as freshening<br>
flavour sheet, or in order to wrap or coat any type of<br>
support, in particular a dietary or pharmaceutical<br>
support.<br>
A film prepared in the same manner but without<br>
incorporating starch according to the invention is<br>
completely heterogeneous in its centre and impossible<br>
to detach from its support in the form of a uniform<br>
sheet.<br>
