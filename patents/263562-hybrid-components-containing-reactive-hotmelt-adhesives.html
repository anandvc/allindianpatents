PROCESS WITH WHICH TO PROVIDE SUPPORT TO A DRIVER OF A MOTOR VEHICLE ATTACHED TO A LURCHING TRAILER<br>
The invention is with regard to a process, in accordance with the preamble of patent claim 1, with which to provide support to the driver of a motor vehicle that has a lurching trailer attached to it as well as a corresponding device in accordance with the preamble of patent claim 1.<br>
In the case of a vehicle with a trailer, pendular swinging of the trailer around the vertical axis could arise at speeds that are too high. This pendular swinging usually emerges at speeds that are above a so-called critical speed, which is particularly subject to the constructive characteristics and loading of the trailer. The motor vehicle-trailer team becomes instable above the critical speed.<br>
Identifying pendular swinging of the trailer by evaluating sensor information is established in DE-10031266 as well as automatic activation of the vehicle's or trailer's brakes i.e., without the driver having to do the same, in a situation of critical trailer oscillation. The tyres of the vehicle or trailer can thereby be subject to symmetrical (equal strength right and left) as well individual braking. Over and above this, attenuation of trailer oscillation with the help of automatic steering intervention in an active front-wheel or rear-wheel drive steering is established. Several driving state variables such as e.g., lateral acceleration or the yaw rate of the vehicle are thereby usually evaluated for situation recognition. In the case of the process mentioned, brake intervention is basically executed when a critical driving situation has been recognised and a trailer is connected.<br>
The problem hereby is trailer recognition in particular. It is, e.g., established that a trailer can be recognised by appraising the electrical trailer connection.  Not all<br><br>
trailer types, however, have an electrical connection by which they can be recognised. Over and above this, an electrical defect in the electrical system of the trailer could also result in error recognition. In this case, an automatic stabilising function would execute a braking procedure even if no trailer is present and/or not execute any braking procedure even though a trailer is present.<br>
It is, therefore, the objective of the present invention to provide the driver with support during vehicle stabilisation in a critical driving situation and thereby avoid erroneous braking interventions.<br>
This objective is met in accordance with the invention by features specified in patent claim 1 as well as in patent claim 5. Other designs of the invention are the subject matter of the sub claims.<br>
An essential aspect of the invention is that the brake intervention is not executed immediately upon recognition of a critical driving situation. The driver is instead at first only informed that a critical lurching of the vehicle's trailer is prevailing in order to prompt the driver to brake. If the driver then brakes, he will be supported during the braking procedure in that a braking pressure will be automatically set at the vehicle's brakes with which a vehicular deceleration, particularly an optimal or possibly optimal vehicular deceleration is achieved for the purpose of stabilising the trailer. If brake activation by the driver is, for example, too weak then the brake pressure will be automatically increased to an optimal value that is subject to the driving situation. If activation of the brake pedal is, in contrast, too strong then the brake pressure is automatically restricted. This type of process and/or a corresponding driver support system has the basic advantage that automatic stabilisation is executed only when braking has already been initiated by the driver. Erroneous braking interventions, particularly if no trailer has been connected at all, are thereby avoided.<br><br>
Braking pressure that has been set in the stabilisation phase is preferably subject to the driver's primary pressure (i.e. braking pressure executed by the driver) and/or subject to the gradient of the driver's primary pressure. Over and above this, the automatically set brake pressure is preferably subject to the driving situation, particularly the vehicle's speed, lateral acceleration and/or the yaw rate of the vehicle. Stabilisation intervention can thus be optimally customised to the driving situation and to the driver's wish.<br>
The type of driver support can vary depending upon the driving situation. No action is preferably executed in driving situations in which oscillations of the trailer is not critical. If the force of the oscillations lies within a pre-determined range a warning can for example be issued to the driver and the driver can be supported in stabilising the vehicle if he initiates braking. If the stabilisation system identifies a strong oscillation of the trailer, immediate automatic braking is preferably initiated. False reaction by the driver in which the driver, for example, accelerates in order to stabilise the vehicle instead of braking is thereby prevented.<br>
The yaw velocity and/or the lateral acceleration of the vehicle (taking the driver's wishes into consideration) are/is preferably evaluated in order to identify a pendular movement of the trailer. Corresponding sensors are already present in house in the case of conventional driving dynamics regulations. The driver, on his part, can fall back on these.<br>
The process, in accordance with the invention, with which to support the driver and stabilise the vehicle is preferably executed only above a pre-determined speed threshold.<br>
A device with which to support the driver in the case of a lurching trailer preferably comprises a control unit with a sensor attached to it for identification of<br><br>
a lurching movement of the trailer, a device for warning which is controlled by the control unit subject to the driving condition, as well as an active braking system. In the event that the driver initiates braking due to the warning notice, the control unit will determine a default braking pressure (or a proportional value) with which vehicular deceleration, particularly an optimal or possibly optimal vehicular deceleration, can be achieved for the purpose of stabilising the vehicle. This default brake pressure is then set by the control unit through corresponding control of the active braking system such as, e.g. of the hydro power unit of a driving dynamics regulation system.<br>
The invention is described in greater detail below by means of the enclosed drawings.<br>
Figure 1 is a block illustration of the basic process statuses of a stabilisation process in accordance with a first design of the invention;<br>
Figure 2 is the progression of the wheel-brake pressure subject to the driver's requirement;<br>
Figure 3 is a block illustration of the basic process statuses of a stabilisation process in accordance with a second design of the invention; and<br>
Figure 4 is a schematic illustration of a device with which to support the driver in the case of a lurching trailer.<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic illustration of the basic process statuses of a stabilisation process with which to support the driver in the case of a lurching trailer. Block 1, thereby, represents the "Situation Recognition" status, which is executed by corresponding electronics such as e.g., by a control unit 13 (refer Figure 4). Particularly signals which describe the lateral dynamics of the vehicle, such as<br><br>
e.g., lateral acceleration or the yaw rate, are thereby processed and evaluated. The associated sensor is marked with reference number 12 in Figure 4. The anyway already existing ESP sensor can, for example, be used for situation identification. The electric trailer connection can be appraised in order to identify whether a trailer is connected at all.<br>
Critical trailer oscillation is identified if the monitored driving state variables fulfill a pre-determined condition e.g. if the yaw rate or the vehicle-lateral acceleration exceeds pre-determined threshold values. In this case, the driver is optically or acoustically warned in Block 2 and requested to initiate a braking procedure. If the monitored quantities do not fulfill the pre-determined condition, then no further action will be executed, whereby status 3 will be accepted.<br>
After issuing a warning to the driver in status 3, the driver can himself decide whether he wants to brake or not. In case the driver does not brake (case N), the process will move to status 3 and no further action takes place. If the driver does, however, brake (case J), he will be supported during stabilisation of the vehicle by an automatic brake intervention in status 4. The force of the automatic brake intervention is thus particularly subject to the driving situation i.e., to the vehicle's speed and to the force of the lurching as well as, preferably, also to the force of the brake action (driver's primary pressure) or to the slew rate of the driver's primary pressure.<br>
With curve 10, Figure 2 exemplifies a wheel-brake pressure PR set at a wheel for a pre-determined driving situation, subject to the driver's primary pressure pp. No automated driver support takes place in a first section of range A with very low primary pressures (the driver operates the brake with only relatively weak pressure) so that the wheel-brake pressure PR corresponds to the driver's primary pressure PF (curve 9). With increasing primary pressure PF, a default brake pressure Pso, which has been computed in a situation-dependent manner<br><br>
by the control unit 13, is then set at the wheel brakes through automatic control of the hydro power unit 15. If the driver applies the brakes too weakly (range A), the wheel-brake pressure PR will be correspondingly increased; in contrast, if the driver brakes too strongly (range B), the wheel-brake pressure PR will be restricted to the default value Pso. Preferably, no automatic restriction will be executed in the case of very high driver primary pressures PF in order to enable the driver to over-brake the vehicle. The wheel-brake pressure PR (curve 10) corresponds again to the driver's wish (curve 9) in this range C. Other characteristic curves are also conceivable; in particular, one or several of ranges A, B, C can also have a breadth of 0.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates the essential process statuses of a process to support the driver in the case of a lurching trailer, in accordance with another design of the invention.<br>
Statuses 1 - 4 thereby correspond to statuses 1 - 4 in Figure 1 which is the reason why the description for Figure 1 is referred to with regard to the explanation. Unlike the process in Figure 1, various stabilisation measures are introduced here, subject to the force of the trailer's oscillation. If the fact that the trailer is not oscillating (refer arrow 8) is recognised in status 1 (situation recognition), no further action is executed and the process moves over to status 3. In the case of moderate oscillation (arrow 7), the driver is again provided an optical or acoustic warning notice to initiate braking. In the case of stronger oscillation (arrow 6), the vehicle is, in contrast, immediately stabilised by an automatic brake intervention independent of the driver's action (status 5). This automatic brake intervention 5 is, in turn, subject to the driving situation (e.g. subject to the vehicle's speed and the oscillating force) and is controlled by the control unit 13.<br><br>
Figure 4 is a block illustration of the basic elements of a device with which to stabilise a vehicle attached to a lurching trailer. This comprises a control unit 13 with a sensor 12 attached to it, which recognises a critical driving situation by evaluating the sensor signals. Sensor 12 comprises e.g., a yaw rate sensor and/or a lateral acceleration sensor.<br>
An optical or acoustic warning notice 14, which can be activated by control unit 13, is provided to warn the driver. Brake activation by the driver is recognised by means of a brake pedal sensor 11, which is also attached to the control unit 13. The control unit 13 is, furthermore, connected to an active brake system 10 such as e.g., to an established ESP hydro power unit that can be electrically controlled by the control unit 13, as required, in order to support the driver during vehicle stabilisation. The control unit comprises an algorithm with which the process described above can be executed.<br><br>
