				<td>A CATALYST COMPOSITION AND METHODS FOR ITS PREPARATION AND USE IN A POLYMERIZATION PROCESS<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates to a catalyst composition, a method for<br>
preparing the catalyst composition and its use in a process for polymerizing olefins. In particular, the invention is directed to a method for preparing a catalyst composition comprising or made from a polymerization catalyst and at one gelling agent or organogelator.<br>
[0002]	Advances in polymerization and catalysis have resulted in the<br>
capability to produce many new polymers having improved physical and chemical properties useful in a wide variety of superior products and applications. With the development of new catalysts the choice of polymerization-type (solution, slurry, high pressure or gas phase) for producing a particular polymer has been greatly expanded. Also, advances in polymerization technology have provided more efficient, highly productive and economically enhanced processes. Especially illustrative of these advances is the development of technology utilizing bulky ligand metallocene catalyst systems. Regardless of these technological advances in the polyolefin industry, common problems, as well as new challenges associated with process operability still exist. For example, the tendency for a gas phase or slurry phase process to foul, sheet or generate static (of any combination thereof) remains a challenge.<br>
[0003]	In known continuous gas phase and slurry processes, fouling and<br>
sheeting on the wails of the reactor, which act as a heat transfer surface, can result in many operability problems. For example, poor heat transfer during polymerization can result from polymer particles adhering to the walls of the reactor and continuing to polymerize on the walls, thereby leading to premature reactor shutdowns. Also, depending on the reactor conditions, some of the polymer may dissolve in the reactor diluent and redeposit, for example, on the surfaces of metal heat exchangers and again contributing to poor heat transfer and cooling.<br>
[0004]	Further, fouling, sheeting or static generation (or any combination<br>
thereof) in a continuous gas phase or slurry process can lead to the ineffective operation of various reactor systems. For example, premature shutdowns can occur when the cooling system of the recycle system, the temperature probes utilized for process control or the distributor plates (or combinations thereof) are affected by fouling, sheeting or static generation.<br>
[0005]	Various process operability problems and solutions have been<br>
addressed in the art. For example, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,792,592, 4,803,251, 4,855,370 and 5,391,657 all discuss techniques for reducing static generation in a polymerization process by introducing to the process for example, water, alcohols, ketones, or inorganic chemical additives or any combination thereof; PCT publication WO 97/14721 published April 24, 1997 discusses the suppression of fines that can cause sheeting by adding an inert hydrocarbon to the reactor; U.S. Patent No. 5,627,243 discusses a new type of distributor plate for use in fluidized bed gas phase reactors; PCT publication WO 96/08520 discusses avoiding the introduction of a scavenger into the reactor; U.S. Patent No. 5,461,123 discusses using sound waves to reduce sheeting; U.S. Patent No. 5,066,736 and EP-A1 0 549 252 discuss the introduction of an activity retarder to the reactor to reduce agglomerates; U.S. Patent No. 5,610,244 relates to feeding make-up monomer directly into the reactor above the bed to avoid fouling and improve polymer quality; U.S. Patent No. 5,126,414 discusses including an oligomer removal system for reducing distributor plate fouling and providing for polymers free of gels; EP-A1 0 453 116 published October 23,1991 discusses the introduction of antistatic agents to the reactor for reducing the amount of sheets and agglomerates; U.S. Patent No. 4,012,574 discusses adding a surface-active compound, a perfluorocarbon group, to the reactor to reduce fouling; U.S. Patent 5,026,795 discusses the addition of an antistatic agent with a liquid carrier to the polymerization zone in the reactor; U.S. Patent No. 5,410,002 discusses using a conventional Ziegler-Natta titanium/magnesium supported catalyst system where a selection of antistatic agents are added directly to the reactor to reduce fouling; U.S. Patent Nos. 5,034,480 and 5,034,481 discuss a reaction product of a conventional Ziegler-Natta titanium catalyst with an antistat to produce ultrahigh molecular weight ethylene polymers; U.S. Patent No. 3,082,198 discusses introducing an amount of a carboxylic acid dependent on the quantity of water in a process for polymerizing ethylene using a titanium/aluminum organometallic catalysts in a hydrocarbon liquid medium; and U.S. Patent No. 3,919,185 describes a slurry process using a nonpolar hydrocarbon diluent using a conventional Ziegler-Natta-type or Phillips-type catalyst and a polyvalent metal salt of an organic acid having a molecular weight of at least 300.<br>
[0006]	There are various other known methods for improving operability<br>
including coating the polymerization equipment, for example, treating the walls of a reactor using chromium compounds as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,532,311<br>
and 4,876,320; injecting various agents into the process, for example PCT Publication WO 97/46599 published December 11,1997 discusses feeding into a lean zone in a polymerization reactor an unsupported, soluble metallocene catalyst system and injecting antifoulants or antistatic agents into the reactor; controlling the polymerization rate, particularly on start-up; and reconfiguring the reactor design.<br>
[0007]	Others in the art to improve process operability have discussed<br>
modifying the catalyst system by preparing the catalyst system in different ways. For example, methods in the art include combining the catalyst system components in a particular order; manipulating the ratio of the various catalyst system components; varying the contact time or temperature or combinations thereof when combining the components of a catalyst system; or simply adding various compounds to the catalyst system. These techniques or combinations thereof are discussed in the literature. Especially illustrative in the art is the preparation procedures and methods for producing bulky ligand metallocene catalyst systems, more particularly supported bulky ligand metallocene catalyst systems with reduced tendencies for fouling and better operability. Examples of these include: WO 96/11961 published April 26,1996 discusses as a component of a supported catalyst system an antistatic agent for reducing fouling and sheeting in a gas, slurry or liquid pool polymerization process; U.S. Patent No. 5,283,278 is directed towards the prepolymerization of a metallocene catalyst or a conventional Ziegler-Natta catalyst in the presence of an antistatic agent; U.S. Patent No. 5,332,706 and 5,473,028 have resorted to a particular technique for forming a catalyst by incipient impregnation; U.S. Patent Nos. 5,427,991 and 5,643,847 describe the chemical bonding of non-coordinating anionic activators to supports; U.S. Patent No. 5,492,975 discusses polymer bound metallocene catalyst systems; U.S Patent No. 5,661,095 discusses supporting a metallocene catalyst on a copolymer of an olefin and an unsaturated silane; PCT publication WO 97/06186 published February 20, 1997 teaches removing inorganic and organic impurities after formation of the metallocene catalyst itself; PCT publication WO 97/15602 published May 1, 1997 discusses readily supportable metal complexes; PCT publication WO 97/27224 published July 31, 1997 relates to forming a supported transition metal compound in the presence of an unsaturated organic compound having at least one terminal double bond; and EP-A2-811 638 discusses using a metallocene catalyst and an activating cocatalyst in a polymerization process in the presence of a nitrogen containing antistatic agent.<br>
[0008]	While, all these possible solutions might reduce the level of fouling or<br>
sheeting somewhat, some are expensive to employ or may not reduce fouling and<br>
sheeting to a level sufficient to successfully operate a continuous process,<br>
particularly a commercial or large-scale process, or a combination thereof.<br>
[0009]	Applicants discovered that using a carboxylate metal salt in<br>
conjunction with a supported catalyst system, preferably a bulky ligand<br>
metallocene catalyst system, more preferably a supported bulky ligand<br>
metallocene catalyst system, substantially improves process operability. See for<br>
example U.S. Patent Application Serial No.: 09/397,409, filed September 16, 1999<br>
and U.S. Patent Application Serial No.: 09/397,410, filed September 16, 1999.<br>
[0010]	Now, it has been discovered that a new general class of compounds<br>
in combination with polymerization catalysts are capable of improving reactor operability. Thus, it is possible to have a polymerization process capable of operating continuously with enhanced reactor operability and at the same time produce new and improved polymers. Now it is also possible to have a continuously operating polymerization process with more stable catalyst productivities, reduced fouling/sheeting tendencies and increased duration of operation.<br>
[0011]	This invention provides a method of making a new and improved<br>
catalyst composition and for its use in a polymerizing process. The method<br>
comprises the step of combining, contacting, blending or mixing (or a combination<br>
thereof) a catalyst system, preferably a supported catalyst system, with a gelling<br>
agent. In one embodiment the catalyst system comprises a conventional-type<br>
transition metal catalyst compound. In the most preferred embodiment the catalyst<br>
system comprises a bulky ligand metallocene catalyst compound. The<br>
combination of the catalyst system and the gelling agent is useful in any olefin<br>
polymerization process. The preferred polymerization processes are a gas phase<br>
or a slurry phase process, most preferably a gas phase process.<br>
[0012]	In another embodiment, the invention provides for a method of<br>
making a catalyst composition useful for the polymerization of olefin(s), the method including combining, contacting, blending or mixing (or combinations thereof) a polymerization catalyst with at least one gelling agent.<br>
[0013]	In one preferred embodiment, the invention is directed to a catalyst<br>
composition comprising a catalyst compound, preferably a conventional-type transition metal catalyst compound, more preferably a bulky ligand metallocene<br>
catalyst compound, an activator or cocatalyst (or combinations thereof), a carrier, and a gelling agent.<br>
[0014]	In yet another embodiment, the invention relates to a process for<br>
polymerizing olefin(s) in the presence of a catalyst composition comprising a<br>
polymerization catalyst and a gelling agent, preferably the polymerization catalyst<br>
comprises a carrier, more preferably the polymerization catalyst comprises one or<br>
more of a combination of a conventional-type catalyst compound or a bulky ligand<br>
metallocene catalyst compound or a combination thereof.<br>
[0015]	In stilf another embodiment, the invention provides for a process for<br>
polymerizing olefin(s) in the presence of a polymerization catalyst having been<br>
combined, contacted, blended, or mixed with at least one gelling agent.<br>
[0016]	The invention is directed to a method for making a catalyst<br>
composition and to the catalyst composition itself. The invention also relates to a polymerization process having improved operability and product capabilities using the catalyst composition. It has been surprisingly discovered that using a gelling agent in combination with a catalyst system results in a substantially improved polymerization process.<br>
[0017]	The general class of compounds that are useful in the present<br>
invention are gelling agents, which are compounds that are capable of forming thermally - reversible viscoelastic liquid-like or solid-like materials (organogels) in organic liquids (for example, in n-hexane). That is, compounds useful in the invention characteristically form organogels. Specifically, organogels are formed by warming gelling agents in an organic liquid until they dissolve and wherein after dissolution, the solution containing the gelling agent is allowed to stand or cool until gelation occurs wherein the agent becomes a colloidal aggregate that immobilizes the liquid to a variant degree.<br>
[0018]	All polymerization catalysts including conventional-type transition<br>
metal catalysts are suitable for use in the polymerizing process of the invention.<br>
But processes that use bulky ligand or bridged bulky ligand metallocene catalysts<br>
(or combinations thereof) are particularly preferred. The following is a non-limiting<br>
description of the various polymerization catalysts useful in the invention.<br>
[0019]	Conventional transition metal catalysts are those traditional Ziegler-<br>
Natta catalysts and Phillips-type chromium catalyst well known in the art. Examples of conventional transition metal catalysts are discussed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,115,639; 4,077,904; 4,482,687; 4,564,605; 4,721,763; 4,879,359; and 4,960,741. The conventional transition metal catalyst compounds that may be<br>
used in the present invention include transition metal compounds from Groups III<br>

excluding some conventional chromium catalyst compounds are activated with one<br>
or more of the conventional cocatalysts described below.<br>
[0026]	Conventional cocatalyst compounds for the above conventional<br>

Volume 1, Experimental Methods in Catalytic Research (Academic Press, 1968)<br>
(specifically see pages 67-96). This preferred procedure involves the use of a<br>
classical BET apparatus for nitrogen absorption. Another method well known in<br>

The prepolymerization can be carried out batchwise or continuously in gas, solution or slurry phase including at elevated pressures. The prepolymerization can take place with any olefin monomer or combination of monomers or in the presence of any molecular weight controlling agent such as hydrogen or combinations thereof.

[0089]	Preferably, the polymerization catalyst, preferably a bulky ligand<br>

In one embodiment the polymerization catalyst is used in an unsupported form, preferably in a liquid form such as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,317,036 and 5,693,727 and European publication EP-A-0 593 083. The polymerization catalyst in liquid form can be fed with a gelling agent to a reactor using the injection methods described in PCT publication WO 97/46599.<br>
[0096]	Where a gelling agent and an unsupported bulky ligand metallocene<br>

[0098]	Polymerization processes include solution, gas phase, slurry phase<br>

olefin monomers having from 2 to 30 carbon atoms, preferably 2 to12 carbon atoms, and more preferably 2 to 8 carbon atoms. The invention is particularly well suited to the polymerization of two or more olefin monomers of ethylene, propylene, butene-1, pentene-1, 4-methyl-pentene-1, hexene-1, octene-1 and decene-1.<br>

[0103]	In one embodiment, the invention is directed to a polymerization<br>
process, particularly a gas phase or slurry phase process, for polymerizing<br>
propylene alone or with one or more other monomers including ethylene, or other<br>
olefins having from 4 to 12 carbon atoms (or combinations thereof). Polypropylene<br>
polymers may be produced using the particularly bridged bulky ligand metallocene<br>
catalysts as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,296,434 and 5,278,264.<br>
[0104]	Typically in a gas phase polymerization process a continuous cycle is<br>
employed where in one part of the cycle of a reactor system, a cycling gas stream, otherwise known as a recycle stream or fluidizing medium, is heated in the reactor by the heat of polymerization. This heat is removed from the recycle composition in another part of the cycle by a cooling system external to the reactor. Generally, in a gas fluidized bed process for producing polymers, a gaseous stream containing one or more monomers is continuously cycled through a fluidized bed in the presence of a catalyst under reactive conditions. The gaseous stream is withdrawn from the,fluidized bed and recycled back into the reactor. Simultaneously, polymer product is withdrawn from the reactor and fresh monomer is added to replace the polymerized monomer. See for example U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
4,543,399; 4,588,790; 5,028,670; 5,317,036; 5,352,749; 5,405,922; 5,436,304; 5,453,471; 5,462,999; 5,616,661; and 5,668,228.<br>

to 120°C, preferably from 60°C to 115°C, more preferably in the range of from 70°<br>
C to 110°C, and most preferably in the range of from 70°C to 95°C.<br>

invention include series or multistage polymerization processes. Also gas phase<br>

[0109]	A slurry polymerization process generally uses pressures in the range<br>
of from 1 to 50 atmospheres and even greater and temperatures in the range of 0° C to 120°C. In a slurry polymerization, a suspension of solid, particulate polymer is formed in a liquid polymerization diluent medium to which ethylene and comonomers and often hydrogen along with catalyst are added. The suspension including diluent is intermittently or continuously removed from the reactor where the volatile components are separated from the polymer and recycled, optionally after a distillation, to the reactor. The liquid diluent employed in the polymerization medium is typically an alkane having from 3 to 7 carbon atoms, preferably a branched alkane. The medium employed should be liquid under the conditions of polymerization and relatively inert. When a propane medium is used the process must be operated above the reaction diluent critical temperature and pressure. Preferably, a hexane or an isobutane medium is employed.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
[0126]        In order to provide a better understanding of the present invention,<br>
including representative advantages thereof, the following examples are offered.<br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of Catalyst A<br>
[0127]        Into a 2 gal (7.57 liter) reactor was charged 1060g of a 30 weight<br>
percent Methylalumoxane (MAO) solution in toluene available from Albemarle Corp,<br>
Baton Rouge LA, followed by 1.5 liters of toluene.    While stirring 19.8 g of<br>
dimethylsilyl-bis(tetrahydroindenyl)zirconium   dichloride,   a   bridged   bulky  ligand<br>
metallocene was added to the reactor as an 8 weight percent toluene solution and<br>
the mixture was stirred for 60 min. at room temperature to form a pre-mixed catalyst solution. Silica dehydrated at 600°C available from Crosfield Limited, Warrington, England was then added slowly in one third increments to the pre-mixed solution in the reactor. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 20 minutes after which 24 grams of Kemamine AS-990 (which has the formula of (Ci8H37NCH2CH2OH)2 and is available from Witco Corp., Memphis, Tennessee) was added to the reactor as a 10 weight percent solution in toluene, and stirring continued for an additional 30 minutes at room temperature. The temperature was then raised to 68°C (155°F) and vacuum was applied in order to dry the polymerization catalyst. Drying was continued for about 6 hours at low agitation until the catalyst appeared to be free flowing. It was then discharged into a flask and stored under nitrogen atmosphere. The yield was 1050 grams due to some losses during the drying process. Analysis of the catalyst yielded: Zr = 0.32 weight percent, Al = 11.8 weight percent.<br>
Comparative Example 2 (CEX 2) Polymerization Process<br>
[0128]	A 2 liter autoclave reactor under a nitrogen purge was charged with<br>
0.16 mmoles of triethylaluminum (TEAL) as a scavenger of impurities followed by 25 cubic centimeters cubic centimeters of hexene-1 comonomer and 800 cubic centimeters of isobutane diluent. The content of the reactor was heated to 80°C after which 100 mgs of the silica supported catalyst prepared as described in Example 1 (Catalyst A) mixed in 10 cubic centimeters of hexane was added to the reactor. The catalyst hexane mixture was introduced concurrently with ethylene into the reactor to make up a total reactor pressure of 325 psig (2240 kPa). The reactor temperature was maintained at 85°C and the polymerization was allowed to proceed for 40 minutes. After 40 minutes the reactor was cooled, ethylene was vented off and the reactor opened. The reactor walls and stirrer blades were observed for polymer deposits and depending on the extent of fouling material the catalyst was given a rating from 0 to 6; 0 meaning no fouling material was observed on the reactor walls or stirrer blades, and 6 meaning that all polymer granules or particles were deposited onto the walls of the reactor or stirrer (that is, there was no free flowing polymer particles).<br>
Example 2<br>
[0129]	Example 2 was carried out in a manner similar to comparative<br>
example 2 (CEX 2) with the following exception: Prior to adding catalyst A to the reactor, 1 mg (1 weight percent based on the weight of the catalyst charged) of tetraoctadecyl ammonium bromide, an organic gelling agent was mixed with the 100 milligrams of catalyst A and the 10 cubic centimeters of hexane. The mixture was then introduced into the reactor concurrently with the ethylene and reaction proceeded as described in Comparative Example 2.<br>
[0130]	As shown in Table 1, the reactor fouled badly in the absence of the<br>
organogelator, while free flowing granules and no wall deposits were seen when the organogelator was present.<br>
Tablel<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Examples 3-6 and comparative examples 3-9<br>
[0131]	In another evaluation, several materials were investigated to<br>
determine whether they exhibited the characteristic of a gelling agent. The gelling agent characteristic was determined by dissolving 2 weight percent of each respective material in 50 ml of n-hexane at ambient or at 5°C increment up to 100°C with agitation. After dissolution, the mixture was allowed to stand at ambient (or cool to ambient) without agitation for 5 minutes and was immediately observed for gelation; that is, the various mixtures were visually inspected for the formation of a collo'dal dispersion having a viscoelastic liquid-like or solid-like characteristic.<br>
[0132]	After determining whether the various materials exhibited a gelling<br>
agent characteristic, the materials were then evaluated for their respective effects on reactor performance using the procedure described above for Example 2. In this evaluation, comparative example 2 was repeated and designated comparative<br>
example 3 (CEX 3)   The results of the gelling agent determination and the reactor performance evaluation are shown below in Table 2.<br>
[0133]	Table 2 indicates that some of the materials exhibited a gelling agent<br>
characteristic while others did not. Table 2 also indicates that some of the materials that did not exhibit a gelling agent characteristic (that is, "non-gelling materials"), nonetheless provided improved reactor fouling protection (see CEX 5 and 6) while other non-gelling materials did not provide substantially improved protection (see CEX 7-9). But finally, as we surprisingly discovered, Table 2 further indicates that all of the materials that exhibited a gelling agent characteristic, consistently provided substantially improved reactor fouling protection (that is, the fouling rating was less than 2.0). Thus, to consistently ensure substantially improved reactor protection against fouling or sheeting or both, at least one gelling agent should be used in combination, in contact or in a mixture with the polymerization catalyst system or any combination thereof. The gelling agent can be combined, contacted or mixed with the polymerization catalyst system prior to or after introduction in to the reactor but preferably the combining, contacting or mixing or any combination thereof occurs prior to introduction to the reactor.<br>
[0134]	While the present invention has been described and illustrated by<br>
reference to particular embodiments, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the invention lends itself to variations not necessarily illustrated herein. For example, it is contemplated that a gelling agent can be added to reactor in addition to being contacted with the catalyst system of the invention. For this reason, then, reference should be made solely to the appended claims for purposes of determining the true scope of the present invention.<br>
