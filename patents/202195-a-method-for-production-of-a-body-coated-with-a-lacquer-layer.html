				<td>The invention relates to a method for producing a vehicle body in accordance with the preamble of Claim 1, and to a vehicle body in accordance with the preamble of Claim 12.<br>
The manufacture of vehicle bodies comprises the sequence body shell -&gt; paintshop  assembly, a number of variants being possible depending on the manufacturing concept. A conventional variant is so-called CKD manufacture (Completely Knocked Down), in which the individual body-shell parts ( and other vehicle parts) are manufactured at one or more first sites and are joined together by welding and then painted at a further site. This method of manufacture is used in particular if the number of items produced does not justify manufacturing the entire body shell on site with presses. A modification of this form of manufacture is so-called SKD manufacture (Semi Knocked Down) , in which the body shell is produced and painted at a first production site, and is then more or less completed at a second production site by being combined with the further vehicle parts. CKD and SKD manufacture are carried out primarily in those countries where motor vehicles are not imported as a completed product, but rather are produced in that country, thus generating added value. CKD manufacture has a higher added value, but also has the drawback that the need to build a paintshop produces high costs which are offset by what is sometimes only a low number of vehicle bodies per annum. With SKD manufacture, the investments are considerably lower, owing to the lack of body-shell manufacture and of the paintshop, but on the other hand the added value during final assembly is relatively low.<br>
DE 29 23 874 A has disclosed a method for producing a vehicle body in which the vehicle floor is provided with fittings, such as for example the seats.<br><br>
ana is connected to frame "^parts of the body. Those sides of the body which face the vehicle interior to be formed are in this case already painted. Connecting the floor assembly to the frame parts which also form part of the floor of the motor vehicle is carried out by adhesive bonding and, at locations which are subjected to particularly high loads, can also be supplemented by screw connections. This type of floor manufacture offers two advantages. Firstly, it is possible to employ different materials, such as for example combinations of aluminium parts, plastic parts and/or steel parts, and secondly the internal fitting of the floor assembly is facilitated, owing to the cover still being absent. DE 38 09 456 C, which describes an extremely modular manufacturing method, is also based on the latter advantage. In this method, virtually the entire car is composed of individual modules, and the floor assembly, including the seats, is again constructed before the side parts of the body and the roof are added. Assembly is carried out here by providing screws all round.<br>
DE-A 34 13 228 and 37 34 208 are likewise based on the idea of facilitating the installation of the seats and of the instrument panel. However, in these documents the idea is simply to make the B-pillar of the vehicle body as a screw-in component, so that after the B-pillar is removed there is a wide access area available for fitting the instrument panel and the seats. The B-pillar is then screwed back on.<br>
A common feature of these known modular assembly methods for vehicle bodies is that ready-painted body parts are assembled to form the vehicle body. However, for this method of assembly the individual body parts must be designed accordingly. This means that the conventional body parts as used when welding a body together are not employed, but rather special screw-in and plug-in body parts are formed, which differ from the conventional body parts attached by welding only by a large number of screw<br><br>
holes and, in some cases, associated mating nuts. A further common feature of the above manufacturing methods is the conventional final assembly process, i.e. the individual body parts are painted and supplied to the assembly site in sequence using a just-in-time system. Since this type of body manufacture, when compared with welded bodies, requires independently developed and manufactured body parts, these methods of manufacturing vehicle bodies have to date been unable to gain acceptance in series production of motor vehicles.<br>
An object of the present invention is to carry out the manufacture of motor vehicles in such a manner that the final assembly of a motor vehicle is to be possible, on the one hand, with relatively low investment costs and, on the other hand, with a relatively high added value. A further object is a corresponding product.<br>
The description gives particularly preferred procedures and/or embodiments, which permit, on the one hand, efficient manufacture and an inexpensive product and, on the other hand, a highly stable manufacture of the body and, correspondingly, a highly stable product.<br>
According to the invention, the body is built from ready-painted body parts,<br>
which are connected to one another by non-thermal, undetachable joining techniques.<br>
Undetachable joining techniques are those which do not allow the join location to be<br>
detached without destroying it. Thermal joining processes are welding and soldering.<br>
The joining techniques according to the invention include adhesive bonding, riveting,<br>
in particular punch-riveting, direct screw connections, pressure-joining with or<br>
without a cutting operation, in particular joggling without cutting in. In a very<br>
particularly preferred manner, the body parts are	<br><br>
connected together by adhesive bonding and at least one further non-thermal, undetachable joining method, such as for example riveting, pressure-joining or screwing. That is to say the connecting locations of the body parts are adhesively bonded to one another and riveted, or are adhesively bonded and pressure-joined, or are adhesively bonded and screwed together, or a combination of these methods is used. According to the invention, the already shaped body parts have the layer of paint not only on their surfaces, but also on their outer cut edges, and preferably also on their inner cut edges. If holes are provided in the body part for the joining technique, for example for CONFIX joins or rivets, the edges of these holes may be coated or uncoated. As an alternative or in addition to the shaped body parts which are coated even on the at least outer edges, according to the invention the body is produced by attaching the coated and shaped body parts to a bottom section of the body, which bottom section was assembled from individual parts and then coated. The bottom section forms the floor assembly or the platform of the body, or parts thereof. As an alternative, or in addition, in the method according to the invention the shaped body parts are provided with the layer of paint in the shaped state and are then joined together.<br>
Unlike in the prior art, an advantage of the invention is that body parts are used which can also (in the unpainted state) be welded together to form a body, in series production using automatic welding machines (welding robots). This allows universal manufacture of the body, i.e., on the one hand - as is usual in series production of vehicle bodies " - by welding the shaped body parts together and, on the other hand - using the identically shaped body parts, if necessary provided with a few additional holes - by non-thermal, undetachable joining techniques, as have essentially been described above. In this way it is possible to use a press (the same press tools) both to<br><br>
produce body parts for large^atch production (welding) and for the small-batch production according to the invention. As a result, the manufacturing costs for the body parts for non-thermal joining can be kept low.<br>
As a contrast to the prior art, the manufacture according to the invention comprises at least one of the following five steps:<br>
1.	During joining, a connecting means forms its own path through at least one of the body parts which have been placed together.<br>
2.	After placing the body parts together, a joggle is created from one body part through the other body part.<br>
3.	After placing the body parts together, a hole is formed in at least one of the body parts, into which hole is introduced a connecting element which connects the body parts to one another.<br>
4.	Manufacturing a plurality of body parts of the same type which already have the layer of paint, collecting these body parts in a transport rack, transporting the transport rack together with the collected body parts to a body assembly site, removing the collected body parts from the transport rack and assembling the removed body parts together with further body parts, which have been collected and transported in the same way.<br>
5.	Shaping of the body parts on a press using tools,, the same tools additionally being used to produce body parts which are welded together with further shaped body parts.<br>
The first step includes, in particular, the joining techniques of punch-riveting and direct screw .connections, for example thin sheet-metal direct screw connections. The connecting means are placed against the body part {metal sheet), which is either unbroken or provided with an opening which is too small, and cut or bore into this body part. The second step comprises, for example, joggling with and without cutting in. In this process,  a metal  sheet  is deformed into the<br><br>
neighbouring metal sheet whiciKbears against it and the metal sheets become locked together. A third step involves in particular blind-riveting, and if appropriate also self-tapping sheet-metal screw connections. According to the invention, these three steps may all be used on a single body, depending on the accessibility of the body parts which are to be connected to one another. As already mentioned, these joining operations are very particularly advantageously combined with adhesive bonding. Compared to the prior art, the manufacture according to the invention has the advantage that the body parts to be fastened together can first be aligned before carrying out final fastening {for example punch-riveting). This results in a very good shape accuracy of the motor vehicle, which is reflected, inter alia, in the gap dimensions of the motor vehicle, but also in the rigidity of the body and, as a result, in low production of noise (creaking, squeaking) . This is impossible with the screw connections in accordance with the prior art, since in this case the predeterroined screw holes define the subsequent dimensions of the vehicle body with the result that considerably higher tolerances result. This can only be compensated for in the prior art by means of relatively large screw holes which, however, lead to instability of the overall body. This is one reason why an extremely modular manufacturing method, as is known from DE 38 09 456 C, has not been able to gain acceptance in series production.<br>
The fourth and/or fifth step according to the invention can be combined with steps 1 to 3 and respectively comprise(s) an advantageous guidance (transportation) of material and a mixed manufacturing Tiethod. This material guidance makes it possible to nanufacture the body parts up to and including painting at one production site and to carry out assembly at a production site situated well away from the first site (in particular in a different country). By contrast, •.he prior art describes the manufacture of bodies<br><br>
uajcmg place at one site, so that the parts are no longer collected after painting, but rather are supplied individually to the assembly line (for example via hanging conveyers). According to the invention, identical body parts, which if desired may differ from one another in the colour of the layer of paint, are collected in a transport rack. The transport rack may be designed simultaneously as a container, or advantageously is put into a container for trans¬portation purposes. This is carried out in particular for all body parts, i.e., for example, the right and left side parts, the roof and the roof crossrails. It is possible to use a similar procedure for the body parts which are detachably connected, such as the doors, bonnets and wings. If different colours are used, the different body parts are advantageously put into the respective transport racks in the same colour sequence, so that when the body is assembled at the assembly site the body parts can be removed individually from the large number of transport racks for the different body parts, in the correct colour. Preferably, 5 to 50, in particular 10 to 25, of the painted body parts are placed in one transport rack.<br>
Mixed manufacture is a particular advantage of the present invention. This allows identical parts to be pressed at one location on the same equipment (e.g. using the same tools, such as male and female die parts), these identical parts then either being combined to form motor vehicle bodies (in particular on site, i.e. at the same manufacturing premises) by welding the parts together and then painting the body, or being assembled to form a body (advantageously at different" manufacturing premises, in particular in a different country) by non-thermal joining only after painting (which is advantageously carried out at the first manufacturing premises).<br>
The manufacturing method according to the invention allows decentralized assembly of the body, possibly assembly which is so decentralized as to take<br><br>
Y<br>
pxace m different countries, at relatively low investment cost and on the basis of centralized manufacture of the body parts. The individual painted body parts are transported in a transport rack which separates the individual parts, so that the individual parts cannot scratch one another"s surface. This, too, represents a difference between the method according to the invention and previous CKD methods, in which the individual body panels are usually transported resting against one another (in the unpainted state).<br>
By combining the joining technique of adhesive bonding with a mechanical joining technique, a particularly rigid body is obtained. Possible mechanical joining techniques also include inserting screws into the connection location, it being possible in particular to use self-tapping sheet-metal screws and here, in particular, those which are self-boring, i.e. those which form their own hole in the unbroken metal sheet (direct screw connections). It is preferred here to use those self-tapping sheet-metal screws which form an indentation (collar) protruding from the metal sheet, into which indentation they then cut a thread. Punch-riveting is also a particularly preferred joining technique in combination with adhesive bonding, since here too the rivet forms its own rivet hole in the unbroken metal sheet.<br>
According to the invention, it is possible to use, for the production of the body parts, metal sheets which have been precoated in the coil-coating process, in which case the precoating may also contain all the required layers of paint. Such metal sheets are then recoated at their cut edges either after being stamped out or.., in particular after the forming operation)" and are only then joined together. This means that according to the invention in this case the body parts are coated individually in order to treat the cut edges, rather than the whole body being coated.<br>
However,  according to  the  invention  it  is preferred for the individual parts first to be stamoed<br><br>
out of a sheet-metal strip and then formed and painted. Here too, it is essential that the individual body parts are coated, and not exclusively the entire body.<br>
If the joining techniques used result in open metal surfaces, for example joining techniques which cut in, the joining locations are provided with a corrosion inhibitor (recoated), preferably immediately after their production. As a result, the full corrosion protection is maintained. Advantageously, the corrosion protection is achieved by combined joining using an adhesive, which seals the open metal surfaces.<br>
Preferably, not all the sheet-metal parts of the body are assembled by non-thermal joining, but rather a mixed construction is implemented. This means that some individual parts of the body are joined together by welding to form a body part, for example a body subunit, which is then painted. A suitable body subunit of this kind is in particular the bottom section of the vehicle body. In this case, the bottom section may advantageously also be coated in a standard colour, irrespective of the colour of the outer shell of the motor vehicle. This is possible because the bottom section is covered, during further assembly of the motor vehicle, by various parts such as carpeted floors, instrument panel, etc.<br>
In the present invention, the painted components comprising the bottom section, the side parts, the roof and the roof crossrails are preferably assembled by punch-riveting (or by riveting, joggling or screwing) and adhesive bonding to form a joined body shell which, after adding the painted attachment parts (wings, doors, front and back flaps), is a finished (assemiDled)/-body. This CPKD manufacture (Completely Painted Knocked Down) is similar to CKD manufacture, but does not entail the high investment which is required for CKD manufacture resulting from the construction of a complete body shell manufacturing plant and paintshop, which are cost-intensive but not labour-intensive. In CPKD manufacture, the components<br><br>
are preferably placed together, held in position and joined manually, it being possible to use relatively simple joining techniques. By means of CPKD, it is also possible to change model quickly and it is possible quickly to set up manufacture, in particular for a low number of units per annum {up to 20,000, advantageously up to 12,000, and in particular up to 8,000) .<br>
A preferred sequence of CPKD manufacture is as follows:<br>
manufacture individual sheet-metal parts, possibly<br>
from coil-coated metal sheets;<br>
manufacture the bottom section, side parts, roof<br>
and roof crossrails components;<br>
paint the bottom section and, if appropriate, the<br>
roof crossrails black, paint the shell parts in<br>
the appropriate colour;<br>
package  the  parts  and  send  them  to  the<br>
manufacturing site;<br>
join the painted body parts together by adhesive<br>
bonding and a further joining technique;<br>
repainting work, fine sealing;<br>
add the painted attachment parts (wings, doors,<br>
front and rear flaps) to the shell; and<br>
final assembly to produce the completed motor<br>
vehicle.<br>
Here the difference from the prior art again becomes apparent, since in this prior art the final assembly to produce the completed motor vehicle, i.e. the complete installation of the internal fittings, such as carpeted floors, seats and instrument panel, and also of the roof liner, is carried out before joining together the painted body parts. According to the invention, at most partial fitting, in particular of only a small part, of the internal equipment is carried out, such as for example that of the carpeted floor.<br>
In order to increase manufacturing levels at the manufacturing site, a small body shell can be built<br><br>
there for producing the bottom section, and also (or as an alternative) a simple painting installation. In that case, the entire assembly operation, except for painting the outer shell, is then carried out at the production site.<br>
The invention is described in more detail below with reference to an exemplary embodiment and drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows various joining methods;<br>
Figure 2 shows the overall sequence of the manufacture of the motor vehicle;<br>
Figure 3 shows a detailed illustration of the body structure; and<br>
Figure 4 shows a detailed illustration of the finishing work on the body.<br>
For the present invention, adhesive bonding 1 is the most important method amongst the selection of joining techniques illustrated in Figure 1. In adhesive bonding, a layer of adhesive 2 is used to produce an undetachable connection between two body parts 3 and 4. Suitable adhesives are adhesives which are conventionally used for vehicle bodies, in particular those which are based on polyurethane, epoxy or (meth) acrylate. The join can only be detached again by destroying the layer of adhesive. Adhesive bonding 1 is preferably used in more than 40% of contact surfaces between the individual body parts, and in particular in more than 70% of the contact surfaces.<br>
Punch-riveting 5 represents a further important joining technique in the present invention. In this process, the body parts 13 and 14 are connected by a rivet 9 which cuts its own punched hole 7 (no preperforated metal sheet 14). Punch-riveting 5 can be employed without the use of an adhesive bond 1, but preferably punch-riveting 5 is carried out on an adhesive bond 1, with the result that, firstly, the adhesive-bonded body parts 3 and 4 are fixed immediately and, secondly, the layer of adhesive 2 is<br><br>
stabilized, so that maximum strengths are achieved. As a result, the finished body is particularly rigid.<br>
If joggling is used, there is no need for an element (such as for example rivet 6 or adhesive 2) which connects the two body parts. It is necessary to differentiate here between joggling with cutting in 8 and joggling without cutting in 9. Like punch-riveting, joggling can be used without, but preferably together with, a layer of adhesive, the joggling, like the punch-riveting, then being employed on the adhesive bond.<br>
In the case of thin sheet-metal direct screw connection 10, a screw ll is bored through at least one of the metal sheets, in this case the lower metal sheet 13, the screw 11 forming a collar 12 in the metal sheet 13. The collar 12 extends over a number of turns of the screw, so that the screw is held securely. With this kind of screw connection, it is advantageous for a hole 15 to have already been formed in the upper metal sheet 14 before the screw connection takes place, so that the screw 11 only cuts through the lower metal sheet 13. Owing to the high strength requirements placed on a vehicle body, this type of screw connection is generally a once-only screw connection, i.e. after this screw connection is released screwing the screw back in no longer achieves the same strength as with the first screw connection, so that it is necessary to use additional screw connections (or other joining techniques).<br>
A further joining technique which can be used is blind-riveting 16. In this case, after the metal sheets 13 and 14 have been joined together a hole 17 is Dwied through both of them, and a blind rivet 18 is inserted into this hole. By pulling the widening pin 19 :hrough the blind rivet 18, the lower end of the blind rivet 18 is widened, thus ensuring the metal sheets 13 md 14 are held together securely. With the thin sheet-letal screw connection 10 and the blind rivet 16, too.<br><br>
it  is preferred for the metal sheets  13  and 14 simultaneously to be adhesively bonded together.<br>
The layer of adhesive has the advantage that it forms a protection against corrosion on the body parts in the region of the join 5, 8 or 9. Preferably, however, a further corrosion inhibitor is applied to the finished join 5, 8 or 9 after the joining operation.<br>
The complete manufacturing sequence, as illustrated in Figure 2, is as follows: (A) a plurality of shaped sheet-metal parts 21 (and optionally also profile parts) are welded together to form a bottom section I 22 (B). This bottom section I 22 is welded to further shaped sheet-metal parts 23 to form a bottom section II 24. The bottom section II 24 is then painted 25 (C) , dip painting being particularly suitable here. It is particularly advantageous here to perform a multi-layer painting, for example firstly phosphatization, then a cataphoretic dip painting, and then a coloured painting, the underside of the bottom section II 25 preferably being further treated with a bottom-section protection agent. There are no special visual requirements placed on the colour of the bottom section II 24, since the bottom section II 24 is preferably selected in such a way that it has no visible surfaces, or only a few visible surfaces, that is to say surfaces which are visible from the outside during subsequent use of the motor vehicle.<br>
Then, (D), shaped and painted side parts 26 are placed on the painted bottom section II 25 and are connected thereto by adhesive bonding and punch-riveting. To stabilize the side parts, they are stabilize J at the Lop ^jy d tront painted roof cross-member 27 and rear painted roof cross-member 28, likewise by adhesive bonding and punch-riveting. Then the roof 3 9 is placed on the shell 29 (E) formed in this way, and is in turn connected to the side part 26 and the roof cross-members 27, 28 by adhesive bonding<br><br>
and punch-riveting. Construction of the shell 30 is then complete.<br>
In a finishing operation (F), attachment parts, such as for example front wings 31, are mounted on the shell  30.  In  this  and/or  the  preceding  steps, repainting work and fine sealing also take place. In a subsequent step (G) , completion work 32 takes place, i.e. engine, transmission, wheels, internal equipment (carpeted floors,  seats,  instrument panel,  steering wheel) etc. are installed in the body. This step is followed by a final manufacturing step (H) , in which door and flap modules are attached in order to form a finished motor vehicle 33. After inspection 34, the motor vehicle 33 is ready for sale.<br>
A number of variants of and deviations from the manufacturing sequence illustrated are possible. For example, the metal sheets 21, 23, and in particular also 26, 39, may already have been painted by coil coating, in which case in particular the metal sheets 26 and 39 are retreated, i.e. protected against corrosion, at their cut edges before being joined together. Furthermore, the doors and flaps may also be attached during the assembly step (G).<br>
Figure 3 depicts the parts which are joined together in steps D and E to construct the shell 30, in detail. The side parts 26 are placed and fixed on" the bottom section II 25, which is painted black,  for example, with the interposition of a layer of adhesive. The adhesive bonding between the parts 25 and 26 is then stabilized by punch-joining or pressure-joining or by  means  of  self-tapping  sheet-metal  screws,  a combination of these joining techniques also being -possibler-in particular depending on the accessibility of the areas which are to be connected together. Then, the roof cross-members 27 and 28 are placed on the side parts 26 and likewise fixedly connected by adhesive bonding and further joining techniques such as punch-riveting. The roof 39 is then placed on the part shell 29 finished in this way and is in turn connected to the<br><br>
siae parts 26 and roof cross-members 27 and 28 by adhesive bonding and at least one further joining technique, for example punch-riveting. Using the ready-painted bottom section II 25 and the prepainted side parts and roof parts 26 to 28, 39 makes it possible here to dispense with the usual painting process, i.e. by this stage the body already has its essential protection against corrosion, and advantageously there only remains retreatment of the mechanical joining connections and repainting work and fine sealing. To do this, there is no longer any need to treat the entire body, in particular if the sheet-metal parts are already fully protected against corrosion even at their cut edges. This also differentiates the present invention from the previous use of coil-coated parts in the motor vehicle sector. However, if desired it is possible to carry out single complete or partial painting treatment, such as for example the application of a clearcoat.<br>
Figure 4 provides a detailed illustration of the manufacturing steps F and H. The adhesion and mechanical joining locations 40 are emphasized on the finished shell 30 (on only one side). Attaching the flaps 41, 42 and the doors 43 produces the complete body. Using the prefabricated bottom section II 25 makes it possible to build the complete shell 30 using relatively simple manufacturing steps, in particular steps which can be carried out manually. As a result, a body can be manufactured on site with relatively low investment costs; in particular there is no need for an expensive, automated body shell construction or for any expensive, likewise largely automated paintshop for treating, t-he finished shell.-"""The various individual parts, such as bottom section II 24, side parts 26, roof 39, bonnet 41, flaps 42, doors 43 and wings 31 can be painted centrally and then assembled into finished bodies or vehicles at a number of different sites.<br>
The invention is suitable in particular for building motor vehicles at sites at which a relatively<br><br>
low number of vehicles per annum are to be built as con^letely as possible, i.e. not by a semi knocked down method, and with relatively low investment costs.<br><br><br>

1.	A method for the production of a body coated with a lacquer layer which has<br>
at least one of the properties of being colouring, corrosion-protecting and finally or<br>
nonelectrically weldable, having the steps:<br>
production of shaped body parts already having the lacquer layer and assembly of the body parts al ready having the lacquer layer by non-thermal un-releasable joining to the body coated with the lacquer layer, the shaped body parts having the lacquer layer also at their outer cutting edges, characterized In that the body parts are shaped on a press by means of dies, the same dies additionally, producing body parts which, unlacquered, are welded together with further differently shaped unlacquered body parts.<br>
2.	The method according to Claim 1, wherein the shaped body parts are attached to a substructure which is assembled from individual parts and which has been coated after assembly.<br>
3.	The method according to Claim 1 or 2, wherein the lacquer layer is applied to the body part after shaping and before joining.<br>
4.	The method according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, wherein, during joining, a connection means itself shapes its path through at least one of the body parts placed against one another.<br><br>
5.	The method according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, wherein, after the body parts have been placed against one another, a passage from one body part through the other body part is afforded.<br>
6.	The method according to any one of Claims 1 to 5, wherein, after the body parts have been placed against one another, a hole, into which a connection element connecting the body parts to one another is introduced, is formed in at least one of the body parts.<br>
7.	The method according to Claim 1, wherein adhesive bonding in conjunction with a joining technique is used for the non-thermal unreleasable joining.<br>
8.	The method according to Claim 7, wherein the joining technique used is riveting and/or compression-joining.<br>
9.	The method according to Claim 8, wherein the compression-joining is carried out with or with out a cutting content, in particular as passage-joining without cutting-in.<br><br>
10.	The method according to Claim 8, wherein punch-riveting is carried out during joining.<br>
11.	The method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the lacquer layer is applied by the coil-coating method.<br><br>
12.	The method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein panel regions deformed during joining are recoated.<br>
13.	The method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein body parts, before being provided with the lacquer layer, are welded together from individual parts to form body subunits.<br>
14.	The method according to Claim 13, wherein the substructure of the body is produced by the welding of individual substructure individual parts not having the lacquer layer and is subsequently provided with the lacquer layer before the joining of the body parts having the lacquer layer.<br>
15.	The method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the substructure is provided with a lacquer layer other than that of other body parts.<br>
16.	The method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the substructure, the side parts, the roof or the roof cross member of the body are used as a body part.<br>
17.	The method for the co-manufacture of a shaped body or body subunit provided with a lacquer layer, having the steps:<br><br>
-	shaping of a series of identically shaped body parts;<br>
-	extraction of a part-quantity of the series, welding of these body parts to other<br><br>
shaped body parts to form a body or body subunit, and lacquering of this body or body subunit; - extraction of a part-quantity of the series and lacquering of these body parts to form the shaped body part provided with the lacquer layer, before joining together to form body or body subunit.<br>
18. The method according to Claim 1 or 17, wherein a plurality of identical body parts already having the lacquer layer are collected in a transport rack, the transport rack, together with the collected body parts, is transported to a body assembly location, the collected body parts are extracted from the transport rack, and the extracted body parts are assembled together with body parts which have likewise been collected and transported.</td>
