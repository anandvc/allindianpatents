				<td>1-[(IND0L-3-YL)CARB0NYL]PIPERAZINE DERIVATIVES<br>
The present invention relates to 1-[(indol-3-yl)carbonyl]piperazine derivatives, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising the same and to the use of these 1-[(indol-3-yl)carbonyl]pipera2ine derivatives as cannabin agonists in the treatment of pain and other disorders.<br>
1-[(lndol-3-yl)carbonyl]piperazine derivatives are known as compounds endowed with interesting pharmacological properties. 1-[(indol-3-yl)carbonyl]piperazine derivatives with unsubstantiated in dole nitrogen atom are disclosed in WO9806715 (SmithKlineBeecham Corp.) as anti-inflammatory agents. Related 1-[(indol-3-yl)carbonyl]piperazine derivatives which may also be substituted at the indole nitrogen atom are disclosed in VVOOI43746 (Nippon Shinyaku Co.) as compounds having anti-inflammatory and nephrotropic activities.<br>
1-[(1-Benzyl-indol-3-yl)carbonyl]piperazine derivatives were disclosed in a study on H1-receptor antagonists (Battaglia, S. et al. Eur. J. Med. Chem. 34. 93-105, 1999) and in a study on anti-inflammatory agents (Duflos, M. et al. Eur. J. Med. Chem. 36, 545-553, 2001), and found to be of relatively low activity in both studies. Recently 1-[(indol-3-yl)carbonyl]piperazine derivatives were generically described in wool58869 (Bristol-Myers Squibb) as being active modulators of the cannabinoid receptor and as such useful in the treatment of respiratory diseases. No specific 1-[(indol-3-yl)carbonyl]piperazine derivatives were disclosed in this patent application-.<br>
Pain treatment is often limited by the side effects of currently available medication. For moderate to severe pain, copious are widely used. These agents are cheap and effective but suffer from serious and potentially life-threatening side-effects, most notably respiratory depression and muscle rigidity. In addition, the doses of opioids which can be administered are limited by nausea, emesis, constipation, pruritis and urinary retention, often resulting in patients electing to receive sub-optimal pain control rather than suffer these distressing side effects. Furthermore, these side-effects often result in patients requiring extended hospitalization. Uploads are highly addictive and are scheduled drugs in many territories. There is therefore a demand for new analgesics that have an improved side effect profile compared to currently used products, at equi-analgesic doses.<br>
Evidence is accumulating that cannabinoid agonists have potential as analgesic and inflammatory  agents.   Two types   of cannabinoid   receptors  are  implicated,   the<br><br>
cannabinoid CB1 receptor, which is located primarily in the central nervous system but which is also expressed by peripheral neuronâ€™s and to a lower extent in other peripheral tissues, and the cannabinoid CB2 receptor, which is mostly located in immune cells (Howlett, A.C. et al.: International Union of Pharmacology. XXVII. Classification of Cannabinoid Receptors Pharmacia. Rev. 54. 161-202, 2002). While the CB2 receptor has been implicated in modulating the immune and anti-inflammatory response of cannabinoids, cannabinoid receptor agonists, especially those acting at the CB1 receptor have recently been suggested as useful in the treatment of pain (Iversen, L. and Chapman, V.: Cannabinoids: a real prospect for pain relief? Current Opinion in Pharmacology, 2, 50-55, 2002 and references therein). Cannabinoid receptor agonists, such as CP 55,940 and WIN 55,212-2, produce potent antinociception with equivalent efficacy to morphine in animal models of acute pain, persistent inflammatory pain and neuropathic pain. The known cannabinoid agonists are in general highly lipophilic and insoluble in water. There is a thus a need for cannabinoid agonists with improved properties for use as therapeutic agents.<br>
To this end the present invention provides 1-[(indol-3-yl)carbonyl]pipera2ine derivatives having the general formula 1<br><br>
wherein<br>
R represents 1-4 substations independently selected from H, (Ci.4)alkyl (optionally<br>
substituted with halogen), (C1.4)alkyloxy (optionally substituted with halogen),<br>
halogen, OH, NH2, CN and NO2;<br>
R1 is (C5-8)cycloalkyl or (C5.8)cycloalkenyl;<br>
R2 is H, methyl or ethyl;<br>
R3, R3". R4" R4", R5, R5 and R6"are independently hydrogen or (C1.4)alky!, optionally<br>
substituted with (C1-4)alkyloxy, halogen or OH;<br>
R6 is hydrogen or (C1.4)alkyl, optionally substituted with (C1-4)alkyloxy, halogen or OH;<br><br>
R6 forms together with R7 a 4-7 membered saturated heterocyclic ring, optionally<br>
containing a further heteroatom selected from O and S;<br>
R7 forms together with R6 a 4-7 membered saturated heterocyclic ring, optionally<br>
containing a further heteroatom selected from 0 and S; or<br>
R7 is H, (C1.4)alkyl or (C3.5)cycloaikyl, the aikyi groups being optionally substituted<br>
with OH, halogen or (C1.4)alkyloxy; or<br>
a  pharmaceuticaily  acceptable  salt thereof,  as  agonists  of the cannabin   1<br>
receptor, which can therefore be used in the treatment of pain such as for example<br>
peri-operative pain,  chronic pain,  neuropathic  pain,  cancer pain and  pain  and<br>
plasticity associated with multiple sclerosis.<br>
The compounds of the invention are generically described in WO0158869 (supra) as cannabin receptor modulators for treating respiratory disease. These modulators are preferentially identified therein as CB2 modulators. The majority of compounds which are disclosed in WO0158869 are characterized by the presence of a 2-(4-morpholinyl)ethyl side chain at the 1-position of an indole or indazole core structure. The 1-[(indoi-3-yl)carbonyl]piperazine derivatives of the invention are distinguished from those of WO0158869 by having a cyclopentylmethyl- or a cyclohexylmethyl side chain at the corresponding position, a feature which, unlike a 2-(4-morpholinyl)ethyl side chain or a benzyl side chain, provides compounds having CB1 agonist activity.<br>
The term (Ci-4)alkyl as used in the definition of formula I means a branched or<br>
unbranched alky! group having 1-4 carbon atoms, like butyl, isobutyl, tertiary butyl,<br>
propyl, isopropyl, ethyl and methyl.<br>
In the term (C1-4)alkyloxy, (Ci.4)alkyl has the meaning as defined above.<br>
The term (C5-8)cycloaIkyl means a saturated cyclic alkyl group having 5-8 carbon<br>
atoms, and can thus represent cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl or cyclooctyl.<br>
Preferred (C5-8)cycloalkyl groups are cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl.<br>
The term (Cs.8)cycloalkenyl means a cyclic alkenyl group having 5-8 carbon atoms<br>
and at least one double bond, like cyclopent-3-enyl or cyclohex-3-enyl.<br>
The term halogen means F, CI, Br or I.<br>
In the definition of formula I R6 can form together with R7 a 4-7 membered saturated<br>
heterocyclic ring, which means that R6 together with the carbon atom to which it is<br>
bound and R7 together with the nitrogen atom to which it is bound complete a 4-7<br>
membered saturated ring, such as an azetidine, a pyrrolidine, a piperidine, or a 1H-<br>
azepine ring. Such rings may contain an additional O or S-heteroatom to form rinas<br><br>
such as a morpholine, a piperazine, a homopiperazine, an imidazolidine or a tetrahydrothiazole ring.<br>
There is a preference for 1-[(indol-3-yl)carbonyl]piperazine derivatives of formula 1<br>
wherein R2 is H and R1 is a cyclopentyl or a cyclohexyl group.<br>
More preferred are the connpounds of formula I wherein in addition R represents<br>
(Ci.4)aIkyloxy or halogen, while even more preferred are the 1-[(indol-3-yl)carbonyl]-<br>
piperazine derivatives of the invention wherein R represents a methoxy group at the<br>
7-position of the indole ring.<br>
Especially preferred are the 1-[(indol-3-yl)carbonyl]piperazine derivatives of formula I<br>
wherein R3, R3", R4, R5, R5" and R5" are H; R4, R6 and R7 are independently H or<br>
(Ci-4)alkyl; or Rs forms together with R7 a 5- or 6-membered saturated heterocyclic<br>
ring and R4 is H or (C1.4)alkyl.<br>
Particular preferred CB-1 receptor agonists of the invention are:<br>
1-{[1-(cyclohexylmethyl)-7-methoxy-1H-indol-3-yl]carbonyl}-3,5-dimethyl-4-<br>
ethylpiperazine;<br>
1 -{[1 -(cyclohexylmethyl)-7-methoxy-1 H-indoI-3-yl]carbonyl}-3,4,5-trimethylpiperazine;<br>
(S)-1-{[1-(cyciohexylmethyl)-7-methoxy-1H-indol-3-yl]carbonyl}-3,4-dimethyl-<br>
piperazine;<br>
(S)-2-{[1-(cyclohexyImethyl)-7-methoxy-1H-indol-3-yl]carbonyl}-octahydro-2H-pyrido-<br>
2H-pyrido[1,2-a]pyrazine;<br>
(S)-2-{[1-(cyclohexylmethyl)-7-methoxy-1H-indol-3-yl]carbonyl}-octahydro-2H-pyrrolo-<br>
[1,2-a]pyrazine; and<br>
(S)-2-{[1-(cyclopentylmethyI)-7-methoxy-1H-lndoI-3-yl]carbonyl}-octahydro-2/-/-pyrido-<br>
[1,2-a]pyrazine; or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.<br>
The 1-[(indol-3-yl)carbonyl]piperazine derivatives of the invention may be prepared by methods known in the art of organic chemistry in general. More specifically such compounds can be prepared using procedures outlined by C. J. Swain et al (J. Med. Chem. 34. 140-151, 1991) and by P. E. Peterson, J. P. Wolf ill and C. Niemann (J. Org. Chem. 23, 303-304, 1958) or by modification of these procedures.<br><br><br>
1-[(lndol-3-yl)carbonyl]piperazines of Formula I can for instance be prepared from the condensation of a compound of Formula II, wherein R1, R2 and R have the meaning as previously defined and C(0)X represents a carboxylic acid or an activated derivative thereof, such as a carboxylic acid halide, preferably a chloride or a bromide, with a compound of Formula III where R3 - R7 have the meaning as previously defined. When C(0)X represents a carboxylic acid (i.e., X is hydroxy) the condensation reaction can be effected with the aid of a coupling reagent, such as for example carbonyl diimidazole, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and the like, in a solvent such as dimethylformamide or dichloromethane.<br>
When C(0)X represents a carboxylic acid halide (i.e., X is halide) the condensation with the amine derivative III can be carried out in the presence of a base, for example triethyiamine, in a solvent such as dichloromethane.<br>
Compounds of formula III can be obtained from commercial sources, prepared by literature procedures or modifications of literature procedures known to those persons skilled in the art. For example, compounds of formula HI can be prepared by reduction of a diketopiperazine, using a reducing agent such as lithium aluminum hydride or borane-tetrahydrofuran complex as described by M. E. Jung and J. C. Rohloff (J. Org. Chem. 50, 4909-4913, 1985). Diketopiperazines can be prepared by a variety of routes, as described by C. J. Dinsmore and D. C. Bershore [Tetrahedron 58, 3297-3312, 2002).<br>
Compounds of formula II can be prepared by reaction of a compound of formula IV, where R has the meaning as previously defined, and a compound of formula V, where R1 and R2 have the meanings as previously defined and Y is a leaving group, for example a halide or an alkyl sulfonate, in the presence of a base such as sodium hydride. The carboxylic acid can be converted to a carboxylic acid halide, if desired, for example a carboxylic acid chloride, using a reagent such as oxalis chloride.<br><br><br>
Compounds of formula V can be obtained from commercial sources, prepared by literature procedures or modifications of literature procedures known to those persons skilled in the art.<br>
For example, compounds of formula V where Y is para-toluenesulfonate can be prepared from compounds of formula V where Y is hydroxyl, using a method described by B. Took et al {J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans, 1, 80-1-804, 1993). Compounds of formula V where Y is hydroxyl and R2 is hydrogen can be prepared by reduction of a carboxylic acid or carboxylic ester, using a reducing agent such as borane-tetrahydrofuran complex or lithium aluminum hydride.<br>
Compounds of formula IV can be accessed from compounds of formula VI by acylation at the 3-position, using an acylating reagent. For example, compounds of formula IV can be accessed from compounds of formula VI by treatment with trifluoroacetic anhydride in a solvent such as dimethylformamide, followed by hydrolysis in aqueous sodium hydroxide at an elevated temperature.<br><br>
Compounds of formula VI can be obtained from commercial sources, prepared by literature procedures or modifications of literature procedures known to those persons skilled in the art.<br>
Compounds of formula II can alternatively be prepared by acylation of a compound of formula VII, using an acylating reagent. For example, compounds of funnel II where X is chloride can be prepared by reaction of a compound of formula VII with orally chloride in a solvent such as 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane followed by rearrangement at elevated temperature.<br><br>
Compounds of formula VII can be prepared by reaction of a compound of formula VI with a compound of formula V in the presence of a base such a sodium hydride.<br>
The skilled person will likewise appreciate that various 1-[(indol-3-yl)carbonyl]-" piperazine derivatives of Formula 1 can be obtained by appropriate conversion reactions of functional groups corresponding to certain of the substations R and Ri-R7. For example, compounds of formula I wherein R7 is (C1.4)alkyl or (C3.5)cycioalkyI, . the alkyl groups of which may be substituted with OH, halogen or (C1-4)alkalify, can be prepared by the reaction of a compound of formula I wherein R7 is hydrogen with a (C1.4)alkyl halide or a functionalized (C1-4)alkyl halide, in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate.<br>
Compounds of formula I wherein R is (Ci.4)alkalify or functionalized (Ci.4)alkyl may be prepared by the reaction of a compound of formula I wherein R is hydroxy with a (C1-4)alkyl halide or a functionalized (C1.4)alkyl halide, in the presence of a base such as sodium hydride.<br>
Compounds of formula I wherein R is NH2 may be prepared by the reaction of a compound of formula I wherein R is nitro with a reducing agent such as hydrogen / palladium on activated carbon.<br>
The 1-[(indol-3-yl)carbonyl]piperazine derivatives of Formula I and their salts may contain at least one centre of chiraiity, and exist therefore as stereoisomer, including enantiomers and diastereomers. The present invention includes the aforementioned stereoisomers within its scope and each of the individual R and S enantiomers of the compounds of formula 1 and their salts, substantially free, i.e. associated with less than 5%, preferably less than 2%, in particular less than 1 % of the other enantiomer, and mixtures of such enantiomers in any proportions including the raceme mixtures containing substantially equal amounts of the two enantiomers. Methods for asymmetric synthesis whereby the pure stereo isomers are obtained are well known in the art, e.g. synthesis with chital induction or starting from choral intermediates, enantiosetective enzymatic conversions, separation of stereoisomer or enantiomers using chromatography on chiral media. Such methods are for example described in Chiralityâ€™s in Industry (edited by A.N. Collins, G.N. Sheldrake and J. Crosby, 1992; John Wiley).<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be obtained by treating a free base of a<br>
compound of formula 1 with a mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid, hydrotropic  of an organic acid such as for example<br><br>
ascorbic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, lactic acid, malefic acid, melodic acid, numeric acid, glycolic acid, succinct acid, prop ionic acid, acetic acid, methane sulfuric acid, and the like.<br>
The compounds of the invention may exist in unsolvated as well as in solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol and the like, in general, the solvated forms are considered equivalent to the unsolvated forms for the purpose of the invention.<br>
The present invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a 1-[(indol-3-yl)carbonyl]piperazine derivative having the general formula I, or a pharmaceuticaily acceptable salt thereof, in admixture with pharmaceuticaily acceptable auxiliaries, and optionally other therapeutic agents. The term "acceptable" means being compatible with the other ingredients of the composition and not deleterious to the recipients thereof. Compositions include e.g. those suitable for oral, sublingual, subcutaneous, intravenous, epidural, intrathecal, intramuscular, transferal, pulmonary, local, or rectal administration, and the like, all in unit dosage forms for administration.<br>
For oral administration, the active ingredient may be presented as discrete units, such as tablets, capsules, powders, granulates, solutions, suspensions, and the like. For potential administration, the pharmaceutical composition of the invention may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, e.g. injection liquids in predetermined amounts, for example in sealed vials and ampoules, and may also be stored In a freeze dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of sterile liquid carrier, e.g. water, prior to use.<br>
Mixed with such pharmaceuticaily acceptable auxiliaries, e.g. as described in the standard reference, Gennaro, A.R. et al., Remington: The Science and Practice of Pliarmacy (20th Edition., Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, 2000, see especially Part 5: Pharmaceutical Manufacturing), the active agent may be compressed into solid dosage units, such as pills, tablets, or be processed into capsules, suppositories or patches. By means of pharmaceuticaily acceptable liquids the active agent can be applied as a fluid composition, e.g. as an injection preparation, in the form of a solution, suspension, emulsion, or as a spray, e.g. a nasal spray. For making solid dosage units, the use of conventional additives such as fillers, colorants, polymeric binders and the like is contemplated. In general any pharmaÂ¬ceuticaily acceptable additive which does not interfere with the function of the active compounds can be used. suitable carnets with  which the active agent of the<br><br>
invention can be administered as solid compositions include lactose, starch, celluÂ¬lose derivatives and the like, or mixtures thereof, used in suitable amounts. For parÂ¬enteral administration, aqueous suspensions, isotonic saline solutions and sterile injectable solutions may be used, containing pharmaceutically acceptable dispersing agents and/or wetting agents, such as propylene glycol or butylenes glycol. The invention further includes a pharmaceutical composition, as hereinbefore described, in combination with packaging material suitable for said composition, said packaging material including instructions for the use of the composition for the use as hereinbefore described.<br>
The 1-[(indol-3-yl)carbonyl]piperazine derivatives of the invention were found to be<br>
agonists of the CB-1 receptor, as determined in a human CB-1 reporter assay using<br>
CHO cells. Methods to determine receptor binding as well as in vitro biological<br>
activity of cannabin receptor modulators are well known in the art. In general,<br>
expressed receptor is contacted with the compound to be tested and binding or<br>
stimulation or inhibition of a functional response is measured.<br>
To measure a functional response isolated DNA encoding the CB1 receptor gene,<br>
preferably the human receptor, is expressed in suitable host cells. Such a cell might<br>
be the Chinese Hamster Ovary ceil, but other cells are also suitable. Preferably the<br>
cells are of mammalian origin.<br>
Methods to construct recombinant CB1 expressing cell lines are well known in the art<br>
(Sambrook et a!., Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor<br>
Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, latest edition). Expression of the receptor is<br>
attained by expression of the DNA encoding the desired protein. Techniques for<br>
ligation of additional sequences and construction of suitable expression systems are<br>
all, by now, well known in the art. Portions or all of the DNA encoding the desired<br>
protein can be constructed synthetically using standard solid phase techniques,<br>
preferably to include restriction sites for ease of legation. Suitable control elements for<br>
transcription and translation of the included coding sequence can be provided to the<br>
DNA coding sequences. As is well known, expression systems are now available<br>
which are compatible with a wide variety of hosts, including prokaryotic hosts such as<br>
bacteria and eukaryotic hosts such as yeast, plant cells, insect cells, mammalian<br>
cells, avian cells and the like.<br>
Cells expressing the receptor are then contacted with the test compound to observe<br>
binding, or stimulation or inhibition of a functional response.<br>
Alternatively isolated cell membranes containing the expressed CB1 (or CB2) receptor may be used of measure binding of compound.<br><br>
For measurement of binding radioactively or fluorescently labeled compounds may be used. The most widely used radiolabel led cannabin probe is [3H]CP55940, which has approximately equal affinity for CB1 and CB2 binding sites. Another assay involves screening for cannabin CB1 agonist compounds by determining the second messenger response, such as for example measurements of receptor mediated changes in cAMP or Mackinaws pathways. Thus, such a method involves expression of the CB1 receptor on the cell surface of a host cell and exposing the cell to the test compound. The second messenger response is than measured. The level of second messenger will be reduced or increased, depending on the effect of the test compound upon binding to the receptor. In addition to direct measurement of e.g. cAMP levels in the exposed cell, cells can be used which in addition to transfect ion with receptor encoding DNA are also transected with a second DNA encoding a reporter gene the expression of which correlates with receptor activation. In general, reporter gene expression might be controlled by any response element reacting to changing levels of second messenger. Suitable reporter genes are e.g. LacZ, alkaline phosphates, firefly Luciferâ€™s and green fluorescence protein. The principles of such Tran activation assays are well known in the art and are described e.g. in Stratowa, Ch, Himmler, A and Czerniiof-sky, A.P., Curr.Opin. Biotechnol. 6, 574 (1995). For selecting active agonist comÂ¬pounds on the CB1 receptor the EC50 value must be

In-vitro determination of efficacy and potency at the human CB1 receptor expressed in CHO cells<br>
Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells expressing the human CB1 receptor and a Luciferâ€™s reporter gene were suspended in phenol red / serum free DMEM / F-12 nut mix containing penicillin / streptomycin (50U/50  Î¼ g/ml) and fungi zone (1  Î¼ g/ml) and seeded into 96 well plates at a density of 3 x 104 cells per well (100  Î¼ l final volume). Cells were incubated overnight (approx. 18 h at STX, 5% C02/95% air) prior to assay.<br>
The test compound (lOmM solution in DMSO) was diluted in F12 Nut Mix to give a range of stock solutions from 0.11 mM to 0.11 nM. The stock solutions (lO Î¼ l) were added directly to the relevant wells. The plates were incubated at 37Â°C for 5 hours to allow agonist-induced expression of the incinerate enzyme. Under subdued light, LucLite substrate (Packard; reconstituted as per manufacturer"s instructions; 100 ul) was added to each well. Plates were covered with Top Seal and then incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes before counting on the Packard Top Count (single photon counting, 0.01 minute count time, 5 minute count delay). A "best-fit" can was fitted by a minimum sum of squares method to the plot of counts per second (CPS) against compound concentration (M) to obtain an ECso value. Table 1 shows the pEC50 values obtained for some representative compounds of the invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Example 21: Tail Flick Latency in Mice<br>
Mice were trained to sit still in a tail flick apparatus (Ugo Basile, Italy) whilst tail flick latency was measured. The tail was exposed to a focused beam of radiant heat at a point approximately 2.5 cm from the tip. Tail flick latency was defined as the interval between the appliance of the thermal stimulus and withdrawal of the tail. A 12 second cut-off was employed to prevent tissue damage. Four groups of eight mice were treated with vehicle or one of three doses of the test compound, administered intravenously {vehicle: saline 9 g/l; injection volume 10 mi/kg). Tail flick latency was measured before administration of the test compound and at regular intervals (typically 20, 40 and 60 minutes) after compound administration. The ED50 was calculated at Tmax-<br>
The compounds of examples 14, 15F, 150, 17A, 17C, and 17D significantly increased the tail flick latency with an ED50
