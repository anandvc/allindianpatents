				<td>CHIRAL LIGANDS USED IN TRANSITION METAL CATYLSTS FOR ASYMMETRIC ADDITION REACTIONS ESPECIALLY HYDROGENATION<br>
The present invention relates to ligands having at least two chiral centres and having a backbone which is (a) a chiral aromatic or heteroaromatic atropisomer or (b) an achiral or chiral planar-isomeric metallocene, to which are bonded in each case one -PR2 group and one P-chiral -P(0)HR group, where, in the case of an achiral ' metallocene as the backbone, the R radical in the -P(0)HR group contains at least one chiral centre; to processes for their preparation; to metal complexes of these bidentate ligands with transition metals; and to the use of the metal complexes in asymmetric syntheses, particularly in hydrogenations with hydrogen of prochlral organic compounds which contain at least one carbon/caiton or carbon/heteroatom double bond.<br>
Metal complexes with chiral ligands have been found to be valuable catalysts in asymmetric syntheses. Those metal complexes with which not only sufficient catalytic activity but also high stereoselectivity can be achieved are of practical use. Without these two properties, there is no scale-up to industrial processes for economic reasons.<br>
To date, it is still not possible to forecast which metal complexes with which ligands under which reaction conditions for which unsaturated substrates give rise to practically usable hydrogenation results with regard to the catalytic activity and stereoselectivity. A multitude of different bidentate ligands has therefore been provided, which may contain chelating groups with oxygen, sulphur, nitrogen and/or phosphorus atoms (see, for example, W. Teng, X. Zhang, Chem. Rev. 2003,103, 3029-3069). Among these bidentate ligands, P'^N and P'^P ligands have frequently been found to be useful, particularly when the chelating groups are bonded to aromatics with atropisomerism (bisarenes and bisheteroarenes) or planar isomerism (metallocenes).<br>
In recent times, a monodentate phosphine oxide benzene of the formula A and bidentate ligands of the formula B have also been described [see thesis by Xiaobin<br>
Jiang with Prof. J.G. de Vries and Prof, B.L. Feringa, University of Groningen 29 Nov. 2004 (ISBN: 90-367-2144X); Xiaobin Jiang et al., Org. Lett.. 5 (2003) 1503-6; and Xiaobin Jiang et al., Tetrahedron: Asymmetry, 15 (2004) 2223-9]:<br>

The preparation of these llgands is complicated. The synthesis generally affords racemates which are subsequently separated into their enantiomers, usually with the aid of preparative high-pressure chromatography on chiral columns. This method is very expensive and unsuitable for production on a larger scale. Alternatively, in a few cases, the enantiomers have been separated as an adduct with a chiral auxiliary reagent by selective crystallization. However, this route is too often unsuccessful. Since generally only one of the two enantiomers is required for practical applications, at least half of the desired llgand is also always lost in these methods.<br>
The llgands of the formula A have been used In Ir and Rh complexes for the asymmetric hydrogenation of prochiral imines and alkenes, and good stereoÂ¬selectivities but low catalyst activities [turnover frequency (TOP) 
There Is a great need for further ligands which have a secondary phosphlne and phosphine oxide group bonded on the backbone, which can be prepared in a simple manner and which are also suitable as ligands for metal complexes in asymmetric catalysts.<br>
It has now been found that, surprisingly, the preparation of optically pure isomers with a secondary -P(0)HR group bonded on the backbone and a -PR2 group bonded on the backbone, optionally via carbon atoms, succeeds In a particularly simple<br>
manner when the backbone is an aromatic with axial chiraiity, or the ligand contains at least one chiral metallocene. The presence of a further optical centre as well as the chiral secondary phosphine oxide group leads, In the synthesis of the bidentate ligands, oft^n to excellent diastereoselectivities and additionally allows simple purification or separation of the stereoisomers by crystallization or by preparative chromatography on achiral columns.<br>
It has also been found that, surprisingly, these ligands have an unexpectedly great influence on the catalytic properties and, compared to the known ligand B in metal complexes, frequently feature surprisingly high catalytic activities as catalysts, and, depending on the prochiral substrate, very good to very high stereoselectivities can also be achieved.<br>
The invention firstly provides compounds of the formula I having at least two chiral centres in the form of mixtures of diastereomers or pure diastereomers<br>

Commun., 2005, 4929-4931, by halogenating, for example bromlnating, a ferrocene with the substituent Rio in the ortho position, lithiating the halogenated fenrocene in the ortho position to the halogen by reacting with a lithium secondary amide (Li-NR2), and then reacting the llthiated ferrocene with a halophosphine Hal-PRzRs.

The inventive metal complexes are prepared by methods known in the literature (see also US-A-5.371.256, US-A-5.446.844, US-A-6,683,241 and E. Jacobsen, A. Pfaltz, H. Yamamoto (Eds.), Comprehensive Asymmetric Catalysis I to III, Springer Verlag, Berlin, 1999, and literature cited therein).<br>
The inventive metal complexes are homogeneous catalysts or catalyst precursors which are activable under the reaction conditions and can be used for asymmetric addition reactions to prochiral unsaturated organic compounds; see E. Jacobsen, A. Pfaltz, H. Yamamoto (Eds.), Comprehensive Asymmetric Catalysis I to III, Springer Verlag, Beriin, 1999, and B. Cornils et al., In Applied Homogeneous Catalysis with Organometallic Compounds, Volume 1, Second Edition, Wiley VCH- Veriag, (2002). Further applications are, for example, the amination of aromatlcs or heteroaromatics which contain leaving groups, for example halide or sulphonate, with primary or secondary amines with palladium complexes, or the preferably Rh- catalysed enantioselective ring-opening reaction of oxabicyclic alkanes (M. Lautens et al. in Acc. Chem. Res. Volume 36 (203), pages 48-58).<br>
The metal complexes may, for example, be used for the asymmetric hydrogenatlon (addition of hydrogen) of prochiral compounds with carbon/cariDon or carbon/hetero- atom double bonds. Such hydrogenations with soluble homogeneous metal complexes are described, for example. In Pure and Appl. Chem,, Vol. 68, No. 1, pages 131-138 (1996). Preferred unsaturated compounds to be hydrogenated contain the C=C, C=N and/or C=0 groups. For the hydrogenation, preference Is given in accordance with the invention to using metal complexes of ruthenium, rhodium and iridium.<br>
The invention further provides for the use of the inventive metal complexes as homogeneous catalysts for preparing chiral organic compounds by asymmetric addition of hydrogen to a carbon or carijon-heteroatom double bond in prochiral organic compounds. <br>
A further aspect of the invention is a process for preparing chiral organic compounds by asymmetric addition of hydrogen to a carbon or carbon-heteroatom double bond In prochiral oiganic compounds in the presence of a catalyst, which is characterized in that the addition is perfonned in the presence of catalytic amounts of at least one inventive metal complex.<br>
Preferred prochiral unsaturated compounds to be hydrogenated may contain one or more identical or different C=C, C=N and/or C=0 groups in open-chain or cyclic organic compounds, where the C=C, C=N and/or C=0 groups may be part of a ring system or be exocyclic groups. The prochiral unsaturated compounds may be alkenes, cycloalkenes, heterocycloalkenes, and also open-chain or cyclic ketones, a.p-diketones, a- or p-ketocarboxylic acids and their a,p-ketoacetals or -ketals, estei^ and amides, ketlmines and kethydrazones. Alkenes, cycloalkenes, heterocycloÂ¬alkenes also include enamides.<br>
The process according to the invention can be performed at low or elevated temperatures, for example temperatures of -20 to ISO'C, preferably of -10 to 100Â°C, and more preferably of 10 to 80Â°C. The optical yields are generally better at relatively low temperature than at relatively high temperatures.<br>
The process according to the invention can be performed at standard pressure or elevated pressure. The pressure may, for example, be 10Â® to 2x10' Pa (pascal). Hydrogenatlons may be perfomied at standard pressure or at elevated pressure.<br>
Catalysts are used preferably In amounts of 0.00001 to 10 mol%, more preferably 0.00001 to 6 mol% and especially preferably 0.00001 to 2 mol%, based on the compound to be hydrogenated.<br>
The preparation of the ligands and catalysts and the hydrogenation can be performed without or in the presence of an inert solvent, in which case one solvent or mixtures of solvents may be used. Suitable solvents are, for example, aliphatic, cycloaliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons (pentane, hexane, petroleum ether, cyclohexane.<br>
methylcyclohexane, benzene, toluene, xylene), aliphatic halohydrocarbons (methylene chloride, chloroform, di- and tetrachloroethane), nitriles (acetonitrile, propionitrile, benzonitrile), ethers (diethyl ether, dibutyl ether, t-butyl methyl ether, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, ethylene glycol diethyl ether, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether, tetrahydroHiran, dioxane, diethylene glycol monomethyl or monoethyl ether), ketones (acetone, methyl isobutyl ketone), carboxylic esters and lactones (ethyl acetate or methyl acetate, valerolactone), N-substituted lactams (N-methyl- pyrrolidone), carboxamides (dimethylacetamide, dimethylformamide), acyclic ureas (dimethylimidazoline), and sulphoxides and sulphones (dimethyl sulphoxide, dimethyl sulphone, tetramethylene sulphoxide, tetramethylene sulphone) and optionally fluorinated alcohols (methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, ethylene glycol mono- methyl ether, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether, diethylene glycol monomethyl ether, 1,1,1-trifluoroethanol) and water. Suitable solvents are also low molecular weight carboxylic acids, for example acetic acid.<br>
The reactions can be performed in the presence of cocatalysts, for example quaternary ammonium halides (tetrabutylammonium chloride, bromide or iodide) or protic acids, for example mineral acids such as HCI or strong organic acids such as trifluoroacetic acid, or mixtures of such halides and acids (see, for example, US-A- 5,371,256, US-A-5,446,844 and US-A-5,583,241 and EP-A-0 691 949). The presence of fluorinated alcohols, for example 1,1,1-trifluoroethanol, can also promote the catalytic reaction. The addition of bases, for example tertiary amines or phosphines, alkali metal hydroxides, secondary amides, alkoxides, carbonates and hydrogencarbonates may also be advantageous. The selection of a cocatalyst is guided mainly by the metal in the metal complex and the substrate. In the hydro- genation of prochiral arylketimines, the use of iridium complexes in combination with tetra-Ci-C4-alkylammonium iodides and mineral acids, preferably HI, has been found to be useful.<br>
The metal complexes used as catalysts may be added as separately prepared isolated compounds, or else formed in situ before the reaction and then mixed with the substrate to be hydrogenated. It may be advantageous to additionally add ligandsâ<br>
in the reaction using isolated nfietal complexes, or to use an excess of the ligands in the in situ preparation. The excess may, for example, be 1 to 6 mol and preferably 1 to 2 mol, based on the metal compound used for the preparation.<br>
The process according to the invention is generally perfonned in such a way that the catalyst is initially charged and then the substrate, optionally reaction assistant and the compound to be added on are added, and then the reaction is started. Gaseous compounds to be added on, for example hydrogen, are preferably injected under pressure. The process can be performed continuously or batchwise in various reactor types.<br>
The chiral organic compounds preparable in accordance with the invention are active substances or intermediates for preparing such substances, especially in the sector of the preparation of aromas and flavourings, pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals.<br>
The examples which follow illustrate the invention. All reactions are performed with the exclusion of air under arigon and with degassed solvents.<br>

B) Preparation of metal complexes<br>
Example B1: Preparation of an Ir complex (COD = cyclooctadiene) A solution of 50.2 mg (0.1 mmol) of ligand LI in 2 ml of methanol is added to a solution of 127.2 mg (0.1 mmol) of [lr(C0D)2]BArF in 2 ml of methanol, and the reaction mixture is stirred over 30 minutes. The methanol is removed under reduced pressure and the brown-red residue is washed with pentane. NMR (161.97 MHz, 300 K, CD2CI2): 8 = 103.1 (d, Jpp = 23.8): 23.4 (d, Jpp = 23.8).<br>
Example B2: Preparation of an Ru complex<br>
A solution of 50.2 mg (0.1 mmol) of ligand LI in 2 ml of methanol is added to a solution of 30.6 mg (0.05 mmol) of [RuCl2(p-methylcumene)]2 in 2 ml of methanol.<br>
and the reaction mixture is stin"ed over 30 minutes. The methanol is removed under reduced pressure and the residue is washed with pentane.	NMR (161.97<br>
MHz, 300 K, MeOH-d4): 6 = 66.4 (s), 25.9 (s).<br>
Example B3: Preparation of an Rh complex<br>
A solution of 50.2 mg (0.1 mmol) of ligand LI in 2 ml of methanol is added to a solution of 30.6 mg (0.05 mmol) of [Rh(C0D)2]BArF in 2 ml of methanol, and the reaction mixture is stirred over 30 minutes. The methanol is removed under reduced pressure and the residue is washed with pentane.	NMR (161.97 MHz, 300 K, CDCI3):<br>
6 = 62.4 (s). 33.4 (d, ^JPRH = 153 Hz), 23.5 (d, ^JPP = 23 Hz).<br>
C) Use examples<br>
All operations are performed under argon and with degassed solvents. Example C1:<br>
4.73 mg (0.0127 mmol) of [Rh(norbornadiene)2]BF4 and 6.67 mg (0.0133 mmol) of ligand L1 (ratio of ligand to metal = 1.05) are stirred In 2 ml of methanol over 10 minutes. A solution of 400 mg (2.5 mmol) of dimethyl itaconate (DMI) in 4 ml of methanol and then sufficient methanol (4 ml) that the substrate concentration is 0.25 M are added to this solution. The argon is drawn off with vacuum and the vessel is connected to a hydrogen supply (1 bar). Switching on the stirrer starts the hydrogenation. After 1 hour, the stirrer is switched off and the solution is placed under argon again. Conversion and enantiomeric excess (ee) are detemriined by gas chromatography with the aid of a chiral column (Lipodex E): the conversion is complete and the ee is 87%.<br>
Examples C2-C32:<br>
The hydrogenations of further substrates, which are compiled in Table 1 below are performed in an analogous manner. The hydrogenations with higher hydrogen pressure are performed in a steel autoclave. In these, the reaction solutions are injected into the argon-purged autoclave with a cannula under an argon countercurrent. <br>
The results are reported in Table 2 below. The abbreviations in Table 1 mean: ee = enantiomeric excess. GC = gas chromatography. TMS = trimethylsilyl. HPLC = high-pressure liquid chromatography.<br>
