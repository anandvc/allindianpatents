FOR PROCESSING FRAME ACCORDING TO SERVICE QUALITY<br>
CLAIM OF PRIORITY<br>
This application makes reference to, incorporates the same herein, and claims<br>
all benefits accruing under 35 U.S.C. ยง119 from an application entitled TURBO<br>
CHANNEL ENCODING/DECODING DEVICE AND METHOD FOR<br>
PROCESSING FRAME ACCORDING TO SERVICE QUALITY earlier filed in<br>
the Korean Industrial Property Office on 31 March 1998, and there duly assigned<br>
Serial No. 98-11380.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a device and method for encoding/decoding<br>
a channel in a mobile communication system, and in particular, to device and<br>
method for encoding/decoding a channel using a turbo code.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
An encoder using a turbo code (hereinafter, referred to as a turbo encoder}<br>
encodes an N-bit input frame into parity symbols using two simple parallel<br>
concatenated codes, wherein an RSC (Recursive Systematic Convolutional) code<br>
is generally used as a component code.<br>
FIGs. 1 and 2 illustrate structures of conventional turbo encoder and decoder,<br>
which are disclosed in a paper entitled "Improved Turbo Coding for Voice<br>
Transmission in FPLMTS", pp. 423-427, 7th telecommunication information joint<br>
conference, Korean Electronics Society/Telecommunications Society, 17 April<br>
1997.<br>
The turbo encoder of FIG. 1 includes a first constituent encoder 12, a second<br>
constituent encoder 14 and an interleaver 16 interconnected therebetween. For the<br>
first and second constituent encoders 12 and 14, an RSC encoder can be used,<br>
which is well known in the art. The interleaver 16 has the same size as a frame<br>
length N of the input data bit, and decreases a correlation among the data bits by<br>
rearranging the input data bits dk being provided to the second constituent encoder<br>
14. Therefore, the parallel concatenated codes for the input data bits become xk<br>
(=dk), y1k and y2k.<br>
A turbo decoder for decoding the output of the turbo encoder shown in FIG.<br>
1 is also well disclosed in the above-mentioned paper. FIG. 2 illustrates a structure<br>
of the turbo decoder, which includes an adder 18, subtracters 20 and 22, a soft<br>
decision circuit 24, delays 26, 28 and 30, and MAP (Maximum A Posterior<br>
Probability) decoders 32 and 34. Further, the turbo decoder includes an interleaver<br>
36 which is identical to the interleaver 16 of FIG. 1, and deinterleavers 38 and 40.<br>
Such structured turbo decoder repeatedly decodes the received data by the frame<br>
unit using a MAP decoding algorithm, thereby increasing a bit error rate (BER).<br>
The turbo encoder has the interleaver 16 as shown in FIG. 1, which implies<br>
that encoding and decoding should be performed by the frame unit in order to use<br>
the turbo encoder. Accordingly, it can be appreciated that memories and<br>
calculations required for the MAP decoders 32 and 34 shown in FIG. 2 are<br>
proportional to a value obtained by multiplying the frame size by a state number of<br>
the first and second constituent encoders 12 and 14 of FIG. 1.<br>
In a mobile communication system, voice and data are transmitted at a data<br>
rate of several Kbps to several Mbps, and a frame length of data input to a channel<br>
encoder is variably from several ms (milliseconds) to several hundred ms in a time<br>
domain. For example, in the case where the data is transmitted and received at a<br>
data rate of over 32Kbps, if the data input to the turbo encoder is channel encoded<br>
and transmitted with a fixed length frame, the turbo decoder requires increased<br>
memories and calculations to decode the received data which has a very long frame<br>
length. The turbo encoder shows a property that an error correction performance is<br>
increased as the frame length of the input data is longer, whereas the channel<br>
interleaver increases in size, thereby increasing the memories and calculations<br>
required in a decoder.<br>
In addition, from the viewpoint of the turbo encoder, if the length of the<br>
input frame is too short, the interleaver 16 in the turbo encoder cannot sufficiently<br>
remove the correlation among the input data, deteriorating the error correction<br>
performance. That is, when the frame length of the input data is longer, the turbo<br>
encoder structured as shown in FIG. 1 and the turbo decoder structured as shown<br>
in FIG. 2 require the increased calculations and memories in the process of<br>
encoding and decoding. Otherwise, when the frame length of the input data is<br>
shorter, the turbo encoder may show a low performance, as compared with a<br>
convolutional encoder or a concatenated encoder, thereby decreasing the BER.<br>
Accordingly, it is possible to decrease the calculations and memory capacity<br>
required for decoding, by appropriately varying the frame size of the data input to<br>
the turbo encoder, independent of the data rate for the corresponding service, while<br>
fully securing the high BER required in the communication system.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a channel<br>
encoding device and method for variably encoding input data frames to sub or super<br>
frames of appropriate length according to the service quality of user data to<br>
transmit.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a channel decoding<br>
device and method for decoding encoded frame data whose frame length is<br>
appropriately varied according to the service quality of user data to transmit.<br>
It is still another object of the present invention to provide a turbo channel<br>
encoding/decoding device and method for disassembling a long input frame into<br>
multiple sub frames having an appropriate length to encode the disassembled sub<br>
frames, separately decoding the divided encoded sub frames and then reassembling<br>
the decoded sub frames into the original frame.<br>
It is further still another object of the present invention to provide a turbo<br>
channel encoding/decoding device and method for assembling short input frames<br>
into a super frame having an appropriate length to encode the assembled super<br>
frame, decoding the assembled encoded super frame and then reassembling the<br>
decoded super frame into the original frames.<br>
It is further still another object of the present invention to provide a turbo<br>
channel encoding/decoding device and method for determining an optimal length<br>
of the sub/super frames by analyzing a quality of service (QoS) such as a data rate<br>
and a service type of input frame data to be transmitted, and disassembling or<br>
assembling an input data frame into sub or super frames according to the<br>
determination.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described<br>
hereinbelow with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following<br>
description, well known functions or constructions are not described in detail since<br>
they would obscure the invention in unnecessary detail.<br>
A future communication system provides various services of different QoS<br>
(Quality of Service), and QoS parameters include a time delay, a BER or a frame<br>
error rate (FER), and so forth. In the communication system, the high error rate-<br>
permitted services includes a voice service which requires a relatively short time<br>
delay and a short message service (SMS) which permits even a long time delay. On<br>
the other hand, among the services requiring the low error rate, a video conference<br>
service requires a short time delay, and a still image or Internet file transfer service<br>
permits even the relatively long time delay. Even the same service may have the<br>
different time delay and data rate.<br>
For example, in the image service for transmitting and receiving moving<br>
picture information, a data rate is 32-2048Kbps and a permissible time delay is 10-<br>
400ms: the data rate and the permissible time delay can be, however, varied<br>
according to a class of the user or terminal using the service, a class of the base<br>
station providing the service or a channel condition during the corresponding<br>
service. Particularly, in the mobile communication system, since an output power<br>
of a base station or a mobile station is limited, it is inadequate to increase a<br>
transmission power of only a certain user for a high quality service. This is because<br>
when the transmission power of the specific user is increased, interference to other<br>
users will increase in proportion to the increased transmission power. Therefore,<br>
there is a demand for a method capable of providing various multimedia services<br>
with the reduced interference to the other users, by minimizing an increase in the<br>
transmission power.<br>
In another example, a short packet transmission service requires a low data<br>
rate and a very low error rate. However, when the time delay is out of the question,<br>
it is reasonable to decrease the error rate even though the time delay is somewhat<br>
increased.<br>
In the meantime, the turbo encoder, one of channel encoders for error<br>
correction, shows a property that the bit error rate (BER) or the frame error rate<br>
(FER) are varied according to the frame length of the input data. That is, the turbo<br>
encoder consists of the constituent encoders having a short constraint length:<br>
however, the error correction capability is improved as the correlation between the<br>
data input to the respective constituent encoders is decreased, due to existence of<br>
the interleaver in the turbo encoder. The correlation between the data input to the<br>
respective constituent encoders becomes lower, as the frame length of the data input<br>
to the turbo encoder becomes longer. Therefore, an increase in the frame length of<br>
the input data improves the error correction capability. However, an increase in<br>
length of the input frame causes an increase in the time delay at the encoder and the<br>
decoder.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates a structure of a channel transmitter including a turbo<br>
encoder according to an embodiment of the present invention. The turbo encoder<br>
shown in FIG. 3 disassembles one input frame into several sub frames or assembles<br>
several input frames into one super frame by counting bits of the input user data<br>
according to message information, and thereafter encoding the disassembled or<br>
assembled frames with a turbo code to transmit the encoded frames via a<br>
transmission channel. A term "message information" used in the specification refers<br>
to information about the QoS, i.e., service type, rate of data such as voice, character,<br>
image and moving picture data, size of the input data frame, permissible delay, and<br>
permissible error. The message information is exchanged between a base station and<br>
a mobile station during a call setup and the exchange of the message information<br>
is continued till termination of the corresponding service. Further, information<br>
predetermined between the base station and the mobile station during the call setup<br>
can be also varied during the corresponding service by data exchanging. That is, the<br>
message information includes information representing the size of the frame to be<br>
processed in the turbo encoder and the frame size information can be differently set<br>
according to a rate of the data to be serviced. For example, when 10ms frame data<br>
is serviced at a data rate of 2048Kbps, one frame data consists of 20480 bits. In this<br>
case, the turbo encoder according to the present invention disassembles (or divides)<br>
the 10ms frame into 10/4ms frames and then, turbo encodes four 8192-bit frames.<br>
The turbo decoder then decodes the four frames and reassembles into one 20480-bit<br>
frame.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3, upon receipt of user data UD having a data rate of over<br>
several tens Kbps such as character, image and moving picture data, which is not<br>
voice data having a data rate of several Kbps, a source data encoder 42 encodes the<br>
received user data UD by the fixed length frame according to the service type and<br>
then provides the encoded user data to an input of a bit counter 50. For example, the<br>
source data encoder 42 encodes the voice data with 10ms frame, the character data<br>
with 20ms frame, the image data with 80ms frame and the moving picture data with<br>
40ms, and provides the respective encoded data in different frame lengths to the bit<br>
counter 50. A central processing unit (CPU) 46 transfers information about the QoS,<br>
i.e., service type of the user data to be transmitted (e.g., voice, character, image or<br>
moving picture) and the data rate to a message information receiver 108 of FIG. 6<br>
via a message information transmitter 44. The channel transmission device of FIG.<br>
3 can be equally applied to both the base station and the mobile station.<br>
Although the present invention is described with reference to an embodiment<br>
which transmits the message information to the decoder using a separate transmitter,<br>
it is also possible to transmit the message information by loading it in a head area<br>
of a transmission frame during data transmission.<br>
The CPU 46 reads, from a frame disassemble/assemble information storage<br>
48, QoS information including information about service type of data to be<br>
transmitted, corresponding data rate, permissible delay, permissible error rate (BER<br>
or FER) and frame length, and information about service class of the base station<br>
or the mobile station. Next, the CPU 46 determines to disassemble the frame and<br>
also determines the size and number of the disassembled frames, using the read<br>
information. Alternatively, the CPU 46 may determine to assemble the frames and<br>
also determine the number of the frames to be assembled, using the read<br>
information. Based on the determination, the CPU 46 provides a frame<br>
disassemble/assemble control signal and an interleaving mode signal to the bit<br>
counter 50 and a programmable interleaver 52, respectively, to perform turbo<br>
encoding. That is, according to the QoS of the data to transmit, the CPU 46<br>
determines how many consecutive input frames should be assembled to generate a<br>
super frame, or determines the number of sub frames which will be generated by<br>
disassembling one input frame. The turbo encoder then turbo encodes data bits of <br>
the super frame or data bits of the respective sub frames disassembled. Here, as<br>
stated above, the QoS may include size of the input frame data, permissible delay,<br>
permissible error rate, etc.<br>
In determining to disassemble or assemble the frames by the CPU 46, the<br>
following principles are considered.<br>
In general, for transmitting the voice data, the mobile communication system<br>
uses a low data rate of below several tens Kbps, has the transmission delay of<br>
several tens ms (milliseconds) and requires the BER of about 10-2-10-4. Since the<br>
most serious limitation in transmitting the voice data is the transmission delay, the<br>
system has a serious limitation in disassembling/assembling the input data of the<br>
turbo encoder, i.e., the output frame of the source data encoder 42. For example, if<br>
the output frame of the source data encoder 42 is 10ms long and the maximum delay<br>
time permitted in the turbo encoder is 20ms, it is possible to assemble two 10ms<br>
frames output from the source data encoder 42 into one super frame, which will be<br>
input to the turbo encoder. However, if the maximum delay time permitted in the<br>
turbo encoder is 10ms, it is reasonable to use the 10ms frame output from source<br>
data encoder 42 as it is, without assembling.<br>
In the meantime, for transmitting character, image and moving picture data,<br>
the system has the permissible transmission delay from several tens ms to several<br>
hundreds ms and requires the BER of 10-6-10-7. A performance of the turbo encoder<br>
is increased as the frame length of the input data is increased. However, since the<br>
number of calculations and memories required in the turbo decoder is directly<br>
proportional to the frame size, it is needed to select an appropriate frame size. <br>
Therefore, for the packet data service, it is possible to satisfy the required BER by<br>
enabling the CPU 46 to generate a sub/super frame control signal for<br>
disassembling/assembling the data frames of M-bit length output from the source<br>
data encoder 42 into sub/super frames of N-bit length.<br>
That is, the frame disassemble/assemble information storage 48 stores frame<br>
disassemble/assemble information for increasing the length N of the sub/super<br>
frame for the service requiring the low BER and decreasing the length N of the<br>
sub/super frame for the service requiring the short time delay and the high BER.<br>
The CPU 46 reads the frame disassemble/assemble information from the frame<br>
disassemble/assemble information storage 48 according to the service type and the<br>
frame length of the input data.<br>
Disassembling/assembling the frames input to the turbo encoder can be<br>
appreciated more apparently from the following descriptions. For example, a frame<br>
length of the data input to the turbo encoder is 2048 bits, for a service having a data<br>
rate 2048Kbps/10ms among the services requiring the low BER. In the mobile<br>
station for providing the above service, the turbo decoder requires a memory<br>
capacity for storing the bits obtained by multiplying 20480 bits by a soft decision<br>
value. An increase in the memory capacity of the mobile station causes an increase<br>
in complexity and cost of the mobile station.<br>
However, in the service having the data rate 2048Kbps/10ms, if the channel<br>
encoder divides (or disassembles) a frame input to the turbo encoder into four sub<br>
frames and encodes the disassembled sub frames and the turbo decoder in the<br>
channel decoder then decodes the sub frames and reassembles the decoded sub*<br>
frames into the original frame, the turbo decoder requires a memory capacity<br>
capable of storing the bits obtained by multiplying 8192 bits by the soft decision<br>
value, thereby causing a reduction in the required memory capacity.<br>
Furthermore, in the service having a low data rate of 32Kbps/10ms among<br>
the services requiring the low BER, each data frame input to the turbo encoder will<br>
consist of 320 bits. If encoding is performed at a data rate of 32Kbps/80ms (i.e.,<br>
each frame consists of 2560 bits), the time delay is somewhat increased, as<br>
compared with the case where turbo encoding is performed at the data rate of<br>
32Kbps/10ms (i.e., each frame consists of 320 bits). However, it is possible to<br>
decrease the BER for the same signal-to-noise ratio Eb/No and decrease the Eb/No<br>
value for the same BER, thereby increasing the overall system capacity.<br>
In the mobile communication system, not all the users or mobile stations are<br>
provided with the same services. Instead, the available data rate is limited according<br>
to the class of the user, the mobile station or the base station. In addition, the<br>
available data rate may be limited due to the memory capacity determined according<br>
to the class of the respective mobile stations. Accordingly, when the data rate is<br>
variable from 32Kbps to 2048Kbps according to the service type (or service option)<br>
and the permissible time delay also varies from 10ms to 400ms, the device<br>
according to the present invention can vary the length of the frames input to the<br>
turbo encoder according to the class of the user or mobile station, the class of the<br>
base station providing the corresponding service or the channel condition while<br>
using the corresponding service. For example, when the channel conditions is very<br>
bad, the device according to the present invention can satisfy the error rate required<br>
in the corresponding service by increasing the length of the frames input to the turbo ~<br>
encoder and permitting an increase in the time delay rather than increasing the<br>
transmission power.<br>
The frame disassemble/assemble information which is the message<br>
information being exchanged between the base station and the mobile station, has<br>
information about the size of the frames to be encoded/decoded, wherein the frame<br>
size is determined according to the user class, the mobile station class, the base<br>
station class and the channel condition.<br>
The bit counter 50 counts N bits of the input data according to an N-bit<br>
frame disassemble/assemble control signal output from the CPU 46, and provides<br>
the counted N bits to the programmable interleaver 52 and first and second input<br>
buffers 54 and 56. Also, the bit counter 50 generates a bit count termination signal<br>
to the CPU 46 whenever it counts N bits of the input data. Therefore, it can be<br>
appreciated that the bit counter 50 disassembles or assembles the input frames into<br>
sub or super frames having a specific length, under the control of the CPU 46 which<br>
uses the QoS information, such as the service type and the data rate of the input<br>
data, stored in the frame disassemble/assemble information storage 48, and provides<br>
the sub or super frames to the programmable interleaver 52 and the first and second<br>
input buffers 54 and 56.<br>
An interleaving processor 72 in the programmable interleaver 52 reads<br>
interleaving parameters from an interleaving parameter storage 70 according to an<br>
interleaving mode control signal output from the CPU 46 to process the read<br>
interleaving parameters, and provides the processing result to an interleaving<br>
address mapper 74. Here, the CPU 46 provides the interleaver processor 72 with the <br>
following interleaving information.<br>
First, in the case where a turbo interleaver having a single interleaving<br>
method is used as the interleaver 52, optimal parameter values determined to have<br>
the highest performance according to the length of data information bits for<br>
interleaving and the variable length of the interleaver are provided as the<br>
interleaving information. The parameter values are determined by the structure of<br>
the turbo interleaver.<br>
Second, in the case where a turbo interleaver having one or more interleaving<br>
methods is used as the interleaver 52, optimal parameter values determined to have<br>
the highest performance through experiments according to the length of the<br>
information bits for interleaving and the variable length of the interleaver in the<br>
corresponding interleaving mode are provided as the interleaving information. For<br>
example, in the case where the required transmission delay time is short and the<br>
input data frame of the turbo encoder, i.e., the output data frame of the source data<br>
encoder 42 is small in size (or length), a uniform interleaver such as a block<br>
interleaver or a cyclic shift interleaver is used for the interleaver 52. Otherwise, in<br>
the case where the required transmission delay time is relatively long and the input<br>
data frame is large in size, a non-uniform interleaver such as a random interleaver<br>
is used for the interleaver 52. From the foregoing description, it can be understood<br>
that various interleavers can be used according to the size of the data to be<br>
interleaved.<br>
Upon receiving user data bits of the sub or super frames of N-bit length<br>
disassembled or assembled by the bit counter 50, the interleaving address mapper<br>
74 maps the input bits to the addresses corresponding to the interleaving processing<br>
result so as to perform interleaving, and provides the interleaved data to an<br>
interleaved input data buffer (ILIB) 78 in the first buffer 54 or an ILIB 90 in the<br>
second buffer 56.<br>
The first and second input buffers 54 and 56 each consist of two input<br>
switches, two output switches, an input data save buffer (IDSB) with input and<br>
output ports connected to ones of the input and output switches, and the ILIB with<br>
input and output ports connected to the other ones of the input and output switches.<br>
In the drawing, reference numerals 76 and 88 denote IDSBs, reference numerals 78<br>
and 90 denote ILIBs, reference numerals 80, 84, 92 and 96 denote input switches,<br>
and reference numerals 82, 86, 94 and 98 denote output switches. All the switches<br>
are controlled by the CPU 46. The switches 80, 82, 84 and 86 in the first input<br>
buffer 54 operate in alternation with the switches 92, 94, 96 and 98 in the second<br>
input buffer 56. That is, input switches 80 and 84 in the first input buffer 54 are in<br>
the ON state and the output switches 82 and 86 are in the OFF state, while the input<br>
switches 92 and 96 in the second input buffer 56 are in the OFF state and the output<br>
switches 94 and 98 are in the ON state; and conversely.<br>
Accordingly, when the bit counter 50 counts N bits of the input data under<br>
the control of the CPU 46, the data output from the bit counter is first stored in the<br>
IDSB 76 in the first buffer 54 through the input switch 80 which is initially in the<br>
ON state. At this moment, the counted data bits output from the bit counter 50 are<br>
interleaved by the programmable interleaver 52 and then stored in the ILIB 78 in the<br>
first input buffer 54 through the switch 84. If the bit counter 50 generates a bit count<br>
termination signal for the sub/super frame of N-bit length, the CPU 46 then repeats <br>
the above procedure after switching the first input buffer 54 to an output state and<br>
the second input buffer 56 to an input state. As a result, the next N bits counted<br>
from the bit counter 50 and the interleaved data from the programmable interleaver<br>
52 are stored in the IDSB 88 and the ILIB 90 in the second input buffer 56,<br>
respectively.<br>
During this operation, a first RSC (RSC1) 58 and a second RSC (RSC2) 60<br>
receive the N-bit sub/super frame data and the corresponding interleaved data output<br>
from the IDSB 76 and ILIB 78 in the first input buffer through the output switches<br>
82 and 86, respectively, and then performs turbo encoding by the N-bit frame unit<br>
in the same principle as the turbo encoder of FIG. 1.<br>
Next, when the N-bit frame data is completely stored in the second input<br>
buffer 56, the first input buffer 54 is again switched to the input state and the second<br>
input buffer 56 to the output state. Therefore, the RSC1 58 and the RSC2 60 turbo<br>
encode the data which are alternately output by the N-bit frame unit from the first<br>
and second input buffers 54 and 56.<br>
The turbo encoded bits from the RSC1 58 and the RSC2 60 are multiplexed<br>
by a multiplexer 62 and then interleaved by a channel interleaver 64. In the case<br>
where the several input frames are assembled into one super frame and the data is<br>
turbo encoded by the super frame unit, the channel interleaver 64 performs channel<br>
interleaving by the super frame unit as shown in FIG. 4. On the other hand, when<br>
one input frame is disassembled into several sub frames and the data is turbo<br>
encoded by the sub frame unit, the channel interleaving is performed by the input<br>
frame unit as shown in FIG. 5. That is, the channel interleaver 64 performs channel<br>
interleaving by assembling the output symbols of the turbo encoder, encoded by the<br>
super frame or sub frame unit, as large in size as the input frame. The interleaved<br>
data is modulated by a modulator 66 and then transmitted through a transmission<br>
channel 68.<br>
Accordingly, the novel channel transmission device shown in FIG. 3<br>
assembles the input data frames to increase the bit number N when the low BER is<br>
required from an analysis of the QoS information such as the user"s service type<br>
(e.g., voice, character, image and moving picture) and the data rate, but<br>
disassembles the input data frame to decrease the bit number N per frame when the<br>
low delay time is required. In this manner, the channel transmission device can<br>
maximize an efficiency of the turbo encoder.<br>
FIG. 4 is a diagram for explaining operation of the invention, wherein the<br>
frames are assembled at a low or medium data rate and then turbo encoded. A<br>
parameter J can be varied from 1 to 8 according to the number of the frames to be<br>
assembled. In the turbo encoder, the bit number of an input data frame, which is<br>
determined by a value obtained by multiplying the bit number per frame by the<br>
number, J, of the frames to be assembled, may be limited.<br>
FIG. 5 is a diagram for explaining operation of the invention, wherein a<br>
frame data is disassembled at a high data rate and then turbo encoded. A parameter<br>
I can be varied from 1 to 4 according to the number of the disassembled sub frames.<br>
Likewise, in the turbo encoder, the bit number of an input data frame, which is<br>
determined by a value obtained by multiplying the bit number per frame by the<br>
number, I, of the disassembled sub frames, may be limited.<br>
The data on the transmission channel transmitted by the turbo channel<br>
encoder of FIG. 3 is decoded into the original data by the turbo channel decoder of<br>
FIG. 6, which can be understood more apparently from the following descriptions.<br>
FIG. 6 illustrates the turbo channel decoder structure according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. The turbo channel decoder of FIG. 6 counts<br>
bits of the user data input by the N-bit sub/super frame unit according to message<br>
information to decode the input user data and thereafter, assembles or disassembles<br>
the decoded data into the frames having the original length, thereby to reassemble<br>
the user data.<br>
Upon receiving the frame of N-bit length through the transmission channel<br>
68, a demodulator 100 demodulates the received frame data and provides the<br>
demodulated data to a channel deinterleaver 102. The channel deinterleaver 102<br>
descrambles the demodulated data frame and applies it to a demultiplexer 104,<br>
which demultiplexes the multiplexed data symbols and parity symbols and provides<br>
the demultiplexed symbols to a bit counter 106. Here, a message information<br>
receiver 108 shown in FIG. 6 receives the message information regarding the<br>
service type of the user and the data rate that the message information transmitter<br>
44 of FIG. 3 has transmitted, and provides the received message information to a<br>
CPU 112.<br>
The CPU 112 analyzes the message information provided from the message<br>
information receiver 108 and reads frame disassemble/assemble information from<br>
a frame disassemble/assemble information storage 110 according to the analysis.""<br>
Also, the CPU 112 analyzes the interleaving information included in the message<br>
information and provides an interleaving mode signal and a parameter value to an<br>
interleaver and a deinterleaver in a turbo decoder 116 according to the analysis,<br>
thereby performing turbo interleaving. In addition, the CPU 112 performs turbo<br>
decoding and frame reassembling by outputting an N-bit frame disassemble or<br>
assemble control signal and a frame reassemble control signal according to the read<br>
frame disassemble/assemble information. Here, the information stored in the frame<br>
disassemble/assemble information storage 110 is similar to that stored in the frame<br>
disassemble/assemble information storage 48 of FIG. 3.<br>
The bit counter 106 consecutively provides the data output from the<br>
demultiplexer 104 to a frame buffer 114 by the N-bit sub/super frame unit according<br>
to the N-bit frame disassemble or assemble control signal. Switches 126 and 132 in<br>
the frame buffer 114 are initially in the ON state and the other switches 128 and 130<br>
are initially in the OFF state.<br>
Therefore, the counted data bits output from the bit counter 106 are initially<br>
stored in a first N-frame buffer (N-FB1) 122. Upon completion of storing the N-bit<br>
data output from the bit counter 106 in the N-FB1 122, the bit counter 106 generates<br>
an N-bit count termination signal. Upon detecting the N-bit count termination<br>
signal, the CPU 112 turns off switches 126 and 132 in the frame buffer 114 and<br>
turns on the other switches 130 and 128. Then, the N-bit data output from the bit<br>
counter 106 is stored in a second N-frame buffer (N-FB2) 124. At this moment, the<br>
received data stored in the N-FB 1 122 is decoded by a turbo decoder 116 having the<br>
same structure as that of FIG. 2.<br>
Accordingly, under the control of the CPU 112, the N-FB1 122 and the N-<br>
FB2 124 in the frame buffer 114 alternately receive and store the data output by the<br>
N-bit unit from the bit counter 106, and the stored data is decoded by the turbo<br>
decoder 116. The decoded data output from the turbo decoder 116 is reassembled<br>
into the frames of the original length by a frame reassembler 118 which is<br>
controlled by the CPU 112, and then output as the user data through a source data<br>
decoder 120.<br>
In sum, the turbo decoder 116 receives a super frame consisting of multiple<br>
frames or multiple sub frames disassembled from a frame, and turbo decodes the<br>
received frames. The frame reassembler 118 reassembles, during the call setup, the<br>
output of the turbo decoder 116 into the frames in response to information about the<br>
number of the frames constituting the super frame and the size of the frames or<br>
information about the number of the sub frames disassembled from the input frame<br>
and the size of the sub frames, under the control of the CPU 112.<br>
The turbo encoder described above can be also implemented in the following<br>
method. In this exemplary method, any one of the bit counter 50 and the buffers 54<br>
and 56 for interleaving, shown in FIG. 3, is not required. In frame assembling<br>
operation, the data bits are sequentially stored in the memory (i.e, buffer 54 or 56)<br>
for interleaving as many as the number of the frames to be assembled. To the RSC1<br>
in the turbo encoder, data bits are sequentially output as many as the number of the<br>
non-interleaved assembled frames, and to the RSC2, the data bits are output as<br>
many as the number of the assembled frames which are interleaved to the addresses<br>
of the interleaving address mapper generated by the interleaving processor. In this<br>
manner, it is possible to turbo encode the input data by the data bits as many as the"<br>
size of the frame assembled with one or more frames.<br>
In another example, in the frame assembling operation, the input data bits are<br>
sequentially stored in the memory for interleaving. To the RSC1 in the turbo<br>
encoder, the data bits are sequentially output as many as the size of the<br>
disassembled frames, and to the RSC2, the data bits are interleaved and output as<br>
many as the size of the assembled frames. In this way, it is possible to turbo encode<br>
the input data by the data bits as many as the size of the sub frames disassembled<br>
from one frame.<br>
Accordingly, the turbo channel encoder of FIG. 3 and the turbo channel<br>
decoder of FIG. 6 assemble input data frames into a super frame to encode and<br>
decode the input frames by the super frame unit when the input data frames are too<br>
short, and disassemble an input frame into multiple sub frames to encode and<br>
decode the input frame by the sub frame unit when the input frame is too long,<br>
thereby to increase the efficiency thereof.<br>
As described above, the embodiment of the present invention<br>
disassembles/assembles input frames into sub/super frames of an appropriate length<br>
when the input data frame is very long or short, and then encodes and decodes the<br>
sub/super frames. In this manner, it is possible to reduce the calculations and<br>
memory capacity required in the decoder, while fully securing the performance of<br>
the turbo code encoder.<br>
While the invention has been shown and described with reference to a certain<br>
preferred embodiment thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that"<br>
various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the<br>
spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.<br>
