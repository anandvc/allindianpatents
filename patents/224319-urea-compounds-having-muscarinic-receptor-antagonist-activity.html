UREA COMPOUNDS HAVING MUSCAKIKIC RECEPTOR ANTAGOSIST ACTIVITY<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS:<br>
This appHcalion is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 09/456,170, filed December 7,1999.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A receptor is a biological structure with one or more binding domains that reversJbJy complexes with one or more ligands, where that complexalion has biological consequences.   Receptors can exist entirely outside the cell (extracellular receptors), within the cell membrane (but presenting sections of the receptor to the extracellular milieu and cytosol), or entirely within the cell (intracellular receptors). They may also function independently of a cell (e.g., clot formation). Receptors within the cell membrane allow a cell to communicate with thespaceoutsideof its boundaries (i.e., signaling) as well as to function in the transport of molecules and ions into and out of the cell.<br>
A ligand is a biifding partner for a specific receptor or family of receptors. A ligand may be the endogenous ligand for the receptor or alternatively may be a synthetic ligand for the receptor such as a drug, a drug candidate or a pharmacological tool.<br>
The super family of seven transmembrane proteins {7-rMs), also caUed G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), represents one of the most significant classes of membrane bound receptors that communicate changes that occur outside of the cell's boundaries to its interior, triggering a cellular response when appropriate. The G-proteins, when activated, affect a wide range of downstream effector systems both positively and negatively (e.g., ion channels, protein kinase cascades, transcription, transmigration of adhesion proteins, and the like).<br><br>
Muscarinic receptors are members of the G-prolein coupled receptors that are composed of a family of five receptor sub-types (Mi.M,, M3, M4 and M,) and are activated by the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. These receptors are widely distributed on multiple organs and tissues and are critical to the maintenance of central and peripheral cholinergic neurotransmission. The regional distribution of these receptor subtypes in the brain and other organs has been documented (Bonner, T. I et al.. Science (Washington D.C.) 1987, 237, 527-532; Goyal, R. K., J. Med., 1989, 321, 1022; Hulme, E.G., et al., Annu. Rev. harmacolToxicol 1990, 30, 633; and Eglen, R. M. and Hegde, S. S., Drug News Perspect. 1997, 10(8), 462-469). For example, the smooth muscle is composed largely of Mj and M3 receptors, cardiac muscle is composed largely of Mj receptors, and salivary glands are largely composed of M3 receptors.<br>
It has been established thai the muscarinic receptors are involved in diseases such as chronic obstiuctive pulmonary disease, asthma, irritable bowel syndrome, urinary incontinence, rhinitis, spasmodic colitis, chronic cystitis, and alzheimer,s disease, senile dementia, glaucoma, schizophrenia, gastroesophogeal reflux disease, cardiac arrhythmia, and hyper salvation syndromes (Fisher, A., Invest. Drugs, 1997, 6(10), 1395-1411;Martel, A.M., etal.. Drugs Future, 1997, 22(2), 135-137; Graui, A. and Castaner, J., Dns Future, 1996, 21(11), 1105-1108; and Graul, A., et al.. Drugs Future, 1997, 22(7), 733-737).<br>
A number of compounds having muscarinic receptor antagonistic activities are being used to treat these diseases. For example, oxybutynin is being used for the treatment of urinary urge incontinence and dicyclomine is being used for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. However, these drugs have limited utility as they produce side effects such as dry mouth, blurred vision, and mydriasis.<br>
There is currently a need for novel muscarinic receptor antagonists.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is directed to urea derivatives that are muscarinic receptor intagonists and agonists and that are useful in the treatment and prevention of     1 liseases mediated by muscarinic receptors (e.g. chronic obstmctive pulmonary lisease, chronic bronchitis, irritable bowei syndrome, urinary incontinence, and the ike).<br>
