				<td>COATED BASE BODY OF AN OBJECT AND PROCESS<br>
Technical field<br>
The invention relates to an object base body provided with a coating,<br>
which object base body can be made of metal and is preferably a<br>
kitchen appliance in accordance with the preamble of patent claim 1,<br>
and a process for applying a layer in accordance with the preamble of<br>
patent claim 12.<br>
An object base body in the sense of the invention, which is provided<br>
with a coating, is understood to mean not only kitchen appliances,<br>
such as, in particular, pans and casseroles, but also linings of<br>
ovens, heating plates, e.g. on irons and electric grill plates, panel<br>
heating elements and panel radiators etc. The object base bodies need<br>
not necessarily be used at elevated temperatures; they can also be<br>
used at room temperature or below. At higher temperatures, such as<br>
occur in the kitchen area, metallic base bodies will be used. At low<br>
temperatures, base bodies made of synthetic materials can also be<br>
used. In the case of kitchen appliances with a metallic base body made<br>
of aluminium or steel, use is possible at elevated temperatures, i.e.<br>
temperatures above 100°C up to 300°C, without any problem.<br>
Prior art<br>
Kitchen appliances exhibiting an anti-adhesive effect as coated object<br>
base bodies are known from EP 0 365 485, EP 0 719 594 and EP 1 048<br>
751. In each case, an anti-adhesive layer is applied as the top layer<br>
exhibiting a free surface, that is to say, the layer that in each case<br>
is in contact with the foodstuffs to be fried, boiled or stewed.<br>
To achieve a good adhesion of the entire coating to the base body of<br>
the kitchen appliance, EP 0 365 485 roughens the base body. A ceramic<br>
material, such as an aluminium oxide / titanium oxide powder mixture,<br>
is thermally sprayed onto this roughened and heated surface. In EP 0<br>
719 594, a strip-like application of overlapping strips of a hard-<br>
material layer is described. EP 1 048 751 admixes diamond crystals<br>
into at least one of the layers of the layer package to obtain a hard<br>
coating with good thermal conductivity.<br>
Object of the invention<br>
The object of the invention is to manufacture an object base body, in<br><br>
-2-<br>
particular a kitchen appliance, provided with a coating, in which good<br>
layer bonding is achieved and in which the anti-adhesive effect and<br>
self-cleaning can be improved. In a preferred manner, the layer<br>
composite should maintain its anti-adhesive and self-cleaning property<br>
even at temperatures above 100°C.<br>
Solution of the object<br>
The above-named object is solved in that there is applied on an object<br>
base body, which can be inter alia metallic, a coating, which exhibits<br>
at least one layer, to the layer material of which a fibrous material<br>
is added. The layer material is generally paste-like and is hardened<br>
in a later process step.<br>
Manufacture of layers that contain fibres is known per se. In the<br>
known layers, however, the fibres always lie approximately parallel to<br>
the layer top or bottom side, with individual fibres or weaves being<br>
used. Weaves are used to make sure that no fibres stick out of the<br>
layer surface; i.e. a characteristic of these layers is a smooth<br>
surface. Such layers with smooth surfaces are described in EP 1 238<br>
785, JP 07 255 606 and JP 07 184 785.<br>
Contrary to the teachings of the prior art, the invention is now no<br>
longer looking for a smooth surface; on the contrary, the fibres are<br>
to lie in the layer in such a way that peaks and troughs with spatial<br>
frequency fractions between 3 µm-1 and 1000 µm-1 result.<br>
The fibres can now be added to the layer material before layer<br>
production. The mixture is then applied as a "fibre paste" on the base<br>
body or on one or more layers already present on the base body, and<br>
then hardened. The fractions of fibrous material and layer material<br>
will be chosen in such a way that the fibres form a "felt" and is held<br>
together by layer material hardened later. A rough surface has then<br>
resulted. This rough surface, if it is the free surface of a coating,<br>
that is to say, e.g. in the case of a kitchen appliance, the top<br>
layer, which comes into contact with the item being boiled or fried,<br>
gives rise to an anti-adhesive effect and/or a self-cleaning effect<br>
virtually independently of the layer material. The generation of these<br>
two effects is explained on the basis of Figure 1.<br>
If little layer material is used, the regions of reduced base material<br><br>
-3-<br>
contribute to the roughness. If a relatively large amount of layer<br>
material is used, the roughness is caused primarily by the fibre ends,<br>
which cause the surface to "bulge".<br>
To a certain degree, the roughness achieved for given material<br>
properties of the layer material and of the fibres depends on inter<br>
alia when the fibres are introduced into the layer. If first the<br>
fibres are applied and then the layer material, or the fibres are<br>
added to the layer material before coating, then, due to the surface<br>
tension of the still paste-like layer material, the fibres will always<br>
be coated, if only thinly, with layer material, while the fibre ends<br>
project markedly. If, on the other hand, the fibres are applied on the<br>
paste-like layer material only after it is applied, then the fibres<br>
will sink into the layer material and/or can be pressed into it by<br>
passing over with a spatula, pressing in with a pressure plate etc.,<br>
but fibre ends protruding from the layer surface will always be<br>
present. These protruding fibre ends provide a good meshing effect if<br>
a further layer is applied on this layer. Since, in a preferred<br>
manner, carbon fibres are used, there can, in the top free surface<br>
also, be fibre ends present that protrude beyond this top free<br>
surface; carbon fibres are not hazardous to health. Since the<br>
protruding fibre ends are very short, they will moreover withstand<br>
mechanical loadings without breaking off. Sticking-out fibres<br>
contribute to an increase in the self-cleaning and in the anti-<br>
adhesive effect.<br>
Figure 1 shows on the top left a smooth, horizontal surface 40 of an<br>
object 41, with a liquid drop 42. This liquid drop 42 is generally a<br>
water drop but can, in particular in the case of kitchen appliances,<br>
also be an oil drop or sauce drop. On the smooth surface are several<br>
dirt particles 43. In the case of a water drop 42, the drop has on the<br>
smooth surface 40 a contact angle βg from 40° to 70°. The contact angle<br>
βg is the angle between the smooth surface 40, on which the drop lies,<br>
and a tangent Tg to the drop surface Mg at the contact edge of the drop<br>
42. If the smooth surface 40 is now inclined by an angle a, as shown<br>
on the top right in Figure 1, the drop 42 deforms but continues to<br>
adhere together with the dirt particles 43.<br>
In the case of a rough surface 47, as shown on the bottom left in<br><br>
-4-<br>
Figure 1, the contact angle βr of the tangent Tr to the drop surface Mr<br>
at the contact edge of the drop 42 increases. The contact area of the<br>
drop 42 has decreased, as a result of which the holding force on the<br>
surface 47 has also been decreased. The drop 42 has moreover adopted a<br>
contour that more closely approximates a sphere as compared with the<br>
drop contour on the top left. A further holding force reduction<br>
moreover takes place as a result of the roughness since, in simple<br>
terms, this force can act only at the elevations. If the rough surface<br>
47 is now inclined by the same angle a as in the case of the smooth<br>
surface 40, the water drop will run off, entraining the dirt particles<br>
43 (= self-cleaning effect). In an analogous manner, there will be an<br>
increase in the anti-adhesive effect. An analogous situation also<br>
applies for other drop materials. An item to be fried and cooked or<br>
another item to be heated will moreover no longer contact the surface<br>
over an extended area, as a consequence of which "burning on" is<br>
markedly decreased.<br>
Now the rough surface need not be produced only by the fibre ends that<br>
cause the layer surface to "bulge", and fibres running along the layer<br>
surface also contribute to the roughness. It is necessary only to<br>
produce a textured surface that exhibits spatial frequency fractions<br>
(spatial frequency mix) with a stochastic distribution between 3 µm-1<br>
and 1000 µm-1.<br>
With this anti-adhesive and cleaning effect, what matters is the<br>
spacing of the elevations. Good results are achievable for elevations<br>
with a stochastic spacing between 1 µm and 1000 µm. Since the fibres<br>
used below, preferably as carbon fibres, have a diameter between 2 µm<br>
and 8 µm, in an advantageous manner stochastic fibre spacings between<br>
20 µm and 100 µm are chosen. Spacings in this range yield a fibre<br>
quantity that is easy to handle and can be added easily to the layer<br>
material.<br>
Fibres of equal length, the fibre length of which is greater than the<br>
layer thickness, can also be used. Fibres deviating substantially from<br>
the perpendicular (to the mean layer level) will contribute something<br>
to the strength of the layer but nothing to the anti-adhesive and<br>
cleaning effect if the fibres are enclosed in layer material.<br><br>
-5-<br>
A regular distribution of the fibres can also be produced by aligning<br>
them. Alignment can be effected by, for example, vibrating (e.g. with<br>
an ultrasound source). Non-conducting fibres can be aligned by means<br>
of, for example, direct and alternating electric fields, and<br>
ferromagnetic fibres by means of magnetic fields. Fibre alignment is,<br>
however, costly; good anti-adhesive, self-cleaning and meshing effects<br>
have, however, been achieved with a significantly less expensive<br>
stochastic distribution.<br>
If the rough, i.e. uneven, layer top side exhibiting the spatial<br>
frequency fractions is no longer the top free surface but is within a<br>
coating with two or more layers, meshing with the following layer is<br>
obtained. Meshing with the layer below can also take place, if the<br>
layer below is softened when the covering layer is applied and the<br>
fibre ends then enter into that layer also. The fibres introduced into<br>
the layer material lie in a stochastically random orientation. Some<br>
fibre ends would thus penetrate the layer surface if a surface tension<br>
does not pull the layer material over the fibre ends. The force of the<br>
surface tension moreover tries to pull the fibres into the layer<br>
again. In order now that a sufficient unevenness can result contrary<br>
to the pulling-in as a result of the surface tension, fibres should be<br>
present that are longer than the layer thickness to be produced. These<br>
also are stochastically distributed; however, there are always some<br>
present that also lie approximately in the direction of the surface<br>
vector, i.e. about perpendicular to the mean layer level to be<br>
produced. For production of this uneven surface, at least twenty<br>
percent by weight of the fibres should exhibit a fibre length that is<br>
at least five percent longer than the layer thickness. The maximum<br>
fibre length is given by the layer thicknesses specified below and a<br>
maximum elevation in the layer thickness profile caused by the fibres,<br>
less a material covering due to the surface tension. The surface<br>
tension of the layer material in question can be obtained from the<br>
data sheets or determined in a simple manner experimentally.<br>
As a covering layer, preferably an anti-adhesive layer material, such<br>
as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), perfluoroalkoxy (PFA), fluorinated<br>
ethylene propylene (FEP) or analogous materials, is used, an increased<br>
resistance to scratching being provided as a result of the embedded<br>
fibres, and a self-cleaning effect being caused and an anti-adhesive<br>
effect being reinforced as a result of the roughening of the surface<br><br>
-6-<br>
produced by the fibres. Preferably, diamonds are embedded in the<br>
covering layer to support the mechanical hardness.<br>
Various coatings can be used, depending on specific quality<br>
requirements.<br>
Proceeding from the surface of the base body, four proven, different<br>
coatings are proposed; other coatings are of course usable:<br>
I.	Hard-material layer - adhesion-promoting layer - intermediate layer<br>
- anti-adhesive layer<br>
II.	Hard-material layer - adhesion-promoting layer - anti-adhesive<br>
layer<br>
III.	Adhesion-promoting layer - intermediate layer - anti-adhesive<br>
layer<br>
IV.	Adhesion-promoting layer - anti-adhesive layer<br>
The thicknesses of the individual layers should be chosen in such a<br>
way that, as far as possible, a self-contained layer is formed on<br>
application and that the layer is not too thick, in order to keep the<br>
use of material within limits, to prevent a time for hardening from<br>
increasing unnecessarily, and to guarantee an appropriate adhesiveness<br>
and stability. 5 µm to 150 µm have proven themselves as layer<br>
thicknesses.<br>
The admixed fibres should, as already set out above, produce an uneven<br>
surface that can also mesh with a layer to be applied subsequently. To<br>
obtain good meshing, a self-cleaning effect or a reinforcement of the<br>
anti-adhesive effect, fibres are used that exhibit a length, that<br>
produce spatial frequency fractions with peaks and troughs in the<br>
surface profile of a fibre-bearing layer that lie, stochastically<br>
distributed, 0.1 µm to 500 µm above a mean flat surface profile. These<br>
peaks have preferably a mutual stochastic spacing between 50 nm and<br>
500 µm.<br>
The fibres are added to the layer material, in which they are<br><br>
-7-<br>
contained and produce a surface with the above-specified spatial<br>
frequency fractions, before, after or during the application. The<br>
application of the layer takes place in a horizontal orientation of<br>
the layer to be coated or of the base body. Since the layer material<br>
is preferably paste-like, it has a certain viscosity η.<br>
The viscosity η is given in Pas (pascal seconds = Nsm-2 = kg/ms) . The<br>
higher the value for η, the more viscous the material. Now, how<br>
markedly the surface is profiled by fibres contained in a layer<br>
material in the case of a horizontal orientation depends<br>
substantially:<br>
on the fibre thickness,<br>
	on the fibre density, and<br>
	on the viscosity referred to the specific weight of the<br>
paste-like layer material, that is to say, the kinematic<br>
viscosity, and<br>
	on the surface tension of the layer material.<br>
The viscosity and thus also the surface tension are generally<br>
temperature-dependent; i.e. viscosity and surface tension will<br>
generally change during a hardening process of the layer. Since the<br>
"sinking-in" ("oozing-in") of the layer material as a consequence of<br>
the viscosity present is time-dependent, the period until hardening of<br>
the layer should also be taken into account for the spatial frequency<br>
fractions to be achieved. Fibre density and dimensions of the fibres<br>
will therefore be determined experimentally, with reference to the<br>
layer material to be used, as a function of the process parameters<br>
(hardening).<br>
In order that the layer material exhibiting the fibre material<br>
contains no gas bubbles, the object base body (e.g. kitchen appliance)<br>
just provided with the fibre-containing layer can be exposed to a<br>
reduced ambient pressure to outgas the layer. Mechanical vibration<br>
frequencies can also be used to that end. It should, however, be noted<br>
in that case that a pressure reduction and any imposed vibration in<br>
the still unhardened layer state can change the spatial frequency<br><br>
-8-<br>
fractions (spatial frequency mix) or the "amplitude" (peaks and<br>
troughs of the surface profiles). This influence also can be<br>
determined with a few simple expertly performed experiments.<br>
Various fibres can be used. However, when a fibre is being selected,<br>
it should be ensured that the fibrous material meets requirements<br>
relating to use with foodstuffs, as required in the case of kitchen<br>
appliances, since the fibres are used in a layer of a coating of a<br>
kitchen appliance. Good results have been achieved with carbon fibres<br>
as a fibrous material. Carbon fibres have an excellent stability, and<br>
buckling stability in particular. Furthermore, carbon fibres are<br>
light, and they contain tensides, so that they guarantee good<br>
embedding in the layer material.<br>
Of course, instead of (carbon) fibres, so-called (carbon) tubes can<br>
also be used.<br>
From the following detailed description and the entirety of the patent<br>
claims there emerge further advantageous embodiments and combinations<br>
of features of the invention.<br>
Brief description of the drawings<br>
The drawings used for explaining the exemplary embodiments of the<br>
invention show, in<br>
Fig. 1, a schematic representation of a liquid drop on a flat,<br>
smooth surface and a rough surface, these surfaces having one<br>
time a horizontal orientation and another time a same orientation<br>
inclined by an angle α with respect to the horizontal,<br>

a kitchen appliance, on which a coating lies, the coating having<br>

on the base body, and an anti-adhesive layer lying on the<br>
adhesion-promoting layer, and<br>
Fig. 3, a variant of a coated kitchen appliance analogous to<br>
Figure 2 with a coating that exhibits a hard layer, an adhesion-<br>
promoting layer, an intermediate layer and an anti-adhesive<br>
layer.<br><br>
-9-<br>
Ways of implementing the invention<br>
In Figure 2, a coated kitchen appliance 1 (object base body) is<br>
represented in cross-section. The kitchen appliance 1 can be a pan, a<br>
pot, a baking tray, a casserole or also an iron, a heating plate of an<br>
ironing machine etc.<br>
The kitchen appliance 1 has a roughened base body 3, on which a<br>
coating 5 is applied, which has a good adhesiveness on the surface of<br>
the base body and the free surface of which has an anti-adhesive<br>
effect. The basic body is generally made of an aluminium alloy or<br>
steel; other metals are, however, possible.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the coating consists of at least one<br>
layer, and here of two layers, namely an adhesion-promoting layer 7<br>
and an anti-adhesive layer 9. Embedded in the adhesion-promoting layer<br>
7 are fibres 11. The fibres 11 have different lengths and a different<br>
orientation within the adhesion-promoting layer 7. The length of the<br>
fibres 11 is, however, chosen in such a way that at least twenty<br>
percent of the fibres 11 have a length that is longer, by at least<br>
five percent, than the mean layer thickness dhv to be produced of the<br>
adhesion-promoting layer 7. Carbon fibres are used as fibres 11 here.<br>
Carbon fibres have the advantage of great stability and "food-<br>
fastness". The thickness dhv of the adhesion-promoting layer 7 is<br>
typically between 5 µm and 50 µm and has been chosen here as, for<br>
example, 40 µm. The fibres 11 typically have a length between 20 µm<br>
and 100 µm.<br>
As a material for an adhesion-promoting layer 7, a product with the<br>
code 7131 from the Whitford company or a material with the code 459-<br>
415 of the DuPont company, for example, can be considered. In the two<br>
exemplary materials, ceramic particles, e.g. made from aluminium<br>
dioxide (Al2O3) , with a diameter from 5 µm to 40 µm can be added.<br>
On the adhesion-promoting layer 7 lies an anti-adhesive layer 9 with a<br>
mean layer thickness dA of 7 µm. Analogously to the adhesion-promoting<br>
layer 7, the anti-adhesive layer 9 also contains fibres 11. The fibres<br>
11 were here chosen, for example, to be the same in both layers for<br>
the sake of simplicity in manufacture. However, fibres of different<br><br>
-10-<br>
thicknesses and of different fibrous materials can be used in the<br>
layers. The fibre lengths depend on the layer thickness to be<br>
achieved. As a material of the anti-adhesive layer 9, a material with<br>
the code 7333 from Whitford or with the code 456-401 from DuPont, for<br>
example, can be used. Other similar materials can of course also be<br>
used.<br>
Instead of a coating 5 with an adhesion-promoting layer directly on<br>
the surface of the base body 3 and an anti-adhesive layer 9 as a<br>
covering layer on the adhesion-promoting layer 7, a coating 21 with a<br>
hard layer 25, an adhesion-promoting layer 27, an intermediate layer<br>
29 and an anti-adhesive layer 31 can also exist. Coatings in which the<br>
intermediate layer and also the hard-material layer are not present<br>
can also be applied on the base body. The intermediate layer 29 is<br>
generally a corrosion-inhibiting layer.<br>
The coated kitchen appliance 20 represented in Figure 3 likewise has,<br>
analogously to the kitchen appliance 1 represented in Figure 2, a<br>
coating, denoted here by 21, which is arranged on the surface 23 of a<br>
roughened base body 24. Unlike the two layers 7 and 9 of the coating<br>
5, the coating 21 here has four layers, namely a hard layer 25 lying<br>
on the base body 24, then an adhesion-promoting layer 27, then an<br>
intermediate layer 29 and finally an anti-adhesive layer 31.<br>
The hard-material layer 25 is applied by a thermal spraying process<br>
and here consists of, for example, a mixture of one hundred to sixty<br>
percent by weight of aluminium oxide (Al2O3) and zero to forty percent<br>
by weight of titanium dioxide (TiO2) . Such hard layers are described<br>
in, for example, EP 1 048 751. Instead of aluminium oxide and titanium<br>
dioxide as the material of the hard layer 25, other ceramic oxides,<br>
nitrides, carbides, oxynitrides or carbo-oxynitrides of one or more<br>
elements from the chemical groups IVb to VIb, of aluminium, of nickel,<br>
of silicon and mixtures thereof can also be used. Group IVb includes<br>
titanium (Ti), zirconium (Zr) and hafnium (Hf) . Group Vb includes<br>
vanadium (V) , niobium (Nb) and tantalum (Ta) . Group VIb includes<br>
chromium (Cr), molybdenum (Mo) and tungsten (W).<br>
The adhesion-promoting layer 27 and the anti-adhesive layer 31 are<br>
formed analogously to the adhesion-promoting layer 7 and the anti-<br><br>
-11-<br>
adhesive layer 9.<br>
As an intermediate layer, a material with the code 7232 from the<br>
Whitford company or with the code 456-605 from the DuPont company, for<br>
example, can be used.<br>
Fibres, in particular carbon fibres, can now be contained, in<br>
accordance with above prescriptions, in all the layers 25, 27, 29 and<br>
31 or only in individual layers.<br>
Carbon fibres are dark. A layer with embedded carbon fibres will thus<br>
always exhibit a grey to dark colour, the embedded fibres causing an<br>
iridescent optical effect if the layer material is transparent or<br>
diffusive. If this iridescent effect is to be prevented, the layer in<br>
question will be coloured with a dark pigment. This colouring with a<br>
dark pigment has moreover the advantage that layer damage, generally<br>
to the anti-adhesive layer, that does not disturb the anti-adhesive<br>
effect of the anti-adhesive layer is hardly visible.<br>
A coating process of the kitchen appliance 1 or 20 is described on the<br>
basis of the production of a four-layer coating 21. This coating 21<br>
contains all the layers explained above. If coatings with fewer layers<br>
are to be manufactured, the appropriate process steps should be<br>
omitted.<br>
In a first process step, the base body 24 of the kitchen appliance 20,<br>
e.g. a bottom of a pan, is pretreated for the coating now to be<br>
carried out. For this, the surface is degreased and sandblasted with<br>
corundum powder. The corundum powder has fine grains with which coarse<br>
grains are admixed. The coarse grains produce a roughness of about one<br>
hundred to two hundred micrometres on the surface to be coated. A fine<br>
roughness of about ten to thirty micrometers is superposed on this<br>
coarsely roughened surface texture by the finer grains.<br>
For production of the hard layer 25, after the roughening, the entire<br>
kitchen appliance (e.g. a pan, without the handle and other fittings<br>
of course) is brought to a temperature below 600◦C in a kiln.<br>
Preferably a temperature from 300°C to 450°C is chosen. Immediately<br>
after this temperature is reached, a mixture with 100 to 60 percent by<br><br>
-12-<br>
weight of aluminium oxide (Al2O3) and 0 to 40 percent by weight of<br>
titanium dioxide (TiO2) is applied. For example, about sixty percent by<br>
weight of aluminium oxide and forty percent by weight of titanium<br>
dioxide are applied here as a homogeneous mixture with admixed carbon<br>
fibres 11 in a plasma spraying process as a thermal spraying process.<br>
The applied hard layer 25 looks black.<br>
The carbon fibres also can contain diamond crystals, which increase<br>
their hardness and also their thermal conductivity.<br>
In simple terms, the aluminium oxide, as a relatively inexpensive<br>
material, gives the hard layer 25 the necessary hardness, while<br>
titanium dioxide, together with the carbon fibres 11, gives this hard<br>
layer 25 the ductility and the dark or black colour. As a result of<br>
the ductility of the titanium dioxide, a good resistance of the<br>
coating to large temperature fluctuations, as occur in frying pans, is<br>
provided. The carbon fibres 11 produce an uneven top side of the hard<br>
layer 25 and engage with the uneven top side of the base body 24 that<br>
resulted from the roughening.<br>
After the spraying-on of the hard layer 25, the kitchen appliance is<br>
allowed to cool down. The adhesion-promoting layer 27 is applied on<br>
the hard layer 25. The layer material is present as a suspension. The<br>
above-mentioned fibres 11 and also a dark pigment can be admixed with<br>
this suspension. A layer thickness of several micrometres is applied.<br>
This suspension enters into the roughness and the pores of the hard<br>
layer 25. Subsequently, the kitchen appliance is heated in a kiln in<br>
several stages (100°C, 250°C, 400°C) to 400°C to 430°C and maintained<br>
at the final temperature for about ten to fifteen minutes.<br>
In an analogous process, the intermediate layer 29 is subsequently<br>
applied.<br>
As an anti-adhesive covering layer 31, one to three layers of a<br>
fluoropolymer, preferably PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene), are applied<br>
as a suspension after the kitchen appliance has cooled down to room<br>
temperature. This suspension likewise enters into a still remaining<br>
roughness and into the pores. After the application, a heating<br>
programme analogous to that of the layer 27 is run. As a result of the<br><br>
-13-<br>
fact that here also the final temperature is maintained for ten to<br>
fifteen minutes, baking of the PTFE takes place. The softening<br>
temperature of the PTFE is around 360°C. The temperature of the object<br>
is thus significantly above this temperature during baking, so that<br>
the suspension particles are sintered to form a tough, elastic layer.<br>
As a result of the sintering, an elastic PTFE covering layer 31 is<br>
formed, which, with a layer thickness of two to ten micrometres,<br>
conforms well to the remaining roughness of the intermediate layer 29<br>
below.<br>
In the kitchen appliance with finished coating, preferably the<br>
outermost, free surface will be subjected to a brushing process. In<br>
this brushing, fibre ends projecting too far are removed in order that<br>
these ends do not break off only on typical usage. The broken-off<br>
fibre parts are harmless to health but, when the pan is used new,<br>
could, on close inspection, leave traces on a light-coloured item<br>
being fried. A brush is used the brush hardness of which does not<br>
scratch the coating surface but breaks off fibre ends projecting too<br>
far. Fibre ends projecting too far are understood to mean fibre ends<br>
that would break off on use of a soft spatula as is used in the case<br>
of anti-adhesive-coated kitchen appliances.<br>
Surfaces of irons, pots, surfaces of machine parts such as bearing<br>
shells, ... can, instead of frying pans as kitchen appliances, also be<br>
coated with the above-described coatings.<br>
Instead of applying the adhesion-promoting layer 27, intermediate<br>
layer 29 and the anti-adhesive layer 31, which each are present as<br>
suspensions, as individual layers and heating them in stages, the<br>
adhesion-promoting layer 27, the intermediate layer 29 and then the<br>
anti-adhesive layer 31 can be applied one after the other after<br>
surface drying only. These layers 27, 29 and 31 can then be heated<br>
together, as described above, in stages or in an approximately<br>
continuously increasing manner.<br>
As a layer material in which the fibres can lie, a hard material with<br>
an anti-adhesive effect can also be used. In that case, after<br>
roughening of the kitchen appliance bottom to be coated, the entire<br>
object (e.g. pan) is brought to a temperature below 600°C in a kiln.<br><br>
-14-<br>
Preferably a temperature of 450°C is chosen. Immediately after this<br>
temperature is reached, a mixture with 80 to 40 percent by weight of<br>
aluminium oxide (Al2O3) and 20 to 60 percent by weight of titanium<br>
dioxide (TiO2) is applied. For example, approximately sixty percent by<br>
weight of aluminium oxide and forty percent by weight of titanium<br>
dioxide with an admixture of five to ten percent by weight of<br>
aluminium fluoride (AlF3) are applied here as a homogeneous mixture in<br>
a plasma spraying process as a thermal spraying process. The admixed<br>
aluminium fluoride produces an anti-adhesive effect in the hard layer<br>
7. The use of aluminium fluoride is not obligatory; other materials<br>
with an anti-adhesive effect can also be used. However, compatibility<br>
with the aluminium oxide / titanium dioxide mixture should be ensured.<br>
The material used must also survive under the thermal conditions of<br>
the plasma spraying. In the plasma spraying, diamond crystals are<br>
admixed that have a diameter between 0.5 µm and 10 µm. The aluminium<br>
oxide / titanium dioxide / aluminium fluoride mixture with embedded<br>
diamond crystals is sprayed to a layer thickness of 50 µm to 150 µm<br>
onto the surface 5. The applied layer can look black.<br>
The admixing of the diamond crystals should take place in such a way<br>
that they are not exposed to a temperature above 900°C. At 900°<br>
diamond can turn into graphite or burn in the event of oxygen access.<br>
The temperature should be kept sufficiently remote from this 900°C.<br>
Admixed diamond crystals improve the thermal conductivity, improve<br>
abrasion properties and improve a compatibility of the materials,<br>
since they are carbon.<br>
In simple terms, the aluminium oxide, as a relatively inexpensive<br>
material, gives the layer 7 the necessary hardness, while titanium<br>
dioxide gives this layer 7 the ductility and the dark or black colour.<br>
As a result of the ductility of the titanium dioxide, a good<br>
resistance of the coating to large temperature fluctuations, as<br>
occurring in frying pans, is provided.<br><br>
