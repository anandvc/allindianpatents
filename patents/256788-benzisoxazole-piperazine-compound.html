FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to methods for treating sleep disorders and compositions useful in<br>
such methods.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Difficulty falling asleep or remaining asleep is a significant medical issue that arises for<br>
a variety of reasons. Sometimes, these problems arise from endogenous conditions such as<br>
sleep apnea or insomnia. Other times, these problems arise from exogenous stresses such as<br>
the disruptive effect of shift work schedules and "jet lag." Whether caused by an endogenous<br>
or exogenous source, difficulty falling asleep or remaining asleep can result in problem<br>
sleepiness, which impairs the health, quality of life, and safety of those affected.<br>
Existing pharmaceutical treatments for inducing sleep include sedatives or hypnotics<br>
such as benzodiazepine and barbiturate derivatives. These treatments have numerous<br>
drawbacks, including rebound insomnia, delayed onset of desired sedative effects, persistence<br>
of sedative effects after the desired sleep period, and side effects due to nonspecific activity<br>
such as psychomotor and memory deficits, myorelaxation, and disturbed sleep architecture,<br>
including REM sleep inhibition. Additionally, sedatives and hypnotics can be habit forming,<br>
can lose their effectiveness after extended use, and may be metabolized more slowly by some<br>
people.<br>
Consequently, physicians often recommend or prescribe antihistamines as a milder<br>
treatment for sleep disorders when hypnotics are less appropriate. However, many<br>
antihistamines suffer from a number of side effects. These side effects include prolongation of<br>
the QT interval in a subject's electrocardiogram, as well as central nervous system (CNS) side<br>
effects such as decreased muscle tone and drooping eyelids. Finally, such compounds can bind<br>
to muscarinic receptors, which leads to anti-cholinergic side effects such as blurred vision, dry<br>
mouth, constipation, urinary problems, dizziness and anxiety.<br>
As a result, there is a need for sleep-promoting treatments with reduced side effects.<br>
Additionally, while known sleep-inducing compounds are effective for treating sleep-onset<br><br>
insomnia, i.e., a subject's difficulty in falling asleep, there are no drugs currently indicated for<br>
treating sleep maintenance insomnia, i.e., maintaining a subject's sleep throughout a normal<br>
sleep period after falling asleep. Therefore, there is also a need for improved pharmaceutical<br>
treatments for maintaining sleep in subjects in need of such treatment.<br>

thereof. "Functional equivalents" of anionic groups are intended to include bioisosteres, e.g,<br>
bioisosteres of a carboxylate group. Bioisosteres encompass both classical bioisosteric<br>
equivalents and non-classical bioisosteric equivalents. Classical and non-classical bioisosteres<br>
are known in the art (see, e.g., Silverman, R. B. The Organic Chemistry of Drug Design and<br>
Drug Action, Academic Press, Inc.: San Diego, Calif., 1992, pp.19-23). Another anionic group<br>
is a carboxylate.<br>
The term "unstable functionality" refers to a substitution pattern that contains a labile<br>

unstable functionalities include acetals and ketals.<br>
The terms "crystal polymorphs" or "polymorphs" refer to the existence of more than<br>
one crystal form for a compound, salt or solvate thereof. Crystal polymorphs of the<br>

Additionally, the compounds of the present invention, for example, the salts of the<br>
compounds, can exist in either hydrated or unhydrated (the anhydrous) form or as solvates with<br>
other solvent molecules. Nonlimiting examples of hydrates include monohydrates, dihydrates,<br>
etc. Nonlimiting examples of solvates include ethanol solvates, acetone solvates, etc.<br>
"Tautomers" refers to compounds whose structures differ markedly in arrangement of<br>
atoms, but which exist in easy and rapid equilibrium. It is to be understood that compounds of<br>
Formulae I-IVd may be depicted as different tautomers. It should also be understood that<br>
when compounds have tautomeric forms, all tautomeric forms are intended to be within the<br>
scope of the invention, and the naming of the compounds does not exclude any tautomer form.<br><br>
Some compounds of the present invention can exist in a tautomeric form which are also<br>
intended to be encompassed within the scope of the present invention.<br>
The compounds, salts and prodrugs of the present invention can exist in several<br>
tautomeric forms, including the enol and imine form, and the keto and enamine form and<br>
geometric isomers and mixtures thereof. All such tautomeric forms are included within the<br>
scope of the present invention. Tautomers exist as mixtures of a tautomeric set in solution. In<br>
solid form, usually one tautomer predominates. Even though one tautomer may be described,<br>
the present invention includes all tautomers of the present compounds<br>
A tautomer is one of two or more structural isomers that exist in equilibrium and are<br>
readily converted from one isomeric form to another. This reaction results in the formal<br>
migration of a hydrogen atom accompanied by a switch of adjacent conjugated double bonds.<br>
In solutions where tautomerization is possible, a chemical equilibrium of the tautomers will be<br>
reached. The exact ratio of the tautomers depends on several factors, including temperature,<br>
solvent, and pH. The concept of tautomers that are interconvertable by tautomerizations is<br>
called tautomerism.<br>
Of the various types of tautomerism that are possible, two are commonly observed. In<br>
keto-enol tautomerism a simultaneous shift of electrons and a hydrogen atom occurs. Ring-<br>
chain tautomerism, is exhibited by glucose. It arises as a result of the aldehyde group (-CHO)<br>
in a sugar chain molecule reacting with one of the hydroxy groups (-OH) in the same molecule<br>
to give it a cyclic (ring-shaped) form.<br>
Tautomerizations are catalyzed by: Base: 1. deprotonation; 2. formation of a<br>
delocalized anion (e.g., an enolate); 3. protonation at a different position of the anion; Acid: 1.<br>
protonation; 2. formation of a delocalized cation; 3. deprotonation at a different position<br>
adjacent to the cation.<br>
Common tautomeric pairs are: ketone - enol, amide - nitrile, lactam - lactim, amide -<br>
imidic acid tautomerism in heterocyclic rings (e.g., in the nucleobases guanine, thymine, and<br>
cytosine), amine - enamine and enamine - enamine. Examples include:<br><br><br>
"Solvates" means solvent addition forms that contain either stoichiometric or non<br>
stoichiometric amounts of solvent. Some compounds have a tendency to trap a fixed molar<br>
ratio of solvent molecules in the crystalline solid state, thus forming a solvate. If the solvent is<br>
water the solvate formed is a hydrate, when the solvent is alcohol, the solvate formed is an<br>
alcoholate. Hydrates are formed by the combination of one or more molecules of water with<br>
one of the substances in which the water retains its molecular state as H2O, such combination<br>
being able to form one or more hydrate.<br>
It will be noted that the structure of some of the compounds of the invention include<br>
asymmetric carbon atoms. It is to be understood accordingly that the isomers arising from<br>
such asymmetry (e.g., all enantiomers and diastereomers) are included within the scope of the<br>
invention, unless indicated otherwise. Such isomers can be obtained in substantially pure form<br>
by classical separation techniques and by stereochemically controlled synthesis. Furthermore,<br>
the structures and other compounds and moieties discussed in this application also include all<br>
tautomers thereof. Alkenes can include either the E- or Z-geometry, where appropriate.<br>
Further, the structures and other compounds discussed in this application include all<br>
atropic isomers thereof. Atropic isomers are a type of stereoisomer in which the atoms of two<br>
isomers are arranged differently in space. Atropic isomers owe their existence to a restricted<br>
rotation caused by hindrance of rotation of large groups about a central bond. Such atropic<br>
isomers typically exist as a mixture, however as a result of recent advances in chromatography<br>
techniques, it has been possible to separate mixtures of two atropic isomers in select cases.<br>
"Stable compound" and "stable structure" are meant to indicate a compound that is<br>
sufficiently robust to survive isolation to a useful degree of purity from a reaction mixture, and<br>
formulation into an efficacious therapeutic agent.<br>
The language benzisoxazole compounds or "benzisoxazole -analog compounds"<br>
"benzisoxazole -like compounds" or "benzisoxazole derivative compounds" is intended to<br><br>
include analogs of benzisoxazole or compounds that include a benzene ring linked to an<br>
isozazole, (i.e., similar to that of benzisoxazole) linked to position 4 of a piperazine ring.<br>
As used herein, the term "analog" refers to a chemical compound that is structurally<br>
similar to another but differs slightly in composition (as in the replacement of one atom by an<br>
atom of a different element or in the presence of a particular functional group, or the<br>
replacement of one functional group by another functional group). Thus, an analog is a<br>
compound that is similar or comparable in function and appearance, but not in structure or<br>
origin to the reference compound. For example, the reference compound can be a<br>
reference compound such as benzisoxazole, and an analog is a substance possessing a chemical<br>
structure or chemical properties similar to those of the reference benzisoxazole.<br>
As defined herein, the term "derivative", e.g., in the term "benzisoxazole derivatives",<br>
refers to compounds that have a common core structure, and are substituted with various<br>
groups as described herein. For example, all of the compounds represented by formulae I-IVd<br>
are benzisoxazole derivatives, and have one of formulae I-IVd as a common core.<br>
The term "bioisostere" refers to a compound resulting from the exchange of an atom or<br>
of a group of atoms with another, broadly similar, atom or group of atoms. The objective of a<br>
bioisosteric replacement is to create a new compound with similar biological properties to the<br>
parent compound. The bioisosteric replacement may be physicochemically or topologically<br>
based. Examples of carboxylic acid bioisosteres include acyl sulfonimides, tetrazoles,<br>
sulfonates, and phosphonates. See, e.g., Patani and LaVoie, Chem. Rev. 96, 3147-3176 (1996).<br>
In some embodiments, Z is a carboxylic acid or a carboxylic acid bioisostere.<br>
As used herein, the term "sleep disorder" includes conditions recognized by one skilled<br>
in the art as sleep disorders, for example, conditions known in the art or conditions that are<br>
proposed to be sleep disorders or discovered to be sleep disorders. A sleep disorder also arises<br>
in a subject that has other medical disorders, diseases, or injuries, or in a subject being treated<br>
with other medications or medical treatments, where the subject, as a result, has difficulty<br>
falling asleep and/or remaining asleep, or experiences unrefreshing sleep, e.g., the subject<br>
experiences sleep deprivation.<br>
The term "treating a sleep disorder" also includes treating a sleep disorder component<br>
of other disorders, such as CNS disorders (e.g., mental or neurological disorders such as<br>
anxiety). Additionally, the term "treating a sleep disorder" includes the beneficial effect of<br>
ameliorating other symptoms associated with the disorder.<br>
The term "nonREM peak sleep time" is defined as an absolute peak amount of<br>
nonREM sleep per hour post treatment, with drug administration occurring at Circadian Time<br><br>
(CT) 18, which is 6 hours after lights off in a nocturnal laboratory rat when housed in a LD<br>
12:12 (12-hours light and 12 hours dark) light-dark cycle. The nominal criteria of 55%<br>
nonREM sleep per hour is equivalent to 33 minutes of nonREM sleep per hour.<br>
As used herein, the term "cumulative nonREM sleep" is defined as the net total<br>
aggregate increase in the number of minutes of nonREM sleep, measured through out the<br>
entire duration of a drug's soporific effect, which typically, but not always occurs in the first 6<br>
hours post-treatment, adjusted for the net total aggregate number of minutes of nonREM sleep<br>
that occurred during the corresponding non-treatment baseline times of day recorded 24 hours<br>
earlier, relative to like vehicle control treatment.<br>
As defined herein, the term "sleep bout" refers to a discrete episode of continuous or<br>
near continuous sleep, comprised of nonREM sleep, REM sleep, or both nonREM and REM<br>
sleep stages, delimited prior and after the episode by greater than two contiguous 10 second<br>
epochs of wakefulness.<br>
As used herein, the term "sleep promotion" is defined as a decrease in the latency to<br>
sleep onset as is often, but not exclusively, measured by the Multiple Sleep Latency Test, or a<br>
decrease in the latency to return to sleep after awakening, or reduces the tendency to awaken or<br>
remain awake either spontaneously or as a response to wake-promoting ambient stimuli (e.g.,<br>
noise, vibration, odor, pain, light). In general, a sleep promoting drug shortens the latency to<br>
sleep onset at desired bed time, or shortens the latency to return to sleep after night-time<br>
awakening, or may increase night-time total sleep time. A compound exhibiting these<br>
properties is said to promote sleep.<br>
As used herein, the term "sleep consolidation" is defined as the ability to remain asleep<br>
or otherwise demonstrate persistent sleep after sleep onset, and throughout the desired sleep<br>
period, with little or no intervening wakefulness, as objectively measured by the number of<br>
night-time awakenings, sleep efficiency (number of awakenings per amount of time in bed), or<br>
number of transient arousals. In general, a sleep consolidating drug improves the ability to<br>
remain asleep by increasing the duration of continuous sleep between spontaneous episodes of<br>
wakefulness. A compound exhibiting these properties is said to consolidate sleep.<br>
Compared with NREM sleep or wakefulness, REM sleep causes ventilatory depression<br>
and episodic cardiovascular changes. During rebound insomnia, the physiological effects of<br>
REM sleep are magnified and interrupt the normal sleep cycles.<br>
As defined herein, "disproportionate locomotor activity inhibition" is a reduction of<br>
locomotor activity that exceeds the normal and expected reduction in behavioral activity<br>
attributable to sleep.<br><br>
"Combination therapy" (or "co-therapy") includes the administration of a compound of<br>
the invention and at least a second agent as part of a specific treatment regimen intended to<br>
provide the beneficial effect from the co-action of these therapeutic agents. The beneficial<br>
effect of the combination includes, but is not limited to, pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic<br>
co-action resulting from the combination of therapeutic agents. Administration of these<br>
therapeutic agents in combination typically is carried out over a defined time period (usually<br>
minutes, hours, days or weeks depending upon the combination selected). "Combination<br>
therapy" may, but generally is not, intended to encompass the administration of two or more of<br>
these therapeutic agents as part of separate monotherapy regimens that incidentally and<br>
arbitrarily result in the combinations of the present invention. "Combination therapy" is<br>
intended to embrace administration of these therapeutic agents in a sequential manner, that is,<br>
wherein each therapeutic agent is administered at a different time, as well as administration of<br>
these therapeutic agents, or at least two of the therapeutic agents, in a substantially<br>
simultaneous manner. Substantially simultaneous administration can be accomplished, for<br>
example, by administering to the subject a single capsule having a fixed ratio of each<br>
therapeutic agent or in multiple, single capsules for each of the therapeutic agents. Sequential<br>
or substantially simultaneous administration of each therapeutic agent can be effected by any<br>
appropriate route including, but not limited to, oral routes, intravenous routes, intramuscular<br>
routes, and direct absorption through mucous membrane tissues. The therapeutic agents can be<br>
administered by the same route or by different routes. For example, a first therapeutic agent of<br>
the combination selected may be administered by intravenous injection while the other<br>
therapeutic agents of the combination may be administered orally. Alternatively, for example,<br>
all therapeutic agents may be administered orally or all therapeutic agents may be administered<br>
by intravenous injection. The sequence in which the therapeutic agents are administered is not<br>
narrowly critical.<br>
"Combination therapy" also embraces the administration of the therapeutic agents as<br>
described above in further combination with other biologically active ingredients and non-drug<br>
therapies (e.g., surgery or mechanical treatments). Where the combination therapy further<br>
comprises a non-drug treatment, the non-drug treatment may be conducted at any suitable time<br>
so long as a beneficial effect from the co-action of the combination of the therapeutic agents<br>
and non-drug treatment is achieved. For example, in appropriate cases, the beneficial effect is<br>
still achieved when the non-drug treatment is temporally removed from the administration of<br>
the therapeutic agents, perhaps by days or even weeks.<br><br>
The terms "parenteral administration" and "administered parenterally" as used herein<br>
refer to modes of administration other than enteral and topical administration, usually by<br>
injection, and includes, without limitation, intravenous, intramuscular, intra-arterial,<br>
intrathecal, intracapsular, intraorbital, intracardiac, intradermal, intraperitoneal, transtracheal,<br>
subcutaneous, subcuticular, intraarticular, subcapsular, subarachnoid, intraspinal and<br>
intrasternal injection and infusion.<br>
The term "pulmonary" as used herein refers to any part, tissue or organ whose primary<br>
function is gas exchange with the external environment, e.g., O2/CO2 exchange, within a<br>
patient. "Pulmonary" typically refers to the tissues of the respiratory tract. Thus, the phrase<br>
"pulmonary administration" refers to administering the formulations described herein to any<br>
part, tissue or organ whose primary function is gas exchange with the external environment<br>
(e.g., mouth, nose, pharynx, oropharynx, laryngopharynx, larynx, trachea, carina, bronchi,<br>
bronchioles, alveoli). For purposes of the present invention, "pulmonary" also includes a<br>
tissue or cavity that is contingent to the respiratory tract, in particular, the sinuses.<br>
An "effective amount" of a compound of the disclosed invention is the quantity which,<br>
when administered to a subject in need of treatment, ameliorates symptoms arising from a<br>
sleep disorder, e.g., results in the subject falling asleep more rapidly, results in more refreshing<br>
sleep, reduces duration or frequency of waking during a sleep period, or reduces the duration,<br>
frequency, or intensity of other dyssomnias, parasomnias. The amount of the disclosed<br>
compound to be administered to a subject will depend on the particular disorder, the mode of<br>
administration, co-administered compounds, if any, and the characteristics of the subject, such<br>
as general health, other diseases, age, sex, genotype, body weight and tolerance to drugs. The<br>
skilled artisan will be able to determine appropriate dosages depending on these and other<br>
factors.<br>
A "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" or "salt" of the disclosed compound is a product<br>
of the disclosed compound that contains an ionic bond, and is typically produced by reacting<br>
the disclosed compound with either an acid or a base, suitable for administering to a subject.<br>
A "pharmaceutical composition" is a formulation containing the disclosed compounds<br>
in a form suitable for administration to a subject. In another embodiment, the pharmaceutical<br>
composition is in bulk or in unit dosage form. The unit dosage form is any of a variety of<br>
forms, including, for example, a capsule, an IV bag, a tablet, a single pump on an aerosol<br>
inhaler, or a vial. The quantity of active ingredient (e.g., a formulation of the disclosed<br>
compound or salts thereof) in a unit dose of composition is an effective amount and is varied<br>
according to the particular treatment involved. One skilled in the art will appreciate that it is<br><br><br>
sometimes necessary to make routine variations to the dosage depending on the age and<br>
condition of the patient. The dosage will also depend on the route of administration. A variety<br>
of routes are contemplated, including oral, pulmonary, rectal, parenteral, transdermal,<br>
subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intranasal, and the like. Dosage<br>
forms for the topical or transdermal administration of a compound of this invention include<br>
powders, sprays, ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, solutions, patches and inhalants. In<br>
another embodiment, the active compound is mixed under sterile conditions with a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and with any preservatives, buffers, or propellants that are<br>
required.<br>
The term "flash dose" refers to compound formulations that are rapidly dispersing<br>
dosage forms.<br>
The term "immediate release" is defined as a release of compound from a dosage form<br>
in a relatively brief period of time, generally up to about 60 minutes. The term "modified<br>
release" is defined to include delayed release, extended release, and pulsed release. The term<br>
"pulsed release" is defined as a series of releases of drug from a dosage form. The term<br>
"sustained release" or "extended release" is defined as continuous release of a compound from<br>
a dosage form over a prolonged period.<br>
A "subject" includes mammals, e.g., humans, companion animals (e.g., dogs, cats,<br>
birds, and the like), farm animals (e.g., cows, sheep, pigs, horses, fowl, and the like) and<br>
laboratory animals (e.g., rats, mice, guinea pigs, birds, and the like). Typically, the subject is<br>
human.<br>
The invention provides a method of modulating sleep by administering an effective<br>
amount of a benzisoxazole analog of the invention, which is a moiety mat is an antagonist or<br>
an inverse agonist of the 5HT2a receptor or a collection of 5HT2a receptors.<br>
Effective sleep modulators have certain characteristics that correspond with increased<br>
efficacy and decreased side effects. These characteristics include a desired half-life in a<br>
subject, controlled onset of desired sedative effects, and minimal to no detectable effect on<br>
psychomotor or other central nervous system (CNS) side effects (e.g., memory deficits,<br>
decreased muscle tone, drooping eyelids or drowsiness).<br>
One approach to developing an effective sleep modulator is strategically derivitizing a<br>
known compound or family of compounds with sleep modulating activity. Derivitizing may<br>
enhance at least one biological properties to allow a compound to perform in an improved<br>
manner. Examples of favorable biological properties include, but are not limited, to induction<br>
of a discrete sleep or hypnotic state, activity of the therapeutic compound for a discrete period<br><br>
of time, penetration through the blood brain barrier into the CNS, e.g., resulting from<br>
lipophilicity of substituents or conformational lipophilicity (i.e., lipophilicity as a result of a<br>
particular conformation, such as internal salt formation between a carboxylate anion and a<br>
protonated amine), modulation of the half-life of the therapeutic compound, an alteration of<br>
charge, an alteration of pharmacokinetics, an alteration of log P by a value of at least one,<br>
increased receptor selectivity, reduced peripheral half-life, the ability to increase dosage,<br>
increased peripheral elimination, decreased anti-muscarinic activity, decreased anti-<br>
cholinergic, and any combination thereof.<br>
Derivitizing results in a variety of effects and alter different mechanisms of action. For<br>
example, in some circumstances, a compound containing a particular functional group, such as,<br>
e.g., an ester, carboxylic acid, or alcohol group, possesses an improved selectivity for a desired<br>
receptor versus undesired receptors when compared with a compound without this group. In<br>
other circumstances, the compound containing the particular functional group is more active as<br>
a therapeutic agent for treating sleep disorders than the corresponding compound without this<br>
group. The effect of the derivitized compound depends on the identity of the addition.<br>
By derivitizing a compound in order to enhance favorable biological properties and<br>
decrease undesirable side effects, it is possible to implement a strategy based on potential<br>
mechanistic effects or interactions. For example, in some compounds, the presence of a<br>
carboxylic acid results in the ability to form an intramolecular ionic bond that includes the<br>
corresponding carboxylate ion, e.g., zwitterion species formation with a nitrogen atom within<br>
the compound or salt bridge formation. These interactions result in favorable biological effects<br>
such as conformational lipophilicity, i.e., increased lipophilicity as a result of a particular<br>
conformation, such as internal salt formation between a carboxylate anion and a protonated<br>
amine. Such conformational lipophilicity allows penetration through the blood brain barrier<br>
into the CNS, despite that the presence of two polar ions is generally thought to inhibit<br>
crossing of the non-polar blood-brain barrier. Another benefit of the presence of the<br>
carboxylic acid is an improved ability of the compound to bind selectively to the desired<br>
receptor.<br>
Compounds of the invention can also be derivitized to produce prodrugs. "Prodrug"<br>
includes a precursor form of the drug which is metabolically converted in vivo to produce the<br>
active drug. The invention further contemplates the use of prodrugs which are converted in<br>
vivo to the sleep modulating compounds used in the methods of the invention (see, e.g., R. B.<br>
Silverman, 1992, "The Organic Chemistry of Drug Design and Drug Action", Academic Press,<br>
Chp. 8). Such prodrugs can be used to alter the biodistribution (e.g., to allow compounds<br><br>
which would not typically cross the blood-brain barrier to cross the blood-brain barrier) or the<br>
pharmacokinetics of the sleep modulating compound. For example, an anionic group, e.g., a<br>
carboxylate, sulfate or sulfonate, can be esterified, e.g., with an alkyl group (e.g., a methyl<br>
group) or a phenyl group, to yield an ester. When the ester is administered to a subject, the<br>
ester is cleaved, enzymatically or non-enzymatically, reductively or hydrolytically, to reveal<br>
the anionic group. Such an ester can be cyclic, e.g., a cyclic sulfate or sulfone, or two or more<br>
anionic moieties may be esterified through a linking group. An anionic group can be esterified<br>
with moieties (e.g., acyloxymethyl esters) which are cleaved to reveal an intermediate sleep<br>
modulating compound which subsequently decomposes to yield the active sleep modulating<br>
compound. In one embodiment, the prodrug is a reduced form of a carboxylate, sulfate or<br>
sulfonate, e.g., an alcohol or thiol, which is oxidized in vivo to the sleep modulating<br>
compound. Furthermore, an anionic moiety can be esterified to a group which is actively<br>
transported in vivo, or which is selectively taken up by target organs.<br>
In general, in another aspect, the present invention relates to the use of the compounds<br>
of Formula I-IVd to modulate sleep. In one embodiment, the compounds of Formula I-IVd<br>
modulate sleep with decreased side effects: e.g., the compounds do not inhibit REM sleep<br>
(consequently, sleep induced by these compounds may more closely resemble a person's<br>
natural sleep cycles), use of the compound does not result in rebound insomnia, and/or the<br>
compounds do not inhibit locomotor activity or adversely effect body temperature.<br>
In one embodiment, the compounds of Formula I-IVd for use in the methods of the<br>
invention have one or more of the following characteristics: an inhibition constant (Ki) with<br>
regard to 5HT2a receptor binding of less than 1 µM; a Ki with regard to off target binding to an<br>
off target selected from Ml, M2, M3, D1, D2, α1 and α2 that is more than 5 times greater than<br>
the K, with regard to the 5HT2a receptor; a nonREM peak time value that is greater than 55%<br>
nonREM sleep per hour by the third hour after the compound is administered to a subject; a<br>
cumulative total increase in nonREM sleep of not less than 20 minutes for compound doses<br>
that produce maximum sleep consolidation; a longest sleep bout that is greater than 13 minutes<br>
in duration; net longest sleep bout post treatment is greater than or equal to 3 minutes when<br>
adjusted using a baseline value obtained at least 24 hours prior to administration of the<br>
compound to a subject; an average sleep bout that is greater than 5 minutes at absolute peak;<br>
administration of the compound to a subject does not produce appreciable amounts of rebound<br>
insomnia; administration of the compound to a subject does not appreciably inhibit REM sleep;<br><br>
and administration of the compound to a subject does not disproportionately inhibit locomotor<br>
activity relative to the normal effects of sleep.<br>
In another embodiment, the compound of Formula I-TVd for use in the methods of the<br>
invention has one or more of the following characteristics: an inhibition constant (Ki) with<br>
regard to 5HT2a receptor binding of less than 300 nM; a K, with regard to off target binding to<br>
an off target selected from Ml, M2, M3, Dl, D2, α1 and α2 that is more than 10 times greater<br>
than the Ki with regard to 5HT2a; a nonREM peak time value that is greater than 55% nonREM<br>
sleep per hour by the third hour after the compound is administered to a subject; a cumulative<br>
total increase in nonREM sleep of not less than 20 minutes for compound doses that produce<br>
maximum sleep consolidation; a longest sleep bout that is greater than 13 minutes in duration;<br>
net longest sleep bout post treatment is greater than or equal to 3 minutes when adjusted using<br>
a baseline value obtained at least 24 hours prior to administration of the compound to a subject;<br>
an average sleep bout that is greater than 5 minutes at absolute peak; administration of the<br>
compound to a subject does not produce appreciable amounts of rebound insomnia;<br>
administration of the compound to a subject does not appreciably inhibit REM sleep; and<br>
administration of the compound to a subject does not disproportionately inhibit locomotor<br>
activity relative to the normal effects of sleep.<br>
In another embodiment, the compound of Formula I-IVd for use in the methods of the<br>
invention has one or more of the following characteristics: an inhibition constant (Kj) with<br>
regard to 5HT2a receptor binding of less than 150 nM; a Ki with regard to off target binding to<br>
an off target selected from Dl, D2, Ml, M2, M3, α1 and α2, that is more than 20 times greater<br>
than the Ki with regard to 5HT2a; a nonREM peak time value that is greater than 55% nonREM<br>
sleep per hour by the third hour after the compound is administered to a subject; a cumulative<br>
total increase in nonREM sleep not less than 20 minutes for compound doses that produce<br>
maximum sleep consolidation; a longest sleep bout that is greater than 17 minutes in duration;<br>
net longest sleep bout post treatment is greater than or equal to 5 minutes when adjusted using<br>
a baseline value obtained at least 24 hours prior to administration of the compound to a subject;<br>
an average sleep bout that is greater than 6 minutes at absolute peak; administration of the<br>
compound to a subject does not produce appreciable amounts of rebound insomnia;<br>
administration of the compound to a subject does not appreciably inhibit REM sleep; and<br>
administration of the compound to a subject does not disproportionately inhibit locomotor<br>
activity or motor tone relative to the normal effects of sleep.<br>
The in vitro selection criteria for compounds of the invention are shown in Table 1.<br><br><br>
In another embodiment, the off target binding Ki is 50 times the measured 5HT2a<br>
receptor Ki. In some embodiments, the off target binding Ki is 100 times the measured 5HT2a<br>
receptor Ki.<br>
In vitro binding assays are used to determine 5HT2a binding (i.e., primary target<br>
binding) and Ml, M2 and M3 binding (i.e., off target binding). These binding assays measure<br>
the ability of benzisoxazole analogs to displace known standards from the 5HT2a, M1, M2, and<br>
M3 receptors, wherein Ml, M2, and M3 are cholinergic (muscarinic) receptors. Similar assays<br>
are performed with 5HT2a and dopamine receptors (D1, and D2), and with 5HT2a and<br>
adrenergic receptors (a1 and a2).<br>
The binding studies against the 5HT2a receptor indicate binding affinity, and therefore,<br>
the results of the binding assays are an indication of the activity of the benzisoxazole analog<br>
compound. The binding studies against the muscarinic receptors indicate the extent to which<br>
the compounds bind the muscarinic receptors responsible for anti-cholinergic activity of the<br>
compound. Binding to muscarinic receptors results in several undesired side effects of many<br>
known antihistamines, e.g., dry-mouth. A decrease in the binding of the compounds to the<br>
M1-M3 receptors, relative to the binding of the compound to the 5HT2a receptor, is an<br>
indication of the greater specificity of the compound for the 5HT2a receptor over the<br>
muscarinic receptor. Moreover, a drug with increased specificity for the 5HT2a receptor<br>
possesses less anti-cholinergic side effects.<br>
The 5HT2a binding of benzisoxazole analogs of the invention (also referred to herein as<br>
"test compounds" or "compounds of the invention") is determined by measuring the specific<br>
binding of a given test compound, or series of test compounds, to the 5HT2a receptor, and<br>
comparing it with the specific binding of known standard (i.e., reference compound).<br>
In vitro selection criteria for benzisoxazole analogs of the invention are shown in Table<br>
2.<br><br><br>
5HT2a binding (primary target binding) and Ml, M2 and M3 binding (off target<br>
binding) are determined using the 5HT2a, Ml, M2 and M3 binding assays described.<br>
The Ml binding assay determines the Ml binding of a test compound by measuring the<br>
specific binding of a given test compound to M1 and comparing it with the specific binding of a<br>
reference compound. (See e.g., Buckley, et al, Mol. Pharmacol. 35:469-76 (1989) (with<br>
modifications)). Reference compounds used in the Ml binding assay include, for example,<br>
scopolamine, MethylBr (K, 0.09 nM); 4-DAMP methiodide (K, 0.27 nM); pirenzepine (Ki 2.60<br>
nM); HHSID (K, 5.00 nM); and methoctramine (Kj 29.70 nM).<br><br>
For example, in one embodiment of the Ml binding assay, the M1 muscarinic receptor<br>
is a human recombinant Ml expressed in CHO cells, and a radioligand, [3H]-scopolamine, N-<br>
methyl chloride (80-100 Ci/mmol) at a final ligand concentration of 0.5 nM is used to detect<br>
specific binding for M1. The assay characteristics include a KD (binding affinity) of 0.05 nM<br>
and a Bmax (receptor number) of 4.2 pmol/mg protein, (-)-scopolamine, methyl-, bromide<br>
(methylscopolamine bromide) (1.0 µM) is used as the non-specific determinant, reference<br>
compound and positive control. Binding reactions are carried out in PBS for 60 minutes at 25<br>
°C. The reaction is terminated by rapid vacuum filtration onto glass fiber filters. The level of<br>
radioactivity trapped on the filters is measured and compared to control values to ascertain any<br>
interaction between a given test compound and the cloned muscarinic Ml binding site.<br>
The M2 binding assay determines the M2 binding of a test compound by measuring the<br>
specific binding of a given test compound to M2 and comparing it with the specific binding of<br>
a reference compound. (See e.g., Buckley, et al, Mol. Pharmacol. 35:469-76 (1989) (with<br>
modifications)). Reference compounds used in the M2 binding assay include, for example,<br>
scopolamine, MethylBr (K, 0.3 nM); 4-DAMP methiodide (K, 20.7 nM); methoctramine (K,<br>
20.460 nM); HHSID (Ki 212.7 nM); and pirenzepine (Ki 832.9 nM).<br>
For example, in one embodiment of the M2 binding assay, the M2 muscarinic receptor<br>
is a human recombinant M2 expressed in CHO cells, and a radioligand, [3H]-scopolamine, N-<br>
methyl chloride (80-100 Ci/mmol) at a final ligand concentration of 0.5 nM is used to detect<br>
specific binding for Ml. The assay characteristics include a KD (binding affinity) of 0.29 nM<br>
and a Bmax (receptor number) of 2.1 pmol/mg protein, (-)-scopolamine, methyl-, bromide<br>
(methylscopolamine bromide) (1.0µM) is used as the non-specific determinant, reference<br>
compound and positive control. Binding reactions are carried out in PBS for 60 minutes at<br>
25 °C. The reaction is terminated by rapid vacuum filtration onto glass fiber filters. The level<br>
of radioactivity trapped on the filters is measured and compared to control values to ascertain<br>
any interaction between a given test compound and the cloned muscarinic M2 binding site.<br>
The M3 binding assay determines the M3 binding of a test compound by measuring the<br>
specific binding of a given test compound to M3 and comparing it with the specific binding of<br>
a reference compound. (See e.g., Buckley, et al, Mol. Pharmacol. 35:469-76 (1989) (with<br>
modifications)). Reference compounds used in the M3 binding assay include, for example,<br>
scopolamine, MethylBr (K; 0.3 nM); 4-DAMP methiodide (K, 0.8 nM); HHSID (K, 14.5 nM);<br>
pirenzepine (K, 153.3 nM); and methoctramine (K, 700.0 nM).<br><br>
For example, in one embodiment of the M3 binding assay, the M3 muscarinic receptor<br>
is a human recombinant M3 expressed in CHO cells, and a radioligand, [3H]-scopolamine, N-<br>
methyl chloride (80-100 Ci/mmol) at a final ligand concentration of 0.2 nM is used to detect<br>
specific binding for Ml. The assay characteristics include a KD (binding affinity) of 0.14 nM<br>
and a Bmax (receptor number) of 4.0 pmol/mg protein, (-)-scopolamine, methyl-, bromide<br>
(methylscopolamine bromide) (1.0 µM) is used as the non-specific determinant, reference<br>
compound and positive control. Binding reactions are carried out in 50 mM TRIS-HC1 (pH<br>
7.4) containing 10 mM MgCk, 1 mM EDTA for 60 minutes at 25 °C. The reaction is<br>
terminated by rapid vacuum filtration onto glass fiber filters. The level of radioactivity trapped<br>
on the filters is measured and compared to control values to ascertain any interaction between a<br>
given test compound and the cloned muscarinic M3 binding site.<br>
5HT2a binding is determined as described for example in British Journal of<br>
Pharmacology (1995) 115, 622-628.<br>
Other in vitro selection criteria for benzisoxazole analogs of the invention includes<br>
HERG binding. HERG binding is determined using a hERG block comparative study to<br>
evaluate the effect of a given test compound on cloned hERG channels expressed in<br>
mammalian cells. (See e.g., Brown and Rampe, Pharmaceutical News 7:15-20 (2000); Rampe<br>
etai, FEBS Lett., 417:28-32 (1997); Weirich and Antoni, Basic Res. Cardiol. 93 Suppl. 1:125-<br>
32 (1998); and Yap and Camm, Clin. Exp. Allergy, 29 Suppl 3,174-81 (1999)).<br>
Binding of hERG, the cardiac potassium channel responsible for the rapid delayed<br>
rectifier current (Ikr) in human ventricles, is evaluated because inhibition of Ikr is the most<br>
common cause of cardiac action potential prolongation by non-cardiac drugs. (See Brown and<br>
Rampe (2000), Weirich and Antoni (1998); and Yap and Camm (1999)). Increased action<br>
potential duration causes prolongation of the QT interval that has been associated with a<br>
dangerous ventricular arrhythmia, torsade depointes. (Brown and Rampe (2000)).<br>
In the hERG assay, hERG channels are expressed in a human embryonic kidney cell<br>
line (HEK293) that lacks endogenous IRT. In some cases, expression in a mammalian cell line<br>
can be preferable to transient expression in Xenopus oocytes, as the latter demonstrates a<br>
consistent 10-100 fold lower sensitivity to hERG channel blockers. (See, Rampe 1997).<br>
In one embodiment of the hERG assay, the positive control (i.e., reference compound)<br>
is terfenadine (Sigma, St. Louis MO), which has been shown, at a concentration of 60 nM, to<br>
block hERG current by approximately 75%. Test compounds are delivered in HEPES-<br>
buffered physiological saline (HB-PS) + 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Each test<br><br>
compound is applied at a concentration of 10 µM to the HEK293 cells expressing hERG (n ≥<br>
3, where n = the number of cells). Cells are exposed to the test compound for the time<br>
necessary to reach steady-state block, but not longer than 10 minutes. The positive control (60<br>
mM terfenadine) is applied to two cells (n ≥ 2).<br>
The hERG-exposed cells are then transferred to the recording chamber and superfused<br>
with HB-PS solution. The pipette solution for whole cell recordings includes potassium<br>
aspartate (130 mM), MgCl2 (5 mM), EGTA (5 mM), ATP (4 mM), and HEPES (10 mM) at a<br>
pH adjusted to 7.2 with KOH. Onset and steady state block of hERG current due to the test<br>
compound are measured using a pulse pattern with fixed amplitudes (depolarization: +20 mV<br>
for 2 seconds; repolarization: -50 mV for 2 seconds), repeated at 10 second intervals, from a<br>
holding potential of-80 mV. Peak tail current is measured during the 2 second step to -50<br>
mV. A steady state is maintained for at least 30 seconds before applying the test compound or<br>
positive control compound. Peak tail currents are measured until a new steady state is<br>
achieved.<br>
In addition to the in vitro selection criteria described above, compounds of the<br>
invention may be selected using the following in vivo sleep-wake and physiological<br>
assessments:<br>
NonREM Sleep: Benzisoxazole analogs are selected if, in adult, male Wistar rats, (i)<br>
peak nonREM amount exceeds 55% nonREM per hour by no later than the third hour post-<br>
treatment; and (ii) the nature of this increase in nonREM sleep is such that the net cumulative<br>
total increase in nonREM sleep in the initial 6 hours post-treatment (adjusted for baseline at the<br>
corresponding circadian time 24 hours earlier, and relative to Vehicle control treatment) is not<br>
less than 20 minutes in total for compound doses that produces maximum sleep consolidation<br>
as measured by sleep bout length, when drug is delivered orally.<br>
The term "nonREM peak sleep time" is defined as an absolute peak amount of<br>
nonREM sleep per hour post treatment, with drug administration occurring at Circadian Time<br>
(CT) 18, which is 6 hours after lights off in a nocturnal laboratory rat when housed in a LD<br>
12:12 (12-hours light and 12 hours dark) light-dark cycle. The nominal criteria of 55%<br>
nonREM sleep per hour is equivalent to 33 minutes of nonREM sleep per hour.<br>
As used herein, the term "cumulative nonREM sleep" is defined as the net total<br>
aggregate increase in the number of minutes of nonREM sleep, measured through out the<br>
entire duration of a drug's soporific effect, which typically, but not always occurs in the first 6<br>
hours post-treatment, adjusted for the net total aggregate number of minutes of nonREM sleep<br><br>
that occurred during the corresponding non-treatment baseline times of day recorded 24 hours<br>
earlier, relative to like vehicle control treatment.<br>
As defined herein, the term "sleep bout" refers to a discrete episode of continuous or<br>
near continuous sleep, comprised of nonREM sleep, REM sleep, or both nonREM and REM<br>
sleep stages, delimited prior and after the episode by greater than two contiguous 10 second<br>
epochs of wakefulness. The following non-limiting description illustrates this concept:<br>
WWWWSSSSWSSSSSSSWWSSSSSSSWWWW. wherein each letter represents the<br>
predominant state of arousal (S=sleep, W=wake) observed each 10 seconds. The measured<br>
sleep 'bout" is 21 ten-second epochs or 3.5 minutes in duration.<br>
Sleep Consolidation: Benzisoxazole analogs are selected if, in adult male Wistar rats,<br>
(i) the absolute duration of longest continuous sleep episodes (i.e., "sleep bout") post-treatment<br>
is greater than 13 minutes in duration; (ii) the net longest sleep bout post treatment is greater<br>
than or equal to 3 minutes when adjusted for baseline 24 hours earlier and calculated relative to<br>
vehicle treatment; and (iii) the mean absolute duration of every sleep bout when averaged per<br>
hour, on an hour by hour basis, is greater than or equal to 5 minutes. The aforementioned<br>
selection criteria assume that stages of sleep and wakefulness are determined continuously<br>
every 10 seconds (e.g., 10 second sleep scoring "epochs"), that sleep and wakefulness are<br>
measured polygraphically using EEG and EMG criteria, and sleep episodes (comprised of<br>
nonREM and/or REM sleep) are defined as continuous "bouts" until the episode is interrupted<br>
by greater than two contiguous 10 second epochs of wakefulness.<br>
As used herein, the term "longest sleep bout length" is defined as the total number of<br>
minutes an animal remains asleep (nonREM and/or REM sleep stages) during the single<br>
longest sleep bout that occurred beginning in a given hour post-treatment. The "sleep bout<br>
length" measurement criteria assumes sleep is measured continuously in 10 second epochs, and<br>
is scored based upon the predominant state, computed or otherwise determined as a discrete<br>
sleep stage (where sleep stages are defined as nonREM sleep, REM sleep, or wakefulness)<br>
during the 10 second interval that defines the epoch.<br>
The term "average sleep bout length" is defined as the average duration (in minutes) of<br>
every and all sleep episodes or bouts that began in a given hour, independent of the individual<br>
duration of each episode or bout.<br>
Concurrently Measured Side Effects: Benzisoxazole analogs are selected if, in adult,<br>
male Wistar rats, these compounds (i) do not produce appreciable amounts of rebound<br>
insomnia; (ii) do not appreciably inhibit REM sleep; and (iii) do not disproportionately inhibit<br><br>
locomotor motor activity and/or motor tone relative to the normal effects of sleep itself. The<br>
threshold definitions for these three side-effect variables are as follows:<br>
"Rebound insomnia" is defined as period of rebound, paradoxical, or compensatory<br>
wakefulness that occurs after the sleep promoting effects of a hypnotic or soporific agent.<br>
Rebound insomnia is typically observed during the usual circadian rest phase 6-18 hours post-<br>
treatment at CT-18 (6 hours after lights-off, given LD 12:12), but can occur at any time during<br>
the initial 30 hours post-treatment. Rebound is considered unacceptable when, in the adult,<br>
male Wistar rat, excess cumulative wakefulness associated with rebound insomnia is greater<br>
than 10 % reduction in average of hourly NonREM sleep times during post-treatment circadian<br>
rest phase (lights-on).<br>
In adult, male Wistar rats, rebound insomnia manifests as an increase in wakefulness<br>
relative to corresponding times at baseline (24 hours earlier) subsequent to a drug-induced<br>
sleep effect, and rebound insomnia is measured cumulatively.<br>
"REM sleep inhibition" is defined as the reduction of REM sleep time post-treatment at<br>
CT-18 (6 hours after lights-off; LD 12:12) or at CT-5 (5 hours after lights-on; LD 12:12).<br>
Compounds that reduce REM sleep time by greater than 15 minutes (relative to baseline and<br>
adjusted for vehicle treatment) when administered at either CT-18 or CT-5 are considered<br>
unacceptable.<br>
As defined herein, "disproportionate locomotor activity inhibition" is a reduction of<br>
locomotor activity that exceeds the normal and expected reduction in behavioral activity<br>
attributable to sleep. Logic dictates that if an animal is asleep, there will normally be a<br>
corresponding reduction in locomotor activity. If a hypnotic or soporific compound reduces<br>
locomotor activity levels in excess of 20% greater than that explained by sleep alone, the<br>
compound is deemed unacceptable. Locomotor activity (LMA) or motor tone may be<br>
quantified objectively using any form of behavioral locomotor activity monitor (non-specific<br>
movements, telemetry-based activity monitoring, 3-dimensional movement detection devices,<br>
wheel running activity, exploratory measures, electromyographic recording, etc.) so long as it<br>
is measured concurrently with objective sleep-wakefulness measures in the same animal.<br>
In one embodiment, locomotor activity within the animal's cage is measured using a<br>
biotelemetry device surgically implanted in the animal's peritoneal cavity; the implantable<br>
device and associated telemetry receiver detects if and how much animal moves within the<br>
cage. Sleep and wakefulness is measured in 10 second epochs simultaneously. Counts of<br>
locomotor activity per unit time are divided by the concurrent amount of wakefulness per the<br>
same unit, yielding a "locomotor activity intensity" (LMAI) measure for that unit time.<br><br>
Hypnotic or soporific compounds administered at CT-18 (6 hours after lights-off; LD 12:12)<br>
that decrease locomotor activity per unit time awake by greater than 20% relative to vehicle<br>
would be judged unacceptable.<br>
In another embodiment, the benzisoxazole analogs of the invention are selected using<br>
the in vivo sleep-wake and physiological assessment criteria shown in Table 4:<br><br>
Methods for evaluating these sleep-wake and physiological assessment criteria are<br>
described above. The "absolute value" shown in second column of Table 4 refers to the value<br>
as determined for each test compound, while the "change" value shown in the third column of<br>
Table 4 reflects an adjusted value in which the absolute value is the difference from vehicle,<br>
when the vehicle values are adjusted for baseline.<br>
In some embodiments, the longest sleep bout is greater than 13 minutes in duration. In<br>
others, it is greater than 17 minutes in duration. In some embodiments, the net longest sleep<br>
bout post treatment is greater than or equal to 3 minutes in duration. In others, it is greater than<br>
or equal to 6 minutes in duration.<br>
Other in vivo sleep-wake and physiological assessment criteria used to select<br>
benzisoxazole analogs of the invention include measurement of acute body temperature and<br>
latent body temperature as a change in baseline relative to vehicle. The acute body<br>
temperature change should not exceed - 0.60 °C, and the latent body temperature change<br>
should not exceed + 0.60 °C at Time 1-6 hours. The acute body temperature (T1-6) is adjusted<br><br>
for the corresponding baseline measured 24 hours earlier, relative to vehicle (the decrease from<br>
vehicle). The latent body temperature, measured 7-18 hours post drug treatment (T7-18), is<br>
adjusted for the corresponding baseline measured 24 hours earlier, relative to vehicle (the<br>
decrease from vehicle).<br>
The compounds, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, is administered orally,<br>
nasally, transdermally, pulmonary, inhalationally, buccally, sublingually, intraperintoneally,<br>
intravenously, rectally, intrapleurally, intrathecally and parenterally. In another embodiment,<br>
the compound is administered orally. One skilled in the art will recognize the advantages of<br>
certain routes of administration.<br>
In some embodiments, a compound of Formula I - IVd is administered as a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt. One skilled in the art will recognize the various methods for<br>
creating pharmaceutically acceptable salts and identifying the appropriate salt. In another<br>
embodiment, the compound or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is included in a<br>
pharmaceutical composition.<br>
A "subject" includes mammals, e.g., humans, companion animals (e.g., dogs, cats,<br>
birds, and the like), farm animals (e.g., cows, sheep, pigs, horses, fowl, and the like) and<br>
laboratory animals (e.g., rats, mice, guinea pigs, birds, and the like). Typically, the subject is<br>
human.<br>
A subject in need of treatment has a disease or disorder that can affect the subject's<br>
health and/or wellbeing.<br>
For example, the disorder can be a sleep disorder. It is well known in the art that<br>
certain medical disorders, for example, central nervous system (CNS) disorders, e.g. mental or<br>
neurological disorders, e.g., anxiety, can have a sleep disorder component, e.g., sleep<br>
deprivation. Thus, "treating a sleep disorder" also includes treating a sleep disorder<br>
component of other disorders, e.g., CNS disorders. Further, treating the sleep disorder<br>
component of CNS disorders can also have the beneficial effect of ameliorating other<br>
symptoms associated with the disorder. For example, in some subjects experiencing anxiety<br>
coupled with sleep deprivation, treating the sleep deprivation component also treats the anxiety<br>
component. Thus, the present invention also includes a method of treating such medical<br>
disorders.<br>
For example, sleep disorders associated with mental disorders include psychoses, mood<br>
disorders, anxiety disorders, panic disorder, addictions, and the like. Specific mental disorders<br>
include, for example, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, affective neurosis/disorder,<br><br>
depressive neurosis/disorder, anxiety neurosis; dysthymic disorder, behavior disorder, mood<br>
disorder, schizophrenia, manic depression, delirium, and alcoholism.<br>
Sleep disorders associated with neurological disorders include, for example, cerebral<br>
degenerative disorders, dementia, parkinsonism, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's, fatal<br>
familial insomnia, sleep related epilepsy, electrical status epilepticus of sleep, and sleep-related<br>
headaches. Sleep disorders associated with other medical disorders include, for example,<br>
sleeping sickness, nocturnal cardiac ischemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sleep-<br>
related asthma, sleep-related gastroesophageal reflux, peptic ulcer disease, and fibrositis<br>
syndrome.<br>
In some circumstances, sleep disorders are also associated with pain, e.g., neuropathic<br>
pain associated with restless leg syndrome; migraine; hyperalgesia, fibromyalgia, pain;<br>
enhanced or exaggerated sensitivity to pain, such as hyperalgesia, causalgia and allodynia;<br>
acute pain; burn pain; atypical facial pain; neuropathic pain; back pain; complex regional pain<br>
syndromes I and II; arthritic pain; sports injury pain; pain related to infection, e.g., HIV, post-<br>
polio syndrome, and post-herpetic neuralgia; phantom limb pain; labor pain; cancer pain; post-<br>
chemotherapy pain; post-stroke pain; post-operative pain; neuralgia; conditions associated with<br>
visceral pain including irritable bowel syndrome, migraine and angina.<br>
Other sleep disorders include, for example, short sleeper, long sleeper, subwakefulness<br>
syndrome, fragmentary myoclonus, sleep hyperhidrosis, menstrual-associated sleep disorder,<br>
pregnancy-associated sleep disorder, terrifying hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep-related<br>
neurogenic tachypnea, sleep-related laryngospasm, and sleep choking syndrome.<br>
Insomnia is typically classed into sleep onset insomnia, where a subject takes more than<br>
30 minutes to fall asleep; and sleep maintenance insomnia, where the subject spends more than<br>
30 minutes awake during an expected sleep period, or, for example, waking before the desired<br>
wake-up time with difficulty or an inability to get back to sleep. The disclosed compounds are<br>
particularly effective in treating sleep onset and sleep maintenance insomnias, insomnia<br>
resulting from circadian rhythm adjustment disorders, or insomnia resulting from CNS<br>
disorders. One embodiment is treating a subject for a circadian rhythm adjustment disorder.<br>
Another embodiment is treating a subject for insomnia resulting from a mood disorder. In<br>
other embodiments, a subject is treated for sleep apnea, somnambulism, night terrors, restless<br>
leg syndrome, sleep onset insomnia, and sleep maintenance insomnia. For example, a subject<br>
is treated for sleep onset insomnia or sleep maintenance insomnia. The disclosed compounds<br>
are effective for treating sleep onset insomnia. The disclosed compounds are also effective for<br><br>
treating sleep maintenance insomnia. In one embodiment, the disclosed compounds improve<br>
the quality of sleep e.g., the amount of slow wave sleep is increased.<br>
The dosage regimen utilizing the compounds is selected in accordance with a variety<br>
of factors including type, species, age, weight, sex and medical condition of the patient; the<br>
severity of the condition to be treated; the route of administration; the renal and hepatic<br>
function of the patient; and the particular compound or salt thereof employed. An ordinarily<br>
skilled physician or veterinarian can readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of<br>
the drug required to treat, prevent, counter or arrest the progress of the condition.<br>
Oral dosages in humans of the present invention, when used for the indicated effects, will<br>
range between about 0.05 to 5000 mg/day orally. Effective amounts of the disclosed<br>
compounds typically range between about 0.01 mg per day and about 100 mg per day, and<br>
between about 0.1 mg per day and about 10 mg/day. Techniques for administration of the<br>
disclosed compounds of the invention can be found in Remington: the Science and Practice of<br>
Pharmacy, 19th edition, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA (1995).<br>
For example, in some embodiments, an acid salt of a compound containing an amine or<br>
other basic group is obtained by reacting the compound with a suitable organic or inorganic<br>
acid, such as hydrogen chloride, hydrogen bromide, acetic acid, perchloric acid and the like.<br>
Compounds with a quaternary ammonium group also contain a counter anion such as chloride,<br>
bromide, iodide, acetate, perchlorate and the like. Other examples of such salts include<br>
hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, sulfates, methanesulfonates, nitrates, maleates, acetates,<br>
citrates, fumarates, tartrates (e.g. (+)-tartrates, (-)-tartrates or mixtures thereof including<br>
racemic mixtures), succinates, benzoates and salts with amino acids such as glutamic acid.<br>
Salts of compounds containing a carboxylic acid or other acidic functional group are<br>
prepared by reacting with a suitable base. Such a pharmaceutically acceptable salt is made<br>
with a base which affords a pharmaceutically acceptable cation, which includes alkali metal<br>
salts (especially sodium and potassium), alkaline earth metal salts (especially calcium and<br>
magnesium), aluminum salts and ammonium salts, as well as salts made from physiologically<br>
acceptable organic bases such as trimethylamine, triethylamine, morpholine, pyridine,<br>
piperidine, picoline, dicyclohexylamine, N, N'-dibenzylethylenediamine,<br>
2-hydroxyethylamine, bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)amine, tri-(2-hydroxyethyl)amine, procaine,<br>
dibenzylpiperidine, N-benzyl-3-phenethylamine, dehydroabietylamine,<br>
N,N'-bisdehydroabietylamine, glucamine, N-methylglucamine, collidine, quinine, quinoline,<br>
and basic amino acid such as lysine and arginine.<br><br>
In some embodiments, certain compounds and their salts also exist in the form of<br>
solvates, for example hydrates, and the present invention includes each solvate and mixtures<br>
thereof.<br>
The disclosed compounds, and salts or solvates thereof may exist in more than one<br>
crystal form, e.g., as "crystal polymorphs" or "polymorphs". Crystal polymorphs of the<br>
disclosed compounds are prepared by crystallization under different conditions. For example,<br>
using different solvents or different solvent mixtures for recrystallization; crystallization at<br>
different temperatures; various modes of cooling, ranging from very fast to very slow cooling<br>
during crystallization, and the like. Polymorphs are also obtained by heating or melting the<br>
disclosed compounds followed by gradual or fast cooling. The presence of polymorphs is<br>
determined by solid probe nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy,<br>
differential scanning calorimetry, powder X-ray diffraction, and other techniques known to one<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
In an embodiment, the compounds described herein, and the pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts thereof are used in pharmaceutical preparations in combination with a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers<br>
include inert solid fillers or diluents and sterile aqueous or organic solutions. The compounds<br>
will be present in such pharmaceutical compositions in amounts sufficient to provide the<br>
desired dosage amount in the range described herein. Techniques for formulation and<br>
administration of the disclosed compounds of the invention can be found in Remington: the<br>
Science and Practice of Pharmacy, above.<br>
Typically, the compound is prepared for oral administration, wherein the disclosed<br>
compounds or salts thereof are combined with a suitable solid or liquid carrier or diluent to<br>
form capsules, tablets, pills, powders, syrups, solutions, suspensions and the like.<br>
The tablets, pills, capsules, and the like contain from about 1 to about 99 weight percent<br>
of the active ingredient and a binder such as gum tragacanth, acacias, corn starch or gelatin;<br>
excipients such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato<br>
starch or alginic acid; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; and/or a sweetening agent such<br>
as sucrose, lactose, saccharin, xylitol, and the like. When a dosage unit form is a capsule, it<br>
often contains, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier such as a fatty oil.<br>
In some embodiments, various other materials are present as coatings or to modify the<br>
physical form of the dosage unit. For instance, in some embodiments, tablets are coated with<br>
shellac, sugar or both. In some embodiments, a syrup or elixir contains, in addition to the<br><br>
active ingredient, sucrose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a<br>
dye and a flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor, and the like.<br>
For some embodiments relating to parental administration, the disclosed compounds, or<br>
salts, solvates, or polymorphs thereof, can be combined with sterile aqueous or organic media<br>
to form injectable solutions or suspensions. Injectable compositions are, for example, aqueous<br>
isotonic solutions or suspensions. The compositions may be sterilized and/or contain<br>
adjuvants, such as preserving, stabilizing, wetting or emulsifying agents, solution promoters,<br>
salts for regulating the osmotic pressure and/or buffers. In addition, they may also contain<br>
other therapeutically valuable substances. The compositions are prepared according to<br>
conventional mixing, granulating or coating methods, respectively, and contain about 0.1 to<br>
75%, for example about 1 to 50%, of the active ingredient.<br>
For example, injectable solutions are produced using solvents such as sesame or peanut<br>
oil or aqueous propylene glycol, as well as aqueous solutions of water-soluble<br>
pharmaceutically-acceptable salts of the compounds. In some embodiments, dispersions are<br>
prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols and mixtures thereof in oils. Under ordinary<br>
conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to useful to prevent the<br>
growth of microorganisms. The terms "parenteral administration" and "administered<br>
parenterally" as used herein means modes of administration other than enteral and topical<br>
administration, usually by injection, and includes, without limitation, intravenous,<br>
intramuscular, intraarterial, intrathecal, intracapsular, intraorbital, intracardiac, intradermal,<br>
intraperitoneal, transtracheal, subcutaneous, subcuticular, intraarticular, subcapsular,<br>
subarachnoid, intraspinal and intrasternal injection and infusion.<br>
For rectal administration, suitable pharmaceutical compositions are, for example,<br>
topical preparations, suppositories or enemas. Suppositories are advantageously prepared from<br>
fatty emulsions or suspensions. The compositions may be sterilized and/or contain adjuvants,<br>
such as preserving, stabilizing, wetting or emulsifying agents, solution promoters, salts for<br>
regulating the osmotic pressure and/or buffers. In addition, they may also contain other<br>
therapeutically valuable substances. The compositions are prepared according to conventional<br>
mixing, granulating or coating methods, respectively, and contain about 0.1 to 75%, for<br>
example about 1 to 50%, of the active ingredient.<br>
In some embodiments, the compounds are formulated to deliver the active agent by<br>
pulmonary administration, e.g., administration of an aerosol formulation containing the active<br>
agent from, for example, a manual pump spray, nebulizer or pressurized metered-dose inhaler.<br><br>
In some embodiments, suitable formulations of this type also include other agents, such as<br>
antistatic agents, to maintain the disclosed compounds as effective aerosols.<br>
A drug delivery device for delivering aerosols comprises a suitable aerosol canister<br>
with a metering valve containing a pharmaceutical aerosol formulation as described and an<br>
actuator housing adapted to hold the canister and allow for drug delivery. The canister in the<br>
drug delivery device has a headspace representing greater than about 15% of the total volume<br>
of the canister. Often, the polymer intended for pulmonary administration is dissolved,<br>
suspended or emulsified in a mixture of a solvent, surfactant and propellant. The mixture is<br>
maintained under pressure in a canister that has been sealed with a metering valve.<br>
For nasal administration, either a solid or a liquid carrier can be used. The solid carrier<br>
includes a coarse powder having particle size in the range of, for example, from about 20 to<br>
about 500 microns and such formulation is administered by rapid inhalation through the nasal<br>
passages. In some embodiments where the liquid carrier is used, the formulation is<br>
administered as a nasal spray or drops and includes oil or aqueous solutions of the active<br>
ingredients.<br>
Also contemplated are formulations that are rapidly dispersing dosage forms, also<br>
known as "flash dose" forms. In particular, some embodiments of the present invention are<br>
formulated as compositions that release their active ingredients within a short period of time,<br>
e.g., typically less than about five minutes, for example less than about ninety seconds.<br>
Further, some embodiments of the present invention are formulated as compositions that<br>
release their active ingredients in less than about thirty seconds, for example, in less than about<br>
ten or fifteen seconds. Such formulations are suitable for administration to a subject via a<br>
variety of routes, for example by insertion into a body cavity or application to a moist body<br>
surface or open wound.<br>
Typically, a "flash dosage" is a solid dosage form that is administered orally, which<br>
rapidly disperses in the mouth, and hence does not require great effort in swallowing and<br>
allows the compound to be rapidly ingested or absorbed through the oral mucosal membranes.<br>
In some embodiments, suitable rapidly dispersing dosage forms are also used in other<br>
applications, including the treatment of wounds and other bodily insults and diseased states in<br>
which release of the medicament by externally supplied moisture is not possible.<br>
"Flash dose" forms are known in the art; see for example, effervescent dosage forms<br>
and quick release coatings of insoluble microparticles in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,578,322 and<br>
5,607,697; freeze dried foams and liquids in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,642,903 and 5,631,023; melt<br>
spinning of dosage forms in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,855,326,5,380,473 and 5,518,730; solid, free-<br><br>
form fabrication in U.S. Pat. No. 6,471,992; saccharide-based carrier matrix and a liquid binder<br>
in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,587,172, 5,616,344, 6,277,406, and 5,622,719; and other forms known to<br>
the art.<br>
The benzisoxazole analogs of the invention are also formulated as "pulsed release"<br>
formulations, in which the analog is released from the pharmaceutical compositions in a series<br>
of releases (i.e., pulses). The benzisoxazole analogs are also formulated as "sustained release"<br>
formulations in which the analog is continuously released from the pharmaceutical<br>
composition over a prolonged period.<br>
Also contemplated are formulations, e.g., liquid formulations, including cyclic or<br>
acyclic encapsulating or solvating agents, e.g., cyclodextrins, polyethers, or polysaccharides<br>
(e.g., methylcellulose). For example, polyanionic p-cyclodextrin derivatives with a sodium<br>
sulfonate salt group separate from the lipophilic cavity by an alkyl ether spacer group or<br>
polysaccharides. In an embodiment, the agent is methylcellulose. In another embodiment, the<br>
agent is a polyanionic p-cyclodextrin derivative with a sodium sulfonate salt separated from<br>
the lipophilic cavity by a butyl ether spacer group, e.g., CAPTISOL® (CyDex, Overland, KS).<br>
One skilled in the art can evaluate suitable agent/disclosed compound formulation ratios by<br>
preparing a solution of the agent in water, e.g., a 40% by weight solution; preparing serial<br>
dilutions, e.g. to make solutions of 20%, 10, 5%, 2.5%, 0% (control), and the like; adding an<br>
excess (compared to the amount that can be solubilized by the agent) of the disclosed<br>
compound; mixing under appropriate conditions, e.g., heating, agitation, sonication, and the<br>
like; centrifuging or filtering the resulting mixtures to obtain clear solutions; and analyzing the<br>
solutions for concentration of the disclosed compound.<br>
In addition to the therapeutic formulations described above, a therapy including the<br>
compounds of the present invention optionally includes, co-administration with at least one<br>
additional therapies, e.g., drugs or physical or behavioral treatments (e.g., light therapy,<br>
electrical stimulation, behavior modification, cognitive therapy, circadian rhythm modification,<br>
and the like). Such a practice is referred to as "combination therapy." The other therapy or<br>
therapies in the combination therapy include therapies recognized by one skilled in the art as<br>
desirable in combination with the compound of the invention, for example, therapies known to<br>
the art or therapies which are proposed or discovered in the art for treating sleep disorders or<br>
treating diseases associated with sleep disorders, for example, therapies for any of the sleep<br>
disorders or other conditions disclosed herein. In some embodiments the compound is<br><br>
administered as a combination therapy whereas it is administered as a monotherapy in other<br>
embodiments.<br>
Typically, the compound is administered as a monotherapy.<br>
One skilled in the art will appreciate that a therapy administered in combination with<br>
the compounds of the present invention is directed to the same or a different disorder target as<br>
that being targeted by the compounds of the present invention. Administration of the<br>
compound of the invention is first, followed by the other therapy; or alternatively,<br>
administration of the other therapy may be first. The other therapy is any known in the art to<br>
treat, prevent, or reduce the symptoms of the targeted disorder, e.g., a sleep disorder, or other<br>
disorders, e.g., other CNS disorders. In addition, some embodiments of the present invention<br>
have compounds administered in combination with other known therapies for the target<br>
disorder. Furthermore, the other therapy includes any agent of benefit to the patient when<br>
administered in combination with the disclosed compound.<br>
For example, in some embodiments where the other therapy is a drug, it is administered<br>
as a separate formulation or in the same formulation as the compound of the invention. A<br>
compound of the invention is administered in combination therapy with any at least one of<br>
commercially-available, over-the-counter or prescription medications, including, but not<br>
limited to antihistamines, antimicrobial agents, fungistatic agents, germicidal agents,<br>
hormones, antipyretic agents, antidiabetic agents, bronchodilators, antidiarrheal agents,<br>
antiarrhythmic agents, coronary dilation agents, glycosides, spasmolytics, antihypertensive<br>
agents, antidepressants, antianxiety agents, antipsychotic agents, other psychotherapeutic<br>
agents, steroids, corticosteroids, analgesics, cold medications, vitamins, sedatives, hypnotics,<br>
contraceptives, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, blood glucose lowering agents,<br>
cholesterol lowering agents, anticonvulsant agents, other antiepileptic agents,<br>
immunomodulators, anticholinergics, sympatholytics, sympathomimetics, vasodilatory agents,<br>
anticoagulants, antiarrhythmics, prostaglandins having various pharmacologic activities,<br>
diuretics, sleep aids, antihistaminic agents, antineoplastic agents, oncolytic agents,<br>
antiandrogens, antimalarial agents, antileprosy agents, and various other types of drugs. For<br>
example, GABA agonists, alpha-2-delta modulators; other 5-HT2a antagonists and inverse<br>
agonists are useful in combination with the compounds of the invention for treating sleep<br>
disorders. See Goodman and Gilman's The Basis of Therapeutics (Eighth Edition, Pergamon<br>
Press, Inc., USA, 1990) and The Merck Index (Eleventh Edition, Merck &amp; Co., Inc., USA,<br>
1989).<br><br>
Examples of drugs used in combination with the compounds of the invention include,<br>

In one embodiment, the compounds of the invention are useful in combination with a<br>
mechanical therapy, such as CPAP. "CPAP" or "continuous positive airway pressure" is a<br>
mechanical treatment for sleep apnea and other sleep-related breathing disorders (including<br>
snoring) which is typically administered via the nose or mouth of the patient.<br>
Under CPAP treatment, an individual wears a tight-fitting plastic mask over the nose<br>
when sleeping. The mask is attached to a compressor, which forces air into the nose creating a<br>
positive pressure within the patient's airways. The principle of the method is that pressurizing<br>
the airways provides a mechanical "splinting" action, which prevents or lessens airway<br>
collapse and therefore, obstructive sleep apnea. Although an effective therapeutic response is<br>
observed in most patients who undergo CPAP treatment, many patients cannot tolerate the<br>
apparatus or pressure and refuse treatment. Moreover, recent covert monitoring studies<br>
demonstrated that long-term compliance with CPAP treatment is very poor. It is known that<br>
patients remove their mask while sleeping.<br>
In one aspect, the compound of the invention is administered in conjunction with a<br>
CPAP device to promote sleep. In another aspect, the compound of the invention is<br>
administered in conjunction with a CPAP device to improve sleep. In another aspect, the<br>
compound of the invention is administered in conjunction with a CPAP device to improve<br>
compliance regarding with CPAP treatment. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is<br>
thought that by administering an effective amount of a sleep promoting compound of the<br>
invention to a patient in conjunction with CPAP treatment, the patient will sleep better and<br>
more soundly and therefore, not be as likely to remove the mask.<br>
In one embodiment, the compound of the present invention is administered prior to the<br>
CPAP treatment. In another embodiment, the compound of the present invention is<br>
administered at substantially the same time as the CPAP treatment. In one embodiment,<br>
parallel administration of an effective amount of the compound is accomplished by adding an<br>
additional aerosol channel to the air pressure treatment portion of the CPAP device, thus<br><br>
administering the compound of the present invention in a nebulized form via the nasal or oral<br>
mask of the CPAP device. Alternatively, an effective amount of the compound can be added<br>
to the water or into the liquid reservoir that is typically part of the CPAP treatment device.<br>
Using the CPAP mask treatment, the compound of the invention is administered in a<br>
low concentration throughout the night, or at higher concentrations, as a bolus, at different time<br>
points in the beginning and during the course of the night.<br>

a variety of embodiments and that the foregoing description and examples below are for<br>
purposes of illustration and not limitation of the claims that follow.<br>
EXAMPLE 1:	Synthesis of Benzisoxazole Compounds<br>
A general synthesis of a benzisoxazole piperazine compound is shown in Scheme 1.<br><br>
3-Chloro-l,2-benzisoxazole reacted with excess piperazine in the presence of pyridine<br>
to provide 3-(piperazin-l-yl)benzo[d]isoxazole (3A) in 76 % yield. Reductive amination of<br>
compound (3A) with 2-carbomethoxy 2-methyl propionaldehyde gave alkylated piperazine<br><br>
(4A), which was purified over silica gel. Basic hydrolysis of the methyl ester of (4A) in<br>
aqueous ethanol followed by acidification gave the carboxylic acid (1) as the mono-HCl salt.<br>
Sulfonamide compounds can be synthesized, for example, as shown in Scheme 2:<br><br>
EXAMPLE 2:	Evaluation of Compounds<br>
Sleep in mammals can be divided into sleep occurring during periods of rapid eye<br>
movement (REM), accompanied by substantial brain activity, and periods of non-REM<br>
(NREM) sleep, accompanied by decreased brain activity. Typically, a normal nighttime sleep<br>
period is occupied primarily by NREM sleep, and thus NREM cumulation can serve as a<br>
measure of total sleep cumulation, e.g., significantly decreased NREM can be associated with<br>
insomnia and an accumulation of "sleep debt", e.g., an accumulated physiological need for<br>
sleep that tends to persist until a sufficient amount of additional sleep is accumulated. Thus, an<br>
increase in NREM associated with a treatment can indicated the treatment's effectiveness in<br>
treating insomnia.<br>
Sleep quality can be associated with sleep continuity or sleep maintenance. For<br>
example, a subject with sleep apnea wakes up numerous times during a sleep period, e.g., the<br>
subject has difficulty maintaining continuous sleep. Although such a subject can accumulate a<br>
typical nights length of sleep, e.g., 8 hours, the sleep is unrefreshing due to the waking caused<br>
by the sleep apnea. Thus, an increase in the longest uninterrupted sleep bout (LUSB, also<br>
known as longest sleep bout) associated with a treatment can indicate the treatment's<br>
effectiveness in enhancing sleep continuity, and therefore in treating sleep maintenance<br>
insomnia.<br>
Sleep-wakefulness, locomotor activity and body temperature are monitored in male<br>
Wistar rats treated with a test compound (i.e., benzisoxazole analog) initially at a concentration<br><br><br>
of 10 mg/kg. Higher and lower doses are assayed for select compounds (e.g., as high as 45<br>
mg/kg, and as low as necessary to establish a no-effect dose). Treatments are administered at<br>
CT-18, the peak of the activity dominated period (6 hours after lights-off), and produced<br>
soporific (sleep-inducing) effects characterized by increased non-REM sleep time, increased<br>
sleep continuity, but without evidence of REM sleep inhibition or rebound insomnia.<br>
Sleep-wakefulness, locomotor activity and body temperature were monitored in vivo<br>
with various compounds of the invention. Adult, male Wistar rats (250 g at time of surgery,<br>
Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington MA) were anesthetized (2 % isoflourane in medical<br>
grade oxygen) and surgically prepared with a cranial implant to permit chronic electro-<br>
encephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) recording. Body temperature and<br>
locomotor activity were monitored via a miniature transmitter (Mini-Mitter, Bend, OR)<br>
surgically placed in the abdomen. The cranial implant consisted of stainless steel screws (two<br>
frontal [+3.2 AP from bregma, ±2.0 ML] and two occipital [-6.9 AP, ±5.5 ML]) for EEG<br>
recording. Two Teflon®-coated stainless steel wires were positioned under the nuchal<br>
trapezoid muscles for EMG recording. All leads were soldered to a miniature connector prior<br>
to surgery, and gas sterilized in ethylene oxide. The implant assembly was affixed to the skull<br>
with dental acrylic. A minimum of three weeks was allowed for surgical recovery.<br>
Each rat was permanently housed in its own individual recording cage located within<br>
separate, ventilated compartments of custom- designed stainless steel cabinets. Each cage was<br>
enhanced with a filter-top riser and low-torque swivel-commutator. Food and water were<br>
available ad libitum. A 24-hr light-dark cycle (12 hours light, 12 hours dark) was maintained<br>
throughout the study. Animals were undisturbed for at least 48 hours before and after<br>
treatments.<br>
Sleep and wakefulness were determined using "SCORE-2004™"(Rypnion, Worcester,<br>
MA) - an internet-based sleep-wake and physiological monitoring system. The system<br>
monitored amplified EEG (bandpass 1-30 Hz), integrated EMG (bandpass 10-100 Hz), body<br>
temperature and non-specific locomotor activity (LMA) via telemetry, and drinking activity,<br>
continuously and simultaneously. Arousal states were classified on-line as non-REM (NREM)<br>
sleep, REM sleep, wake, or theta-dominated wake every 10 seconds. Total drinking and<br>
locomotor activity counts, and body temperature were quantitiated and recorded each minute,<br>
using EEG feature extraction and pattern-matching algorithms. From this data, the longest<br>
uninterrupted sleep bout (LUSB)was obtained. The classification algorithm used individually-<br>
taught EEG-arousal-state templates, plus EMG criteria to differentiate REM sleep from theta-<br>
dominated wakefulness, plus behavior-dependent contextual rules (e.g., if the animal was<br><br>
drinking, it is awake). Drinking and locomotor activity intensity (LMA) were recorded every<br>
10 seconds, while body temperature was recorded each minute. Locomotor activity was<br>
detected by a telemetry receiver (Mini-Mitter) beneath the cage. Telemetry measures (LMA<br>
and body temperature) were not part of the scoring algorithm; thus, sleep-scoring and telemetry<br>
data were independent measures.<br>
Compounds were administered at CT-18, the peak of the activity-dominated period,<br>
sufficient time was allowed to view the time course of the treatment effect before lights-on (6<br>
hours post-treatment). Compounds were suspended in sterile 0.25% or 0.5% methylcellulose<br>
(1-2 ml/kg). Treatments were administered orally as a bolus.<br>
A parallel group study design was employed. Vehicle controls were drawn from a large<br>
pool (N&gt; 200): a subset of the pooled vehicle controls was selected, based on computerized<br>
matching with the 24-hour pre-treatment baseline of the active treatment group.<br>
The following pharmacokinetic parameters are computed from the individual plasma<br>
concentrations of the modified benzisoxazole compound using a noncompartmental approach<br>
and appropriate validated pharmacokinetic software (e.g., WinNonlin Professional).<br>
Concentration values reported as BLQ are set to zero. If concentration data are available,<br>
interim calculations are done (non-QC.d data) between periods if possible. Dose escalation<br>
does not depend on pharmacokinetic calculations.<br>
Descriptive statistics, including mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation,<br>
geometric mean, median, minimum and maximum are computed for each pharmacokinetic<br>
parameter by dose group. Descriptive statistics for natural-log transformed AUC(0-t), AUC(0-<br>
inf), and Cmax are provided for each dose level. In addition, mean and median concentration<br>
versus time graphs are provided.<br>
Dose proportionality following study medication is explored by analyzing natural log-<br>
transformed pharmacokinetic variables AUC(O-t), AUC(O-inf), and Cmax with a linear model<br>
including the natural log-transformed dose as covariates. Dose proportionality is concluded if<br>
the 95% confidence interval for the slope of the covariate includes the value of 1. Dose<br>
linearity for AUC(O-t), AUC(0-inf), and Cmax is also explored by a linear model. See, e.g.,<br>
Gibaldi and Perrier, Pharmacokinetics, Second Ed., Marcel Dekker: New York, New York<br>
(1982). Nominal sample collection times were used in calculations, except where actual<br>
sampling times fell outside the protocol-specified acceptable time ranges. The following<br>
parameters are estimated:<br><br><br><br>
Pharmacokinetic analysis is performed using WinNonlin Professional Edition<br>
(Pharsight Corporation, Version 3.3 or 4.1). Descriptive statistics such as mean and standard<br>
deviation are calculated in Microsoft Excel (Version 8.0e).<br>
Metabolism of test articles in monkey and human cryopreserved hepatocytes is assayed<br>
as follows:<br><br><br>
Pre-Incubation Preparation:<br>
Sample is diluted with DMSO, to prepare 100 µM and 10 µM stocks. 0.1% formic acid<br>
in acetonitrile is prepared by the addition of 1 mL formic acid per 1L acetonitrile (store RT for<br>
3 months). 10 minute, 60 and 120 minute 96 well quenching plates are prepared with 150 µL<br>
acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid in each well. Store on ice or refrigerated.<br>
Next, hepatocytes are thawed and 100µL of cell suspension is placed into a microfuge<br>
tube with 100 µL 0.4% Trypan Blue solution and gently mix by inversion. A small amount of<br>
the stained cell suspension (approximately 15 µL) is placed into a clean hemacytometer with a<br>
coverslip. The hemacytometer is placed onto the stage of the microscope and the focus and<br>
power are adjusted until a single counting square fills the field. The number of cells in the four<br>
outside comer subdivided squares of the hemacytometer are counted. Viable cells are<br>
opalescent, round, and pale with a darker outline. Non-viable cells are dark, opaque blue.<br>
The % viability is calculated as the number of viable cells divided by the total of cells<br>
X100.<br>
The viable cell density and total number of viable cells are calculated:<br>
Viable cell Density (D) = Mean 3 of viable cells counted (C) x 104xf2; Total number of<br>
viable cells (E) = Dx 26 (resuspension volume). The additional media required to achieve a<br>
concentration of 1 x 106 cells/mL is calculated:<br>
Volume of additional medium = total viable cells (E) -26 mL<br>
1x106<br>
Cells are diluted accordingly and stored at room temperature.<br>
Incubations<br><br>
198 µL of hepatocytes are transferred to relevant wells on dosing plate. The remaining<br>
hepatocyte suspension is combined and place in a suitable container of near boiling water and<br>
left for 5 minutes to inactivate the cells (for inactive controls and standard curve preparation).<br>
198 µL of inactive hepatocytes are transferred to control wells and 198 µL of blank<br>
media are transferred to buffer control wells. Plates are preincubated for at least 15 min.<br>
Reactions are started 2 µL of appropriate test compound dilution from dosing plate. Plates are<br>
incubated in an incubator set at 37 °C for approximately 10 minutes, then 50 µL of incubate is<br>
removed to 10 a minute quenching plate containing 150 µL acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid and<br>
stored refrigerated or on ice. Following 60 minutes, 50 µL of incubate is removed to 60<br>
minute quenching plate containing 150 uL acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid and stored<br>
refrigerated or on ice. Following 120 minutes, 50 µL of incubate is removed to 120 minute<br>
quenching plate containing 150 uL acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid and stored refrigerated or<br>
on ice. The remaining 50 uL is frozen in incubation plates. Tubes are then centrifuged at ~4°C<br>
at -1400 x g for -10 minutes. 100 µL of supernatant is diluted with 100 µL water in analysis<br>
plates, plates are stored frozen at -20°C prior to analysis.<br>
Preparation of Standard Curves<br>
0.1 µM standard is prepared by the addition of 2 µL of 10 µM dosing solutions to 198<br>
uL of inactive hepatocytes in standard prep plate. 150 µL acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid is<br>
added to the standard quenching plate. 150 uL of 0.1 µM standard is transferred into one<br>
column of a standard plate. 75 µL inactive hepatocytes is added to remaining wells. 75 µL<br>
from 0.1 µM standard is transferred into adjacent well in column in the plate, and mixed well<br>
by titration. Serial dilution is continued. 75 µL is removed from final standard (all wells<br>
contain 75 µL). Plates are incubated at approximately 37 °C for 10 minutes. 50 µL is<br>
transferred into standard quench plate containing 150 µL acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid.<br>
Plates are centrifuged along with samples and dilute supernatant 1:1 with water as above.<br>
Samples are stored frozen at —20 oC.<br>
Sleep parameters for representative compounds are shown below.<br><br><br>
