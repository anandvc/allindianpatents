Field of invention<br>
The invention relates to a multi-stage gravitational barret burner in which the primary heat-input of the oil-fired burner is increased exponentially thereby producing huge Are flame. The burner is a flamed with the combination of gravity oil pressure and heat of the oil-fired burner and this combination helps to get huge continuous fire flame without the use of pump, without any burst risk, without electrical energy and without any instrumental hazard.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
At present the conventional cooking burner is operated by pressure pumping the kerosene oil, which is done manually. This can cause a fire hazard as the possibility of bursting of the burner always exists. Defective instruments can also cause such accidents/hazards, and a smooth and uniform flame is not always available.<br>
Another type of burner is the Gravity burner, which operates with the help of gravitational pressure of the kerosene oil. This burner practically runs only by limited gravitational pressure and thus heat energy production is limited but smooth, uniform and continuous fire flame can be achieved. Moreover, the possibility of the burner bursting does not exist.<br>
Thus, there was a need for a burner which could produce huge, continuous fire flame and at the same time do not pose any burst risk or instrumental hazard and is safe for public use.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a multi-stage Gravitational Barrel Burner which will provide a huge and continuous fire flame.<br><br>
(2)<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a multi-stage Gravitational Barrel Burner, which do not utilize any kind of pump to operate.<br>
It to further object of the invention to provide a multi-stage Gravitational Barrel Burner, which do not require electrical energy for functioning.<br>
It is 9titl further object of the invention to provide a multi-stage Gravitational Barrel Burner, which do not pose any burst risk or suffer from instrumental hazards and is safe for public use.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
According to the invention, there is provided, a multi-stage gravitational barret burner comprising a substantially cylindrical support structure having an outwardly distended upper open portion and an inwardly distended base portion forming there between an internal hollow portion; a plurality pair of clamping slots equidistanify provided on a cylindrical circumferential surface of said substantially cylindrical support structure; at least one pair of tubes defining a flow-passage having a length greater than the diameter of said internal hollow portion projectingly disposed on said plural clamping slots in a spaced-apart parallel relationship, at least two pairs of cylindrical barrels having a length in a matching relationship with said diameter of said internal hollow portion, an upper pair of said at least two pair of barrets encompassing said at least one pair of tubes, the lower pair having an annular hole In a forward front face around a center axis of said substantially cylindrical support structure; an oil-fired burner having at least one jetting nozzle disposed on said base portion, a jetting nozzle disposed on said lower pair of barrels projecting upwardly through said annular hole for jetting a flame; an overhead oil tank disposed at a height higher than the height of the upper pair of said at least two pairs of cylindrical barrels the overhead oil tank<br><br>
(3)<br>
being flowably connected to said oil-fired burner, to said lower pair of barrels and to said one pair of tubes via a tubular network having control means for supply of oil under gravitational pressure; a beaker-shaped member having plural through-holes is disposed below said upper pair of cylindrical barrels for swirling the flue-gas generated by a primary heating of the oil delivered to said lower pair of barrels by said oil-fired burner such that the hot flue-gas extends In the swirling direction to achieve a multi-stage heating of oil interposed in said at least one pair of tubes and in said lower pair of cylindrical barrels thereby exponentially increasing the primary heat-input by said oil-fired burner.<br>
The multi-stage Gravitational Barrel Burner is operated with the combination of gravitational pressure of the oil and heat energy. Heat added to the oil in the tubes of the burner increase the rate of change of oil to oil gas, pressure of the oil gas is created and the oil gas is exhausted through the nozzle which ultimately enables to get smokeless huge fire flame and heat energy. Moreover, in the multhstage Gravitational Barrel Burner, bursting possibility is totally absent as all its components run under gravity pressure, even when the burner is at highest heat production position. Thus the limitation of conventional cooking burner and gravity burner is overcomed. Further, this burner generates smooth, uniform and continuous fire name of at the rate of 1.3 litre per hour.<br>
The multistage Gravitational Barrel Burner of the present invitation operates without any risk, without any manual pump, without air pollution, without instrumental hazard and without electrical expenditure. All the spare parts of this burner are at readymade supply and any person will be able to repair and run by means of replacement and fitting process within few minutes at any time at any place with minimum expenditure. The running, stopping, increasing or minimizing the power of the Gravitational Barrel Burner can be controlled by means of some valves attached to its oil pipe line.<br><br>
(4)<br>
The multi-stage Gravitational Barrel Burner posses extra provision for additional<br>
heat production by additional valves and additional tube burner fittings.<br>
The Gravitational Barrel Burner do not cause any air pollution and can be used<br>
for-	<br>
i) Large scale cooking,	<br>
ii) Large scale boiling,	<br>
iii) Pitch melting and road repairing,<br>
iv) Destroying large amounts of waste materials of hospitals and nursing<br>
homes,<br>
v) Room heating in cold areas,	<br>
vi) Drying of materials.<br>
