				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an improved keyboard for computers, more specifically personal computers. The invention also relates to keyboard for laptop, palmtop  spacecraft, airship etc. where saving in working space is necessary<br>
Keyboard is one of the main parts of a computer, calculators, phones, electronic games, etc. Even though size of chip is shrinking day by day, the size of keyboard has remained same due to functional limitation of width of each key corresponding to one alphanumeric character/symbol/function etc. For operating the keyboard, a user has to press a key of the keyboard, by his fingertips. So each and every key of the keyboard has necessarily to be broader than the width of fingertips, so that pressing key results precisely in entry of a correct signal to a computer etc. If the width of key is smaller than the width of fingers, then on pressing, the finger inadvertently touches and presses the adjacent key also which results into input of wrong signals. So width of a key is generally kept around 1.5 to 2cm so that it could be conveniently and precisely pressed by a fingertip without touching an adjacent key.<br>
OBJECTS OF PRESENT INVENTION<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a keyboard of smaller size<br><br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a keyboard which is though smaller in size, yet accommodates the existing keys of the existing keyboards and also further provides additional keys which could be used for functions assigned to these additional keys.<br>
Still another object of the invention is to provide a keyboard which is though smaller in size yet is able to enter the precise and correct signals to a computer etc.<br>

STATEMENT OF INVENTION<br>
According to this invention, there is provided an improved keyboard provided with keys arranged in a plurality of rows in a known manner, characterised in that: the width of each key is 40-50% of the width of keys in a normal keyboard, each key has a generally rectangular cross section; the width of the key at the top surface being equal to the width at bottom surface; two switches, (Si, S2) are provided for each key (K); the said switches being connected electrically in such a way that when two adjacent keys are pressed simultaneously along their junction, a signal corresponding to the key located towards a predetermined side (X) is generated and is transmitted to the computer; each group of contiguous keys (Ki to K12) in each row of said keys is provided with an additional key (K13) on the side opposite to the said predetermined side (X). Description with reference to drawings;<br>
In accordance with this invention, an improved key-board is provided which enables to reduce the size of keyboard which is necessary where working space is at a premium. The width of each key of the keyboard is reduced to about 40 to 50% of existing size of 1.5 cm to 2 cm of keys of the normal keyboard, preferably to 0.4 to 0.9 cm. The keys have rectangular cross section as compared to trapezoidal cross section of keys of conventional keyboard. This results in reducing the size of the keyboard. The problem of a fingertip touching an adjoining key on pressing, is overcome by providing the construction of keys in such a way that for entering any signal to the computer, two keys are pressed together along the junction line where the two keys meet each other. The switching circuit provided in the invention ensures that signal relating to the key located in predetermined side (which may be left key as shown in drawing or right key for a particular keyboard) goes to the computer.<br><br>
The keys of a conventional key board are placed in a plurality of rows, in which a number of keys in each row form a plurality of contiguous groups. For example, the keys corresponding to Q, W, E, R, T, Y, U, I, O, P, { , } form a contiguous group. To facilitate operation of the last key on the side opposite to predetermined side (i.e right side, which is the key corresponding to "}" in this case) additional key (K13) is provided in each such contiguous group of keys.<br>
To illustrate operation, for entering alphabet "Q", "Q" and "W (Kl, K2) keys are pressed together along the junction of two keys i.e. along the line where the two keys meet each other. Similarly, to enter "W, "W and "E" keys (K2, K3) are pressed together along the junction of two keys and so on. Even if two keys are pressed down together, only one signal corresponding to the key on the predetermined side (left key in this case) is generated. Width of each key is 40-50% of the normal key. Yet as two keys are pressed simuUaneously along their junction, the combined width of two keys is adequate for operation by fingers. This reduction in size of each individual key of the keyboard, enables accommodating of more keys, in addition to the existing keys and at the same time enables reduction in overall size of the keyboard. The reduction in size of the key is realized by providing either two switches (Si, S2) per key or by providing two transistors (Ti, T2) per key of the key board in such a maimed that when two keys are pressed down together along their junction, only one signal is generated and enters as input to the computer.<br><br>
I CLAIM;<br>
1.	An improved keyboard provided with keys arranged in a plurality<br>
of rows in a known manner <br>
characterised in that:<br>
the width of each key is 0.4 to 0.9 cm,<br>
each key has rectangular cross section; the width of the key at the top surface being equal to the width at bottom surface;<br>
two switches, (SI, S2) are provided for each key (K); the said switches being connected electrically in such a way that when two adjacent keys are pressed simultaneously along their junction, a signal corresponding to the key locked towards a predetermined side (X) is generated and is transmitted to the computer;<br>
each group of contiguous keys (Kl to K12) in each row of said keys is provided with an additional key (K13) on the side opposite to the said predetermined side (X)<br>
2.	An improved keyboard as claimed in claim 1, wherein the said<br>
switches are transistors (Tl, T2) connected in series and are<br>
triggered by pressing of the said key (K); two said transistors (Tl,<br>
T2) being triggered on pressing two adjacent keys simultaneously;<br>
the said two transistors when triggered transmit to the computer<br>
the signal corresponding to the key (K) located towards said<br>
predetermined side.<br><br>
3.	An improved keyboard as claimed in claim 1, wherein each pair of<br>
two adjacent keys (Ki, K2) is preferably marked with the<br>
alphanumeral (Q) corresponding to the key (ki) located towards the<br>
predetermined side (X), such that the centre line of said<br>
alphanumeral (Q) coincides with junction line of the said keys (Ki,<br>
K2).<br>
4.	An improved keyboard substantially as herein described and<br>
illustrated in the accompanying drawings.</td>
