FAULT LOCATOR AND ANALYSER EQUIPMENT FOR HVDC<br>
LINES<br>
The invention is the equipment LINE FAULT LOCATOR SYSTEM FOR HVDC POWER TRANSMISSION lines, is meant for testing and detecting fault location and preventive maintenance of, long HDVC transmission lines with length upto 2000km* It can detect the various kinds of developed and developing faults along the length of HVDC transmission line.<br>
The equipment consists of 2 parts:<br>
LFault locator part of the system:<br>
This part of the system is used when a particular HVDC line being tested has tripped due to a fault. This part of the system detects the distance of fault from the point of testing in kilometers in the LCD display (Refer sl.no. 6/SKETCH 1). It also indicates the nature of fault, (i.e) OPEN type or SHORT type of fault, by operating the switch FAULT TYPE (Refer sl.no.3/SKETCH 1).<br>
2.The Analyser part of the system:<br>
The Analyser unit when connected to the HVDC lines gives all the various developing faults along the length of the line in kilometers, in the form of a hard copy print out. There are four formats of print outs representing these various kinds of faults in a variety of user friendly formats. It is also possible to monitor the condition of the line, dynamically by means of the provided graphic LCD display module. Since this part of the system is used for preventive maintenance of HVDC lines it is used generally when the line is healthy. This instrument also gives the degree of damage in 9 discrete levels (0 to 8). This degree of damage helps in giving priorities during maintenance. It is possible to decide on the points of fault which have to be repaired before going to other points of smaller faults.<br>
This system is a comprehensive testing instrument for faults on HVDC lines with which it is possible to detect faults on occurrence of a fault and to as well maintain the line during maintenance to prevent occurrence of failure faults, thereby improving the reliability, availability and performance of the HVDC lines avoiding sporadic failures and saving lot of revenue by reducing the number of hours of outages.<br><br>
EXISTING EQUIPMENTS AND THEIR DISADVANTAGES<br>
The invention is for overcoming the problems and disadvantages of the existing in the method of fault location and fault analysis on HVDC lines. A study on the various types of faults that can occur on the HVDC lines was made. Having been arrived at the list of faults that can occur on HVDC lines, it was analysed that which of these faults could not be detected with the existing system . Hence we arrived at the list of faults that the existing system could not detect.<br>
The list of faults are:<br>
1.	Open circuit fault<br>
2.	Pole to earth fault<br>
3.	Resistive contact jumper<br>
4.	Decapping fault<br>
5.	Low insulation of insulators<br>
6.	Outside object coming in close vicinity to the conductor<br>
7.	Earth wire hanging close to the conductor<br>
8.	Lightning arrestor failure<br>
9.	Failure of PLCC capacitor and other filter capacitor which are connected across the line.<br>
10.	conductor oversagging<br>
11.	High induction from the adjacent charged multicircuit lines.<br>
12.	Fault on spur lines to the main line.<br>
The existing systems were generally of the type that are connected permanently to the HVDC lines . They came into operation only after the fault had occurred and the line had tripped due to the fault. And these indicated only some of the dead faults such as pole to earth . But practically they were found to be poor in accuracy and fault finding involved rigorous patrolling of the line. Further once a line had tripped and rectified(the fault at that point) there was no means for rechecking the fault without charging the line(faults occurred in any other points could not be checked by the existing system).But it is a known fact that charging a faulty line is dangerous for both the system as well as the HVDC line connected to it. As it caused a lot more damage than the fault itself.<br><br>
Secondly it is not possible again to check the line after rectification of the fault for proper repair and to determine whether there are no multiple faults on the line other than the one rectified. Finally these ONLINE systems are only for fault detection after occurrence of a fault. They give no data on the presence of other developing faults on the line. Hence it is not possible to undertake preventive maintenance on these lines with these types of fault locators. These ONLINE fault locators have not been able to find all the kinds of faults highlighted above making them non-comprehensive tool for fault location and detection of developed and developing faults on HVDC lines. Moreover, the existing system is laborious, time consuming and not cost effective.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
THE INVENTION<br>
The object of this invention is to detect the faults that may occur on the HVDC lines* The faults that may occur may be categorized into 12 types of faults.<br>

3)	Insulator Decapping<br>
4)	Low Insulation of Insulators<br><br>
5)	Lightening Arrestor Failure<br>
6)	PLCC Capacitor Failure<br>
7)	Conductor Sagging<br>
7) Resistive Contact for Jumper<br>
9)	Outside object coming in contact or very near vicinity of the line<br>
10)	Earth Wire close to the conductors<br>
11)	High Induction from adjacent charged Multi circuit line 12) Fault on Sour Lines to the main line<br><br>

Dedicated computer software is provided to load the signature of the line and analyse all aspects regarding the non-homogeneity of the line.<br>
It is also possible to view the signature of the line dynamically in the graphic LCD display.<br><br>
HEAVY DUTY ADOPTER UNIT:<br>
This equipment is connected in between fault locator or analyser and transmission line. This equipment houses the transmitter and line matching unit and it also houses the filters to suppress HVDC switching noise namely, electrical switching noise. It produces enough power to illuminate a 2000km transmission line to get return which are above noise level to the sending end, for which the Adopter has all necessary controls.<br>
POWER SUPPLY CUM DIGITAL SIMULATOR UNIT:<br>
This unit houses a maintenance free battery and necessary charging unit from mains. It has in -built simulator for in house testing of the Fault locator unit and the Analyser unit.<br><br>
POWER LINE FAULT LOCATOR UNIT: (SKETCH 1)<br>
The Powerline fault locator unit consists of the following controls:<br>
1.     SET POWER:<br>
(REFER SL. NO. 1)<br>
This consists of a rotating switch, which can be set in three positions. Namely<br>
1.	LOW POSITION<br>
2.	NORMAL POSITION<br>
3.	HIGH POSITION<br>
The respective positions are selected depending on the length of the HVDC line required to be tested for finding the fault. By keeping the control in LOW position it is possible to test the faults occurring at any point within 100 km s of the line. For testing the faults between l00 kms and 2000 kms on the HVDC lines the NORMAL or HIGH position is selected.<br>
2. POWER ON:<br>
(REFER SL. No.2)<br>
The function of this switch is as follows.<br>
This switch when put to 'ON' position switches on the power to the equipment. The power to this equipment is got from a 12 volts 26 Ah dry fit maintenance free battery housed in the POWER SUPPLY/SIMULATOR UNIT.<br>
This 12 volts got from the POWER SUPPLY/ SIMULATOR UNIT is connected to the Fault locator unit through the power switch. In the Fault locator unit this 12 volts is converted to suitable voltages necessary to operate the system. This 12 volts is got in to the Fault locator unit from the 12 pin connector present on the Fault locator unit (Reference No. 9 in the figure.)<br><br>
3.   FAULT TYPE<br>
(REFER SL. NO. 3)<br>
This is an important part of the invention. By operating this it is possible to ascertain the type of faults that has occurred on the HVDC lines.<br>
This is a rotating switch having three positions marked<br>
1.	SET<br>
2.	OPEN<br>
3.	SHORT<br>
In SET position it is possible to ascertain the distance of fault. From the OPEN and<br>
SHORT position of the switch it is possible to ascertain whether the fault that has<br>
occurred is of OPEN type such as<br>
JUMPER OPEN, (dead fault)<br>
CONDUCTOR CUT (dead fault)<br>
LOOSE JUMPERS,<br>
DECAPPING OPEN VARIETY AND RESISTIVE CONTACT OF JUMPER<br>
or SHORT type such as<br>
POLE TO EARTH FAULT,<br>
DECAPPING SHORT VARIETY,<br>
EARTH WIRE HANGING CLOSE TO CONDUCTOR,<br>
LIGHTINING ARRESTOR FAILURE,<br>
COUPLING CAPAPCITOR FAILURE,<br>
OUTSIDE OBJECT COMING CLOSE TO VICINITY OF THE CONDUCTOR,<br>
LOW INSULATION OF INSUALTORS,<br>
AND CONDUCTOR SAGGING.<br>
If the fault distance appearing in SET position continues to appear in OPEN position and does not appear in SHORT position then the fault is termed as OPEN type of fault. It could be due to one of the above mentioned types of faults under OPEN category.<br>
If the fault distance appearing in SET position continues to appear in SHORT position and does not appear in OPEN position then the fault is termed as SHORT type of fault. It could be due to one of the above mentioned types of faults under SHORT category.<br><br>
4.   SET FAULT:<br>
(REFER SL. NO. 4)<br>
This is one of the most important and crucial aspects of the invention. A fault may occur at any point in the entire length of 2000km of the HVDC lines. The invention enables to fix the point of fault with accurate precision using the SET fault, so that the remedial measures can be taken at the point where the fault has occurred. The invention not only enables to fix the point of fault but also enables the same to be carried out in seconds, thus saving valuable time which is crucial when a fault occurs in the lines. It not only saves time but also saves lot of revenue in crores of rupees to the electrical utility.<br>
The SET FAULT is a ten turn potentiometer. The invention also includes a switch which can be set to LOW or HIGH position, while using the SET FAULT. Normally the SET FAULT is operated by keeping the switch in LOW position. If no reading appears on the LCD display (REFER SL. NO. 6).THIS ITSELF IS AN INVENTIONthe switch is changed to HIGH position. As the SET fault is turned in the clockwise direction the reading will appear on the LCD display to indicate at what point or distance of line the fault has occurred. For example, if a fault has occurred at a point, which is 100.1 km from the starting point of the line, this is indicated in the LCD display. This figure will not change even if the SET FAULT is rotated further; thus it is possible to find the place of fault on the lines with absolute precision. This operation is not only accurate but also is easy to operate by even laymen. Once the place of fault is known as indicated in the LCD display, remedial measures will be taken without loss of time. Thus the invention is accurate, time and revenue saving and easy to operate and depending on the type of fault it also helps to save precious life of human beings or cattle which may be affected by fault occurring in the HVDC lines. The fault as seen on the LCD display can be noted down for future use.<br>
SET FAULT can also be used while using the SIMULATOR for in-house testing. The SET FAULT has two more features namely OVERSET and FAULT SET.  If the SET FAULT is not operated properly the OVERSET will glow to indicate the same. The FAULT SET will start glowing to indicate that the point of fault is about to be displayed and thus the operator is alerted.<br>
5a)   SET BLANKING;<br>
(REFER SL.NO. 5)<br>
The SET BLANKING is another innovative aspect of the invention. By using this it is possible to detect the fault at any desired length of the HVDC line and blank the<br><br>
length of the line where there is no need for the test of the faults. This is further explained as follows.<br>
The HVDC lines runs through thousands of kms from the starting point to the end point. In case the line develops multiple faults along its length without the above feature it is only possible to see one fault, that is, the first fault the closest fault to the testing point. It might not be possible to see beyond this fault for multiple faults. So by having this feature it is possible to blank this fault reading to search for multiple faults on the line.<br>
For example, say we are testing a line of length 1500kms. Suppose a fault reading of 100 kms appears in the FAULT LOCATOR. It is not possible to test the line from 100 kms to 1500 kms for faults. So by blanking the reading of 100 kms by using the ten turn blanking potentiometer and selecting the corresponding position on the BLANKING DISTANCE switch (REFER SL. NO.7) it is possible to blank the distance of 100 kms and check for other faults from lOOkms to 1500kms. Further this blanking facility is very useful for lines having spur line to the main line(that is T-offs)<br>
5b) SCAN ON/OFF<br>
This switch helps in scanning every 3 kms of the line, in the LCD DISPLAY.<br>
6)	41/2 DIGIT LCD DISPLAY<br>
This LCD display displays the fault distance in kms.<br>
7)	BLANKING DISTANCE:<br>
This switch is a 6-position switch marked 0km, 400km, 800km, 1200km, 1600km and 2000km. Each position indicates the starting distance of blanking and further 400 km of blanking is got from the SET BLANKING POT.<br>
8)	POWER:<br>
This switches on power to the instrument on connecting the 12 pin output connector to either the power supply/simulator unit's 12 pin connector for simulated testing or by connecting it to the adopter's unit 12 pin connector and connecting the power supply simulator unit's 5 pin pig tail connector to the adopter unit's 5 pin connector for testing HVDC lines.<br>
9)	TO ADOPTER:<br>
This 12 pin connector is connected to the 12 pin socket on the POWER SUPPLY/SIMULATOR unit for simulated testing. This 12 pin connector is connected to the 12 pin connector socket on the adopter for testing HVDC lines.<br><br>
TESTING OF SPUR LINES<br>
For testing lines with spur lines it is necessary to have previous healthy line results. For a healthy line the readings indicated by the Fault locator are<br>
1.	Joint of Spur to the main line<br>
2.	Spur line end<br>
3.	Main line end<br>
So, to test a spur line, it is necessary to have the above three readings of the line, when the line is healthy.<br>
For example,<br>
Consider a line of length 40 km having a spur of 10 km at a distance of 20 km on the main line.<br><br>
Now consider the above line during healthy conditions.<br>
Now to test this line, keep the Set power switch in normal position, Set Fault pot fully anti clockwise position and Set fault switch in LOW position. Select ON position in the POWER switch (reference No. 8). Put the Blanking ON/OFF Switch to ON position. Set the ten turns Blanking pot too fully anti clockwise position. Now increase the SET FAULT pot, so as to get the point of Spur joint in the display. To get this reading the Fault set pot has to be set to a level higher than that normally required. Next turn the ten turn Blanking pot in the clockwise direction until the above reading just disappears from the display. Further, set the Fault set pot to get the next closer reading, that being the Spur line end, that is, 20 km + 10 km = 30 km. This indicates that the fault has occurred at the spur end.<br>
Now turn the ten turn Blanking pot further, to remove the above reading of 30 km. Then set the Fault set pot to get the next higher reading of 40 km, which is the end of the Main line. Note the above three readings for future reference.<br><br>
NOTE:<br>
Spur joint reading always appears in short position of the Fault type switch. Whereas the Main line end and Spur line end appear in either open or short position, depending on the type of end termination.<br>
POSSIBILITIES OF FAULTS ON SPUR LINES:<br>
There are three points on a spur line where faults could occur.<br>
1.	Between testing end and spur joint<br>
2.	Between spur joint and Main end<br>
3.	Between the spur joint and spur end<br>
Testing case 1 type of faults:<br>
For faults between testing end and spur joint the fault distance is directly got on the display as the first result and with further Blanking it will not be possible to get the spur joint, spur line end and main line end readings.<br>
Testing case 2 type of faults:<br>
The faults between the spur joint and Main end, following the above procedure, first the spur joint is got. After Blanking the spur joint the spur end is got. After Blanking the spur end the fault point is got and it is not possible to get the main end<br>
Testing case 3 type of faults:<br>
For faults between the spur joint and spur end, following the above procedure, first the spur joint is got. After Blanking the spur joint the point of fault is got. After Blanking the point of fault the main line end is got, indicating that the fault is between the spur joint and spur end.<br><br>
FINDING DECAPPING FAULTS IN POWER LINES<br>
The line fault locator may be used to find decapping faults in transmission lines, where the line is hanging in the air without touching ground.<br>
PROCEDURE<br>
Now connect the fault locator to the lines as indicated previously<br>
Now get the fault readings of the line. If the fault locator under normal setting shows the end of the line then it is presumed that line conductor is upto the end and it is not snapped any where or it is not touching earth any where .Then it could be presumed that a decapping fault may exist on the lines. First get the end reading of the line by turning the Fault set pot in the clockwise direction. Now after getting the end reading turn the Fault set pot further from the previous setting to see if any other readings other than the end of the line appears. If any reading do appear note these readings, then this may be a decapping fault. This fault distance could appear either in short or open positions of the fault locator depending on the nature of decapping.<br><br>
POWER LINE SIGNATURE ANALYSER (SKETCH 2)<br>
1.        POWER ON:<br>
This switches on the power to the equipment, when the 12 pin connector on the analyser is connected to either the adopter for testing of the HVDC lines or to the 12 pin connector on the power supply or simulator unit for testing in-house.<br>
2a. MODE FIXED/DELAYED: This toggle switch is used to select whether we want the signature of a particular length of the line(DELAYED) or the full length of the line(FIXED).<br>
2b. INITIAL DELAY: This facility is provided so that any part of the line could be moved in to the center of the LINE VISION DISPLAY(SL.NO. 2) and viewed dynamically and with better resolution.<br>
2c. SET: This INITIAL DELAY is achieved by this 10 turn potentiometer and a six position switch marked 0 km to 1600 km. When the line length to be viewed is between 400km to 800km then the SET has to be kept in 400km. If the line length to be viewed is 1200km to 1600km then the SET has to be kept in 1200km. Hence this enables the viewing of every 400km of the line in the display. This choice of the length being selected for viewing in the LINE VISION DISPLAY is displayed in a 41/2 digit LCD display (SL.NO. 3) for better clarity.<br>
3a. SET GAIN: This potentiometer is slowly turned in clockwise direction to get the fault readings on the display.<br>
3b. AUTO/MANUAL: If MANUAL is selected and the SET GAIN pot is set so as to set the reflection from the end of the line to view in full screen on the display.<br>
3c. AUTO GAIN: If AUTO is selected in the AUTO/MANUAL switch the AUTO GAIN switch is put to one of the 6 positions marked 1 to 6 (six positions denotes the level of clarity of the signature in the chronological order), the line is viewed in the full screen on the display.<br>
This selection helps in comparitive study of the developing faults on the line. For<br>
example, if we take a signature today and take another signature a month later, it is<br>
possible to take both the signature with the same gain settings. That is, position 1 to<br>
6.<br>
Taking signature in same settings helps in determining whether a developing faults<br>
on the line has increased in level from its previous value.<br>

Since the transmission lines are tested for faults offline it is necessary to illuminate the lines for two purposes. They are as follows,<br>
1.	to locate the fault by using the Power line Fault locator unit,<br>
2.	to ascertain the signature (the characteristics of the line) using the Power line<br>
signature Analyser unit.<br>
The Adopter unit is connected between<br>
The Fault locator unit and the transmission line<br>

WORKING OF THE INVENTION<br>
Take the POWERLINE FAULT LOCATOR SYSTEM near the HVDC lines to be tested.<br>
Now ground the HVDC lines with the EARTH GOS.<br>
Select    a    good    station    ground.    Take    care    to    see    that    the grounding is proper.<br>
Now connect the other end of the Grounding Clamp to the Heavy duty adopter's(SKETCH3)two Earth terminals(SLNo.6/SKETCH 3). Now connect the Heavy duty Adopter's 12 pin connector mounted on epoxy base( Sl.No.7) to the end of the hook sticks with a 12 pin plug provided. Connect the hook rod to the HVDC line.<br>
Now interconnect the Power supply cum simulator unit(SKETCH 4) and the Heavy Duty Adopter unit with the 5 pin pigtail connector provided on the Power Supply cum Simulator unit.<br>
Now connect the Power line Fault locator unit(SKETCH 1) with the Adopter unit with the 12 pin connector provided(Sl.No.9/SKETCH 1). Then make all initial settings on both the Adopter unit and the Power line Fault locator unit depending on the line length.<br>
The initial settings of the Power line Fault locator unit are as follows.<br>
i) SET POWER - NORMAL<br>
ii) FAULT TYPE - SET<br>
iii) ROTARY POWER SWITCH - ON<br>
iv) BLANKING - OFF<br>
v) SET FAULT POT - FULLY ANTI-CLOCKWISE<br>
vi) GAIN LOW / HIGH - LOW<br>
The initial settings of the Adopter (SKETCH 3) are as follows :-<br>
i)	POWER - Depending on line length.<br>
ii)        FILTER ON / OFF - ON<br>
The initial settings of the Power supply cum Simulator unit (SKETCH 4) are<br>
as follows :-<br>
i)	MCB   -ON<br>
ii)        Power - ON<br>
Now open the grounding of the HVDC LINE by opening the earth GOS.<br><br>
Now switch the 'POWER ON' switch in the Powerline Fault locator to 'ON Position'.<br>
Now turn the SET FAULT pot so as to get a reading in the 41/2 digit LCD display such that the reading in the display changes from 1888.8 to a   fixed reading.<br>
Note the reading. Similarly put the SET Fault switch to 'Open' and 'Short' positions and note the corresponding readings.<br>
This distance is the distance of fault in a faulty line or is the length of line in a healthy line.<br>
The type of fault is determined from the reading obtained in the OPEN &amp; SHORT positions. If the reading in open position is same as SET position the fault is said to be OPEN CURCUIT fault or if it is otherwise it is said to be earth fault.<br>
For connecting the Power line Signature Analyser (SKETCH 2) to the line, disconnect the connection between the Adopter and the Power line Fault locator unit at the fault locator end. Connect this 12 pin connector from the Adopter to the 12 pin connector (socket) on the Power line Signature Analyser (Sl.No. 15/SKETCH<br>
2).<br>
Now put the Analyser's (SKETCH 2) Print / Display switch (Sl.No. 4/SKETCH 2) to display mode. Select suitable button on the Analyser to match the end of the line so as to obtain the end of the line reflection in the display. Now select Manual / Auto switch Sl.No. 3b/Sketch 2) to 'Manual' position. Set the SET GAIN (Sl.No. 3a) pot from fully anticlockwise to clockwise so as to make the end of line reflection to just reach full screen.<br>
Now put the PRINT / DISPLAY switch (Sl.No. 4) to 'Print' Position and press and release the 'RESET' (Sl.No. 5) button and then the Transmit / Store button( Sl.No.<br>
7).<br>
Now the line signature gets loaded into the Analyser and the end readings are displayed in Line vision display(Sl. No. 16).<br>
Now use the other 4 buttons marked 'Highlights'(Sl.No. 8), 4Signature'(Sl.No.9), 'Scan'(SLNo.lO) &amp; 'Map'(Sl.No. 11) buttons to get their corresponding prints on the printer.<br>
Before getting printout it is necessary to connect the 2 pig tail cables from the Analyser to Printer Port Cable and Printer Power input to the printer. Then switch on the 'Printer On' switch in the Analyser to 'ON' position.<br>
Connect the printer port cable to the computer parallel port using the cable provided and press COMPUTER STORE (Sl.No.12/SKETCH 2). Ten results are taken automatically from the Power line Signature Analyser unit and stored in the computer. The computer Software analyses these 10 sets of readings and gives out all the salient points on the line removing all other noise present on the line.<br><br>
Explanation of the faults occurring on HDVC lines and how they are indicated by our instrument HT-1720-APEXD<br>
I.OPEN CIRCUIT FAULT:<br>
a)	EXPLANATION OF THE FAULT:<br>
In the case of open circuit faults the HDVC lines conductor cuts in the middle and hangs in the air without coming in contact with either the tower or the earth beneath .This can be of 2 types<br>
1.	Conductor cutting<br>
2.	Jumper snapping<br>
1.Conductor cutting:<br>
Due to various reasons the conductor itself can get cut. Thereby breaking the electrical path.<br>
2 Jumper snapping:<br>
Approximately for every kilometer a jumper is used to connect conductors along the length of the line. These jumpers are clamped at both ends to the conductor by means of clamps and bolts. In case any of these clamps or bolts give way they result in the jumper hanging in the air creating an open circuit fault.<br>
b)	INDICATIONS IN OUR INSTRUMENT:<br>
Powerline Fault locator unit:<br>
This instrument indicates the variety of fault as a distance in kms.<br>
Example:-<br>
LINE LENGTH - 100km<br>
OPEN CIRCUIT - 35km<br>
SET	OPEN	SHORT<br>
35	35		<br><br>
In the above example the line is of length 100km with a fault of open circuit at 35 kms. The instrument Indicates the distance of fault in the SET position and the type of fault is determined depending on whether the reading corresponding to SET position appears in either OPEN or SHORT position. Since in the above example it appears in OPEN position the fault is said to be the OPEN CIRCUIT FAULT and at a distance of 35kms.<br>
CONCLUSION:-<br>
This kind of OPEN circuit fault can be detected by the fault locator part of instrument.<br>
The example of the OPEN CIRCUIT FAULT when the line is connected to the POWER LINE SIGNATURE ANALYSER unit is as follows:<br>
As explained earlier the Power line Signature Analyser gives the output in four formats.<br>
1.	HIGHLIGHTS:<br>
This gives all the faulty points on the line as well as the end of the line with their degree of damage at that point of fault(in the line) in kilometers.<br>
2.	SCAN<br>
This gives a raw printout of the signature of the line in numeric form. In this printout each " - " represents 100 meters. Hence each line of the printout represents 10 kms. Each point of fault is represented by a train of numbers(0 to 8). The point of fault is the centre of this train of numbers.<br>
3.	MAP<br>
This is the graphical representation of the scan.<br>
4.	SIGNATURE<br>
This is a sophisticated scan print. The point of fault is pinpointed in this format.<br><br>
OPEN CIRCUIT FAULT:<br>
Our transmission of pulse from the equipment is in the form of an inverted 'Y' This pulse travels along the length of the line and if it faces an open circuit during its travel along the length of the line it reflects back as a inverted 'Y' from the point of open circuit. This point of open circuit could either be the far end of the line kept open or dead open circuit fault along the length of the line. If the reflection is from the end of the line it is the distance in the highlights ,signature ,scan and map will be the length of the line, else, if it is a fault along the length of the line, then the distance indicated in the map, signature, scan, highlights will be equal to the distance of fault from the point of testing in kilometers.<br>
EXAMPLE:<br>
Let us consider a line of length 350km. Suppose the end of the line is kept open, then the output got from the signature analyser unit (that is signature, scan, highlights, map) will be as follows in the following pages. The end of the line is kept open and it is signified by an inverted Y. The line is healthy and we have the end of the line signifying open circuit.<br>

CHART 2 - SCAN CHART 3 - SCAN<br>
CHART 4 - HIGHLIGHTS<br>
CHART 5 - SIGNATURE CHART 6 - SIGNATURE<br><br>
SHORT CIRCUIT FAULT:<br>
Our transmission of pulse from the equipment is in the form of an inverted 'Y'. This pulse travels along the length of the line and if it faces a SHORT circuit during its travel along the length of the line it reflects back as a 'Y' from the point of SHORT circuit. This point of SHORT circuit could either be the far end of the line kept short or short circuit fault along the length of the line. If the reflection is from the end of the line, it is the distance in the highlights, signature, scan and map will be the length of the line, else, if it is a fault along the length of the line, then the distance indicated in the map, signature, scan, highlights will be equal to the distance of fault from the point of testing in kilometers.<br>

CHART 8 -   SCAN CHART 9 - SCAN<br>

CHART 11 - SIGNATURE CHART 12 - SIGNATURE<br><br>
INSULATOR FAULT :<br>
Since our pulse transmission is in the form of an inverted 'Y' any change in homogenity at any point along the length of the line depending on the impedance change can either be 'Y' or an inverted 'Y\ If the impedance at any point of reflection is lower than the characteristic impedance of the line then the reflection from that point will be in the form of a *Y' or if it is higher than the characteristic impedance then it is an inverted *YComing to insulators aspect it is found that in a string of insulators a few of insulators can develop low insulation causing power leaks at that point. This point of power leakage are detectable from our signature* The impedance change caused by these failed insulators is of very low values. These are detectable by the equipment only when we go to very high gain settings such as auto gain 5,6 ((3c) SKETCH 2) and it is found in most of the cases that these points appear as inverted *Y% i.e., open type. As they do not affect the characteristic impedance at that point, so as to bring it below the value of characteristic impedance of the line.<br>

CHART 18 - SIGNATURE	CHART 24-SIGNATURE<br><br>
CONCLUSION:<br>
As the arm of the "Y" is pointing towards open side in the MAP, the distances of developing fault have to be taken from the open side in the Highlights. Hence, the points 40.8, 42.9 and 244.7 are the pints of developing fault, with degree of fault 3. The degree indicates the intensity of damage of the line at that point( If the damage is "8" it is presumed to be a dead fault).<br><br>
OPEN CIRCUIT:  LOOSE JUMPER<br>
In case of a loose jumper the overall series resistance of the conductor increases at the point of loose jumper along the line. As our pulse travels along the length of the line and when it arrives at the point of loose jumper it faces a change in homogenity causing major part of the pulse to reflect back from that point. The remaining point of the pulse travels to the end of the line and gets reflected back from the end of the line. Since the pulse has weakened, the end reflection will be lower in level compared to that reflected from the point of loose jumper. This reflected pulse will be in the form of an inverted "Y".<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
