ORIGIGNAL<br>
811/MUM/2004<br>
30-7-2004<br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the synthesis of pharmaceutically active 2,2'-iminobisethanol derivative i.e., 2H-1-benzopyran-2-methanol, a, a' -iminobis (methylene)] bis [6-fluoro-3,4-dihydro-, [2R*[R*[R*(S*)]]J] i.e., nebivolol or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, more particularly hydrochloride salt (I).<br><br>
(i)<br>
Nebivolol is useful in the treatment and prevention of coronary vascular disorders.<br>
The present invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions and process for the preparation of a solid oral dosage form of nebivolol hydrochloride of formula (I), without the use of wetting agent, and optionally using binder and /or disintegrant.<br>
The present invention further provides a new polymorphic form of nebivolol hydrochloride. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Beta-blockers are used for the treatment of high blood pressure, control of angina, arrhythmia, post myocardial infection, heart failure, migraine or essential tremor.<br>
Nebivolol is a highly selective beta-1 blocker and has been found to be useful for the management of hypertension. Hypertension (high blood pressure) is a significant health risk affecting more than 500 million people across the world and needs long-term therapy for its management.<br>
Chemically nebivolol is 2,2'-iminobisethanol derivative i.e., 2H-1-benzopyran-2-methanol, oc,oc'-[iminobis (methylene)] bis[6-fluoro-3,4-dihydro-, [2R*[R*[R*(S*)]]]]. EP 744 946 B1 discloses nebivolol to be a mixture of equal<br><br>
amounts of 2 enantiomers having respectively the SRRR- and the RSSS-configuration.<br>
Methods for preparation of nebivolol are disclosed in EP-0145067 and EP-0334429. EP 0145067 B1 describes a process for the conversion of 6-fluoro-3,4-dihydro-2H-1-benzopyran-2-carboxaldehyde (VI) into isomeric mixtures of 6-fluoro-3, 4-dihydro-2-oxiranyl-2H-1-benzopyran (VII). This reaction entails the use of sodium hydride as the base, which is extremely hazardous. Further, purity of the product, i.e., 6-fluoro-3, 4-dihydro-2-oxiranyl-2H-1-benzopyran (VII) obtained by using sodium hydride is low and is found to be around 62-65 %, which is unacceptable. The mixture of oxiranes represented by the formula (VII) are separated by column chromatography as shown in Scheme (I) to obtain A-isomer of (VII) (i.e., Vll-A) from the first fraction and B-isomer of (VII) (i.e., Vll-B) from the second fraction.<br><br>
The A-isomer of (VII) is then treated with benzylamine to obtain the benzylated A-isomer of (VII) (i.e., Intermediate I), which is reacted with the B-isomer in presence of oxalic acid to obtain the oxalate salt of benzylated nebivolol (Vlll-a), as shown in Scheme - II.<br>
Furthermore, the oxalate salt (Vlll-a) as obtained has to be treated with an alkali to obtain the free benzylated nebivolol base (VIII).<br><br>
Scheme- II<br><br>
Thus, as can be seen from Scheme II, the reaction between lntermediate-1 and (Vll-B) involves purification by column chromatography, and subsequent treatment with oxalic acid to form the oxalate salt. Treatment with oxalic acid<br><br>
results in the separation of the undesired (RSRR + SRSS) diastereomers from the desired (RSSS + SRRR) isomers, due to a difference in solubilities between the desired and the undesired isomers. Further, the oxalic acid salt has to be converted to the free benzylated nebivolol base by treatment with an alkali. The multiple steps in the process make it cumbersome and lead to increase in utilities and in the manufacturing time cycle of the active pharmaceutical ingredient. Moreover the purity of the free benzylated nebivolol base is also found to be relatively low.<br>
EP 334429 B1 discloses a process for the preparation of specifically the RSSS isomer of nebivolol independently. The said process for the independent preparation of RSSS nebivolol involves the use of hazardous reagents like thionyl chloride, sodium hydride and di-isobutyl aluminium hydride (DIBAL), expensive optically active reagents like (+)-1,2,3,4,4a,9,10,10a-octahydro-1,4a-dimethyl-7-(1 -methylethyl-1 -phenathrenemethanamine[(+)-dehydroabiethylamine] and utilities like column chromatography and low temperatures. The processes also involve a large number of steps thereby increasing in utilities, manpower and time required to complete the production cycle, rendering the process commercially expensive.<br>
Furthermore, EP 744946B1 describes a process for obtaining nebivolol hydrochloride from a mixture containing the desired (RSSS + SRRR) nebivolol base contaminated by the undesired (RSRR + SRSS) diastereomers, using ethanol as both the reaction as well as the recrystallization solvent. The major disadvantage of the said process is that it uses impure nebivolol base as the starting material containing different isomeric impurities, and thereby results in a very low yield (6.6 %) of the desired isomers (having the SRRR- and the RSSS-configuration) of nebivolol hydrochloride. Moreover, ethanol is a solvent that can be used only in controlled quantities due to stringent regulatory requirements, and therefore its use on an industrial scale is limited.<br>
Thus, there exists a need for developing a method for the synthesis of the desired diastereomeric mixture of higher purity with the reduction of undesirable<br><br>
isomeric impurities and eliminating the use of hazardous sodium hydride, while at the same time reducing the process steps in the synthesis of nebivolol.<br>
It has been surprisingly found that the process of synthesizing nebivolol in accordance with the process of the present invention not only increases the purity of the desired diastereomeric mixture in a minimum number of process steps but also eliminates the use of hazardous chemicals in the process.<br>
Nebivolol is mainly used for the treatment and prevention of coronary vascular disorders. It is taken once or twice a day as per the requirement of the patient.<br>
EP 0744946 discloses pharmaceutical compositions of nebivolol where the drug is in micronized form and with the addition of one or more wetting agents specifically polysorbates as an adjuvant. This patent emphasizes the need of micronization and further wetting as the oral administration of nebivolol hydrochloride is impeded by the poor dissolution when in a normal crystalline form. In order to achieve a good dissolution the active ingredient has to be sufficiently wetted.<br>
The micronization of nebivolol hydrochloride as required in EP 0744946 B1 for preparing pharmaceutical compositions unjustifiably increases the time cycle for the manufacturing process. It also requires undue utilities like milling and sifting, which increases the cost of preparing the final product. It is further demonstrated that on comparison of dissolution of tablets comprising crystalline versus micronized nebivolol, the dissolution rate of the tablet comprising crystalline nebivolol (Example 6 of EP 744946) is less than 50 % after 45 minutes.<br>
EP 0145067 B1 provides pharmaceutical composition of derivatives of 2,2'-iminobisethanol for various dosage forms i.e. oral drops, injectable solution, oral solution, film coated tablets and the like. The use of sodium dodecyl sulfate is disclosed in EP 0145067 B1 in the preparation of film-coated tablet. Sodium dodecyl sulfate, i.e., sodium lauryl sulfate, (Wade, A. and Weller P.J., Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, 2nd ed., 1994, page 448) is a wetting agent in the core of the composition (film coated tablet).<br><br><br>
WO 2002/087508 discloses nitrosated and nitrosylated nebivolol and its metabolites and pharmaceutical composition using the same. It is disclosed that the bio-availability of the composition can be enhanced by micronization of the formulation using conventional techniques such as grinding, milling, spray drying and the like in the presence of suitable excipients or agents such as phospholipids or surfactants.<br>
Thus, the existing literature reveals that attempts to use the natural crystalline form of nebivolol have resulted in poor dissolution rate and poor bioavailability. Attempts for combining the crystalline form with a wetting agent are also largely unsuccessful. For achieving appropriate dissolution rate or bioavailability of nebivolol hydrochloride, micronized nebivolol is needed. The micronization process is both cost extensive and time consuming, and requires the use of wetting agent.<br>
Wetting agent is a surfactant, a substance capable of reducing the surface tension of a liquid in which it is dissolved. The effect of surfactant over the intestinal membrane is more complex. It has been shown that most surfactants interact with the absorbing membranes (Bermejo, D.M. and Ruiz-Garcia, A., Business Briefing: Pharmatech 2003; pages 1-7). Permeability enhancement and local damage are closely related sequelae of the interaction of surfactants with the intestinal wall (Swenson, E.S., Milisen, W.B., Curatolo, W., Pharm. Res. 1994 Aug; 11(8), pages 1132-42). Ingested surfactants may facilitate penetration or absorption of potentially toxic or pathogenic compounds, which in turn may result in adverse effects on the other organs (Lieberman, H.A., Rieger, M.M. and Banker, G.S., Eds., Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Disperse Systems, 2nd ed, Vol. 1, page 261). The surfactant can facilitate their own entry and that of other material into the body, which thus enters in to the systemic circulation (Lieberman, H.A., Rieger, M.M. and Banker, G.S., Eds., Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Disperse Systems, 2nd ed., Vol. 1, page 264).<br>
Polysorbate 60 or 80 affects the integrity of intestinal mucosa (Lieberman, H.A., Rieger, M.M. and Banker, G.S., Eds., Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms:<br><br>
Disperse Systems, 2nd ed., Vol. 1, page 261), Polysorbate 80 may increase the<br>
absorption	of	fat-soluble	substances<br>
(www.lactose.co.uk/milkallergy/foodadditives400.html).<br>
Management of hypertension being a long term therapy, use of wetting<br>
agents in the formulation of nebivolol need to be judiciously avoided. Large<br>
doses of polysorbate 80 as a wetting agent in pharmaceutical formulations<br>
produces	abdominal	spasms,	diarrhea<br>
(http://www.jtbker.com/msds/englishhtm1/t7683.htm). Further, polysorbate 80<br>
containing pharmaceutical compositions have found to cause allergy in various<br>
patients	(http://www.hci.utah.edu/patientdocs/hci/drugd/docetaxel.htm).<br>
Polysorbate 20 and polysorbate 40 should also be avoided in formulations as<br>
they	are	banned	in	certain	countries<br>
(http://www.lactose.co.uk/milkallergy/foodadditives400.html).<br>
Thus there is a long felt need to have compositions of nebivolol that are safe and efficacious at the same time being cost and time effective for manufacturing.<br>
The present inventors have surprisingly found that pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention prepared using nebivolol as the active ingredient and without using wetting agent, exhibited excellent dissolution characteristics that were also found to be comparable with respect to the marketed formulation.<br>
It was further surprisingly found that nebivolol hydrochloride could be formulated not only without the use of wetting agent but optionally without using binder or disintegrant without retarding the dissolution characteristics of the drug. OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is thus an object of the present invention to provide for an improved process for the synthesis of pharmaceutically active 2,2'iminobisethanol derivative i.e. 2H-1-benzopy ran-2-methanol, a, a'-iminobis (methylene)] bis[6-fluoro-3,4-dihydro-, [2R*[R*[R*(S*)]]j] i.e. nebivolol base or its hydrochloride salt of formula (I) above .<br><br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a simple and economical process for synthesis of nebivolol base or its hydrochloride salt that involves minimum number of process steps and does not utilize hazardous chemicals in the synthesis.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide pharmaceutical compositions comprising nebivolol hydrochloride active ingredient and one or more adjuvants, without incorporating wetting agent, to achieve desired dissolution profile.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide process to manufacture solid dosage form as tablets or capsules in a simple and cost effective manner.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is the preparation of a solid dosage form of nebivolol hydrochloride, and one or more adjuvants, without the use of wetting agent optionally without using binder and optionally without using disintegrant.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The present invention accordingly provides for an improved process for<br>
the	preparation	of        2H-1-benzopyran-2-methanol,	a,	a'<br>
[iminobis(methylene)]bis[6-fluoro-3,4-dihydro-, [2R*[R*[R*(S*)]]]] i.e. nebivolol of formula (IX) or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts like the hydrochloride salt as shown in formula (I).<br><br>
Nebivolol is prepared according to the present invention by the synthetic route shown in Scheme III given below:<br><br><br>
The reaction steps in the present invention for the preparation of nebivolol starting from compound (II) according to Scheme III above are now described hereunder:<br><br>
5-Fluoro-2-hydroxyacetophenone (II) was treated with potassium tertiary butoxide and diethyl oxalate to give 6-fluoro-4-oxo-4H-1-benzopyran-2-carboxylic acid (III) according to Reaction 1 as given below by a known process (JP 2218675).<br><br>
6-Fluoro-4-oxo-4H-1-benzopyran-2-carboxylic acid (III) was reacted with 10% palladium on carbon in acetic acid as solvent under hydrogen atmosphere to give 6-fluoro-3,4-dihydro-2H-1-benzopyran-2-carboxylic acid (IV) as shown in Reaction - 2 given below by a known process (US 4,654,362).<br><br>
6-Fluoro-3,4-dihydro-2H-1-benzopyran-2-carboxylic acid (IV) is converted into the amide (V-A) using amine RR'NH and acid activating agent as indicated in Reaction 3(a),<br><br><br>
wherein, R and R' are independently H, alkyl or phenyl, optionally joined together with or without a heteroatom such as O, N or S. Alkyl is straight chain or branched C1to C6 alkyl.<br>
In the Reaction 3 (a) of formation of amide (V-A) from acid (IV), the amine RR'NH can be selected from the group of primary or secondary amines. The primary amine is selected from aliphatic or aromatic primary amine, whereas the secondary amine is selected from cyclic secondary amines or non-cyclic secondary amines, wherein substitution on nitrogen is independently aliphatic or aromatic or combination thereof.<br>
Preferably, secondary amines can be used. More preferably, secondary amines, which are cyclic amines are used.<br>
The amines can be selected from the group comprising of dimethylamine, diethylamine, N-methylphenylamine, pyrrolidine, piperidine, N,0-dimethylhydroxylamine and morpholine. The preferred amine is piperidine.<br>
The activating agent according to Reaction-3 (a) is selected from the group comprising of thionyl chloride, ethylchloroformate, acetic anhydride, phosphorus trichloride, phosphorus oxychloride, phosphorus pentachloride, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, N,N'- carbonyldiimidazole and chlorosaccharin. The preferred activating agents are thionyl chloride and ethylchloroformate.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, 6-Fluoro-3,4-dihydro-2H-1-benzopyran-2-carboxylic acid (IV) was converted into 6-fluoro-3,4-dihydro-2H-1-benzopyran-2-carboxylic acid piperidine amide (V) using thionyl chloride and piperidine in toluene as solvent, as indicated in Reaction - 3 below.<br><br><br>
The reduction of amide (V-A) to give 6-fluoro-3,4-dihydro-2H-1-benzopyran-2-carboxaldehyde of Formula (VI) is carried out by using an alkoxy metallic hydride wherein, alkoxy group is substituted or unsubstituted -0(C1-C4)alkyl, and substitution if any, by -0(C1-C4)alkyl and, metallic part contains metal selected from the group comprising of Li or Na.<br><br>
The alkoxy metallic hydride reducing agent is selected from the group comprising of sodium bis (2-methoxyethoxy)aluminium hydride, lithium diethoxyaluminium dihydride and lithium tri-terf-butoxy aluminium hydride.<br>
The preferred reducing agent is sodium bis (2-methoxyethoxy) aluminium hydride.<br>
6-Fluoro-3,4-dihydro-2H-1-benzopyran-2-carboxylic acid piperidine amide (V) was reduced by using vitride i.e. Sodium bis (2-methoxyethoxy)aluminium hydride in toluene to give 6-fluoro-3,4-dihydro-2H-1-benzopyran-2-carboxaldehyde (VI) as given below in Reaction - 4.<br><br>
Reaction - 4<br>
6-Fluoro-3,4-dihydro-2H-1-benzopyran-2-carboxaldehyde (VI) was reacted with trimethyl sulfoxonium iodide in presence of base, potassium tertiary butoxide and solvent dimethyl sulfoxide to give isomeric mixture of oxiranes<br><br><br>
represented by formula (VII), which may be optionally distilled, as indicated in Reaction-5.<br><br>
Thus, the present invention avoids the use of sodium hydride as base in the above reaction. Due to the said change of the above base, the purity of the reaction product, i.e., oxirane (VII) is substantially higher. The purity of the oxirane obtained by using potassium tertiary butoxide as base is above 75 % before product distillation , compared to a purity of 60-65 % of the product before product distillation obtained in our hand by using sodium hydride base, as per the procedure described in EP 0145067 B1. The process of the present invention affords the advantage of both avoiding the use of hazardous sodium hydride as well as improving the purity of the oxirane.<br>
The mixture of oxiranes was separated by column chromatography to elute firstly pure fraction (A-isomer i.e. Vll-A), i.e. (A)-6-fluoro-3,4-dihydro-2-oxiranyl-2H-1-benzopyran of EP 0 145 067. Further, upon elution the second fraction (B-isomer i.e. VII - B), i.e. (B)-6-fluoro-3, 4-dihydro-2-oxiranyl-2H-1-benzopyran of EP 0 145 067 was obtained.<br>
The chromatographic separation of two isomers A and B was carried out (EP 0 145 067) (Scheme -1) using silica gel as the stationary phase whereas the eluant is the mixture of hexanes and ethyl acetate. If the loading material is in higher quantity, the purification by column chromatography can be done simultaneously on multiple columns (more than one column). The column chromatography yielded Isomer-A in the beginning, followed by Isomer-B. Based on the purity of the fractions from the column, they can be mixed together and used for further reaction.<br>
16<br><br><br>
(A)-6-fluoro-3,4-dihydro-2-oxiranyl-2H-1-benzopyran (VII-A) was reacted with benzylamine in isopropyl alcohol to give (A)-6-fluoro-3,4-dihydro-alpha-[[(phenylmethyl)amino]-methyl]-2H-1-benzopyran-2-methanol (Intermediate I), by a known process (US 4,654,362), as indicated in Reaction-6.<br><br>
(A)-6-Fluorodihydro-a-[[(phenylmethyl)amino]-methyl]-2H-1-benzopyran-2-methanol (Intermediate-I) was reacted with (B)-6-fluoro-3,4-dihydro-2-oxiranyl-2H-1-benzopyran (Vll-B) in presence of an organic solvent and isolated at a temperature of -5 to -25°C, and maintaining the reaction mass at the temperature of isolation for more than 2 hours to give benzylated nebivolol as shown in the following Reaction - 7.<br><br><br>
(vm)<br>
Reaction - 7<br>
In the present invention, the reaction between the benzylated A-isomer of (VII) (i.e.,. Intermediate I) and the B-isomer (Vll-B) was carried out in an organic solvent and isolated at a temperature of -5 to -25°C leading directly to the formation of the free benzylated nebivolol base (IX) containing only the desired isomers (having SRRR- and RSSS-configuration). It has been observed surprisingly in the present invention, that the isolation when carried out a low temperature, particularly at a temperature of -5 to -25°C yields substantially pure desired stereoisomers, (HPLC purity &gt; 90.0%) which can be further optionally purified in alcoholic solvent such as methanol, ethanol to get desired stereoisomer in highly pure form (HPLC purity &gt;98.5%) , as compared to the process described in the prior art, wherein the desired isomers are obtained with considerably less purity (HPLC purity
