				<td>Description<br>
Card receiving device and method<br>
The invention relates to a card receiving device, in particular<br>
for a tachograph in a motor vehicle of a flat construction,<br>
with a receiving opening for receiving a card, which has a<br>
memory for data, with a closure for closing the receiving<br>
opening, with a locking unit, which has at least one locking<br>
element, which can be moved into a locked position in which the<br>
at least one locking element locks the closure, the card<br>
receiving device having at least one first sensor and it being<br>
possible for the position of the at least one locking element<br>
to be sensed by means of the first sensor. In addition, a<br>
method for receiving a card by means of said card receiving<br>
device in which the card is inserted into the card receiving<br>
device during an insertion phase is also the subject of the<br>
invention.<br>
A card receiving device of this type and a method for receiving<br>
a card are known from DE 39 29 141 Al. However, apart from the<br>
locking of the closure, no further measures are provided for<br>
increasing the security of the card receiving device against<br>
manipulation.<br>
Further card receiving devices are described in EP 0 2 82 296 A2<br>
and US 4 835 375. EP 0 282 296 A2 discloses a reading-writing<br>
device for an IC card, in which a hook arrests the pushed-in<br>
card in the device. However, this hook does not close the<br>
receiving opening and it is also not additionally locked.<br>
US 4 83 5 375 discloses a reading-writing device for an IC card<br>
in which both the reaching of the writing/reading position by<br>
the card and the arresting of a slide are detected by means of<br>
a sensor. A closure for the receiving opening is not provided.<br><br>
The main focus of application of the device according to the<br>
invention and the method according to the invention lies in the<br>
area of tachographs or devices for recording the working<br>
periods and rest periods of commercial vehicle drivers.<br>
However, other applications are likewise feasible, for example<br>
in the area of banking and for making payments, or locking<br>
systems. The invention is advantageously used in combination<br>
with all types of card-like data storage media. On account of<br>
the great commercial and legal importance of the data which can<br>
be acquired with tachographs, the recordings have to be<br>
reliably secured against manipulation. The security measures<br>
relate both to data acquisition and data transmission and to<br>
the transmission and storage of the acquired data in the memory<br>
of the card. Relevant standards place strict requirements on<br>
the security standard to be achieved by the measures. It is<br>
therefore stipulated that the card should be entirely held by<br>
the card receiving device during the reading and writing<br>
operations<br><br>
and be isolated from the surroundings by means of suitable<br>
closure devices. The closure devices have to be locked in the<br>
closed position during the reading and writing operations.<br>
Additional difficulties arise on account of operational<br>
failures in conventional devices caused by contamination, in<br>
particular by contact being interrupted or even when the card<br>
is being drawn in. It is problematical to draw in the card and<br>
position it exactly on the contacts of the device because the<br>
 cards have high manufacturing tolerances in relation to the<br>
required positional accuracy with respect to the contacts of<br>
the device. Since the cards are predominantly perceived by the<br>
user to be distinguished by a high degree of robustness, said<br>
cards are generally not handled with the care that is actually<br>
required, so that, in addition to the tolerances caused by<br>
 manufacture, deformation and damage impair the way in which the<br>
 card operates when interacting with the card receiving devices.<br>
	Furthermore, . the operating conditions in motor vehicles place<br>
I<br>
 increased requirements on functional reliability on account of<br>
 the pronounced vibrations and countless bumps and the wide-<br>
 ranging temperature fluctuations. Implementing security against<br>
 manipulation and the desired handling convenience mean it is<br>
necessary to draw in the card fully automatically. However, in<br>
order to meet this requirement, great difficulties are faced in<br>
terms of construction because the installation space available<br>
in a tachograph, which is the size of a car radio, provides<br>
only approximately a height of 10 mm for the fully automatic<br>
drawing-in process.<br>
Great technical difficulties arising from the need for a fully<br>
automatic card insertion necessitate a requirement for a<br><br>
at least one locking element and, during a securing phase, the<br>
arresting unit is moved into an arrested position, in which the<br>
locking unit is arrested by means of the arresting unit.<br>
With the sensory monitoring of the locking unit, the invention<br>
has recognized the key role of the locking in the matter of<br>
receiving the card. This recognition is based on the<br>
experience that many instances of damage, in particular in the<br>
form of jamming of the card to be received in the device, are<br>
attributable to incorrect positioning in relation to the<br>
locking elements of the locking unit. Since the entire device<br>
is operated in a relatively confined space, the leeway<br>
available between the card transported into the interior of the<br>
device, the closure and the locking unit is relatively small,<br>
so that even minor positioning errors can lead to blockages of<br>
the device with serious implications. Consequently, on account<br>
of the key function of the mechanical components to be<br>
monitored, the sensory monitoring has special advantages.<br>
The security against manipulation is additionally increased by<br>
the card receiving device having an arresting unit, which can<br>
be moved into an arrested position and, in the arrested<br>
position, arrests the locking unit located in the locked<br>
position. A manipulation attempted on the closure with<br>
fraudulent intent is prevented with dual security, since first<br>
the locking and then the arrestment have to be overcome.<br>
An advantageous development of the card receiving device<br>
according to the invention provides that the card receiving<br>
device has a central control system, which is in connection<br>
with the first sensor. The central control system can<br>
advantageously inquire the status of the locking unit<br>
permanently or situation-dependently and make allowance for<br>
this information in the functionally appropriate control of all<br>
the elements to be activated, such as drives or display units<br>
for example.<br><br>
Increased immunity to malfunctions is obtained if the card<br>
receiving device has at least one second sensor, the second<br>
sensor senses at least one phase of the reception of the card<br>
and, at the beginning and/or<br><br>
end of the phase, sends at least one signal to the central<br>
control system.<br>
In order that the locking unit and the arresting unit are not<br>
damaged, it is expedient if the second sensor senses the<br>
beginning or the end of the arrestment of the locking unit in<br>
the locked position of the card and sends at least one signal<br>
to the central control system at the beginning and/or the end<br>
of the arrestment of the locking unit. In this way, the<br>
central control system advantageously receives information on<br>
the status of the arresting unit and, dependent on this, can<br>
control the initiation of further steps for receiving the card<br>
or for data transmission. At the same time, by means of the<br>
sensor system, possibly in combination with the first sensor,<br>
the proper locking and arrestment of the closure can be<br>
monitored, so that no manipulation can take place unnoticed<br>
during data transmissions between the card and the device. The<br>
central control system expediently only initiates a data<br>
transmission operation to the card being received, or maintains<br>
it, only if the first sensor signals that the locking unit is<br>
in the locked position and the second sensor signals that the<br>
arresting unit is in the arrested position.<br>
Instead of direct monitoring or in addition to a directly<br>
monitoring sensor, it may on the one hand be less costly and on<br>
the other hand be functionally more appropriate if the card<br><br>
receiving device has at least one movable gear element, which<br>
is formed and coupled into the kinetic mechanism of the card<br>
receiving device in such a way that each position of this gear<br>
element during the transport of the card into an end position<br>
can be uniquely assigned a movement phase of the drawing-in,<br>
locking and/or arrestment of the locking. If the gear<br>
mechanism has such a gear element, there is the possibility<br>
that, for example, the second sensor or a further sensor is<br>
coupled to the gear element in a sensory manner, at least one<br>
position of the gear element can be sensed by means of the<br>
sensor and in this way the beginning and/or the end of the<br>
movement phase can be sensed by means of the kinetic<br>
assignment. Conceivable here in particular as movement phases<br>
are the points in time at the beginning and end of the closing,<br>
locking or arresting or else a clamping or gripping and<br>
transporting of the card to be received, possibly also a fine<br>
positioning of the card.<br>
Depending on the installation situation and intended use, the<br>
individual sensors are advantageously optical, inductive,<br>
capacitive and/or mechanical in their operating mode. The<br>
functioning is often achieved by an optical sensor for the<br>
sensing of the position of the movable components, in<br>
particular with forked light barriers, which interact with lugs<br>
attached to the components to be monitored.<br>
Reliable security against manipulation can often be achieved if<br>
the card can be drawn completely into the interior of the card<br>
receiving device. Additional security against attempted<br>
manipulations is obtained if the locking element not only locks<br>
a closure closing the receiving opening in a locked position<br><br>
but also at least partially blocks the clear cross section of<br>
the receiving opening in the locked position. Even if the<br>
closure closing the receiving opening happens to be damaged,<br>
access to the card located in the card receiving device is<br>
still prevented because of the locking element.<br>
In order that the high security requirements are met even<br>
during the data transmission between the memory of the card and<br>
the card receiving device for the tachograph, it is expedient<br>
if the position of the locking element in the locked position<br>
can be permanently inquired by means of the first sensor and<br>
the first sensor permanently signals the sensed position to the<br>
central control system by means of signals transmitted to the<br>
central control system. In this way, loss of the locked<br>
position during a data transmission ■ can also be stored in the<br>
memory of the card, whereby attempted manipulations are<br>
correspondingly demonstrable.<br>
In order to reduce further the susceptibility to faults of the<br>
device according to the invention, it is expedient if the card<br>
receiving device has a third sensor, which senses the presence<br>
in the device of the card to be received. In this way, a<br>
manipulative or inadvertently initiated drawing-in operation<br>
without the card can be terminated after detection of the<br>
absence of the card, and the system can be reset to the<br>
original state. It is advisable in this respect if the third<br>
sensor is formed in such a way that it can be actuated by the<br>
card to be received itself or by a card receiving unit that is<br>
movable in the inward direction. A mechanical operating mode<br>
is particularly advantageous here, since sensors of this type<br>
generally do not require auxiliary power and are therefore<br><br>
energy-saving and particularly fail-safe devices. The<br>
independence of the sensors from a power supply also gives rise<br>
to the further advantage that the power supply to the card<br>
receiving device or individual modules of this device can be<br>
switched on by means of such a sensor. An advantageous<br>
development of the invention provides that a third sensor is<br>
formed in such a way that it can be actuated in response to<br>
actuation of opened switches, or normally closed contacts and<br>
by a card receiving unit that moves with the card in the inward<br>
direction, so that, if there is no card in the card receiving<br>
device, it is actuated and the switch is open, if there is a<br>
drawing-in movement of the card receiving device, it is no<br>
longer actuated and the switch changes into a closed position.<br>
Being formed in this way provides the special advantage that no<br>
slotted link has to be provided for the actuation of the third<br>
sensor, bringing the sensor of the switch into the closed<br>
position in dependence on the movement phase of the card, but<br>
instead the inactive position in the absence of a card is used<br>
for the actuation of the switch or for the interruption of a<br>
power circuit.<br>
In order to sense the readiness for data transmission between<br>
the card and the tachograph in an end position of the card, it<br>
is expedient if the card receiving device has a fourth sensor,<br>
by means of which it can be sensed whether the card has reached<br>
the end position in the card receiving device. On account of<br>
the relatively narrow dimensional tolerances of the contacts<br>
arranged on the standardized card, it is advisable if the<br>
fourth sensor is integrally formed with a set of contacts<br>
provided for the contacting of the card. Here, too, the use of<br>
a switch provided with mechanical elements is suitable. The<br>
advantages of the<br><br>
invention come fully to bear if the card can be automatically<br>
drawn in and/or withdrawn.<br>
An advantageous development of the method according to the<br>
invention provides that, during the insertion phase, the card<br>
inserted into the card receiving device is sensed by means of<br>
the third sensor, the insertion is signaled to a central<br>
control system and the central control system switches on the<br>
power supply to a drive. Apart from the drive, further<br>
electrical components, in particular with intensive power<br>
consumption, that have been disconnected from the power supply<br>
can also be switched on by the central control system, for<br>
example display lighting systems. This helps to conserve the<br>
available energy resources.<br>
The device according to the invention and the associated method<br>
according to the invention are particularly space-saving if,<br>
after the insertion phase, a clamping unit clamps the card<br>
during a gripping phase and the card is transported into the<br>
receiving device during a transporting phase. By contrast with<br>
transport by means of rubber rollers, the use of a clamping<br>
unit has the advantage that the clamping unit permits a<br>
particularly flat construction, whereas the function of a drive<br>
by means of rollers requires a certain minimum diameter of the<br>
individual rollers and, dependent on the length of the<br>
transporting distance, a certain number of rollers. To ensure<br>
a high degree of functionality and security, it is expedient<br>
if, after the insertion phase, transporting phase and/or<br>
gripping phase, the clamping of the clamping unit is released<br>
from the card during a prepositioning phase and the second<br>
sensor senses the end of the prepositioning phase and signals<br>
it to the central control system. Only once the clamping unit<br>
is released is it possible to correct the manual<br><br>
inaccuracies of insertion of the card into the clamping unit,<br>
and the signal of the second sensor provides the central<br>
control system with information feedback on how the receiving<br>
operation is proceeding.<br>
For correction of the inaccurate manual insertion of the card<br>
to be received into the card receiving device, an advantageous<br>
development of the method according to the invention provides<br>
that, after the insertion phase, transporting phase, gripping<br>
phase and/or prepositioning phase, the locking unit moves into<br>
the locked position in a fine positioning phase and the card is<br>
thereby transported into the end position, in which first<br>
contacts of a set of contacts are in connection with second<br>
contacts of the card. Dividing the transport of the card into<br>
an insertion phase, in which the card is initially transported<br>
into the interior of the card receiving device, and a fine<br>
positioning phase, allows error-free data transmission in spite<br>
of the often inaccurate manual insertion of the card and the<br>
relatively narrow dimensional tolerances of the contacts on the<br>
card. For monitoring the successful fine positioning of the<br>
card, it is expedient if the fourth sensor senses the end<br>
position of the card and signals it to the central control<br>
system.<br>
A refinement of the method according to the invention that<br>
conforms entirely to the statutory regulations provides that,<br>
after the insertion phase, transporting phase, gripping phase,<br>
prepositioning phase and/or fine positioning phase, the<br>
arresting unit is moved into the arrested position, in which<br>
the locking unit is arrested by means of the arresting unit, in<br>
a securing phase.<br><br>
The security against manipulation and functional reliability<br>
are additionally increased by the second sensor sensing the<br>
arrested position of the arresting unit and signaling it to the<br>
central control system.<br>
Permanent monitoring of this signal makes it possible to<br>
demonstrate an unforeseen movement of the arresting unit from<br>
the arrested position. At the same time, the central control<br>
system can switch off the drive of the card receiving device.<br>
To save energy, switching off the drive expediently takes place<br>
only when the time period between the signal which signals the<br>
end of the prepositioning phase and the signal which signals<br>
the reaching of the locked position of the locking device does<br>
not exceed a predetermined value, since otherwise the<br>
probability of a malfunction is increased. If the time value<br>
is exceeded, it is expedient if the central control system<br>
initiates an operation for the card to be withdrawn.<br>
A data transmission phase, which follows the insertion phase,<br>
transporting phase, gripping phase, prepositioning phase, fine<br>
positioning phase and/or securing phase and in which<br>
information is transmitted between the memory of the card and<br>
the card receiving device or the tachograph, should be<br>
interrupted if the second sensor no longer signals the arrested<br>
position of the arresting unit or the first sensor no longer<br>
signals the locked position or if one of the two sensors<br>
indicates leaving of the position to be monitored.<br>
A specific exemplary embodiment of the card receiving device<br>
according to the invention and of the method according to the<br>
invention is described in more detail below to illustrate the<br>
invention, with reference to drawings, in which:<br><br>
Figure 1 shows a perspective view of a card receiving unit,<br>
Figure 2 shows a perspective view of a set of contacts,<br>
looking toward the contacts,<br>
Figure 3 shows a perspective view of a gear element according<br>
to the invention,<br>
Figure 4 shows a printed circuit board for a card receiving<br>
device according to the invention of a tachograph,<br>
Figure 5 shows a perspective view of a locking element, which<br>
in the case of the card receiving device according to<br>
the invention of the exemplary embodiment presented<br>
is arranged on the right-hand side,<br>
Figures 6 to 10<br>
each show a view from below of a card receiving<br>
device according to the invention in different phases<br>
of the reception of a card,<br>
Figures 11 and 12<br>
each show a flow diagram of a card drawing-in process<br>
by means of a card receiving device according to the<br>
invention.<br>
The card receiving device 3, represented in a simplified form<br>
in Figure 1, substantially comprises a slide 3 6 and an<br>
extension arm 37, to which a toothed rack element 110<br>
represented in Figure 6 is resiliently attached. A first<br>
linear mount 13, which is in the form of two sliding bearing<br>
surfaces 3 9 arranged on the side of the slide 36, runs in an<br>
inward direction 14, in which the extension arm 37 extends.<br><br>
The slide 3 6 interacts with a clamping element (not<br>
represented), so that a card 2 to be received (not represented)<br>
is clamped in the manner of tongs by the card receiving unit 3.<br>
For this purpose, a card 2 (not represented) is pushed over<br>
run-in slopes 3 8 on the input side along the slide 3 6 as far as<br>
two stops 35, so that continued pressure against the inserted<br>
card 2 moves the card receiving unit 3 in the inward direction<br>
14. A third sensor 23, formed in Figures 6 to 10 as a normally<br>
closed contact, is relieved by a projection 25, moving with the<br>
card receiving unit 3 in the inward direction 14, so that the<br>
third sensor 23, formed as a switch, is no longer actuated and<br>
changes into the closed position.<br>
Represented in Figure 2 is a set of contacts 10, which has as<br>
its main components six contacts 11, various terminals 12, a<br>
second stop 15 and a fourth sensor 24. The second stop 15 is<br>
integrally formed with the set of contacts 10, since great<br>
dimensional stability can be achieved in this way between the<br>
contacts 11 and the stop edge of the stop 15. The fourth<br>
sensor 24 has a mechanical actuating element 26, which makes<br>
contact with the card 2 reaching an end position, on an end<br>
face leading in the inward direction 14, and signals this<br>
operation to a central control system (not represented).<br>
Figure 3 shows a central gear element 40 in isolation, while in<br>
Figures 6 to 10 it is represented in various movement phases in<br>
interaction with a locking unit 50 and an arresting unit 60.<br>
In a central first axis of rotation 41, the gear element 40 is<br>
provided with a projection, about which it is rotatably<br>
attached to a carrier 70, represented in Figures 6 to 10. A<br><br>
first pin 49, attached to an extension arm 43, serves for<br>
introducing force by means of a drive (not represented). The<br>
gear element 40 transfers the introduced force of the drive by<br>
means of an eccentrically arranged second pin 44 to the locking<br>
unit 50. By means of a driver 45, arranged on the outer<br>
periphery, the gear element 40 transfers the actuating force to<br>
the arresting unit 60. The gear element 40 is formed as a<br>
punched sheet-metal part and is provided on the outer periphery<br>
with two bent-away projections 47, 48, which are formed as<br>
signalers for the position of the gear element 40 in<br>
interaction with a second sensor 22, which is represented in<br>
Figure 4 and configured as a forked light barrier.<br>
Represented in Figure 4 is a printed circuit board 100 for two<br>
card receiving devices 1 according to the invention that are<br>
arranged next to each other, which is to be loaded with<br>
components entirely by the SMD technique, so that no flexible<br>
leads are required. The main components for each card<br>
receiving device 1 are a centrally arranged set of contacts 10,<br>
a first sensor 21, which is formed as a forked light barrier<br>
for the detection of a locking element 51 of the locking unit<br>
50, a second sensor 22, which is likewise formed as a forked<br>
light barrier for the detection of the movement phases of the<br>
arresting unit 60 via the gear element 40 as a forked light<br>
barrier, and a third sensor 23, which is formed as a switch to<br>
be mechanically actuated to register the insertion of a card 2.<br>
Represented in Figure 5 is a locking element 51 of the locking<br>
unit 50 together with an arresting element 61 of the arresting<br>
unit 60. The main component parts of the locking element 51<br>
are a base plate 52, a<br><br>
bearing piece 53 attached on the base plate 52 and a leaf<br>
spring 54, pressing resiliently against the bearing piece 53.<br>
The locking element 51 is mounted on the carrier 7 0 rotatably<br>
about a second axis of rotation 51 in a second mount 56, as<br>
represented in Figures 6 to 10. These representations likewise<br>
show that the longitudinal extent of the locking element 51 is<br>
in the inward direction 14. Substantially transversely in<br>
relation to the inward direction 14, the bearing piece 53 is<br>
mounted in a sliding manner, linearly displaceable on the base<br>
plate 52 of the locking element 51. The locking element 51 is<br>
located on both sides of a card receiving compartment 80,<br>
represented in Figures 6 to 10, and the bearing piece 53 is<br>
kept under prestress by the leaf spring 54, respectively in the<br>
direction of the center of a receiving compartment 80. The<br>
base plate 52 is provided with a first slotted link-like guide<br>
57, which respectively interacts with one of the two second<br>
pins 44 of the gear element 40. The arresting element 61 is<br>
mounted in a sliding manner, linearly in the longitudinal<br>
direction of the locking element 51, and is formed in a<br>
displaceable manner in relation to the locking element 51. At<br>
the end on the input side, the arresting element 61 is provided<br>
with a taper 62, which moves in behind the recess 58 (not<br>
represented in any more detail) of the bearing piece 53 to<br>
arrest the bearing piece 53 in an arrested position, so that<br>
the bearing piece 53 is restricted in its freedom of movement<br>
in relation to the locking element 51. The bearing piece 53 has<br>
a projection 59, which interacts with the first sensor 21,<br>
which is formed as a forked light barrier, to sense the locked<br>
position. The arresting element 61 has a third pin 65, by means<br>
of which, in interaction with the driver 45 of the gear element<br>
40, the arresting element 61 is displaced into the arrested<br>
position on the locking element 51.<br><br>
In Figure 6, a card 2 is in front of a card receiving device 1<br>
according to the invention, which is ready to receive a card 2.<br>
The locking elements 51 are completely open and the closure 72,<br>
attached to a second leaf spring 71 integrally formed with the<br>
carrier 70, is freely movable transversely in relation to a<br>
pushing-in plane 73 of the card 2, unhindered by the locking<br>
elements 51. During the snapshot, represented in Figure 7, of a<br>
transporting phase of the card 2 into the card receiving device<br>
1, the third sensor 23 has already been relieved by the<br>
projection 25, and the power supply to a drive (not<br>
represented) of the device has been switched on. The card 2 is<br>
fixed on the card receiving unit 3 by means of a clamping unit<br>
(not represented in any more detail) of the card receiving unit<br>
3, while the latter is transported into the card receiving<br>
device 1 along the sliding bearing surfaces 3 9 of the first<br>
mount 13.<br>
Before the fine positioning phase, represented in Figure 8, the<br>
clamping unit (not represented in any more detail) of the card<br>
receiving unit 3 was released, so that the card 2 now rests<br>
immovably on the slide 36. In the same action, the locking<br>
elements 51 are moved toward each other by means of their first<br>
guides 57, by the gear element 40 rotating about the first axis<br>
of rotation 41 in interaction with the second pin 44, mirror-<br>
symmetrically in the direction of the center of the receiving<br>
compartment 80 in the course of a rotational movement about the<br>
second axis of rotation 55, so that the clear width of a<br>
receiving opening (not represented in any more detail) of the<br>
card receiving device 1 is reduced to less than the dimensions<br>
at the end of the card 2. At the same time, the first sensor<br>
21, formed as a forked light barrier, senses the engagement of<br>
the locking elements 51<br><br>
by means of the projection 59 and, once locking or fine<br>
positioning of the card 2 has taken place, signals the<br>
successful completion of this phase to the central control<br>
system (not represented) . Reaching the end position has the<br>
effect of actuating the fourth sensor 24 on the set of contacts<br>
10, which signals to the central control system the readiness<br>
for data transmission.<br>
During the securing phase, represented in Figure 9, the central<br>
gear element 40, by means of the driver 45 in interaction with<br>
the third pin 65, pushes the arresting element 61 of the<br>
arresting unit 60 into the arrested position, in which the<br>
arrested bearing piece 53 is restricted in its freedom of<br>
movement transversely in relation to the inward direction 14.<br>
The beginning of the securing phase is signaled to the central<br>
control system by means of the second sensor 22, which is<br>
formed as a forked light barrier and senses the first<br>
projection 47 of the gear element 40.<br>
During the further course of the securing phase, represented in<br>
Figures 9 and 10, the arresting element 61 is displaced into<br>
the arrested position along the locking element 51, and toward<br>
the end of the securing phase the second sensor 22 senses the<br>
second projection 48 of the gear element 40 and signals the end<br>
of the securing phase to the central control system. Then, the<br>
central control system switches off the power supply to the<br>
drive (not represented) and an information exchange between the<br>
memory of the card 2 and the tachograph takes place during the<br>
subsequent data transmission phase.<br>
In the flow diagram represented in Figure 12, the signals of<br>
the first to fourth sensors 21, 22, 23, 24 during a normally<br>
proceeding card drawing-in process and the power<br><br>
supply to the drive 27 in dependence on the phase of the<br>
reception of the card 2 are represented. During the insertion<br>
phase 91, the gripping phase 92, the card is manually pushed<br>
into the card receiving device 1 by the user and grasped by<br>
means of a clamping unit (not represented) of the card<br>
receiving unit 3. The movement of the card receiving unit 3 in<br>
the inward direction 14 brings about switching on of the power<br>
supply to the drive 27 by means of the third sensor 23 and,<br>
during the subsequent transporting phase 93, the clamped card 2<br>
moves with the card receiving unit 3 in the inward direction<br>
14. During the subsequent prepositioning phase 94, the clamping<br>
of the clamping unit (not represented), and consequently the<br>
fixing of the card 2 on the card receiving unit 3, are<br>
released, so that the card 2 is movable in relation to the<br>
slide 36. During the subsequent fine positioning phase 95, the<br>
locking elements 51 of the locking unit 50 move into a locked<br>
position, in which the closure 72 of the card receiving device<br>
1 is locked. At the same time, the card 2 is transported by<br>
means of the bearing pieces 53 into an end position suitable<br>
for the data transmission, in which first contacts 11 of the<br>
set of contacts 10 are in connection with second contacts of<br>
the card 2. The first sensor 21 senses the locked position of<br>
the locking unit and sends this signal to the central control<br>
system, or the central control system registers the<br>
interruption of the forked light barrier of the first sensor<br>
21.<br>
During a subsequent securing phase 96, an arresting element 61<br>
of an arresting unit 60 moves into an arrested position, in<br>
which the locking unit 50 is arrested, at the beginning of<br>
which the second sensor 22 senses the passing by of the first<br>
projection 47 of the gear element<br><br>
40 and signals it to the central control system. The signal<br>
caused at the second sensor 22 as the securing phase 96<br>
proceeds further, on account of the passing by of the second<br>
projection 48, indicates to the central control system the end<br>
of the securing phase 96, and the drive 27 is switched off.<br>
If the time period between the two successive signals of the<br>
second sensor 22 exceeds a certain value, the case represented<br>
in Figure 12 of a card improperly drawn in occurs, and the<br>
central control system initiates the ejection 98 of the card 2.<br>
If it proceeds without any errors, the securing phase 96 is<br>
followed by a data transmission phase 97, ' during which<br>
information is transmitted between the memory of the card 2 and<br>
the card receiving device 1. During the entire data<br>
transmission, the arrested position is monitored by means of<br>
the second sensor 22 and the locked position is monitored by<br>
means of the first sensor 21.<br><br>
