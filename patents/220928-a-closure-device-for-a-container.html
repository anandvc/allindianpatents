The present invention relates to a closure device for a container for liquids with a mouth situated at the end of a neck which extends axially from the body of the container, comprising a pouring member which has an internal cavity and a pouring opening and which is positioned on the mouth and extends coaxially relative to the neck, a valve member disposed within the cavity of the pouring member and movable axially relative to an annular abutment to allow the liquid to come out and to prevent fraudulent admission of liquid, a cap for opening and closing the pouring opening, as well as removable sealing means for permitting initial opening of the cap.<br>
Closure devices of the above-mentioned type which have seals are known in the art and are used particularly on bottles for holding good-quality liquors or beverages.<br>
An example of the prior art is contained in the publication GB-A-2285623, in which the seal is constituted by a cover which covers the cap and surrounds, with a sleeveÂ¬like portion, a good portion of the axial extent of the neck and of the underlying means which fix the pouring member to the top of the neck.<br>
The sealing cover described in the document cited above has a first circumferential weakening line positioned in the vicinity of the cap, a second weakening line, which is also circumferential and is positioned in the vicinity of the end of the sleeve-like portion, and a transverse weakening line connecting the two circumferential lines. Except for the transverse line, the circumferential lines are constituted by slots extending through the thickness of the material of the cover, spaced apart by connecting bridges, with the result that the visible surface of the cover is discontinuous.<br>
For this reason, the known cover is not suitable for receiving decorations or, in general, printed marks or incisions which can extend uniformly even straddling the weakening lines so as to help to provide evidence that the seal is intact.<br><br>
Moreover, in the prior art cited, the cover is connected to the neck of the container with the interposition of an auxihary element inserted between the neck and the inner surface of the sleeve-like portion, rendering the closure structure fairly complex and expensive.<br>
The object of the present invention is therefore to provide, within the scope of a closure device for a container for liquids of the type mentioned above, particularly a bottle, a sealing cover having a large visible surface which is free of discontinuities even in the region of the weakening and tear lines.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide a closure device which is highly effective from the security point of view, without penalizing the economic aspects.<br>
These objects are achieved by a closure device with a seal, the characteristics of which are described herein.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a closure device for a container for liquids with a mouth situated at the end of a neck which extends axially from the body of the container, comprising a pouring member which has an internal cavity and a pouring opening and which is positioned on the mouth and extends coaxially relative to the neck, a closure member disposed in the cavity of the pouring member and movable axially relative to an annular abutment to allow the liquid to come out and to prevent fraudulent admission of liquid, a cap for opening and closing the pouring opening, as well as removable sealing means for permitting initial opening of the cap, said sealing means comprising a cover fitted on the cap and extending axially, with a sleeve from the top of the cap beyond the region in which the pouring member bears on the neck of the container, the cover having at least one pair of weakening lines for the tearing of the region disposed between the lines, the lines extending axially along the sleeve, at least from the level of the pouring opening substantially as far as the region in which the pouring member bears on the neck, at least one weakening line which extends circumferentially around the sleeve intersecting at least one of the lines<br><br>
constituting the pair of axial weakening lines in a position corresponding to the region in which the pouring member bears on the neck, the circumferential weakening line and the pair of axial weakening lines being formed on the inner surface of the cover, a tab of the cover being provided at the top, adjacent the cap, for the pulling of the region disposed between the axial weakening lines bringing about detachment of a portion of the sleeve along the circumferential weakening line, characterized in that the cover has, on its inner surface, at least one first annular projection, formed in the tubular portion in which the axial weakening lines are formed and located above said circumferential weakening line for engagement under a corresponding annular step on the outer surface of the pouring member.<br>
The invention will now be described in greater detail with reference to an embodiment thereof illustrated in the appended drawings, provided purely by way of non- limiting example, in which :<br>
Figure 1 is a partially vertically-sectioned view of a closure according to the invention.<br>
Figure 2 is a partially vertically-sectioned view of the sealing cover alone.<br>
Figure 3 is a view of the inner surface of the top of the cover.<br>
Figure 4 is a cross-section taken on the line IV-IV of Figure 2,<br>
Figure 5 is a perspective view of the cover of Figure 2.<br>
With reference to the above-mentioned drawings a container 2, particularly a bottle, on the mouth 3 of which a pouring member 4 is disposed, has a neck, indicated 1. The pouring member 4 is fixed to the neck 1 by means of a plurality of tabs 5 the tips of which are fitted under an annular step 6 of the neck 1. The pouring member is held in a position coaxial with the axis X-X of the container by a first sleeve-like portion 7<br><br>
of a washer 8 the other sleeve-like end 9 of which is force-fitted in the mouth 3.<br>
The washer 8 holds, by means of a further, flared sleeve 10, a spherical body 11 acting, in known manner, as a valve element, together with a closure element 12 which is free to move axially inside the cavity 13 of the pouring body 4.<br>
When the closure element 12 is in the closure position, it bears on an integral annular rim 14 of the washer 8.<br>
The pouring body 4 has an opening 15 closed, in conventional manner, by a cap 16 the annular band 16a of which is engaged by screwing on the outer surface of the pouring body.<br>
According to the present invention, the closure has a seal to guarantee that the closure is intact until initial opening takes place.<br>
The seal is constituted by a cover, generally indicated 17, comprising a top wall 18 and a sleeve 19 which extends from the wall 18 beyond the region in which the pouring member 4 bears on the neck 1.<br>
The sleeve 19 comprises a first portion 19a adjacent the wall 18 and extending as far as the start of the neck, a second, intermediate portion 19b, and a terminal band 19c.<br>
The outer surface of the entire sleeve 19 is free of discontinuities, whereas its inner surface facing towards the pourer 4 and the neck 1 has a pair of weakening lines 20 and 21 which extend along the portion 19a of the sleeve from a level corresponding to the plane of the pouring opening 15 substantially up to a circumferential weakening line 22.<br>
The latter, which is positioned just below the plane of the mouth 3 of the neck 1, intersects at least one of the weakening lines 20 and 21.<br><br>
The weakening lines are constituted by incisions performed in the inner portion of the cover 17 for a depth such that they do not appear on the outer surface.<br>
The surface therefore remains free of discontinuities and can easily be individualized by decorations or inscriptions extending even over the underlying weakening lines, providing the cover with a good capability to prove that it is intact as a seal prior to opening.<br>
A region 23 defined between the weakening lines 20 and 21 is torn by the pulling, in conventional manner, of a tab 24 connected thereto and constituting a portion of the upper wall of the cover 17.<br>
This tab 24 is connected to the rim 18 of the cover by means of at least one bridge 25 and, as shown in Figure 5, is defined by notches 20a and 21a aligned with the weakening lines 20 and 21.<br>
Although these notches 20a and 21a are preferred for reasons of structural simplicity, they are not strictly necessary and, in their place, the weakening lines 20 and 21, which are formed in the inner surface of the portion 19a without appearing on the exterior, may extend as far as the base of the tab 24.<br>
Tearing of the region 23 isolates the tubular portion 19a which can be removed by further tearing along the circumferential weakening line 22.<br>
After the removal of the portion 19a, the portion 19b and the band 19c remain on the neck 1.<br>
The band 19c in particular is thinner than the portion 19b so that it can fit closely against the outer surface of the neck 1 without permitting a substantial grip on the rim 26 which could facilitate an attempt to remove the cover 17 from the neck.<br><br>
Such removal is also prevented by the presence of a first annular projection 27 which is formed on the inner surface of the first portion 19a of the sleeve 19 and which engages under a step 28 of the pouring member 4, and by a second annular projection 29 formed on the inner surface of the portion 19b.<br>
The latter projection engages under a corresponding step 30 also of the pouring member 4.<br>
As well as conferring considerable stability on the sealing cover when it is intact and fixed on the container, the combination of the projections 27 and 29 in engagement with the respective steps 28 and 30 also restrains the portion 19b with the band 19c after the removal of the upper portion 19a and the opening of the cap.<br><br><br>
