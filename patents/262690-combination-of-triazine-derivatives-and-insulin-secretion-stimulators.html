				<td>COMBINATION OF TRIAZINE DERIVATIVES AND INSULIN<br>
SECRETION STIMULATORS.<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition of<br>
triazine derivatives or described pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof<br>
with an insulin secretion stimulator, for the manufacture of a medicament<br>
that can be used in the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes and<br>
pathologies associated with insulin resistance syndrome.<br>
Technical background<br>
"Diabetes mellitus" (or diabetes) is one of the most prevalent dis-<br>
eases in the world today. Individuals suffering from diabetes have been<br>
divided into two classes, namely type I or insulin-dependent diabetes mel-<br>
litus and type II or non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIODM). Non-<br>
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIODM) accounts for approximately<br>
90% of all diabetics, and is estimated to affect 12 to 14 million adults in the<br>
United States alone (6.6% of the population). NIDDM is characterised both<br>
by fasting hyperglycaemia and exaggerated postprandial increases in<br>
plasmatic glucose levels. NIDDM is associated with a variety of long-term<br>
complications, including microvascular diseases, such as retinopathy,<br>
nephropathy and neuropathy, and macrovascular diseases, such as coro-<br>
nary heart disease. Numerous studies in animal models show a causal<br>
relationship between long-term complications and hyperglycaemia. Recent<br>
results obtained by the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT)<br>
and the Stockholm Prospective Study have for the first time demonstrated<br>
this relationship in man by showing that insulin-dependent diabetics have<br>
a substantially lower risk of development and progression of these compli-<br>
cations if they are subjected to tighter glycaemic control. Tighter control is<br>
also expected to benefit NIDDM patients.<br>
Hyperglycaemia in the case of NIDDM is associated with two bio-<br>
chemical anomalies, namely insulin resistance and insufficiency of insulin<br>
secretion.<br><br>
The initial treatment of NIDDM is based on a controlled diet and<br>
controlled physical exercise, since a considerable number of diabetics are<br>
overweight or obese (-67%) and since loss of weight can improve insulin<br>
secretion and sensitivity to insulin and lead to normal glycaemia.<br>
Patients suffering from hyperglycaemia that cannot be controlled<br>
solely by diet and/or physical exercise are then treated with oral anti-<br>
diabetics.<br>
Several categories of oral antidiabetics are currently used in<br>
monotherapy for the treatment of NIDDM:<br>
•	insulin secretion stimulators. They are represented, firstly, by<br>
suffonylureas (SU) and by "glinides". As regards SUs, mention will be<br>
made in particular of carbutamide (Glucidoral®), glibenclamide/glyburide<br>
(DaoniK®, Euglucan®), glibomuride (Glutril®), gliclazide (Diamicron®),<br>
glimepiride (Amarelv®) and glipizide (Glibenese®). As regards the<br>
"glinides", mention will be made in particular of repaglinide (NovoNorm®);<br>
•	agents that reduce glucogenesis, represented by the bigua-<br>
nides. Mention will be made in particular of metformin (Glucophage®,<br>
Stagid®);<br>
•	insulin sensitisers, represented mainly by thiazolidinediones<br>
(TZD). Mention will be made in particular of pioglitazone (Actos®) and<br>
rosiglitazone (Avandia®);<br>
•	alpha-glucosidase inhibitors. Mention will be made in particular<br>
of acarbose (Glucor®) and miglitol (Diastabol®).<br>
However, the monotherapy may show a loss of efficacy over time.<br>
This is referred to as "secondary deficiency". This may represent up to<br>
50% unsatisfactory response after 10 years of treatment. The studies con-<br>
ducted have shown that it is possible to deal with this problem by combin-<br>
ing in the same pharmaceutical form metformin with sulfonylureas or TZD<br>
(EP 869 796 B1, EP 974 365 B1, EP 861 666 B1, WO 03/006004 A2), and<br>
a number of these fixed combinations have been marketed;<br>
•	metformin + glibenclamide/glyburide (Glucovance®)<br>
•	metformin + glipizide (Metaglip®)<br>
•	metformin + rosiglitazone (Avandamet®).<br><br>
Triazine derivatives with an antidiabetic effect comparable to that of<br>
metformin have been described in WO 01/55122.<br>
The applicant has demonstrated, entirely unexpectedly, that the<br>
combination of an antidiabetic agent of triazine type, such as those de-<br>
scribed in WO 01/55122, and of an insulin secretion stimulator shows a<br>
synergistic effect and a very strong decrease in side effects compared with<br>
metformin combinations, especially as regards nausea and diarrhoea.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
The present invention thus relates to a novel pharmaceutical com-<br>
position comprising an antidiabetic agent of triazine type (WO 01/55122)<br>
and an insulin secretion stimulator with one or more pharmaceutically ac-<br>
ceptable excipients.<br>

It will be appreciated that the compounds that are useful according<br>
to the present invention may contain asymmetric centres. These asymmet-<br><br>
ric centres may be, independently, in R or S configuration. It will be clear<br>
to a person skilled in the art that certain compounds that are useful ac-<br>
cording to the invention may also exhibit geometrical isomerism. It should<br>
be understood that the present invention includes individual geometrical<br>
isomers and stereoisomers and mixtures thereof, including racemic mix-<br>
tures, of compounds of the formula (I) above. Isomers of this type can be<br>
separated from mixtures thereof by application or adaptation of known<br>
processes, for example chromatography techniques or recrystallisation<br>
techniques, or they are prepared separately from suitable isomers of their<br>
intermediates.<br>
For the purposes of this text, it is understood that the tautomeric<br>
forms are included in the mention of a given group, for example<br>
thio/mercapto or oxo/hydroxy.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions according to the present inven-<br>
tion are useful in the treatment of pathologies associated with insulin re-<br>
sistance syndrome (syndrome X).<br>
Insulin resistance is characterised by a reduction in the action of in-<br>
sulin (cf. Presse Medicate, 1997, 26 (No. 14), 671-677) and is involved in<br>
a large number of pathological conditions, such as diabetes and more par-<br>
ticularly non-insulin-dependent diabetes (type II diabetes or NIODM),<br>
dyslipidaemia, obesity and arterial hypertension, and also certain micro-<br>
vascular and macrovascular complications, for instance atherosclerosis,<br>
retinopathy and neuropathy.<br>
In this respect, reference will be made, for example, to Diabetes,<br>
vol. 37, 1988, 1595-1607; Journal of Diabetes and its Complications,<br>
1998, 12,110-119 or Horn. Res., 1992, 38, 28-32.<br>
The aim of the present invention is to propose a pharmaceutical<br>
composition for significantly improving the condition of diabetics and more<br>
particularly for optimising the use of glucose.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention especially have<br>
hypoglycaemiant activity.<br>
The compounds of the formula (I) are therefore useful in the treat-<br>
ment of pathologies associated with hyperglycaemia.<br><br>
The pharmaceutical composition comprising the triazine compound<br>
of the formula (I) in combination with an insulin secretion stimulator can be<br>
prepared by mixing together the various active principles, either all to-<br>
gether or independently with a physiologically acceptable support, an ex-<br>
cipient, a binder, a diluent, etc. It is then administered orally or non-orally,<br>
for instance via the parenteral, intravenous, cutaneous, nasal or rectal<br>
route. If the active principles are formulated independently, the corre-<br>
sponding formulations may be mixed together extemporaneously using a<br>
diluent and are then administered or may be administered independently<br>
of each other, either successively or sequentially.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention includes formula-<br>
tions such as granules, powders, tablets, gel capsules, syrups, emulsions<br>
and suspensions, and also forms used for non-oral administration, for in-<br>
stance injections, sprays or suppositories.<br>
The pharmaceutical forms can be prepared via the known conven-<br>
tional techniques.<br>
The preparation of an orally administered solid pharmaceutical form<br>
will be performed by the following process: an excipient (for example lac-<br>
tose, sucrose, starch, mannitol, etc.), a disintegrant (for example calcium<br>
carbonate, calcium carboxymethylcellulose, alginic acid, sodium carboxy-<br>
methylcellulose, colloidal silicon dioxide, sodium croscarmellose, Cros-<br>
povidone, guar gum, magnesium aluminium silicate, microcrystalline cel-<br>
lulose, cellulose powder, pregelatinised starch, sodium alginate, starch<br>
glycolate, etc.). a binder (for example alpha-starch, gum arabic, carboxy-<br>
methylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, hydroxypropylcellulose, alginic acid,<br>
carbomer, dextrin, ethylcellulose, sodium alginate, maltodextrin, liquid glu-<br>
cose, magnesium aluminium silicate, hydroxyethylcellulose, methylcellu-<br>
lose, guar gum, etc.) and a lubricant (for example talc, magnesium<br>
stearate, polyethylene 6000, etc.) are, for example, added to the active<br>
principle(s) and the mixture obtained is then tabletted. If necessary, the<br>
tablet can be coated via the known techniques, in order to mask the taste<br>
(for example with cocoa powder, mint, borneol, cinnamon powder, etc.) or<br>
to allow enteric dissolution or sustained release of the active principles.<br><br>
The coating products that can be used are, for example, ethylcellulose,<br>
hydroxymethylcellulose, polyoxyethylene glycol, cellulose acetophthalate,<br>
hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate and Eudragit® (methacrylic acid-<br>
acrylic acid copolymer), Opadry® (hydroxypropylmethylcellulose +<br>
macrogol + titanium oxide + lactose monohydrate). Pharmaceutically ac-<br>
ceptable colorants may be added (for example yellow iron oxide, red iron<br>
oxide, quinoline yellow lake, etc.). Pharmaceutical forms such as tablets,<br>
powders, sachets and gel capsules can be used for an oral administration.<br>
The liquid pharmaceutical forms for oral administration include so-<br>
lutions, suspensions and emulsions. The aqueous solutions can be ob-<br>
tained by dissolving the active principles in water, followed by addition of<br>
flavourings, colorants, stabilisers and thickener, if necessary. In order to<br>
improve the solubility, it is possible to add ethanol, propylene glycol or<br>
other pharmaceutically acceptable non-aqueous solvents. The aqueous<br>
suspensions for oral use can be obtained by dispersing the finely divided<br>
active principles in water with a viscous product, such as natural or syn-<br>
thetic gums, resins, methyicellulose or sodium carboxymethylceliulose.<br>
The pharmaceutical forms for injection can be obtained, for exam-<br>
ple, by the following process. The active principle(s) is (are) dissolved,<br>
suspended or emulsified either in an aqueous medium (for example dis-<br>
tilled water, physiological saline, Ringer's solution, etc.) or in an oily me-<br>
dium (for example a plant oil, such as olive oil, sesameseed oil, cotton-<br>
seed oil, com oil, etc., or propylene giycol), with a dispersant (for example<br>
Tween 80, HCO 60 (Nikko Chemicals), polyethylene giycol, carboxy-<br>
methylcellulose, sodium alginate, etc.), a preserving agent (for example<br>
methyl p-hydroxybenzoate, propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, benzyl alcohol,<br>
chiorobutanol, phenol, etc.), an isotonicity agent (for example sodium chlo-<br>
ride, glycerol, sorbitol, glucose, etc.) and also other additives, such as, if<br>
desired, a solubilising agent (for example sodium salicylate, sodium ace-<br>
tate, etc.) or a stabiliser (for example human serum albumin).<br>
A pharmaceutical form for external use can be obtained from a<br>
solid, semi-solid or liquid composition containing the active principle(s).<br>
For example, to obtain a solid form, the active principle(s) is (are) treated,<br><br>
alone or as mixtures with exciplents (for example lactose, mannitol, starch,<br>
microcrystalline cellulose, sucrose, etc.) and a thickener (for example<br>
natural gums, cellulose derivatives, acrylic polymers, etc.) so as to convert<br>
them into powder. The liquid pharmaceutical compositions are prepared in<br>
substantially the same way as the forms for injection, as indicated previ-<br>
ously. The semi-solid pharmaceutical forms are preferably in the form of<br>
aqueous or oily gels or in the form of a pomade. These compositions may<br>
optionally contain a pH regulator (for example carbonic acid, phosphoric<br>
acid, citric acid, hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide, etc.) and a preserv-<br>
ing agent (for example p-hydroxybenzoic acid esters, chlorobutanol, benz-<br>
alkonium chloride, etc.) and also other additives.<br>
The relative proportion of the constituents of the pharmaceutical<br>
compositions of the present invention takes into account the recom-<br>
mended dosages of the respective active principles. The ratios of the re-<br>
spective amounts of the insulin secretion stimulator and of the compound<br>
of the formula (I) thus vary in consequence.<br>
The weight ratio of the insulin secretion stimulator to the compound<br>
of the formula (I) preferably ranges between 1/1000 and particularly from<br>
4/100 and especially from 1/500 to 4/100 or more preferably from 1/300 to<br>
4/100. The dosages will depend on those usually used for the active<br>
principles. Thus, for the insulin secretion stimulator, the dosages are<br>
between land 6 mg/day for glimepiride, from 1.5 to 15 mg/day for gliben-<br>
clamide, from 30 to 120 mg/day for gliclazide and from 2.5 to 20 mg/day<br>
for glipizide.<br>
For the compound of the formula (I), the daily dosages range from<br>
200 mg to 2000 mg. The preferred frequency of administration of the com-<br>
pounds of the invention is between one and two administrations per day.<br>
In cases where the doses of compounds of the formula (I) require more<br>
than one daily administration, the amounts of insulin secretion stimulator<br>
and the insulin secretion stimulator/compound of the formula (I) ratio will<br>
be adjusted in consequence.<br>
The aim of the present invention is also to propose a method of<br>
treatment via co-administration of an effective amount of a compound of<br><br>
the formula (I) and of an insulin secretion stimulator, and also kits for al-<br>
lowing this co-administration.<br>
The present invention also relates to kits that are suitable for the<br>
treatment by the methods described above. These kits comprise a compo-<br>
sition containing the compound of the formula (I) in the dosages indicated<br>
above and a second composition containing the insulin secretion stimula-<br>
tor in the dosages indicated above, for a simultaneous, separate or se-<br>
quential administration, in effective amounts according to the invention.<br>
The term "co-administration" means the simultaneous, separate or<br>
sequential administration of one or more compounds to the same patient,<br>
over a period that may be up to 2 hours or even up to 12 hours. For ex-<br>
ample, the term co-administration includes:<br>
(1)	a simultaneous administration of the two compounds,<br>
(2)	an administration of the first, followed 2 hours later by the ad-<br>
ministration of the second compound,<br>
(3)	an administration of the first, followed 12 hours later by the ad-<br>
ministration of the second compound.<br>
The examples below of compositions according to the invention are<br>
given as non-limiting illustrations.<br>
