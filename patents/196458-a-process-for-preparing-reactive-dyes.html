where n, D and G^ are each as defined above, shall be excluded,<br>
to their use for dyeing or printing hydroxyl-containing or ni¬trogenous organic substrates and to naphthylamines as intermedi¬ates therefor.<br>
The above-excluded dyes and intermediates are known from prior patent application WO 9610610.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide novel reactive dyes derived from phenyl- or naphthalene-azo-naphthalene dyes. The novel dyes shall have an advantageous application property profile.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by the reactive dyes of the formula I defined at the beginning.<br>
The novel reactive dyes of the formula I are each indicated in the form of the free acid, but salts thereof are also encompassed "by the claims, of course.<br><br>
Suitable cations are derived from metal or ammonium ions. Metal ions are in particular the lithium, sodium or potassium ions. Ammonium ions for the purposes of the present invention are sub¬stituted or unsubstituted ammonium cations. Substituted ammonium cations include for example monoalkyl-, dialkyl-, trialkyl-, tetraalkyl- or benzyltrialkyl-ammonium cations or cations derived/ from nitrogenous five- or six-membered saturated heterocycles,  (_ such as pyrrolidinium, piperidinium, morpholinium or piperazinium cations or their N-monoalkyl- or N,N-dialkyl-substituted prod¬ucts. Alkyl is generally to be understood as meaning straight-chain or branched C1-C2o-alkyl which may be substituted by 1 or 2 hydroxyl groups and/or interrupted by from 1 to 4 oxygen atoms in ether function.<br>
Any alkyl or alkylene herein can be straight-chain or branched.<br>
Any substituted alkyl herein generally contains 1 or 2 substitu-ents.<br>
Any substituted phenylene herein contains for example, unless otherwise stated, C1-C4-alkyl, C1-C4-alkoxy, halogen, hydroxysulfonyl, sulfamoyl or mono- or di-C1-C4-alkylsulfamoyl as substituents. Substituted phenylene then generally contains from 1 to 3, preferably 1 or 2, substituents.<br>

Q is an alkali-detachable group. Such groups include for example chlorine, bromine, C1-C4-alkylsulfonyl, phenylsulfonyl, OSO3H, SSO3H, 0P(0){0H)2/ C1-C4-alkylsulfonyloxy, substituted or unsubstituted phenylsulfonyloxy, C1-C4-alkanoyloxy, C1-C4-dialkyl-amino or a radical of the formula<br><br>

Suitable anions include for example fluoride, chloride, bromide, iodide, mono-, di- or trichloroacetate, methane-sulfonate, benzenesulfonate or 2- or 4-methylbenzenesulfonate.<br><br>
Anchor radical E undergo substitutive or additive reactions with the hydroxyl or nitrogenous groups of the substrates to be treated.<br>
The fact that the anchor radical reacts substitutively with the relevant groups in the substrates, for example with the hydroxyl groups of cellulose, means that the leaving groups or atoms (eg. fluorine or chlorine) in the anchor radical are replaced by the hydroxyl groups of the cellulose as per the following scheme:<br><br>
The fact that the anchor radical reacts additively with the rele¬vant groups in the substrates, for example with the hydroxyl groups of cellulose, means that the hydroxyl groups of the cellu¬lose are added to the anchor radical as per the following scheme:<br><br>
Heterocyclic anchor radicals E include for example halogen-con¬taining radicals derived from the following basic heterocyclic species: 1,3,S-triazine, quinoxaline, phthalazine, pyrimidine or pyridazine or the 2-alkylsulfonylbenzothiazole radical.<br>
The following are particularly suitable heterocyclic radicals:<br><br><br><br><br>
where<br>

where E, Y and T are each as defined above.<br>
Preference is given to reactive dyes of the formula I where R^ and R^ are each hydrogen.<br>
Preference is further given to reactive dyes of the formula I where E is hydrogen, a anchor radicals of the 1,3,5-triazine se¬ries or a radical of the formula SO2-Y, where Y is as defined above.<br>
Preference is further given to reactive dyes of the formula I where T is a radical of the formula CO or SO2 when n is 2.<br>
Preference is further given to reactive dyes of the formula I where n is 1.<br>
Preference is further given to reactive dyes of the formula I where the ring A is not benzofused.<br><br><br><br>
Particular preference is given to reactive dyes of the formula I where E is hydrogen or a radical of the formula SO2-Y, where Y is as defined above.<br>
Particular preference is further given to reactive dyes of the formula I, in particular of the formulae I a-d, where the radical of the formula SO2-Y is disposed ortho to the azo group.<br>
The novel reactive dyes of the formula I are obtainable in a con¬ventional manner.<br>
For example, an aniline of the formula lla or lib<br><br><br><br><br><br>
The novel naphthylamines of the formula III are obtainable in a conventional manner.<br>
For example, a naphthylene derivative of the formula IV<br><br>
where G^ and G^ are each as defined above, can be reacted in a basic medium with the addition product of an alkali metal bisulfite with formaldehyde, eg. formaldehyde sodium bisulfite of the formula HOCHaSOaNa.<br>
By partial hydrolysis in the alkaline region the hydroxysulfonyl-amino group can also be converted back into the free amino group.<br>
The novel reactive dyes of the formula I are advantageously use¬ful for dyeing or printing hydroxyl-containing or nitrogenous or¬ganic substrates. Such substrates include for example leather or fiber material predominantly comprising natural or synthetic polyamides or natural or regenerated cellulose. The novel dyes are preferably useful for dyeing and printing textile material based on wool and in particular on cotton. The dyeings obtained have red shades.<br>
Cellulose-based substrates in particular are dyed with a very high yield of fixation in strong dyeings having very good light-fastness and also excellent wetfastness properties, such as wash, chlorine bleach, peroxide bleach, alkali, seawater or perspira¬tion fastness properties.<br><br><br><br>
wherein the ring A may be benzofused, R^, R"^ and R^ are each independently of the other hydrogen, C4-alkyl, CrC4-alkoxy, halogen or hydroxysulfonyl, E is hydrogen; a heterocyclic anchor radical or a anchor radical of the aliphatic series, Y is vinyl or a radical of the formula C2H4-Q, where Q is an alkali-detachable group, and T is a bridge member, with the proviso that at least one hydroxysulfonylmethyl group shall be present in the<br><br><br>
in a known manner and then coupling with aminonaphthalene of the formula III<br><br>
