				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a battery terminal connector adapted to connect electric<br>
wires to a terminal of a lead acid battery and more particularly to a simple structure of<br>
battery terminal which is inexpensive to manufacture, easy to handle, less time<br>
consuming, more durable and long lasting and can positively be secured to the terminal<br>
of the battery.<br>
Description of the related Art<br>
Storage batteries of the type used in automobiles, generators and trucks and the like,<br>
generally have two terminal posts made of a lead alloy material having truncated conical<br>
shape to I.S. specification No.-7372-1995 &amp; JIS(Japan), specification No:-D5301-1999.<br>
To fasten the end(s) of wire(s) or cable(s) to battery terminals is a common practice. With<br>
progress of engineering, various means, tools tackles and devices have been developed<br>
to achieve the goal in such a way that needs minimum time and effort.<br>
The battery is connected to the vehicle electrical system by a battery cable assembly. The<br>
cable assembly has connectors which clamp to the battery posts, providing a secure<br>
electrical and mechanical connection. A conventional connector for connecting cables to<br>
the battery is a metallic molded, generally U-shaped device with a bolt passing through<br>
outwardly projecting yoke-like arms for securely clamping the connector to the battery<br>
post. The connector may also be a stamped metal battery terminal connector, fabricated<br>
from sheet metal.<br>
US57331S2 is directed to a battery connector which permits mechanical and electrical<br>
connection to a battery terminal post. The connector of the patent no. US5733152 has<br>
enhanced resistance to rotation when connected to a battery terminal post. This connector<br>
is adaptable for automated assembly. It is also adaptable to different automobile models<br>
and batteries.<br>
US5879202 is also directed to a battery connector. This connector is of the type that<br>
permits it to be tightened on the battery post that are positioned above rather than on the<br>
side of the connector.<br>
The known art for securing the end(s) of the wires and cables initially consisted in tying<br>
or twisting the ends of the wire and cable strands to the terminals or connectors. With the<br>
added requirement of tight clamping to terminals or connectors for proper current<br>
conduction, lugs that were clamped or crimped to the end(s) of the wire(s) or cable(s) on<br>
one end and securely clamped screwed or bolted to the terminal on the other end using<br>
hand tools or power tools gained favor of usage. Additional relevant prior art references<br>
include US6250973, US5941738, US5879202, US5800219, US5738552, US5711688,<br><br>
US5672442, US5599210, US5316505 and US4354726. None of these patents, however<br>
alone or in combination, disclose the present invention.<br>
However, all above the known device for securing the ends of wires and cables<br>
particularly for conducting electrical power, have major drawbacks.<br>
Firstly, The process by using the clamping or de-clamping device which connect the ends<br>
of wires and cables from the terrninal(s) was a time consuming and cumbersome so that<br>
in condition where the end(s) of wire(s), cable(s) require to frequently clamped to and de-<br>
clamped from the terminal and upkeep of the related system(s), these activities of proper<br>
and repetitively tight clamping or de-clamping can not be carried out to the desired level<br>
of satisfaction and frequency, which contributes to reduction of life of the related system.<br>
Secondly, such clamping or de-clamping would almost always required the use of hand<br>
or power tools like spanners, screw drives, pliers or any other standard or tailor-made<br>
tools. In actual working conditions very often such tools are not readily available when<br>
required. Also in areas and places where access is not easy, it is very difficult to perform<br>
the clamping or de-clamping activity using such tools. The above reasons constitute a<br>
considerable psychological deterrent to workers and operators to the activity of properly<br>
clamping or de-clamping the cable(s), wire(s) or lead(s) using hand or power tools.<br>
Thirdly, the lugs or end connection of the known art are almost always of an metal<br>
construction, This exposes the workers or operator to the risk of sustaining injury from<br>
heat or electrical shock, if, while clamping or de-clamping, he or she accidentally touches<br>
the said exposed metal part, which might become too hot to touch, or carry electricity.<br>
Consequently, clamping or de-clamping would necessarily have to be done under<br>
conditions where the wire(s) or cable(s) are not carrying any electricity and are<br>
sufficiently cold to touch.<br>
Fourthly, In such clamping or de-clamping is done under current carrying or in live<br>
condition, the process will be slow, and might result in considerable sparking between the<br>
wire(s) or cable(s) end(s) which may be damaging to the related equipments) or<br>
system(s).<br>
The battery connector for car battery is now often used as U shaped brass clamp whish is<br>
fitted with nuts and bolts. To clamp or to de-clamp the connector a crew driver and small<br>
tools or wrench are needed. Apart from that, this clamping or de-clamping process is time<br>
consuming as well as need human effort and technical know-how. Any other person who<br>
has not enough physical strength cannot clamp or de-clamp by using ordinary tools. For<br>
this reason it is seen that battery connectors often remains in connected position for years<br>
which creates many difficulties which as follows:<br>
a)	Heavy oxides and sulphides are formed all over the battery connector which<br>
causes poor conductivity at the point of contact in battery.<br>
b)	Under these heavy oxide condition the resistant at the point of contact is increased<br>
which causes the heating of terminal during activation of self starter.<br>
c)	The long time connection corrodes the battery terminals.<br><br>
d) The long time connection will reduce the life of the battery and after that this<br>
battery will not be in used.<br>
Hence an improved device for connecting the battery terminal is desired to overcome<br>
the disadvantages of the related art.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
Accordingly an object of the present invention is to provide a battery connector being<br>
capable of establishing a reliable electrical connection for quick clamping and de-<br>
clamping and providing protection against corrosion, low battery life and leading to<br>
quick safe, easy and respectively proper clamping and de-clamping.<br>
Detailed description of the invention with accompanying drawings<br>
There are many possible embodiments of this invention. The drawings and description<br>
below describe in detail a preferred embodiment of the invention. It should be understood<br>
that the present disclosure is to be considered as an example of the present invention.<br>
The principal object of the invention is to provide an improved device for connecting the<br>
battery terminal.<br>

The main aims of this invention to provide an improved connector device which<br>
comprises<br>
a)	A top cap( 1) is on the top of device,<br>
b)	A fly nut(2) which is cladded with polymer is just below the top cap which has to<br>
rotate clockwise for proper clamping.<br>
c)	A cavity (3) made up of brass, the connector which goes through the conical lead<br>
terminal of the battery<br>
d)	A brass jacket(4) is just inside the fly nut for tightening the connector.<br>
e)	A brass plug(5) which is a part of brass component that forms the cavity (3) lise<br>
above the cavity.<br>
f)	A thread (6) which is an inclined plane for which advantage is taken to push the<br>
cylinder(7) downwards.<br>
g)	Grips on side of the fly nut(2) to put force on the fly nut.<br>
Characterized in that the force exerted by finger on the both ends of the fly nut(2)<br>
produces a couple whose magnitude is 2 'K' x 'X' where in 'K' = force exerted by<br>
finger, and X = distance between the two force.<br>
The advantages and novel features of the invention will become more apparent from<br>
the following detailed description when taken in conjugation with accompanying<br>
drawings and these drawings are illustrative in explaining the constructional details of<br>
the device of the invention. Such drawings are shown in 3 sheets.<br>
The improved device of the present invention makes the use of a cantilever and<br>
linkage mechanism to achieve repetitive clamping and de-clamping. The brass jacket<br><br>
(4) and brass plug(5) are made of brass because of it is high current conductive<br>
material. The cantilever leaf (7) are also made strong material that can be withstand<br>
high temperature and sufficiently wear resistant for repeating clamping and de-<br>
clamping.<br>
The fly nut is cladded with suitable polymeric material (such as high density<br>
polyethylene, polypropylene, Teflon, polyester or copolymers thereof.) that is<br>
sufficiently strong, electrically and thermally insulated with resistant to high<br>
temperature.<br>
When the force exerted on both ends of the fly nut (2) it produces a couple. This<br>
couple forms a heavy torque on the single start thread (6). The figure 1 is sectional<br>
view of the battery connector of the present invention. In fig 1 the single start thread<br>
(6) is an inclined plain. This thread is a screw. Since it is a screw, the cylinder (7) is<br>
forced to move downwards for clamping. The cylinder (7) is hollow and it is leaf of<br>
collapsing funnel. It acts a cantilever (7).<br>
The one of the advantage and novel feature of the present invention is the funnel like<br>
geometry of the collapsing cylinder (7) so that when collapsing force is applied at the<br>
free end of the cantilever more effective and stronger grip will be on lead terminal of<br>
the battery.<br>
The one of the advantage and novel feature of the present invention is that the thread<br>
(6) is an inclined plain that is screw. Since it is screw type, force is applied to move<br>
the cylinder (7) downwards for clamping. One of the important point for this features<br>
is that diameter of the inclined plain (6) and angle of the inclination of the screw<br>
plain. (Number of thread/ cm). There is vertical movement of the cylinder.<br>
All the aforesaid mechanical advantages have been combined ingeniously. As a result<br>
the connector grips the battery post tightly.<br>
This invention also relates to a process for clamping and de-clamping the battery<br>
connector by using invented device.<br><br>
This process comprises<br>
a)	the cavity of the connector (3) is to be pushed tightly through the conical lead<br>
terminal.<br>
b)	The connector marked with positive mark (+) should be inserted in the positive<br>
marked (+) lead terminal of the battery and the connector marked with negative<br>
mark (-) should be inserted in the negative marked (-) lead terminal of the battery.<br>
c)	After fitting the connector on the battery terminals, the arm (8) of the fly nut (2)<br>
of the connector has to rotate by hand in clockwise direction by giving gentle<br>
downward pressure.<br>
d)	Tighten the fly nut (2) firmly.<br>
e)	To open the connector, the fly nut (2) has to rotate by hand in anticlockwise<br>
direction.<br>
Another point is that to clamp the end of the cable(s) to the end of the device the<br>
screw number may be varied according the specific requirement. Further it also to<br>
noted that the link and lever mechanism may be varied to achieve this goal.<br>
The device of the invention finds particular use in batteries for automobile,<br>
generators and such engines, machinery or equipment, which require frequent<br>
clamping and de-clamping between the leads and terminals. For example, if any<br>
such engine or machinery or equipment remains idle for a considerable lengths of<br>
time, it is always advisable to disconnect the leads from the terminals to reduce<br>
drainage of current that would otherwise reduce charges level of the battery to<br>
such an extent that could either render the battery unusable or damage the related<br>
equipment or system. Simultaneously, a similar device can be used on the ends of<br>
a battery charger which then can be quickly connected to the battery terminals for<br>
charging or recharging or trickle charging for maintenance of required charge<br>
levels. The device being easily operated with one hand can be used in areas where<br>
it is normally very difficult to work with tools.<br><br>
The cover-cum-handle can be different, distinct colors and can have provisions<br>
for carrying tags or ferrules for individual identification. This would greatly<br>
reduce the risk of wrong connections which could otherwise lead to failures of the<br>
related equipment(s) or system(s).<br>
The fig.(2) shows the top cap made up of strong &amp; rigid polymer. It is fitted over<br>
the connecting wire to prevent exposure of the necked portion of the wire that<br>
caries heavy current from the battery. The top cap is clamped with the brass nut<br>
(5) by a bayonet catch as it is done in the holder of a electric bulb.<br>
The following lines summarize the advantages of the improved device of this<br>
invention over the prior art and technology:<br>
a)	The present device is able to achieve repetitive firm clamping and de-<br>
clamping in quick and less human effort.<br>
b)	The device of this invention can be operated using one hand as well as by any<br>
person, not necessary to know any technical knowledge.<br>
c)	The device of this invention is safe against accidental thermal or electrical<br>
shocks to operator or worker.<br>
d)	The improved device can bear distinct identification by way of color<br>
differentiation and numbering codes to avoid accidental wrong connection.<br>
e)	The improved device is helpful for periodical cleaning of the battery terminal.<br>
f)	This cleaning also increases the longevity of the battery.<br>
g)	The improved battery connector is more durable and has long life.<br>
The connector of the present invention affords easy and convenient connection<br>
and disconnection from the battery terminal through rotation. Along with the<br>
remaining, described structure this construction prevents over torquing of the<br>
connector. It is under stood that, given the above description of the embodiments<br>
of the invention, various modifications may be made by one skilled in the art.<br>
