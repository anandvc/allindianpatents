A.	Back ground for the invention of load mover screw jack:<br>
Load mover screw jack is related to field of mechanical / &amp; automobile engineering. With the existing technology, it is possible to increase the speed of any vehicle widi only IC engines or battery operated motors, etc. Gear systems are available for bicycles only; even then speed is limited.<br>
When compared to cycles and motor car, load mover screw jack moves vehicle by human efforts through screw jack, requires no fuel and IC engine, has gear box with incremental gear ratio, speed is achieved is as that of a motor car while cheaper than it, economical even for single seated and gives out no pollution. The object is to bring forth cost effective, smokeless, fuel independent and safe travel vehicle. The aim is to move and increase speed of a vehicle under the application of possible human efforts only.<br>
B.	Surmnarv of the invention:<br>
It is a device for moving vehicle by transmitting part of gravitational forces of vehicle to the input, the point of virtually increased friction of road resistance, of gear box with high output to input gear ratio, by balancing major part of weight of vehicle and effort. When effort is applied the major part of weight of vehicle is shifted from the points of contact on road to the point of virtually increased friction of road resistance using different systems screw jack.<br>
In a tricycle, effort applied to the crank sprocket is transmitted to the free wheel of the back wheel directly through an endless chain.<br>
To speed up this vehicle, a gear box with high output to input gear ratio is utilized. The output of this gear box is connected to the free wheel and the input is linked to a spur gear which forms the base for the screw jack and the top of the screw is linked to the top frame structure through a ball bearing. The outer covering of the ball bearing is fixed to the bottom surface of the top frame structure and hence the entire screw jack is held without falling.<br>
For the screw to be rotated, bevel gears are arranged such that the bigger part of bevel gears holds the screw in its upper part and the smaller part is driven by crank sprocket through an endless chain and a free wheel.<br>
When an effort is applied at the input of the bevel gears, the screw rotates. As it rotates it tries to lift the vehicle through the top ball bearing. The driving spur gear finds very high virtually increased road resistance, VIRi. Taking this resistance as fixed support the screw tries to come out of the jack. In this process, major part of weight of vehicle is given lift effect. The remaning part of weight of vehicle now forms a new virtually increased resistance VIR2. This happens as effort applied is being increased in its magnitude. When major part of weight of vehicle given lift effect equals this VIR2, the vehicle is set to motion.<br><br>
C, Description of the invention<br>
The force reqxiired, to be applied, for tricycle to move is through human effort and weight, which is jxxst sufficient to overcome the static friction of road resistance. The speed<br>
attained is about 12-km/hr,<br>
The crank sprocket drives the free wheel through an endless chain directly overcoming the road resistance, in a tricycle. For increasing this speed twice or thrice, a speed increasing device, a gear box with high gear ratio can be provided, but that will increase the requirement of more effort. Considering this gear box has a gear ratio 1:10, it means that for one rotation by crank sprocket, the output of the gear box rotates by ten times. This arrangement in turn increases the road resistance as available on the circumference of the free wheel to ten times on the crank shaft. Effort required to overcome this virtually increased road resistance will be very much higher than that of humanly possible.<br>
This invention describes the method how tlus road resistance can be reduced, how the effort required is managed in order to move and speed up a vehicle using a load lifting<br>
machine. Screw Jack and how it is arranged in a vehicle.<br>
With reference to fig (i), effort is applied through crank sprocket assembly (7) and bevel gears (6), The screw (5), fixed axially to the bigger part of bevel gears, rotates. The screw tries to come out of the body of the jack (4) in order to lift the vehicle. The virtually increased fiiction of road resistance, which acts as a fixed support to the screw jack, is available through the driving spur gear (2). When the screw jack is forced to lift the vehicle, instead of vehicle being lifted up, major part of weight of the vehicle passes on to the body jack. Because of compulsion of effort, fixed structure on top and the virtually increased road resistance available through the spur gear, the body of the jack rotates in the same direction of the screw and hence the driving spur gear rotates. When the major part of weight of vehicle given lift effect is equal to the virtually increased fiiction of road resistance caused due to the remaining part of weight of vehicle and the effort, the vehicle is set to motion.<br>
Weight of vehicle on the point of contact on road gradually reduces and gets shifted to the spur gear as torque. This tends the road resistance to decrease, which in turn reduces the virtually increased fiiction of road resistance from very high value. Li other words, major part of weight of vehicle is supplied as the torque reqmred to rotate the driving spur gear overcoming the virtually increased fiiction of road resistance caused due to the remaining part of weight of vehicle.<br>
With reference to fig (ii), effort is applied through crank sprocket assembly (7) and spur gears (23) &amp; (6), The screw (5), fixed axially to the spur gear (6), rotates. The screw tries to go into the body of the jack (4) in order to lift: the vehicle. The arrangement of the screw bearing (20) and the nut bearing (19) enable free lifting of vehicle through the levers (17) and (18). The virtually increased friction of road resistance, which acts as a fixed support to the screw jack, is available through the driving spur gear (2). When the major<br><br>
part of weight of vehicle given lift effect is equal to the virtually increased Mction of road resistance caused due to the remaining part of weight of vehicle and the effort, the body of the screw jack follows the screw in rotation and so the driving spur gear. The vehicle is then set to motion.<br>
Description in detail:<br>
With reference to fig (i), when an effort is applied to the load mover screw jack, part of weightt of vehicle is getting shifted to the input of gear box whose ouput to input gear ratio is more than one.<br>
Force (F) = mass x acceleration (m x a)<br>
Weight is also a Force.<br>
Weight (W) = mass x acceleration due to gravity (m x g)<br>
This weight or gravitational force is split up into two. One part is allowed to exert road resistance and the other part is made to overcome the virtually increased resistance at the input of gear box with low to high ouput gear ratio, of this road resistance. This is made possible using a load lifting machine. The first gear ratio is selected such that the virtually increased road resistance at the input of gear box is more than the weight of vehicle and the speed attainable is at least equal to the speed of a tricycle.<br>
1.	The road resistance is dependant on the weight of vehicle and its direction is<br>
perpendicular to that of gravity.<br>
To get increase in speed, a gear box with gear ratio with high output, i.e. gear box with gear ratio as 1:10, 1:20, 1:30, etc. and gear shift mechanism, is connected to the free wheel which is fixed axially on the shaft that drives the back wheels.<br>
2.	This gear box arrangement offers a virtually increased resistance of the road<br>
resistance at the input of the gear box<br>
The first gear ratio is selected so that this virtually increased fiiction of road resistance is greater than the weight of vehicle and human weights and the speed attainable is at least equal to the speed of a tricycle. The vehicle is always in first gear ratio while remaining in stationary. When the gear ratio 1:10 is selected, it means than for one rotation at input of gear box, the free wheel at the output of gear box rotates by 10 times. But the road resistance available on free wheel is getting multiplied by 10 times. To overcome this virtually increased resistance is not humanly possibie,<br>
3.	This virtually increased resistance of road resistance is available on the<br>
circumference of the driving spur gear<br>
The virtually increased resistance is available in a plane parallel to that of road resistance and perpendicular to the gravitational forces acting on the vehicle, as the input of gear box is couoled to driving spur gear.<br><br>
4.	The driving spur gear is placed as the base for the Screw Jack.<br>
The driving spur gear physically represents the virtually increased resistance.<br>
5.	The Screw Jack is so arranged that it takes this virtually increased resistance<br>
of road resistance as equivalent ground support and the vdiicle has to be lifted<br>
through top frame structure.<br>
The legs of the Screw Jack are firmly fixed on the driving spur gear. The top of the screw is connected to the bottom frame structure through a ball bearing. This enables fi-ee rotation of screw while it tries to lift the vehicle on application of effort.<br>
6.	Application of effort is through Bevel Gears.<br>
The upper part of screw is fixed with Bevel Gears<br>
7.	Top of screw is connected to the top frame structure through a ball bearing.<br>
The outer covering of this bearing is fixed to the top frame. This enables the screw to rotate freely and the entire screw jack is held without falling.<br>
8.	Application of effort tries the screw to come out of the nut<br>
When effort is applied, the bigger part of bevel gears tries to rotate along with the body of the screw. The body of the screw is firmly fixed on the driving spur gear. The driving spur gear is imable to rotate due to very high virtually increased resistance offered by the input spur gear. With this virtually ino-eased resistance as the support, when the effort value is increased, the screw tries to come out of the body of the jack. Still this is not possible, because the entire load is not lifted. When nearly 70% of load is given lift effect, the road resistance due to remaining 30% of weight of vehicle becomes less and hemce the virtually incr^^d road resistance also gets reduced from its very high initial value.<br>
9.	When this nearly 70% of load given lift effect matches to the new VIR, the<br>
vehicle is set to motion.<br>
Nearly 70% of weight of vehicle is being lifted up. The virtually increased fiiction of road resistance due to 30% of weight of vehicle equals this 70% of weight. The actual lifting of vehicle occurs only when 100% of weight of vehicle is lifted up. But before this could happexk^ the major part of wei^t of vehicle ov^comes the virtually increased friction of road resistance and the vehicle is set to motion.<br>
10.	While vehicle moves, by changing to second gear ratio, the dynamic resistance<br>
h multiplied as new virtual^ increased resistance.<br>
Using gear shift mechanism (16), the gear is shifted to second gear ratio applying gear shift enable control lever (15). The gear shift enable control lever, when ^plied,<br><br>
arrests any possible rotation of driven sprocket to enable shifting of gear ratio. With the remaining part of weight of vdiicle, wh^ effort is ^plied, m^or p^ of this<br>
remaining part of weight of vehicle is given lift effect to overcome this new virtually increased road resistance.<br><br><br><br>
3.  Tte mathematical model:<br>
Weight of vehicle is 1000 kgms. Acceleration due to gravity is lOm/second square; fence wei^t of vehicle in Newtcm is 10000. The coefBdeait of initial static road<br>
resistance is 0.2. Hence, the road resistance is 2000 Newton.<br>
Hie gear ratio is so arranged that the virtually increased friction of road resistance is more ftan the weight of vdiicle. Also to get mecd^anical advant^e the screw jade allows the lifting of vehicle by one turn for 20 rotations of crank sprocket. Gear ratio selected is 1:40. In otdct to get the speed of a normal tricycle, first gear ratio needs to be selected as 40. As the speed ratio is reduced as 20:1 to get mechanical advantage, the selection of ge^ ratio as 1:40 compoisates, resulting tte net ge^ ratio of 1:2 which is equivalent to that of normal tricycle.<br>
With respect to the spur gear, the gear ratio at the ou^ut is 40 and hence the virtually increased resistance is 80000 Newton.  The sorew jack takes this as fixed<br>
support and tries to lift the vehicle.<br>
In order to give a lift effect of vehicle, the effort needed at the crank sprocket is tsksn as 44 kg of weight 440 Newton. This effort enables 8800 (440 multiplied by 20 times due to mechanical advantage) Newton out of 10000 Newton of weight of vehicle to be lifted Some important mathanatical instances are re^eseaited in the following table for reference.<br><br><br><br><br>
Brief description of mathematical model:<br>
1. With respect to the 80000 Newton of initial static road resistance, when 400 Newton of eflFort is applied on the crank sprocket, 8890 Newton of wei^t of vehicle is given lift effect by the screw jack. The remaining i^rt of weight of vehicle is 1110 Newton which causes the new static ro^ resistance of 222 Newton. I^is, when multiplied by first gear ratio of 40, forms a virtually increased resistance of 8880 Newton. Hence the vehicle is set to motion at first gear ratio. The effective gear ratio available with re^ject to the crank sprocket is 2. This is equivsdent to gettii^ the speed of a tricycle i.eJ2kms/hr.Tte tangential force available on the circumference of the spur gear is 8890 (10000-1110) Newton, All resistances, such as aero dynamic resistance, are given a fector of 5890 Newton and deducted from 8890 Newton. The vehicle is now in movement with inertia as 3000 Newton.<br><br>
2.	Now the gear shifted to second gear stage. When 280 Newton of effort is applied on the crmik sprocket, 5600 Newton of weight of vehicle is given lift effect by the screw jack. The remaining part of weight of vehicle is 1400 Newttm which causes the new dynamic road resistance of 70 Newton. This, when multiplied by second gear ratio of 80, forms a new virtually increased resistance of 5600 NcAvton. Hence the vehicle is set to motion at second gear ratio. The effective gear ratio available vdth re^&gt;ect to the crank ^rodcet is 4. This is equivalent to getting the speed of a tricycle i.e.24kms/hr.The tangential force available on the circumference of the spur gear is 5600 Newton. All resistances, such as aero dynamic resistance, are given a factor of 4600 Newton and deducted fi'om 5600 Newton. The net effective t^igential fwce of 1000 Newton is added on to the inertia of 3000 Newton. The vehicle is now in movement with in^ia as 4000 Newton.<br>
3.	Now the gear shifted to third gear stage. When 210 Nevrton of effort is applied on the crank sprocket, 4240 Newton of wei^t of vehicle is given lift effect by the screw jack. The remaining part of weight of vehicle is 1700 Newton which causes the new dynamic road resistance of 26.4 Newton. This, when multiplied by third gear ratio of 160, forms a new virtually increased resistance of 4224 Newton. Hence the vehicle is set to motion at third gear ratio. The effective gear ratio available with respect to the crank sprocket is 8. This is equivalent to getting the speed of a tricycle i.e.48kms/hr. The tangential force available on the circumference of the spur gear is 4240 Newton. All resistances, such as aero dynmnic resistance, are given a factor of 2640 Newton and deducted from 4240 TSlewton. The net effective tangential force of 1600 Newton is added on to the ii^rtia of 4000 Newton. The vehicle is now in movement with inertia as 5600 Newton.<br>
4.	Now the gear shifted to fourth gear stage. When 170 Newton of effort is applied on the crank sprocket, 3360 Newton of weight of vehicle is given lift effect by the screw jack. The remaining part of weight of vehicle is 1040 Newton which causes the new dynamic road resistance of 10.4 Nevrton. This, when multiplied by fourth<br><br>
gear ratio of 320, forms a new virtually increased resistance of 3328 Newton. Hence the vehicle is set to motion at foxirth gear ratio. The effective gear ratio available with re^&gt;ect to the crank ^Mrocket is 16. This is equivalent to getting the speed of a tricycle i.e.96kms/te. The tangential force available on the circumference of the spur gear is 3360 Newton. All resistances, snch as aero djTiamic resistance, are given a factor of 1460 Newton and deducted from 3360 Newton. The net effective tangential force of 1900 Newton is added on to the inertia of 5600 Newton. The vehicle is now in mov^nent with inertia as 7500 Newton.<br>
5. The weight of vehicle to be given lift effect is getting on reduced. Hence the effort required is becoming less. The effort can also be reduced by choice of screw jack with better mechanical advantage. But this should be compensated by choosing high gear ratio of the gear box.<br>
