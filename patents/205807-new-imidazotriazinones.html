COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"NEW IMIDAZOTRIAZINONES<br>
BAYER AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT, a body corporate organized under the laws of Germany, D-51368 Leverkusen, Germany,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
The present invention relates to novel imidazotriazinones, to processes for their preparation and to their use as medicaments, in particular as inhibitors of cGMP-metabolizing phosphodiesterases.<br>
The published specificiation DE-OS 2811780 describes imidazotriazines as broncho-dilators having spasmolytic activity and inhibitory activity against phosphodiesterases which metabolize cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP-PDEs. nomenclature according to Beavo: PDE III and PDE IV). An inhibitory action against phosphodiesterases which metabolize cyclic guanosine monophosphate [cGMP-PDEs, nomeclature according to Beavo and Reifsnyder (Trends in Pharmacol. Sci. 11, 150-155, 1990) PDE I, PDE II and PDEV] has not been described. Furthermore, FR-22 13 058, CH-59 46 71. DE-22 55 172: DE-23 64 076 and EP-000 9384 describe imidazotriazinones which do not have a substituted aryl radical in the 2 position and are likewise said to be bronchodilatators having cAMP-PDE-inhibitory action.<br>
WO-A-99/24433 likewise describes imidazotriazinones as inhibitors of cGMP-meta-bolizing phosphodiesterase; however, these compounds, by definition, all have a sulfonamide group in the phenyl ring, in the position para to the alkoxy group.<br>
An increase in the cGMP concentration can lead to beneficial antiaggregatory, antithrombotic, antiprolific. antivasospastic. vasodilative, natriuretic and diuretic effects. It can influence the short- or long-term modulation of vascular and cardiac inotropy, of the pulse and of cardiac conduction (.1. C. Stoclet, T. Keravis, N. Komas and C. Kugnier. Exp. Opin. Invest. Drugs (1995). 4 (]]), 1081-1100). Inhibition of cGMP-PDEs can also enhance erections. Accordingly, such compounds are suitable for treating erectile dysfunction.<br><br>

Depending on the substitution pattern, the compounds of the general formula (I)<br>
according to the invention may exist in stereoisomeric forms which are either like<br>
image and mirror image (enantiomers), or which are not like image and mirror image<br>
5	(diastereomers). The invention relates both to the enantiomers or diastereomers and to<br>
their respective mixtures. The racemic forms can, just like the diastereomers, be separated in a known manner into the stereoisomerically uniform constituents.<br>
Certain compounds of the general  formula (I) may furthermore be present in<br>
10	tautomeric forms. This is known to the person skilled in the art, and such compounds<br>
are also within the scope of the invention.<br>
Physiologically acceptable, i.e. pharmaceuticaly acceptable, salts can be salts of the compounds according to the invention with inorganic or organic acids. Preference is<br>
15	given  to  salts with  inorganic   acids  such  as,  for  example, hydrochloric  acid,<br>
hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid or sulfuric acid, or salts with organic carboxylic or sulfonic acids such as. for example, acetic acid, propionic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, malic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, lactic acid, benzoic acid, or methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, toluenesulfonic acid<br>
20	or naphthalenedisulfonic acid.<br>
Pharmaceutical!}' acceptable  salts  that  may  be  mentioned  are  also  salts with<br>
cusiomary bases, such as, for example, alkali metal salts (for example sodium salts or<br>
potassium salts), alkaline earth metal salts (for example calcium salts or magnesium<br>
25	salts) or ammonium salts derived from ammonia or organic amines such as, for<br>
example, diethylamine. triethylamine, ethyldiisopropylamine, procaine, dibenzylamine, N-methylmorpholine, dihydroabietylamine or methylpiperidine.<br>
"Hydrates" according to the invention are those forms of the compounds of the above<br>
30	general formula (1) which, in solid or liquid state, form a molecular compound (solvate)<br>
with water by hydration. In the hydrates, the water molecules form an adduct bv<br><br>
intramolecular forces, in particular hydrogen bonds. Solid hydrates contain water as<br>
water of crystallization in stoichiometric ratios, it not being necessary for the water<br>
molecules to be equivalent with respect to their binding state. Examples of hydrates are<br>
sesquihydrates, monohydrates. dihydrates or trihydrates. Also suitable are the hydrates<br>
5	of salts of the compounds according to the invention.<br>
"Prodrugs" accordingjo the invention are forms of the compounds of the above general<br>
formula (I) which, for their part, may be biologically active or inactive, but which can<br>
be   converted   into   the   corresponding   biologically   active   form   (for   example<br>
10	metabolically, solvolytically or by other means).<br>
(C1-C12)-Alkyl denotes a straight-chain or branched alky] radical having 1 to 12 carbon<br>
atoms. Examples which may be mentioned are: methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl.<br>

25	(C1-C6)-Alkoxy denotes a straight-chain or branched alkoxy radical having 1 to 6<br>
carbon atoms. Examples which may be mentioned are: methoxy. ethoxy. n-propoxy. isopropoxy, n-butoxy, isobutoxy, tert-butoxy, n-pentoxy and n-hexoxy. Derived from this definition are. in an analogous manner, the corresponding alkoxy groups having fewer carbon atoms, such as. for example, (C1-C6)-alkoxy and (C1-C4)-a]koxy. In<br>
30	general, preference is given to (C1-C4)-alkoxy.<br><br>
Also derived from this definition is the meaning of the coiTesponding component of other, more complex substituents. such as, for example, alkoxycarbonyl.<br>
(C6-C12)-Aryl denotes an aromatic radical having 6 to 12 carbon atoms. Examples<br>
5	which may be mentioned are: phenyl and naphtbyl.<br>
5- to 6-membered aromatic or saturated heterocvcle having up to 3 heteroatoms from the group consisting of S. N and O denotes either a heteroaromatic radica] which is attached via a ring carbon atom of the heteroaromatic compound or. if appropriate, also<br>
10	via a ring nitrogen atom of the heteroaromatic compound; examples which may be<br>
mentioned are: pyridyl, pyrimidyl, pyridazinyl, pyrazinyl, thienyl, furyl, pyrrolyl, pyrazolyl, imidazolyl. thiazolyl, oxazolyl or isoxazolyl, preference being given to pyridyl, pyrimidyl, pyridazinyl, fury] and thienyl, or denotes a saturated heterocycle which is attached via a ring carbon atom or a ring nitrogen atom, or denotes a (C5-C6)-<br>
15	cycloalkyl radical  as mentioned above; examples which may be mentioned are:<br>
letrahydrofuryl, pyrrolidinyl, piperidinyl, piperazinyl. morpholinyl, thiomorpholinyl, cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl, piperidinyl. morpbohny] and pyrrolidinyl being preferred.<br>

Solvents which are suitable for the individual steps are the customary organic solvents which do not change under the reaction conditions. These preferably include ethers, such as diethyl ether, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, glycol dimethyl ether, or hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene, xylene, hexane, cvclohexane or mineral oil fractions, or halogenated hydrocarbons, such as dichloromethane. trichloromethane, carbon tetrachloride, dichloroethane. trichloroethylene or chlorobenzene, or ethyl acetate, dimethylformamide, hexamethylphosphoric triamide. acetonitrile, acetone, dimethoxyethane or pyridine. It is also possible to use mixtures of the solvents mentioned.<br>
The reaction temperatures can generally be varied within a relatively wide range. In general, the reactions are carried out in a range of from -20Â°C to 200Â°C, preferably from 0Â°C to 70Â°C.<br><br>
The process steps according to the invention are generally carried out at atmospheric pressure. However, it is also possible to operate under elevated pressure or reduced pressure (for example in a range of from 0.5 to 5 bar).<br>
5	The reactions can be carried out. for example, in a temperature range of from 0Â°C to<br>
room temperature and at atmospheric pressure.<br>
The compounds of the general formula (II) can be prepared by converting compounds of the general formula (XII)<br><br>
in which<br>
RJ        is as defined above<br>

to the compounds of the general formula (XIV)<br><br><br>
in which<br><br>
R1, R2 and R3 are as defined above 5<br>
and then cyclizing these by action of POCI3 to give compounds of the general formula (II). For details of this process, reference can be made to WO-A-99/24433, the content of which is hereby included in its entirety by reference.<br>
10	Most of the compounds of the general formulae (III), (IV), (VII), (VIII) and (X) are<br>
novel and can be prepared as described above.<br><br>
15<br><br>
The compounds of the general formulae (V), (VI), (XI), (XII), (XIII) and (XIV) are known per se or can be prepared by customary methods.<br>
Some of the compounds of the genera] formula (IX) are novel, and they can be prepared by convening compounds of the general formula (XV)<br><br><br>
in which<br><br>
20<br><br>
R3       is as defined above<br><br>
by reaction of the nitrile group into the corresponding amidines, which are then reacted with hydrazine and subsequently with compounds of the general formula (XII) and finally cyclized with POCI3 to give the corresponding compounds of the general formula (IX). 5<br>
The compounds of the general formula (XV) are known per se or can be prepared by customary methods.<br>
The compounds of the general  formula (I) according to the invention have an<br>
10	unforeseeable, useful spectrum of pharmacological action.<br>
They inhibit either one or more of the cGMP-metabolizing phosphodiesterases(PDE 1.<br>
PDEII and PDE V). This results in an increase of cGMP. The differentiated expression<br>
of the phosphodiesterases in different cells, tissues and organs and the differentiated<br>
15	subcellular localization of these enzymes allows, in combination with the selective<br>
inhibitors according to the invention, the different cGMP-regulated processes to be addressed selectively.<br>
The compounds according to the invention moreover intensify the action of substances.<br>
20	such as. for example. EDRF (endothelium-derived relaxing factor). ANP (atrial<br>
natriuretic peptide), of nitrovasodilators and other substances which increase the cGMP concentration by a mode different to that of phosphodiesterase inhibitors.<br>
Accordingly, the compounds of the general formula (I) according to the invention are<br>
25	suitable for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of disorders in which an increase of the<br>
cGMP concentration is beneficial, i.e. cGMP-related diseases. These include cardiovascular disorders, disorders of the urogenital system and cerebrovascular disorders.<br>
30	In the context of the present invention, the term "cardiovascular disorders" includes<br>
disorders such as. for example, hypertension, neuronal hypertonia, stable and unstable<br><br>
angina, peripheral and cardial vasculopathies, airhythmiae, thromboembolic disorders<br>
and ischemias such as myocardial infarction, stroke, transitory and ischemic attacks,<br>
angina pectoris, obstruction of peripheral circulation, prevention of restenoses after<br>
thrombolysis therapy, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), percutaneous<br>
5	transluminal coronary angioplasties (PTCA) and bypass.<br>
Furthermore, the compounds of the general formula (I) according to the invention may also be of importance for cerebrovascular disorders, cerebral ischemia, stroke, reperfusion damage, cerebral trauma, edema or cerebral thrombosis.<br>
10<br>
In addition, the present compounds are also suitable for improving perception, concentration power, learning power or memory power after cognitive disorders, such as occur, for example, in situations/illnesses/syndromes such as mild cognitive impairment, age-associated learning and memory disorders, age-associated memory<br>
15	loss, vascular dementia, craniocerebral trauma, stroke, dementia which occurs after<br>
strokes (post-stroke dementia), post-traumatic craniocerebral trauma, general concentration disorders, concentration disorders in children with learning and memory problems. Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, dementia with Lew}' bodies, dementia with degeneration of the frontal lobes including Pick's disease,<br>
20	Parkinson's   disease,   progressive   nuclear   palsy,   dementia   with   corticobasa]<br>
degeneration, amyolateral sclerosis (ALS). Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis, thalamic degeneration. Creutzfeld-Jacob dementia, HIV dementia, schizophrenia with dementia or Korsakoff psychosis.<br>
25	Owing to their relaxing action on smooth muscles, they are suitable for treating<br>
disorders of the urogenital system such as hypertrophy of the prostate, incontinence and in particular for the treatment of erectile dysfunction and female sexual dysfunction.<br>
Activity of the phosphodiesterases (PDEs)<br>
30	The cGMP-siimulable PDE ]1. the cGMP-inhibitable PDE 111 and the cAMP-specific<br>
PDE IV were isolated either from porcine or bovine heart myocardium. The Ca2"-<br><br>
calmodulin-stimulable PDE 1  was isolated  from porcine aorta, porcine brain or<br>
preferably from bovine aorta. The cGMP-specific PDE V was obtained from porcine<br>
small intestine, porcine aorta, human blood platelets and preferably from bovine aorta.<br>
Purification was earned  out by  anionic exchange chromatography on MonoQ<br>
5	Pharmacia essentially according to the method of M. Hoey and Miles D. Houslay.<br>
Biochemical Pharmacology, Vol. 40. 193-202 (1990) and C. Lugman et al. Biochemical Pharmacology Vol. 35 1743-1751 (1986).<br>
The enzyme activity was determined in a test batch of 100 u.1 in 20 mM tris/HCl buffer<br>
10	pH 7.5 which contains 5 mM MgCl;2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and either<br>
800 Bq of JHcAMP or JHcGMP. The final concentration of the corresponding nucleotides is 10'6 mol/1. The reaction is started by addition of the enzyme and the amount of enzyme is proportioned such that about 50% of the substrate is converted during the incubation time. To test cGMP-stimulate PDE II, JHcAMP is used as<br>
]5	substrate and 10'6 mol/1 unlabeled cGMP are added to the mixture. To test Ca2+-<br>
calmodulin-dependent PDE 1. 1 u.M of CaG? and 0.1 u.M of calmodulin are additionally added to the reaction mixture. The reaction is stopped by addition of 100 u.1 of acetonitrile which contains 1 mM of cAMP and 1 mM of AMP. 100 u.1 of the reaction mixture are separated by HPLC. and the products of the separation are<br>
20	determined on-line in a quantitative manner using a flow scintillation counter. What is<br>
measured is the substance concentration at which the reaction rate is reduced by 50%. Additionally, the "phosphodiesterase [3H] cAMP-SPA enzyme assay" and the "phosphodiesterase [JH] cGMP-SPA enzyme assay" from Amersham Life Science were used for testing. The test was carried out according to the test protocol of the<br>
25	manufacturer. To detemiine the activity of PDE II. the [JH] cAMP SPA assay was<br>
used, and 10'e M cGMP were added to the reaction mixture to activate the enzyme. To measure PDE L 10"'M calmodulin and ] u.M CaCb were added to the reaction mixture. PDE V was measured using the [JH] cGMP SPA assay.<br>
30	In principle, inhibition of one or more phosphodiesterases of this type results in an<br>
increase of the cGMP concentration. Thus, the compounds are of interest for all<br><br>
therapies in which an increase in the cGMP concentration is considered to be beneficial.<br>
The cardiovascular effects were investigated using normotensive and SH rats and dogs.<br>
5	The substances were administered intravenously or orally.<br>
The    study    for    erection-triggering    action    was    carried    out    using    awake<br>
rabbitsfH. Naganuma. T. Egashira, J. Fuji, Clinical and Experimental Pharmacology<br>
and Physiology 20, 177-183 (1993)]. The substances were administered orally or<br>
10	parenterally.<br>
The novel active compounds and their physiologically acceptable salts (for example hydrochlorides, maleates or lactates) can be convened in a known manner into the customary formulations, such as tablets, coated tablets, pills, granules, aerosols, syrups,<br>
15	emulsions, suspensions and solutions, using inert non-toxic, pharmaceutically suitable<br>
excipients or solvents. In this case, the therapeutically active compound should in each case be present in a concentration of from approximately 0.5 to 90% by weight of the total mixture, i.e. in amounts which are sufficient in order to achieve the dosage range indicated.<br>
20<br>
The formulations are prepared, for example, by extending the active compounds using solvents and/or excipients. if appropriate using emulsifiers and/or dispersants, it optionally being possible, for example, to use organic solvents as auxiliary solvents if the diluent used is water.<br>
25<br>
Administration is earned out in a customary manner, preferably orally, transdermally or parenterally, for example perlingually, buccally. intravenously, nasally, rectally or inhalatively.<br>
30	For human use. in the case of oral administration, doses of from 0.001 to 50 mg/kg.<br>
preferably 0.01 mg/kg - 20 mg/kg. are generally administered. In the case of parenteral<br><br>
administration, for example nasally, buccally or inhalatively via mucosa, it is good practice to use doses of 0.001 mg/kg - 0.5 mg/kg.<br>
In spite of this, if appropriate it may be necessary to depart from the amounts<br>
5	mentioned, namely depending on the body weight or the administration route, on the<br>
individual response toward the medicament, the manner of its fonnulation and the time<br>
or interval at which administration takes place. Thus, in some cases it may be adequate<br>
to manage with less than the abovementioned minimum amounts, while in other cases<br>
the upper limit mentioned has to be exceeded. In the case of the administration of<br>
10	relatively large amounts, it may be advisable to divide these into several individual<br>
doses over the course of the day.<br>
The compounds according to the invention are also suitable for use in veterinary<br>
medicine. For use in veterinary medicine, the compounds or their non-toxic salts can be<br>
] 5	administered in a suitable fonnulation in accordance with general veterinary practice.<br>
Depending on the kind of animal to be treated, the veterinary surgeon can determine the administration route and the dosage.<br>

The resulting oily residue is taken up in methanol, sodium bicarbonate is added and the mixture is boiled for 2.5 hours. After cooling, the mixture is filtered. The filtrate is added to a solution which was prepared as follows: 15 g of 3-allyloxy-6-ethoxybenzamidine hydrochloride (58.4 mmol) (example 38A) are initially charged in ethanol with ice-cooling. Over a period of lOmin, hydrazine hydrage (3.07 g. 61.3 mmol) is added dropwise. and the mixture is then stirred at room temperature for another 30 min. After 4 h at 70Â°C. the mixture is concentrated and the residue is taken up in 80 ml of 1.2-dichloroethane. mixed with 10 ml of phosphorus oxychloride and stirred under reflux for 1 h. The mixture is diluted with dichloromethane and neutralized usins<br><br>
sodium bicarbonate. The mixture is once more washed with water and then dried and<br>
concentrated using a rotary evaporator. The crude product is pre-purified by silica gel<br>
flash chromatography using cyclohexane/ethyl acetate 1:1. The resulting oily residue<br>
is crystallized using ether. Another crystallization from cyclohexane/ethyl acetate 1:1<br>
