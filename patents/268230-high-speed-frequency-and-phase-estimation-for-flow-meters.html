HIGH SPEED FREQUENCY AND PHASE ESTIMATION<br>
FOR FLOW METERS<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
1.	Field ofthe Invention<br>
The present invention relates to meter electronics and methods for processing one 01* more sensor signals in a flow meter.<br>
2.	Statement of the Problem<br>
It is known to use Coriolis mass flow meters to measure mass flow, density, and volume flow and other information of materials flowing through a pipeline as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,491,025 issued to IE. Smith, et al. of January 1,1985 and Re. 31,450 to J.E. Smith of February 11,1982. These flow meters have one or more flow tubes of different configurations. Each conduit configuration ma}' be viewed as having a set of natural vibration modes including, for example, simple bending, torsional, radial and coupled modes. In a typical Coriolis mass flow measurement application, a conduit configuration is excited in one or more vibration modes as a material flows through the conduit, and motion of the conduit is measured at points spaced along the conduit.<br>
The vibrational modes of the material filled systems are defined in part by the combined mass of the flow tubes and the material within the flow tubes. Material flows into the flow meter from a connected pipeline on the inlet side of the flow meter. The material is then directed through the flow tube or flow tubes and exits the flow meter to a pipeline connected on the outlet side.<br>
A driver applies a force to the flow tube. The force causes the flow tube to oscillate. When there is no material flowing through the flow meter, all points along a flow tube oscillate with an identical phase. As a material begins to flow through the flow tube, Coriolis accelerations cause each point along the flow tube to have a different phase with respect to other points along the flow tube. The phase on the inlet side of the flow tube lags the driver, while the phase on the outlet side leads the driver. Sensors are placed at different points on the flow tube to produce sinusoidal signals representative of the motion of the flow tube at the different points. The phase difference between the two sensor signals is proportional to the mass flow rate of the material flowing through the flow tube or flow tubes. In one prior art approach either a Discrete Fourier<br><br>
Transform (DFT) or a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is used to determine the phase difference between the sensor signals. The phase difference, and a vibrational frequency response of the flow tube assembly, are used to obtain the mass flow rate.<br>
In one prior art approach, an independent reference signal is used to determine a pickoff signal frequency, such as by using the frequency sent to the vibrational driver system. In another prior art approach, the vibrational response frequency generated by a pickoff sensor can be determined by centering to that frequency in a notch filter, wherein the prior art flowmeter attempts to keep the notch of the notch filter at the pickoff sensor frequency. This prior art technique works fairly well under quiescent conditions, where the flow material in the flowmeter is uniform and where the resulting pickoff signal frequency is relatively stable. However, the phase measurement of the prior art suffers when the flow material is not uniform, such as in two-phase flows where the flow material comprises a liquid and a solid or where there are air bubbles in the liquid flow material. In such situations, the prior art determined frequency can fluctuate rapidly. During conditions of fast and large frequency transitions, it is possible for the pickoff signals to move outside the filter bandwidth, yielding incorrect phase and frequency measurements. This also is a problem in empty-fiill-empty batching, where the flow meter is repeatedly operated in alternating empty and full conditions. .Also, if the frequency of the sensor moves rapidly, a demodulation process will not be able to keep up with the actual or measured frequency, causing demodulation at an incorrect frequency. It should be understood that if the determined frequency is incorrect or inaccurate, then subsequently derived values of density, volume flow rate, etc., will also be incorrect and inaccurate. Moreover, the error can be compounded in subsequent flow characteristic determinations.<br>
In the prior art, the pickoff signals can be digitized and digitally manipulated in order to implement the notch filter. The notch filter accepts only a narrow band of frequencies. Therefore, when the target frequency is changing* the notch filter may not be able to track the target signal for a period of time. Typically, the digital notch filter implementation takes 1-2 seconds to track to the fluctuating target signal. Due to the time required by the prior art to determine the frequency, the result is not only that the frequency and phase determinations contain errors, but also that the error measurement encompasses a time span that exceeds the time span during which the error and/or two-<br><br>
phase flow actually occur. This is due to the relative slowness of response of a notch filter implementation.<br>
The result is that the prior art flowmeter cannot accurately, quickly, or satisfactorily track or determine a pickoff sensor frequency during two-phase flow of the flow material in the flowmeter. Consequently, the phase determination is likewise slow and error prone, as the prior art derives the phase difference using the determined pickoff frequency. Therefore, any error in the frequency determination is compounded in the phase determination. The result is increased error in the frequency determination and in the phase determination, leading to increased error in determining the- mass flow rate. In addition, because the determined frequency value is used to determine a density value (density is approximately equal to one over frequency squared), an error in the frequency determination is repeated or compounded in the density determination. This is also true for a determination of volume flow rate, where the volume flow rate is equal to mass flow rate divided by density.<br>
A prior art meter electronics is given in U.S. Patent No. 5,578,764, to Yokoi et al. The Yokoi patent discloses a Hilbert transformer 21 and trigonometric function calculator 31 that receive upstream and downstream pickoff sensor signals and use both signals in order to calculate a phase difference between the signals. The Hilbert transformer 21 phase shifts both pickoff sensor signals by 90 degrees and both phase-shifted signals are used in the phase difference calculation. In Yokoi, the phase difference thus obtained is used to calculate a mass flow rate, along with an independently measured, outside frequency. The prior art of Yokoi therefore does not quickly and accurately derive the frequency component needed to calculate a highly accurate mass flow rate. In addition, Yokoi cannot quickly produce amass flow rate, as Yokoi must wait for the frequency determination. Summary of the Solution<br>
The above and other problems are solved and an advance in the art is achieved through the provision of meter electronics and methods for processing sensor signals in a flow meter.<br>

FIGS. 1-13 and the following description depict specific examples to teach those skilled in the art how to make and use the best mode of the invention. For the purpose of teaching inventive principles, some conventional aspects have been simplified or omitted. Those skilled in the art will appreciate variations from these examples that fail within the scope of the invention. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the features described below can be combined in various ways to form multiple variations of the invention. As a result, the invention is not limited to the specific examples described below, but only by the claims and their equivalents.<br>
FIG. 1 shows a Coriolis flow meter 5 comprising a meter assembly 10 and meter electronics 20. Meter assembly 10 responds to mass flow rate and density of a process material. Meter electronics 20 is connected to meter assembly 10 via leads 100 to provide density* mass flow rate, and temperature information over path 26, as well as other information not relevant to the present invention. A Coriolis flow meter structure is described although it is apparent to those skilled in the art that the present invention could be practiced as a vibrating tube densitometer without the additional measurement capability provided by a Coriolis mass flow meter.<br>
Meter assembly 10 includes apair of manifolds 150 and 150\ flanges 103 and 103'having flange necks 110 and 110', apair of parallel flow tubes 130 and 1301. drive mechanism 180, temperature sensor 190, and apair of velocity sensors 170L and 170R. Flowtubes 130 and 1301 have two essentially straight inlet legs 131 and 131' and outlet legs 134 and 134* which converge towards each other at flow tube mounting blocks 120 and 120'. Flowtubes 130 and 1301 bend at two symmetrical locations along their leugih and are essentially parallel throughout their length. Brace bars 140 and 140' serve to define the axis W and W about which each flow tube oscillates-<br><br>
The side legs 131,1ST and 134,134' of flow tubes 130 and 130' are fixedly attached to flow tube mounting blocks 120 and 1201 and these blocks, in turn, are fixedly attached to manifolds 150 and 150'. This provides a continuous closed material path through Coriolis meter assembly 10.<br>
When flanges 103 and 103% having holes 102 and 102' are connected, via inlet end 104 and outlet end 104! into a process line (not shown) which carries the process material that is being measured, material enters end 104 of the meter through an orifice 101 in flange 103 is conducted through manifold 150 to flow tube mounting block 120 having a surface 121. Within manifold 150 the material is divided and routed through flow tubes 130 and 130'. Upon exiting flow tubes 130 and 130\ the process material is recombined in a single stream within manifold 150' and is thereafter routed to exit end 104' connected by flange 1031 having bolt holes 102f to the process line (not shown).<br>
Flow tubes 130 and 130' are selected and appropriately mounted to the flow tube mounting blocks 120 and 120* so as to have substantially the same mass distribution, moments of inertia and Youngfs modulus about braiding axes W--W and W1—W\ respectively. These bending axes go through brace bars 140 and 140'. Inasmuch as the Young's modulus of the flow tubes change with temperature, and this change affects the calculation of flow and density, resistive temperature detector (RTD) 190 is mounted to flow tube 130', to continuously measure the temperature of the flow tube. The temperature of the flow tube and hence the voltage appearing across the RTD for a given current passing therethrough is governed by the temperature of the material passing through the flow tube. The temperature dependent voltage appearing across the RTD is used in a well known method by meter electronics 20 to compensate for the change in elastic modulus of flow tubes 130 and 130' due to any changes in flow tube temperature. The RTD is connected to meter electronics 20 by lead 195.<br>
Both flow tubes 130 and 130' are driven by driver 180 in opposite directions about their respective bending axes W and W1 and at what is termed the first out-of-phase bending mode of the flow meter. This drive mechanism 180 may comprise any one of many well known arrangements, such as a magnet mounted to flow tube 130' and an opposing coil mounted to flow tube 130 and through which an alternating current is passed for vibrating both flow tubes. A suitable drive signal is applied by meter electronics 20, via lead 185, to drive mechanism 180.<br><br>
Meter electronics 20 receives the RTD temperature signal on lead 195, and the left and right velocity signals appearing on leads 165L and 165R, respectively. Meter electronics 20 produces the drive signal appearing on lead 185 to drive element 1 SO and vibrate tubes 130 and 130'. Meter electronics 20 processes the left and right velocity signals and the RTD signal to compute the mass flow rate and the density of the material passing through meter assembly 10. This information, along with other information, is applied by meter electronics 20 over path 26 to utilization means 29.<br>
FIG. 2 shows meter electronics 20 according to an embodiment of the invention. The meter electronics 20 can include an interface 201 and a processing system 2G3. The meter electronics 20 receives first and second sensor signals from the meter assembly 10, such as pickofEVelocity sensor signals. The meter electronics 20 can operate as a mass flow meter or can operate as a densitometer, including operating as a Coriolis flow meter. The meter electronics 20 processes the first and second sensor signals in order to obtain flow characteristics of the flow material flowing through the meter assembly 10. For example, the meter electronics 20 can determine one or more of a phase difference, a frequency, a time difference (At), a density, a mass flow rate, and a volume flow rate from the sensor signals, for example. In addition, other flow characteristics can be determined according to the invention. The determinations are discussed below.<br>
The phase difference determination and the frequency determination are much faster and more accurate and reliable than such determinations in the prior art. In one embodiment, the phase difference determination and the frequency determination are directly derived from a phase shift of only one sensor signal, without the need for any frequency reference signal. This advantageously reduces the processing time required in order to compute the flow characteristics. In another embodiment, the phase difference is derived from phase shifts of both sensor signals, while the frequency is derived from only one phase shift signal. This increases the accuracy of both flow characteristics, and both can be determined much faster than in the prior art.<br>
The prior art frequency determination methods typically take 1-2 seconds to perform. In contrast, the frequency detennination according to the invention can be performed in as little as 50 milliseconds (ms). Even faster frequency determination is contemplated, depending on the type and configuration of the processing system, the sampling rate of the vibrational response, the filter sizes, the decimation rates, etc. At<br><br>
the 50 ms frequency determination rate, the meter electronics 20 according to the invention can be about 40 times faster than the prior art.<br>
The interface 201 receives the sensor signal from one of the velocity sensors 170L and 170Rvia the leads 100 of FIG. 1. The interface 201 can perform any necessary or desired signal conditioning, such as any manner of formatting, amplification, buffering, etc. Alternatively, some or all of the signal conditioning can be performed in the processing system 203.<br>
In addition, the interface 201 can enable communications between the meter electronics 20 and external devices. The interface 201 can be capable of any manner of electronic, optical, or wireless communication.<br>
The interface 201 in one embodiment is coupled with a digitizer 202, wherein the sensor signal comprises an analog sensor signal. The digitizer 202 samples and digitizes the analog sensor signal and produces a digital sensor signal. The digitizer 202 can also perform any needed decimation, wherein the digital sensor signal is decimated in order to reduce the amount of signal processing needed and to reduce the processing time. The decimation will be discussed in more detail below.<br>
The processing system 203 conducts operations of the meter electronics 20 aad processes flow measurements from the flow meter assembly 10. The processing system 203 executes one or more processing routines, and thereby processes the flow measurements in order to produce one or more flow characteristics.<br>
The processing system 203 can comprise a general purpose computer, a microprocessing system, a logic circuit, or some other general purpose or customized processing device. The processing system 203 can be distributed among multiple processing devices. The processing system 203 can include any manner of integral or independent electronic storage medium, such as the storage system 204.<br>
The processing system 203 processes the sensor signal 210 in order to determine one or more flow characteristics from the sensor signal 210. The one or more flow characteristics can include a phase difference, a frequency, a time difference (At), a mass flow rate, and/or a density for the flow material, for example.<br>
In the embodiment shown, the processing system 203 determines the flow characteristics from the two sensor signals 210 and 211 and the single sensor signal phase shift 213. The processing system 203 can determine at least the phase difference<br><br>
and the frequency from the two sensor signals 210 and 211 and the single phase shift 213. As a result, either a first or second phase shifted sensor signal (such as one of the upstream or downstream pickoff signals) can be processed by the processing system 203 according to the invention in order to determine a phase difference, a frequency, a time difference (At), and/or a mass flow rate for the flow material.<br>
The storage system 204 can store flow meter parameters and data, software routines, constant values, and variable values. In one embodiment, the storage system 204 includes routines that are executed by the processing system 203. In one embodiment, the storage system 204 stores a phase shift routine 212, a phase difference routine 215, a frequency routine 216, a time difference (At) routine 217, and a flow characteristics routine 218.<br>
In one embodiment, the storage system 204 stores variables used to operate a flow meter, such as the Coriolis flow meter 5. The storage system 204 in one embodiment stores variables such as the first sensor signal 210 and the second sensor signal 211, which are received from the velocity/pickoff sensors 170L and 17QR. In addition, the storage system 204 can store a 90 degree phase shift 213 that is generated in order to determine the flow characteristics.<br>
In one embodiment, the storage system 204 stores one or more flow characteristics obtained from the flow measurements. The storage system 204 in one embodiment stores flow characteristics such as a phase difference 220, a frequency 221, a time difference (At) 222, a mass flow rate 223, a density 224, and a volume flow rate 225, all determined from the sensor signal 210.<br>
The phase shift routine 212 performs a 90 degree phase shift on an input signal, Le.y on the sensor signal 210. The phase shift routine 212 in one embodiment implements a Hilbert transform (discussed below).<br>
The phase difference routine 215 determines a phase difference using the single 90 degree phase shift 213. Additional information can also be used in order to compute the phase difference. The phase difference in one embodiment is computed from the first sensor signal 210, the second sensor signal 211, and the 90 degree phase shift 213. The determined phase difference can be stored in the phase difference 220 of the storage system 204. The phase difference, when determined from the 90 phase shift 213, cai be calculated and obtained much faster than in the prior art. This can provide a critical<br><br>
difference in flow meter applications having high flow rates or where multi-phase flows occur. In addition, the phase difference can be determined independent of the frequency of either sensor signal 210 or 211. Moreover, because the phase difference is determined independently of the frequency, an error component in the phase difference does not include an error component of the frequency determination, i.e.* there is no compounding error in the phase difference measurement Consequently, the phase difference error is reduced over a phase difference of the prior art.<br>
The frequency routine 216 determines a frequency (such as that exhibited by either the first sensor signal 210 or the second sensor signal 211) from the 90 degree phase shift 213. The determined frequency can be stored in the frequency 221 of the storage system 204. The frequency, when determined from the single 90 phase shift 213, can be calculated and obtained much faster than in the prior art. This can provide, a critical difference in flow meter applications having high flow rates or where multiphase flows occur.<br>
The time difference (At) routine 217 determines a time difference (At) between the first sensor signal 210 and the second sensor signal 211. The time difference (At) can be stored in the time difference (At) 222 of the storage system 204. The time difference (At) comprises substantially the determined phase divided by the determined frequency, and is therefore used to determine the mass flow rate.<br>
The flow characteristics routine 218 can determine one or more flow characteristics. The flow characteristics routine 218 can use the determined phase difference 220 and the determined frequency 221, for example, in order to accomplish these additional flow characteristics. It should be understood that additional information may be required for these determinations, such as the mass flow rate or density, for example. The flow characteristics routine 218 can determine a mass flow rate from the time difference (At) 222, and therefore from the phase difference 220 and the frequency 221. The formula for determining mass flow Tate is given in U.S. Patent No. 5,027,662 to Titlow et ah, and is incorporated herein by reference. The mass flow rate is related to the mass flow of flow material in the meter assembly 10. Likewise, the flow characteristics routine 218 can also determine the density 224 and/or the volume flow rate 225. The determined mass flow rate, density, and volume flow rate can be stored in the mass flow rate 223, the density 224, and the volume 225 of the storage system 204,<br><br>
respectively. In addition, the flow characteristics can be transmitted to external devices by the meter electronics 20.<br>
FIG. 3 is a flowchart 300 of a method of processing sensor signals in a flow meter according to an embodiment of the invention. In step 301, the first and second sensor signals are received. The first sensor signal can comprise either an upstream or downstream pickoff sensor signal.<br>
In step 302, the sensor signals can be conditioned. In one embodiment, the conditioning can include filtering to remove noise and unwanted signals. In one embodiment, the filtering can comprise band-pass filtering centered around the expected fundamental frequency of the flow meter. In addition, other conditioning operations can-be performed, such as amplification, buffering, etc. If the sensor signals comprise analog signals, the step can further comprise any manner of sampling, digitisation, and decimation that are performed in order to produce digital sensor signals.<br>
In step 303, a single 90 degree phase shift is generated. The 90 degree phase shift comprises a 90 degree phase shift of the sensor signal. The 90 degree phase shift can be performed by any manner of phase shift mechanism or operation. In one embodiment, the 90 degree phase shift is performed using aHilbert transform, operating on digital sensor signals.<br>
In step 304, a phase difference is computed, using the single 90 degree phase shift. Additional information can also be used in order to compute the phase difference. In one embodiment, the phase difference is determined from the first sensor signal, the second sensor signal, and the single 90 degree phase shift. The phase difference comprises a phase difference in the response signal, i.e., in a pickoff sensor, that is seen due to the Coriolis effect in the vibrating meter assembly 10.<br>
The resulting phase difference is determined without the need for any frequency value in the calculation. The resulting phase difference can be obtained much faster than a phase difference calculated using a frequency. The resulting phase difference has a greater accuracy than a phase difference calculated using a frequency.<br>
In step 305, a frequency is computed. The frequency according to the invention is advantageously computed from the 90 degree phase shift The frequency in one embodiment uses the 90 degree phase shift and the corresponding sensor signal from which the 90 degree phase shift is derived. The frequency is a vibrational response<br><br>
frequency of one of the first sensor signal and the second sensor signal (the frequencies of the two sensor signals are substantially identical in operation). The frequency comprises a vibrational frequency response of the flowtube or flowtubes to a vibration generated by the driver 180.<br>
The frequency thus derived is obtained without the need for any independent frequency reference signal. The frequency is obtained from the single 90 degree phase shift in an operation that is much faster than in the prior art. The resulting frequency has a greater accuracy than a frequency calculated in the prior art.<br>
In step 306, a mass flow rate of flow material is computed. The mass flow rate is computed from the resulting phase difference and the resulting frequency computed in steps 304 and 305. In addition, the mass flow rate computation can compute a time difference (At) from the phase difference and the frequency, with the time difference (At) being ultimately used to compute the mass flow rate.<br>
In step 307, the density can optionally be determined. The density can be determined as one of the flow characteristics, and can be determined from the frequency, for example.<br>
In step 308, the volume flow rate can optionally be determined. The volume flow rate can be determined as one of the flow characteristics, and can be determined from the mass flow rate and the density, for example.<br>
FIG. 4 shows the meter electronics 20 according to an embodiment of the invention. The elements in common with FIG, 2 share the same reference numbers.<br>
The meter electronics 20 in this embodiment includes the first sensor signal 210 and the second sensor signal 211. The processing system 203 processes the first and second (digital) sensor signals 210 and 211 in order to determine one or more flow characteristics from the signals. As previously discussed, the one or more flow characteristics can include a phase difference, a frequency, a time difference (At), a mass flow rate, a density, and/or a volume flow rate for the flow material.<br>
In the embodiment shown, the processing system 203 determines the flow characteristics from only the two sensor signals 210 and 211, without the need for any external frequency measurement and without the need for an external frequency reference signal. The processing system 203 can determine at least the phase difference and the freauencv from the two sensor signals 210 and 211.<br><br>
As was previously discussed, the storage system 204 stores a phase shift routine 212, a phase difference routine 215, a frequency routine 216, a time difference (At) routine 217, and a flow characteristics routine 218. The storage system 204 stores the first sensor signal 210 and the second sensor signal 211. The storage system 204 also stores a first 90 degree phase shift 213 and a second 90 degree phase shift that are generated from the sensor signals in order to determine the flow characteristics. As was previously discussed, the storage system 204 stores the phase difference 220, the frequency 221, the time difference (At) 222, the mass flow rate 223, the density 224, and the volume flow rate 225.<br>
The phase shift routine 212 performs a 90 degree phase shift on an input signal. including on the first sensor signal 210 and on the second sensor signal 211. The phase shift routine 212 in one embodiment implements a Hilbert transform (discussed below).<br>
The phase difference routine 215 determines a phase difference using the first 90 degree phase shift 213 and the second 90 degree phase shift 214. Additional information can also be used in order to compute the phase difference. The phase difference in one embodiment is computed from the first sensor signal 210, the second sensor signal 211, the first 90 degree phase shift 212, and the second 90 degree phase shift 213. The determined phase difference can be stored in the phase difference 220 of the storage system 204, as previously discussed. The phase difference, when determined using the first and second 90 phase shifts, can be calculated and obtained much faster than in the prior art. This can provide a critical difference in flow meter applications having high flow rates or where multi-phase flows occur. In addition, tine phase difference can be determined independent of the frequency of the sensor signals 210 and 211. Moreover, because the phase difference is determined independently of the frequency, an error component in the phase difference does not suffer from an error component of the frequency determination, £e., there is no compounding error in the phase difference measurement Consequently, the phase difference error is reduced over a phase difference of the prior art.<br>
The frequency routine 216 determines a frequency (such as that exhibited by either the first sensor signal 210 or the second sensor signal 211) from the first 90 degree phase shift 213 and the second 90 degree phase shift 214. The determined frequency can be stored in the frequency 221 of the'storage system 204, as previously<br><br>
discussed. The frequency, when determined from the first and second 90 phase shifts, can be calculated and obtained much faster than in the prior art This can provide a critical difference in flow meter applications having high flow rates or where multiphase flows occur.<br>
The time difference (At) routine 217 determines a time difference (At) between the first sensor signal 210 and the second sensor signal 211. The time difference (At) can be stored in the time difference (At) 222 of the storage S3rstem 204 ? as previously discussed. The time difference (At) comprises substantially the determined phase divided by the determined frequency, and is therefore used to determine the mass flow rate.<br>
The flow characteristics routine 218 can determine one or more of the mass flow rate, the density, and/or the volume flow rate, as previously discussed.<br>
FIG. 5 is a flowchart 500 of a method of processing first and second sensor signals in a flow meter according to an embodiment of the invention. In step 501, the first sensor signal is received. In one embodiment, the first sensor signal comprises either an upstream or downstream pickoff sensor signal.<br>
In step 502, the second sensor signal is received. In one embodiment, the second sensor signal comprises either a downstream or upstream pickoff sensor signal (i.e., the opposite of the first sensor signal).<br>
In step 503, the sensor signals can be conditioned. In one embodiment^ the conditioning can include filtering to remove noise and unwanted signals. In one embodiment, the filtering can comprise, band-pass filtering, as previously discussed. In addition, other conditioning operations can be performed, such as amplification, buffering, etc. If the sensor signals comprise analog signals, the step can further comprise any manner of sampling, digitization, and decimation that are performed in order to produce digital sensor signals.<br>
In step 504, a first 90 degree phase shift is generated. The first 90 degree phase shift comprises a 90 degree phase shift of the first sensor signal. The 90 degree phase shift can be performed by any manner of mechanism or operation. In one embodiment, the 90 degree phase shift is performed using a Hilbert transform, operating on digital sensor signals.<br><br>
In step 505, a second 90 degree phase shift is generated. The second 90 degree phase shift comprises a 90 degree phase shift of the second sensor signal. As in the first 90 degree phase shift, the 90 degree phase shift can be performed by any manner of mechanism or operation.<br>
In step 506, a phase difference is computed between the first sensor signal and the second sensor signal, using the first 90 degree phase shift and the second 90 degree phase shift. Additional information can also be used in order to compute the phase difference. In one embodiment, the phase difference is determined from the first sensor signal, the second sensor signal, the first 90 degree phase shift, and the second 90 degree phase shift. The phase difference comprises a phase difference in the response signal, z.e., in the two pickoff sensors, that is seen due to the Coriolis effect in the vibrating meter assembly 10,<br>
The resulting phase difference is determined without the need for any frequency value in the calculation. The resulting phase difference can be obtained much faster than a phase difference calculated using a frequency. The resulting phase difference has a greater accuracy than a phase difference calculated using a frequency.<br>
In step 507, a frequency is computed. The frequency according to the invention is advantageously computed from the first 90 degree phase shift and the second 90 degree phase shift. The frequency in one embodiment uses the 90 degree phase shift and the corresponding sensor signal from winch the 90 degree phase shift is derived. The frequency is a vibrational response frequency of one of the first sensor signal and the second sensor signal (the frequencies of the two sensor signals are substantially identical in operation). The frequency comprises a vibrational frequency response of the flbwtube or flowtubes to a vibration generated by the driver 180.<br>
The frequency thus derived is obtained without the need for any independent frequency reference'signal. The frequency is obtained from the 90 degree phase shifts in an operation that is much faster than in the prior art. The resulting frequency has a greater accuracy than a frequency calculated in the prior art.<br>
In step 508, a mass flow rate of flow material is computed. The mass flow rate is computed from the resulting phase difference and the resulting frequency computed in steps 506 and 507. In addition, the mass flow rate computation can compute a time<br><br>
difference (At) from the phase difference and the frequency, with the time difference (At) being ultimately used to compute the mass flow rate.<br>
In step 509, the density can optionally be determined., as previously discussed.<br>
In step 510, the volume flow rate can optionally be determined, as previously discussed.<br>
FIG. 6 is a block diagram 600 of a portion of the processing system 203 according to an embodiment of the invention. In the figure, the blocks represent either processing circuitry or processing actions/routines. The block diagram 600 includes a stage 1 filter block 6015 a stage 2 filter block 602, a Hilbert transform block 603, and an analysis block 604. The LPO and RPO inputs comprise the left pickoff signal input and the right pickoff signal input. Either the LPO or the RPO can comprise a first sensor signal.<br>
In one embodiment, the stage 1 filter block 601 and the stage 2 filter block 602 comprise digital Finite Impulse Response (FIR) polyphase decimation filters, implemented in the processing system 203. These filters provide an optimal method for filtering and decimating one or both sensor signals, with the filtering and decimating being performed at the same chronological time and at the same decimation rate. Alternatively, the stage 1 filter block 601 and the stage 2 filter block 602 can comprise Infinite Impulse Response (ER) filters or other suitable digital filters or filter processes. However, it should be understood that other filtering processes and/or filtering embodiments are contemplated and are within the scope of the description and claims.<br>
FIG. 7 shows detail of the Hilbert transform block 603 according to an embodiment of the invention. In the embodiment shown, the Hilbert transform block 603 includes a LPO branch 700 and a RPO branch 710. The LPO branch 700 includes a LPO delay block 701 in parallel with a LPO filter block 702. Likewise, the RPO branch includes an RPO delay block 711 in parallel with an RPO filter block 712. The LPO delay block 701 and the RPO delay block 711 introduce sampling delays. The LPO delay block 701 and the RPO delay block 711 therefore select LPO and RPO digital signal samples that are chronologically later in time that the LPO and RPO digital signal samples that are filtered by the LPO filter block 702 and the RPO filter block 712. The LPO filter block 702 and the RPO filter block 712 perform a 90 degree phase shift on the inputted digital signal samples.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
As previously discussed, the join block 901 receives both in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components of a sensor signal and passes them on. The conjugate block 902 performs a complex conjugate on a sensor signal, here the LPO signals and forms a negative of the imaginary signal. The delay block 903 introduces a sampling delay into the frequency portion 604b, and therefore selects a digital signal sample that is chronologically older in time. This older digital signal sample is multiplied with the current digital signal in the complex multiplication block 904. The complex multiplication block 904 multiplies the LPO signal and the LPO conjugate signal, implementing equation (12) below. The filter block 905 implements a digital filter, such as the FIR filter previously discussed The filter block 905 can comprise a polyphase decimation filter that is used to remove harmonic content from the in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components of the sensor signal, as well as to decimate the signal. The filter coefficients can be chosen to provide decimation of the inputted signal, such as decimation by a factor of 10, for example. The phase angle block 906 determines a phase angle from the in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components of the LPO signal. The phase angle block 906 implements a portion of equation (13) below. The constant block 907 supplies a factor comprising a sample rate Fs divided by two pi; as shown in equation (14). The division block 908 performs the division operation of equation (14).<br>
The frequency portion 604b implements the following equation:<br><br><br>
FIG. 10 is a power spectrum density plot of a pick-off sensor signal of a flow meter under normal conditions. The fundamental frequency of the flowmeter is the tallest spike of the graph and is located at about 135 Hz. The figure also shows several other large spikes in the frequency spectrum (the first non-fundamental mode is the twist mode at a frequency of about 1.5 times the frequency of the fundamental mode). These spikes comprise harmonic frequencies of the flowmeter and also comprise other, undesirable sensor modes (z.eM a twist mode, a second bend mode, etc.).<br>
FIG. 11 shows an alternative Hilbert transform block 603' according to a single phase shift embodiment. The Hilbert transform block 603' in this embodiment includes a LPO branch 1100 and a RPO branch 1110. The LPO branch 1100 includes a delay block 701 in parallel with a filter block 702. The RPO branch 1110 in this embodiment includes only a delay block 701. As before, the delay blocks 701 introduce sampling delays. As before, the filter block 702 performs a 90 degree phase shift on the inputted digital signal sample. It should be understood that alternatively the Hilbert transform block 6035 could phase shift: just the RPO signal.<br>
This processing embodiment uses the Hilbert transform/phase shift of only one sensor signal in order to derive both the frequenc}' and the phase difference (see FIGS. 2-3). This significantly reduces the number of computations needed to perform a phase measurement and significantly reduces the number of computations needed to obtain the mass flow rate.<br>
In this embodiment, the output of the Hilbert transform block 603! will provide the quadrature (Q) component of either the left or right sensor signal, but not both. In the example below, the LPO signal is phase shifted.<br>
Using <br><br><br><br>
By taking the Hilbert transform of one pick-off signal instead of two, the computational load needed to perform phase and frequency estimation in Coriolis mass flow meters is advantageously reduced. The phase and frequency can therefore be determined using two sensor signals, but using only one 90 degree phase shift.<br>
FIG. 13 shows the sensor processing of the invention as compared to the prior art, wherein a time difference (At) value of each is compared. The chart shows a flow material including a gas flow (i.e., gas bubbles, for example). Under this condition, the flow noise is substantially reduced in the new algorithm because of the rate of phase and frequency calculation. It can be seen from the graph that the result derived by the invention does not display the large peaks and valleys that are reflected in prior art (At) measurements.<br>
The invention differs from the prior art. First, the prior art typically determines a pickoff frequency using a pickoff signal and an independent frequency source, such as a driver signal sent to a driver system in order to determine the vibrational response frequency. In contrast, the invention determines frequency by shifting the phase of one of the two sensor signals. The prior art does not determine the vibrational response frequency from a phase shift of a sensor signal.<br>
Second, most prior art flowmeters determine a phase difference between pickoff signals using the prior art frequency determination. As a consequence, any error included in the prior art frequency determination is included in the prior art phase difference determination, compounding the overall error in the prior art mass flow rate determination. In contrast, the invention determines the phase difference directly from one or two phase-shifted sensor signals, without using any frequency determination. As a result, any error term is the result of only the phase manipulation and phase measurement of the phase difference determination, and is not affected by any frequency determination error.<br>
Third, the prior art determines the mass flow rate using the independently determined outside frequency. Typically, the prior art also uses a phase difference that has been obtained using the independently determined outside frequency. Consequently, in the prior art, the mass flow rate can be twice affected by any error in the frequency determination, and therefore is not satisfactorily accurate and reliable. In contrast, in the invention the frequency determination and the phase difference determination are independently derived. The frequency determination and the phase<br><br>
difference determination in the invention therefore include a much smaller error component As a result, using the meter electronics and the method of the invention, the amount of error in the mass flow rate determination is greatly reduced. Consequently, density and volume flow rates according to the invention are also improved in accuracy and reliability.<br>
Fourth, the frequency determination of the prior art takes a relatively long time. In situations where the flow material comprises a two-phase or three-phase flow, such as a liquid including entrained solids and/or entrained gases (such as air bubbles), the prior art frequency determination can take as much as 1-2 seconds to provide a stable and relatively accurate frequency measurement In contrast, the frequency and phase difference determinations according to the invention can be obtained much faster, such as on the order of milliseconds or hundreds of milliseconds. All flow characteristics derived from the frequency and the phase difference can also be obtained in much less time.<br>
The meter electronics and method for processing sensor signals according the invention can be implemented according to any of the embodiments in order to obtain several advantages, if desired. The invention can compute a phase difference from two phase-shifted sensor signals. The invention can provide a phase difference determination of greater accuracy and reliability. The invention can provide a phase difference determination faster than the prior art and while consuming less processing time.<br>
The invention can compute a frequency from just one phase-shifted sensor signal. The invention can provide a frequency determination of greater accuracy and reliability. The invention can provide a frequency determination faster than the prior art and while consuming less processing time.<br>
The invention can compute a mass flow rate, a density, and/or a volume flow rate, among other things, from just one or two sensor signals. The invention can provide a mass flow rate determination of greater accuracy and reliability. The invention can provide a mass flow rate determination faster than the prior art and while consuming less processing time. The invention therefore provides substantially better performance for entrained air conditions, empty-full-empty conditions, gas applications, and steady state conditions.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
