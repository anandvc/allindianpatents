Description<br>
Nickel-based brazing alloy and method for brazing<br>
[1]	The invention relates to a nickel-based brazing alloy and to a method for brazing two<br>
or more components.<br>
[2]	Soldering is a method for joining metal or ceramic components with the aid of a<br>
molten filler material identified as solder. Depending on the processing temperature of<br>
the solder, a distinction is made between soft soldering and brazing, the processing<br>
temperature typically exceeding the liquidus temperature of the solder by 10 ° C to 50<br>
° C. While soft solders are processed at temperatures below 450 ° C, brazing alloys are<br>
processed at temperatures above 450 ° C. Brazing alloys are used in application where<br>
a high mechanical strength of the joint and/or a high mechanical strength at elevated<br>
operating temperatures are/is required.<br>
[3]	Components made of stainless steel or of Ni and Co alloys are often joined by means<br>
of Ni-based brazing alloys. The corrosion resistance of the joints produced by means of<br>
the brazing alloy is a critical criterion in many applications, in particular in stainDless<br>
steel heat exchangers and similar products. In order to increase the application tem-<br>
perature range and to improve corrosion resistance, EP 0108 959, for example,<br>
discloses a nickel-based brazing alloy with a chromium content of 17 to 20 atomic %.<br>
[4]	This increased chromium content, however, has the disadvantage of increasing the<br>
liquidus temperature and thus the processing temperature. This results in undesirable<br>
coarse grain formation in the parent material and in a reduction of its mechanical<br>
strength, which is likewise undesirable in many applications. In addition, an increased<br>
chromium content of the brazing alloy can result in Cr-B and Cr-Si brittle phases in the<br>
brazed seam or in the parent material, which adversely affects the mechanical strength<br>
of the joint.<br>
[5]	To reduce the chromium content and to solve these problems, WO 96/37335, for<br>
example, discloses a nickel-based brazing alloy with a molybdenum content up to 5<br>
atomic % and a reduced chromium content between 9.5 and 16.5 atomic %.<br>
[6],	From US 5,183,636 an iron-free brazing alloy is known, which comprises<br>
components preventing the diffusion of iron from the parent material into the brazing<br>
alloy and components which improve corrosion resistance. For this purpose, the iron-<br>
free brazing alloy contains copper, molybdenum, niobium and tantalum. This com-<br>
position is claimed to improve corrosion resistance, as the chromium content is<br>
maintained by the addition of niobium and tantalum and the brazed seam remains iron-<br>
free.<br>
[7]	A disadvantage of these brazing alloys, however, lies in the fact that the corrosion<br>
resistance of the brazed joint is inadequate in aggressive media such as acidic media.<br><br>
In addition, the brazing alloy known from US 5,183,636 is very expensive owing to its<br>
components.<br>
[8]	An object of the invention is to provide a nickel-based brazing alloy with improved<br>
corrosion resistance, which is also cost-effective.<br>
[9]	According to the invention, a brazing alloy of a composition consisting essentially of<br>
[10]	FegNRestCrbMocCu dSieBfPg<br>
[11]	wherein 0 atomic % 
atomic % 
atomic %; 0 atomic % 
[12]	wherein if 0 atomic % 
[13]	and if a=0, then 0.5 atomic % 
[14]	Two alternative compositions are, therefore, provided. In the first embodiment, the<br>
brazing alloy comprises iron and a copper content in the range 0.5 atomic % 
atomic %. In the second embodiment, the brazing alloy is iron free. In this em-<br>
bodiment, a slightly higher copper content may be provided so that the copper content<br>
may in the range 0.5 atomic % 
range for the iron-free brazing alloy is .0.5 atomic % 
containing first embodiment.<br>
[15]	By the term 'consisting essentially of, it is to be understood that the brazing alloy<br>
may contain trace amounts of unavoidable impurities. Typical impurities may be the<br>
elements Al, S, Se, Ti and Zr. The total amount of impurities should be less than 2000<br>
ppm, preferably less than 1000 ppm.<br>
[ 16]	The brazing alloy of the invention includes both molybdenum and copper in amounts<br>
such that the corrosion resistance is improved over compositions including only one of<br>
molybdenum and copper. Surprisingly, it was found that this brazing alloy has a good<br>
corrosion resistance without any expensive additions of tantalum and niobium.<br>
[17]	This good corrosion resistance is furthermore retained even at an iron content up to<br>
50 atomic %. This further reduces raw material costs, since nickel is partially replaced<br>
by iron which is cheaper than nickel. These compositions are particularly suitable for<br>
applications where the cost of the material is an important factor.<br>
[18]	In a further embodiment, the brazing alloy preferably combines an addition of 0.2 to<br>
1.5 atomic % of molybdenum with an addition of 0.5 to 3 atomic % of copper to<br>
improve corrosion resistance.<br>
[19]	The brazing alloy according to the invention has been found suitable for application<br>
in highly aggressive media, such as heat exchangers for internal combustion engines<br>
and exhaust gas recirculation coolers. In these applications, the brazed joint is exposed<br>
to reductive or oxidising acidic media, which may further include sulphate and/or<br>
nitrate and/or chloride ions. Brazed seams produced using the brazing alloy according<br><br>
to the invention also exhibit a good corrosion resistance in these aggressive media.<br>
Further applications for the brazing alloy according to the invention include the joining<br>
of two or more components of industrial-type stainless steel heat exchangers and of<br>
heat exchangers in cars and commercial vehicles, where aggressive media are<br>
generated.<br>
[20]	The good corrosion resistance of the brazing solder according to the invention is<br>
achieved with a moderate chromium content of 5 to 18 atomic %, whereby the disad-<br>
vantages of high-chromium alloys are avoided. In contrast to a composition with an<br>
increased chromium content, the combined addition of Mo and Cu does not result in an<br>
undesirable increase in liquidus temperature and thus in the processing temperature of<br>
the brazing alloy. This chromium content ensures that the strong formation of Cr-B and<br>
Cr-Si brittle phases is avoided both in the brazed seam and in the parent material. A<br>
good corrosion resistance is provided by the addition of Mo and Cu in spite of the low<br>
chromium content.<br>
[21]	The brazing alloy according to the invention has a liquidus temperature of less than<br>
1200 ° C. This is desirable, because the maximum brazing temperature for many in-<br>
dustrial processes, in particular for joining stainless steel parent materials, is limited to<br>
approximately 1200 ° C. As a rule, brazing temperature is kept as low as possible<br>
because of undesirable coarse grain formation in the parent material at temperatures<br>
from 1000 ° C. This undesirable coarse grain formation results in a reduction of the<br>
mechanical strength of the parent material, which is critical for many technological ap-<br>
plications such as heat exchangers. This problem is significantly reduced by the<br>
brazing alloy according to the invention.<br>
[22]	The brazing alloy is therefore reliable in industrial applications with a maximum<br>
soldering temperature limited to 1200 ° C. It provides for a reliable brazed joint.<br>
[23]	In further embodiments, the brazing colder has an Si content of 7 
% and/or a B content of 5 
atomic %.<br>
[24]	The elements boron, silicon and phosphorus are metalloid and glass-forming<br>
elements and permit the production of the brazing alloy as an amorphous, ductile foil.<br>
A higher content of these elements leads to a reduction of melting or liquidus tem-<br>
perature. If the content of glass-forming elements is too low, the foils solidify in a<br>
crystalline manner and become very brittle. If, on the other hand, the content of glass-<br>
forming elements is too high, the foils become brittle and can no longer be processed<br>
for technological applications.<br>
[25]	The metalloid content is further chosen such that the brazed seam produced using a<br>
foil of brazing alloy has suitable mechanical properties. A high B content results in the<br>
separation of B hard phases, leading to a deterioration of the mechanical properties of<br><br>
the brazed joint. Boron reacts with chromium, likewise resulting in a noticeable<br>
reduction of corrosion resistance. A high Si content results in the formation of un-<br>
desirable Si hard phases in the brazed seam, which likewise reduces the strength of the<br>
soldered seam.<br>
[26]	The brazing alloy according to any of the embodiments described above can be<br>
provided as a paste or as an amorphous, ductile brazing alloy foil. The brazing alloy<br>
according to the invention can be produced as a powder or as an amorphous, ductile<br>
foil, for example in a rapid solidification process. These brazing alloys are therefore<br>
available in various forms which can be adapted to different applications.<br>
[27]	In one embodiment, the brazing alloy foil is up to 50%, preferably at least up to 80%,<br>
amorphous.<br>
[28]	The brazing alloy foils according to the invention can be produced as ductile foils in<br>
increased strip thicknesses and increased strip widths. The brazing alloys according to<br>
the invention are therefore excellently suitable for casting with thicknesses of more<br>
than 20 urn, preferably of 20 µm 
mm, preferably 20 mm 
degree with nickel-based brazing alloys of prior art.<br>
[29]	In one embodiment, a heat exchanger is provided with at least one brazed seam<br>
produced with a brazing alloy of a composition consisting essentially of<br>
[30]	FegNRestCrbMocCu dSieBfPg,<br>
[31]	wherein 0 atomic % 
atomic % 
atomic %; 0 atomic % 
[32]	wherein if 0 atomic % 
[33]	and if a=0, then 0.5 atomic % 
[34]	In another embodiment, this brazed seam is produced using a brazing alloy of this<br>
composition in the form of an amorphous, ductile brazing alloy foil. The heat<br>
exchanger may have at least one brazed seam produced with a brazing alloy or an<br>
amorphous, ductile brazing alloy foil according to any of the embodiments described<br>
above. The brazed seam produced with an amorphous, ductile brazing alloy foil has a<br>
thickness of at least 20µm.<br>
[35]	The brazed seam produced with an amorphous, ductile brazing alloy foil differs from<br>
a brazed seam produced by means of a crystalline powder in the size of the B and Si<br>
hard phases.<br>
[36]	A method for joining two or more components, which comprises the following steps,<br>
is provided. A brazing alloy according to any of the embodiDments described above is<br>
applied between two or more of the metal components to be joined. The components to<br>
be joined have a higher melting temperature than the brazing alloy and may be made of<br><br>
stainless steel or an Ni or Co alloy. The brazing composite is heated to a temperature<br>
above the liquidus temperature of the brazing alloy and then cooled while a brazed<br>
joint forms between the components to be joined. The method may join the<br>
components by adhesive force or cohesively.<br>
[37]	A further method for joining two or more components, which comprises the<br>
following steps, is provided. An amorphous, ductile brazing alloy foil according to any<br>
of the embodiments described above is applied between two or more of the metal<br>
components to be joined. The components to be joined have a higher melting tem-<br>
perature than the brazing alloy foil and may be made of stainless steel or an Ni or Co<br>
alloy. The brazing composite is heated to a temperature above the liquidus temperature<br>
of the brazing alloy foil and then cooled while a brazed joint forms between the<br>
components to be joined.<br>
[38]	The components to be joined are preferably components of a heat exchanger or<br>
exhaust gas recirculation cooler or components of a fuel cell. These products require a<br>
reliable brazed joint which is completely leak-proof, resistant against corrosion at<br>
elevated operating temperatures, mechanically stable and merefore reliable. The<br>
brazing alloy foils according to the invention provide such a joint.<br>
[39]	The brazing alloys and brazing alloy foils according to the invention can be used to<br>
produce one or more brazed seams in an object. The brazed object may be a heat<br>
exchanger, an exhaust gas recirculation cooler or a component of a fuel cell. In one<br>
embodiment, the brazed object is designed for use in a reductive or oxidising acidic<br>
medium, in another embodiment for use in a reductive medium and in yet another em-<br>
bodiment for use in an oxidising acidic medium which further contains sulphate and/or<br>
nitrate and/or chloride ions, or for use in a reductive or oxidising acidic medium of an<br>
internal combustion engine. /<br>
[40]	The brazing alloys according to the invention are produced as amorphous, ho-<br>
mogeneous and ductile brazing alloy foils in a rapid solidification process in one em-<br>
bodiment of the method. For this purpose, a metal melt with the composition FeaNiRest<br>
CrbMOeCudSi eBfPg is provided, consisting essentially of<br>
[41]	FeaNRestCrbMocCu dSieBfPg,<br>
[42]	wherein 0 atomic % 
atomic % 
atomic %; 0 atomic % 
[43]	wherein if 0 atomic % 
[44]	and if a=0, then 0.5 atomic % 
[45]	This melt is sprayed through a casting nozzle onto a casting wheel or casting drum<br>
and cooled at a rate of more than 105 ° C/s. The cast strip is then typically removed<br>
from the casting wheel at a temperature between 100 ° C and 300 ° C and directly<br><br>
wound to form a so-called coil or wound onto a reel to provide an amorphous, ductile<br>
brazing alloy foil.<br>
[46]	In a further method, amorphous brazing alloy foils are used to join two or more<br>
components by adhesive force, the method comprising the following steps:<br>
[47]	- Provision of a melt of FeaNRestCrbMocCudSi eBrPg, consisting essentially of<br>
[48]	FeaNiReastCrbMocCu d SieBfPg,<br>
[49]	wherein 0 atomic % 
atomic % 
atomic %; 0 atomic % 
[50]	wherein if 0 atomic % 
[51]	and if a=0, then 0.5 atomic % 
[52]	- Production of an amorphous brazing alloy foil by rapid solidification of the melt on<br>
a moving cooling surface at a rate of more than approximately 10s ° C/s;<br>
[53]	- Formation of a brazing composite by applying the brazing alloy foil between the<br>
metal components to be joined;<br>
[54]	- Heating of the brazing composite to a temperature above the liquidus temperature<br>
of the brazing alloy foil;<br>
[55]	- Cooling of the brazing composite accompanied by the formation of a joint between<br>
the metal components to be joined.<br>
[56]	The process of joining by adhesive force as described above involves brazing with<br>
the nickel brazing alloy according to the invention, which is capable of producing<br>
perfect brazed joints without any joining faults.<br>
[57]	The liquidus temperature of the brazing alloy according to the invention is less than<br>
1200 ° C. The brazing alloy according to the invention can in particular be used to join<br>
metal components made of stainless steel and/or nickel and/or Co alloys by adhesive<br>
force. Such components typically include components used in heat exchangers or<br>
related products and in exhaust gas recirculation coolers.<br>
[58]	The invention is described in detail below with reference to embodiments and com-<br>
parative examples.<br>
[59]	Figure 1 illustrates the weight loss in a corrosion test on stainless steel samples with<br>
brazed joints of a first basic composition with additions of Mo and/or Cu;<br>
[60]	Figure 2 illustrates the weight loss in a corrosion test on stainless steel samples with<br>
brazed joints of a second basic composition with various Mo additions;<br>
[61]	Figure 3 illustrates the weight loss in a corrosion test on stainless steel samples with<br>
brazed joints of a second basic composition with various Cu additions; and<br>
[62]	Figure 4 illustrates the weight loss in a corrosion test on stainless steel samples with<br>
brazed joints of a second basic composition with varying iron content.<br>
[63]	At least partially amorphous nickel- and iron-based brazing alloy foils of various<br><br>
compositions were produced in a rapid solidification process. The corrosion resistance<br>
of brazed seams with additions of Cu, Mo or a combination of Cu and Mo was<br>
compared to that of brazing alloy foils without molybdenum and copper.<br>
[64]	In a first embodiment, the corrosion resistance of a combination of Mo and Cu<br>
additions was compared to that of Mo only and Cu only in a first basic composition. At<br>
least partially amorphous brazing alloy foils were produced by means of rapid solidi-<br>
fication technology. The compositions of the foil are listed in Table 1.<br>
[65]	In this first embodiment, the brazing alloy foils had a composition of 12.3 atomic %<br>
Cr, 3.7 atomic % Fe, 7.9 atomic % Si and 12.8 atomic % B, the rest being nickel.<br>
Further foils were produced with 12.3 atomic % Cr, 3.7 atomic % Fe, 7.9 atomic % Si<br>
and 12.8 atomic % B with additions of copper and/or molybdenum, the rest being<br>
nickel. One brazing alloy foil contains 2 atomic % of copper, a second foil 1 atomic %<br>
of molybdenum and a third foil 1 atomic % of molybdenum and 2 atomic % of copper.<br>
[66]	Stainless steel samples (316L, 1.4404), wherein a base plate is joined to two tube<br>
sections, were brazed in a vacuum using the above foils at a temperature of 1200 ° C.<br>
The brazed components were placed in a corrosive medium with pH 
- and Cl- ions at 70 ° C. The weight loss of the various samples after 720 hours of<br>
exposure is shown in Figure 1.<br>
[67]	Figure 1 shows clearly that an addition of Cu only or of Mo only results in an only .<br>
moderate improvement of corrosion resistance compared to a brazed joint produced<br>
without Mo and Cu. The lowest weight loss and therefore the best corrosion resistance<br>
is found in the brazing alloy containing both Mo and Cu. The combined addition of<br>
Mo and Cu provides a brazing alloy with improved corrosion resistance.<br>
[68]	In a second embodiment, the influence of a combined addition of Mo and Cu on the<br>
corrosion resistance of a second basic composition was investigated. In this second<br>
embodiment, a brazing alloy with a combination of Mo and Cu additions was<br>
compared to copper-free brazing alloys with increasing Mo content.<br>
[69]	At least partially amorphous brazing alloy foils were produced by means of rapid so-<br>
lidification technology. In this second embodiment, the brazing alloy foils had a basic<br>
composition of 11 atomic % Cr, 35 atomic % Ni, 11.5 atomic % Si and 7 atomic % B,<br>
the rest being iron. Copper-free foils were produced with 11 atomic % Cr, 35 atomic %<br>
Ni, 11.5 atomic % Si and 7 atomic % B with 0.5,1 and 1.5 atomic % molybdenum, the<br>
rest being iron. In addition, a foil was produced with 11 atomic % Cr, 35 atomic % Ni,<br>
11.5 atomic % Si and 7 atomic % B with an addition of 2 atomic % copper and 1<br>
atomic % Mo, the rest being iron. These compositions are listed in Table 2. The second<br>
basic composition therefore contains significantly more iron than the first basic com-<br>
position.<br>
[70]	Stainless steel samples were produced as in the first embodiment, and corrosion<br><br>
resistance was tested as described above. In the second embodiment, the samples were<br>
exposed for 864 hours, whereupon their weight loss was measured.<br>
[71]	As Figure 2 shows, the alloy with a combined addition of Mo and Cu loses the least<br>
weight and has therefore the best corrosion resistance. The corrosion resistance of the<br>
alloy containing both Mo and Cu cannot be reached by simply varying the mo-<br>
lybdenum content in an alloy comprising only molybdenum and no copper.<br>
[72]	In a third embodiment, the influence of a combined addition of Mo and Cu on the<br>
corrosion resistance of a third basic composition was investigated. At least partially<br>
amorphous brazing alloy foils were produced by means of rapid solidification<br>
techDnology. In this third embodiment, the brazing alloy foils had a basic composition<br>
of 11 atomic % Cr, 35 atomic % Ni, 11.5 atomic % Si and 7 atomic % B, the rest being<br>
iron. A copper-free foil was produced with 11 atomic % Cr, 35 atomic % Ni, 11.5<br>
atomic % Si and 7 atomic % B with 1 atomic % molybdenum, the rest being iron. Mo-<br>
lybdenum-free foils were produced with 11 atomic % Cr, 35 atomic % Ni, 11.5 atomic<br>
% Si and 7 atomic % B with an addition of 1 and 2 atomic % copper, each with 1<br>
atomic % Mo, the rest being iron. These compositions are listed in Table 3.<br>
[73]	Stainless steel samples were produced as in the first embodiment, and corrosion<br>
resistance was tested as described above. Figure 3 shows their weight loss after 720<br>
hours' exposure.<br>
[74]	Figure 3 shows that the corrosion resistance of brazing alloys with additions of Mo<br>
and Cu is noticeably better than that of alloys with Mo only.<br>
[75]	In a fourth embodiment, the corrosion resistance of at least partially amorphous<br>
brazing alloy foils with a combination of 1 atomic % Mo and 1 atomic % Cu and in-<br>
creasing iron content was investigated.<br>
[76]	The at least partially amorphous brazing alloy foils were produced by means of rapid<br>
solidification technology. At least partially amorphous foils with an Fe content of 0,<br>
10,20,30,40,50,60 and 70 atomic %, each with a Cr content of 11 atomic %, an Si<br>
content of 9 atomic %, a B content of 9 atomic %, an Mo content of 1 atomic % and a<br>
Cu content of 2 atomic %, were produced, the rest being nickel. These compositions<br>
are listed in Table 4.<br>
[77]	Figure 4 shows that the corrosion resistance of foils containing Mo and Cu remains<br>
virtually constant up to an Fe content of 50 atomic %. This offers the advantage that<br>
nickel can be replaced by iron up to an Fe content of 50 atomic % without significantly<br>
affecting corrosion resistance. As a result, raw material costs can be reduced.<br>
