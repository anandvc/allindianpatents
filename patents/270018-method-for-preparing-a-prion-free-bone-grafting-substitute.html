METHOD FOR PREPARING A PRION-FREE BONE GRAFTING SUBSTITUTE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a method for preparing it bone graft substitute using bovine hone, and more particularly to a method for preparing a safe bone graft substitute which does not have the risk of infection with bovine spongiform encephalopathy, the method comprising treating bovine bone with sodium hypochlorite and treating the treated hone al a high temperature of more than 600 C.<br>
BACKGROUNDART<br>
A bone graft substitute BGSi refers to a graft material that N used to substitute for bone tissue defects caused by various dental diseases or traumas, disease-related degeneration or other loss of tissue, so as to fill pore spaces in the hone tissue and to promote the formation of new bone. The best graft is generally known to be autogenous bone graft, but the autogenous bone graft has -problems in that it requires a secondary surgical operation, is difficult to obtain the required amount, is difficult to carry out at small-scale hospitals, and has a possibility that makes patient's pain and morbidity severe.<br>
For this reason, various substitutes, including donated human bones, artificial bones, and artificially synthesized materials made of bone hydroxyapatite. have been used for grafting. Commercially available bone substitutes are advantageous in thai they are available in various forms, including powder, gel. slurry/putty, tablets, chips, morsels, pellets, sticks, sheets and blocks, are homogeneous, have a low risk with respect to infection and disease, eliminate the risk of pains resulting from  the  collection of a patient's  own bones  for grafting,  and  have reduced<br><br><br>
In an attempt to solve these problems, bone minerals obtained by physicochemically treating animal bones having a structure similar to that of human bones so as to remove organic suhsumees have been processed such that they could be used in dental or orthopedic surgical operations. A typical example thereof may include Bio-Oss© commercially available from Geistlich Biomaterials.<br>
A method for preparing said bone graft substitute using animal bones comprises the steps of: treating the thighbone of a bovine animal in a solvent having a boiling point of K0-120V to remove lipids; adding ammonia or primary amine to the treated  bone  to remove  proteins  and  organic  substances,   thus  obtaining  hone<br><br>
Although there was an example where a cartilage was treated with sodium hypochlorite to selectively remove the collagen phase in order to observe the remaining cartilage structure (Broz. J..I. ct a!.. J. Mater. Sci. Mater. Med. 8:395. 1997). it has not yet been reported that sodium hypochlorite K used to remove all proteins in the preparation of bone minerals.<br>
Among such animal bones, the most frequently used bone is bovine bone, and said Bio-Oss© product is also produced using the bovine bone as a raw material. However, as the onset of bovine spongiform encephalopathy has recently been frequent, the safety of the bovine bone as a raw material with respect to bovine spongiform encephalopathy is not ensured. For this reason, in a step of processing bovine bone into a bone graft material, a prion that causes bovine spongiform   encephalopathy   must   be   removed.      Because   the   prion   is   not<br><br>
completely removed even at a high temperature of 600 ( \ it cannot be removed hv methods known so far. and thus the development of a novel method is required.<br>
Accordingly, the present inventors have prepared a bone graft substitute, which does not have the risk of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, using a method comprising the steps of inactivating prion protein with sodium hypochlorite in a process of preparing a bone graft substitute using bovine bone, and heating the resulting hone at a high temperature of 600 . thereby completing the present invention.<br>
SUMMARY OF INN^NTION<br>
In one aspect, the present invention relates to a method for preparing a bone graft substitute, which is completely free of prion protein that causes bovine spongiform encephalopathy, the method comprising treating bovine bone uith -.odium hypochlorite and heating the treated bone at a high temperature.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention relates to a bone graft substitute composition containing the bone graft substitute prepared according to said method.<br>
Other features and embodiments of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description and claims.<br>

Example 1: Preparation of bone graft substitute<br>
[Pretreatment and grinding step]<br>
A bovine femoral bone was cut to a size of ? cm' using a bone cutter. The cut bone pieces were immersed in deionized water for 24 hours to remove blood components present in the bone. The bone pieces washed with deioni/ed water were boiled for 72 hours while replacing the deionized water at 12-hr intervals, thus primarily removing lipids and proteins present in the bones. The bone pieces from which the lipids and proteins have primarily been removed were completely dried in an oven at 60 C for 24 hours, and then ground to a size of less than 0.7 mm using a mill.<br>
[Defatting step!<br>
To 1 g of the ground bone powder. 2(1 ml of a mixed solvent of chloroform and<br><br>
methanol (1:1 \/vt was added and (he solution was shaken a( a rotating speed of 120 rpm for 24 hours so as to defat the bone powder. In order to remo\e the solvent remaining in the defatted hone powder, deionized water was added to the bone powder in a weight ratio of 50:1. and then the solution v\ as shaken at 120 rpm for 12 hours, thus removing the solvent remaining in the powder. At this time, the deionized water was replaced with fresh deionized water at 2-hr intervals in order to increase washing efficiency. The washed bone powder was completely dried in an oven at 60V.<br>
[Deproteinizing step]<br>
To 1 g of the defatted bone powder. 25ml of a solution of 4r<f sodium hypochlorite was added and the powder solution shaken at a rotating speed of rpm for hours so as to remove proteins present in bone inactivate prion that catises bovine spongiform encephalopathy. order></f><br>
added to I g of the bone powder, and the solution was shaken at 120 rpm for 72 hours, thus removing the sodium hypochlorite remaining in the powder. At this time, the deionized water was replaced with fresh deionized water every two hours for the first I 2 hours, and then replaced with fresh deionized w ater every I 2 horns. The water-washed bone powder was completely dried in an o\ en at 60 i'.<br>
[Thermal treatment step]<br>
The defatted, deproteinized and dried bone powder was thermally treated at high temperature to remove lipids and proteins remaining therein. The temperature of an electric furnace used for the thermal treatment was elevated at a rale of 2 ' Vmin. and the bone powder was thermally treated at 600' for 3 hours, followed by furnace cooling.<br>
[Sieving step]<br>
The thermal!v treated bone powder was sieved through a sieve having a pore size<br><br>
ot 215-425 :&gt;_m. and the sieved hone powder was washed a few limes with deionized water to remove fine particles remaining on the surface thereof, and then dried in an oven at 60 V for 24 hours. The dried hone powder was collected and used as a bone graft substitute.<br>
The bone powder subjected to the above-described steps was analyzed using a scanning electron microscope and. as a result, hydroxyapatite particles having a size of 50-H0 nm were observed in the bone powder tRG. H. Also, the bone powder was analyzed by XRD and. LIS a result, it could be observed that a pure, low-crystalline apatite phase was produced in the bone powder (FIG. 2), Also, from the results of FT-IR analysis, it was confirmed that the bone powder was a low crystalline carbonate apatite containing a carbonate group, similar to human bone (FIG. 3).<br>
Example 2: Preparation of composition for bone gruff substitution<br>
To 100 g of desalted water. 20 g of hyaluronic acid was added to make a viscous hyaluronic acid solution, to which 10 g of the bone powder prepared in Example 1 was then added to make an injectable paste.<br>
Example 3: Evaluation of osteoconductivitv of bone graft substitute<br>
In order to examine the osteoconductivity of the inventive bone graft substitute, the evaluation of osteoconductivity was conducted for the hone graft substitute prepared according to the method of Example 1. and commercially available bone substitutes Bio-Oss,R' and OsteoGraf^'/N as control groups. In this Example. New Zealand white rabbits were used and circular defects having a diameter of S mm were formed in the cranial bones of the animals and then implanted with each of the inventive bone graft substitute. Bio-Oss'Rl and OsteoGraf,K7N granules. At 2 weeks and 4 weeks after the implantation, tissue samples were prepared and<br><br>
comparatively analyzed for osteoconduetiviry nn the basis of the amount of hone produced around each of the hone graft substitutes and the production or non-produclion of connective tissues.<br>
As a result, in the test samples prepared at 2 weeks after implantation of the three bone substitutes, only connective tissues were mostly produced around the portions implanted with Bio-Oss'R,anti OsteoGrafk'/N. and the formation of new bones was hardly observed around the implanted portions (FIG. 4). On the other hand, as shown in FIG. 4(c). it could be observed that the sample implanted with the bone graft substitute prepared in Example I had a large amount of new bones produced therein (see arrow in FIG. 4(c)).<br>
FIG. 5 shows photographs of tissue samples prepared at 4 weeks after implantation with  the  three  bone  substitutes.     As  shown  in  FIG.  5.  in  the  tissue  samples<br><br>
were formed and mosfh surrounded b\ connective tissues, and on the other hand, in the tissue samples implanted with the bone graft substitute prepared in the Example 1. a large amount of new bones were produced and grown around the bone graft substitute. This suggests that the bone graft substitute prepared according to the present invention has very excellent osteoconductivin compared to those of the prior bone graft substitutes.<br>
