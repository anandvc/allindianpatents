				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to aprocess for the preparation of layered double hydroxides from homogeneous nanobinary or ternary metal oxy/hydroxide of LDH.In particular it relates to a process for preparing and self-assembly of nanobinary and ternary metal oxy/hydroxides with high surface area and 1-10 nm size by aerogel procedure, involving homogenization of metal organic precursors in solvent mixture, controlled hydrolysis, gelation, hydrothermal treatment and finally supercritical drying of solvent.<br>
During the self-assembly, the nano materials can be modulated into thin films, nano fibers, membranes, layered structures embedded with intercalated anions comprising of inorganic and organic anions selected from carbonates, phosphates, chromates, ibuprofen, dichlorofenec, salicylic acid, tartaric acid, dyes, and any other similar anions. These self- assembled materials find applications as catalysts, gene reservoirs, controlled drug release, solar energy harvesters. Background of the invention<br>
Nano materials have generated unprecedented interest due to their unusual physical and chemical properties with wide and divergent applications in optics, electronics, magnetics, mechanics and catalysis. Nanocrystalline metal oxides exhibit unparalleled destructive adsorption properties of acid gases, polar organics, and even chemical/biological warfare agents. Due to high surface area, these nanostructured solid materials display good catalytic activity in isomerisation, alkylation, reforming and dehydrohalogenation reactions.<br>
Generally, aerogel samples are prepared by supercritical drying of a gel from a sol-gel reaction. The aerogel has a specific high surface area with low density. Due to its physical characteristics, aerogel sample is useful as a catalyst or as a carrier for a catalyst.<br>
LDHs, which consist of alternating cationic M111-X M"'X (0H)2X+ and anionic An-.zH20 layers have received much attention in recent times in view of their potential applications as catalysts, adsorbents, biomateriais for controlled drug delivery and gene reservoirs.<br>
Reference is made to Nanostnictured Materials, 1999, 11, 1091 wherein nano particles of Zinc oxide and alumina were prepared independently by chemical arrested precipitation and then converted into nanocomposites by wet mixing. The inherent disadvantage of this protocol is the development of non-homogeneous material.<br><br>
Reference is made to Journal of Solid State Chemistry, 2002, 165, 193<br>
wherein binary oxides like titanium dioxide and tin oxide are prepared by stearic acid<br>
method wherein particle size range from 10-15 nanometers. The drawback is the<br>
system is non- homogeneous.<br>
Reference is made to Chemistry of Materials, 2002, 14, 2922 wherein binary<br>
alumina and magnesium oxides were prepared by sol-gel method. The ratios of the<br>
alumina and magnesium oxides were not related to the normal hydrotalcites. The<br>
drawback is the system is non- homogeneous.<br>
Reference is made to Nature, 2000, 403, 65 wherein the homogeneous<br>
nanobinary barium oxide and alumina were synthesized by reverse microemulsion<br>
technique. The particle size ranges from 3-10 nanometers. The drawback is use of<br>
expensive protocol.<br>
Reference is made to Microporous and Mesoporous Materials, 2000, 39, 229<br>
wherein the nano layered double hydroxides were prepared by sol-gel method. The<br>
drawbacks are the size of the particles are high, ranging from 300-600 nanometers and<br>
the surface area of the samples lower ranging from 240-270 m2/g.<br>
Reference is made to Chemistry of Materials, 2002, 14, 4286 wherein nanolayered<br>
double hydroxides with uniform crystal size were prepared by co-precipitation<br>
in colloid mill and aging for 100°C for 13 h. The drawback is that the particle size<br>
obtained in this method is about 60-80 nanometers.<br>
Reference is made to Journal of American Chemical Society, 2000, 122, 3530<br>
wherein the zeolite nanoparticles assembles into thin films, membranes, or fibers.<br>
Reference is also made to Angewandte Chemie, 2002, 41, 1188 wherein the<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The novelty of the present invention relates to a process for preparing and selfassembly<br>
of nanobinary and ternary metal oxy/hydroxides of Mg-Al binary (Mg/Al<br>
ratios 2:1 and 3:1) and Ni-Mg-Al ternary systems [(Mg+Ni)/Al ratios (1.3+0.7): 1 and<br>
(1.9+1.1): 1] by aerogel procedure, involving homogenization of metal organic<br>
precursors in solvent mixture, controlled hydrolysis, gelation, hydrothermal treatment<br>
and finally supercritical drying of solvent. The novelty of the present invention<br>
provides a process for manufacturing of homogeneous nanobinary and ternary metal<br>
oxy/hydroxides by aerogel method with an increased surface area. The self-assembly<br>
of the nano metal oxy/ hydroxides when mediated by anion forms normal layered<br>
double hydroxides. These self- assembled materials finds applications as catalysts,<br>
gene reservoirs, controlled drug release, solar energy harvesters.<br>
The nanobinary and ternary metal oxy/hydoxides have particle size ranging<br>
from 1-10 nanometers and high surface area in the range of 500-700 m2/g. Preferred<br>
compositions are made from alkoxides and acetylacetonates of the desired metals. The<br>
nanobinary and ternary metal oxy/hydoxides prepared in the present invention have<br>
an excellent self-assembling property and can be modulated into thin films, fibers,<br>
membranes, when mediated by anions selected from inorganic and organic anions<br>
such as carbonates, phosphates, chromates, ibuprofen, dichlorofenec, salicylic acid,<br>
tartaric acid, dyes, and any other similar anions. The unprecedented self-assembly of<br>
these nanoparticles driven by anion to normal LDH, helps in controlled drug release,<br>
solar energy harvester, gene reservoir.<br>
The process of the present invention generally comprises an aerogel protocol,<br>
comprising hydrolysis of metal alkoxides /acetylacetonates selected from bivalent<br>
metals ions comprising Mg2+ or any other metals consisting of Ni2+, Cu2+, Co2+, Zn2+,<br>
Fe2+ and Mn2+ ions and trivalent metal ions selected from A13+ and optionally other<br>
metals consisting of Ga3+, Ni3+, Co3+, Fe3+, Mn3+, Cr3^, V3+, Ti3+, La3+ and In3+ ions<br>
in different ratios of M(II)/M(III) ranging from 1-5 in a solvent mixture selected from<br>
alcohols /hydrocarbons, by controlled addition of deionised water/their mixtures with<br>
alcohols, aging for 6 to 16 hours, followed hydrothermal treatment at temperatures<br>
ranging from 100 to 300 °C and pressures ranging from 50 to 150 atm and finally<br>
supercritical drying to obtain a free flow powder and the nanostructured LDH self<br>
assembled by the addition of anions selected from carbonates, phosphates, chromates,<br>
ibuprofen, salicylic acid, tartaric acid, etc, into normal layered double hydroxides in<br>
hexagonal, fibrous, membrane or thin film.<br>
Hydrolysis preferably involves homogenization of metal precursors in<br>
hydrocarbon-alcohol solvent followed by controlled addition of stoichiometric<br>
amount of deionised water. Metal alkoxides used are selected from methoxide,<br>
ethoxide, isomers of propoxide, butoxide and pentoxide. Preferred ratio of bivalent<br>
and trivalent metal ions is 2 to 3.<br>
The solvent mixture used is selected from hexane, toluene, xylene, methanol,<br>
ethanol, butanol etc., and aging is preferably done for 10 to 12 hours. The reaction<br>
mixture is hydrothermally heated with the ramping of temperature 1 °C per minute to<br>
260 to 280 °C, and kept for 5 to 10 minutes under higher pressures from 60 to 120 atm.<br>
The solvent mixture is vented out at super critical conditions to obtain a free flow of<br>
nano LDH. The recovered solvent free aerogel is dried overnight about 120 °C to<br>
remove the traces of solvent. The surface areas of homogeneous nanobinary and<br>
ternary materials range from 500-700 m2/g and particle size ranges from 1-10 nm. It is<br>
observed that the nanoparticles self-assemble on treatment with sodium carbonate/<br>
phosphate/ chromate/ ibuprofen, dicholorofenec solution at room temperature to<br>
normal layered double hydroxides.<br>
