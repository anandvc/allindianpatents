				<td>A SET OF PRE-MANUFACTURED TEETH FOR THE<br>
PREMOLARS AND/OR MOLARS OF THE DENTITION<br>
The invention relates to a set of pre-manufactured<br>
teeth.<br>
In dentistry, occlusion is the usual term for the<br>
contact between teeth of the upper jaw and teeth of the<br>
lower jaw. In reconstruction of an occlusion and thus<br>
of a masticatory surface, the aim is to ensure that the<br>
tooth contacts occur uniformly and simultaneously in<br>
all four support zones and that, upon functional<br>
movements (primarily protrusion, laterotrusion and<br>
mediotrusion movements) of the lower jaw relative to<br>
the upper jaw, uninterrupted sliding is obtained<br>
between all antagonist posterior teeth. This applies<br>
nowadays to individual rehabilitation.<br>
The various occlusion concepts are named for their<br>
characteristics in respect of centric contact (point-<br>
centric, long-centric, freedom-in-centric) and in<br>
respect of the relationships in laterotrusion,<br>
mediotrusion and protrusion (cuspid guidance, group<br>
guidance). The added consideration of the relationships<br>
on the mediotrusion side (balance side) led to the<br>
various occlusion concepts being divided into three<br>
main groups:<br>
1.	fully balanced occlusion types<br>
2.	unilaterally balanced occlusion types, and<br>
3.	occlusion types with anterior/cuspid guidance.<br>
The early occlusion concepts arose in the context of<br>
the problem of complete denture prosthetics. From the<br>
aim of positioning the prosthesis as steadily as<br>
possible against tilting in order to secure the<br>
adhesive anchoring, fully balanced concepts were<br>
necessarily developed in which the importance of<br>
individual functional elements was ignored. (Banwill;<br><br>
Spee, Muhlstein concept; Gysi, Morser-Pistill concept;<br>
Monson,   spherical   shell   concept).<br>
Consequently, the factory-made teeth developed for<br>
these methods had no functional masticatory surfaces.<br>
The concept of organic occlusion qualified the<br>
importance of the contacts present in the excursive<br>
movements. It starts from the premise that excursions<br>
are not guided by the teeth in the masticating movement<br>
(occlusion with anterior/cuspid guidance, Stallard,<br>
Stuart).<br>
A uniform occlusion concept for complete denture<br>
prosthetics and the natural bite has not as yet been<br>
postulated. The hope of finding the ideal occlusion<br>
concept by describing the natural state, through data<br>
from anthropological studies, has also come to nothing.<br>
(Begg,   Beyron).<br>
The principles of the "freedom-in-centric" concept are<br>
that the cusps are fixed as far as possible through<br>
three-point contacts on a flat area in the central<br>
fossa which is not provided by nature but instead has<br>
been formed either on the basis of an individually<br>
modeled restoration or by grinding. (Artificial<br>
occlusion  form,   Posselt,   Schuyler)<br>
The concept of "organic disclusion" is based on a<br>
mutually protective function of anterior and posterior<br>
teeth. (Stallart, Stuart) . For individual restoration,<br>
this is nowadays the most widely used technique since,<br>
through the additive technique (waxing-up technique,<br>
Thomas), it yields much more precise wax modeling<br>
results than does subtractive shaping.<br>
It is only recently that the resulting modern<br>
requirements for individual functional masticatory<br>
surfaces have been postulated. (Freesmeyer, Sieber).<br>
The properties of factory-made teeth for the removable<br><br>
denture have also been recently described. In<br>
particular, the combination of the study of the natural<br>
model with geometric and mechanical considerations has<br>
led to the concept of the inductive-deductive<br>
functional masticatory surface (Monkmeyer).<br>
Since the principle of additive shaping cannot be<br>
applied in the production of an individual denture with<br>
factory-made teeth, these have to be pre-manufactured<br>
in such a way that they can be tailored individually in<br>
the subtractive method. The postulated arrangement, in<br>
this connection, of the antagonist contacts in relation<br>
to the sagittal and transverse compensation curve has<br>
led to the development of teeth which are supported<br>
vertically in the position of intercuspation and which<br>
function in the fully balanced occlusion concept, the<br>
unilaterally balanced occlusion concept, and the<br>
anterior/cuspid guided occlusion concept. Such sets of<br>
teeth are known, for example, from PCT/EP99/06079,<br>
which describes sets of teeth in which the stamp cusps<br>
of an antagonist in the intercuspation position come to<br>
rest on three or more contact points in the fossa of<br>
the other antagonist. The contact points are disposed<br>
on a sagittal and transverse compensation curve defined<br>
by the movement of the jaw condyles. Such sets of teeth<br>
can also be set up in tooth-to-tooth relationship, for<br>
example one tooth to two teeth, in class I, II and III<br>
cases and in cross-bite (Monkmeyer).<br>
In order to avoid laterotrusion and mediotrusion<br>
disturbances in any event, and to ensure a harmonious<br>
take-over of the guide surfaces in the event of<br>
abrasion phenomena, it is recommended for the<br>
individual restoration to include a disclusion of the<br>
posterior teeth which increases uniformly from anterior<br>
to posterior. This is achieved by having the<br>
inclination of the cusp slopes decrease sequentially by<br>
5° per tooth (Slavicek).<br><br>
DE 29 16 622 Ul describes abrasion teeth, as already<br>
also described by Hildebrandt, whose abrasions simulate<br>
a natural abrasion state by contact surfaces being<br>
formed from original contact points.<br>
The discussion of the occlusion concepts is closely<br>
associated with the phenomenon of abrasion and<br>
attrition. The question of to what extent abrasion and<br>
attrition can be classified as a physiological or<br>
pathological phenomenon has not as yet been fully<br>
clarified. (Berry)<br>
Factory-made teeth derived from these requirements of<br>
individual prosthetics should anticipate abrasion<br>
processes. Abrasion processes in the context of<br>
occlusion are highly sensitive processes. So-called<br>
abrasion teeth do not satisfy this demand because their<br>
abrasions are not methodically connected to the<br>
processes in the complex stomatognathic system. It has<br>
been argued by Schulz-Bongard that the central problem<br>
in this context is the loss of the central<br>
relationship.<br>
The object of the invention is to make available sets<br>
of teeth which, upon functional movements of the lower<br>
jaw with respect to the upper jaw, permit uninterrupted<br>
sliding between all antagonist posterior teeth, without<br>
losing the central relationship in the vertical and<br>
horizontal, and which can be factory-made and can be<br>
tailored individually in the subtraction technique.<br>
According to the invention, the object is achieved by a<br>
set of pre-manufactured teeth, consisting at least of<br>
one first molar or premolar selected from a group of<br>
molars or premolars provided for one jaw, and at lease<br>
of one second premolar or molar selected from a group<br>
of antagonists provided for the other jaw, at least<br>
three centric contact points being provided in each<br>
case in the fossa of a premolar or molar, a stamp cusp<br><br>
of the antagonist coming to rest on the contact points<br>
in a position of intercuspation, and the contact points<br>
being disposed on a compensation curve defined by the<br>
movement of the jaw condyles. The set of teeth<br>
according to the invention is characterized in that the<br>
centric contact points each lie on a spherical sector,<br>
and abrasions are disposed in at least one movement<br>
track without breaking up at least one of the<br>
punctiform contacts. The abrasions can also be so<br>
arranged that more than one or all punctiform contacts<br>
are maintained.<br>
Based on inductive and deductive considerations,<br>
natural unabraded dentitions were therefore copied,<br>
brought into occlusion in jaw simulators according to<br>
the rules of the art, and checked for their suitability<br>
in respect of the discussed occlusion concepts. The<br>
results show that these natural teeth function only<br>
very limitedly according to the different systems. The:<br>
teeth were then modifed in the sense of PCT/EP06079.<br>
The stamp cusps and the fossae were altered in such a<br>
way that each stamp cusp comes to rest on three points<br>
of its antagonist fossa in centric relationship (IKP).<br>
These bearing points were designed as spherical-sector-<br>
shaped convexities, the aim being to ensure that a<br>
concavity is arranged between the contact and the cusp<br>
degree. In addition, they were posted in the vertical<br>
dimension onto the compensation curves. These<br>
modifications afforded the abovementioned<br>
possibilities.<br>
The cusp slopes were then ground in protrusion,<br>
laterotrusion and mediotrusion tracks with a trajectory<br>
of inclination of 40°. All cusp portions disturbing a<br>
smooth trajectory were planed. The centric contacts<br>
"were not interrupted by virtue of their arrangement,<br>
which in contrast to DE 297 16 622 Ul ensures the<br>
vertical spacing and the central relation of the jaws<br>
to one another.  To achieve a disclusion increasing<br><br>
uniformly from anterior to posterior, the abrasion<br>
inclination angles were shaped decreasing by ca. 5°<br>
sequentially from anterior to posterior.<br>
It has been found that teeth manufactured according to<br>
this method:<br>
1.	function without modification in a very large<br>
number of cases (&gt; 55%);<br>
2.	can be tailored individually by simple,<br>
subtractive measures, so that they also function<br>
in the majority of all cases (&gt; 97%);<br>
3.	still satisfy the requirement of vertical support<br>
after suitable modification;<br>
4.	function in all occlusion concepts;<br>
5.	require less modification, in the fully balanced<br>
and unilaterally balanced occlusion concept, than<br>
teeth in the sense of PCT/EP99/06079;<br>
6.	are subject to less wear than teeth which<br>
centrically are supported not horizontally and<br>
vertically, but instead on slanting planes.<br>
The  inclination  of  the  abrasion	surfaces  on  the<br>
mediotrusion side is preferably 3 to	7 degrees, and in<br>
particular 5 degrees, less than on	the laterotrusion<br>
side.<br>
The inclination of the abrasion surfaces of adjacent<br>
teeth can decrease sequentially from anterior to<br>
posterior, in particular by in each case 3 to 7<br>
degrees, and preferably by 5 degrees.<br>
Preferred values for the inclination of the abrasion<br>
surface for premolar 4 on the mediotrusion side have<br><br>
been found to be between 35 and 42 degrees, in<br>
particular 40 degrees. On the laterotrusion side, the<br>
preferred angle is 40 to 47 degrees, preferably 45<br>
degrees. The further teeth possibly included in the set<br>
of teeth then follow the above scheme in terms of the<br>
inclination of their abrasion surfaces.<br>
A set of teeth according to the invention can consist<br>
of premolars or molars 4, 5, 6 and 7, the inclination<br>
of the abrasion surfaces corresponding to the following<br>
scheme:<br>
Tooth	Cusp inclination on the<br>
mediotrusion side      laterotrusion side<br>
4	35°-42°, in particular 40°   40°-47o, in particular 45°<br>
5	30°-37°, in particular 35°   35°-42°, in particular 40o<br>
6	25°-32°, in particular 30°   30°-37o,in particular 35°<br>
7	20°-27o, in particular 25°   25°-32o,in particular 30°<br>
The invention is explained in more detail below with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings, in which :<br>
Fig. 1 shows an antagonist pair of premolars 4 in<br>
cross section;<br>
Fig. 2  shows an antagonist pair of premolars 5 in<br>
cross section;<br>
Fig. 3 shows an antagonist pair of molars 6 in cross<br>
section;<br>
Fig. 4 shows an antagonist pair of molars 7 in cross<br>
section;<br>
Fig. 5 shows a row of teeth of an upper jaw and a row<br>
of teeth of a lower jaw, with the condyle and<br>
mandibular fossa;<br>
Fig. 6  shows an enlarged detail from Fig. 5.<br><br>
A set of teeth consisting of the premolars 4 of the<br>
upper jaw and lower jaw is shown in Fig. 1, where K<br>
designates the transverse compensation curve, Z.A.<br>
designates the tooth axis, the arrow M indicates the<br>
mediotrusion movement, and the arrow L indicates the<br>
laterotrusion movement.<br>
Each tooth has, in the fossa of its respective<br>
antagonist, at least three contact points on which its<br>
stamp cusps come to rest in the position of<br>
intercuspation. The contact points come to rest on<br>
spherical sectors and are disposed on the compensation<br>
curves defined by the movement of the jaw condyles and<br>
are designated by A, B and C. The inclination of the<br>
abrasion surfaces is 45° on the laterotrusion side (AN-<br>
L) and 40° on the mediotrusion side (AN-M).<br>
Fig. 2 shows the antagonist pair adjacent to the<br>
antagonist pair from Fig. 1, namely the premolars 5.<br>
The inclination of the abrasion surfaces of this pair<br>
of teeth, lying posterior to the premolars 4, decreases<br>
by a sequence of 5o. (The same applies to the molars 6<br>
and 7 - see Figures 3 and 4) . The inclination of the<br>
abrasion surfaces of the premolars 5 is 40° on the<br>
laterotrusion side and 35° on the mediotrusion side.<br>
Thus, in contrast to Slavicek, an opening of the angle<br>
of the entire cusp slope is not necessary, because the<br>
configuration of the abrasion surfaces fulfills the<br>
objective described by Slavicek without flatter<br>
inclination of the entire cusp slope including the<br>
centric contacts.<br>
In Figure 5, the centric contacts are designated by A1<br>
- A8, B1 - B4, C1 - C8 and R. The abrasion surfaces<br>
according to the invention are shown shaded. By virtue<br>
of the concavities surrounding them, the centric<br>
contacts remain free-standing.<br><br>
Fig 6 shows (as enlarged details from Fig. 5) an<br>
example of which abrasions are disposed according to<br>
the invention on a stamp cusp and an antagonistic fossa<br>
in the functional movements. P designates the<br>
protrusion movement, M the mediotrusion movement, and L<br>
the laterotrusion movement in the arrow direction. PSS<br>
OK designates the position of the cusp tip of the upper<br>
stamp cusp, and PSS UK designates that of the lower<br>
stamp cusp. In this context it should be noted that the<br>
details in the figures are not shown true to scale, and<br>
the size and angle data cannot be taken from the<br>
figures. They have been shown mainly for their<br>
illustrative character.<br><br>
