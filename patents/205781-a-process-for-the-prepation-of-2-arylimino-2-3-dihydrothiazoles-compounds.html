"A PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF 2-ARYLIMINO-2,3-DIHYDROTHIAZOLES COMPOUNDS"<br>
SOCIETE DE CONSEILS OF RECHERCHES ET D'APPLICATIONS SCIENTIFIQUES (S.C.R.A.S), of 51/53, rue du Docteur Blanche, F-75016 Paris, France,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of 2-arylimino-2,3-dihydrothiazoles compounds.<br>
A subject of the present Application is new derivatives of 2-arylimino-2,3-, dihydrothiazoles and their preparation processes. These products have a good affinity with certain sub-types of somatostatin receptors and therefore have useful pharmacological properties. The invention also relates to these same products as medicaments, the pharmaceutical compositions containing them and their use for the preparation of a medicament intended to treat pathological states or diseases in which one (or more) somatostatin receptors are involved.<br>
Somatostatin (SST) is a cyclic tetradecapeptide which was isolated for the first time from the hypothalamus as a substance which inhibits the growth hormone (Brazeau P. et al., Science 1973, 179, 77-79). It also operates as a neurotransmitter in the brain (Reisine T. et al., Neuroscience 1995, 67, 777-790; Reisine T. et al., Endocrinology 1995-16,427-442) Molecular cloning has allowed it to be shown that the bioactivity of somatostatin depends directly on a family of five receptors linked to the membrane<br>
The heterogeneity of the biological functions of somatostatin has lead to studies which try to identify the structure-activity relationships of peptide analogues on somatostatin receptors, which has led to the discovery of 5 sub-types of receptors (Yamada et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U.S.A, 89, 251-255,1992; Raynor, K. et al, Mol Pharmacol, 44, 385-392, 1993).   The functional roles of these receptors are currently being actively studied.   The affinities with different sub-types of somatostatin receptors have been associated with the treatment of the following disorders/diseases.   Activation of subÂ¬types 2 and 5 has been associated with suppression of the growth hormone (GH) and more particularly with that of adenomas secreting GH (acromegalia) and those secreting hormone TSH. Activation of sub-type 2 but not sub-type 5 has been associated with the treatment of adenomas secreting prolactin.    Other indications associated with the activation of sub-types of somatostatin receptors are the recurrence of stenosis, inhibition of the secretion of insulin and/or of glucagon and in particular diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, insensiblity to insulin, Syndrome X, angiopathy, proliferative<br>
retinopathy, dawn phenomenon and nephropathy; inhibition of the secretion of gastric<br><br>
- 2 -<br><br>
acid and in particular peptic ulcers, enterocutaneous and pancreaticocutaneous fistulae, irritable colon syndrome, dumping syndrome, aqueous diarrhea syndrome, diarrhea associated with AIDS, diarrhea induced by chemotherapy, acute or chronic pancreatitis and secretory gastrointestinal tumors; the treatment of cancer such as hepatomas; the 5 inhibition of angiogenesis, the treatment of inflammatory disorders such as arthritis; chronic rejection of allografts; angioplasty; the prevention of bleeding of grafted vessels and gastrointestinal bleeding. The agonists of somatostatin can also be used to reduce the weight of a patient.<br>
Among the pathological disorders associated with somatostatin (Moreau J.P. et al., Life 10     Sciences 1987, 40, 419; Harris A.G. et al., The European Journal of Medicine, 1993, 2, 97-105), there can be mentioned for example: acromegalia, hypophyseal adenomas, Cushing's disease, gonadotrophinomas and prolactinomas, catabolic side-effects of glucocorticoids, insulin dependent diabetes, diabetic retinopathy, diabetic nephropathy, hyperthyroidism,   gigantism,   endocrinic   gastroenteropancreatic   tumors   including 15     carcinoid    syndrome,    VIPoma,    insulinoma,    nesidioblastoma,    hyperinsulinemia, glucagonoma, gastrinoma and Zollinger-Ellison's syndrome, GRFoma as well as acute bleeding of the esophageal varices, gastroesophageal reflux, gastroduodenal reflux, pancreatitis, enterocutaneous and pancreatic fistulae but also diarrheas, refractory diarrheas of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, chronic secretary diarrhea, diarrhea 20     associated with irritable bowel syndrome, disorders linked with gastrin releasing peptide, secondary pathologies with intestinal grafts, portal hypertension as well as hemorrhages of the varices in patients with cirrhosis, gastro-intestinal hemorrhage, hemorrhage of the gastroduodenal ulcer, Crohn's disease, systemic scleroses, dumping syndrome, small intestine syndrome, hypotension, scleroderma and medullar thyroid 25     carcinoma, illnesses linked with cell hyperproliferation such as cancers and more particularly breast cancer prostate cancer, thyroid cancer as well as pancreatic cancer and colorectal cancer, fibroses and more particularly fibrosis of the kidney, fibrosis of the liver, fibrosis of the lung, fibrosis of the skin, also fibrosis of the central nervous system as well as that of the nose and fibrosis induced by chemotherapy, and other 30     therapeutic fields such as, for example, cephaleas including cephalea associated with hypophyseal tumors, pain, panic attacks, chemotherapy, cicatrization of wounds, renal insufficiency resulting from delayed development, obesity and delayed development linked with obesity, delayed uterine development, dysplasia of the skeleton, Noonan's syndrome, sleep apnea syndrome, Graves' disease, polycystic disease of the ovaries, 35     pancreatic  pseudocysts  and  ascites,   leukemia,  meningioma,   cancerous   cachexia, inhibition of H pylori, psoriasis, as well as Alzheimer's disease.  Osteoporisis can also be mentioned.<br><br>
The Applicant found that the compounds of general formula (I) described hereafter have an affinity and a selectivity for the somatostatin receptors. As somatostatin and its peptide analogues often have a poor bioavailability by oral route and a low selectivity (Robinson, C, Drugs of the Future, 1994, 19, 992; Reubi, J.C. et al., TIPS, 1995, 16, 5 110), said compounds, non-peptide agonists or antagonists of somatostatin, can be advantageously used to treat pathological states or illnesses as presented above and in which one (or more) somatostatin receptors are involved. Preferably, said compounds can be used for the treatment of acromegalia, hypophyseal adenomas or endocrine gastroenteropancreatic tumors including carcinoid syndrome.<br>

PREPARATION OF THE COMPOUNDS OF THE INVENTION<br>
I) Preparation of q-bromoketones<br>
FIRST METHOD<br>
This method is inspired by the protocols described in the following publications: Macholan, L.; Skursky, L. Chem. Listy 1955, 49, 1385-1388; Bestman, H.J.; Seng, F. Chem. Ber. 1963, 96, 465-469; Jones, R.G.; Kornfeld, E.C.; McLaughlin, K.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1950, 72, 4526-4529; Nimgirawath, S.; Ritchie, E.; Taylor, W.C. Aust. J. Chem. 1973,25,183-193).<br><br>
A carboxylic acid is firstly converted to an acid by using oxalyl or thionyl chloride, or by activating it in the form of an anhydride using an alkyl chloroformate (for example isobutyl chloroformate, cf. Krantz, A.; Copp, L.J. Biochemistry 1991, 30, 4678-4687; or<br><br>
-48-<br>
ethyl chloroformate, cf. Podlech, J.; Seebach, D. Liebigs Ann. 1995, 1217-1228) in the presence of a base (triethylamine or N-methylmorpholine).<br>
The activated carboxyl group is then converted to diazoketone using diazomethane in an ethereal solution or a commercial solution of trimethylsilyldiazomethane (Aoyama, T.; Shiori, T. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1981, 29, 3249-3255) in an aprotic solvent such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran (THF) or acetonitrile.<br>
The bromination is then carried out using a bromination agent such as hydrobromic acid in acetic acid, aqueous hydrobromic acid in diethyl ether or dichloromethane.<br><br>

Preparation 1<br>
2-(4-bromo-3-oxobutyl)-lH-isoindole-l,3(2H)-dione (C12H10BrNO3, MM = 296.12):<br><br><br>
Oxalyl chloride (5.8 ml; 66.7 mmol) is added to Pht-p-Ala-OH (9.96g; 44.5 mmol) dissolved in dichloromethane (120ml) and 3 drops of dimethylformamide (DMF). The mixture is stirred for 3 hours at ambient temperature. After elimination of the solvent, the white solid is taken up in a 1:1 mixture of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran and acetonitrile (200 ml) then 49 ml of a 2M solution of (trimethylsilyl) diazomethane in hexane (97.9 mmol) are added dropwise at 0 Â°C. The solvents are eliminated after one night of stirring at 0 Â°C. The pale yellow solid is then dissolved in dichloromethane (60 ml) and 12 ml of aqueous hydrobromic acid (48%) is added dropwise at 0 Â°C. The mixture is stirred until the temperature reaches 15 Â°C and 50 ml of a saturated solution of sodium bicarbonate is added. The organic phase is washed with salt water then dried over sodium sulphate. Crystallization from diethyl ether allows a white solid to be obtained (11.39 g; yield = 86%).<br>

N-carbamate of 4-[({[(9H-fluoren-9-ylmethoxy)carbonyl]amino}acetyl)amino]butyl Wang resin<br><br>
The Fmoc-Gly-OH acid (2.36 g, 7.94 mmol) is activated with HOBt (1.07 g, 7.94 mmol) and of the DIC (1.25 ml, 7.94 mmol) in 22 ml of DMF for 5 minutes before adding the mixture to butylamine N-carbamate Wang resin (1 g, load rate of 0.794 mmol/g) preswollen in 10 ml of DMF. After stirring for 18 hours at ambient temperature, the resin is washed successively with DMF (5 x 20 ml) then with DCM (5 x 20 ml) before being dried under vacuum. 1.27 g of pale yellow resin is thus obtained presenting a negative Kaiser ninhydrin test.<br><br><br>

Preparation of the thiourea resins<br>
General procedure: a resin described above is deprotected with a 20% DMF/piperidine mixture. After stirring for one hour at ambient temperature, the resin is filtered and washed successively with DMF then with DCM. The deprotection/washing sequence is repeated a second time and the resin is dried under vacuum. The latter is preswollen in a solvent such as DMF or DCM then an aromatic or heteroaromatic isothiocyanate (5 to 10 eq.) is added. The mixture is stirred for 2 to 24 hours at ambient temperature before the resin is filtered and washed successively with DMF then with DCM. The resin is then dried under vacuum and a negative Kaiser ninhydrin test confirms that the substitution reaction is complete.<br>
Preparation 24<br>
4-[({[(l-naphthylamino)carbothioyl]amino}acetyl)amino]butyl N-carbamate Wang resin<br><br>
Ml g of the above resin (see Preparation 23) is deprotected with 14 ml of DMF/piperidine at 20%. The mixture is stirred for one hour at ambient temperature. The resin is then filtered then washed with DMF (5 x 30 ml) then with DCM (5x30 ml). The deprotection/washing sequence is repeated once before the resin is dried under vacuum. 0.781 g of pale yellow resin was thus obtained with a load rate of 0.758 mmol/g calculated after elemental analysis of the sulphur. 416 mg (2.2 mmol, 10 eq.) of 1-naphthylisothiocyanate diluted in 6 ml of DMF is added to 0.3 g (0.22 mmol) of this thiourea resin. The mixture is stirred for 18 hours at ambient temperature. The resin is filtered then washed successively with DMF (5 x 20 ml) then with DCM (5 x 20 ml). 310 mg of a pale resin yellow is isolated after drying under vacuum with a load rate of 0.66 mmol/g calculated after elemental analysis of the nitrogen.<br><br>

Synthesis of 2-arylimino-2,3-dihydrothiazoles<br><br>
General procedure: the regioselective cyclization stage is carried out in aprotic solvents such as dioxane, DMF or N-methylpyrrolidinone at 80 Â°C for 2 to 3 hours between the thiourea resin and the a-bromoketone (2 to 5 eq.). The resin is then washed successively with DMF, methanol and DCM then dried under reduced pressure. The 2-arylimino-2,3-dihydrothiazole resin is cleaved under acid conditions (DCM/trifluoroacetic acid at 50%) for 1 to 2 hours then rinsed with DCM. The solvent is evaporated off and the free base isolated after treatment under basic conditions (saturated solution of sodium hydrogen carbonate) followed by an extraction with DCM or elution with methanol in a basic alumina cartridge (500 mg, Interchim).<br>

80 mg (52.8 urnol, load rate of 0.66 mmol/g) of thiourea resin (Preparation 24) and 25.1 mg (105.6 mmol, 2 eq.) of 2-bromo-4'-chloroacetophenone are diluted in I ml of DMF. The mixture is heated at 80Â°C for 2 hours. The resin is filtered then washed with DMF (5 x 1 ml), methanol (5x1 ml) then DCM (5 x 1 ml) before being dried under vacuum.<br><br>
-93-<br>
1 ml of a 50% DCM/TFA mixture is added followed by stirring for 1 hour 30 minutes. The resin is filtered and rinsed with DCM. The filtrate is evaporated then rediluted in methanol for elution on basic alumina. 20.6 mg (yield of 84%; UV purity of 94.2 % at 220 nm) of yellow solid is thus isolated after evaporation corresponding to the free base.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF THE PRODUCTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The compounds of the present invention can and have been tested as regards their affinity for different sub-types of somatostatin receptors according to the procedures 5     described below.<br>
Study of the affinity for the sub-types of human somatostatin receptors:<br>
The affinity of a compound of the invention on sub-types of human somatostatin receptors  1  to 5  (ssti,  sst2,  sst3,  sst4 and sst5,  respectively) is determined by<br>
measurement of the inhibition of the bond of [125I-Tyr11]SRIF-14 to transfected CHO-10     Kl cells.<br>
The gene of the ssti receptor of human somatostatin has been cloned in the form of a genomic fragment. A segment Pstl-XmnI of 1.5 Kb containing 100 bp of the non transcribed 5' region, 1.17 Kb of the coding region in totality, and 230 bp of the non transcribed 3' region is modified by the addition of the linker BglII. The resulting 15 DNA fragment is subcloned in the BamHI site of a pCMV-81 in order to produce the expression plasmid in mammals (provided by Dr. Graeme Bell, Univ. Chicago). A cloned cell line expressing in a stable fashion the sst1  receptor is obtained by<br>
transfection in CHO-K1 cells (ATCC) using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method. The plasmid pRSV-neo (ATCC) is included as selection marker. Cloned cell 20     lines were selected in an RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.5 mg/ml of G418 (Gibco), followed by circular cloning and multiplication in culture.<br>
The gene of the sst2 receptor of human somatostatin , isolated in the form of a genomic fragment of DNA of 1.7 Kb BamHI-HindIII and subcloned in a plasmid vector pGEM3Z (Promega), was provided by Dr. G. Bell (Univ. of Chicago). The expression 25 vector of the mammalian cells is constructed by inserting the BamHI-HindII fragment of 1.7 Kb in endonuclease restriction sites compatible with the plasmid pCMV5. A cloned cell line is obtained by transfection in CHO-K1 cells using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method. The plasmid pRSV-neo is included as selection marker.<br><br>
-366-<br>
The sst3 receptor is isolated as a genomic fragment, and the complete coding sequence is contained in a BamHI/HindIII fragment of 2.4 Kb. The expression plasmid in mammals, pCMV-h3, is constructed by insertion of the Ncol-HindIII fragment of 2.0 Kb in the EcoRl site of the vector pCMV after modification of the terminations and 5     addition of EcoRl linkers.  A cloned cell line expressing in a stable fashion the sst3<br>
receptor is obtained by transfection in CHO-K1 cells (ATCC) by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method. The plasmid pRSV-neo (ATCC) is included as selection marker. Cloned cell lines were selected in an RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.5 mg/ml of G418 (Gibco), followed by circular cloning and multiplication in culture.<br>
10     The expression plasmid of the human sst4 receptor, pCMV-HX, was provided by Dr.<br>
Graeme Bell (Univ. Chicago). This vector contains the genomic fragment coding for the human sst4 receptor of 1.4 Kb Nhel-Nhel, 456 pb of the non transcribed 5' region,<br>
and 200 pb of the non transcribed 3' region, cloned in the XbaVEcoRl sites of PCMV-HX.  A cloned cell line expressing in a stable fashion the sstt receptor is obtained by<br>
15 transfection in CHO-K1 (ATCC) cells by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method. The plasmid pRSV-neo (ATCC) is included as selection marker. The cloned cell lines were selected in an RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.5 mg/ml of G418 (Gibco), followed by circular cloning and multiplication in culture.<br>
The gene corresponding to the human sst5 receptor, obtained by the PCR method using 20 a genomic X clone as probe, was provided by Dr. Graeme Bell (Univ. Chicago). The resulting PCR fragment of 1.2 Kb contains 21 base pairs of the non transcribed 5' region, the coding region in totality, and 55 pb of the non transcribed 3' region. The clone is inserted in an EcoRl site of the plasmid pBSSK(+). The insert is recovered in the form of a HindIII-XbaI fragment of 1.2 Kb for subcloning in an expression vector in 25 mammals, pCVM5. A cloned cell lines expressing in a stable fashion the sst5 receptor is obtained by transfection in CHO-K1 cells (ATCC) by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method. The plasmid pRSV-neo (ATCC) is included as selection marker. The cloned cell lines were selected in an RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.5 mg/ml of G418 (Gibco), followed by circular cloning and multiplication in culture.<br>
30 The CHO-K1 cells which express in a stable fashion the human sst receptors are cultured in an RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% of foetal calf serum and 0.4 mg/ml of geneticin. The cells are collected with EDTA at 0.5 mM and centrifuged at 500 g for approximately 5 minutes at approximately 4Â°C. The pellet is resuspended in Tris 50 mM at pH 7.4 and centrifuged twice at 500 g for approximately 5 minutes at<br>
35 approximately 4Â°C. The cells are lysed by sonication then centrifuged at 39000 g for approximately 10 minutes at 4Â°C. The pellet is resuspended in the same buffer and<br><br>
-367-<br>
	centrifuged at 50000 g for approximately 10 minutes at approximately 4Â°C and the cell<br>
membranes in the pellet obtained are stored at -80Â°C.<br>
The competitive inhibition experiments of the bond with [I25I-Tyr11]SRIF-14 are carried out in duplicate in 96-well polypropylene plates. The cell membranes (10 ug 5 protein/well) are incubated with [125I-Tyr11]SRIF-14 (0.05 nM) for approximately 60 min. at approximately 37 Â°C in a HEPES 50 mM buffer (pH 7.4) containing BSA 0.2%,      MgCl2      5mM,      Trasylol      200KIU/ml,      bacitricin      0.02mg/ml,<br>
phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride 0.02 mg/ml.<br>
The bound [,25I-Tyr12]SRIF-14 is separated from the free [125I-Tyr11]SRIF-14 by 10 immediate filtration through GF/C glass fibre filter plates (Unifilter, Packard) pre-impregnated with 0.1 % of polyethylenimine (P.E.I.), using a Filtermate 196 (Packard). The filters are washed with 50 mM HEPES buffer at approximately 0-4 Â°C for approximately 4 seconds and their radioactivity is determined using a counter (Packard Top Count).<br>
15 The specific bond is obtained by subtracting the non-specific bond (determined in the presence of 0.1 uM of SRIF-14) from the total bond. The data relative to the bond are analyzed by computer-aided non-linear regression analysis (MDL) and the values of the inhibition constants (Ki) are determined.<br>
Determination of the agonist or antagonist character of a compound of the present 20     invention is carried out using the test described below.<br><br>
-368-<br>
Functional test: Inhibition of production of intracellular cAMP:<br>
CH0-K1 cells expressing the sub-types of human somatostatin receptors (SRIF-14) are cultured in 24-well plates in an RPMI 1640 medium with 10% of foetal calf serum and 0.4 mg/ml of geneticin. The medium is changed the day preceding the experiment.<br>
5 The cells at a rate of 10 cells/well are washed twice with 0.5 ml of new RPMI medium comprising 0.2 % BSA completed by 0.5 mM of 3-isobutyl-l-methylxanthine (IBMX) and incubated for approximately 5 min at approximately 37 Â°C.<br>
The production of cyclic AMP is stimulated by the addition of 1 mM of forskolin (FSK) for 15-30 minutes at approximately 37 Â°C.<br>
10	The inhibitor effect of the somatostatin of an agonist compound is<br>
measured by the simultaneous addition of FSK (luM) , SRIF-14 (10"12 M to 10"6 M) and of the compound to be tested (10'10 M to 10"5 M).<br>
The antagonist effect of a compound is measured by the simultaneous addition of FSK (luM), SRIF-14 (1 to 10 nM) and of the compound to be tested (10'10 15     Mtol0-5M).<br>
The reaction medium is eliminated and 200 ml of 0.1 N HCl are added. The quantity of cAMP is measured by a radioimmunological test (FlashPlate SMP001A kit, New England Nuclear).<br>
Results:<br>
20 The tests carried out according to the protocols described above have demonstrated that the products of general formula (I) defined in the present Application have a good affinity for at least one of the sub-types of somatostatin receptors, the inhibition constant K; being lower than micromolar for certain exemplified compounds, and in particular for the products shown in the table below.<br><br>
