Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000306<br>
A HUMIDITY BASED CONTROL SYSTEM FOR<br>
AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/842,512, filed on September 5, 2006. The disclosure of the<br>
above application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002] The present disclosure relates to an internal combustion engine,<br>
and more particularly to method to control spark timing and exhaust dilution to<br>
improve fuel economy and drivability.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] Efficiency of an internal combustion engine may be controlled<br>
by adjusting spark timing and an exhaust dilution that is combusted by the<br>
engine. Spark timing may be defined as generating a spark at a specific time<br>
relative to a position of a piston in a combustion chamber. A preferred spark<br>
timing occurs when the engine has a maximum output power. Output power is<br>
directly proportional to pressure within a combustion chamber of the engine. To<br>
obtain maximum pressure in the combustion chamber, the spark ignites the<br>
air/fuel mixture at a time before the piston is at top dead center permitting heated<br>
gases time to fully expand as the piston reaches top dead center.<br>
1<br><br>
General Motors No. GP-306198<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000306<br>
[0004] The engine system may also dilute the air/fuel mixture to<br>
improve engine efficiency. Exhaust dilution may improve engine efficiency by<br>
reducing pumping losses. When exhaust gases are introduced during an intake<br>
stroke of a combustion event, the engine requires less air thereby reducing<br>
pumping power losses of the engine. An engine control system may use an<br>
exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system to re-circulate exhaust gases back into<br>
the intake manifold. In addition, a set of cam phasers may be used to control<br>
valve timing in order to retain exhaust gases in the combustion chamber.<br>
[0005] Optimal spark timing and dilution values of the engine are<br>
typically determined experimentally in a single set of air conditions. However,<br>
engines may not always operate in the same set conditions due to geographic<br>
location, seasonal changes, and/or other circumstances. When engine<br>
performance is not optimized, the engine system may experience reduced fuel<br>
economy and sluggish engine output.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0006] A humidity based control system for an internal combustion<br>
engine according to the present disclosure includes a calculation module and a<br>
calibration module. The calculation module determines a humidity of air used in<br>
a combustion process of the internal combustion engine. The calibration module<br>
selectively controls spark timing of the internal combustion engine based on the<br>
humidity.<br>
2<br><br>
General Motors No. GP-306198<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000306<br>
[0007] In other features, the calibration module selectively controls<br>
exhaust gas recirculation in the internal combustion engine based on the<br>
humidity. When the humidity is increasing, the calibration module increases the<br>
spark timing and decreases the exhaust gas recirculation. When the humidity is<br>
decreasing, the calibration module decreases the spark timing and increases the<br>
exhaust gas recirculation. The exhaust gas recirculation is controlled with an<br>
exhaust gas recirculation valve and/or a cam phaser.<br>
[0008] In still other features, the calculation module includes a water<br>
vapor pressure module, a partial pressure module, and a humidity module. The<br>
water vapor pressure module generates a water vapor pressure signal based on<br>
an air intake temperature signal and a barometric pressure signal. The partial<br>
pressure module generates a partial pressure signal based on a relative humidity<br>
signal and the water vapor pressure signal. The humidity module calculates the<br>
humidity based on the partial pressure signal and the barometric pressure signal.<br>
[0009] Further areas of applicability of the present disclosure will<br>
become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be<br>
understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating<br>
the preferred embodiment of the disclosure, are intended for purposes of<br>
illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the disclosure.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0010] The present disclosure will become more fully understood from<br>
the detailed description and the accompanying drawings, wherein:<br>
3<br><br>
General Motors No. GP-306198<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000306<br>
[0011] FIG. 1 is a functional block diagram of an exemplary engine<br>
system using a humidity based control system according to the present<br>
disclosure;<br>
[0012] FIG. 2 is a functional block diagram of the humidity based<br>
control system according to the present disclosure; and<br>
[0013] FIG. 3 is a flow chart illustrating exemplary steps taken by the<br>
humidity based control system to adjust spark timing and exhaust dilution<br>
according to the present disclosure.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0014] The following description of the preferred embodiment(s) is<br>
merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the disclosure, its<br>
application, or uses. As used herein, the term module or device refers to an<br>
application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a processor<br>
(shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that executes one or more software or<br>
firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit, and/or other suitable<br>
components that provide the described functionality.<br>
[0015] According to the present disclosure, a humidity based control<br>
system compensates for atmospheric conditions during engine operation. More<br>
specifically, the humidity based control system determines a humidity level based<br>
on various sensors and adjusts spark timing and dilution of an air/fuel mixture<br>
based on the humidity level.<br>

General Motors No. GP-306198<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000306<br>
[0016] Referring now to FIG. 1, a functional block diagram of an engine<br>
system 100 includes an engine 102 that combusts an air/ fuel mixture to produce<br>
drive torque. Air is drawn into an intake manifold 104 through a throttle 106. The<br>
throttle 106 regulates air flow into the intake manifold 104. Air within the intake<br>
manifold 104 is distributed into a cylinder 110. Although four cylinders are<br>
illustrated, it can be appreciated that the engine 102 may include additional or<br>
fewer cylinders 110. For example, engines having 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 and 12<br>
cylinders are contemplated.<br>
[0017] A fuel injector (not shown) injects fuel which is combined with air<br>
as it is drawn into the cylinder 110. A fuel injection system (not shown) provides<br>
a desired air-to-fuel ratio within each cylinder 110. An intake valve 114<br>
selectively opens and closes to enable the air/fuel mixture to enter the cylinder<br>
110. The intake valve position is regulated by an intake cam shaft 116. A piston<br>
(not shown) compresses the air/fuel mixture within the cylinder 110. A spark plug<br>
118 initiates combustion of the air/fuel mixture driving the piston in the cylinder<br>
110. The piston drives a crankshaft (not shown) to produce drive torque. The<br>
crankshaft rotatably drives camshafts 116,120 using a timing chain (not shown)<br>
to regulate the timing of intake and exhaust valves 114, 121. Although a single<br>
intake camshaft and a single exhaust camshaft are shown, it is appreciated that<br>
dual intake camshafts and dual exhaust camshafts may be used in a v-type<br>
cylinder configuration. Likewise, electro-hydrolic valve actuation, or other valve<br>
systems.<br>
5<br><br>
General Motors No. GP-306198<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000306<br>
[0018] Exhaust gases within the cylinder 110 are forced out of an<br>
outlet (not shown) when the exhaust valve 121 is in an open position. The<br>
exhaust valve position is regulated by the exhaust cam shaft 120. The exhaust<br>
gases are released into the atmosphere through an exhaust 124.<br>
[0019] The engine 102 may include an intake cam phaser 128 and an<br>
exhaust cam phaser 130 that regulate rotational timing of the intake and exhaust<br>
cam shafts 116,120, respectively. More specifically, a phase angle of the intake<br>
and exhaust cam phasers 128, 130 may be retarded or advanced to control<br>
rotational timing of the input and output cam shafts 116, 120. By controlling<br>
rotational timing of the cam shafts 116,120 the amount of exhaust gases retained<br>
in the cylinder can be regulated.<br>
[0020] The engine system 100 may include an exhaust gas<br>
recirculation (EGR) valve 132. The EGR valve 132 selectively opens and closes<br>
to regulate a flow of exhaust gases back into the intake manifold 104.<br>
Introducing exhaust gases into an intake stroke of the combustion event tends to<br>
limit the amount of oxygen available for combustion. Limiting the oxygen<br>
available for combustion lowers combustion temperatures and reduces engine<br>
emissions. When the EGR valve 132 is optimized with spark timing, fuel<br>
economy and/or performance may be improved.<br>
[0021] An intake air temperature sensor 136 is responsive to intake air<br>
temperature and generates an intake air temperature signal 138 based thereon.<br>
A barometric pressure sensor 148 is responsive to atmospheric pressure and<br>
generates a barometric pressure signal 150 based thereon. A relative humidity<br>
6<br><br>
General Motors No. GP-306198<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000306<br>
sensor 154 is responsive to an amount of water that air can hold based on<br>
temperature and generates a relative humidity signal 155 based thereon. A<br>
humidity based control system 134 controls engine 102 operation based on the<br>
intake air temperature signal 138, the barometric pressure signal 150, and the<br>
relative humidity signal.<br>
[0022] Referring now to FIG. 2, the humidity based control system 134<br>
includes a calculation module 170 and a control module 172. The calculation<br>
module 170 determines a humidity based on the intake air temperature signal<br>
138, the barometric pressure signal 150, and the relative humidity signal 155.<br>
The control module 172 determines whether the humidity has increased or<br>
decreased since a previous cycle and generates a control signal to adjust spark<br>
timing and/or dilution of the air/fuel mixture.<br>
[0023] The calculation module 170 may include a saturation water<br>
vapor pressure module 174, a partial pressure module 176, and a humidity<br>
module 178. The saturation water vapor pressure module 174 determines a<br>
saturation water vapor pressure value based on the intake air temperature signal<br>
138 and the barometric pressure signal 150. More specifically, the saturation<br>
water vapor pressure value may be determined using the following formula:<br><br>
where es is the saturation water vapor pressure value, p is the barometric<br>
pressure, and T is intake air temperature. The saturation water vapor pressure<br>
module 174 generates a water vapor pressure signal 175 based on the<br>
saturation water vapor pressure value.<br>
7<br><br>
General Motors No. GP-306198<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000306<br>
[0024] The partial pressure module 176 determines a partial pressure<br>
of water vapor value based on the relative humidity signal 155 and the water<br>
vapor pressure signal 175. More specifically, the partial pressure of water vapor<br>
value may be determined using the following formula:<br><br>
where e is the partial pressure of water vapor value,  is relative humidity, and<br>
es is the saturation water vapor pressure value. The partial pressure module 176<br>
generates a partial pressure signal 177 based on the partial pressure of water<br>
vapor value.<br>
[0025] The humidity module 178 determines the humidity based on the<br>
partial pressure signal 177 and the barometric pressure signal 150. More<br>
specifically, the humidity may be determined using the following formula:<br><br>
where h is the humidity, p is the barometric pressure, and e is the partial<br>
pressure of water vapor value. The humidity module 178 generates a humidity<br>
signal 179 based on the humidity. The control module 172 generates the control<br>
signal to adjust spark timing and/or dilution of the air/fuel mixture based on the<br>
humidity signal 179.<br>
[0026] Referring now to FIG. 3, exemplary steps of the humidity based<br>
control system 134 are generally identified at 300. The process begins in step<br>
305 when the engine 102 is turned on. In step 310, the calculation module 170<br>
8<br><br>
General Motors No. GP-306198<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000306<br>
determines the humidity. In step 320, the calibration module 172 determines<br>
whether the humidity is increasing or decreasing. More specifically, the<br>
calibration module compares the humidity to a previous humidity calculated<br>
during the previous cycle. If the humidity is increasing, the spark timing is<br>
advanced in step 330. In step 340, the humidity based control system 134<br>
decreases dilution of the air/fuel mixture using the EGR valve 132 and/or the cam<br>
phasers 128,130. In step 350, the humidity based control system 134<br>
determines whether the engine 102 is running. If the engine is running, the<br>
process returns to step 310. If the engine 102 is not running, the process ends in<br>
step 360.<br>
[0027] If the calibration module 170 determines that the humidity is<br>
decreasing in step 320, spark timing is retarded in step 370 to allow correct<br>
combustion phasing. In step 380, the humidity based control system 134<br>
increases dilution of the air/fuel mixture using the EGR valve 132 and/or the cam<br>
phasers 128,130 and proceeds to step 350. Thus, when less moisture is in the<br>
air, more exhaust gases are introduced to dilute the air/fuel mixture.<br>
[0028] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the foregoing<br>
description that the broad teachings of the present disclosure can be<br>
implemented in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this disclosure has been<br>
described in connection with particular examples thereof, the true scope of the<br>
disclosure should not be so limited since other modifications will become<br>
