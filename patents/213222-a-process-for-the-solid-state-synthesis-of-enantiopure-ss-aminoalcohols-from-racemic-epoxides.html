				<td>A PROCESS FOR THE SOLID STATE SYNTHESIS OF ENANTIOPURE β-AMINOALCOHOLS FROM RACEMIC EPOXIDES<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the solid state synthesis of enantiopure P-aminoalcohols from racemic epoxides. More particularly, the present invention relates to a process for the solid state synthesis of enantiopure p-aminoalcohols from racemic epoxides by the dynamic kinetic resolution involving enantiodifferentiating racemisation in crystalline cyclodextrin complexes.<br>
The novel phenomenon of converting racemic substrates to enantiopure products is illustrated by the synthesis of enantiopure P-aminoalcohols by dynamic kinetic resolution involving chiral cyclodextrins by supramolecular catalysis under solid state conditions.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Dynamic kinetic resolution involves the conversion of racemic substrate into a single stereoisomer of the product by inter-conversion of the reactant isomers by racemisation, making removal of one of the isomers as the rate determining step. Dynamic kinetic resolution also overcomes the limitation of conventional kinetic resolution where the maximum yield of one stereoisomer of the starting material or product is only 50 %. Dynamic kinetic resolution, though of great significance in asymmetric synthesis to get a single enantiomer of the product from racemic substrate, is not a widespread phenomenon. Only a few cases have been reported so far (R. S. Ward, Tetrahedron Asymmetry, 1996, 1475). However, in these cases the substrates involved are made chirally labile either chemically, biochemically or thermally. There is also a<br><br>
stray reference by F. Toda and K. Tanaka in Chem. Lett., 1983, 661, of converting racemic cyanohydrin into a single enantiomer by complexation with brucine. However, there has been no attempt so far to involve chirally stable racemic epoxides by any means in dynamic kinetic resolution by reaction with amines for obtaining enantiopure β-aminoalcohols that have a high potential as intermediates for the synthesis of wide range of biologically active compounds and as precursors in asymmetric transformations. Until now dynamic kinetic resolution has not been carried out by supramolecular catalysis involving cyclodextrins.<br>
Accordingly, studies were undertaken to see the possibility of involving chirally stable, easily accessible and inexpensive racemic epoxides for the synthesis of enantiopure P-aminoalcohols by dynamic kinetic resolution through supramolecular catalysis in cyclodextrins.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
The main object of the invention is to provide a process for the synthesis of enantiopure P-aminoalcohols from racemic epoxides by creating conditions for enantiodifferentiating racemisation in cyclodextrin complexes.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a process for the formation of enantiomerically pure products from racemic epoxides by dynamic kinetic resolution through supramolecular catalysis involving cyclodextrins by enantiodifferentiating racemisation since cyclodextrins are chiral and mimic enzymes.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a process for the solid state synthesis of enantiopure p-aminoalcohols that overcomes the limitations of kinetic resolution.<br><br>

a new process for the synthesis of enantiopure β-aminoalcohols from racemic epoxides<br>
by   dynamic kinetic  resolution    involving    enantiodifferentiating    racemisation in<br>
crystalline cyclodextrin complexes has been achieved for the first time under solid state conditions.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
Accordingly, the present investigation deals with a process for the solid state synthesis of enantiopure β-aminoalcohols of formula VI (as shown in Figure IV below) from racemic epoxides by dynamic kinetic resolution by dynamic kinetic resolution through supramolecular catalysis in cyclodextrin complexes.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
FORMULA VI<br>
FIGURE IV<br>
The synthesis of each compound is described hereinbelow in detail.<br>
The first step in the process comprises formation of an inclusion complex of aryloxyepoxides of the general formula 1 with cyclodextrins as shown above in Figure II.<br>
The cyclodextrins of the general formulae 1, 2 and 3 shown above in Figure I are cyclic oligosaccharides possessing hydrophobic cavities and mimic enzymes in their capability to bind substrates selectively and catalyse chemical reactions. They catalyse reactions by supramolecular catalysis involving reversible formation of Host: Guest complexes with substrates by non-covalent bonding as seen in enzymes. Since the cyclodextrin cavity is chiral in nature, it can induce asymmetric reactions. It can discriminate and form complexes with different enantiomers of racemates. The following criteria have to be fulfilled to ensure rigidity for chiral recognition by cyclodextrins:<br>
1.	A phenyl ring that can best fit into the cyclodextrin cavity to form an inclusion<br>
complex;<br>
2.	A functional group at the stereogenic center to form strong interaction with the<br>
secondary hydroxyl groups at the cyclodextrin cavity entrance.<br>
Aryloxyepoxides have been chosen as substrates for the formation of inclusion complexes with cyclodextrins. The inclusion complexes of arylepoxides with cyclodextrins are prepared by adding the epoxides in equimolar ratio in solvents such as methanol, ethanol, acetone and the like at temperatures varying between 30 to 80°C. The formation of inclusion complex of epoxide with cyclodextrin was determined by 'H -nmr spectroscopy. The reaction of the cyclodextrin complex of aryloxyepoxide with nucleophiles such as amines was carried out in solid state by intimately grinding the mixture using mortar and pestle, since this reaction in liquid state using water as the reaction medium yielded only racemic β-aminoalcohols of the general formulae 4 and 5 as shown in Figure II above. The reactions in solid state created conditions for<br>
racemisation and also led to better chiral recognition where the movement of the guest molecule is restricted. The reaction in solid state is carried out as shown in the reaction scheme (Figure II) above. An intimate mixture of the epoxide-1-cyclodextrin complex of the formula 1 with the amine of the formula 2' or 3' was mixed in an agate mortar using a pestle and the mixing continued until the starting epoxide disappeared on tic (3 -12hrs.). The time taken was always dependent on frequency of mixing. However, the amine of formula 2' was taken in excess due to its volatility and was added intermittently during the course of mixing. The excess amine was removed under vacuum and the aminoalcohol of formula 4 or 5 was extracted with solvents such as dichloromethane, chloroform, ethylacetate, methanol and the like. The yields obtained were more than 50 % and the enantioselectivity observed was excellent with an ee of upto 100 % in compounds 4b and 5b. The β-aminoalcohols obtained using p-cyclodextrin -aryloxyepoxide of formula 1 show higher enantioselectivity compared with a-cyclodextrin or γ-cyclodextrin-aryloxyepoxide (1) complex. Hence the reactions with the various amines 2' and 3' were carried out using β-cyclodextrin-aryloxyepoxide (1) complex. These aminoalcohols of formula 4 and 5 have been shown to have R configuration by comparison of the sign of optical rotation with those of known compounds as described in H. Takahashi, S. Sakuraba, H. Takeda and K. Achiwa J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990,112,5876.<br>
The mechanism for the formation of enantiopure P-aminoalcohols of the formula 4 and 5 from the racemic epoxides (1) may be postulated as follows:<br>
The fact that the epoxide (1) isolated from the cyclodextrin complex is racemic and the yields of the aminoalcohols 4 and 5 were more than 50 %, kinetic resolution is not operating under these conditions as then only a maximum of 50 % conversion can be<br>
expected. Hence, in the present invention, interconversion of one of the enantiomers of the epoxide 1 is required to get single enantiomer of the product as indicated below:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
This is possible through a process called racemisation that is controlled entirely by entropy effects as described in: 1. "Stereodifferentiating reactions, the nature of asymmetric reactions" by Y. Izumi and A. Tai, Academic Press, New York, 1977, 169 -177; 2. "Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds" , by E. L. Eliel and S. H. Wilen, John Wiley and Sons, Inc. , New York, 1994, 424 - 427. This can take place in the present case by the ring opening of the epoxide facilitated by the energy generated in the grinding process under the solid state conditions.<br>
When one of the enantiomeric forms of the epoxide 1 in p-cyclodextrin cavity due to its favourable geometry is captured selectively by the external amine 2 or 3, it leads to the formation of an enantiomerically pure aminoalcohol 4 or 5 starting from the racemic epoxide. Thus dynamic kinetic resolution is operating involving cyclodextrin under the reaction conditions leading to enantiomerically pure aminoalcohols (4 and 5). It has been shown for the first time that enantiopure β-aminoalcohols (4 and 5) of high potential can be formed from the easily accessible and inexpensive racemic epoxides 1 by dynamic kinetic resolution involving enantiodifferentiating racemisation through supramolecular catalysis in cyclodextrin complexes under solid state conditions.<br>
The process of the invention will now be described with reference to the following examples that are by way of illustration only and should not be considered as limiting the scope of the invention in any manner.<br>
The substrate - cyclodextrin complexes were made as described earlier (1. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun., 1989, 342 ; 2. Synth. Commun., 1993, 23, 1877). Enantiomeric excesses (ee) of the products p-aminoalcohols 4 and 5 were determined by chiral HPLC analysis. The conditions employed for chiral HPLC analysis were as follows. The analyses were carried out on HPLC Instrument Hewlett Packard HP 1090 with the chiral column 'Diacel chiralcel OD (0.46 cm <j> x 25 cm) using hexane : 2 -propanol : diethylamine (80 : 20 : 0.1) as eluent at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/minute, using UV detection (254 nm).
