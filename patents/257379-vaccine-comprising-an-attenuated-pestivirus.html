				<td>VACCINE COMPRISING AN ATTENUATED PESTTVIRUS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INDENTION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention lelates to the field of animal health and in particular to attenuated pestiviruses such as bovine viral diarrhea Tims (BVDV).<br>
BACKGROUND INFORMATION<br>
Pestiviruses are causative agents of economically important diseases of animals in many countries worldwide. Presently known virus isolates have been grouped into four different species which together form one genus within the family Flaviviridae.<br>
I/n Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) type 1 (BVDV-1) and type 2 (BVDV-2) cause bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) and mucosal disease (MD) in cattle (Baker, 1987; Moennig and Plagemann, 1992; ThieJ et al., 1996). The division of BVDV into 2 species is based on significant differences at the level of genomic sequences (summarized in Heinz et al., 2000) which are also obvious from limited cross neutralizing antibody reactions (Ridpath et al. 1994). in Classical swine fever virus (CSFV), formerly named hog cholera virus, is responsible for classical swine fever (CSF) or hog cholera (HC) (Moennig and Plagemann, 1992; Thiel et al., 1996).<br>
IV Border disease virus (BDV) is typically found in sheep and causes border disease (BD.). After intrauterine infection of lambs with BDV persistently infected lambs can be born that are weak and show different abnormalities among which the 'hairy shaker' syndrome is best known (Moennig and Plagemann, 1992; Thiel etal., 1996).<br>
Pestiviruses are small enveloped viruses with a single stranded RNA genome of positive polarity<br>
1      f<br>
lacking both 5' cap and 3' poly(A) sequences. The viral genome codes for a polyprotein of about 4000 amino acids giving rise to final cleavage products by co- and posttranslational processing involving cellular and viral proteases. The viral proteins are arranged in the polyprotein in the order NH2-Npra-C-Eras-El-E2-p7-NS2-NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5A-NS5B-COOH (Lindenbach and, Rice, 2001). Protein C (= core- or capsidprotein) and the glycoproteins Ems, El and E2 represent structural components of the pestivirus virion as demonstrated for CSFV (Thiel et al., 1991). This also holds true for BVDV. E2 and to a lesser extent Eros were found to be targets for antibody neutralization (Doais et al., 1988; Paton et al., 1992; van Rijn et al., 1993; Weiland et<br><br>
al., 1990,1992). E™* lacks a typical membrane anchor and is secreted in considerable amounts from the infected cells; this protein has been reported to exhibit RNase activity (Hulst et al., 1994; Schneider et al., 1993; Windisch et al, 1996). The function of this enzymatic activity for the viral life cycle is presently unknown. The enzymatic activity depends on the presence of two stretches of amino acids conserved between the pestivirus Ems and different known RNases of plant and fungal origin. Both of these conserved sequences contain a histidine residue (Schneider et al., 1993). Exchange of each of these residues against lysine in the E™* protein of a CSFV vaccine strain resulted in the destruction of RNase activity (Hulst et al., 1998). Introduction of these mutations into the genome of the CSFV vaccine strain did not influence viral viability or growth properties but led to a virus exhibiting a, cytopathogenic phenotype (Hulst et al., 1998). Similarly, Meyers et al. showed that an RNase negative variant of the virulent CSFV strain Alfort/Tubingen was fully viable. However, the respective virus mutant showed no cytopathogenic phenotype (Meyers et al., 1999).<br>
Npro represents the first protein encoded by the long open reading frame in the pestivirus RNA. Npro represents a nonstructural protein that has protease activity and cleaves itself of the nascent polyprotein (Stark et al., 1993; Wiskerchen et al., 1991) presumably already during translation. Npro is a cysteine protease (Rtlmenapf et al., 1998) that is not essential for virus replication (Tratschin et al., 1998). Recently, it was shown that Npro somehow interferes with the cellular antiviral defense so that it can be hypothesized to modulate the immune system within an infected host (Rilggli et al., 2003). Mayer and coworkers presented indications for an attenuation of CSFV in consequence of a deletion of the Npra gene (Mayer et al., 2004).<br>
Present BVDV vaccines for the prevention and treatment of BVDV infections still have drawbacks (Oirschot et al. 1999). Vaccines against the classical BVDV-1 provide only partial protection from BVDV-2 infection, and vaccinated dams may produce calves that are persistently infected with virulent BVDV-2 (Bolin et al., 1991, Ridpath et al., 1994). This problem is probably due to the great antigenic diversity between type 1 and type 2 strains which is most pronounced in the glycoprotein E2, the major antigen for virus neutralization (Tijssen et al., 1996). Most monoclonal antibodies against type 1 strains fail to bind to type 2 viruses (Ridpath et al., 1994).<br>
Vaccines comprising attenuated or killed viruses or viral proteins expressed in heterologous expression systems have been generated for CSFV and BVDV and are presently used. Killed<br><br>
vaccines (inactivated whole virus) or subunit vaccines (conventionally purified or heterologously expressed viral proteins) are most often inferior to live vaccines in their efficacy to produce a full protective immune response even in the presence of adjuvants.<br>
The structural basis of the attenuation of BVDV used as life vaccines is not known. These vaccines, although attenuated, are most often associated with safety problems. The vaccine viruses may cross the placenta of pregnant animals, e.g. cows and lead to clinical manifestations in the fetus and/or the induction of persistently infected calves. Therefore, they cannot be applied to breeding herds that contain pregnant cows. Pregnant cows have to be kept separate from vaccinated cattle to protect fetuses and must not be vaccinated themselves. Furthermore, revertants of attenuated live BVDV pose a serious threat to animals. For conventionally derived attenuated viruses wherein the attenuation is achieved by conventional multiple passaging, the molecular origin as well as the genetic stability of the attenuation remains unknown and reversion to the virulent wild-type is unpredictable.<br>
Because of the importance of an effective and safe as well as detectable prophylaxis and treatment of pestiviral infections, there is a strong need for improved attenuated pestiviruses, such as BVDV, with a high potential for induction of immunity as well as a defined basis of attenuation which can also be distinguished from pathogenic pestiviruses, such as BVDV, as well as compositions and vaccines comprising said attenuated pesitiviruses, such as BVDV.<br>
Therefore, the technical problem underlying the present invention is to provide improved attenuated pestivirus, referably an attenuated BVDV for use as live attenuated vaccines. Such improved attenuated pestivirus, preferably BVDV, should especially (i) not cross the placenta themselves and (ii) induce an immunity that prevents viral transmission across the placenta and thereby prevents pregnancy problems like abortion of the fetus or birth of persistently infected host such calves in the case of BVDV infection.<br>

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to attenuated pestivivirus, preferably to attenuated BVDV, wherein at least one mutation is in the coding sequence for glycoprotein Eras and at least another mutation in the coding sequence for Npro which preferably leads to combined inactivation of the RNase activity residing in glycoprotein Ems in addition to the inactivation of the (hypothesized) immunemodulating activity residing in Npro. The invention also relates to methods for attenuating pestivirus in such that the attenuation results in an attenuated pestivirus, preferably in an attenuated BVDV, as described above. The present invention furthermore relates to nucleic acids molecules encoding said attenuated pestiviruses, preferably encoding attenuated BVDV, compositions and vaccines comprising the attenuated pestivirus, preferably BVDV as disclosed herein.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
DEFINITIONS OF TERMS USED IN THE DESCRIPTION:<br>
Before the embodiments of the present invention it must be noted that as used herein and in the appended claims, the singular forms "a", "an", and "the" include plural reference unless the<br><br>
context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to "a BVDV" includes a plurality of such BVDV, reference to the "cell" is a reference to one or more cells and equivalents thereof known to those skilled in the art, and so forth. Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meanings as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. Although any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present invention, the preferred methods, devices, and materials are now described. All publications mentioned herein are incorporated herein by reference for the purpose of describing and disclosing the cell lines, vectors, and methodologies as reported in the publications which might be used in connection with the invention. Nothing herein is to be construed as an admission that the invention is not entitled to antedate such disclosure by virtue of prior invention.<br>
The term "pestivirus" as used herein refers to all members of the genus Pestivirus, including BVDV, CSFV and BDV, within the family Flaviviridae.<br>
The term "CSFV" as used herein refers to all viruses belonging to species of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) in the genus Pestivirus within the family Flaviviridae.<br>
The term "BVDV" as used herein refers to all viruses belonging to species bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) type 1 (BVDV-1) and BVDV type 2 (BVDV-2) in the genus Pestivirus within' the family Flaviviridae (Heinz et al., 2000). The more classical BVDV type 1 strains and the more recently recognized BVDV type 2 strains display some limited but distinctive differences in nucleotide and amino acid sequences.<br>
The term "Npro" as understood herein relates to the first protein encoded by the viral open reading frame and cleaves itself from the rest of the synthesized polyprotein (Stark, et al., J. Virol. 67:7088-7093 (1993); Wiskerchen, et al., Virol. 65:4508-4514 (1991)). Said term, depending on the context, may also relate to the remaining "Npro" amino acids after mutation of the encoding nucleotide sequence or to the coding nucleotide sequence for said protein itself. "Protease activity residing in Npro" relates to the polypeptide cleavage activity of said "Npro".<br>
" E™8" as used herein relates to the glycoprotein E™5 which represents a structural component of the pestivirus virion (Thiel et al., 1991). Eras lacks a typical membrane anchor and is secreted in considerable amounts from the infected cells; this protein has been reported to exhibit RNase<br><br>
activity (Hulst et al., 1994; Schneider et al., 1993; Windisch et al., 1996). It should be noted that the term glycoprotein EO is often used synonymously to glycoprotein E"" in publications. Said term, depending on the context, may also relate to the mutated "Eras" protein after mutation of the encoding nucleotide sequence or to the coding nucleotide sequence for said protein itself. "RNase activity residing in glycoprotein Ems" relates to the RNA cleavage activity of said glycoprotein, i.e. the ability of the glycoprotein Ems to hydrolyze RNA. The term "inactivation of the RNase activity residing in said glycoprotein" refers to the inability or reduced capability of a modified glycoprotein Ems to hydrolyze RNA as compared to the unmodified wild type of said glycoprotein Ems.<br>
Attenuation: "An attenuated pestivirus or BVDV particle" as used herein means that there is a statistically significant difference between the virulence of attenuated pestivirus or BVDV particles of the present invention, wherein said attenuated viral particles being attenuated by a method described herein, and wild-type pestivirus or BVDV isolates from which said attenuated pestivirus or BVDV particles have been derived, for the predominant clinical parameters, in case of BVDV for diarrhea, pyrexia and lethality in animals infected with the same dose, preferably dxlO^CIDso. Thus, said attenuated BVDV particles do not cause diarrhea, pyrexia and lethality and thus may be used in a vaccine.<br>
Inactivation of Eras as used herein means RNase activity not significantly above the level measured for noninfected control cells in an RNase assay as described in Meyers et al., 1999. "Not significantly above the level measured for noninfected control cells in an RNase assay as described in Meyers et al., 1999, means for example, that the RNase activity is less than 150% compared to the noninfected control cells.<br>
Inactivation of Npro as used herein means the prevention or considerable reduction of the probable immunemodulating activity of Npro by mutation. In a preferred embodiment this mutation prevents or considerably reduces the interference of Npro with the induction of an interferon response by the infected cells as described by Rtlggli et al., (2003). In this case, the inactivation of Npra would allow the cell to mount a normal interferon response.<br>
"Processing signal" as used herein relates to a substance that ensures the generation of a functional N-terminal of the C protein of the pestivirus, preferably of BVDV, in particular a substance selected from the group of ubiquitin, LC3, SUMO-1, NEDD8, GATE-16 and<br><br>
GABA(A)RAP. Also proteases selected from the group of Mem, picornavirus 3C, caridovirus 2A and p!5 of rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus are understood as "processing signals" as used herein. Any other similar processing signal known to the skilled person that ensures the generation of a functional N-terminal of the C protein shall also be comprised in the term "processing signal".<br>
"Protein C" or "C protein" or "C-protein" as used herein relates to a structural component of the pestivirus virion (Thiel et al., 1991). "Protein C" is the capsid or core protein of pestiviruses. Said term, depending on the context, may also relate to the "Protein C" with one or several amino acids exchanges resulting from mutation of the encoding nucleotide sequence.<br>
A ,,fragment" according to the invention is any subunit of a polynucleotide molecule according to the invention, i.e. any subset. For DNA, said fragment is characterized in that it is shorter than the DNA covering the full length viral genome.<br>
A ..functional variant" of the nucleotide molecule according to the invention is a nucleotide molecule which possesses a biological activity (either .functional or structural) that is substantially similar to the nucleotide molecule according to the invention. The term ..functional variant" also includes ,,a fragment", ,,a functional variant", ..variant based on the degenerative; nucleic acid code" or ..chemical derivative". Such a ..functional variant" e.g. may carry one or several nucleotide exchanges, deletions or insertions. Said functional variant at least partially retains its biological activity, e.g. function as an infectious clone or a vaccine strain, or even exhibits improved biological activity. "Possess a biological activity that is substantially similar" means with respect to the pestiviruses provided herewith, for example, that said pestivirus is attenuated in a manner described herein and result in an non-pathogenic virus suitable for the production of live attenuated virus, which loss ability to pass the placenta but mediates an immune response after vaccination.<br>
A ..variant based on the degenerative nature of the genetic code" is a variant resulting from the fact that a certain amino acid may be encoded by several different nucleotide triplets. Said variant at least partially retains its biological activity, or even exhibits improved biological activity.<br><br>
A molecule is ..substantially similar" to another molecule if both molecules have substantially similar nucleotide sequences or biological activity. Thus, provided that two molecules possess a similar activity, they are considered variants as that term is used herein if the nucleotide sequence is not identical, and two molecules which have a similar nucleotide sequence are considered variants as that term is used herein even if their biological activity is not identical.<br>
A mutation as used herein relates to modifications in the nucleic acid molecules encoding the proteins / amino acids according to the invention. Said mutations relate to, but are not limited to, substitutions (replacement of one or several nucleotides/base pairs), deletions (removal of one or several nucleotides/base pairs), and/or insertions (addition of one or several nucleotides/base pairs). As used herein, mutation may be a single mutation or several mutations, therefore, often the term "mutation(s)" is used and relates to both a single mutation and several mutations. Said mutations include, but are not limited to point mutations (single nucleotide mutations) or larger mutations wherein e.g. parts of the encoding nucleic acid molecules are deleted, substituted and/or additional coding nucleic acid is inserted. Said mutations may result in a modified expressed polypeptide due to the change in the coding sequence. Such modified polypeptides are desired, as set out in the disclosure of the invention as set out below.<br>
The term "vaccine" as used herein refers to a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one immunologically active component that induces an immunological response in an animal and possibly but not necessarily one or more additional components that enhance the immunological activity of said active component. A vaccine may additionally comprise further components typical to pharmaceutical compostions. The immunologically active component of a vaccine may comprise complete virus particles in either their original form or as attenuated particles in a so called modified live vaccine (MLV) or particles inactivated by appropriate methods in a so called killed vaccine (KV). In another form the immunologically active component of a vaccine may comprise appropriate elements of said organisms (subunit vaccines) whereby these elements are generated either by destroying the whole particle or the growth cultures containing such particles and optionally subsequent purification steps yielding the desired structure(s), or by synthetic processes including an appropriate manipulation by use of a suitable system based on, for example, bacteria, insects, mammalian or other species plus optionally subsequent isolation and purification procedures, or by induction of said synthetic processes in the animal needing a vaccine by direct incorporation of genetic material using suitable pharmaceutical compositions (polynucleotide vaccination). A vaccine may comprise one<br><br>
or simultaneously more than one of the elements described above. The term "vaccine" as understood herein is a vaccine for veterinary use comprising antigenic substances and is administered for the purpose of inducing a specific and active immunity against a disease provoked by a pestivirus infection, preferably by a BVDV infection. The attenuated pestivirus, in particular the attenuated BVDV as described herein, confer active immunity that may be transferred passively via maternal antibodies against the immunogens it contains and sometimes also against antigenically related organisms. A vaccine of the invention refers to a vaccine as defined above, wherein one immunologically active component is a BVDV or of pestiviral origin or derived from a nucleotide sequence that is more than 70% homologous to any known pestivirus sequence (sense or antisense).<br>
The term "live vaccine" refers to a vaccine comprising a living, in particular, a living viral active component.<br>
Additional components to enhance the immune response are constituents commonly referred to as "adjuvants", like e.g. aluminiumhydroxide, mineral or other oils or ancillary molecules added. to the vaccine or generated by the body after the respective induction by such additional components, like but not restricted to ihterferons, interleukins or growth factors.<br>
A "pharmaceutical composition" essentially consists of one or more ingredients capable of modifying physiological e.g. immunological functions of the organism it is administered to, or of organisms living in or on the organism. The term includes, but is not restricted to, antibiotics or antiparasitics, as well as other constituents commonly used to achieve certain other objectives like, but not limited to, processing traits, sterility, stability, feasibility to administer the composition via enteral or parenteral routes such as oral, intranasal, intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intradermal or other suitable route, tolerance after administration, controlled release properties. One non-limiting example of such a pharmaceutical composition, solely given for demonstration purposes, could be prepared as follows: Cell culture supernatant of an infected cell culture is mixed with a stabilizer (e.g. spermidine and/or BSA (bovine serum albumin)) and the mixture is subsequently lyophilized or dehydrated by other methods. Prior to vaccination, said mixture is then rehydrated in aqueous (e.g. saline, PBS (phosphate buffered saline)) or non-aqueous solutions (e.g. oil emulsion, aluminum-based adjuvant).<br><br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The solution to the above technical problem is achieved by the description and the embodiments characterized in the claims.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that pestiviruses, in particular BVDV can be more effectively attenuated by introducing at least one mutation in the coding sequence for glycoprotein Ems and at least another mutation in the coding sequence for Npro which preferably leads to combined inactivation of the RNase activity residing in glycoprotein E"15 in addition to the inactivation of the immunomodulating activity residing in Npro. An immunomodulating effect in one aspect is indicated but not limited to the indicated function for one pestivirus in an exemplary manner by Rilggli et al. (2003).<br>
A pestivirus, in particular BVDV attenuated in accordance with the present invention may be advantageously used in vaccines. Said attenuated pestivirus, in particular said attenuated BVDV now provide live vaccines of high immunogenicity. Surprisingly, the pestivirus, in particular the BVDV according to the invention furthermore are safe for use in pregnant animals as they do not cross the placenta. This is exemplified in a non-limiting manner for BVDV in example 3.<br>
Furthermore, live vaccines with defined mutations as a basis for attenuation will allow to avoid the disadvantages of the present generation of vaccines, e.g. the risk of reversion to an mor pathogenic strain. A further advantage of said attenuating mutations lies'in their molecular uniqueness which allows to use them as distinctive labels for an attenuated pestivirus, in particular BVDV and to distinguish them from pestivirus, in particular BVDV from the field. Therefore, in one aspect the present invention provides an attenuated pestivirus, in particular an attenuated BVDV having at least one mutation in the coding sequence for glycoprotein E™ and at least another mutation in the coding sequence for Npro. Preferably, in such attenuated pestivirus, preferably in such attenuated BVDV said mutation in the coding sequence for glycoprotein E™8 leads to inactivation of the RNase activity residing in E1"8 and/or said mutation in the coding sequence for Npro leads to inactivation of said Npro. Said inactivation may take place by any mutation known to the person skilled in the art of the Ems- and the Npro-coding sequence, wherein the mutations are any mutation as defined in the "definitions" section, such as deletions, insertion mutations and/or substitution mutations. Most preferably, the mutation(s) are deletions, as the likelihood for revertation to the wild type is the lowest for deletions.<br><br>
It has been shown that the glycoprotein Eras forms a disulfide-bonded homodimer of about 97<br>
kD, wherein each monomer consists of 227 amino acids corresponding to the amino acids 268 to<br>
494 of the CSFV polyprotein as described by Rilmenapf et al. (1993). The genome sequence of<br>
the Alfort/Tubingen strain of CSFV is available in the GenBank/EMBL data library under<br>
accession number J04358; alternatively, the amino acid sequence for the BVDV strain CP7 can<br>
be accessed in the GenBank/EMBL data library (accession number U63479); in the BVDV CP7<br>
polyprotein, the Ems protein corresponds to residues 271 to 497. Two regions of amino acids are<br>
highly conserved in glycoprotein Eras as well as in some plant and fungal RNase-active proteins<br>
(Schneider et al., 1993). These two regions are of particular importance to the RNase enzymatic<br>
activity. The first region consists of the region at the amino acids at position 295 to 307 (298 to<br>
310 for BVDV strain cp7) and the second region consists of the amino acids at position 338 to<br>
357 (341 to 360 for BVDV strain cp7) of said viral polyprotein as exemplified for the Alfort<br>
strain of CSFV in Meyers et al., 1999 (numbering according to the published deduced amino<br>
acid sequence of CSFV strain Alfort/Tilbingen (Meyers et al., 1989). The amino acids of<br>
particular importance to the RNase activity as mentioned above are by no means limited to the<br>
exact position as defined for the Alfort/Tubingen strain of CSFV but are simply used in an<br>
exemplary manner to point out the preferred amino acids being at that position or corresponding<br>
to that position in other strains such as found in BVDV, BDV and pestiviruses in general since<br>
they are highly conserved. For pestiviruses other than the CSFV Alfort/Tubingen strain the<br>
numbering of the positions of the preferred amino acids can be different but an expert in the field<br>
of the molecular biology of pestiviruses will easily identify these preferred amino acids by the<br>
high degree of conservation of this amino acid sequence and the position of these motifs in the<br>
sequence context. In one particular non-limiting example, the position of CSFV Alfort/TUbingen<br>
346 is identical to position 349 of BVDV strain cp7.<br>
As a consequence, the present invention preferably relates to a BVDV according to the invention, wherein said mutation(s) in the coding sequence for glycoprotein Ems are located in the encoding nucleotide sequence corresponding to amino acids at position 298 to 310 and/or position 341 to 360. Preferably, such mutations are (amino acids are given in the one letter symbols; the amino acid before the position number indicates the amino acid to be substituted, the amino acid after the position number the substituting amino acid (del indicates deletion): for example, H300L means histidine 300 was substituted by leucine:<br><br>
Suitable modification of the glycoprotein Ems are for example, the single substitutions/deletions: S298G, H300K, H300L, H300R, HSOOdel, W303G, P304del, E305A, C308G, R343G, E345del, W346G, K348A, H349K, H349L, H349del, H349Q, H349SV (mutation H349S and insertion of V), K348R, W351P, W351G, W351L, W351K, W351H; the double substitutions/deletions: H300L/H349L, K348del/H349del, H349del/G350del, E345del/H349del, W303G/E305A, H300K/H349K, H300K/H349L and the triple deletions: L299del/H300del/G300del, K348del/H349del/G350del. Numbering is according to the published amino acid sequence of BVDV CP7 for all the mutants listed above (the given numbers minus 3 would correspond to the equivalent residues of the CSFV Alfort/Tubingen amino acid sequence). All the above-listed mutants were at least tested as respective CSFV or BVDV mutants without mutations in the Nproregion. Suitable mutants of the pestiviral glycoprotein Ems are provided, for example, by WO 99/64604, which is incorporated herein at its whole. It should be noted, however, that according to the present invention, at least one additional mutation in the Npro region, as disclosed in further detail below, must be present.<br>
It was particularly found that deletion or substitution of the histidine residue at position 346 (CSFV) or 349 (BVDV) leads to effective inactivation of Ems and therefore leads to particularly useful pestiviral live vaccines. The present invention demonstrates that pestiviruses are viable and code for an Eras protein without RNase activity when the histidine residue at position 346 of the viral polyprotein (numbering according to the published sequence of CSFV Alfort/Tubingen (Meyers et al., 1989)), or at position 349 (numbering according to the published sequence of BVDV CP7 (Meyers et al., 1996b)) if said pestivirus is BVDV, which represents one of the conserved putative active site residues of the Ems RNase, is deleted. Thus, preferably, the invention also relates to a BVDV according to the invention, wherein said mutation in the coding sequence for glycoprotein E™ is a deletion or substitution of the histidine residue at position 349. Even more specifically, the putative active site of the RNase is represented by the conserved Eras sequences SLHGIWPEKICTG and/or LQRHEWNKHGWCNWFHffiPW (sequence of the BVDV-2 New York'93 protein given here in an exemplary manner; minor changes can possibly be found in other pestivirus sequences but the identity of the motif will always be obvious for an expert in the field. As an example, the corresponding amino acid sequences of BVDV-1 CP7 would be SLHGIWPEKICTG and/or LQRHEWNKHGWCNWYNIEPW and that of CSFV Alfort/Tubingen    SLHGIWPEKICKG    and/or    LQRHEWNKHGWCNWYNIDPW).    Thus, preferably, the invention further relates to a BVDV according to the invention, wherein said mutation(s) in the coding sequence for glycoprotein Ems are located in the nucleotide sequence<br><br>

The sequences SLHGIWPEKIC and RHEWNKHGWCNW of the putative Eras active site are even more conserved across pestiviruses. Thus, preferably, the invention also relates to a pestivirus, in particular to BVDV having at least one mutation in the coding sequence of the Npro protein and the glycoprotein Ems, wherein said mutation(s) in the coding sequence for glycoprotein Ems are located in the nucleotide sequence coding for the conserved E™5 sequence SLHGIWPEKIC and/or RHEWNKHGWCNW. Preferably, the mutation is located in only one of said sequences. Thus the invention also relates to a pestivirus, in particular to BVDV having at least one mutation in the coding -sequence of the Npro protein and the glycoprotein Eras, wherein said mutation(s) in the coding sequence for glycoprotein E"18 are located in the nucleotide   sequence   coding   for   the   conserved   Ems   sequence   SLHGIWPEKIC   or RHEWNKHGWCNW. Preferably, such mutations concern two different amino acids, i.e. are double mutations. Thus, said mutations may be 1 to 3 nucleotide mutations in two different tripletts encoding two amino acids. Thus, the invention also relates to a pestivirus, in particular to BVDV having at least one mutation in the coding sequence of the Npro protein and the glycoprotein Ems, wherein said mutation(s) in the coding sequence for glycoprotein E™8 are two mutations  located in  the nucleotide sequence coding for the conserved E™5  sequence SLHGIWPEKIC and/or RHEWNKHGWCNW. Preferably, such mutations concern a single amino acid. Thus, said mutation may be 1 to 3 nucleotide mutations in one triplett encoding one amino acid. Thus, the invention also relates to a pestivirus, in particular to BVDV having at least one mutation in the coding sequence of the Npro protein and the glycoprotein Ems, wherein a single   mutation   is   located   in   the   conserved   E™5   sequence    SLHGIWPEKIC   or RHEWNKHGWCNW.<br>

In case no processing signal sequence is inserted, a maximum of 12 amino acids, preferably aminoterminal amino acids, of Npro may be present, the remaining amino acids have to be deleted. Furthermore, other than the Eras mutations as disclosed above (at least one of which has to be present in the pestivirus, in particular in BVDV according to the invention), the remaining sequences of the pestivirus, in particular BVDV may remain unchanged, i.e. are not mutated, or may also have mutations close to the N-terminal end of the C-protein.

Ubiquitin is a well known highly conserved cellular protein of 76 amino acids. Among other functions, ubiquitin is a key player in protein catabolism since conjugation with ubiquitin can mark a protein for degradation via the proteasome. Ubiquitin conjugated with or fused to other proteins via the carboxyterminal glycin can be cleaved off by cellular ubiquitin-specific proteases. Thus, fusion of a protein to the carboxyterminus of ubiquitin will usually result in defined proteolytic cleavage of the fusion protein into its components when expressed within a cell.<br>

Recently, a fundamental role of the protein in autophagy has been defined. During this process, LC3 is activated by carboxyterminal cleavage. Thereby, a new carboxyterminus is generated that consists of glycine.

EXAMPLES<br>
The following examples serve to further illustrate the present invention; but the same should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention disclosed herein.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
BVDV XIKE-B: foetopathogenicity assessment in pregnant heifers<br>
BVDV XIKE-B, an RNase negative mutant of the highly pathogenic BVDV type 2 isolate NewYork'93/C was recovered from the infectious cDNA clone pKANE40B and showed wild type-like (wt-like) growth characteristics in tissue culture. In animal experiments the mutant virus was found to be considerably attenuated so that it represented a promising candidate for development of a live attenuated vaccine virus (Meyer et al., 2002). To test whether this attenuated virus is still able to cross the placenta and infect the fetus, pregnant heifers were infected with XIKE-B. As a control wild type BVDV recovered from cDNA clone pKANE40A was used The respective virus named XIKE-A expresses an active Eras RNase in the infected cell. The study aimed to assess the safety of XIKE-A and XIKE-B in pregnant animals.<br>
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN<br>
Ten pregnant heifers were selected from a BVDV negative herd. The following groups of 5 heifers were included in the trial:<br><br>
(Table Remove)<br><br>
Heifers were moved to the experimental facilities 8 days before inoculations. Pregnancy status was confirmed after transport into the experimental facility. Heifers were between days 60 and 90 of gestation on the day of inoculation. Inoculation took place for all animals at one point of time.<br>
Heifers were monitored for the presence of clinical signs of BVDV infection including abortions during the observation period. Blood samples were collected from the animals for serology, antigen detection and white blood cells were counted. The experiment was terminated 9 weeks after infection. Non-aborted cows were slaughtered, the uterus examined and collected. Foetal organ samples were collected during routine necropsy and examined for BVDV infection.<br>
The presence of fetal infection was the main evaluation parameter, composed from the number of BVDV-related cow mortality, the number of BVDV-related abortions and the number of BVDV positive fetuses at termination. In addition to the main parameter, clinical signs characteristic for BVDV infection, viraemia and white blood cell counts in cows and rectal temperature after challenge were evaluated.<br>
Animals<br>
Heifers were purchased from a farm free of BVDV.<br>
Only animals, which met the following inclusion criteria, were used.<br>
Inclusion criteria<br>

Test strain JB<br><br>
(Table Remove)<br><br>
Pregnancy Control<br>
Pregnancy was confirmed immediately before inoculation.<br>
Inoculation of Heifers<br>
The inoculation is Day 0 of the experiment.<br>
In each nostril, 3 ml of the test material was administered intranasally by syringe without needle. Each time a new sterile syringe was taken. Administration was performed during the aspiration phase in order to minimize loss of fluid via expiration of material.<br>
Post-Inoculation Observations<br><br>
Collection and examination of blood samples<br>
Blood was collected following standard, aseptic procedures (disinfecting the bleeding site). A new sterile syringe and needle was used for each animal.<br>
Blood collection to prepare serum<br>
At least 10 ml blood was collected from the heifers immediately before inoculation, then weekly after infection and at the termination of the study. Serum was stored at -20 °C until required.<br>
Blood collection for leukocyte counts and buffy coat preparations<br>
For leukocyte counting, 3 ml blood was transferred immediately after collection to suitable sterile vessels (Venoject, Terumo Europe N.V,, Leuven, Belgium), pre-filled with 0.06 ml EDTA (0.235MOL7L).<br>
For buffy coat preparations, at least 15 ml blood was transferred immediately after collection to suitable sterile vessels, pre-filled with 0.1 ml Heparin solution (Na-heparin for inj., 5 000 lU/ml lot. A7B163A exp. date: 11/2000: Gedeon Richter RT, Budapest, Hungary) yielding at least 20 IU Heparin per ml blood in the blood sample. The content was carefully mixed thereafter.<br>
For preparation of buffy coats and leukocyte counting, blood was collected from the heifers<br>
•	on every day, between Day 0 and Day 14 after infection;<br>
•	on every second day, between Day 15 and Day 40, or until all animals were negative for<br>
virus isolation for three consecutive sampling time points.<br>
Preparation of serum<br>
Blood was allowed to clot at room temperature, and separated by centrifbgation. Each serum sample was divided into two aliquots of at least 2 ml each. One set of aliquots was assayed for BVDV specific antibodies by ELISA. The rest of the sera was frozen and stored at -20 °C until required.<br>
Leukocyte counts<br>
Leukocyte counts was determined with a coulter-counter semi-automated electronic device (Diatron Minicell-16; Messtechnik GmbH, Wien, Austria) with a claimed accuracy of 0.1 x 109 / 1, 100 / uj. The instrument was used (calibration and leukocyte-counts) according to the manufacturer's recommendations.<br><br>
Preparation of buffy coats<br>
Heparin blood samples was transported to the laboratory as soon as possible. Buffy coat preparation procedure, following a standard laboratory procedure was performed under aseptic conditions (sterile pipettes, handling, clean bench etc.).<br>
The obtained buffy coats were re-suspended in a small volume (2 ml) of RPMI1640 and frozen at -70 °C in two aliquots of 0,5 ml. The residual 1ml buffy coats was immediately used for determination of blood cell associated B VDV by co-cultivation in a permissive cell culture.<br>
BVD serum antibody ELISA-test<br>
Each serum sample was tested for the presence of BVDV-antibodies using a suitable and validated ELISA test (Svanovir™ BVDV antibody test Cat* 10-2200-10). Test was validated and performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Positive samples were diluted according to the Iog2 scale to determine BVDV antibody titers.<br>
BVD antigen assay(s)<br>
Each buffy coat sample was assayed for the presence of BVDV by co-cultivation of the freshly prepared buffy-coats with susceptible cells or a cell-line. No freezing was allowed before co-cultivation.<br>
Plasma was collected and provided to Man-Gene from each sample.<br>
Clinical observations Observation of heifers<br>
Animals were examined daily from Day 0-42 post inoculation for the presence of clinical symptoms by a sufficiently trained veterinarian.<br>
All clinical signs were recorded and described by its nature, consistence/touch, severity (mild, medium or severe) location, size of the area affected, and they will be scored according to agreed and standard definitions. Special attention was paid to respiratory signs (respiration, its rate; nasal or ocular discharge; conjunctivitis, sneezing, coughing, etc.) and diarrhea.<br><br>
Rectal temperatures<br>
Rectal temperatures were measured daily in each heifer, at the same hour of the day (preferably in the morning) from 5 days prior to the inoculation till 21 days post infection.<br>
Daily measurement of rectal temperature was continued until each animal had rectal temperatures below or equal to 39 °C for at least 3 consecutive days.<br>
Detection of interrupted pregnancy<br>
Pregnancy was confirmed and suspicion for abortion or resorption of the fetus was established by rectal examination. A trained veterinarian examined all animals at inoculation, 1 and 2 months post-inoculation. The examination was carried out according to the generally accepted veterinary practice.<br>
Heifers were examined daily for any sign of abortion until termination of the study (8 -12 weeks post-challenge).<br>
Termination of the Study<br>
The study was terminated by slaughtering the heifers and extracting the fetuses. Fetuses and fetal material were transferred into closed transport containers marked with the number of the cow and the date/time. Containers were transported to a selected necropsy room.<br>
Necropsy of the heifers was not required. Necropsy will be performed on fetuses, findings recorded and a panel of samples collected as described below.<br>
Post-Mortem Examination<br>
A detailed necropsy of the experimental animals was done in each case of death.<br>
Post-mortem examinations were carried out by an experienced veterinary surgeon and the data were recorded on appropriate data sheets. Further laboratory tests were performed according to the clinical signs and lesions observed. If the diagnosis of the necropsy referred to a disease caused by microbial agent the diagnosis was verified by an appropriate test, specific for the agent.<br><br>
Each tissue sample was collected in at least 2 separate, labeled containers and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were stored at -70 °C until required.<br>
Aborted fetuses and study termination<br>
At least the following tissue samples were collected from the fetuses:<br>
•	exudate from the peritoneal cavity or thorax, if present,<br>
•	mesenteric lymph nodes,<br>
•	spleen,<br>
•	thymus,<br>
•	cerebellum,<br>
•	kidney,<br>
•	bone marrow from the sternum,<br>
•	sample from the placenta, if available.<br>
Dead or sacrificed heifers<br>
At least the following tissue samples were collected:<br>
•	blood for buffy coat, if available,<br>
•	blood for serum, if available,<br>
•	Peyer's patches,<br>
•	mesenteric lymph nodes,<br>
•	spleen,<br>
•	kidney,<br>
•	uterus, including a sample from the placenta, if available.<br>
Storage and Transport of Samples<br><br>
(Table Remove)<br><br>
Samples were sent for laboratory analysis as required by the sponsor. The choice of samples and the timing of transport were agreed with the study monitor or the project manager. As a matter of<br><br>
general principle, samples corning from aborted material or from new-born calves were investigated as soon as possible.<br>
RESULTS Mortality<br>
Heifer No, 626 (Group 1) died on Day 13 PI (post inoculation). The following table summarises the observed clinical signs and lesions revealed during necropsy:<br><br><br><br>
Heifer<br><br>
In-life observations<br><br>
Post mortem findings<br><br><br><br>
No. 626<br><br>
signs of disease from 7 DPI lachrymation, nasal discharge on 7 - 12 DPI<br>
loss of appetite from 8-12 DPI diarrhoea on 11 - 12 DPI elevated respiratory rate on 9-10 and 12 DPI coughing on 9 DPI abnormal breathing on 12 DPI<br><br><br>
•	dehydration<br>
•	haemorrhages on the serous<br>
membranes<br>
•	hyperaemi a of the Peyer's<br>
patches<br>
•	oedema of the lung<br><br>
These clinical and gross-pathological findings are consistent with BVDV induced lesions, therefore it may be concluded that the reason of death was the BVDV infection.<br>
Abortions after Infection<br>
One heifer had clinical abortion in each group. Heifer No. 615 (Group 1) aborted on Day 38 PI, Heifer No. 469 (Group 2) aborted on Day 39 PI. Both foetuses showed the signs of autolysis, and they were estimated to die at least 3-7 days before the abortion (around 32 - 35 DPI). In Group 1, no foetus was found in Heifer No. 526 during the slaughter examination at termination. Gross-pathology of the uterus revealed the followings:<br>
•	the right uterine horn was slightly enlarged,<br>
•	the remains of placenta with progressed autolysis was retained in the lumen.<br>
The findings on the uterus of Heifer No. 526 is consistent with a "silent" abortion, most likely due to the BVD infection.<br>
Clinical Observation of Heifers<br>
A summary of the clinical observation data and duration of clinical signs in the groups are presented below.<br><br>
Clinical signs and the days post inoculation (DPD when they were observed<br>
Group 1 (XIKE-A)<br><br>
(Table Remove)<br><br>
*Heifer No. 626 died on Day 13 PI<br>
Group 2 (XIKE-B)<br><br>
(Table Remove)<br><br>
All Group 1 animals infected with XIKE-A exhibited a broad spectrum of clinical signs. Respiratory signs appeared first accompanied by loss of appetite, and a few days later heifers developed diarrhoea with the exception of Heifer No. 526. One heifer died and another one aborted (see before) after infection. All these signs are consistent with the symptoms expected after infection with a virulent BVDV strain.<br><br>
All Group 2 animals infected with XtKE-B were free of clinical signs. At the same time, one heifer had abortion during the observation period,<br>
Rectal Temperatures<br>
No abnormal temperature changes were detected before the infection of the animals.<br>
In Group 2, all temperature values remained within the physiological range from Day 0 to Day<br>
21 after infection.<br>
All Group 1 animals showed elevated rectal temperature after infection that were detected<br>
between Days 7-11 PI.<br>
Findings at Study Termination<br>
At study termination, foetuses were examined at slaughter.<br>
No foetus was recovered from Heifer No. 526 (see section 10.2 "Abortions after Infection").<br>
The following findings were observed at the necropsy of the foetuses:<br>
Animal No. Findings	Conclusion<br>
Group 1<br>
598	Ascites, general oedema, autolysis	Died at least 2 weeks earlier<br>
618	Ascites, general oedema, autolysis	Died at least 3 weeks earlier<br>
Group 2<br>
565	Ascites, general oedema, liver	Foetus considered non-viable<br>
degeneration<br>
588	Normal<br>
608	Normal, perirenal oedema<br>
619	General autolysis	Died 3-6 weeks earlier<br>
The findings suggest that 2 Group 1 animals (Heifers No. 598 and No. 618) and one Group 2 animal (Heifer No. 619) died several weeks before extraction, and so they can be considered abortions.<br>
Abortions Modified by Post-Mortem Findings<br>
After the post-mortem examination it was not clear why some of the heifers had not had abortion. Dead foetuses should be considered as abortions, therefore the clinical picture was modified after the termination of the study as follows:<br><br>
Group 1<br><br>
(Table Remove)<br><br>
Examination of Blood Samples Leukocyte count<br>
WBC counting was interrupted on Day 26 PI, as all animals became negative for virus isolation<br>
for this time point.<br>
0 DPI values were considered as individual baseline for comparison.<br>
In Group 2, the leukocyte counts never went to 40 % or more below the baseline value until the<br>
end of the observation period (26 DPI).<br>
In Group 1, one animal (Heifer No. 598) had WBC count below the 40 % baseline for one day.<br>
Serology<br>
None of the selected animals had BVDV specific antibody in their sera before the infection. After infection, all surviving Group 1 heifers developed BVDV specific antibodies detected from 3 weeks PI and lasted until the end of the observation period in all study animals. In Group 2, 4 out of the 5 heifers had BVDV specific antibodies detected from 4 weeks PI. Measurable antibody response lasted only in 3 animals until the end of the observation period. Titres were lower in Group 2 than in Group 1.<br><br>
Virus Detection by Co-Cultivation Buffy coats<br>
BVDV was detected in both groups. The duration of virus detection is summarised below. All samples were co-cultivated immediately after collection, i. e. without freezing.<br><br>

* Foetuses were autolysed at the time of sampling<br>
Conclusion:<br>
The study aimed to assess the safety of XQCE-A and XIKE-B in pregnant animals. Ten pregnant heifers were selected from a BVDV negative herd. Two groups of 5 heifers were included in the trial: one was inoculated with XKE-A the other with XIKE-B virus strain. Heifers were between days 60 and 90 of gestation on the day of inoculation.<br><br>
Heifers were monitored for the presence of clinical signs of BVDV infection including abortions during the observation period. Blood samples were collected from the animals for serology, antigen detection and white blood cells were counted. The experiment was terminated 9 weeks after infection. Non-aborted cows were slaughtered, the uterus examined and collected. Foetal organ samples were collected during routine necropsy and examined for BVDV infection.<br>
The presence of fetal infection was the main evaluation parameter, composed from the number of BVDV-related cow mortality, the number of BVDV-related abortions and the number of BVD positive fetuses at termination. In addition to the main parameter, clinical signs characteristic for BVDV infection, viraemia and white blood cell count in cows and rectal temperature after challenge were evaluated.<br>
The XIKE-B virus proved to be less pathogenic than XIKE-A, nevertheless BVD related abortion and infection of the foetus was observed in the XIKE-B1 group, too. Therfore it can be concluded that the inactivation of the Ems RNase does not prevent fetal infection.<br>
EXAMPLE 2 BVDV XIKE-A-NdN: foetopathogenicity assessment in pregnant heifers<br>
The Npro gene has been shown to be nonessential for growth of CSFV in tissue culture (Tratschin et al., 1998). Even though a proof for BVDV attenuation in consequence of Npro deletion is still missing, a role of this protein in the interaction between virus and host seemed to be possible and was actually indicated by recent experiments for CSFV (Mayer et al., 2004; Riiggli et al., 2003). We therefore wanted to investigate, whether the deletion of the major part of the Npro coding sequence leads to a virus that no longer infects the fetus in pregnant heifers. The Npro gene except for the 5' terminal 4 codons was deleted from the full length cDNA clone pKANE40A according to standard procedures. The resulting mutant full length clone was used as template for in vitro transcription and the resulting cRNA was transfected into MDBK cells as described (Meyer et al., 2002). The recovered virus was amplified in tissue culture and then used in the animal experiment described below. BVDV XIKE-B served as a control since it was shown before that it is able to cross the placenta (EXAMPLE 1).<br><br>
OBJECTIVE(S)/PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br>
The study aims to assess the safety of a live attenuated BVDV with a genomic deletion of most of the Npro coding region in pregnant animals.<br>
Material and Methods applied are described in Example 1<br>

observing veterinarian at the study location and the<br>
pathologist were not be aware of the treatment; they<br>
only received a protocol extract relevant to their tasks.<br>
Vaccination was performed by the investigator or his<br>
assignee. Samples for virus isolation were coded by the<br>
investigator until all results are available.	<br><br>
RESULTS<br>
All heifers were healthy and pregnant at study start. All animals proved to be free of BVDV and BVDV antibodies before the initiation of the.<br>
Preparation and Control of the Virus used for the Infection<br>
Samples were collected throughout the dilution steps and assayed on the day of preparation, i.e. without freezing by co-cultivation on suitable tissue culture. The results of virus titration are shown in the following table.<br><br>

Clinical Symptoms of BVDV Infection<br>
The table below gives a summary about the animals that had clinical signs during the observation period.<br>
Clinical signs and the days post inoculation (DPT) when they were observed<br>
Group 1 (XIKE-A NdN)	Group 2 (XKE-B)<br><br><br><br>
(Table Remove)<br><br>
Only mild and transient clinical signs were observed in some of the animals in each group. In Group 1, one out of the 5 heifers had loss of appetite on day 8 PI. In Group 2, two out of the 3 animals had clinical signs. Both heifers experienced coughing around day 21 PI that was accompanied with loss of appetite in one of the animals.<br>
Rectal Temperatures<br>
No abnormal temperature changes were detected before the inoculation of the animals. The few<br><br>
cases of elevated temperatures measured after the inoculation are summarised in the table below.<br><br>
(Table Remove)<br><br>
One animal had slightly elevated temperature in each group, and also one animal had fever in each group. Fever was detected on day 8 or 9 PI. Temperature values always returned to normal value on the following day.<br>
Leukocyte Counts<br>
Some leukopenia was observed in all groups between PI days 3-8. The number of animals with at least 40 % reduction in white blood cell count was the following:<br><br>

Serology (BVD V antibodies)<br>
In compliance with the study protocol, all heifers were free of BVDV antibodies before vaccination. In Group 1 (inoculated with XDGE-A NdN) and Group 2 (inoculated with XIKE-B), complete seroconversion was detected only at study termination (2 months after inoculation).<br>

Conclusion<br>
The Npro deletion resulted in a considerable attenuation of the BVDV in comparison to the parental virus XIKE-A that was shown to be highly pathogenic (Meyer et al., 2002). However, the Npro deletion alone is not preventing transmission of a NY93 based virus recombinant to the foetus after inoculation of pregnant cows.<br>

To be able to test the potential of a combination of RNase inactivation and N1"10 deletion with regard to BVDV attenuation and fetal transmission, different BVDV-2 mutants with deletions within the Npro coding region were established based on the infectious cDNA clone pKANE40B, the RNase negative mutant of pKANE40A with a deletion of codon 349. The recovered viruses were analyzed with regard to presence of the desired mutations, the absence of second site mutations in the regions flanking the introduced changes and their growth characteristics in tissue culture. XIKE-B-NdN (V-pK88C), a variant containing a deletion of the complete Npro coding region except for codons 1 to 4 in addition to the RNase inactivating deletion of codon 349 was chosen for an animal experiment since it combined the desired mutations with acceptable growth characteristics. The aim of the study was to assess the safety of a live attenuated BVDV isolate in pregnant animals.<br>
Five BVDV-negative, pregnant heifers were inoculated intranasally with an infective dose of 105 TCEDSO/animal XIKE-B-NcIN (back titration data are depicted in Table 3.1). Clinical data were recorded daily. Blood samples were collected for white blood cell counting, for buffy-coat preparation and serology. After termination of the study foetal tissues were collected for virus isolation.<br>
MATERIAL AND METHODS:<br>
As detailed for example 1:<br><br>
RESULTS<br>
No clinical data were observed (data not shown). Leukocyte counts remained virtually unchanged except for a significant decrease by approx. 40% below the baseline value (dayO) in heifer no-1015 on a single day (day 6 p.i.) (data not shown).<br>
Analysis of buffy coat preparations:<br>
Approximately 106 leukocytes were cultured in duplicates with MDBK-cells in 24-well tissue culture plates for 5 days. Samples were freeze-thawed twice. One hundred microliter aliquots of thawed samples were inoculated onto freshly seeded 24-well tissue culture plates and tested for virus by indirect immune-fluorescence staining (mAb Code 4, directed against a conserved epitope in nonstructural protein NS3). No BVDV could be isolated from the buffy coat preparations of animals # 921, 1013, 1015, 1055 and 1075 (Table 3.2) whereas positive controls clearly showed the correct conduction of the test.<br>
b) Posf-mortem examination of foetal tissues<br>
After termination of the study the following foetal tissues were collected for virus isolation: spleen, kidney, thymus, sternum, cerebellum, placenta, intestine and abdominal fluid. Briefly, tissue suspensions were made in a mortar using sterile sea sand and ice-cold PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+. Mortars were rinsed with 1 ml ice-cold PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2"1" and suspensions were centrifuged for 10 min. at 2000 x g (4°C). The supernatant was first passed through a disposable 0.45 Jim filter holder, followed by a second filter passage (0.2 /im pore size). Virus isolation was carried out in duplicates (400 /il foetal tissue suspension or 100 p,l foetal abdominal fluid) on a monolayer of MDBK-cells in a 24 wells tissue culture plate (37°C, 7% CO2). Tissue samples were controlled daily for cytopathic effects or bacterial contamination, and after an incubation time of 5 days plates were frozen and thawed twice. 100 /il of samples were passaged to freshly seeded MDBK-cells. Virus was detected by indirect immuno-fluorescence staining (mAb Code 4). No BVDV could be detected in the tissue samples or foetal abdominal fluid (Table 3.3).<br>
c) Serological Findings<br>
Serum neutralization titres were determined before inoculation, 1 month post-inoculation and at termination of the study. Sera from all animals were tested in triplicates for neutralizing antibodies against NY93/C, and the endpoint dilution was read by indirect immunofluorescence staining. Results were expressed as the endpoint dilution, which neutralized approximately 100<br><br>
TCIDso and calculated by the method of Kaerber. No definite data could be obtained for day 0, and 1 and 2 weeks post infection as the sera were toxic for MBDK-cells in dilutions up to 1:16 and no neutralization could be detected at higher dilutions. Starting with the third week post vaccination all animals developed neutralising antibodies against the homologous B VDV-2 virus NY'93/C lasting till the end of the experiment (Table 3.4 and Fig. 1).<br>
d) Conclusions<br>
The data obtained during the animal study clearly show that BVDV XIKE-B-NdN represents a highly attenuated virus, In contrast to wild type virus or the single mutants XtKE-B or XIKE-A-NdN that show foetal transmission in pregnant heifers at high rates the double mutant did not cross the placenta. BVDV XIKE-B-NdN as well as similar double mutants are extremely suitable for the use in a live attenuated vaccine.<br>

Efficacy and crossprotection study<br>
Two possible problems have to be faced with regard to vaccination with attenuated virus mutants BVDV XIKE-B or BVDV XKE-B-NdN. First, there is a general problem concerning cross protection between BVDV-1 and BVDV-2. At least vaccination with inactivated BVDV-1 vaccines did not prevent the transmission of BVDV-2 to the foetus in pregnant animals. Since protection against foetal infection represents the major aim of anti BVDV vaccination, such vaccines cannot be regarded to induce a protective immunity on a broad range. The question therefore was, whether vaccination with live attenuated BVDV-2 can prevent virus transmission to the foetus. Second, the reduced growth rates of BVDV XDKE-B-NdN might result in only a low level of protection not able to prevent transplacental infection of the foetus in pregnant heifers. To address these problems, an animal study was started. The animals (2 groups of 10 animals each) were vaccinated either with BVDV XIKE-B or XKE-B-NdN (intended dosage: 1ml of supernatant with 105 TCIDso of virus; backtitration is shown in Tab. 3.5). None of the animals showed significant clinical signs after the vaccination except for one animal of the nonvaccinated control group with mild coughing for one day. Rectal temperature values were below 39 °C except for one animal of the nonvaccinated control group that hat 39.1°C for one day. Buffy coat samples prepared after vaccination were analysed for the presence of virus as described above. The experiments showed that only 5 of the 20 animals contained virus in the blood for 1 or 2 days at 4 to 8 days post infection (Tab. 3.6).<br>

Four weeks after vaccination, insemination of the animals was carried out. Challenge infections were performed 60 to 90 days later using either a BVDV-1 strain (BVDV KE-9, heterologous challenge, animals vaccinated with XIKE-B) or a heterologous BVDV-2 strain (BVDV KE-13, homologous challenge, animals vaccinated with XDCE-B-NdN) (intended dosage: 105 TCID50 in 6ml; backtitration is shown in Tab. 3.7). From each group of vaccinated animals 5 pregnant heifers were randomly selected for the challenge infection. Animals vaccinated with BVDV XIKE-B were challenged with the BVDV-1 strain KE-9, whereas heifers vaccinated with BVDV XIKE-B/NdN were challenged with BVDV-2 KE-13. In addition, 2 nonvaccinated control animals were infected with each of the challenge viruses.<br>

The vaccinated animals did not show viremia or clinical symptoms upon challenge infection. The challenge was successful as all non-vaccinated controls were BVDV positive (Tab. 3.8). Only mild signs of disease were observed in the control groups. The white blood cell counts were nearly normal (not shown).<br><br>

Serum neutralization liters were determined before inoculation, 1 month post-inoculation, before challenge, 1 month after challenge and at termination of the study. Sera from all animals were tested in triplicates for neutralizing antibodies against KE9 and NY93/C (1456Nase), and the endpoint dilution was read by indirect immunofluorescence staining. Results were expressed as the endpoint dilution, which neutralized approximately 100 TCID^Q and calculated by the method of Kaerber. At some of the higher antibody litres,<br>
the used endpoint dilution was not high enough. Against KE9, only animals vaccinated with XIKE-B developed low antibody litres starting about week 4. At challenge, all animals had antibody litres, which increased considerably starting around week 4 post challenge. XIKE-B vaccinated animals had higher antibody litres Ihen those vaccinated with XDGE-B-NdN vaccinated. All animals developed about the same neutralization litre against NY93/C four weeks posi vaccination, wilh marginally lower tilres in XIKE-B-NdN vaccinated animals. After challenge all animals had high antibody tilres. Fig. 2 shows Ihe serum neulralization assay againsl KE9 (BVDV-1) and Fig. 3 shows the serum neutralization assay against NY93/C (BVDV-2).<br>
Analysis of tissue samples obtained after termination of the study from the foetuses revealed that the material obtained from the vaccinated animals gave negative results whereas transmission had occurred in all 4 control animals (Tab. 3.9). Thus, it is clear that the established BVDV-2 mutants are well suited as efficient cross protective vaccine viruses .<br><br>

Conclusion<br>
The challenge was successful as all non-vaccinated controls were BVDV viraemic and foetuses of all non-vaccinated controls were BVDV positive.<br>
Both isolates gave full protection under the present test and assay conditions. Isolate XIKE-B, with the single genetic marker was shown to cross-protect against type 1 BVDV challenge -in terms of BVD viraemia and transmission to the foetus after challenge. Isolate XIKE-B-NdN with the double genetic marker was able to fully protect against a heterologue type 2 BVDV challenge strain in terms of BVD viraemia and transmission to the foetus after challenge.<br>
1.	Isolate XIKE-B (type 2 isolate) was shown to cross-protect against type 1 BVDV<br>
challenge in terms of BVD viraemia and transmission to the foetus after challenge under the<br>
present test and assay conditions (n=4).<br>
2.	Isolate XIKE-B-NdN (type 2 isolate) fully protected against a heterologues type 2 BVDV<br>
challenge strain in terms of BVD viraemia and transmission to the foetus after challenge under<br>
the present test and assay conditions (n=5).<br>
EXAMPLE 4 Establishment of Npro mutants<br>
Further analyses of B VDV-2 mutants with Npro deletions. Different mutants with deletions in the<br>
Npro-coding region of the genome were established. Initially, only true deletions or a deletion<br>
accompanied by a point mutation were introduced.<br>
A:       [Npro]i-[C-term];<br>
B:        [Npro]3-[C-term];<br>
C:        [Npro]4-[C-term];<br>
D:       [Npro]6-[C-term];<br>
E:        [Npro]4-[C~term*]<br>
In the formulas [Npl°]x represents the number of residues of the aminoterminus of Npro that are<br>
left in the mutated polyprotein amino acids, [C-term] is the complete polyprotein except for Npro<br>
(starting with the C protein and ending with NS5B), and [C-term*] is the same as [C-term] but<br>
with a mutation at position 2 of the C protein (N instead of D).<br><br>
The growth rates of the recovered viruses were considerably lower than those of wild type XIKE-A or the KNase negative mutant XIKE-B. There are two possible explanations for this finding: (i) dependent on the virus strain, sequences of variable length of the Npro-coding region are necessary for efficient translation initiation (Myers et al., 2001; Tautz et al., 1999) and (ii) the fusion of additional sequences to the aminoterminus of the capsid protein interferes with capsid protein function.<br>
To obtain better growing Npro deletion mutants, a second set of mutants was generated with either a bovine ubiquitin gene or a fragment of the bovine LC3-coding sequence replacing the major part of the Npro gene. These constructs allow efficient translation and generate a capsid protein with the correct amino terminus.<br>
[Npro]22-[PSHC-term]<br>
wherein PS is ubiquitin or LC3, C-terrn is the complete polyprotein except for Npro (starting with<br>
the C protein and ending with NS5B).<br>
The growth rates of these mutants were more similar to what was determined for XIKE-A. It even seemed that the two RNase positive viruses according to the formula [ N^Jaz-OPS]- [C-term] named V-pK87F and V-pK87G showed no significant growth retardation at all, whereas the RNase negative counterpart V-pK88G once again was somewhat hampered in propagation but to a lesser extend than the formerly descirbed mutants.<br>

MELFSNELLYKTSDEGSK...<br>
MELFSNELLYKT represents the aminoterminal  sequence of NprQ  of the BVDV  isolate<br>
NewYork93/C.<br><br>
It may also be possible to use variants of this sequence with one or several mutations. Especially<br>
the naturally occurring variations as found in other pestiviruses can be expected to be functional.<br>
Therefore, the complete list of the tested or proposed variants with the different parts of the<br>
amrnoterminal end of Npro can be enlarged by equivalent sets with amino acid exchanges. Below,<br>
typical examples of the respective sequences are given for several pestiviruses but the possible<br>
variations are not limited to these examples.<br>

BVDVSD1:	MEUTNELLYKT<br>
CSFV Brescia:	MELNHFELLYKT<br>
BDVX818:	MELNKFELLYKT<br>
Thus, these variants for example may include: M£L/-[PS]o-[C-tenn] ;<br>
MEL7S-[PS]o-[C-term];<br>
M5L/5//-[PS3o-[C-term];<br>
MELISNE-\PS]o-[C-term] ;<br>

MELISNELL-\PS]0-[C-term];<br>

MELITNE-\PS]0-[C-teTm] ;<br>
M£Ur#EL-[PS]0-[C-term];<br>
MELJTNELLYK-\PS]Q-[C-tGTm];<br>
These formulas may also have [PS]i, i.e. PS may also be one of the PS as described herein. Sequences belonging to the Npro protein are in italics. Amino acid exchanges with regard to the sequence of BVDV NewYork93/C are in bold.<br><br>
Further examples can be found e.g. by using the GenBank accession numbers given in Becher et aL, 2003, Virology 311, 96-104) or by standard sequence data searches.<br>
A further possibility could be the use of a processing signal (PS) inserted between the (residual) Npro sequence and the aminoterminus of the capsid protein. The PS leads to a cleavage that generates a functional capsid protein. The configuration of such constructs could be as follows:<br>
[Npro]22-PS[C-term]<br>
PS: Processing signal. Can either be a target for a protease (e.g. ubiquitin, LC3 as defined herein or a protease or an unstable peptide leading to processing at its own carboxyterminus like e.g. intein (Chong et al. 1998 and references therein) or 3C of picomaviruses, 2A of cardioviruses or aphtoviruses, pi5 of rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus or the corresponding protease of other caliciviruses (Proter 1993, and references therein; Meyers et al., 2000 and references therein). When using a PS, a large number of different variants are possible since the PS ensures the generation of the correct amino terminus of the capsid protein C. Thus, when using a PS construct, all kinds of deletions or mutations of the Npro sequence are expected to result in viable mutants as long as the reading frame is not shifted or translation stopped by an in frame stop codon. As an example we established a viable CSFV Npro deletion mutant according to the formula [Npro]29-PS[C-term]<br>
Especially interesting could be Npro mutations blocking the proteolytic activity of the protein. Rtimenapf et al. (1998) have published the identification of the active site residues of the protease for CSFV Alfort Tubingen. The respective amino acids (glutamic acid at position 22, histidine at position 49 and cysteine at postion 69) are conserved for other pestiviruses. Thus, exchanges of any amino acid expect for serine or threonine for the cysteine at position 69 will result in destruction of the protease activity. Similarly, changing the glutamic acid at position 22 will most likely result in inactivation of the protease unless the new amino acid is aspartic acid. Similarly most if not all exchanges at position 49 will lead to an inactive protease).<br><br>
