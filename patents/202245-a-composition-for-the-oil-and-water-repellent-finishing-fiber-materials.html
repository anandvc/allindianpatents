				<td>* Compositions for the oil and water repellent finishinp of<br>
fiber materials<br>
This invention relates to a composition comprising a fluorine-containing ester and an oligourethane or a polyurethane. it further relates to a particularly advantageous process-for preparing aqueous dispersions of such compositions and to the use of such compositions for treating fiber materials.<br>
It is known to confer an oil and water repellent finish on fiber materials, especially functional<br>
textiles in the form of sheet material, by applying fluoropolymers to them. This frequently<br>
takes the form of applying polymers that contain perfluorinated radicals (RF) to the textiles in<br>
the form of aqueous dispersions. Useful polymers here include such acrylate homo- or<br>
copolymers, polyurethanes and polyesters as contain RF radicals.<br>
«<br>
The use of RF-containing acrylates for the treatment of textiles is described for example in US-A4 742 140. US-A 5 725 789 and US-A 3 491 169. The use of RF-containing polyurethanes is disclosed in US-A 5 019 428. US-A 3 923 715 discloses the use of mixtures of an RF-containing ester and a nonftuorinated vinyl polymer. EP-A 208 421 likewise describes mixtures for the oil and water repellent finishing of textiles. WO 95/33093 relates to the finishing of textiles with fluorinated compounds and extenders. Finally US-A 4 264 484 and US-A 4 401 780 likewise disclose mixtures which contain fluorinated fractions and are useful for the treatment of textile sheet materials.<br>
Prior art compositions do not have optimal properties with regard to the oil and water repellent finishing of textile materials. First, the stability of aqueous dispersions of a number of such compositions is unsatisfactory. This is a disadvantage because the use of compositions for textile treatment in the form of aqueous dispersions is the technically and economically best method. Secondly, the desired performance level is in a number of cases achievable only, if at all, with high product add-ons on the textile. Thirdly, it is a frequently observed disadvantage that the performance of finished textiles deteriorates excessively on abrasion because, in use, ie. under mechanical stress, a certain proportion of the finishing products on the surface of the textile is removed by abrasion, and this has an adverse effect on the permanence of the finishing effects.<br><br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a composition for conferring a highly effective oil and water repellent finish on fiber materials that is obtainable in the form of very stable aqueous dispersions and that provides finished fiber materials with minimal if any post-abrasion deterioration in performance.<br><br><br><br>
Compositions according to the invention are very useful for the treatment of fiber materials, especially textile sheet materials such as upholstery fabrics. The fiber materials here are preferably textile sheet materials which are 50 to 100% by weight synthetic polymer, especially polyester, polyacrylonitrile or polyamide or mixtures thereof, and 0 to 50% by weight native fiber, especially cellulose. The sheet materials acquire oil and water repellent<br><br>
properties as a result. A particular advantage of the use of compositions according to the invention is that the finished fiber materials suffer little if any loss of oil and water repellent performance on mechanical abrasion. Treatment with compositions according to the invention also makes it possible to confer a pleasantly soft hand and substantial resistance to yellowing on fiber materials.<br>
Compositions according to the invention are preferably used in the form of aqueous dispersions. A preferred embodiment thus includes water and one or more dispersants as well as the components A and B. They preferably include at least one nonionic dispersant or a mixture of nonionic dispersants. In individual cases it is also possible for them to additionally include an anionic, cationic or amphoteric dispersant. In some cases, useful aqueous dispersions are obtainable by using a mixture of a nonionic dispersant and a cationic dispersant.<br><br><br>
reaction with the dicarboxylic acid of the formula I shall involve at least one diol of the formula (II) or (III) or of one of the formulae (VII) to (XI). Diols of the formulae (IV), (V) and/or (VI) may be additionally involved in the reaction.<br>
Diols for the purposes of the invention (component A, component B) are compounds conforming to one of the formulae (II) to (XII). Compounds which fall within one of these formulae are diols for the purposes of the invention, even if they contain more than two . alcoholic hydroxyl groups, ie. are strictly speaking not diols. Examples of such "diols" are triethanolamine (formula (V) with R" = -CH2CH2OH) and 1,1,1-trimethylolpropane (formula (XII)).<br>
Dicarboxylic acids useful for preparing component A fall within the abovementioned formula (I). Here, a is from 2 to 10, preferably from 2 to 6. R is hydrogen or an alkyl radical of 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Particularly good results are obtainable on using adipic acid (R=H, a=4) as dicarboxylic acid.<br><br><br>
(Vll) and of the formula (VNI), (IX), (X) and/or (XI). These esters and other esters useful as component A may be prepared according to generally known chemical methods, for example by esterifying or condensing the dicarboxylic acid with diol or by transesterifying with diol under acid catalysis in the presence or absence of an organic solvent. Ketones are useful solvents.<br>
Of the diols of the formula (III), particularly useful ones have R equal H, X equal -S- and . d=1. In this case, R' is where b is from 1 to 4, preferably 1, and RFI is a<br>
perfluorinated linear alkyt radical of 4 to 16, preferably 8 to 12, carbon atoms. Also very useful are diols of the formula (III) where d=0. In this case, R' is  again preferably -S- and b and RFI are each as defined above, although b in this case is preferably 2. Of the diols of the formula (IV), preferred ones have e from 1 to 3 and all R radicals equal CH3. Diols of the formula (IV) where R=H are less preferred; more particularly, in the -SiR2- units of the formula IV the two R radicals are never both hydrogen.<br>
Of the diols of the formula (V), diethanolamine, triethanolamine and<br>
■<br>
N-methyldiethanolamine are particularly useful.<br>
Of the diols of the formula (VI), particularly useful ones have all R radicals in the  units equal hydrogen. In the units, preferably all R radicals are<br>
independently hydrogen or CH3.<br><br><br><br>
The esters which form component A are compounds or mixtures of compounds which preferably contain 1 to 10 units derived from the dicarboxylic acid or units derived from the diol. Owing to the presence of the RF radicals, which contain a plurality of CF2 groups,<br><br>
component A rs an oligomer or polymer or a mixture of oligomers or polymers. Depending on the number of ester groupings, which is preferably 1 to 10, as mentioned above, component A may additionally constitute an oligoester or polyester or a mixture of oligoesters or polyesters. The number of units derived from the dicarboxylic acid and the diol, ie. the number of ester linkages, which is preferably 1 to 10, can be controlled through the reaction conditions for the reaction of dicarboxylic acid (derivative) with diol. For instance, an esterification or transesterification reaction can be discontinued in a conventional manner, by lowering the temperature or changing the pH (removing the acid used as catalyst).<br>
By contrast, component B, as more particularly described hereinbelow, is an oligourethane or polyurethane if only because a plurality of urethane linkages are present. That is, component B acquires the character of an oligomer or polymer or of a mixture of oligomers and polymers not solely by virtue of RF radicals.<br>
Component A preferably comprises esters obtainable by reacting (polycondensing) dicarboxylic acid or dicarboxylic acid mixture with diol or diol mixture in such a ratio that a total of 0.9 to 1.1 mol of alcoholic OH groups in the diol or diol mixture are used per mole of -COOH groups in the dicarboxylic acid or dicarboxylic acid mixture and 50 to 100% of the number of these alcoholic OH groups come from a diol of the formula (II) and/or of the formula (III) and/or of one of the formulae (VII) to (XI). When component A is prepared by transesterification, it is similarly preferable to use 0.9 to 1.1 mol of alcoholic groups per ester group of the dicarboxylic diester used as starting material.<br>
Component B in the compositions of the invention is an oligo- or polyurethane obtainable by reacting a diol or diol mixture selected from diols of the formulae (II) to (XII) with a djisocyanate or diisocyanate mixture. Formula (XII) describes 1,1,1-trismethylolpropane. What was said above with regard to particularly suitable, preferred compounds of these formulae for the preparation of component A applies to the preparation of component B as well. In contradistinction to the preparation of component A, however, it is not absolutely necessary for the preparation of component B that at least one diol of the formula (II) or of the formula (III) or of one of the formulae (VII) to (XI) participate in the reaction. Preferably, however, component B is prepared using at least one diol of the formula (II), (III), (VII), (VIII), (IX), (X) or (XI) alone or as part of a diol mixture.<br><br><br>
attached to R, R being as defined above, preferably being hydrogen or methyl. The other two free valences on CeHa are preferably disposed para to each other, ie. the isocyanate groups are preferably disposed para to each other.<br>
Aliphatic or cycloaliphatic R'" may be linear or branched. Useful diisocyanates for preparing component B include for example hexamethylene 1,6-diisocyanate, trimethylhexamethylene 1,6-diisocyanate (mixed isomers) or DDI 1410 diisocyanate (from Henkel, USA), DDI 1410 diisocyanate bfeing a cyclohexane derivative where each of 4 ring carbon atoms has a relatively long alkyl radical attached to it. Two of these long-chain alkyl radicals have a terminal -NCO group. DDI 1410 diisocyanate has a total of 38 carbon atoms. Preference is given to using diisocyanates of the formula (XIII) where R'" is an open-chain aliphatic, branched or unbranched radical of 4 to 10 carbon atoms, a cycloaliphatic radical of 6-40 carbon atoms or an aromatic radical of the abovementioned structure. Preferred cycloaliphatic diisocyanates include unsubstituted cyclohexane 1,4-diisocyanate, alkyl-mono- or -polysubstituted cyclohexane 1,4-diisocyanate and a cyclohexane which is substituted by alkyl groups whereof two are terminated by -NCO groups. Particularly preferred aromatic diisocyanates are toluylene diisocyanates C6H3(CH3)(NCO)2, where CeHa is again a trivalent radical derived from benzene. The position of the methyl group and of the two NCO groups relative to each other is freely choosable, and it is even possible to use mixed isomers, for example a mixture of toluene 2,4-diisocyanate and toluene 2,6-diisocyanate. A further diisocyanate preferred for preparing component B is diphenylmethane 4,4'-diisocyanate.<br>
As with the preparation of component A, a preferred way of preparing component B comprises reacting the starting compounds with each other in equimolar or substantially equimolar amounts. Thus, in a preferred embodiment of composition according to the invention, component B is an oligourethane or polyurethane obtainable by reacting a diol or mixture of diols of the abovementioned formulae (tl) to (XII) with a diisocyanate or mixture of<br><br>
diisocyanates of the formula (XIII) in such a ratio that 0.9 to 1.1 mol of NCO groups in the diisocyanate or diisocyanate mixture are used per mole of alcoholic group in the diol or diol mixture.<br>
Component B is an oligomer or polymer, not just on account of the presence of RF radicals (which, in contradistinction to component A, are not mandatory in component B). On the . contrary, component B has the character of an oligomer or polymer if only through the presence of a plurality of urethane linkages, -NH-CO-. Their number in component B is on average 5 to 100 per molecule, preferably 5 to 50. The number of urethane linkages in component B can be controlled in a conventional manner, through the conditions under which it is prepared.<br>
If the oligo- or polyurethane obtained by the reaction of diisocyanate with diol still contains free isocyanate groups, for example owing to the use of a molar excess of diisocyanate, these NCO groups are preferably blocked. This urethane with blocked isocyanate groups is very useful as component B in compositions according to the invention. NCO groups may be blocked using compounds having acidic hydrogen atoms that are known from the technical literature. Examples of useful blocking agents are dimethylpyrazole, diacetyl, caprolactam and substituted or unsubstituted phenols. Particularly preferred blocking agents for compositions according to the invention are ketone oximes, especially butanone oxime, acetone oxime or methyl isobutyl ketone oxime.<br>
To prepare component B from a mixture of diisocyanates and/or a mixture of diols, the reaction may be carried out by using all individual compounds of the mixtures simultaneously. Examples thereof are the reaction of a single diisocyanate with a mixture of diols, of a diisocyanate mixture with a single diol or the reaction of diisocyanate mixture with diol mixture in the simultaneous presence of all individual compounds of the respective mixtures. However, a particularly useful way to prepare a component B is a process in which the individual compounds of such a mixture are used in succession. This may be illustrated with reference to the example of a preferred embodiment of compositions according to the invention. In this preferred embodiment, component B is an oligourethane or polyurethane obtainable by reacting a diol of the formula (II), of the formula (VII) or of the formula (Vlll) with a diisocyanate of the formula OCN-R -NCO, where R is a linear or branched alkylene radical of 6-12 carbon atoms in such amounts that the resulting reaction<br><br>
product has no free -NCO groups but free OH groups, then further reacting with a cycloaliphatic diisocyanate of 10 to 40 carbon atoms in such amounts that the resulting reaction product has free NCO groups, and then reacting with a diol of the formula (V) in such amounts that the resulting reaction product (component B) has no free NCO groups. This embodiment thus utilizes a mixture of diisocyanates and first reacts the diol with a deficiency of diisocyanate and then with an excess of another diisocyanate and subsequently free NCO groups with another diol (formula V). This preferred embodiment is likewise subject to the above statements with regard to the preferred structures for diisocyanates and diols.<br>
The reaction of diisocyanates with diols which leads to a component B can be carried out according to generally known methods for preparing polyurethanes, for example as a reaction in an organic solvent. As with the preparation of component A, useful solvents include ketone's which are later easy to remove by distillation, eg. methyl isobutyl ketone. It is advantageous for the solvent to be easily removable because compositions according to the invention are advantageously used in the form of solvent-free aqueous dispersions when used for treating fiber materials.<br>
Oligo- or polyurethanes useful as component B are described in EP-A 348 350. and a particularly useful process for preparing useful oligo- or polyurethanes is revealed in EP-A 459 125. This process may be used in a similar manner to prepare component B in compositions according to the invention.<br>
It has been found that (non-inventive) compositions in the form of aqueous dispersions which include a component A but no component B do provide a certain level of oil and water repellent performance, but the performance is not satisfactory in every respect. The same is true of compositions which include a component B but no component A. One disadvantage with the former is that it is frequently difficult to obtain a stable aqueous dispersion of component A with nonionic dispersants only. Yet aqueous dispersions are very desirable when component A is to be used for the oil and/or water repellent finishing of textile sheet materials. True, it is possible to obtain stable aqueous dispersions of component A with ionic, for example cationic, dispersants. But this frequently results in the disadvantage that the finished textiles have an increased tendency to deteriorate in performance on abrasion. The reason for this is that abrading will also remove finish<br><br>
(mechanically)-from the textile surface. The result is that the oil/water repellency can decrease significantly in the use of the textiles. Moreover, cationic dispersions of component A are not optimal with regard to LAD (laundry air dry) effects, especially on synthetic fiber fabrics. Good LAD effects, ie. post-laundry shape stability of textiles without post-laundry ironing, are desirable because the textiles can be air-dried after laundering without any need for ironing. The textiles retain their original shape on air drying when the finish imparts a good LAD effect. However, it has been determined that aqueous dispersions of component A (without a component B) lead to good LAD values when the dispersions include only nonionic dispersants, ie. in particular no cationic dispersants. However, such dispersants are frequently stable only for a short time, if at all. Aqueous dispersions which include a component B but no component A have the disadvantage that, although they impart good oil and water repellency when component B contains RF groups, ie. was prepared from a diol of the formula (II), (III) or of one of the formulae (VII) to (XI), they are not optimal with regard to the LAD performance of the finished textiles.<br>
It has now been found that, surprisingly, a combination of components A and B eliminates the disadvantages described. Such a combination, which constitutes the essence of the present invention, provides for the positive properties of component A and of component B to be preserved and frequently even improved. Compositions according to the invention provide in many cases better results with regard to durability of the effects on abrasion, LAD and oil and water repellency than either of the two components A and B alone. Compositions according to the invention provide cotton fiber materials with very good LAD and abrasion resistance performance even when they include ionic, for example cationic, dispersants. By contrast, the LAD and abrasion resistance performance of fabrics composed of synthetic fibers and of synthetic/cotton blends is not optimal in all cases when ionic, especially cationic, dispersants are present. For this reason, aqueous dispersions of compositions according to the invention preferably do not include ionic dispersants, but only nonionic dispersants. This is because in this case they are very useful for treating all kinds of fiber materials, not only cotton but also synthetics or fiber blends. Oil and water repellency, LAD performance and abrasion resistance, ie. resistance of the effects to abrasion, are very good from the use of such nonionic compositions. Although an aqueous dispersion which includes component A but no component B will in many cases only be stable when a cationic dispersant is used, it has been determined that, surprisingly, an<br><br>
aqueous dispersion which includes both A and B is obtainable with high stability even from an exclusively nonionic dispersing system. This applies in particular when the dispersing is effected using the preferred process indicated hereinbelow and in claim 12 (conjoint dispersing of A and B).<br>
Useful nonionic dispersants include surface-active compounds known from the technical, literature, for example ethoxylated phenols, carboxylic acids, etc. Useful propoxylated or ethoxylated/propoxylated dispersants (block or random copolymers) have likewise been described in the technical literature. Instead of a single dispersant it is also possible to use a mixture of nonionic dispersants. Particularly useful dispersants for compositions according to the invention in the form of aqueous dispersions are ethoxylated alcohols of the formula<br>
  H. Here R1 is a linear or branched alkyl radical of 6 to 22 carbon<br>
atoms and n is from 4 to 14.<br>
Aqueous dispersions of compositions according to the invention that include further ingredients, for example those of the kind mentioned hereinbelow, may for this reason benefit from the presence of certain fractions of ionic surface-active compounds, either as dispersants or as liquor stabilizers. An example of this is a composition according to the invention that is prepared by first preparing an aqueous dispersion of components A and B by using nonionic dispersants exclusively and then adding an aqueous dispersion of an acrylate polymer having RF groups. Such aqueous RF-acrylate dispersions may be commercially available products, which are frequently prepared using cationic dispersants. Useful liquor stabilizers are amphoteric dispersants such as amine oxides or pyrazoline-betaines. When ionic dispersants are used at all to prepare aqueous dispersions of compositions according to the invention, they should only be added subsequently to a stable nonionic dispersion and not in the course of the production of a dispersion of components A and B.<br>
In compositions according to the invention that, in addition to the preferred nonionic dispersants, also contain cationic dispersants, for example because of a subsequent addition of a ready-prepared cationic RF-acrylate dispersion, the amount of cationic dispersant should be minimized so as not to risk any deterioration in LAD and abrasion resistance. The subsequent addition of an aqueous dispersion of an acrylic polymer which contains RF groups can be contemplated in particular when component B is an oligo- or polyurethane which contains no fluorinated radicals (RF groups). In this case, it can be<br><br>
advantageous-to add an RF-acrylic polymer dispersion. This raises the level of fluorine in the composition of the invention and hence also the level of oil/water repellency.<br>
Compositions according to the invention that are not in the form of aqueous dispersions may be prepared by simply mixing the components A and B and optionally further components.<br>
Aqueous dispersions of compositions according to the invention may be prepared according to various methods.<br>
One possibility is to prepare separately a first aqueous dispersion which includes component A but not component B and a second aqueous dispersion which includes B but not A, and then to combine these first and second dispersions. Both the first dispersion and the second dispersion may additionally include further components, for example the hereinbelow m'ore particularly described components C or D, 1,2-propylene glycol and/or a soft hand agent and/or a cellulose crosslinker or else further RF-containing esters or urethanes. Preferably, for the reasons mentioned, both the first and the second aqueous dispersion are free of ionic dispersants, particularly cationic dispersants. In the individual case, however, either of the two may contain a minor amount of a liquor stabilizer of the abovementioned kind. However, a liquor stabilizer and/or further components may also be added after the first and second dispersions have been combined. These components, added only subsequently to the ready-produced dispersion including A and B, may again be of the abovementioned kind. It is advantageous in particular, when this process of preparation is used, for the dispersion created by combining two separate dispersions to include a component C. This component C may be added by adding C either to the first or to the second dispersion or, preferably, only to the ready-produced dispersion created on combining. Component C is an acrylic acid or methacrylic acid homopolymer or copolymer which contains one or more perfluorinated radicals RFI or RF2 and is more particularly described hereinbelow. It can be added in the form of the pure polymer, but it is preferable to use a ready-produced aqueous dispersion of the Rp acrylic polymer. The reason why it is preferable for a composition according to the invention to additionally include an RF-acrylic polymer when the components A and B are dispersed separately is that it has been determined that aqueous dispersions which include a component A but no component B are not very stable when no ionic dispersants are used. On mixing such a dispersion of component A with a likewise exclusively nonionic dispersion of component B, the<br><br>
composition obtained is likewise not very stable when component B contains perfluorinated radicals RF. However, when a nonionic dispersion of B does not contain perfluorinated radicals RF, then the stability of the resulting dispersion, which contains both A and B, is substantially increased. When using the production process where a dispersion of A is prepared separately from a dispersion of B and these dispersions are then combined, it is accordingly advantageous in some cases for stability reasons for component B to be an RF-free oligo- or polyurethane. Such an RF-free urethane is preparable by reacting a diisocyanate or diisocyanate mixture of the formula (XIII) with a diol or diol mixture of the formulae (IV), (V), (VI) or (XII). but not of the formula (II) or (III) or of the formulae (VII) to (XI). However, in order that such a dispersion, including an RF-free component B, may provide an optimum oil and water repellency performance, it is preferable to raise the fluorine content of the dispersion by adding a component C. Also, the composition thus obtained frequently has improved stability in the form of an aqueous dispersion.<br>
Although the aforementioned process of separately dispersing component A and component B provides compositions of the invention that are of high quality, a preferred process for preparing compositions according to the invention in the form of aqueous dispersions comprises preparing a mixture of the components A and B which optionally additionally includes an organic solvent and/or a component D, dispersing this mixture in water using a nonionic dispersant or dispersant mixture without using an anionic or cationic dispersant and then optionally removing the organic solvent and optionally adding further components.<br>
It has been determined that compositions according to the invention in the form of aqueous dispersions prepared by this process of conjoint dispersing frequently represent an improvement even over compositions obtained by separate dispersing of A and B. This improvement takes the form in particular of an even further reduced tendency for reduced performance on abrasion and a further improved LAD performance. The reason for this difference between separate and conjoint dispersing is not known; the reason could be that a nonionic dispersion of component A, as used in the separate dispersing process, does not have a particularly high stability, whereas a separate nonionic dispersion of component A is never present in the preferred process of conjoint dispersing. It is accordingly possible that conjoint dispersing confers a different character on the disperse phase and that this character has an effect on the performance level of the finished textile. Accordingly, the<br><br>
preferred process for preparing compositions according to the invention is the process mentioned above and in claim 12, and among the compositions according to the invention that are in the form of aqueous dispersions, preference is given to those which are obtainable by this process.<br>
This preferred process of conjoint dispersing is likewise preferably carried out using not . ionic, especially not cationic, dispersants, but only nonionic dispersants. The dispersants may be added to the mixture of components A and B prior to dispersing, so that this dispersant-containing mixture is dispersed in pure water. However, it is also possible - and frequently of advantage - to add the dispersant to the water prior to dispersing and to stir a dispersant-free mixture of components A and B into this dispersant-containing water. In place of a single nonionic dispersant, it is also possible to use a mixture of nonionic dispersants. Dispersing may be effected according to known methods by stirring and subsequent hdmogenization at room temperature or elevated temperature. Both the mixture of components A and B and the water may contain further components, for example those mentioned above for the case of separate dispersing, prior to the dispersing step. It is also possible for the mixture of components A and B to additionally include an organic solvent in which A and B are soluble, for example a low molecular weight aliphatic ketone. Use of an organic solvent can facilitate the handling of the mixture of A and B. Any organic solvent present is preferably removed again, for example by distillation, after the mixture has been dispersed in water. If it is desired for a composition according to the invention, as well as components A and B and dispersants, to include further components, these can be added to the mixture of A and B or to the water not just before the dispersing step. It is also possible to add one or more further components only after the mixture of A and B has been dispersed.<br>
The preferred process of conjoint dispersing is likewise advantageously carried out using nonionic dispersants of the kind already described above, namely ethoxylated alcohols of the formula A single such alcohol may be used, or a mixture of<br>
such alcohols. R1 as observed above, is a linear or branched alkyl radical of 6 to 22 carbon atoms and n is from 4 to 40. However, other nonionic dispersants of the abovementioned kind are also very suitable.<br><br>
Compositions "according to the invention include component A and component B advantageously in such amounts that the weight ratio of A to B is in the range from 1:10 to 5:1. Preference is given to a ratio of 1:1 to 5:1. For the preferred process of conjoint dispersing, therefore, the mixture of components A and B to be dispersed preferably includes these two components in the stated ratio. Compositions according to the invention in the form of aqueous dispersions further include preferably 10 to 50%, especially 10 -35%, by weight of the sum total of components A and B. This statement relates to the total weight of the dispersion without organic solvent, ie. to the weight of the dispersion after any organic solvent previously present has been removed. The specified range from 10 to 35% constitutes the optimal range with regard to performance and economic factors. An assay of less than 10% by weight for the sum total of components A and B does not in the individual case ensure that the performance of the oil/water repellent finish on the textile is up to the required level. An assay of more than 50% by weight normally does not provide for a<br>
relevant increase in performance, but the costs for the compositions increase.<br>
«<br>
Compositions according to the invention may, as well as components A and B, include further components. Examples of such components are soft hand agents, cellulose crosslinkers and flame retardants of the type customary in the textile finishing industry. Compositions according to the invention, as well as components A and B, preferably include in addition one or more of the hereinbelow described components C and D and 1,2-propylene glycol. 1,2-Propylene glycol may be used as a stabilizer for aqueous dispersions or liquors. If aqueous dispersions of compositions according to the invention are to include further components apart from A and B, these may be added before or after the dispersing step. It is possible in the case of the aforementioned separate dispersing of components A and B to add the additional components either to component A or to component B prior to their dispersing or to one of the separately prepared aqueous dispersions. It is also possible to add these additional components only after the separately prepared dispersions of A and B have been combined. In the case of the separate preparation of a dispersion each of component A and of component B, it is frequently of advantage to add additional components only after the two dispersions have been combined. If a component D is to be used, however, it can be of advantage for the separately prepared dispersion of component B to already include this component D. In the preferred process of the conjoint dispersing of component A and component B it is of advantage for the mixture of A and B not to include any further components apart from any<br><br>
component D and any organic solvent before the dispersing step. In this case, the dispersant or dispersant mixture is added to the water into which is stirred the mixture which contains components A and B and any component D and organic solvent. Preferably, further components are not added until after this mixture has been dispersed.<br><br>
Component D is a diisocyanate or a polyisocyanate whose NCO groups are blocked. It is known to use such blocked polyfunctional isocyanates as extenders in textile finishing. The use of these extenders in combination with fluoropolymers makes it possible to increase the level and durability of the oil and water repellent performance.<br>
Useful diisocyanates for preparing a component D are the same diisocyanates as described above in connection with the preparation of component B. Useful polyisocyanates, ie. compounds having more than two NCO groups, are compounds which differ from the<br><br>
diisocyanatesTnentioned in that one or more C-H linkages in these diisocyanates are<br>
replaced by C-N=C=0 linkages. These C-H linkages which are replaced by C-N=C=0 can<br>
be aliphatic or aromatic C-H linkages.<br>
Useful blocking agents for the -NCO groups are the same as mentioned above in<br>
connection with component B. The isocyanate groups in component D are preferably<br>
blocked by ketone oximes, eg. by butanone oxime. Blocking is preferably complete, so that<br>
component D has no analytically detectable free isocyanate groups.<br>
Extender products useful as component D are described in European Patent Application<br>
No. 98124501.2 (date of filing: December 22, 1998) and also in EP-A 196 309.<br>
EP-A 537 578 and EP-A 872 503.<br>
The di- or pojyisocyanates with blocked isocyanate groups that are useful as component D<br>
may also be polymers, especially polyurethanes having blocked isocyanate groups. Such<br>
polyurethanes are obtainable by reacting polyfunctional isocyanates with polyhydric<br>
alcohols using'an excess of isocyanate groups over alcoholic OH groups and subsequently<br>
«<br>
blocking the free isocyanate groups left in the polyurethane. An example of such a polyurethane is a product obtainable by blocking free isocyanate groups in DESMODUR L75 from Bayer. Another example is Bayer's Baygard EDW, a polyurethane based on an aromatic diisocyanate and 1,1.1-trimethylolpropane and whose isocyanate groups are blocked by a ketone oxime. Also useful is a polyurethane obtainable by reacting an excess of diphenylemethane 4,4'-diisocyanate with a mixture of mono-, di- and tripropylene glycol, then further reacting with 1,1,1-trimethylolpropane and N-methyldiethanolamine and blocking the free NCO groups with butanone oxime. Further useful polyurethanes are obtainable by reacting an excess of a diisocyanate or diisocyanate mixture of the abovementioned formula (XIII) with a diol or diol mixture, for example of the formula (V), (Vl) or (XII), and then blocking the free isocyanate groups.<br>
Component D may be added in pure form or in the form of an aqueous dispersion to a ready-prepared aqueous dispersion of components A and B. When the above-described process of conjointly dispersing components A and B is used, however, it is preferable to add component D to the mixture of A and B prior to dispersing. When the mixture of components A and B is present in the form of a solution in an organic solvent, it is advantageous for component D also to be used in the form of a solution in an organic solvent. It is also possible, to prepare compositions according to the invention by preparing component D directly in a reaction mixture already containing component B. This can be<br><br>
accomplishedrfor example, by reacting a diisocyanate with a diol in an organic solvent to form a component B, then (to prepare component D) again adding diisocyanate and diol, using an excess of diisocyanate, and subsequently blocking the free NCO groups of the resulting polyurethane using a ketone oxime. In this process, the first diisocyanate used for preparing component B can be the same as or different to that from which component D is formed. The resulting solution of B and D in an organic solvent is then preferably combioed with a component A, which may likewise be present as a solute in an organic solvent. The mixture of A, B and D can then be stirred into water which contains a nonionic dispersant and the organic solvent removed by distillation to obtain a stable aqueous dispersion of components A, B and D. Subsequently, if desired, further components of the abovementioned kind may be added.<br><br>
Compositions according to the invention, especially in the form of aqueous dispersions, provide very good oil and water repellent effects on fiber materials, especially textile sheet materials such as wovens or knits. It is similarly possible to thereby obtain textiles which combine good LAD performance with little if any tendency to deteriorate in performance on abrasion. The oil and water repellent performance of these textiles shows little if any deterioration in use, whereas prior art textiles frequently provide poorer oil and water repeliency after use or abrasion. This is believed to be explained by mechanical abrasion also removing some of the fluoropolymer from the textile surface. Textiles advantageously finishable with compositions of the invention include cover fabrics for furniture and motorized vehicle seats. Compositions according to the invention provide advantageous finishes on textiles composed of a wide variety of fiber materials, preferably textiles which<br><br>
are 50 to 100% synthetic polymer, especially polyester, polyacrylonitrile and/or polyamide, and 0 to 50% by weight native fiber, especially cellulose.<br>
Aqueous dispersions of compositions according to the invention can be applied to textile sheet materials according to known methods, for example by pad-mangiing. The concentration of the finishing liquor and the finishing conditions are preferably set so that, after drying, the textiles have a fluorine add-on of 0.05 to 1.5% by weight, preferably 0.1 to 0.9%, based on the total weight of the dried textile and reckoned as % by weight of F. Application by padding is followed in a conventional manner by squeezing off and drying, for example at 100 to 120°C for 5 to 15 minutes. It is frequently advantageous to additionally treat the dried textiles at a higher temperature, for example at 130°C to 1 SOX for 0.5 to 10 minutes.<br>
Illustrative embodiments of the invention will now be more particularly described.<br>
■<br>
Example 1<br>
a)	Preparation of a component A:<br>
In a three-neck flask equipped with stirrer, thermometer and oil bath, a mixture of 0.5 mol (87 g) of dimethyl adipate and 0.5 mol (600 g) of a diol of the formula II of claim 1 (where X = -S-, c=1, b=2, h = predominantly 7 to 11) was heated to 100°C and stirred at lOO°C until all solid fractions had disappeared. 8.5 g of a 70% aqueous solution of methanesulfonic acid were then added as transesterification catalyst. The mixture was heated to 1 lO°C. at which point the pressure was gradually reduced. After the onset of the distillative removal of the methanol formed, the distillation was continued at 150 to 200 mbar and 110°C for 5 hours. About 24 g of distillate were obtained. Cooling gave 660 g of a solid product (component A), which was dissolved in about 830 g of methyl isobutyl ketone for better handling.<br>
b)	Preparation of a nonionic aqueous dispersion of a component A<br>
225 g of a 65°C solution prepared according to Example 1a) were stirred by means of a high speed stirrer into a 65°C mixture containing 306 g of water, 10 g of an<br><br>
ethoxylated (10 EO) isotridecyl alcohol and 13 g of 1,2-propylene glycol. A high pressure homogenization at 60°C provided a dispersion, from which the methyl isobutyl ketone solvent was removed by distillation at 70°C under reduced pressure. The resulting dispersion was diluted with water to a concentration of 20% by weight. The result was a slightly bluish milky dispersion (emulsion) ("dispersion 1").<br>
Example 2<br>
a)	Preparation of a component B<br>
320 g (0.267 mol) of the diol of the formula II which was also used in Example 1a, 44.5 g (0.212 mol) of trimethyihexamethylene 1,6-diisocyanate (mixed isomers) and 633 g of methyl isobutyl ketone were mixed and heated to 65°C with stirring.<br>
After everything had gone into solution, 0.08 g of triethylamine and 0.3 g of dibutyltin dilaurate were added (both in the form of a solution in methyl isobutyl ketone). The mixture was stirred at 85°C until NCO groups were no longer analytically detectable and then adjusted to 50°C. 105 g (0.17 mol) of DDI-1410 diisocyanate (structure see text of the description) and 13.6 g (0.23 mol) of N-methyldiethanolamine were added in succession with vigorous stirring, and stirred at 85°C until isocyanate groups were no longer detectable.<br>
The product obtained was diluted with methyl isobutyl ketone to an active concentration of 36.2% by weight.<br>
To 1333 g of a polyurethane solution thus prepared were added, for the purpose of preparing a component D, 65.1 g of butanone oxime and 231 g of Desmodur L 75 (polyurethane from Bayer with free isocyanate groups). The mixture was stirred at 62°C until free NCO groups were no longer detectable (about 20 minutes).<br>
b)	Preparation of a nonionic aqueous dispersion which includes a component B and a<br>
component D.<br>
200 g of the mixture prepared according to Example 2a. which contained a component B and a component D, were added with vigorous stirring at 65°C to a solution of 8.8 g of an ethoxylated (10 EO) isotridecanol and 11.8 g of 1,2-propylene glycol in 268 g of water. The pH of the mixture obtained was adjusted to 2.8 with hydrochloric acid, and<br><br>
the dispersion was subjected to a high pressure homogenization at 65°C. Removing 203 g of a solvent/water mixture at 70°C under reduced pressure (270-350 mbar) left 269 g of a dispersion having a concentration of 32.4%, which was diluted with water to a concentration of 25.2%. This provided a slightly yellowish milky dispersion (= "dispersion 2").<br>
Example 3<br>
Preparation of a composition according to the invention by combining an aqueous dispersion of component A with a separately prepared aqueous dispersion of component B. 167.3 g of an aqueous dispersion prepared according to Example lb (dispersion 1) were combined with 132.7 g of an aqueous dispersion prepared according to Example 2b (dispersion 2) to obtain 300 g of a "dispersion 3".<br>
Example 4<br>

The process specified in claim 11 was used to prepare an aqueous dispersion ("dispersion 4") as follows:<br>
A solution of 57.2 g of an ester (component A) prepared according to Example la in 72.8 g of methyl isobutyl ketone (which solution had a temperature of about 70°C) was thoroughly mixed with 295.5 g of a solution prepared according to Example 2a. This second solution was at about 65°C and, in addition to 165.5 g of methyl isobutyl ketone, contained 130 g of the product mixture (which contained components B and D) formed in the course of the reaction according to Example 2a.<br>
The thusly prepared solution of components A, B and D in methyl isobutyl ketone was added with thorough stirring to a solution of 15.3 g of 1,2-propylene glycol and 11.5 g of ethoxylated alcohol in 281 g of water. The ethoxylated alcohol was the same as in Examples lb and 2b. The pH was then adjusted to 2.7 with hydrochloric acid and the resulting dispersion subjected to a high pressure homogenization. Distillative removal of the<br><br>
methyl isobutyl ketone and dilution with water to a concentration of 25.5% provided dispersion 4, a slightly yellowish milky dispersion.<br>

A high pressure homogenization at 60°C provided a dispersion, from which the methyl isobutyl ketone solvent was removed by distillation at 70°C under reduced pressure. The resulting dispersion was diluted with water to a concentration of 20% by weight. The result was a slightly bluish milky dispersion (emulsion) ("dispersion 5").<br>

273 g (0.267 mol) of the diol of the formula (VII) which was also used in Example 5a, 44.5 g (0.212 mol) of trimethylhexamethylene 1,6-diisocyanate (mixed isomers) and 633 g of'methyl isobutyl ketone were mixed and heated to 65°C with stirring.<br>
m t<br>
After everything had gone into solution, 0.08 g of triethylamine and 0.3 g of dibutyltin dilaurate were added (both in the form of a solution in methyl isobutyl ketone). The mixture was stirred at 85°C until NCO groups were no longer analytically detectable and then adjusted to 50°C- 105 g (0.17 mol) of DDI-1410 diisocyanate (structure see text of the description) and 13.6 g (0.23 mol) of N-methyldiethanolamine were added in succession with vigorous stirring, and stirred at 85°C until isocyanate groups were no longer detectable.<br>

To 1333 g of a polyurethane solution thus prepared were added, for the purpose of preparing a component D, 65.1 g of butanone oxime and 231 g of Desmodur L 75 (polyurethane from Bayer with free isocyanate groups). The mixture was stirred at 60°C until free NCO groups were no longer detectable (about 20 minutes).<br>
b)	Preparation of a component B<br>
305 g (0.267 mol) of the diol of the formula (Vlll) which was also used in Example 5b, 44.5 g (0.212 mol) of trimethylhexamethylene 1,6-diisocyanate (mixed isomers) and 633 g of methyl isobutyl ketone were mixed and heated to 65°C with stirring.<br><br>
After everything had gone into solution, 0.08 g of triethylamine and 0.3 g of dibutyltin dilaurate were added (both in the form of a solution in methyl isobutyl ketone). The mixture was stirred at 85°C until NCO groups were no longer analytically detectable and then adjusted to 50°C  105 g (0.17 mol) of DDI-1410 diisocyanate (structure see text of the description) and 13.6 g (0.23 mol) of N-methyldiethanolamine were added in succession with vigorous stirring, and stirred at 85°C until isocyanate groups were no longer detectable.<br>

The mixture was stirred at 60°C until free NCO groups were no longer detectable (about 20 minutes).<br>
c)     Preparation of a nonionic aqueous dispersion which includes a component B and a component D.<br>
200 g of the mixture prepared according to Example 6a, which contained a component B and a component D, were added with vigorous stirring at 65°C to a solution of 8.8 g of an ethoxylated (10 EO) isotridecanol and 11.8 g of 1,2-propylene glycol in 268 g of water. The pH of the mixture obtained was adjusted to 2.8 with hydrochloric acid, and the dispersion was subjected to a high pressure homogenization at 65'C. Removing 203 g of a solvent/water mixture at 70°C under reduced pressure (270-350 mbar) left 269 g of a dispersion having a concentration of 32.4%, which was diluted with water to a concentration of 25.2%. This provided a slightly yellowish milky dispersion (= "dispersion 6").<br>
Example 7<br>
Preparation of a composition according to the invention by combining an aqueous dispersion of component A with a separately prepared aqueous dispersion of component 8. 167.3 g of an aqueous dispersion prepared according to Example 5c (dispersion 5) were combined with 132.7 g of an aqueous dispersion prepared according to Example 6c (dispersion 6) to obtain 300 g of a "dispersion 7".<br><br>
Example 8<br>
Preparation of a composition according to the invention by conjointly dispersing a component A, a component B and a component D.<br>
The process specified in claim 12 was used to prepare an aqueous dispersion ("dispersion 8") as follows:<br>
A solution of 130 g of an ester (component A) prepared according to Example 5a in 150 g of methyl isobutyl ketone (which solution had a temperature of about ZO^'C) was thoroughly mixed with 295.5 g of a solution prepared according to Example 6a. This second solution was at about 65°C and, in addition to 165.5 g of methyl isobutyl ketone, contained 130 g of the product mfxture (which contained components B and D) formed in the course of the reaction according to Example 6a.<br>
The thusly prepared solution of components A, B and D in methyl isobutyl ketone was added with thorough stirring to a solution of 15.3 g of 1,2-propylene glycol and 11.5 g of ethoxylated alcohol in 281 g of water. The ethoxylated alcohol was the same as in Examples 5c and 6c. The pH was then adjusted to 2.7 with hydrochloric acid and the resulting dispersion subjected to a high pressure homogenization. Distillative removal of the methyl isobutyl ketone and dilution with water to a concentration of 26% provided dispersion 8, a slightly yellowish milky dispersion.<br>
Finishing tests<br>
Liquors each comprising one of the dispersions 1 to 8 were used to treat textile fabrics. Dispersions 3 and 4 obtained in Examples 3 and 4 and dispersions 7 and 8 obtained in Examples 7 and 8 contained not only a component A but also a component B and thus constituted compositions according to the invention. Dispersion 1 of Example lb and dispersion 2 of Example 2b and also dispersions 5 and 6 of respectively Examples 5c and 6c, by contrast, each contained only one of the components A and B and thus were not compositions according to the invention, but only comparatives. Dispersions 3 and 7 were prepared by the process of separately dispersing the components A and B and combining<br><br>
the separatelyprepared aqueous dispersions, while dispersions 4 and 8 were prepared by the particularly preferred process of conjoint dispersing.<br>
The liquors used for the subsequent finishing examples 9 to 16 each contained 1 g/1 of 60% acetic acid, 5 g/1 of a wetting agent (the same wetting agent in ail examples, comprising a mixture of ethoxylated products as well as water) and the hereinbelow indicated amounts of dispersions 1 to 8.<br><br><br><br>
The differences in the amounts of dispersions 1 to 4 included in liquors 9 to 12 are the result of the liquors being made up in such a way that they all contain the same amount of fluorine (in % by weight), namely 4.55% by weight of F, in order to provide better comparability of the oil and water repellency effects on the textiles.<br>
The differences in the amounts of dispersions 5 to 8 included in liquors 13 to 16 are the result of the liquors being made up in such a way that they all contain the same amount of fluorine (in % by weight), namely 5.5 g of F/l of liquor, in order to provide better comparability of the oil and water repellency effects on the textiles.<br>
Each of liquors 9 to 16 was used to treat 4 different types of fabric. They were applied by pad-mangling. The wet pickup differed from fabric to fabric, whereas there were hardly any differences between the liquors. The wet pickup in % weight increase (based on untreated fabric weight) after squeezing off is reported hereinbelow for each kind of fabric. After pad-mangling, each fabric sample was dried at 110°C for 15 minutes and then cured at 150°C for 5 minutes.<br><br><br><br>
After the above-specified treatment, the water repellency and the oil repellency of the fabric samples were determined according to the methods specified hereinbelow. The oil repellency was determined directly on the fabric as obtained after the above-described  . treatment (the respective data are identified by "Original" in the table below) and also after the substrate has been abraded using 5 back and forth rubs and after it has been abraded using 10 back and forth rubs. The abraded oil repellency provides information about the durability of the oil repellency performance after use of or mechanical insults to the textile. The abrading of the finished fabric samples was carried out by means of a crockmeter as specified in AATCC Test Method 8-1996 (which corresponds to ISO 105 - X 12). This crockmeter was armed with abrasive paper. Using this apparatus, the fabric samples were abraded using'5 or 10 back and forth rubs. The determination of the oil repellent properties was repeated after this abrading.<br>
Oil repellency was determined using AATCC Test Method 118-1997 (which corresponds to ISO 14419). This test method is based on the resistance of the finished fabric to wetting by a number of liquid hydrocarbons of varying surface tensions. The oil repellent effect is given a numerical rating; the higher the number, the better the oil repellency.<br>
The water repellency of the finished fabrics was determined by means of the spray test described in AATCC Test Method 22-1996 (which corresponds to ISO 4920). The wetting of the fabric sample by sprayed-on water is visually rated. The most effective water repellency corresponds to a rating of 100, and the least effective to a rating of 0. The hereinbelow recited table reports  3 ratings for each spray test, which correspond to the ratings of three successive spray tests (without the fabrics drying in between).<br>
Tables 1 and 2 below show the results of the tests.<br>
The tables reveal that Examples 11, 12, 15 and 16 according to the invention lead<br>
altogether to better results than Examples 9, 10, 13 and 14.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
