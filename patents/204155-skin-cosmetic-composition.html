1. TITLE OF INVENTION<br>
SKIN COSMETIC COMPOSITION<br>
2. HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai - 400 020, Maharashtra, India, a company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1913<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
Cosmetic compositions for human skin containing  a dextran or maltodextrin and a weak carboxylic acid.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Cosmetic products which improve the appearance of skin are increasingly popular with consumers. Frequently, consumers seek to alleviate or delay the signs of aged or photoaged skin, such as fine lines and wrinkles, dry and sagging skin. Consumers also seek other benefits in addition to anti-aging.<br>
Some ingredients used in topical products are potentially irritating, especially to people with "sensitive skin." Such irritation is commonly perceived as sting or burning.<br>
As an example, hydroxy acids and several other weak carboxylic acids have been proven to deliver cosmetic benefits, such as improvement in the appearance of photodamaged or naturally aged skin, skin lightening, treatment of age spots, etc. Unfortunately, their use at high concentrations may occasionally be associated with skin irritation, e.g. skin redness and stinging sensation upon application.  For aesthetic reasons, these actives are most often delivered as oil-in-water  emulsions. Practically, the final composition pH should be higher than 3 in order to prevent deleterious effects to skin tissues and unacceptable levels of irritation. Water soluble weak acids when<br><br>
delivered from an oil-in-water emulsion at acidic pH often induce high levels of sting.  The sting occurs immediately after application, reaches a maximum intensity usually by 5-8 minutes after application and then begins to reduce in intensity.<br>
The irritation can be ameliorated by lowering the amount of an active ingredient in the composition or by reducing the active's penetration through the skin.  A serious drawback of both approaches is that the efficacy is impaired.  The weak acid related irritation can be reduced by raising the composition's pH but this method yields reduced efficacy due to a decreased acid penetration through the skin.  It is desirable to reduce or eliminate the irritation potential of weak acids while maintaining their efficacy.<br>
The need exists, therefore, for a composition and method that prevents or reduces the skin irritation.<br>
Coury et al. (US Patent 5,618,850) discloses cosmetic compositions containing polyhydroxy acids conjugated to the dextran polymer. EP 691126 (Beiersdorf) discloses cosmetic compositions with low stinging potential for treatment of sensitive skin. The compositions contain pigment to sequester AHA. A serious shortcoming of the Coury and Beirsdorf disclosures is that conjugation or sequestration significantly reduces delivery of the active and its efficacy. Most actives in current use have molecular weight less than 1000 Dalton. The penetration of actives through the skin decreases strongly with its molecular weight (Ref: Transdermal Delivery of Drugs; Volume III, P 7-8. Agis F.<br><br>
Kydonieus and Bret Berner (ed) CRC Press, Inc Boca Raton, Fl , 1987) . Polymers have high (&gt;&gt;1000 Dalton) molecular weight.  Conjugation of actives with the polymer Dextran will make it a high molecular weight molecule and hence will significantly lower penetration.<br>
Sequestration of the weak acid will reduce the amount of acid that would be available for delivery.<br>
Another approach to lower the sting is to formulate the acid with a strong alkali metal base.  Yu et al. (U.S. patent 4,105,783) suggested the use of ammonium hydroxide or an organic base. Unfortunately, this method raises the pH of the composition and reduces the ability of the weak acid to penetrate the skin, thus lowering its efficacy (see Sah et al.  in J.   Cosmet.   Sci.   49,   257-273,   1998).<br>
A clear need exists for a cosmetic composition with a weak acid that reduces sting but does not reduce dermal delivery.<br>
Publication from LAREX (March 23, 1998) discloses the use of a polysaccharide (arabinogalactan) to increase the exfoliation performance of a skin care lotion containing alpha hydroxy acid by 80% and to do so without increased irritation. The present invention, however, aims to decrease irritation, rather than merely not increasing it.' It has been found, as part of the present invention, that other polysaccharides, dextran and maltodextrin, decrease irritation associated with the use of weak carboxylic acids, whereas arabinogalactan does not have this effect. Additionally, it has been found that dextran, unlike<br><br>
arabinogalactan, enhances the anti-aging efficacy of hydroxy acids.<br>
SUMMARY OP THE INVENTION<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a skin cosmetic composition comprising:<br>
(i)  from 0.5 to 20 % by weight of the composition of a<br>
dextran or maltodextrin; (ii) from 0.01 to 20 % by weight of the composition of a<br>
weak carboxylic acid having pKa of above about 2;<br>
and (iii)a cosmetically acceptable vehicle.<br>
The invention also includes cosmetic methods of stimulating collagen synthesis by fibroblasts and keratinocyte differentiation in the skin, by applying to the skin the inventive composition.<br>
The invention also includes a cosmetic method of treating or delaying aged, chronoaged, photoaged, dry, lined or wrinkled skin, increasing stratum corneum firmness and flexibility, improving skin tone, and generally increasing the quality of skin by applying to the skin the inventive composition.<br>
The invention further provides a method for reducing skin irritation caused by the topical application of a composition containing a weak carboxylic acid, the method comprising topically applying a dextran or maltodextrin in a cosmetically acceptable vehicle.  Thus, according to this<br><br>
inventive method, the dextran or maltodextrin may be co-present with a weak acid in the same composition, or it may be applied from a separate composition.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
All amounts are by weight of the oil-in-water emulsion, unless otherwise specified.<br>
The term "skin" as used herein includes the skin on the face, neck, chest, back, arms, armpits, hands and scalp.<br>
The terms "irritation," "sting," and "burn," "inflammation,", and "redness" as used herein are synonymous and are used interchangeably.<br>
The molecular weight is expressed in Dalton (D) . The numerical terms followed by letters "KD" denote molecular weight of a compound, to be read as the numerical term x 1,000 e.g. 10KD means molecular weight of 10,000 D) .<br>
Dextran<br>
Both dextran and maltodextrin are glucose homopolymers.<br>
Dextran is a beta-1,6-glucan with several glucose side chains, bound primarily to the main chain of the macromolecule through 1,3-linkages but, in part also by 1,4-and 1,2- linkages. On the average, 95% of the glucose residues are present in the main chain.  It is produced by certain bacteria from a nutrient medium containing<br><br>
saccharose.  The molecular weight of dextrans	generally<br>
ranges from 5 KD to 2,000 KD, preferably from	5 KD to 1,000<br>
KD, to maintain anti-iiritation efficacy, yet	to minimize<br>
increase in formulation viscosity.<br>
Maltodextrin<br>
Maltodextrins (C6H10O5)n • H2O (CAS Reg. No. 9050-36-6 are<br>
non-sweet nutritive saccharide polymers that consist of D-glucose units linked primarily by alpha-1,4-bonds, having a DE (Dextrose Equivalence) less than 20.  They are prepared as a white powder or concentrated solution by partial hydrolysis of corn starch with safe and suitable acids and/or enzymes.  The suitable source of maltodextrin is Maltrin® from Grain Processing Corp. Matrin® contains maltodextrin and corn syrup solids.<br>
The amount of dextran or maltodextrin in the inventive composition ranges from 0.5 to 20%, preferably from 1 to 15%, most preferably from 1 to 10% , by weight of the composition.<br>
Weak Carboxylic Acid<br>
A weak carboxylic acid suitable for use in the inventive compositions is an acid with dissociation constant, pKa, of above about 2.   Preferably, the pKa is above about 3, most preferably in the range of from about 3 to about 5.<br><br>
The concept of pKa<br>
An acid is a species having a tendency to lose a proton, while a base is a species having a tendency to accept a proton. Hence for every acid, HA, there is a conjugate base A":<br><br>
Thus, lactic acid-lactate ion is an example of a conjugate acid-base pair.<br>
Acids so defined can only manifest their properties by reacting with bases. In aqueous solutions, acids react with water, the latter acting as a base<br><br>
Quantitatively, the acid strength of HA, relative to the base strength of water is given by the equilibrium constant expression by the equation<br><br>
where parentheses denote molar concentrations.<br>
As almost all measurements are made in dilute aqueous solution, the concentration of water remains essentially<br>
constant and its activity can be taken as unity. Letting H<br>
represent the solvated proton, we have<br><br>
Ka =   [H+] [A- J / [HA] ,<br>
where K» is the acidic dissociation (or ionization) constant. This equation can be written in the form<br>
pKa =pH +log [HA]/[A-]<br>
where pKa   is the negative logarithm of Ka ,   and is equal to the pH at which the concentrations of HA and A are equal.<br>
pKa   for alpha hydroxy acids are generally between 2-4, for<br>
monocarboxylic acids between 3-5, for alpha amino acids between 2-3; for salicylic acid it is 3.0.<br>
The pKa of a weak water-soluble acid is obtained by<br>
titrating it with a strong base such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH) . The intercept at the midpoint of the titration, ie. the point at which 0.5 molar equivalents of base have been added, is numerically equal to the pKa of the acid.<br>
A procedure for' determining pKa for a known weak acid is as follows:<br>
Materials<br>
Sample of pure acid for which pKa  is  to be determined;   CO2 -<br>
free deionized distilled water   (prepared by boiling deionized distilled water for 5 minutes);   Commercial   0. 1N NaOH volumetric  standard,   certified to  0.1005-0.0995 N,   eg.<br><br>
Fisher Scientific SS276;  100-ml calibrated glass burette; 125-ml Erlenmeyer flask pH meter, eg. Corning Model 140 with standard combination electrode for pH; pH buffers, pH 4.00, 7.00, and 10.00, certified to ±0.01 pH unit at 25, eg. Fisher Scientific SB101, SB107, and SB115 magnetic stirrer<br>
Method<br>
Be sure all glassware and equipment  is clean.     Acid-wash if necessary.   Prepare at least 50 ml  of a 0.1 Normal  solution of the acid for which the pKa  is  to be determined in CO2-<br>
free distilled water.    Avoid introducing CO2 to the solution<br>
by avoiding excessive shaking.     Cap the final  solution until use.Calibrate the pH meter using three buffers,  pH 7.00,   3.00,   and 10.00,   according to pH meter manufacturer's instructions.    Rinse electrode with distilled water between samples.     Fill burette with 0.1 N NaOH standard solution. Add 50.0 ml of 0.1 N acid solution to 125-ml Erlenmeyer. Add stir bar to Erlenmeyer.<br>
Insert pH electrode into acid solution.     Position and secure electrode so that  it does not interfere with stir bar. Record initial pH.     Begin gentle stirring such that pH reading is not affected.     Position burette over flask to allow incremental addition of  0.1 N standard NaOH to 0.1 N acid solution.    Verify initial pH and begin incremental addition of base.     Record    the volumes of base  added and resulting pH readings.     Aim to record pH changes  of  0.2 to 0.3 units or volume increases of  about 5ml,   whichever comes first.     Continue incremental  additions until  at  least  60 ml<br><br>
of base have been added and the steep change in pH levels off.<br>
Plot the data with the volume of base as the x-axis and pH as the y-axis.  Plot the points observed and draw a smooth line through them.  Determine the volume of base added to obtain the equivalence point, i.e. the volume at which one normal- equivalent of base has been added and the acid has been completely neutralized:  When the steep portion of the curve is vertical, the equivalence point volume corresponds to the volume of base at the vertical portion of the curve. If the steep portion of the curve is not vertical, the equivalence point can be obtained by locating the volumes of the base at the two end points that bracket the steep change in pH.  The mean of the two volumes is the equivalence point.<br>
To determine the pKa, first locate the midpoint of the titration by halving (i.e. 4-2) the volume of base at equivalence point.  The midpoint of the titration is the point at which 0.5 normal-equivalents of base have been added, and the acid has been one-half (50%) neutralized. The pH corresponding to the midpoint of the titration is the<br>
pKa  of the acid.  This is the pH at which 50% of the acid<br>
has been neutralized, that is, and the molecule exists 50% in the non-ionized form and 50% as the anion.<br>
Examples of suitable weak carboxylic acids include but are not limited to: alpha- or beta-hydroxyacids, dicarboxylic acids, tricarboxylic acids, ascorbic acid, oxamic acid and<br><br>
mixtures thereof.  Preferred carboxylic acids, due to their anti-aging afficacy, are:<br>

The amount of weak acid in the inventive composition ranges from 0.01 to 20%, preferably from 1 to 15% and most preferably from 2 to 12%, by weight of the composition. At concentrations below 2% of the acid, there is minimal stinging and the anti-aging efficacy does not increase significantly above 12%.<br>
It is to be understood that depending on the pH of the composition, the acid may be present as a salt, e.g. ammonium or potassium or sodium salt.<br>
Although the inventive compositions may have any pH in  the general range of 2.5 to 10, the inventive compositions are particularly useful when they are at an acidic pH, preferably 3-6 and most preferably at a pH of 3-5, because such<br><br>

Although not limited to this category, general examples include additional anti-sebum ingredients and sunscreens.<br>
Sunscreens include those materials commonly employed to block ultraviolet light.  Illustrative compounds are the derivatives of PABA, cinnamate and salicylate.  For example, avobenzophenone (Parsol 1789®) octyl methoxycinnamate and 2-hydroxy-4-methoxy benzophenone (also known as oxybenzone) can be used. Octyl methoxycinnamate and 2-hydroxy-4-methoxy benzophenone are commercially available under the trademarks, Parsol MCX and Benzophenone-3, respectively.  The exact amount of sunscreen employed in the compositions can vary depending<br><br>
upon the degree of protection desired  from the sun's UV radiation.<br>
Preferably the cosmetic composition is protected against the growth of potentially harmful microorganisms.     Preservatives are,   therefore,   desirable.     Suitable preservatives include alkyl esters of p-hydroxybenzoic acid,   hydantoin derivatives, propionate salts,   and a variety of quaternary ammonium compounds.     Particularly preferred preservatives of this invention are methyl paraben,   propyl paraben,  phenoxyethanol and benzyl alcohol.     Preservatives will  usually be employed in amounts ranging from about  0.1% to 2% by weight of the composition.<br>
The composition according to the invention is intended primarily as a product for topical application to human skin, especially as an agent to improve the appearance of aged or photoaged skin.<br>
In use,   a quantity of  the composition,   for example from 1 to 100 ml,   is applied to exposed areas of the skin,   from a suitable container or applicator and,   if necessary,   it is then spread over and/or rubbed into the skin using the hand or fingers or a suitable device.<br>
Product Form and Packaging:<br>
The cosmetic skin composition of  the  invention can be in any form,   e.g.   formulated as a toner,   gel,   lotion,   a fluid cream, or a cream.     The composition can be packaged in a suitable container to suit  its viscosity and intended use by the<br><br>
consumer.  For example/ a lotion or fluid cream can be packaged in a bottle or a roll-ball applicator or a propel1ant-driven aerosol device or a container fitted with a pump suitable for finger operation. When the composition is a cream, it can simply be stored in a non-deformable bottle or squeeze container, such as a tube, or a lidded jar. The invention accordingly also provides a closed container containing a cosmetically acceptable composition as herein defined.<br>
The composition may also be included in capsules such as those described in U.S. Patent No. 5,063,057, incorporated by reference herein.<br>

EXAMPLE 1<br>
This example measured sting caused by formulations containing glycolic acid.<br><br>
Procedure for in-vivo sting test: This was a randomized, double blind study where each subject evaluated one test formulation and a control formulation or two test formulations on contralateral nasolabial folds.  During the qualification phase, each subject evaluated an 8% glycolic acid test versus a vehicle control (0% glycolic).  Subjects with established left/right balanced sensitivity to glycolic acid were qualified.  A maximum of 20 qualified subjects (minimum of 15) were utilized in each subsequent test.  One paired comparison was made on each testing day, with a minimum of 3 days between sting testing throughout the study. Subjects underwent a 15 second Ivory soap wash regime immediately prior to product testing for enhancing sting response.  Any subjects experiencing any stinging/burning on the test sites immediately prior to product application did not have products applied.  Study personnel then applied one test formulation and one control or test formulation simultaneously to the appropriate left/right test site, and gently but thoroughly rubbed in.  Subjects compared the stinging potential of the two formulations, over a 7.5 minute period using a self-assessment questionnaire.<br>
Sting/Burn Propensity:  The degree of stinging/burning felt on the left and right inner cheek and crease of the nose was evaluated using the following scale at the times indicated in Tables below:<br>
0 -no stinging / burning; 1 -very slight stinging / burning; 2 -slight stinging / burning; 3 - moderate stinging / burning; 4 -moderately high stinging / burning; 5 -high stinging / burning; 6 -extreme stinging / burning.<br><br>
Determination of Statistical Significance:  At each evaluation time point after baseline, the parametric paired t-test (two-tailed) was performed, to compare the extent of attribute chancre from baseline between each treatment comprising a paired comparison test, with subject acting as a block in these analyses. ' (Ref. Statistical Methods, Snedecor and Cochran, Iowa State University Press, 7th Edition, 1980, pp. 84-86]).  The test can be implemented using the SAS software procedure MEANS with the T and PRT options specified.<br>
Forced choice for stitiging/burning: At each evaluation point (0,2.5/5.0 and 7.5 min), the response to the forced choice assessment  "Which side of the face has more stinging?" was analysed as follows:  the number of subjects choosing treatment A was compared to the number of subjects choosing treatment B using a parametric paired t-test (2-tailed) . Statistical significance was determined at p £ 0.1. Results from several paired comparisons using this assessment method are shown (see later) in Tables IB, 2B, 3B and 4B.<br><br>

It can be seen from the results in Tables 1A-1C that 8% glycolic acid at pH 3.8  is significantly more stinging than either the base formulation or 4% glycolic acid. Although, sting can be reduced by increasing pH or lowering the active level, such changes in composition significantly affect dermal delivery and, consequently, the efficacy of the active.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
This example measured the effect of Dextran 10KD on glycolic acid sting at pH 3.8 in Base Formula A.  The in-vivo sting test and Base Formula A are described in Example 1.<br>
Base Formula A was prepared without the glycolic acid, base, and dextran.  The dextran was solubilized in a separate beaker containing glycolic acid + base (ammonium hydroxide) and a small level of water from the formulation (no more than 5% is needed)-- thus, the original Base Formula A was originally made with 5% less water.  The glycolic acid/dextran solution was then post added to the Base Formula A during the cool down stage (usually at a<br><br>
temperature of about 45oC).  The results that were obtained are summarized in Tables 2A, 2B and 2C.<br>

It can be seen from the results in Tables 2A and 2B that Dextran significantlly reduced the stinging/burning propensity of Base Formula A containing 8% glycolic acid. In Table 2C, the difference in the sting response of the two formulations was not statistically significant, leading to the conclusion that Dextran reduced the sting of 8% glycolic acid formulation to that of 4% glycolic acid formulation.<br>

This example tested the effect of Dextran 10KD on succinic acid sting at pH 3.8 in Base Formula A.  The test procedure and Base Formula A are described in Example 1.  The test formulations were prepared as described in Example 2, except that succinic acid was used in place of glycolic acid.

EXAMPLE  7<br>
This example tested the effect of dextran on delivery of various active molecules to the skin layers.<br>
Procedure:  Dermal delivery of actives was measured by the In-vitro percutaneous absorption   (PCA)   test.     The tests were carried out using dermatomed pig skin and Bronaugh flow-through cells.   3-4 week old female dorsal pig skin,   rinsed with water only was obtained from Buckshire Farms.     The skins were stored at  -70°C until use.     They were thawed at room temperature,   shaved gently with a Norelco electric shaver, sliced to 510 µm thickness using a Padgett Dermatome,   punched into 18-mm discs with a cork borer,   and mounted in Bronaugh diffusion cells over 37oC,  pH 7.1 Hank's balanced salts buffer flowing at S ml/min.    After 30 min equilibration, transepidermal water loss was determined using a ServoMed EPl<br>
evaporimeter.     Skin discs allowing water losses of &gt;5 g/m<br>
per hr were replaced.    The skin discs were    dosed with 2 µL of product containing the nonlabelled active plus an insignificant weight of the active radiolabelled with 3H or 14C at about  30 microCurie/gram product.     The dose was delivered via a displaced volume pipet and spread on the 9-mm diameter exposed skin surface with either a latex finger cot stretched over a cotton tip applicator.     Contact times were 6 hours,   with receptor fluid being sampled at either 1-  or 2-hour intervals  in scintillation vials.     At the end point, the  skin surface was  rinsed with triplicate -1-ml  aliquots of water,   the  skin discs were removed from the apparatus, and blotted with 1/3  of tissue paper   (Kim Wipe) .     The upper surface was   tape-stripped 9  times, with Scotch transparent<br><br>
tape  to obtain the stratum corneum,   and the  epidermis was separated from the dermis with a scalpel.     Analysis by liquid scintillation spectrometry included all  samples necessary to account for complete balance and recovery of the radiolabelled material,   including product  retained on the applicator during delivery,   the water-rinsed and excess removed on the tissue,   tape" stripped stratum corneum, epidermis,   dermis   (counted after NCS digestion),   receptor fluid,   the empty Bronaugh cells,   filter papers,   and rinse pipets.    Theoretical applied dose was determined by subtracting the material retained on the applicator from the mean measured radioactivity of a minimum of  six weighed 2-uL aliquots of the radiolabelled test product.     Data were reported as percent-of-dose in tissue fractions.    A p -value of 
Dextran effect on delivery was tested for Base Formula A with either glycolic or succinic acid.<br>
The results that were obtained are  summarized in Tables 7A and 7B.<br>

It can be seen from the results in Tables 7A and 7B that Dextran did not adversely affect the delivery of either glycolic acid or succinic acid to different skin tissue layers.  In fact, the presence of Dextran led to a directional increase in delivery of glycolic acid (Table 7A) .<br>
Thus, the results of Examples 1-5 demonstrate that dextran reduced the sting caused by weak acids. Other known anti-irritants, such as hydrocortisone, as well as another polysaccharide, arabinogalactan, did not reduce the sting caused by weak carboxylic acids (Comprative Example 6) . Unlike numerous prior art approaches, the addition of dextran did not adversely affect the delivery of actives to skin layers (Example 7) . Examples 8-10 investigate an additional benefit of combining dextran with an acid active: dextran's ability to enhance the anti-aging efficacy of acid actives.<br><br>
EXAMPLE  8<br>
This Example investigated the effect of dextran on the<br>
ability of hydroxy acids to synthesize collagen in skin<br>
f ibroblasts.	<br>
Collagen is  a predominant  skin protein.     It  is  synthesized by fibroblasts  in the dermis.     The  synthesis     of  collagen decreases with aging or photodamage.   Collagen I  is first made as a precursor molecule called Pro-collagen I. Increased production of procollagen 1 is a marker of an increased collagen level  in response  to a test  compound application.<br>
Method: Neonatal human dermal  fibroblasts were purchased from Clonetics Corp.,   San Diego,   CA.    All materials for cell culture were purchased from Life Technologies,   NY.   Cells ( between passages 5-10)   were seeded at a density of approximately 10,000/well  in the  inner 48  wells  of a 96-well plate in DMEM   (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium),   high-glucose,   supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine,   10%  fetal bovine serum,   and antibiotic and antimycotic solutions. Cells were then grown to confluence for 2 days.     At confluence,   the medium was removed and cells were washed with serum-free DMEM,   and each well dosed with 200µl of a solution of a test compound in serum-free DMEM.     Each dosing was replicated in the  total  of  six wells.     Test  compounds were used at  concentrations  indicated in Table  8  below. Control did not  contain a test  compound.     After 24  hours, the solutions were removed and the  cells were  redosed with 100µl of the same solutions.     After 24  hours,   all  solutions<br><br>
were removed, aprotinin was added at a concentration of 0.5% and the solutions stored until analysis at 4°C.<br>
For the analysis of procollagen I in the solutions, they were diluted in DMEM (approximately 20µl sample in 200µl DMEM).   BioRad slot blot apparatus (BioRad Labs, CA) was set up as per manufacturer's instructions.  Briefly, nitrocellulose membrane and 3 sheets of filter paper were wetted in TRIS buffered saline (TBS, pH 7.3.) and assembled in the apparatus with the filter paper on bottom and membrane on top.  100ml TBS was added per well and vacuum filtered.  100 µl  of the sample solution was loaded per well and gravity filtered.  Procollagen from the test solution was bound to the membrane at this point in the procedure. Membrane was removed from the apparatus and placed in blocking solution (5% milk powder in D-PBS) for 1 hour at RT or overnight at 4C on a rotary shaker.  The membrane was then incubated for 1.5 hrs at RT or overnight at 4oC with 1.5 mL Rat Anti-Human Procollagen Amino-Terminal Ab (Chemicon MAB1912) in TBS with 0.1% BSA (ratio of antibody to buffer/BSA was 1:100) in a sealed bag with shaking.  The membrane was then removed; washed 3 times for 5 minutes in TBS/0.1% Tween.  The membrane was then incubated for 1hr at RT or 0/N at 4oC in 2 mL of Biotinylated Anti-Rat Peroxidase-Conjugated Ab (Vector Labs) ) in TBS with 0.1% BSA (ratio of antibody to buffer/BSA was 1:1000) in a sealed bag with shaking.  The membrane was washed 3 times for 5 minutes in TBS/0.l%Tween.  3 mL PBS was incubated with 30µl each of solutions A(avidin) and B biotinylated Horseradish peroxidase) from Vectastain Elite Kit (Vector Labs) for 30 The membrane was placed in the resulting solution<br><br>
for 30 minutes in a sealed bag with shaking.  The membrane was then removed and washed twice for 5 minutes in TBS/ 0.1%Tween.  The membrane was then stained using the following solution: 12.5 mg 3-amino 9-ethyl carbazole (Sigma), 3.125 mL N,N- dimethylformamide (Sigma), 21.5 mL<br>
0.2M Acetate buffer, pH 5.2 and 12.5 µl  H2O2  - The membrane<br>
was stained until red/brown color developed and the reaction stopped with 2 washes for 10 minutes in tap water. A transparency of the blot was prepared using a color copier. The color copy was scanned using a laser densitometer (Ultroscan XL from Pharmacia KLB).  Percent increase was calculated as a ratio of optical density of cells treated with a test compound over control X 100.<br>
The results that were obtained are summarized in Table's. Table 8<br><br>

The results in Table 8 demonstrate that the combination of dextran and glycolic acid provided a significant increase in procollagen I levels whereas the combination of arabinogalactan and glycolic acid did not.<br>
EXAMPLE 9<br>
This example investigated the ability of dextran to induce keratinocyte differentiation potential of lactic acid.<br>
Keratinocytes, the major cell type in the epidermis, undergo a program of differentiation leading to formation of corneocytes which form the stratum corneum and provide a protective barrier against water loss and entry of harmful substances and pathogens. A prominent feature of keratinocyte differentiation is the formation of a highly insoluble, cross-linked envelope (CE) immediately beneath the keratinocyte plasma membrane. The production of keratinocyte CE is catalyzed by the enzyme transglutaminase-K (Tgase K) which cross-links certain precursor proteins in the cell.  Retinoic acid, an agent that is highly effective for improving the appearance of photoaged skin (Weiss etal JAMA, 259:527,1988),  has been  reported to increase Transglutaminase - K (also referred to as Tgase 1) in skin. Therefore, agents that increase Tgase-K activity have the potential of providing benefits to the skin.<br>
Method: Normal Human keratinocytes were seeded in 96-well plates at 4000 cells/well and grown in Keratinocyte Growth Medium (KGM) obtained from Clonetics Corp.  Cells were treated with test compounds at various concentrations for<br><br>
48 hours with an intermittent change of medium after 24 hrs. 6  replicate wells were used for each test.  At the end of the incubation period, two parameters were measured on the cells - I. DNA and II. Transglutaminase protein.<br>
I.	DNA was measured using a method described by Rago et al<br>
Anal. Biochem 191:31-34,1990.  Medium was aspirated from the<br>
plates, cells were washed 3 times with Phosphate Buffered<br>
Saline (PBS).  Cells were frozen and thawed 2 times for<br>
5-10 min each. 100µl of Hoescht Dye (purchased from<br>
Calbiochem) solution (lµg/ml in PBS) was added to each well,<br>
plate was covered with foil and let to sit at room temp for<br>
10 min.  Readings were then taken on Millipore Fluorescence<br>
Miicroplate Reader (ex/em 360/450 nm) .  Amount of DNA per<br>
well (a) was calculated using standards.	<br>
II.	Dye was removed and the cells were again rinsed 3 times<br>
with PBS to prepare for the Transglutaminase (Tgase) assay.<br>
200µl of 5% Carnation Non-fat milk powder in PBS (blocking<br>
solution) was added to each well and left for 1 hr at room<br>
temp.  This solution was then aspirated, and l00µl of human<br>
α Tgase 1 monoclonal antibody (Biomedical Technologies)<br>
diluted 1/2000 in l%milk in PBS was added to each well.<br>
Plates were incubated for 2hrs at 37°C.  The solutions were<br>
then removed and wells washed 4 times with l%milk/0.05%Tween<br>
in PBS.  Anti- mouse Fab' conjugated with Horse Radish<br>
peroxidase was diluted 1:4000 in l%milk/0.05%tween/PBS and<br>
100 µl  of this solution was added to each well and incubated<br>
for 2 hours at 37°C.  The solutions were then aspirated, then<br>
washed 3 times with l%milk/o.05%Tween in PBS.  Substrate<br><br>
Solution was prepared by dissolving 2 mg O-Phenyl enedi amine (Sigma) in 5 mls of citrate buffer and adding 1.65 µl of 30% H2O2. 100 µl  of this substrate solution was added to each well and incubated in the dark for 5 min.  The reaction was stopped by adding 50ul of 4N H2SO4. Absorbance was measured<br>
at 4 90nm (b) .  Keratinocyte differentiation was expressed as transglutaminase absorbance (b) / µg  DNA (a) .<br>
The results that were obtained in two separate experiments are summarized in Tables 9A and 9B.<br>

The results in Tables 9A and 9B demonstrate that a combination of lactic acid and dextrans (either 10KD or 464KD) significantly increased keratinocyte differentiation whereas the combination with arabinogalactan did not.<br>
EXAMPLE 10<br>
This example investigated the effect of Dextran on the skin anti-aging efficacy of glycolic acid.<br>
Procedure: The study was a 12-week bilateral comparison use test of two formulations.<br>
Subjects were required to come to the laboratory for a prescreen visit to determine if they had a moderate degree of photodamaged skin on both forearms.<br>
Qualified subjects were required to make 6  additional visits over a 12 week period of time. At Baseline (week 0), week 4, 8 and 12, visual evaluation was conducted.  Product assignment was randomized and balanced for left/right usage across the subject pool.  Subjects were instructed to use the appropriate product to the left/right arms at home and applied approximately 1 gram twice daily for 12 weeks. A minimum of 15 qualified subjects per paired comparison completed the study.   Clinical (visual) assessments were conducted for photodamaged (crepe-like/crinkled) skin using the following 10 point scale:<br><br>
0 = none 1-3 = mild 4-6 = moderate 7-9 = severe<br>
The following paired comparisons were made:<br>
Paired comparison I:  base formulation A versus base formulation B + 8% glycolic acid.<br>
Paired comparison II:  base formulation A + 8% glycolic versus base formulation A + 8% glycolic + 5% Dextran 10KD.<br>
The Wilcoxon signed rank test, Pratt-Lehmann version, was used to statistically assess the magnitude of average change from baseline attributable to treatment with subject acting as a block in this analysis.  In addition, to compare the extent of change from baseline between the two treatments within a cell, the nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Pratt-Lehmann version, was also used.<br>
The results that were obtained are summarized in Tables 10A and 10B.<br><br>
