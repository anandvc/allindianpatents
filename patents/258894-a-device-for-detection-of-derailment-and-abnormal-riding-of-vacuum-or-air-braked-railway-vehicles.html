				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a device for detection of derailment and abnormal riding of vacuum or air braked railway vehicles. The device is used to stop a railway train soon after one or more of its vehicles/locomotives have derailed, without human attention, so as to minimize damage to Railway track, vehicles, other railway infrastructure, commodities or passengers and environment. The device also stops a railway train when one or more of its vehicles/locomotives experience abnormal riding due to any defect/failure without need for human observation and action.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
The prior art is associated with certain disadvantages in respect of reliability by way of unwarranted actuation of Abnormal riding detectors without high vertical accelerations being experienced by the railway vehicle/locomotive.<br><br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to propose a device for detection of derailment and abnormal riding of vacuum or air braked railway vehicles which overcomes the disadvantage(s) associated with the prior art.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose a device for detection of derailment and abnormal ridings of vacuum or air braked railway vehicles so as to initiate braking action, stop the train in shortest possible time and distance after any abnormal riding is experienced by the vehicle(s) due to initiation of derailment or otherwise irrespective of human observation and response, which also gives a signal to driver of the train through train pipe/brake pipe by sudden drop in vacuum/pressure.<br>
Further object of the present invention is to propose a device for detection of derailment and abnormal riding of vacuum or air braked railway vehicles so as to avoid actuation under a very high horizontal acceleration.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided a device for use with vehicles of a railway train to stop the train in case of abnormal riding of railway vehicles/locomotives, comprising a pressure chamber disposed centrally in SPC housing, a mass with a special profile which is spring loaded and/or restrained by magnet, being capable of sliding vertically in a bush disposed in a housing adapted to be secured with the under frame of the railway vehicle. The pressure chamber being closed by a bellow/diaphragm at the lower end and by a thin diaphragm at the upper end, and the vertical mass being provided with a point at its lower end in proximity to the thin diaphragm. The lower face of the bellow/diaphragm butting against the open end of the brake pipe connector so as to keep it closed when there is pressure due to combination of fluid(s) and air/gas inside the pressure chamber. Means for locking being provided by a lock bolt in the housing so as to restrain the movement of the mass when not fitted on the railway vehicle, and permitting movement of the mass in unlocked position when the device has been fixed on the railway vehicle and is subjected to vertical acceleration beyond the threshold value resulting in the point puncturing the thin diaphragm and reducing the<br><br>
pressure in the pressure chamber due to leakage of air/gas, and lower face of the bellow/diaphragm losing its sealing force against the mouth of the pipe connector arid permitting air from the brake pipe escaping through the holes provided in the pipe connector.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the device for use to activate the braking system of a running train having brake application with the use of vacuum or compressed air in any type of brake system and to stop the train in case of derailment or any other occurrence resulting in abnormal riding, the device provided with the rail vehicles/ locomotives comprises an outer SPC housing, adopted to be secured with pipe connector and housing. A spring loaded and/or magnetically held mass having special serrations on one end, being placed in a bush on the vertical side of the housing adopted to be secured to the under-frame of the railway vehicle. A thin diaphragm is provided on the upper side of the SPC housing and a bellow/diaphragm being provided on the lower side of the housing in a hermetically sealed manner so as to provide a pressure<br><br>
chamber containing the fluid(s) and air/gas to maintain a constant pressure above the atmospheric pressure. The thin diaphragm is provided on the SPC housing adopted to be punctured by the point provided on the free end of the mass, when the mass moves on being subjected to accelerations higher than the designed threshold value, which is higher than the maximum acceleration experienced by the vehicle in normal operation at maximum speed under worst track and vehicle conditions.<br>
The said pressure chamber is filled with fluid(s) and/or air/gas during the manufacture and assembly such that the bellow/diaphragm presses the disc valve against the upper end of the brake pipe/train pipe connector and keeps the end of pipe closed due to the pressure of air/gas inside the pressure chamber under normal conditions of train running. Means for locking the mass being provided for locking the mass during transport, handling and fitment of the device to protect the device from unwarranted actuation due to shocks in handling, and manual means for the lock to be opened and retained with the lock nut in the open position being provided, to be used after the device has been fitted on the railway vehicle.<br><br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided a device for detection of derailment and abnormal riding of vacuum or air braked railway vehicles comprising a SPG housing, adopted to be secured with a pipe connector and housing with a bush, wherein a spring loaded and/or magnetically held mass having serrations on one end is provided, the SPC housing is provided with a thin diaphragm on its upper side and a bellow/diaphragm on its lower side such that the fluid(s) and air/gas in pressure chamber thus formed, remains at a constant pressure above the atmospheric pressure in which the thin diaphragm is adopted to be punctured by a point at the free end of the mass, when it is subjected to accelerations higher than the threshold value.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Further objects and advantages of this invention will be more apparent from the ensuing description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and wherein:<br><br>
Fig. 1 shows the sectional elevation of the device suitable for air braked<br>
railway vehicles.<br>
Fig.  2  shows the part elevation of the device suitable for air braked<br>
vehicles after actuation.<br>
Fig. 3 shows the sectional elevation of the device suitable for vacuum<br>
braked railway vehicles<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION WITH REFERENCE TO THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Reference may be made to fig. 1, wherein the device has a housing (1), which is adapted to be secured with the underframe of the railway vehicle (not shown) with the help of mounting holes (D). A bush of suitable metal/polymer (3) is fixed in the housing (1) for enabling movement of mass (4) in vertical direction under vertical force. Permanent magnet (5) is provided on the top of mass (4) depending upon the characteristics required for vibration response of the mass which is also restrained by the spring (6). The mass (4) has point (7) fixed at its lower end so as to be in close proximity to the thin diaphragm (8) fixed to the upper end of SPC housing (9). A bellow/diaphragm (10) is fixed to the lower end of the SPC housing (9) with the help of washer (11) and screws. The bellow/diaphragm (10) is provided with a disc (12) on the<br><br>
interior flat surface so as to provide a flat support to the end of bellow/diaphragm for closing the mouth of brake pipe connector (13). The brake pipe connector (13), SPC housing (9) and housing (1) are held together by bolts and nuts. A plurality of holes (C) are provided on the lower face of the pipe connector (13) for passage of air from brake pipe (B) upon actuation of the device. The hermetically sealed pressure chamber (A) is created inside the SPC housing (1) between the diaphragm (8) and be How/diaphragm (10), so as to maintain a constant low pressure above the atmospheric pressure, by use of fluid(s) and air/gas. The lower end of the bellow/diaphragm (10) keeps the end of the pipe connector (13) closed to the atmosphere permanently with disc valve (10 + 12) in normal circumstances of train running.<br>
However, the disc valve (10 + 12) moves upwards and opens the end of pipe connector (13), as soon as the mass (4) moves downwards in the housing (1) due to vertical acceleration higher than threshold value being encountered by the railway vehicle, resulting in puncturing of diaphragm (8) by the point (7), thus reducing the pressure inside the pressure chamber (A). Compressed air from brake pipe (B) rushes out through the<br><br>
holes (C) in the bottom of the pipe connector (13). The reduction in the pressure in the brake pipe (B) causes automatic application of brakes in the rail vehicle(s) and this reduction in pressure can also be observed by the  driver  of the  train,  who  then  can  take  necessary action to supplement the braking action.<br>
After actuation of the device, the indicator 16 gets pushed inside under the force of the spring 15, and the pin does not remain projected out side the pipe connector 13 which is shown in Fig. 2. This facilitates detection of vehicle with actuated device in a train in absence of supply of compressed air.<br>
Fig. 3 shows another embodiment of the device suitable for use with vacuum braked rail vehicles. This is similar to that shown and explained in fig. 1. However a release spring (17) is placed between the disc calve (10 + 12) and pipe connector (13). So that when the pressure in the pressure chamber (A) drops after actuation of the device, the spring (17) counters the suction force of the vacuum in the train pipe (E), so as to keep the disc valve (10 + 12) open for allowing air to enter the train pipe<br><br>
(E) through holes in the pipe connector (13). With the drop in train pipe (E) the brakes are automatically applied.<br>
It. is to be noted that the present invention is susceptible to modifications, adaptations and changes by those skilled in the art. Such variant embodiments employing the concepts and features of this invention are intended to be within the scope of the present invention, which is further set forth under the following claims:-<br><br><br><br><br>
