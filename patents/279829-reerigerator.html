Description<br>
REFRIGERATOR<br>
Technical  Field<br>
The present invention relates to a refrigerator, and more particularly, to a re-<br>
frigerator which includes an ice making compartment for making ice.<br>
Background  Art<br>
Generally, refrigerators are used to store food in a low-temperature and fresh state<br>
for a prolonged period of time. Such a refrigerator stores in a frozen or refrigerated<br>
state in accordance with the state or kind of the food.<br>
In order to store food in a low-temperature state, the refrigerator includes a re-<br>
frigerant system which repeatedly performs a refrigerant cycle of compression-con-<br>
densation-expansion-evaporation.<br>
Hereinafter, a conventional refrigerator will be described with reference to FIG. 1.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, the conventional refrigerator includes a refrigerator body 10<br>
which includes a refrigerating compartment 20 for storing food in a refrigerated state,<br>
and a freezing compartment 30 for storing food in a frozen state.<br>
The refrigerating compartment 20 and freezing compartment 30 are partitioned<br>
such that they have independent spaces, respectively. Each of the refrigerating<br>
compartment 20 and freezing compartment 30 is provided with an opening at the front<br>
side thereof.<br>
The opening of the refrigerating compartment 20 is opened or closed by re-<br>
frigerating compartment doors 22. The opening of the freezing compartment 30 is<br>
opened or closed by a freezing compartment door 32.<br>
Generally, the refrigerating compartment 20 is more frequently used than the<br>
freezing compartment 30. To this end, the refrigerating compartment 20 is arranged<br>
over the freezing compartment 30 so as to enable the user to easily take out the food<br>
stored in the refrigerating compartment 20 without bending his body.<br>
Drawers, baskets, and shelves for receiving food of various sizes and states are<br>
provided in the interior of the refrigerating compartment 20 and at the refrigerating<br>
compartment doors 22.<br>
The freezing compartment door 32 is slidable in forward and rearward directions to<br>
open or close the freezing compartment 30. A lower door handle is attached to the<br>
front surface of the freezing compartment door 32 at the upper portion of the freezing<br>
compartment door 32, to enable the user to slide the freezing compartment door 32<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/083111	PCT/KR2006/000357<br>
2<br>
while grasping the lower door handle.<br>
An ice maker 40 is arranged in the freezing compartment 30, in order to make ice<br>
using cold air generated by a heat exchanger and supplied to the freezing compartment<br>
30.<br>
However, the conventional refrigerator having the above-mentioned configuration<br>
has various problems.<br>
First, there is a problem in that the ice maker 40, which makes ice, is arranged in<br>
the interior of the freezing compartment 30, and the freezing compartment 30 is<br>
arranged beneath the refrigerating compartment 20 in the conventional refrigerator<br>
having the above-mentioned configuration. That is, it is inconvenient for the user to<br>
take ice out of the ice maker 40 because the user must operate the ice maker 40 after<br>
opening the freezing compartment door 32 while bending his body.<br>
The above-mentioned problem may be solved by arranging the freezing<br>
compartment 30 over the refrigerating compartment 20. In this case, however, it is<br>
difficult for a short man or a child to take ice out of the ice maker 40 arranged in the<br>
interior of the freezing compartment 30, after opening the freezing compartment 30, in<br>
the case in which the refrigerator has a large size.<br>
Meanwhile, the ice maker 40 may be installed at an appropriate position outside the<br>
freezing compartment 30, separately from the freezing compartment 30. In this case,<br>
however, there are various problems, for example, an increase in the manufacturing<br>
costs of the refrigerator, an increase in the volume of the refrigerator, and a difficulty<br>
in the manufacture of the refrigerator, because an ice-making heat exchanger must be<br>
installed in the ice making compartment.<br>
For the above-mentioned reasons, it is required to develop a refrigerator which<br>
enables the user to easily take ice out of an ice maker without causing a variation in the<br>
capacity of the refrigerator or a limitation on the position of a freezing compartment.<br>
Disclosure   of  Invention<br>

shown in FIG. 2. FIG. 5 is a perspective view illustrating the inner side of a part of one<br>
refrigerating compartment door where the ice making compartment is arranged, in the<br>
refrigerator shown in FIG. 2.<br>
Referring to FIGs. 2 to 5, the refrigerator according to the first embodiment of the<br>
present invention includes a refrigerator body 100, and an ice making compartment<br>
500 in which ice is made.<br>
The inner space of the refrigerator body 100 is partitioned into a refrigerating<br>
compartment 200 and a freezing compartment 300.<br>
Although not shown, shelves and drawers of various shapes are arranged in the re-<br>
frigerating compartment 200, in order to efficiently receive various kinds of food.<br>
The flow of cold air supplied to the refrigerating compartment 200 at one side of<br>
the refrigerating compartment 200 is influenced by the shelves and drawers such that<br>
convection of the cold air is limited or controlled. As a result, the cold air is supplied<br>
in different amounts to portions of the refrigerating compartment 200 defined by the<br>
shelves and drawers, respectively, so that the portions of the refrigerating compartment<br>
200 have different temperature characteristics. Thus, it is possible to store food in an<br>
appropriate portion of the refrigerating compartment 200, depending on the storage<br>
condition of the food.<br>
Meanwhile, the refrigerating compartment 200 is open at the front side thereof. The<br>
refrigerating compartment 200 includes a refrigerating compartment door unit 400<br>
which selectively opens or closes the front side of the refrigerating compartment 200.<br>
Thus, the refrigerating compartment door unit 400 opens or closes the inner space of<br>
the refrigerating compartment 200.<br>
The refrigerating compartment door unit 400 includes a pair cf hinged doors 410<br>
and 420 hingably connected to the refrigerator body 100.<br>
The left one cf the hinged doors 410 and 420, namely, the door 410, may be<br>
hingably connected, at the left end thereof, to the left corners cf the front side of the re-<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/083111	PCT/KR2006/000357<br>
9<br>
frigerating compartment 200 by means of hinges, respectively. The right one of the<br>
hinged doors 410 and 420, namely, the door 420, may be hingably connected, at the<br>
right end thereof to the right corners of the front side of the refrigerating compartment<br>
200 by means of hinges, respectively. Thus, the left and right doors 410 and 420 are<br>
openable independently of each other.<br>
Shelves 411 and 421 may be installed at the refrigerating compartment door unit<br>
400, in order to receive drink bottles and other food.<br>
The freezing compartment 300 is adapted to store fish, meat, or food required to be<br>
stored for a prolonged period of time, in a frozen state. Drawers and baskets (not<br>
shown) are arranged in the freezing compartment 300, in order to separately store a<br>
variety of food to be stored in a frozen state, depending on the size or state of the food.<br>
The temperature of the freezing compartment 300 is controlled by a heat exchanger<br>
310 installed at the refrigerator body 100. In detail, the inner space of the freezing<br>
compartment 300 is maintained in a low-temperature state by cold air generated by the<br>
heat exchanger 310, in order to freeze the food stored in the freezing compartment 300.<br>
In other words, a refrigerant, which passes through the heat exchanger 310, is<br>
evaporated as it absorbs heat from cold air supplied to the freezing compartment 300,<br>
thereby lowering the temperature of the cold air. Thus, the inner space of the freezing<br>
compartment 300 is maintained at a temperature capable of storing food in a frozen<br>
state.<br>
The heat exchanger 310 is arranged at the rear side of the freezing compartment<br>
300, in particular, at the rear side of a storage box 330 arranged in the freezing<br>
compartment 300. Here, the storage box 330 receives the above-described drawers<br>
and/or baskets, in order to store food.<br>
Preferably, a fen (not shown) is arranged at one side of the heat exchanger 310, in<br>
order to forcibly circulate air in the freezing compartment 300.<br>
A freezing compartment door 320 is arranged at the open front side of the freezing<br>
compartment 300, in order to open or close the freezing compartment 300. The<br>
freezing compartment door 320 is hingably connected, at a lower end thereof, to a<br>
lower end of the front side of the storage box 330. The storage box 330 is coupled to<br>
the refrigerator body 100 such that the storage box 330 is slidable in forward and<br>
rearward directions. The storage box 330 is forwardly extendable or rearwardly re-<br>
tractable together with the freezing compartment door 320.<br>
A lower handle 321 may be attached to a front surface of the freezing compartment<br>
door 320, in order to open or close the freezing compartment door 320. A shelf 322,<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/083111	PCT/KR2006/000357<br>
10<br>
which can receive food, may be attached to a rear surface of the freezing compartment<br>
door 320.<br>
Meanwhile, in this embodiment, the heat exchanger 310 is configured to perform<br>
temperature control for both the refrigerating compartment 200 and the freezing<br>
compartment 300. Of course, the refrigerating compartment 200 may be temperature-<br>
controlled by a separate heat exchanger (not shown).<br>
The refrigerating compartment 200 and freezing compartment 300, which have the<br>
above-described configurations, respectively, are partitioned by a barrier 210.<br>
Generally, the refrigerating compartment 200 is more frequently used than the<br>
freezing compartment 300. To this end, it is preferred that the refrigerating<br>
compartment 200 be arranged over the freezing compartment 300 so as to enable the<br>
user to easily take out the food stored in the refrigerating compartment 200 without<br>
bending his body.<br>
Accordingly, the barrier 210 is horizontally arranged in the refrigerator body 100<br>
such that the barrier 210 defines the bottom of the refrigerating compartment 200, and<br>
the top of the freezing compartment 300.<br>
Meanwhile, the ice making compartment 500 basically functions to make ice, and<br>
to store the ice. It is preferred that the ice making compartment 500 be arranged at an<br>
appropriate position in the refrigerator, in order to enable the user to easily take out ice<br>
made in the ice making compartment 500, irrespective of the size or capacity of the re-<br>
frigerator, and the arrangement of the freezing compartment 300 and refrigerating<br>
compartment 200.<br>
In conventional cases in which there is a limitation on the arrangement of an ice<br>
making compartment because the ice making compartment must be arranged in the<br>
freezing compartment, there is a difficulty in arranging the ice making compartment at<br>
an appropriate position in a refrigerator.<br>
Therefore, in order to not only make ice using the above-described heat exchanger<br>
without use of a separate ice-making heat exchanger, but also to enable the ice maker<br>
. to be arranged at an appropriate position enabling the user to most easily take out ice<br>
made by the ice maker, it is preferred that the refrigerator include a cold air guide<br>
device for guiding cold air generated by the heat exchanger 310 to the ice making<br>
compartment 500.<br>
In other words, there is a feature of the present invention in that the refrigerator<br>
includes a cold air guide device for guiding a part of cold air generated by the heat<br>
exchanger 310, in order to enable the ice maker to be arranged at a most appropriate<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/083111	PCT/KR2006/000357<br>
11<br>
position, irrespective of the size or capacity of the refrigerator, and the arrangement of<br>
the freezing compartment 300 and refrigerating compartment 200.<br>
This feature of the present invention is more effective when the freezing<br>
compartment 300 is arranged beneath the refrigerating compartment 200.<br>
In other words, when the refrigerating compartment 200 is arranged over the<br>
freezing compartment 300, it is possible to more easily take out the food stored in the<br>
inner space of the refrigerating compartment 200, in particular, a lower portion of the<br>
refrigerating compartment 200.<br>
Also, it is preferred that the ice making compartment 500 be arranged in the re-<br>
frigerating compartment 200, in order to enable the user to easily take out the ice<br>
stored in the ice making compartment 500. In the illustrated case, the ice making<br>
compartment 500 is provided at the refrigerating compartment door unit 400.<br>
Referring to FIGs. 2 to 5, a dispenser 430 is also provided at the refrigerating<br>
compartment door unit 400, in addition to the ice making compartment 500. The<br>
dispenser 430 fractions to enable the user to take out water purified in the refrigerator<br>
and ice made in the ice making compartment 500 at the outside of the refrigerator.<br>
Operating buttons 450 for control of the internal temperatures of the compartments in<br>
the refrigerator, and other junctions, and a display unit 440 for displaying the operating<br>
state cf the refrigerator are arranged on the front surface of the refrigerator body 100.<br>
In accordance with this embodiment, the ice making compartment 500 is arranged<br>
at the inner side of the refrigerating door unit 400, in particular, at the inner side of the<br>
left door 410. The dispenser 430 is arranged to discharge the ice stored in the ice<br>
making compartment 500 at the front side of the left door 410. Of course, the ice<br>
making compartment 500 and dispenser 430 may be arranged at the right door 420.<br>
In order to enable the dispenser 430 to discharge the ice made in the ice making<br>
compartment 500 by gravity, it is preferred that the ice making compartment 500 be<br>
arranged over the dispenser 430.<br>
The ice making compartment 500 has a rear wall which is protruded from the left<br>
door 410 into the refrigerating chamber 200.<br>
The ice making compartment 500 includes an ice making chamber 510 in which an<br>
ice maker 511 adapted to make ice using cold air generated by the heat exchanger 310<br>
is received, and an ice making compartment door 520 which opens or closes an<br>
opening formed at a rear side of the ice making chamber 510.<br>
The ice making compartment 500 is defined by an inner case (not shown) coupled<br>
to the rear surface of the left door 410. Accordingly, the inner space of the ice making<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/083111	PCT/KR2006/000357<br>
12<br>
compartment 500 is partitioned from the inner space of the refrigerating compartment<br>
200.<br>
The ice maker 511, which makes ice using cold air generated by the heat exchanger<br>
310, is arranged in the interior of the ice making compartment 500, namely, the ice<br>
making chamber 510. A feeder 512 is also received in the ice making chamber 510.<br>
The feeder 512 is arranged beneath the ice maker 511, to store and feed ice made by<br>
the ice maker 511.<br>
The feeder 512 not only stores ice made by the ice maker 511, but also feeds the ice<br>
to the dispenser 430, in order to enable the user to take out the ice through the<br>
dispenser 430, if necessary.<br>
Meanwhile, the cold air guide device functions to guide the cold air generated by<br>
the heat exchanger 310 to the ice making chamber 510 of the ice making compartment<br>
500.<br>
Referring to FIGs. 3 and 4, the cold air glide device includes a duct unit 600 which<br>
communicates with the ice making compartment 500.<br>
In detail, the duct unit 600 defines a flow path of the cold air generated by the heat<br>
exchanger 310. Preferably, the refrigerator according to the first embodiment of the<br>
present invention fiirther includes a cold air supply fen 630 which forces the cold air<br>
generated by the heat exchanger 310 to flow through the ice making compartment 500.<br>
Accordingly, a part of the cold air generated by the heat exchanger 310 is<br>
introduced into the ice making compartment 500 via the duct unit 600 in accordance<br>
with the driving of the cold air supply fen 630.<br>
The ice making compartment 500 may be configured to be selectively connected to<br>
the duct unit 600, as in this embodiment.<br>
In detail, the ice making compartment 500 and duct unit 600 are configured to be<br>
connected to each other only in a closed state of the left door 410.<br>
In other words, when the left door 410 is closed, the ice making chamber 500 com-<br>
municates with the duct unit 600.<br>
For this configuration, a first opening 601 is formed through an inner wall of the re-<br>
frigerating compartment 200. The first opening 601 defines one end of the duct unit<br>
600, in particular, an upper end of the duct unit 600. A second opening 501, which is<br>
selectively connected to the first opening 601, is formed at the refrigerating door unit<br>
400, in particular, the left door 410.<br>
When the second opening 501 is connected to the first opening 610, the second<br>
opening 501 communicates with the inner space of the ice making compartment 500,<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/083111	PCT/KR2006/000357<br>
13<br>
in particular, the ice making chamber 510.<br>
In detail, when the left door 410 is closed, the second opening 501 is connected to<br>
the first opening 601. On the other hand, when the left door 410 is opened, the second<br>
opening 501 is disconnected from the first opening 601.<br>
Of course, although not shown, the ice making compartment 500 may be<br>
configured to always communicate with the duct unit 600. For this configuration, the<br>
duct unit 600 may be directly connected, at one end thereof, to one side of the re-<br>
frigerator door unit 400 where the ice making compartment 500 is defined, and may be<br>
connected, at the other end thereof, to one side of the freezing compartment 300.<br>
The duct unit 600 includes at least one duct, two ducts 610 and 620 in the illustrated<br>
case, arranged at one side wall of the refrigerating compartment 200.<br>
Where the ice making compartment 500 is arranged at the left door 410, as in this<br>
embodiment, it is preferred that the ducts 610 and 620 be arranged at the left wall of<br>
the refrigerating compartment 200.<br>
The ducts 610 and 620 function to supply cold air generated by the heat exchanger<br>
310 to the ice making compartment 500. Hereinafter, these ducts are collectively<br>
referred to as an air supply duct 610.<br>
In this embodiment, the air supply duct 610 is configured such that one end of the<br>
air supply duct 610, namely, the upper end of the air supply duct 610, communicates<br>
with the ice making compartment 500, and the other end of the air supply duct 610,<br>
namely, the lower end of the air supply duct 610, communicates with the freezing<br>
compartment 300. In accordance with this configuration, the air supply duct 610<br>
guides a part of the cold air, supplied to the freezing compartment 300, to the ice<br>
making compartment 500.<br>
Of course, the other end of the air supply duct 610 may be open to one side of the<br>
heat exchanger 310 such that the air supply duct 610 directly sucks cold air from the<br>
heat exchanger 310, to guide the sucked cold air to the ice making compartment 500.<br>
Meanwhile, the cold air introduced into the ice making compartment 500 absorbs<br>
heat from water in the ice making compartment 500. The cold air emerging from the<br>
ice making compartment 500 may be introduced into the interior of the refrigerating<br>
compartment 200. However, it is preferred that the cold air emerging from the ice<br>
making compartment 500 be returned to the freezing compartment 300, taking into<br>
consideration the temperature difference between the cold air in the refrigerating<br>
compartment 200 and the cold air in the ice making compartment 500.<br>
To this end, the duct unit 60 preferably further includes a duct 620 which is<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/083111	PCT/KR2006/000357<br>
14<br>
connected to the ice making compartment 500, to glide the cold air from the ice<br>
making compartment 500 to the freezing compartment 300. Hereinafter, the duct 620<br>
is referred to as a return duct.<br>
One end of the return duct 620, namely, the upper end of the return duct 620, is<br>
connected to the ice making compartment 500, whereas the other end of the return duct<br>
620, namely, the lower end of the return duct 620, is connected to one side of the<br>
freezing compartment 300 such that the return duct 620 communicates with the inner<br>
space of the freezing compartment 300.<br>
Meanwhile, the first opening 601 includes a duct-side air supply port 601a which<br>
allows the cold air emerging from the supply air duct 610 to be discharged into the ice<br>
making chamber 500. The second opening 501 includes a door-side inlet 501a which is<br>
formed through an inner wall of the left door 410 such that the door-side inlet 501a is<br>
selectively connected to the duct-side air supply port 601a.<br>
Where the duct unit 600 further includes the return duct 620, as in this embodiment,<br>
the first opening 601 farther includes a duct-side inlet 601b which receives the cold air<br>
emerging from the ice making compartment 500, to guide the received cold air to the<br>
freezing compartment 300. In this case, the second opening 501 further includes a<br>
door-side outlet 501b which is formed through the inner wall of the left door 410 such<br>
that the door-side outlet 501b is selectively connected to the duct-side inlet 601b.<br>
Meanwhile, at least one of the ducts 610 and 620, in particular, at least one of the<br>
air supply duct 610 and return duct 620, is preferably arranged between outer and inner<br>
walls defining one side of the refrigerating compartment 200, namely, the left side of<br>
the refrigerating compartment 200.<br>
         Here, the outer wall defines the left appearance of the refrigerator body 100,<br>
whereas the inner wall defines the left inner wall of the refrigerating compartment 200.<br>
	In particular, it is preferred that the air supply duct 610 be arranged between the<br>
outer and inner walls, because the temperature of the cold air flowing through the air<br>
supply duct 610 is lower than the temperature of the cold air flowing through the<br>
return duct 620.<br>
        In order to minimize the influence of the duct unit 600 on the temperature of the re-<br>
frigerating compartment 200, however, it is preferred that both the air supply duct 610<br>
and the return duct 620 be arranged between the outer and inner walls, as in this<br>
embodiment.<br>
	The space between the walls of the refrigerating compartment 200, namely, the<br>
outer and inner walls of the refrigerating compartment 200 is filled with an insulating<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/083111	PCT/KR2006/000357<br>
15<br>
material such as foamed urethane, in order to prevent the internal temperature of the<br>
refrigerating compartment 200 from being varied by the cold air flowing through the<br>
duct unit 600, and to minimize an increase in the temperature of the cold air flowing<br>
through the ducts 610 and 620.<br>
Where the air supply duct 610 is arranged at the left side of the refrigerating<br>
compartment 200 in the space between the outer and inner walls of the refrigerating<br>
compartment 200, it is preferred that the first opening 601 be arranged at the left inner<br>
wall of the refrigerating compartment 200. In this case, it is also preferred that the<br>
second opening 501 be arranged at the inner case of the refrigerating compartment<br>
door unit 400.<br>
In detail, the duct-side air supply port 601a and duct-side inlet 601b may be formed<br>
at a front portion of the left inner wall of the refrigerating compartment 200.<br>
One end of the air supply duct 610, namely, the outlet of the air supply duct 610, is<br>
connected to the duct-side air supply port 601a. One end of the return duct 620,<br>
namely, the inlet of the return duct 620, is connected to the duct-side inlet 601b.<br>
Meanwhile, the door-side inlet 501a and door-side outlet 501b are formed at the<br>
inner case such that they correspond to the duct-side air supply port 601a and duct-side<br>
inlet 601b, respectively.<br>
Of course, where one end of the air supply duct 610 is protruded from the inner<br>
wall of the refrigerating compartment 200, the outlet of the air supply duct 610 may<br>
form the duct-side air supply port. On the other hand, where one end of the return duct<br>
620 is protruded from the inner wall of the refrigerating compartment 200, the inlet of<br>
the return duct 620 may form the duct-side air supply port.<br>
In accordance with the above-described configuration, when the left door 410 is<br>
closed, the first opening 601 and second opening 501 are connected to each other. In<br>
this state, a part of the cold air supplied to the freezing compartment 300 is supplied to<br>
the interior of the ice making compartment 500 via the air supply duct 610. Also, the<br>
cold air used to make ice in the ice making compartment 500 is returned to the freezing<br>
compartment 300 via the return duct 620.<br>
Hereinafter, operation of the refrigerator having the above-described configuration<br>
according to the first embodiment of the present invention will be described.<br>
First, cold air, which is supplied to the freezing compartment 300 after being cooled<br>
by the heat exchanger 310, freezes food stored in the freezing compartment 300.<br>
A part of the cold air, which is supplied to the freezing compartment 300 after<br>
being cooled by the heat exchanger 310, is guided to the ice making compartment 500<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/083111	PCT/KR2006/000357<br>
16<br>
via the cold air glide device, in particular, the duct unit 600.<br>
In detail, a part of cold air generated by the heat exchanger 310 is forcibly fed to the<br>
ice making compartment 500 via the air supply duct 610 by the cold air supply fen<br>
630.<br>
The cold air introduced into the ice making compartment 500 heat-exchanges with<br>
water supplied to the ice maker 540. Thus, making cf ice is carried out in the ice<br>
making compartment 500.<br>
    The cold air, which has performed heat exchange, namely, has been used to make<br>
ice, is introduced into the return duct 620 through the duct-side inlet 601b connected to<br>
the door-side outlet 501b, and is then returned to the freezing compartment 300 via the<br>
return duct 620.<br>
 The cold air introduced into the freezing compartment 300 is cooled as it heat-<br>
exchanges again with the heat exchanger 310. The resultant cold air is then supplied to<br>
the freezing compartment 300 or ice making compartment 500.<br>
     Ice made in the ice making compartment 500 is stored in the feeder 512. The ice<br>
stored in the feeder 512 is subsequently externally discharged through the dispenser<br>
420 in accordance with operation cf the user.<br>

The refrigerator according to the second embodiment cf the present invention<br>
includes sealing units 710 and 720 for preventing cold air from being leaked between<br>
the first opening 601 and the second opening 501.<br>
In order to enable the user to open or close the ice making compartment door 520 in<br>
the refrigerator according to the second embodiment cf the present invention, a handle<br>
521 is provided at the ice making compartment door 520. Also, the ice making<br>
compartment door 520 is hingably mounted to one edge cf an opening formed through<br>
the rear wall of the ice making chamber 510.<br>
The opening/closing structure of the ice making compartment door 520 and handle<br>
521 may be applied to the refrigerator according to the first embodiment of the present<br>
invention in the same manner as described above.<br>
The opening formed through the rear wall of the ice making chamber 510 is formed<br>
at an inner liner 530 which is coupled to the inner wall cf the left door 410.<br>
Accordingly, when the user pulls the handle 521 in an opened state cf the left door<br>
410, the ice making compartment door 520 is opened while being hingably moved.<br>
The sealing units 710 and 720 may be provided at one of the first and second<br>
openings 601 and 501.<br>
Of course, the sealing units 710 and 720 may be provided at the first and second<br>
openings 610 and 501, respectively.<br>
Hereinafter, the sealing units 710 and 720 will be described in more detail with<br>
reference to Figs. 8 and 9. Since the sealing units 710 and 720 have the same structure,<br>
the following description will be given only in conjunction with one of the sealing<br>
units 710 and 720, for example, the sealing unit 710.<br>
The sealing unit 710 is provided at the second opening 510 cf the inner case 530,<br>
and functions to prevent cold air from being leaked through the first opening 601 and<br>
the second opening 501.<br>
The sealing unit 710 includes a gasket 711, and a gasket fixer for fixing the gasket<br>
711 to the first opening 601 provided at the inner wall cf the refrigerating compartment<br>
200.<br>
The gasket 711 is in contact with the first opening 601.<br>
The gasket fixer includes a gasket supporter 713 which is coupled to the first<br>
opening 601, and a gasket holder 712 which fixes the gasket 711 to the gasket<br>
supporter 713.<br>
In detail, the gasket holder 712 is coupled to the gasket supporter 713, to fix the<br>
gasket 711 to the gasket supporter 713. The gasket supporter 713 is coupled to the<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/083111	PCT/KR2006/000357<br>
18<br>
edge of the first opening 601, to fix the gasket 711 to the inner case 530.<br>
The gasket 711 includes a gasket body 71 la, and a holder coupler 71 Id for<br>
coupling the gasket 711 to the gasket holder 712.<br>
A cold air hole 711b is provided at the gasket body 71 la in order to allow the ice<br>
making compartment 500 and duct unit 600 to communicate with each other. The cold<br>
air hole 71 lb is formed through the gasket body 711a.<br>
In this embodiment, the gasket body 71 la is made up of a ring-shaped member such<br>
that the cold air hole 711 b is defined at a central portion of the gasket body 711a.<br>
It is preferred that a reinforcing rib 71 lc be provided at the cold air hole 711b. The<br>
reinforcing rib 71 lc includes a first rib having an approximately cross shape, and an<br>
annular second rib which has an outer diameter smaller than an inner diameter of the<br>
cold air hole 711b, and is formed integrally with the first rib.<br>
The holder coupler 71 Id forms a holder receiving groove 71 If for receiving the<br>
gasket holder 712. To form the holder receiving groove 71 If, the holder coupler 71 Id<br>
extends radially inwardly from the edge of the gasket body 711 a, and then extends<br>
radially outwardly after being bent.<br>
Thus, the bent portion of the holder coupler 71 Id forms the holder receiving groove<br>
71 If for receiving the gasket holder 712, as shown in FIG. 9.<br>
The gasket holder 712 includes a holder body 712a having an approximately ring<br>
shape, and at least one fixing member 712b which is coupled to the gasket supporter<br>
713.<br>
The holder body 712a is fitted in the holder receiving groove 71 If. The fixing<br>
member 712b includes a hook extending from the edge cf the holder body 712a at one<br>
side of the holder body 712a such that the hook is integral with the holder body 712a.<br>
The hook extends toward the gasket supporter 713. The hook is coupled to the<br>
gasket supporter 713, thereby fixing the gasket 711 to the gasket supporter 713.<br>
In detail, the portion of the holder coupler 71 Id extending from the bent portion of<br>
the holder coupler 71 Id outwardly from the gasket body 71 la is interposed between<br>
the holder body 712a and the gasket supporter 713.<br>
When the hook is engaged with the gasket supporter 713, the gasket 711 is partially<br>
supported by the gasket holder 712 and gasket supporter 713. Thus, the assembly of<br>
the sealing unit 710 is completed.<br>
Meanwhile, a hook groove 71 le, through which the hook extends, is formed at the<br>
portion of the holder coupler 71 Id extending from the bent portion cf the holder<br>
coupler 71 Id outwardly from the gasket body.<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/083111	PCT/KR2006/000357<br>
19<br>
Here, the number of hook grooves 71 le is identical to the number of hooks. In this<br>
embodiment, four hooks 71 le, which are spaced apart from one another by an angle of<br>
90°, are formed at the holder coupler 71 Id. Also, four hooks, which are spaced apart<br>
from one another by an angle of 90°, are formed at the holder body 712a.<br>
The gasket supporter 713 includes a supporter body 713a, and hook coupling holes<br>
713c formed at the supporter body 713a such that the hook coupling holes 713c<br>
correspond to the hooks, respectively.<br>
The supporter body 713a has a recessed step on which the gasket holder 712 and<br>
gasket 711 are seated. A communicating hole 713b having a predetermined diameter is<br>
formed through the support body 713a inside the step. The communicating hole 713b<br>
communicates with the cold air hole 711b of the gasket 711. The hooks extend through<br>
the hook coupling holes 713c, respectively, and engage with the rear surface cf the<br>
supporter body 713a.<br>

designated by the same reference numerals as those used in at least one of the first<br>
through third embodiments of the present invention, respectively, and no additional de-<br>
scription thereof will be given.<br>
Referring to FIGs. 12 to 14, the refrigerator according to the fourth embodiment of<br>
the present invention includes a spacer which spaces ducts internally arranged at one<br>
side wall of the refrigerator from the outer wall O and inner wall I forming the side<br>
wall of the refrigerator.<br>
Here, the ducts include the above-described air supply duct 610 and return duct<br>
620.<br>
The spacer supports the air supply duct 610 and/or return duct 620 to be spaced<br>
apart from the outer wall O and inner wall I.<br>
The spacer is provided to minimize thermal loss of cold air flowing through the<br>
duct unit 600 and to easily fill a foaming liquid between the outer wall O and the inner<br>
wall I.<br>
It is preferred that the spacer be configured to uniformly space each cf the ducts<br>
610 and 620 from the outer wall O and inner wall I.<br>

In this embodiment, the spacer includes two spacing ribs 61 la or 621a which are<br>
protruded from the outer surface of the associated air supply duct 610 or return duct<br>
620 in a symmetrical manner. Of course, it is preferred that spacing ribs 611a and<br>
spacing ribs 621a are provided at the air supply duct 610 and return duct 620, re-<br>
spectively.<br>
The spacing ribs 61 la or 621a extend in opposite directions from the outer surface<br>
cf the associated duct 610 or 620, respectively.<br>
Thus, the air supply duct 610 and/or return duct 620 is centrally arranged between<br>
the outer wall O and the inner wall I.<br>
The spacing ribs 61 la and 621a preferably have a shape having a small cross-<br>
sectional area, in order to minimize the area of the spacing ribs 61 la and 621a<br>
contacting the outer wall O and inner wall I. Accordingly, it is possible to minimize<br>
thermal loss caused by the spacing ribs.<br>
When the ducts 610 and 620 are centrally arranged between the inner wall I and the<br>
 <br>

guides cold air to flow rectilinearly, and a connecting duct 612 which varies the flow<br>
direction of cold air flowing through the air supply duct 610. The connecting duct 612<br>
may be connected to one end of the main duct 611. Where the air supply duct 610<br>
includes, for example, two main ducts 611, the connecting duct 612 may be connected<br>
between the fecing ends cf the main ducts 611.<br>
Where the duct unit 601 includes, in addition to the air supply duct 610, the return<br>
duct 620, the return duct 620 includes, similarly to the air supply duct 610, at least one<br>
main duct 621 which guides cold air to flow rectilinearly, and a connecting duct 622<br>
which varies the flow direction cf cold air flowing through the return duct 620. The<br>
connecting duct 622 may be connected to one end of the main duct 621. Where the<br>
return duct 620 includes, for example, two main ducts 621, the connecting duct 622<br>
may be connected between the feeing ends of the main ducts 621.<br>
Each of the main ducts 611 and 621 has an approximately rectilinear shape. Each cf<br>
the connecting ducts 612 and 622 has a curved shape to guide a flow of cold air. The<br>
connecting duct 612 or 622 may form one end of the associated air supply duct 610 or<br>
return duct 620. Where the connecting duct 612 or 622 is connected between the<br>
adjacent main ducts 611 or 621, it varies the flow direction cf cold air.<br>
In this embodiment, the spacing ribs 61 la and 621a are provided at the outer<br>
surfaces cf the associated connecting ducts 612 and 622, respectively. However, the<br>

spacing ribs 61 la and 621a. Accordingly, the duct unit 600 may include the spacing<br>
protrusions 840 or the spacing ribs 61 la and 621a alone.<br>
Of course, there is a difference between the spacing protrusions 840 and the spacing<br>
ribs 611a and 621a in that the spacing protrusions 840 are protruded from respective<br>
outer surfaces of the duct receivers 810 and 820, whereas the spacing ribs 611a and<br>
621a are protruded from respective outer surfaces of the ducts 610 and 620.<br>
The spacing protrusions 840 formed at each of the duct receivers 810 and 820 are<br>
arranged at opposite sides of the associated duct receiver 810 or 820. Accordingly, the<br>
spacing protrusions 840 maintain the air supply duct 610 and return duct 620 at a<br>
central position between the outer wall O and the inner wall I.<br>
Where the air supply duct 610 and return duct 620 are centrally arranged between<br>
the inner wall I and the outer wall O, the foaming liquid L filling the space between the<br>
inner wall I and the outer wall O can smoothly flow. Accordingly, the foaming liquid<br>
L can sufficiently fill the space between the inner wall I and the outer wall O.<br>
