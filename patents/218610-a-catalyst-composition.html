"A COMPOSITION"<br>
E.I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of State of Delaware of 1007 Market Street, Wilmington, Delaware 19898, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
WO 01/3988S<br><br>
PCT/USOO/02103<br><br>
TITLE<br>
ESTERIFICATION'CATALYST COMPOSITIONS AND USE THEREOF<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
5	This invention relates to a catalyst composition comprising a<br>
hypophosphorous acid and to a process for using the composition in, for example, esterification, transesterification, or polymerization of a carbonyl compound.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Polyesters such as, for example, polyethylene terephthalate, <br>
10      	polytrimethylene terephthalate and polybutylene terephthalate, generally referred to as "polyalkylene terephthalates", are a class of important industrial polymers. They are widely used in thermoplastic fibers, films, and molding applications.<br>
Polyalkylene terephthalates can be produced by transesterification of a dialkyl terephthalate ester with a glycol followed by polycondensation or by direct<br>
15      esterification of terephthalic acid with the selected glycol followed by polycondensation. A catalyst is used to catalyze the esterification, transesterification or polycondensation.<br>
Antimony, in the form of a glycol solution of antimony oxide, frequently is used as catalyst in the transesterification or esterification process. However, <br>
20      antimony forms insoluble antimony complexes that plug fiber spinnerets and leads in fiber spinning to frequent shutdowns to wipe spinnerets clean of precipitated antimony compounds. The antimony-based catalysts are also coming under increased environmental pressure and regulatory control, especially in food contact applications.<br>
25	Organic titanates, such as tetraisopropyl and tetra n-butyl titanates, are<br>
known to be effective polycondensation catalysts for producing polyalkylene<br>
terephthalates in general, and frequently are the catalyst of choice. However, these catalysts tend to hydrolyze on contact with water forming glycol-insoluble oligomeric species, which lose catalytic activity. These organic titanates also<br>
1<br><br>
WO 01/39885<br><br>
PCT/US00/02103<br><br>
generate a significant amount of yellow discoloration when used as polyesterification catalysts.   Additionally, many organic titanate catalysts are also<br>
substantially insoluble in a polymerization mixture thereby creating non-uniform<br>
distribution of catalyst in the mixture.<br>
5	Water compatible titanates, such as titanium bis-ammonium lactate, bis-<br>
triethanolamine titanate or the titanium sodium citrate catalysts disclosed in EP 812818, when used as polyesterification catalysts, generate significant yellow discoloration in the resultant polymer. Similarly, WO 99/28033 discloses an organometallic compound for producing an ester. The organometallic compound <br>
10    	comprises the reaction product of an orthoester of titanium, zirconium, or aluminum, an alcohol containing at least two hydroxyl groups, an organophosphoms compound, and a base. When used as polyesterification catalyst, however, it was found that the organometallic compound also generates undesirably significant yellow discoloration in the final product.<br>
15	Therefore, there is an increasing need for the development of a new<br>
catalyst that is substantially soluble in a glycol, is efficient, produces a polymer with reduced color, exhibits good catalytic activity, does not result in plugging fiber spinnerets, and is environmentally friendly.<br>
An advantage of the present invention catalyst composition is that the <br>
20      	polymer produced using the invention catalyst has improved optical properties (e.g., less undesirable color) compared to polymer produced using an organic titanate catalyst alone. Another advantage of the present invention is that the invention catalyst is soluble in an alcohol used to produce a polyester, does not generate precipitates in the polyester that plug fiber spinnerets, and is <br>
25        environmentally friendly. Other advantages will become more apparent as the invention is more fully disclosed herein below.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to a first embodiment of the present invention, a catalyst composition, which can be used as an esterification or transesterification catalyst, <br>
30     	or as a polycondensation catalyst to produce polyalkylene terephthalates, is provided.  The composition comprises titanium or a titanium compound, a<br><br>
WO 01/39885<br><br>
PCT/US00/02103<br><br>
complexing agent, hypophosphorous acid or a salt thereof and optionally a solvent.   The complexing agent is selected from the group consisting of hydroxycarboxylic acids, alkanolamines. aminocarboxylic acids, and<br>
combinations thereof.<br>
5	According to a second embodiment of the present invention, a process<br>
which can be used in, for example, the production of an ester or polyester is provided. The process comprises contacting, in the presence of a catalyst composition, a carbonyl compound with an alcohol. The catalyst composition can be the same as that disclosed above.<br>
10	DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The catalyst composition of this invention is substantially soluble in a solvent. The term "substantially" means more than trivial. It is preferred that the composition be completely soluble in the solvent. However, a substantial portion of the composition can also be suspended or dispersed in the solvent.<br>
15	According to the first embodiment of the present invention, a catalyst<br>
composition is provided. The composition can comprise, consist essentially of, or consist of a titanium compound, a complexing agent, and hypophosphorous acid or a salt thereof. The composition can further comprise a solvent.<br>
According to the invention, the preferred titanium compounds are organic <br>
20      titanium compounds. Titanium tetrahydrocarbyloxides, also referred to as tetraalkyl titanates herein, are presently most preferred organic titanium compounds because they are readily available and effective. Examples of suitable titanium tetrahydrocarbyloxide compounds include those expressed by the general formula Ti(OR)4 where each R is individually selected from an alkyl, cycloalkyl, <br>
25      alkaryl, hydrocarbyl radical containing from 1 to about 30, preferably 2 to about 18, and most preferably 2 to 12 carbon atoms per radical and each R can be the same or different. Titanium tetrahydrocarbyloxides in which the hydrocarboxyl<br>
group contains from 2 to about 12 carbon atoms per radical which is a linear or branched alkyl radical are most preferred because they are relatively inexpensive, <br>
30      more readily available, and effective jh forming the solution. Suitable titanium<br>
3<br><br>
WO 01/39885<br><br>
PCT/USOO/02103<br><br>
tetrahydrocarbyloxides include, but are not limited to, titanium tetraethoxide, titanium tetrapropoxide, titanium tetraisopropoxide, titanium tetra-n-butoxide,<br>
titanium tetrahexoxide, titanium tetra 2-ethylhexoxide, titanium tetraoctoxide, and<br>
combinations of two or more thereof.<br>
5	The presence of a halide, or of other active substituent, in the R group<br>
generally is avoided since such substituents can interfere with catalytic reactions or form undesired by-products, which can contaminate the polymer when the titanium compound is used for producing a polymer. Presently it is also preferred that the each R group is identical to facilitate synthesis of the organic titanate. In <br>
10      	some cases two or more R groups can be from a common compound chemically bonded together other than at the titanium atom (i.e., multidentate ligands such as triethanol amine, citric acid, or lactic acid).<br>
According to the invention, the titanium tetrahydrocarbyloxide can also be combined with a zirconium compound to produce a mixture comprising a titanium<br>
15      tetrahydrocarbyloxide and a zirconium tetrahydrocarbyloxide. The presently preferred zirconium tetrahydrocarbyloxides include, but are not limited to, zirconium tetraethoxide, zirconium tetrapropoxide, zirconium tetraisopropoxide, zirconium tetra-n-butoxide, zirconium tetrahexoxide, zirconium tetra 2-ethylhexoxide, zirconium tetraoctoxide, and combinations of two or more thereof.<br>
20     The molar ratio of Ti/Zr can be in the range of from about 0.001:1 to about 10:1.<br>
The titanium tetrahydrocarbyloxides suitable for use in the present invention can be produced by, for example, mixing titanium tetrachloride and an alcohol in the presence of a base, such as ammonia, to form the titanium tetracarbyloxide or tetraalkyl titanate. The alcohol can be ethanol, n-propanol,<br>
2	5      isopropahol, n-butanol, or isobutanol. Methanol generally is not employed<br>
because the resulting titanium tetramethoxide is insoluble in the reaction mixture thereby complicating its isolation. Titanium tetrahydrocarbyloxides thus produced can be recovered by first removing by-product ammonium chloride by any means known to one skilled in the art such as filtration followed by distilling the titanium<br>
30    tetrahydrocarbyloxides from the reaction mixture. This process can be carried out<br>
at a temperature in the range of from about 0 to about 150°C. Titanates having<br>
4<br><br>
WO 01/39885<br><br>
PCT/USOO/02103<br><br>
longer alkyl groups can also be produced by transesterification of those having R groups up to C4 with alcohols having more than 4 carbon atoms per molecule.<br>
Examples of commercially available organic titanium compounds include, but are not limited to, TYZOR® TPT and TYZOR® TBT (tetra isopropyl titanate <br>
5     	and tetra n-butyl titanate, respectively) available from E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, Wilmington, Delaware, U.S.A.<br>
The complexing agents suitable for use in the present invention are generally hydroxycarboxylic acids, alkanolamines, aminocarboxylic acids, or combinations of two or more thereof. It is presently preferred that the complexing<br>
10      agents be a-hydroxycarboxylic acids, alkanolamines, or a- aminocarboxylic acids in which the hydrocarbyl group or alkyl group has 1 to about 15, preferably 1 to 10 carbon atoms per group, and combinations of two or more thereof. Examples of suitable complexing agents include, but are not limited to, lactic acid, glycolic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, malic acid, diethanolamine, triethanolamine,<br>
15      tetrahydroxyisopropylethylenediamine, glycine, bis-hydroxyethyl glycine, hydroxyethyl glycine, and combinations of two or more thereof.<br>
According to the invention, the hypophosphorous acid is an inorganic acid having the formula of H2P(0)OM in which M is hydrogen, ammonium ion, a metal ion, or combinations of two or more thereof and the phosphorus atom is <br>
20      bonded to two hydrogen atom. The metal ion can be any metal ion. It is presently preferred that the metal ion be an alkali metal ion. The hypophosphorous acid or its metal salt is commercially available as an aqueous solution and it is typically used herein as an aqueous solution.<br>
Any solvent that can substantially dissolve the catalyst composition<br>
2	5      disclosed above can be used in the present invention. The presently preferred<br>
solvent is water or an alcohol having the formula of R1(OH)n, an alkylene glycol of the formula (HO)nA(OH)n, a polyalkylene glycol or alkoxylated alcohol having the formula of R1O[CH2CH(R1)O], or combinations of two or more thereof in which each R1 can be the same or different and is a hydrocarbyl radical having 1<br>
3	0      to about 10, preferably 1 to about 8, and most preferably 1 to 5 carbon atoms per<br>
radical. The presently preferred R1 is an alkyl radical, either branched or straight<br>
5<br><br>
WO 01/39885<br><br>
PCT/US00/02103<br><br>
chain. A is an alkylene radical having 2 to about 10, preferably 2 to about 7, and most preferably 2 to 4 carbon atoms per molecule. Each n can be the same or<br>
different and is independently a number in the range of from 1 about to about 10, preferably 1 to about 7, and most preferably 1 to 5. Examples of suitable solvents <br>
5     	include, but are not limited to. ethanol. propanol. isopropanol, butanoi, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, isopropylene glycol, butylene glycol, 1-methyl propylene glycol, pentylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol. 2-ethyl hexanol, and combinations of two or more thereof. The presently preferred solvent is water, ethylene glycol, or combinations thereof. The presently most <br>
10      preferred solvent is water.<br>
Alternatively, the solvent can be that which is formed on reaction  tetraalkyltitanate with the complexing agent such as, for example, isopropyl alcohol from tetraisopropyltitanate or n-butyl alcohol from tetra n-butyltitanate.<br>
According to the first embodiment of the present invention, the molar ratio <br>
15      of the complexing agent to titanium compound, can be any effective ratio that can substantially prevent the precipitation of the titanium compound in the presence of a solvent. Generally, the ratio can be in the range of from about 1:1 to about 10:1, preferably about 1:1 to about 7:1, and most preferably 1:1 to 4:1. The molar ratio of hypophosphorous acid or its salt to titanium compound (P:Ti) can be any ratio <br>
20      that, when the composition is used as catalyst to produce a polyester, can reduce the yellowness of the polyester. The preferred ratio can be in the range of from about 0.1:1 to about 10:1, preferably about 0.5:1 to about 7:1, and most preferably 1:1 to 4:1. A solvent can be present in the composition to produce a soluble or substantially soluble composition. Alternatively, the titanium compound can be <br>
25      present in the catalyst composition in the range of from about 0.01 to about 30, preferably about 0.1 to about 15, and most preferably 0.5 to 10 percent (%), based<br>
on total weight of the composition as 100 %.<br>
The catalyst composition can be produced by any means known to one skilled in the art.<br>
30	The catalyst composition can also be produced, in addition to water, in a<br>
second solvent that is compatible with or does not interfere with an esterification<br>
6<br><br>
WO 01/39885<br><br>
PCT/US00/02103<br><br>
or transesterification or polycondensation reaction. For example, if the catalyst composition is used as a polycondensation catalyst for producing polyethylene terephtalate, the composition is preferably produced in ethylene glycol; if the<br>
catalyst composition is used for producing polybutylene terephtalate, the <br>
5         composition is preferably produced in 1,4-butanediol; and if the catalyst<br>
composition is used for producing polypropylene terephtalate, the composition is preferably produced in 1,3-propylene glycol. For the production of dioctylphthalate. 2-ethylhexyl alcohol is preferred.<br>
While the individual components can be combined in any order, it is <br>
10      preferred to first combine a complexing agent and titanium compound, generally in a solvent, to produce a first mixture. The first mixture can then be combined with a second complexing agent, if present, to produce a second mixture. Generally the combination for producing the first or second mixture can be stirred and can be carried out at a temperature in the range of from about 0°C to about <br>
15      100°C, preferably about 20°C to about 50°C. Generally any amount of solvent can be used as long as the amount can substantially dissolve the composition and can be in the range of from about 5 to about 50, preferably about 10 to about 30, and most preferably 10 to 20 moles per mole of the titanium compound used in the composition. The first or second mixture is then combined with <br>
20      hypophosphorous acid or its salt to produce the composition of the invention.<br>
The production of the composition is preferably carried out under an inert atmosphere, such as nitrogen, carbon dioxide, helium, or combinations of two or more thereof to avoid liberating a flammable alcohol, if an alcohol is present because of the exothermic nature of the reaction.<br>
25		The quantities of individual components generally can be such that the<br>
molar ratio of each component to titanium in the catalyst compound produced is within the range disclosed above.<br>
According to the second embodiment of the present invention, a process that can be used in, for example, the production of an ester or polyester is<br>

Example 11<br>
The process for producing terephthalic acid oligomer is illustrated as follows. An autoclave was charged with 100 pounds (45.4 Kg) of terephthalic acid and 67 pounds (30.4 Kg) of ethylene glycol. The batch was heated to 240°C at an<br>
10      agitation speed of 15 rpm, and 21.6 lbs. (9.8 Kg) of water and 14.3 lbs. (6.5 Kg) of ethylene glycol removed. The charge was then heated to 275°C over the course of 90 minutes, and the remaining ethylene glycol removed at 285°C and below 2rnm Hg vacuum. Once the condensation mass was judged to be complete, the molten mass was extruded into an aqueous bath to solidify the product. The resultant<br>
15      oligomer was dried to remove residual moisture before use.<br>
Color of the resulting oligomer and any polymer produced therefrom was measured in terms of the L-value and b-value, using an instrument such as the SP-78 Spectrophotometer. The L-value shows brightness, with the greater the numerical value showing higher (desirable) brightness. The b-value shows the<br>
20      degree of yellowness, with a higher numerical value showing a higher (undesirable) degree of yellowness.<br>
A 1-liter resin kettle was provided with a Jiffy Mixer agitator rotating at 40 rpm, a thermocouple, condenser and nitrogen sweep. To this kettle was added the catalyst to be tested, 115 ml of ethylene glycol, and 400 g of terephthalic acid <br>
25      oligomer prepared above. The agitator was turned on and the temperature was increased to 275°C over a period of about 2.5 hours. The contents were polymerized by holding under agitation at 275°C and a pressure of 120 mm Hg<br>
for 20 minutes, and at 280°C and a pressure of 30 mm Hg for an additional<br>
20 minutes. The contents were then held under agitation at 285°C at 1 to 2 mm <br>
30     	Hg pressure for a time sufficient to reach 15 ounce-inch (0.106 Newton-meter)<br>
torque as measured by an Electro-Craft Motomatic torque controller. The time for<br>
14<br><br>
