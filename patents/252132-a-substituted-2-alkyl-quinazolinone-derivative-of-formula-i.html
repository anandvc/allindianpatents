				<td>The present invention relates to a substituted 2-alkyl quinazolinone derivative of formula (I).<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to inhibitors of PARP and provides compounds and compositions containing the disclosed compounds. Moreover, the present invention provides methods of using the disclosed PARP inhibitors for instance as a medicine.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The nuclear enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) is a member of the<br>
PARP enzyme family. This growing family of enzymes consist of PARPs such as, for<br>
example: PARP-1, PARP-2, PARP-3 and Vault-PARP; and Tankyrases (TANKs),<br>
such as, for example: TANK-1, TANK-2 and TANK-3. PARP is also referred to as<br>
poly(adenosine 5'-diphospho-ribose) polymerase or PARS (poly(ADP-ribose)<br>
synthetase).<br>
PARP-1 is a major nuclear protein of 116 kDa consisting of three domains: the N-terminal DNA binding domain containing two zinc fingers, the automodification domain and the C-terminal catalytic domain. It is present in almost all eukaryotes. The enzyme synthesizes poly(ADP-ribose), a branched polymer that can consist of over 200 ADP-ribose units. The protein acceptors of poly(ADP-ribose) are directly or indirectly involved in maintaining DNA integrity. They include histones, topoisomerases, DNA and RNA polymerases, DNA ligases, and Ca2+- and Mg2+-dependent endonucleases. PARP protein is expressed at a high level in many tissues, most notably in the immune system, heart, brain and germ-line cells. Under normal physiological conditions, there is minimal PARP activity. However, DNA damage causes an immediate activation of PARP by up to 500-fold.<br>
Tankyrases (TANKs) were identified as components of the human telomeric complex. They have also been proposed to have a role in vesicle trafficking and may serve as scaffolds for proteins involved in various other cellular processes. Telomeres, which are essential for chromosome maintenance and stability, are maintained by telomerase, a specialized reverse transcriptase. TANKs are (ADP-ribose)transferases with some features of both signalling and cytoskeletal proteins. They contain the PARP domain, which catalyses poly-ADP-ribosylation of substrate proteins, the sterile alpha motif, which is shared with certain signalling molecules and the ANK domain, which contains 24 ankyrin repeats homologues to the cytoskeletal protein ankyrin. The ANK domain interacts with a telomeric protein, Telomere Repeat binding Factor-1 (TRF-1). These proteins were therefore named TRF1-interacting, ankyrin-related ADP-ribose polymerase (TANKs).<br>
One of the more specific functions of TANK is the ADP-ribosylation of TRF-1. Human telomere function requires two telomere-specific DNA binding proteins, TRF-1 and TRF-2. TRF-2 protects chromosome ends, and TRF-1 regulates telomere length. ADP-ribosylation inhibits the ability of TRF-1 to bind to telomeric DNA. This poly-ADP-ribosylation of TRF-1 releases TRF-1 from the telomeres, opening up the telomeric complex and allow access to telomerase. Therefore, TANK functions as a positive regulator of telomere length., allowing elongation of the telomeres by telomerase.<br>
Among the many functions attributed to PARP, and especially PARP-1, is its major role in facilitating DNA repair by ADP-ribosylation and therefore co-ordinating a number of DNA repair proteins. As a result of PARP activation, NAD+ levels significantly decline. Extensive PARP activation leads to severe depletion of NAD* in cells suffering from massive DNA damage. The short half-life of poIy(ADP-ribose) results in a rapid turnover rate. Once poly(ADP-ribose) is formed, it is quickly degraded by the constitutively active poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARC), together with phosphodiesterase and (ADP-ribose) protein lyase. PARP and PARG form a cycle that converts a large amount of NAD'1" to ADP-ribose. In less than an hour, over-stimulation of PARP can cause a drop of NAD+ and ATP to less than 20% of the normal level. Such a scenario is especially detrimental during ischaemia when deprivation of oxygen has already drastically compromised cellular energy output. Subsequent free radical production during reperfusion is assumed to be a major cause of tissue damage. Part of the ATP drop, which is typical in many organs during ischaemia and reperfusion, could be linked to NAD* depletion due to poly(ADP-ribose) turnover. Thus, PARP or PARG inhibition is expected to preserve the cellular energy level thereby potentiating the survival of ischaemic tissues after insult.<br>
Poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis is also involved in the induced expression of a number of genes essential for inflammatory response. PARP inhibitors suppress production of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in macrophages, P-type selectin and intercellular adhesion moiecule-1 (ICAM-1) in endothelial cells. Such activity underlies the strong anti-inflammation effects exhibited by PARP inhibitors. PARP inhibition is able to reduce necrosis by preventing translocation and infiltration of neutrophils to the injured tissues.<br>
PARP is activated by damaged DNA fragments and, once activated, catalyzes the attachment of up to 100 ADP-ribose units to a variety of nuclear proteins, including histones and PARP itself. During major cellular stresses the extensive activation of PARP can rapidly lead to cell damage or death through depletion of energy stores. As four molecules of ATP are consumed for every molecule of NAD* regenerated, NAD* is depleted by massive PARP activation, in the efforts to re-synthesize NAD+, ATP may also become depleted.<br>
It has been reported that PARP activation plays a key role in both NMD A- and NO-induced neurotoxicity. This has been demonstrated in cortical cultures and in hippocampal slices wherein prevention of toxicity is directly correlated to PARP inhibition potency. The potential role of PARP inhibitors in treating neurodegenerative diseases and head trauma has thus been recognized even if the exact mechanism of action has not yet been elucidated.<br>
Similarly, it has been demonstrated that single injections of PARP inhibitors have reduced the infarct size caused by ischemia and reperfusion of the heart or skeletal muscle in rabbits. In these studies, a single injection of 3-amino-benzamide (10 mg/kg), either one minute before occlusion or one minute before reperfusion, caused similar reductions in infarct size in the heart (32-42%) while 1,5- dihydroxyisoquinoline (1 mg/kg), another PARP inhibitor, reduced infarct size by a comparable degree (38-48%) These results make it reasonable to assume that PARP inhibitors could salvage previously ischaemic heart or reperfusion injury of skeletal muscle tissue.<br>
PARP activation can also be used as a measure of damage following neurotoxic insults resulting from exposure to any of the following inducers like glutamate (via NMD A receptor stimulation), reactive oxygen intermediates, amyloid p-protein, N-methyl-4-phenyl-l,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) or its active metabolite N-methyl-4 phenylpyridine (MPP+), which participate in pathological conditions such as stroke, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Other studies have continued to explore the role of PARP activation in cerebellar granule cells in vitro and in MPTP neurotoxicity. Excessive neural exposure to glutamate, which serves as the predominate central nervous system neurotransmitter and acts upon the N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and other subtype receptors, most often occurs as a result of stroke or other neurodegenerative processes. Oxygen deprived neurons release glutamate in great quantities during ischaemic brain insult such as during a stroke or heart attack.<br>
This excess release of glutamate in turn causes over-stimulation (excitotoxicity) of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMD A), AMP A, Kainate and MGR receptors, which open ion channels and permit uncontrolled ion flow (e.g., Ca2+ and Na+ into the cells and K+ out of the cells) leading to overstimulation of the neurons. The over-stimulated neurons secrete more glutamate, creating a feedback loop or domino effect which ultimately results in cell damage or death via the production of proteases, lipases and free radicals. Excessive activation of glutamate receptors has been implicated in various neurological diseases and conditions including epilepsy, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Huntingdon's disease, schizophrenia, chronic pain, ischemia and neuronal loss following hypoxia, hypoglycernia, ischemia, trauma, and nervous insult. Glutamate exposure and stimulation has also been implicated as a basis for compulsive disorders, particularly drug dependence. Evidence includes findings in many animal species, as well as in cerebral cortical cultures treated with glutamate or NMD A, that glutamate receptor antagonists (i.e., compounds which block glutamate from binding to or activating its receptor) block neural damage following vascular stroke. Attempts to prevent excitotoxicity by blocking NMDA, AMP A, Kainate and MGR receptors have proven difficult because each receptor has multiple sites to which glutamate may bind and hence finding an effective mix of antagonists or universal antagonist to prevent binding of glutamate to all of the receptor and allow testing of this theory, has been difficult. Moreover, many of the compositions that are effective in blocking the receptors are also toxic to animals. As such, there is presently no known effective treatment for glutamate abnormalities. The stimulation of NMDA receptors by glutamate, for example, activates the enzyme neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), leading to the formation of nitric oxide (NO), which also mediates neurotoxicity. NMDA neurotoxicity may be prevented by treatment with nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors or through targeted genetic disruption of nNOS in vitro.<br>
Another use for PARP inhibitors is the treatment of peripheral nerve injuries, and the resultant pathological pain syndrome known as neuropathic pain, such as that induced by chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the common sciatic nerve and in which transsynaptic alteration of spinal cord dorsal horn characterized by hyperchromatosis of cytoplasm and nucleoplasm (so-called "dark" neurons) occurs.<br>
Evidence also exists that PARP inhibitors are useful for treating inflammatory bowel disorders, such as colitis. Specifically, colitis was induced in rats by intraluminal administration of the hapten trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid in 50% ethanol. Treated rats<br>
received 3- aminobenzamide, a specific inhibitor of PARP activity. Inhibition of PARP activity reduced the inflammatory response and restored the morphology and the energetic status of the distal colon.<br>
Further evidence suggests that PARP inhibitors are useful for treating arthritis. Further, PARP inhibitors appear to be useful for treating diabetes. PARP inhibitors have been shown to be useful for treating endotoxic shock or septic shock.<br>
PARP inhibitors have also been used to extend the lifespan and proliferative capacity of cells including treatment of diseases such as skin aging, Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, muscular dystrophy, degenerative diseases of skeletal muscle involving replicative senescence, age-related muscular degeneration, immune senescence, ADDS, and other immune senescence disease; and to alter gene expression of senescent cells.<br>
It is also known that PARP inhibitors, such as 3-amino benzamide, affect overall DNA repair in response, for example, to hydrogen peroxide or ionizing radiation.<br>
The pivotal role of PARP in the repair of DNA strand breaks is well established, especially when caused directly by ionizing radiation or, indirectly after enzymatic repair of DNA lesions induced by methylating agents, topoisomerases I inhibitors and other chemotherapeutic agents as cisplatin and bleomycin. A variety of studiesjusing "knockout" mice, trans-dominant inhibition models (over-expression of the DNA-binding domain), antisense and small molecular weight inhibitors have demonstrated the role of PARP in repair and cell survival after induction of DNA damage. The inhibition of PARP enzymatic activity should lead to an enhanced sensitivity of the tumor cells towards DNA damaging treatments.<br>
PARP inhibitors have been reported to be effective in radiosensitizing (hypoxic) tumor cells and effective in preventing tumor cells from recovering from potentially lethal and sublethal damage of DNA after radiation therapy, presumably by their ability to prevent DNA strand break rejoining and by affecting several DNA damage signaling pathways.<br>
PARP inhibitors have been used to treat cancer. In addition, U.S. Patent No.5,177,075 discusses several isoquinolines used for enhancing the lethal effects of ionizing radiation or chemotherapeutic agents on tumor cells. Weltin et al., "Effect of 6(5 -Phenanthridinone), an Inhibitor of Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase, on Cultured Tumor<br>
Cells", Oncol. Res., 6:9,399-403 (1994), discusses the inhibition of PART activity, reduced proliferation of tumor cells, and a marked synergjstic effect when tumor cells arc co- treated with an alkylating drug.<br>
Rieviews of the state of the art has been published by Li and Zhang in IDrugs 2001, 4(7): 804-812, by Ame et al in Bioassays 2004,26: 882-883 and by Nguewa et al., in Progress in Biophysic &amp; Molecular Biology 2005, 88: 143-172.<br>
There continues to be a need for effective and potent PARP inhibitors, and more particularly PARP-1 inhibitors which produce minimal side effects. The present invention provides compounds, compositions for, and methods of, inhibiting PARP activity for treating cancer and/or preventing cellular, tissue and/or organ damage resulting from cell damage or death due to, for example, necrosis or apoptosis. The compounds and compositions of the present invention are especially useful in enhancing the effectiveness of chemotherapy and radiotherapy where a primary effect of the treatment is that of causing DNA damage in the targeted cells,<br>

To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, an effective amount of a particular compound, in base or acid addition salt form, as the active ingredient is combined in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are desirably in unitary dosage form suitable, preferably, for administration orally, rectally, percutaneously, or by parenteral injection. For example, in preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed; such as, for example, water,<br>
glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, syrups, elixirs and solutions; or solid carriers such as starches, sugars, kaolin, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders, pills, capsules and tablets. Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. For parenteral compositions, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, at least in large part, though other ingredients, to aid solubility for example, may be included. Injectable solutions, for example, may be prepared in which the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture of saline and glucose solution. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. In the compositions suitable for percutaneous administration, the carrier optionally comprises a penetration enhancing agent and/or a suitable wetting agent, optionally combined with suitable additives of any nature in minor proportions, which additives do not cause a significant deleterious effect to the skin. Said additives may facilitate the administration to the skin and/or may be helpful for preparing the desired compositions. These compositions may be administered in various ways, e.g., as a transdermal patch, as a spot-on, as an ointment. It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used in the specification and claims herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such dosage unit forms are tablets (including scored or coated tablets), capsules, pills, powder packets, wafers, injcctable solutions or suspensions, teaspoonfuls, tablespoonfuls and the like, and segregated multiples thereof.<br>

Radiosensitizers are known to increase the sensitivity of cancerous cells to the toxic effects of ionizing radiation. Several mechanisms for the mode of action of radiosensitizers have been suggested in the literature including: hypoxic cell radiosensitizers ( e.g., 2- nitroimidazole compounds, and benzotriazine dioxide compounds) mimicking oxygen or alternatively behave like bioreductive agents under hypoxia; non-hypoxic cell radiosensitizers (e.g., halogenated pyrimidines) can be analogs of DNA bases and preferentially incorporate into the DNA of cancer cells and thereby promote the radiation-induced breaking of DNA molecules and/or prevent the normal DNA repair mechanisms; and various other potential mechanisms of action have been hypothesized for radiosensitizers in the treatment of disease. Many cancer treatment protocols currently employ radiosensitizers in conjunction with radiation of x-rays. Examples of x-ray activated radiosensitizers include, but are not limited to, the following: metronidazole, misonidazole, desmethylmisonidazole, pimonidazole, etanidazole, nimorazole, mitomycin C, RSU 1069, SR 4233, EO9, RB 6145, nicotinamide, 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BUdR), 5- iododeoxyuridine (lUdR), bromodeoxycytidine, fluorodeoxyuridine (FudR), hydroxyurea, cisplatin, and therapeutically effective analogs and derivatives of the same.<br>

Examples of photodynamic radiosensitizers include the following, but are not limited to: hematoporphyrin derivatives, Photofrin, benzoporphyrin derivatives, tin etioporphyrin, pheoborbide-a, bacteriochlorophyll-a, naphthalocyanines, phthalocyanines, zinc phthalocyanine, and therapeutically effective analogs and derivatives of the same.<br>
Radiosensitizers maybe administered in conjunction with a therapeutically effective amount of one or more other compounds, including but not limited to: compounds<br>
which promote the incorporation of radiosensitizers to the target cells; compounds which control the flow of therapeutics, nutrients, and/or oxygen to the target cells; chemotherapeutic agents which act on the tumor with or without additional radiation; or other therapeutically effective compounds for treating cancer or other disease. Examples of additional therapeutic agents that may be used in conjunction with radiosensitizers include, but are not limited to: 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, 5' -amino-5'deoxythymidine, oxygen, carbogen, red cell transfusions, perfluorocarbons (e.g., Fluosol 10 DA), 2,3-DPG, BW12C, calcium channel blockers, pentoxyfylline, antiangiogenesis compounds, hydralazine, and LBSO.

Pharmacological example<br>
In vitro Scintillation Proximity Assay (SPA) for PARP-1 inhibitory activity Compounds of the present invention were tested in an in vitro assay based on SPA technology (proprietary to Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).<br>
In principle, the assay relies upon the well established SPA technology for the detection of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of biotinylated target proteins, i.e histones. This ribosylation is induced using nicked DNA activated PARP-1 enzyme and [3ITJ-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ([3H]-NAD+) as ADP-ribosyl donor.<br>
As inducer of PARP-1 enzyme activity, nicked DNA was prepared. For this, 25 mg of DNA (supplier. Sigma) was dissolved in 25 ml DNAse buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 0.5 mg/ml Bovine Serum Albumine (BSA); 5 mM MgCl2.6H2O and 1 mM KC1) to which 50 /il DNAse solution (Img/ml in 0.15 M NaCl) was added. After an incubation of 90 rain, at 37 Â°C, the reaction was terminated by adding 1.45 g NaCl, followed by a further incubation at 58 Â°C for 15 min. The reaction mixture was cooled on ice and dialysed at 4 Â° C for respectively 1.5 and 2 hours against 1.5 1 of 0.2 M KC1, and twice against 1.5 1 of 0.01 M KC1 for 1.5 and 2 h respectively. The mixture was aliquoted and stored at-20 Â°C. Histones (1 mg/ml, type II-A, supplier: Sigma) were biotinylated using the biotinylation kit of Amersham and stored aliquoted at - 20 Â°C. A stock solution of 100 mg/ml SPA poly(vinyl toluene) (PVT) beads (supplier: Amersham) was made in PBS. A stock solution of [3H]-NAD+ was made by adding 120 pi of [3HJ-NAD+ (0.1 mCi/ml, supplier MEN) to 6 ml incubation buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8; 0.2 mM DTT; 4 mM MgCU). A solution of 4 mM NAD+ (supplier: Roche) was made in incubation buffer (from a 100 mM stock solution in water stored at - 20 Â°C). The PARP-1 enzyme was produced using art known techniques, i.e. cloning and expression of the protein starting from human liver cDNA. Information concerning the used protein sequence of the PARP-1 enzyme including literature references can be found in the Swiss-Prot database under primary accession number P09874. Biotinylated histones and PVT-SPA beads were mixed and pre-incubated for 30 min. at room temperature. PARP-1 enzyme (concentration was lot dependent) was mixed with the nicked DNA and the mixture was pre-incubated for 30 min. at 4 Â°C. Equal parts of this histones/PVT-SPA beads solution and PARP-1 enzyme/DNA solution were mixed and 75 jd-of this mixture together with 1 /il of compound in DMSO and 25 fifof [3H]-NAD* was added per well into a 96-well microtiterplate. The final concentrations in the incubation mixture were 2 Jig/ml for the biotinylated histones, 2 mg/ml for the PVT-SPA beads, 2 jig/ml for the nicked DNA and between 5-10 /tg/ml for the PARP-1 enzyme. After incubation of the mixture for 15 min. at room temperature, the reaction<br>
was terminated by adding 100 pi of 4 mM NAD4 in incubation buffer (final concentration 2 mM) and plates were mixed.<br>
The beads were allowed to sediment for at least 15 min. and plates transferred to a TopCountNXTâ„¢ (Packard) for scintillation counting, values were expressed as counts per minute (cpra). For each experiment, controls (containing PARP-1 enzyme and DMSO without compound), a blank incubation (containing DMSO but no PARP-1 enzyme or compound) and samples (containing PARP-1 enzyme and compound dissolved in DMSO) were run in parallel. All compounds tested were dissolved and eventually further diluted in DMSO. In first instance, compounds were tested at a concentration of 10"5M. When the compounds showed activity at 10~5M, a dose-response curve was made wherein the compounds were tested at concentrations between 10"^ and 10"8M. In each test, the blank value was subtracted from both the control and the sample values. The control sample represented maximal PARP-1 enzyme activity. For each sample, the amount of cpm was expressed as a percentage of the mean cpm value of the controls. When appropriate, ICso-values (concentration of the drug, needed to reduce the PARP-1 enzyme activity to 50% of the control) were computed using linear interpolation between the experimental points just above and below the 50 % level. Herein the effects of test compounds are expressed as pICjo (the negative log value of the ICso-value). As a reference compound, 4-amino-l,8-naphthalimide was included to validate the SPA assay. The tested compounds showed inhibitory activity at the initial test concentration of 10~5M (see Tabel-2).<br>
In vitro filtration assay for PARP-1 inhibitory activity<br>
Compounds of the present invention were tested in an in vitro filtration assay assessing PARP-1 activity (triggered in the presence of nicked DNA) by means of its histone poly (ADP-ribosyl)ation activity using [32P]-NAD as ADP-ribosyl donor. The radioactive ribosylated histones were precipitated by trichloroacetic acid (TCA) in 96-well filterplates and the incorporated [32P] measured using a scintillation counter<br>
A mixture of histones (stock solution: 5 mg/ml in H2O), NAD* (stock solution: 100 mM in H2O), and [32P]-NAD+ in incubation buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8; 0.2 mM DTT; 4 mM MgCh) was made. A mixture of the PARP-1 enzyme (5 - 10 jig/ml) and nicked DNA was also made. The nicked DNA was prepared as described in the in vitro SPA for PARP-1 inhibitory activity. Seventy-five /il of the PARP-1 enzyme/DNA mixture together with 1 ]n\ of compound in DMSO and 25 pi of histones-NAD+/[32P]-NAD+ mixture was added per well of a 96-well filterplate (0.45 (im, supplier<br>
Millipore). The final concentrations in the incubation mixture were 2 ftg/ml for the histones, 0.1 mM for the NAD*, 200 fM (0.5 /iC) for the [32P]-NAD+ and 2 ng/ml for the nicked DNA. Plates were incubated for 15 min. at room temperature and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 10 ^1 ice cold 100% TCA followed by the addition of 10 Jil ice-cold BSA solution (1 % in H2O). The protein fraction was allowed to precipitate for 10 min. at 4 Â°C and plates were vacuum filtered . The plates were subsequently washed with, for each well, 1 ml of 10 % ice cold TCA, 1 ml of 5 % ice cold TCA and 1 ml of 5 % TCA at room temperature. Finally 100 /il of scintillation solution (Microscint 40, Packard) was added to each well and the plates were transferred to a TopCountNXTâ„¢ (supplier: Packard) for scintillation counting and values were expressed as counts per minute (cpm). For each experiment, controls (containing PARP-1 enzyme and DMSO without compound), a blank incubation (containing DMSO but no PARP-1 enzyme or compound) and samples (containing PARP-1 enzyme and compound dissolved in DMSO) were run in parallel. All compounds tested were dissolved and eventually further diluted in DMSO. In first instance, compounds were tested at a concentration of 10"SM. When the compounds showed activity at 10"5M, a dose-response curve was made wherein the compounds were tested at concentrations between 10"5M and 10"8M. In each test, me blank value was subtracted from both the control and the sample values. The control sample represented maximal PARP-1 enzyme activity. For each sample, the amount of cpm was expressed as a percentage of the mean cpm value of the controls. When appropriate, ICso-values (concentration of the drug, needed to reduce the PARP-1 enzyme activity to 50% of the control) were computed using linear interpolation between the experimental points just above and below the 50 % level. Herein the effects of test compounds are expressed as pICso (the negative log value of the ICso-value). As a reference compound, 4-amino-l,8-naphthalimide was included to validate the filtration assay. The tested compounds showed inhibitory activity at the initial test concentration of 10"5M (see Tabel-2).<br>

In principle, the assay relies upon SPA technology for the detection of auto-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of TANK-2 protein using [3H]-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ([3Hi-NAD+) as ADP-ribosyl donor.<br>
A stock solution of [3H]-NAD+/NAD was made by adding 64.6 (il of [3H]-NAD* (0.1 mCi/ml, supplier: Perkin Elmer) and 46.7 /il NAD-stock (10.7 mM, stored at - 20 Â°C, supplier Roche) to 1888.7 fil assay buffer (60 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4; 0.9 mMDTT; 6 mMMgCl2). The TANK-2 enzyme was produced as described in EP1238063 . 60/il of assay buffer, together with 1 fil of compound in DMSO, 20 fil of [3H]-NAD+/NAD and 20 jjl\ of TANK-2 enzyme (final concentration 6 /ig/ml) was added per well into a 96-well Ni-coated flash plate (Perkin Elmer), After incubation of the mixture for 120 rain, at room temperature, the reaction was terminated by adding 60 jil of stopsolution (42.6 mg NAD in 6 ml HaO). The plates were covered with a plate sealer and placed in aTopCountNXTâ„¢ (Packard) for scintillation counting. Values were expressed as counts per minute (cpm). For each experiment, controls (containing TANK-2 enzyme and DMSO without compound), a blank incubation (containing DMSO but no TANK-2 enzyme or compound) and samples (containing TANK-2 enzyme and compound dissolved in DMSO) were run in parallel. All compounds tested were dissolved and eventually further diluted in DMSO. In first instance, compounds were tested at a concentration of 10"5M. When the compounds showed activity at 10"5 M, a dose-response curve was made wherein the compounds were tested at concentrations between 10"5M and 10'8M. In each test, the blank value was subtracted from both the control and the sample values. The control sample represented maximal TANK-2 enzyme activity. For each sample, the amount of cpm was expressed as a percentage of the mean cpm value of the controls. When appropriate, ICso-values (concentration of the drug, needed to reduce the TANK-2 enzyme activity to 50% of the control) were computed using linear interpolation between the experimental points just above and below the 50 % level. Herein the effects of test compounds are expressed as pICso (the negative log value of the ICso-value). As reference compounds, 3-aminobenzamide and 4-amino-l,8-naphtalimide were included to validate the SPA assay. Herein the assay was described using 96-well plates. In the assay using 384-well plates the same final concentrations were used and volumes were adapted If 96-well plate results were available these results were incorporated in Table-2, otherwise the results from the 384-well plate assay were shown.<br>
The compounds can be further evaluated in a cellular chemo- and/or radiosensitization assay, an assay measuring inhibition of endogenous PARP-1 activity in cancer cell lines and eventually in an in vivo radiosensitization test<br><br><br><br><br><br>
