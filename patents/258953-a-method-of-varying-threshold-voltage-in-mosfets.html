				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a method of varying threshold voltage in<br>
closely located MOSFETs.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Many of the novel application with electronics are possible because<br>
of integrated circuits where devices in a circuit are fabricated or. a single<br>
silicon wafer. One of the key advantages of this is that the characteristics<br>
of the devices are very close to each other which make the functionality<br>
of the circuit predictable.<br>
However, for some selected circuits, transistors are needed to have<br>
different threshold voltage. This may be needed to achieve different on<br>
currents (for higher speed) or off currents (for lower sub-threshold<br>
leakage) in selected transistors. This is often accomplished in the<br>
industry by allowing different gate oxide thickness and/or threshold<br>
adjust implant. Due to lithographic and implantation limits, it<br>
becomes difficult to place transistor devices with different threshold<br>
voltages next to each other sufficiently close to achieve compactness of<br>
circuits. This results in extra cost by way of chip real-estate. This real<br>
estate cost can become particularly significant in replicated circuits,<br>
such as SRAMS, where each unit may be replicated many tens of<br>
thousands of times.<br>
The present invention suggests a method of varying the 'hrcshok!<br>
of at least two transistors which can be located next to each otherlocated<br>
as close as the technology will allow any two transistors lo be<br>
located with no extra processing cost.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of the present invention is to propose a method<br>
of varying threshold voltage in MOSFETs located on the same chip.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose a method of<br>
varying threshold voltage in closely located MOSFETs.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to propose a method<br>
of varying threshold voltage in closely located MOSFETs which is cost<br>
effective as compared to the prior art.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose a method of<br>
varying threshold voltage in closely located MOSFETs which involves less<br>
number of steps as compared to the known art.<br>
Further object of the present invention is to propose a method of<br>
varying threshold voltage in closely located MOSFETs which allows the<br>
transistors to be located close to each other.<br>
Still further object of the present invention is to propose a method<br>
of varying threshold voltage in closely located MOSFETs which allows<br>
compactness of circuits.<br>
STATEMENT OF THE INVNETION<br>
According to this invention there is provided a mot hod of varying<br>
threshold voltage in closely located MOSFETs comprising the steps of<br>
varying the spacing between the selective buried insulating layer<br>
disposed under the source and drain of the MOSFET, where the<br>
insulating layer is such as silicon dioxide or any other appropriate<br>
insulator.<br>
Further, according to this invention there is provided a method of<br>
varying threshold voltage in closely located MOSFETs comprising steps of<br>
positioning of the MOSFETs on a chip with different spacing between ?.heburied<br>
insulating layer disposed under the source and drain of *ho<br>
MOSFET; and increasing or decreasing the difference in the threshold<br>
voltages between the different devices by biasing the well ve/Jve V.MM<br>
the source of the MOSFET to obtain larger/smaller threshold volumes<br>
differences between the devices.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWING<br>
Further objects and advantages of this invention will be more<br>
apparent from the ensuing description when read in conjunction with the<br>
accompanying drawing and wherein:<br>
Figure . 1 shows the SELective Buried OXide (SELBOX) structure<br>
with buried oxide under the source and drain of the MOSFET.<br>
Figure .2 shows the plot showing threshold (Vt) variation in<br>
NMOSFET with different substrate bias.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION WITH REFERENCE TO<br>
ACCOMPANYING DRAWING.<br>
The proposed application provides a method of varying threshold<br>
voltage in closely located MOSFETs, which may be explained with the<br>
help of the following embodiments b}<r way of example without restricting></r>
the scope of the invention to the same.<br>
First Embodiment<br>
The threshold of the transistor devices is a function of the spacing<br>
of the selective buried oxide (SELBOX). The threshold voltage increases<br>
or decreases as the SELBOX spacing increases or decreases respectively.<br>
Thus, when the device is being fabricated using the SELBOX technology<br>
of the present invention, the spacing in the buried oxide of the transistor<br>
may be increased to obtain a transistor with a larger threshold voltage.<br>
Second Embodiment<br>
It has also been observed that the effect of the body bias in the<br>
transistor is different for transistors with different spacing between the<br>
SELBOX. As the spacing is increased, there is larger and larger body<br>
effect. This allows the adjustment of the threshold in two ways:<br>
1. When the devices are placed with the standard (minimum) spacing<br>
in a common doped well and the well is forward biased w.r.t. the<br>
device source, the threshold voltages of the devices which have<br>
larger SELBOX spacing will be incremented by a larger value<br>
compared to devices with smaller SELBOX spacing.<br>
2. When the devices are placed with the standard (minimum) spacing<br>
in a common doped well and the well is forward biased w.r.t. the<br>
device source, then the threshold voltage of the devices which have<br>
larger SELBOX spacing will be decreased by a larger value<br>
compared to devices with smaller SELBOX spacing.<br>
Thus, by appropriate well biasing, different variation in threshold<br>
voltages can be achieved in devices which are located next to each other.<br>
For example: in the 65 nm technology, the targeted minimum<br>
spacing in the buried oxide is 65 nm. In the 90 nm technology, (he<br>
targeted minimum spacing in the buried oxide is 90 nm.<br>
The pitch of two transistors of the same type with different<br>
threshold voltage for a 65 nm technology is -65 + 200 nm wherein in the<br>
conventional methods, the spacing between two transistors is typically<br>
~=65 + 200 + 200 nm; and in 90 nm technology is -90 + 270 nm wherein<br>
in the conventional methods, the spacing between two transistors is<br>
typically —90 + 270 + 270 nm.<br>
By making devices with different spacing in the SELBOX. different<br>
threshold voltages in MOSFETs can be achieved. The spacing<br>
between different threshold voltage MOSFETs can be much lower<br>
by this approach than the spacing allowed by threshold adjust<br>
implant process or multiple gate oxide processes know, as of today.<br>
The well bias may be used to change the nature of the circuit on<br>
the same chip by changing the relative threshold voltages in<br>
different threshold voltage devices.<br>
SOI, bulk and SELBOX device may all be fabricated on the same<br>
wafer with minimum spacing between each of them using any of the<br>
known SELBOX processing techniques in prior art and all of them will<br>
have different threshold voltage.<br>
In the existing processes, in order to get different threshold voltage<br>
for adjacent transistors, typically two approaches are taken: (i) use of<br>
different dose for the threshold adjust implant and/or (ii) use of different<br>
gate oxide thickness. The approaches known today need lithography to<br>
separate the transistors with different threshold adjust implant dose or<br>
to obtain varying oxide thickness. These lithography steps are low<br>
resolution (or they become too costly if one opts for high resolution<br>
lithography). Also, the very nature of implantation mandates a minimum<br>
distance between device that is getting the implant and the device that is<br>
not getting the implant. So, to achieve different threshold voltage<br>
transistors, the spacing between them has to be larger than the spacing<br>
achievable in the present invention.<br>
In the current invention, for a fabrication process where transistors<br>
are fabricated with selective buried oxide under them, multiple threshold<br>
transistors can be achieved with no extra processing steps. The threshold<br>
variation is achieved by varying the spacing between the selective buried<br>
oxide. The varying spacing is implemented by appropriate mask layou;<br>
and hence the processing steps are not modified in any way to achieve<br>
the multiple threshold transistors.<br>
The chief advantage of the current invention is the possibility of<br>
placing transistors of different threshold voltages in close proximity to<br>
each other. Moreover, for a fabrication process where transistors are<br>
fabricated with selective buried oxide under them, no extra steps will be<br>
needed to achieve different threshold voltage on neighbouring<br>
transistors.<br>
is to be noted that the present invention is susceptible to<br>
modifications, adaptations and changes by those skilled in the art. Such<br>
variant embodiments employing the concepts and features of this<br>
invention are intended to be within the scope of the presem invention,<br>
