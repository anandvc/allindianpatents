CUTTER, CUTTING METHOD, APPARATUS FOR PRODUCING INTERLABIAL PAD,<br>
AND METHOD FOR PRODUCING THE SAME<br>
A CUTTER FOR CUTTING OUT A MEMBER FROM A CONTINUOUS<br>
SHEET BASE MATERIAL<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates, for example, to a cutter,<br>
an apparatus for producing an interlabial pad comprising the<br>
cutter, a cutting method, and a method for producing the<br>
interlabial pad comprising the cutting method.<br>
RELATED ART<br>
Conventionally, cutters for cutting continuous sheet base<br>
materials have been known (for example, see the Laid-Open<br>
Japanese Patent Publication HEI 8-52696). A cutter disclosed<br>
in the Laid-Open Japanese Patent Publication HEI 8-52696<br>
comprises, for example, a die cut roller which has a blade and<br>
an anvil roller being spaced under the die cut roller. Suction<br>
holes are provided in the portion within the blade of the die<br>
cut roller.<br>
With this cutter, sanitary products are cut out from a raw<br>
material sheet by the blade through supplying the raw material<br><br>
sheet between the rollers. Then, the cut-out sanitary product<br>
is conveyed while being kept on the surface of the die cut roller<br>
by being sucked with a suction device.<br>
However, with the above-described cutter, a remainder of<br>
the raw material sheet after the sanitary product is cut out<br>
may interfere with the cut-out sanitary product and cause<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a cutter<br>
which can prevent the cut-out members being dislocated.<br>
Specifically, the present invention provides the<br>
followings.<br>
(1) A cutter for cutting out a member from a continuous<br>
sheet base material, comprising: conveying means, for conveying<br>
a continuous sheet base material along a continuing direction<br>
of the continuous sheet base material; cutting means, having<br>
a cutting blade and a driving mechanism for bringing the cutting<br>
blade into or from substantially a center in a width direction<br>
of the conveyed base material, for cutting out the member by<br>
pressing the cutting blade against the base material; member<br>
discharging means for discharging the cut-out member; dividing<br>
means for dividing abasematerial remainder, which is a remainder<br>
of the base material after the member is cut out, into two parts<br>
along the continuing direction of the base material; and base<br>
material remainder discharging means for discharging the divided<br>
base material remainders in directions away from each other.<br>
Examples of the base material may be absorbent materials<br>
which can absorb liquid. Specifically, the absorbent material<br>
contains, for example, hydrophilic fibers such as pulp, super<br>
absorbent polymer (SAP), synthetic fibers or their mixture. For<br>
example, SAP having about 310 g/m2 by a weight per unit, pulp<br>
having about 400 g/m2 by a weight per unit, furthermore, pulp<br><br>
containing about 20 to 30 % synthetic fiber by a weight per unit.<br>
Further, the thickness of the base material may be uniform<br>
or ununiform.<br>
The cutting blade is an edge, and there is no limit to the<br>
number and the shape thereof. The cutting blade may be mounted<br>
on the surface of a block or a roller. Also, the cutting blade<br>
may be moved relatively in the direction along a surface of the<br>
base material when the cutting blade is pressed against the base<br>
material. Further, the cutting blade may cut out two members<br>
at the same time.<br>
Examples of the conveying means may be a roller, belt<br>
conveyer, and the like.<br>
Examples of the member discharging means and the base<br>
material remainder discharging means may be free fall of the<br>
member or the base material remainder due to its own weight in<br>
addition to the roller, the belt conveyer and the like.<br>
The members are used as sanitary products, diapers, and<br>
other absorbent articles, and the shapes may be determined as<br>
appropriate.<br>
Like the base material, it is preferable that the base<br>
material remainder is in a continuous form so that the base<br>
material remainder can be easily discharged by simply pulling<br>
the base material remainder.<br>
Discharging the two divided base material remainders in<br>
directions away from each other may mean to discharge them in<br>
such directions that the distance between the two base material<br>
remainders after cutting out the members increases.<br><br>
 Specifically, tne two divided base material remainders may be<br>
discharged to be extended on both sides of the discharging<br>
direction of the member. At this time, the angle between the<br>
discharging dicetions of the two divided base material<br>
remainders and the discharging direction of the base material<br>
may be determined as appropriate. However, with a large angle,<br>
the member and the base material remainder can be easily separated<br>
by utilizing the resistance of the member and the base material<br>
remainder to deformation.<br>
According to the present invention, the member and the base<br>
material remainder can be surely separated so that the<br>
dislocations of the cut-out members can be prevented.<br>
(2) The cutter described above, wherein the base material<br>
remainder discnarging means discharges the base material<br>
remainder in a thickness direction of the member at a<br>
predetermined angle to the discharging direction of the cut-out<br>
member.<br>
The base material is in a sheet form so that it is difficult<br>
to be bent in the width direction. However, it can be easily<br>
bent in the thickness direction. Therefore, it is preferable<br>
to discharge the two divided base material remainder in the<br>
thickness direction at a predetermined angle to the discharging<br>
direction of the member.<br>
(3) The cutter described above, wherein the base material<br>
remainder discnarging means discharges the base material<br>
remainder in substantially the same direction as the discharging<br>
direction of the member viewed from a width direction of the<br><br>
member.<br>
Substantially the same direction as the discharging<br>
direction of the member viewed from the width direction of the<br>
membermeans that there is no above-describedpredeterminedangle<br>
in the thickness direction of the member between the discharging<br>
direction of the base material remainder and the discharging<br>
direction of the member. Therefore, according to the present<br>
invention, there is no bending stress in the thickness direction<br>
of the base material so that the member can be surely cut out<br>
from the base material having small flexural yield strength in<br>
the thickness direction.<br>
Also, when the bending rigidity of the member in the<br>
thickness direction is high, the member and the base material<br>
remainder can be surely separated by, for example, providing<br>
the angle between the discharging direction of the member and<br>
the discharging direction of the base material remainder to be<br>
about 0 ° viewed from the thickness direction of the member and<br>
about 5 ° viewed from the width direction of the member.<br>
(4) The cutter described above, wherein tensile strength<br>
of the base material remainder in the continuing direction is<br>
higher than that of the member in the continuing direction.<br>
The base material remainder is divided into two in a<br>
direction along the discharging direction of the member. Thus,<br>
according to the present invention, the base material remainder<br>
can be pulled for discharging thereof even if the tensile strength<br>
of the member is low.<br>
(5) The cutter described above, wherein the base material<br><br>
is embossed and an embossing rate of the base material remainder<br>
is higher than that of the member.<br>
Embossing includes thermal embossing, ultrasonic sealing<br>
and the like. Embossing may be arranged, for example, in lines,<br>
dots and the like. When the member is used as an absorbent body<br>
of an interlabial pad, it is preferable to be in dots in<br>
consideration of the comfortableness of the interlabial pad.<br>
In this case, embossing on the base material remainder is<br>
preferable to be, for example, within the range of 0.3 to 1.0<br>
mm2 arranged at 0.5 to 2 mm intervals.<br>
According to the present invention, the tensile strength<br>
increases as the embossing rate increases. Therefore, the<br>
tensile strength of the base material remainder can be increased<br>
even when the tensile strength of the member is low so that the<br>
base material remainder can be surely discharged by pulling.<br>
(6) The cutter described above, wherein said embossing is<br>
uniformly applied in the continuing direction of the base<br>
material.<br>
According to the present invention, the tensile strength<br>
in the continuing direction of the base material can be made<br>
uniform so that the base material remainder enables to be<br>
prevented from an accidental breaking when the base material<br>
remainder is pulled.<br>
(7) The cutter described above, wherein said dividing means<br>
divides the base material remainder into two parts by said cutting<br>
blade.<br>
The term "dividing one into two" here includes the state<br><br>
where the base material remainder is visually completely<br>
separated into two and the state where it is practically separated<br>
into two even though the two parts appear to be in contact.<br>
(8) The cutter described above, wherein said dividing means<br>
comprises cutting-plane-line-forming means which enables to<br>
divide the base material remainder into two parts by forming<br>
a cutting plane line on the base material remainder along the<br>
continuing direction thereof.<br>
(9) The cutter described above, wherein the cutting plane<br>
line is a slit.<br>
The cutting plane line may be formed through the member<br>
in the thickness direction or formed into a half-way in the<br>
thickness direction of the member. The length and the shape<br>
of the cutting plane line are not limited, and it may be in a<br>
straight line or a curbed line. Also, the number of the cutting<br>
plane line is not specifically limited.<br>
(10) The cutter described above, wherein the driving<br>
mechanism comprises a roller and a rotating mechanism for<br>
rotating said roller, and the cutting blade is a blade provided<br>
on the roller; and wherein the rotating mechanism rotates said<br>
roller so that the blade presses against the base material,<br>
thereby cutting out the member from the base material.<br>
(1l) The cutter described above, wherein the member is<br>
an absorbent body.<br>
It is preferable to form the absorbent body with a material<br>
which is bulky and hard to be deformed. Examples of the materials<br>
for forming the absorbent body may be pulp, chemical pulp,<br><br>
pulverized pulp, rayon, acetate, natural cotton, air laid pulp<br>
to which chemical bonding is applied, super absorbent polymer,<br>
super absorbent polymer fiber, synthetic fiber, and a material<br>
obtained by mixing them appropriately.<br>
Specifically, an example of the absorbent body may be a<br>
nonwoven sheet with 50 to 250 g/m2 and 2 to 5 mm bulkiness, which<br>
is obtained by preparing a sheet through entangling fiber, in<br>
which 60 to 90 % of rayon or acetate within the range of 1.1<br>
to 6.6 dtex and 10 to 40 % of super absorbent polymer fiber are<br>
laminated by this mixing ratio, by needling.<br>
(12) An apparatus for producing an interlabial pad,<br>
comprising the cutter described above.<br>
(13) A cutting method for cutting out a member by pressing<br>
a cutting blade against a continuous sheet base material,<br>
comprising the step of: conveying the base material along a<br>
continuing direction; cutting out the member by pressing the<br>
cutting blade against the base material; discharging the cut-out<br>
member; dividing a base material remainder, which is a remainder<br>
of the base material after the member is cut out, into two parts<br>
along the continuing direction of the base material; and;<br>
discharging the divided base material remainders in the<br>
directions away from each other.<br>
(14) The cutting method described above, wherein, in the<br>
discharging step, the base material remainder is discharged in<br>
a thickness direction of the member at a predetermined angle<br>
to the discharging direction of the member.<br>
(15) The cutting method described above, wherein, in the<br><br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Embodiments of the present invention will be described<br>
hereinafter by referring to the accompanying drawings. In the<br>
description of the embodiments below, the same numerals are<br><br>
applied to the same structural elements and the description<br>
therefore will be omitted or simplified.<br>
First Embodiment<br>
Structure of an apparatus for producing interlabial pad<br>
Fig. 1 shows an apparatus for producing an interlabial pad<br>
comprising a cutter according to the first embodiment of the<br>
present invention.<br>
An interlabial pad producing apparatus 1 includes a raw<br>
material supplier 11, a bonding-fixing unit 12, a protruded-area<br>
forming unit 13, a mini-sheet piece attaching unit 14, a folding<br>
unit 15, a cutting unit 16, and a product conveyer 17.<br>
In the raw material supplier 11, a continuous base material<br>
130 wound on a rawmaterial roller 130A is fed from the rawmaterial<br>
roller 130A to a cutter 10. In the cutter 10, absorbent bodies<br>
23 are cut out from the continuous base material 130, and the<br>
absorbent bodies 23 are transferred in the arrow direction. The<br>
cutter 10 will be described later.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2A and Fig. 2B, four slits 39a, 39b, 39c<br>
are formed in the absorbent body 23 by the cutter 10. The center<br>
slit 39b is formed so that the absorbent body 23 can be easily<br>
bent. The both ends slits 39a are formed so that the mini-sheet<br>
piece to be described later can be easily attached. The<br>
mountain-shaped slit 39c is formed for fitting fingers of a wearer<br>
to the: interlabial pad when the pad is worn.<br>
In the raw material supplier 11, a top sheet continuous<br>
member 110 wound on a raw material roller 110A is fed to an<br>
adhesive-applying device 112 from the raw material roller 110A<br><br>
through a meander-correcting device 111. Then, a hot-melt<br>
adhesive is applied onto the top sheet continuous member 110<br>
in the adhesive-applying device 112, and it is sent over a roller<br>
113.<br>
Further, in the raw material supplier 11, a back sheet<br>
continuous member 120 wound on a raw material roller 120A is<br>
fed to an adhesive-applying device 122 from the raw material<br>
roller 120A through a meander-correcting device 121. Then,<br>
hot-melt adhesive is applied onto the back sheet continuous<br>
member 120 in the adhesive-applying device 122 and it is sent<br>
under a roller 123.<br>
Thereby, the top sheet continuous member 110 and the back<br>
sheet continuous member 120 sandwich therebetween the absorbent<br>
body 23.<br>
In the bonding-fixing unit 12, the top sheet continuous<br>
member 110, the back sheet continuous member 120, and the<br>
absorbent body 23 are pressed between an upper shaft roller 61<br>
and a lower shaft roller 62. Thereby, the top sheet continuous<br>
member 110 and the back sheet continuous member 120 are bonded<br>
and fixed with the absorbent body 23 therebetween, and a<br>
continuous absorbent layer 220 is formed.<br>
In the protruded-area forming unit 13, the continuous<br>
absorbent layer 220 is made into a V-shape toward the downstream.<br>
Thus, the absorbent member of the complete interlabial pad has<br>
a convex protruded area along the center line.<br>
In the mini-sheet piece attaching unit 14, a mini-sheet<br>
piece continuous member 140 wound on a raw material roller 140A<br><br>
is fed to an adhesive-applying device 142 from the raw material<br>
roller 140A through a meander-correcting device 141. Then,<br>
hot-melt adhesive is applied onto the mini-sheet piece continuous<br>
member 140 in the adhesive-applying device 142.<br>
The mini-sheet piece continuous member 140 to which the<br>
hot-melt adhesive is applied is kept on a roller with suction<br>
143. In this state, it is cut into a predetermined length by<br>
a cut roller including a cutting blade.<br>
The mini-sheet piece cut into the predetermined length is<br>
sent to the back sheet continuous member 120 side of the continuous<br>
absorbent layer 220 and laminated with the continuous absorbent<br>
layer 220 being bent in V-letter shape.<br>
A folding unit 15 includes a roller 80A, a roller 81A<br>
orthogonally provided on the roller 80A, and a conveyer belt<br>
wound around the rollers 80A and 81A.<br>
The continuous absorbent layer 220 is conveyed on the<br>
conveyer belt so that both sides of the continuous absorbent<br>
layer 220 are folded. Then, the folded continuous absorbent<br>
layer 220 gradually is changed to the horizontal position.<br>
The cutting unit 16 includes a lower shaft roller 92, and<br>
an upper shaft roller 91 having a cutter blade. In the cutting<br>
unit 16, the lower shaft roller 92 and the upper shaft roller<br>
91 press and cut the continuous absorbent layer 220 with<br>
mini-sheet piece so as to form an elliptic-shape interlabial<br>
pad.<br>
Completed individual interlabial pads formed as described<br>
are conveyed by the product conveyer 17 and then go through<br><br>
wrapping and packaging steps for shipment.<br>
Structure of Cutter<br>
Fig. 3 shows the cutter 10.<br>
The cutter 10 includes a cutting mechanism 21 for cutting<br>
out the absorbent bodies 23 from the continuous base material<br>
130 as well as for forming trim absorbent bodies 133a and 133c<br>
by dividing a base material remainder 131, which is the remainder<br>
of the continuous base material 130 after the absorbent body<br>
23 is cut out thereof, into two. Also, the cutter 10 includes<br>
a transporting conveyer 22 as member discharging means for<br>
discharging the absorbent bodies 23 and a base material remainder<br>
discharging mechanism 24 as base material remainder discharging<br>
means for discharging each of the trim absorbent bodies 133a<br>
and 133c toward the directions away from each other.<br>
The cutting mechanism 21 includes a cutting roller 64, a<br>
driving motor (not shown) as a driving mechanism for rotating<br>
the cutting roller 64, and a backing roller 66 arranged at a<br>
predetermined space between the cutting roller 64. Here, the<br>
cutting roller 64, and driving motor, comprises the driving<br>
mechanism described in the claim. Also, the cutting mechanism<br>
21, comprises the means for conveying, means for cutting, and<br>
means for dividing.<br>
A cutting blade 65 having the edge at the end portion<br>
protrudes from the cutting roller 64. Also, inside the cutting<br>
blade 65, a sponge with high rebound elasticity is provided<br>
partially or entirely.<br>
The backing roller 66 is pressed against the cutting roller<br><br>
64 with a predetermined pressure, and the surface of the backing<br>
roller 66 is made soft so as not to damage the edge of the cutting<br>
blade 65. The rotation of the backing roller 66 synchronizes<br>
with the rotation of the cutting roller 64 so that no shear force<br>
occurs in the cutting blade 65.<br>
The continuous base material 130 is a continuous sheet and<br>
includes center part 130b, and two side parts 130a, 130c in the<br>
width direction.<br>
The continuous base material 130 wound on the raw material<br>
roller 130A (see Fig. 1) is supported by the raw material roller<br>
130A at its one end and pinched between the cutting roller 64<br>
and the backing roller 66 at the other end, and placed a<br>
predetermined tension on thereto.<br>
The base material remainder discharging mechanism 24<br>
includes a suction device (not shown) for sucking each of the<br>
trim absorbent bodies 133a, 133c in the directions of arrows<br>
138a and 138c shown in Fig. 3, and take-up devices (not shown)<br>
for taking up each of the trim absorbent bodies, respectively,<br>
which are sucked by the suction device.<br>
With the cutter 10 as described, upon starting the driving<br>
motor, the cutting roller 64 rotates and the continuous base<br>
material 130 is conveyed from the raw material roller 130A toward<br>
the cutting device 10 along its continuing direction. At the<br>
same time, due to the rotation of the cutting roller 64, the<br>
cutting blade 65 approaches substantially the center of the<br>
continuous base material 130 in the width direction to press<br>
against the continuous base material 130. Thereby, there is<br><br>
a cutting plane line 29 (see Fig. 4A to Fig. 4D) formed on the<br>
continuous base material 130 by the cutting blade 65 of the cutting<br>
roller 64, and the absorbent body 23 as a member in a predetermined<br>
shape is cut out from the center part 130b. The absorbent body<br>
23 is pushed out by the rotation of the cutting roller 64 and<br>
conveyed on the transporting conveyer 22.<br>
On the other hand, the base material remainder 130, which<br>
is the remainder of the continuous base material 131 after the<br>
absorbent body 23 is cut out, is cut into two in the continuing<br>
direction of the continuous base material 130 by the cutting<br>
plane lines 29, 30 (see Fig. 5) formed by the cutting blade 65,<br>
and thereby formed into the trim absorbent bodies 133a, 133c.<br>
The trim absorbent bodies 133a, 133c are discharged by the base<br>
material remainder discharging mechanism 24 in the directions<br>
away from each other, that is, in the directions of arrows 138a,<br>
138c.<br>
the directions of taking up the trim absorbent bodies 133a,<br>
133c (directions of arrows 138a, 138c) by the base material<br>
remainder discharging mechanism 24 and the discharging<br>
direction of absorbent body 23 make a predetermined angle in<br>
the thickness direction of the absorbent body 23 . Specifically,<br>
the predetermined angle may be within the range of 0° to 45°.<br>
With this, the absorbent body 23 is not to interfere with the<br>
trim absorbent bodies 133a, 133c much so that it is possible<br>
to suppress the dislocation.<br>
Operation of the cutter 10 when cutting out the absorbent<br>
body 23 from the continuous base material 130 will be described<br><br>
in detail by referring to Fig. 4A to Fig. 4D.<br>
First, the absorbent body 23 is cut out in the shape of<br>
the absorbent body along the cutting plane line 29 by the cutting<br>
blade 65. In this state, the absorbent body 23 is not separated<br>
from the trim absorbent bodies 133a, 133c (Fig. 4A).<br>
Next, the end portion of the absorbent body 23 begins to<br>
be discharged from the cutting mechanism 21. At the same time,<br>
each of the trim absorbent bodies 133a, 133c, which are the<br>
remainder of the continuous base material after the absorbent<br>
body 23 is cut out, are brought out in the directions of the<br>
arrows 138a, 138c respectively. The force for pulling out each<br>
of the trim absorbent bodies 133a, 133c works on the end portion<br>
of the absorbent body 23, so that a crack 32 occurs in the bottom<br>
tip of the end portion of the absorbent body 23 (Fig. 4B).<br>
The crack 32 expands along the cutting plane line 29 and<br>
the absorbent body 23 begins to be separated (Fig. 4C and Fig.<br>
4D) . As a result, the absorbent body 23 is completely separated<br>
from the continuous base material 130.<br>
The embodiment, as shown in Fig. 5, adopts a cut pattern<br>
formed from the absorbent bodies 23 on the continuous base<br>
material 130 at predetermined intervals. Here, a cutting plane<br>
line 30 is formed between the adjacent ends of the absorbent<br>
bodies 23.<br>
Thereby, the base material remainder 131 can be divided<br>
easily into the trim absorbent bodies 133a, 133c. Also, the<br>
cutting plane line forming the end portion and the cutting planes<br>
line forming the other end portion of the absorbent bodies 23<br><br>
do not cross each other. Thus, the amount of scraps generated,<br>
when the absorbent bodies 23 is cut out, can be decreased.<br>
With the embodiment, following effects can be expected.<br>
The cutter 10 is formed includes the cutting mechanism 21,<br>
the transporting conveyer 22, and the base material remainder<br>
discharging mechanism 24. Thereby, the cutter 10 divides the<br>
base material remainder 131, which is the remainder of the<br>
continuous base material 130 after the absorbent body 23 is cut<br>
out, into two for forming the two trim absorbent bodies 133a,<br>
133c, and separates the trim absorbent bodies 133a, 133c from<br>
each other. Therefore, the trim absorbent bodies 133a, 133c<br>
do not interfere with the end of the absorbent body 23. As a<br>
result, the absorbent bodies 23 are smoothly brought out by the<br>
transporting conveyer 22 from the two rollers 64 and 66. Thus,<br>
the dislocations of the absorbent bodies 23 can be prevented<br>
Since a sponge is provided in the inner side of the cutting<br>
blade 65 of the cutting roller 64, rebound elasticity of the<br>
sponge works when the cutting roller 64 is pressed against the<br>
continuous base material 130. Thus, the pressing force of the<br>
cutting blade 65 against the continuous base material 130 can<br>
be made uniform and the absorbent bodies 23 can be smoothly cut<br>
out.<br>
Also, with the interlabial pad producing apparatus 1, the<br>
absorbent bodies 23 for forming the interlabial pads can be stably<br>
produced from the continuous base material 130.<br>
Second Embodiment<br>
Fig. 6 shows the cut pattern of a cutter according to the<br><br>
secorid embodiment of the present invention. The embodiment<br>
differs from the first embodiment in respect of the cut pattern<br>
formed from the absorbent bodies 23 continuously on the<br>
continuous base material 130.<br>
With the embodiment, the amount of the trim taken up in<br>
trim absorbent bodies 134a, 134c can be decreased.<br>
Comparison Example<br>
Fig. 7 shows a cutter 10B according to a comparison example<br>
of the present invention.<br>
In the comparison example, the structure of a base material<br>
remainder discharging mechanism 24B is different from that of<br>
the first embodiment.<br>
Specifically, in the comparison example, the base material<br>
remainder discharging mechanism 24B does not divide a base<br>
material remainder 131B into two but sucks it to the direction<br>
of an arrow 139 shown in Fig. 7, that is, in the orthogonal<br>
direction to the discharging direction of the absorbent bodies<br>
23.<br>
Operation of the cutter 10B for cutting out the absorbent<br>
body 23 of the continuous base material 130 will be described<br>
in detail by referring to Fig. 8A to Fig. 8D.<br>
First, the continuous base material 130 is cut out along<br>
the cutting plane line 29 by the cutting blade 65 in the shape<br>
of the absorbent body 23 (Fig. 8A).<br>
Next, the end portion of the absorbent body 23 begins to<br>
be discharged from the cutting mechanism 21. At the same time,<br>
the base material remainder 131B, which is the remainder of the<br><br>
continuous base material 130 after the absorbent body 23 is cut<br>
out, is brought out in the direction of the arrow 139. The force<br>
for pulling out each of the base material remainder 131B works<br>
on the top tip end portion of the absorbent body 23, so that<br>
a crack 32 occurs in the bottom tip of the end portion of the<br>
absorbent body 23 (Fig. 8B).<br>
The crack 32 is to expand along the cutting plane line 29.<br>
However, the end portion of the absorbent body 23 interferes<br>
with the end edge of the base material remainder 131B. Thus,<br>
the end portion of the absorbent body 23 clings to the end edge<br>
of the base material remainder 131B so as to be brought toward<br>
the direction of the arrow 139 together with the base material<br>
remainder 131B (Fig. 8C and Fig. 8D) . As a result, the absorbent<br>
body 23 cannot be completely separated from the continuous base<br>
material 130.<br>
Third Embodiment<br>
Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 show a cutter 10C according to the third<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The embodiment differs from the first embodiment in respect<br>
that it includes an embossing device 41 and a slit forming device<br>
51.<br>
The cutter 10C includes the cutting mechanism 21, the<br>
transporting conveyer 22, and the base material remainder<br>
discharging mechanism 24. The cutter 10C further includes the<br>
embossing device 41 and the slit forming device 51 as a cutting<br>
plane line forming means. The embossing device 41 is provided<br>
along the line X-X' shown in Fig. 10, the slit forming device<br><br>
51 is provided along the line Y-Y' shown in Fig. 10, and the<br>
cutting mechanism 21 is provided along the line Z-Z' .<br>
In the embodiment, the continuous base material 130 is fed<br>
by the sheet fabric supplier 31. The sheet fabric supplier 31<br>
is for forming the continuous base material 130 and includes<br>
a spool 38 on which a sheet fabric 37 for the absorbent body<br>
is wound, a roller 36, and an opening/laminating device 34 for<br>
supplying the absorbent material.<br>
The embossing device 41 is for embossing the continuous<br>
base material 130 and includes an embossing roller 42 having<br>
protruded parts for forming dented embossed parts 136 on the<br>
continuous base material 130, as well as an embossing backing<br>
roller 48 having a smooth surface.<br>
The slit forming device 51 includes a slit roller 52 having<br>
a blade and a backing roller 54 having a smooth surface. The<br>
slit forming device 51 forms slits as perforation cutting plane<br>
lines in the substantially center along the continuing direction<br>
of the continuous base material 130 by pressing the slit roller<br>
52 thereto. Moreover, thepresent inventionprovides, thecutting<br>
device mechanism 21, comprises by means for conveying and means<br>
for cutting, and the slit forming device 51 and the base material<br>
remainder discharging mechanism 24 comprises dividing means in<br>
the claims.<br>
The sheet fabric 37 used for the absorbent body is fed to<br>
the opening/laminating device 34 through the spool 38 and the<br>
roller 36. The absorbent material is supplied from a supply<br>
port 33 of the opening/laminating device 34 on top of the sheet<br><br>
fabric 37. The absorbent material is opened and the coating<br>
material is laminated, so that the continuous base material 130<br>
is formed.<br>
Then, the continuous base material 130 is embossed by the<br>
embossing device 41.<br>
Subsequently, the continuous base material 130 is supplied<br>
in between the slit roller 52 and the backing roller 54, and<br>
a perforation slit 39d is formed thereon in substantially the<br>
center of width direction in the continuing direction of the<br>
continuous base material 130.<br>
Then, absorbent bodies 23C are cut out from the continuous<br>
base material 130 by the cutter 10 and the absorbent bodies 23C<br>
are discharged as they are. At the same time, the base material<br>
remainder 131 is pulled by the base material remainder<br>
discharging mechanism 24 in the directions of the arrow 138a,<br>
138c. Thus, the base material remainder 131 is torn along the<br>
slit 39d to be divided into the trim absorbent bodies 133a, 133c<br>
and pulled out.<br>
With the embodiment, the perforation slit 39d is formed<br>
in substantially the center of the continuous base material 130<br>
in the continuing direction. Thus, the interlabial pad can be<br>
folded along the slit 39d as to improve the fitness to the inner<br>
wall of the labium.<br>
Further, embossing can improve the tensile strength of each<br>
of the trim absorbent bodies 133a, 133c. Therefore, each of<br>
the trim absorbent bodies 133a, 133c can be surely pulled out<br>
by the suction device.<br><br>
In consideration of suppressing the deformation of the<br>
interlabial pad when worn and maintaining the softness, the<br>
embossing rate of the absorbent body 23C per area is preferable<br>
to be within the range of 0.5 to 10 % and more preferable to<br>
be 1.0 to 5.0 %. In consideration of suppressing the breakage<br>
of the trim absorbent bodies 133a, 133c, the embossing rate of<br>
the trim absorbent bodies 133a, 133c per area is preferable to<br>
be 15 % or more and more preferable to be 40 % or more.<br>
Fourth Embodiment<br>
Fig. 11 shows a cutter 10D according to the fourth embodiment<br>
of the present invention.<br>
The embodiment differs from the third embodiment in the<br>
respect that it does not include an embossing device. Also,<br>
the embodiment differs in respect of the structure of a base<br>
material remainder discharging mechanism 24D.<br>
Specifically, after absorbent bodies 23D are cut out by<br>
the cutting mechanism 21, the absorbent bodies 23D and the base<br>
material remainder 131D are discharged by the transporting<br>
conveyer22. Then, on the roller 137, thebasematerial remainder<br>
131D is pulled in the directions of the arrows 138a, 138c to<br>
be divided into two trim absorbent bodies 133a, 133c and pulled<br>
out.<br>
In the embodiment, the absorbent bodies 23D are discharged<br>
along the continuing direction of the continuous base material<br>
130 after the absorbent bodies 23D are cut out, so that<br>
dislocations can be further suppressed.<br>
Fifth Embodiment<br><br>
Fig. 12 shows a continuous base material 130E which is<br>
processed by a cutter according to a fifth embodiment of the<br>
present invention.<br>
The embodiment differs from the fourth embodiment in respect<br>
to the embossing rate of the continuous base material 130E.<br>
Specifically, embossing rate of side portions 130a, 130c<br>
of the continuous base material 130E is higher than that of the<br>
center portion 130b, and the embossed portion 136 is uniformly<br>
formed along the continuing direction of the continuous base<br>
material 130E. Therefore, the embossing rate of the trim<br>
absorbent body becomes higher than that of the absorbent body<br>
23E.<br>
Thereby, the strength of the trim absorbent body can be<br>
improved, so that it enables to prevent the breakage of the trim<br>
absorbent body when the trim absorbent body is being pulled.<br>
Also, even though plural numbers of sheets are laminated<br>
to form the continuous base material 130E, the plural numbers<br>
of sheets are unified by embossment. Thus, the trim absorbent<br>
body can be surely pulled out.<br>
Examples of the absorbent body 23E may be rayon, acetate,<br>
natural cotton, super absorbent polymer fiber, synthetic fiber,<br>
pulp, chemical pulp, and mixtures of them. In consideration<br>
of softness of the absorbent body, the absorbent body is<br>
preferable to be an aggregate of fibers which mainly contains<br>
rayon with the fiber length of 10 to 51 mm. In this case, the<br>
pitch of the embossment in the embossed portion 136 is preferable<br>
to be within the range of 1 to 9 mm.<br><br>
Sixth Embodiment<br>
Fig. 13 shows a cutter 10F according to a sixth embodiment<br>
of the present invention.<br>
The embodiment differs from the fourth embodiment in respect<br>
of the structure of a base material remainder discharging<br>
mechanism 24F.<br>
Specifically, a base material remainder 131F is pulled in<br>
the directions of 135a, 135c on the roller 137 so as to be divided<br>
into two trim absorbent bodies 133a, 133c and pulled out. The<br>
directions of the arrows 135a, 135c are substantially the same<br>
directions as the discharging direction of the absorbent bodies<br>
23 viewed from the width directions of the absorbent body 23D,<br>
that is, in the horizontally expanding directions.<br>
In the embodiment, the absorbent bodies 23D are not pulled<br>
in the thickness direction, so that dislocations of the absorbent<br>
bodies 23D can be more surely suppressed.<br>
The present invention is not limited to the above-described<br>
embodiments but it includes various modifications and<br>
improvements which achieve the object of the invention.<br>
For example, in the production lines of the interlabial<br>
pad producing apparatus 1, for example, the speed of the line<br>
may be set to be about 20 to 200 m/min. And the production rate<br>
of the absorbent bodies may be set to be about 200 to 2000 pieces<br>
per minute.<br>
Further, in the first embodiment, the tensile strength of<br>
the side portions 130a, 130c of the continuous base material<br>
130 in the continuing direction, from which the trim absorbent<br><br>
bodies 133a and 133c are formed, may be set larger than that<br>
of the center portion 130b from which the absorbent bodies 23<br>
are formed. With this, rigidity of the trim absorbent body can<br>
be increased while the softness of the absorbent bodies 23 is<br>
maintained. Also, the trim absorbent bodies 133a, 133c enable<br>
to prevent breakage when pulled out.<br>
According to the cutter, cutting method, an apparatus for<br>
producing the interlabial pad, and a method for producing the<br>
same, the member and the base material remainder can be surely<br>
separated. Thus, the dislocations of the cut-out members can<br>
be prevented.<br><br>
