				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to metallocene compounds useful as olefin polymerization catalysts or catalyst components, and to olefin polymerization processes with an olefin polymerization catalyst containing the metallocene compound.  In detail, the invention relates to olefin polymerization catalysts that can catalyze with high polymerization activity the production of olefin polymers having high melt tension, excellent mechanical strength and good particle properties, and relates to olefin polymerization processes using the catalysts.  Further, the invention relates to ethylene polymers obtained by the polymerization processes that have good processability and particularly excellent mechanical strength compared to conventional ethylene polymers, and relates to thermoplastic resin compositions containing the ethylene polymers.  In more detail, the invention is concerned with shaped articles ical strength compaor films that are obtained from the ethylene polymers or the thermoplastic resin compositions containing the ethylene polymers, or relates to laminate films including the films.  Furthermore, the invention is concerned with ethylene polymers that have good processability and easy-opening properties compared to conventional ethylene polymers, and thermoplastic resin<br>
compositions containing the ethylene polymers .  In more detail, the invention is concerned with shaped articles or films that are obtained from the ethylene polymers or the thermoplastic resin compositions containing the ethylene polymers, or relates to laminate films including the films.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]<br>
Olefin polymers are shaped by various methods and used in wide-ranged applications.  For example, ethylene polymers are extruded into films or sheets for use in the packaging of foods, liquids or daily sundries.  Olefin polymers require various properties depending on the shaping methods or use applications.  In the case of T-die extrusion as an example, they require performances such as stable processability even at high speed (high-speed film-forming properties) and small neck-in.<br>
[0003]<br>
Low density polyethylenes (LDPE) by high-pressure radical polymerization have a high melt tension because of their complicated long-chain branched structures, and show good shaping processability such as small neck-in, thereby finding various uses.  However, shaped articles therefrom still have low mechanical strength properties such as tensile strength,<br>
tear strength and impact resistant strength.  Further, these polymers show poor high-speed film-forming properties in T-die extrusion. [0004]<br>
In contrast to LDPE, Ziegler-catalyzed or metallocene-catalyzed ethylene polymers possess high tensile strength, tear strength and impact resistant strength due to their molecular structures, and they are used in applications requiring mechanical strength. However, these polymers have a low melt tension and consequent poor shaping processability. [0005]<br>
To solve these problems, [1] LDPE is blended with a Ziegler-catalyzed or metallocene-catalyzed ethylene polymer (Patent Document 1); [2] the molecular weight distribution is broadened by multistage polymerization (Patent Document 2); [3] a long-chain branched ethylene polymer is produced with a chromium catalyst; [4] a long-chain branched ethylene polymer is produced with a specific metallocene catalyst (Patent Document 3) ; [5] macro monomers are copolymerized with use of a specific metallocene catalyst to give a long-chain branched ethylene polymer (Patent Document 4) ; or [6] ethylene and diene are copolymerized with use of a specific metallocene catalyst to afford a long-chain branched ethylene polymer (Patent Documents 6 and 7).  However, the method [1] greatly increases<br>
costs in the blending of the polymers, and the ethylene polymers obtained by the methods [2], [3], [4] and [5] have a small number of long-chain branches and do not have a sufficient melt tension or shaping processability.  Further, the method [6] can deteriorate mechanical characteristics inherent to polymers or can result in gelation when the diene is used in large amounts. [0006]<br>
Patent Documents 8 and 9 teach the use of two or more kinds of metallocene compounds or organometallic complexes in order to produce more long-chain branches or to increase the melt tension. However, the number of long-chain branches is still insufficient and problems remain in terms of shaping processability. Further, the catalytic activity is far below the industrial level. [0007]<br>
As discussed above, it has been difficult to produce resins having high melt tension and excellent mechanical strength inexpensively and efficiently by means of the conventional catalyst systems or by blending resins.  In other words, the development of efficient production processes for ethylene polymers having high melt tension and excellent mechanical strength is important and highly valuable in the industrial production.<br>
[0008]<br>
When ethylene polymers are used as sealants in packaging materials, the polymers require mechanical strength such as heat seal strength or pack breakage strength to protect the contents. However, packaging materials that are easily opened (have easy openability) attract attention out of consideration for elderly people, infants and disabled people. One of the approaches for easy openability is to appropriately weaken the heat seal strength at the sealed portion. Accordingly, there is a need for ethylene polymers having appropriately low heat seal strength. [0009]<br>
The present inventors studied diligently in view of the problems in the art as describe above. They have then found that a single or plural kinds of bridged metallocene compounds having differing cyclopentadienyl-derived groups can afford macromonomers that are a source of long-chain branches and can simultaneously catalyze the repolymerization of the macromonomers into olefin polymers having a large number of long-chain branches, small neck-in in the T-die extrusion, small take-up surge and superior mechanical strength or olefin polymers having small neck-in in the T-die extrusion, small take-up surge and easy opening properties. Such compounds as olefin polymerization catalysts and polymerization processes using the compounds have been found to be capable of efficiently producing the olefin polymers as described above. The present invention has been completed based on the findings.<br>

Of the organometallic compounds (c-1) represented by Formulae [11], [12] and [13], those having Formula [11] are preferable.  Specific examples thereof include trialkylaluminums such as trimethylaluminum, triethylaluminum, triisopropylaluminum, triisobutylaluminum, trihexylaluminum,<br>

Examples of the compounds (c-3) capable of reacting with the component (A) to form an ion pair include Lewis acids, ionic compounds, borane compounds and carborane compounds as described in JP-A-H01-501950, JP-A-H01-502036, JP-A-H03-179005, JP-A-H03-179006, JP-A-H03-207703, JP-A-H03-207704, and U.S. Patent No. 5,321,106.  Heteropoly compounds and isopoly compounds may also be employed.  These compounds may be used without limitation. [0139]<br>
When the olefin polymerization catalyst of the invention is used together with an organoaluminum oxy-compound such as methylaluminoxane as a cocatalyst component, the catalyst shows very high polymerization activity for olefin compounds. Further, an organoaluminum oxy-compound reacts with the active hydrogen in the solid carrier, and a solid carrier component containing the cocatalyst component may be prepared easily.<br>
In view of these advantages, it is preferable to use the<br>
organoaluminum oxy-compound (c-2) as component (C) .<br>
[0140]<br>
Solid carriers (S)<br>
The solid carriers (S) will be described next. The solid carriers (S) may be simply referred to as the components (S) . [0141]<br>
The solid carrier (S) optionally used in the invention is an inorganic or organic compound in the form of granular or fine particulate solid.  The components described hereinabove are supported on the solid carrier. [0142]<br>
Examples of the inorganic compounds include porous oxides, inorganic halides, clays, clay minerals and ion-exchange layered compounds.  Preferably, porous oxides or inorganic halides described below are used. [0143]<br>
Examples of the porous oxides include Si02, AI2O3, MgO, ZrO, Ti02, B203, CaO, ZnO, BaO, Th02, and complexes and mixtures containing these oxides, such as natural or synthetic zeolites, Si02-MgO, Si02-Al203, Si02-Ti02, Si02-V205/ Si02-Cr203 and Si02-Ti02-MgO. Of these, those containing Si02 as the major component are preferable. [0144]<br>
The inorganic oxides may contain small amounts of carbonate, sulfate, nitrate or oxide components such as Na2C03, K2C03, CaC03, MgC03, Na2S04, A12(S04)3, BaS04, KN03, Mg(N03)2, A1(N03)3, Na20, K20 and Li20. [0145]<br>
Although these porous oxides have various properties depending on the type and preparation process thereof, the carrier suitable for use in the invention has a particle<br>
diameter of 0.2 to 300 (am, preferably 1 to 200 fj.m, a specific surface area of 50 to 1200 m2/g, preferably 100 to 1000 m2/g, and a pore volume of 0.3 to 30 cm3/g.  Where necessary, the carrier may be calcined at 100 to 1000°C, and preferably 150 to 700°C before use. [0146]<br>
Examples of the inorganic halides include MgCl2, MgBr2, MnCl2 and MnBr2. The inorganic halides may be used as they are or after pulverized by a ball mill, a vibration mill or the like. Alternatively, the inorganic halides may be dissolved in a solvent such as an alcohol and then precipitated by a precipitating agent to be used in the form of fine particles. [0147]<br>
The clays are generally comprised of a clay mineral as the major component. The ion-exchange layered compounds have a crystal structure in which planes formed by ionic bonding<br>
or the like pile on one another in parallel with a weak bond strength, and they contain exchangeable ions. Most clay minerals are ion-exchange layered compounds. The clays, the clay minerals and the ion-exchange layered compounds are not limited to naturally occurring materials and may be synthetic. [0148]<br>
Examples of such clays, clay minerals and ion-exchange layered compounds include clays, clay minerals, and ion crystalline compounds having such a layered crystal structure as a hexagonal closest packing type, an antimony type, a CdCl2 type or a Cdl2 type. [0149]<br>
Specific examples of the clays and the clay minerals include kaolin, bentonite, kibushi clay, potter's clay, allophane, hisingerite, pyrophyllite, mica group, montmorillonite group, vermiculite, chlorite group, palygorskite, kaolinite, nacrite, dickite and halloysite. Specific examples of the ion-exchange layered compounds include crystalline acid salts of polyvalent metals, such as a-Zr (HAs04)2-H20, a-Zr(HP04)2, a-Zr (KP04) 2 • 3H20, a-Ti (HP04) 2, a-Ti(HAs04)2-H20, a-Sn(HP04)2-H20, Y-Zr(HP04)2, y-Ti(HP04)2 and y-Ti(NH4P04)2-H20. [0150]<br>
The clays, the clay minerals and the ion-exchange layered<br>
compounds preferably have a pore volume, as measured on pores having a radius of not less than 20 A by a mercury penetration method, of 0.1 cc/g or more, particularly from 0.3 to 5 cc/g. The pore volume is measured on the pores having a radius of 20 to 3 x 104 A by a mercury penetration method using a mercury porosimeter. [0151]<br>
When the carrier used has a pore volume of less than 0.1 cc/g as measured on pores having a radius of 20 A or more, it tends to be difficult to obtain high polymerization activity. [0152]<br>
It is preferable that the clays and the clay minerals are chemically treated. Any chemical treatment may be used herein, for example a surface treatment to remove impurities attached to the surface or a treatment to affect the crystal structure of the clay.  Specific examples of such chemical treatments include acid treatment, alkali treatment, salt treatment and organic matter treatment.  The acid treatment removes impurities from the surface and increases the surface area by dissolving cations such as of Al, Fe and Mg from the crystal structure.  The alkali treatment destroys the crystal structure of the clay to bring about change in clay structure. The salt treatment and the organic matter treatment produce an ionic complex, a molecular complex or an organic derivative<br>
to cause change in surface area or interlayer distance. [0153]<br>
The ion-exchange layered compound may be enlarged in interlayer distance by changing the exchangeable ions between layers with other larger and bulkier ions by means of ion exchange properties.  The bulky ions play a pillar-like roll to support the layered structure and are called pillars. Introduction of other substances between layers of a layered compound is called intercalation.  Examples of the guest compounds to be intercalated include cationic inorganic compounds such as TiCl4 and ZrCl4; metal alkoxides such as Ti(OR)4, Zr(OR)4, PO(OR)3 and B(OR)3 (wherein R is a hydrocarbon group or the like); and metal hydroxide ions such as [Al1304(OH)24]7+, [Zr4(OH)14]2+ and [Fe30 (OCOCH3) 6] + .  These compounds may be used singly or in combination of two or more kinds.  Intercalation of these compounds can be carried out in the presence of polymers obtained by hydrolysis of metal alkoxides such as Si(OR)4, Al(OR)3 and Ge(OR)4 (wherein R is a hydrocarbon group or the like) or in the presence of colloidal inorganic compounds such as Si02.  Examples of the pillars include oxides resulting from thermal dehydration of the above-mentioned metal hydroxide ions intercalated between layers. [0154]<br>
The clays, the clay minerals and the ion-exchange layered compounds mentioned above may be used as they are or after treated by, for example, ball milling or sieving.  They may be used after subjected to water adsorption or thermal dehydration. The clays, the clay minerals and the ion-exchange layered compounds may be used singly or in combination of two or more kinds. [0155]<br>
The organic compound is, for example, a granular or fine particulate solid ranging in particle diameter from 10 to 300<br>
fim.  Specific examples thereof include (co)polymers mainly composed of a C2-14 olefin such as ethylene, propylene, 1-butene or 4-methyl-l-pentene, (co)polymers or reaction products formed mainly of vinylcyclohexane, styrene or divinylbenzene, and modified products of these compounds. [0156]<br>
The olefin polymerization catalysts of the invention contain the bridged metallocene compound (A), at least one compound (C) selected from the organometallic compounds (c-1) of Formulae [11], [12] and [13], the organoaluminum oxy-compounds (c-2) and the ionized ionic compounds (c-3), and optionally the components (S) as required. [0157]<br>
In carrying out the polymerization, the components may<br>
be used and added by any method or in any order.  Some exemplary<br>
processes are given below:<br>
[0158]<br>
(1)	The component (A) alone is added to a polymerizer. [0159]<br>
(2)	The component (A) and the component (C) are added to a polymerizer in an arbitrary order.<br>
[0160]<br>
(3)	A catalyst component in which the component (A) is<br>
supported on the component (S) , and the component (C) are added<br>
to a polymerizer in an arbitrary order.<br>
[0161]<br>
(4)	A catalyst component in which the component (C) is<br>
supported on the component (S) , and the component (A) are added<br>
to a polymerizer in an arbitrary order.<br>
[0162]<br>
(5)	A catalyst component in which the components (A) and<br>
(C) are supported on the component (S) is added to a polymerizer.<br>
[0163]<br>
In the processes (2) to (5) ,  at least two of the catalyst components may be contacted with each other beforehand. [0164]<br>
In the processes (4) and (5) in which the component (C) is supported on the carrier, other unsupported component (C)<br>
may be added at an arbitrary stage as required.  In this case, these components (C) may be the same or different from each other. [0165]<br>
The solid catalyst component wherein the component (A) alone or the components (A) and (C) are supported on the component (S) may be prepolymerized with an olefin.  Further, an additional catalyst component may be supported on the prepolymerized solid catalyst component. [0166]<br>
In general, when a metallocene compound having substituent groups on both the cyclopentadienyl rings forms an ion pair with the component (C), the resultant olefin polymerization catalyst gives with high catalytic activity polymers having high molecular weight and less terminal double bonds. [0167]<br>
The mechanism of this catalytic action is probably explained as follows. A number of substituent groups on the cyclopentadienyl rings produce steric hindrance which causes an appropriate distance between the central metal (cation) and the component (C) (anion) and consequently the acidity of the central metal is increased. As a result, the coordination and insertion of monomers are facilitated but at the same time the<br>
steric hindrance by the substituent groups inhibits chain transfer reactions which control the molecular weight such as a chain transfer reaction of monomers or a transfer of hydrogen at the p-position of the polymer chain to the central metal. [0168]<br>
In contrast, the olefin polymerization catalysts (a) containing the bridged metallocene compound of Formula [1] have substituent groups on only one cyclopentadienyl ring.  As a result, an appropriate distance is ensured between the central metal and the component (C) while ensuring an appropriate space to permit chain transfer reactions.  The olefin polymerization catalysts of the present invention can thus achieve high polymerization activity and afford polymers having a low molecular weight and many double bonds at terminals.

Preferred groups indicated by Q2 include alkylene groups, substituted alkylene groups, alkylidene groups, halogen-containing alkylene groups, halogen-containing substituted alkylene groups and halogen-containing alkylidene groups each having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, and silicon-containing groups and halogen-containing silicon-containing groups, with carbon-containing groups and halogen-containing carbon groups being particularly preferable. [0197]<br>
The letter X independently at each occurrence is a group selected from a hydrogen atom, halogen atoms, hydrocarbon groups, halogen-containing hydrocarbon groups, silicon-containing groups, oxygen-containing groups, sulfur-containing groups, nitrogen-containing groups and phosphorus-containing groups.  Of these, halogen atoms and hydrocarbon groups are preferable.  Examples of the halogen atoms include fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine. Examples of the hydrocarbon groups, the halogen-containing hydrocarbon groups, the silicon-containing groups, the oxygen-containing groups, the sulfur-containing groups, the nitrogen-containing groups and the phosphorus-containing groups are as described above. [0198]<br>
The hydrogen atom, the hydrocarbon groups, the<br>
halogen-containing groups, the oxygen-containing groups, the nitrogen-containing groups, the boron-containing groups, the sulfur-containing groups, the phosphorus-containing groups, the silicon-containing groups, the germanium-containing groups and the tin-containing groups indicated by R17 to R20, and R21 to R28 may be similar to those represented by R1 to R4 in Formula [1] without limitation.  The atoms and the groups indicated by X may be similar to those represented by X in Formula [1] without limitation.  In an embodiment, at least one pair of neighboring groups among R17 to R20 on the cyclopentadienyl ring may be linked together to form a ring, and consequently a ring structure such as an indenyl group, a substituted indenyl group, a f luorenyl group or a substituted fluorenyl group may be formed.  In another embodiment, at least one pair of neighboring groups among R21 to R28 on the f luorenyl ring may be linked together to form a ring, and consequently a ring structure such as a benzofluorenyl group, a dibenzofluorenyl group, an octahydrodibenzofluorenyl group or an octamethyloctahydrodibenzofluorenyl group may be formed. [0199]<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the above substituent groups, R17 to R20 are hydrogen atoms, R21 to R28 are selected from the hydrogen atom and the hydrocarbon groups, and at least one pair of neighboring hydrocarbon groups may be linked together to<br>
form an octahydrodibenzofluorenyl group or an octamethyloctahydrodibenzofluorenyl group.  In a preferred embodiment, Q2 is selected from the alkylene groups, substituted alkylene groups and alkylidene groups having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, and silicon-containing groups.  When the bridged metallocene compound has these substituent groups and the bridging group, the obtainable catalyst relatively prevents an increase in molecular weight and permits reducing the amount of hydrogen required for molecular weight control, whereby it is expected that the component (A) affords an increased amount of macromonomers and the number of long-chain branches is increased.

Of the organometallic compounds (c-1) represented by Formulae [18], [19] and [20], those having Formula [18] are preferable.  Specific examples of such compounds include trialkylaluminums such as trimethylaluminum, triethylaluminum, triisopropylaluminum, triisobutylaluminum, trihexylaluminum, trioctylaluminum and tri-2-ethylhexylaluminum; dialkylaluminum halides such as dimethylaluminum chloride, diethylaluminum chloride, diisopropylaluminum chloride, diisobutylaluminum chloride and dimethylaluminum bromide; alkylaluminum sesquihalides such as methylaluminum sesquichloride, ethylaluminum sesquichloride, isopropylaluminum sesquichloride, butylaluminum sesquichloride and ethylaluminum sesquibromide; alkylaluminum<br>

When a plurality of the components (C) are used, the components (C) may be the same or different from one another. Of these contact sequences, the sequences xv), xvi), xvii), xxii) , xxiii) and xxiv) are preferable, and the sequences xvii) and xxii) are more preferable. [0221]<br>
In the exemplary contact sequences described above, the step (PI) which includes contacting the components (S) and (C) , the step (P2) which includes contacting the components (S) and (A), the step (P3) which includes contacting the components (S) and (B), and the step which includes contacting the components (S), (A) and (B) may be performed in the presence of at least one component (G) selected from polyalkylene oxide blocks (g-1), higher aliphatic amides (g-2), polyalkylene oxides (g-3), polyalkylene oxide alkyl ethers (g-4), alkyl diethanol amines (g-5) and polyoxyalkylene alkylamines (g-6). The presence of the components (G) inhibits the fouling during the polymerization and improves particle properties of the obtainable polymers.  Of the components (G), (g-1), (g-2), (g-3) and (g-4) are preferable, and (g-1) and (g-2) are particularly preferable. [0222]<br>
The solvents used in the preparation of the solid catalyst components include inert hydrocarbon solvents, and in detail aliphatic hydrocarbons such as propane, butane, pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, decane, dodecane and kerosine; alicyclic hydrocarbons such as cyclopentane, cyclohexane and methylcyclopentane; aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene and xylene; halogenated hydrocarbons such as ethylene chloride, chlorobenzene and dichloromethane; and mixtures of these hydrocarbons. [0223]<br>
When the component (C) and the component (S) are brought into contact together, the reaction site in the component (C) and the reaction site in the component (S) react with each other to form a chemical bond, resulting in a contact product between the component (C) and the component (S). The time of contact of the component (C) and the component (S) is usually in the range of 0 to 20 hours, and preferably 0 to 10 hours . The contact temperature is usually in the range of -50 to 200°C, and preferably -20 to 120°C. If the initial contact between the components (C) and (S) takes place precipitously, the reaction heat or reaction energy breaks the component (S) to cause a deteriorated morphology of the obtainable solid catalyst component. The use of such component in polymerization will result in difficult continuous operation due to bad morphology<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
