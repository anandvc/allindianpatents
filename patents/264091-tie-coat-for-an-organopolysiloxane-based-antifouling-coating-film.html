				<td>The present invention relates to a tie coat for an organopolysiloxane based antifouling coating film.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a tie coat for an organopolysiloxane-based antifouling coating film, a composite coating film, and a ship and an underwater structure coated with the coating film.<br>
More particularly, the invention relates to a tie coat (bonding film, primer coat) which is formed on a surface of a base, an undercoating film or the like (these are also referred together to as "base or the like") prior to formation of an organopolysiloxane-based antifouling coating film substantially containing no antifouling agent and being a small burden to the environment, and which exhibits excellent adhesion to the base present below the lower surface of the tie coat and excellent adhesion to the organopolysiloxane-based antifouling coating film present on the upper surface of the tie coat. The invention also relates to a composite<br>
coating film which is constituted of two or more films (layers) formed on a base surface, has an outermost layer (surface layer) comprising the organopolysiloxane-based antifouling coating film and is a small burden to the environment.<br>
Further, the present invention relates to an organopolysiloxane-based antifouling composite coating film which is a new-old composite coating film formed by coating an old antifouling coating film (former antifouling coating film) for repair painting or repainting, can be increased in film thickness and has excellent bond property between the old coating film and the new antifouling coating film formed on a surface of the old coating film and excellent antifouling property, and also relates to a ship and an underwater structure coated with the coating film.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Bottoms of ships, underwater structures, fishing nets, etc. are exposed to water for a long period of time, so that various aquatic organisms, e.g., animals such as oysters, mussels and barnacles, plants such as laver, and bacteria, are liable to adhere to their surfaces and propagate thereon. On that account, appearances of the<br>
hip bottoms, underwater structures, etc. are deteriorated, and functions thereof are often impaired.<br>
If such aquatic organisms adhere to a ship bottom or propagate thereon, surface roughness of the whole ship is increased to sometimes induce lowering of ship velocity and increase of fuel consumption. Further, if bacteria, slime (sludge substances) or larger organisms adhere to an underwater structure, the structure is corroded or an anticorrosion coating film is damaged, so that there is a fear that strength and functions of the underwater structure are lowered to thereby markedly shorten the lifetime. Therefore, it is necessary to remove such aquatic organisms from the bottom ship or the like. However, such removal work needs much labor and much time.<br>
In order to prevent the above damages, ship bottoms and underwater structures are coated with various antifouling paints. Above all, coating films formed from antifouling paints containing polymerizable unsaturated carboxylic acid silyl ester constituent unit-containing copolymers are frequently used because they exhibit excellent antifouling performance for a long period of time.<br>
Examples of antifouling paints proposed by the present applicant so far include a silyl ester copolymer-<br>
based antifouling paint of hydrolyzable type and a crosslinking metal salt copolymer-based antifouling paint of hydrolyzable type.<br>
The silyl ester copolymer-based antifouling paint of hydrolyzable type substantially contains no antifouling agent and has such effects that when the antifouling paint is applied to a base surface and cured, a coating film having smaller surface free energy (surface tension) and being a smaller burden to the environment than a coating film composed of a conventional antifouling paint other than those mentioned above can be formed and this film can exhibit antifouling performance.  In the antifouling coating film, however, there is yet room for improvement in bond property (adhesion) to a base, an undercoating film or the like.<br>
By the way, if an antifouling paint is used over a long period of time, it is gradually wasted or damaged and its coating film becomes old and peels off, so that in order to maintain antifouling performance, repair painting or repainting of the coating film needs to be performed periodically.<br>
If removal of the old coating film present on the base surface is carried out prior to the repair painting or the repainting, extra labor and cost are taken.  From<br>
the viewpoints of economical advantage and working efficiency, therefore, it is desirable to apply a fresh paint directly onto the old coating film surface for repairing.  In the case where a fresh paint is overlaid on the old coating film as above, bonding between the paint newly used and the old coating film becomes a problem. In recent years, moreover, further care to the environment and further reduction of a burden to the environment are cried for. Especially when the old coating film to be repaired is the polymerizable unsaturated carboxylic acid silyl ester-based antifouling coating film, this film sometimes becomes a spongy skeleton layer, and in this case, even if an attempt to newly apply an organopolysiloxane-based antifouling paint capable of reducing a burden to the environment directly onto such an old coating film is made, there resides a problem that the resulting coating film composed of the antifouling paint does not exhibit sufficient bond property because of small surface energy.<br>
In order to solve such various problems as mentioned above, the present inventors have earnestly studied, and as a result, they have found that if a coating film composed of a moisture-curing composition comprising (bl) specific organopolysiloxane and/or (b2) a curing<br>
composition obtained by subjecting this organopolysiloxane and a specific extender pigment to specific treatment is formed as a tie coat prior to formation of an organopolysiloxane-based antifouling coating film as an outermost layer, the tie coat exhibits excellent bonding to a base or an undercoating film and also exhibits excellent bonding (adhesion) to the organopolysiloxane-based antifouling coating film as an outermost layer provided on the tie coat surface. Based on the finding, the present invention has been accomplished.<br>
The present inventors have also found that in case of repair painting, a composite coating film, which is obtained by forming a specific sealer and a specific tie coat in this order on a surface of a base or a base with a coating film to be repaired and then laminating a specific organopolysiloxane-based finish coat as an outermost layer on the tie coat, exhibits very excellent adhesion not only to the old polymerizable unsaturated carboxylic acid silyl ester-based antifouling coating film (former antifouling coating film) but also to an old antifouling coating film composed of an antifouling paint containing a non-crosslinking or crosslinking copolymer having a (meth)acrylic acid metal salt unit and to an old<br>
antifouling coating film composed of an organopolysiloxane-based antifouling paint. Moreover, this composite coating film can be increased in film thickness and exhibits excellent antifouling property. Based on the finding, the present invention has been accomplished.<br>
Some examples of composite coating films having a silicone rubber-based or resin-based antifouling coating film (layer) and processes for producing them, which have been proposed so far, are given below.<br>
(1) In U.S. Patent No. 6,013,754 (patent document 1), there are disclosed a primer paint composition which is a paint composition applied to a base and accelerates bonding of a room temperature-curable silicone rubber-based fouling-release coating to a base and a process wherein in order to accelerate bonding of the room temperature-curable (RTV) silicone rubber-based fouling-release coating to the base, the base is subjected to primer treatment in the following manner before the base is exposed to the fouling environment.<br>
That is to say, it is disclosed to carry out, before the base is exposed to the fouling environment, a primer treatment comprising:<br>
a step of coating the base with a paint composition containing, as essential components:<br>
room temperature-curable polysiloxane selected from specific polyhydroorganopolysiloxane and specific polydiorganopolysiloxane,<br>
a compound capable of undergoing condensation reaction, which is selected from silanol, silane, organic acid, alcohol and hydroxyl-terminal siloxane capable of accelerating condensation reaction at room temperature in the absence of an organic metal catalyst, and<br>

The ship or the underwater structure according to the present invention is formed by the use of the above-mentioned tie coat or coated with any one of the above-mentioned organopolysiloxane-based antifouling composite coating films.<br>
EFFECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the present invention, a specific tie coat (bonding film, primer coat) is formed on a surface<br>
of a base or an undercoating film prior to formation of an organopolysiloxane-based antifouling coating film which substantially contains no antifouling agent and is a small burden to the environment, on the surface of the base or the like. Therefore, the base or the undercoating layer such as a primary rust-preventive coating film which is present below the lower surface of the tie coat and the organopolysiloxane-based antifouling coating film which contains no antifouling agent, is a small burden to the environment and becomes an outermost layer (finish coat) can be firmly bonded. Moreover, because the tie coat itself has a certain thickness and is formed from an organopolysiloxane-based paint that is a small burden to the environment, a composite coating film having a large thickness and antifouling property can be readily formed by providing a finish coat on the tie coat surface.<br>
In the present invention, especially when the component (b2) is a curing composition obtained by subjecting the organopolysiloxane (bl) having condensing functional group at both ends of a molecule and the extender pigment such as silica to contact treatment with heating (e.g., not lower than 100°C and lower than decomposition temperatures of the compounding components),<br>
the tie coat exhibits excellent bond property and tends to have (i) excellent anti-sagging property and preferred film thickness-increasing property (excellent film thickness) . When the component (b2) is a curing composition obtained by subjecting the organopolysiloxane (bl) and the extender pigment such as silica to contact treatment without heating (at about room temperature), the tie coat exhibits excellent bond property and tends to have (ii) excellent coating workability and excellent film thickness uniformity.<br>
According to the present invention, further, because the tie coat and an organopolysiloxane-based antifouling coating film (finish coat) are laminated in this order on a surface of a base or an undercoating film to form a composite coating film, the base or the undercoating film (layer) and the finish coat can be firmly bonded with the tie coat, and the antifouling coating film (layer) on the surface exhibits excellent fouling-release property. Moreover, because any film (layer) does not substantially contain an antifouling agent, the organopolysiloxane-based antifouling composite coating film is a small burden to the environment.<br>
The third organopolysiloxane-based antifouling composite coating film (also referred to as a "third<br>
composite coating film") is a new-old composite coating film formed by coating an old antifouling coating film (former antifouling coating film) for repair painting or repainting, and this composite coating film can be increased in film thickness by selecting a new antifouling coating film, exhibits excellent bond strength between the old coating film and the new antifouling coating film and has excellent antifouling property.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION The tie coat for an organopolysiloxane-based antifouling coating film, the organopolysiloxane-based antifouling composite coating film (also referred to as a "laminated coating film"), and a ship and an underwater structure coated with the coating film are described in detail hereinafter.<br>
The terms "tie coat", "finish coat", "sealer coat", "primer coat" and the like used in the following description mean not only cured coating films (namely, coating films), cured layers of a composite (laminated) coating film or treated layers but also uncured paints (paint compositions) for forming such cured coating films,<br>
Base and undercoating film<br>
First, a base or an undercoating film (layer) that is a material to be provided with the tie coat (B) of the invention is described.<br>
The tie coat (B) is provided on a surface of a base or an undercoating film (layer), and examples of the bases include outer surfaces of ships, such as passenger boats, cargo boats and tankers, which are made from materials of steel plates, aluminum plates, etc.; and steel structures other than ships, such as water supply/drainage channels of atomic power plants, towers, bridges, oil field drilling plants, other various plants and marine structures of submarine observatories. The materials of the ships, the marine structures, etc. may be concrete, FRP and wood in addition to the above steel materials.<br>
Examples of the undercoating films include films composed of undercoating paints, such as epoxy-based zinc-rich primers and epoxy-based rust-preventive primers, which are applied onto a surface of the base prior to formation of the tie coat.<br>
In more detail, for forming the undercoating film, coating materials referred to as "zinc-based shop primers" (also referred to as "zinc-based primary rust-<br>
preventive paints" or "zinc-based primary anticorrosion paints) or "epoxy resin-based anticorrosion paints" described in the paragraphs [0018] to [0025] of Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 46957/2001 previously proposed by the present applicant are preferably employed because they have excellent rust prevention property, weldability, bonding property to a base, bonding property to a tie coat formed on the undercoating film surface and the like with a good balance.<br>
The zinc-based shop primer (zinc-based primary rust-preventive paint) may be any of organic type and inorganic type, and the organic zinc-based primary rust-preventive paint is, for example, an epoxy-based zinc primer. As the inorganic zinc-based primary rust-preventive paint, an inorganic zinc primary rust-preventive paint using an inorganic binder such as a silicate-based binder, particularly using a silicate-based binder, is preferably employed.<br>
Especially when the organic zinc-based primary rust-preventive paint is used, a coating film having uniform thickness and excellent anticorrosion property is obtained, and besides, the quantity of a paint to be applied onto the surface of this primary rust-preventive coating film can be saved. When the inorganic zinc-based<br>
primary rust-preventive paint is used, a coating film having excellent weldability, uniform thickness and excellent anticorrosion property is obtained. Of such zinc-based shop primers, the inorganic zinc-based primary rust-preventive paint is particularly preferable.<br>
The epoxy-based zinc primer preferably has a nonvolatile content by volume of 25 to 35% and a zinc concentration by weight (in a coating film) of 50 to 90%. The inorganic zinc-based primary rust-preventive paint is preferably one comprising a silicate-based binder and a zinc powder that is a rust-preventive pigment and having a nonvolatile content by volume of 17 to 27% and a zinc concentration by weight (in a coating film) of 20 to 95%.<br>
If a rust-preventive paint other then the zinc-based shop primers is used as a shop primer in the invention, turning is liable to occur, but when a primer film (layer) composed of the zinc-based shop primer, particularly, the inorganic zinc-based primary rust-preventive paint containing a silicate-based binder, is formed on a surface of a steel material, turning rarely occurs by virtue of anticorrosion effect of zinc even if the primer film (layer) is damaged.<br>
The coating (painting) method with the zinc-based shop primer is not specifically restricted, and a<br>
hitherto known coating method is adoptable. Coating with the zinc-based shop primer is generally carried out after the steel material surface is subjected to shot blasting to remove scales.<br>
The thickness of the undercoating film (layer) obtained by coating with the primer is not specifically restricted.<br>
The undercoating film such as an epoxy-based sealer coat may contain the later-described silane coupling agent.<br>
In the epoxy resin-based anticorrosion paint, an epoxy-based anticorrosion resin as a resin component and an amine-based curing agent (e2) for epoxy resin are generally contained, and in addition, an extender pigment (e3), an anti-sagging agent (e4), etc. may be contained when needed.<br>
Examples of the epoxy-based anticorrosion resins employable in the invention include bisphenol type epoxy resins, glycidyl ester epoxy resins, glycidyl amine epoxy resins, phenolic novolak epoxy resins, cresol epoxy resins, dimeric acid modified epoxy resins, aliphatic epoxy resins, alicyclic epoxy resins and epoxidized oil epoxy resins. Of these, bisphenol type epoxy resins such as those of bisphenol A type and F type are preferable<br>
because the resulting anticorrosion coating film has excellent adhesion to a base and excellent anticorrosion property. The above epoxy resins can be used singly or in combination of two or more kinds.<br>
In the anticorrosion paint composition containing a solvent and the like, the epoxy resin is desirably contained in an amount of usually 10 to 60% by weight, preferably 20 to 50% by weight, and based on 100% by weight of the solids content in the anticorrosion paint composition [i], the epoxy resin is desirably contained in an amount of usually 10 to 70% by weight, preferably 10 to 60% by weight, because the resulting film exhibits excellent anticorrosion property.<br>
As the epoxy resin (el), a commercially available one is employable, and examples of the bisphenol type epoxy resins include "Epicoat 828", "Epicoat 834", "Epicoat 1001", "Epicoat 1004", "Epicoat 807", "Epicoat 4004P" and "Epicoat 4007P"  (available from Japan Epoxy Resins Co., Ltd.). Amine-based curing agent (e2) for epoxy resin<br>
Examples of the amine-based curing agents (e2) for epoxy resin contained in the anticorrosion paint composition [i] include Mannich modified amines formed by Mannich condensation reaction of phenols with formalin<br>
and amine compounds, and aliphatic polyamines. From the viewpoints that handling of the paint becomes easy and the pot life of the paint is in a preferred range, it is preferable to use polyamidoamine formed by condensation of mainly a dimeric acid with polyamine and having a first and a second reactive amino groups in a molecule. The amine-based curing agent (e2) for epoxy resin has only to be used theoretically in such an amount (equivalent amount) that the number of epoxy groups in the epoxy resin (el) becomes equal to the number of amino groups in the amine-based curing agent (e2), but in the present invention, the amine-based curing agent has only to be used in such an amount that the amount of the amino group becomes 0.35 to 0.9 equivalent, preferably 0.4 to 0.8 equivalent, based on 1 equivalent of the epoxy group. Further, based on 100 parts by weight of the epoxy resin (el), the amine-based curing agent (e2) can be used in an amount of, for example, 10 to 300 parts by weight, preferably 20 to 200 parts by weight.<br>
As the amine-based curing agent (e2) for epoxy resin, a commercially available one is employable, and examples thereof include "Lackamide TD966" (available from Dainippon Ink &amp; Chemicals Inc.) and "Sanmide 307D-60" (available from Sanwa Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.).<br>
Extender pigment (e3)<br>
As the extender pigment (e3) which can be contained in the anticorrosion paint composition [i], a hitherto known one is employable, and examples thereof include talc, silica, mica, clay, calcium carbonate, kaolin, alumina white, white carbon, aluminum hydroxide, magnesium carbonate, barium carbonate, barium sulfate, titanium oxide and carbon black. Of these, talc, barium sulfate, mica, titanium oxide or carbon black is preferably used in the invention. These extender pigments may be used singly or in combination of two or more kinds. The extender pigment (e3) can be contained in an amount of, for example, 20 to 100% by weight based on 100% by weight of the solids content in the anticorrosion paint composition [i]. Anti-sagging agent (e4)<br>
As the anti-sagging agent (e4) which can be contained in the anticorrosion paint composition [i], a hitherto known one is employable, and examples thereof include organic clay-based agent, salts, such as amine salts, stearate salts, lecithin salts and alkylsulfonic acid salts of Al, Ca and Zn, polyethylene wax, amide wax, hydrogenated castor oil wax-based agent, polyamide wax-based agent, mixtures thereof, synthetic silica fine<br>
powder and polyethylene oxide wax. Of these, polyamide wax is preferably used in the invention. The anti-sagging agent (e4) is contained in an amount of, for example, 0 to 5% by weight based on 100% by weight of the anticorrosion paint composition [i].<br>
In the preparation of the epoxy resin-based paint composition [i], the above-mentioned various components such as commercially available products have only to be blended in the above amounts in a conventional manner. In addition to the above components, various components used for epoxy resin-based anticorrosion coating films, such as solvent, liquid hydrocarbon resin, surface active agent and rust-preventive pigment, may be added in proper amounts, when needed. The epoxy resin-based paint composition is sometimes provided as a composition of two-pack type consisting of a main agent component containing the epoxy resin (el) and a curing agent component containing the amine-based curing agent (e2). Tie coat (B) for organopolysiloxane-based antifouling<br>
coating film<br>
The tie coat (B) for an organopolysiloxane-based antifouling coating film according to the invention is a tie coat (also referred to as a "binding film" or a "primer coat") formed on a surface of a base or an<br>
undercoating film (layer) (both of them being together referred to as a "base or the like") prior to formation of an organopolysiloxane-based antifouling coating film (layer) on the surface of the base or the like, and is formed by applying and curing the following specific moisture-curing organopolysiloxane-based composition.<br>
The moisture-curing organopolysiloxane-based composition comprises "(bl) organopolysiloxane having condensing functional groups at both ends of a molecule" and/or "(b2) a curing composition formed by subjecting (bl) organopolysiloxane having condensing functional groups at both ends of a molecule and a specific extender pigment (inorganic filler) to contact treatment (e.g., mixing) with heating or without heating".<br>
In the present invention, in any of the tie coat and tie coats in the later-described composite coating films, one or more extender pigments (which have not been subjected to contact treatment) may be contained in addition to the contact treatment product component (b2).<br>
As the extender pigment, a substance selected from the group consisting of silica, calcium carbonate, talc, mica, clay, kaolin and barium sulfate is used, preferably silica or calcium carbonate is used, and particularly preferably silica is used.<br>
As the moisture-curing organopolysiloxane-based composition, a curing composition, a composition for coating, a paint or the like, which has been previously proposed by the present applicant in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 181509/2001 (Japanese Patent Application No. 236694/2000) or Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 139816/2001 (Japanese Patent Application No. 327507/1999), can be preferably used.<br>
The tie coat of the invention obtained by applying the moisture-curing organopolysiloxane-based composition on a surface of a base or the like and curing the composition can be firmly bonded to the base or the like present below the lower surface of the tie coat and to the later-described organopolysiloxane-based antifouling coating film that becomes an outermost layer (finish coat). As a result, excellent antifouling performance of the organopolysiloxane-based antifouling coating film (layer) that is laminated on the tie coat surface and is a small burden to the environment can be continuously exhibited for a long period of time.<br>
Although the thickness of the tie coat (cured product) is not specifically restricted, it is in the range of usually 50 to 500 µm, preferably about 50 to 300 µm.<br>
Composition of the tie coat, a moisture-curing organopolysiloxane-based composition used for forming the tie coat, a coating method, etc. are described below in detail.<br>
Moisture-curing organopolysiloxane-based composition<br>
In the present invention, the tie coat (B) and a tie coat (B) layer of the later-described composite coating film are each preferably a tie coat composed of a specific moisture-curing organopolysiloxane-based composition, because such a tie coat exhibits excellent bond strength to a base or an epoxy-based primary rust-preventive coating film as an undercoating layer and excellent bond strength to a finish coat (C) formed on the upper surface of the tie coat (B) with a good balance.<br>
As previously described, the moisture-curing organopolysiloxane-based composition comprises any one or both of the following component (bl) and the following component (b2) that is a curing composition.<br>
That is to say, the moisture-curing organopolysiloxane-based composition comprises:<br>
(bl) organopolysiloxane having condensing functional groups at both ends of a molecule, and/or<br>
(b2) a curing composition formed by subjecting (bl) organopolysiloxane having condensing functional groups at<br>
both ends of a molecule and an extender pigment selected from the group consisting of silica, calcium carbonate, talc, mica, clay, kaolin and barium sulfate (preferably silica or calcium carbonate, particularly preferably silica) to contact treatment (typically mixing) with heating or without heating.<br>
In the present invention, an embodiment wherein one or more extender pigments similar to the extender pigment in the component (b2) are used instead of a part or the whole of the component (bl) is included.<br>
As the silica, hydrophobic silica and/or hydrophilic silica is preferable.<br>
The curing composition (b2) may be a curing composition (b2-l) obtained by subjecting the specific organopolysiloxane (bl) and the extender pigment to contact treatment without heating, or may be a curing composition (b2-2) obtained by subjecting the specific organopolysiloxane (bl) and the extender pigment to contact treatment with heating at room temperature or the like, or may be a combination of the curing composition (b2-l) obtained without heating and the curing composition (b2-2) obtained with heating.<br>
The contact treatment is desirably carried out by mixing the extender pigment such as silica with<br>
organopolysiloxane having condensing functional groups at both ends of a molecule (e.g., reaction product of dimethylpolyslloxane with<br>
vinyltris(methylethylketoximino)silane) with heating at a temperature of not lower than about 100°C and lower than the decomposition temperatures of the compounding components or without heating (temperature of about 15 to 25°C that is room temperature).  It is desirable that the organopolysiloxane (bl) having condensing functional groups at both ends of a molecule (e.g., the formula (i) in the working examples) and the extender pigment such as silica are subjected to close contact treatment under the above conditions, because a paint having excellent anti-sagging property is obtained and a coating film of a large thickness (excellent film thickness) is obtained.<br>
In the contact treatment, the extender pigment such as silica may be mixed with materials for preparing the organopolysiloxane (polymer) having condensing functional groups at both ends of a molecule (e.g., dimethylpolysiloxane and<br>
vinyltris(methylethylketoximino)silane) to perform reaction of the dimethylpolysiloxane with the vinyltris(methylethylketoximino)silane, whereby close<br>
contact of silica with the resulting polymer can be carried out.<br>
In the materials for forming the organopolysiloxane (bl), macromonomers (e.g., dimethylpolysiloxane) having high molecular weights are included as long as they can form the organopolysiloxane (bl) having condensing functional groups at both ends of a molecule. Organopolysiloxane (bl)<br>
The organopolysiloxane (bl) is the same as organopolysiloxane (A) described in the aforesaid Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 181509/2001, and in this compound, both end groups of a molecule (chain molecule or molecular main chain) are condensation-reactive groups (condensing functional groups).<br>
As the organopolysiloxane (bl), such a condensation-reactive polymer that becomes a main component of organosilicone as described in Japanese Patent No. 2522854 is used, and a liquid polymer is particularly preferably used.<br>
The organopolysiloxane (bl) is desirably organopolysiloxane represented by the following formula [a] :<br>

When a in the formula [a] is 0 or 1, W is desirably a hydrolyzable group, and when a is 2, W is desirably a hydroxyl group (-OH).  In the present invention, when W<br>

The alkyl group may be any of straight-chain, branched and alicyclic alkyl groups, and is preferably a straight-chain or branched alkyl group of 1 to 10 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 8 carbon atoms, or a cycloalkyl group of 3 to 6 carbon atoms. Examples of the straight-chain or branched alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, 2-ethylbutyl and octyl. Of these, methyl is particularly preferable. Examples of the alicyclic alkyl groups include cyclohexyl and cyclopentyl.<br><br><br><br><br>

The aryl group is desirably an aryl group of 6 to 15 carbon atoms, preferably about 6 to 12 carbon atoms, and examples thereof include phenyl, tolyl, xylyl, naphtyl and diphenyl. Of these, phenyl is particularly preferable.<br>
The cycloalkyl group is desirably a cycloalkyl group of 3 to 8 carbon atoms and is, for example, cyclohexyl. The aralkyl group is desirably an aralkyl group of 7 to 10 carbon atoms in all, preferably 7 to 8 carbon atoms in all, and examples thereof include benzyl and 2-phenylethyl.<br>
A part or all of hydrogen atoms bonded to the carbon atoms in the above groups R1 may be replaced with halogen atoms, such as F, Cl, Br and I, or cyano groups. Examples of the halogenated alkyl groups include chloromethyl, 3,3,3-trifluoropropyl and 2-cyanoethyl.<br>
As R in the formula [a], an unsubstituted monovalent hydrocarbon group is preferable, and methyl or phenyl is particularly preferable. When plural R1 or plural R are present in the organopolysiloxane (bl) represented by the formula [a], plural R1 may be the same as each other,<br>
plural R may be the same as each other, and R1 and R may be the same as each other.<br>
The organopolysiloxane (bl) desirably has a viscosity at 25°C of usually 25 to 1,500,000 mPa-s, preferably 25 to 500,000 mPa-s, more preferably 500 to 200,000 mPa-s, particularly preferably 1,000 to 100,000 mPa-s, taking into consideration coating property of the resulting composition, anti-sagging property given when the resulting composition is diluted with a solvent, etc,<br>
In the present invention, the organopolysiloxane (bl) having condensing functional groups at both ends of a molecule is preferably organopolysiloxane having condensing functional groups of such a type as is cured by deoximation reaction.<br>
In the moisture-curing organopolysiloxane-based composition, the component (bl), particularly a silicone rubber of deoxime curing type, is desirably contained in an amount of usually 20 to 80% by weight, preferably 40 to 70% by weight, from the viewpoint of enhancement of coating efficiency. Curing composition (b2)<br>
The curing composition (b2) is formed by subjecting the organopolysiloxane (bl) having condensing functional groups at both ends of a molecule, typically oxime group-<br>
containing organopolysiloxane (bO), and the extender pigment, typically silica, together to contact treatment<br>
(e.g., mixing) with heating or without heating.  In the present invention, for preparing the component (b2), materials for forming the component (bl) may be used instead of the component (bl) that is a polymer.<br>
When contact of the component (bl) with the extender pigment such as silica is carried out with heating or without heating, a close contact product of the component<br>
(bl) with silica or the like is obtained, and prevention of sagging of the resulting paint or increase of film thickness tends to be advantageously performed.<br>
Examples of the extender pigments include silica, calcium carbonate, talc, mica, clay, kaolin and barium sulfate. Of these, silica and calcium carbonate are preferable, and silica is particularly preferable, from the viewpoints of coating workability of the resulting paint and handling of the paint. These extender pigments may be used singly or in combination of two or more kinds,<br>
Silica that is preferably used as the extender pigment is the same as silica described in the aforesaid Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 181509/2001 or the aforesaid Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 139816/2001, and the curing composition (particularly<br>
thermal contact treatment product) is the same as the component (B) described in these publications.<br>
That is to say, silica includes hydrophilic silica (surface-untreated silica), such as wet process silica (hydrated silica) and dry process silica (fumed silica, anhydrous silica), and surface-treated hydrophobic silica, such as hydrophobic wet process silica and hydrophobic fumed silica.<br>
In the present invention, as the silica component, hydrophobic silica and hydrophilic silica may be used in combination, or hydrophobic silica may be used singly.<br>
In the case where hydrophobic silica and hydrophilic silica are used in combination in the invention, it is preferable that at least the hydrophilic silica has been subjected to heat treatment together with a part or the whole of the component (bl), and it is more preferable that both of the hydrophilic silica and the hydrophobic silica have been subjected to heat treatment together with a part or the whole of the component (bl)<br>
In the case where hydrophobic silica is used singly in the invention, the hydrophobic silica has been subjected to heat treatment together with a part or the whole of the component (bl).<br>
Of the above silica, the wet process silica has an adsorbed water content (also referred to as a "water content") of usually about 4 to 8%, a bulk density of 200 to 300 g/L, and a primary particle diameter of 10 to 30 mµ. Although the specific surface area (BET surface area) of the wet process silica has only to be not less than 10 m2/g, it is preferably 50 to 800 m2/g, more preferably about 100 to 300 m2/g.<br>
The dry process silica (fumed silica) has a water content of usually not more than 1.5%.<br>
Immediately after preparation, the dry process silica has a water content (initial water content) of low level such as not more than 0.3%, but when the silica is allowed to stand, it adsorbs moisture to increase a water content, and after a lapse of several months from preparation, the water content becomes, for example, about 0.5 to 1.0%. Although the bulk density of the dry process silica varies depending upon the type of the silica and is not determined indiscriminately, it is, for example, 50 to 100 g/L. The primary particle diameter of<br>
the dry process silica is in the range of 8 to 20 mµ. Although the specific surface area (BET surface area) of the dry process silica has only to be not less than 10<br>
m2/g, it is preferably 100 to 400 m2/g, more preferably about 180 to 300 m2/g.<br>
The hydrophobia fumed silica is one obtained by surface-treating the dry process silica with an organosilicon compound, such as methyltrichlorosilane, dimethyldichlorosilane, hexamethyldisilazane, hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane or<br>
octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane. The amount of water adsorbed by the hydrophobic fumed silica with time is small, and the water content of this silica is usually not more than 0.3% and in many cases 0.1 to 0.2%. Although the specific surface area of the hydrophobic fumed silica has only to be not less than 10 m2/g, it is preferably 100 to 300 m2/g, more preferably 120 to 230 m2/g. The primary particle diameter thereof is 5 to 50 mµ,, and the bulk density thereof is 50 to 500 g/L.<br>
In case of the hydrophobic fumed silica having been heat treated together with the component (bl) (heat treated hydrophobic fumed silica), water adsorbed on a surface of the hydrophobic silica has been physically reduced or removed, and the water content is usually not more than 0.2%, preferably not more than 0.1%, particularly preferably 0.05 to 0.1%, and other property<br>
values such as bulk density are the same as those of the hydrophobia silica.<br>
In the moisture-curing organopolysiloxane-based composition, the component (b2) (curing composition (b2)) is desirably contained in an amount of usually 1 to 100 parts by weight, preferably 2 to 50 parts by weight, particularly preferably 5 to 30 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the component (bl).<br>
When the curing composition (b2) is contained in the above amount in the moisture-curing organopolysiloxane-based composition, the composition can provide a coating film of excellent film strength and film hardness, has excellent thixotropic property and proper viscosity and can be favorably applied by spray coating.  For example, it can form a coating film (tie coat) of large thickness by one coating operation even on a surface of a base standing upright, and it can be applied thick to a certain extent even by one coating operation, so that coating efficiency can be enhanced and labor can be saved. Therefore, the above amount is preferable.<br>
Further, it is desirable that the component (b2) is contained in an amount of usually 1 to 40% by weight, preferably 10 to 20% by weight, in the moisture-curing organopolisiloxane-based composition, because thick<br>
coating by one coating operation becomes possible and coating efficiency can be enhanced.<br>
If the amount of the component (b2) is less than the lower limit of the above range, sufficient film strength and film hardness are not obtained. Moreover, desired thixotropic property is not obtained, and therefore, desired large film thickness is not obtained occasionally by spray coating of one coating operation.  If the amount of the component (b2) is more than the upper limit of the above range, viscosity of the resulting paint becomes excessively high, and it becomes necessary to dilute the paint with a solvent such as a thinner to a proper viscosity suitable for coating, so that desired large film thickness is not obtained occasionally by spray coating of one coating operation.<br>
In the case where the hydrophobic silica (i) such as hydrophobic fumed silica and the hydrophilic silica (ii) such as surface-untreated silica are used in combination for the component (b2) (i.e., curing composition (b2)) in the invention, they are desirably used in such amounts that the weight ratio ((i)/(ii)) becomes 1/99 to 99/1, preferably 20/80 to 80/20, particularly preferably 30/70 to 70/30. When the hydrophobic silica (i) and the hydrophilic silica (ii) are used in combination in such a<br>
weight ratio, the resulting moisture-curing organopolysiloxane-based composition exhibits excellent paint stability in the stages of preparation, keeping and storage and has sufficient thixotropic property, and a tie coat (bonding film) obtained by curing the composition tends to have excellent film strength and film hardness.<br>
It is preferable that the tie coat of the invention substantially contains no antifouling agent similarly to the organopolysiloxane-based antifouling coating film. Silane coupling agent (b3)<br>
In the present invention, the moisture-curing organopolysiloxane-based composition used for forming the tie coat may further contain a silane coupling agent (b3) in order to enhance interlaminar bond strength.<br>
As the silane coupling agent (b3), there can be used, for example, "organosilane or its partial hydrolyzate (C)" described in the paragraphs [0051] to [0054] of Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 181509/2001, "adhesion reinforcing agent (silane compound)" described in the paragraphs [0031] to [0032] of Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 80564/2002 (Japanese Patent Application No. 268207/2000), or a component (A) of claim 1 of National Publication of International Patent No.<br>
505845/1993, more specifically, "aminosilane materials" described from the 9th line on the upper left-hand section in page 3 to the 5th line from the bottom on the lower left-hand section in page 3 of the publication.<br>
In the case where the organopolysiloxane component (bl) having condensing functional groups at both ends of a molecule is represented by the aforesaid formula [a], and in the formula [a], W is a hydroxyl group and a is 2, the silane coupling agent (b3) is preferably further contained in the composition in addition to the component (bl) and the component (b2).<br>
The silane coupling agent (b3) is, for example, organosilane represented by the formula [I] : R1aSiX4-a (wherein R1 is an unsubstituted or substituted monovalent hydrocarbon group of 1 to 8 carbon atoms, which is the same as R or R1 in the formula [a] , X is a hydrolyzable group which is the same as W in the formula [a], and a is 0 or 1) or its partial hydrolyzate described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 181509/2001.<br>
That is to say, in the case where organopolysiloxane having hydroxyl groups (-OH) at both ends of a molecule (chain molecule, molecular chain), specifically, curing organopolysiloxane in which both ends of a molecular chain are capped with silanol groups (=Si-OH), is used as<br>
the component (bl), it is particularly preferable to use the component (bl) and the component (b3) functioning as a crosslinking agent or a curing agent in combination.<br>
In the case where curing organopolysiloxane in which both ends of a molecule are capped with hydrolyzable groups is used as the component (bl), curing can sufficiently proceed even if the curing agent component (b3) is not present, but also in this case, it is more preferable to use the component (b3).<br>
X is a hydrolyzable group which is the same as W in<br>
the formula [a]. Examples of the organosilanes represented by the formula [I] and their (partial) hydrolyzates include methyltrimethoxysilane, methyltri(methylethylketoxime)silane, methyltripropenyloxysilane, methyltriacetoxysilane, silane compounds wherein a methyl group of these silane compounds is replaced with a vinyl group, a phenyl group, a trifluoropropyl group or the like (e.g., vinyltrimethoxysilane), and their partial hydrolyzates. In this case, the hydrolyzable group is preferably a ketoxime group.<br>
Although the silane coupling agent (b3) such as "organosilane or its hydrolyzate (b3)" can be used in an amount of 1 to 60 parts by weight based on 100 parts by<br>
weight of the organopolysiloxane (bl), it is desirably contained in an amount of usually 1 to 20 parts by weight, preferably 2 to 10 parts by weight, in the moisture-curing organopolysiloxane-based composition. When the organosilane or its hydrolyzate (b3) is contained in such an amount in the composition, crosslinking reaction of the component (bl) favorably proceeds, and the resulting coating film (tie coat) has appropriate hardness and tends to have economical advantage.<br>
The silane coupling agent is specifically, for example, "KBE 1003" (vinyltriethoxysilane, available from<br>
Shin-Etsu Chemical Co., Ltd.) or "KBM403" (y-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane, available from Shin-Etsu Chemical Co., Ltd.).<br>
From the viewpoint of enhancement of adhesion to a primary rust-preventive coating film, the silane coupling agent is used in an amount of usually 0.05 to 5% by weight, preferably 0.1 to 2% by weight, in the moisture-curing organopolysiloxane-based composition.<br>
As the silane coupling agent (b3), an aminosilane compound may be used as described above.  Examples of the aminosilane compounds include compounds described as "aminosilane materials (A)" in the aforesaid National<br>
Publication of International Patent No. 505845/1993 (patent document 6).<br>

document 6), the primary amine functional silane (i) is,<br>
(CH2O) for example, 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane ( (CH3O) si-<br>

and the reaction product (ii) is, for example, (C2H50) 3Si (CH2) 3-NH-CH2-CH (OH) -CH2-0 (CH2) 3Si (OCH3) 3.<br>
The aminosilane compound is used in the same amount as that of the aforesaid "organosilane or its hydrolyzate". Silicone oil (c4)<br>
The moisture-curing organopolysiloxane-based composition for use the invention may contain such a silicone oil (c4) as previously described, that is, the silicone oil (c4) described in the paragraphs [0058] to [0071] of Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 181509/2001 previously proposed by the present applicant.<br>
In the present invention, the silicone oil (c4), preferably one or more kinds of the silicone oil [II], the silicone oil [III] and the silicone oil [IV], may be contained in the total amount of 0.1 to 200 parts by<br>
weight, preferably 20 to 100 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the component (bl). Preparation of moisture-curing organopolysiloxane-based<br>
composition<br>
The moisture-curing organopolysiloxane-based composition used for forming the tie coat (B) of the invention or a tie coat (layer) of the later-described composite coating film (C) of the invention can be prepared by heat-treating a part or the whole of the component (bl), namely, organopolysiloxane (bl) having condensing functional groups at both ends of a molecule (or its materials (bl)) and at least hydrophilic silica of hydrophilic silica and hydrophobic silica, preferably both of hydrophilic silica and hydrophobic silica (or hydrophobic silica when the hydrophobic silica is used alone), at a temperature of not lower than 100°C and not higher than decomposition temperatures of the compounding components, preferably 100 to 300°C, more preferably about 140 to 200°C, at atmospheric pressure or under reduced pressure for usually 30 minutes to 3 hour, then adding a residue of the component (bl), the component (b2), and if necessary, the component (b3), and then if necessary adding the organopolysiloxane (c4) having no<br>
condensing functional group that is an unreactive silicone oil.<br>
Instead of the above treatment with heating, contact treatment without substantial heating (specifically, at room temperature or a temperature of a little higher than room temperature) may be carried out for about 1 to 8 hours.<br>
It is also possible that hitherto known compounding ingredients, such as organosiloxane curing catalyst, antifouling agent, thixotropic property imparting agent, plasticizer, inorganic dehydrating agent (stabilizer), anti-sagging/anti-settling agent (thickening agent), coloring pigment, dye, other film-forming components, solvent (e.g., xylene), germicide, antifungal agent, anti-aging agent, antioxidant, antistatic agent, flame retardant, heat conduction improver and adhesion imparting agent, are added in given amounts at once or in an arbitrary order and then stirred or mixed to dissolve or disperse them in a solvent.<br>
When hydrophilic silica and hydrophobic silica are used in combination as silica as described above, at least hydrophilic silica, preferably both of hydrophilic silica and hydrophobic silica, are heat-treated together with the component (bl). As a result, the component (bl)<br>
and the component (b2) in the resulting composition have excellent affinity for each other, aggregation of the component (b2) does not take place, and the resulting moisture-curing organopolysiloxane-based composition exhibits proper fluidity and proper thixotropic property, so that a coating film of desired sufficient thickness can be formed by a small number of coating operation times, such as one coating operation, even on a perpendicular coating surface.<br>
For stirring or mixing the above components, a hitherto known mixing/stirring apparatus, such as Ross mixer, planetary mixer or Shinagawa type universal stirring machine, is properly used.  As the catalyst (b5), for example, a catalyst described in Japanese Patent No. 2522854 (e.g., metallic compound such as titanium compound or tin compound) is preferably used. Specifically, there can be mentioned, for example, tin carboxylates, such as tin naphthenate and tin oleate; tin compounds, such as dibutyltin diacetate, dibutyltin dioctoate, dibutyltin dilaurate, dibutyltin dioleate, dibutyltin oxide, dibutyltin dimethoxide and dibutylbis(triethoxysiloxy)tin; titanic acid esters or titanium chelate compounds, such as tetraisopropoxytitanium, tetra-n-butoxytitanium,<br>

Of the above curing catalysts, the metallic compound (b5) is preferable, and the tin compound or the titanium compound is more preferable.<br>
The catalyst is used in an amount of not more than 10 parts by weight, preferably not more than 5 parts by weight, more preferably not more than 1 part by weight,<br>
based on 100 parts by weight of the component (bl), and when the catalyst is used, the lower limit of the amount used is preferably 0.0001 part by weight (namely, 1 ppm), particularly preferably 0.001 part by weight (namely, 10 ppm) .<br>

Examples of the organic pigments include carbon black, phthalocyanine blue and Prussian blue. Examples of the inorganic pigments include those which are neutral and unreactive, such as titanium white, red iron oxide, barite powder, silica, calcium carbonate, talc, chalk and iron oxide powder; and those (active pigments) which are basic and reactive to acidic substances contained in a<br>
paint, such as zinc white, (ZnO, zinc oxide), white lead, red lead, zinc dust and lead suboxide powder.  Further, various colorants such as dyes may be contained. The above various pigments are used in the total amount of 0.5 to 45% by weight, preferably about 3 to 10% by weight, in the moisture-curing organopolysiloxane-based composition.

Solvent<br>
Although a solvent may be contained or may not be contained in the moisture-curing organopolysiloxane-based composition for use in the invention, the above-mentioned various components can be used after they are dissolved or dispersed in a solvent when needed. As the solvent, any of various solvents usually added to antifouling paints, such as those of aliphatic, aromatic, ketone, ester, ether and alcohol types, are employable. Examples of the aromatic solvents include xylene and toluene. Examples of the ketone solvents include MIBK and cyclohexanone. Examples of the ether solvents include propylene glycol monomethyl ether and propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate (PGMAC). Examples of the alcohol solvents include isopropyl alcohol.<br>
Although the solvent can be used in any amount, it is used in an amount of, for example, 0.1 to 9999 parts by weight, preferably 1 to 50 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the component (bl). Further, the solvent is used in such an amount that the amount of the solvent in the moisture-curing organopolysiloxane-based composition becomes 1 to 99% by weight, preferably 5 to 50% by weight, particularly preferably 20 to 40% by weight. Taking into consideration coating property<br>
(anti-sagging property) and film thickness obtained by one coating operation, the viscosity (25°C, B type viscometer, No. 3 rotor) of the moisture-curing organopolysiloxane-based composition containing the solvent in the above amount is, for example, 0.01 to 500 poise (25°C), preferably about 0.1 to 200 poise (25°C), and in other words, it is 1 to 50,000 mPa-s, preferably about 10 to 20,000 mPa-s.<br>
Next, the first to the third organopolysiloxane-based antifouling composite coating films (composite coating films) of the invention are described.<br>
The first and the second composite coating films are described first.<br>
First and second organopolysiloxane-based antifouling composite coating films<br>
The first organopolysiloxane-based antifouling composite coating film (first composite coating film) of the invention is formed by closely laminating, on a base, a tie coat (B) and the below-described finish coat (C) obtained by applying and curing an organopolysiloxane-based antifouling paint, in this order from the base side toward the surface that comes into contact with seawater or the like (base/(B)/(C)).<br>
The first composite coating film of the invention having the above constitution exerts such effects that interlaminar bond strength between the base and the finish coat is more enhanced than conventional composite coating films, the coating film has excellent antifouling performance, and because the coating film contains no antifouling agent, it rarely becomes a burden to the environment.<br>
In the second organopolysiloxane-based antifouling composite coating film (second composite coating film) of the invention, a primary rust-preventive coating film, the tie coat (B) and the finish coat (C) are closely laminated on a base in this order (base/primary rust-preventive coating film/(B)/(C)), and this second composite coating film differs from the first composite coating film in that prior to provision of the tie coat (B) on the base surface, a primary rust-preventive coating film, in particular, epoxy-based rust-preventive coating film is formed on the base surface by applying and curing a primary rust-preventive paint, as described above.<br>
The second composite coating film provided with the primary rust-preventive coating film as above exerts the same effects as those of the first composite coating film,<br>
that is, interlaminar bond strength between the primary rust-preventive coating film on the base surface and the finish coat is enhanced, the coating film has excellent antifouling performance, and because the coating film contains no antifouling agent, it rarely becomes a burden to the environment.  In addition, the second composite coating film is superior to the first composite coating film in enhancement of rust prevention property. Tie coat (B)<br>
The tie coat (B) to constitute the first or the second composite coating film is the same as the aforesaid tie coat.<br>
In the first composite coating film of the invention, the thickness of each film is not specifically restricted, but the thickness of the tie coat (B) is, for example, about 50 to 250 µm, the thickness of the finish coat (C) is about 75 to 300 µm, and the total thickness of these films is, for example, about 150 to 550 µm.<br>
In the second composite coating film of the invention, the thickness of the primary rust-preventive coating film is not specifically restricted, but the thickness thereof is, for example, about 100 to 500 µm, the thickness of the tie coat (B) is, for example, about 50 to 200 µm, the thickness of the finish coat (C) is<br>
about 75 to 300 µm, and the total thickness of these films is, for example, about 250 to 1000 µm. Finish coat (C)<br>
The finish coat (C) is formed on a surface of the tie coat (B) by applying and curing an organopolysiloxane-based antifouling paint. In particular, a preferred embodiment of the finish coat (C) is formed by applying and curing a three-pack type organopolysiloxane-based curing composition comprising (cl) a main agent comprising organopolysiloxane having condensing functional groups at both ends of a molecule, (c2) a curing agent component comprising tetraalkoxysilicate or its condensate and (c3) a curing accelerator component comprising a metallic compound.<br>
In the three-pack type organopolysiloxane-based curing composition for forming the finish coat (C),<br>
the curing agent comprising tetraalkoxysilicate or its condensate in the curing component (c2) is desirably contained in an amount of usually 0.5 to 15 parts by weight, preferably 1 to 10 parts by weight, and<br>
the curing accelerator comprising a metallic compound in the curing accelerator component (c3) is desirably contained in an amount of usually 0.1 to 10 parts by weight, preferably 0.5 to 5 parts by weight,<br>
each amount being based on 100 parts by weight of the organopolysiloxane (cl) in the main agent (cl).<br>
In the above description of the amounts of the components, an extender pigment such as silica, a coloring pigment, a solvent and the like in the main agent (cl) are not included in the amount of the organopolysiloxane (cl); a solvent and the like in the curing agent component (c2) are not included in the amount of the curing agent comprising tetraalkoxysilicate or its condensate; and a solvent and the like in the curing accelerator component (c3) are not included in the amount of the curing accelerator comprising a metallic compound.<br>
With regard to the compounding ratio between the main agent; (cl), the curing agent component (c2) and the curing accelerator component (c3), it is desirable from the viewpoint of coating workability that the main agent (cl) is contained in an amount of 50 to 85 parts by weight, the curing agent component (c2) is contained in an amount of 10 to 40 parts by weight, and the curing accelerator component (c3) is contained in an amount of 1 to 10 parts by weight, in the total 100 parts by weight of the components ((cl) + (c2) + (c3)) .<br>
In the storage, keeping and transportation of the three-pack type organopolysiloxane-based curing composition, the components (cl) to (c3) are separately kept in different containers to inhibit progress of reactions such as self condensation reaction and crosslinking reaction, and in the use of the composition, the components (cl) to (c3) have only to be mixed.<br>
When the components (cl) to (c3) of the three-pack type organopolysiloxane-based curing composition are mixed, curing reaction proceeds under heating as a matter of course, but the reaction proceeds even at a temperature of about room temperature (15 to 25°C), and hence heating is not particularly necessary. However, heating may be carried out to promote the reaction if desired, or heating, air blowing or the like may be carried out to forcedly evaporate or remove the solvent.<br>
For providing the rust-preventive coating film (A), the tie coat (B), the finish coat (C) and the like on the base surface, one film (layer) of them is completely dried and cured, and then the subsequent film (layer) may be formed thereon. From the viewpoint of enhancement of interlaminar bond strength, however, it is preferable that when the tie coat (B) is in a state of semi-curing to touch, that is, when the tie coat is not completely<br>
cured, the finish coat is applied and cured.  If the films (layers) are formed in this manner, uniform thickness of each layer can be ensured, and the interlaminar bond strength can be enhanced.  Further, each layer may be made to have a desired thickness by carrying out coating operation once to plural times.<br>
The three-pack type organopolysiloxane-based curing composition can be applied by the use of a hitherto known coating machine or the like.<br>

Examples of the organotin polymers (resin components) for forming the organotin polymer-based old antifouling coating film include homopolymers or copolymers of organotin-containing unsaturated monomers described in the paragraph [0003] of Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 176125/1998 (see Japanese Patent Publication No. 21426/1965, Japanese Patent Publication No. 9579/1969, Japanese Patent Publication No. 13392/1971, Japanese Patent Publication No. 20491/1974, Japanese Patent Publication No. 11647/1976, Japanese Patent Publication No. 12049/1976, Japanese Patent Publication No. 48170/1977), and organotin (co)polymers<br>
described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 200189/1994 (paragraph [0010]), U.K. Patent No. 1,589,246 and U.S. Patent No. 4,021,392.<br>
For example, the organotin-based copolymer described in U.K. Patent No. 1,589,246 is an organotin-based copolymer wherein 50 to 80% by weight of constituent units of at least one triorganotin salt of an olefin unsaturated carboxylic acid and the residual amount (20 to 80% by weight) of constituent units of at least one olefin unsaturated comonomer are present.<br>
In the present invention, of such conventional organotin polymers, trialkylorganotin copolymers (number of carbon atoms of alkyl group: I to 10, preferably 3 to 6) are desirable, and particularly, tributyltin polymers have been most frequently used and are most preferable because the resulting film exhibits excellent bonding to a coating film formed thereon and excellent film strength, (g4) Antifouling coating film formed from antifouling paint containing water-soluble resin<br>
The antifouling coating film (g4) is formed from an antifouling paint containing a water-soluble resin (i).<br>
In the present invention, the antifouling coating film (g4) may be formed from an antifouling paint containing the water-soluble resin (i) and a water-<br>
slightly soluble resin (ii). Although the ratio between the water-soluble resin (i) and the water-slightly soluble resin (ii) in the antifouling coating film is not specifically restricted, the water-soluble resin (i) is frequently contained in an amount of about 10 to 90 parts by weight in the total 100 parts by weight of the resins (i) and (ii).<br>
The water-soluble resin (i) is, for example, rosin or its derivative. Examples of the rosins and their derivatives include those described in the paragraph [0119] of Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 3776/2002 and the paragraph [0073] of Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 26729/2001 previously proposed by the present applicant.<br>
That is to say, examples of the rosins include gum rosin, wood rosin and tall oil rosin, and any of them is employable in the invention. Examples of the rosin derivatives include disproportionated rosin, low-melting point disproportionated rosin, hydrogenated rosin, polymerized rosin, maleic rosin, aldehyde modified rosin, polyoxyalkylene ester of rosin, reduced rosin (rosin alcohol), metal salts of rosin (e.g., copper salt, zinc salt or magnesium salt of rosin) and rosin amine. These<br>
rosins and their derivatives are used singly or in combination of two or more kinds.<br>
The antifouling coating film (g4) containing the rosin or the like as a resin component (vehicle, matrix) is an antifouling coating film of "dissolution matrix type" or "hydration decomposition type". The antifouling coating films (gl), (g2) and (g3) are films of hydrolysis type, and when the polymer present on the film surface comes into contact with seawater, it undergoes hydrolysis reaction to thereby perform self dissolution and surface renewal, whereby antifouling performance is exhibited.<br>
Examples of the water-slightly soluble resins (ii) include vinyl chloride resin, modified vinyl resin (e.g., vinyl acetate-based resin), epoxy resin, acrylic resin, non-crosslinking or crosslinking copolymer having (meth)acrylic acid metal salt unit, and unsaturated carboxylic acid silyl ester copolymer.<br>
When an epoxy-based sealer coat (A), a tie coat (B) and an organopolysiloxane-based finish coat are formed in this order on the surface of the old antifouling coating film (G) such as the antifouling coating film (gl), (g2), (g3) or (g4), excellent antifouling property and interlaminar bond property are exhibited.<br>
Organopolysiloxane-based old antifouling coating film<br>
(g5)<br>
An old antifouling coating film other than the old coating films (gl) to (g4) is, for example, an organopolysiloxane-based old antifouling coating film<br>
(g5) .<br>
The organopolysiloxane-based old antifouling coating film (g5) exhibits excellent bonding to any of a tie coat<br>
(B) and a finish coat (C). The antifouling coating film<br>
(g5), however, exhibits poor bonding to the epoxy-based sealer coat (A) . Therefore, when a tie-coat (B) and a finish coat (C) are provided in this order on the surface of the organopolysiloxane-based old antifouling coating film (g5) without forming an epoxy-based sealer coat (A) so as to form a layer structure of (g5)/(B)/(C) or<br>
(g5)/(C), an antifouling composite coating film having excellent antifouling property and bond property can be formed.<br>
The organopolysiloxane-based old antifouling coating film (g5) is, for example, an old antifouling coating film formed by condensing organopolysiloxane having condensing functional groups at both ends of a molecule, which is described in Japanese Patent No. 2522854 and Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 181509/2001<br>
previously proposed by the present applicant, or an old antifouling coating film obtained by applying and curing an antifouling agent composition containing oxyalkylene group-containing chain organopolysiloxane (i.e., polyether modified silicone oil) described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 176576/2001.<br>
In the present invention, the organopolysiloxane-based old antifouling coating film (g5) is particularly preferably an antifouling coating film obtained by condensing organopolysiloxane having condensing functional groups at both ends of a molecule, which is "organopolysiloxane (A) " described in the paragraphs [0029] to [0042] of Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 181509/2001.<br>
More specifically, the organopolysiloxane used for forming the old antifouling coating film (G) is desirably represented by the following formula [a] , similarly to the organopolysiloxane [a] contained in the moisture-curing organopolysiloxane-based composition for forming the tie coat.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
In the formula [a], W is a hydroxyl group (-OH) or a hydrolyzable group, R1 and R are each independently an unsubstituted or substituted monovalent hydrocarbon group of 1 to 12 carbon atoms, plural R1 or plural R may be the same or different, n is an integer of 5 or more, and a is 0, 1 or 2.<br>
When a in the formula [a] is 0 or 1, W is desirably a hydrolyzable group, and when a is 2, W is desirably a hydroxyl group (-OH).<br>
This organopolysiloxane [a] is the same as the organopolyslloxane (bl) that is the aforesaid tie coat-forming material, or "organopolysiloxane (bl) having condensing functional groups at both ends of a molecule" in a tie coat (B) of the below-described new antifouling coating film, or the organopolysiloxane for forming the main agent component (cl) in the aforesaid finish coat (C) . The organopolysiloxane-based old antifouling coating film and the below-described new antifouling coating film contain the same polymer component and tend to have excellent bond property. New antifouling coating film<br>
The new antifouling coating film is preferably formed on a surface of the above-mentioned old antifouling coating film (G), and desirably has the same<br>
structure as the layer (A)/layer (B)/layer (C) structure of the aforesaid second organopolysiloxane-based composite coating film of the invention.<br>
That is to say, the new antifouling coating film consists of an epoxy-based sealer coat (A), a tie coat (B) and an organopolysiloxane-based finish coat (C), and is formed by bonding the films (layers) (A), (B) and (C) in such a manner that they are laminated in this order from the base side toward the surface that comes into contact mainly with seawater (old antifouling coating film (G)/(A)/(B)/(C) (surface layer)).<br>
In the new antifouling coating film, the thickness of the sealer coat (A) is not specifically restricted, but the thickness thereof is, for example, about 50 to 500 µm, the thickness of the tie coat (B) is, for example, about 50 to 200 µm, the thickness of the finish coat (C) is about 75 to 300 µm, and the total thickness of these films is, for example, about 250 to 1000 µm. Sealer coat, particularly epoxy-based sealer coat (A)<br>
To the undercoating film (A), detailed description previously given in the section of "Base and undercoating film" is preferably applied as it is.<br>
That is to say, for the sealer coat (A) which constitutes the new antifouling coating film and is<br>
directly bonded to the old antifouling coating film (G), such a zinc-based shop primer or such an epoxy resin-based anticorrosion paint as previously described is preferable. Tie coat (B)<br>
To the tie coat, detailed description previously given in the section of "Tie coat for organopolysiloxane-based antifouling coating film" is preferably applied as it is.<br>
The tie coat (B) to constitute the new antifouling coating film is also referred to as a "bonding film" or a "primer coat", and is formed as an intermediate coating layer on a surface of the sealer coat (A), namely, undercoating film (layer A), prior to formation of an organopolysiloxane-based antifouling coating film (layer C) that is an outermost layer.<br>
The tie coat (B) is formed by applying and curing such a specific moisture-curing organopolysiloxane-based composition as previously described. Finish coat (C)<br>
The finish coat (C) formed on a surface of the tie coat (B) is obtained by applying and curing an organopolysiloxane-based antifouling paint, and particularly to a preferred embodiment of the finish coat,<br>
detailed description previously given in the section of "Finish coat (C)" is preferably applied as it is.<br>
EFFECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the present invention, prior to formation of an organopolysiloxane-based antifouling coating film which substantially contains no antifouling agent and is a small burden to the environment on a surface of a base or an undercoating film, a specific tie coat (bonding film, primer coat) is formed on the surface of the base or the like. Therefore, the base or the undercoating layer such as a primary rust-preventive coating film present below the lower surface of the tie coat and the organopolysiloxane-based antifouling coating film, which substantially contains no antifouling agent, is a small burden to the environment and becomes an outermost layer (finish coat), can be firmly bonded with the tie coat. Moreover, because the tie coat itself has a certain thickness and is formed from an organopolysiloxane-based paint that is a small burden to the environment, a composite coating film having a large thickness, excellent antifouling property and excellent interlaminar bond strength can be readily formed by providing a finish coat on the tie coat surface.<br>
According to the present invention, further, because the tie coat and the organopolysiloxane-based antifouling coating film (finish coat) are laminated in this order on a surface of a base or an undercoating film to form a composite coating film, the base or the undercoating film (layer) and the finish coat can be firmly bonded with the tie coat. Moreover, the antifouling coating film (layer) as an outermost layer has small surface free energy (surface tension), and therefore, it is prevented from adhesion of marine organisms and exhibits excellent fouling-release property.<br>
Furthermore, in a preferred embodiment of the composite coating film of the invention, an antifouling agent is not substantially contained in any of the coating films (layers), and therefore, the composite coating film is a small burden to the environment and is highly safe for human beings, animals and plants.<br>
In particular, the second organopolysiloxane-based antifouling composite coating film wherein the undercoating film, particularly a primary rust-preventive coating film such as an epoxy-based zinc-rich primer, is provided on the base surface exhibits the same effects as those of the first composite coating film, namely, enhancement of interlaminar bond strength between the<br>
base and the finish coat, excellent antifouling performance and almost no burden to the environment because of no content of an antifouling agent.  In addition, the second composite coating film is superior to the first composite coating film in rust prevention and the like.<br>
In the case where a paint containing a silane coupling agent is used for forming the tie coat or each layer of the composite coating film, adhesion (interlaminar bond strength) between the layers, e.g., between the base or the undercoating layer and the tie coat or between the tie coat and the finish coat, tends to be further improved.<br>
In the case where an unreactive silicone oil is contained in the tie coat or the finish coat, the silicone oil exudates onto the film surface with time. Therefore, adhesion of marine organisms can be much more efficiently inhibited, and antifouling performance tends to become excellent. Because the silicone oil itself has no toxicity, a burden to the environment is not increased.<br>
The third composite coating film of the invention is formed by coating an old antifouling coating film (former antifouling coating film) for repair painting or repainting, and this composite coating film can be<br>
increased in film thickness by selecting a new antifouling coating film and exhibits excellent bonding between the old coating film and the new antifouling coating film and excellent antifouling property.<br>
The thickness of the old antifouling coating film (G) varies depending on the erosion rate or the portion of the film and is not uniform in many cases. The new antifouling coating film is desirably formed so as to have a smooth finished appearance and have the same thickness and the same layer structure as those of the second composite coating film.<br>

Immediately after the coating, the undried coating film was scratched with a wire having a diameter of 2 mm so that the tip of the wire should reach "BANNOH 500" to give a scratch mark. The coating film in this state was dried, and leveling property of the film was visually evaluated.<br>

As an undercoating material, "BANNOH 500" was applied in the same manner as above (125 µm x 2 = 250 µm (thickness)), and then any one of the tie coats (BA) to (BL) (compositions) shown in Table 1 was applied in a thickness of 100 µm.  (The finish coat of Table 2 was not applied.)<br>
Then, the resulting coating film was dried for one week under the conditions of 23°C and 55%RH, and antifouling property was evaluated. As a result, adhesion of slime and laver was confirmed on all of the coating films.<br>
Comparative Example T<br>
As an undercoating material, "BANNOH 500" was<br>
applied in the same manner as above (125 µm x 2 = 250 µm (thickness)), and then any one of the aforesaid finish coats (CM) to (Cu) (compositions) was applied in a thickness of 150 µm.  (The tie coat of Table 1 was not applied.)<br>

Comparative Example U<br>
In the formation of the same composite coating film as in Example CM or the like, a finish coat composition excluding organopolysiloxane (cl) (main agent of a finish coat) was applied as the finish coat (C). As a result, the finish coat composition was very liable to sag, and it was difficult of form a coating film having a thickness of 150 µm.<br>
Comparative Example V<br>
In the formation of the same composite coating film as in Example CM or the like, a finish coat composition excluding "a curing agent component (c2) containing tetraalkoxysilicate or its condensate" was applied as the finish coat (C).

7-1 Preparation of composite coating film<br>
Old antifouling coating film (G)<br>
A steel plate with a coating film, in which the antifouling agent elusion type composite coating film (G) had been formed on the steel plate surface, was immersed and allowed to stand still in Miyajima Bay in Hiroshima Prefecture for 12 months to perform immersion test, and then the coating film surface was washed with high-pressure fresh water of 15 MPa. Subsequently, the coating film (old antifouling coating film (G), also referred to as "old coating film") was dried. New antifouling coating film (new composite coating film) After the old antifouling coating film (G) was dried, a sealer coat (A) shown in Table 4 was applied by spray<br>
coating so that the dry film thickness should become 100 |im.<br>
Subsequently, a tie coat (B) shown in Table 1 was applied by spray coating so that the dry film thickness<br>

7-3. Interlaminar bond property of composite coating film<br>
After the composite coating film (G) was formed on the surface of the steel plate base, a bond strength between the steel plate and the composite coating film (G) was measured; after the sealer coat (A) is formed on the surface of the composite coating film (G), a bond strength between the composite coating film (G) and the sealer coat (A) was measured; after the tie coat (B) was formed on the surface of the sealer coat (A), a bond strength between the sealer coat (A) and the tie coat (B) was measured; and after the finish coat (C) was formed on the surface of the tie coat (B), a bond strength between the tie coat (B) and the finish coat (C) was measured. For measuring the interlaminar bond strength, a coating<br>
film having the later-described layer structure (see (i) to (iv)) was formed on the base surface, and then the bond strength was measured and evaluated.<br>
In the measurement of the interlaminar bond strength, on the composite coating film formed on the base surface, six cut lines were made in parallel at intervals of 2 mm, and then six cut lines were further made at intervals of 2 mm so that these cut lines should meet the previous cut lines at 90° (right angles), whereby 25 (5x5) lattice squares were formed.<br>
Onto the squares, a pressure-sensitive silicone tape (manufacturer, seller: Nitto Denko Corporation, model: No. 360UL) was stuck, then the tape was peeled off, and the number of residual squares of the composite coating film was counted. The bond strength (peel strength) was evaluated based on the number of residual squares (number of residual squares/25).<br>
Evaluation of interlaminar bond prpperty of laminated coating films<br>
(i) Evaluation of bond strength between base and coating film (G) composed of antifouling agent elusion type paint<br>
Coating was carried out in order of steel material/Ga/Gb/Gc (any one of (Gel) to (Gc8) in Table 3), and evaluation was carried out.  (For example, a coating<br><br>
film obtained by applying and curing the antifouling<br>
agent elusion type paint (Gel) is also referred to as<br>

As shown in the above (i) to (iv), coating films were lamination-bonded on the surface of the steel material, and using a pressure-sensitive silicone tape,<br>
the aforesaid interlaminar bond strength measurement (peel test) was carried out.<br>
The results are set forth in Table 6.<br>

In the evaluation of bond property between the sealer coat (A) and the tie coat (B), peeling sometimes takes place initially between the coating film (G) and the sealer coat (A) (in the present tests, such peeling did not occur), and in such a case, bond property between the sealer coat (A) and the tie coat (B) is judged as excellent.<br>
In the present tests, the old antifouling coating film (Gc3), the sealer coat (A2) and the tie coat (BD) were selected so that the lower bond property (between coating film (G) and sealer coat (A)) should not be<br>
inferior to the upper bond property (bond property<br>
between sealer coat (A) and tie coat (B)).<br>

(The sealer coat (A) of Table 4 was not applied.) After the coating, the resulting composite coating film was dried for one week under the conditions of 23°C and 55%RH, and then interlaminar bond property was confirmed. As a result, interlaminar bond property between all layers was poor.<br>

INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
The tie coat of the invention is interposed between a base or an undercoating layer and the<br>
organopolysiloxane-based antifouling coating film that is an outermost layer, and with the tie coat, the base and the outermost layer or the undercoating layer and the outermost layer can be firmly bonded. Moreover, the tie coat can contribute to increase of film thickness of the resulting composite coating film, and therefore, labor<br>
can be saved in the antifouling coating of an outer surface of a ship or a marine structure.<br>
The composite coating film of the invention is formed by laminating the tie coat and the organopolysiloxane-based antifouling coating film (finish coat) in this order on a surface of a base or an undercoating film, and therefore, the base or the undercoating film (layer) and the finish coat can be firmly bonded. Moreover, the antifouling coating film (layer) on the surface has small surface free energy (surface tension), and therefore, the antifouling coating film is prevented from adhesion of marine organisms and exhibits excellent fouling-release property.<br>
In this preferred composite coating film, further, an antifouling agent is not substantially contained in any of the films (layers), and therefore, the organpolysiloxane-based antifouling composite coating film is a small burden to the environment.<br>
According to the invention, there is provided a new-old composite coating film formed by coating an old antifouling coating film (former antifouling coating film) for repair painting or repainting. Regarding this composite coating film, increase of film thickness is possible, bonding between the old coating film and the<br>
new antifouling coating film formed on the old coating film surface is excellent, and antifouling property is excellent. Accordingly, if a surface of a ship or an underwater structure coated with the old antifouling coating film (G) is coated with such a new antifouling coating film, the new antifouling coating film exhibits very excellent bond property to the old antifouling coating film, hardly suffers peeling, can be increased in film thickness and has excellent antifouling property.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
