				<td>PROCESS FOR REMOVAL OF ODORS FROM SILICONES<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention is directed to a process, more specifically, to a process for removing malodorous elements from silicone dry cleaning solvents.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Current dry cleaning technology uses perchloroethylene ("PERC") or petroleum-based materials as the cleaning solvent. PERC suffers from toxicity and odor issues. The petroleum-based products are not as effective as PERC in cleaning garments. Volatile siloxanes are being introduced into the dry cleaning industry as an alternative to PERC. However, undesirable odors are sometimes carried over with the siloxane solvent, so there exists a need to remove the odor from the siloxane solvent.<br>
Methods for the purification of organopolysiloxanes have previously been reported as utilizing elemental metals (see US 5,245,067). Other patents disclose the purification of polyether silicones by contacting with an aqueous acid and removing the malodorous mi. terials formed (see US 5,118,764), or the reaction with hydrogen and a hydrogenation catalyst (see US 5,225,509). Hexamethyldisiloxane has been purified by successive treatments with a condensation catalyst, washing with water, separating the phases, distilling the siloxane, treating with acid clay and tnen treating with activated carbon (see US 4,774,346). Siloxanes have also been purified by contacting with steam and distilling out the impurities (see EP 543 665). A deodorization method utilizing active carbon to which a functional group has been fixed through a silanol bond has been reported (see US 5,238,899). Finally, a method was reported for purifying silicone oil by adding a drying agent and an adsorption agent to silicone and passing a low water vapor inert gas through the system (see US 4,661,612).<br>
There is a need for a method for removing unwanted odors in a volatile siloxane used in dry cleaning applications.<br>

The following examples illustrate the process of the present invention. They are illustrative and the claims are not to be construed as limited to the examples.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Cyclic siloxane (D5) that was used as a dry cleaning solvent and had been reclaimed was treated to remove the odors. Approximately 100 grams of used siloxane solvent with odors was mixed with 25 grams of different adsorbents to form a slurry. The slurry was mixed for 6 hours at ambient temperature. The adsorbent was removed by filtration and the siloxane solvent evaluated olfactorally to determine the efficacy of the purification method. The results and adsorbents used are shown in Table i below.<br>
The following adsorbents were used throughout the examples:<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Table i - Odor Removal from Cyclic Siloxane - Long Contact Time<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
 EXAMPLE 2<br>
A second set of experiments was run with a decreased contact time and a simulated in-line purification method. Used siloxane dry cleaning solvent was passed through a glass tube (approximately 1/2 inch diameter) containing various adsorbents. The purified siloxane solvent was again evaluated olfactorally to determine the efficacy of the purification method. The results and adsorbents used are shown in Table 2 below.<br>
Table 2 - Odor Removal from Siloxane Solvent - Short Contact Time<br><br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The same rating scale was used as in Example i. EXAMPLES<br>
A similar experiment to that run in Example i was completed, substituting a linear siloxane solvent (MD2M) for the cyclic siloxane. A sample of MD2M was spiked with 10% of D5 containing the malodorous elements. Table 3 shows the results of treating 200 g D5 that was spiked with various odors (propionaldehyde (0.0145 g). propionic acid (0.0330 g), butyraldehyde (0.0210 g) and butyric acid (0.0353 g)) and then analyzing the samples olfactorally and via GC. Approximately 40 grams of linear siloxane solvent spiked with odors was mixed with 10 grams of different adsorbents to form a slurry. The slurry was mixed for 6 hours at ambient temperature. The<br>
adsorbent was removed by filtration and the siloxane solvent evaluated olfactorally to determine the efficacy of the purification method. The results and adsorbents used are shown in Table 3 below.<br>
Table 3 - Odor Removal from Linear Siloxane Solvent<br><br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The same rating scale was used as in Example i.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Pure D5 was spiked with various components (as shown in Table 4). Samples were run through adsorbents (10% adsorbent loading for 1 minute contact time). The samples were analyzed by GC to determine the efficacy of odor removal.   Results are shown in Table 4.<br>
Table 4 - Analysis of Spiked D5 Samples.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The same rating scale as in Example 1 was used to determine the odor value.<br>
The results were obtained from 'GC/MS data and are reported in ppm and are compared to the original loading of the control sample. The powdered decolorizing charcoal and the powdered 13X molecular sieves removed essentially all the contaminants as seen by GC/MS. The same conclusion was also determined olfactorally with a value of 4 on the odor scale. The granular activated carbon was less effective, getting a 3 on the odor scale and showing some residual acids and aldehydes remaining after treatment.<br><br><br><br><br>
