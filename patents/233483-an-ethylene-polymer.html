				<td>The present invention relates to an ethylene polymer.<br>
Technical Field The present invention relates to an ethylene polymer which has excellent moldabillty and gives a molded product having excellent mechanical strength and external appearance, and a molded product obtained therefrom.<br>
Background Art<br>
High-density polyethylene which is in use in wide applications such as  films, pipes, bottles and the like, has been conventionally prepared by using a Ziegler-Natta catalyst or a chromium catalyst. However, because of the nature of such catalysts, there has been limitation on the control over the molecular weight distribution or composition distribution of the polymer.<br>
In recent years, several methods have been disclosed for preparation of an ethylene polymer having excellent moldabillty and mechanical strength, including an ethylene homopolymer or an ethylene•α-olefin copolymer of relatively small molecular weights and an ethylene homopolymer or an ethylene•α-olefin copolymer of relatively large molecular weights, according to a continuous polymerization technique, using a single-site catalyst which facilitates the control of the composition distribution, or a catalyst having such the single-site<br><br>
catalyst supported on a carrier.<br>
In the publication of JP-A No. 11-106432, disclosed<br>
is a composition prepared by melt-blending a low molecular<br>
weight polyethylene with a high molecular weight<br>
ethylene-a-olefin copolymer, which are obtained by<br>
polymerization in the presence of a supported, geometric<br>
constraint type single-site catalyst (CGC/Borate-based<br>
catalyst). However, since the molecular weight<br>
distribution of the composition is not broad, fluidity of<br>
the composition may become poor. In addition, although the<br>
claims of the above-mentioned patent application do jhot<br>
disclose a preferred range of the carbon number of aolefin<br>
that is to be copolymerized with ethylene, in the<br>
case of the carbon number being less than 6, it is expected<br>
that sufficient mechanical strength would not be exhibited.<br>
Further, because the molecular weight distribution (fHw/Mn)<br>
h o f t h e single-stage also expected that the product's mechanical properties such<br>
as impact strength and the like would be insufficient, as<br>
compared with the single-stage product of narrower<br>
molecular weight distribution. Moreover, the anticipation<br>
that a broad composition distribution of the single-stage<br>
polymerization product would result in deterioration of the<br>
above-mentioned strength is obvious from the cross<br>
fractionation chromatography (CFC) data described in<br>
"Functional Materials," published by CMC, Inc., Marqh 2001,<br>
p.50, and the cross fractionation chromatography (CFC) data<br>
described in Fig. 2 in the publication of JP-A No. 11-<br>
106432.<br>
In the publication of WO 01/25328, disclosed is an<br>
ethylene polymer which is obtained by solution<br>
polymerization in the presence of a catalyst system<br>
comprising CpTiNP (tBu) aCl2 and borate or alumoxane. This<br>
ethylene polymer has a weak crystalline structure due to<br>
the presence of a branch group in the low molecular weight<br>
component, and thus the polymer is expected to have poor<br>
mechanical strength. Also, since the molecular weight of<br>
the low molecular weight component is relatively large, it<br>
is expected that the polymer has low fluidity. Moreover,<br>
although the claims of the above-mentioned patent<br>
application do not disclose the preferred range of the<br>
carbon number of a-olefin that is to be copolymerized with<br>
ethylene, it is believed that when the carbon number; is<br>
less than 6, sufficient mechanical strength would not be<br>
exhibited.<br>
In the publication of EP 1201711 Al, disclosed is an<br>
ethylene polymer which is obtained by slurry polymerization<br>
in the presence of a catalyst system comprising<br>
ethylene-bis(4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-l-indenyl)zirconium<br>
dichloride with methylalumoxane supported on silica. Among<br>
such ethylene polymers, a single-stage polymerization<br>
product has a wide molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn),<br>
and thus it is expected that the impact strength and the<br>
like would be insufficient as compared with a single-stage<br>
product of narrower molecular weight distribution, further,<br>
it is inferred that a broad molecular weight distribution<br>
means heterogeneity of the active species, and consequently<br>
there is a concern that the composition distribution<br>
broadens, thereby resulting in deterioration of fatigue<br>
strength. Moreover, in some Examples of the abovementioned<br>
patent application, a single-stage polymerization<br>
product of small molecular weight and a single-stage<br>
polymerization product of large molecular weight arey meltkneaded.<br>
In this kneading method, crystalline structures<br>
that are continuous over more than 10 pun are often produced,<br>
and thus it is expected that sufficient strength would not<br>
be exhibited.<br>
In the publication of JP-A No. 2002-53615, disclosed<br>
is an ethylene polymer which is obtained by slurry<br>
polymerization using a catalyst system comprising<br>
methylalumoxane and a zirconium compound having a specific<br>
salicylaldimine ligand supported on silica. Although the<br>
claims of the patent application do not disclose the:<br>
preferred range of the carbon number of a-olefin that is<br>
to be copolymerized with ethylene, in regard to the<br>
ethylene polymer obtained from 1-butene (number of carbon<br>
atoms = 4) which is used as the a-olefin in Examples of<br>
the patent application, the carbon number is small, and it<br>
is envisaged that sufficient mechanical strength would not<br>
exhibited.<br>
In general, an ethylene polymer shows a multimodal<br>
molecular weight distribution. When the intermodal<br>
molecular weight differences are large, mixing with meltkneading<br>
is difficult, and thus multistage polymerization<br>
is typically employed. Multistage polymerization is in<br>
general often carried out in a continuous manner. In the<br>
case of such multistage polymerization, a distribution is<br>
usually created in the ratio between the residence time in<br>
a polymerization vessel which is under a polymerizing<br>
environment that would produce a low molecular weight<br>
product, and the residence time in a polymerization vessel<br>
which is under a polymerizing environment that would<br>
produce a high molecular weight product. In particular, in<br>
the case of a polymerization method in which the polymer is<br>
produced in a particulate form, such as the gas-phase<br>
method or slurry method, there may exist differences in the<br>
molecular weight among different particles. Such<br>
difference in molecular weight has been recognized even in<br>
the cases of using the Ziegler catalysts as described in<br>
the publication of Japanese Patent No. 821037 or the like.<br>
However, the catalyst is multi-sited, whereas the molecular<br>
weight distribution is broad. Accordingly, polymer<br>
particles are well mixed with each other even upon<br>
conventional pelletization by melt-kneading. On the other<br>
hand, in the case of using a singe-site catalyst, since the<br>
molecular weight distribution is narrow, the polymer<br>
particles are often not mixed sufficiently with each other<br>
during conventional pelletization by melt-kneading. Thus,<br>
in some cases, the history of polymer as having been in a<br>
particulate form was reflected in the mixture, and this<br>
caused disorder in the fluidity to adversely affect the<br>
appearance or sufficient exhibition of mechanical strength.<br>
Also, such ethylene polymer showed a tendency that the<br>
coefficient of smoothness which is determined from the<br>
surface roughness of extruded strands increased.<br>
The ethylene (co)polymer prepared using a Ziegler<br>
catalyst as described in Japanese Patent No. 821037 or the<br>
like has methyl branch groups in the molecular chain; as a<br>
result of side production of a methyl branch group during<br>
the polymerization reaction. It was found that this:methyl<br>
branch group was embedded in the crystal, thus weakening<br>
the crystal (see, for example, Polymer Vol.31, p.1999<br>
(1990)), and this caused deterioration in mechanical<br>
strength of the ethylene (co)polymer. Further, in regard<br>
to the copolymer of ethylene and a-olefin, when the<br>
copolymer contained almost no a-olefin, a tough and<br>
brittle component was produced; on the other hand, when an<br>
excessive proportion of a-olefin was used in<br>
copolymerization, a soft component with weak crystalline<br>
structure was produced, and thus it may cause tackiness.<br>
Moreover, since the molecular weight distribution was broad,<br>
there were problems such as the phenomenon of a low<br>
molecular weight product adhering to the surfaces of molded<br>
products as a powdery substance, and so on.<br>
The ethylene polymer that is obtained by<br>
polymerization using a metallocene catalyst as described in<br>
the publication of JP-A No. 9-183816 or the like has methyl<br>
branch groups in the molecular chain, as a result of side<br>
production of a methyl branch group during the<br>
polymerization reaction. This methyl branch group is<br>
embedded in the crystals, thereby weakening the crystalline<br>
structure. This has been a cause for the lowering of<br>
mechanical strength. Also, an ethylene polymer with<br>
extremely large molecular weight has not been disclosed<br>
heretofore.<br>
An ethylene polymer that is obtained by<br>
polymerization in the presence of a chromium-based catalyst<br>
exhibits low molecular extension because of the presence of<br>
a long-chained branch group, and thus has poor mechanical<br>
strength. Further, as a result of side production of a<br>
methyl branch group during the polymerization reaction,<br>
there exist methyl branch groups in the molecular chain.<br>
These methyl branch groups are embedded in the crystals and<br>
weaken the crystalline structure. This has been a cause<br>
for the lowering of mechanical strength. Further, in<br>
regard to the copolymer of ethylene and an a-olefin, when<br>
the copolymer contained almost no a-olefin, a tough and<br>
brittle product was produced; on the other hand, when aolefin<br>
was copolymerized in an excessive proportion,<br>
tackiness was caused or a soft component with weak<br>
crystalline structure was produced.<br>
The ethylene polymer that is obtained by<br>
polymerization in the presence of a constrained geometry<br>
catalyst (CGC) as described in the publication of WO<br>
93/08221 or the like has methyl branch groups in the<br>
molecular chain, as a result of side production of a: methyl<br>
branch group during the polymerization reaction. These<br>
methyl branch groups are embedded in the crystals and<br>
weaken the crystalline structure. This has been a cause<br>
for the lowering of mechanical strength. Further, the<br>
molecular extension was low because of the presence of<br>
long-chained branch groups, and thus the mechanical<br>
strength was insufficient.<br>
An ethylene polymer that is obtained by high pressure<br>
radical polymerization has methyl branch groups or longchained<br>
branch groups in the molecular chain, as a result<br>
of the side production of methyl branch groups or longchained<br>
branch groups during polymerization. These methyl<br>
branch groups are embedded in the crystals, thereby<br>
weakening the crystalline strength. This has been a cause<br>
for the lowering of mechanical strength. Further, the<br>
presence of long-chained branch groups resulted in l|ow<br>
molecular extension as well as a broad molecular weight<br>
distribution, and thus the mechanical strength was poor.<br>
In regard to the ethylene polymer that is obtained by<br>
cold polymerization using a catalyst containing Ta- or Nbcomplexes<br>
as described in the publication of JP-A No;. 6-<br>
233723, since the ratio (Mw/Mn) of the weight average<br>
molecular weight (Mw) and the number average molecular<br>
weight (Mn) as measured by GPC was small, the moldabitlity<br>
might be insufficient.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Hereinafter, the best modes to carry out the present<br>
invention will be described one after another, regarding<br>
the ethylene polymer (E), the ethylene polymer (EB) which<br>
is suitably used for blow molded products and the blow<br>
molded products prepared therefrom, and the ethylene<br>
polymer (Ep) which is suitably used in pipes and the pipes<br>
or fittings prepared therefrom. Next, a representative<br>
process for preparation of the ethylene polymer according<br>
to the invention and various methods for measurement<br>
according to the invention will be described, and finally<br>
Examples will be illustrated.<br>
Ethylene polymer (E)<br>
The ethylene polymer (E) according to the invention<br>
is an ethylene polymer which contains 0.01 to 1.20 mpl% of<br>
a constitutional unit derived from a-olefin having 6 to 10<br>
carbon atoms, and usually comprises homopolymers of<br>
ethylene and copolymers of ethylene/a-olefin having £ to<br>
10 carbon atoms.<br>
Herein, examples of a-olefin having 6 to 10 catbon<br>
atoms (hereinafter, may be simply abbreviated to "aolefin")<br>
include 1-hexene, 4-methyl-l-pentene, 3-metjiyl-lpentene,<br>
1-octene, 1-decene and the like. According to the<br>
invention, it is preferred to use at least one selected<br>
from 1-hexene, 4-methyl-l-pentene and 1-octene among such<br>
a-olefins.<br>
The ethylene polymer (E) according to the invention<br>
is characterized in that it satisfies either of the<br>
following requirements (1) and (2) with respect to cjross<br>
fractionation chromatography (CFC):<br>
(1) the weight average molecular weight (Mw) oil the<br>
components eluted at 73 to 76°C does not exceed 4,0010; and<br>
(2) the polymer satisfies the following relationship<br>
(Eq-1):<br>
Sx/Stotai 
wherein Sx is the sum of the total peak areas related<br>
to the components eluted at 70 to 85°C in CFC, and Stotai is<br>
the sum of the total peak areas related to the components<br>
eluted at 0 to 145°C.<br>
Such ethylene polymer (E) is excellent in Iong4term<br>
properties such as fatigue properties when applied tp<br>
molded products. Next/ the requirements (1) and (2) will<br>
be explained in detail.<br>
[Requirement (1)]<br>
As for the ethylene polymer (E) according to the<br>
invention, the weight average molecular weight (Mw) 0f the<br>
components that are eluted at 73 to 76°C in cross<br>
fractionation chromatography (CFC), as measured by GiPC,<br>
does not exceed 4,000. More specifically, the weight<br>
average molecular weight (Mw) in association with the GPC<br>
peaks detected in the region for molecular weight of 108 or<br>
less does not exceed 4,000. The weight average molecular<br>
weight (Mw) is preferably in the range of 2,000 to 4,000,<br>
and more preferably in the range of 2,500 to 3,500. It is<br>
meant by such ethylene polymer that the content of the high<br>
molecular weight components having a copolymerized af<br>
olefin is small, or that the polymer does not contain any<br>
of such components which have relatively small molecular<br>
weights and also have a short-chained branch group. In<br>
this case, a product molded therefrom is excellent in longterm<br>
properties such as fatigue strength. The ethylene-ocolefin<br>
copolymer as described in the publication of JP-A No,<br>
11-106432 has a wide composition distribution and thus does<br>
not satisfy the above-mentioned scope. The ethylene<br>
polymer as described in the publication of WO 01/25328 does<br>
not satisfy the above-mentioned scope because even a<br>
component with relatively small molecular weight also has a<br>
short-chained branch group resulting from copolymerijzation<br>
with an a-olefin. The ethylene polymers of prior art<br>
prepared in the presence of a Ziegler catalyst or a<br>
chromium catalyst also have wide composition distributions<br>
and thus do not satisfy the above-mentioned scope.<br>
By setting the polymerization conditions as described<br>
later and using a catalyst system as described later, an<br>
ethylene polymer falling within this scope can be prepared.<br>
Specifically, when polymerization is carried out undbr the<br>
conditions as described in Example 3 of the inventiop, the<br>
weight average molecular weight (Mw) of the components<br>
which are eluted at 73 to 76°C in temperature rising<br>
elution fractionation using a cross fractionation<br>
chromatography (CFC) apparatus is 2,900. Further, ai long<br>
as the catalyst or the polymerization temperature is not<br>
changed, also as long as a-olefin is not supplied to the<br>
first polymerization vessel, and also as long as the aolefin<br>
supplied to the second polymerization vessel in<br>
this case, 1-hexene) is supplied at a rate no more than 900<br>
g/hr, the above-mentioned weight average molecular weight<br>
(Mw) becomes less than 4,000.<br>
[Requirement (2) ]<br>
The ethylene polymer (E) according to the invention<br>
satisfies the relationship as represented by the following<br>
equation (Eq-1):<br>
Sx/Stotai 
wherein Sx represents the sum of the total peak areas<br>
related to the components which are eluted at 70 to 5°C,<br>
and Stotai represents the sum of the total peak areas<br>
related to the components which are eluted at 0 to 145°C,<br>
in cross fractionation chromatography (CFC).<br>
As it has been explained for the terms in Requirement<br>
(1), it is meant by such ethylene polymer which satisfies<br>
Requirement (2), that the content of the high molecular<br>
weight components having a copolymerized a-olefin is small,<br>
or that the polymer does not contain any of such components<br>
which have relatively small molecular weights and also have<br>
a short-chained branch group. In this case, a product<br>
molded therefrom is excellent in long-term propertied such<br>
as fatigue strength and the like. The ethylene-a-olfin<br>
copolymer as described in the publication of JP-A Noj. 11-<br>
i<br>
106432 does not satisfy the relationship of the abovementioned<br>
equation (Eq-1) because of its wide composition<br>
distribution. The ethylene polymer as described in the<br>
publication of WO 01/25328 does not satisfy the<br>
relationship of the above equation (Eq-1) because ev£n a<br>
component with relatively small molecular weight alsp has a<br>
short-chained branch group resulting from copolymerifcation<br>
with an a-olefin. The ethylene polymers of prior art<br>
prepared in the presence of a Ziegler catalyst or a<br>
chromium catalyst also have wide composition distributions<br>
and thus do not satisfy the relationship of the above<br>
equation (Eq-1) . In addition, since Sx and Stotai in the<br>
above equation (Eq-1) represent the values based on the<br>
infrared analysis of elastic oscillation of the C-H bond,<br>
the value of Sx/Stotai is in principle identical with the<br>
percentage by weight occupied by the components eluted at<br>
70 to 85°C in the components eluted at 0 to 145°C.<br>
Typically, as for the ethylene polymer of the invention,<br>
since all of the components are eluted off by scanning in<br>
the region of 0 to 145°C, the value of Sx/Stotai can b£<br>
otherwise said to be the percentage by weight occupied by<br>
the amount of the components eluted at 70 to 85°C in the<br>
unit weight of the ethylene polymer.<br>
An ethylene polymer falling within this scope dan be<br>
prepared by setting the polymerization conditions as<br>
described later and using a catalyst system as described<br>
later. Specifically, when polymerization is carried out<br>
under the conditions as described in Example 3 of the<br>
invention, the value of the left-hand side of equation (Eq-<br>
1) with respect to cross fractionation chromatographt (CFC)<br>
of the ethylene polymer obtained therefrom, namely,<br>
/ is 0.042. Further, as long as the cataly$t or<br>
the polymerization temperature is not changed, also as long<br>
as a-olefin is not supplied to the first polymerization<br>
vessel, and also as long as the a-olefin supplied to the<br>
second polymerization vessel (in this case, 1-hexene) is<br>
supplied at a rate no more than 900 g/hr, the value for<br>
(Sx/Stotai) satisfies the above relationship (Eq-1) .<br>
A more preferred form of the above-mentioned etthylene<br>
polymer (E) is ethylene polymer (E?) which satisfies the<br>
following requirements (I1) to (V):<br>
(I1) it contains 0.02 to 1.00 mol% of a<br>
constitutional unit derived from a-olefin having 6 to 10<br>
carbon atoms;<br>
(2!) the density (d) is in the range of 945 to 970<br>
kg/m3;<br>
(3') the intrinsic viscosity ([r\]) as measured in<br>
decalin at 135°C is in the range of 1.6 to 4.0 (dl/g);<br>
(4!) the ratio (Mw/Mn) of the weight average<br>
molecular weight (Mw) and the number average molecular<br>
weight (Mn) as measured by GPC is in the range of 5 to 70;<br>
(51) with respect to cross fractionation<br>
chromatography (CFC), when the elution temperature f<br the>
apex of the strongest peak in the region corresponding to<br>
molecular weights of less than 100,000 is taken as T1 (°C),<br>
and the elution temperature for the apex of the strongest<br>
peak in the region corresponding to molecular weights of<br>
100,000 or more is taken as T2 (°C), (Tx - T2) (°C) i$ in<br>
the range of 0 to 11°C;<br>
(6f) with respect to cross fractionation<br>
chromatography (CFC), the molecular weight for the aex of<br>
the strongest peak in the region corresponding to molecular<br>
weights of 100,000 or more is in the range of 200,000 to<br>
800,000 on the GPC curve for the fraction eluted at ((T2-l)<br>
to T2]) (°C); and<br>
(71) on the GPC curve for the fraction eluted $t<br>
[(T2-l) to T2]) (°C), the molecular weight at the apex of<br>
the strongest peak in the region corresponding to molecular<br>
weights of 100,000 or less does not exceed 28.000 in the<br>
GPC curve for the components eluted at 95 to 96°C.<br>
Hereinafter, requirements (I1) to (71) will be<br>
explained specifically in succession.<br>
[Requirement (1')]<br>
The ethylene polymer (E1) according to the invention<br>
typically contains 0.02 to 1.00 mol% of a constitutional<br>
unit derived from a-olefin having 6 to 10 carbon atoins.<br>
When ethylene polymer (E1) does not include homopolytners of<br>
ethylene, that is, when the polymer includes only<br>
copolymers of ethylene and a-olefin having 6 to 10 carbon<br>
atoms, the constitutional unit derived from ethylene is<br>
preferably present in a proportion of usually from 90 to<br>
99.98 mol%, preferably from 99.5 to 99.98 mol%, and more<br>
preferably from 99.6 to 99.98 mol%, and the repeating unit<br>
derived from the a-olefin is preferably present in a<br>
proportion of usually from 0.02 to 1 mol%, preferably from<br>
0.02 to 0.5 mol%, and more preferably from 0.02 to Oit4 mol%.<br>
Further, the ethylene polymer (E1) may also include<br>
ethylene homopolymers, and in this case, the constitutional<br>
unit derived from ethylene in the ethylene•a-olefin<br>
copolymer part is preferably present in a proportion of<br>
usually from 95 to 99.96 mol%, preferably from 97.5 to<br>
99.96 mol%, and more preferably from 98 to 99.96 molfc, and<br>
the repeating unit derived from the a-olefin is preferably<br>
present in a proportion of usually from 0.04 to 5 moL%,<br>
preferably from 0.04 to 2.5 mol%, and more preferably from<br>
0.04 to 2.0 mol%. In addition, even in the case of<br>
ethylene homopolymers being included, the repeating unit<br>
derived from the a-olefin occupies a proportion of usually<br>
from 0.02 to 1 mol%, preferably from 0.02 to 0.5 mol%, and<br>
more preferably from 0.02 to 0.4 mol% of the whole polymer.<br>
When the a-olefin has 5 or less carbon atoms, the<br>
probability of the a-olefin being incorporated into the<br>
crystals increases (see Polymer, Vol.31, p.1999 (1990)),<br>
and consequently the strength is weakened, which is not<br>
desirable. When the a-olefin has more than 10 carbon atoms,<br>
the activation energy for fluidity becomes larger, and<br>
there occurs a large change in viscosity during molding,<br>
which is not desirable. Also, when the a-olefin has more<br>
than 10 carbon atoms, the side chain (the branch group<br>
originating from the a-olefin copolymerized with ethylene)<br>
may sometimes undergo crystallization, thereby resulting in<br>
weakening of the non-crystalline part, which is not<br>
desirable.<br>
[Requirement (2') and Requirement (3')]<br>
The density (d) of ethylene polymer (E1) according to<br>
the invention is in the range of 945 to 970 kg/m3,<br>
preferably from 947 to 969 kg/m3, and more preferably from<br>
950 to 969 kg/m3, and the intrinsic viscosity ( [r|]) thereof<br>
as measured in decalin at 135°C is in the range of lj.6 to<br>
4.0 dl/g, preferably from 1.7 to 3.8 dl/g, and more<br>
preferably from 1.8 to 3.7 dl/g. The ethylene polymer<br>
having its density and intrinsic viscosity within these<br>
ranges is well balanced between hardness and moldabi|lity.<br>
For example, by changing the ratio of the amounts of<br>
hydrogen, ethylene and a-olefin fed to the polymerization<br>
vessel, the ratio between the polymerization amounts of<br>
ethylene homopolymer and of ethylene-a-olefin copolypier,<br>
or the like, the values of density and intrinsic visbosity<br>
can be increased or decreased within the above-mentioned<br>
numerical ranges. Specifically, in the slurry<br>
polymerization of Example 3 using hexane as the solvent,<br>
when polymerization is carried out under stirring to render<br>
the system homogeneous, the density and [T^] become 953<br>
kg/m3 and 3.10 dl/g, respectively; when ethylene, hydrogen<br>
and 1-hexene are fed to the second polymerization vessel at<br>
the rates of 6.0 kg/hr, 0.45 N-liter/hr and 300 g/hrr<br>
respectively, the density and [TI] become 944 kg/m3 and 3.6<br>
dl/g, respectively; and when ethylene and hydrogen are fed<br>
to the first polymerization vessel at the rates of 7.0<br>
kg/hr and 125 N-liters/hr, respectively, and when ethylene,<br>
hydrogen and 1-hexene are fed to the second polymerisation<br>
vessel at the rates of 3.0 kg/hr, 0.07 N-liter/hr, and 30<br>
g/hr, respectively, the density and [t|] become 968 kg/m3<br>
and 2.10 dl/g, respectively.<br>
[Requirement (4')]<br>
The ethylene polymer (E1) according to the invention<br>
has the ratio Mw/Mn (Mw: weight average molecular wefLght,<br>
Mn: number average molecular weight) as measured by gel<br>
permeation chromatography (GPC), in the range of usually<br>
from 5 to 70, and preferably from 5 to 50. When multistage<br>
polymerization as described later is carried out usihg a<br>
catalyst system as described later, an ethylene polymer<br>
falling within this scope can be prepared by controlling<br>
the molecular weights of the respective components and the<br>
ratio of polymerization amounts.<br>
For example, Mw/Mn can be increased by increasing the<br>
differences between the molecular weights of the respective<br>
components. The polymer having Mw/Mn within the aboV'ementioned<br>
ranges is well balanced between the mechanical<br>
strength and moldability. Specifically, when<br>
polymerization is carried out under the conditions a£<br>
described in Example 3 of the invention, Mw/Mn is 14,8.<br>
Here, when the amount of ethylene fed to the first<br>
polymerization vessel is changed from 5.0 kg/hr to 710<br>
kg/hr, and that of hydrogen is changed from 57 N-litrs/hr<br>
to 125 N-liters/hr, the molecular weight of the ethylene<br>
polymer produced in the first polymerization vessel<br>
decreases, and thus Mw/Mn becomes about 18. On the other<br>
hand, when the amount of ethylene fed to the second<br>
polymerization vessel is changed from 4.0 kg/hr to 3.3<br>
kg/hr, and that of hydrogen is changed from 0.2 N-liter/hr<br>
to 0.07 N-liter/hr, the molecular weight of the ethylene<br>
polymer produced in the second polymerization-vessel<br>
increases, and thus Mw/Mn becomes about 22. Or else, when<br>
hydrogen is fed to the first polymerization vessel at 52 Nliters/<br>
hr, and ethylene, hydrogen and 1-hexene are fed to<br>
the second polymerization vessel at 6.0 kg/hr, 0.45 Nliter/<br>
hr and 200 g/hr, respectively, Mw/Mn becomes about 12<br>
[Requirement (5')]<br>
In temperature rising elution fractionation of the<br>
ethylene polymer according to the invention using a cross<br>
fractionation chromatography (CFC) apparatus, when the<br>
elution temperature for the apex of the strongest peak in<br>
the region corresponding to molecular weights of less than<br>
100,000 is taken as TI (°C), and the elution temperature<br>
for the apex of the strongest peak in the region<br>
corresponding to molecular weights of 100,000 or more is<br>
taken as T2 (°C), (Ti - T2) (°C) is in the range of 0 to<br>
11°C, preferably in the range of 0 to 10°C, and more<br>
preferably in the range of 0 to 9°C. In addition, in the<br>
CFC analysis according to the invention, the term "peak" as<br>
explained with reference to, for example, Fig.2, indicates<br>
the distribution (chromatogram) of the solute, that is, the<br>
entire peak form; the term "the strongest (or the peak<br>
intensity is the strongest)" means that the height of the<br>
peak is the highest; and the term "apex of the peak" means<br>
the point where the differential value becomes zero (i.e.,<br>
the top of the peak). Furthermore, if the peak does not<br>
have an apex/ it indicates the portion where the<br>
differential value is closest to zero (i.e., shoulder).<br>
; j Such ethylene polymer can be prepared to fall Within<br>
the above-mentioned scope by setting the polymerization<br>
conditions as described later and using a catalyst system<br>
as described later.<br>
The value of (Ti - T2) can be increased or decreased<br>
within these ranges, by increasing or decreasing the amount<br>
of the copolymerized a-olefin within a specific range.<br>
Specifically, when polymerization is carried out under the<br>
conditions as described in Example 3, there exist two peaks<br>
with different molecular weights in temperature rising<br>
elution fractionation using a cross fractionation<br>
chromatography (CFC) apparatus, and the temperature<br>
difference (Ti - T2) (°C) between the temperature (Ti) for<br>
the peak with the strongest peak intensity in the region<br>
corresponding to the eluted components having molecular<br>
weights of less than 100,000, and the temperature (T2) for<br>
the peak with the strongest peak intensity in the region<br>
corresponding to the eluted components having molecular<br>
weights of 100,000 or more, becomes 6°C. When the aminunt<br>
of 1-hexene fed to the second polymerization vessel is<br>
- 32 -<br>
changed from 130'g/hr to 50 g/hr, (Ti - T2) (°C) becomes<br>
1°C, and when the same is changed to 200 g/hr, (T1 - T2)<br>
(°C) becomes 11°c.<br>
[Requirement (61)]<br>
In cross fractionation chromatography (CFC) of<br>
ethylene polymer (E1) according to the invention, on the<br>
GPC curve for the fraction eluted at the above-mentioned<br>
T2(°C), the molecular weight for the apex of the strongest<br>
peak in the region corresponding to molecular weights of<br>
100,000 or more is in the range of from 200,000 to 800,000.<br>
In addition, the fraction eluted at T2(°C) indicates the<br>
fraction of the components eluted at [ (T2 - 1) to T2] (°C) .<br>
Such ethylene polymer is well balanced between the longterm<br>
properties such as fatigue property and the like and<br>
moldability. An ethylene polymer falling within this scope<br>
can be prepared by setting the polymerization conditions as<br>
described later and using a catalyst system as described<br>
later. By means of increases or decreases in the amounts<br>
of the ct-olefin, hydrogen, ethylene and the like supplied<br>
to a polymerization environment which would result in the<br>
preparation of a copolymer, the molecular weight for;the<br>
apex of the peak corresponding to the highest molecular<br>
weight on the GPC curve for the fraction eluted at T2 (°C),<br>
can be increased or decreased within a specific range.<br>
Specifically speaking, when polymerization is carried out<br>
under the conditions as described in Example 3, in the GPC<br>
curve for the above-mentioned fraction eluted at [ (T2. - 1)<br>
to Ta] (°C) in temperature rising elution fractionation<br>
using a cross fractionation chromatography (CFC) apparatus,<br>
the molecular weight for the apex of the strongest peak in<br>
the region corresponding to molecular weights of 100/000 or<br>
more is 493,000. When the amount of 1-hexene fed to the<br>
second polymerization vessel is changed from 130 g/hr to<br>
200 g/hr, that of ethylene is changed from 4.0 kg/hr to 6.0<br>
kg/hr, and that of hydrogen is changed from 0.2 N-lit;er/hr<br>
to 0.45 N-liter/hr, the molecular weight for the apeX of<br>
the strongest peak in the region corresponding to molecular<br>
weights of 100,000 or more in the GPC curve for the abovementioned<br>
fraction eluted at [(T2 - 1) to T2] (°C) in<br>
temperature rising elution fractionation using a cross<br>
fractionation chromatography (CFC) apparatus, becomes<br>
361,000. When the amount of hydrogen fed to the second<br>
polymerization vessel is changed from 0.2 N-liter/hr to 0.1<br>
N-liter/hr, the molecular weight for the apex of the peak<br>
corresponding to the highest molecular weight in the iGPC<br>
|<br>
curve for the above-mentioned fraction eluted at [ (T2 - 1)<br>
to TZ] (°C) in temperature rising elution fractionation<br>
using a cross fractionation chromatography (CFC) apparatus,<br>
becomes 680,000. With those metallocene catalysts<br>
conventionally known, it has been impossible to obtain an<br>
ethylene copolymer having a narrow molecular weight<br>
distribution and such high molecular weight.<br>
[Requirement (7')]<br>
In the GPC curve for the components of the ethylene<br>
polymer according to the invention, which are eluted at 95<br>
to 96°C in cross fractionation chromatography (CFC), the<br>
molecular weight for the apex of the strongest peak does<br>
not exceed 28,000. It is usually in the range of 15,000 to<br>
27,000. It is meant by such ethylene polymer that it does .<br>
not contain any of such components which have low molecular<br>
weights and also have a short-chained branch group, and in<br>
this case, the polymer is excellent in long-term properties<br>
such as fatigue strength.<br>
Such ethylene polymer falling within this scope can<br>
be prepared by setting the polymerization conditions as<br>
described later and using a catalyst system as described<br>
later. Specifically speaking, when polymerization is<br>
carried out under the conditions as described in Example 3,<br>
the molecular weight for the apex of the strongest peak in<br>
the GPC curve for the components eluted at 95 to 96 °C in<br>
temperature rising elution fractionation using a cross<br>
fractionation chromatography (CFC) apparatus, is 22,000.<br>
Further, as long as the catalyst or the polymerization<br>
temperature is not changed, also as long as a-olefin is<br>
not supplied to the first polymerization vessel, and also<br>
as long as the amount of hydrogen supplied to the second<br>
polymerization is not set to 10 N-liters/hr or more, Mw<br>
lies within this range. When a branch group is present<br>
even in a low molecular weight component as described in WO<br>
01/25328, since the crystallinity of the low molecular<br>
weight component is deteriorated, components having larger<br>
molecular weights are eluted off even at the same elution<br>
temperature, thus the requirement being not satisfied.<br>
A more preferred form of the above-mentioned ethylene<br>
polymer (E1) is ethylene polymer (E") in which less than<br>
0.1, preferably less than 0.08, methyl branch group as<br>
measured by 13C-NMR is present per 1000 carbon atoms. Since<br>
such polymer has a strong crystalline structure, the<br>
mechanical strength is excellent. As for the ethylene<br>
polymer prepared by using a catalyst system as illustrated<br>
below, the methyl branch group is not detected because the<br>
quantity of the group is beyond the detection limit (0.08<br>
per 1000 carbon atoms).<br>
A particularly preferred form of ethylene polymer<br>
(E") as described above is the ethylene copolymer (E1 1 1 )<br>
which satisfies the following requirements (I'11) and<br>
(21 1 1 ) simultaneously:<br>
(I1 1 1 ) when the GPC curve is divided into two<br>
logarithmic normal distribution curves, the ratio (Mw/Mn)<br>
of the weight average molecular weight (Mw) and the number<br>
average molecular weight (Mn) for each divided curve is in<br>
the range of 1.5 to 3.5, and the weight average molecular<br>
weight for the divided representing the high molecular<br>
weight side (Mw2) is from 200,000 to 800,000; and<br>
(2f'r) the smoothness coefficient R as determined<br>
from the surface roughness of an extruded strand does not<br>
exceed 20 (Jin.<br>
Hereinafter, the requirements (I1 1 1 ) and (2II!) will<br>
be specifically explained.<br>
[Requirement (I111)]<br>
As for the ethylene polymer (E111) according to the<br>
invention, when the molecular weight curve (GPC curve)<br>
measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) is divided<br>
into two logarithmic normal distribution curves, the weight<br>
average molecular weight (Mw)/number average molecular<br>
weight (Mn) for each divided curve is in the range of<br>
usually from 1.5 to 3.5, and preferably from 1.5 to 3.2.<br>
An ethylene polymer falling within this scope can be<br>
prepared by performing multistage polymerization as<br>
described later using a catalyst system as described plater,<br>
and by controlling the type of the catalyst compound, the<br>
number of stages required for the multistage polymerization<br>
process, and the molecular weights of the respective<br>
components, which are selected for the process. It is<br>
possible to obtain a large value for Mw/Mn when<br>
polymerization is carried out in a gas phase, whereas it is<br>
possible to obtain a small value for Mw/Mn when<br>
polymerization is carried out in'a slurry phase, because<br>
heat removal or monomer diffusion occurs more uniformly.<br>
Moreover, when a catalyst component is used without being<br>
supported on a carrier, the system approaches closely to a<br>
homogeneous system, and therefore the Mw/Mn becomes smaller.<br>
When slurry polymerization is carried out using a supported,<br>
geometric constraint type single-site catalyst (CGC/Borate)<br>
as described in the publication of JP-A No. 11-106432, or<br>
when slurry polymerization is carried out using a catalyst<br>
system comprising methylalumoxane and ethylene-bis(4,5,6,7-<br>
tetrahydro-1-indenyl) zirconium chloride supported on<br>
silica as described in the publication of EP 1201711 Al,<br>
the Mw/Mn for single-stage polymerization becomes 4 or more,<br>
thus the products not satisfying the claimed scope of the<br>
invention. Moreover, the Mw/Mn of the ethylene polymer<br>
that can be obtained by single stage slurry polymerization<br>
at 80°C using the catalyst described in Example 1 of the<br>
invention, is approximately 2.3.<br>
Furthermore, when the GPC curve for ethylene polymer<br>
(E111) according to the invention is divided into two<br>
logarithmic normal distribution curves, the weight average<br>
molecular weight (Mwa) for the divided curve representing<br>
the high molecular weight side is in the range of 200,000<br>
to 800,000. An ethylene polymer with its Mwa falling<br>
within the above-mentioned range can be prepared by<br>
appropriately selecting the proportions of hydrogen,<br>
ethylene and a-olefin used in the preparation of ethylene<br>
polymer. Specifically speaking, when polymerization is<br>
carried out under the conditions as described in Example 3,<br>
the weight average molecular weight (Mw2) for the divided<br>
curve representing the high molecular weight side upon<br>
division of the GPC curve into two logarithmic normal<br>
distribution curves, becomes 416,000. When ethylene,<br>
hydrogen and 1-hexene are fed to the second polymerization<br>
vessel at the rates of 6.0 kg/hr, 0.35 N-liter/hr, and 200<br>
g/hr, respectively, MW2 becomes 312,000; and when ethylene<br>
and hydrogen are fed to the second polymerization vessel at<br>
the rates of 3.0 kg/hr and 0.07 N-liter/hr, respectively,<br>
and 1-hexene is fed to the second polymerization vessel at<br>
the rate of 30 g/hr, Mw2 becomes 539,000. The ethylene<br>
polymer having its Mwa within this range is well balanced<br>
between the strength and moldability.<br>
[Requirement (2' ' ')]<br>
As for the ethylene polymer (E'lf) according to the<br>
invention, the smoothness coefficient R as determined from<br>
the surface roughness of an extruded strand does not exceed<br>
20 |im, and preferably 15 urn. When the ethylene polymer<br>
obtained by polymerization such as gas phase polymerization<br>
or slurry polymerization is in a particulate form, the<br>
polymer particles may not be intermixed and dispersed<br>
completely even after being subjected to post-treatment<br>
such as melt-kneading and the like, and there may remain<br>
portions with different viscosities looking like mottles.<br>
In this case, when the molten resin is extruded to a shape<br>
of tube or strand, the surface would have rough skin. In<br>
such case, a product molded therefrom would also have<br>
similar rough skin. The extent can be determined from the<br>
smoothness coefficient R as determined by the measurement<br>
of surface roughness. In general, the size of an ethylene<br>
polymer particle prepared by gas phase polymerization or<br>
slurry polymerization is about a few tens of micrometers to<br>
2 millimeters. When the morphological history of the<br>
polymer particle lingers on, the surface of an extruded<br>
product would have rough skin, resulting in the R value to<br>
increase to over 20 pm, and for example, when a<br>
polymerization method as described later is selected, an<br>
ethylene polymer having an R value not exceeding 20 nm, and<br>
usually not exceeding 15 |^m, can be prepared. If R does<br>
not exceed 20 urn, a fluctuation in the range of 0 to 20 urn<br>
may occur due to incorporation of foreign substances or<br>
scratches in the die upon film formation, measurement error<br>
or the like, regardless of the essential nature. Therefore,<br>
it is meaningful only when R does not exceed 20 μm. In<br>
regard to an ethylene polymer having an R value which would<br>
exceed 20 μm, for example, when the ethylene polymer powder<br>
obtained in Example 3 is melt-kneaded at 190°C and 25 rpm<br>
for a very long time such as 15 minutes or the like using a<br>
Labo-Plastmil (a batch-type counter rotating twin screw<br>
kneader) manufactured by Toyo Seiki Seisakusho, Ltd., an<br>
ethylene polymer having an R less than 20 μm can be<br>
obtained. It is possible to make R smaller by lengthening<br>
the time for kneading, but this may cause structural<br>
changes that are associated with decomposition or<br>
crosslinking. Further, when an ethylene polymer having an<br>
R which would exceed 20 μm is dissolved in a good solvent<br>
such as para-xylene to a proportion of about 5 g to 500 ml<br>
of the solvent, subsequently precipitated in a poor solvent,<br>
such as ice-cooled acetone, of a volume five times the<br>
solution volume at a rate of about 10 ml/min, and then<br>
dried and melt-kneaded, an ethylene polymer having an R<br>
value 10 μm or less can be obtained. Since a polymer<br>
having an R that does not exceed the above-mentioned value<br>
is homogeneous without reflectance of the polymer history<br>
as particle, the mechanical strength is particularly<br>
excellent, and fluidity becomes uniform. Thus, the surface<br>
of a molded product becomes smooth with excellent<br>
appearance. As shown in Example 1 of the invention, when<br>
batch-type two-stage polymerization is carried out, R does<br>
not exceed 20 μm, even without performing melt-kneading for<br>
a long time. Furthermore, when an ethylene polymer which<br>
is obtained by withdrawing an ethylene homopolymer from a<br>
first polymerization vessel and subjecting it to singlestage<br>
slurry polymerization under the conditions of a<br>
separate second polymerization vessel, among the ethylene<br>
polymers obtainable by Example 3, is melt-kneaded, an<br>
ethylene polymer with its R not exceeding 20 |im may be<br>
obtained.<br>
Ethylene polymers (E), (E1), (E") and (E'1)<br>
according to the invention are characterized in that when a<br>
Microtome slice of a 0.5 mm-thick pressed sheet of one of<br>
the polymers obtained after melting at 190°C and cooling at<br>
20°C is observed under a polarized microscope, a<br>
crystalline structure continuous over more than 10 μrn is<br>
not observed.<br>
Specifically speaking, when a Microtome slice of a<br>
0.5 mm-thick pressed sheet obtained by melting at 190°C and<br>
cooling at 20°C is observed by polarized microscopy, a<br>
crystalline structure continuous over more than 10 μm. is<br>
not observed. Such ethylene polymer has excellent<br>
mechanical strength. For example, when the ethylene<br>
polymer powder obtained in Example 3 is melt-kneaded using<br>
a Labo-Plastmil (a batch-type counter rotating twin screw<br>
kneader) manufactured by Toyo Seiki Seisakusho, Ltd., at<br>
190°C and 25 rpm for a long time to some extent such as 10<br>
minutes or more, or the like, an ethylene polymer in which<br>
a crystalline structure continuous over more than 10 μm is<br>
not observed can be obtained. Also, as described in<br>
Example 1, when batch-type two-stage polymerization is<br>
carried out, an ethylene polymer in which a crystalline<br>
structure continuous over more than 10 μm is not observed<br>
can be obtained only with melt-kneading for a very short<br>
time. On the other hand, when an ethylene polymer which is<br>
obtained by withdrawing an ethylene homopolymer from a<br>
first polymerization vessel and subjecting it to singlestage<br>
slurry polymerization under the conditions of a<br>
separate second polymerization vessel, among the ethylene<br>
polymers obtainable by Example 3, is melt-kneaded, even<br>
though the kneading time is extended, a crystalline<br>
structure continuous over more than 10 μm is observed.<br>
In addition, the polymerization process to obtain<br>
ethylene polymers (E) to (E'If) of the invention is<br>
preferably carried out in the slurry phase or in the gas<br>
phase. When polymerization, preferably multistage<br>
polymerization, is carried out in the slurry phase or gas<br>
phase, two ethylene polymers with significantly different<br>
molecular weights are intermixed in the order of primary<br>
particles (nanometer order), which correspond to a single<br>
active site of catalyst, during polymerization, and thus it<br>
is desirable.<br>
Ethylene polymer (EB) suitably used in blow molded<br>
products<br>
Among the ethylene polymers (E), preferably (E1),<br>
more preferably (E"), and particularly preferably (E1'1),<br>
according to the invention, the ethylene polymer (EB) which<br>
is suitably used in blow molded products is preferably<br>
defined as in the following (1B) , (2B) and (3B), in terms of<br>
the concentration of the constitutional unit derived from<br>
a-olefin having 6 to 10 carbon atoms, of the value of<br>
Mw/Mn, and of the value of (Ti - T2) with respect to cross<br>
fractionation chromatography (CFC), respectively:<br>
(1B) the polymer contains 0.02 to 0.20 mol% of a<br>
constitutional unit derived from a-olefin having 6 to 10<br>
carbon atoms;<br>
(2B) the ratio (Mw/Mn) of the weight average<br>
molecular weight (Mw) and the number average molecular<br>
weight (Mn) as measured by GPC is in the range of 5 to 30;<br>
and<br>
(3B) with respect to cross fractionation<br>
chromatography (CFC), when the elution temperature for the<br>
apex of the strongest peak in the region corresponding to<br>
molecular weights of less than 100,000 is taken as TI (°C),<br>
and the elution temperature for the apex of the strongest<br>
peak in the region corresponding to molecular weights of<br>
100,000 or more is taken as T2 (°C), (Ti - T2) (°C) is in<br>
the range of 0 to 5°C.<br>
Hereinafter, supplementary explanation on requirement<br>
(1B) and requirement (3B) will be given.<br>
[Requirement (1B) ]<br>
The ethylene polymer (EB) according to the invention<br>
which is suitably used in blow molded products usually<br>
contains 0.02 to 0.2 mol% of a constitutional unit derived<br>
from a-olefin having 6 to 10 carbon atoms. When ethylene<br>
polymer (EB) of the invention does not include ethylene<br>
homopolymers, that is, when the polymer consists only of<br>
copolymers of ethylene and a-olefin having 6 to 10 carbon<br>
atoms, it is desirable that the constitutional unit derived<br>
from ethylene is present typically in a proportion of 99.80<br>
to 99.98 mol%, and the repeating unit derived from the <xolefin></xolefin>
is present typically in a proportion of 0.02 to 0.20<br>
mol%. Further, the ethylene polymer (EB) may occasionally<br>
include ethylene homopolymers, and in this case, it is<br>
desirable that the constitutional unit derived from<br>
ethylene in the ethylene-a-olefin copolymer part is<br>
present typically in a proportion of 99.00 to 99.96 mol%,<br>
and the repeating unit derived from the a-olefin is<br>
present in a proportion of 0.04 to 1.00 mol%. In addition,<br>
even in the case of including ethylene homopolymers, the<br>
repeating unit derived from the a-olefin normally occupies<br>
0.02 to 0.20 mol% of the whole polymer.<br>
[Requirement (3B) ]<br>
The ethylene polymer (EB) according to the invention<br>
which is suitably used in blow molded products is such that<br>
in temperature rising elution fractionation using a cross<br>
fractionation chromatography (CFC) apparatus, when the<br>
elution temperature for the apex of the strongest peak in<br>
the region corresponding to molecular weights of less than<br>
100,000 is taken as TI (°C), and the elution temperature<br>
for the apex of the strongest peak in the region<br>
corresponding to molecular weights of 100,000 or more is<br>
taken as T2 (°C), (Ti - T2) (°C) is in the range of 0 to 5°C,<br>
preferably from 0 to 4°C, and more preferably from 0 to 3°C.<br>
Here, the term apex of the strongest peak refers to the<br>
part where the differential value is zero (i.e., the top of<br>
the peak), and when there is no apex in the peak, the term<br>
refers to the part where the differential value is closest<br>
to zero (i.e., shoulder part). Such ethylene polymer has<br>
high toughness as well as excellent environmental stress<br>
crack resistance and the like. An ethylene polymer falling<br>
in this scope can be prepared by setting the polymerization<br>
conditions as described later and using a catalyst system<br>
as described later. (Ti - T2) can be increased or decreased<br>
within the above-mentioned ranges by increasing or<br>
decreasing the amount of the copolymerized a-olefin in a<br>
specific range. Specifically, when polymerization is<br>
carried out under the conditions as described in Example 14<br>
using hexane as the solvent, there exist two peaks with<br>
different molecular weights in temperature rising elution<br>
fractionation using a cross fractionation chromatography<br>
(CFC) apparatus, and the temperature difference (Ti - T2)<br>
(°C) between the temperature (Ti) for the peak with the<br>
strongest peak intensity in the region representing the<br>
eluted components with molecular weights of less than<br>
100,000, and the temperature (T2) for the peak with the<br>
strongest peak intensity in the region representing the<br>
eluted components with molecular weights of 100,000 or more,<br>
becomes 1°C. When the amount of 1-hexene fed to the second<br>
polymerization vessel is changed from 50 g/hr to 130 g/hr,<br>
(Ti - T2) (°C) can be adjusted to 5°C.<br>
The ethylene polymer (EB) according to the invention<br>
preferably satisfies, in addition to the above-mentioned<br>
requirements (1B) to (3B), the following requirements (1B')<br>
and (2B') [this ethylene polymer may be referred to as an<br>
ethylene polymer {EB')J/ and more preferably satisfies the<br>
following requirement Us") [this ethylene polymer may be<br>
referred to as an ethylene polymer (EB")]:<br>
(1B') the flexural modulus as measured at 23°C<br>
according to ASTM-D-790 is in the range of 1,500 to 1,800<br>
MPa;<br>
(2B') the environmental stress crack resistance ESCR<br>
(hr) at 50°C as measured according to ASTM-D-1693 is 10<br>
hours or longer before failure; and<br>
 (1B") tan 8 (= loss modulus G"/storage modulus G') as<br>
measured at 190°C and at an angular frequency of 100<br>
rad/sec using a dynamic viscoelecticity measuring apparatus,<br>
is from 0.7 to 0.9.<br>
Hereinafter, requirements (1B'), (2B') and (1B") will<br>
be described in detail.<br>
[Requirements (1B') and (2B')1<br>
The ethylene polymer (EB<br>
!) according to the invention<br>
is such that the flexural modulus as measured at 23°C is in<br>
the range of 1,500 to 1,800 MPa, and the environmental<br>
stress crack resistance ESCR (hr) as measured at 50°C is 10<br>
hours or longer before failure, preferably 50 hours or<br>
longer before failure. An ethylene polymer having the<br>
flexural modulus and ESCR values within these ranges is<br>
hard and tough, and thus the molded product obtained<br>
therefrom can be made thinner than conventional ones upon<br>
use. When multistage polymerization as described later is<br>
carried out using a catalyst system as described later, an<br>
ethylene polymer with its [TI] falling in the above range<br>
can be prepared by changing the proportions of hydrogen,<br>
ethylene and a-olefin fed to the polymerization vessel and<br>
thereby controlling the molecular weights and the<br>
proportions of polymerized amounts of the respective<br>
components. Specifically, when an ethylene polymer which<br>
has been polymerized under the conditions as described in<br>
Example 14 using hexane as the solvent, is kneaded at 190°C<br>
and 50 rpm for 10 minutes using a Labo-Plastmil (batch<br>
volume of the unit = 60 cm3) manufactured by Toyo Seiki<br>
Seisakusho, Ltd., the flexural modulus obtained is 1,650<br>
MPa, and the ESCR is 600 hours before failure. When the<br>
amount of 1-hexene fed to the second polymerization vessel<br>
is changed from 50 g/hr to 30 g/hr, and the amount of<br>
ethylene fed to the second polymerization vessel is reduced<br>
from 4.0 kg/hr to 3.0 kg/hr, the flexural modulus becomes<br>
1,780 MPa, and the ESCR becomes 233 hours before near 50%<br>
failure. When the amount of 1-hexene fed to the second<br>
polymerization vessel is changed from 50 g/hr to 65 g/hr,<br>
the flexural modulus becomes 1,520 MPa, and the ESCR<br>
becomes 600 hours before failure.<br>
[Requirement (1B")]<br>
The above-mentioned ethylene polymer (EB') according<br>
to the invention is preferably such that tan 8 (loss<br>
modulus G"/storage modulus G') as measured at 190°C and at<br>
an angular frequency of 100 rad/sec using a dynamic<br>
viscoelasticity measuring apparatus is 0.7 to 0.9. When<br>
tan 6 falls within this range, the pinch-weldability of the<br>
blow molded product is excellent. As the molecular weight<br>
of the low molecular weight ethylene polymer is increased,<br>
and as the molecular weight of the high molecular weight<br>
ethylene-a-olefin copolymer is decreased, tan 6 tends to<br>
increase. In addition, pinch-weldability refers to the<br>
ability of a resin being well attached to the welded parts<br>
with a bulge when molten resin extruded in the shape of<br>
tube from an extruder is welded between the molds. Large<br>
tan 5 means stronger viscosity, and in this case, the resin<br>
is thought to be susceptible to bulging.<br>
Moreover, ethylene polymers (EB) / tEB') and (EB")<br>
according to the invention for use in blow molded products<br>
are preferably soluble in decane at 140°C. This means that<br>
the polymers are not crosslinked, and when the polymers are<br>
not crosslinked, it is possible to recycle them after redissolving<br>
them. Therefore, the preparation process for<br>
molded products is more convenient and desirable.<br>
Further, with regard to ethylene polymers (EB), (EB<br>
and (EB") for use in blow molded products, the ethylene<br>
polymer (E) is preferably the ethylene polymer (E1) which<br>
satisfies the above-mentioned requirements (I1) to (7');<br>
more preferably, the ethylene polymer (E1) is the ethylene<br>
polymer (E") which satisfies the above-mentioned<br>
requirement (!"); and particularly preferably, the ethylene<br>
polymer (E") is the ethylene polymer (E111) which satisfies<br>
the above-mentioned requirements (!'') and (2l l f). In<br>
other words, as for the ethylene polymer of the invention<br>
for use in blow molded products, the ethylene polymer<br>
(E'l!) which satisfies all of the above-mentioned<br>
requirements (1B'), (2B') and (1B") is most suitably used.<br>
Ethylene polymer (EP) suitably used in pipes<br>
Among the ethylene polymers (E), preferably (E1),<br>
more preferably (E") and particularly preferably (E1 1 1),<br>
according to the invention, the ethylene polymer that is<br>
suitably used in pipes is preferably defined as in the<br>
following (1P) and (2P) in terms of the concentration of<br>
the constitutional unit derived from a-olefin having 6 to<br>
10 carbon atoms and of the value of Mw/Mn, respectively.<br>
An ethylene polymer defined as such may be referred to as<br>
an ethylene polymer (EP) in the following description.<br>
dp) The polymer contains 0.10 to 1.00 mol% of a<br>
constitutional unit derived from a-olefin having 6 to 10<br>
carbon atoms; and<br>
(2P) the ratio (Mw/Mn) of the weight average<br>
molecular weight (Mw) and the number average molecular<br>
weight (Mn) as measured by GPC is in the range of 11 to 70.<br>
Hereinafter, requirement (1P) and requirement (2P)<br>
will be explained.<br>
[Requirement (1) ]<br>
The ethylene polymer (EP) according to the invention<br>
that is suitably used in pipes contains usually 0.10 to<br>
1.00 mol% of a constitutional unit derived from a-olefin<br>
having 6 to 10 carbon atoms. When ethylene polymer (EP) of<br>
the invention does not include ethylene homopolymers, that<br>
is, when the polymer includes only copolymers of ethylene<br>
and a-olefin having 6 to 10 carbon atoms, it is preferred<br>
that the constitutional unit derived from ethylene is<br>
usually present in a proportion of 99.00 to 99.90 mol%, and<br>
the repeating unit derived from the a-olefin is usually<br>
present in a proportion of 0.10 to 1.00 mol%. Further, the<br>
ethylene polymer (EP) may occasionally include ethylene<br>
homopolymers, and in this case, it is desirable that the<br>
constitutional unit derived from ethylene is usually<br>
present in a proportion of 95.00 to 99.80 mol%, and the<br>
repeating unit derived from the a-olefin is present in a<br>
proportion of 0.20 to 5.00 mol% in the ethylene-a-olefin<br>
copolymer part. In addition, even when the polymer<br>
includes ethylene homopolymers, the repeating unit derived<br>
from the a-olefin usually occupies 0.10 to 1.00 mol% of<br>
the whole polymer.<br>
[Requirement (2p) ]<br>
The ethylene polymer (Ep) according to the invention<br>
is such that the ratio Mw/Mn (Mw: weight average molecular<br>
weight, Mn: number average molecular weight) as measured by<br>
gel permeation chromatography (GPC) is usually in the range<br>
of 11 to 70, and preferably in the range of 11 to 50. When<br>
multistage polymerization as described later is carried out<br>
using a catalyst system as described later, an ethylene<br>
polymer falling in this scope can be prepared by<br>
controlling the molecular weights and the ratio of<br>
polymerized amounts of the respective components. For<br>
example, when the difference in the molecular weights of<br>
the respective components is increased, the ratio Mw/Mn is<br>
increased. A polymer having Mw/Mn within the mentioned<br>
ranges is well balanced between mechanical strength and<br>
moldability. Specifically, when polymerization is carried<br>
out under the conditions as described in Example 1 using<br>
hexane as the solvent, the ratio Mw/Mn obtained is 14.8.<br>
Here, when the amount of ethylene fed to the first<br>
polymerization vessel is changed from 5.0 kg/hr to 7.0<br>
kg/hr, and that of hydrogen is changed from 57 N-liters/hr<br>
to 125 N-liters/hr, the molecular weight of the ethylene<br>
polymer produced in the first polymerization vessel<br>
decreases, and thus Mw/Mn becomes about 18. On the other<br>
hand, when the amount of ethylene fed to the second<br>
polymerization vessel is changed from 4.0 kg/hr to 3.3<br>
kg/hr, and that of hydrogen is changed from 0.2 N-liter/hr<br>
to 0.07 N-liter/hr, the molecular weight of the ethylene<br>
polymer produced in the second polymerization vessel<br>
increases, and thus Mw/Mn becomes about 22. Further, when<br>
hydrogen is fed to the first polymerization vessel at the<br>
rate of 52 N-liters/hr, and ethylene, hydrogen and 1-hexene<br>
are fed to the second polymerization vessel at the rates of<br>
6.0 kg/hr, 0.45 N-liter/hr and 200 g/hr, respectively,<br>
Mw/Mn becomes about 12.<br>
The ethylene polymer (EP) of the invention preferably<br>
satisfies, in addition to the above-described requirements<br>
(1P) and (2?) , the following requirements (lp?) and (2p')<br>
[this ethylene polymer may be referred to ethylene polymer<br>
(Ep1)]:<br>
(I?1) the actual stress obtained when it takes 10,000<br>
cycles to fracture due to the tensile fatigue property as<br>
measured at 80°C according to JIS K-6744, is from 13 MPa to<br>
17 MPa, and the actual stress obtained when it takes<br>
100,000 cycles to fracture is from 12 to 16 MPa; and<br>
(2P<br>
f) the actual stress (S) (MPa) and density (d)<br>
obtained when it takes 10,000 cycles to fracture due to the<br>
tensile fatigue property as measured at 23°C according to<br>
JIS K-7188, satisfy the following relationship (Eq-2):<br>
(0.12d - 94.84) 
Hereinafter, requirement (!?') and requirement (2P<br>
will be discussed in detail.<br>
[Requirement (I?1)]<br>
The ethylene polymer (Ep1) according to the invention<br>
is such that the actual stress obtained when it takes<br>
10,000 cycles to fracture due to the tensile fatigue<br>
property as measured at 80°C with a notched specimen, is<br>
from 13 MPa to 17 Mpa, and preferably from 14 MPa to 16 MPa,<br>
and the actual stress obtained when it takes 100,000 cycles<br>
to fracture is in the range of 12 MPa to 17 MPa, and<br>
preferably in the range of 13 MPa to 16 MPa. An ethylene<br>
polymer with the tensile fatigue strength as measured at<br>
80°C with a notched specimen falling in the above-mentioned<br>
ranges, exhibits a brittle failure mode and has excellent<br>
long-term life properties. When multistage polymerization<br>
as described later is carried out using a catalyst system<br>
as described later, an ethylene^polymer falling within this<br>
scope can be prepared by controlling the molecular weights<br>
of the respective components, the amount of the a-olefin<br>
copolymerized with ethylene, the composition distribution,<br>
the ratio of polymerized amounts, and compatibility. For<br>
example, fatigue strength can be enhanced within the scope<br>
of the claims, by increasing the value of [r\] within ;the<br>
claimed scope using a specific single-site catalyst, by<br>
selecting oc-olefin having 6 to 10 carbon atoms as the aolefin<br>
to be copolymerized, by selecting the amount of aolefin<br>
in the copolymer from a range of 0.1 to 5.0 mol%,<br>
and by selecting the polymerization conditions that would<br>
narrow the composition distribution. Specifically, when<br>
polymerization is carried out under the conditions as<br>
described in Example 3 using hexane as the solvent, and<br>
granulation is carried out under the conditions as<br>
described in Example 3, the actual stress obtained when it<br>
takes 10,000 cycles to fracture due to the tensile fatigue<br>
property as measured at 80°C, is 13.7 MPa, and the actual<br>
stress obtained when it takes 100,000 cycles to fracture is<br>
13.1 MPa. When granulation is carried out using a 20 mm
single-screw extruder (L/D = 28, compression ratio = 3)<br>
manufactured by Thermoplastics Inc. which is set at 230°C,<br>
100 rpm and at an output rate of 50 g/min with a full<br>
flight screw, the actual stress obtained when it takes<br>
10,000 cycles to fracture due to the tensile fatigue as<br>
measured at 80°C is 12.3 MPa, and the actual stress<br>
obtained when it takes 100,000 cycles to fracture is 11.3<br>
MPa, thus the polymer not satisfying the claimed scope. It<br>
is inferred that this is because compatibility of the<br>
polymerized particles is poor. Further, during<br>
polymerization, when ethylene and hydrogen are fed to the<br>
second polymerization vessel at the rates of 3.3 kg/hr and<br>
0.07 N-liter/hr, respectively, and granulation is carried<br>
out under the conditions as described in Example 3, the<br>
actual stress obtained when it takes 10,000 cycles to<br>
fracture due to the tensile fatigue property as measured at<br>
80°C is 13.9 MPa, and the actual stress obtained when it<br>
takes 100,000 cycles to fracture is 13.4 MPa. Also, when<br>
the polymerization conditions as described in Comparative<br>
Example 1 are employed, the actual stress obtained when it<br>
takes 10,000 cycles to fracture due to the tensile fatigue<br>
property as measured at 80°C is 12.1 MPa, and the actual<br>
stress obtained when it takes 100,000 cycles to fracture is<br>
11.2 MPa, thus the polymer not satisfying the claimed scope,<br>
In contrast, when [r|] of the resin is brought close to the<br>
upper limit defined in the claims, 3.7 dl/g, by having the<br>
same amount of the comonomer as used in Example 1 and<br>
reducing the amount of hydrogen during copolymerization<br>
with the comonomer, there occur increases in the actual<br>
stress values obtained when it takes 10,000 cycles and<br>
100,000 cycles to fracture. Also, even with the same<br>
molecular structure, when a low molecular weight ethylene<br>
homopolymer prepared by single-stage polymerization and a<br>
high molecular weight ethylene-a-olefin copolymer prepared<br>
by single-stage polymerization are melt-blended, there<br>
exists a crystalline structure continuous over more than 10<br>
μm, that is, there also exists a structure continuous over<br>
more than 10 μm which is formed from the low molecular<br>
weight ethylene homopolymer and which is susceptible to<br>
destruction. Thus, the polymer does not show the tensile<br>
fatigue strength as measured at 80°C with notch. Moreover,<br>
if the polymer contains a component whose molecular<br>
structure is likely to weaken the crystalline part, in<br>
other words, if the polymer contains a low molecular weight<br>
component having a short-chained branch group, or a high<br>
molecular weight component having too many short-chained<br>
branch groups, generation of strong tie molecules which<br>
bind crystals to crystals becomes difficult, thereby the<br>
non-crystalline part being weakened. Thus, the tensile<br>
fatigue strength which is measured with a notched specimen<br>
at 80°C is not exhibited. In addition, the phrase "a<br>
crystalline structure continuous over more than 10 μm is<br>
not observed" as used herein is understood from the fact<br>
that when a Microtome slice of a 0.5 mm-thick pressed sheet<br>
obtained by melting at 190°C and cooling at 20°C is<br>
observed under a polarized microscope, a crystalline<br>
structure continuous over more than 10 μm is not observed.<br>
That is to say, it is understood from the fact that when a<br>
0.5 mm-thick pressed sheet is prepared by melting an<br>
ethylene polymer at 190°C, then molding it into a sheet<br>
form under a pressure of 10 MPa and compressing into a<br>
sheet by a cold press set at 20°C, using a hydraulic press<br>
molding machine manufactured by Shinto Metal Industries,<br>
Ltd.; then the pressed sheet is cut into a size of<br>
approximately 0.5 mm (thickness of the pressed sheet) x 10<br>
to 20 μm using a Microtome or the like; subsequently, a<br>
small amount of glycerin is applied on this cut specimen,<br>
which is then adhered to a preparation glass with a cover<br>
glass placed thereon to provide a sample for observation;<br>
and this sample is loaded on the polarized plate of a cross<br>
Nicol prism and observed with an optical microscope at<br>
about 75 magnifications and about 150 magnifications. Figs,<br>
29 and 30 illustrate examples of the case where crystalline<br>
structure is observed only in parts of the visual field,<br>
indicating that a crystalline structure continuous over<br>
more than 10 \m. is absent, and examples of the case where<br>
the crystalline structure is observed over the entire<br>
visual field, indicating that a crystalline structure<br>
continuous over more than 10 um is present. Here, the<br>
scale bar indicates that the whole length corresponds to<br>
0.5 mm. Fig. 29 shows photographs of about 75<br>
magnifications, and Fig. 30 shows those of about 150<br>
magnifications.<br>
[Requirement (2P<br>
f)]<br>
The ethylene polymer (EP') according to the invention<br>
is characterized in that the actual stress (S) (MPa)<br>
obtained when it takes 10,000 cycles to fracture due to the<br>
tensile fatigue property as measured at 23°C with an<br>
unnotched specimen, is in the range of 19.4 to 27.2 MPa,<br>
and preferably in the range of 19.6 to 27.2 MPa, or<br>
ethylene polymer (EP'} according to the invention is<br>
characterized in that the actual stress (S) (MPa) obtained<br>
when it takes 10,000 cycles to fracture due to the tensile<br>
fatigue property as measured at 23°C with an unnotched<br>
specimen, and the density (d) (kg/m3) of a specimen which<br>
has been annealed at 120°C for l.hour and then cooled<br>
linearly to room temperature over 1 hour, as measured by<br>
means of a density gradient column, satisfy the following<br>
relationship (Eq-2):<br>
(0.12d - 94.84) 
and preferably the following relationship (Eq-3):<br>
(0.20d - 170.84) 
The tensile fatigue property as measured at 23e|C with<br>
an unnotched specimen may be improved by increasing the<br>
density, that is, by hardening the polymer; however, since<br>
there may be changes in the mechanical properties in<br>
addition to the change of density, this is implied in the<br>
relationship with the density. Therefore, this<br>
relationship indicates that even though the density<br>
(hardness) is the same, the tensile fatigue property as<br>
measured at 23°C with an unnotched specimen is superior to<br>
those obtained in the prior art. Further, the expression<br>
defining the lower limit of S (MPa) is based on the<br>
expression obtained in order to distinguish between the two<br>
relationships as follows, when the relationship between the<br>
tensile fatigue property as measured at 23°C with an<br>
unnotched specimen and the density of an ethylene polymer<br>
obtained by a conventional technique, and the relationship<br>
between the tensile fatigue property as measured at 23°C<br>
with an unnotched specimen and the density as obtained in<br>
the invention are plotted. The plot is shown in Fig. 35.<br>
The expression defining the upper limit of S (MPa) is based<br>
on the expression obtained in order to distinguish between<br>
the region indicating actual measurement values and the<br>
region with no actual measurement values higher than the<br>
above-mentioned values, when the relationship between the<br>
tensile fatigue property as measured at 23°C with an<br>
unnotched specimen and the density as obtained in the<br>
invention is plotted. The plot is shown in Fig. 35. When<br>
multistage polymerization as described later is carried out<br>
using a catalyst system as described later, an ethylene<br>
polymer falling within this scope can be prepared by<br>
controlling the molecular weights of the respective<br>
components, the amount of a-olefin to be copolymerized<br>
with ethylene, the composition distribution, the ratio of<br>
polymerized amounts, and compatibility. For example, the<br>
fatigue strength can be enhanced within the claimed scope,<br>
by increasing the value of [TJ] within the claimed scope<br>
using a specific single-site catalyst, by selecting aolefin<br>
having 6 to 10 carbon atoms as the a-olefin to be<br>
copolymerized, by decreasing the proportion of the aolefin<br>
in the copolymer to the range of 0.1 to 2.0 mol%,<br>
and by selecting the polymerization conditions that would<br>
narrow the composition distribution. Specifically, when<br>
polymerization is carried out under the conditions as<br>
described in Example 3 using hexane as the solvent, and .<br>
granulation is carried out under the conditions as<br>
described in Example 3, the density (d) is 953 kg/m3, and<br>
the actual stress (S) obtained when it takes 10,000 cycles<br>
to fracture due to the tensile fatigue property as measured<br>
at 23°C is 20.2 MPa. When the density (d) is 953 kg/in3,<br>
(S) is in the range of 19.5 to 21.8 MPa.<br>
Moreover, the ethylene polymers (EP) , (EP') and (EP")<br>
according to the invention for use in pipes are preferably<br>
soluble in decane at 140°C. This means that the<br>
crosslinking process is not performed, and when<br>
crosslinking process is not performed, it is possible to<br>
recycle the polymers after re-dissolving them. Thus, the<br>
process for preparation of molded products is more<br>
convenient and desirable.<br>
Further, with regard to ethylene polymers (EP), (EP')<br>
and (EP") for use in pipes, the ethylene polymer (E) is<br>
preferably an ethylene polymer (E1) which satisfies the<br>
above-mentioned requirements (I1) to (71); more preferably,<br>
the ethylene polymer (E1) is an ethylene polymer (E") which<br>
satisfies the above-mentioned requirement- (!"); and<br>
particularly preferably, the ethylene polymer (E") is an<br>
ethylene polymer (E1 1 1) which satisfies the above-mentioned<br>
requirements (I1 1 1 ) and (2'lf). In other words, as for the<br>
ethylene polymer of the invention for use in pipes, the<br>
ethylene polymer (E1 1 1) which satisfies both the abovementioned<br>
requirements (1P') and (2P<br>
!) is most suitably<br>
used.<br>
Process for preparation of ethylene polymer<br>
The ethylene polymer according to the invention can<br>
- 60 -<br>

olefin. This prepolymerized solid catalyst component has a<br>
constitution in which polyolefin is usually prepolymerized<br>
in a proportion of from 0.1 to 1000 g, preferably from 0.3<br>
to 500 g, and particularly preferably from 1 to 200 g,<br>
relative to 1 g of the solid catalyst component.<br>
Also, for the purpose of facilitating polymerization,<br>
an antistatic agent or an anti-fouling agent may be used in<br>
combination or supported on the carrier.<br>
Polymerization can be carried out either by liquidphase<br>
polymerization such as solution polymerization,<br>
suspension polymerization or the like, or by gas-phase<br>
polymerization, and particularly suspension polymerization<br>
and gas-phase polymerization are preferably employed.<br>
As for an inactive hydrocarbon medium used in liquidphase<br>
polymerization, mention may be specifically made of<br>
aliphatic hydrocarbons such as propane, butane, pentane,<br>
hexane, heptane, octane, decane, dodecane and kerosene;<br>
alicyclic hydrocarbons such as cyclopentane, cyclohexane<br>
and methylcyclopentane; aromatic hydrocarbons such as<br>
benzene, toluene and xylene; halogenated hydrocarbons such<br>
as ethylene chloride, chlorobenzene and dichloromethane;<br>
and mixtures thereof, and the olefin itself can be also<br>
used as the solvent.<br>
When (co)polymerization is carried out using a<br>
catalyst for olefin polymerization as described above,<br>
Component (A) is typically used in an amount of from 10~12<br>
to 10~2 mole, and preferably from 10~10 to 10"3 mole,<br>
relative to 1 liter of the reaction volume.<br>
Component (B-l) which is used if necessary, is used<br>
in an amount such that the molar ratio [(B-1)/M] of<br>
component (B-l) and the transition metal atom (M) in<br>
Component (A) would be typically from 0.01 to 100,000, and<br>
preferably from 0.05 to 50,000.<br>
Component (B-2) which is used if necessary, is used<br>
in an amount such that the molar ratio [(B-2)/M] of the<br>
aluminum atom in component (B-2) and the transition metal<br>
atom (M) in Component (A) would be typically from 10 to<br>
500,000, and preferably from 20 to 100,000.<br>
Component (B-3) which is used if necessary, is used<br>
in an amount such that the molar ratio [(B-3)/Mj of<br>
component (B-3) and the transition metal atom (M) in<br>
Component (A) would be typically from 1 to 100, and<br>
preferably from 2 to 80.<br>
Component (D) which is used if necessary, is used in<br>
an amount such that when Component (B) is component (B-l),<br>
the molar ratio [(D)/(B-1)] would be typically from 0.01 to<br>
10, preferably from 0.1 to 5, and when Component (B) is<br>
component (B-2), the molar ratio [(D)/(B-2)] would be<br>
typically from 0.001 to 2, and preferably from 0.005 to 1,<br>
and when Component (B) is component (B-3), the molar ratio<br>
[(D)/(B-3)] would be typically from 0.01 to 10, and<br>
preferably from 0.1 to 5.<br>
Further, the temperature for the polymerization<br>
process using such catalyst for olefin polymerization is<br>
typically in the range of -50 to 250°C, preferably 0 to<br>
200°C, and particularly preferably 60 to 170°C. The<br>
polymerization pressure is typically from ambient pressure<br>
to 100 kg/cm2, and preferably from ambient pressure to 50<br>
kg/cm2, and the polymerization reaction can be carried out<br>
in either of the batch mode, semi-continuous mode and<br>
continuous mode. Polymerization is usually carried out in<br>
a gas phase or in a slurry phase in which polymer particles<br>
are precipitated out in a solvent. Furthermore,<br>
polymerization is carried out in two or more stages with<br>
different reaction conditions. In this case, it is <br>
preferably carried out in the batch mode. Also, in the<br>
case of slurry polymerization or gas phase polymerization,<br>
the polymerization temperature is preferably from 60 to<br>
90°C, and more preferably from 65 to 85°C. Via<br>
polymerization within this temperature range, an ethylene<br>
polymer with narrower composition distribution can be<br>
obtained. A polymer obtained as such is in the form of a<br>
particle with a diameter of tens to thousands of |m, In<br>
the case of polymerization in the continuous mode in two or<br>
more polymerization vessels, there is needed an operation<br>
such as precipitation in a poor solvent after dissolution<br>
in a good solvent, sufficient melt-kneading in a specific<br>
kneader, or the like.<br>
When the ethylene polymer according to the invention<br>
is prepared in, for example, two stages, an ethylene<br>
homopolymer having an intrinsic viscosity of 0.3 to 1.8<br>
dl/g is prepared in the first stage, and a (co)polymer<br>
having an intrinsic viscosity of 3.0 to 10.0 dl/g is<br>
prepared in the second stage. This order may be reversed.<br>
Since the catalyst for olefin polymerization has<br>
extremely high polymerization performance even for the aolefin<br>
(e.g., 1-hexene) to be copolymerized with ethylene,<br>
there would be needed a devisal not to produce a copolymer<br>
with excessively high a-olefin content, "after completion<br>
of predetermined polymerization. For example, mention may<br>
be made of methods such as, when the content of the<br>
polymerization vessel is withdrawn from the polymerization<br>
vessel, simultaneously or as immediately as possible, (1)<br>
separating the polymer, solvent and unreacted a-olefin<br>
with a solvent separator, (2) adding an inert gas such as<br>
nitrogen and the like to the content to discharge the<br>
solvent and unreacted a-olefin out of the system, (3)<br>
controlling the pressure applied to the content to<br>
discharge the solvent and unreacted a-olefin out of the<br>
system, (4) adding a large quantity of solvent to the<br>
content to dilute the unreacted a-olefin to a<br>
concentration at which substantially no polymerization<br>
takes place, (5) adding a substance which deactivates the<br>
catalyst for polymerization, such as methanol and the like,<br>
(6) cooling the content to a temperature at which<br>
substantially no polymerization takes place, or the like.<br>
These.methods may be carried out independently or in<br>
combination of several methods.<br>
The molecular weight of the obtained ethylene polymer<br>
can be controlled by adding hydrogen to the polymerization<br>
system or by changing the polymerization temperature. It<br>
can be also controlled by means of the difference in<br>
Components (B) u sed.<br>
The polymer particles obtained by polymerization<br>
reaction may be also pelletized by the following methods:<br>
(1) a method of mechanically blending the ethylene<br>
polymer particles with other components that are added as<br>
needed in an extruder, a kneader or the like, and cutting<br>
into predetermined sizes; and<br>
(2) a.method of dissolving the ethylene polymer and<br>
other components that are added as needed in a suitable<br>
good solvent (e.g., hydrocarbon solvents such as hexane,<br>
heptane, decane, cyclohexane, benzene, toluene, xylene and<br>
the like), subsequently removing the solvent, then<br>
mechanically blending the components using an extruder,<br>
kneader or the like, and cutting into predetermined sizes.<br>
The ethylene polymer according to the invention may<br>
be blended, as desired, with additives such as a weatherresistant<br>
stabilizer, a heat-resistant stabilizer,<br>
antistatic agent, an anti-slipping agent, an anti-blocking<br>
agent, an anti-clouding agent, a lubricant, a dye, a<br>
nucleating agent, a plasticizer, an anti-aging agent, a<br>
hydrochloric acid absorbent, -an anti-oxidizing agent and<br>
the like, carbon black, titanium oxide, Titanium Yellow,<br>
phthalocyanine, isoindolinone, a quinacridone compound, a<br>
condensed azo compound, a pigment such as ultramarine blue,<br>
cobalt blue and the like without adversely affecting the<br>
purpose of the invention.<br>
The ethylene polymer according to the invention can<br>
be molded into a blow molded product, an inflation molded<br>
product, a cast molded product, a laminated extrusion<br>
molded product, an extrusion molded product such as a pipe<br>
or other forms, an expansion molded product, an injection<br>
molded product or the like. Further, the polymer can be<br>
used in the form of a fiber, a monofilament, a non-woven<br>
fabric or the like. These products include those molded<br>
products comprising a portion consisting of an ethylene<br>
polymer and another portion consisting of another resin<br>
(laminated products, etc.). Moreover, this ethylene<br>
polymer may be used in the state of being crosslinked<br>
during molding. The ethylene polymer according to the<br>
invention gives excellent properties when used in a blow<br>
molded product and an extrusion molded product such as a<br>
pipe and various forms, among the above-mentioned molded<br>
products, thus it being desirable.<br>
The ethylene polymer (EB) for use in blow molded<br>
products according to the invention can be molded into<br>
bottles, industrial chemical canisters, gasoline tanks or<br>
the like by blow molding. Such molded products include<br>
those molded products comprising a portion consisting of<br>
ethylene polymer (EB) and a portion consisting of another<br>
resin (laminated products, etc.). Further, when ethylene<br>
polymer (EB) contains pigments, the concentration is<br>
typically from 0.01 to 3.00% by weight.<br>
The ethylene polymer (EP) for use in pipes according<br>
to the invention can be molded into pipes, or fittings that<br>
are molded by injection molding. Such molded products<br>
include those molded products (laminated products, etc.)<br>
comprising a portion consisting of ethylene (co)polymer and<br>
a portion consisting of another resin. Further, when<br>
ethylene polymer (EB) contains pigments, the concentration<br>
is typically from 0.01 to 3.00% by weight.<br>
Measuring methods for various properties<br>
* Preparation of sample for measurement<br>
To 100 parts by weight of an ethylene polymer in the<br>
microparticulate form, 0.1 part by weight of tri(2,4-di-tbutylphenyl)<br>
phosphate as a secondary anti-oxidizing agent,<br>
0.1 part by weight of n-octadecyl-3-(4'-hydroxy-3',5'-di-tbutylphenyl)<br>
propionate as a heat-resistant stabilizer, and<br>
0.05 part by weight of calcium stearate as a hydrochloric<br>
acid absorbent are blended. Then, using a Labo-Plastmil (a<br>
twin screw batch-type melt-kneading apparatus) manufactured<br>
by Toyo Seiki Seisakusho, Ltd., a feed amount 40 g (unit<br>
batch volume = 60 cm3) of the ethylene polymer was meltkneaded<br>
at a set temperature of 190°C and at 50 rpm for 5<br>
minutes or at 50 rpm for 10 minutes, then taken out to be<br>
molded into a sheet form by a cold press at 20°C, and cut<br>
into a suitable size to yield a sample for measurement. It<br>
is also possible to granulate using a conventional extruder.<br>
Yet, in the case of granulating the microparticulate<br>
ethylene polymer obtained by continuous two-stage<br>
polymerization, there would be needed a devisal such as<br>
using a twin screw extruder with long L/D in order to<br>
homogenize the polymer particles sufficiently, or the like.<br>
* Measurement of ethylene content and a-olefin<br>
content<br>
The number of methyl branch groups per 1,000 carbons<br>
in the molecular chain of the ethylene polymer was measured<br>
by 13C-NMR. Measurement was made using a Lambda 500-type<br>
nuclear magnetic resonance unit (:E: 500 MHz) manufactured<br>
by JEOL, Ltd, with an integral number of 10,000 to 30,000.<br>
Further, the peak for the main chain methylene (29.97 ppm)<br>
was used as the reference for chemical shift. A<br>
commercially available quartz glass tube for NMR<br>
measurement with a diameter of 10 mm was charged with 250<br>
to 400 mg of the sample and 2 ml of a mixed solution of<br>
ultra pure grade o-dichlorobenzene (Wako Pure Chemicals<br>
Industry, Ltd.): benzene-d6 (ISOTEC) = 5:1 (volume ratio),<br>
and the content was heated at 120°C and uniformly dispersed<br>
to a solution, which was subjected to NMR measurement. The<br>
assignment of each absorption in the NMR spectrum was based<br>
on "NMR - Introduction and Guidelines to Experimentation,"<br>
Region of Chemistry, extra edition No. 141, pp.132-133.<br>
The composition of the ethylene-a-olefin copolymer is<br>
determined typically by preparing a sample having 250 to<br>
400 mg of the copolymer uniformly dissolved in 2 ml of<br>
hexachlorobutadiene in a test tube of 10 mm, and measuring<br>
the 13C-NMR spectrum of the sample under the measurement<br>
conditions such as measurement temperature of 120°C,<br>
measurement frequency of 125.7 MHz, spectrum width of<br>
250,000 Hz, pulse repetition time of 4.5 seconds and 45°<br>
pulse.<br>
* Cross fractionation chromatography (CFC)<br>
The following measurement was made using a CFC T-150A<br>
type manufactured by Mitsubishi Chemical Co., Ltd. The<br>
separation column consisted of three Shodex AT-806 MS, the<br>
eluent was o-dichlorobenzene, the sample concentration was<br>
0.1 to 0.3 wt/vol%, the feed amount was 0.5 ml, and the<br>
flow rate was 1.0 ml/min. The sample was heated at 145°C<br>
for 2 hours, subsequently cooled to 0°C at a rate of<br>
10°C/hr and further maintained at 0°C for 60 min to coat<br>
the sample. The capacity of the temperature rising elution<br>
column was 0.86 ml, and the line capacity was 0.06 ml. As<br>
for the detector, an infrared spectrometer MIRAN 1A CVF<br>
type (CaFa cell) manufactured by FOXBORO, Inc. set in the<br>
absorbance mode with a response time of 10 seconds, was<br>
used to detect an infrared ray of 3.42 urn (2924 cm"1) . The<br>
elution temperature was such that the range of 0°C to 145°C<br>
was divided into 35 to 55 fractions, and particularly in<br>
the vicinity of an elution peak, the temperature was<br>
divided into fractions corresponding to 1°C each. The<br>
indication of the temperature is all in integers, and for<br>
example, an elution fraction at 90°C indicates a component<br>
eluted at 89°C to 90°C. The molecular weights of the<br>
components not coated even at 0°C and the fraction eluted<br>
at each temperature were measured, which were converted to<br>
the molecular weights in terms of PE using a standard<br>
calibration curve. The SEC temperature was 145°C, the<br>
amount of introduction to the inner mark was 0.5 ml, the<br>
position of introduction was at 3.0 ml, and the data<br>
sampling time interval was 0.50 second. Furthermore, when<br>
there occurred pressure abnormality due to the presence of<br>
too many eluted components within a narrow temperature<br>
range, the sample concentration would be set to less than<br>
0.1 wt/vol%. Data processing was carried out by means of<br>
an analysis program attached to the apparatus, "CFC Data<br>
Processing (version 1.50)." In addition, although cross<br>
fractionation chromatography (CFC) per se is said to be an<br>
analytic method of reproducing the results with high<br>
analytic precision as the conditions for measurement are<br>
strictly maintained constant, it is preferable to perform<br>
several measurements and to take the average.<br>
* Weight average molecular weight (Mw), number<br>
average molecular weight (Mn) and molecular weight curve<br>
Measurement was carried out as follows using a GPC-<br>
150C manufactured by Waters Corp. The separating columns<br>
used were TSKgel GMH6-HT and TSKgel GMH6-HTL, the column<br>
size was each an inner diameter of 7.5 mm and a length of<br>
600 mm, the column temperature was 140°C, the mobile phase<br>
was o-dichlorobenzene (Wako Pure Chemicals Industry, Ltd.)<br>
containing 0.025% by weight of BHT (Takeda Pharmaceutical<br>
Co., Ltd.) as the anti-oxidizing agent, at a flow rate of<br>
1.0 ml/min, the sample concentration was 0.1% by weight,<br>
the amount of sample introduced was 500 μI, and the<br>
detector used was a differential refractometer. For the<br>
standard polystyrene, a product by Tosoh Corporation was<br>
used for the molecular weight of Mw  4xl06,<br>
and a product by Pressure Chemical Co. for the molecular<br>
weight of 1,000 
value determined in terms of polyethylene by means of<br>
universal calibration.<br>
* Division of the molecular weight curve<br>
A computational program was created using the Visual<br>
Basic macros of Excel® 97 manufactured by Microsoft Corp.<br>
The two curves to be divided indicated logarithmic normal<br>
distribution, and the molecular weight distribution curve<br>
was divided into two curves with different molecular<br>
weights by convergent calculation. While comparing the<br>
curve resynthesized from the divided two curves with the<br>
molecular weight curve obtained by actual GPC measurement,<br>
calculation was performed by changing the initial values in<br>
order for the two curves to closely match with each other.<br>
Calculation was performed by partitioning the value of<br>
Log(molecular weight) into an interval of 0.02. The<br>
intensities were normalized so that the area under the<br>
molecular weight curve actually measured and the area under<br>
the curve resynthesized from the two divided curves become<br>
unity, respectively, and the calculation for curve division<br>
was repeated until the value obtained by dividing the<br>
absolute value of the difference between the intensity<br>
(height) of the actual measurement and the intensity<br>
(height) of the resynthesized curve for each molecular<br>
weight by the absolute value of the intensity (height),<br>
became 0.4 or less, preferably 0.2 or less, and more<br>
preferably 0.1 or less, for the molecular weight ranging<br>
from 10,000 to 1,000,000, and also 0.2 or less, and<br>
preferably 0.1 or less, at the maximum site of the peak<br>
divided into two. Here, the difference between the ratio<br>
Mw/Mn of the peak assigned to the lower molecular weight<br>
and the ratio Mw/Mn of the peak assigned to the higher<br>
molecular weight should be 1.5 or less. An exemplary<br>
calculation is shown in Fig. 28.<br>
* Smoothness coefficient R<br>
The resin is extruded using a Capillograph IB, a<br>
capillary flow characteristics testing machine manufactured<br>
by Toyo Seiki Co., Ltd., at a resin temperature of 200°C<br>
and a flow rate of 50 mm/min (3.6 cmVmin) . The machine is<br>
equipped with a nozzle having a length L = 60 mm and a<br>
diameter D = 1 mm, or with a cylindrical die (outer<br>
diameter = 4 mm, slit = 1 mm, length =10 mm) which can<br>
extrude a tube-shaped product, instead of a capillary die.<br>
The polymer product may be pelletized, and if the polymer<br>
particles polymerized in the gas phase or in the slurry<br>
phase are not sufficiently intermixed, there would be skin<br>
roughness on the surface of the melt extruded product. The<br>
exterior,of thus obtained strand or tube is taken as the<br>
surface for measurement in measuring the surface roughness.<br>
A Surfcom 1400D manufactured by Tokyo Seimitsu Co., Ltd.<br>
was used for the measurement. The roughness as the average<br>
of 10 points calculated according to the calculation<br>
standard JIS B0601-1982 under the following conditions:<br>
measured length = 10 mm, measurement rate 0.06 mm/sec,<br>
sampling time = 0.01 sec, sampling pitch = 0.6 (im, material<br>
of the measuring needle = diamond, and tip of the measuring<br>
needle = 5 \m$f is referred to as Rz. Rz is the value of<br>
the difference between the average value of the peak<br>
heights of the highest to the fifth highest peaks and the<br>
average value of the valley heights of the deepest to the<br>
fifth deepest valleys, with respect to the average line of<br>
a measured length of 10 mm. Measurement is performed three<br>
times at different sites, and the average value is taken as<br>
the dispersion coefficient R. Here, a standard deviation<br>
of the Rz values obtained from three measurements was<br>
determined. When the standard deviation value is larger<br>
than one half of the R value which is the average of Rz<br>
values measured three times, measurement is carried out<br>
again. When R exceeds 20 urn, the polymer particles do not<br>
intermix sufficiently. As a result, even when a thick<br>
molded product such as pipe or blow bottle is formed, the<br>
flow becomes poor, resulting in not smooth surface skin, or<br>
stress concentration between polymer particles may lead to<br>
insufficient expression of the mechanical strength.<br>
Meanwhile, when R is 20 um or less, it can be viewed that<br>
the history of polymer particles does not remain behind.<br>
* Measurement of a crystalline structure continuous<br>
over more than 10 μm<br>
A pressed sheet with a thickness of 0.5 mm was<br>
prepared by melting an ethylene polymer at 190°C, molding<br>
it into a sheet form at a pressure of 10 MPa, and<br>
compressing into a sheet by a cold press set at 20°C using<br>
a hydraulic press molding machine manufactured by Shinto<br>
Metal Industries, Ltd. Then, the sheet was cut into a size<br>
of approximately 0.5 mm (thickness of pressed sheet) x 10<br>
to 20 μm using a Microtome or the like. After then, a<br>
small amount of glycerin was applied onto the cut specimen,<br>
and the specimen was then adhered to a preparation glass<br>
with a cover glass placed thereon to provide a sample for<br>
observation. This sample was loaded on the polarized plate<br>
of a cross Nicol prism and observed with an optical<br>
microscope at about 75 magnifications and about 150<br>
magnifications. Figs. 29 and 30 illustrate examples of the<br>
case where crystalline structure is observed only in parts<br>
of the visual field, indicating that a crystalline<br>
structure continuous over more than 10 μm is absent, and<br>
examples of the case where the crystalline structure is<br>
observed over the entire visual field, indicating that a<br>
crystalline structure continuous over more than 10 μm is<br>
present. Here, the scale bar indicates that the whole<br>
length corresponds to 0.5 mm.<br>
* Measurement of methyl branch group<br>
The number of methyl branch groups per 1,000 carbon<br>
atoms in the polyethylene molecular chain was measured by<br>
13C-NMR. Measurement was carried out using an EPC500 type<br>
nuclear magnetic resonance unit (1E: 500 MHz) manufactured<br>
by JEOL, Ltd. with an integral number of 10,000 to 30,000.<br>
Further, the peak for the main chain methylene (29.97 ppm)<br>
was used as the reference for chemical shift. A<br>
commercially available quartz glass tube for NMR<br>
measurement with a diameter of 10 mm was charged with 250<br>
to 400 mg of the sample and 3 ml of a mixed solution of<br>
ultra pure grade o-dichlorobenzene (Wako Pure Chemicals<br>
Industry, Ltd.): benzene-d6 (ISOTEC) = 5:1 (volume ratio),<br>
and the content was heated at 120°C and uniformly dispersed<br>
to a solution which was then subjected to measurement. The<br>
assignment of each absorption in the NMR spectrum was based<br>
on "NMR - Introduction and Guidelines to Experimentation<br>
[I]," Region of Chemistry, extra edition No. 141, pp.132-<br>
133. The number of methyl branch groups per 1,000 carbon<br>
atoms was calculated from the ratio of the integrated<br>
strength of the absorption of the methyl group derived from<br>
a methyl branch group (19.9 ppm) to the integral sum of the<br>
absorption appearing in the region of 5 to 45 ppm. When<br>
the number of methyl branch groups per 1,000 carbon atoms<br>
is less than 0.08, the number is below the detection limit<br>
and is not detectable.<br>
* Intrinsic viscosity ([t|])<br>
This is a value measured at 135°C using decalin as<br>
the solvent. That is, about 20 mg of granulated pellets is<br>
dissolved in 15 ml of decalin, and the specific viscosity<br>
r|sp is measured in an oil bath at 135°C. This decalin<br>
solution is diluted by further adding 5 ml of the decalin<br>
solvent, and then the specific viscosity r|Sp is measured in<br>
the same manner. This dilution procedure is further<br>
repeated two times to determine the value of T|sp/C as the<br>
intrinsic viscosity (see the following formula), with the<br>
concentration (C) being extrapolated to zero.<br>
[TI] = lim(Tisp/C) (C -» 0)<br>
* Density (d)<br>
A specimen for measurement was prepared by molding a<br>
sheet having a thickness of 0.5 mm (spacer-shaped; 9 sheets<br>
of 45 x 45 x 0.5 mm obtained from a sheet of 240 x 240 x<br>
0.5 mm) under a pressure of 100 kg/cm2 using a hydraulic<br>
thermal press machine manufactured by Shinto Metal<br>
Industries, Ltd. set at 190°C, and cooling the obtained<br>
sheet via compressing it under a pressure of 100 kg/cm2<br>
using another hydraulic thermal press machine manufactured<br>
by Shinto Metal Industries, Ltd. set at 20°C. The heating<br>
plate used was a SUS plate with a thickness of 5 mm. This<br>
pressed sheet was subjected to heat treatment at 120°C for<br>
one hour and gradual cooling to room temperature linearly<br>
over 1 hour, and then the density was measured using a<br>
density gradient column.<br>
* Solubility in decane<br>
Measurement of the gel content is performed according<br>
to JIS K 6796, except that the solvent used is decane<br>
maintained at 140°C, the sample is either specimens cut<br>
from the 0.5 mm-thick pressed sheet or granulated pellets,<br>
and the concentration set to 1 mg/ml. The sample is<br>
referred to be soluble in decane at 140°C when the<br>
proportion of gel is 1% by weight or less.<br>
* Environmental stress crack resistance test for<br>
pressed sheet: ESCR (hr)<br>
A specimen for measurement was prepared by molding a<br>
sheet having a thickness of 2 mm (spacer-shaped; 4 sheets<br>
of 80 x 80 x 2 mm from a sheet of 240 x 240 x 2 mm) under a<br>
pressure of 100 kg/cm2 using a hydraulic thermal press<br>
machine manufactured by Shinto Metal Industries, Ltd. set<br>
at 190°C, and cooling the obtained sheet via compressing it<br>
under a pressure of 100 kg/cm2 using another hydraulic<br>
thermal press machine manufactured by Shinto Metal<br>
Industries, Ltd. set at 20°C. The heating plate used was a<br>
SUS plate with a thickness of 5 mm. From the above pressed<br>
sheet of 80 x 80 x 2 mm, a dumbbell-shaped specimen with a<br>
size of 13 mm x 38 mm was punched out to provide a sample<br>
for evaluation.<br>
The test for the property of environmental stress<br>
crack resistance ESCR was performed according to ASTM D1693,<br>
The conditions for evaluation (bent strip method) are<br>
summarized in the following:<br>
Shape of sample: Press molding method C<br>
Specimen: 38 x 13 mm, Thickness: 2 mm (HDPE)<br>
Notch length: 19 mm, Depth: 0.35 mm<br>
Testing temperature: 50°C, constant temperature water<br>
bath: capable of controlling at 50.0 ± 0.5°C.<br>
Storage of sample: The sample is set using a<br>
clinching device exclusively used for a specimen holder<br>
with an inner dimension of 11.75 mm and a length of 165 mm.<br>
Surfactant: Nonylphenyl polyoxyethylene ethanol<br>
(commercially available under the product name of Antarox<br>
CO-630) is diluted with water to a concentration of 10% for<br>
use.<br>
Method of evaluation: time to fracture F50 (time to<br>
50% fracture) is determined using logarithmic probability<br>
paper.<br>
* Flexural modulus of pressed sheet<br>
From a pressed sheet having a size of 80 x 80 x 2 mm,<br>
a specimen for measurement of the ESCR property with a<br>
width of 12.7 mm and a length of 63.5 mm was punched out,<br>
and the flexural modulus was measured according to ASTM D-<br>
790 under the conditions of testing temperature of 23°C,<br>
bending rate of 5.0 mm/min and bending span distance of<br>
32.0 mm.<br>
* tan 8 (= loss modulus G"/storage modulus G')<br>
Detailed information on tan 8 is described in, for<br>
example, "Lecture on Rheology", by Japan Society of<br>
Rheology, Kobunshi Kankokai, pp. 20-23. The measurement<br>
was carried out by measuring the angular frequency (CD<br>
(rad/sec)) dispersion of the storage modulus G'(Pa) and the<br>
loss modulus G"(Pa) using a rheometer RDS-II manufactured<br>
by Rheometrics, Inc. The sample holder used was a pair of<br>
parallel plates with 25 mm, and the sample thickness was<br>
about 2 mm. Under the measuring temperature of 190°C, G'<br>
and G" were measured within the range of 0.04  
The measurement was obtained at five points per one digit<br>
of co. The amount of strain was suitably selected within<br>
the range of 2 to 25%, under the conditions that the torque<br>
is detectable within the range for measurement, and no<br>
torque-over occurs.<br>
* Preparation of bottle for the measurement of<br>
buckling strength and environmental stress crack resistance<br>
ESCR property and the observation of pinch-off property of<br>
bottle<br>
Using an extrusion blow molding machine (model: 3B<br>
50-40-40) manufactured by Placo Co., Ltd., blow molding was<br>
carried out under the following conditions: set<br>
temperature: 180°C, die diameter: 23 mm
mm
rate of forming: 1.4 sec, forming pressure: 5.5 t, and blow<br>
air pressure: 5 kg/cm2. Thus, a cylindrical bottle having<br>
a capacity of 1,000 cc and a net weight of 50 g was<br>
obtained.<br>
* Buckling strength of bottle<br>
Thus prepared bottle was subjected to measurement of<br>
the buckling strength of bottle under the condition of a<br>
crosshead speed of 20 mm/min in a universal testing machine<br>
_ O0 0Q _<br>
manufactured by Instron, Inc.<br>
* Environmental stress crack resistance (ESCR)<br>
property of bottle<br>
The bottle prepared as in the above was charged with<br>
100 cc of Kitchen Hiter manufactured by Kao Corp., and then<br>
was sealed at the opening resin. The bottle and the<br>
content were maintained in an oven at 65°C to observe the<br>
time to fracture. Thus, the time to fracture F50 was<br>
determined using logarithmic probability paper.<br>
* Pinch-off property of bottle (measurement of the<br>
thickness ratio of pinched part)<br>
When the bottom of the bottle obtained by blow<br>
molding as in the above was cut in the direction<br>
perpendicular to the matching surface of the mold, the<br>
thickness ratio of the pinched part is represented by (a/b),<br>
wherein a represents the thickness at the central part of<br>
the bottle, and b represents the thickness at the thickest<br>
part. As this value is larger, the state of pinching is<br>
good (see Fig. 31) '.<br>
* Tensile fatigue strength at 80°C<br>
A specimen for the measurement of tensile fatigue<br>
strength at 80°C was prepared by molding a 2 mm-thick sheet<br>
and a 6 mm-thick sheet (spacer-shaped: 4 specimens of a<br>
size of 80 x 80 x 2 mm obtained from a sheet of a size of<br>
240 x 240 x 2 mm, and 4 specimens of a size of 30 x 60 x 6<br>
mm obtained from a sheet of a size of 200 x 200 x 6 mm) at<br>
a pressure of 100 kg/cm2 using a hydraulic thermal press<br>
machine manufactured by Shinto Metal Industries, Ltd. set<br>
at 190°C, and by cooling the sheets via compressing under a<br>
pressure of 100 kg/cm2 using another hydraulic thermal<br>
press machine manufactured by Shinto Metal Industries, Ltd.<br>
set at 20°C. From the pressed sheet having a size of 30 x<br>
60 x 6 mm, a rectangular column with a size of length 5 to<br>
6 mm x width 6 mm x height 60 mm was cut out for use as a<br>
specimen for the evaluation of actual measurement.<br>
The tensile fatigue strength (specimen form) was<br>
measured according to JIS K-6774 using a Servo-Pulser of<br>
the EHF-ERlKNx4-40L type manufactured by Shimazu Seisakusho,<br>
Ltd. (Full-notch type, notch depth = 1 mm). Summary of the<br>
evaluation conditions are as follows: several points were<br>
measured under the conditions of specimen form: 5-6 x 6 x<br>
60 mm, notched rectangular column; waveform and frequency<br>
for testing: rectangular wave, 0.5 Hz; temperature for<br>
testing: 80°C; and actual stress in the range of 10 to 18<br>
MPa. The oscillation frequency upon fracture of the<br>
specimen was taken as the fatigue strength. Further, at<br>
least three points of different actual stress values were<br>
measured, for a three or more digit number of cycles to<br>
fracture, or under an actual stress in the range of 3 MPa<br>
or greater, in order to provide an approximation formula by<br>
means of the least square method with logarithmic<br>
approximation. Thus, the actual stress values with the<br>
numbers of cycles to fracture corresponding to 10,000<br>
cycles and 100,000 cycles were determined.<br>
* Tensile fatigue strength at 23°C<br>
A 3 mm-thick dumbbell (ASTM-D-1822 Type S) as shown<br>
in Fig. 32 was prepared by molding (spacer-shaped: the form<br>
of ASTM-D-1822 Type S was provided from the sheet having a<br>
size of 240 x 240 x 3 mm) under a pressure of 100 kg/cm2<br>
using a hydraulic thermal press machine manufactured Shinto<br>
Metal Industries, Ltd.,set at 190°C, and cooling it via<br>
compressing under a pressure of 100 kg/cm2 using a<br>
hydraulic thermal press machine manufactured by Shinto<br>
Metal Industries, Ltd. set at 20°C. The specimen taken out<br>
from the spacer was used as the evaluation sample for<br>
actual measurement.<br>
The tensile fatigue strength at 23°C was measured<br>
according to JIS K-7118 using a Servo-Pulser of the EHFFG10KN-<br>
4 LA type manufactured by Shimazu Seisakusho, Ltd.<br>
Summary of the evaluation conditions are presented<br>
below.<br>
Specimen shape: ASTM-D-1822 Type S (Dumbbell as<br>
described in Fig. 32, no notches)<br>
Waveform and frequency or testing: sinusoidal wave 4<br>
Hz<br>
Temperature for testing: 23°C<br>
The tensile fatigue strength test was carried out by<br>
measuring at several points under the above-mentioned<br>
conditions (testing temperature, waveform and frequency for<br>
testing), further with a constant minimum load of the load<br>
cell of 4.9 N (0.5 kgf) and an actual stress with the<br>
maximum corrected at the central cross-section of the<br>
specimen prior to testing, in the range of 17 to 25 MPa. A<br>
50% elongation of the specimen was defined as fracture, and<br>
the oscillation frequency at this occasion was taken as the<br>
fatigue strength for the actual stress loaded. The actual<br>
stress corresponding to 10,000 cycles to fracture was<br>
determined by performing measurement for at least one digit<br>
number of cycles to fracture or to obtain an actual stress<br>
in the range of 1 MPa or greater, and providing an<br>
approximation formula by means of the least square method<br>
with logarithmic approximation.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Hereinafter, the invention will be explained more<br>
specifically with reference to Examples, which are not<br>
intended to limit the invention.<br>
[Synthetic Example 1]<br>
[Preparation of solid catalyst component (a)]<br>
A suspension was prepared from 8.5 kg of silica dried<br>
at 200°C for 3 hours and 33 liters of toluene, and then<br>
82.7 liters of a methylaluminoxane solution (Al =1.42<br>
mol/liter) was added dropwise over 30 minutes. Then, the<br>
temperature of the mixture was elevated to 115°C over 1.5<br>
hours, and the mixture was allowed to react at that<br>
temperature for 4 hours. Subsequently, the reaction<br>
mixture was cooled to 60°C, and the supernatant liquid was<br>
removed by decantation. Thus obtained solid catalyst<br>
component was washed with toluene three times and<br>
resuspended in toluene to yield a solid catalyst component<br>
(a) (total volume 150 liters).<br>
[Preparation of supported catalyst]<br>
In a two-necked 100 mi-flask which had been<br>
sufficiently purged with nitrogen, 20.39 mmol (in terms of<br>
aluminum) of the solid catalyst component (a) suspended in<br>
20 ml of toluene was added, and under stirring, 45.2 ml<br>
(0.09 mmol) of a toluene solution of<br>
diphenylmethylene(cyclopentadienyl)(2,7-di-tbutylfluorenyl)<br>
zirconium dichloride at a concentration of 2<br>
mmol/liter was added to the suspension at room temperature<br>
(23°C), the resulting mixture being stirred for another 60<br>
minutes. After stirring being stopped, the supernatant<br>
liquid was removed by decantation, the mixture was washed<br>
with 50 ml of n-decane for four times, and thus obtained<br>
supported catalyst was reslurried in 100 ml of n-decane to<br>
yield a solid catalyst component (P) as a catalyst<br>
suspension.<br>
[Example I]<br>
[Polymerization]<br>
A 1000 mi-autoclave which had been sufficiently<br>
purged with nitrogen was charged with 500 ml of n-heptane,<br>
and 0.25 ml (0.25 mmol) of triisobutylaluminum at a<br>
concentration of 1 mol/liter and 3.85 ml of the solid<br>
catalyst component (P) obtained in Synthetic Example 1<br>
(corresponding to 0.003 mmol in terms of Zr atoms) <br>
introduced. The autoclave was pressurized with an<br>
ethylene-hydrogen mix gas having a hydrogen content of 2.53<br>
vol% to a pressure of 8.0 kg/cm2 G, and polymerization was<br>
initiated at 80°C. The ethylene-hydrogen mix gas was added<br>
during polymerization to maintain at 8.0 kg/cm2 G, and<br>
polymerization was carried out for 70 minutes. After<br>
polymerization, pressure was removed, and the autoclave was<br>
purged with nitrogen to remove the ethylene-hydrogen mix<br>
gas.<br>
To this autoclave, 0.25 ml (0.25 mmol) of<br>
triisobutylaluminum at a concentration of 1 mol/liter and<br>
2.7 ml of 1-hexene were introduced, the autoclave was<br>
pressurized with an ethylene-hydrogen mix gas with a<br>
hydrogen content of 0.10 vol% to a pressure of 8.0 kg/cm2 G,<br>
and polymerization was re-initiated at 80°C. The<br>
ethylene-hydrogen mix gas was added during polymerization<br>
to maintain at 8.0 kg/cm2 G, and polymerization was carried<br>
out for 20.5 minutes. After completion of polymerization,<br>
pressure was removed, and the catalyst was deactivated by<br>
addition of methanol. The resulting polymer was filtered,<br>
washed and dried under vacuum at 80°C for 12 hours to give<br>
84.50 g of the polymer.<br>
With respect to 100 parts by weight of this polymer<br>
particle, 0.1 part by weight of tri(2,4-di-t-butylphenyl)<br>
phosphate as a secondary anti-oxidizing agent, 0.1 part by<br>
weight of n-octadecyl-3-(4'-hydroxy-3',5'-di-t-butylphenyl)<br>
propionate as a heat-resistant stabilizer, and 0.05 part by<br>
weight of calcium stearate as a hydrochloric acid absorbent<br>
were mixed. Thereafter, using a Labo-Plastmil (batch-type<br>
twin screw melt-kneading apparatus) manufactured by Toyo<br>
Seiki Co., Ltd. set at 190°C, the resin in a feed amount of<br>
40 g (apparatus batch volume = 60 cm3) was melt-kneaded at<br>
50 rpm for 5 minutes, taken out of the apparatus,<br>
compressed into a sheet by a cold press set at 20°C, and<br>
cut into a suitable size to provide a sample for<br>
measurement. The results are presented in Tables 1 to 3<br>
and Table 6. A contour diagram from cross fractionation<br>
chromatography (CFC) is given in Fig. 1; a threedimensional<br>
chart (bird's eye view) viewed from the lower<br>
temperature side is given in Fig. 2; a three-dimensional<br>
chart (bird's eye view) viewed from the higher temperature<br>
side is given in Fig. 3; a GPC curve for the component<br>
eluted at peak temperature (Ta) (°C) is given in Figure 4;<br>
a GPC curve for the components eluted at 73 to 76 (°C) is<br>
given in Fig. 5; and a GPC curve for the components eluted<br>
at 95 to 96 (°C) is given in Fig. 6. In the polarized<br>
microscopic observation, no crystalline structure<br>
continuous over more than 10 |im is present. Further, it is<br>
found that this sample has extremely high tensile fatigue<br>
strength at 80°C as compared with the samples used in the<br>
Comparative Examples (see Fig. 33) .<br>
[Example 2]<br>
[Polymerization]<br>
A 1000 mi-autoclave which had been sufficiently<br>
purged with nitrogen was charged with 500 ml of n-heptane,<br>
and 0.25 ml (0.25 mmol) of trilsobutylaluminum at a<br>
concentration of 1 mol/liter and 3.90 ml of the solid<br>
catalyst component (0) obtained in Synthetic Example 1<br>
(corresponding to 0.00304 mmol in terms of Zr atoms) were<br>
introduced. The autoclave was pressurized with an<br>
ethylene-hydrogen mix gas having a hydrogen content of 2.53<br>
vol% to a pressure of 8.0 kg/cm2 G, and polymerization was<br>
initiated at 80°C. The ethylene-hydrogen mix gas was added<br>
during polymerization to maintain at 8.0 kg/cm2 G, and<br>
polymerization was carried out for 63 minutes. After<br>
polymerization, pressure was removed, and the autoclave was<br>
purged with nitrogen to remove the ethylene-hydrogen mix<br>
gas.<br>
To this autoclave, 0.25 ml (0.25 mmol) of<br>
triisobutylaluminum at a concentration of 1 mol/liter and<br>
2.7 ml of 1-hexene were introduced, the autoclave was<br>
pressurized with an ethylene-hydrogen mix gas with a<br>
hydrogen content of 0.15 vol% to a pressure of 8.0 kg/cm2 G,<br>
and polymerization was re-initiated at 80°C. The<br>
ethylene-hydrogen mix gas was added during polymerization<br>
to maintain at 8.0 kg/cm2 G, and polymerization was carried<br>
out for 20.5 minutes. After completion of polymerization,<br>
pressure was removed, and the catalyst was deactivated by<br>
addition of methanol. The resulting polymer was filtered,<br>
washed and dried under vacuum at 80°C for 12 hours to give<br>
84.50 g of the polymer.<br>
With respect to 100 parts by weight of this polymer<br>
particle, the same secondary anti-oxidizing agent, heatresistant<br>
stabilizer, and hydrochloric acid absorbent as<br>
those used in Example 1 were mixed in the same parts by<br>
weight. Thereafter, using a Labo-Plastmil manufactured by<br>
Toyo Seiki Co., Ltd., the resin was melt-kneaded under the<br>
same conditions of the set temperature, the resin feed<br>
amount, the rotation speed and the melting time as used in<br>
Example 1, taken out of the apparatus, compressed into a<br>
sheet by a cold press set at 20°C, and cut into a suitable<br>
size to provide a sample for measurement. Also, this<br>
sample was used to prepare a pressed sheet, and properties<br>
thereof were measured. The results are presented in Tables<br>
1 to 3 and Table 6. In the polarized microscopic<br>
observation, no crystalline structure continuous over more<br>
than 10 μm is present. Further, it is found that this<br>
sample has extremely high tensile fatigue strength at 80°C<br>
as compared with the samples used in the Comparative<br>
Examples (see Fig. 33).<br>
[Synthetic Example 2]<br>
[Preparation of supported catalyst]<br>
In a reactor which had been sufficiently purged with<br>
nitrogen, 19.60 mmol (in terms of aluminum) of the solid<br>
catalyst component (a) synthesized in Synthetic Example 1<br>
and suspended in toluene was added, and under stirring, 2<br>
liters (74.76 mmol) of a solution of<br>
diphenylmethylene(cyclopentadienyl)(2,7-di-t-<br>
butylfluorenyl)zirconium dichloride at a concentration of<br>
37.38 mmol/liter was added to the suspension at room<br>
temperature (20 to 25°C), the resulting mixture being<br>
stirred for another 60 minutes. After stirring being<br>
stopped, the supernatant liquid was removed by decantation,<br>
the mixture was washed with 40 liters of n-hexane for two<br>
times, and thus obtained supported catalyst was reslurried<br>
in 25 liters of n-hexane to yield a solid catalyst<br>
component (y) as a catalyst suspension.<br>
[Preparation of solid catalyst component (5) by<br>
prepolymerization of solid catalyst component (y) ]<br>
To a reactor equipped with a stirrer, 15.8 liters of<br>
purified n-hexane and the above-mentioned solid catalyst<br>
component (y) were introduced under a nitrogen atmosphere,<br>
then 5 mol of triisobutylaluminum was added under stirring,<br>
and prepolymerization was carried out with ethylene in an<br>
amount such that 3 g of polyethylene is produced per gram<br>
of the solid component in 4 hours. The polymerization<br>
temperature was maintained at 20 to 25°C. After completion<br>
of polymerization, stirring was stopped, the supernatant<br>
liquid was removed by decantation, the solids were washed<br>
with 35 liters of n-hexane for 4 times, and thus obtained<br>
supported catalyst was suspended in 20 liters of n-hexane<br>
to give a solid catalyst component (8) as a catalyst<br>
suspension.<br>
[Comparative Example 1]<br>
[Polymerization]<br>
To a first polymerization bath, the following<br>
components were continuously supplied: 50 liters/hr of<br>
hexane, 0.15 mmol/hr (in terms of Zr atoms) of the solid<br>
catalyst component (5) obtained in Synthetic Example 2, 20<br>
mmol/hr of triethylaluminum, 5.0 kg/hr of ethylene, and 65<br>
N-liters/hr of hydrogen. Meanwhile, polymerization was<br>
carried out under the conditions such as polymerization<br>
temperature of 85°C, reaction pressure of 8.5 kg/cm2 G and<br>
average residence time of 2.5 hr, while continuously<br>
withdrawing the content of the polymerization bath so that<br>
the liquid level in the polymerization bath would be<br>
maintained constant. The content continuously withdrawn<br>
from the first polymerization bath was subjected to<br>
substantial removal of unreacted ethylene and hydrogen in a<br>
flash drum maintained at an internal pressure of 0.2 kg/cm2<br>
G and at 65°C.<br>
Then, the content was continuously supplied to a<br>
second polymerization bath, together with 20 liters/hr of<br>
hexane, 4.0 kg/hr of ethylene, 0.2 N-liter/hr of hydrogen<br>
and 450 g/hr of 1-hexene, and polymerization was continued<br>
under the conditions such as polymerization temperature of<br>
70°C, reaction pressure of 7 kg/cm2 G and average residence<br>
time of 1.5 hr.<br>
Also for the second polymerization bath, the content<br>
of the polymerization bath was continuously withdrawn so<br>
that the liquid level in the polymerization bath would be<br>
maintained constant. The content was subjected to removal<br>
of hexane and unreacted monomer by a solvent separation<br>
unit, and dried to give the polymer. Further, in this<br>
Comparative Example 1, supply of methanol to the content as<br>
described in Example 3 as described later was not done.<br>
Next, with respect to 100 parts by weight of the<br>
polymer particle, the same secondary anti-oxidizing agent,<br>
heat-resistant stabilizer and hydrochloric acid absorbent<br>
as used in Example 1 were mixed in the same parts by weight.<br>
Thereafter, a sample for measurement was prepared by<br>
granulation at a resin extrusion amount of 60 g/min and at<br>
100 rpm using a 20 mnusingle screw extruder (L/D = 28,<br>
full flight screw, compression ratio = 3, mesh 60/100/60)<br>
manufactured by Thermoplastics Inc., set at 230°C. Further,<br>
a pressed sheet was prepared using this sample to measure<br>
the properties. The results are presented in Tables 1 to 3<br>
and Table 6. In the polarized microscopic observation, no<br>
crystalline structure continuous over more than 10 μm is<br>
present.<br>
The contour diagram for CFC fractionation is given in<br>
Fig. 7; a three-dimensional chart (bird's eye view) viewed<br>
from the lower temperature side is given in Fig. 8; a<br>
three-dimensional chart (bird's eye view) viewed from the<br>
higher temperature side is given in Fig. 9; a GPC curve for<br>
the component eluted at peak temperature (T2) (°C) is given<br>
in Fig. 10; a GPC curve for the components eluted at 73 to<br>
76 (°C) is given in Fig. 11; and a GPC curve for the<br>
components eluted at 95 to 96 (°C) is given in Fig. 12.<br>
Further, Fig. 13 represents a projection (elution curves)<br>
in the y-z plane for the eluted components and the integral<br>
value of the amounts of the eluted components (100 area% in<br>
total), where Log(M) is taken as the x-axis, Temp(°C) is<br>
taken as the y-axis and the vertical axis is taken as the z<br>
axis in the bird's eye view (Fig. 8 or Fig. 9).<br>
As shown in Fig. 33, the tensile fatigue strength at<br>
80°C of this sample is not very high.<br>
[Comparative Example 2]<br>
With respect to 100 parts by weight of the polymer<br>
particle obtained in Comparative Example 1, the same<br>
secondary anti-oxidizing agent, heat-resistant stabilizer<br>
and hydrochloric acid absorbent as those used in Example 1<br>
were mixed in the same amounts. Thereafter, a sample for<br>
measurement was prepared by granulation at a resin<br>
extrusion amount of 22 g/min and at 100 μm using a twin<br>
screw extruder BT-30 (30 mno, L/D = 46, co-rotation, four<br>
kneading zones) manufactured by Placo Co., Ltd., set at a<br>
temperature of 240°C. Also, a pressed sheet was prepared<br>
using the sample to measure the properties. The results<br>
are presented in Tables 1 to 3 and Table 6. In the<br>
polarized microscopic observation, no crystalline structure<br>
continuous over more than 10 μm is present. When compared<br>
with Comparative Example 1, this sample has higher<br>
smoothness and slightly higher tensile fatigue strength at<br>
80°C, but when compared with Example 1, its tensile fatigue<br>
strength at 80°C is lower (see Fig. 33).<br>
 [Comparative Example 3]<br>
The pellets of product HI-ZEX 7700 M manufactured by<br>
Mitsui'Chemical Co., Ltd. were used as the sample for<br>
measurement. The co-monomer was 1-butene. A pressed sheet<br>
was prepared using the sample to measure the properties.<br>
The results are presented in Tables 1 to 3 and Tables 6 to<br>
8. In the polarized microscopic observation at 100<br>
magnifications, no crystalline structure continuous over<br>
more than 10 μmis present. As shown in Fig. 33, it is<br>
found that this sample has lower fatigue strength than the<br>
samples of Examples in the measurement of tensile fatigue<br>
at 80°C. Further, as shown in Fig. 34, the sample has<br>
lower strength than the samples of other Examples in the<br>
measurement of tensile fatigue at 23°C.<br>
[Comparative Example 4]<br>
Using the catalyst used in Example 1 described in the<br>
publication of JP-A NO. 2002-53615, an ethylene homopolymer<br>
having [r|] = 0.72 dl/g and an ethylene• 1-butene copolymer<br>
having [T\] = 5.2 dl/g and the content of 1-butene = 1.7<br>
mol% were obtained by slurry polymerization at 80°C. These<br>
were mixed in a ratio of 49/51 (weight ratio), dissolved in<br>
para-xylene at 130°C to a concentration of 10 g/1,000 ml,<br>
stirred for 3 hours and stood for 1 hour. The mixture was<br>
precipitated in 3,000 ml of acetone at 20°C, filtered<br>
through a glass filter, dried under vacuum all day and<br>
night at 60°C, and then melt-kneaded using a Labo-Plastimil<br>
to yield a sample for measurement. Further, a pressed<br>
sheet was prepared using the sample to measure the<br>
properties. The results are presented in Table 1 anq Table<br>

[Comparative Example 5]<br>
The pellets of the HDPE product (product name:<br>
Hostalen, reference name CRP100) manufactured by Basfll<br>
Corp. were used as the sample for measurement. The comonomer<br>
was 1-butene. A pressed sheet was prepared using<br>
the sample to measure the properties. The results are<br>
presented in Tables 1 to 3 and Tables 6 to 8. The contour<br>
diagram obtained from CFC fractionation is presented in Fig.<br>
14; a three-dimensional chart (bird's eye view) viewed from<br>
the lower temperature side is presented in Fig. 15; a<br>
three-dimensional chart (bird's eye view) viewed from the<br>
higher temperature side is presented in Fig. 16; a GPC<br>
curve for the component eluted at peak temperature (Tz)<br>
(°C) is presented in Fig. 17; a GPC curve for the<br>
components eluted at 73 to 76 (°C) is presented in Fig. 18,<br>
and a GPC curve for the components eluted at 95 to 96 (°C)<br>
is presented in Fig. 19. In addition, it is defined herein<br>
as TI = T2. In the polarized microscopic observation, no<br>
