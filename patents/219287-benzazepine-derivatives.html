In the preparation of suppositories, the carriers include, for example, polyethylene glycol, cacao butter, higher alcohols, higher alcohol esters, gelatin, semi-synthetic glycerides, and the like. Capsules can be prepared by charging a mixture of the compound of the present invention and the above carriers into hard gelatin capsules or soft capsules in usual manner. In the preparation of injections, the solutions, emulsions and suspensions are sterilized and are preferably made isotonic with the blood. In the preparation of these solutions, emulsions and suspensions, there are used conventional diluents, such as water, ethyl alcohol, macrogol, propylene glycol, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohol, polyoxylated isostearyl alcohol, polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters, and the like. In this case, the pharmaceutical preparations may also be incorporated with sodium chloride, glucose, or glycerin in an amount sufficient to make them isotonic, and may also be incorporated with conventional solubilizers, buffers, anesthetizing agents. Besides, the pharmaceutical preparations may optionally be incorporated with coloring agent, preservatives, perfumes, flavors, sweeting agents, and other medicaments, if required.<br>

incorporated into the pharmaceutical composition is not specified but may be<br>
selected from a broad range, but usually, it is preferably in the range of 1 to 70<br>
% by weight, more preferably in the range of 5 to about 50 % by weight.	|<br>

Using cells stably expressing human V2 receptor (hereinafter, referred to as V2-HeLa) which are prepared by introducing a gene coding human V2 receptor into HeLa cells derived from human cervical cancer, the vasopressin agonistic activity of the present compound was estimated by using as an index the cAMP amount increased by the present compound.<br>
A DMEM solution (Dulbecco modified Eagle"s medium) was previously prepared wherein the pH value thereof was adjusted to pH 7.4 with a 10 mM HEPES containing 1 mM MIBMX (isobutylmethylxanthine) and 0.3 % BSA (bovine serum albumin). The subcultured HeLa cells was inoculated into a 24-well plate, and incubated for a few days. The plate was washed twice with an iced phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and thereto was added the above DMEM solution (200 \i\) and a DMEM solution (50 \i\) containing a test compound (the compound obtained in Example 30), and the plate was incubated at 37°C for 10 minutes. In the control group, a DMEM solution (250 |il) was added instead of DMEM solution (200 \i\) and the test compound solution (50 u.l), and the plate was also incubated at 37°C for 10 minutes.<br><br>
After the reaction was completed, the reaction solution was removed by suction, and the plate was washed once with an iced PBS. The plate was extracted with a 0.1 N aqueous hydrochloric acid solution (500 jil) to extract the cAMP from the cells, which was stored at -20°C until the assay. The cAMP amount in each group was determined by using a cAMP Kit (manufactured by YAMASA SHOYU CO., LTD.). The increase ratio (%) of the cAMP amount in the test compound-treated group was calculated based on the cAMP amount of the control group. The result is shown in Table 3.<br><br><br><br>
