				<td>A MOBILITY MANAGER AND METHOD FOR<br>
FACILITATING HANDOVER OF COMMUNICATION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a mobility manager and method for<br>
facilitating handover of communication of a first call between a wireless<br>
communication unit and peer communication unit from a first communication<br>
network to a second communication network. In general, the present invention<br>
relates to wireless communication units and wireless networks,and more<br>
specifically to a handover method and apparatus for communication with such<br>
wireless communication units operating within such wireless networks.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Loosely coupled Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) are being<br>
contemplated or are known. Such WLANs are typically defined supported by<br>
WLAN servers, which may alternatively be referred to as private branch<br>
exchanges (PBXs) or enterprise servers. The PBX normally provides a control<br>
and switching function for the WLAN and a communication units operating<br>
therein or users thereof. The WLAN can be an attractive and inexpensive<br>
alternative for typical voice services such as telephony or dispatch services and<br>
may provide additional with such amenities such as high-speed wireless Internet<br>
and Intranet access and an inexpensive alternative for telephony services as well<br>
as other real-time applications that may be more specific to a given enterprise.<br>
Wireless wide area networks (wireless WANs or WANs) such as<br>
conventional cellular telephone systems are also known. Such networks provide<br>
the advantage of wide area coverage but may not be economically attractive for<br>
routine access to wideband or high speed data capabilities, such as are required<br>
for certain Internet or Intranet--------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>
beyond the effective service area for the WLAN and thus need support or services from a<br>
WAN. In situations, sometimes referred to as loosely coupled systems, where the WAN<br>
is essentially not aware of the WLAN or communication unit operating thereon this can<br>
present problems, particularly for ongoing communication and handoffs or handovers<br>
thereof.<br>
Therefore, a need exists for methods and apparatus to support handovers or<br>
handoffs between a first and a second communication network,<br>

advantages in accordance with the present invention.<br>

In overview, the present disclosure concerns wireless communication devices or<br>
units, often referred to as communication units, such as cellular phone or two-way radios<br>
and the like and communication networks or systems that provide services such as voice<br>
and data communication services to or for such communication units. More particularly<br>
various inventive concepts and principles are embodied in systems or constituent<br>
elements, communication units, and methods therein for providing handover or seamless<br>
handover of an ongoing communication between the communication unit and another<br>
communication unit from a first communication network to a second communication<br>
network. Note that communication unit may be used interchangeably herein with wireless<br>
subscriber device or unit and each of these terms denotes a device ordinarily associated<br>
with a user and typically a wireless communication unit that may be used with a public<br>
network in accordance with a service agreement or within a private network. Examples of<br>
such units include personal digital assistants, personal computers equipped for wireless .<br>
operation, a cellular handset or device, or equivalents thereof provided such units are<br>
arranged and constructed for operation in different networks.<br>
The communication systems and communication units that are of particular<br>
interest are those that may provide or facilitate voice communication services or data or<br>
messaging services over cellular wide area networks (WANs), such as conventional two<br>
way systems and devices, various cellular phone systems including analog and digital<br>
cellular, CDMA (code division multiple access) and variants thereof, GSM, GPRS<br>
(General Packet Radio System), 2.5G and 3G systems such as UMTS (Universal Mobile<br>
Telecommunication Service) systems, integrated digital enhanced networks and variants<br><br>
interest have short range wireless communication capability normally referred to as<br>
WLAN capabilities, such as IEEE 802.11, Bluetooth, or Hiper-Lan and the like that<br>
preferably utilize CDMA, frequency hopping, OFDM or TDMA access technologies and<br>
one or more of various networking protocols, such as TCP/IP (Transmission Control<br>
Protocol/Internet Protocol), UDP/TP (User Datagram Protocol/IP), IPX/SPX (Inter-Packet<br>
Exchange/Sequential Packet Exchange), Net BIOS (Network Basic Input Output System)<br>
or other protocol structures.<br>
As further discussed below various inventive principles and combinations thereof<br>
are advantageously employed to facilitate a handover of an ongoing communication or<br>
communication link from a first wireless communication network (first network) to a<br>
second wireless communication network (second network). This is facilitated by<br>
providing a handover number that may be called from or by a moving communication unit<br>
using the second network where the handover number terminates on a network element or<br>
mobility manager in the first network. In this manner, advantageously a handover may be<br>
accomplished without dropping the ongoing communication and without the second<br>
network being aware of the first network.<br>
The instant disclosure is provided to further explain in an enabling fashion the best<br>
modes of performing one or more embodiments in accordance with the present invention.<br>
The disclosure is further offered to enhance an understanding and appreciation for the<br>
inventive principles and advantages thereof, rather than to limit in any manner the<br>
invention. The invention is defined solely by the appended claims including any<br>
amendments made during the pendency of this application and all equivalents of those<br>
claims as issued.<br><br>
the like, if any, are used solely to distinguish one from another entity, item, or action<br>
without necessarily requiring or implying any actual such relationship or order between<br>
such entities, items or actions.<br>
Much of the inventive functionality and many of the inventive principles when<br>
implemented, are best supported with or in software or integrated circuits (ICs), such as a<br>
digital signal processors or general purpose processors and software therefore or<br>
application specific ICs. It is expected that one of ordinary skill, notwithstanding possibly<br>
significant effort and many design choices motivated by; for example, available time,<br>
. current technology, and economic considerations, when guided by the concepts and<br>
principles disclosed herein will be readily capable of generating such software instructions<br>
or ICs with minimal experimentation. Therefore, in the interest of brevity and<br>
minimization of any risk of obscuring the principles and concepts according to the present<br>
invention, further discussion of such software and ICs, if any, will be limited to the<br>
essentials with respect to the principles and concepts used by the preferred embodiments.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, a simplified and representative environment or system<br>
diagram where a handover method and apparatus can be implemented will be discussed<br>
and described. The handover method and apparatus is for handing over, e.g. handover, of<br>
an ongoing communication from a first to a second wireless communication network. The<br>
diagram generally shows a communication unit 102 that is portable or mobile and that can<br>
move (depicted generally by arrow 104) throughout a service area of a first wireless<br>
communication network (first network) 106 and a service area for a second wireless<br>
communication network (second network) 108. In this exemplary embodiment, the first<br>
network 106 is or includes a wireless local area network (WLAN) and the second network<br><br>
network otherwise referred to as a cellular wide area network (cellular WAN) or simply<br>
WAN. The first network 106 includes a network switching function 110 that may<br>
alternatively be referred to as Private Branch Exchange (PBX), enterprise server, media<br>
gateway controller (MGC) and so on. The second network or WAN 108 includes a<br>
network switching function 112, alternatively referred to as a mobile switching center or<br>
MSC. The coverage area of the second network is typically much larger than that of the<br>
first network and overlaps in total or in part the coverage area of the first network as<br>
depicted. Note that first and second networks will be used in the description but these<br>
terms may be interchanged, e.g. the first network could be a WAN and the second<br>
network a WLAN, or both could be WLANs for example.<br>
Also it will be appreciated that a large number of entities or functions that are part<br>
of typical networks are not specifically shown but understood to be present and<br>
operational. For example in the first network 106 or WLAN a large number of Access<br>
Points that support a radio or wireless link with a wireless communication unit and<br>
thereby couple the unit to the balance of the network are not shown as well as typical<br>
network routing equipment such as servers, concentrators, routers, etc. The second<br>
network or wireless WAN (hereafter WAN) similarly typically includes a plurality of base<br>
transmitters and antenna towers as well as base site controllers that all serve to provide a<br>
radio access network for communication units as well as various registrars, billing servers<br>
and so forth. Note that while the first and second networks 106,108 are referred to as<br>
wireless networks, much of these networks or the respective elements thereof are<br>
intercoupled using terrestrial based wires. For example, the switching functions 110,112<br>
are normally coupled to the balance of their respective networks using ordinary cables or<br><br>
or static communications units that are coupled to the network using conventional cabling<br>
or wires. Thus the discussions below will refer alternatively to the first communications<br>
network 106 as a WLAN or LAN.<br>
Both networks 106,108 via the switching functions 110,112 will likely be<br>
intercoupled to a public switched telephone and data network and thus coupled to each<br>
other. Furthermore the networks in a preferred embodiment are packet data networks<br>
using packet switched methodologies. Furthermore the communication networks utilize<br>
some form of protocol for setting up sessions or connections with other units. Various<br>
known protocols can be used, such as H.323 defined and promulgated by the International<br>
Multimedia Telecommunication Consortium (IMTC) (see http://www.imtc.org/h323.htm<br>
and associated websites for descriptive documents) or Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) as<br>
defined by IETF in RFC3261 document. Much of the discussion below, where relevant<br>
will assume that SEP and SIP constructs and entities are being utilized in the WLAN and<br>
that legacy cellular or dispatch protocols are being utilized in the WAN, where it is<br>
understood that similar functions and methods are available using other protocols if<br>
desired.<br>
The network switching function 110 may serve a single enterprise location, such<br>
as an office building or may serve multiple enterprise sites, possibly located in different<br>
cities. The network switching function 110 or enterprise server may serve a WLAN<br>
hotspot, or multiple WLAN hotspots. It may also serve one or more WLAN coverage<br>
areas in private homes that may be connected to the network switching function 110 by<br>
such means as IP broadband connections. Generally the network switching function<br>
operates to establish a connection between wireless communication units within the<br><br>
114. Note that the connection from the wireless communication unit is a packet data<br>
connection and the connection from the peer communication unit will depend on the<br>
particulars for the peer unit. For example if the peer communication unit is another static<br>
or wireless communication unit within the WLAN or LAN the connection will also be a<br>
packet data based connection, while if the peer unit is an ordinary phone outside the LAN<br>
or WLAN 106 the connection is likely a circuit switched connection.<br>
Other network entities, specifically depicted are a mobility manager 116 and proxy<br>
server 118. The mobility manager 116 operates to facilitate handover activities from one<br>
to the other network when required and as discussed further below. The proxy server 118<br>
may or may not be present but if present generally provides a central point or network<br>
address that all communication units can contact when they intend to set up a call or<br>
connection with another unit. The proxy server will have the most up to date location<br>
information for or address, e.g. know where to find, another communication unit or the<br>
network switching function 110 in accordance with known techniques. Note that the<br>
mobility manager 116 can be a stand-alone entity or the functionality of the mobility<br>
manager can be combined with the proxy server 118 or with the network switching<br>
function 110. For reasons that will be become clearer below it may be advantageous to<br>
combine the mobility manager and proxy server if one is available. In that instance the<br>
mobility manager can become incremental software programs operating or executing on<br>
the same network based computing platform as the proxy server.<br>
Further shown is an ongoing communication between the wireless communication<br>
unit 102 and the peer communication unit 114. The signaling or control portion of this<br>
ongoing communication is depicted by the dotted lines 122 with the signaling path shown<br><br>
switching function 110 and then the peer communication unit 114. The bearer portion of<br>
the ongoing communication is shown by the solid lines 120 with the path including the leg<br>
between the wireless communication unit 102 and the network switching function 110 and<br>
then the leg to the peer unit 114. Note that if the peer communication unit 114 is within<br>
the LAN or WLAN the bearer and possibly the signaling path would not need to go<br>
through the network switching function once the communication is set up. The bearer in<br>
fact could go directly from the wireless communication unit to the peer communication<br>
unit. In one embodiment the signaling portion of communication (setup, control, and<br>
teardown) is done using SIP messaging. The bearer portion or actual voice and data is<br>
carried using VoIP (voice over IP) techniques and real time protocol (RTP) and User<br>
Datagram Protocol (UDP).<br>
In FIG. 1 as is known the communication units are mobile and can move around<br>
within the WLAN or the WAN and routinely move out of range of the WLAN, e.g. into<br>
the WAN and vice versa. When this happens with a call or communication in progress a<br>
handover or handover of the ongoing communication from one system or network to the<br>
other is required. This handover, sometimes referred to as handout when the handover is<br>
from the WLAN to the WAN, should be seamless or barely noticeable in order to avoid<br>
hampering, interrupting, or dropping ongoing communication and in general keep users<br>
satisfied. Various inventive techniques and apparatus that advantageously address this<br>
issue will be the dominant focus of the balance of the present disclosure.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2 and FIG. 3, where like reference numerals refer to like entities,<br>
various exemplary states in the handover of the ongoing communication within the FIG. 1<br>
system or diagram will be discussed and reviewed. Initially with reference to FIG. 2 it is<br><br>
WLAN or LAN 106. Note also that the ongoing communication is still underway via the<br>
WLAN as represented by the solid lines 120 and the dotted lines 122. As the wireless<br>
communication unit 102 moves closer to the boundary of the WLAN 106 it will be<br>
determined that a handover of the ongoing communication may be imminent and thus<br>
preparation for a handout must be undertaken. This determination can be done by the<br>
wireless communication unit or another entity within the LAN, such as the proxy server or<br>
network switching function or one of the other network entities that are understood to be<br>
present assessing signal quality for the signaling or bearer portion of the ongoing<br>
communication. Generally if the signal quality level, e.g. signal to noise, or frame error<br>
rate or like assessment crosses some threshold it is determined that a handover is likely.<br>
At least by that point the wireless communication unit 102 and another network<br>
entity, such as the mobility manager 116 need to ascertain a handover number,<br>
represented by dashed line 202, that will be used by the wireless communication unit in<br>
facilitating the handover of the ongoing communication to the second communication<br>
network or WAN 108. The handover number is chosen or provided or selected such that a<br>
call placed by the wireless communication unit after appropriate registration, etc. to the<br>
handover number via the second communication network will be routed through the<br>
network switching function 112 or MSC to the network switching function 110, and<br>
terminate within the first communication network at the other network entity, such as the<br>
mobility manager 116.<br>
Note that various embodiments are contemplated for providing the handover<br>
number. For example, this may be a predetermined number that is programmed into one<br>
of or both of the wireless communication unit and the other network entity, e.g. mobility<br><br>
only one of the other network entity and wireless communication unit, the one with the<br>
number can provide the number to the other 202. The handover number may be selected<br>
by for example, the other network entity or mobility manager 116 from a pool of such<br>
numbers where the size of the pool can be from 1 to several possible handover numbers<br>
and then provided to the wireless communication unit 102. Note that the handover<br>
number, if not preprogrammed, can be provided as required at any time during or after the<br>
ongoing communication is setup and in one embodiment is provided during the setup<br>
processes and included within one of a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) INVITE message<br>
or a SIP message, such as SIP OK message, that is responsive to a SIP INVITE message,<br>
depending on which unit initiates the setup call and which entity needs to be notified of<br>
the handover number.<br>
In addition to the handover number being known to both the wireless<br>
communication unit 102 and other network entity, e.g. mobility manager 116, appropriate<br>
call information corresponding to the ongoing communication between the wireless<br>
communication unit and the peer communication unit, needs to be obtained by the<br>
mobility manager 116 or relevant other network entity. This call information can take<br>
many forms but must be sufficient to identify the relevant communication and portions<br>
thereof. For example, in a SIP controlled IP call, the call information that is available and<br>
is sufficient to accomplish the end objectives will include a Call-ID, From and To headers<br>
and corresponding tags, Cseq sequence numbers, relevant Session Description Protocol<br>
(SDP) information on the bearer, contact addresses where SIP messages are sent, and<br>
routes or routing, etc.<br>
network entity that is providing the appropriate functionality. This information can be<br>
obtained from, for example the wireless communication unit as depicted via the dashed<br>
line 202 or anther network entity, such as a network server, for example the proxy server<br>
118 or network switching function 110, if properly configured, that is monitoring or<br>
participating in the communication or communication setup. This is one reason that it can<br>
be especially advantageous if the mobility manager is co-located with this network server,<br>
such as the proxy server when one is utilized or some other network entity that is always<br>
aware of call setup activities. In this instance the relevant call information can be<br>
obtained during call setup for the communication by simply providing the details from the<br>
proxy or other server to the mobility manager function within the same network platform,<br>
via a software interface, for example. Furthermore in some embodiments it will be useful<br>
if the mobility manager 116 or analogous functionality obtains sufficient information from<br>
or about the wireless communication unit, such that the mobility manager can send or<br>
respond to SIP messages as though it was or on behalf of the wireless communication unit<br>
or in some instances the peer communication unit 114. This can prove useful in the event<br>
that the ongoing communication with the wireless communication unit fails before the<br>
handover is fully realized.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3 where like reference numerals refer to similar entities as above<br>
discussed and after preparing for the handover as discussed above with reference to FIG.<br>
2, the process for starting the handover of the ongoing communication will be discussed<br>
and described. The ongoing communication continues as indicated by lines 120,122,<br>
provided that the WLAN coverage is still available. The wireless communication unit 102<br>
after a successful registration with the second wireless communication network 108,<br><br>
e.g. cellular network, where the handover call is addressed to the handover number that<br>
was ascertained and discussed above. The handover call is routed through the network<br>
switching function 112 or MSC and coupled to the network switching function 110 where<br>
it is routed to and terminated by the mobility manager 116 as indicated by dashed lines<br>
302. The mobility manager acknowledges reception of the handover call, typically<br>
embodied as a SIP INVITE message or message with similar functionality if an<br>
alternative protocol is used. The acknowledgment can be in the form of a SIP ringing<br>
indication although it is preferable that the mobility manager does not allow the call to<br>
connect, e.g. no SIP OK message for the moment.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, the diagram of the FIG. 1 system after the handover has been<br>
accomplished or nearly accomplished will be discussed and described. The mobility manager<br>
operates to facilitate connecting the peer communication unit to the handover call and sending a<br>
connect indication, such as SIP OK message, for the handover call to the wireless communicatio<br>
unit. Connecting the peer communication unit to the handover call can be accomplished by a)<br>
transferring the ongoing communication of the peer communication unit to the handover call, b)<br>
conferencing the ongoing communication of the peer communication unit, the ongoing<br>
communication via the WLAN of the wireless communication unit, and the handover call<br>
together, or c) rerouting the ongoing communication with the peer communication unit to<br>
coincide with the routing of the handover call at the network switching function.<br>
Unique messages can be developed to perform the interface, depicted as dashed<br>
line 402, from the mobility manager to the network switching function 110 so as to<br>
accomplish the connecting objective, where the mobility manager would use the call<br>
information obtained as discussed above with reference to FIG. 2 or the call information<br><br>
send messages, such as SIP messages, on behalf of or as though it were the wireless<br>
communication unit 102. When the mobility manager 116 gets the handover call, it can<br>
construct a SIP message that it directs to the contact address specified for the ongoing call,<br>
e.g. the network switching function 110 as depicted, such that the message looks to the<br>
network switching function 110 as if it came from the wireless communication unit 102.<br>
The mobility manager can also pretend that the handover call from the network switching<br>
function to the mobility manager 116 went to the wireless communication unit, rather than<br>
the mobility manager. The message directs or requests the network switching function<br>
110 to either transfer the ongoing communication 120,122 from the peer communication<br>
unit to the handover call 404 from the wireless communication unit 102 or to put the<br>
ongoing communication from the peer communication unit 114, the ongoing<br>
communication 120 from the wireless communication unit, and the handover call 404 into<br>
a conference arrangement, using for example a SIP REFER message. The details of other<br>
re-routing techniques will be discussed below with reference to FIG. 7 - FIG. 10. After<br>
the handover has been accomplished, the mobility manager can terminate the ongoing<br>
communication 120 from the wireless communication unit 102 by again sending a SIP<br>
message on behalf of the unit. With this overview a more detailed discussion of<br>
exemplary embodiments of the wireless communication unit 102 and mobility manager<br>
116 will be undertaken.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, a simplified block diagram of a wireless communication unit<br>
102 that is arranged for facilitating a handover of an ongoing communication with the<br>
wireless communication unit from a first to a second wireless communication network<br>
will be discussed and described. The communication unit 102 is generally known other<br><br>
structure of such devices will not be described in detail other than as related to the<br>
inventive principles and concepts disclosed and discussed below. The communication<br>
unit 102 includes an antenna 501 or antenna structure that operates to couple radio<br>
frequency signals between atransceiver 503 and the first or second network 106,108 as is<br>
known. For example, radio signals that are transmitted from the WLAN 106 or WAN<br>
108, such as respectively, by an access point (WLAN transceiver) or base transmitter site<br>
(WAN transceiver) are absorbed by the antenna 501 and coupled to a receiver, that is part<br>
of the transceiver 503.<br>
Respectively, signals that are amplified by and coupled from the transceiver 503,<br>
specifically a transmitter (WLAN transmitter or WAN transmitter), to the antenna 501 are<br>
radiated or transmitted or sent to the access point or base transmitter site according to<br>
known WLAN technologies, such as 802.11 and others earlier mentioned or WAN<br>
technologies, such as known cellular networks. The transceiver 503 will be configurable<br>
to support simultaneous air interfaces with multiple communication networks according to<br>
the conventions and protocols of each or may alternatively further include one or more of<br>
a WLAN transceiver 509 and WAN transceiver 511 for such purposes as will be<br>
appreciated by those of ordinary skill. The transceiver 503 or respective receivers and<br>
transmitters are inter coupled as depicted and interactively operate with and are controlled<br>
by a controller 505 to provide to, or accept or receive from the controller 505, voice traffic<br>
or data messages or signals corresponding thereto in packet data form.<br>
Accordingly, the transceiver 503 as controlled by and in cooperation with the<br>
controller 505 and functions thereof provide the communication unit 102 with multi or<br>
dual operating mode capability. More particularly, the communication unit 102 is capable<br><br>
network, such as a WLAN as well as a cellular network or WAN. . For purposes of<br>
simplifying this disclosure, the balance of the discussion will refer to only the transceiver<br>
503 and it is understood the transceiver with the controller 505 has the capability to<br>
establish and maintain a connection via either of or both the first and the second networks<br>
106,108.<br>
The controller 505 is coupled to and generally operates in a known manner with a<br>
user interface 507, except for the modifications required according to the principles and<br>
concepts discussed here. The user interface 507 is known and typically includes, for<br>
example, audio transducers, such as an earphone or speaker and microphone, a display<br>
and a keypad. The transceiver and user interface are each inter coupled, as depicted to the<br>
controller 505 and the controller provides overall operational command and control for the<br>
communication unit 102.<br>
The controller 505 is essentially a general-purpose processor and, preferably,<br>
includes a processor 513 and an associated memory 515. The processor 513 is,<br>
preferably, a known processor based element with functionality that will depend on the<br>
specifics of the air interfaces with the first and the second network as well as various<br>
network protocols for voice and data traffic. The processor 513 will operate to encode<br>
and decode voice and data messages to provide signals suitable for the transceiver, a<br>
transducer, or further processing by the controller 505. The processor 513 may include<br>
one or more generally available microprocessors, digital signal processors, and other<br>
integrated circuits depending on the responsibilities of the controller 505 with respect to<br>
signal processing duties or other unit features that are not here relevant.<br>
example, a combination of known RAM (Random Access Memory), ROM (Read-Only<br>
Memory), EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable ROM) or magnetic memory.<br>
The memory 515 is used to store among various other items or programs etc., an operating<br>
system or software, data, and variables 517 for execution or use by the processor 513.<br>
This operating software 517 when executed by the processor 513 will result in the<br>
processor performing the requisite functions of the communication unit 102 such as<br>
interfacing with the user interface 507 and transceiver 503 or transmitting and receiving<br>
devices. The memory 515 further includes call processing routines not specifically shown<br>
for supporting voice and data calls that will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill and<br>
that will vary depending on air interface, call processing, and service provider or network<br>
specifics.<br>
As depicted, the memory 515 further includes in some embodiments a signal<br>
quality assessment routine 519 for use in deterrnining whether a handover may be<br>
required if the wireless communication unit .102 is responsible for that determination as<br>
above discussed. This routine is used to assess signal quality and compare that to a<br>
threshold value and depending on the result determine whether a handover situation is<br>
imminent. The specifics may be communication unit specific and in any event can be<br>
experimentally determined and modified as experience dictates. In one embodiment SIP<br>
messaging routines 521 are provided for generating and responding to SIP messages<br>
according to known techniques. In one embodiment these routines are used to support the<br>
air interface with the first and second conmiunication network, initiate handover calls and<br>
the like. Also depicted is a voice conversion or vocoder routine. This routine may be<br>
used in conjunction with other specialized portions of the processor to convert voice to<br><br>
in driving a speaker or earpiece. Additionally, packet data processes 525 are provided for<br>
formulating appropriate packets for transport according to the specifics of the<br>
communication networks. Furthermore various data is provided in the memory,<br>
specifically unit information 527 including identification information to identify the<br>
communication unit and call information 529, such as noted above. Collectively this<br>
information can be used to identify a particular unit and a particular call, should a<br>
handover be required. At 531 a handover number is located. This handover number can<br>
be obtained at initial configuration or provisioning or assigned by a network entity, such<br>
as the mobility manager on a call by call basis. Various other routines 533 that are not<br>
especially relevant to the disclosure and that will be obvious to one of ordinary skill given<br>
a specific communication unit will not be discussed.<br>
In operation the wireless communication unit 102 comprises the transceiver 503 that is<br>
suitable to support an air interface with a first wireless communication network, such as network<br>
106, and with a second wireless communication network, such as network 108; and<br>
the controller 505 that is coupled to and controlling the transceiver and operable for obtaining a<br>
handover number that terminates on, for example, the mobility manager 116. The mobility<br>
manager is associated with the first communication network and the handover number is useable<br>
to facilitate a handover of an ongoing communication between the wireless communication unit<br>
102 and a peer communication unit 114, where the handover is from the first wireless<br>
communication network to the second wireless communication network.<br>
In some embodiments, the first wireless communication network is a wireless local area<br>
network and the second wireless communication network is a wireless wide area network. The<br>
wireless communication unit, specifically the controller operating with the transceiver can obtain<br><br>
messaging or call setup processes, the handover number can be obtained by including it in one<br>
a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) INVITE message and a response message to the SIP INVITI<br>
message, depending on which party initiates setting up the ongoing communication as well as<br>
which of the participants in the ongoing communication needs to obtain the handover number.<br>
In some embodiments the controller 505 controls the transceiver 503 to obtain the<br>
handover number from a network entity, such as the mobility manager 116, within the first<br>
communication network. Furthermore, the controller can control and cooperate with the<br>
transceiver 503 to forward information regarding the ongoing communication to the network<br>
entity or the mobility manager to facilitate the handover. When a pending handover is indicate<br>
as determined by the communication unit, using the signal quality routines 519 or other networ<br>
entity, the controller 505 controls the transceiver to initiate a handover call, using the SIP<br>
messaging routines 521 and packet data processes 525 using the second wireless communicatio<br>
network, the handover call addressed to the handover number 531. Once the handover call has<br>
been connected, the controller, controls and cooperates with the transceiver to switch the ongoir<br>
communication to the second wireless network and to discontinue the ongoing communication<br>
with the first communication.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, a simplified block diagram of a mobility manager usable for<br>
facilitating a handover of communication from a first to a second communication network<br>
will be reviewed and discussed. Some of this discussion will be in the nature of a review<br>
and summary of portions of the discussions above. The block diagram represents a<br>
general purpose computing platform that embodies a stand alone mobility manager, such<br>
as mobility manager 116 or the block diagram can be viewed as various of the network<br>
entities, such as the proxy server 118 with the portion devoted to the mobility manager<br><br>
specifically a network interface function, such as a network transceiver or a software<br>
interface function if the mobility manager 116 is operating on a platform that also<br>
embodies anther network entity. In any event whatever platform is providing the mobility<br>
manager 116 will require an interface, such as a transceiver, for interfacing to its<br>
respective network, such as the LAN or WLAN106. This network interface can be an<br>
RJ-45 physical connector and support an Ethernet protocol.<br>
The interface 603 is coupled to and controlled by a controller 605 that can be<br>
further coupled to a local or remote operator interface, such as a monitor and keyboard or<br>
another computing platform all as known. The controller includes a processor 613 that is<br>
a general purpose processor that may be redundant for incremental network availability.<br>
The processor is coupled to a memory 615 that will be some combination of RAM, ROM,<br>
EEPROM, and likely magnetic based memory as would be expected on such platforms.<br>
Note a suitable platform, server, or computer is available from various manufacturers,<br>
including IBM, Dell, and Hewlett Packard, for example.<br>
. The memory includes an operating system, data, and variables 617 that provide the<br>
general operating conditions, etc, for the processor as is known. In some embodiments<br>
SIP messaging routines 619 are included to facilitate forming and decoding messages<br>
according to known SIP protocols. Additionally packet data processing routines 621 are<br>
provided for supporting packet data communication within the network according to the<br>
conventions used by the network. In those embodiments where needed a pool of<br>
handover numbers as well as assignments 623 are provided. Note as discussed above<br>
sometimes the mobility manager will assign handover numbers with the assignments<br>
varying between one for all handover calls with other identification means, such as caller<br><br>
handover number for each communication unit, or a handover number for each<br>
communication that needs to be handed out to another network. The mobility manager<br>
will store ongoing communication or call information 625 that is obtained as discussed<br>
above for any calls that need to be handed out or transferred to another network. If the<br>
mobility manager is responsible for determining when a handover call may be required a<br>
signal quality assessment routine 627, operating as noted above will be provided.<br>
Furthermore, communication unit states 629 are stored for all communication units that<br>
may be involved in a handover call, thus allowing the mobility manager to formulate and<br>
respond to SIP messages on behalf of such units. Additionally many other routines 631<br>
that are understood by those of ordinary skill and not further relevant are provided.<br>
In operation the mobility manager 116 or similar network entity with like responsibility<br>
and functionality operates to facilitate handover of communication from a first communication<br>
network to a second communication network. The mobility manager includes the interface<br>
function 603 to interface to the first communication network and the controller 605 that is<br>
coupled to and controlling the interface function to obtain call information corresponding to an<br>
ongoing communication, stored at 625, between a wireless communication unit and a peer<br>
communication unit that uses the first communication network and ascertain a handover number<br>
for the wireless communication unit, where the handover number terminates on the mobility<br>
manager and is used in facilitating the handover of the ongoing communication to the second<br>
communication network.<br>
As noted earlier some embodiments of the mobility manager operate where the first<br>
communication network is a wireless local area network or WLAN at least in part and the second<br>
communication network is a wireless wide area network or WAN. The controller 605 can obtain<br>
23<br>
as the proxy server 118. Various approaches are contemplated for the controller 605 to ascerta<br>
the handover number, for example a) obtaining the handover number from the wireless<br>
communication unit, b) assigning and providing the handover number to the wireless<br>
communication unit from the pool of such numbers 623, or c) obtaining the handover number<br>
from another network server, such as the proxy server 118 or network switching function 110.<br>
The higher level interface with the first communication network is a Session Initiation Protocol<br>
(SIP) interface, an H.323 interface, or similar type of protocol. When a SIP protocol is used an<br>
the handover number must be communicated to or from the mobility manager or other network<br>
entity, the handover number can be advantageously included in a SIP INVITE message or a<br>
response message to the SIP INVITE message, such as SIP OK message.<br>
After the appropriate call information and handover numbers have been communicated<br>
provided, the controller 605 cooperatively with the interface function 603 is operable to or<br>
operates to receive a handover call that originates from the wireless communication unit 102 at<br>
uses the second communication network, where the handover call is directed to or addressed to<br>
the handover number, using the routines 619,621. This handover call is received from the<br>
network switching function 110 for the first communication network and the controller further<br>
operates to facilitate connecting the peer communication unit 114 to the handover call and<br>
sending a connect indication, such as a SIP OK, for the handover call to the wireless<br>
communication unit. Note that the mobility manager in connecting the peer communication<br>
to the handover call has various alternative choices including a) transferring the ongoing<br>
communication of the peer communication unit to the handover call, b) conferencing the ongoi<br>
communication of the peer communication unit, the ongoing communication of the wireless<br>
communication unit, and the handover call together, or c) rerouting the ongoing communicatio]<br><br>
switching function, where a) and b) have been earlier discussed and c) will be further discussed<br>
with reference to FIG. 7 - Fig. 10 below.<br>
The controller 605 operates to facilitate the handover call by initiating a message, such<br>
SIP message, that results in routing or re-routing the ongoing communication of the peer<br>
communication unit to the handover call. This message in some embodiment can be initiated of<br>
behalf of the wireless communication unit. Usually the message is directed to the network<br>
switching function 110, since that is a common control point for all relevant calls or call legs. A<br>
will be discussed below in systems will multiple network switching functions for the WLAN, the<br>
message can be directed to a first network switching function and responsive to this message, a<br>
corresponding message is then directed to a second network switching function that is supporting<br>
the ongoing communication with the peer communication unit. In any event when a response<br>
message initiated by the peer communication unit is received by the controller via the interface<br>
function, this response message will trigger sending the connect indication to the wireless<br>
communication unit.<br>
Referring to FIG. 7, another simplified and representative exemplary system<br>
diagram where the handover method and apparatus can be implemented will be discussed<br>
and described. Note that FIG. 7 deals with the same handover problems that were<br>
discussed above with reference to FIG. 1 - FIG. 4, however the processes discussed with<br>
reference to FIG. 7 - FIG. 10 are more generalized can be suitable for operation in more<br>
generalized system environments. In FIG. 7 like reference numerals refer to like or<br>
similar elements to those discussed with reference to FIG. 1 - FIG. 4 and the various<br>
alternative embodiments and processes, such as where handover numbers are obtained and<br>
embodiment.<br>
FIG. 7 does show a peer communication unit 714 that is a packet data unit that<br>
. operates, through a proxy 718 if available, at least within the LAN or WLAN106. The<br>
network switching function 710 for the WLAN 106 uses a SIP construct, specifically back<br>
to back user agents (BTBUA), where each user agent (UA) handles or supports<br>
communication with one entity, such as UA1 730 for the peer unit 714 or UA2 732 for the<br>
wireless communication unit 102. As is known in SIP systems the BTBUAs involved in<br>
the same call or communication share certain call information for that communication<br>
only among themselves. The network switching function 710 thus performs the same or<br>
similar functions as the switching function 110 discussed above. The ongoing<br>
communication between the wireless communication unit 102 and the peer<br>
communication unit 714, before the handover occurs, is represented as depicted by the<br>
solid line 120 for the bearer path or RTP portion and the dashed lines 122 for the signaling<br>
and control portion of the call or communication. Note that the bearer portion 120 is<br>
shown going directly from the peer unit 714 to the wireless unit 102, which results since<br>
the peer unit 714 is within the LAN or WLAN 106. The mobility manager knows the<br>
relevant call information via 702,202 and along with the wireless communication unit<br>
102 the handover number via 202 as above discussed and utilized.<br>
Referring to FIG. 8, the next procedure, namely placing a handover call via the<br>
WAN is depicted and will be discussed and described. When a handover situation<br>
becomes imminent as determined and described above, the wireless communication unit<br>
102 initiates a handover call, depicted by dashed lines 302 through the second<br>
communication network 108 or WAN where the call is directed or addressed to the<br><br>
thus the handover call is routed via the network switching function 112 to the network<br>
switching function 110, specifically UA3 834 to UA4 836 (another BTBUA pair), and<br>
then to the mobility manager 116. Note that the ongoing communication continues via<br>
120,122.<br>
Referring to FIG. 9, the processes preparatory to re-routing the ongoing<br>
communication to the second network 108 are shown and will be described and discussed.<br>
After receiving the handover call 302 the mobility manager 116 sends or directs a<br>
message 902, in one embodiment a SIP (re-) INVITE message either from the wireless<br>
communication unit 102 if the mobility manager 116 has provided sufficient information<br>
regarding the handover call to the unit 102 or on behalf of the unit 102 to the peer<br>
communication unit 714 of the wireless communication unit 102 via UA2 732. Sending<br>
the message on behalf of the unit 102 adds some robustness in the event that the unit 102<br>
has moved out of WLAN service or otherwise lost the signal from the WLAN. Note in a<br>
SEP based system sending a re INVITE or mid session INVITE message is a good way to<br>
change the IP address and port to those that are to be used by the peer communication unit<br>
714 for the RTP bearer for the session. This message requests that the peer unit 714 route<br>
it's voice bearer RTP to the RTP port associated with the handover call, e.g. WAN leg or<br>
UA4 836, rather than the wireless communication unit 102. Note that the peer or actual<br>
peer of the wireless communication unit 102 is UA2 732 in the SIP sense, rather than the<br>
peer communication unit 714, however the RTP that will be re routed as a result of the<br>
message being forwarded to UA1 730 and then to the peer unit 714 is the RTP from or for<br>
the peer unit 714.<br>
SIP OK message 302 to UA4 836 that is responsive to the SIP INVITE representing the<br>
handover call via the second network. With the SIP OK response the mobility manager<br>
requests the switching function 710 to route the RTP for the handover call from the WAN<br>
to the RTP port of the peer communication unit 714. This is a good way in a SIP<br>
controlled call to tell the switching function 710 where to send the bearer. The mobility<br>
manager 116 knows the peer unit 714 RTP address and port from the call information that<br>
was obtained from the wireless unit 102 or proxy server 118 at for example call setup. As<br>
a result of the SIP OK via UA3 834, the wireless communication unit 102 will get a WAN<br>
connect signal. The wireless communication unit 102 can then switch its uplink and<br>
downlink voice or RTP to the WAN path or the handover call. Given the earlier re<br>
INVITE and the SIP OK the voice will be routed as an RTP stream to the peer<br>
communication unit 714.<br>
Note that when the mobility manager 116 sends the re INVITE message it first<br>
waits for a SIP OK message from the peer communication unit 714. The mobility<br>
manager then sends the SIP OK response to the handover call via UA4 836. Ideally this<br>
SIP OK response would be sent concurrently with a SIP ACK that is responsive to the SIP<br>
OK from the peer communication unit 714 as these messages cause the audio to be re<br>
routed. However, real world lag times or delays indicate a 50 millisecond delay after<br>
sending the SIP OK response before sending the SIP ACK will more closely align the<br>
transfer of audio or RTP routing. Experimentation on actual systems may determine an<br>
appropriate delay that is more or less than the cited 50 milliseconds. After the wireless<br>
communication unit 102 switches the uplink and downlink routing, it can tear down the<br>
WLAN path represented by lines 120 and 122 (except line 122 from the peer unit 714 to<br><br>
trait 714 still exists (see dashed line 122 at peer unit 714) and only the routing has been<br>
modified. The wireless unit 102 can terminate this call by releasing the WLAN resources<br>
devoted to the ongoing communication 120,122. Note that if the mobility manager is co-<br>
located with the SIP proxy 118 it could intercept any such SIP BYE messages from the<br>
wireless communication unit 102.<br>
Referring to FIG. 10, the system diagram of FIG. 7 after the handover of the<br>
ongoing communication has been accomplished will be discussed and described. Note<br>
that the bearer portion of the WLAN ongoing communication, depicted in earlier figures<br>
as solid line 120 is no longer present. Note that the dashed lines 302,902 and 122 depict<br>
the signaling and control portion of the communication between the wireless<br>
communication unit 102 and the peer communication unit 714 after the handover. From<br>
the wireless communication unit 102 dashed line 302 is routed through the WAN 108 and<br>
network switching function 112 to the network switching function 110 for the LAN or<br>
WLAN 106, specifically UA3 834 and UA4 836, and then to the mobility manager 116.<br>
This signaling and control within the LAN in one embodiment uses SIP processes, while<br>
ISUP or SS7 messaging or the like may be used within the WAN or outside the LAN.<br>
From the mobility manager 116 as shown by 902 the signaling and control portion is<br>
routed via UA2 732 and UA1 730 to the proxy server 718 and then to the peer<br>
communication unit 714 via line 122. The bearer portion or payload portion of the<br>
communication is routed from the wireless communication unit 102 as depicted by solid<br>
line 1002 through the WAN 108 and switching function 112 to the network switching<br>
function 110, specifically UA3 834 and UA4 836 to the peer communication unit 714.<br>
Note that the bearer 1002 within the LAN 106 is an RTP stream while the bearer outside<br><br>
packet data bearer, such as an RTP stream or whatever is appropriate given the specifics<br>
of the WAN 108.<br>
Note that after the handover or transfer of the ongoing communication to the<br>
second network 108 there are in effect three pairs of BTBUAs involved. The first pair<br>
UA1 730 and UA2 731 essentially support or service the original WLAN based call with<br>
the peer communication unit 714. The second pair UA3 834 and UA4 836 support or<br>
service the ongoing communication between the mobility manager and the wireless<br>
communication unit 102 via the WAN 108. The third pair is within the mobility manager<br>
116. This approach works in a LAN supported by a single switching function or PBX or<br>
MGC and advantageously does not need to do any call transfer or conferencing (e.g. no<br>
SIP REFER messages). Furthermore in a multi-site enterprise, for example multiple<br>
buildings in diverse cities or locations with multiple network switching functions (one for<br>
each site for example), different communication with the wireless communication unit<br>
102 may be handled by different network switching functions. The above described<br>
procedures also operate in such situations, since no direct communication is needed<br>
between pairs of user agents. The user agent pairs can be in different network switching<br>
functions, provided that all ongoing communication or calls with the wireless<br>
communication unit 102 are known by a single mobility manager 116. For example if<br>
there is a second ongoing communication with the wireless communication unit 102 the<br>
user agent pairs associated with the second ongoing communication can be in different<br>
network switching functions.<br>
Referring to FIG. 11, a diagram of a preferred method embodiment of providing a<br>
handover of an ongoing communication from a first to a second wireless communication<br><br>
reference the above figures and will be provided in an overview form in order to avoid<br>
undue duplication of some of the above disclosure. As will be appreciated, this method<br>
can be practiced by the structures and apparatus described above or by alternative<br>
arrangements. For example, much of the method can be advantageously implemented in<br>
the mobility manager or similar functionality implemented as a part of the switching<br>
function or proxy server. The method depicted in FIG. 11 is an approach for facilitating<br>
handover of communication between two communication units from a first<br>
communication network to a second communication network. The method begins at 1101<br>
with determining that a handover condition is indicated or imminent where a wireless<br>
communication unit 102 that is moving or another network entity, such as the mobility<br>
manager 116, within the first communication network 106, can perform this<br>
determination. At 1103 obtaining call information is performed where the call<br>
information corresponds to an ongoing communication between the wireless<br>
communication unit and a peer communication unit 714, the ongoing communication<br>
using the first communication network. The call information can be obtained from or by<br>
the wireless communication or a network entity, such as the mobility manager 116 within<br>
the first communication network.<br>
Then 1105 shows ascertaining a handover number for use by the wireless<br>
communication unit where the handover number terminates within the first<br>
communication network, for example at or on the mobility manager 116. The handover<br>
number is used in facilitating the handover of the ongoing communication to the second<br>
communication network 108. As noted above various alternatives exist for ascertaining<br>
the handover number. For example, the handover number can be obtained from the<br><br>
wireless communication unit by a network server or the mobility manager 116, or it can<br>
be obtained from a network server.<br>
In some embodiments the first communication network is a wireless local area<br>
network and the second communication network is a wireless wide area network.<br>
Furthermore, for example, the first communication network can use a Session Initiation<br>
Protocol interface, an H.323 interface, or the like for signaling and control of<br>
communication. In certain embodiments ascertaining the handover number and obtaining<br>
the call information is advantageously done during the setup of the ongoing<br>
communication with the implicit assumption that a handover may be required at some<br>
point during the communication. Thus it will be appreciated that the processes at 1103<br>
and 1105 can occur prior to those of 1101.<br>
Next receiving a handover call originating from the wireless communication unit<br>
using the second communication network that is directed to the handover number is<br>
shown at 1107. Receiving or specifically originating the handover call results from<br>
determining that the handover condition is indicated.. The handover call is received at a<br>
network switching function 110 for the first communication network 106 and routed to a<br>
network entity such as the mobility manager 116. The network entity operates to facilitate<br>
connecting 1109 the peer communication unit to the handover call by, for example,<br>
initiating a message that results in routing the ongoing communication of the peer<br>
communication unit to the handover call. The message can be initiated on behalf of, e.g.<br>
as though coming from, the wireless communication unit.<br>
The message is further directed to the network switching function 110, e.g. routed<br>
through the network switching function, to the peer communication unit 714. The<br><br>
function and then to or through a second network switching function and then to the peer<br>
communication unit. Connecting the peer communication unit to the handover call can<br>
alternatively comprise, given appropriate SIP messages noted above, a) transferring the<br>
ongoing communication of the peer communication unit to the handover call, b)<br>
conferencing the ongoing communication of the peer communication unit, the ongoing<br>
communication of the wireless communication unit, and the handover call together, or c)<br>
rerouting the ongoing communication with the peer communication unit to coincide with<br>
the routing of the handover call at the network switching function 110.<br>
In any event a connect indication 1111 for the handover call is sent to the wireless<br>
communication unit 102 by the network entity or mobility manager 116 and this is<br>
triggered by a response message (responsive to the message) initiated by the peer<br>
communication unit that is received by the network entity. Then 1113 shows switching or<br>
rerouting the ongoing communication to the handover call via the second network. The<br>
rerouting is accomplished by the connect indication and an acknowledgment of the<br>
response message.<br>
In this manner, initiating a handover call with a second network concurrently with<br>
or just after a handover condition is indicated provides for increased customer satisfaction<br>
since the likelihood of dropping an ongoing call or communication or experiencing poor<br>
network service is reduced. It should be noted that the methods and apparatus described<br>
above for handling handover from one to another communication network of ongoing<br>
communication between communication units may be implemented in reverse or with<br>
different communication networks than those utilized in the examples above. For<br>
second network may be the WLAN.<br>
