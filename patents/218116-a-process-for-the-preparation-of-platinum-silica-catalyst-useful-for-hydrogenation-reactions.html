				<td>This invention relates to a process for the preparation of new platinum/silica catalyst useful for hydrogenation reactions .<br>
The catalyst prepared by the process of the present invention is useful mainly for the catalytic hydrogenation of unsat-urated hydrocarbons. As the catalyst produced by the process of the present invention is reusable, it is of commercial value and the process is cost-effective since it employs very small quantity of platinum, a precious metal.<br>
The catalyst prepared by the process of the present invention has surface area in the range 400-480 m2/g, mean pore diameter in the range 180- 220 Ǻ and 0.8-1.2 µm, with atleast 80% of the pore volume contained in the pores of 0.8-1.2µm. The porous catalyst consists of a network of capilliary channels and has more acidic silanol groups. These silanol groups present in the capillary channels, being acidic attract the base i.e unsaturated hydrocarbons like cyclohexene during hydrogenation towards platinum having adsorbed hydrogen, thus making the hydrogenation more effective<br>
Catalysts are generally employed in chemical reactions. Catalyst can be compounds or metals supported on substrates. It is known that metallic catalysts supported on activated carbons have been employed for the production of various chemicals and petrochemicals. However, it has been found that these carbon supported catalysts suffer from the serious draw back of decomposition of the substrate at temperatures as low as 300°C and<br><br>
this restricts the use of carbon supported catalysts at temperatures higher than 300°C. To overcome this problem, silica was thought to be a substrate since silica is stable at high temperatures and is resistant to most of the common acids used in the reactions.<br>
Incorporation of metals into the silica is generally achieved by impregnation or by coating using solution of the metallic compounds. The metals in these catalyst carriers can easily be removed since they are present only on the surface.<br>
Another method reported in a Dutch patent (DE 4316508) used for the preparation of ceramic based catalytic supports and catalysts employing sol-gel process uses aerogels i.e hyper-critically dried gels. Aerogel is prepared by removal of liquid from the pores of an alcogels by heating the gel in an autoclave beyond the critical temperature and pressure of the liquid. This procedure is called as hypercritical drying. Hypercritical drying for an alcogel generally require a temperature of 300°C and a pressure of about 20MPa of an autoclave. This method is not easily accessible since use of costly equipment like autoclave is essential for this process.<br>
Another method using sol-gel process reported in British patent GB 8303574 describes the preparation of primary particles by vapor phase condensation method. By "vapor phase condensation method" is meant a method which involves a vapor phase intermediate. Examples of vapor phase condensation method<br><br>
are hydrolysis of volatile halides or alkoxides, evaporation and condensation using electron beam, D.C. arc or RF plasma heating and metal oxidation to give a smoke which is then condensed. These particles are then dispersed in a liquid, for example water, to form a sol containing colloidal particles which are then processed through sol-gel technique and impregnated with metal to get catalyst. This is a multistep process and require expensive equipments.<br>
It is well known that many unsaturated hydrocarbons are evolved during naphtha cracking. The conversion of unsaturated hydrocarbons to saturated hydrocarbons is effected by employing catalyst for hydrogenation reactions. Platinum catalyst supported on carbon/ceramic supports are generally used in hydrogenation reactions. However the choice of catalyst support is one factor influencing the technical, economic and commercial success of catalytic hydrogenation process. In addition, it is very desirable that the catalyst should be so formulated that it enjoys a long life even under hard conditions. Hence there is an urgent need to develope platinum/silica which is reusable, cost effective and withstand higher temperatures of the order of 500°C.<br>
The main object of the present invention is therefore to provide a process for the preparation of platinum/silica catalyst useful for hydrogenation reactions which obviates the drawback of the hitherto known processes.<br><br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of platinum/silica catalyst by hydrolytic-polycondensation of alkoxides.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of platinum/silica catalyst wherein Pt is incorporated in a silica polynetwork consisting of Si-O-Si linkages and Si-OH groups.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of platinum/silica catalyst using porous silica polynetwork consisting of Si-O-Si linkages and Si-OH groups which has cage like structure with highly reactive silanol groups.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of silica polynetwork consisting of Si-O-Si linkages and Si-OH groups as catalyst carrier, using silicon alkoxides mixture to give carrier high efficiency of catalytic metal particles.<br>
The process of the present invention involves preparation of<br>
silica polynetwork consisting of Si-O-Si linkages and Si-OH<br>
groups by sol gel technique in the presence of platinum salt at<br>
room temperature. The gel prepared is referred as doped gel and<br>
has the metal in its structure and when sintered in an inert<br>
atmosphere and air and then activated in hydrogen atmosphere<br>
yields platinum/silica (Pt/SiO2) catalyst in which Pt is incor<br>
porated	in chemical	structure.<br><br>
The reaction mechanism of the process for the preparation of platinum/silica catalyst is explained below in the following steps.<br>
Silicon alkoxides dissolved in alcohols are hydrolyzed in the presence of platinum salt:<br>
(R)nSi(OR1)4-n      	&gt;         (R)nSi(OR)14-n-m (OH)m<br>
The hydrolysed species condense among themselves to give the silica network in which<br>
platinum is incorporated in the chemical structure. (R)nSi (OR1) 4-n-m(OH)m —	&gt;<br>
[(R)nSiO2-n/2] (Pt) (OH)<br>
The polynetwork thus obtained is heated in nitrogen and in air which is followed by activation in hydrogen to give the platinum/silica catalyst.<br>
[(R)nSiO2-n/2] (Pt) (OH)n      	&gt; [SiO2] (Pt) (OH)<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides A process for the preparation of platinum/silica catalyst useful for hydrogenation reactions which comprises reacting a mixture of silicon alkoxide and alkyl substituted silicon alkoxides with aqueous solution of a mineral acid except sulphuric and phosphoric acid in the presence of a polar organic solvent and a soluble platinum salt, to obtain a sol, maintaining the reaction mixture at a temperature in the range of 40-65°C to get a gel, heating the resultant gel at a temperature in the range of 650 to 750°C in an inert atmosphere till completion of the carbonization of alkyl groups, cooling to room temperature in the inert atmosphere, reheating the resultant gel to a temperature not exceeding 430 to 570°C in the presence of air for a period not exceeding seven hours, cooling to room temperature and activating by heating at a temperature of 380 to 420°C in hydrogen atmosphere to obtain the platinum/ silicon catalyst.<br><br>
The mixture of silicon alkoxides and alkyl substituted silicon alkoxide used consists of alkoxysilane, monoalkylalkoxysilane, dialkylalkoxysilane be in a molar ratio in the range of (9-11) : (2-6) : (0.4-2) respectively.<br>
