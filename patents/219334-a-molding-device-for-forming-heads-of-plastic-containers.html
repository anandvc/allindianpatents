				<td>Processes and devices for production of containers are known in the prior art (DE199 26<br>
329 Al), ones in whicha hose of plasticized plastic material is extruded into a molding<br>
mechanism, one end of the hose is closed by heat sealing, and, as a result of generation of a<br>
pneumatic pressure gradient acting on the hose, the latter is expanded and is applied to the<br>
shaping wall of the molding mechanism to form the container. The plastic container is then<br>
filled under sterile conditions by way of a charging mandrel inside the molding mechanism and<br>
then hermetically sealed after removal of the charging mandrel to form a specified head<br>
geometry, there being two head shaping jaws which may be moved in the opposite direction by<br>
hydraulic drive means toward each other to obtain a closing position and away from each other<br>
into opening positions. The head geometries to be generated by the head jaws regularly also<br>
comprise the neck component of the plastic container—also in ampule form—which, closed by<br>
way of a separation point, may be opened for a fluid removal process as soon as the head piece is<br>
separated by way of the separation point, by way of atoggle part molded on it and thus removed<br>
from the plastic container.<br>
Such processes have been disclosed in a plurality of embodiments and are widely used in<br>
packing systems for liquid or paste products, for example, in the disclosed bottelpack7 system.<br><br>
WO 2004/091893	PCT/EP20O4/000596<br><br>
The hydraulic drive systems regularly employed in practical applications for the<br>
respective feed movement of the molding tool present problems in that any leakage may result in<br>
fouling with the fluid, something which results in problems especially when the shaping<br>
machines are used for plastic containers in the pharmaceutical and food packaging spheres and in<br>
medical technology in general. The maintenance cost is also increased and the hydraulic drive<br>
systems do not reach the desired or high cycle frequencies for mass production for the sake of<br>
precise positioning of the molding tools.<br>
On the basis of this prior art the object of the invention is to create a molding device for<br>
moving at least one molding tool, a tool making it possible to apply modern drive concepts, such<br>
as ones in the form of electric or pneumatic drives, the maintenance cost of which is reduced and<br>
which permit especially high rates of output of goods to be produced, such as plastic containers,<br>
along with high positioning accuracy for the moiding tools. The object as thus formulated is<br>
attained by means of a molding device possessing the characteristics specified in claim 1 in its<br>
entirety.<br>
In the molding device claimed for the invention a link motion control element is provided<br>
for moving at least one molding tool, especially one for generation of head geometries in plastic<br>
containers; this element moves the respective molding tool to a closing position at least for<br>
closing the mold, the link motion control element being actuatable by a drive. On the basis of<br>
the link motion control element a novel drive and movement concept is presented for the<br>
respective molding tool, one which makes it possible to dispense with hydraulic drive means<br>
entirely and by preference to employ an electric or pneumatic drive as the drive means. The link<br>
motion control element in question may, however, continue to be actuated conventionally by<br>
means of a hydraulic drive if the respective application appears to call for it and rigid<br>
requirements have not been set for sterile filling or clean room qualities.<br><br>
W0 2004/091893	PCT/EP2004/000596<br>
3<br>
The molding device claimed for the invention with drivable link motion control element<br>
for a closing movement with the molding device permits uniform, safe, and position-accurate<br>
driving of the respective molding tool and entails only a small maintenance expenditure. The<br>
link motion control element may be employed to execute a plurality of opening and closing<br>
processes in rapid sequence; with the molding device claimed for the invention this results in<br>
high output of goods to be produced, in particular those in the form of blow-molded plastic<br>
containers filled under sterile conditions.<br>
. In a preferred embodiment of the molding device claimed for the invention the link.<br>
motion control element has a slot guide in a feed component, one which is engaged by the<br>
actuating member, which may be moved into an opening and closing position of the molding tool<br>
by a rotation element actuated by means of the drive. Safe and precise positioning control is<br>
achieved as a result, along with clearly defined specific closing forces specified by the link<br>
motion control element.<br>
In another especially preferred embodiment of the molding device claimed for the<br>
invention the feed element operates in conjunction with a rail-guided slide component which<br>
may be non-positively moved into the closing position of the molding device by the feed<br>
element. By preference the slide component may be moved together with the molding tool into<br>
the closing position of the latter, it being possible to reset the molding tool to its opening<br>
position by a reset means. A rigid machine configuration for the molding device is accomplished<br>
by means of the rail guide referred to and obstructions in operation are reliably excluded by way<br>
of the separate res^t movement of molding tool and slide component.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the molding device claimed for the invention the<br>
closing force for the molding tool may be specified by way of central adjusting means,<br>
preferably in the form of an energy accumulator. Pressure spring elements such as ones in the<br>
form of disk springs or the like are suitable for use as energy accumulators. The closing force of<br><br>
WO 2004/091S93	PCT/EP2004/000596<br>
4<br>
the link motion central element may be definitely limited by the adjusting means independently<br>
of the force applied.<br>
In another especially preferred embodiment of the molding device claimed for the<br>
invention, the molding tools opposite each other in pairs may be moved by a link motion control<br>
element synchronously into their closing position. Preferably provision is also made such that.<br>
two link motion control elements of one slide component may be actuated by gearing actuated by<br>
the drive. In addition, provision preferably is also made such that two slide components each<br>
with two link mo-ion control elements may be moved in the opposite direction toward or away<br>
from each other by way of the rail guide. In this way a total of four molding tools with molding<br>
geometries mounted in sequence may be actuated to operate synchronously in pairs in order to<br>
generate several head geometries.<br>
The invertion is described in greater detail in what follows on the basis of an exemplary<br>
embodiment with reference to the drawing, in which, in diagram form not drawn to scale<br>
FIG. 1	presents a top view of part of the molding device with molding tool in closing<br>
position;<br>

First a pa;t of the molding device for moving a molding tool 10 is to be described in<br>
detail with refereace to the lower section of the illustration in FIG. 1. On its free front side the<br>
molding tool 10 lias trough-like recesses 12 which configure mold halves for generation of head<br>
geometries for plastic containers not shown. In order to generate the respective head geometries<br>
the molding tool 10 operates in conjunction with a corresponding molding tool 10a with recesses<br>
12, as shown by way of example at the bottom of FIG. 2 as viewed in the line of sight. The<br>
molding tool 10 is connected on its side opposite the recesses 12 to two adjusting components 14<br>
the length of which may be adjusted by way of at least one stop component 16, so that the<br>
adjusting components 14 provide a variable contact surface 18. As a result, the molding tool 10<br>
may be oriented on its free front side along a closing separation line I -1. In addition, the<br>
molding tool 10 may be reset independently, as is shown in FIG. 2, by way of reset means 20, as,<br>
for example, means in the form of a conventional pneumatic cylinder, along a guide (not shown),<br>
from the closing position shown in FIG. 1.<br>
In addition, the molding device has for the purpose of moving the molding tool 10 a link<br>
motion control element designated as a whole as 22 by way of which the respective molding tool<br>
10 may be actuated along the closing separation line I -1 for the purpose of closing the mold, it<br>
being possible to actuate the link motion control element 22 by means of a drive 21, preferably<br>
one in the form of an electric motor such as one in the form of an electric step motor. For this<br>
purpose the link motion control element 22 has a slot guide 26 in a feed component 28, this feed<br>
component 28 being integrated into a slide component 30 and being movable together with it<br>
into the closing and opening directions of the molding tool 10 along two rail guides 32. The slot<br>
guide 26 is mounted so as to move transversely to the rail guide 32 and to the direction of feed of<br>
the molding tool 10.<br>
The slot guide 26 is engaged by an actuating member 34 in the form of a cam roller 3 6 .<br>
(see FIG. 3). The function of pivoting of the actuating member 34 or cam roller 36 is performed<br>
by a rotation com ponent 38 driven by means of a drive 24. This rotation component 3 8 permits<br><br>
WO 2004/091893	PCT/EP2004/000596<br>
6<br>
pivoting of the actuating member 34 in the direction indicated by the arrow 40, as seen in the line<br>
of sight to FIG. 1. in order to move the feed component 28, together with the slide component<br>
30, from its closed position shown in FIG. 1 backward to an opening position as shown in FIG.<br>
2. Forthe purpose of movement in the opposite direction into the closing position the feed<br>
component 28, together with the slide component 30, is to be fed in the direction opposite that of<br>
the arrow 40 by an appropriate pivoting movement by the actuating member 34 (cam roller) in<br>
the direction of the closing separation line I -I.<br>
The structure of the rotation component designated as 38 as a whole is presented in<br>
greater detail in the illustration in FIG. 3. First the rotation component 38 is received so as to be<br>
stationary in a pate-shaped machine mounting support 42 which extends between the two rail<br>
guides 32. A vertically oriented drive shaft 46, which is rigidly connected to a toothed rim 48<br>
and is driven by "his rim, is mounted in this machine mounting Support 42 so as to be rotatable<br>
by an appropriate roller bearing 44. On the lower side of the drive shaft 46, and accordingly<br>
below the roller bearing 44, a lever piece 50 is rigidly connected to the drive shaft. The cam<br>
roller 36, which can rotate freely in the lever piece 50, extends through this lever piece 50 on its<br>
free left front side as viewed in the direction of FIG. 3. The slot guide 26 is mounted below the<br>
lever piece 50 in the feed component 28, which in turn is an integral component of the slide<br>
component 30. The teeth of the driving toothed rim 52, which may be driven by the electric<br>
drive 24, in the form of a step motor, for example, mesh with the teeth of the toothed rim 48.<br>
The drive direction is indicated by an arrow 54, the molding tool 10 being moved backward into<br>
its opening position in the respective direction.<br>
On its free front side the slide component 30 has carrier components 56 which carry the<br>
molding tool configured as a sort of movement slide as the molding tool moves into its closing<br>
position along the closing separation line I - I by way of the adjusting components 14 and into<br>
the closing position opposite the direction of movement of the opposite molding tool 10a if the<br>
latter moves into its closing position along the closing separation line I - I as shown in FIG. 1. In<br><br>
WO2004/091893	PCT/EP2004/000596<br>
7<br>
order for it to be possible selectively to adjust the closing forces, there is mounted on the one free<br>
end of each rail gu:.de 32 central adjusting means in the form of a disk spring package 58, which<br>
in each instance acts on the plate-like machine mounting support 42, which for this purpose is<br>
mounted by way of end guides 60 so as to be movable longitudinally on the rail guides 32. If the<br>
closing forces now become too high along the closing separation line I -I, the entire<br>
configuration of molding tool 10 with slide component 30 and machine mounting support 42<br>
may thus be reset backward against the action of the disk spring package 58. Consequently,<br>
safety is also provided if a machine collision unintentionally occurs, especially in the area of the<br>
molding tools 10, 10a.<br>
If, as illustrated in FIG. 1, driving toothed rim 52 with toothed rim 48 is driven in the<br>
direction indicated by arrows 54 and 40 by drive 24, the slide component 30 moves back to its<br>
initial position as shown in FIG. 2, the feed component 28 also moving into the position to the<br>
rear and the cam roller 36 pivoting 180° backward from the position shown in.FlG. 1. The<br>
carrier comppnerts 56 of the slide component 30 are accordingly moved away from the contact<br>
surface 18 by the adjusting components.14 and the respective molding tool 10, 10a is returned by<br>
way of the pneumatic cylinder 20 as reset means to the opening position and is then available for<br>
another closing process. The pair of molding tools 10, 10a positioned opposite each other is<br>
actuated synchronously by the respective link motion control element 22 of the pair for a closing<br>
process for the purpose of executing a molding process. Consequently, the drives 24 for both<br>
molding tools 10, 10a are actuated synchronously in common by way of a central control unit<br>
(not shown). The respective synchronous actuation also facilitates ejection of the plastic<br>
container by way of its head component produced by the molding tools 10, 10a. In view of the<br>
comparable structure of the two components illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2, the reference numbers<br>
used in FIG. 1 are used correspondingly in FIG. 2. In principle, however, the possibility also<br>
exists of using the link motion control element 22 in question to design only one molding tool 10<br>
to be movable and thus of moving the molding tool 10 in relation to a stationary molding tool<br>
(not shown) for a molding process. In any event the molding device as described may be used to<br><br>
WO 2004/091893	PCT/EP2004/000596<br>
8<br>
reach very high cycle frequencies and thus production speeds for plastic containers (not shown).<br>
In addition, precise positioning of the respective molding tool 10, 10a by way of the link motion<br>
control element 22 is also possible.<br>
In order to achieve a still higher output rate at least one other molding tool 10 is provided<br>
which is mounted in tandem in a row and may be actuated by the central drive 24 as described by<br>
way of a corresponding link motion control element"22. Consequently, the configuration as<br>
described shown in FTG. 1, as viewed in the line of sight to this figure, above the drive 24 and<br>
the other toothed rim 62 may be actuated along the arrow 64 if the slide component 30 is to be<br>
moved from its front position shown in FIG. 1 to its rear position shown in FIG. 2. The slot<br>
guide 26 accordiagly is also oriented in the same direction as described. Consequently, for a<br>
longitudinal operating process the cam roller 36 rolls along a circular path around the drive shaft<br>
46 and in the process carries feed components 28 and 30 along in longitudinal movement in<br>
parallel with the two rail guides 32, the transverse position of the slot guide 26 as shown in<br>
FIGS. 1 and 2 remaining unchanged. Since maximum force restriction by the respective disk<br>
spring package 58 as adjusting means is effected on- one side of the rail guide 32, the respective<br>
configuration nesd not be provided in the case of the plate-shaped machine mounting support 42<br>
shown in FIG. 2<br><br>
