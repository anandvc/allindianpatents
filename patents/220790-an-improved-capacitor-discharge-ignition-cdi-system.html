				<td>AN IMPROVED CAPACITOR DISCHARGE IGNITION (CDI) SYSTEM<br>
Field of the invention<br>
This invention relates to an improved capacitor Discharge Ignition (CDI) system capable of producing continuous ignition sparks of any desired duration.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Automotive ignition systems produce high voltage electrical discharges at the terminals of one or more spark plugs to ignite a compressed air fuel mixture. The electrical discharge is required to be produced when the piston is at a particular physical position inside the cylinder. The spark intensity must also be independent of the engine speed. Further, in order to optimize engine performance, improve fuel economy and minimize polluting effluents the time of occurrence and duration of the spark should be controllable in accordance with a defined discharge profile.<br>
There are primarily two types of ignition systems in use today - inductive ignition systems and capacitive discharge ignition (CDI) systems.<br>
In the inductive ignition system the ignition voltage is generated by sudden interruption of current following through the primary of the ignition coil. The main disadvantage of the Inductive ignition system is that the ignition energy falls of at high engine speed.<br>
In Capacitive Discharge Ignition (CDI) system the ignition voltage is generated by discharging a charged capacitor through the ignition coil primary by an electronic switch. The capacitor is initially charged to a high voltage from a high voltage d.c. source. At present, the Capacitive Discharge Ignition (CDI) system is generally employed in two wheelers to meet new emission norms and to offer improved fuel economy. Variants of CDI system are also used in cars and for racing application.<br>
Modern CDI systems also employ microcontrollers / microprocessors to provide engine parameter dependent ignition timings.<br><br>
In order to increase spark energy and better combustion of fuel some CDI systems also employ intermittent multi-spark techniques. Several other improvements have been described in various US patents.<br>
US patent 3,340,861 describes an improved inductive ignition system in which a ballast resistor is eliminated. This invention however still suffers from the limitations of inductive ignition systems at high engine speed.<br>
US patent 3,620,201, US patent 3,658,044 and US patent 3,838,328 describe various systems for producing multiple spark ignition in CDI systems. However, none of these systems are capable of producing continuous sparks or sparks of long duration.<br>
Similarly, US patent 4,228,778 describes a system for extending the spark duration in CDI systems. However, this invention is also not capable of very long duration, as the capacitor needs time for charging between consecutive discharges.<br>
US patent 4,738,239 outlines a system for enabling the use of power MOSFETS in inductive discharge systems. It does not offer any improvement in spark duration.<br>
US patent 4,922,883 and 5,220,901 define additional systems for providing multiple sparks and extended sparks in CDI systems respectively. However, these systems are not capable of continuous sparks nor can be discharge time be controlled to any desired value.<br>
US patent 6,167,875 provides a solution for adjusting the number of ignitions per cycle per cylinder depending upon the nature of the fuel-air mixture at low and high engine speeds. However, this solution is not capable of enabling continuous sparks of any desired duration.<br>
The object and summary of the invention<br>

the arrangement being such that said first controllable power switching means is used for discharging said discharge capacitor and said second controllable power switching means causes charging of said discharge capacitor, thereby enabling an ignition current through said ignition coil for any desired number of cycles during both the charge and discharge cycles of said discharge capacitor.<br>
The said high voltage d.c. source means is a dc-dc converter that produces a stable high voltage dc output independent of the variation in the voltage from said primary power source.<br>

Figure 6a shows an expanded view of the waveform of figure 6<br>
Detailed description of the drawings:<br>
Figure I shows a typical conventional GDI system, an Application Specific Device (ASD) (1.1) charges Ignition Capacitor (1.2) by supplying rectified high voltage d.c. generated from the high voltage AC supplied by supply coil (1.3). A magnetic pick-up (1.4) monitors piston position and supplies a triggering signal to ASD (1.1) after suitable signal conditioning by conditioning ckt (1.5). This triggering signal causes ASD (1.1) to discharge Ignition<br>
Capacitor (1.2) through the primary winding of Ignition Transformer (1.6) causing an ignition spark across spark plug (1.7) with a typical ignition current profile (1.8). The ignition transformer (1.6) typically produces a voltage in excess of 10 KV to breakdown the air gap of the spark plug. The resistance of the air-gap falls to around 50 ohms once the arc strikes. At this point the current is limited only by the impedance of the Ignition transformer and most of the energy is dissipated in the Ignition Transformer itself. The angle of advance, which is the position of the piston with respect to Top Dead Centre (TDC), measured in angular degrees, at which the ignition is initiated, is a fixed value irrespective of engine speed. The signal conditioning circuit (1.5) is used to filter out the effect of EMI and noise from the signal obtained from magnetic pick up (1.4). Typically the spark duration is a short 100-200 microseconds and the spark gap current is 20-30 mA. Such an arrangement is generally suitable for small engine running with a rich fuel-air mixture.<br>
All the energy stored in the capacitor (=CV2/2) is discharged through the ignition coil by an electronic switch with in a very short time. The ignition coil and the capacitor forms a LC circuit producing a damped oscillatory current for few cycles.<br>
Figure 2 shows a preferred embodiment of a CDI system according to the present invention.<br>
A DC voltage of 225V is derived by a DC-DC converter (2.3) form 12V battery (7V-12V) (2.2), which is charged by regulator supplied by engine mounted alternator (2.1). The DC-DC converter gives stable voltage irrespective of the speed of engine where as the output voltage from conventional engine mounted magneto is speed dependant.<br>
This voltage is used to supply a Power converter (2.4) using a new topology. The voltage supplied by the DC-DC converter is typically in the range of 120V- 400V, the actual value being dependant on the rating of the Ignition Coil (2.9) used. This voltage powers up the Power converter (2.4). A Micro-controller (2.7) is used to generate the control signal for the power converter. The microcontroller supply is derived from the battery through a low drop regulator (2.5) while speed signal conditioning circuit (2.6) is directly powered by battery with adequate filter to suppress noise.<br>
A ROM (2.8) stores ignition profile data used by the microcontroller (2.7) to generate the signals for controlling Power Converter (2.4) in relation to the speed / position signal received from the sensor (2.9) mounted on the crankshaft (2.10), after signal conditioning by signal conditioning circuit (2.6). The Power Converter (2.4) charges and discharges Ignition Capacitor (2.11) through the primary of Ignition coil (2.9) under control of the microcontroller (2.7). The Power Converter (2.4) is such that ignition current is produced during both the charging and discharging of the Ignition Capacitor (2.11) resulting in a continuous spark of any desired duration.<br>
Figure 3 shows the diagrammatic representation of timing of Ignition with respect to top dead center of a single cylinder engine. A positive and negative sinusoidal pulse is obtained at the output of the variable reluctor sensor (3.1) with every revolution of the engine. The width and dimension of the pulses depends on the physical dimension of the sensor. The sensor is generally mounted at 5 - 10 degrees ahead of top dead center. Apart from Speed the sensor signal also provides the current position of the piston (3.2).<br>
The compressed fuel-air mixture is generally ignited before the piston moves to the Top Dead Center (TDC) in order to generate maximum thrust just after the piston moves away from TDC. This is generally measured in terms of degrees before TDC and known as angle of advance. In modern engine control system normally this is varied with engine speed in order to ensure complete combustion of fuel, fuel economy, production of less pollutants (nitrogen dioxide, Hydrocarbons, Carbon monoxide etc.).<br>
A sample ignition profile is shown in fig. 3a. This profile is user defined. Only the points of inflexion (comer points) of the ignition profiles are stored. Other points are calculated along the straight line of the profile. Engine speed along with acceleration /deceleration, throttle position other operating conditions can be used to compute the actual angle of advance. It is also possible to store multiple such profiles and one of these can be selected dynamically depending on other factors like throttle position etc. Throttle position can be sensed by a suitably mounted potentiometer. DC-DC converter output voltage can also be sensed by Analog to Digital converter of the microcontroller for finer adjustments.<br>
Figure 3b depicts the typical input output signals from the microcontroller for both conventional and extended spark operation of the CDI system of the instant invention in a single cylinder engine. Figure 3b i), ii) and iii) show the input signals from the speed / position sensor before and after signal conditioning. Fig 3b v) shows multiple output pulses for ignition of prolonged duration while fig 3b iv) shows single pulse output suitable for conventional CDI operation. The firmware can generate both angle of advance or retardation to fulfill user defined Ignition profile.<br>
The ignition current can be made continuous for any ignition duration. The DC-DC converter should have sufficient power capability to supply the total energy required for the maximum ignition duration. The DC-DC converter can also be replaced by an engine mounted alternator (most of the conventional system already use one.). An ignition pulse from Microcontroller is synchronized with the speed/position pulses with a programmable angle of advance (or retardation). Firmware is developed to ignore noise at speed/position sensing port.<br>
The new Power Converter Topology used for generating spark for prolong duration is shown in fig. 4. The ignition circuit comprises of Ignition Capacitor (4.1) connected in series with the primary of ignition coil (4.2), while the other end is of capacitor connected to the mid point of series combination of two controllable power electronic switches. S+ (4.3) and S-(4.4) realized by two IGBTs. However, MOSFETs / BJTs can also be used. The collector (drain) of the Top switch S+ (4.3) is connected to positive (4.5) of DC-DC converter (or rectified output from engine mounted permanent magnet alternator). The emitter (source) of S- (4.4) is connected to the negative terminal (4.6) of DC-DC converter and the other end of ignition coil is connected to common ground. The control terminals of the switches are driven by Half bridge Driver (such as ST's L6384) (4.7) controlled by microcontroller programmed to switch them alternatively at a particular piston position depending on the speed of engine. The ignition duration is also programmed to be a function of engine speed.<br>
Each of the Power devices S+ (4.3) and S- (4.4) turns ON if there is a proper voltage at gate with respect to the emitter of the device. However the voltage of emitter of S+ (4.3) is floating. The half bridge driver has the capability to switch both top and Bottom device with<br>
out any isolated supply. It derives its own power supply (Vcc) by means of an internal zener anch has an bootstrap arrangement for generating supply voltage for the floating HVG driver. The capacitors CB (4.8), Cd (4.9) and Resistor Ra (4.10) and Rclamp (4.11) are required for operation of the Half Bridge. Different set of components may be required if a different half bridge driver is used.<br>
Ignition Signal (4.12) is fed to pin3 (IN) of the Half Bridge Drive (4.7) through a low pass filter made of resistor capacitor combination of Rf (4.13) and Cf (4.14). The use of this filter is optional. The HVG driver output of L6384 is in phase with input at IN pin while LVG driver output is out of phase.<br>
The alternative switching of the devices, with a small dead time (1-4 microsecond), causes damped oscillatory ignition current charging and discharging current in capacitor and ignition coil primary resulting in ignition current in the spark plug connected to the ignition coil secondary.<br>
The ignition current is shown in fig. 4a. The current is series of damped sinusoid. The oscillatory current waveforms shown in fig. 4a are repetitive and are caused by alternative charging and discharging of the Capacitor caused by corresponding to switching of top and bottom IGBTs as explained in fig 4a. Thus, unlike conventional system the capacitor need not be charged to start ignition.<br>
A train of such ignition current makes the spark extendable to any length of time. The topology also facilitates production of multi-spark with any delay between sparks<br>
Peak current of this LC oscillation is determined by total circuit resistance, while the time period of oscillation is determined by Leq*C ,where Leq is the equivalent inductance of the coil. Negative peak of the current is caused by discharge of C through the bottom IGBT. Oscillation damps out due to energy consumption of Spark plug and the coil. Immediately after the discharge oscillation dies out, the top IGBT (s+) is turned on causing a fresh oscillation and extending the spark duration. The Supply (e.g. DC_DC converter) should be stiff enough to start the fresh oscillation cycle.<br>
WaVeform in fig. 4a shows that spark gap current flows practically for whole duration. Once the arc strikes the air ionizes thus the air gap resistance falls enabling the current to oscillate even though the output voltage across air-gap falls. It can be observed that fresh cycle of oscillation can also be started even before the previous oscillation has not damped out. As for example, the discharge cycle can also be started at t =  or 3 instead of t = T(= 5 ) to increase the r.m.s. value of the current wave form. This can also be used to fine-tune the total ignition duration.<br>
The ignition duration can also be controlled by turning off corresponding switch when a oscillation is in progress. However, this can be preferably done at zero crossing of ignition current when the capacitor is totally charged or discharged.<br>
The conventional ignition coil used does not have isolation between primary and secondary. The merit of the topology is that it does not require the isolation. If a<br>
Figure 5 shows equivalent circuits used for a quantitative analysis.<br>
The ignition coil can be modeled as a step-up transformer and the spark plug as a Resistive load, which switches on if the voltage is sufficiently large and remains on till the voltage across air-gap becomes steady at zero. The equivalent circuit of the spark plug and ignition coil is shown in fig 5a. R'arc is arc resistance referred to primary of coil. The approximate equivalent circuit of Ignition coil is shown in fig 5b. Fig 5c shows the equivalent circuit for the circuit with the coil.<br>
There are two cases of switching:<br>
The capacitor is not charged; i.e. Vc = 0 and top-switch closes resulting in charging current<br>
(fig 5d).<br>
The capacitor is charged; i.e. Vc=Vdc and bottom switch closes setting a discharging current (fig5e).<br>
The mesh equations are :<br>

Figure 6 shows the converter output and ignition current waveform determined experimentally for duration of 14ms. This burst of ignition current is positioned at a predetermined angle of advance with respect to top dead center. Fig. 6a shows the expanded view of output voltage and current. The Waveforms show the ability of the topology to produce ignition current for prolonged duration .The ignition current is also similar to the Primary current. It is evident from fig. 6a that the ignition current is continuous during the whole duration; fresh cycle of oscillation begins before the previous cycle dies down.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
