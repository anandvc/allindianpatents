TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a washing machine having a water purifying device capable of removing<br>
free chlorine contained in the water or washing liquid supplied into the washing tub.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Conventionally, the technology for removing<br>
free chlorine in 		<br><br>
tap water to be supplied into the washing machine is disclosed, for example, in Japanese Laid-open Patent 2-136170, Japanese Laid-open Patent 6-154474, and Japanese Laid-open Patent 6-238092.<br>
What is disclosed in Japanese Laid-open Patent 2-136170 is shown in Fig. 17, in which an internal hose 3 is connected to a water feed valve 2 connected to a water feed hose 1, a water feed route changeover unit 4 is connected to this internal hose 3, and a free chlorine removing device 5 incorporating a cartridge (not shown) filled with free chlorine removing agent is passed through this water feed route changeover unit 4, so that tap water being rid of free chlorine is supplied into the water tub from a water feed port 6.<br>
What is disclosed in, Japanese Laid-open Patent 6-154474 is shown in Fig. 18, in which a water feed hose 1 is connected to a twin water feed valve 7, a free chlorine removing device 10 incorporating a cartridge 9 filled with a free chlorine removing agent 8 is connected to one side of this twin water feed valve 7, tap water entering from an inlet 11 of the free chlorine removing device 10 is passed through the free chlorine removing agent 8 to flow out from an outlet 12, and the tap water being rid of free chlorine is supplied into the water tub through a water feed port 6.<br>
What is disclosed in Japanese Laid-open Patent 6-238092 is shown in Fig. 19, in which a filter case 13a containing a cartridge 13 filled with a free chlorine removing agent 8 is detachably disposed like a drawer in a water feed route for feeding water<br>
-2-<br><br>
through an internal hose 3 connected to a water feed valve 2, and when the filter case 13a is attached, tap water being rid of free chlorine is supplied into the water tub.<br>
[Problems that the Invention Is to Solve]<br>
In the constitution disclosed in Japanese Laid-open Patent 2-136170 and Japanese Laid-open Patent 6-154474, in order to supply tap water being rid of free chlorine into the water tub, it is necessary to change over the water feed route completely, pass all feed water through the loaded free chlorine removing agent, and apply water pressure for passing through the densely loaded free chlorine removing agent.<br>
In the cartridge system using reducing agent, the reducing agent was mainly composed of powder of calcium sulfite having a reducing action, and granules of binder such as ethyl cellulose hardly soluble in water. As a result, the principle of reaction mechanism was the reaction of free chlorine by contacting with the granular surface of calcium sulfite.<br>
In the composition filled with granules, water permeable portions and less water permeable portions are likely to be formed, and when water pressure is applied, the water permeable portions react with more free chlorine than other portions and are hence consumed, and a short pass is caused while leaving many active ingredients unused to cause leak of free chlorine, thereby terminating the service life.<br>
In the cartridge using activated carbon, the flow rate<br>
-3-<br><br>
drop occurs due to clogging by foreign matter contained in tap water, while the flow velocity passing through the activated carbon increases to exceed the adsorption capacity, and the free chlorine leaks out gradually, thereby shortening the life.<br>
In any case, the user cannot visually check the life of the reducing agent from outside, and it is required to notice by predicting the life from the number of times of use.<br>
In the constitution disclosed in Japanese Laid-open Patent 6-238092, in order to feed tap water being rid of free chlorine into the water tub, it is required to have a high contact efficiency (wide contact area) with tap water in the case of hardly soluble, reducing agent to remove free chlorine contained in tap water in the portion containing the filter case 13a having the cartridge 13. Hence, the contact area decreases gradually during use, and similarly the user cannot know the life from outside, and it is necessary to notice by predicting the life from the number of times of use.<br>
In the case of easily soluble reducing agent, it was impossible to supply a specified amount of reducing agent into the tap water in all steps from washing step to rinsing step. If an excessive reducing agent is present in the washing liquid, the color and pattern fabric (dye) may be discolored by the reducing action, and hence it is required to control at a nearly specified amount of elution.<br>
Besides, the reducing agent requires replacement or repair<br><br><br>
                                -4-<br><br>
depending on the use, and to fill the washing machine with the reducing agent, ease of filling and operation is needed, and it is also important that the loaded reducing agent may be used stably.<br>
The invention is to solve the above problems, and it is hence an object thereof to present a washing machine capable of dispersing or dissolving a predetermined specific amount of reducing agent in tap water or washing liquid, inducing oxidizing and reducing reaction of reducing agent and free chlorine completely and quickly to remove, and preventing discoloration of color and pattern (dye), yellowing of silk, and oxidation of textile surface processing material of organic system due to oxidizing action of free chlorine contained in tap water.<br>
[Means of Solving the Problems]<br>
To achieve the object, the invention provides a washing machine comprising a compartment for accommodating a reducing agent for reducing free chlorine contained in water, and a water treating device having a lid for opening and closing the compartment, wherein feed water from water feeding means is poured into a washing tub through the water treating device.<br>
Accordingly, it is capable of dispersing or dissolving a predetermined specific amount of reducing agent in tap water or washing liquid, inducing oxidizing and reducing reaction of reducing agent and free chlorine completely and quickly to remove, and preventing discoloration of color and pattern (dye), yellowing of silk, and oxidation of textile surface processing material of<br>
-5-<br><br>
organic system due to oxidizing action of free chlorine contained <br>
in tap water.	<br>
[Embodiments]	<br>
The invention relates to a washing machine comprising a water treating device having a compartment for accommodating a reducing agent for reducing free chlorine contained in water and a lid for opening and closing the compartment, wherein feed water from water feeding means is poured into a washing tub through the water treating device, and therefore it is not necessary to change over the water feed route completely or apply water pressure to the cartridge, or high contact efficiency with tap water is not required, and it is capable of dispersing or dissolving a predetermined specific amount of reducing agent in tap water or washing liquid, inducing oxidizing and reducing reaction of reducing agent and free chlorine completely and quickly to remove, and preventing discoloration of color and pattern (dye), yellowing of silk, and oxidation of textile surface processing material of organic system due to oxidizing action of free chlorine contained <br>
in tap water.<br>
 In another embodiment of the invention <br><br>
the lid straightens the water supplied from the water feeding means into the compartment, and feeds water uniformly into the reducing agent, and therefore the state of feed water can be controlled by once impinging the feed water to the lid to mix with the reducing agent charged into the compartment, and the<br>
-6-<br><br>
controlled water is applied to the reducing agent, and eluted, so that the concentration of free chlorine in tap water poured into the washing tub can be suppressed below a specified value, <br><br>
The lid has a rib for straightening and<br>
distributing the water supplied from the water feeding means, and therefore the state of feed water can be controlled by impinging the feed water to the lid to mix with the reducing agent charged into the compartment, and the concentration of free chlorine in tap water poured into the washing tub can be stably suppressed below a specified value, and moreover by the rib provided in the lid, the dissolved state of the reducing agent may be uniform, and the tap water can be treated stably if used for a repeated number of <br><br>
The lid can substantially<br>
 in a<br>
dome shape, and water supplied into the compartment from the water feeding means is sprinkled by impinging against the nearly dome-shaped central portion of the inside of the lid, and therefore while the reducing agent is charged into the compartment, the feed water is impinged once against the dome-shaped lid to suppress disturbance of water by water pressure, thereby stabilizing the feed water state, and the concentration of free chlorine in the tap water supplied into the washing tub can be suppressed below a specified value stably even in the state of high water pressure, and the dissolved<br>
-7-<br><br>
state of the reducing agent can be made uniform, <br><br>
The invention relates to a washing wherein a water feed port is disposed nearly in the center of the compartment, and the water from the water feeding means is supplied into the compartment through this water feed port, and therefore sprinkling of water into the reducing agent may be made uniform from the center by directing the feed water state specifically in an upward direction, and the concentration of free chlorine in tap water poured into the washing tub may be stably suppressed below a specified value, and the reducing agent can be dissolved progressively from the center, and the tap water can be treated stably if used repeatedly, and the dissolved state of the reducing agent can be stabilized. <br>
The invention relates to a washing machine wherein a hole or a notch is formed in part of the reducing agent, and the water feed port of the water supplied from the water feeding means into the compartment is designed to communicate with the hole or notch to supply water, and therefore the water feed route can be simplified by disposing the water feed port of the water feed route for the reducing agent charged into the compartment nearly in the center of the compartment, and disposing the reducing agent away from the water feed port, so that maintenance of the reducing agent may be done easily only by opening the lid, and moreover the concentration of free chlorine in tap water can be stably suppressed below a specific value, and the<br><br><br>
-8-<br><br>
reducing agent can be dissolved uniformly from the center, and the tap water can be treated stably if used repeatedly, and still more the dissolved state of the reducing agent can be dissolved from the center.<br>
The invention relates to a washing<br><br>
machine a holding unit for<br>
holding the reducing agent freely in the compartment is disposed<br>
in the compartment, and therefore the holding unit disposed in the<br>
compartment prevents changes such as vibration, move or inclination,<br>
or unstable state of the reducing agent due to feed water, and<br>
uneven wear or crack of reducing agent is avoided, and the concen<br>
tration of free chlorine in tap water can be suppressed below a<br>
specific value.	<br>
The invention 8 relates to a washing <br><br>
machine comprising a case for covering the<br>
 reducing agent, wherein the holding unit is freely fitted to part of the case, and therefore by holding part of the case for covering the reducing agent by the holding unit, the free fitting portion of the reducing agent is prevented from being deformed, cut or broken, and the concentration of the free chlorine in the tap water can be suppressed further stably below a specific value. The invention relates to a washing<br><br>
 machine wherein a water feed port for supplying water from the water feeding means into the compartment is formed in the<br>
free fitting portion of the holding unit and the case, and therefore<br><br>
-9-<br><br>
the volume of the reducing agent in the compartment can be expanded by simplifying the structure of the compartment, so that the free chlorine in tap water can be treated for a long period. <br>
The invention relates to a washing machine further comprising means for preventing insertion of the reducing agent in wrong direction when inserting the reducing agent into the compartment, and therefore if the reducing agent is specified in upper and lower direction, for example, dissolving may not be stable due to contact or interference of the holding unit for freely fitting the reducing agent provided in the compartment and the case for covering the reducing agent depending on the inserting direction of the compartment, but by preventing insertion of the reducing agent in the direction where dissolving is not stable, the reducing agent can be inserted into the position where the reducing agent is dissolved stably in the water feed route if the reducing agent is exchanged, so that the<br>
free chlorine in tap water may be treated stably. <br><br>
The invention relates to a washing<br>
machine further comprising water feed control means for controlling the feed amount of the water supplied into the compartment, and lid opening detecting means for detecting whether the lid is open or closed, wherein the water feed amount into the compartment is decreased, the water feed pressure is lowered, or water feed is stopped when the lid opening detecting means detects the lid open state, and therefore water feed into<br>
-10-<br><br>
the compartment is limited or stopped when opening of the lid is detected by the lid opening detecting means, and water leak out of the compartment is prevented when the lid is opened during water feed due to shortage of reducing agent, when the lid is opened due to application of an abnormal water pressure, or when the lid is opened due to other trouble, so that the safety may be enhanced.<br>
The invention relates to a washing<br>
machine further comprising water feed<br>
control means for controlling the feed amount'of water supplied into the compartment, wherein the water feed control means changes the feed amount of water depending on the degree of closing of the lid, and therefore without means for detecting whether the lid is open or closed, water feed into the compartment is automatically limited or stopped by making use of water pressure of feed water into the<br>
compartment when the lid is open, and water leak out of the compartment is prevented when the lid is opened during water feed due to shortage of reducing agent, when the lid is opened due to application of an abnormal water pressure, or when the lid is opened due to other trouble, so that the safety may be enhanced, and it is<br>
The invention relates to a washing machine wherein the water feed control means controls the water feed into the compartment by means operating regardless of feed water pressure such as spring, motor and magnet, and decreases the water feed amount, lowers the water feed pressure, or stops<br><br><br>
-11-<br><br>
water feed when the lid is opened, and therefore water feed into the<br>
compartment is automatically limited or stopped, regardless of the<br>
water pressure, when the lid is open, and water leak out of the<br>
compartment is prevented, if the water pressure is low, when the lid<br>
is opened during water feed due to shortage of reducing agent, or<br>
when the lid is opened due to other trouble, so that the safety may<br>
be enhanced, and it is also presented at low cost. <br>
The invention relates to a washing <br>
machine wherein a drain port for<br>
discharging treated water is provided in the compartment, and a<br>
filter for removing powder, chips, impurities and other foreign<br>
matter from the reducing agent is disposed in the drain port, and<br>
therefore if dust adhering to the reducing agent, broken chips of<br>
the reducing agent, rust in the water feed route, and others are<br>
mixed in the washing tub while washing is done, the foreign matter<br>
recognized on the clothes after washing can be removed in the<br>
compartment.	<br><br>
The invention relates to a washing machine wherein part or whole of the lid is formed of transparent or translucent material, so that the state of the reducing agent may be visually checked from outside of. the compartment, and therefore the consumed state of the reducing agent can be visually checked from outside while the lid is being closed, and discoloring of color and pattern fabric or yellowing of silk due to continued use while the reducing agent is used up can be<br><br>
-12-<br><br>
suppressed, so that refilling or replacement of reducing agent or other maintenance can be done at an adequate timing.<br>
[Examples]<br>
Referring now to the drawings, embodiments of the invention are described in detail below.<br>
(Example 1)<br>
As shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, a reducing agent 14 is for reducing free chlorine contained in water, and it is mainly composed of calcium sulfite, and is bonded by a binder slowly soluble in water, and this reducing agent 14 is put in a compartment 15, and a lid 16 is put on this compartment 15 by a screw 17 so as to be free to open and close, thereby constituting a water treating device 18. A water feed port 19 is disposed in the compartment 15, and this water feed port 19 communicates with water feed valve (water feed means) 21 through a water feed route 20 so that water may be supplied from above the reducing agent 14. Beneath the reducing agent 14, a drain port 22 is provided, and this drain port 22 communicates with the water feed port 23. This water treating device 18 is disposed above a washing and wringing tub (washing tub) 24.<br>
Describing the operation in this constitution, the reducing agent 14 is put into the compartment 15, the lid 16 is closed, the water feed valve 21 is opened, then the water is sprinkled above the reducing agent 14 from the water feed port 19 through the water feed route 20, and water is poured into the washing and wringing tub 24<br>
-13-<br><br>
from the water feed port 23 through the drain port 22 beneath the compartment 15.<br>
At this time, the binder in the reducing agent 14 is gradually dissolved into tap water, and a predetermined specific amount (for example, 1 to 3 ppm) of reducing agent 14, that is, fine particles of calcium sulfite will be dispersed and released. The fine particles of calcium sulfite dispersed and released into the tap water react by oxidation and reduction with free chlorine having oxidizing action in the tap water in the water feed port 23 and washing and wringing tub 24 from the surface of the reducing agent 14, thereby removing free chlorine. It hence prevents discoloration of color and pattern (dye), yellowing of silk, and oxidation of textile surface processing material of organic system due to oxidizing action of residual free chlorine contained in tap water.<br>
Thus, according to the embodiment, not necessary to change over the water feed route completely or apply water pressure to the cartridge, or not requiring high contact efficiency with tap water, a predetermined specific amount of the reducing agent 14 can be dispersed or dissolved in the tap water or washing liquid, and the reducing agent 14 and free chlorine in tap water are completely and promptly oxidized and reduced to remove, and it is possible to prevent discoloration of color and pattern (dye), yellowing of silk, and oxidation of textile surface processing material of organic system due to oxidizing action of free chlorine contained in tap water.<br>
-14-<br><br>
In the embodiment, meanwhile, the lid 16 is freely fitted to the compartment 15 by the screw 17, but as far as the compartment 15 can be covered, the screw 17 is not always necessary. Incidentally, the water treating device 17 is disposed above the washing and wringing tub 24, but as far as the tap water is sprinkled above the reducing agent 14 from the water feed port 19 by opening the water feed valve 21, it is not always necessary to be disposed above the washing and wringing tub 24. Or, instead of pouring the water treated by the reducing agent 14 into the washing and wringing tub 24, water may be also poured into a washing tub of a twin tub washing machine or the like. <br>
(Example 2)<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, the lid 16 straightens the water supplied from the water feed port 25 into the compartment 15 by impinging against the lid 16, and feeds water uniformly into the reducing agent 14. The other constitution is same as in example 1.<br>
Describing the operation in this constitution, feed water into the compartment 15 passes through the water feed route 20 from the water feed valve 21, and is injected toward the lid 16 from the feed water port 25, and is sprinkled above the reducing agent 14. After removing the free chlorine in the tap water by the reducing agent 14 by oxidizing and reducing reaction, the treated water is poured into the washing and wringing tub 24 from the water feed port 23 through the drain port 22 beneath the compartment .15.<br>
Thus, according to the embodiment, the state of feed water<br><br><br>
-15-<br><br>
can be controlled by once impinging the feed water to the reducing agent 14 against the lid 16, and the controlled water is eluted toward the reducing agent 14, so that the concentration of ir.ee chlorine in tap water poured into the washing and wringing tub 24<br>
can be suppressed below a specified value<br>
(Example 3)<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, a lid 26 has a rib 27 for straightening and distributing the water supplied from the water feed port 25 into the inner wall, and the water supplied into the compartment 15 from the water feed port 25 is impinged against the rib 27, and sprinkled above the reducing agent 14. The other constitution is same as in example 1 or 2.<br>
Describing the operation in this constitution, feed water into the compartment 15 passes through the water feed route 20 from the water feed valve 21, and is injected toward the lid 26 from the water feed port 25, and is sprinkled over the reducing agent 14. At this time, the feed water is uniformly sprinkled over the reducing agent 14 by the rib 27 provided in the inner wall of the lid 26, so that the dissolved state may be uniform. After removing the free chlorine in the tap water by the reducing agent 14 by oxidizing and reducing reaction, the treated water is poured into the washing and wringing tub 24 from the water feed port 23, through the drain port 22 beneath the compartment 15.<br>
Thus, according to the embodiment, the state of feed water can be controlled by impinging the feed water to the reducing agent<br><br><br>
-16-<br><br>
14 once to the lid 26. and the controlled water is eluted toward the reducing agent 14, so that the concentration of free chlorine in tap water poured into the washing and wringing tub 24 can be stably suppressed below a specified value, and moreover by the rib 27 provided in the lid 26, the dissolved state of the reducing agent 14 may be uniform, and the tap water can be treated stably if used for a repeated number of times.<br>
In this embodiment, incidentally, as the rib 27 provided in the inner wall of the lid 26, a rib shape in a sectional view is shown, but this rib 27 may be formed in various shapes, including concentric, radial and spiral shapes in the inner wall of the lid 26, but the effect is all the same in sprinkling,the tap water supplied from the water feed port 25 over the reducing agent 14 and dissolving uniformly. In short, it is not particularly limited as far as it can sprinkle water over the reducing agent 14 and dissolve uniformly.<br>
(Example 4)<br>
As shown in Fig. 5, a lid 28 is nearly in a dome shape, having a convex dome 29 formed nearly in the center of the top of the inner surface, and water supplied into the compartment 15 from the water feed port 25 is sprinkled over the reducing agent 14 by impinging against the central portion of the dome 29. The other constitution is same as in example 1 or 2.<br>
Describing the operation in this constitution, feed water into the compartment 15 passes through the water feed route 20 from<br><br><br><br>
-17-<br><br>
the water feed valve 21, and is injected toward the lid 28 from the water feed port 25, and is sprinkled over the reducing agent 14. At this time, disturbance of water is suppressed by the dome 29 provided nearly in the center of the inner surface of the lid 28, and water is stably sprinkled over the reducing agent 14 so as to be dissolved uniformly. After removing the free chlorine in the tap water by the reducing agent 14 by oxidizing and reducing reaction, the treated water is poured into the washing and wringing tub 24 from the water feed port 23, through the drain port 22 beneath the compartment 15.<br>
According to the embodiment, the feed water to the reducing agent 14 is impinged once against the dome-shaped lid 28 to suppress disturbance of water by water pressure, thereby stabilizing the feed water state, and the concentration of free chlorine in the tap water supplied into the washing and wringing tub 24 can be suppressed below a specified value stably even in the state of high water pressure, and the dissolved state can be made uniform. Therefore the tap water can be treated stably if used repeatedly.<br>
(Example 5)<br>
As shown in Fig. 6. a water feed port 30 is disposed nearly in the center of the compartment 15, and the water from the water feed valve 21 is supplied into the compartment 15 through this water feed port 30. The other constitution is same as in example 1.<br>
Describing the operation in this constitution, the feed water into the compartment 15 passes through the water feed route<br><br><br>
-18-<br><br>
20 from the water feed valve 21, and is injected toward the lid 16 through the water feed port 30 disposed nearly in the center of the compartment 15. Injected water is sprinkled nearly concentrically over the reducing agent 14, and the dissolved state of the reducing agent 14 may be uniform. After removing the free chlorine in the tap water by the reducing agent 14 by oxidizing and reducing reaction, the treated water is poured into the washing and wringing tub 24 from the water feed port 23, through the drain port 22 beneath the compartment 15.<br>
According to the embodiment, since the water feed port 30 to the reducing agent 14 charged into the compartment 15 is disposed nearly in the center of the compartment 15, sprinkling of water into the reducing agent 14 may be made uniform from the center by directing the feed water state specifically in an upward direction, and the concentration of free chlorine in tap water poured into the washing and wringing tub 24 may be stably suppressed below a specified value, and the reducing agent 14 can be dissolved progressively from the center, and the tap water can be treated stably if used repeatedly, and the dissolved state of the reducing agent 14 can be stabilized.<br>

-19-<br><br>
supply water. The other constitution is same as in example 1.<br>
Describing the operation in this constitution, the feed water into the compartment 15 passes through the water feed route 20 from the water feed valve 21, and is injected toward the lid 16 through the water feed port 33 communicating with the hole 32 in the reducing agent 31. Injected water is sprinkled nearly concentrically over the reducing agent 31, and the dissolved state of the reducing agent 31 may be uniform. After removing the free chlorine in the tap water by the reducing agent 31 by oxidizing and reducing reaction, the treated water is poured into the washing and wringing tub 24 from the water feed port 23. through the drain port 22 beneath the compartment 15.<br>
According to the embodiment, the water feed route can be simplified by disposing the water feed port 33 of the water feed route for the reducing agent 31 charged into the compartment 15 nearly in the center of the compartment 15, and disposing the reducing agent 31 away from the water feed port 33, so that maintenance of the reducing agent 31 may be done easily only by opening the lid 16, and moreover the concentration of free chlorine in tap water can be stably suppressed below a specific value, and the reducing agent 31 can be dissolved uniformly from the center, and the tap water can be treated stably if used repeatedly, and still more the dissolved state of the reducing agent 31 can be dissolved from the center.<br>
Incidentally, in this embodiment, the reducing agent 31 is in a doughnut shape, but the circumferential shape of the reducing<br><br><br>
-20-<br><br>
agent may be also polygonal, or the central hole may be polygonal, or, as shown in Fig. 7 (c), the effect is same when a notch 34 is provided to be formed like a crescent as far as the reducing agent 31 is accessed only by opening the lid 16 for maintenance.<br>
(Example 7)<br>
As shown in Fig. 8 (a), (b), a holding unit 35 for holding the reducing agent 31 freely in the compartment 15 is disposed in the compartment 15. The other constitution is same as in example 6.<br>

At this time, since the reducing agent 31 is held by the holding unit 35, unstable state of the reducing agent 31 by changes such as vibration, move and inclination can be prevented, and uneven wear or crack of the reducing agent 31 may be eliminated.<br>
Injected water is sprinkled nearly concentrically over the reducing agent 31, and the dissolved state of the reducing agent 31 may be uniform. After removing the free chlorine in the tap water by the reducing agent 31 by oxidizing and reducing reaction, the treated water is poured into the washing and wringing tub 24 from the water feed port 23, through the drain port 22 beneath the compartment 15.<br>
According to the embodiment, the holding unit 35 disposed in the compartment 15 prevents changes such as vibration, move or<br><br><br>
-21-<br><br>
inclination, or unstable state of the reducing agent 31 due to feed water, and uneven wear or crack of reducing agent 31 is avoided, and the concentration of free chlorine in tap water can be suppressed below a specific value, and the tap water can be treated stably if used repeatedly.<br>
In the embodiment, the hole 32 is provided in the center of the reducing agent 31 to be formed like a doughnut, and the water feed port 33 communicates with the hole 32 to supply water, but it may be similarly disposed by using the reducing agent 14 in examples 1 to 5.<br>
(Example 8)<br>
As shown in Fig. 9 (a), (b), a case 36 is formed for covering the reducing agent 31, and the holding unit 35 is freely fitted to part of the case 36. The other constitution is same as in example 7.<br>
Describing the operation in this constitution, the feed water into the compartment 15 passes through the water feed route 20 from the water feed valve 21, and is injected toward the lid 16 through the water feed port 33 communicating with the hole 32 in the reducing agent 31. At this time, since the reducing agent 31 is held by the holding unit 35 through the case 36, the free fitting portion of the reducing agent 31 is not deformed, cut or broken, and unstable state of the reducing agent 31 by changes such as vibration, move and inclination due to feed water can be prevented, and uneven wear or crack of the reducing agent 31 may be eliminated.<br><br><br><br>
-22-<br><br>
According to the embodiment, by holding part of the case 36 for covering the reducing agent 31 by the holding unit 35, the free fitting portion of the reducing agent 31 is prevented from being deformed, cut or broken, and the concentration of the free chlorine in the tap water can be suppressed further stably below a specific value.<br>
(Example 9)<br>
As shown in Fig. 10, a case 38 having the reducing agent 31 inside is provided in the compartment 15. At the bottom of the case 38, a held portion 39 is provided, and the held portion 39 is freely fitted and supported by the holding part 37 provided in the compartment 15. The held portion 39 is also communicated to a water feed port 40 for supplying water into the compartment 15. The other constitution is same as in example 7 or 8.<br>

At this time, since the reducing agent 31 is held by the holding unit 37 which supports the held portion 39 formed in the case 38, the reducing agent 31 is prevented from being in unstable state due to changes such as vibration, move and inclination due to feed water and uneven wear or crack of the reducing agent 31 may be eliminated.<br>
According to the embodiment, the volume of the reducing agent 31 in the compartment 15 can be expanded by simplifying the structure of the compartment 15, by communicating the held portion 39....<br>

supporting the case 38 for covering the reducing agent 31 in the water feed port 40, so that the free chlorine in tap water can be treated for a long period.<br>
(Example 10)<br>
As shown in Fig. 11 (a), (b). a holding unit 41 for freely fitting the reducing agent 31 is provided in the compartment 15, and part of a case 43 for covering a reducing agent 42 is used as a held portion 44, which is supported by the holding unit 41. The holding unit 41 and the held portion 44 have a specific inclination, and as shown in Fig. 11 (b), the case 43 containing the reducing agent 42 can be inserted in the compartment 15 in one specified direction only. The other constitution is same as in examples 6 to 9.<br>
Describing the operation in this constitution, when putting the reducing agent 42 into the compartment 15, the holding unit 41 provided in the compartment 15 and the held portion 44 of the case 43 for covering the reducing agent 42 contact or interfere with each other, and the case 43 containing the reducing agent 42 cannot be inserted in a direction where the reducing agent 42 cannot be dissolved stably, and hence if the reducing agent 42 is exchanged, its wrong insertion can be prevented, and the free chlorine in tap water can be treated stably.<br>
According to the embodiment, if the reducing agent 42 is specified in upper and lower direction, for example, the reducing agent 42 cannot be inserted in a direction where dissolving may not be stable due to contact or interference of the holding unit<br><br><br>
-24-<br><br>
41 provided in the compartment 15 and the case 43 for covering the reducing agent depending on the inserting direction into the compartment 15. and the reducing agent 42 can be inserted into the position where the reducing agent 42 is dissolved stably in the water feed route if the reducing agent 42 is exchanged, so that the free chlorine in tap water may be treated stably.<br><br>
In the embodiment, meanwhile, an example of prevention of insertion in wrong direction by an inclined surface is shown, but there are also other measures for prevention of insertion in wrong direction, such as interference by rib and interference by protrusion. The effects are same in the constitution designed to prevent insertion of the case 43 containing the reducing agent 42 into the compartment 15 unless inserted into stable dissolving direction.<br>
(Example 11)<br>
As shown in Fig. 12, a magnet 45 is disposed in part of the lid 16 for covering the compartment 15, and a detector 46 for detecting the magnetic force of the magnet 45 is provided in part of the compartment 15. The detector 46 detects the position of the magnet 45 when the lid 16 is completely closed, and is designed to detect the closed state of the lid 16 by a detecting device 47. A stop valve 48 is provided in the water feed route 20, and is driven by a stop valve drive device 49. The other constitution is same as in example 6.<br>
Describing the operation in this constitution, when the<br><br>
-25-<br><br>
lid 16 is completely closed, the detector 46 detects the position of the magnet 45, and the closed state of the lid 16 is detected by the detecting device 47, and the stop valve 48 provided in the water feed route 2.0 is opened. Therefore, the feed water into the compartment 15 passes through the water feed route 20 from the water feed valve 21. and is injected toward the lid 16 through the water feed port 33. Injected water is sprinkled nearly concentrically over the reducing agent 31, and the dissolved state of the reducing agent 31 may be uniform. After removing the free chlorine in the tap water by the reducing agent 31 by oxidizing and reducing reaction, the treated water is poured into the washing and wringing tub 24 from the water feed port 23. through the drain port 22 beneath the compartment 15.<br>
When the lid 16 is open, the position of the magnet 45 is detected, and the open state of the lid 16 is detected by the detecting device 47, and feed water into the compartment 15 is limited or stopped by the stop valve 48 provided in the water feed route 20.<br>
Thus, in the invention, the detector 46 detects the position of the magnet 45 when the lid 16 is completely closed, and the closed state of the lid 16 is detected by the detecting device 47. and the stop valve 48 provided in the water feed route 20 is opened, or when the lid 16 is open, water feed into the compartment 15 ,is limited or stopped by the stop valve 48, and therefore water leak out of the compartment 15 is prevented when the lid 16 is opened<br><br><br>
-26-<br><br>
during water feed due to shortage of reducing agent 31, when the lid 16 is opened due to application of an abnormal water pressure, or when the lid 16 is opened due to other trouble, so that the safety may be enhanced.<br>
Meanwhile, in the embodiment, the means for detecting the open state of the lid 16 is composed by the magnet 45 and the detector 46 for detecting the magnetic force of the magnet 45, but there are other means for detecting the open state of the lid 16, such as mechanical switch and photo sensor, and they are equal in the effects of detecting the open state of the lid 16 of the compartment 15, and limiting or stopping water feed into the compartment 15 so as not to allow water to escape from the compartment 15.<br>

When the lid 50 is not closed completely, the pushing distance of the water feed controller 51 in the lid 50 to the valve control rod 52<br><br><br>
-27-<br><br>
is short, and the stop valve 53 is pushed up by the pressure of the tap water from the water feed route 20.<br>
When the lid 50 is further opened, as shown in Fig. 13 (b), the stop valve 53 finally closed the water feed route 20. Thus, without having means for detecting open or closed state of the lid 50, when the lid 50 is open, the stop valve 53 can be automatically closed by making use of the water pressure of the feed water into the compartment 15. and the feed water into the compartment 15 can be limited or stopped.<br>
Thus, according to the invention, by varying the water feed amount depending on the opening degree of the lid 50 by means of the water feed controller 51 provided in the lid 50 and the stop valve 53 provided near the water feed port 33 of the compartment 15 through the valve control rod 52, without means for detecting whether the lid 50 is open or closed, water feed into the compartment 15 is automatically limited or stopped by making use of water pressure of feed water into the compartment 15 when the lid is open, and therefore water leak out of the compartment 15 is prevented when the lid 50 is opened during water feed due to shortage of reducing agent 31, when the lid 50 is opened due to application of an abnormal water pressure, or when the lid 50 is opened due to other trouble, so that the safety may be enhanced, and it is also presented at low cost.<br>

The valve control rod 52 is always applied a force in the stop valve 53 closing direction by a spring 54. The other constitution is same as in example 12.<br>
Describing the operation in this constitution, as shown in Fig. 14 (a), when the lid 50 is closed, the water feed controller 51 of the lid 50 pushes the valve control rod 52, and supplies tap water from the water feed route 20 into the compartment 15. When the lid 50 is not closed completely, the pushing distance of the water feed controller 51 in the lid 50 to the valve control rod 52 is short, and the stop valve 53 is pushed up by the pressure of the tap water from the water feed route 20.<br>
When the lid 50 is (further opened, as shown in Fig. 14 (b), the stop valve 53 finally closed the water feed route 20. Thus, without having means for detecting open or closed state of the lid 50, when the lid 50 is open, the stop valve 53 can be automatically closed if the water pressure is low, and the feed water into the compartment 15 can be limited or stopped.<br>
Thus, according to the invention, by providing the water feed controller 51 in the lid 50 and applying a pressure to the stop valve 53 provided near the water feed port 33 of the compartment 15 through the valve control rod 52 in an always closing direction by the spring 54, when the lid 50 is open, water feed into the cotnpart<br><br><br>
-29-<br><br>
ment 15 is automatically limited or stopped even if the water pressure is low, and therefore water leak out of the compartment 15 is prevented when the lid 50 is opened during water feed due to shortage of reducing agent 31, when the lid 50 is opened due to application of an abnormal water pressure, or when the lid 50 is opened due to other trouble, so that the safety may be enhanced, and it is also presented at low cost.<br>
In the embodiment, it is designed to push up the stop valve 53 by the spring 54, but there are other methods for pushing up the stop valve 53, for example, the method making use of repulsive or attractive force of magnet, and the method using a motor, and the effects are same in limiting or stopping of water feed into the compartment 15 by automatically closing the stop valve 53 if the water pressure is low.<br>
(Example 14)<br>
As shown in Fig. 15 (a), the reducing agent 14 is put in<br><br>
the compartment 15, and the drain port 22 is provided beneath the reducing agent 14, and a filter 55 is provided above the drain port 22.

The other constitution is same as in example 1.<br>
Describing the operation in this constitution, by putting the reducing agent 14 into the compartment 15, and feeding water above the reducing agent 14 through the water feed port 19 with<br><br>
-30-<br><br>

At this time, if dust adhering to the reducing agent 14, broken chips of the reducing agent 14, rust in the water feed route (not shown), and others are mixed in the washing and wringing tub 24 while washing is done, the foreign matter recognized on the clothes after washing can be removed by the filter 55 in the compartment 15.<br>
In this embodiment, the filter 55 is an example of mesh type, but various forms of filter are present, including the felt, sponge and cotton form. The effects are same in the constitution for removing dust adhering to the reducing agent 14 or broken chips of reducing agent 14 in the compartment 15.<br>
(Example 15)<br>
As shown in Fig. 16, a lid 56 covers the compartment 15 containing the reducing agent 14, and a transparent portion 57 is formed in part. The other constitution is same as in example 1.<br>
By thus forming the transparent portion 57 in part of the lid 56, the consumed state of the reducing agent 14 can be visually checked from outside while the lid 56 is being closed, and discoloring of color and pattern fabric or yellowing of silk due to continued use while the reducing agent 14 is used up can be suppressed, so that refilling or replacement of reducing agent 14<br><br><br>
-31-<br><br>
or other maintenance can be done at an adequate timing.<br>
In the embodiment, the transparent portion 57 is formed in part of the lid 56, but it may be also translucent, or the entire lid 56 may be transparent or translucent.<br>

tap water.	<br><br>
According to the invention the lid straightens the water supplied from the water feeding means into the compartment, and feeds water uniformly into the reducing agent, and therefore the state of feed water can be controlled by once impinging the feed water to the lid to mix with the reducing agent charged into the compartment, and the controlled water is applied to the reducing agent, and eluted, so that the concentration of free chlor-<br>
-32-<br><br>
ine in tap water poured into the washing tub can be suppressed below a specified value.<br>
According to the invention the lid<br>
has a rib for straightening and distributing the water supplied from<br>
the water feeding means, and therefore the state of feed water can<br>
be controlled by impinging the feed water to the lid to mix with the<br>
reducing agent charged into the compartment, and the concentration<br>
of free chlorine in tap water poured into the washing tub can be<br>
stably suppressed below a specified value, and moreover by the rib<br>
provided in the lid, the dissolved state of the reducing agent may<br>
be uniform, and the tap water can be treated stably if used for a<br>
repeated number of times.	<br>
According to the invention the lid is nearly in a dome shape, and water supplied into the compartment from the water feeding means is sprinkled by impinging against the nearly dome-shaped central portion of the inside of the lid, and therefore while the reducing agent is charged into the compartment, the feed water is impinged once against the dome-shaped lid to suppress disturbance of water by water pressure, thereby stabilizing the feed water state, and the concentration of free chlorine in the tap water supplied into the washing tub can be suppressed below a specified value stably even in the state of high water pressure, and the dissolved state of the reducing agent can be made uniform.<br>
According to the invention a water feed port is disposed nearly in the center of the compartment, and<br>
-33-<br><br>
the water from the water feeding means is supplied into the compartment through this water feed port, and therefore sprinkling of water into the reducing agent may be made uniform from the center by directing the feed water state specifically in an upward direction, and the concentration of free chlorine in tap water poured into the washing tub may be stably suppressed below a specified value, and the reducing agent can be dissolved progressively from the center, and the tap water can be treated stably if used repeatedly, and the dissolved state of the reducing agent can be stabilized. <br>

or a notch is formed in part of the reducing agent, and the water<br>
feed port of the water supplied from the water feeding means into<br>
the compartment is designed to communicate with the hole or notch to<br>
supply water, and therefore the water feed route can be simplified<br>
by disposing the water feed port of the water feed route for the<br>
reducing agent charged into the compartment nearly in the center of<br>
the compartment, and disposing the reducing agent away from the<br>
water feed port, so that maintenance of the reducing agent may be<br>
done easily only by opening the lid, and moreover the concentration<br>
of free chlorine in tap water can be stably suppressed below a<br>
specific value, and the reducing agent can be dissolved uniformly<br>
from the center, and the tap water can be treated stably if used<br>
repeatedly, and still more the dissolved state of the reducing agent<br>
can be dissolved from the center.	<br>
According to the invention hold-<br><br><br>
-34-<br><br>
ing unit for holding the reducing agent freely in the compartment is<br>
disposed in the compartment, and therefore the holding unit disposed<br>
in the compartment prevents changes such as vibration, move or<br>
inclination, or unstable state of the reducing agent due to feed<br>
water, and uneven wear or crack of reducing agent is avoided, and<br>
the concentration of free chlorine in tap water can be suppressed<br>
below a specific value.	<br>
According to the invention which<br>
further comprises a case for covering the reducing agent, wherein<br>
the holding unit is freely fitted to part of the case, and therefore<br>
by holding part of the case for covering the reducing agent by the<br>
holding unit, the free fitting portion of the reducing agent is<br>
prevented from being deformed, cut or broken, and the concentration<br>
of the free chlorine in the tap water can be suppressed further<br>
stably below a specific value.	<br>
According to the invention a water<br><br>
feed port for supplying water from the water feeding means into the<br>
compartment is formed in the free fitting portion of the holding<br>
unit and the case, and therefore the volume of the reducing agent in<br>
the compartment can be expanded by simplifying the structure of the<br>
compartment, so that the free chlorine in tap water can be treated<br>
for a long period.	<br>
According to the invention which further comprises means for preventing insertion of the reducing agent in wrong direction when inserting the reducing agent into the<br>
-35-<br><br>
compartment, and therefore if the reducing agent is specified in upper and lower direction, for example, dissolving may not be stable due to contact or interference of the holding unit for freely fitting the reducing agent provided in the compartment and the case for covering the reducing agent depending on the inserting direction of the compartment, but by preventing insertion of the reducing agent in the direction where dissolving is not stable, the reducing agent can be inserted into the position where the reducing agent is dissolved stably in the water feed route if the reducing agent is exchanged, so that the free chlorine in tap water may be treated<br>
According to the invention which further comprises water feed control means for controlling the feed . amount of the water supplied into the compartment, and lid opening detecting means for detecting whether the lid is open or closed, wherein the water feed amount into the compartment is decreased, the water feed pressure is lowered, or water feed is stopped when the lid opening detecting means detects the lid open state, and therefore water feed into the compartment is limited or stopped when opening of the lid is detected by the lid opening detecting means, and water leak out of the compartment is prevented when the lid is opened during water feed due to shortage of reducing agent, when the lid is opened due to application of an abnormal water pressure, or when the lid is opened due to other trouble, so that the safety may be enhanced.<br><br><br>
-36-<br><br>
According to the invention which further comprises water feed control means for controlling the feed amount of water supplied into the compartment, wherein the water feed control means changes the feed amount of water depending on the degree of closing of the lid, and therefore without means for detecting whether the lid is open or closed, water feed into the compartment is automatically limited or stopped by making use of water pressure of feed water into the compartment when the lid is open, and water leak out of the compartment is prevented when the lid is opened during water feed due to shortage of reducing agent, when the lid is opened due to application of an abnormal water pressure, or when the lid is opened due to other trouble, so that the safety may be enhanced, and it is also presented at low cost. According to the invention the water feed control means controls the water feed into the compartment by means operating regardless of feed water pressure such as spring, motor and magnet, and decreases the water feed amount, lowers the water feed pressure, or stops water feed when the lid is opened, and therefore water feed into the compartment is automatically limited or stopped, regardless of the water pressure, when the lid is open, and water leak out of the compartment is prevented, if the water pressure is low, when the lid is opened during water feed due to shortage of reducing agent, or when the lid is opened due to other trouble, so that the safety may be enhanced, and it is also presented at low cost.<br><br><br><br>

of the reducing agent, rust in the water feed route, and others are<br>
mixed in the washing tub while washing is done, the foreign matter<br>
recognized on the clothes after washing can be removed in the<br>
compartment.	<br>
According to the invention part or whole of the lid is formed of transparent or translucent material, so that the state of the reducing agent may be visually checked from outside of the compartment, and therefore the consumed state of the reducing agent can be visually checked from outside while the lid is being closed, and discoloring of color and pattern fabric or yellowing of silk due to continued use while the reducing agent is used up can be suppressed, so that refilling or replacement of reducing agent or other maintenance can be done at an adequate timing.
