Introduction<br>
This invention relates to novel xanthone compounds, their preparation and use as a<br>
medicament. More particularly this invention is directed to the isolation of the novel<br>
xanthone natural product sootepenseone from Dasymaschalon sootepense Craib,<br>
Annonaceae, its identification and derivatization, and the use of sootepenseone and<br>
its derivatives as anticanoer aoents.<br>
Field of Invention<br>
Cancer is perhaps one of the most active anti-human factor operating in the world<br>
today, and efforts are being made all over the scientific world to prevent and<br>
eradicate it.<br>
New agents with chemotherapeutic value in the fight against cancer is obviously a<br>
medical problem of high importance. But the development of new drugs in the cancer<br>
field is a difficult task given that anticancer agents must be lethal to, or incapacitate<br>
tumor cells, but they should not cause excessive damage to normal cells. At present<br>
the state of knowledge in cancer biology and in medical chemistry does not warrant<br>
the designing of new classes of molecules which may be effective antitumor agents.<br>
Despite the great progress made in cancer biology, molecular pharmacology,<br>
pharmacokinetics, medical chemistry and allied fields, the knowledge sought after, is<br>
still elusive.<br>
Since the concept of chemotherapeutic treatment of malignant diseases had come to<br>
the forefront during the last decades, plant principles and their derivatives have<br>
been intensively investigated by scientists all over the world as new antitumor<br>
inhibitors. Examples for important anticancer agents of plant origins are the alkaloids<br>
vincaleukoblastine (vinblastine) and leurocristine (vincristine), both isolated from<br>
Catharanthus roseus. A comprehensive review on natural products as anticancer<br>
agents is given by Shradha Sinha and Audha Jain, in: Progess in Drug Research,<br>
Vol. 42. pages 53-132 (1994) Basel (Switzerland).<br>

or are each hydrogen [-C17H-C18H(CH3)2],<br>
Or a tautomer, an aiantiomcr, an stereoisomer or a physiologically<br>
acceptable salt or a solvate thereof or mixtures thereof.<br>
In the case of a compound according to formula 1 above in the form of a<br>
phenolate with a di-or multivalent counter cation, the remaining position<br>
charge can be compensated by association with a physiologically acceptable<br>
anion such as Cl-or OH-.<br>
Accordingly to another aspect of the invention there is provided a process<br>
for manufacturing a compound according to formula 1 by isolation of<br>
sootepenseone (1) from the leaves of Dasymaschalon sootepenseone Craib,<br>
Annonaoeae and its subsequent derivatization.<br>
The present invention further provides the use of the compounds according<br>
to formula (1) as medicament in particular for the treatment of cancer<br>
diseases.<br>
The present invention further provides pharmaceutical formulations, comprising an<br>
effective amount of a compound according to formula (I) for treating a patient in need<br>
thereof. As used herein, an effective amount of a compound according to formula (I)<br>
is defined as the amount of the compound which, upon administration to a patient,<br>
inhibits growth of tumor cells, kills malignant cells, reduces the volume or size of the<br>
tumors or eliminates the tumor entirely in the treated patient.<br>
Thus, the substantially pure compounds in accordance with the invention can be<br>
formulated into dosage forms using pharmaceutically acceptable carriers for oral,<br>
topical or parenteral administration to patients in need of oncolytic therapy.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the patient is a mammal, in particular a human.<br>
The effective amount to be administered to a patient is typically based on body<br>
surface area, patient weight, and patient condition. The interrelationship of dosages<br>
for animals or humans (based on milligrams per meter squared of body surface) is<br>
described by Freireich, E.J. et a!.. Cancer Chemother. Rep., 50 (4) 219 (1966). Body<br>
surface area may be approximately determined from patient height and weight (see<br>
e.g. Scientific Tables, Geigy Pharmaceuticals, Ardly, N.Y., pages 537-538 (1970)).<br>
Preferred dose levels will also depend on the attending physicians assessment of<br>
both the nature of the patient's particular cancerous condition and the overall<br>
physical condition of the patient. Effective antitumor doses of the present xanthone<br>
compounds range from 1 microgram per kilogram to about 5000 micrograms per<br>
kilogram of patient body weightmilligram, more preferably between 2 micrograms to<br>
about 1000 micrograms per kilogram of patient body weight.<br>
Effective doses will also vary, as recognized by those skilled in the art, dependant<br>
on route of administration, excipient usage and the posibility of co-usage with other<br>
therapeutic treatments including other anti-tumor agents, and radiation therapy.<br>
The present pharmaceutical formulation may be administered intravenous,<br>
intramuscular, intradermal. subcutaneous, intraperitoneally, topical, or intravenous in<br>
the form of a liposome.<br>
Examples of dosage forms include aqueous solutions of the active agent, in an<br>
isotonic saline, 5% glucose or other well-known pharmaceutically acceptable liquid<br>
carrier. Additional sofubilizing agents well-known to those familiar with the art can be<br>
utilized as pharmaceutical excipients for delivery of the active agent. Alternatively,<br>
the present compounds can be chemically modified to enhance water solubility, for<br>
example, by formation of pharmaceutically acceptable phenolate salts.<br>
The present compounds can also be formulated into dosage forms for other routes of<br>
administration utilizing well known methods. The pharmaceutical compositions can<br>
be formulated, for example, in dosage forms for oral administration in a capsule, a<br>
get seal or a tablet Capsules may comprise any well-known pharmaoeutically<br>
acceptable material such as gelatin or cellulose derivatives. Tablets may be<br>
formulated in accordance with conventional procedure by compressing mixtures of<br>
the active agent and solid carriers, and lubricants well-known to those familiar with<br>
the art. Examples of solid carriers include starch, sugar, bentonite. The compounds<br>
of the present invention can also be administered in a form of a hard shell tablet or<br>
capsule containing for example, lactose or mannitol as a binder and a conventional<br>
fillers and tableting agents.<br>
The terms "effective amount" and "effective dose" as referring to the treatment of<br>
animals is defined herein to mean those quantities of alkaloid which will cause<br>
remession or inhibition of growth of the cancer disease in the animal to which it is<br>
administered, without imparting an (intolerable toxic response. The effective amount<br>
may vary with the way of administration, the administration schedule, the kind of<br>
tumor, and other related factors, all of which may be varied without departing from<br>
the scope or operativeness of the invention. Generally an effective dose would be<br>
one within the range of about 0.001-100.0 mg/kg of body weight/day.<br>
The terms "cancer" or "tumor" as used herein include, but are in no way limited to,<br>
adrenocarcinomas, glioblastomas (and other brain tumors), breast, cervical,<br>
colorectal, endometrial, gastric, liver, lung (small cell and non-small cell), lymphomas<br>
(including non-hodgkin's, Burkitt's, diffuse large cell,, follicular and diffuse<br>
Hodgkin's), melanoma (metastatic), neuroblastoma, osteogenic sarcoma, ovarian,<br>
retinoblastoma, soft tissue sarcomas, testicular and other tumors which respond to<br>
chemotherapy.<br>
Other objects and advantages of the invention will become readily apparent from the<br>
ensuing description.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
The inventive compounds according to formula (I) have a pentacyclic xanthone ring<br>
system (see for a review. Sultanbawa, M.U.S., Xanthonoids of tropical plants,<br>
Tetrahedron 36 (1960) 1465-1506). The following natural compounds are reported<br>
as having a simitar ring system:<br>
Gambooic acid (2). isolated from Garcinia hanburyi (see Amorosa, M. et al., Ann.<br>
Chim. (Rome), 1966, 56, 232; Ahmad, A.S. et al., J. Chem. Soc. (C), 1966, 772<br>
(structure); Amone, A. et al., Tetr. Lett., 1967, 4201 (pmr data, structure), morellin<br>
(3) isolated from Garcinia morella (see: Rao, B.S., J. Chem. Soc, 1937, 853<br>
(isolation); Kartha, G. et al., Tetr. Lett.. 1963, 459 (cryst. structure)); Nair, P.M. et al.,<br>
Indian J. Chem., 1964, 2, 402 (structure)), hanburin (4) isolated from Garcinia<br>
hanburyi (see: Asano, J. et al., Phytochemistry, 1996, 41, 815 (isolation, uv, ir, pmr,<br>
cmr data) and forbesione (5) isolated from Garcinia forbesii (see: Yuan-Wah eong,<br>
Leslie J. Harrison, Graham J. Bennett and Hugh T.-W. Tan, J. Chem. Research (S)<br>
1996, 392-393).<br>
These compounds have at C-5 an isoprenyl side chain in common with a hydrogen<br>
bonded phenolic hydroxy group. Morellin (3) and gambogic acid (2) have a<br>
chromene ring system in common. All compounds (2) to (5) have in common a<br>
bicyclo{2.2.2)octene carbon skeleton fused to a 2,2-dimethyl-tetrahydrofuran ring<br>
system (see fig. 1).<br>
However, these compounds show significant structural differences as compared to<br>
the compounds according to formula 1 of the present invention:<br>
1.) the C-5 isoprenyl side chain is oxidized to an aldehyde as in (3) or to a<br>
carboxyclic acid as in (2);<br>
2.) the condensed dihydrofuran ring in 3,4-position is missing as in (4) or instead a<br>
pyranone ring is present in the 2,3-position as in (3)<br>
3.) the ring system is substituted with an additional isoprenyl side chain at C-5 as in<br>
(3) and (5)<br>
By contrast, the compounds of the present invention contain fully substituted<br>
dihydrofuran rings except at carbon 2', fused to the modified xanthone ring system.<br>
For the taxonomy of Dasymaschalon sootepense Craib see V.H. Heywood,<br>
"Flowering Plants of the World", University Press, Oxford, 1978.<br>
Surprisingly, the compounds of the present invention show remarkable antitumor<br>
activity. Moreover, the present compounds have a low toxicity.<br>
Thus the xanthone compounds according to the present invention are new and<br>
involve an inventive step.<br>
The structures of (2) to (5) are summarized below:<br>
Example 1<br>
Isolation of sootepenseone (1; VR-3016, 0-25637) from Dasymaschalon sooteoense<br>
Plant material has been collected in November 1994 in Doitung, Chiangrai province,<br>
northern Thailand. Leaves were air sun dried (about 30-35'C) for three days and<br>
stored in a cloth bag. Dry powdered leaves (6.4 kg) of D. sootepense were<br>
sequentially extracted with hexane (110 litre), chloroform (107 litre) and methanol<br>
(180 litre) to give the corresponding crude extracts in 204.2, 192.7 and 1187.0 gm,<br>
respectively. The crude methanol extract was further partitioned with ethyl<br>
acetate(12 litre)-water(4.35 litre) and n-butanol(10 litre)-water to give ethyl acetate,<br>
n-butanol and water fractions in 103.6, 388.7 and 401.8 gm, respectively.<br>
The ethyl acetate fraction (100 gm) was chromatographed on silica gel (Merck no.<br>
7734,1.62 kg, the extract was premixed with 180 g of the silica gel), editing with<br>
mixtures of hexane-ethyl acetate and ethyl acetate-methanol. Fractions (300 ml,<br>
each) were combined on the basis of TLC to give a total of 19 fractions (F1 to F19).<br>
Fractions F7 (1.10 g) and F8 (0.84 gm) eluting with 7-8 % ethyl acetate-hexane, were<br>
repeatedly chromatographed on silica gel employing hexane-ethyl acetate as eluting<br>
solvents. The fraction eiuted with 30% ethyl acetate-hexane gave a light yellow solid<br>
which was further purified by radial chromatography (silica gel, 20% ethyl acetate-<br>
hexane) and recrystallization from methylene chloride-methanol to give VR-3016<br>
(0.2373 gm). The mother liquor was purified by HPLC (methylene chloride), followed<br>
recrystallization in the same solvent to give additional 0.1103 g of VR-3016. The<br>
compound has been identified as a new modified xanthone derivative, which has<br>
been given the name sootepenseone 1, on the basis of spectral data and single<br>
crystal x-ray diffraction analysis.<br>

The described isolation procedure is summarized in scheme 1.<br>
Characterization of the structure of sootepenseone (1)<br>
The identity of sootepenseone was revealed by analysis of its spectral data i.e. the<br>
infrared spectrum, ultraviolet spectrum, mass spectrum and particularly the 1H n.m.r<br>
and 13C n.m.r spectra.<br>
Relative stereochemistry:<br>
The relative stereochemistry of sootepenseone (1) has been confirmed by single<br>
crystal x-ray diffraction analysis. Hence the absolute configuration is either the<br>
stereochemistry as depicted below<br>
or the corresponding enantiomeric form thereof. The relative stereochemistry as<br>
depicted above for sootepenseone (1) is also valid for the sootepenseone<br>
derivatives according to formula (I), except for those derivatives where inversion or<br>
racemization occured under the selected reaction conditions at one or more of the<br>
chiral centers at C-5, C-7, C-10a, C-12 and C-22.<br>
Preparation of the compounds 6 to 13 can be accomplished starting from<br>
sootepenseone (1) by organic chemistry standard derivatization procedures which<br>
are well-known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
Example 2<br>
Preparation of 1-O-Acetyl-sootepenseone (6)<br>
A solution of 1 mg of sootepensione (1) in 1ml anhydrous acetic acid anhydride was<br>
stirred at room temperature for 1 h. The solvent was evaporated in a water bath<br>
under reduced pressure. Yield: 1 mg of (6) as a crude residue.<br>
For example, salts of sootepenseone (7) can be prepared according to methods and<br>
reagents as described in Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie<br>
(methods in organic chemistry), 4th edition 1963, volume 6/2,<br>
"Sauerstoffverbindungen I (oxygen compounds I), part 2", pages 35 ff.<br>
So, for example, one eqivalent of a suitable base can be reacted with one equivalent<br>
of sootepenseone in a suitable solvent and then evaporating off the solvent or<br>
filtrating off the precipitated salt (7). A suitable base, for example, can be selected<br>
from the group consisting of alkali or earth alkali hydroxides or an organic amine.<br>
Methylation of the OH-group (compound no. 9) can be accomplished starting from<br>
sootepenseone (1) with diazomethan in analogy to the method as described by<br>
Mustafa; Hishmat; JOCEAH; J.Org.Chem.; 22; 1957; 1644, 1646.<br>
Acylation of the OH-group (compounds no. 6, 8, 11 and 12) can be accomplished *<br>
starting from sootepenseone (1) in analogy to the method and reagents as described<br>
in Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie (methods in organic<br>
chemistry), 4th edition 1985. volume E5, "CarbonsSuren und Carbonsaure-Derivate<br>
(carboxyclic acids and their derivatives)", pages 691 ff.<br>
Alkylation of the OH-group at C-1 (compound no. 10) can be accomplished starting<br>
from sootepenseone (1) in analogy to the standard procedures and by using<br>
standard reagents as described in Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen<br>
Chemie (methods in organic chemistry), 4th edition, volume VI/3,<br>
"Sauerstoffverbindungen (oxygen compounds), part 3", Georg Thieme Veriag<br>
Stuttgart, 1965, pages 49 ff.<br>
Hydrogenation of the isoprenyl C17-C18 double bound to the Cf7-C17 single bound<br>
(wherein R2 and R3 in the formula (I) are each a hydrogen atom; compound no. 13)<br>
can be performed by standard procedures as described for example in Houben-<br>
Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie (methods in organic chemistry), 4th<br>
edition, volume IV/1c, "Reduktion (reduction), part I", Georg Thieme Veriag Stuttgart,<br>
1981, pages 15 ff.<br>
Biological activity<br>
The compound according to the invention are less toxic than the standard<br>
compounds (see table 1). On the other hand, sootepenseone (1; D-25637) is more<br>
active in the hollow-fiber test as the standard compounds (see table 3).<br><br>
Discussion of the results:<br>
Sootepenseone is at teast 100 times less toxic than Actinomycin O, about 16 times<br>
less toxic than Vinblastin, and 60% and 20% less toxic than Adriamycin resp.<br>
Bleomycin.<br>
2. In vitro antitumor activity (XTT proliferation/cytotoxicity test)<br>
The XTT-assay was carried out as described by D.A. Scudiero et al., Cancer Res<br>
48 (September 1, 1988), pp. 4827-4833. The results of this procedure are expressed<br>
as that dose which inhibits growth by 50% as compared to control growth after 45<br>
hours following application of the substance. The dose value as obtained is referred<br>
to as ED 50 and activity is indicated for ED 50 levels of 
ED 50 level, the more active is the test material. The activities of sootepenseone (1)<br>
obtained in Example 1 ore reported below in Table 2.<br>
3. In vivo antitumor activity of sootepenseone (D-25637) (hollow fiber assay)<br>
The hollow-fiber test was carried out as described by Melinda G. Holiingshead et al.<br>
in Life Sciences, Vol. 57, No. 2, pp. 131-141,1995. The results are shown in table 3.<br>
Discussion of the results:<br>
D-25637 is more active (49% inhibition) against the KB tumor cell line than<br>
Vinblastin (13%) and Actinomycin D (40%), and nearly as active as Bleomycin<br>
(53%). Moreover, against the MCF-7 cell line D-25637 showed an as strong<br>
anticancer activity (41%) as adriamycin, while Actinomycin D, Bleomycin and<br>
Vinblastin enhanced tumor growth (negative inhibition values indicate increase in<br>
cell growth compared to untreated control group).<br>
