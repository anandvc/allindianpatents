The insecticidal incense composition of the present invention thus obtained can be used according to a conventional manner. That is, the insecticidal incense composition of the present invention can be smoked at a habitat of noxious insects (e.g., mosquitoes, flies, etc.) or in the vicinity thereof such as inside a room, etc. As burning the insecticidal incense composition, the effective component, a compound, (1), is volatilized and scattered, thereby controlling noxious insects.<br>
The following Production Example, Comparative Example and Test Example further illustrate the present invention in detail but are not to be construed to limit the scope of<br><br>
the present invention.   In the following Examples, all "parts" are by weight unless otherwise stated. Production Example<br>
(1)	An EC for producing an insecticidal incense<br>
composition (hereinafter referred to as the emulsion A) was<br>
obtained by mixing 5 parts of 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-4~<br>
methoxymethylbenzyl	(1R)-trans-3-(1-propenyl)-2,2-<br>
dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate (the ratio of geometric<br>
isomers of 1-propenyl group: Z/E=about 8/1); a mixture of<br>
4.5 parts of calcium alkylbenzene sulfonate, 4.5 parts of<br>
polyoxyalkylene alkyl ether and 6 parts of an aromatic<br>
solvent (mixture of Newkalgen 155A manufactured by Takemoto<br>
Oil &amp; Fat Co., Ltd./Newkalgen 155F manufactured by Takemoto<br>
Oil &amp; Fat Co., Ltd. = 2/1); and 80 parts of an alkylbenzene<br>
(Mitsubishi  Soft  Alkylbenzene  SAB-G  manufactured  by Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation).<br>
(2)	A diluted EC for producing an insecticidal incense<br>
composition was prepared by mixing 0.1 part of the EC A<br>
with 49.9 pars of water. Fifty parts of the diluted EC was<br>
mixed with 15 parts of pyre thrum marc, 15 parts of wood<br>
flour, 2 0 parts of tabu-no-ki tree powder and 10 parts of<br>
water.   The resultant mixture was  thoroughly kneaded,<br>
followed by molding and drying (at 4 0 °C for 6 hours) to<br>
obtain  the  desired  insecticidal  incense  composition<br>
(hereinafter referred to as the composition 1 of the<br><br>
present invention).<br>
Comparative Example<br>
An insecticidal incense composition (hereinafter<br>
referred to as the comparative composition) was obtained by<br>
mixing 10 mL of a 0.05% (w/v) solution of 2,3,5,6-<br>
tetrafluoro-4-methoxymethylbenzyl	(1R)-trans-3- (1-<br>
propenyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate (the ratio of geometric isomers of 1-propenyl group: Z/E=about 8/1) in acetone, 15 g of pyrethrum marc, 15 g of wood flour, 20 g of Siam glue and 60 mL of water, and thoroughly kneading the resultant mixture, followed by molding and drying (at<br>
40°C for 6 hours) . Test Example<br>
The efficacy of the insecticidal incense composition of the present invention will be illustrated by the following test.<br>
Ten female adult brown house mosquitoes (Cuiex pipiens pallens) were introduced into a glass tube of 4 cm inner diameter and 12 cm long. The both ends of the tube were covered with nylon nets of 16 mesh.<br>
On the other hand, a plastic transparent cylinder of 20 cm inner diameter and 30 cm high was mounted on a stainless cylinder of 20 cm inner diameter and 80 cm high. The above glass tube in which the mosquitoes were introduced was placed inside the plastic cylinder so that<br><br>
the lower end of the glass tube came to substantially the same level of the lower end of the plastic cylinder. Then, a composition to be tested which was stably burning was placed inside the bottom center of the stainless cylinder.<br>
After placing a composition to be tested inside the stainless cylinder, the number of knocked down mosquitoes were counted with time and, based on the results, time . required for knocking down 50% of the mosquitoes (KT50) and that required for knocking down 90% of the mosquitoes (KT90) were calculated.<br>
The results are shown in Table 1.<br><br>
As shown in Table 1, the composition 1 of the present invention knocked down 90% of mosquitoes in about 6 minutes. On the other hand, the comparative composition knocked down only 50% of mosquitoes even after about 7 minutes.<br>
Thus, it is clear that the insecticidal incense composition of the present invention exhibits superior efficacy.<br><br><br><br><br>
