Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to compounds and their salts specific to the PPAR<br>
receptors and the EGF receptors and their use in the medical field.<br>
Object of the Invention<br>
The compounds and their salts according to the present invention can be used<br>
advantageously for the prevention and treatment of tumours expressing the PPARγ<br>
receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors) and the EGF receptors<br>
(Epidermal Growth Factor receptors) such as tumours of the: oesophagus, stomach,<br>
pancreas, colon, prostate, breast, uterus and appendages, kidneys and lungs. Moreover,<br>
the compounds and their salts according to the invention can be used for the treatment<br>
of chronic inflammatory diseases, in particular chronic intestinal diseases, such as<br>
Crohn's disease and ulcerative rectocolitis.<br>
Background to the Invention<br>
The PPARγ receptors are nuclear receptors (group of approx. 50 transcription factors)<br>
which control the expression of many genes that are important for the regulation of lipid<br>
metabolism, the synthesis of insulin and the processes of carcinogenesis and<br>
inflammation (Bull AW, Arch Pathol Lab Med 2003;127: 1121-1123) (Koeffler HP, Clin<br>
Cancer Res 2003; 9: 1-9) (Youssef J et ai, J Biomed Biotec 2004; 3: 156-166).<br>
There are various natural and synthetic agonists which bind to the PPARy receptors and<br>
alter their conformation, giving rise to activation. Natural and synthetic ligands are<br>
described in The Lancet 2002; 360:1410-1418.<br>
Recent studies have shown that treatment of tumour cells with ligands of the PPARy<br>
receptors induces a decrease in cellular proliferation, cell differentiation and apoptosis,<br>
suggesting potential application of such compounds as agents for preventing<br>
carcinogenesis (Osawa E et al., Gastroenterology 2003; 124:361-367).<br><br>
Other studies have shown that ligands of the PPARγ receptors (e.g. troglitazone) have<br>
anti-inflammatory effects and inhibit the mucosal inflammatory response in animal<br>
models of IBD (Tanaka T et al., Cancer Res 2001; 61: 2424-2428).<br>
Moreover, evidence has been published very recently that the intestinal anti-<br>
inflammatory activity of 5-ASA (5-aminosalicylic acid, mesalazine), the gold standard in<br>
the treatment of IBD, is dependent on binding, and consequent activation, of the PPARγ<br>
receptors (Rousseaux C et al., J Exp Med 2005; 201: 1205-1215).<br>
The transmembrane receptor with tyrosine-kinase EGF activity is expressed to a very<br>
high degree in activated form in various types of neoplasms (Mendelsohn J, Endocr<br>
Relat Cancer 2001; 8: 3-9) (Harari PM, Endocr Relat Cancer 2004; 11: 689-708).<br>
Overexpression of the receptor is also related to potential ability of carcinomatous cells<br>
to metastasize. In connection to this, it has been demonstrated that EGF promotes the<br>
migration and invasiveness of various cell types connected with lesions at the level of<br>
interactions with the extracellular matrix (Brunton et al., Oncogene 1997; 14: 283-293).<br>
Numerous studies performed both on experimental animals and in man have established<br>
the efficacy of inhibitors of the EGF receptor in controlling proliferation and the spread of<br>
tumours (Mendelsohn J, Endocr Relat Cancer 2001; 8: 3-9) (Harari PM, Endocr Relat<br>
Cancer 2004; 11: 689-708).<br>
There is no doubt that the intracellular signals triggered by activation of the EGF receptor<br>
facilitate the growth and survival of neoplastic cells, contributing to the development of<br>
the pathology, and that such signals are essential in determining the ability of tumour<br>
cells to spread and colonize remote organs (Mendelsohn J, Endocr Relat Cancer 2001;<br>
8: 3-9) (Kari C et a/., Cancer Res 2003; 63:1-5).<br>
From the foregoing and bearing in mind, moreover, that from the biological standpoint,<br>
chronic inflammatory processes play a part in carcinogenesis, it becomes clear that there<br>
is a real need for innovative research into new chemical entities which, by their<br>
complementary action both on the PPARγ receptors and on the EGF receptors, are able<br><br>
to exert anti-inflammatory and anti-tumour action, of the chemo-preventive, anti-<br>
proliferative and anti-metastatic type.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel and inventive medical and therapeutic uses of a<br>
series of compounds In so far as any of these compounds are not known, the invention<br>
also relates to these compounds.<br>
The present invention provides a novel class of compounds that are suitable for the<br>
prevention and treatment of cancer and of chronic inflammation by the modulation of<br>
specific receptors such as the PPARγ receptors and the EGF receptors.<br>
Therefore the present invention relates specifically to the compounds of general formula<br>
(i)<br><br>
in which<br>
R1 and R2, which may be identical or different, are selected from the group comprising H,<br>
-CnH2n-1, a linear or branched alkyl group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, or together<br>
form an aromatic or aliphatic ring with 5 or 6 atoms;<br>
R3 is selected from -CO-CH, -NHOH, -OH, -OR6 in which R6 is a linear or branched alkyl<br>
group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms;<br>
R4 is selected from H, a linear or branched alkyl group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms,<br>
phenyl, benzyl, -CF3 or -CF2CF3, vinyl or allyl; R5, R7, R8 are hydrogen atoms;<br>
or<br>
R3 and R4, R4 and R5, or R7 and R8 together form a ring, fused to the benzene, aromatic<br>
or aliphatic ring with 5 or 6 atoms comprising from 1 to 2 heteroatoms selected<br>
independently from the group comprising N, O.<br><br>
The invention also relates to the specific subgroup of compounds of general formula (la)<br><br>
in which<br>
R1 and R2, which may be identical or different, are selected from the group comprising H,<br>

together form an aromatic or aliphatic ring with 5 or 6 atoms;<br>
R3 is selected from -NHOH, -OH, -OR6 in which R6 is a linear or branched alkyl group<br>
having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms;<br>
R4 is selected from -H, a linear or branched alkyl group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms;<br>

The molecules of the present invention were derived from molecular modeling work<br>
using mesalazine as a basis and all chemically feasible variations were evaluated in<br>
order to achieve the best score (affinity and activation of the receptor) in computer<br>
docking experiments. Consequently, it is believed that the compounds of the present<br>
invention that show comparable function and/or activity to mesalazine do so through<br>
similar biological pathways. It is believed that similar characteristics to mesalazine<br>
inherent in the molecules of the invention confer upon the molecules a similar activity in<br>
relation to the EGF pathway.<br>
The experiments given herein make good models for use in the prediction of the use of<br>
the compounds in the various medical fields already discussed. The models used give<br>
meaningful resulto regardless of the mechanism of action.<br>

use of the following compounds (compound number follows prefix "2_"):<br><br><br><br>
The present invention will now be described for purposes of illustration, but without<br><br>
limiting it, according to its preferred embodiments, with particular reference to the<br>
diagrams in the appended drawings.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings and Table<br>
Figure 1A shows the structures of compounds 13,14, 17, 26, 31 and 38.<br>
Figure 1B shows the activation of the PPARγ receptors by molecules 17 and 31 relative<br>
to cells treated with 5-ASA and rosiglitazone. The HT-29 STD cells transfected with the<br>
response element for PPARγ (2XCYP) and treated with molecules 17 and 31 (30mM)<br>
show induction of about twice the activity of the reporter gene indicating the capacity of<br>
5-ASA and novel compounds 17 and 31 to induce activation of the PPARγ; the results<br>
are expressed as factor of increase in activation (mean ± SEM) relative to the untreated<br>
cells. The activations for compounds 13, 14, 26 and 38 are also shown.<br>
Figure 2 shows the increase in expression of the PPARγ protein by the epithelial cells<br>
induced by compounds 17, 26 and 31; the level of expression of the PPARγ protein was<br>
evaluated by western blot in untreated HT-29 cells (control) and after 24 hours of<br>
treatment with the novel compounds or 5-ASA (30mM) or rosiglitazone (10-5M) used as<br>
positive controls. The values of optical density of the PPARγ were calculated for each<br>
condition in proportion to the quantity of the β-actin internal control in the same sample.<br>
Figure 3 shows the inhibition of proliferation of epithelial cells by compounds 17 and 31;<br>
similarly to 5-ASA (30mM) and to rosiglitazone (10-5M), compounds 17 and 31 inhibit<br>
proliferation of the HT-29 STD cells, tested by staining with nuclear Ki-67 (light grey)<br>
relative to the cells incubated with the culture medium only (control); the nuclei were<br>
stained blue (dark grey in figure) with Hoechst 33342 solution; the results are expressed<br>
as average number of cells counted in one experiment.<br>
Figure 4 shows the induction of apoptosis of epithelial cells by compound 31; similarly to<br>
5-ASA (30mM) and rosiglitazone (10-5M), molecule 31 induced apoptosis identified in the<br>
TUN EL assay in HT-29 STD cells. Spontaneous apoptosis of 3% was observed in the<br>
untreated HT-29 cells; the results are expressed as average number of cells counted in<br>
one experiment.<br><br>
Figure 5 shows docking simulation of the manner of binding of various compounds to the<br>

50psi for 1.5hr, then filtered through celite, and the celite washed with 2M NaOH<br>
(200ml). The MeOH was removed in vacuo and the resulting aqueous residue washed<br>
with MTBE (100ml). The pH of the aqueous was lowered to 7 by the careful addition of<br>

(25ml). The solid that didn't dissolve was filtered off, washed with a minimum quantity of<br>
IPA and dried in vacuo. The two crops of solid were suspended in H2O (300ml) and the<br>
pH was lowered to 2 by careful addition of concentrated HCI. The solid was filtered off,<br>

reflux. After 1hr more acetone (30ml) was added, and the reaction was heated at reflux<br>
for 48hrs. The reaction was cooled to RT and the volatiles were removed in vacuo. The<br>
resulting brown oil was dissolved in CH2CI2 (400ml) and washed with 1:1 H2O/saturated<br><br>
NaHCO3 (400ml). The aqueous phase was extracted with CH2CI2(2 x 200ml), and the<br>

reaction was stirred at RT overnight. The volatiles were removed in vacuo and the<br>
residue treated with EtOAc (50ml). The solids that didn't dissolve were removed by<br><br>

EXAMPLE 8<br>
Study on the effects of new compounds according to the invention on PPARγ<br>
activation/expression and regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis<br>
MATERIALS AND METHODS<br>
Compounds<br>
5-ASA was purchased at Sigma-Aldrich™ (St Quentin Fallavier, France). Rosiglitazone<br>
was acquired at Spi Bio™ (Massy, France). The new molecules 13, 14, 17, 26, 31, 38<br>
(Figure 1A) were given by Giuliani SpA™ (Milano, Italy) and synthesized by SAFC<br>
Pharma™ (Manchester, England).<br>
Cell lines<br>
The colon carcinoma cell line HT-29 STD (ATCC HTB-38) was routinely grown in DMEM<br>
supplemented with 10% heat-FCS, and antibiotics. Cells were grown in monolayers,<br>
incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity.<br>
Transient transfection with PPARγ and stimulation of cells<br>
HT-29 STD cells were transiently transfected using the Effectene™ transfection reagent<br>
(Qiagen™) according to instructions from the manufacturer. To test PPARγ activation, we<br>
performed transfection with 500 ng of a minimal promoter construct containing two<br>
copies of PPRE obtained from the cytochrome p450 4A (2XCYP) (1). The renilla<br>
luciferase plasmid (0.1µg/well) was also transfected as an internal control for monitoring<br>
transfection efficiency and for normalizing the firefly luciferase activity. Transfected cells<br>
were left for 48 hours incubation at 37°C. Stimulations were performed after incubation<br>
of cells during 3-6-9-12-15-18-24 hours with the compounds 13,14, 17, 26, 31, 38 at a<br>
concentration of 30mM and compared with the two PPARγ synthetic ligands 5-ASA 30<br>
mM (2) and rosiglitazone 10-5 M (2) used as positive controls. The pH of the drug<br>
solutions was adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. Total cell extracts were prepared using the<br>
Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega™, Madison, Wis.). Luciferase activity was assayed in 20<br><br>
µl of the extract using the Promega™ Dual Luciferase assay system according to the<br>
manufacturer's protocol. Transfections were assayed in triplicate in at least three<br>
separate experiments. The luciferase activity was expressed as fold of the activity<br>
obtained in cells treated with the different molecules divided by luciferase activity from<br>
non-stimulated cells.<br>
Evaluation of PPARγ and β-actin by Western blot analysis<br>
The total proteins were obtained by cell homogenization in an extraction buffer consisting<br>
of PBS with 2% Triton™, Phenyl Methyl Sulphonyl Fluoride (PMSF) 100mM and a<br>
classical protease inhibitor cocktail (2). The total proteins were then separated by<br>
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotted. Polyvinylidendifluoride (PVDF)<br>
membranes were incubated overnight with rabbit polyclonal primary antibody directed<br>
against PPARγ (dilution 1/500, TEBU, Le Perray en Yveline, France), β-actin was<br>
detected using a rabbit monoclonal primary antibody diluted at 1/10,000 (Sigma).<br>
Immunodetection with a secondary peroxidase-conjugated antibody (1/1000, Dako™,<br>
Trappes, France) and chemiluminescence was performed according to the<br>
manufacturer's protocol (ECL™, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech™, Orsay, France).<br>
Optical density values of PPARγ were given for each condition in proportion to the<br>
quantity of the internal control β-actin in the same sample (2).<br>
Analysis of cell proliferation by Ki-67 immunostaining<br>
After 24h of culture, HT-29 STD cells were treated during 24h with the new molecules<br>
13, 14, 17, 26 and 31, at 30 mM. 5-ASA (30 mM) and rosiglitazone (10-5M) were used as<br>
positive controls. The molecule 38 (example 7) was not included in this experiment due<br>
to its poor solubility. The pH of the drug solutions was adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. Cells<br>
were fixed in PFA 4%, permeabilized in PBS containing 0.1 % Triton X-100™ at 4°C and<br>
then incubated with goat normal serum and blocking buffer (1% BSA in PBS) to minimize<br>
non-specific adsorption of the antibody.<br>
Cell proliferation was assessed by a nuclear Ki-67 staining using mouse monoclonal<br>
primary antibody directed against Ki-67 (dilution 1:50 overnight; ZYMED™,<br>
Clinisciences™, Montrouge, France). Primary antibody was revealed with Alexa 594<br>
donkey anti-mouse IgG conjugated to acridin red fluorochrome (dilution 1:100, Molecular<br>
Probes™, Invitrogen™, Cergy Pontoise, France). Nuclei were stained with Hoescht<br><br>
33342 solution (0.125 mg/mL) (Sigma-Aldrich™) and visualized under a fluorescence<br>
microscope (Leica™, Bensheim, Germany). Negative controls consisted of staining with<br>
a non-specific mouse serum instead of the specific antibody. Counts of at least 500<br>
cells/sample were systematically performed blindly in one experiment. The results were<br>
expressed as the mean ± SEM of the number of stained ceils.<br>
Detection of apoptosis<br>
After 24h of culture, HT-29 STD cells were treated during 24h with the new molecules<br>
13, 14, 17, 26 and 31, at a concentration of 30 mM. 5-ASA (30 mM) and rosiglitazone<br>
(10-5M) were used as positive controls. The molecules 17 and 38 (examples 3, 7) were<br>
not included in this experiment due to their poor solubility. The pH of the drug solutions<br>
was adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. Cells undergoing apoptosis were identified by enzymatic<br>
labelling of DNA strands using a terminal transferase dUTP nick end labelling assay<br>
(TUNEL assay, Roche Diagnostics™, Meylan, France). Counts of at least 500<br>
cells/sample were systematically performed blindly in one experiment. The results were<br>
expressed as the mean ± SEM of the number of stained cells.<br>
RESULTS<br>
It has been observed that the new molecules 17 (example 3) and 31 (example 6) induce<br>
PPARγ activation. Compound 26 (example 4) also induces PPARγ, but to a lesser<br>
extent. Activation of PPARγ results in a cascade of reactions leading to a binding to<br>
specific DNA sequence elements termed peroxisome proliferator response elements<br>
(PPRE) (7-9).<br>
We investigated PPARγ transcriptional activity by transient transfections of epithelial<br>
cells with the renilla luciferase PPRE plamids. Cells were stimulated with the different<br>
molecules during 24 hours. Analysis of PPARγ activity in transfected HT-29 cells showed<br>
that the new molecules 17 (example 3) and 31 (example 6) at a concentration of 30mM<br>
increased the reporter gene activity by two-fold thereby displaying an activity similar to 5-<br>
ASA and rosiglitazone (Figure 1B). Molecules 13, 14 and 38 (examples'1, 2, 7) at a<br>
concentration of 30mM exerted a rapid cytotoxic effect on epithelial cells limiting the<br>
investigation of PPARγ activation after 6 hours (Figure 1B).<br><br>
The new molecules 17, 26 and 31 induce PPARγ expression. The capacity of new<br>
molecules to induce PPARγ expression at the protein levels in the HT-29 cell line. A<br>
mean 2-fold induction of PPARγ protein levels quantified by western blot was observed<br>
in cells treated during 24 hours with the molecules 17, 26 and 31 (Figure 2).<br>
The new molecules 17 and 31 (examples 3 and 6) inhibit epithelial cell proliferation. We<br>
evaluated in HT-29 STD cell line the role of the new molecules in the regulation of cell<br>
proliferation (Figure 3). Cell proliferation was assessed by nuclear protein Ki-67 staining<br>
expressed in proliferating cells, the presence of Ki-67 being necessary to maintain cell<br>
proliferation (1O). Compared to untreated cells, incubation of HT-29 cells for 24h with the<br>
molecules 17 and 31 (30 mM) resulted in a 67 to 75% inhibition of cell proliferation<br>
(Figure 3). The cell proliferation effects of compound 26 were not tested, since it has a<br>
lesser effect as a PPAR-gamma activator.<br>
Similar results were obtained with the two positive controls rosiglitazone (10-5M) and 5-<br>
ASA (30 mM) used at their optimal concentrations. Demonstration of the potential anti-<br>
mitogenic effect of the molecules 13, 14 and 26 (examples 1, 2, 4) was limited by their<br>
rapid cytotoxic effects on epithelial cells at this concentration (data not shown).<br>
The new molecule 31 (example 6) induces epithelial cell apoptosis through PPARγ.<br>
Similarly to rosiglitazone and 5-ASA, the molecule 31 displayed apoptosis in 80% of<br>
epithelial cells identified by labelling DNA strand breaks using a terminal transferase<br>
dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) (Figure 4). Similarly to the previous experiment,<br>
molecules 13, 14 and 26 induced a rapid cytotoxic effect at 30mM impeding cell<br>
apoptosis analysis.<br>
EXAMPLE 9<br>
Study on the effects of new compounds on PPARγ activation<br>
MATERIALS AND METHODS<br>
Compounds<br>
5-ASA was purchased at Sigma-Aldrich™ (St Quentin Fallavier, France). The new<br>
molecules 13, 14, 17, 26, 28, 31, 38 (Figure 1A) were synthesized as described in<br>
examples 1-7.<br><br>
Cell lines<br>
The colon carcinoma cell line HT-29 STD (ATCC HTB-38) was routinely grown in DMEM<br>
supplemented with 10% heat-FCS, and antibiotics. Cells were grown in monolayers,<br>
incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity.<br>
Transient transfection with PPARγ and stimulation of cells<br>
HT-29 STD cells were transiently transfected using the Effectene™ transfection reagent<br>
(Qiagen™) according to instructions from the manufacturer. To test PPARγ activation, we<br>
performed transfection with 500 ng of a minimal promoter construct containing two<br>
copies of PPRE obtained from the cytochrome p450 4A (2XCYP) (1). The renilla<br>
luciferase plasmid (0.1µg/well) was also transfected as an internal control for monitoring<br>
transfection efficiency and for normalizing the firefly luciferase activity. Transfected cells<br>
were left for 24-hours incubation at 37°C. Stimulations were performed after incubation<br>
of cells during 18 hours with the compounds 13, 14, 17, 26, 28, 31 and 38 (see figure 6)<br>
at a concentration of 1 mM and compared with the two PPARγ synthetic ligands 5-ASA<br>
30 mM (2) used as positive controls. The pH of the drug solutions was adjusted to 7.4<br>
with NaOH. Total cell extracts were prepared using the Passive Lysis Buffer<br>
(Promega™, Madison, Wis.). Luciferase activity was assayed in 20 µl of the extract using<br>
the Promega™ Dual Luciferase assay system according to the manufacturer's protocol.<br>
Transfections were assayed in triplicate in at least three separate experiments. The<br>
luciferase activity was expressed as fold of the activity obtained in cells treated with the<br>
different molecules divided by luciferase activity from non-stimulated cells.<br>
RESULTS<br>
Activation of PPARγ results in a cascade of reactions leading to a binding to specific<br>
DNA sequence elements termed peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPRE) (7-<br>
We investigated PPARγ transcriptional activity by transient transfections of epithelial<br>
cells with the renilla luciferase PPRE plamids. To evaluate if the new molecules have<br>
more efficacy than 5-ASA to stimulate PPAPγ activation, we tested these molecules at a<br>
concentration of 1mM. The effect of the new molecules at a concentration of 1 mM was<br>
compared to 5-ASA, used as a positive control at optimal concentration of 30mM. Cells<br><br>
were stimulated with the different molecules during 24 hours. Analysis of PPARγ activity<br>
in transfected HT-29 cells showed that the new molecules increased the reporter gene<br>
activity thereby displaying an activity similar or superior to 5-ASA (concentration of the<br>
new molecules was 30 times less, see Figure 6).<br>
EXAMPLE 10<br>
Study on the effect of the compounds on colon cancer cell growth<br>
The following substances 13,14, 17, 26, 28, 31 and 38 were tested for their ability to<br>
modulate colon cancer cell growth. No experiment was performed with the compound 28<br>
as this substance was not soluble in the culture medium.<br>
For this purpose, three human colon carcinoma cell lines (i.e. HT-29, HT-115 and DLD-<br>
1) were used. These cell types were selected on the basis of the cyclooxigenase-2<br>
(COX-2) expression. Indeed, HT-115 cells express a biologically active COX-2, HT-29<br>
cells express a non-functional COX-2 isoform, and DLD-1 are COX-2-deficient cells.<br>
HT-29 and DLD-1 cells were cultured in McCoy and RPMI1640 media respectively,<br>
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S) and<br>
50µg/ml gentamycin. HT-115 were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 15%<br>
FBS and 1% P/S. Cells were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37°C, in the<br>
presence of 5% CO2.<br>
For cell growth assays, single-cell suspensions were plated at 2 x 103 cells/well (4 x 103<br>
cells/well for HT115) in 96-well culture dishes in medium containing 0.5% FBS and<br>
allowed to adhere. The non-adherent cells were then removed, and fresh medium<br>
containing 0.5% FBS was added into each well. Cells were cultured in the presence or<br>
absence of the specified substances. Each substance was dissolved as a 25 mM stock<br>
solution in culture medium containing 0.5% FBS, and the pH of each stock solution was<br>
adjusted to 7.4, if necessary, with NaOH. Substances were used at a final concentration<br>
ranging from 0.5 to 10 mM. Cell proliferation was determined by measuring the<br>
incorporation of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) into DNA using a commercially<br>
available cell proliferation kit (Roche Diagnostics™, Monza, Italy). BrdU was added to<br>
the cell cultures during the last 6 hours of incubation, and the level of BrdU-positive cells<br>
was assessed after 48 h culture by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).<br><br>
Optical density (OD) was determined at 450 nm using an ELISA reader. Experiments<br>
were performed in triplicate and the results are reported as the mean ± standard<br>
deviation (SD).<br>
To assess further the effect of the compound 14 on colon epithelial cell growth, serum-<br>
starved DLD-1 cells were incubated in 0.2 uM carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl<br>
ester (CFSE) (Invitrogen™, Milan Italy) at 37°C for 30 minutes, then extensively washed<br>
and cultured with or without the addition of the compound. After 2 days culture, CFSE<br>
fluorescence was evaluated and the proportion of cells undergoing divisions was<br>
determined, thus allowing calculation of both precursor frequency and proliferative index.<br>
The effect of the compound 14 on colon epithelial cell death was also assessed. To this<br>
end, cells were cultured as indicated above for 2 days and then the fraction of Annexin V<br>
(AV) and/or propidium iodide (Pl)-positive cells was evaluated using a commercially<br>
available kit (Beckmann Coulter™, Milan, Italy). To evaluate whether the effect of the<br>
compound 14 on colon epithelial cell death was dependent on caspase activity, cells<br>
were pre-incubated with z-VAD-fmk (40 uM), a pan-caspase inhibitor, for 1 hour prior to<br>
adding the compound 14 (1,5 mM). The fraction of AV and Pl-positive cells was<br>
determined after 48 hours culture as indicated above.<br>
RESULTS<br>
The compounds differed in their ability to inhibit colon cancer cell growth. Results are<br>
shown in Figures 7 and 8. Table shows the percentage of inhibition of growth of DLD-1<br>
cells by the specified compounds. The substances 13, 14, 17, 26, and 38 exhibit a<br>
marked anti-proliferative effect. Among these substances, the compounds 13 and 14<br>
significantly reduced the cell growth, in a dose-dependent fashion, in each of the three<br>
cell lines tested (Figs,7A and 7B). More than 90% of cell growth inhibition was seen<br>
when compounds were used at a final concentration of 10 mM. The anti-mitogenic effect<br>
of the compounds 17, 26 and 38 was observed only at concentrations of 2.5mM or<br>
higher (Fig. 8A, 8C, 7D).<br>
The compound 31 significantly inhibited cell growth when used at high doses (10 mM)<br>
(Fig. 7C).<br><br>
Overall the above data indicate that substances 13, 14, and 38 are the most powerful<br>
suppressors of colon cancer cell growth. However, precipitates developed in cell cultures<br>
carried out in the presence of the substances 13 and 38. This was followed by a massive<br>
cell death, which makes it difficult to judge if the anti-proliferative effect of these<br>
compounds was due to either their anti-mitogenic action or toxic effect. Based upon<br>
these findings, subsequent experiments focused on the use of the compound 14.<br>
First, the inhibitory effect of the compound 14 on the growth of DLD-1 cells was<br>
coinfirmed by flow-cytometry. To track cell proliferation, cells were labeled with CFSE. In<br>
line with the BrdU assay data, the compound 14 inhibited the proliferation of DLD-1 cells<br>
(Figure 9). Importantly, after 48 hour treatment, the fraction of proliferating cells<br>
decreased from 90 ± 4 % in untreated cultures to 48 ± 7, 21 ± 11 and 11 ± 6 % in cell<br>
cultures treated with 0.5, 1 and 2.5 mM.<br>
To examine whether the compound 14 also regulated the survival of colon cancer cells,<br>
DLD-1 cells were cultured in the presence or absence of such a compound for 48-hours<br>
and then the percentage of Annexin V and/or Pl-positive cells was evaluated by flow<br>
cytometry. As shown in Figure 10A, compound 14 significantly enhanced the fraction of<br>
cell death when used at a final concentration of 1.5 or 3 mM. To explore the involvement<br>
of caspases in the 14-mediated DLD-1 cell death, cells were preincubated with a pan-<br>
caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD, and then treated with 14. As shown in the representative<br>
experiment in Figure 10B, treatment of cells with Z-VAD largely reduced the percentage<br>
of AV/PI-positive cells.<br>
The percentage of DLD-1 cell inhibition by graded doses (0.5-10 mM) of the specified<br>
compounds is present in Table 1. Cells were cultured in the presence or absence of the<br>
compounds, and cell growth was then assessed by the colorimetric (BrdU) assay after<br>
48-hours culture.<br>
EXAMPLE 11<br>
Molecular modelling<br>
Molecular modelling studies were performed using SYBYL software version 6.9.1 (Tripos<br>
Associates Inc™, St Louis, MO) running on Silicon Graphics™ workstations. Three-<br>
dimensional model of the zwitterions form of 5-ASA was built from a standard fragments<br><br>
library, and its geometry was subsequently optimized using the Tripos force field (3). As<br>
the pKa of compounds is still unknown, the SPARC online calculator was used to<br>
determine the species occurring at physiological pH (7.4)<br>
(http://ibmlc2.chem.uga.edu/sparc/index.cfm). Three-dimensional models of ionized<br>
compounds were built from a standard fragments library, and their geometry was<br>
subsequently optimized using the Tripos force field (3) including the electrostatic term<br>
calculated from Gasteiger and Huckel atomic charges. The method of Powell available in<br>
Maximin2 procedure was used for energy minimization until the gradient value was<br>
smaller than 0.001 kcal/mol.A. The structure of the human PPARγ ligand-binding domain<br>
was obtained from its complexed X-Ray crystal structure with the tesaglitazar (AZ 242)<br>
available in the RCSB Protein Data Bank (1171) (4,5). Flexible docking of the compounds<br>
into the receptor active site was performed using GOLD software (6). The most stable<br>
docking models were selected according to the best scored conformation predicted by<br>
the GoldScore (6) and X-Score scoring functions (7). The complexes were energy-<br>
minimized using the Powell method available in Maximin2 procedure with the Tripos<br>
force field and a dielectric constant of 4.0 until the gradient value reached 0.01<br>
kcal/mol.A. The anneal function was used defining the ligand a hot region (10 A).<br>
Docking studies<br>
All new molecules fit tightly with the PPARγ-LBD interacting via hydrogen bonding with<br>
His-323, His-449, Tyr-473 and Ser-289 considered as key determinants required for<br>
molecular recognition and PPARγ activation (11-12) (Figure 5A, 5C, 5D). Docking for 5-<br>
ASA is shown in Figure 5B.<br>
CONCLUSIONS<br>
It has previously shown that anti-inflammatory effects of 5-ASA were mediated through<br>
PPARγ mainly expressed in the colon by epithelial cells (2). The rational development of<br>
the first 6 new optimized 5-ASA molecules based on docking analysis revealed that the 2<br>
molecules 31 and 17, used at a concentration of 30 mM, activate PPARγ and induce its<br>
expression by intestinal epithelial cells. These 2 new molecules also inhibit epithelial cell<br>
proliferation and induce apoptosis, two important mechanisms involved in the<br>
development of colonic cancer and attributed to PPARγ activation. Concerning the 4 <br>
other molecules (13, 14, 26, 38), most of them have direct cytotoxic effects on epithelial<br>
cells at a concentration of 30 mM, impeding the analysis of PPARγ activation and<br>
regulation and evaluation of cell proliferation and apoptosis.<br><br>
This first set of examples of the invention (Example 8) shows the ability of two optimized<br>
molecules 31 and 17 to stimulate PPARγ expression and activation and to regulate<br>
epithelial cell proliferation and apoptosis. The cytotoxic effects on epithelial cells of<br>
compounds 13, 14 and 26 at 30mM may be related to the presence in their structure of a<br>
highly reactive hydroxamic acid group known to display a great affinity for many various<br>
enzymes.<br>
The second set of examples of the invention (Example 9) indicates that also the other<br>
test the molecules display an activity similar to, or superior to 5-ASA at a working<br>
concentration thirty times less than that of 5-ASA, over a period of 24 hours.<br>
The final set of examples of the invention (Example 10) shows that the compounds affect<br>
the inhibition of the growth of the colon cancer cell lines, HT-29, HT-115 and DLD1 to<br>
varying degrees, with compounds 13,14 and 38 showing the highest effects. In order to<br>
clarify the nature of the cell death, compound 14 was further investigated and was<br>
confirmed, by flow-cytometry, to inhibit the growth of DLD-1 colon cancer cells with<br>
increasing concentration over time.<br>
These molecules are also active on cells that do not express COX-2, and thus the<br>
molecules of the present invention may be used in cells which do not express COX-2 for<br>
the purposes of treating tumours and other applications as herein described.<br>
OVERALL CONCLUSIONS<br>
The synthesized highest ranking compounds, indicated from modelling studies, all show<br>
an activity similar/superior to that of mesalazine.<br>
