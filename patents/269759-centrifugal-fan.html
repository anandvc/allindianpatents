Description<br>
CENTRIFUGAL FAN<br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention relates to a centrifugal fan used in<br>
particular for automotive applications.<br>
This invention relates preferably to the field of electric<br>
fans for ventilating the cabins of motor vehicles, even in<br>
combination with air conditioning systems.<br>
Background Art<br>
With reference to Figures 6a, 6b and 6c, which illustrate an<br>
electric centrifugal fan of a type known in prior art, fans of<br>
this type comprise a casing "a" that houses an impeller ttb"<br>
represented schematically in Figure 6b and connected to an<br>
electric motor "c". The casing "a" has an opening (not<br>
illustrated) in the side of it to draw air into it in a direction<br>
parallel with the axis of rotation of the impeller "b" and a<br>
discharge opening "d" through which the impeller *b" blows the air<br>
out in a direction "e" tangential to the impeller "b" itself. The<br>
discharge opening "d" is delimited by four lateral edges which<br>
define a plane "f" perpendicular to the air flowing out and<br>
parallel with the air flowing in. More specifically, a first edge<br>
ug" is substantially parallel with the axis of rotation "h" of the<br>
impeller "b", is located in the vicinity of the impeller "b" and<br>
belongs to a first wall "i\" parallel with the plane "f" defined by<br>
the discharge opening. A second edge "1", parallel with and<br>
opposite the first, is spaced from the impeller ttb" and belongs to<br>
a second wall V substantially perpendicular to the plane ttf"<br>
defined by the discharge opening "d". Two lateral edges "n", each.<br>
joining the first edge ug" to the second edge "1", belong to<br>
opposite walls "o" perpendicular to the axis of rotation "h" of<br>
the impeller "b". Disadvantageously, all the edges "g, 1, n" have<br><br>
WO 2006/059202	PCT/IB2005/003585<br>
2<br>
sharp edges. Also, the casing "a" is closed by a curved wall "p"<br>
which joins the first wall "i" to the second wall "m" and,<br>
together with the impeller "b", delimits a duct vq_" that diverges<br>
towards the discharge opening M".<br>
In the modern automotive industry, in particular in the<br>
field of luxury car production, driving comfort has reached very<br>
high levels in terms of both the car's dynamic behaviour and<br>
noise. Having attained extremely high levels of soundproofing<br>
against outside noise, designers are now concentrating their<br>
attention on noise inside the cabin or in parts of the car near<br>
the cabin such as, for example, the noise made by the fans of the<br>
car's air conditioning and/or heating system.<br>
In this regard, the Applicant has found that fans of the<br>
type described above can be improved in several ways, especially<br>
as regards the noise made by the air flowing against the sharp<br>
edges of the fan. This noise disturbs the driver and passengers.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
In this situation, the basic technical task of the present<br>
invention is to provide a centrifugal fan that is silent.<br>
The technical task and specified aims are substantially<br>
fulfilled by a centrifugal fan characterised in that it comprises<br>
one or more of the technical solutions defined in the appended<br>
claims.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments of the Invention<br>
With reference to the accompanying drawings, the numeral 1<br>
denotes in its entirety a centrifugal fan according to the<br>
invention. The centrifugal fan 1 comprises a casing 2 delimited by<br>
pair of parallel side walls 3 and a connecting wall 4 that joins<br>
the two side walls 3 and extends preferably and principally in a<br>
spiral direction (Figure 2).<br>
The casing 2 houses an impeller 5, represented schematically<br>
in the drawings, whose hub 6 is connected to an electric motor<br>
(not illustrated) which is mounted outside the casing 2 and which<br>
drives the impeller 5 rotationally about a defined axis of<br>
rotation "X" in a predetermined direction UR". According to well-<br>
known designs, the impeller 5 comprises a plurality of vanes (not<br>
illustrated) connected to the hub 6. The vanes may be of any type<br>
and their shape, number and size shall not restrict the scope of<br>
the invention.<br>
The casing 2 has an axial inlet opening, made in both side<br>
walls 3 and indicated by an arrow "Z" in Figure 1, through which<br>
air is drawn in by the impeller 5, and a tangential discharge<br>
opening 7 through which the air is blown out by the impeller 5 in<br>
a tangential discharge direction "Y" (Figure 2).<br>
The tangential discharge opening 7 is made in the connecting<br>
wall 4. Looking in more detail, the tangential discharge opening 7<br>
is delimited by a first edge 8 that is substantially parallel with<br>
the axis of rotation "X" and is located in the vicinity of the<br>
impeller 5, by a second edge 9 opposite the first edge 8 and<br>
spaced from the impeller 5 and by two lateral edges 10, each<br>
joining the first edge 8 to the second edge 9. These edges 8, 9<br><br>
WO 2006/059202	PCT/IB2005/003585<br>
4<br>
and 10 define a plane "A" in which the discharge opening 7 lies.<br>
The plane "A" is parallel with the axis of rotation "X" and<br>
perpendicular to the tangential discharge direction "Y" of the<br>
air.<br>
The impeller 5 and the casing 2 delimit a duct 11 that<br>
extends around the impeller 5 itself and diverges towards the<br>
discharge opening 7 in the rotation direction R.<br>
Advantageously and unlike prior art fans, the centrifugal<br>
fan 1 according to this invention also comprises an appendage 12<br>
located in the vicinity of the tangential discharge opening 7. The<br>
appendage 12 is delimited by the first edge 8 and has a convex<br>
surface 16 inside the casing 2 and connected to the first edge 8<br>
by a transition surface 15.<br>
The appendage 12 therefore extends between the two side<br>
walls 3 and lies parallel with the axis of rotation "X".<br>
The convex surface 16 is also connected to an inside surface<br>
17 belonging to the connecting wall 4 of the casing 2 at a<br>
transition area 13. The diverging duct 11 extends from the<br>
transition area 13 and is delimited by the inside surface 17, by<br>
the impeller 5 and by the side walls 3.<br>
Preferably, for moulding convenience, as illustrated in<br>
Figures 4, 4a and 4b, which show three non-restricting<br>
embodiments, the cross section of the appendage 12 transversal to<br>
the axis of rotation "X" is substantially hook-shaped. On the side<br>
of it opposite the convex surface 16, the hook-shaped appendage 12<br>
forms, outside the casing 2, a concave surface 14 which blends<br>
into the first edge 8 and which therefore coincides with the end<br>
of the hook itself.<br>
In the embodiment illustrated in Figure 4, the transition<br>
surface 15 is also curved outwardly and has a smaller curvature,<br>
and hence a larger curvature radius, than the convex surface 16.<br>
Further, as shown in Figures 2 and 4, the convex surface 16<br>
and the transition surface 15, together with the second edge 9,<br>
delimit a diverging discharge duct 18 that acts as a diffuser.<br>
The concave surface 14 of the hook blends into an outside<br>
surface 19 belonging to the connecting wall 4 of the casing 2.<br>
Preferably, the first edge 8 is also rounded and blends into<br><br>
WO 2006/059202	PCT/IB2005/003585<br>
5<br>
the concave surface 14 and into the transition surface 15 in such<br>
a way that the hook does not have any sharp edges.<br>
The cross section of the appendage 12, transversal to the<br>
axis of rotation "X", also comprises a straight section 2 0 which<br>
joins and blends the concave surface 14 outside the casing 2 into<br>
the first edge 8. The straight section 20 is substantially<br>
parallel with the tangential direction "Y" of air discharge from<br>
the discharge opening 7. The extension of the straight section 20<br>
is such that, in the vicinity of the appendage 12, the inside<br>
surface 17 and the outside surface 19 of the casing 2 delimit a<br>
wall 4a belonging to the connecting wall 4, having a constant<br>
thickness and partly surrounding the impeller 5.<br>
Where "P1" is the plane parallel to the plane "A" and tangent<br>
to the convex surface 16, "P2" the plane perpendicular to the<br>
plane "A" and tangent to the transition surface 15, "d1" the<br>
distance between the plane "P1" and the plane "A", and "d2" the<br>
distance between the plane "P2" and the first edge 8 at the point<br>
of tangency with the plane "A", the ratio between "d1" and "d2" is<br>
preferably between 1.5 and 3.<br>
In a first alternative embodiment, illustrated in Figure 4a,<br>
the transition surface 15 differs from the embodiment of Figure 4<br>
in that it has a flat portion 15a that is blended into the convex<br>
surface 16 and a curved transition section 15b between the flat<br>
portion 15a and the first edge 8.<br>
Further, the first edge 8 is defined by a flat surface<br>
perpendicular to the flat portion 15a belonging to the transition<br>
surface 15.<br>
The second alternative embodiment illustrated in Figure 4b<br>
differs from the one of Figure 4a in that it does not have the<br>
curved transition section 15b.<br>
In both the alternative embodiments illustrated in Figures<br>
4a and 4b, the flat portion 15a is parallel with the tangential<br>
direction of discharge "Y". Therefore, the discharge duct 18 is<br>
not divergent but constant in section.<br>
To further reduce the noise, made by the fan 1, the latter<br>
comprises a protrusion 21, preferably with a rounded shape, that<br>
extends along each of the lateral edges 10 towards the opposite<br><br>
WO 2006/059202	PCT/IB2005/003585<br>
6<br>
lateral edge 10 (Figures 3 and 5) and a fillet 22 to round the<br>
second edge 9 (Figure 2) . As clearly shown in cross section in<br>
Figure 5, the protrusion 21 is shaped like a semicircle that<br>
blends into the adjacent walls without forming sharp edges. Each<br>
of the protrusions 21 on the lateral edges 10 extends smoothly<br>
from the fillet 22 of the second edge 9, to form a single frame<br>
around the three edges 9, 10. Therefore, the protrusions 21 and<br>
the fillet 22 may have the same shape.<br>
The invention fulfils the proposed aim and achieves<br>
important advantages.<br>
The special shape of the appendage located on the first edge<br>
reduces swirling at the air discharge opening, thereby diminishing<br>
noise made by the air flow. The noise is further reduced by the<br>
rounded protrusions made around each of the lateral edges and by<br>
the fillet on the second edge.<br><br>
