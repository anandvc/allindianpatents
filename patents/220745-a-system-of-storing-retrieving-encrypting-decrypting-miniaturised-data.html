				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates primarily, although not exclusively-, to system of<br>
storing, retrieving, encrypting and decrypting miniaturised data. It relates to a<br>
techniques used for storing electronic data in a form which requires less storage<br>
space.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A typical method for compressing data involves the use of a dictionary data base which lists commonly occurring data and replaces this commonly occurring data with a coded "token" which effectively represents that data using a reduced number of data bits.<br>
Whenever an item of data occurs repeatedly this data item is replaced by its equivalent "token" and accordingly that data item is stored in a compressed form.<br>
When data is stored in the compressed form, by using a look-up table each token can be replaced by its equivalent data item so that the original data can be reformed.<br>
The above conventional compression technique has a number of drawbacks. These drawbacks include the number of data bits which are required to represent a token can also be significant with the result that significant storage space is required to store each token. In addition searching a data base which includes tokens can be quite cumbersome because tokens need to be reconverted to their original data item before a search of each of the data items can be properly conducted.<br>

A preferred embodiment: of the present invention<br>
will now be described by way o£ example only with<br>
reference to HTML script or text.<br>
BEST MODE OF CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
AS an example the following HTML text will be<br>
minimised in accordance with the preferred embodiment of<br>
the invention:<br>
The Frontpage install 
The above text can be split into a number of<br>
groups which for convenience will be referred to as data items.  Thus tha word "the" constitutes one data item, the word "frontpage" constitutes another data item and so on for the word ^install", "<l--webbot bot=" and " purpletext in a typical situation each of the above data items would be stored base and space required to btor this i accordingly no longer available store other data.></l--webbot>
U«ing the miniaturisation technique in accordance with the present invention two indexing lists are set up as shown in Figure 1.<br>
A first lict 11 is set up which is effectively a data base of pointers.<br>
For convenience only son* of the pointers are shown/ being those pointers; required to identify text which is stored relating to the sample of HTML text referred to above.<br>
The first list 11 it generated by analysing the repetitive structure of HTML text and script that exists Am documents or data transfer streams. This list has common HTML text type documents.  All items that are of repetitive nature that can be identified exist in this list.  This text list could be a super set of other common lists* for example/ the English language list or the French language list.<br>
A second list 12 contains a dictionary of the HTML text which is to be miniaturised.  Bach data item is located at a specific position in the list 12 and this position is identified by a number which is pointed to by a pointer from list 11.<br>
The list 12 is effectively a dictionary data base which is generated by coding the entrie* in the HTML text and script list.<br>
The 128 most common items are located first in the list and are assigned first level representation (typically 8 bits) in alphabetic sequence.  The rest of the list is organised alphabetically and is assigned the<br>
minimum number of bits to uniquely identify the location of the original data in the list 11.<br>
As an example, if the total number of data items (e.g. characters) in the first list is 29,456 then 15 bits (0..32768) would be needed to represent the unique location of the start of a particular data item.  The number of unique entries is then calculated.  If, for example, there are 3,128 unique entries in the list 11, then 12 bit* (0 to 4096) will be required to identify the unique data itarns in the list.<br>
It follows from the above that by setting up the first lint 11 a reduced number of pointers are required to represent the data items in the second list, because data items that are repeated do not need to have an associated pointer,<br>
Accordingly if a data item occurs 1,000 times in the second list or dictionary data base, a single pointer is all that is required in the first list 11 and accordingly the single pointer is all that needs to be stored in a general data base 13.<br>
Thus referring back to the example of HTML text given above, the word "the" is the first data item which is to be stored in the general data base 13.  Because the word "the" is a common word, it therefore occurs in the most common section of the second list 12 and may be located at position 340$. The corresponding pointer from the first list 11 may be located at position BA. Accordingly the word "the" does not need to be stored in the general data base 13 nor does the second list pointer 340$.  Instead the first list pointer 8A con be stored in the general data base 13 and this obviously has a lower number of bits required to describe it and accordingly requires less space for storage.<br>
The next word in the HTML text is "Frontpage" which is not as common ac the word "th»", but does exist many times in normal HTML text.  It therefore is located in the less common section of the dictionary list 12 at a<br>
location 23456.  m the first list 11 location 23456 i* represented by pointer 2408.<br>
It follows therefore that pointer 2408 is placed in the general data base 13 straight after pointer BA. The word "install" is the next data item in the HMTL text and i* an uncommon word which is located at pocition 26578.  The corresponding pointer in first list 11 is located at position 2458. Accordingly this pointer 2458 is stored in the general data base 13 after pointer 2408.<br>
Finally the script string "<l bot is a very common html script command and therefore located at position in the second lint. this location represented by pointer sf first list accordingly general data base instead of></l>
The word wPurpleText" is not common in either HTML script or text and therefore does not occur in the dictionary list 12. As a result thin word is represented by an exception flag "00" in the general data base 13 and has no associated pointer. Similarly any other script or text which is not represented in the dictionary data base 12, is also classified as an exception and is copied verbatim into the general data base 13.<br>
Reconstruction of the original data represented in the general data base is simply achieved by using a reverse look-up algorithm.<br>
Thus if the pointer 8A is read, a look-up algorithm is used to access the first list 11 which gives the location of the corresponding data item at location 3406 in the second list 12.<br>
At location 3406 the word "the" is located and this word is then retrieved and substituted for the<br>
pointer 8A.<br>
The above example discloses what is in effect a double index technique, utilising two pointers.  However the present invention may equally be applicable to any nuanber of indexes and pointers, depending on the data<br>
which is to be miniaturised.  Thus one application would be in'miniaturising data located in telephone white pages. In such a situation a. number of dictionary lists would be required, guch as a names list, a streets list and a locations list.<br>
Bach of thea* lists would have thair own separate first and second list pointers using the examples outlined above.  Furthermore, each list could have an associated list which would also require a double index pointer system.<br>
Thus a streets list having the names of various streets may also require a sub-list of street types such as "ST", *PL", «CR" etc.<br>
According to another example image data nay be represented by multi-level indexing techniques.  Thus the first level may be the fact that the area is black, the second level may indicate the shape, the third level may indicate the size,  similarly the levels may relate to further deconstruction of the original data.<br>
Clearly the above compression technique is not limited to text based data, but is also able to be used in connection with foreign languages/ foreign character sets (e.g. Arabic and Chinese), music and speech phonemes. The only requirement is that the data has a repetitive nature that can be analysed and represented as uniquely coded and identifiable items.<br>
An important advantage of the miniaturisation technique which IB described above li«s with, the ability to search data items in its miniaturised format. Thus instead of searching for the word "the" in the preferred embodiment given above, a search could be conducted for the pointer 8A. This ie in contrast to conventional searching techniques of compressed text, where it is necessary to continually convert and reconvert text in order to complete the search.<br>
Although the main focus of the present invention is miniaturisation of data, the invention is equally<br>
applicable to encrypting/decrypting data.  This is because the ihdexing system described above in effect replaces common data items with associated pointers which act as tokens.<br>
Because each token and data item is easily retrievable, the list of tokens/pointers can easily be manipulated in a reversible manner to make unauthorised decryption more difficult.<br>
The present invention is therefore applicable to any data which includes repetitive element*.  This is because these repetitive element* can be represented in an index of pointers/tokens which obviate the need for pointers for each repeated eleaumt. It follow* therefore that theoretically any data stored, for example in computer nanory can b* stored in a miniaturised form by the majority of repeated data items.<br><br><br><br><br>
