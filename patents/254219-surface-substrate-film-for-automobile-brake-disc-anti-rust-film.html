				<td>Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a surface substrate film for a motor vehicle brake disc antirust film which surface substrate film can have the motor vehicle brake disc antirust film to be hardly peeled off when adhered onto a motor vehicle wheel.<br>
Background Art<br>
A motor vehicle brake disc is oxidized by rainwater infiltrating from the outside and black rust sticks thereto. Such black rust leads to causes to impair the quietness and comfortability inside the motor vehicle. Accordingly, a motor vehicle brake disc is subjected to waterproof treatment to prevent oxidation.<br>
Conventionally/ for the purpose of preventing the black rust on a motor vehicle brake disc, there has been adopted a method in which a molded pulp product is directly fitted on a brake disc. However, such a molded pulp product is poor in water resistance, necessitates a number of steps for fitting and removing it, is high in cost and suffers other disadvantages; accordingly, there has recently been proposed the substitution of such a<br><br>
molded pulp product with a pressure-sensitive adhesive film (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 7-309510). Such a pressure-sensitive adhesive film is referred to as an antirust film, and is adhered to a tire wheel because the pressure-sensitive adhesive film has advantages such that it involves simple steps for adhesion and peeling and is capable of preventing the external flaw of the tire wheel. The antirust film is required to have three-dimensional curved surface followability because the tire wheel as an adherend has a three-dimensional curved shape. From such a viewpoint, flexible polyethylene film is used as a substrate film.<br>
On the other hand, a motor vehicle chassis is aerodynamically designed, for the purpose of cooling the brake disc, in such a way that the air flow entering from the front of the motor vehicle is sucked toward tire wheels while the motor vehicle is running. Consequently, an air pressure is exerted from the inside on the antirust film. Thus, there is a problem such that the antirust film is peeled off when a motor vehicle is being transported on a carrier car or when a completed motor vehicle is being subjected to a running test. Additionally, an aluminum wheel has an advantage that it is superior in workability to a stainless steel wheel, and hence sophistication of design has been advanced for aluminum wheels; aluminum wheels with thin spokes predominate from the viewpoints of mileage improvement by<br><br>
weight reduction, reduction of environmental burdens by decreasing the consumed amounts of materials, and improvement of cooling efficiency of brake discs. As a result, a reduced adhesion area is available for an antirust film to be adhered to an aluminum wheel, and hence there is a tendency that peeling problems are increasingly encountered.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide, by solving the above described problems, a surface substrate film for a motor vehicle brake disc antirust film which surface substrate film is hardly peeled off when adhered onto a motor vehicle wheel.<br>
The present inventors have perfected the present invention by discovering, as a result of a diligent study carried out to solve the above described problems, that the above described problems can be solved by providing the surface substrate film with a specific tensile modulus of elasticity.<br>
Specifically, the present invention provides a surface substrate film for a motor vehicle brake disc antirust film which surface substrate film is characterized by having a tensile modulus of elasticity of 220 MPa or more.<br>
Additionally, the present invention provides the surface substrate film for a motor vehicle brake disc<br><br>
antirust film according to the above descriptions, the surface substrate film having a tensile modulus of elasticity of 220 to 2200 MPa.<br>
Additionally, the present invention provides a surface substrate film for a motor vehicle brake disc antirust film according to the above description, the surface substrate film being made to include an ultraviolet absorber in a proportion of 0.01 to 20 parts by mass relative to 100 parts by mass of the surface substrate film in such a way that the spectral transmittance of the surface substrate film in a wavelength region from 200 to 380 nm falls within a range from 0 to 20%.<br>
Further, the present invention provides a motor vehicle brake disc antirust film, characterized by including a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer on one surface of the surface substrate film according to the above descriptions.<br>
The surface substrate film for a motor vehicle brake disc antirust film of the present invention is hardly peeled off and excellent in prevention of black rust to be formed on a motor vehicle brake disc, when the surface substrate film is provided with a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer on one surface thereof, used as a motor vehicle brake disc antirust film, and adhered to the wheel so as for the surface of the pressure-sensitive adhesive layer to face and touch the wheel.<br><br>

The polyisocyanate compounds can be used each alone or in combinations of two or more thereof.<br>
When crosslinking is carried out, it is preferable to fully mix together an acrylic copolymer and a polyisocyanate compound, in particular, to fully mix together in a solvent.

It is preferable to make the pressure-sensitive adhesive layer include an ultraviolet absorber in such a way that the spectral transmittance of the motor vehicle brake disc antirust film in a wavelength region from 200 to 380 nm falls within a range from 0 to 20%. The mixing ratio of the ultraviolet absorber is preferably 0.01 to 20% by mass relative to the resin component of the pressure-sensitive adhesive layer.<br>

thickness may usually be 1 to 300 #m, and is preferably 2 to 150 #m and particularly preferably 5 to 100 //m.<br>
The pressure-sensitive adhesive layer may be formed by directly coating one surface of the surface substrate film, or may be formed on one surface of the surface substrate film by bonding the surface of the pressure-sensitive adhesive layer of a release liner and the surface substrate film to each other, wherein the release liner has been prepared as a release liner with the pressure-sensitive adhesive layer formed by coating beforehand a pressure-sensitive adhesive on the releasing agent layer surface of the release liner and by drying the pressure-sensitive adhesive layer. No particular constraint is imposed on the method for forming the pressure-sensitive adhesive layer, and various methods can be adopted. Examples of such methods include methods for forming by coating with the following coaters and drying: an airknife coater, a blade coater, a bar coater, a gravure coater, a roll coater, a roll knife coater, a curtain coater, a die coater, a knife coater, a screen coater, a Mayer bar coater and a kiss coater.<br>
The surface of the pressure-sensitive adhesive layer is preferably covered with a release liner. Alternatively, without using a release liner, it is possible to impart releasability to the surface substrate film by coating a releasing agent on the surface of the surface substrate film, prepare a pressure-sensitive<br><br>
adhesive film in which a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer is provided on the nonreleasing surface of the surface substrate film, and roll pressure-sensitive adhesive film thus obtained in such a way that the releasing surface and the surface of the pressure-sensitive adhesive layer are brought into contact with each other to store. Thus, the surface of the pressure-sensitive adhesive layer can be protected.<br>
As the release liner, any types may be used. For example, there can be used a release liner in which the surface, to be bonded to the pressure-sensitive adhesive layer, of the substrate of the release liner is subjected to a release treatment, if needed, wherein adopted as the substrate are the films formed of various resins such as polyethylene terephthalate, polybutylene terephthalate, polyethylene, polypropylene and polyacrylate, and also are various paper materials such as polyethylene laminate paper, polypropylene laminate paper, clay coated paper, resin coated paper, glassine paper and woodfree paper.<br>
In this case, typical examples of the release treatment include the formation of a releasing agent layer formed of a releasing agent such as a silicone-based resin, a long-chain alkyl based resin or a fluorine-based resin.<br>
No particular constraint is imposed on the thickness of the release liner, and the thickness may be appropriately selected. Adhesion, to an adherend, of the<br>
17<br><br>
motor vehicle brake disc antirust film that uses the surface substrate film for a motor vehicle brake disc antirust film of the present invention can be carried out by preferably providing a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer on one surface of the surface substrate film, peeling off the release liner when the release liner covers the surface of the pressure-sensitive adhesive layer, and adhering the pressure-sensitive adhesive layer onto the surface of the adherend such as a wheel. Alternatively, when no pressure-sensitive adhesive layer is provided on one surface of the motor vehicle brake disc antirust film, a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer is provided on the surface of the adherend such as a wheel, and the motor vehicle brake disc antirust film can also be adhered onto the surface of the pressure-sensitive adhesive layer.<br>
Examples<br>
Hereinafter, specific description will be made on the present invention with reference to Examples. However, the present invention is not limited at all by these Examples.<br>

density polyethylene resin having a density of 0.954 g/cm3. By using the mixture thus obtained as the raw material, a polyethylene resin film having a thickness of<br>
50 //m and a tensile modulus of elasticity of 250 MPa was prepared with an inflation film molding machine.<br>
Preparation of an Acrylic Copolymer<br>

By using the mixture thus obtained as the raw material, a polyethylene resin film having a thickness of 50 //m and a tensile modulus of elasticity of 380 MPa was prepared with an inflation film molding machine. A pressure-sensitive adhesive film was prepared in the same manner as in Example 1 except that this polyethylene resin film was used as the surface substrate film.<br>
(Example 4}<br>
A mixture was prepared by mixing 70 parts by mass of a low density polyethylene resin having a density of 0.928 g/cm3 with a 30 parts by mass of a high density polyethylene resin having a density of 0.954 g/cm3 and by further mixing 10 parts by mass of a benzotriazole-based ultraviolet absorber (2-(2'-hydroxy-3'-tert-butyl-5'-methylphenyl)-5-chlorobenzotriazole, trade name: Tinuvin 326, manufactured by Ciba Specialty Chemicals Corp.) in 100 parts by mass of these polyethylene resins. By using the mixture thus obtained as the raw material, a<br>
polyethylene resin film having a thickness of 50 /ULm, a tensile modulus of elasticity of 340 MPa and a spectral transmittance of less than 1% in a wavelength region from 200 to 380 nm was prepared with an inflation film molding machine. A pressure-sensitive adhesive film was prepared in the same manner as in Example 1 except that this polyethylene resin film was used as the surface substrate film.<br><br>
(Comparative Example 1)<br>
By using a low density polyethylene resin having a density of 0.928 g/cm3 as the raw material, a polyethylene resin film having a thickness of 50 /Zm and a tensile modulus of elasticity of 210 MPa was prepared with an inflation film molding machine.<br>
Measurements of Physical Properties of Pressure-sensitive adhesive Films<br>
The surface substrate films and the pressure-sensitive adhesive films prepared in Examples and Comparative Example were subjected to the following tensile modulus of elasticity measurement, pressure-sensitive adhesive strength measurement, sunshine weatherometer (hereinafter abbreviated as SWOM) test, and film peeling test and adherend staining test after motor vehicle running. The results thus obtained are shown in Table 1.<br>
(1)	Measurement of Tensile Modulus of Elasticity<br>
The specimens obtained from the polyethylene resin<br>
films prepared in above described Examples and Comparative Example were subjected to the measurement of the tensile modulus of elasticity according to JIS 7127.<br>
(2)	Measurement of Pressure-sensitive adhesive<br>
Strength<br>
The pressure-sensitive adhesive films prepared in above described Examples and Comparative Example were<br><br>
subjected to the measurement of the pressure-sensitive adhesive strength in an environment of 23°C and 50% RH in conformity with JIS Z0237 wherein an aluminum plate coated with a paint (trade name: Magicron ALC-2-1, manufactured by Kansai Paint Co., Ltd.) was used as an adherend.<br>
(3)	SWOM Test<br>
The pressure-sensitive adhesive films prepared in above described Examples and Comparative Example were subjected to the measurement of the pressure-sensitive adhesive strength based on the above described measurement method after a 500 hour irradiation in SWOM (trade name: Sunshine Super Long Life Weatherometer WEL-SUN-HCH, manufactured by Suga Test Instruments Co., Ltd.).<br>
(4)	Film Peeling Test after Motor vehicle Running<br>
Each of the pressure-sensitive adhesive films<br>
prepared in above described Examples and Comparative Example was adhered onto the surface of an aluminum wheel of a motor vehicle (trade name: Cercio, manufactured by Toyota Motor Corp.); the motor vehicle was driven at a speed of 80 km/hour for 60 minutes and then the peeling of the adhered pressure-sensitive adhesive film was evaluated on the basis of the following standards. Good: No peeling occurred. Poor: Peeling occurred.<br>
(5)	Adherend Staining Test<br><br>
Each of the pressure-sensitive adhesive films prepared in above described Examples and Comparative Example was adhered onto an adherend prepared with an aluminum plate coated with a paint (trade name: Magicron ALC-2-1, manufactured by Kansai Paint Co., Ltd.)f and was subjected, as it was adhered, to a SWOM test; after a SWOM test for 500 hours, the adherend with the pressure-sensitive adhesive film was taken out, and the adhered pressure-sensitive adhesive film was peeled off from the adherend; the staining state of the adherend at the time of this peeling off was evaluated on the basis of the following standards. Good: The adherend was not stained. Poor: The adherend was stained.<br>
Table 1<br><br>
	Example 1 	Example<br>
2 	Example 3 	Example 4 	Comp. Ex. 1 <br>
Content of low density polyethylene resin (parts by mass) 	85 	70 	55 	70 	100 <br>
Content of high density polyethylene resin (parts by mass) 	15 	30 	45 	30 	- <br>
Ultraviolet absorber (parts by mass) 	- 	- 	- 	10 	- <br>
Tensile modulus of elasticity (MPa) 	250 	340 	380 	340 	210 <br>
Pressure-sensitive adhesive strength (N/25 mm) 	5.1 	5.5 	5.9 	5.6 	4.5 <br>
Peeling after motor vehicle running 	Good 	Good 	Good 	Good 	Poor <br>
Pressure-sensitive adhesive strength after SWOM for 500 hr (N/25 mm) 	- 	- 	- 	5.8 	6.7 <br>
Adherend staining after SWOM for 500 hr 	- 	- 	- 	Good 	Poor <br><br>
Because Examples 1 to 3 each used as the surface substrate film the film having a tensile modulus of elasticity of 250 to 380 MPa, Examples 1 to 3 are larger in pressure-sensitive adhesive strength as compared to Comparative Example 1 using as the surface substrate film the film having a tensile modulus of elasticity of 210 MPa, and suffered no film peeling due to motor vehicle running in contrast to Comparative Example 1. Example 4 in which an ultraviolet absorber was added underwent no increase of the pressure-sensitive adhesive strength and no staining of the adherend after the SWOM test. On the contrary, in Comparative Example 1, the pressure-sensitive adhesive strength increase after the SWOM test was remarkable, and the adherend staining due to the cohesion failure of the pressure-sensitive adhesive strength was observed.<br>
The surface substrate film for a motor vehicle brake disc antirust film of the present invention can be utilized as a motor vehicle brake disc antirust film.<br><br><br><br><br>
