Hioh-molecular-weioht polymeric material comprising diketopvrrolopvrrole pigments<br>
The invention relates to a high-molecular-weight organic material the pigmentation of which consists of extremely fine particles, the pigmentation comprising at least one pigment from the class of diketopyrrolopyrrole compounds, and to novel diketopyrrolopyrrole pigments. That material is preferably employed in the form of thin layers that are built up in one or more layers in the form of patterns on a transparent substrate and can be used as optical colour filters.<br>
Colour filters are an extremely exacting technology which also demands very high standards of the colouring agents. Three pigmentation processes that are fundamentally different in principle are known for the production of colour filters. A number of variants thereof is described in Displays 14/2,115 (1993).<br>
For example, it is possible to use colorants that can be completely dissolved in a binder, in a conventional solvent or in a solution of the binder in a conventional solvent. According to JP-A-08/44050, a colour strength of &gt; 2.8 is possible for a film thickness of 
On the other hand, it is also possible to use dispersions of pigments that are completely insoluble in a binder or in a conventional solvent or are soluble therein only in an extremely low concentration. A number of variants of that method has been disclosed in Journal of the SID 1/3, 341 -346 (1993) and at the IDW'95 (Contribution CF-3, pages 57 to 60 of the printed version). In order to obtain the necessary particle fineness corresponding to a very high specific surface, prolonged grinding with the application of high friction energy is required. According to Contribution CF-5 at the IDW'95 (pages 65 to 68 of the printed version), the particle size is to be very fine, 0.1 |xm maximum.<br>
A third alternative consists of chemically modifying pigments in such a manner that they are completely soluble in a ready-for-use mixture of a binder and a conventional solvent. After coating and the usual further processing, the pigment can be regenerated, the pigment precursors having to undergo a reaction that obviously requires a high activation energy.<br>
The formulation of extremely fine pigments in such a manner that the coloristic properties conforming to exact standards are obtained is therefore extremely difficult by the previously known methods.<br><br>
The production of colour filters by sequential application of a red, blue and green colouring agent to a suitable substrate, such as, for example, amorphous silicon, is also described in GB-A-2 182 165. The colour filters can be coated, for example, using inks, especially printing inks, comprising the diketopyrrolopyrrole pigments used according to the invention, or can be produced, for example, by mixing the diketopyrrolopyrrole pigments used according to the invention with chemically, thermally or photochemically structurable high-molecular-weight material. The further production can be carried out, for example, analogously to EP-A-654 711 by application to a substrate, e.g. glass used for LCD, subsequent photo-structuring and development. Other documents that describe the production of colour filters are US-A-5 624 467 and WO 98/45756.<br>
For the production of colour filters pigments of the diketopyrrolopyrrole class, so-called DPP pigments, have also been used for some time.<br>
For example, EP-A-704 497 describes mixed crystals and solid solutions of symmetrical diketopyrrolopyrroles that are isomorphous with the crystal structure of an asymmetrical diketopyrrolopyrrole and can be used for pigmenting high-molecular-weight organic substances.<br>
EP-A-654 506 discloses synergistic pigment mixtures that can be used in plastics materials, surface coatings or printing inks, it being possible also for pigments of the diketopyrrolopyrrole class inter alia to be used.<br>
EP-A-340 968 discloses an electrolytic process for the production of pigmented thin layers, diketopyrrolopyrrole Red 254 (C.I. Pigment Red 254) inter alia being used as pigment.<br>
The alternative method, by which pigments are chemically modified in such a manner that they are completely soluble in a ready-for-use mixture of a binder and a conventional solvent and are regenerated after coating and the usual further processing, is described, for example, in EP-A-654 711 and EP-A-742 255, diketopyrrolopyrrole Red 255 (C.I. Pigment Red 255) inter alia being used as pigment.<br>
The DPP pigments used for the production of colour filters up to the present time, however, have the disadvantage inter alia that they do not block out a specific blue-tinged red shade with high transparency.<br>
There is therefore a need for new DPP pigments that have such a blue-tinged red shade in<br><br>
terms of their hue, are coloristically pure and are distinguished by having a high transparency.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that the DPP pigments used according to the invention largely satisfy the above-mentioned criteria.<br>
The present invention accordingly relates to a high-molecular-weight polymeric material comprising at least one diketopyrrolopyrrole pigment (DPP pigment) of formula<br><br>

The following Examples serve to illustrate the invention. Unless stated otherwise, parts therein are parts by weight and percentages are percentages by weight. Temperatures are given in degrees Celsius. The relationship between parts by weight and parts by volume is the same as that between grams and cubic centimetres:<br>
Example 1 a: A mixture consisting of 68.8 g (0.5 mol) of 4-chlorobenzonitrile, 103.7 g (0.75 mol) of potassium carbonate and<br><br>

When the addition is complete, the resulting dark-red suspension is maintained at 105°C, with stirring, for a further 30 minutes and is then cooled to 15°C. The suspension is then discharged into a mixture consisting of 500 ml of water, 100 ml of methanol and<br>

is placed in a laboratory reaction flask and heated at a temperature of from 140 to 152°C for 5 hours and stirred at 120°C for 15 hours to complete the reaction. The resulting yellow suspension is cooled and the solvent is removed in vacuo in a rotary evaporator. The resulting solid residue is taken up in 1.5 litres of water, filtered and washed with 1.4 litres of water. Drying in vacuo yields 57.9 g (95 % of the theoretical yield) of a pale-yellow compound of formula<br><br>

are obtained.<br>
Example 4: In a laboratory reaction flask, 2.58 g (0.112 mol) of sodium and 60 ml of tert-amyl alcohol<br><br>
are heated under reflux for 12 hours at a temperature of from 110 to 115°C. To the resulting clear solution there is added dropwise at 105°C, with stirring, over a period of 3 hours a mixture consisting of<br>
12.15 g (0.05 mol) of the compound of formula (54) from Example 2, 9.04 g (0.07 mol) of succinic acid diisopropyl ester and 60 ml of tert-amyl alcohol.<br>
When the addition is complete, the resulting dark-red suspension is maintained at 105°C, with stirring, for a further 30 minutes and is then cooled to room temperature. The suspension is then discharged into a mixture consisting of 250 ml of water, 50 ml of methanol and<br>
9.0 g (0.15 mol) of acetic acid at a temperature below 30°C and is stirred at room temperature for 15 hours to complete the reaction.<br>
The finely particulate pigment suspension obtained in that manner is filtered off and washed with 1000 mi of methanol and 500 ml of water. After drying in vacuo at 90°C, 12.9 g (91 % of the theoretical yield) of a red pulverulent compound of formula<br><br>
are obtained, which in PVC results in a transparent blue-tinged red coloration.<br>
Example 5: The procedure is analogous to Example 4 except that, instead of compound (54), an equimolar amount of the compound of formula (55) is used. A red pulverulent compound of formula<br><br>
is obtained in a yield of 95 %, which in PVC results in a transparent blue-tinged red colora-<br><br>
