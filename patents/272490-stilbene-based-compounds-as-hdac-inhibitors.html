				<td>Field<br><br>
Described are novel stilbene like compounds of the general formula (I), their derivatives, analogs, tautomeric forms, stereoisomers, polymorphs, hydrates, solvates, pharmaceutically acceptable salts and compositions, metabolites and prodrugs thereof.<br><br>
Described herein is the process for the preparation of the above said novel stilbene like compounds of the formula (I), their derivatives, analogs, stereoisomers, polymorphs, hydrates, solvates, pharmaceutically acceptable salts and compositions, metabolites and prodrugs thereof.<br><br>
These compounds described herein are inhibitors of Histone deacetylase (HDAC) and also arrest cell growth in neoplastic cells, thereby inhibiting proliferation. The compounds provided herein can be used as therapeutic agents for diseases that are involved in cellular growth such as malignant tumors, autoimmune diseases, skin diseases, infections etc.<br><br>
Background<br><br>
Transcriptional regulation is a major event in cell differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. Transcriptional activation of a set of genes determines cell destination and for this reason transcription is tightly regulated by a variety of factors. One of its regulatory mechanisms involved in the process is an alteration in the tertiary structure of DNA, which affects transcription factors to their target DNA regiments. Nucleosomal integrity is regulated by the acetylating status of the core histone, with the result being permissiveness to transcription.<br><br>
The regulations of transcription factor are thought to involve by changes in the structure of chromatin.   Changing its affinity of histone proteins for coiled DNA in the nucleosome alters the structure of chromatin. Hypoacetylated histories are believed to have greater affinity to the DNA and form a tightly bound DNA-histone complex and render the DNA inaccessible to transcriptional regulation. The acetylating status of the histone is governed by the balance activities of the histone acetyl transferase (HAT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC).<br><br>
The first isolation of histone deacetylase was described in 1964 from crude nuclear extracts of cells, but the molecular characterization of isoforms of the enzyme has been achieved recently. Inhibitors of histone deacetylase (HDACs) are zinc hydrolases responsible for the deacetylation of N-acetyl lysine residues of histone and non-histone protein substrates. Human HDACs are classified into two distinct classes, the HDACs and sirtuins. The HDACs are divided into two subclasses based on their similarity to yeast histone deacetylases, RPD 3 (class I includes HDAC 1, 2, 3, 8, and 11) and Hda 1 (class II includes HDAC 4, 6,7, 9, and 10). All of the HDACs have a highly conserved zinc dependent catalytic domain. There is growing evidence that the acetylation state of proteins and thus the HDAC enzyme family plays a crucial role in the modulation of a number of biological processes, including transcription and cell cycle.<br><br>
Recently, HDAC inhibitors have been found to arrest growth and apoptosis in several types of cancer cells, including colon cancer, t-cell lymphoma and erythroleukemic cells (M. Paris, etal., J. Med. Chem., 2008,51,1505-1529).<br><br>
HDAC inhibitor MG3290 was found to be a potent, fungal selective potentiator of several azole antifungals in Aspergillus and Candida species including C.glabrata and also it was found to potentiate azole resistant C-glabrata mutant (WO 2008/021944 and US 2008/0139673).<br><br>
Given that apoptosis is a crucial factor for cancer progression, HDAC inhibitors are promising reagents for cancer therapy as effective inducers of apoptosis.<br><br>
Recently, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) was launched as an antitumor agent for treating cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) and is a known HDAC inhibitor. Several structural classes of HDAC inhibitors have been identified and are reviewed in Marks, P.A. et al, J. Natl Cancer Inst., 2000, 92, 1210-1215. More specifically WO 98/55449 and US 5,369,108 patents report alkanoyl hydroxamates with HDAC inhibitory activity. Other compounds that are able to inhibit HDAC activity are Trichostatin A (TSA), PXD101, Tropoxin (TPX), Sodium butyrate (NaB), Sodium valproate (VPA), Cyclic hydroxamic acid containing peptides (CHAPs), Depsipeptide FK-228, MGCD0103 and MS-275 can derepress these genes, resulting in antiproliferative effects in vitro and anti tumor effects in vivo.<br><br>

PG = (A57otest - A570T0) / (A57ocontrol - A570T0) x 100 (If A570 test &gt; A57oT0)<br>
PG = (A57otest - A570T0) / (A570T0) x 100 (If A570 test 
 <br>
PG values are plotted against drag concentration to derive the following: GI50 is the concentration required to decrease PG by 50% vs control; TGI is the concentration required to decrease PG by 100% vs control and LC50 is the concentration required to decrease PG by 50% vs T0.

Results for growth inhibition of the synthesized compounds are given in Table-1. HDAC Activity screening:<br><br>
Histone Deacetylase (HDAC) Inhibition Assay using Boc-Lys (Ac)-AMC Substrate: Inhibition of HDAC has been implicated to modulate transcription and to induce apoptosis or differentiation in cancer cells. The fluorometric assay provides a fast and fluorescence based method that eliminates radioactivity, extractions or chromatography, as used in traditional assays. The assay is based on two steps. First, the HDAC fluorometric substrate, which comprises an acetylated lysine side chain, is incubated with a sample containing HDAC activity (Mouse Liver Extract). Deacetylation of the substrate sensitizes the substrate, in the second step; treatment with the Trypsin stop solution produces a fluorophore that can be easily analyzed using fluorescence plate reader.<br><br>
Assay was done in 96-well black microplate and total volume of the assay was 100 uL. Mouse liver enzyme (10 mg/ml) was diluted 1:6 with HDAC buffer. Enzyme cocktail was made of 10 uL of diluted enzyme and 30uL of HDAC buffer. 40^il of enzyme cocktail followed by 10 uL of test compound (1 uM and 10 uM) or buffer (control) was added to each well. The plate was pre-incubated at 37 °C for 5 minutes. The HDAC reaction was started by adding 50ul of HDAC substrate Boc-Lys (Ac)-AMC (Bachem AG, Switzerland). The plate was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 uL of Trypsin stop solution and incubating at 37°C for 15-30 min. <br><br>
Measuring the fluorescence at excitation wavelength of 360 nm and emission wavelength of 460 nm monitored the release of AMC. Buffer alone and substrate alone served as blank. For selected compounds, IC50 (50% HDAC inhibitory concentration) was determined by testing in a broad concentration range of 0.001, 0.01,0.1,1 and 10 uM. (Dennis Wegener et al, Anal Biochem,321,2003,202-208).<br><br>
Results for HDAC inhibition at 1 and 10 pM and IC50 values aret tabulated in Table -1.<br>
denotes 'Not tested'.<br><br>
HDAC Isoform selectivity:<br><br>
Since the Benzamide type compounds are known to have potential for HDAC class I specificity, active compounds in this series were tested for HDAC1 inhibitory activity. The assay was carried out, as previously described using recombinant HDAC1 enzyme (BIOMOL, USA) and following manufacturer's instructions. For determination of IC50 values, compounds were tested at five different concentrations (0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10 uM). The results shown in Table-2 indicate that these compounds inhibit HDAC1 enzyme at nanomolar concentrations, which are much lower as compared to pan HDAC activity in mouse liver enzyme, indicating HDAC isoform specific activity.<br><br>

Detection of Histone (H3) acetylation, Tubulin acetylation and p21 induction:<br><br>
Acetylated histone (H3), acetylated Tubulin and p21 levels were detected in cell lysate by sandwich EUSA method (Cell Signaling Technology, USA, Cat No: 7232, 7204 &amp; 7167 respectively) by following manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, colon cancer cells (HCT116, 10,000/well) were incubated with test compound (1 and 10 M) or medium (control) for 4 hours at 37 °C in CO2 incubator. The incubation lasted 18 hours for p21 induction. After incubation, cell lysates were prepared in cell lysis buffer by sonication on ice. The lysates were collected after centrifugation and subjected to EUSA test procedure. 100 xL of each diluted cell lysate in dilution buffer (1:1) was added to appropriate capture antibody coated microwells and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After washing, 100 L of detection antibody was added for 1 hour at 37 °C. After second washing, 100 \xL of HRP-linked secondary antibody was added for 30 min at 37 °C. <br><br>
Finally, after appropriate washing, 100 uL of TMB substrate was added for 10 min at 37 °C followed by 100 uL of stop solution. The absorbance of individual wells was read using a spectrophotometer at 450 nm (A450). Results were expressed as fold increase (A4sotest/A45o control) as compared to control and shown in Table-3. Selected compounds were tested in these assays and were found to cause histone and tubulin acetylation and induce p21 expression several fold higher as compared to untreated control in colon cancer cells. Thus, these compounds demonstrated good cellular HDAC activity in addition to activity in the isolated enzyme preparations.<br><br>

In vitro metabolic stability in liver microsomes:<br><br>
Metabolic stability is defined as the percentage of parent compound lost over time in the presence of liver microsomes, liver S9, or hepatocytes, depending on the goal of the assay. By understanding the metabolic stability of compounds early in discovery, compounds can be ranked for further studies, and the potential for a drug candidate to fail in development as a result of pharmacokinetic reasons may be reduced.<br><br>
Preparation of phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and stock solutions of test compound (usually in DMSO or water). Incubation of reaction mixture including cryopreserved mouse or human liver microsomes (1 mg/mL), test compound (50 uM), and NADPH for different time points, e.g. 10, 15, 30, and 60 minutes or single time points, e.g. 60 min. Reaction is started by the addition of NADPH and stopped either immediately or after 60 min for screening assay or at 5, 15, 30 and 60 minutes for a more precise estimate of clearance by addition of ice-cold acetonitrile, followed by sample preparation. Determination of loss of parent compound (compared to zero time point control and/or no NADPH-control) was done using HPLC or LC-MS methods. Metabolism was expressed as percentage of test compound metabolized after a certain time. A marker reaction and marker substrate (e.g. testosterone) was employed as quality criteria of the metabolic capability of the microsomes. (Rodrigues, A.D., Use of in vitro human metabolism studies in drug development. An industrial perspective. Biochem Pharm, 48(12): 2147-2156,1994). Metabolic stability was expressed as % metabolism of the compound after 30 min of incubation in the presence of active microsomes. Compound that had a % metabolism less than 30% were defined as highly stable. Compound that had a metabolism between 30% and 60% were defined as moderately stable and compounds that showed a % metabolism higher than 60% were defined as less stable. Several compounds have been found to be stable and moderately stable.<br><br>
In vivo anti-tumor activity:<br><br>
Experiments were carried out using 6-8 week old female athymic SCID (Severe Combined Immune Deficient) mice. The mice were housed in Individually Ventilated Cages (IVC) at constant temperature (22±3 °C) and humidity (50±20%). They had free access to food and water. Tumors were obtained from ATCC, USA and maintained in vivo by subcutaneous (s.c.) passage of tumor fragments (appx 30 mg) in healthy mice according to standard reported procedures. All the animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee, ORLL, Chennai. Each experimental group included 6-8 mice bearing s.c. tumors. Tumors were implanted into the axillary region by puncturing using a Trocar, and tumor growth was monitored by measurement of tumor diameters with a Vernier caliper. Tumor Volume (TV) was calculated according to the following formula: TV(mm3) = LxW2x0.5,<br><br>
Where L and W are the longest diameter and shortest diameter of the tumor, respectively. <br><br>
The compound treatment started when tumors were palpable (150-200 mm3).<br><br>
Test compound was administered by oral gavage in a volume of 5 - 10 ml/kg. Drugs were administered once every day for a period of 21 days. Control mice were administered the vehicle at equivalent volume. Tumor size was measured twice every week and body weight was recorded daily prior to dosing.<br><br>
Test compound (T) efficacy was assessed by calculating several parameters based on tumor volume (TV) with respect to untreated control (C). Parameters routinely assessed were T/C % [TVtest/TVcontroi x 100] and Tumor Volume Inhibition (TVI = 1 - T/C%). <br><br>
Other parameters were Relative Tumor Volume, Percent Tumor volume change, Tumor Delay and Log Cell Kill.<br><br>
Toxic effects of drug treatment were assessed by Body Weight Loss %. Lethal toxicity was defined as any death in treated groups occurring before any control death. Mice were inspected daily for mortality and toxic clinical signs.<br><br>
Results of the Xenograft study:<br><br>
The compound 19 showed good in-vivo anti-cancer activity in HCT116 (colon) xenograft model. Treatment with compound 19 resulted in maximum Tumor Volume Inhibition (TVI) of 42% as compared to vehicle treated control during the course of the study (Figure-1). Furthermore, the compound treatment did not result in significant body weight loss or treatment related mortality as compared to control.<br><br><br><br><br>
