				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The. present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of 10-hydroxy camp-tothecin using Aspergillus ochraceus. Particularly this - relates to a process of biotransformation of camptothecin to 10-HYDROXY CAMPTOTHECIN. The process of present invention uses a new strain of Aspergillus ochraceus designated as RRL 123.<br>
Camptothecin {4 (S)-4-ethyl-4-hydroxy-1-H-pyrano {(3,4,6,7)} indolizino (1,2,b)quinoline- 3,14(4H,12H)} dione of formula 1 as shown in the drawing accompanying this specification belongs to a group of anticancer agents with a unique mechanism; of action poisoning of eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase I. Camptothecin is an alkaloid isolated from the Chinese tree Camptotheca acuminata by Wall and coworkers (J.Am.Chem.Soc.88 3388 1966). Camptothecin and minor camptothecinoids have been obtained from the Indian tree Nothapodytes foetida Sleumer (formerly Mappia foetida Miers by Govindachari (Phytochemistry 11 3529 1972) and Japanese spieces of Nothapodytes obscura, N.obtusifolia, N.piltosporosides, N.tomento-sa and N.collina (Zhang Xiande Bao Juchen et al CN.1,045 266 (CIC07D491) 147.12 Sep.1990 C.A 114 164607v 1991). Other plant source of Camptotheci-noides are Ophiorrhizamungoes Linn. (Tafur et al, Lloydia 39 261 1976)Ervatamia heyneana Wall (Gunsekera S.P.et al  J.Nat.Prod.42,4 75 1979) and Merriliodendron<br>
megacarpus   Helms    (Arisawa M.et.al.Planta Med.43404 1981).<br>
. Camptothecin has been evaluated clinically in China as sodium salt in the treatment of gastric cancer, head, neck, tumour and bladder carcinoma. 10-Hydroxycamptothecin was shown*to possess therapeutic effect in Phase 2 clinical trials on liver carcinoma, leukemia,head and neck cancer .,10-Hydroxycamptothecin was reported to show improved antitumour activity and was found to be ten times more potent against P-388 and L1210 mouse leukemia than the parent camp¬tothecin and was less toxic.' The hydrophobicity of camptothecin precluded its development as clinical agent and necessitated the use of the hydrophilic synthetic congeners in various phases of clinical trials.<br>
Two water-soluble derivatives, topotecan(TPT) and irinotecan (CPT11) have shown promising chemotherapeu-tic efficacy in clinical trials: (Slichenmyer W.J. et a1.J.Natl.Cancer Inst 85 271-287 1983), The later releasing the prodrug, 10-hydroxy-7-ethylcamp-tothecin (SN-38) by metabolic conversion in liver (Potmesil.M.Cancer Res.54 1431-39 1994).<br>
Camptothecinoids belong to a group of anticancer agents with unique mode of action by inhibiting eu-karyotic DNA topoisomerase 1. The cytotoxicity and drug potency of these drugs towards human colon carci¬noma HT2 9 cells were mediated by topoisomerase I for DNA single strand breaks (SSB) during its cleavage (Tanizawa A.et al.J.Nat.Can.Inst. 86(11) 836 1994) .<br>
10-Hydroxycamptothecin (0.005%) and 10-methoxy-camptothecin have been isolated as minor compounds from the extract of stem-wood of C.acuminata by Wall and Wani (J.Org.Ghent.34 1364 1969) .<br>
Chu.K.P. et al   (K'o Hsuech  Tung   Pao 23 761<br>
1970 C.A 10 19733q, 1979)obtained 10-hydroxycamp-tothecin by Camptothecin by Aspergillus T 36. Microbial conversion of 2g of camptothecin with this fungus yielded 140mg of 10-hydroxy camptothecin corresponding to 7% yield.<br>
Creasey and cowerkers(Cancer Treat. Rep.67 167-82 1983) have shown action of 10-Hydroxycamptothecin on P-388 leukemia.<br>
Wani M.C.(J.Med.Chem.23(5)554-560 1980) reported the total synthesis of dl 10-hydroxy-20(S)-camptothe¬cin  with  the ring E intact involving a number of<br>
steps. However,the method gives a low yield and there¬fore is only of academic value.<br>
Kingsbury W.D.(J.Med.Chem.37 98-107,1991) converted camptothecin to 10-Hydroxycamptothecin by reduction-oxidation sequence, using platinum catalyst to afford mixture of compounds including 10-acetoxy-camptothecin and unreacted camptothecin. This method of preparation of 10-hydroxy-20 (s)'-camptothecin was not economically viable.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to develop an improved process for the preparation of 10-hydroxy camptothecin of formula 2* by submerged fermen¬tation using a. strain of Aspergillus ochraceus RRL-123.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of 10-hydroxy camptothecin using Aspergillus ochraceus which comprises cultivating novel strain of Aspergillus ochraceus having characteristics such as herein de¬scribed in a conventional nutrient medium additionally containing glucose 2 to 4%, caseine hydrolysate 0.2 to 0.8% corn steep liquor, 0.02 to 0.05% in a known man¬ner, adding camptothecin in a solvent to the above said growing culture followed by incubating for a period of atleast 24hr, extracting the reaction mixture  with a water immiscible;organic solvent pref-<br>
erably chloro solvent or esters, removing the solvent to get crude to hydroxy camptothecin and further purifying by known chromatographic methods.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the solvent used for dissolving camptothecin may be such as dimethyl  formamide, propylene glycol, ethyl alcohol.<br>
In another embodiment of this invention, the culture medium may be sterilized at a pressure in the range 10-18psig for a period of 10-20 minutes.<br>
In still another embodiment of this invention, incubaton may be effected at temperature ranging from 20°C-30°C on rotary shaker at 220-250 rpm.<br>
In yet another embodiment the organic solvent used for extraction may be such as chloroform, dichloromethane, carbontetrachloride, ethylacetate.<br>
Purification of the product may be effected by conventional chromatography.<br>
Characteristics of Aspergillus ochraceus designated as (RKL 123)<br>
Colonies on Czapek's Dox agar at30°C spreading, reaching 50mm in diameter in 7 days,floccose,surface showing ochraceous shades, consisting of conidiophores<br>
and conidial heads with little aerial mycelium.Conidial heads compact,columnar,upto 60-70u in diameter, sterig-mata in two series, primary commonly 15-30u long, secondary 7-10x1.5-2u.Conidia globose to elliptical, yellow, 3.5-5u, deposited in RRL-Biotech repository.<br>
In the drawing accompanying this specification the scheme of hydroxylation of camptothecin to 10-hydroxy-camptothecin has been suggested which is accomplished by sub-merged fermentation using' a strain of Aspergil¬lus ochraceus RRL123.<br>
10-Hydroxycamptothecin.can be used as sub strate for further modification and to prepare more potent, water-soluble drug which can prove its potency in all phases of clinical trials as hydroxy camptothecin congeners which can be more efficiently absorbed by the body system leading to the development of promising drug for industrial exploitation b&gt;y entrepreneurs.<br>
Accordingly the present  invention provides	an<br>
improved process   for   the   preparation  of	10-<br>
hydroxycamptothecin by Aspergillus ochraceus,  RRL	123<br>
which   comprises  of  following steps:-<br>
The organism, the developed strain of Aspergillus ochraceus RRL123 is inoculated on Sabouraud's agar slants and incubated for 5-10 days. After this the spore suspension from these slants are transferred in a<br>
liquid medium containing casein hydrolysate 0.2-0.8%, glucose 2-4%, cornsteep liquor 0.02-0.05%. The inocu¬lated medium is incubated and shaken continuously for a period of 24-72hrs when optimum growth of myceli¬um is obtained at 25-35°C.<br>
Camptothecin upto 99% pure was added to the grow¬ing culture in a suitable solvent and the enzymatic reaction was continued for a period of 72-2 00hrs. The reaction was monitored by chromatographic tech¬niques TLC,HPLC using different solvent systems and at different wavelengths. The formation of the product was also determined: by UV scanning. The product showed. bathochromic 'shift when treated with dilute base. The final purity of the product was determined by superimposable IR(KBR) 3480(OH)-1740-1755cm-1 (lactone &gt;C=0) and HPLC scanning using diode array detector.<br>
In the embodiment of the present invention is described in detail a process for the selective hy-droxylation of camptothecin to 10-hydroxycamptothecin by submerged fermentation using a strain of Asper¬gillus ochraceus RRL-123.<br>
