Bisoxime ether ketones of the formula la and bisoxime ether oximes of the formula lb are interesting intermediates for preparing the crop protection agents known from WO-A 97/15552.<br><br>
In the prior art, there are only a few documents dedicated to the synthesis of bisoxime or trisoxime derivatives of vicinal triketones. Furthermore, some of the in some cases older documents have inaccurate or erroneous structures (Gazz. Chim. Ital., ei_  (1937), 388; Gazz. Chim. Ital., 5_2 (1922), 289). The structural elucidation of the complex mixtures of substances which are formed, for example, in the reaction of 3-(hydroxyimino)pentane-2,4-dione with hydroxylamine was only possible by modern analytical methods:-in addition to the (E,E,E)- and (E,Z,E)-isomers of the pentane-2,3,4-trione trisoxime, cyclized furoxanes and isoxazoles are formed (J. Chem. Soc, Perkin Trans. II (1987), 523). Owing to the cyclic Dyproducts formed and the wrong regio- and stereochemistry, the substance mixtures obtained by the reaction of triketones and hydroxylamine are not suitable for synthesizing the trione Dis(oxime ether) derivatives la and lb.<br>
\  targeted synthesis of the bisoxime ether oximes lb is described Ln WO 97/15552.<br><br><br>
This synthesis sequence has the disadvantage that the central oxime ether function j(R20-N=C) is only synthesized in the last step. Since the steric demand of the two substituents at the central carbon atom (R1-C=NOR4 and R3-C=NOH) differs only slightly, the oximation does not proceed in a stereoselective manner and, with regard to the bond R20-N, mixtures of isomers are formed which are difficult to separate.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a process which allows the synthesis of compounds of the formulae la and lb in a targeted manner and which additionally affords the desired isomers of these compounds directly, i.e. without an isomer separation.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by the process mentioned at the outset, which comprises<br>
1)  reacting a dione of the formula II,<br><br>
where the substituents R1, R2 and R3 are each as defined above with an alcohol or diol in the presence of an acid to give the ketal of the formula III,<br><br><br>
where the substituents R5 and R6 are each Ci-C6-alkyl, benzyl or Ci-C3-haloalkyl or R5 and R6 together with the carbon and the two oxygen atoms of the ketal function form a ring A<br><br>
where the substituents and the index n have the following meanings:<br>
R7,R8,Rn,R12 are each hydrogen, halogen, Ci-C4-alkyl, Ci-C3-haloalkyl, Ci-Cj-alkoxymethyl, C2-C4-alkenyl, C2-C4-alkynyl or phenyl, where the latter may be substituted by nitro or halogen;<br>
R9,R10 •     each have one of the meanings given for R7, R8, R11 or R12 and R9 and R10 together form an exo-methylene group or a carbonyl group and<br>
n	is 0,1 or 2,<br>
2)     converting the result ketal III<br>
a)	with an alkoxyamine of the formula R40-NH2, where R4 is as defined above, or one of its acid addition salts, or<br>
b)	with hydroxylamine or its acid addition salt and subsequent alkylation with an alkylating agent R4-Lz, where R4 is as defined above and L1 is a nucleophilically replaceable leaving group, into the bisoxime ether ketal IV,<br><br><br>
where the substituents R-1 to Rb are each as defined above, and<br>
3)  hydrolyzing the bisoxime ether ketal IV obtained in this man¬ner in the presence of acid,<br>
a)  to give the bisoxime ether ketone la,<br><br>
or<br>
b)  aminating it with hydroxylamine or its acid addition salt to give the bisoxime ether oxime lb,<br><br>
By the process according to the invention, it is possible to synthesize, in a targeted manner, compounds of the formula la or lb, depending in each case on the design of step 3). A further advantage of the process is the fact that the compounds la and lb are obtained in isomerically pure form with regard to the central Dxime ether unit.<br>
\  particular embodiment of the process is shown in scheme 1.<br><br>
Scheme 1"<br><br>
lb' By conducting the reaction in a suitable manner, it is possible to obtain preferably the E,E-isomer la' and E,Z,E-isomer lb' via the bisoxime ether ketals IV (see scheme 1):<br>
-	in step 1) diols, such as, for example, ethylene glycol,<br>
1,3-propane diol or preferably 2,2-dimethyl-l,3-propanediol<br>
are employed which afford the cyclic ketals III.<br>
-	the oximation step is carried out according to variant 2a). Specifically, the ketal III is reacted with an acid addition salt of the alkoxyamine R40-NH2 at 20-65°C and the acid which is released during the reaction is at least partially bound by addition of bases.<br>
-	in step 3a)/3b), the hydrolysis/aminolysis is started at a pH of from 0.5.-1.5 and at 20-40°C.<br>
If, on the other hand, for example dimethyl ketal Ilia (R5, R6 = methyl), which is hydrolyzed (step 3a) or aminated (step 3b) at temperatures above 40°C, is used as starting material, the fractions of the Z-isomer la" or lb" in the reaction mixture generally increase.<br><br><br>
The individual process steps are illustrated in more detail below.<br>
1) Ketal formation<br><br>
II	HI<br>
The ketal formation can generally be carried out with Cx-Ce-alkanols, such as, for example, methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, isobutanol, s-butanol, n-pentanol, with benzyl alcohol or with Ci-C3-haloalkyl alcohols, such as, for example, 2,2,2-trichloroethanol. Particularly suitable are diols, such as, for example, o-dihydroxybenzene, ethylene glycol (1,2-ethanediol),<br>
1-(2-nitrophenyl)-1,2-ethanediol, hex-5-ene-l,2-diol, 1,3-propanediol, 2,2-dimethyl-l,3-propanediol, 3-bromo-1,2-propanediol, 2-exo-methylene-1,3-propanediol, 2,2-dibromo-1,3-propanediol, 1,4-butanediol, l,4-dimethoxy-2,3-butanediol. Particularly suitable are sterically demanding diols, such as 1,3-propanediol and 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-propanediol.<br>
The ketal formation is generally carried out in the presence of acids, such as BF3 x Et20 (Lewis acid) or preferably Bronstedt acids, such as sulfuric acid, hydrogen chloride, hydrogen bromide or hydrogen iodide, perchloric acid, orthophosphoric acid, polyphosphoric acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, p-dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid or camphor sulfonic acid. Preference is given to using p-toluenesulfonic acid or sulfuric acid.<br>
The acid is usually employed in catalytic amounts of from 0.05 to 2 mol% and preferably from 0.5 to 1 mol%, based on the dione II.<br>
The reaction temperature generally depends on the nature of the alcohol employed and is generally 20-150°C and preferably 60-110°C. When using diols, a temperature of 60-90°C has been found to be advantageous in many cases.<br><br>
The water formed during the reaction is usually removed from the reaction mixture. To this end, the methods described in the prior art are employed (see, for example, Organikum, Barth Verlagsgesellschaft, Leipzig).<br>
The water of reaction can, on the one hand, be removed using dehydrating agents, such as, for example, ortho esters. The ortho ester, such as, for example, trimethyl orthoformate, is generally employed in a concentration of from 1 to 1.5 molar equivalents. The reaction time is generally from 0.5 to 3 hours.<br>
On the other hand, it has been found advantageous to remove the water of reaction using entrainers, such as toluene or cyclohexane. The end point of the reaction can be determined easily by the amount of water which is separated off. In some cases, it is advantageous to carry out the reaction at reduced pressure.<br>
The preferred solvent is the alcohol that is required for the ketalization, which is in this case generally employed in excess. Good results were obtained using, for example, 1-10 molar equivalents of diol. If the ketalization is carried out by removal of water in the presence of an entrainer, the amount of diol can generally be reduced to 1-3 molar equivalents. Suitable solvents are furthermore hydrocarbons, such as, for example, toluene or cyclohexane, halogenated hydrocarbons, such as chlorobenzene or methylene chloride, amides, such as dimethylformarnide, and ethers, such as diethyl ether or dioxane.<br>
The reaction mixtures are worked up, for example, by extraction with a nonpolar solvent, such as an ether, halogenated hydrocarbon or, in particular, a hydrocarbon, such as cyclohexane. After the aqueous phase has been separated off, the organic phase can generally be employed directly in the subsequent oximation step. In many cases, it is not even necessary to exchange the solvent.<br>
The diones of the formula II are known from the literature or can be prepared by methods known from the literature [cf. Indian J. Chem. B, (1991) 749-753; Bull. Acad. Sci. USSR Div. Chem. Sci. (Engl. Transl.) 28, (1979) 121-128; EP-A 416 857].<br>
In particular, the diones II can be prepared by the procedure illustrated in more detail below.<br><br>
The 1,3-diketones of the formula V<br><br>
are converted by nitrozation into compounds of the formula VI,<br><br>
where the substituents R1 and R3 in the formulae V and VI are as defined in claim 1.<br>
The nitrozation is usually carried out using	sodium nitrite in<br>
the presence of a carboxylic acid or mineral	acid. Acetic acid,<br>
hydrochloric acid and in particular sulfuric	acid are<br>
particularly suitable.<br>
In general, the nitrozation is carried out at from -10 to 60°C and in particular at from 10 to 20°C.<br>
In general, the nitrozation is carried out at a pH of from 2 to 6 and in particular at a pH of from 4 to 5.<br>
The following process variants were found to be particularly advantageous: i) the 1,3-diketone V is initially charged in aqueous sodium nitrite solution. The acid is then added dropwise at a pH of from 4 to 5; ii) the 1,3-diketone V is initially charged in water and the acid and the aqueous sodium nitrite solution are simultaneously metered in at a pH of from 4 to 5.<br>
Furthermore, it may be advantageous to add an organic solvent in which the compound VI is soluble, at the beginning or the end of the reaction. The resulting solutions can be employed directly for the subsequent alkylation step. An intermediate isolation of the thermally and hydrolytically unstable compound VI can thus be avoided. In certain cases, it may furthermore be advantageous to replace the solvent used for the extraction of VI by a solvent which is more suitable for the alkylation. Solvents which are particularly suitable for the extraction are aprotic, if appropriate partially water-miscible solvents, for example halogenated hydrocarbons, such as methylene chloride, carboxylic<br><br><br><br>
  i<br>
IVa<br>
2a) The alkoxyamine R40-NH2 is employed either in the form of an acid addition salt or as free base, where the latter can be released from the salt by addition of a strong base.<br>
Preference is given to using the acid addition salts of the alkoxyamine. All customary acids are suitable for preparing the acid addition salts. Hereinbelow, only a few examples are given: carboxylic acids, such as acetic acid or propionic acid, dicarboxylic acids, such as oxalic acid or succinic acid, mineral acids, such as phosphoric acid or carbonic acid, and in particular hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid.<br>
If the acid addition salts of the alkoxyamine are employed, it is generally advantageous to add a base to bind the acid which is released during the reaction. In many cases, a pH of from 2 to 5 and in particular of from 3 to 4 has been found to be advantageous for the oximation.<br>
In general, from 1 to 2.5 molar equivalents of a base are added. Suitable bases are, in particular, pyridines, trialkylamines, sodium hydroxide, sodium acetate and sodium methoxide. If sodium acetate is used, it is customary to add glacial acetic acid.<br>
Conversely, it is of course also possible to employ the alkoxyamine as free base and to use one of the abovementioned acids to set the abovementioned pH range.<br>
Suitable solvents are, for example, the solvents described in the preceding step. Also suitable are carboxylic acids, such as acetic acid, ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether,<br><br>
methyl tert-butyl ether, or else water/pyridine mixtures. Particularly suitable are alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol or isopropanol.<br>
It has furthermore been found to be advantageous to use the solvent employed in the ketalization, or the solvent mixture which is present after work-up of the ketals III, for the oximation step, too. If appropriate, it may be expedient to add other solvents to the mixture. Thus, steps 1) and 2) can be carried out as a one-pot variant.<br>
The reaction temperature is generally from -20 to 150°C and preferably from 0 to 100°C and in particular from 20 to 65°C.<br>
2b) The procedure described under 2a) can also be carried out in two steps, by firstly reacting the ketal III with hydroxylamine or its acid addition salt and subsequent alkylation with R4-Lx. With regard to the way the reaction is carried out, -the statements made above apply.<br>
The reaction mixture is preferably worked up as described in the preceding step, by extractive methods.<br>
3) ketal cleavage: (a) hydrolysis and (b) amination<br><br>
The ketal is generally cleaved in an acidic medium. A pH of from 0 to 2 and preferably from 0.5 to 1.5 has been found to be advantageous.<br>
The pH range mentioned above can be set using any customary acid. Acetic a,cid, hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid, for example, have been found to be suitable.<br>
The cleavage of the ketal can be carried out with or without addition of a solvent. It has been found to be advantageous to ase organic solvents which are stable in the abovementioned pH range (for example ethyl acetate). It may also be advantageous to ise a solvent which is monophasically miscible with water/acid. Particularly suitable here are alcohols, such as, for example, rtethanol. The cleavage of the ketal can be carried out advantageously, for example, in water/methanol/glacial acetic<br><br>
acid (a -suitable mixing ratio is, for example: 1/1/0.2) or ethyl acetate/water mixtures.<br>
The aminolysis to give the compounds lb is carried out under the conditions mentioned for the ketal cleavage, but in the presence of hydroxylamine or its acid addition salt. All customary acids are suitable for preparing the acid addition salts. Hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid have been found to be particularly advantageous.<br>
The hydroxylamine or its acid addition salt is generally employed in a ratio of from 1 to 2 and preferably from 1 to 1.3 molar equivalents, based on the bisoxime ether ketal IV.<br>
The reaction temperature is generally 0-150°C. Lower reaction temperatures of from 20 to 40°C have been found to be particularly advantageous for preparing the isomers la' and in particular lb'. At high reaction temperatures (&gt;40°C)r the proportion of the isomers la' and lb' generally increases.<br>
Work-up of the reaction mixtures is preferably carried out as described in the two preceding steps, by extraction.<br>
The compounds of the formula lb can be purified, for example, via their sodium salt. By adding a base, the oximes can be converted into the corresponding salt. The bisoxime ether oxime lb can subsequently be rereleased by subsequent acidification from the salt which has been, if appropriate, separated off or purified.<br><br><br><br>

ac) star-ting from Example 6<br>
By the method of procedure 12 aa), 216 g (1 mol) of the ketal (Example 6), and 139 g (2 mol) of hydroxylammonium chloride in a solvent mixture of 500 ml of THF, 500 ml of water and 500 ml of glacial acetic"acid gave 125 g of the title compound as colorless crystals, which corresponds to a yield of 67%.<br>
b) Oximation with hydroxylammonium sulfate<br>
ba) starting from Example 8<br>
At 25°C, 740 ml of water, 74 ml of cone, hydrochloric acid, 148 ml of glacial acetic acid and 73.3 g (0.44 7 Mol) of hydroxylammonium sulfate were admixed with a solution of 297 g (0.739 Mol) of Example 8 (crude; 64.2% EE-isomer) in 740 ml of methanol. The mixture was stirred at 25°C for 24 hours. By addition of dil. NaOH, a pH of 6 was set and the reaction solution was extracted twice with methyl tert-butyl ether. The combined organic phases were washed with saturated NaHC03 solution and dried. The solvent was distilled off on a rotary evaporator. 190.9 g of the title compound having an isomer ratio EZE : EZZ of 89.4 : 10.6. were isolated. According to quantitative HPLC, the yield of EZE isomer was 87.9%.<br>
In further experiments, it was shown that the presence of the cosolvent glacial acetic acid can be dispensed with.<br><br><br>
