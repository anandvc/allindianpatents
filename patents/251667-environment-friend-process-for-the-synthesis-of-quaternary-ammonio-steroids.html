				<td>The invention relates to a new, environment-friend process for the synthesis of 4,4'-<br>
[3α,17β-bis(acetoxy)-5α-androstane-2β,16β-diyl]-bis(1,1-dimethyl-piperazinium) dibromide<br>
of formula (I) (from now on pipecuronium bromide)<br><br>
and 1-[3α,17β-bis(acetoxy)-2β-(1-piperidinyl)-5α-androstane-16β-yl]-1-methyl-piperidinium<br>
bromide of formula (II) (from now on vecuronium bromide).<br><br>
Furthermore the invention relates to the new intermediates of formula (III)<br><br><br>
and formula (IV)<br><br>
of the process, wherein the meaning of X- is benzenesulfonate - in given case para-<br>
substituted with a methyl or a nitro group or a bromine atom - methanesulfonate,<br>
ethanesulfonate or trifluoromethanesulfonate ion.<br>
Pipecuronium bromide and vecuronium bromide are known to be curare like, non-<br>
depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents, which inhibit the transmission of the nerve-<br>
impulses to the striped muscles. Their effect can be terminated by addition of antidotes. Both<br>
compounds have wide clinical application due to their excellent biological effect. Their main<br>
application is in the surgery as muscle-relaxants during intubation narcosis. Other applications<br>
can be in the shock therapy and in the spasmic disorders of striped muscles.<br>
The synthesis of pipecuronium bromide is described in the Hungarian patent No.<br>
165,000, according to which it is a multistep chemical synthesis starting from<br>
2α,3α,16α,17α-diepoxy-17-acetoxy-5α-androstane. An improved synthesis is described in<br>
the following publication: Arzneimittel Forschung (Drug Res.) 30(I), 29, 342-346.<br>
The synthesis of vecuronim bromide is described in the GB patent No. 1,454,749 and<br>
in the Hungarian patent No. 154,368. A detailed summary can also be found in the following<br>
publication: J.Med.Chem. 16, 1116(1973).<br>
The final step of the known synthesis of pipecuronium bromide and vecuronium<br>
bromide is the quaternary ammonium salts formation with methyl bromide in acetone or<br>
diethyl ether solution from the diacetate derivatives of formula (V)<br><br><br>
and formula (VI)<br><br>
respectively.<br>
It is known that methyl bromide — used as quaternary ammonium salts forming agent<br>
in the above procedures - is a highly toxic, colorless, slightly smelling gas at room<br>
temperature, moreover it is an ozone layer damaging compound. Considering its latter feature<br>
its industrial use is strictly limited by the Hungarian decree No. 94/2003 (2.07.) referring to<br>
ozone layer damaging compounds, therefor it is practical to use an other quaternary<br>
ammonium salts forming agent, which is less or not at all toxic.<br>
Our invention relates to a new process for the synthesis of quaternary ammonium salts<br>
of diacetate derivatives of formula (V) and (VI) without using methyl bromide as reagent.<br>
Surprisingly it was found that the "sulfonate" ions of the "sulfonate salt" type intermediates of<br>
formula (HI) and (IV) of our invention can be changed for bromide ions - in spite of the fact<br>
that generally it is an equilibrium reaction - using lithium bromide as reagent and choosing<br>
the appropriate: reaction conditions the equilibrium can be shifted towards the. formation of<br><br>
pipecuronium bromide or vecuronium bromide in 99 % selectivity, therefor the methyl<br>
bromide reagent can be replaced by „sulfonyl methyl esters".<br>
According to our invention the process is the following:<br>
a.) to stirred solutions of the diacetate derivatives of formula (V) or (VI) in acetone,<br>

of formula (III) or (IV) - wherein the meaning of X" is benzenesulfonate, in given case para-<br>
substituted with a methyl or a nitro group or a bromine atom, or methanesulfonate or<br>
ethanesulfonate ion - are separated,<br>
and after an optional purifying and drying, are dissolved in acetonitrile, 2.5-5.0<br>
equivalents of lithium bromide (calculated on the starting material), is added to the stirred<br>
solution, the precipitated lithium salts formed as by-products are filtered off, washed with<br>

trifluoromethanesulfonate is added at 10-35 °C,<br>
the precipitated (when the reaction is carried out in acetone after dilution of the<br>
reaction mixture with ether) quaternary ammonio derivative of formula (IV) - wherein the<br>
meaning of X- is trifluoromethanesulfonate ion- is separated, and<br>

acetone, adding 2.5-4.0 equivalents of lithium bromide (calculated on the starting material) to<br>
the stirred solution, and drying after an optionally purifying the precipitated product of<br>
formula (I), or<br>
e.) adding 1.0-1.1 equivalents (calculated on nitrogen atoms to be quaternized) of<br>
methyl trifluoromethanesulfonate to a stirred solution of the diacetate derivative of formula<br>
(VI)	in acetone, ether or tetrahydrofuran at 10-35 °C,<br>
separating the precipitated (when the reaction is carried out in acetone after diluting of<br>
the reaction mixture with ether) quaternary ammonio derivative of formula (IV) - wherein the<br>
meaning of X- is trifluoromethanesulfonate ion -, and<br>
after an optional purifying and drying dissolving the quaternary ammonio derivative of<br>
formula (IV) - wherein the meaning of X- is trifluoromethanesulfonate ion - in acetone,<br>
adding 2.5-4.0 equivalents of lithium bromide (calculated on the starting material) to the<br>
stirred solution drying after an optionally purifying the precipitated product of formula (II), or<br><br>
f.) adding 1.0-1.1 equivalents (calculated on nitrogen atoms to be quaternized) of<br>
methyl trifluoromethanesulfonate to a stirred solution of the diacetate derivatives of formula<br>
(V) or formula (VI) in acetone, acetonitrile, ethyl acetate or tetrahydrofuran at 10-35 °C,<br>
reacting the reaction mixture containing the quaternary ammonium salts of formula<br>
(III)	or (IV) - wherein the meaning of X- is trifluoromethanesulfonate ion - with 2.5-4.0<br>
equivalents of lithium bromide (calculated on the quaternary ammonium salts of formula (III)<br>
or (IV), wherein the meaning of X- is trifluoromethanesulfonate ion),<br>
and after an optional purifying drying the separated precipitated products of formula<br>
(I) or (II), or<br>
g.) adding 2.5-4.0 molequivalents of methyl p-toluenesulfonate to a stirred solution of<br>
the diacetate derivative of formula (V) in ethanol below 30 °C,<br>
subsequently, after the reaction is completed, adding 2.5-5.0 equivalents of lithium<br>
bromide (calculated on the starting material) to the stirred solution,<br>
then after the reaction is completed, diluting the reaction mixture with tetrahydrofuran,<br>
after the precipitation is completed, separating the precipitated quaternary ammonio derivative<br>
of formula (I), washing with tetrahydrofuran, after drying disolving in ethanol, stirring the<br>
solution with 0.2-0.5 equivalents of lithium bromide, diluting with tetrahydrofuran, and<br>
separating, washing and drying the precipitated compound of formula (I).<br>
6.	Process d) for the synthesis of 4,4'-[3α,17β-bis(acetoxy)-5α-androstane-2β,16β-<br>
diyl]-bis(1,1-dimethyl-piperazinium) dibromide of formula (I) as claimed in claim 5, wherein<br>
by reacting the reaction mixture containing the quaternary ammonium salt of formula (III) -<br>
wherein the meaning of X- is trifluoromethanesulfonate ion - with lithium bromide without<br>
isolating the quaternary ammonium salt of formula (III).<br>
7.	Process e) for the synthesis of 1-[3α,17β-bis(acetoxy)-2β-(1-piperidinyl)-5α-<br>
androstane-16β-yl]-1-methyl-piperidinium bromide of formula (II) as claimed in claim 5,<br>
wherein by reacting the reaction mixture containing the quaternary ammonium salt of formula<br>
(IV)	- wherein the meaning of X- is trifluoromethanesulfonate ion - with lithium bromide<br>
without isolating the quaternary ammonium salt of formula (IV).<br><br><br>
The invention relates to a new,<br>
environment-friend process for the synthesis of the<br>
known	4,4'-[3α,17β-bis(acetoxy)-5α-androstane-<br>
2β,16β-diyl]-bis(1,1-dimethyl-piperazinium) dibromide<br>
of formula (I) (from now on pipecuronium bromide)<br>

-16β-yl]-1-methyl-piperidinium bromide of<br>
formula (II) (from now on vecuronium bromide).<br>
Furthermore the invention relates to the new intermediates<br>
of formula (III) and formula (IV) of the process, wherein<br>
the meaning of X is benzenesulfonate - in given case<br>
para-substituted with a methyl or a nitro group or a<br>
bromine atom - methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate or<br>
