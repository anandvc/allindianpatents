COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
“ANTHRANILAMIDE ARTHROPODICIDE TREATMENT”<br>
E.I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY, a Corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware, U.S.A., of 1007 Market Street, Wilmington, Delaware   19898, United States of America<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertain the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION <br>
This invention relates to the control of phytophagous invertebrate pests such as <br>
5     	arthropod pests by contacting plant propagules or the locus of the propagules with certain anthranilamides and to propagule-coating compositions comprising the anthranilamides.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The control of invertebrate pests such as arthropods is extremely important in achieving high crop efficiency.    Damage by invertebrate pests to growing and stored<br>
10 	agronomic crops can cause significant reduction in productivity and thereby result in increased costs to the consumer. The control of invertebrate pests in forestry, greenhouse crops, ornamentals and nursery crops is also important.<br>
Plants are subject to injury by invertebrate pests at all stages of growth, beginning with seeds or other propagules such as bulbs, tubers, rhizomes, conns, and stem and leaf cuttings<br>
15 	and ending with mature plants. Besides the cost of materials, the effort and time required for application of invertebrate pest control substances make repetition of treatments undesirable. Ideally a single treatment of a plant at the propagule stage would protect the plant from invertebrate pests during its entire life.<br>
A variety of techniques for treating propagules with plant protection substances are<br>
20 	known. These include soaking propagules in arthropodicide-comprising solutions, coating propagules with films, pelleting materials and the like comprising arthropodicidal compositions, and applying arthropodicidal compounds to the growing medium surrounding the propagules. While some compounds can effectively protect propagules from certain phytophagous invertebrate pests, new compounds are needed that are more effective or have<br>
25 	a broader spectrum of activity, are less costly, less toxic, environmentally safer or have different modes of action.<br>
Particularly needed are invertebrate pest control treatments that can protect the plant not only at its propagule stage but also later in its development. Achieving this objective requires compounds that are active against invertebrate pests and can effectively translocate<br>
30	 from the locus of the propagule up through the growing stems, leaves and other aboveground plant parts. Furthermore the compounds need to have high activity against invertebrate pests to compensate for the dilution occasioned by the expanding plant mass. Also, the compounds cannot rapidly degrade and lose their biological potency in the environment of the plant's vascular tissues.   The combination of these properties is rare.   Treatments of<br>
35 	propagules effective for protecting from phytophagous invertebrate pests not only the propagule but also the plant at later growth stages have now been discovered.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION <br>
As referred to in the present disclosure and claims, the term "propagule" means a seed or a regenerable plant part. The term "regenerable plant part" means a part of a plant other<br><br>
WO 03/024222<br><br>
PCT/US02/30302<br><br><br>
than a seed from which a whole plant may be grown or regenerated when the plant part is placed in horticultural or agricultural growing media such as moistened soil, peat moss, sand, yermiculite, perlite, rock wool, fiberglass, coconut husk fiber, tree fern fiber and the like, or even a completely liquid medium such as water. Regenerable plant parts commonly include <br>
5    	 rhizomes, tubers, bulbs and corms of such geophytic plant species as potato, sweet potato, yam, onion, dahlia, tulip, narcissus, etc. Regenerable plant parts include plant parts that are divided (e.g., cut) to preserve their ability to grow into a new plant. Therefore regenerable plant parts include viable divisions of rhizomes, tubers, bulbs and corms which retain meristematic tissue, such as an eye. Regenerable plant parts can also include other plant<br>
10    	parts such as cut or separated stems and leaves from which some species of plants can be grown using horticultural or agricultural growing media. As referred to in the present disclosure and claims, unless otherwise indicated, the term "seed" includes both unsprouted seeds and sprouted seeds in which the testa (seed coat) still surrounds part of the emerging shoot and root.<br>
15		In the above recitations, the term "alkyl", used either alone or in compound words<br>
such as "alkylthio" or "haloalkyl" includes straight-chain or branched alkyl, such as, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, /-propyl, or the different butyl, pentyl or hexyl isomers. "Alkenyl" includes straight-chain or branched alkenes such as 1-propenyl, 2-propenyl, and the different butenyl, pentenyl andhexenyl isomers. "Alkenyl" also includes polyenes such as 1,2-propadienyl<br>
20    	 and 2,4-hexadienyl. "Alkynyl" includes straight-chain or branched alkynes such as<br>
1-propynyl, 2-propynyl and the different butynyl, pentynyl and hexynyl isomers. "Alkynyl" can also include moieties comprised of multiple triple bonds such as 2,5-hexadiynyl. "Alkoxy" includes, for example, methoxy, ethoxy, n-propyloxy, isopropyloxy and the different butoxy, pentoxy and hexyloxy isomers. "Alkoxyalkyl" denotes alkoxy substitution<br>
25     on alkyl. Examples of "alkoxyalkyl" include CH3OCH2, CH3OCH2CH2, CH3CH2OCH2, CH3CH2CH2CH2OCH2 and CH3CH2OCH2CH2. "Alkylthio" includes branched or straight-chain alkylthio moieties such as methylthio, ethylthio, and the different propylthio, butylthio, pentylthio andhexylthio isomers. "Cycloalkyl" includes, for example, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl.<br>
30	The term "heterocyclic ring" or "heterocyclic ring system" denotes rings or ring<br>
systems in which at least one ring atom is not carbon and comprises 1 to 4 hetero atoms independently selected from the group consisting of nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur, provided that each heterocyclic ring comprises no more than 4 nitrogens, no more than 2 oxygens and no more than 2 sulfurs. The heterocyclic ring can be attached through any available carbon<br>
35     or nitrogen by replacement of hydrogen on said carbon or nitrogen. The term "aromatic ring system" denotes fully unsaturated carbocycles and heterocycles in which at least one ring of the polycyclic ring system is aromatic (where aromatic indicates that the Huckel rule is satisfied for the ring system). The term "heteroaromatic ring" denotes fully aromatic rings in<br>
5 <br>
WO 03/024222<br><br>
PCT/US02/30302<br><br><br>
which at least one ring atom is not carbon and comprises 1 to 4 heteroatoms independently selected from the group consisting of nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur, provided that each heterocyclic ring comprises no more than 4 nitrogens, no more than 2 oxygens and no more than 2 sulfurs (where aromatic indicates that the Huckel rule is satisfied). The heterocyclic<br>
5     	ring can be attached through any available carbon or nitrogen by replacement of hydrogen on said carbon or nitrogen. The term "aromatic heterocyclic ring system" includes fully aromatic heterocycles and heterocycles in which at least one ring of a polycyclic ring system is aromatic (where aromatic indicates that the Huckel rule is satisfied). The term "fused heterobicyclic ring system" includes a ring system comprised of two fused rings in which at<br>
10    	 least one ring atom is not carbon and can be aromatic or non aromatic, as defined above.<br>
The term "halogen", either alone or in compound words such as "haloalkyl", includes fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine. Further, when used in compound words such as "haloalkyl", said alkyl may be partially or fully substituted with halogen atoms which may be the same or different. Examples of "haloalkyl" include F3C, CICH2, CF3CH2 and<br>
15     CF3CC12. The terms "haloalkenyl", "haloalkynyl", "haloalkoxy", and the like, are defined analogously to the term "haloalkyl". Examples of "haloalkenyl" include (C1)2 CHCH2 and CF3CH2CH=CHCH2. Examples of "haloalkynyl" include HOCCHC1, CF3OC, CCI3OC and FCH2C2 CCH2. Examples of "haloalkoxy" include CF30, CC13CH20, HCF2CH2CH20 and CF3CH20.<br>
20	The total number of carbon atoms in a substituent group is indicated by the "Cj-Cj"<br>
prefix where i and j are numbers from 1 to 8. For example, C1-C4 alkylsulfonyl designates methylsulfonyl through butylsulfonyl; C2 alkoxyalkyl designates CH3OCH2; C3 alkoxyalkyl designates, for example, CH3CH(OCH3), CH3OCH2CH2 or CH3CH2OCH2; and C4 alkoxyalkyl designates the various isomers of an alkyl group substituted with an alkoxy<br>
25     group containing a total of four carbon atoms, examples including CH3CH2CH2OCH2 and CH3CH20CH2CH2. In the above recitations, when a compound of Formula I comprises a heterocyclic ring, all substituents are attached to this ring through any available carbon or nitrogen by replacement of a hydrogen on said carbon or nitrogen.<br>
When a group has a substituent which can be hydrogen, for example R3, then, when<br>
30     this substituent is taken as hydrogen, it is recognized that this is equivalent to said group being unsubstituted.<br>
Compounds of Formula I can exist as one or more stereoisomers. The various stereoisomers include enantiomers, diastereomers, atropisomers and geometric isomers. One skilled in the art will appreciate that one stereoisomer may be more active and/or may<br>
35     exhibit beneficial effects when enriched relative to the other stereoisomer(s) or when separated from the other stereoisomer(s). Additionally, the skilled artisan knows how to separate, enrich, and/or to selectively prepare said stereoisomers. Accordingly, the<br>
6<br><br>
WO 03/024222<br><br>
PCM/S02/30302<br><br>
6<br>
compounds of the invention may be present as a mixture of stereoisomers, individual stereoisomers, or as an optically active form.<br>
The salts of compounds of Formula I include acid-addition salts with inorganic or  organic acids such as hydrobromic, hydrochloric, nitric, phosphoric, sulfuric, acetic, butyric, <br>
5     	fumaric, lactic, maleic, malonic, oxalic, propionic, salicylic, tartaric, 4-toluenesulfonic or valeric acids.<br>

30	Preferred 4. A compound of Preferred 2 wherein R3 is C1-C4 alkyl and R6 is CI or Br.<br>
As noted above, R7 is (among others) a phenyl, a benzyl, a 5- or 6-membered heteroaromatic ring, a naphthyl ring system or an aromatic 8-, 9- or 10-membered fused heterobicyclic ring system, each ring or ring system optionally substituted with one to three substituents  independently  selected  from  R9.     The term  "optionally substituted"  in<br><br>
WO 03/024222<br><br>
PCT/US02/30302<br><br>
connection with these R7 groups refers to groups which are unsubstiruted or have at least one non-hydrogen substituent that does not extinguish the invertebrate pest control activity possessed by the unsubstiruted analog. Note also that J-l through J-4 below denote 5- or 6-membered heteroaromatic rings. An example of a phenyl ring optionally substituted with<br>
5 	1 to 3 R9 is the ring illustrated as J-5 in Exhibit 1, wherein r is an integer from 0 to 3.  An example of a benzyl ring optionally substituted with 1 to 3 R9 is the ring illustrated as J-6 in Exhibit 1, wherein r is an integer from 0 to 3.   An example of a naphthyl ring system optionally substituted with 1 to 3 R9 is illustrated as J-59 in Exhibit 1, wherein r is an integer from 0 to 3.   Examples of a 5- or 6-membered heteroaromatic ring optionally substituted <br>
10	with 1 to 3 R9 include the rings J-7 through J-58 illustrated in Exhibit 1 wherein r is an integer from 0 to 3. Note that J-7 through J-26 are examples of J-l, J-27 through J-41 are examples of J-2, and J-46 through J-58 are examples of J-3 and J-4. The nitrogen atoms that require substitution to fill their valence are substituted with H or R9.   Note that some J groups can only be substituted with less than 3 R9 groups (e.g. J-l9, J-20, J-23 through J-26 and<br>
15 	J-37 through J-40 can only be substituted with one R9). Examples of aromatic 8-, 9- or 10-membered fused heterobicyclic ring systems optionally substituted with 1 to 3 R9 include J-60 through J-90 illustrated in Exhibit 1 wherein r is an integer from 0 to 3.  Although R9 groups are .shown in the structures J-5 through J-90, it is noted that they do not need to be present since they are optional substituents. Note that when the attachment point between <br>
20	(R9)r and the J group is illustrated as floating, (R9)r can be attached to any available carbon atom of the J group.  Note that when the attachment point on the J group is illustrated as floating, the J group can be attached to the remainder of Formula I through any available carbon of the J group by replacement of a hydrogen atom.<br>

The method of Scheme 1 involves coupling of an amine of Formula 2 with an acid chloride of Formula 3 in the presence of an acid scavenger to provide the compound of Formula la. <br>
5     	Typical acid scavengers include amine bases such as triethylamine,<br>
N,N-diisopropylemylamine and pyridine; other scavengers include hydroxides such as sodium and potassium hydroxide and carbonates such as sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate. In certain instances it is useful to use polymer-supported acid scavengers such as polymer-bound NN-diisopropylethylamine and polymer-bound 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine.<br>
10     The coupling can be run in a suitable inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, diethylether or dichloromethane to afford the anilide of Formula la.<br>
A thioamide of Formula lb can be obtained in a subsequent step from the corresponding amide of Formula la by treatment with one of a variety of standard thio transfer reagents including phosphorus pentasulfide and Lawesson's reagent (2,4-bis(4-<br>
15     methoxyphenyl)-1,3-dithia-2,4-diphosphetane-2,4-disulflde).<br>

R1 substituents such as C1-C6 alkyl can be introduced at this stage through well known methodologies including either direct alkylation or through the generally preferred method of reductive alkylation of the amine. As is further shown in Scheme 3, a commonly employed procedure is to combine<br>
20	the amine 2a with an aldehyde in the presence of a reducing agent such as sodium cyanoborohydride to produce the Formula 2b compounds where R1 is C1-C5 alkyl.<br>

'the reaction of Scheme 7 can be run neat or in a variety of suitable solvents including tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether, pyridine, dichloromethane or chloroform with optimum temperatures ranging from room temperature to the reflux temperature of the solvent. The general reaction of benzoxazinones with amines to produce anthranilamides is well documented in the chemical literature.

10 	The method of Scheme 15 involves 3+2 cycloaddition of an appropriately substituted iminohalide 22 with either substituted propiolates of Formula 23 or acrylates of Formula 25. Cycloaddition with an acrylate requires additional oxidation of the intermediate pyrazoline to the pyrazole. Hydrolysis of the esters affords the pyrazole acids of Formula 4c. Preferred iminohalides for this reaction include the trifluoromethyl iminochloride of Formula 26 and<br>
15     the iminodibromide of Formula 27. Compounds such as 26 are known (J. Heterocycl. Chem.<br>

The starting pyrazoles of Formula 17 are known compounds or can be prepared<br>
5 	according to known methods. The pyrazole of Formula 17a (the compound of Formula 17 wherein R6 is CF3 and R8 is H) can be prepared by literature procedures (J. Fluorine Chem. 1991, 53(1), 61-70). The pyrazoles of Formula 17c (compounds of Formula 17 wherein R6 is CI or Br and R^ is H) can also be prepared by literature procedures (Chem. Ber. 1966, 99(10), 3350-7).    A useful alternative method for the preparation of compound 17c is<br>

derivatives of Formula 29. Removal of the sulfamoyl group with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)<br>
at room temperature proceeds cleanly and in good yield to afford the pyrazoles of Formula<br>

Reaction of a compound of Formula 30 wherein R13 is Ci-C4 alkyl with a suitable base in a suitable organic solvent affords the cyclized product of Formula 31 after neutralization with <br>
5	an acid such as acetic acid. The suitable base can be, for example but not limitation, sodium hydride, potassium /-butoxide, dimsyl sodium (CH3S(0)CH2_ Na+), alkali metal (such as hthium, sodium or potassium) carbonates or hydroxides, tetraalkyl (such as methyl, ethyl or butyl)ammonium fluorides or hydroxides, or 2-rebutylimmo-2-diemylarnino-l,3-dimethyl-perhydro-l,3,2-diazaphosphonine. The suitable organic solvent can be, for example but not<br>
10 	limitation, acetone, acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, dichloromethane, dimethylsulfoxide, or NN-dimethylformamide. The cyclization reaction is usually conducted in a temperature, range from about 0 to 120 °C. The effects of solvent, base, temperature and addition time are all interdependent, and choice of reaction conditions is important to minimize the formation of byproducts. A preferred base is tetrabutylammonium fluoride.<br>
15			Dehydration of the compound of Formula 31 to give the compound of Formula 32, followed by converting the carboxylic ester function to carboxylic acid, affords the compound of Formula 4d. The dehydration is effected by treatment with a catalytic amount of a suitable acid. This catalytic acid can be, for example but not limitation, sulfuric acid. The reaction is generally conducted using an organic solvent. As one skilled in the art will <br>
20	realize, dehydration reactions may be conducted in a wide variety of solvents in a temperature range generally between about 0 and 200 °C, more preferably between about 0 and 100 °C. For the dehydration in the method of Scheme 17, a solvent comprising acetic acid and temperatures of about 65 °C are preferred. Carboxylic ester compounds can be converted to carboxylic acid compounds by numerous methods including nucleophilic<br>

cleavage under anhydrous conditions or hydrolytic methods involving the use of either acids or bases (see T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2nd ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York, 1991, pp. 224-269 for a review of methods). For the method of Scheme 17, base-catalyzed hydrolytic methods are preferred. Suitable bases include alkali metal (such as lithium, sodium or potassium) hydroxides. For example, the ester can be dissolved in a mixture of water and an alcohol such as ethanol.

Halogenating reagents that can be used include phosphorus oxyhalides, phosphorus trihalides, phosphorus pentahalides, thionyl chloride, dihalotrialkylphosphoranes, dihalodiphenylphosphoranes, oxalyl chloride and phosgene. Preferred are phosphorus oxyhalides and phosphorus pentahalides. To obtain complete conversion, at least 0.33 equivalents of phosphorus <br>
10	oxyhalide versus the compound of Formula 38 (i.e. the mole reatio of phosphorus oxyhalide to Formula 18 is at least 0.33) should be used, preferably between about 0.33 and 1.2 equivalents. To obtain complete conversion, at least 0.20 equivalents of phosphorus pentahalide versus the compound of Formula 38 should be used, preferably between about 0.20 and 1.0 equivalents. Compounds of Formula 38 wherein R13 is C1-C4 alkyl are<br>
15 	preferred for this reaction. Typical solvents for this halogenation include halogenated alkanes, such as dichloromethane, chloroform, chlorobutane and the like, aromatic solvents, such as benzene, xylene, chlorobenzene and the like, ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran, p-dioxane, diethyl ether, and the like, and polar aprotic solvents such as acetonitrile, NN-dimethylformamide, and the like.

20	pyridine, NN-dimethylaniline or the like, can be added. Addition of a catalyst, such as NN-dimethylformamide, is also an option. Preferred is the process in which the solvent is acetonitrile and a base is absent. Typically, neither a base nor a catalyst is required when acetonitrile solvent is used. The preferred process is conducted by mixing the compound of Formula 38 in acetonitrile. The halogenating reagent is then added over a convenient time, <br>
25	and the mixture is then held at the desired temperature until the reaction is complete. The reaction temperature is typically between 20 °C and the boiling point of acetonitrile, and the reaction time is typically less than 2 hours.

Alternatively, compounds of Formula 37 wherein R6 is halogen can be prepared by treating the corresponding compounds of Formula 37 wherein. R6 is a different halogen (e.g.,<br>
5 	CI for making Formula 37 wherein R3 is Br) or a sulfonate group such as p-toluenesulfonate, benzenesulfonate and methanesulfonate with the appropriate hydrogen halide. By this method the R6 halogen or sulfonate substituent on the Formula 37 starting compound is replaced with, for example, Br or CI from hydrogen bromide or hydrogen chloride, respectively.   The reaction is conducted in a suitable solvent such as dibromomethane,<br>
10 	dichotomy ethane or acetonitrile. The reaction can be. conducted at or near atmospheric pressure or above atmospheric pressure in a pressure vessel. When R6 in the starting compound of Formula 37 is a halogen such as CI, the reaction is preferably conducted in such a way that the hydrogen halide generated from the reaction is removed by sparging or other suitable means.   The reaction can be conducted between about 0 and 100 °C, most<br>
15 	conveniently near ambient temperature (e.g., about 10 to 40 °C), and more preferably between about 20 and 30 °C. Addition of a Lewis acid catalyst (such as aluminum tribromide for preparing Formula 37 wherein R6 is Br) can facilitate the reaction. The product of Formula 37 is isolated by the usual methods known to those skilled in the art, including extraction, distillation and crystallization.   Further details for this process are<br>
20     illustrated in Example 14.<br>
Starting compounds of Formula 37 wherein R6 is CI or Br can be prepared from corresponding compounds of Formula 38 as already described. Starting compounds of Formula 37 wherein R6 is a sulfonate group can likewise be prepared from corresponding compounds of Formula 38 by standard methods such as treatment with a sulfonyl chloride<br>

wherein R13 is C1-C4 alkyl, and X is a leaving group.<br>
In this method, instead of being halogenated as shown in Scheme 20, the compound of Formula 38 is oxidized to the compound of Formula 32a.  The reaction conditions for this oxidation are as already described for the conversion of the compound of Formula 37 to the <br>
5     	compound of Formula 32 in Scheme 19.<br>
The compound of Formula 32a is then alkylated to form die compound of Formula 32b by contact with an alkylating agent CF3CH2X (39) in the presence of a base. In the alkylating agent 39, X is a nucleophilic reaction leaving group such as halogen (e.g., Br, I), OS(0)2CH3 (methanesulfonate), OS(0)2CF3, OS(0)2Ph-;-CH3 (p-toluenesulfonate), and<br>
10 	the like; metiianesulfonate works well. The reaction is conducted in the presence of at least one equivalent of a base. Suitable bases include inorganic bases, such as alkali metal (such as Uthium, sodium or potassium) carbonates and hydroxides, and organic bases, such as triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine and l,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene. The reaction is generally conducted in a solvent, which can comprise alcohols, such as methanol and<br>
15 	ethanol, halogenated alkanes, such as dichloromethane, aromatic solvents, such as benzene, toluene and chlorobenzene, ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran, and polar aprotic solvents, such as acetonitrile, such as such as acetonitrile, NN Mimethylformamide, and the like. Alcohols and polar aprotic solvents are preferred for use with inorganic bases. Potassium carbonate as base and acetonitrile as solvent are preferred. The reaction is generally conducted between<br>
20 	about 0 and 150 °C, with most typically between ambient temperature and 100 °C. The<br>
product of Formula 32b can be isolated by conventional techniques such as extraction. The<br>

methoxide, potassium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, potassium ethoxide, potassium tert-butoxide, lithium tert-butoxide, and the like. Greater than 0.5 equivalents of base versus the compound of Formula 33 should be used, preferably between 0.9 and 1.3 equivalents. Greater than 1.0 equivalents of the compound of Formula 40 should be used, preferably<br>
5 	between 1.0 to 1.3 equivalents. Polar protic and polar aprotic organic solvents can be used, such as alcohols, acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, NN-dimemylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide and the like. Preferred solvents are alcohols such as methanol and ethanol. It is especially preferred that the alcohol be the same as that making up the fumarate or maleate ester and the alkoxide base. The reaction is typically conducted by mixing the compound of Formula<br>
10 	33 and the base in the solvent. The mixture can be heated or cooled to a desired temperature and the compound of Formula 40 added over a period of time. Typically reaction temperatures are between 0 °C and the boiling point of the solvent used. The reaction may be conducted under greater than atmospheric pressure in order to increase the boiling point of the solvent.   Temperatures between about 30 and 90 °C are generally preferred.   The<br>
15	 addition time can be as quick as heat transfer allows. Typical addition times are between 1 minute and 2 hours. Optimum reaction temperature and addition time vary depending upon the identities of the compounds of Formula 33 and Formula 40. After addition, the reaction mixture can be held for a time at the reaction temperature. Depending upon the reaction temperature, the required hold time may be from 0 to 2 hours. Typical hold times<br>
20 	are 10 to 60 minutes. The reaction mass then can be acidified by adding an organic acid, such as acetic acid and the like, or an inorganic acid, such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid and the like. Depending on the reaction conditions and the means of isolation, the -CO2R13 function on the compound of Formula 38 may be hydrolyzed to -CO2H; for example, the presence of water in the reaction mixture can promote such hydrolysis.   If the carboxylic<br>
25 	acid (-CO2H) is formed, it can be converted back to -CO2R13 wherein R13 is C1-C4 alkyl using esterification methods well-known in the art. The desired product, a compound of Formula 38, can be isolated by methods known to those skilled in the art, such as crystallization, extraction or distillation.<br>

Formulation/Utility<br>
Compounds of Formula I have been discovered to not only have excellent activity controlling phytophagous invertebrate pests, but also have favorable residual patterns and plant translocation to provide protection of a plant developing from a plant propagule such as<br>
5 	a seed, bulb, rhizome, tuber, corm, or stem or leaf cutting. (In the context of this disclosure "invertebrate pest control" means inhibition of invertebrate pest development (including mortality) that causes significant reduction in feeding or other injury or damage caused by the pest; related expressions are defined analogously.) This invention thus provides a method for protecting a plant propagule from phytophagous invertebrate pests by contacting the propagule or the locus of <br>
10	the propagule with a biologically effective amount of a compound of Formula I. The method of this invention using a sufficient amount of the Formula I compound has also been discovered to protect not only the propagule itself but also new growth developing from the propagule.<br>
As described herein, "treating" a propagule or locus of a propagule means applying a compound of Formula I or composition containing the compound to the propagule or locus of the propagule so that the <br>
15	compound of Formula I is brought in contact with the propagule; related terms such as "treatment" are defined analogously. When a propagule is thus brought into contact with a biologically effective amount of a Formula I compound, the compound protects it against injury by phytophagous invertebrate pests. Not only does the <br>
20	Formula I compound protect the external surface of the propagule, but it will be absorbed by the propagule to produce a propagule comprising the Formula I compound. If the propagule is contacted with sufficient amount of Formula I compound, enough will be absorbed to produce a biologically effective concentration of Formula I compound inside the propagule, and hence a propagule comprising a biologically effective amount of the Fomula I <br>
25	compound. If a sufficient amount of the Formula I compound is applied to raise the concentration of Formula I compound in the propagule to a concentration greater than the minimum for biological effectiveness then translocation can move a biologically effective<br><br>

concentration of the Formula I compound to the developing shoot and root to protect them as well.<br>

15     onion, tulip, daffodil, crocus and hyacinth are preferred embodiments of the invention.<br>
The locus of the propagules can be treated with a Formula I compound by many different methods. All that is needed is for a biologically effective amount of a Formula I compound to be applied on or sufficiently close to the propagule so that it can be absorbed by the propagule. The Formula I compound can be applied by such methods as drenching<br>
20	 the growing medium including a propagule with a solution or dispersion of a Formula I compound, mixing a Formula I compound with growing medium and planting a propagule in the treated growing medium (e.g., nursery box treatments), or various forms of propagule treatments whereby a Formula I compound is applied to a propagule before it is planted in a growing medium.<br>
25	In these methods the Formula I compound will generally be used as a formulation or<br>
composition with an agriculturally suitable carrier comprising at least one of a liquid diluent, a solid diluent or a surfactant. A wide variety of formulations are suitable for this invention, the most suitable types of formulations depend upon the method of application. As is well known to those skilled in the art, the purpose of formulation is to provide a safe and<br>
30 	convenient means of transporting, measuring and dispensing the crop protection chemical and also to optimize its bioefficacy.<br>
Depending on the method of application useful formulations include liquids such as solutions (including emulsifiable concentrates), suspensions, emulsions (including microemulsions and/or suspoemulsions) and the like which optionally can be thickened into<br>
35 	gels. Useful formulations further include solids such as dusts, powders, granules, pellets, tablets, films, and the like which can be water-dispersible ("wettable") or water-soluble. Active ingredient can be (micro)encapsulated and further formed into a suspension or solid formulation; alternatively the entire formulation of active ingredient can be encapsulated (or<br><br>
WO 03/024222<br><br>
PCT/US02/30302<br><br>
87<br>
"overcoated").    Encapsulation can control or delay release of the active ingredient.<br>

For growing-medium drenches, the formulation needs to provide the Formula I<br>
20 	compound, generally after dilution with water, in solution or as particles small enough to remain dispersed in the liquid. Water-dispersible or soluble powders, granules, tablets, emulsifiable concentrates, aqueous suspension concentrates and the like are formulations suitable for aqueous drenches of growing media. Drenches are most satisfactory for treating growing media that have relatively high porosity, such as light soils or artificial growing<br>
25	 medium comprising porous materials such as peat moss, pirate, vermiculite and the like. The drench liquid comprising the Formula I compound can also be added to a liquid growing medium (i.e. hydroponics), which causes the Formula I compound to become part of the liquid growing medium. One skilled the art will appreciate that the amount of Formula I compound needed in the drench liquid for invertebrate pest control efficacy (i.e. biologically<br>
30 	effective amount) will vary with the type of propagule, the Formula I compound, the duration and extent of plant protection desired, the invertebrate pests to be controlled and environmental factors. The concentration of Formula I compound in the drench liquid is generally between about 0.01 ppm and 10,000 ppm, more typically between about 1 ppm and 100 ppm.    One skilled in the art can easily determine the biologically effective<br>
35     concentration necessary for the desired level of phytophagous invertebrate pest control.<br>
For treating a growing medium a Formula I compound can also be applied by mixing it as a dry powder or granule formulation with the growing medium.  Because this method of<br><br>
WO 03/024222<br><br>
PCT/US02/30302<br><br>
92<br>
application does not require first dispersing or dissolving in water, the dry powder or granule formulations need not be highly dispersible or soluble. While in a nursery box the entire body of growing medium may be treated, in an agricultural field only the soil in the vicinity of the propagule is typically treated for environmental and cost reasons. To minimize <br>
5 	application effort and expense, a formulation of Formula I compound is most efficiently applied concurrently with propagule planting (e.g., seeding). For in-furrow application, the Formula I formulation (most conveniently a granule formulation) is applied directly behind the planter shoe. For T-band application, the Formula I formulation is applied in a band over the row behind the planter shoe and behind or usually in front of the press wheel.   One<br>
10 	skilled the art will appreciate that the amount of Formula I compound needed in the growing medium locus for invertebrate pest control efficacy (i.e. biologically effective amount) will vary with the type of propagule, the Formula I compound, the duration and extent of plant protection desired, the invertebrate pests to be controlled and environmental factors. The concentration of Formula I compound in the growing medium locus of the propagule is<br>
15 	generally between about 0.0001 ppm and 100 ppm, more typically between about 0.01 ppm and 10 ppm. One skilled in the art can easily determine the biologically effective amount necessary for the desired level of phytophagous invertebrate pest control.<br>
A propagule can be directly treated by soaking it in a solution or dispersion of a Formula I compound. Although this application method is useful for propagules of all types,<br>
20 	treatment of large seeds (e.g., having a mean diameter of at least 3 mm) is more effective than treatment of small seeds for providing invertebrate pest control protection to. the developing plant. Treatment of propagules such as tubers, bulbs, conns, rhizomes and stem and leaf cuttings also can provide effective treatment of the developing plant in addition to the propagule.   The formulations useful for growing-medium drenches are generally also<br>
25 	useful for soaking treatments. The soaking medium comprises a nonphytotoxic liquid, generally water-based although it may contain nonphytotoxic amounts of other solvents such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, propylene carbonate, benzyl alcohol, dibasic esters, acetone, methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, cyclohexanone, dimethylsulfoxide and N-methylpyrrolidone, which may be useful for enhancing solubility<br>
30 	of the Formula I compound and penetration into the propagule. A surfactant can facilitate wetting of the propagule and penetration of the Formula I compound. One skilled the art will appreciate that the amount of Formula I compound needed in the soaking medium for invertebrate pest control efficacy (i.e. biologically effective amount) will vary with the type of propagule, the Formula I compound, the duration and extent of plant protection desired,<br>
35 	the invertebrate pests to be controlled and environmental factors. The concentration of Formula I compound in the soaking liquid is generally between about 0.01 ppm and 10,000 ppm, more typically between about 1 ppm and 100 ppm. One skilled in the art can easily determine the biologically effective concentration necessary for the desired level of<br><br>
WO 03/024222<br><br>
PCT/US02/30302<br><br>
93<br>
phytophagous invertebrate pest control. The soaking time can vary from 1 minute to 1 day or even longer. Indeed the propagule can remain in the treatment liquid while it is germinating or sprouting (e.g., sprouting of rice seeds prior to direct seeding). As shoot and root emerge through the testa (seed coat), the shoot and root directly contact the solution<br>
5 	comprising the Formula I compound. For treatment of sprouting seeds of large-seeded crops such as rice, treatment times of about 8 to 48 hours, e.g., about 24 hours, is typical. Shorter times are most useful for treating small seeds.<br>
A propagule can also be coated with a composition comprising a biologically effective amount of a Formula I compound. The coatings of the invention are capable of effecting a<br>
10 	slow release of a Formula I compound by diffusion into the propagule and surrounding medium. Coatings include dry dusts or powders adhering to the propagule by action of a sticking agent such as methylcellulose or gum arabic. Coatings can also be prepared from suspension concentrates, water-dispersible powders or emulsions that are suspended in water, sprayed on the propagule in a tumbling device and then dried. Formula I compounds<br>
15 	that are dissolved in the solvent can be sprayed on the tumbling propagule and the solvent then evaporated. Such compositions preferably include ingredients promoting adhesion of the coating to the propagule. The compositions may also contain surfactants promoting wetting of the propagule. Solvents used must not be phytotoxic to the propagule; generally water is used, but other volatile solvents with low phytotoxicity such as methanol, ethanol,<br>
20 	methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, acetone, etc. may be employed alone or in combination. Volatile solvents are those with a normal boiling point less than about 100 °C. Drying must be conducted in a way not to injure the propagule or induce premature germination or sprouting.<br>
The thickness of coatings can vary from adhering dusts to thin films to pellet layers<br>
25 	about 0.5 to 5 mm thick. Propagule coatings of this invention can comprise more than one adhering layers, only one of which need comprise a Formula I compound. Generally pellets are most satisfactory for small seeds, because their ability to provide a biologically effective amount of a Formula I compound is not limited by the surface area of the seed, and pelleting small seeds also facilitates seed transfer and planting operations. Because of their larger size<br>
30 	and surface area, large seeds and bulbs, tubers, corms and rhizomes and their viable cuttings are generally not pelleted, but instead coated with powders or thin films.<br>

Generally a propagule coating of the invention comprises a compound of Formula I, a<br>
30 	film former or sticking agent. The coating may further comprise formulation aids such as a dispersant, a surfactant, a carrier and optionally an antifoam and dye. One skilled the art will appreciate that the amount of Formula I compound needed in the coating for invertebrate pest control efficacy (i.e. biologically effective amount) will vary with the type of propagule, the Formula I compound, the duration and extent of plant protection desired, the invertebrate<br>
35 	pests to be controlled and environmental factors. The coating needs to not inhibit germination or sprouting of the propagule and should be consistently efficacious in reducing plant injury during the plant-injury-causing phase of the target invertebrate pest's life cycle. A coating comprising sufficient Formula I compound can provide invertebrate pest control<br><br>

protection for ug to about_ 120 days or even longer. Generally the amount of Formula I compound ranges from about 0.001 to 50% of the weight of the propagule, for seeds more often in the range of about 0.01 to 50% of the seed weight, and most typically for large seeds in the range of about 0.1 to 10 % of the seed weight. However, larger amounts up to about<br>
5	 100% or more are useful, particularly for pelleting small seed for extended invertebrate pest control protection. For propagules such as bulbs, tubers, conns and rhizomes and their viable cuttings, and stem and leaf cuttings, generally the amount of Formula I compound ranges from about 0.001 to 5% of the propagule weight, with the higher percentages used for smaller propagules.   One skilled in the art can easily determine the biologically effective<br>
10     amount necessary for the desired level of phytophagous invertebrate pest control.<br>
The film former or adhesive agent component of the propagule coating is composed preferably of an adhesive polymer that may be natural or synthetic and is without phytotoxic effect on the propagule to be coated. The film former or sticking agent may be selected from polyvinyl   acetates,   polyvinyl   acetate   copolymers,   hydrolyzed   polyvinyl   acetates,<br>
15 	polyvinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer, polyvinyl alcohols, polyvinyl alcohol copolymers, polyvinyl methyl ether, polyvinyl methyl ether-maleic anhydride copolymer, waxes, latex polymers, celluloses including ethylcelluloses and methylcelluloses, hydroxy-methylcelluloses, hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxymethylpropylcelluloses, polyvinylpyrrolidones, alginates, dextrins, malto-dextrins, polysaccharides, fats, oils, proteins, karaya<br>
20 	gum, jaguar gum, tragacanth gum, polysaccharide gums, mucilage, gum arabics, shellacs, vinylidene chloride polymers and copolymers, soybean-based protein polymers and copolymers, lignosulfonates, acrylic copolymers, starches, polyvinylacrylates, zeins, gelatin, carboxymethylcellulose, chitosan, polyethylene oxide, acrylimide polymers and copolymers, polyhydroxyethyl acrylate, methylacrylimide monomers, alginate, ethylcellulose, <br>
25 	polychloroprene and syrups or mixtures thereof. Preferred film formers and adhesive agents include polymers and copolymers of vinyl acetate, polyvinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer and water-soluble waxes. Particularly preferred are polyvinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymers and water-soluble waxes. The above-identified polymers include those known in the art and for example some are identified as Agrimer® VA 6 and Licowax®<br>
30 	KST. The amount of film former or sticking agent in the formulation is generally in the range of about 0.001 to 100% of the weight of the propagule. For large seeds the amount of film former or sticking agent is typically in the range of about 0.05 to 5% of the seed weight; for small seeds the amount is typically in the range of about 1 to 100%, but can be greater than 100% of seed weight in pelleting. For other propagules the amount of film former or<br>
35     sticking agent is typically in the range of 0.001 to 2% of the propagule weight.<br>
Materials known as formulation aids may also be used in propagule treatment coatings of the invention for the invertebrate pest control and are well known to those skilled in the art. Formulation aids assist in the production or process of propagule treatment and include<br><br>

but are not limited to dispersants, surfactants, carriers, antifoams and dyes. Useful dispersants can include highly water-soluble anionic surfactants like Borresperse™ CA, Morwet® D425 and the like. Useful surfactants can include highly water-soluble nonionic surfactants like Pluronic® F108, Brij® 78 and the like. Useful carriers can include liquids<br>
5	 like water and oils which are water soluble such as alcohols. Useful carriers can also include fillers like woodflours, clays, activated carbon, diatomaceous earth, fine-grain inorganic solids, calcium carbonate and the like. Clays and inorganic solids which may be used include calcium bentonite, kaolin, china clay, talc, perlite, mica, venniculite, silicas, quartz powder, montmorillonite and mixtures thereof.   Antifoams can include water dispersible<br>
10 	liquids comprising polyorganic siloxanes like Rhodorsil® 416. Dyes can include water dispersible liquid colorant compositions like Pro-lzed® Colorant Red. One skilled in the art will appreciate that this is a non-exhaustive list of formulation aids and that other recognized materials may be used depending on the propagule to be coated and the compound of Formula I used in the coating.  Suitable examples of formulation aids include those listed<br>
15 	herein and those listed in McCutcheon' s 2001, Volume 2: Functional Materials, published by MC Publishing Company. The amount of formulation aids used may vary, but generally the weight of the components will be in the range of about 0.001 to 10000% of the propagule weight, with the percentages above 100% being mainly used for pelleting small seed. For nonpelleted seed generally the amount of formulating aids is about 0.01 to 45% of the seed<br>
20 	weight and typically about 0.1 to 15% of the seed weight. For propagules other than seeds, the amount of formulation aids generally is about 0.001 to 10% of the propagule weight.<br>
Conventional means of applying seed coatings may be used to carry out the coating of the invention. Dusts or powders may be applied by tumbling the propagule with a formulation comprising a Formula I compound and a sticking agent to cause the dust or<br>
25 	powder to adhere to the propagule and not fall off during packaging or transportation. Dusts or powders can also be applied by adding the dust or powder directly to the tumbling bed of propagules, followed by spraying a carrier liquid onto the seed and drying. Dusts and powders comprising a Formula I compound can also be applied by treating (e.g., dipping) a least a portion of the propagule with a solvent such as water, optionally comprising a<br>
30 	sticking agent, and dipping the treated portion into a supply of the dry dust or powder. This method can be particularly useful for coating stem cuttings. Propagules can also be dipped into compositions comprising Formula I formulations of wetted powders, solutions, suspoemulsions, emulfiable concentrates and emulsions in water, and then dried or directly planted in the growing medium.   Propagules such as bulbs, tubers, conns and rhizomes<br>
35 	typically need only a single coating layer to provide a biologically effective amount of a Formula I compound.<br>
Propagules may also be coated by spraying a suspension concentrate directly into a tumbling bed of propagules and then drying the propagules. Alternatively, other formulation<br><br>
WO 03/024222<br><br>
PCT/US02/30302<br><br>
98<br>
types like wetted powders, solutions, suspoemulsions, emulsifiable concentrates and emulsions in water may be sprayed on the propagules. This process is particularly useful for applying film coatings to seeds. Various coating machines and processes are available to one skilled in the art. Suitable processes include those listed in P. Kosters et al., Seed<br>
5	 Treatment: Progress and Prospects, 1994 BCPC Monograph No. 57 and the references listed therein. Three well-known techniques include the use of drum coaters, fluidized bed techniques and spouted beds. Propagules such as seeds may be presized prior to coating. After coating the propagules are dried and then optionally sized by transfer to a sizing machine.  These machines are known in the art for example, a typical machine used when<br>
10     sizing corn (maize) seed in the industry.<br>
For coating seed, the seed and coating material are mixed in any variety of conventional seed coating apparatus. The rate of rolling and application of coating depends upon the seed. For large oblong seeds such as that of cotton, a satisfactory seed coating apparatus comprises a rotating type pan with lifting vanes turned sufficient rpm to maintain a<br>
15 	rolling action of the seed, facilitating uniform coverage. For seed coating formulations applied as liquids, the seed coating must be applied over sufficient time to allow drying to minimize clumping of the seed. Using forced air or heated forced air can allow increasing the rate of application. One skilled in the art will also recognize that this process may be a batch or continuous process. As the name implies, a continuous process allows the seeds to<br>
20 	flow continuously throughout the product run. New seeds enter the pan in a steady stream to replace coated seeds exiting the pan.<br>
The seed coating process of the present invention is not limited to thin film coating and may also include seed pelleting. The pelleting process typically increases the seed weight from 2 to 100 times and can be used to also improve the shape of the seed for use in<br>
25 	mechanical seeders. Pelleting compositions generally contain a solid diluent, which is typically an insoluble particulate material, such as clay, ground limestone, powdered silica, etc. to provide bulk in addition to a binder such as an artificial polymer (e.g., polyvinyl alcohol, hydrolyzed polyvinyl acetates, polyvinyl methyl ether, polyvinyl methyl ether-maleic anhydride copolymer, and polyvinylpyrrolidinone) or natural polymer (e.g., alginates,<br>
30 	karaya gum, jaguar gum, tragacanth gum, polysaccharide gum, mucilage). After sufficient layers have been built up, the coat is dried and the pellets graded. A method for producing pellets is described in Agrow, The Seed Treatment Market, Chapter 3, PJB Publications Ltd., 1994.<br>

The mixture was then further homogenized using a Polytron high-speed rotor stator disperser (marketed by Brinkman Instruments inc., Cantiague Rd., Westbury, NY 11590 U.S.A.) with a 10 mm generator probe, which disintegrated aggregates of Compound 208.<br>
The resulting slurry was then transferred to a running mill charged to 80% capacity <br>
5    	 with 0.5-mm, mono-sized, high-density ceramic milling media and cooled by passing a chilled aqueous 33% ethylene glycol solution through the cooling jacket of the milling chamber. The slurry was recirculated through the milling chamber for 13 minutes with the agitator spinning at 4300 rpm.  The circulation pipe end was then moved from the mill feed funnel to a collection bottle to obtain the finished pink, highly pourable flowable suspension<br>
10     (89.5 g).<br>
The diameters of the micronized (milled) particles in the suspension were analyzed using a laser diffraction instrument. Using the average of two measurements, the arithmetic mean particle diameter was 2.03 (im, 90% of the particles were less than 5.21 (im diameter, 10% of the particles were less than 0.30 \im diameter, and the median particle diameter was<br>
15      1.0 (am.<br>
Step 2: Coating cottonseed with composition comprising Compound 208<br>
Cottonseed (Stoneville 4793 RR, 122.5 g) were added to a stainless-steel pot (12 cm i.d., 11 cm depth) containing two counter-opposing lifting vanes to lift the seed as the pot turns. The pot was oriented at a 40 to 45° angle from horizontal and mechanically rotated at<br>
20     640 rpm, which caused good mixing and tumbling action inside the pot.<br>
The flowable prepared in Step 1 was sprayed directly on the tumbling bed of seed with a supply air pressure of 10-11 psi (69-76 kPa) to produce fine droplets. By measuring the weight of the reservoir, the amount of flowable suspension sprayed on the seeds could be determined. With the seeds tumbling, the hand-held atomizer was pointed inside the pot to<br>
25     direct spray at the center of the tumbling bed of seed. Spraying was continued until the seed surfaces became tacky, causing the seeds to clump together. The atomizer was then shut off, and the seed coating was quickly dried by blowing on the seed low-pressure air at room temperature from a nozzle mounted to direct airflow inside the pot. The increasing sound of tumbling seeds provided an audible signal that the seed coating was sufficiently dry. The<br>
30     drying airflow was then shut off, and spraying using the hand-held atomizer was resumed. The cycle of spraying and drying was repeated until the desired amount of flowable suspension had been applied to the seeds. The drying of the seed coating was then completed by exposure to a low flow of ambient air for 60 hours.<br>
The weights of Compound 208 applied to each often seeds from each batch was<br>
35     determined by macerating each seed in a bead mill and then adding acetonitrile extraction solvent. The extracts were centrifuged and aliquots of the supemate (supernatant liquid) were diluted 10,000:1 and then analyzed by LC/MS. The analysis results are listed in Table<br><br>

Corn (maize) seed (Pioneer 34M94 Hybrid Field Corn, 575 g) were added to a stainless-steel pot (17cm i.d., 16cm depth) containing two counter-opposing lifting vanes to lift the seed as the pot turns. The pot was oriented at a 40 to 45° angle from horizontal and mechanically rotated at 200 rpm, giving good mixing and tumbling action inside the pot.<br>
10			The 15% w/w flowable prepared in Step 1, was sprayed directly on separate batches of tumbling corn seed following the general procedure described in Example E, Step 2. The drying of the seed coating was then completed by allowing seeds to dry overnight in a chemical fume hood. Nominal 0.15, 0.29, 0.58, 1.09, 1.75 % by weight coatings of micronized Compound 502 on cornseed were achieved as shown in Table 15. The average <br>
15	Wt.% of Compound 502 on coated seed was measured by LC/MS following the method in Step 2 of Example E. <br>

BIOLOGICAL EXAMPLES OF THE INVENTION<br>
TESTA <br>
Cotton seeds coated with a composition of Compound 208 from the Nominal 1%, Nominal 2% and Nominal 3% concentration batches prepared as described in Example E<br>
5	and untreated seeds for comparison were planted in pots using sterile Sassafras soil and grown in a growth chamber with 16 hours of light at 28 °C and 8 hours of darkness at 24 °C and 50% relative humidity. After 31 days two plants, each having true leaves, were selected from each of the seed batches and their cotyledons were removed. Adult Bemisia argentifolii (silverleaf whitefly) were added for egg-laying on the plants, and plastic<br>
10	cylinders capped with tissue paper were fitted into the pots. Three days later, the adults were removed and the leaves were checked to verify egg deposits. Fifteen days later (about six days after egg hatching), the infested leaves were removed from the plants and the 49-day results determined by counting the dead and live nymphs on the undersides of the leaves. Adult Bemisia argentifolii were reintroduced for a second round of egg-laying on upper<br>
15	leaves of the plants, and plastic cylinders with tissue paper were fitted into the pots as before. Three days later, the adults were removed and the leaves were checked to verify egg deposits. Fourteen days later (about six days after egg hatching), the leaves were removed from the plants and the 66-day results determined by counting the dead and live nymphs on the undersides of the leaves. The results from both rating times are summarized in Table A.<br>
