				<td>MESOGENIC, CROSSLINKABLE MIXTURE, LIQUID CRYSTALLINE POLYMER<br>
FILM MADE OF SAID MIXTURE, AND PROCESS OF PREPARING SAID FILM<br>
The present invention relates to mesogenic, crosslinkable mixture, liquid crystalline<br>
polymer film made of said mixture, and process of preparing said film, and pertains to a<br>
new mixture of crosslinkable liquid crystals and polymerisable dichroic dyes and their<br>
use in the construction of unstructured and structured polarisers.<br>
Optical polarisers (hereinafter also called polarising films, polarisation films or<br>
polariser films) play a crucial role in the functioning principle of many optical or<br>
electro-optical devices, such as Liquid Crystal Devices, modem Security Elements,<br>
and the like. Furthermore, optical polarisers are also used in many instruments or<br>
devices, for example in different kinds of measuring instruments, dashboards or<br>
sunglasses, where stray light and undesired reflections have to be eliminated to<br>
improve visibility. Such polarising films usually comprise stretched polymer films<br>
such as, for example, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), a dichroic absorber and other optional<br>
layers. Dichroic absorbers usually are iodine or dichroic dyes which are absorbed on<br>
or dissolved in the polymer film.<br>
US 5,707,544 describes liquid crystals characterised by a molecular architecture,<br>
wherein a chromophore is laterally attached to a polymerisable mesogenic core. Such<br>
compounds and liquid crystalline mixtures containing these are described to be useful<br>
mainly for non-linear optic devices or colour filters.<br>
Yet, a disadvantage of the most widespread polariser films based on iodine absorbers<br>
is their limited stability against humidity, heat and light. Polariser films based on<br>
dichroic dyes have a tendency to lose efficiency during time due to diffusion<br>
processes or inhomogeneities caused by partial crystallisation. A further drawback is<br>
the migration of dichroic dyes to adjacent layers if such systems are designed for use<br>
in multilayer systems as e.g. described in EP-A-06390S4.. Thus, there is clearly a<br>
need for a concept whereby all or at least some of the above disadvantages may be<br>
avoided..<br><br>
Applicants have now found that certain mixtures comprising liquid crystals and<br>
dichroic dyes may be able to overcome the disadvantages described hereinabove.<br>
Thus, in a first aspect the present invention provides a mesogenic, crosslinkable mixture,<br>
wherein at least one compound comprises more than one polymerisable group in its structure,<br>
and which mixture comprises at least one polymerisable liquid crystal and at least one<br>
polymerisable dichroic dye selected from an azo dye, an anthraquinone, a benzoquinone, a<br>
perylene, an azulene or a merocyanine of the general formula I:<br><br>
wherein<br>
A represents a dichroic residue exhibiting at least partial absorption in<br>
the visible region &gt; 400 nm;<br>
n1, n2, n3, n4 signify 0 or 1, whereby the sum of n1, n2, n3 and n4 is &gt;0, and<br>
B1 to B4 represent a group of substructure II<br><br>
wherein the broken line symbolises the linkage to said dichroic residue and<br>
wherein :<br><br>
A1, A2, A3 each independently represent an aromatic or alicyclic group, which<br>
is unsubstituted or substituted by fluorine, chlorine, cyano, nitro,<br>
or a straight-chain or branched alkyl residue, which is<br>
unsubstituted, mono-substituted by cyano or halogeno, or<br>
poly-substituted by halogeno, having 1 to 18 carbon atoms, and<br>
wherein one or more of the non-adjacent CH2 groups may<br>
independently be replaced by Q, whereby Q represents -O-, -CO-,<br>
-CO-O-, -O-CO-, -Si(CH3)2-O-Si(CH3)2-, -NR2-, -NR2-CO-,<br>
-CO-NR2-, -NR2-CO-O-, -O-CO-NR2-, -NR2-CO-NR2-,<br>
-CH=CH-, -OC-, -O-CO-O-, and R2 represents hydrogen or<br>
straight-chain or branched C1-C6 alkyl, preferably straight-chain<br>
or branched C1-C3 alkyl;<br>
S1, S2 represent a single covalent bond or a spacer unit, such as a<br>
straight-chain or branched alkylene residue, which is<br>
unsubstituted, mono-substituted by cyano or halogeno, or<br>
poly-substituted by halogeno, having 1 to 24 carbon atoms,<br>
wherein one or more of the non-adjacent CH2 groups may<br>
independently be replaced by Q, wherein Q has the meaning given<br>
above;<br>
Z1, Z2 independently represent a single covalent bond or a spacer unit,<br>
such as a straight-chain or branched alkylene residue, which is<br>
unsubstituted, mono-substituted by cyano or halogeno, or<br>
poly-substituted by halogeno, having 1 to 8 carbon atoms, wherein<br>
one or more of the non-adjacent CH2 groups may independently be<br>
replaced by Q, -N=N- or -CR2=C-CO-, wherein Q and R2 have the<br>
meaning given above;<br>
P represents a polymerisable group;<br>
ml, m2, m3 independently are 0 or 1; and<br>
0 is 0 or 1, whereby the sum of the symbols 0 in Bl to B4 is &gt; 0.<br><br>
In a further aspect the invention also provides the use of said mesogenic crosslinkable<br>
mixtures for the production of dichroic crosslinked films as well as their use in the<br>
construction of unstructured and structured optical elements and multi-layer systems<br>
as for example, for colour filters, polarisers and for me construction of security<br>
devices.<br>

The dichroic azo dyes of formula III to V and the dichroic anthraquinone dyes based<br>
on formulae VI to X may readily be prepared using methods well known to the person<br>
skilled in the art, such as those documented in Houben-Weyl, Methoden der<br>

Crystals Vol. 150A, 1987.<br>
The polymerisable liquid crystalline mixtures according to the present invention may<br>
further be formed into liquid crystalline polymer films (LCP films). Thus, in a further<br>
aspect the invention provides dichroic films formed from mixtures according to the<br>
present invention. Such LCP films may readily be prepared by UV or thermal<br>
polymerisation of the mixtures of the present invention. A film comprising a mixture<br>
according to the present invention is formed on a substrate, for example, by first<br>
preparing a solution of a mixture, which is subsequently applied to a support by<br>
different coating techniques, such as spincoating, miniscuscoating, wirecoating,<br>
slotcoating, offsetprinting, flexoprinting, gravureprinting. After evaporation of the<br>
solvent the obtained film is polymerised using UV light to give a cross-linked<br>
dichroic liquid crystal film of preferably 0.5 to 5 µm thickness. If required such films<br>
may further be coated with other layers, such as, e.g. protective layers for protection<br>
against oxygen, UV-irradiation or mechanical stress. Such films may be used in the<br>
manufacture of devices such as polarisers or optical filters.<br>
Examples of substrates used in the preparation of dichroic LCP films may include<br>
transparent substrates, such as glass or plastic including an orientation layer, which is<br>
able to induce a uniform orientation to the mixture. Such orientation layers may<br>
include rubbed polyimide, or polyamide or preferably layers of photo-orientable<br>
materials. A well-suited kind of photo-orientable orientation layers are Linearly<br>
Photopolymerisable Polymers (LPP), also sometimes referred to as Photooriented<br>
Polymer Networks (PPN). Backgrounds and manufacturing of such orientation layers<br>
are disclosed in, for example, US 5,389,698, US 5,838,407, US 5,602,661,<br>
US 6,160,597, US 6,144,428, all of the applicant. Using LPP layers, segments (pixels)<br>
of locally varying orientation may be formed. Thus, not only uniformly aligned<br>
dichroic LCP layers but also structured complex orientation patterns within the<br><br>
dichroic LCP layers may be produced. Furthermore multilayer systems formed from<br>
stacks of alternating LPP and LCP layers, wherein at least one of the LCP layers is a<br>
dichroic LCP layer are feasible. Such layers or stacks of layers may additionally be<br>
covered by other well known functional layers, such as, e.g. protecting layers against<br>
oxygen or humidity or layers for protection against ultraviolet radiation.<br>
Recently it has been shown, e.g. in WO 99/64924, that photo-orienting materials like<br>
LPPs may also be able to orient liquid crystals, such as LCPs, if they are admixed to<br>
the mixture to be oriented prior to illumination with polarised light. In this way,<br>
orientation layers and LCP layers need not be formed separately. Thus, an analogous<br>
preparation of a dichroic LCP film using an inventive mixture, which in addition<br>
contains a photo-orientable material, may also be possible.<br>
The dichroic mixtures and films of the present invention may be used to prepare<br>
electro-optical and optical devices including security devices. A further aspect of the<br>
invention therefore provides an electro-optical or optical component or a security<br>
device comprising a dichroic liquid crystalline polymer film formed from a mixture of<br>
the invention. Examples of optical or electro-optical components may include<br>
structured or unstructured optical filters, polarisers or elements of security devices.<br>

EXAMPLES 7-11<br>
Preparation of dichroic mixtures:<br>
Five mixtures were prepared using the dichroic, polymerisable, blue antraquinone dye<br>
B1 and the red, polymerisable, azo dye Rl shown in Table 1 and the monomeric,<br>
crosslinkable liquid crystal components (LCPs) Monl to Mon5 shown in Table 2.<br><br><br>
Using these crosslinkable liquid crystal monomers and polymerisable dichroic dyes,<br>
supercoolable dichroic nematic mixtures MLCPI to MLCP5 were developed, allowing<br>
the preparation of LCP layers at room temperature. The composition ratios of the<br>
mixtures MLCPI to MLCPS were chosen as given in Table 3.<br><br><br>
In addition, a further 2 wt% of the photo-initiator IRGACURE369 (Ciba) was added<br>
to the above mixtures.<br>
The mixtures MLCPI to MLCP5 were used to produce oriented, dichroic liquid crystal<br>
samples on glass substrates as described below.<br>
Production of dichroic LCP layers:<br>
Five samples were prepared, whereby each single specimen comprised an alignment<br>
layer and a dichroic liquid crystal polymer layer. The alignment layers were<br>
manufactured using the linearly photo-polymerizable aligning (LPP) technique. The<br>
dichroic liquid crystal polymer layers were oriented by the adjacent LPP layers. The<br>
manufacturing processes of both layers are described in the following.<br>
For the production of an LPP orientation layer, suitable LPP materials are described<br>
for example in patent publications EP 0 611 786, WO 96/10049 and EP 0 763 552,<br>
and include cinnamic acid derivatives and ferulic acid derivatives. For the examples,<br>
the following LPP material was chosen:<br><br><br>
A 2 % solution of the LPP material in methylpropylketone (MPK) as a solvent was<br>
spin-coated at 2000 rpm for 60 seconds at room temperature (20°C). The layer was<br>
then dried for 5 to 10 minutes at 130 to 150°C on a hot stage. Subsequently, the layer<br>
was exposed to linearly polarised light from a mercury high-pressure lamp for 10 to<br>
550 seconds (depending on the strength of the lamp and on the characteristics of LPP<br>
and dichroic LCP layers) at room temperature. The layer was then used as an<br>
orientation layer for a liquid crystal material comprising dichroic dyes.<br>
For the production of the dichroic LCP layers, the mixtures MLCPI to MLCP5 were<br>
dissolved in anisole to give a 20 wt% solution. These LCP mixtures, which include<br>
dichroic dyes, were then spin-coated at 800 rpm for 60 seconds on top of the photo-<br>
exposed LPP layers. The spin-coated dichroic LCP layers were then dried at 60°C for<br>
approximately 1 minute on a hot stage. For photo-initiated cross-linking of the liquid<br>
crystals and dye components, the layers were exposed to isotropic light from a xenon<br>
lamp for about 5 minutes (depending on the strength of the lamp) in an inert<br>
atmosphere.<br>
The procedure described above gave photo-aligned dichroic LCP layers on glass<br>
substrates leading to 5 different samples E1 to E5 derived from the 5 dichroic LCP<br>
mixtures MLCP1 to MLCP5.<br>
Order parameters of samples E1 to E5:<br>
The order parameter S of a dichroic dye is given by the following expression:<br>
S = D11-D1 / D11+2D1<br>
wherein D11 and D1 are the optical densities of a dichroic dye in a liquid crystal<br>
measured for light polarisations parallel and perpendicular to the liquid crystal<br>
director.<br>
Table 4 shows the order parameters S of samples E1 to E5 as measured at the<br>
indicated wavelength.<br><br>
Table 4:<br><br>
All samples E1 to E5 were crosslinked successfully. The surfaces were completely dry<br>
and were more or less resistant against scratches.<br><br>
