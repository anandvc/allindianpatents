				<td>PREPARATION OF MOLECULAR SIEVE SSZ-13<br><br>
This application claims benefit under 35 USC 119 of Provisional Application 60/882,010, filed December 27, 2006.<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
The present invention relates to a process for producing the crystalline zeolite designated SSZ-13 from a reaction mixture.<br><br>
BACKGROUND<br><br>
Molecular sieves are a commercially important class of crystalline materials. They have distinct crystal structures with ordered pore structures which are demonstrated by distinct X-ray diffraction patterns. The crystal structure defines cavities and pores which are characteristic of the different species.<br><br>
Molecular sieves identified by the International Zeolite Associate (IZA) as having the structure code CHA are known. For example, the molecular sieve known as SSZ-13 is a known crystalline CHA material. It is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,544,538, issued October 1 , 1985 to Zones, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. In U.S. Patent No. 4,544,538, the SSZ-13 molecular sieve is prepared in the presence of N,N,N-trimethyl-1-adamantammonium cation which serves as a structure directing agent ("SDA"), also known as on organic template. However, this SDA is costly, which makes the synthesis of SSZ-13 using this SDA costly. This cost can limit the usefulness of SSZ-13 in commercial processes. Thus, it would be desirable to find a way to synthesize SSZ-13 without having to use the costly N,N,N-trimethyl-1-adamantammonium cation SDA.<br><br>
One way of reducing the amount of the N,N,N-trimethyl-1-adamantammonium cation SDA in the synthesis of SSZ-13 is disclosed in copending Provisional Application No. 60/826,882, filed September 25, 2006 by Zones. There, the amount of N,N,N-trimethyl-1-adamantammonium cation SDA needed to synthesize SSZ-13 is reduced significantly by the addition to the SSZ-13 reaction <br><br>
mixture of benzyl trimethylammonium cation (e.g., benzyl trimethylammonium hydroxide). While this synthesis method can provide significant cost savings, it still requires the use of the costly N,N,N-trimethyl-1-adamantammonium cation SDA.<br><br>
It has now been found that SSZ-13 can be prepared using benzyl trimethylammonium cation ("BzTMA cation") in the absence of a 1- adamantammonium cation, such as N,N,N-trimethyl-1-adamantammonium cation.<br><br>
U. S. Patent No. 5,558,851 , issued September 24, 1996 to Miller, discloses a method for preparing a crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite from a reaction mixture containing only sufficient water so that the reaction mixture may be shaped if desired. In the method, the reaction mixture is heated at crystallization conditions and in the absence of an external liquid phase, so that excess liquid need not be removed from the crystallized material prior to drying the crystals. U. S. Patent No. 5,558,851 is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
The present invention relates to a method of preparing small pore zeolite-13. As used herein, the term "small pore zeolite" refers to zeolites having a pore size of less than 5 Angstroms, including those in which the pores have 8 membered rings. The small pore zeolite SSZ-13 can have a mole ratio of (1 ) a tetravalent oxide or mixture of tetravalent oxides (e.g., silicon oxide, germanium oxide or mixtures thereof) to a (2) trivalent oxide or mixtures of trivalent oxides (e.g., aluminum oxide, boron oxide, gallium oxide, iron oxide or mixtures thereof) in the zeolite framework of greater than 12, including mole ratios of 200 or more.<br><br>
The reaction mixture from which and in which the small pore zeolite SSZ-13 is crystallized comprises at least one active source of a tetravalent oxide or mixture of tetravalent oxides (e.g., silicon oxide, germanium oxide or mixtures thereof) and at least one trivalent oxide or mixtures of trivalent oxides (e.g., aluminum oxide, boron oxide, gallium oxide, iron oxide or mixtures thereof), a structure directing agent ("SDA") capable of forming the SSZ-13 zeolite, and an amount of water not substantially in excess of the amount required to cause and maintain crystallization of zeolite SSZ-13. As used herein, the term "not substantially in <br><br>
excess of the amount required to cause and maintain crystallization" means the minimum amount of water required is that which causes and maintains crystallization of zeolite SSZ-13. This amount of water is considerably less than that required in conventional processes for preparing zeolites. While an amount slightly in excess of this minimum amount may be employed (especially if it is required to allow the reaction mixture to be thoroughly mixed and/or kneaded), the amount of water employed in the reaction mixture should not be so great that the reaction mixture turns into a solution or fluid gel.<br><br>
The amount of liquid required in the reaction mixture of the present invention, where the liquid may include aqueous and, organic liquids (e.g., the SDA), is that amount which is needed to adequately blend the mixture. Thus, a reaction mixture is prepared by mixing water with active sources of SSZ-13 zeolite to form a uniform mass that can be, for example, in the form of a heavy paste-like consistency or in the form of a powder or granules. The active sources will be in a form which can be easily blended into a uniform mass, and may be, for example, powders, hydrated particles, or concentrated aqueous solutions. Sufficient water is added to wet all the powders during mixing and/or kneading of the reaction mixture. Alternatively, sufficient water is added that the powders may be kneaded into a uniform and generally homogeneous, self-supporting mixture. It is not necessary that all of the active sources be readily soluble in water during kneading, since the water added to the active sources will be insufficient to make a fluid-like mixture. The amount of water added depends on the mixing apparatus and on the active sources employed. Those familiar with the art can readily determine without undue experimentation the amount of liquid required to properly mix active sources of the zeolite. For example, hydrated sources of the zeolite may require relatively less water, and dried sources may require relatively more. Though it is preferred that the mixture be blended and/or kneaded until the mixture has a uniform, homogeneous appearance, the length of time devoted to kneading the mixture is not critical in the present invention. <br><br>
The water content of the reaction mixture after blending and/or kneading may be further adjusted, for example, by drying or by the addition of water so that the reaction mixture has the desired consistency.<br><br>
In some embodiments, it is important, in preparing the reaction mixture used to make SSZ-13, that the amount of water present in the reaction mixture as prepared for the crystallization step be sufficient to cause and maintain crystallization of said SSZ-13, but not so much that the water forms a liquid phase external to the reaction mixture, or transforms the reaction mixture into a solution or fluid gel. Conveniently, the reaction mixture will be in the form of granules, a powder or a self-supporting mass. While it is not a requirement to form the reaction mixture into shaped particles before the reaction mixture is subjected to crystallization conditions, it may be desired in many cases to do so. In this case, the amount of water used in the reaction mixture of this invention is less than the amount of water required in conventional processes for preparing zeolites. Thus, during the crystallization step according to the present process, there is no separate liquid phase present which must be removed from the crystallized material at the end of the crystallization step by, for example filtering or decanting, prior to drying the crystals. Also, the amount of water present in the reaction mixture is insufficient to cause the reaction mixture to collapse or "melt", i.e., once the reaction mixture is formed (including any adjustment in the liquid content that may be needed), the resulting mass is self-supporting. It is important to note that as used herein the term "self-supporting" (or any equivalent thereof) refers to a reaction mixture that does not collapse or "melt" under its own weight. This term includes the case where the reaction mixture is comprised of individual granules in which each granule is self-supporting or a powder in which each particle in the powder is self-supporting.<br><br>
The solids content of the reaction mixture will depend on the particular composition of the SSZ-13 desired. SSZ-13 zeolites having a very high mole ratio of tetravalent oxide to trivalent oxide are within the scope of the process, including zeolites having a mole ratio of tetravalent oxide (e.g., silicon oxide, germanium <br><br>
oxide or mixtures thereof) to trivalent oxide (e.g., aluminum oxide, boron oxide, gallium oxide, iron oxide or mixtures thereof) of greater than 12, including zeolites having such a mole ratio of 200 and higher. Also included are SSZ-13 zeolites which are essentially free of the trivalent oxide(s) such as aluminum oxide, i.e., the oxides in the zeolite are essentially all tetravalent oxide (e.g., all silicon oxide). Especially when commercial silica sources are used, aluminum is almost always present to a greater or lesser degree. Thus, by "aluminum free" is meant that no aluminum is Intentionally added to the reaction mixture, e.g., as an alumina or aluminate reagent, and that to the extent aluminum is present, it occurs only as a contaminant in the reagents. Other metallic components which may be added to the reaction mixture include, for example, active sources of germanium oxide, aluminum oxide, boron oxide, gallium oxide, iron oxide and mixtures thereof.<br><br>
Typical sources of silicon oxide (SiOa) include silicates, silica hydrogel, silicic acid, colloidal silica, fumed silica, tetraalkyl orthosilicates silica hydroxides, precipitated silica and clays. Typical sources of aluminum oxide (AI2O3) when used in the reaction mixture include aluminates, alumina, and aluminum compounds such as AICI3, AI2(SO-I)3, aluminum hydroxide (AI(OH3)), kaolin clays, and other zeolites. Germanium, boron, gallium and iron can be added in forms corresponding to their aluminum and silicon counterparts. Salts, particularly alkali metal halides such as sodium chloride, can be added to or formed in the reaction mixture. They are disclosed in the literature as aiding the crystallization of zeolites while preventing silica occlusion in the lattice.<br><br>
The reaction mixture also comprises one or more active sources of alkali metal oxide. Sources of lithium, sodium and potassium, are conveniently employed with sodium being a typical alkali metal. Any alkali metal compound which is not detrimental to the crystallization process is suitable. Non-limiting examples include alkali metal oxides, hydroxides, nitrates, sulfates, halogenides, oxalates, citrates and acetates.<br><br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, depending on the consistency of the reaction mixture, it may be able to form the reaction mixture into a desired, <br><br>
self-supporting shape before the crystallization step (referred to herein as the "preforming step"), thereby reducing the number of process steps required to prepare catalytic materials containing the zeolite prepared in the mixture. Prior to forming the reaction mixture, it may be necessary to change the liquid content of the reaction mixture, either by drying or by adding more liquid, in order to provide a formable mass which retains its shape. In general, for most shaping methods, water will generally comprise from about 20 percent to about 60 percent by weight, and preferably from about 30 percent to about 50 percent by weight of the reaction mixture.<br><br>
In the preforming step, the reaction mixture can be formed into shaped particles. Methods for preparing the particles are well known in the art, and include, for example, extrusion, spray drying, granulation, agglomerization and the like. The particles are preferably of a size and shape desired for the ultimate catalyst, and may be in the form of, for example, extrudates, spheres, granules, agglomerates and prills. The particles will generally have a cross sectional diameter between about 1/64 inch and about 1/2 inch, and preferably between about 1/32 inch and about 1/4 inch, i.e. the particles will be of a size to be retained on a 1/64 inch, and preferably on a 1/32 inch screen and will pass through a 1/2 inch, and preferably through a 1/4 inch screen.<br><br>
In one embodiment, the shaped particles prepared from the reaction mixture will contain sufficient water to retain a desired shape. Additional water is not required in the mixture in order to initiate or maintain crystallization within the shaped particle. Indeed, it may be preferable to remove some of the excess water from the shaped particles prior to crystallization. Convention methods for drying wet solids can be used to dry the shaped particles, and may include, for example drying in air or an inert gas such as nitrogen or helium at temperatures below about 2000C and at pressures from subatmospheric to about 5 atmospheres pressure.<br><br>
Naturally occurring clays, e.g., bentonite, kaolin, montmorillonite, sepiolite and attapulgite, are not required, but may be included in the shaped particles prior to <br><br>
crystallization to provide particles having good crush strength. Such clays can be used in the raw state as originally mined or can be initially subjected to calcination, acid treatment or chemical modification. Microcrystalline cellulose has also been found to improve the physical properties of the particles.<br><br>
According to the present process, zeolite SSZ-13 is crystallized either within the reaction mixture or within the shaped particles made from the reaction mixture. In either case, the composition of the reaction mixture from which the SSZ-13 is formed has the following molar composition ranges:<br><br>
Composition Molar Ranqe Example Embodiment<br><br>
YO2/ W2O3 20 - 00 20 - 100<br><br>
M+AO2 0.1 - 0.4 0.2 - 0.4<br><br>
R/YO2 0.001 - 0.4 0.01 - 0.3<br><br>
OH-ZYO2 0.2 - 0.6 0.4 - 0.6<br><br>
H2OAO2 1 - 5 2 - 4<br><br>
where Y is silicon, germanium or both, W is aluminum, boron, gallium, iron, or a mixture thereof, M+ is an alkali metal ion, preferably sodium, and R is a benzyl trimethylammonium cation, the benzyl trimethylammonium cation being used in the absence of a 1-adamantammonium cation.<br><br>
As stated above, the liquid present in the reaction mixture {which may be in the form of shaped particles) may be a combination of aqueous and organic liquids, so long as the amount of water present is sufficient to cause and maintain crystallization of the SSZ-13 zeolite, while at the same time optionally keeping the reaction mixture self-supporting. Since the total liquid content may affect, for example, the physical strength of any shaped particles made from the reaction <br><br>
mixture, it is preferred that the total volatiles content of the reaction mixture during crystallization be in the range of between about 20% and about 60% (w/w), and preferably between about 30% and about 60% (w/w), where the total volatiles content is the measure of total volatile liquid, including water, in the reaction mixture. It is a feature of the present process that no additional liquid beyond that required to cause and maintain crystallization of the SSZ-13 is required for crystallization of the SS2-13 within the reaction mixture.<br><br>
In one embodiment, crystallization of the zeolite takes place in the absence of an external liquid phase, i.e., in the absence of a liquid phase separate from the reaction mixture. In general, it is not detrimental to the present process if some liquid water is present in contact with the reaction mixture or with the shaped particles during crystallization, and it can be expected that some water may appear on the surface of the reaction mixture during crystallization. However, it is an objective of the present invention to provide a method of crystallizing SSZ-13 in such a way as to minimize the amount of water which must be treated and/or discarded following crystallization. To that end, the present method provides a method of synthesizing SSZ-13 which requires no additional water for crystallization beyond a sufficient amount of water required to cause and maintain crystallization of the SSZ-13, while at the same time optionally keeping the reaction mixture self-supporting. Indeed, under certain conditions, liquid water present during crystallization may alter the form of the reaction mixture or shaped particles, and, in extreme circumstances, may cause the reaction mixture or shaped particles to lose their integrity or to dissolve.<br><br>
Crystallization is conducted at an elevated temperature and usually in an autoclave so that the reaction mixture is subject to autogenous pressure until the small pore zeolite crystals are formed. The temperatures during the hydrothermal crystallization step are typically maintained from about 1400C. to about 2000C.<br><br>
It is an important feature of the present process that the crystallization of the SSZ- 13 is frequently accelerated relative to conventional crystallization methods. Thus, <br><br>
the crystallization time required to form crystals will typically range from about 1 hour to about 10 days, and more frequently from about 3 hours to about 4 days.<br><br>
The SSZ-13 is crystallized within the reaction mixture, which comprises amorphous, non-crystalline reagents. Crystals of SSZ-13 (i.e., "seed" crystals) are added to the mixture prior to the crystallization step, and methods for enhancing the crystallization of zeolites by adding "seed" crystals are well known. The seed crystals are employed in amounts from about 1 to about 10 wt.% of the weight of silicon oxide (calculated from the amount of active silica source) in the reaction mixture.<br><br>
Once the SSZ-13 crystals have formed, the crystals may be water-washed and then dried, e.g., at 9O0C. to 1500C. for from 8 to 24 hours. The drying step can be performed at atmospheric or subatmospheric pressures.<br><br>
The present invention also includes SSZ-13 made by the process of this invention in its as-synthesized state. The term "as-synthesized" refers to the SSZ-13 in its form prior to removal of the BzTMA cation by thermal treatment (e.g., calcination) or other methods. Thus, the as-synthesized SSZ-13 has a composition comprising (1 ) a tetravalent oxide or mixture of tetravalent oxides (e.g., silicon oxide, germanium oxide or mixtures thereof), (2) optionally, a trivalent oxide or mixtures of trivalent oxides (e.g., aluminum oxide, boron oxide, gallium oxide, iron oxide or mixtures thereof) and (3) BzTMA cation, wherein the as-synthesized SSZ- 13 does not contain a 1-adamantammonium cation.<br><br>
The SSZ-13 zeolite may be used in catalysts (such as for converting methanol to light olefins such as ethylene and propylene), in separations (such as in mixed matrix membranes for separating CO2 from methane), and in environmental applications (such as adsorption of CO and light hydrocarbons). When shaped particles are formed from the reaction mixture described hereinbefore, they may be of a size and shape desired for the use to which the SSZ-13 will be put. Alternatively, the SSZ-13 pore zeolite can be composited with other materials <br><br>
resistant to the temperatures and other conditions using techniques such as spray drying, extrusion, and the like.<br><br>
The following examples demonstrate, but do not limit, the present invention.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 1<br><br>
Twenty grams of Hi-SiI 233 (source of silicon oxide) was placed in a suitable vessel. Reheis F-2000 alumina (1.7 grams) was dissolved in 5 grams of a 50% aqueous NaOH solution and then added to the Hi-SiI 233 in the vessel. The resulting mixture is mixed thoroughly. To the resulting mixture was added 1 gram of SSZ-13 seed crystals, and the mixture thoroughly mixed again for 5 minutes. 23.3 Grams of a 2.36 mmole/gram solution of benzyl trimethylammonium hydroxide was added slowly to the mixture while mixing. 8 Grams of D.I. water was added slowly and the resulting mixture mixed thoroughly for 1 hour. The resulting mixture was in the form of slightly wet granules with a volatiles content of 59.6%.<br><br>
The molar composition of the synthesis mix was:<br><br>

OH-/SiO2 0.39<br><br>
H2O/SiO2 4.8<br><br>
The resulting reaction mixture was divided into two parts (parts A and B)1 each part was placed in separate 3.5 inch pipe autoclaves and crystallized at 1600C for 2 days (for Part A) and 4 days (for part B).<br><br>
The products were washed with pH 12.5 water twice, then once with plain D.I. <br><br>
water. The products were filtered and dried in a vacuum oven at 1200C overnight, then calcined at 11000F for 6 hours.<br><br>
The resulting products were SSZ-13.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 2<br><br>
