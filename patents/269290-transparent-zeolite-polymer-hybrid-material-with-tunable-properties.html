Description<br>
Transparent zeolite-polymer hybrid material with tunable properties<br>
Embedding inorganic particles into organic matrice is a versatile method to add new<br>
features to a defined material. These novel properties can, in turn, be used in the<br>
development of devices such as infrared plastic light-emitting diodes for use in<br>
telecommunications, dye nanostructured materials for optical data storage or for<br>
improvement of chemical-physical properties of a polymer. For optical applications,<br>
particles are inserted into a matrix while transparency is maintained. To reach this<br>
goal several factors need to be considered. As light scattering strongly depends on<br>
the particle size, aggregation must be prevented. Uncoated zeolite samples, for<br>
example, show characteristic zeolite aggregates (white spots) of different sizes up to<br>
a diameter of 400 nm. Such aggregates produce visible light scattering. On the other<br>
hand, coated zeolite samples show only the structure of the polymer.<br>
It was the object of the invention to provide novel highly transparent zeolite-polymer<br>
hybrid material, a simple process for the preparation thereof as well as its use in the<br>
making of optical devices.<br>
The present invention provides a transparent zeolite-polymer hybrid material<br>
comprising zeolite crystals dispersed in a polymer A, wherein<br>
(i)       the zeolite crystals have parallel channels and/or cavities inside the crystal<br>
and a<br>
crystal length of 20 to 7000 nm,<br>
(ii)      the channels and/or cavities of the zeolite crystals contain guest molecules,<br>
clusters or ions,<br>
(iii)     the zeolite crystals are surface-coated with a polymerizable silane,<br>
(iv)     polymer A is a transparent organic polymer.<br><br>
Preferably, polymer A is selected from the group consisting of polyolefmes,<br>
polysiloxanes, polyacrylates, polymethacrylates, polyvinyls, polyesters,<br>
polycarbonates, and polyurethanes.<br>
Polymer A is obtainable by common polymerization processes of the respective<br>
monomers by methods known to the skilled artisan.<br>
Examples of polymer A or suitable starting products for manufacturing polymer A<br>
include:<br>
polyol(allyl carbonate) monomers, e.g., allyl diglycol carbonates such as diethylene<br>
glycol bis(allyl carbonate), which monomer is sold under the trademark ©CR-39 by<br>
PPG Industries, Inc.;<br>
poly(urea urethane) polymers, which are prepared, for example, by the reaction of a<br>
polyurethane prepolymer and a diamine curing agent, a composition for one of such<br>
polymers being sold under the trademark ©TRIVEX by PPG Industries, Inc.;<br>
polyol(meth)acryloyl terminated carbonate monomer; diethylene glycol<br>
dimethacrylate monomers; ethoxylated phenol methacrylate monomers;<br>
diisopropenyl benzene monomers; ethoxylated trimethylol propane triacrylate<br>
monomers; ethylene glycol bismethacrylate monomers; poly(ethylene glycol)<br>
bismethacrylate monomers; urethane acrylate monomers; poly(ethoxylated bisphenol<br>
A dimethacrylate); poly(vinyl acetate); poly(vinyl alcohol); poly(vinyl chloride);<br>
poly(vinylidene chloride); polyethylene; polypropylene; polyurethanes;<br>
polythiourethanes; thermoplastic polycarbonates, such as the carbonate-linked resin<br>
derived from bisphenol A and phosgene, one such material being sold under the<br>
trademark ©LEXAN; polyesters, such as the material sold under the trademark<br>
©MYLAR; poly(ethylene terephthalate); polyvinyl butyral; poly(methyl methacrylate),<br>
such as the material sold under the trademark ©PLEXIGLAS, and polymers prepared<br>
by reacting polyfunctional isocyanates with polythiols or polyepisulfide monomers,<br>
either homopolymerized or co-and/or terpolymerized with polythiols, polyisocyanates,<br>
polyisothiocyanates and optionally ethylenically unsaturated monomers or<br>
halogenated aromatic-containing vinyl monomers. Also contemplated are copolymers<br>
of such monomers and blends of the described polymers and copolymers with other<br>
polymers, for example, to form block copolymers.<br>
Especially preferred is a polymer made from diethylene glycol bis-allyl carbonate,<br>
hereinafter called ©CR-39. CR-39 can be obtained by polymerizing the liquid<br>
2<br><br>
monomer diethylene glycol bis-allyl carbonate with 3 to 6 w/w % of di-benzoyl<br>
peroxide as an initiator. The two allyl groups allow a cross-linking polymerization<br>
giving a hard, insoluble and transparent material.<br>
The amount of the zeolite crystals dispersed in polymer A is preferably 0.1 to 40 %<br>
by volume, e.g. 0.5 to 25 % by volume, relative to the total volume of the hybrid<br>
material.<br>
In the present invention zeolites are understood as alumo-silicates containing free<br>
hydroxyl groups and having parallel channels and/or cavities inside the crystal and a<br>
crystal length of 20 to 7000 nm, preferably 30 to 3000 nm.<br>
Zeolite L is of particular interest. Zeolite L is a cylindrically shaped, porous<br>
aluminosilicate with a crystal length in the range of 30 to 7000 nm and featuring<br>
hundreds thousands of strictly parallel channels. The diameter of the channel<br>
opening is about 0.7 nm and the largest free diameter is about 1.3 nm, making<br>
zeolite L an ideal host material for the supramolecular organisation of monomeric<br>
dyes.<br>
The guest species loaded into the zeolite cavities are protected from the environment<br>
while still offering their optical characteristics to the hybrid material. For example,<br>
photochromic and/or remarkable photoluminescence properties can be achieved<br>
through insertion into zeolites of organic compounds, especially derived from organic<br>
dyes and pigments, e.g. biphenyls, terphenyls, quaterphenyls, tetracenes, perylenes,<br>
triphendioxazines, acridines, stilbenes, azobenzenes, oxazolyl benzenes, styryl<br>
benzenes, fluorenone, isoviolanthrones, C.I. Solvent Orange 63, C.I. Solvent Yellow<br>
98, 43, 44, C.I. Solvent Green 5, thioindigo compounds, and spiropyrans,<br>
naphthopyrans, carotenoids, carotenes, xanthenophylles, flavines, pyronines,<br>
oxazines, thionines, resorufine, methylviologen, carbocyanines, or inorganic<br>
compounds such as silver halides, e.g. silver chloride, silver sulfide, titanium dioxide,<br>
silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, lead sulfide.<br>
Incorporation of high refractive index (Rl) components, like TiO2, SiO2, SiN, Ag2S,<br>
PbS, Si-clusters, in zeolite channels might lead to an increase in the Rl of organic<br>
glass lenses based on polymer A. These results provide a promising method for<br>
developing optical devices such as lenses, special mirrors, filters, polarizer, grids,<br>
optical storage, monitors, window panes, float glass.<br>
3<br><br>
The amount of the guest molecules or ions in the zeolite crystals is judiciously 3 to 6<br>
weight % (M/M), relative to the weight of the unloaded zeolite. Loadings up to 10 %<br>
can be achieved.<br>
The present invention also provides a process of preparing a transparent zeolite-<br>
polymer hybrid material as described above, comprising<br>
(i)       loading zeolite crystals with guest molecules or ions,<br>
(ii)      coating the surface of the loaded zeolite crystals with a polymerizable silane,<br>
(iii)     dispersing the coated zeolite crystals in a liquid monomer, as specified above,<br>
and<br>
(iv)     polymerizing the polymerizable silane and the liquid monomer to form a<br>
polymer A wherein said zeolite crystals are dispersed.<br>
Like the Russian nested dolls principle, the general process of the invention is based<br>
on the insertion of optically active compounds (dyes, high refractive index elements,<br>
elements providing high or negative Abbe' numbers) inside coated zeolites crystals,<br>
themselves incorporated inside polymer A (Fig. 1). Furthermore, such a matrix offers<br>
protection to zeolites preventing oxygen and water interaction. Thus, even sensitive<br>
dyes like xanthene dyes or thioxanthones can be used in the development of stable<br>
materials.<br>
Before loading the zeolite crystals with the desired guest molecule, it is judiciously<br>
preferred to control the environmental conditions, such as pH, counter ions, water or<br>
gas content, by partially or fully exchanging the zeolite counter ions.<br>
Solid state acidity therefore can be tuned by exchanging the zeolite counter ions.<br>
Surprisingly a strong modulating effect in the series Na &gt; K &gt; Cs on solid state acidity<br>
was found which allows to buffer the strong acidity of a sodium zeolite by exchange<br>
with Cs+ ions. Acid sensitve dyes may serve as indicators.<br>
Zeolite particles usually have low dispersion stabilization in the liquid monomer,<br>
which leads to rapid sedimentation. It was found that this drawback can be overcome<br>
by modifying hydroxyl groups on the surface of the zeolite crystals with a silane<br>
containing at least one terminal olefinic double bond or containing a leaving group<br>
such as a halide or an alkoxy. Examples for such silanes are:<br>
4<br><br>
Trivinylethoxysilane: CH3CH2OSi(CH=CH2)3,<br>
Methacryloxymethyltrimethoxysilane:<br><br><br>
3-(Diethoxymethylsilyl)propylmethacrylate:<br><br>
Allyltriethoxysilane:<br>
6<br><br><br>
Triallyloxyvinylsilane:<br><br>
Triacetoxy(vinyl)silane:<br><br>
i     Trimethoxy(7-octen-1 -yl)silane:<br><br>
7<br><br>
3-(Trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate:<br><br>
Most preferred silane as coating material is trivinyl-ethoxysilane and<br>
methacryloxymethyltrimethoxysilane which can advantageously be used for coating<br>
the zeolite and introducing it in both ©CR-39 and poiymethylmethacrylate.<br>
For a good coating of the entire surface of zeolite, loaded zeolite crystals and the<br>
polymerizable silane are combined in an inert organic solvent, such as toluene,<br>
benzene, xylene, ethers and esters, and treated at a temperature between 10 and<br>
200°C, preferably between 20 and 150°C. The necessary amount of the silane<br>
relative to the zeolite crystals can be estimated by the specific surface area of the<br>
zeolite material. A rough guideline would be to estimate the demand to 2-4 mg /m2<br>
corresponding to 0.5 up to 10 monolayers of silane.<br>
High transparency of polymer A has to be maintained upon incorporation of zeolites.<br>
Due to its organic nature, the liquid monomer to form polymer A is not able to well<br>
solubilise inorganic compounds such as zeolites. Zeolite surface modification with<br>
silane derivatives, as described in the foregoing, diminishes aggregation and<br>
8<br><br>
improves the dispersibility of zeolites in the liquid monomer. Said silanes render the<br>
zeolite particles organophiliic in the outer region while preserving intact the inorganic<br>
host channels and cavities.<br>
The coating covalently linked to zeolite crystals plays two roles. Firstly, it increases<br>
interactions with the liquid monomer allowing a more efficient dispersion of the<br>
crystals. Secondly, the polymerisation suppresses entirely microphase separation. As<br>
a result, coated zeolites gave rise to highly transparent doped polymer.<br>
After dispersion of the coated zeolite crystals in the liquid monomer, the mixture is<br>
polymerized according to the procedures commonly used for the respective pure<br>
polymer. During this step, (co)polymerization of the polymerizable silane as well as<br>
(co)polymerization of the liquid monomer take place.<br>
Since the outer surface modification has no impact on the conditions found inside<br>
of the zeolite L, their channels and/or cavities can be loaded with a wide array of<br>
guest species prior to this step. Optical characteristics of the guests, such as colour,<br>
photochromism, Abbe number or refractive index, can be used to tune the properties<br>
of the hybrid material.<br>
Another embodiment of this invention is the preparation of transparent oriented<br>
zeolite monolayers on substrates like organic and inorganic glasses, which strongly<br>
scatter visible light if no precautions are taken. This phenomenon disappears<br>
completely when the monolayers are covered with for example CR39, giving rise to<br>
transparent, unidirectional zeolite containing material.<br>
To build zeolite monolayers, a glass surface is chemically activated with silane<br>
derivatives, such as 3-chIoropropyltrimethoxysilane. Then, zeolites are reacted<br>
through hydroxyl groups on the functionalised glass surface leading, after washing, to<br>
compact monolayers. These are finally covered with liquid monomers as specified<br>
above and hardened to give rise to transparent material containing unidirectional<br>
zeolite monolayers covered with polymer A. In this embodiment, a modification of<br>
zeolite surface is not necessary, as aggregates are washed from the glass plate prior<br>
to polymer coverage and microphase separation does not play a big role in the<br>
monolayer.<br>
9<br><br>
Another possibility is to use glues with a high refractive index like cyanoacrylates<br>
such as methyl-2-cyanoacrylate. The glue covers the monolayer, and another sheet<br>
of glass or hard polymer can be stacked on. The glue can be a derivate of acrylics,<br>
epoxy, polyurethane.<br>
As the size of the channels enforce a preferential direction of the incorporated dyes,<br>
two different functions can be envisaged. By using the stop-cock principle as<br>
described in WO 02/36490 A1, a transparent mono-directional light emitting material<br>
can be obtained. By selecting an appropriate dye, total internal reflection can take<br>
place, thus transferring harvested light to a specific place of the material for energy<br>
conversion.<br>
For example, UV-Vis absorption spectrum of a xanthene loaded zeolite L monolayer<br>
measured before ©CR-39 coverage does not reveal the characteristic absorption<br>
bands of the dye, light scattering being too strong thus impeding the measurement by<br>
rendering the sample optically opaque. Examination of absorption spectra of CR39,<br>
xanthene -loaded zeolite monolayer and xanthene -loaded zeolite monolayer covered<br>
with ©CR-39 on glass substrate, in comparison to monolayer covered with polymer<br>
demonstrates this effect: Only the polymer covered monolayer allows to observe the<br>
     xanthene absorption band around 580 nm.<br>
Examples<br>
Disc-shaped zeolites were synthesized according to the procedure in Monatshefte<br>
fur Chemie 136, 77-89 (2005).<br>
     Nanosized zeolite L and Hostasol Red GG were obtained from Clariant Produkte<br>
(Deutschland) GmbH.<br>
Example 1:   Pre-treatment of zeolite crystals to control internal aciditiy<br>
     0.1 g of nano zeolite L were suspended in 10 ml of a caesium nitrate (1 mmol/l)<br>
solution. The suspension was left stirring at 60°C for 12 h. After centrifugation, the<br>
exchanged material was washed twice with deionized water and dried in an oven at<br>
80°Cfor12h.<br>
10<br><br>
Example 2:   Zeolite surface modification with alkoxysilanes<br>
Trivinylethoxysilane (0.4 ml) was added to a suspension of zeolite L (0.100 g) in<br>
toluene (4 ml). The mixture was refluxed for 16 h at 110 °C. After centrifugation, the<br>
residue was washed once with toluene, and dried at 80°C for 12 h.<br>
Yield: Quantitative<br>
Example 3:   Copolymerisation of liquid monomer with surface modified zeolite<br>
crystals<br>
1 ml of the liquid monomer diethylene glycol bis allyl carbonate was added to a glass<br>
mold containing from 1 to 5% w/w of surface treated nano sized zeolite L (Example<br>
2). After vortex mixing for 30 s the mixture was sonicated at 60°C for 30 min. Di-<br>
benzoyl peroxide (0.030 g) was added and the mixture was sonicated again at 65°C<br>
until gel formation took place. The sample was left in the oven at 80°C for 48h.<br>
Example 4:   Preparation of hybrid material with ©Hostasol Red GG loaded zeolite L<br>
Zeolite L nanocrystals were first exchanged with Cs+ according to the procedure in<br>
Example 1, before loading them with Hostasol Red GG. The organic dye was<br>
inserted via a gas phase adsorption process. 0.73 mg of a Hostasol Red GG was<br>
added to 100 mg of zeolite L in a glass ampoule. This mixture was dried at 110 °C for<br>
16 h, at a pressure of 6 x 10-2 mbar. The ampoule was then sealed off under<br>
vacuum and the insertion took place in a rotating oven for 24 h at 250 °C. The<br>
product was washed with dry toluene in order to remove dyes adsorbed to the outer<br>
surface of the zeolites. The surface of the cleaned crystals was then modified with<br>
trivinylethoxysilane by the method mentioned above in Example 2.<br>
60 mg of the dried, loaded and modified material was finely divided to give a fine<br>
powder, suspended in 6 ml of toluene, and sonicated for 30 min. For the<br>
     copolymerisation step, 1 ml of diethylene glycol bis allyl carbonate was added to the<br>
suspension. Toluene was evaporated at 65°C under vacuum (6 x 10-2 mbar) and<br>
sonication. 0.030 g of di-benzoyl peroxide was added and the mixture was sonicated<br>
at 65°C until gel formation could be observed. The sample was then hardened in an<br>
oven at80oCfor48 h.<br>
11<br><br>
Example 5:   Preparation of hybrid material with oxonine loaded zeolite L<br>
The nanosized zeolite L crystals were first exchanged with K+ in order to reduce the<br>
internal acidity. This was carried out in a similar way as described in Example 1. 300<br>
mg of the K+ -exchanged zeolite L were placed in a flask and suspended in 400 ml of<br>
water. 3 ml of an aqueous oxonine solution (c = 6*10-5 M) were added. The<br>
suspension was refluxed for 90 min, cooled to room temperature and centrifuged.<br>
The loaded zeolite was washed three times with 1-butanol. The surface of the<br>
cleaned crystals was then modified with trivinylethoxysilane by the method described<br>
in Example 2. 100 mg of the dried, loaded and modified material were reduced to a<br>
fine powder and added to 1 ml of diethylene glycol bis allyl carbonate. The mixture<br>
was vortex mixed for 30 s and sonicated for 30 min at 60°C. 0.030 g of di-benzoyl<br>
peroxide were added and the mixture was sonicated at 65°C until gel formation could<br>
be observed. The sample was then hardened in an oven at 80°C for 48 h.<br>
Example 6:   Zeolite monolayers coated with polymer A<br>
A glass plate (2 cm diameter, 2 mm width) was washed in a Caro's acid (mix of<br>
hydrogen perxoxide with sulfuric acid) for 3h at 110°C, rinsed extensively with<br>
deionized water and placed into a flask containing toluene (10 ml). Then,<br>
3-chloropropyltrimethoxysilane (0.4 ml) was added and the mixture was refluxed for<br>
3h under inert atmosphere.<br>
A suspension of disk-like zeolite L (15 mg) in toluene (10 ml) was sonicated for 20<br>
     minutes. Then, the glass plate was added to the zeolite suspension and sonicated for<br>
another 30 minutes. The glass plate was sonicated in toluene for some seconds to<br>
remove physisorbed zeolites.<br>
The prepared monolayer is now loaded with guest compounds. The loading<br>
procedure is identical to those described under example 4 and 5.<br>
     A mixture of liquid monomer diethylene glycol bis allyl carbonate (0.5 ml) and di-<br>
benzoyl peroxide (0.030 g) was heated at around 80°C until the solution was viscous.<br>
One face of the glass plate was covered with that viscous solution and left in the<br>
oven for 48h.<br>

trimethoxysilane.<br>
8)       A process of preparing a transparent zeolite-polymer hybrid material as<br>
claimed in any of claims 1 to 7, comprising<br>
(i)       loading zeolite crystals with guest molecules, clusters or ions,<br>
(ii)      coating the surface of the loaded zeolite crystals with a polymerizable silane,<br>
(iii)     dispersing the coated zeolite crystals in a liquid monomer or oligomer, and<br>
(iv)     polymerizing the polymerizable silane and the liquid monomer or oligomer to<br>
form a polymer A wherein said zeolite crystals are dispersed.<br>
9)       The process of claim 8, wherein before loading the zeolite crystals with the<br>
guest molecule, cluster or ion, counter ions of the zeolite are partially or fully<br>
exchanged with alkali cations.<br>
10)      Use of a transparent zeolite-polymer hybrid material as claimed in any of<br>
claims 1 to 7 for developing optical devices such as lenses, eye glasses, special<br>
mirrors, filters, polarizer, grids, optical storage, monitors, window panes, float glass,<br>
or for coating of organic and inorganic surfaces for anti-reflection properties or light<br>
wavelength transformation.<br><br>
14<br><br>
The invention is about the preparation of novel highly transparent zeolite-doped<br>
polymer and zeolites monolayers.<br>
External coating of the zeolite crystals by covalently linked functionalized<br>
alkoxysilane derivatives allows for an efficient dispersion of the nano zeolite particles<br>
into an organic liquid monomer; the following co -polymerisation process leads to a<br>
hard, insoluble and transparent material containing said zeolites. Optical properties<br>
such as colour, refractive index, Abbe number or photochromism can be fine tuned<br>
by simply changing zeolite loading, while transparency is maintained.</td>
