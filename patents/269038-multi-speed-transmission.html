MULTI-SPEED TRANSMISSION<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/916,439, filed on May 7, 2007. The disclosure of the above<br>
application is incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
FIELD<br>
[0002] The invention relates generally to a multiple speed transmission<br>
having a plurality of planetary gear sets and a plurality of torque transmitting<br>
devices and more particularly to a transmission having eight or more speeds,<br>
four planetary gear sets and a plurality of torque transmitting devices.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may or may not constitute prior<br>
art.<br>
[0004] A typical multiple speed transmission uses a combination of<br>
friction clutches, planetary gear arrangements and fixed interconnections to achieve a plurality of gear ratios. The number and physical arrangement of the planetary gear sets, generally, are dictated by packaging, cost and desired speed ratios.	<br><br>
[0005] While current transmissions achieve their intended purpose, the<br>
need for new and improved transmission configurations which exhibit improved<br>
performance, especially from the standpoints of efficiency, responsiveness and<br>
smoothness and improved packaging, primarily reduced size and weight, is<br>
essentially constant. Accordingly, there is a need for an improved, cost-effective,<br>
compact multiple speed transmission.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0025] The following description is-merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses.<br>
[0026] At the outset, it should be appreciated that in the particular<br>
example provided, the eight speed automatic transmission of the present<br>
invention has an arrangement of permanent mechanical connections between<br>
the elements of the four planetary gear sets. A first component or element of a<br>
first planetary gear set is permanently coupled to a ground. A first component or<br>
element of a second planetary gear set is also permanently coupled to a ground.<br>
A second component or element of the first planetary gear set is permanently<br>
coupled to a second component or element of the second planetary gear set.<br>
Finally, a second component or element of the third planetary gear set is<br>
permanently coupled to a second component or element of a fourth planetary<br>
gear set.<br>
[0027] Referring now to FIG. 1, an embodiment of an eight speed<br>
transmission 10 is illustrated in a lever diagram format. A lever diagram is a<br>
schematic representation of the components of a mechanical device such as an<br>
automatic transmission. Each individual lever represents a planetary gear set<br>
wherein the three basic mechanical components of the planetary gear set are<br><br>
each represented by a node. Therefore, a single lever contains three nodes:<br>
one for the sun gear, one for the planet gear carrier, and one for the ring gear.<br>
i<br>
The relative length between the nodes of each lever can be used to represent the ;■<br>
ring-to-sun ratio of each respective gear set. These lever ratios, in turn, are used<br>
to vary the gear ratios of the transmission in order to achieve appropriate ratios<br>
and ratio progression.. Mechanical couplings or interconnections between the<br>
nodes of the various planetary gear sets are illustrated by thin, horizontal lines<br>
and torque transmitting mechanisms or devices such as clutches and brakes are ,<br>
presented as interleaved fingers. If the device is a brake, one set of the fingers is<br>
grounded. Further explanation of the format, purpose and use of lever diagrams<br>
can be found in SAE Paper 810102, "The Lever Analogy: A New Tool in<br>
Transmission Analysis" by Benford and Leising which is hereby fully incorporated<br>
by reference.<br>
[0028] The transmission 10 includes an input shaft or member 12, a<br>
first planetary gear set 14 having three nodes: a first node 14A, a second node<br>
14B and a third node 14C, a second planetary gear set 16 having three nodes: a<br>
first node 16A, a second node 16B and a third node 16C, -a third planetary gear<br>
set 18 having three nodes: a first node 18A, a second node 18B and a third node<br>
18C, a fourth planetary gear set 20 having three nodes: a first node 20A, a<br>
second node 20B and a third node 20C and an output shaft or member 22.<br>
[0029] The input member 12 is coupled to the third node 18C of the<br>
third planetary gear set 18. The output member 22 is coupled to the first node<br>
18A of the third planetary gear set 18. The first node 14A of the first planetary<br><br>
• gear set 14 is coupled to a ground or transmission housing 40. The first node<br>
16A of the second planetary gear set 16 is also coupled to the ground or<br>
transmission housing 40. The second node 14B of the first planetary gear set 14<br>
is coupled to the second node 16B of the second planetary gear set 16. The j<br>
' second node 18B of the third planetary gear set 18 is coupled to the second<br>
node 20B of the fourth planetary gear set 20.<br>
[0030] A first clutch 26 selectively connects the input member 12 to the<br>
third node 16C of the second planetary gear set 16. A second clutch 28<br>
selectively connects the second node 14B of the first planetary gear set 14 to'the<br>
first node 20A of the fourth planetary gear set 20. A third clutch 30 selectively<br>
connects the second node 14B of the first planetary gear set 14 to the third node<br>
20C of the fourth planetary gear set 20. A fourth clutch 32 selectively connects<br>
the third node 14C of the first planetary gear set 14 to the third node 20C of the<br>
fourth planetary gear set 20. A fifth clutch 34 selectively connects the first node<br>
20A of the fourth planetary gear set 20 to the first node 18A of the third planetary<br>
gear set 18.<br>
[0031] Referring now to Fig. 2, a stick diagram presents a schematic<br>
layout of the embodiment of the eight speed transmission 10 according to the<br>
present invention. In Fig. 2, the numbering from the lever diagram of Fig. 1 is<br>
carried over. The clutches and couplings are correspondingly presented<br>
i<br>
whereas the nodes of the planetary, gear sets now appear as components of<br>
planetary gear sets such as sun gears, ring gears, planet gears and planet gear<br>
carriers.<br><br>
[0032] For example, the planetary gear set 14 is a planetary gear set<br>
that includes a sun gear member 14A, a planet gear carrier member 14C and a<br>
ring gear member 14B. The sun gear member 14A is connected for common<br>
rotation with a first shaft or interconnecting member 42. The ring gear member<br>
14B is connected to a second shaft or interconnecting member 44 and to a third j<br>
i<br>
shaft or interconnecting member 46. The planet gear carrier member 14C<br>
rotatably supports a set of planet gears 14D (only one shown) and is connected<br>
for common rotation with a fourth shaft or interconnecting member 48. The<br>
planet gears 14D are configured to intermesh with the sun gear member 14A and<br>
the ring gear member 14B.<br>
[0033] The input shaft or member 12 is continuously connected to an<br>
engine (not shown) or to a turbine of a torque converter (not shown). The output<br>
shaft or member 22 is continuously connected with the final drive unit or transfer<br>
case (not shown).<br>
[0034] The planetary gear set 16 is a planetary gear set that includes a<br>
sun gear member 16C, a planet carrier member 16A that rotatably supports a set<br>
of planet gears 16D and a ring gear member 16B. The sun gear member 16C is<br>
connected for common rotation with the first clutch 26. The planet carrier<br>
member 16A is connected to the ground or transmission housing 40 by a fifth<br>
shaft or interconnecting member 50 in order to restrict the planet carrier member<br>
16A from rotating relative to the ground or transmission housing 40. The planet<br>
carrier member 16A is also connected for common rotation with the first<br>
interconnecting member 42. The ring gear member 16B is connected for<br><br>
common rotation with the second interconnecting member 44. The planet gears<br>
16D are configured to intermesh with both the sun gear member 16C and the<br>
ring gear member 16B.<br>
[0035] The planetary gear set 18 is a planetary gear set that includes a<br>
sun gear member 18B, a ring gear member 18A and a planet carrier member<br>
18C that rotatably supports a set of planet gears 18D. The sun gear member<br>
i<br>
18B is connected for common rotation with a sixth shaft or interconnecting<br>
member 52. The ring gear member 18A is connected for common rotation with a<br>
seventh shaft or interconnecting member 54 and with the output member 22.<br>
The planet carrier member 18C is connected for common rotation with the input<br>
member 12. The planet gears 18D are configured to intermesh with both sun •<br>
gear member 18B and ring gear member 18A.<br>
[0036] * The planetary gear set 20 is a planetary gear set that includes a<br>
sun gear member 20B, a ring gear member 20C and a planet carrier member<br>
20A that rotatably supports a set of planet gears 20D. The sun gear member<br>
20B is connected for common rotation with the sixth interconnecting member 52.<br>
The ring gear member 20C is connected for common rotation with an eighth shaft<br>
or interconnecting member 56. The planet carrier member 20A is connected for<br>
common rotation with a ninth shaft or interconnecting member 58. The planet ;<br>
gears 20D are configured to intermesh with both the sun gear member 20B and<br>
the ring gear member 20C.<br>
[0037] The torque-transmitting mechanisms or clutches 26, 28, 30, 32<br>
and 34 allow for selective interconnection of the shafts or interconnecting<br><br>
members, members of the planetary gear sets and the housing. For example,<br>
the first clutch 26 is selectively engageable to connect the sun gear member 16C<br>
to the input member 12. The second clutch 28 is selectively engageable to<br>
connect the third interconnecting member 46 to the ninth interconnecting<br>
member 58. The third clutch 30 is selectively engageable to connect the third<br>
interconnecting member 46 to the eighth interconnecting member 56. The<br>
fourth clutch 32 is selectively engageable to connect the fourth interconnecting<br>
i<br>
member 48 to the eighth interconnecting member 56. The fifth clutch 34 is<br>
selectively engageable to connect the seventh interconnecting member 54 to the<br>
ninth interconnecting member 58.<br>
[0038] Referring now to Figs. 2 and 3, the operation of the embodiment<br>
of the eight speed transmission 10 will be described. It will be appreciated that<br>
transmission 10 is capable of transmitting torque from the input shaft or member<br>
12 to the output shaft or member 22 in at least eight forward speed or torque<br>
ratios and at least one reverse speed or torque ratio. Each forward and reverse<br>
speed or torque ratio is attained by engagement of one or more of the torque-<br>
transmitting mechanisms (i.e. first clutch 26, second clutch 28, third clutch 30,<br>
fourth clutch 32, and fifth clutch 34), as will be explained below. Fig. 3 is a truth<br>
table presenting the various combinations of torque-transmitting mechanisms<br>
that are activated or engaged to achieve the various gear states. Actual<br>
numerical gear ratios of the various gear states are also presented although it<br>
should be appreciated that these numerical values are exemplary only and that<br>
they may be adjusted over significant ranges to accommodate various<br><br>
applications and operational criteria of the transmission 10. An example of the<br>
gear ratios that may be obtained using the embodiments of the present invention<br>
are also shown in Fig. 3. Of course, other gear ratios are achievable depending<br>
on the gear diameter, gear teeth count and gear configuration selected.<br>
[0039] To establish reverse gear, the first clutch 26, the second clutch I<br>
28, and the fifth clutch 34 are engaged or activated. The first clutch 26 connects<br>
the second sun gear member 16C to the input member 12. The second clutch<br>
28 connects the third interconnecting member 46 to the ninth interconnecting<br>
member 58. The fifth clutch 34 connects the seventh interconnecting member 54 ;<br>
to the ninth interconnecting member 58. Likewise, the eight forward ratios are<br>
achieved through different combinations of clutch engagement, as shown in Fig.<br>
3.<br>
[0040] It will be appreciated that the foregoing explanation of operation<br>
and gear states of the eight speed transmission 10 assumes, first of all, that all !<br>
the clutches not specifically referenced in a given gear state are inactive or<br>
disengaged and, second of all, that during'gear shifts, i.e., changes of gear state,<br>
between at least adjacent gear states, a clutch engaged or activated in both gear<br>
states will remain engaged or activated.<br>
[0041] The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are intended to be<br>
within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be regarded as a<br>
departure from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br>
