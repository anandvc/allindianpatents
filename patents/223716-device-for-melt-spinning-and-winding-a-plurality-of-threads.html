Device for Melt-Spinning and Winding a Plurality of Threads<br>
The present invention relates tc a device for melt-spinning and winding a plurality of threads, according to the precharacterising clause of claim 1.<br>
When spinning a plurality of synthetic threads the threads are formed parallel to one another in each case by combining a large number of freshly-spun filaments.  For this purpose the filaments are extruded through adjacently-arranged spinnerets of a spinning device.  After the filaments have been cooled the filament bundle is consolidated by means of a processing device.  In this connection the cohesion between the filaments to form a thread is achieved by a processing aid.<br>
After the threads have left-.the, spinning., device, the .... -	â€¢ -<br>
threads are then created in order to adjust specific physical properties.  To this end the threads are at least passed over a godet unit.  Each of the threads is ther. wound into coils in coiling stations of a winding device arranged in parallel to one another.  In order to avoid prominently projecting godets when taking off and/or stretching the threads, after the melt spinning the threads are brought together at a very small thread treatment interspacing.  During the treatment the threads are brought together in a parallel path at the treatment interspacing over one or more godet units.  After leaving the godet connected upstream of the winding device the threads are spread out from the treatment interspacing to a coiling station interspacing in order to be wound in parallel in the coiling stations.  For this purpose corresponding<br><br>
between the spinning device and the winding device.  Such devices have proved suitable in particular for the melt:-spinning and winding of a relatively large number of threads, i.e. Id 12 or 16 threads.<br>
In order to monitor the production process such devices include thread breakage sensors that are associated wich the threads.  Thus, such a device is known for example from US 6,210,143 in which the thread breakage sensors are associated directly with the coiling stations of the winding device.  The thread breakage sensors serve to signal a thread breakage of one of the threads to a control device so that che melt-spinning process can be interrupted and serious consequential damage due to the knock-on effect of breakages in adjacent threads and winder formations can be avoided.  In particular it must be ensured that, in -he event of a thread breakage in the winding device, the broken thread is not wound on a godet arranged^upstream of the winding device.  For this reason the thread breakage sensors of the known device are associated directly with the winding device.<br>
However, the known device has the disadvantage that the arrangement of the thread breakage sensors, in particular in order to monitor a large number of threads, requires a corresponding large number of interfaces and signal lines and is accordingly extremely susceptible to breakdowns.<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a device for the melt-spinning and winding of a plurality of threads of the type mentioned in the introduction, in which a compact arrangement and construction of the thread breakage sensors<br><br>
provides a reliable and simple package for monitoring the process.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention in -hat the thread breakage sensors are arranged as a structural unit in a plane in the region of the godet unit, in which the threads are brought together at an interspacing of at most 20 mm.  The thread breakage sensors are accordingly disposed within the spinning line in a zone in which the threads are guided next to one another at a narrow interspacing and are not yet spread out or are spread cut just before passing into the winding device.  The invention accordingly dispenses with the idea that a thread breakage occurring in a coiling station has to be recorded and signalled as quickly as possible so as to avoid winder formations in the upstream godet units.  In contrast to this, thread breakages in the thread, path before the winding device are less critical since the broken thread is, as before, drawn from the coiling station.<br>
The invention is based on the knowledge that, with thread breakages in the coiling stations, the winder formations that occurred after this were substantially established only at the inlet side of a godet unit.  Due to the arrangement according to the invention of the thread breakage sensors on the outlet side of the godet unit it is still ensured that, even with a thread breakage in the winding device, a rapid notification takes place in order to avoid winder formations.<br>
According to a particularly advantageous development of the invention the thread breakage sensors are electrically<br><br>
connected to a signal output of the housing.  In order to transfer a signal the signal output is coupled by a signal line to a control device.  Accordingly a large number of thread breakage sensors can be connected via a single interface to the control device.  The interface may in "his connection preferably be formed as a plug-and-socket connection.<br>
In order to be able to monitor reliably a large number of threads already with simple means, it is envisaged according to an advantageous development of the invention to design the electrical coupling of the thread breakage sensors in such a way that a composite signal is generated in the event of a breakage of one of the threads and is passed to the signal output.  The .composite signal is independent of which of the sensors has in each case signalled a thread breakage.  All signals of the"thread breakage sensors are added together-and thus form the composite signal.<br>
In the case where accurate information concerning in which position a thread is broken is required, a preferred development of the invention is employed, in which the electrical coupling of the thread breakage sensors is designed in such a way that, in the event of a breakage of one of the threads, an individual signal associated with the relevant thread breakage sensor is generated and passed to the signal output.  In this case the connection between the structural unit of the thread breakage sensors and the control device is preferably achieved by a profiled bus system.<br><br>
A particularly advantageous development of the invention is characterised in that the thread breakage sensors are arranged downstream directly in the thread path of the last godet, in order to guide the threads as a thread guide before they are spread out.  The thread breakage sensors can therefore be used to monitor the threads as well as oo guide the threads.  Additional thread guides in the ouolet region of the godec are not necessary.  An additional possible mutual contact and deflection of the threads can thereby be avoided.<br>
It is however also possible to arrange the thread breakage    - -sensors in front of the last godet, directly in the thread path of the godec unit before the outlet of the threads. In particular the position in the last loop of the goceos is particularly suitable for the arrangement of the thread breakage sensors.<br>
The thread breakage sensors may be designed as contact sensors, optical sensors or as capacitative sensors.<br>
Particularly when using capacitative measurement means ir_ the thread breakage sensors, the development of the invention in which an evaluation electronics unit is provided, by means of which the signals of the thread breakage sensors can be evaluated in each case to monitor a processing coating of the thread and to determine a breakage of the thread, represent a particularly preferred realisation of the invention.  When using capacitative measurement means the change in capacitance of a capacitor caused by the thread is detected and evaluated.<br><br>
An example of implementation of the invention is described in more detail hereinafter with the aid of Figs. 1 to 4, in which<br>
Fig. 1 shows diagrammatically an example of implementation of the device according to the invention<br>

Fig. 3 shows diagrammatically a further example of<br>

Fig. 4 shows diagrammatically a further example of<br>
implementation of a. device for monitoring the<br>
process	. ...<br>
An example of implementation of the device according to the invention is illustrated diagrammatically in. Fig. 1.  The device consists of a spinning device 2, a godet unit 3 arranged underneath the spinning device 2, as well as a winding device 14 arranged downstream of the godet unit 3. The spinning device 2 is designed for example with three spinning stations in order to spin three synthetic threads parallel to one another.  To this end the spinning device 2 comprises a spinning pump 4, which may be designed for example as a gear pump.  The spinning pump 4 is driven by the pump drive 21.  The pump drive 21 is coupled to a control device 20.  The spinning pump 4 is designed as a multiple pump and supplies simultaneously a plurality of spinnerets 5 in parallel.  Each of the poinnerets z   r = ? a<br><br>
die plate 6 on the underneath, through which a plurality of filament strands 7 are extruded.  The filament strands "" run, immediately after extrusion, through a cooling shaft 8 arranged underneath the spinnerets 5.  Within the cooling shaft 8 a cooling medium, preferably cooling air that is blown in, is directed onto the filament strands 7 so that a cooling of the filament strands 7 takes place within the cooling shaft 8.  At the end of the cooling shaft 8 the filament strands 7 are brought together by means of a processing device 9 and the thread guides 34 to form ir_ each case a thread 1.  The processing device 9 is designed as a roller system, in which the processing roller is driven by a roller drive 10 so that the processing roller, which is partially immersed in a liquid bath, rotates uniformly and wets the threads 1 guided on its surface v;ith a processing agent contained in the bath.<br>
After the filament strands 7 have been combined to fori:, in each case a thread 1, the threads undergo a further treatment in the downstream godet unit 3.  The godet unit 3 consists of a take-off godet 11 and a stretching godet 22. A freely rotatabie overflow roller 12 is associated with the take-off godet 11 and a freely rotatabie overflow roller 23 is associated with the stretching godet 22, so that the threads 1 are guided in parallel in a plurality of loops over the godets 11 and 22.  The take-off godet 11 is driven by the godet drive 13 and the stretching godet 22 is driven by the godet drive 24.  The godet drives 13 and 24 are controlled by the control device 20.  In this connection a differential speed is adjusted between the take-off godet 11 and the stretching godet 22 in order to stretch the threads.<br><br>
The winding device 14 is arranged underneath the godet unit 3, by means of which device the threads 1, after "hey have been treated, are wound in each case onto a spool 15. For this purpose the winding device 14 comprises a total of three winding stations 25 arranged next to one another. For this purpose the spools 15 are held in the winding stations 25 on a projecting driven spindle 16.  The spindle 16 is driven by a winding drive 17 in such a way that the threads 1 are wound at constant winding speed onto the spool 15.  The winding drive 17 is connected to the control device 20.  A pressing roller 19 partly looped by the threads lies on the circumference of the spool 15.  A changing device IS connected upstream of the pressing roller 19, which comprises changing thread guides for each winding station that guide the threads in and out within _ each changing stroke, serves to distribute the threads over the., length of the respective spools 15.<br>
In order to monitor the process in the production of the threads 1, a structural unit 2 6 with a plurality of integrated thread breakage sensors 27 is arranged in the outlet region of the stretching godet 22.  The construction of the structural 'unit 2 6 and the arrangement of the thread breakage sensors 27 within the structural unit will be described in more detail hereinafter.  The thread breakage sensors 27 are coupled to the control device 2 0 via a signal line 28.<br>
A thread collecting device 3 3 that can be controlled via the control device 20 is arranged in the thread path between the spinning device 1 and the godet unit 3.  The thread collecting device 33 includes means for gathering,<br><br>
collecting device is known from SP 1 049 823, and reference may be made at this point to the cited specification.<br>
In order to achieve a good integration of the catch thread devices 27 within the structural unit 26, the threads 1 are monitored by the zhread breakage sensors 27 immediately after leaving the stretching godet 22.  In this region -he interspacings of zhe threads 1 with respect to one another are determined by a treatment interspacing B, which is adjusted for the guidance of the threads 1.  The treatment interspacing B depends on the number of threads and also on the occupancy length of the godets 11 and 22 and on the number of loops cf the threads on the godets 11 and 22.  In those cases where for example up to 12 threads are guided in several loops over a godet, treatment interspacings cf less than 6 mm are adjusted.  In such cases the thread breakage sensors are preferably arranged in an initial region of the collection of threads spread out after leaving the godec.  In this connection it has been found that a treatment interspacing B or an already spread ou: interspacing of the threads relative to one another of a-most 20 mm must be maintained so that a technical and economically utilisable integration of the thread breakage sensors to form a structural unit is still possible.  In this connection the invention only covers those solutions in which during melt-spinning a structural unit of a plurality of thread breakage sensors is formed, in which the thread interspacing is designed to be less than 2 0 rrin.<br>
In the situation illustrated in Fig. 1'the threads 1 are spread out from the treatment interspacing B to the coiling station interspacing A.  In this connection the thread<br><br>
executed directly by the structural unit 26.  The coiling . station interspacing A depends on the spool width and is in the range from 85 mm to 250 mm.  For this purpose a head thread guide 39 is arranged upstream of each coiling station 25, so that the spreading out of the threads 1 from the treatment interspacing B to the coiling station interspacing A is effected by the structural unit 2 6 and the head thread guide 39.<br>
In the case where one of the threads 1 suffers a breakage in the device illustrated in Fig. 1, this is detected by the relevant associated thread breakage sensor 27 and notified to the control device 20 via the signal line 28. Within the control device 20 the sensor signal from the thread breakage sensor is converted into a control order for the thread collecting device 33.  The thread collecting device 33 bundles and separates the threads and guides zhem via a suction device to a yarn holder.  At the same time the pump drive 21 is switched by means of the control device 20 to an extremely slow speed.  The extremely slow speed of the spinning pump 4 is in this connection chosen so that a minimum throughput in the spinnerets 5 is maintained.  This process variant has on the one hand the advantage that a melt source, for example an extruder, connected upstream does not have to be switched off and on the other hand no cooling of the spinnerets takes place. For the sake of completeness it may also be mentioned that the melt-guiding parts are constantly heated by heating devices.<br>
Fig. 2 shows diagrammatically the construction of the structural unit 2 6 from Fig. 1 containing the thread<br><br>
formed within a housing 29 by in each case a guide groove 3 6 and a capacitor 3 0 enclosing the guide groove 36. A total of three guide grooves 3 6 and thus three thread breakage sensors 27 are formed in parallel next to one another in the housing 29.  The threads 1 are guided wiihin the guide groove 36.  In this connection the groove walls of the guide groove 3 6 are preferably provided with ceramic inserts.  In the housing 29 adjacent thread breakage sensors 27 are in each case screened by a screening plate 3 5 in such a way that the adjacent capacitors 3 0 do not influence one another.<br>
Within the housing 29 the capacitors 3 0 and the thread breakage sensors 27 are electrically connected to one another via a coupling 31.  The coupling 31 is constructed in such a way that a composite signal is generated.  The composite signal is fed via a signal output 32 through -he-connected signal line 28 to the control device (not shewn ... here).<br>
In the structural unit 2 6 of the thread breakage sensors 27 illustrated in Fig. 2 three threads 1 are guided in parallel next to one another through the guide grooves 36. Charging and discharging procedures are thereby activated in the associated capacitors 30, leading to a respective change in capacitance of the capacitors 30.  In the case where one of the threads breaks, in one of the thread breakage sensors 27 a change of state occurs at the . associated capacitor 30.  This change of state, which is recorded as a sudden change in capacitance, is formed in the coupling 31 into a composite signal that is conver-ed in the control device into control orders for interrupting<br><br>
the process.  In this connection the position in which a thread break has occurred is disregarded.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a further example of implementation of a structural unit 25, such as could be used for example in the device shown in Fig. 1.  In this example of implementation the thread breakage sensors 27 are formed as contact sensors, in which a piezoelement 37 is arranged in the bottom of the guide groove 36.  The threads 1 are guided in a looped manner to the piezoelements 37 so that a contact force acting on the piezoelements 37 is produced. The guide 3 6 is designed corresponding to the aforedescribed example of implementation.<br>
The piezoelements 37 are connected to the coupling 31, in which in each case an individual signal associated with the position is generated and is passed via the signal output 32 to the signal line 28.  In this way each thread break can be matched to the respective spinning position, which can be useful in particular for discovering and rectifying causes of faults.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a further example of implementation of a device for monitoring the process with a structural unit comprising a plurality of thread breakage sensors 27, such as could be used for example in the device shown in Fig. 1. The construction of the structural unit 26 is identical to the arrangement shown in Fig. 2.  Accordingly reference is made to the preceding description relating to Fig. 2, and i  only the differences will be discussed here.<br>
In the example of implementation according to Fig. 4 the<br><br>
another in such a way that in each case individual signals of the relevant thread breakage sensors 27 can be generated and emitted via "he signal output 32.  Before the signals can be converted in the control device into control orders, the individual signals are comprehensively evaluated beforehand in an evaluation electronics unit 3 8 to determine whether the change in state notified by the individual signal is caused by a thread break or a changed processing coating of the thread.  The evaluation electronics unit 3 8 can for this purpose be integrated in the control device 20, or also however in the structural unit 26.  The evaluation electronics unit 38 is however advantageously connected directly to the control device 20, so that corresponding measures can be taken depending cr. the evaluation.  Thus, for example, if it were found that the processing coating on one of the threads was too thin, a signal could be generated so as to initiate a monitoring and check of the processing device.  It is however also possible, in the event of complete absence of a processing coating as well as in the case of a thread breakage, tc interrupt the process immediately.<br>
The construction of the example of implementation of the device according to the invention shown in Fig. 1 is given by way of example and may be replaced by any arbitrary and suitable design of the spinning device, godet unit and winding device.  The essential feature of the invention is that in the transition region from the godet unit to the winding unit, the thread breakage sensors are directly associated with the godet unit in order to obtain a cor.pact and high degree of integration of the thread sensors, v;hich are associated with a signal line of the control device<br><br>
