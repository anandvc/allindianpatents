				<td>DYNAMIC BRAKING SYSTEM FOR D.C SERIES TRACTION MACHINES<br>
(ORE TRANSFER CAR) TRAVEL MECHANISM.<br>
The present invention relates to a control drive system for a DC electric traction<br>
vehicle operating between two points and, more particularly, to a dynamic<br>
braking system for DC electric traction vehicles (ore transfer car) travel<br>
mechanism in the event of power failure.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In mining operations it is common to employ a shuttle car for transporting the<br>
material being mined, for example, mineral, from the work area to an unloading<br>
area where the material is unloaded onto a conveyor belt or onto cars for<br>
transporting out of the mine. Such cars are electrically operated with the<br>
electrical energy being supplied thereto from a source at the unload ng point via<br>
a cable or trolley lines which moves toward the work area, and returns to the<br>
unloading point. In DC electric motor powered vehicles, it is common practice to<br>
employ the drive motor to brake the vehicle by reversing the direction of torque of<br>
the motor This type of braking is known as plugging Electric industrial vehicles<br>
which are presently designed such that when running at full speed, a direction<br>
selector may be moved to select an opposite direction without releasing the<br>
accelerator In such vehicles an electric control circuit overrides the accelerator<br>
demand and provides a substantially constant level of braking torque until the<br>
motor speed has dropped to near zero.<br>
Previously proposed control systems regulated braking torque by maintaining a<br>
constant level of field flux or by maintaining a constant level of armature current<br>
Both of these methods have known defects. Ore transfer cars are used to<br>
transport iron ore, sinter and additives to blast furnaces hopper in Bhilai steel<br>
plant. It has a travel mechanism, pocket mechanism to discharge raw material in<br>
2<br><br>
different furnace material bunkers. For not allowing the car to roll down after<br>
coming to a halt, the pneumatic brakes are applied. Pneumatic brakes can't be<br>
applied if the car is in motion.<br>
In the event of power failure ore transfer car used to travel down as long it has<br>
kinetic energy, which causes collision between two cars, accidents, damage to<br>
the trolley line and was very unsafe for the personal working around.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Therefore according to the invention the car is provided with a dynamic braking<br>
system for DC series traction machines adapted to be driven over the trolley lines<br>
existing, said system comprising: a wheeled vehicle including at least first and<br>
second wheels, and a drive system supported on said vehicle, said drive system<br>
including a DC series traction motor coupled to said first wheel; a second DC<br>
series traction motor coupled to said second wheel; a controller characterized by<br>
a circuitry for a control system comprising a circuitry which provides stopping /<br>
braking of the car.<br>
According to the invention the car is also provided a control system carried by a<br>
vehicle having a plurality of means which continuously engage the ground to<br>
thereby move the vehicle, said vehicle having a DC traction motor cooperable<br>
with at least some of said ground engaging means to cause movement thereof<br>

cost circuitry.<br>
The sixth object of the present invention is to provide a circuit, which is free from<br>
any maintenance requirements.<br>
The seventh object of the present invention is to provide an electronic circuitry,<br>
which can last long and handle DC power fluctuations.<br>
As per another exemplary object of the present invention is to stop the travel of<br>
the car by means of retardation without the application of pneumatic brakes at<br>
the earliest to ensure safety to the people working around. Moreover to avoid<br>
collision / accidents of two cars in the event of power loss while traveling in<br>
opposite direction and to avoid any damage to the cars and trolley line caused<br>
due to derailments etc.<br>

dynamic breaking contactors are permanently "ON". It gets triggered in the event<br>
4<br><br>
of power loss or the operator can apply emergency switch to drop dynamic<br>
breaking contactors to stop the car. the dynamic breaking contactors gets<br>
triggered in the event of power loss or the operator can apply emergency switch<br>
to drop dynamic breaking contactors to stop the car.<br>
These together with other objects of the invention, along with the various features<br>
of novelty, which characterize the invention, are pointed out with particularity in<br>
the claims annexed to and forming a part of this disclosure. For a better<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Invention relates to electric systems of vehicles furnished with dc motors,<br>
particularly to regenerative braking devices of traction electric motors of cars.<br>
Proposed device contains two parallel groups of traction motors. Armature<br>
5<br><br>
windings of traction electric motors in each group are connected through diode<br>
into series circuit with field windings, anode reactors, two steps of brake resistor,<br>
in brake resistor circuits. Starting and braking of traction electric motors in<br>
effected by means of regulators of current in field windings and voltage in<br>
armature windings<br>
In DC electric motor powered vehicles, it is common practice to employ the drive<br>
motor to brake the vehicle by reversing the direction of torque of the motor This<br>
type of braking is known as dynamic braking or plugging Electric industrial<br>
vehicles are presently designed such that when running at full speed, a direction<br>
selector may be moved to select an opposite direction without releasing the<br>
accelerator In such vehicles an electric control circuit overrides the accelerator<br>
demand and provides a substantially constant level of braking torque until the<br>
motor speed has dropped to near zero.<br>
Previously proposed control systems regulated braking torque by maintaining a<br>
constant level of field flux or by maintaining a constant level of armature current<br>
Both of these methods have known defects, a typical example of which is an<br>
effect called "cogging " Cogging is recognizable as one or more bumps or<br>
lurches of the vehicle which normally occur toward the end of the braking interval<br>
as a result of variations in braking torque It has been found that cogging is much<br>
more pronounced when the vehicle is switched into a braking mode at a low<br>
rather than a high speed It has also been found that cogging is more pronounced<br>
in those vehicles using electric motors with a high K, motor constant, which<br>
motors produce more counter EMF per ampere of field current Previous attempts<br>
to alleviate cogging by selection of motors having low K v motor constants have<br>
been inefficient aid ineffectual other attempts to reduce cogging by providing<br>
controlled acceleration have proven impractical because excessive response<br>
times produce sluggish operation of the vehicle.<br>
6<br><br>
Normally the car travels in forward and reverse direction, to bring it to a halt<br>
reversing plugging is done. But in case of power loss from the source, the<br>
reversing plugging will not work. In order to bring it to a halt, the kinetic energy of<br>
the car is required to be dissipated to bring the car to stand still. There was no<br>
scheme available to bring it to stand still in the event of power failure.<br>
Hence by putting d1,d2,d3,d4,(diodes), dynamic braking contactors (DBC's) with<br>
dynamic breaking resistances (DBR's), the direction of the current generated by<br>
the Eb (back electro motive force) is getting applied automatically to bring the car<br>
to retard stop.<br>
Whenever the car travels the back EMF will be in opposite direction to that of<br>
applied voltage. The max back EMF is theoretically around 95% of the applied<br>
voltage.<br>
For causing the smooth normal operation the dynamic breaking contactors are<br>
permanently "ON". It gets triggered in the event of power loss or the operator can<br>
apply emergency switch to drop dynamic breaking contactors to stop the car.<br>
Some of the Salient features of the present invention:<br>
A.	Safety to the individuals working around.<br>
B.	No collision can take place if two cars travel in opposite direction and<br>
there      a loss of power.<br>
C.	No damage to the cars, trolley lines and its brackets.<br>
Benefits:<br>
A.	Created an atmosphere of confidence building amongst the operators.<br>

series motors.<br>
B.	The scheme can be made workable for any number of motors operating<br>
by expanding the scheme.<br>
