				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
Water-soluble fiber-reactive disazo dyes, preparation thereof and use thereof<br>
This invention relates to the field of fiber-reactive copper complex disazo dyes.<br>
Copper complexes of fiber-reactive disazo compounds containing one or more fiber-<br>
reactive groups are known for example from DE-B-1 544 541, DE-B-1 644 155,<br>
EP 668 328, DE 32 02 120, EP 085 378, EP 040 806, EP 085 378, EP 203 505,<br>
DE 3941620, DE 4039866, EP 281898, EP 395951. However, they have certain<br>
application defects, for example an excessive dependence of the color yield on<br>
varying parameters in the dyeing process, or an inadequate or unlevel color build-up<br>
on cotton, good color build-up resulting from the ability of a dye to provide a stronger<br>
dyeing when used in a higher dye concentration in the dyebath. Moreover, these<br>
dyes exhibit unsatisfactory fixation yields, i.e., the portion of dye permanently fixed to<br>
the material to be dyed is too low, especially at low temperatures, and also<br>
unsatisfactory wash- and lightfastnesses.<br>
However, it is important, for ecological and economic reasons, to provide dyes<br>
having particularly high fixation yields in order that the portion of unfixed dye in the<br>
dyehouse effluent may be minimized. Moreover, dyes should always provide<br>
uniformly strong dyeings, ideally regardless of changing dyeing parameters, for<br>
example the dyeing temperature in the dyeing process. Furthermore, washfastness<br>
requirements are more stringent these days.<br>
The present invention now provides dyes of the general formula (1) which<br>
surprisingly afford distinctly superior washfastnesses and lightfastnesses coupled<br>
with very good build-up. Moreover, these dyes have higher fixation yields and a<br>
distinctly lower parameter dependence in dyeing. They are therefore also more<br>
compatible with other dyes which fix at distinctly lower temperatures.<br>
The invention accordingly provides dyes of the general formula (1):<br>
where<br>
M is hydrogen, alkali, ammonium or the equivalent of an alkaline earth metal ion<br>
v is 0 or 1 and<br>
Z is-CH=CH2or -CH2CH2Z1,<br>
where<br>
Z1 is hydroxyl or an alkali-detachable group, and<br>
R1 is hydrogen or C1-C4-alkyl;<br>
R2 is a moiety of the general formulae (2), (3), (4) or (5)<br>
where<br>
T1 is hydrogen, methyl, fluorine or chlorine,<br>
T2 is hydrogen, fluorine or chlorine with the proviso that T2 and T1 are not both<br>
hydrogen;<br>
T3 is hydrogen, fluorine or chlorine;<br>
A is C1 to C4-alkyl which may be substituted by up to two substituents selected<br>
from the group consisting of chloro, bromo, hydroxyl and carboxyl, C2 to C4<br>
alkenyl which may be substituted by up to two substituents from the group<br>
consisting of chloro, bromo and hydroxyl, or phenyl,<br>
L is phenylene or naphthalene, which may be substituted by up to two<br>
substituents selected from the group consisting of chloro, bromo, hydroxyl, C<br>
to C4-alkyl especially methyl, ethyl, sulfo and cyano, or else a C2 to C6<br>
alkylene;<br>
Z is-CH=CH2, -CH2CH2Z1,<br>
where<br>
Z1 is hydroxyl or an alkali-detachable group.<br>
(C1-C4)-Alkyl groups A and R1 can be straight-chain or branched and is in particular<br>
selected from the group consisting of methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, i-propyl, n-butyl, i-butyl,<br>
sec-butyl and tert-butyl. Preference is given to methyl and ethyl. Substituted C1 to C4<br>
alkyl groups A are in particular carboxyethyl, carboxypropyl, 1,2-dibromoethyl or<br>
chloromethyl. Substituted alkyl radicals A are preferably 2-bromoethenyl or<br>
2-chloroethenyl.<br>
Examples of preferred R2 radicals of the general formula (2) are: 2,4-difluoro-<br>
pyrimidin-6-yl, 4,6-difluoropyrimidin-2-yl, 5-chloro-2,4-difluoropyrimidin-6-yl, 5-chloro-<br>
4,6-difluoropyrimidin-2-yl, 4,5-difluoropyrimidin-6-yl, 5-chloro-4-fluoropyrimidin-6-yl,<br>
2,4,5-trichloropyrimidin-6-yl, 4,5-dichloropyrimidin-6-yl, 2,4-dichloropyrimidin-6-yl, 4-<br>
fluoropyrimidin-6-yl, 4-chloropyrimidin-6-yl.<br>
Particular preference is given to R2 being 2,4-difluoropyrimidin-6-yl or 5-chloro-2,4-<br>
difluoropyrimidin-6-yl.<br>
An example of a preferred R2 radical of the general formula (3) is<br>
2,3-dichloroquinoxaline-6-carbonyl.<br>
Examples of preferred R2 radicals of the general formula (4) are acetyl, n-propionyl<br>
and n-butyryl; particular preference is given to R2 being acetyl.<br>
Examples of preferred R2 radicals of the general formula (5) are 3-chloroethyl-<br>
sulfonylbenzoyl and 2-chloroethylsulfonylpropionyl.<br>
In the foregoing general formulae and also in the subsequent general formulae, the<br>
individual symbols, whether they bear identical or different designations within any<br>
one general formula, can have meanings under their definition which are mutually<br>
identical or different.<br>
The dyes of the general formula (1) can possess different fiber-reactive groups<br>
-SO2Z within the meaning of Z. Examples of alkali-eliminable substituents Z1 in the ß-<br>
position of the ethyl group of Y or Y" are halogen atoms, such as chlorine and<br>
bromine, ester groups of organic carboxylic and sulfonic acids, such as<br>
alkylcarboxylic acids, optionally substituted benzenecarboxylic acids and optionallyi<br>
substituted benzenesulfonic acids, such as the groups alkanoyloxy of 2 to 5 carbon<br>
atoms, of which in particular acetyloxy, benzoyloxy, sulfobenzoyloxy,<br>
phenylsulfonyloxy and tolylsulfonyloxy, further acidic ester groups of inorganic acids,<br><br>
as of phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid and thiosulfuric acid (phosphato, sulfato and <br>
thiosulfato groups), similarly dialkylamino groups having alkyl groups of 1 to 4 carbon<br>
atoms each, such as dimethyiamino and diethylamino.<br>
More particularly, the fiber-reactive groups -SO2Z can be first vinylsulfonyl groups<br>
and secondly groups -CH2CH2Z1, preferably ß-thiosulfatoethyl and especially b-<br>
sulfatoethylsulfonyl groups.<br>
The groups sulfo, carboxyl, include not only their acid form but also their salt form.<br>
Accordingly, sulfo groups are groups conforming to the general formula -SO3M,<br>
carboxyl groups .are groups conforming to the general formula -COOM ,in each of<br>
which M is as defined above.<br>
Preference among the diazo compounds of the general formula (1) is given to those<br>
which conform to the general formula (1a)<br>
where M, R1 and R2 are each as defined above.<br>
The dyes of the general formula (1) according to the invention are preparable for |<br>
example by diazotization of a substituted aromatic amine of the general formula (0)<br>
and coupling onto a substituted aminonaphthol of the general formula (7)<br>
and subsequent diazotization of the resulting aminomonoazo dye of the general<br>
formula (8)<br>
and coupling at a pH of 6 to 9, where appropriate in the presence of a dispersant,<br>
onto the terminal coupling component of the general formula (9)<br>
followed by a subsequent coppering reaction with copper sulfate pentahydrate.<br>
Diazotizable amines having complexing radicals of the general formula (6) are for<br>
example 3-amino-4-hydroxy-5-sulfophenyl b-sulfatoethyl sulfone or 3-amino-4-<br>
hydroxy-5-sulfophenyl vinyl sulfone.<br>
Compounds of the general formula (7) are for example 2-amino-5-<br>
hydroxynaphthalene-7-sulfonic acid, 2-amino-8-hydroxynaphthalene-6-sulfonic acid,<br>
2-amino-5-hydroxynaphthalene-1,7-disulfonic acid and 2-amino-8-<br>
hydroxynaphthalene-3,6-disulfonic acid.<br>
Compounds of the general formula (8) and (9) are for example known from<br>
EP 0 085 378, EP 0 084 849 and can be prepared by common methods.<br>
The separation and isolation, from the aqueous synthesis solutions, of the<br>
compounds of the general formula (1) according to the invention can be effected<br>
according to generally known methods for water-soluble compounds, for example by<br>
precipitating from the reaction medium by means of an electrolyte, such as sodium<br>
chloride or potassium chloride for example, or by evaporating the reaction solution<br>
itself, for example by spray drying. In the latter case, it is frequently advisable first to<br>
precipitate any sulfate in the solutions as calcium sulfate and remove it by filtration.<br>
The dyes of the invention can be present as a preparation in solid or in liquid<br>
(dissolved) form. In solid form, they generally include the electrolyte salts customary<br>
for water-soluble and especially for fiber-reactive dyes, such as sodium chloride,<br>
potassium chloride and sodium sulfate, and may further include the auxiliaries<br>
customary in commercial dyes, such as buffer substances capable of setting a pH in<br>
aqueous solution between 3 and 7, such as sodium acetate, sodium borate, sodium<br>
bicarbonate, sodium dihydrogenphosphate, sodium tricitrate and disodium hydroien-<br>
phosphate, or small amounts of siccatives; if they are present in a liquid, aqueous;<br>
solution (including the presence of thickeners of the type customary in print pastes),<br>
they may also include substances which ensure a long life for these preparations, for<br>
example mold preventatives.<br>
In general, the dyes of the invention are present as dye powders containing 10 to<br>
80% by weight, based on the dye powder or the preparation, of an electrolyte salt<br>
which is also referred to as a standardizing agent. These dye powders may<br>
additionally include the aforementioned buffer substances in a total amount of up to<br>
10% by weight, based on the dye powder. If the dyes of the invention are present in<br>
aqueous solution, the total dye content of these aqueous solutions will be up to<br>
about 50% by weight, for example between 5 and 50% by weight, and the electrolyte<br>
salt content of these aqueous solutions will preferably be below 10% by weight,<br>
based on the aqueous solution; the aqueous solutions (liquid preparations) may<br>
include the aforementioned buffer substances in an amount which is generally up to<br>
10% by weight, preferably up to 2% by weight. <br>
The dyes of the invention have useful application properties. They are used for<br>
dyeing or printing hydroxyl- and/or carboxamido-containing materials, for example in<br>
the form of sheetlike structures, such as paper and leather or of films, for example<br>
composed of polyamide, or in bulk, as for example of polyamide and polyurethane,<br>
but especially for dyeing or printing these materials in fiber form. Similarly, the as-<br>
synthesized solutions of the dyes of the invention, if appropriate after addition of a<br>
buffer substance and if appropriate after concentrating or diluting, can be used<br>
directly as liquid preparation for dyeing.<br>
The present invention thus also relates to the use of the dyes of the invention for<br>
dyeing or printing these materials and to processes for dyeing or printing these<br>
materials in a conventional manner, by using dyes of the invention as a colorant. The<br>
materials are preferably employed in the form of fiber materials, especially in the <br>
form of textile fibers, such as woven fabrics or yarns, as in the form of hanks or<br>
wound packages.<br>
Hydroxyl-containing materials are those of natural or synthetic origin, for example<br>
cellulose fiber materials or their regenerated products and polyvinyl alcohols.<br>
Cellulose fiber materials are preferably cotton, but also other vegetable fibers, such<br>
as linen, hemp, jute and ramie fibers; regenerated cellulose fibers are for example<br>
staple viscose and filament viscose.<br>
Carboxamido-containing materials are for example synthetic and natural polyamides<br>
and polyurethanes, especially in the form of fibers, for example wool and other<br>
animal hairs, silk, leather, nylon-6,6, nylon-6, nylon-11 and nylon-4.<br>
The dyes of the invention can be applied to and fixed on the substrates mentioned,<br>
especially the fiber materials mentioned, by the application techniques known for<br>
water-soluble dyes, especially fiber-reactive dyes.<br>
For instance, on cellulose fibers they produce by the exhaust method from a long<br>
liquor using various acid-binding agents and optionally neutral salts, such as sodium<br>
chloride or sodium sulfate, dyeings having very good washfastnesses. Application is<br>
preferably from an aqueous bath at temperatures between 40 and 105°C, optionally<br>
at a temperature of up to 130°C under superatmospheric pressure, and optionally in<br>
the presence of customary dyeing auxiliaries. One possible procedure is to introduce<br>
the material into the warm bath and to gradually heat the bath to the desired dyeing<br>
temperature and to complete the dyeing process at that temperature. The neutral<br>
salts which accelerate the exhaustion of the dyes may also, if desired, only be added<br>
to the bath after the actual dyeing temperature has been reached.<br>
The padding process likewise provides excellent color yields and very good color<br>
build-up on cellulose fibers, the dyes being allowed to become fixed on the material<br>
by batching at room temperature or at elevated temperature, for example at up to<br>
60°C, by steaming or using dry heat in a conventional manner.<br>
Similarly, the customary printing processes for cellulose fibers, which can be carried<br>
out either single-phase, for example by printing with a print paste comprising sodium<br>
bicarbonate or some other acid-binding agent and by subsequent steaming at 100 to<br>
103°C, or two-phase, for example by printing with a neutral or weakly acidic print<br>
color and subsequent fixation either by passing the printed material through a hot<br>
electrolyte-comprising alkaline bath or by overpadding with an alkaline electrolyte-<br>
comprising padding liquor with subsequent batching of the alkali-overpadded<br>
material or subsequent steaming or subsequent treatment with dry heat, produce<br>
strong prints with well-defined contours and a clear white ground. The appearance of<br>
the prints is not greatly affected by variations in the fixing conditions.<br>
When fixing by means of dry heat in accordance with the customary thermofix<br>
processes, hot air from 120 to 200°C is used. In addition to the customary steam at<br>
101 to 103°C, it is also possible to use superheated steam and high-pressure steam<br>
at temperatures of up to 160°C.<br>
The acid-binding agents which effect the fixation of the dyes of the invention on the<br>
cellulose fibers include for example water-soluble basic salts of the alkali metals and<br>
likewise alkaline earth metals of inorganic or organic acids or compounds which<br>
liberate alkali in the heat. Especially suitable are the alkali metal hydroxides and<br>
alkali metal salts of weak to medium inorganic or organic acids, the preferred alkali<br>
metal compounds being the sodium and potassium compounds. Such acid-binding<br>
agents include for example sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium<br>
carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium formate, sodium<br>
dihydrogenphosphate, disodium hydrogenphosphate, sodium trichloroacetate,<br>
waterglass or trisodium phosphate.<br>
The cellulose dyeings obtained following the customary aftertreatment by rinsing to<br>
remove unfixed dye portions exhibit very good dye properties and provide by the<br>
application and fixing methods customary in the art for fiber-reactive dyes strong<br>
dark blue dyeings and prints having very good fastness properties, especially very<br>
good wash-, light-, alkali-, acid-, water-, seawater-, perspiration- and rubfastnesses,<br>
on the materials mentioned in the description, such as cellulose fiber materials,<br>
especially cotton and viscose. The dyeings are further notable for their high degree<br>
of fixation and good build-up on cellulose materials. Of particular advantage is the<br>
good washfastness of the dyeings, the high fixation value and the low temperature<br>
dependence compared with the prior art.<br>
Furthermore, the dyes of the invention can also be used for the fiber-reactive dyeing<br>
of wool. Moreover, wool which has been given a nonfelting or low-felting finish (cf. for<br>
example H. Rath, Lehrbuch der Textilchemie, Springer-Verlag, 3rd Edition (1972), p.<br>
295-299, especially the finish by the Hercosett process (p. 298); J. Soc. Dyers and<br>
Colourists 1972, 93-99, and 1975, 33-44) can be dyed with very good fastness<br>
properties.<br>
The process of dyeing on wool is here carried out in a conventional manner from an<br>
acidic medium. For instance, acetic acid and/or ammonium sulfate or acetic acid and<br>
ammonium acetate or sodium acetate may be added to the dyebath to obtain the<br>
desired pH. To obtain a dyeing of acceptable levelness, it is advisable to add a<br>
customary leveling agent, for example on the basis of a reaction product of cyanuric<br>
chloride with 3 times the molar amount of an aminobenzenesulfonic acid and/or of an<br>
aminonaphthalenesulfonic acid or on the basis of a reaction product of for example<br>
stearylamine with ethylene oxide. For instance, the dyes of the invention are<br>
preferably subjected to the exhaust process initially from an acidic dyebath having a<br>
pH of about 3.5 to 5.5 under pH control and the pH is then, toward the end of the<br>
dyeing time, shifted into the neutral and optionally weakly alkaline range up to a pH<br>
of 8.5 to bring about, especially for very deep dyeings, the full reactive bond between<br>
the dyes of the invention and the fiber. At the same time, the dye portion not<br>
reactively bound is removed.<br>
The procedure described herein also applies to the production of dyeings on fiber<br>
materials composed of other natural polyamides or of synthetic polyamides and<br>
polyurethanes. In general, the material to be dyed is introduced into the bath at a<br>
temperature of about 40°C, agitated therein for some time, the dyebath is then<br>
adjusted to the desired weakly acidic, preferably weakly acetic acid, pH and the<br>
actual dyeing is carried out at a temperature between 60 and 98°C. However, the<br>
dyeings can also be carried out at the boil or in sealed dyeing apparatus at<br>
temperatures of up to 106°C. Since the water solubility of the dyes of the invention is<br>
very good, they can also be used with advantage in customary continuous dyeing<br>
processes. The dyes of the invention dye the materials mentioned in deep blue<br>
shades.<br>
The examples hereinbelow serve to illustrate the invention. Parts and percentages<br>
are by weight, unless otherwise stated. The compounds described in the examples in<br>
terms of a formula are partly indicated in the form of free acids; in general these<br>
compounds are prepared and isolated in the form of their salts, preferably sodium or<br>
potassium salts, and used for dyeing in the form of their salts. The starting<br>
compounds mentioned in the following examples, especially table examples, can<br>
similarly be used in the synthesis in the form of the free acid or in the form of their<br>
salts, preferably alkali metal salts, such as sodium or potassium salts.<br>
Example 1<br>
377 parts of 4-b-sulfatoethylsulfonyl-2-aminophenol-6-sulfonic acid are diazotized<br>
with sodium nitrite and coupled at pH 6-7 onto 239 parts of 2-amino-5-<br>
hydroxynaphthalene-7-sulfonic acid. This monoazo compound<br>
is diazotized and coupled onto 361 parts of N-acetamino-3,6-disulfo-8-<br>
hydroxynaphthalene<br>
The resultant bisazo dye<br>
is subsequently metallized with 245 parts of copper sulfate pentahydrate. The blue<br>
dye obtained, which conforms to the formula A<br>
(A max. = 587nm)<br>
is salted out with sodium chloride, filtered off and dried at 50°C under reduced<br>
pressure. The dye produces strong dark blue dyeings and prints on cotton which<br>
have very good fastnesses, among which the light-, wash-, water- and<br>
perspirationfastnesses and also the fastness to chlorinated water, solvents, crocking<br>
and hot pressing may be singled out in particular.<br>
The table examples which follow describe further dyes of the general formula (1-A)<br>
according to the invention. The dyes, when applied by the dyeing methods<br>
customary for reactive dyes, provide deep blue dyeings having good all-round<br>
fastnesses on cotton for example.<br>
The process described in example 1 likewise provides the hereinbelow mentioned<br>
compounds of the general formula (I-B). When applied by the dyeing methods<br>
customary for reactive dyes, they provide yellowish to brownish red dyeings having<br>
good all-round fastnesses on cotton for example.<br>
The process described in example 1 likewise provides the hereinbelow mentioned<br>
compounds of the general formula (I-C). When applied by the dyeing methods<br>
customary for reactive dyes, they provide yellowish to brownish red dyeings having<br>
good all-round fastnesses on cotton for example.<br>
