BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Levetiracetain is an antiepileptic drug indicated as adjumctive treatment of partial onset seiswres in adults with epilepsy. The chemical name for levetiracetam, a single enantidmer, is (S)-α-ethyl-2-oxo-l-pyrrolidineacetamide.<br>
British Pat. No. 1,309,692 describes the compound a-ethyi-2-oxo-l-pyrirolidineactamide (melting point 122 degrbes C) and states that compoimds of this type can be used for therapeutic purposes, for example for the treatment of motion sickness, hyperkinesia, hypertonia and epilepsy.<br>
Moreover, it also mentions that these compounds can be applied in the field of memory disorders in normal or pathological conditions.<br>
It is also known that a-ethyl-2-oxo-l-pyrrolidineacetamide possesses a protective activity against aggressions of the central nervous system caused by hypoxias, cerebral ischemia, etc. (Phaimazie, 37/11, (1982), 753-765).<br>
U.S. patent 4,696,943 discloses the levorotatory isomer of a-ethyl-2-oxo-l-pyrrolidineacetamide, which has the absolute S configuration, a method for making the isomer and pharmaceutical compositions containing the same. U.S. patent 4,696,943 discloses that the levorotatory isomer has a 10 times higher protective activity against hypoxia and a 4 times higher protective activity against ischemia compared to the known racemic form.<br><br><br>

The dosages may be conveniently presented in unit dosage form and prepared by any of the methods well-known in the pharmaceutical arts.<br>
Dosage forms include solid dosage forms like tablets, powders, capsules, suppositories, sachets, troches and losenges, as well as liquid syrups, suspensions and elixirs.<br>
The dosage form of the present invention may be a capsule containing the composition, preferably a powdered or granulated solid composition of the invention, within either a hard or soft shell. The shell may be made from gelatin and optionally contain aplasticizer such as glycerin and sorbitol, and an opacifying agent or colorant.<br>
The active ingredient and excipients maybe formulated into compositions and dosage forms according to methods known in the art<br>
A composition for tableting or capsule filling may be prepared by wet granulation. In wet granulation, some or all of the active ingredients and excipients in<br><br>
powder form are blended and then further mixed in the presence of a liquid, typically water, that causes the powders to clump into granules. The granulate is screened and/or milled, dried and then screened and/or milled to the desired particle size. The granulate may then be tableted, or other excipients may be added prior to tableting, such as a glidant and/or a lubricant<br>
A tableting composition may be prepared conventionally by dry blending. For example, the blended composition of the actives and excipients may be compacted into a slug or a sheet and then comminuted into compacted granules. The compacted granules may subsequently be compressed into a tablet.<br>
As an alternative to dry granulation, a blended composition may be compressed directly into a compacted dosage form using direct compression techniques. Direct compression produces a more uniform tablet without granules. Excipients that are particularly well suited for direct compression tableting include microcrystalline cellulose, spray dried lactose, dicalcium phosphate dihydrate and colloidal silica. The proper use of these and other excipients in direct compression tableting is known to those in the art with experience and skill in particular formulation challenges of direct compression tableting.<br>
A capsule filling of the present invention may comprise any of the aforementioned blends and granulates that were described with reference to tableting, however, they are not subjected to a final tableting step.<br>
Having thus described the various aspects of the present invention, the following examples are provided to illustrate specific embodiments of the present invention. They are not intended to be limiting in any way.<br>
EXAMPLES Example 1<br>
PREPARATION OF CRTOE LEVETIRACETAM FROM L-ABA HCL IN<br>
ACN<br>
Anhydrous sodium sulfate 13.6 g (0.096 M) is added to dry acetonitrile (ACN) (96 ml) under vigorous stirring at 3-5 degrees C. and under a nitrogen blanket. (S&gt;2-amino-butanamide hydrochloride (L-ABA HC1) 1 l.OSg (0.08 M) is added. The mixture is stirred at 3-5 degrees C. for 30 minutes. Powdered KOH 17.23 g (0.28 M)<br><br>
is added. 4-chlorobutyryl chloride 12.41g (0.08SM) in 39 ml dry acetonitrile is added drop-wise over a period of about 30 minutes, while the temperature is kept under 5 degrees C. The reaction mixture is stirred while the temperature is kept under 5 degrees C for a further 5 hrs. The insoluble matter is filtered off and washed with acetonitrile (15 ml). The filtrate and washing are evaporated in vacuo at 35-40 degrees C. The residue is recrystallized from 50 ml ethyl-acetate to give 9.6 g (Yield=70 %) of product displaying 99 % purity (crude product) by capillary GC; 99.65% L-isomer and 0.35 % D-isomer (D-Levetiracetam) by dextrine based chiral capillary GC.<br>
The amount of D-isomer was determined as follows: Column: BetaDex325 capillary column 30m x 0.25mm+0.25micron thickness. Oven: 160 degrees C.; Carry gas: nitrogen, flow Iml/min,; Detector FID, 230 degrees C.; Injection: split 150:1, 210 degrees C.; Sample: 1 microliter of 0.05% levitiracetam solution in methanol; RT of D-isomer: 34.5 min, levitiracetam-33.4 min.<br>
Example 2<br>
PREPARATION OF CRUDE LEVETIRACETAM FROM L-ABA HCL IN ACN USING A DRYING AGENT<br>
i<br>
L-ABA HC169.25 g (0.5 M) and powdered KOH 101.25 g (1.8 M) are added'<br>
to a vigorously stirred suspension of powdered molecular sieves in 625 ml acetonitrile under nitrogen. The temperature is kept at about 10 degrees C. A solution of 4-chlorobutyryl chloride 77.5 g (0.5M) in acetonitrile 250 ml is added drop-wise. The temperature is kept under 20 degrees C. After 2 hrs, 1.25 liters of acetonitrile are added and the mixture is stirred for 1 hour and then filtered. The solid is washed with acetonitrile (25ml). The combined filtrate and washes are evaporated in vacuo to yield a semi-solid oil 70 g, which upon crystallization from warm ethyl-acetate (150) ml leads to 60.5.5 g (72 %) of levetiracetam 98.2 % purity (crude product).<br>
Example 3<br>
PREPARATION OF CRUDE LEVETIRACETAM FROM L-ABA HCL IN ACN WITH NEUTRALIZATION<br><br>
Anhydrous sodium sulfate 99.6 g is added with stirring into acetonitrile 700 ml under a nitrogen blanket. The temperature is set and maintained at 3-5 degrees during the reaction.<br>
L-ABA HC169.25 g (0.5 M), followed by 124 g ground KOH are then introduced into the above mixed suspension. 4-chlorobutyryl chloride 77.6 g (0.55 M.) is added at a rate sufficient to keep the temperature at 3-5 degrees C. The reaction mixture is kept for 5 hrs under these conditions. The mixture is then neutralized with care to about pH 6 using concentrated HC1 (32%). The mixture is filtered and washed twice with acetonitrile (total 400 ml). The filtrate and washes are combined and concentrated to a 500 ml solution which is filtered. Upon cooling, crude levetiracetam crystallizes displaying about 99 % purity (HPLC). Recrystallization from warm ethyl acetate leads to 72 g (84 %) of pure levetiracetam, displaying &gt;99.5% isomeric purity by cbiral capillary GC.<br>
Example 4<br>
PREPARATION OF CRUDE LEVETIRACETAM FROM L-ABA HC1 IN MTBE<br>
6.92 g (0.05 M) L-ABA HCL and 10.12 g (0.18 M) ground KOH and 7.53 g (0.053M) of NaS04 are mixed vigorously in 62 ml methyl tert butyl ether (MTBE). The temperature is kept at 5 degrees C. A solution of 7.75 g (0.05 M) of 4-chlorobutyryl chloride (CBC) is added drop-wise. After 3 hours, the mixture is allowed to return to room temperature during 1 hour. The reaction mix is filtered and the solid is washed with a total of 87 ml MTBE to give a crude solid 6.5 g containing levetiracetam having a purity of 76% as per HPLC.<br>
Example 5<br>
PREPARATION OF (S)-N-[l-(aminocarbonyl)propyI]-4-chlorobutanamide (CBA) FROM ABA BASE IN MTBE<br>
5.1 g (0.05 M) of ABA base and 9.75 g (0.1 M) of 2-hydroxypyridine are mixed vigorously in 60 ml of MTBE at 0-5 degrees C. A solution of 8.45 g (0.06 M) of CBC in 25 ml MTBE is added drop-wise over 30 minutes. The reaction is nearly completed after 2 hours but was left overnight for 17 hours. The reaction mix is filtered and the solid washed with 15 ml acetonitrile. The combined extracts are<br><br>
evaporated to a crude solid residue of 13 g which contains CBA having a purity of 91 % as perHPLC. Example 6<br>
PREPARATION OF LEVETZRACETAM FROM CBA IN THE PRESENCE OF KI IN MTBE<br>
6.2 g (0.03 M) of CBA 2.5 g of ground KOH and 0.33 g (0.002 M) KI catalyst are stirred in MTBE vigorously at room temperature. After 4 hours, the mixture is filtered and the solid is washed twice with hot ethyl acetate. HPLC of the crude mixture indicates a purity of 95.9 % of levetiracetam.<br>
Example 7 (Comparative Example)<br>

Experimental procedure:<br>
A 100 ml flask is charged with 3 g. levetiracetam and the selected solvent is added in portions at about 40 degrees C, under stirring. The co-solvent is then added in portions until the solution is turbid. The suspension is left to cool under stirring to room temperature for 5 hours and left at 4 degrees C. for a further 16 hours. The<br><br>
crystalline material is filtered on buchner. The material is dried at 40-45 degrees C. Under 100mm vacuum.<br>
Example 10<br>
PREPARATION OF LEVETIRACETAM FROM L-ABA HCL IN ACN USING A DRYING AGENT<br>
27.7 g (0.2 M ) ABA HCl is added to 80 g (0.56 M) powdered K2CO3 in 500 ml ACN and the mixture is stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes and then cooled to<br>
about 0 degrees Celsius. A solution of 4-chlorobutyryl chloride, 31 g(0.22 M) in<br>
100 ml of ACN is added to the mixture over a period of ahout 1 hour while the<br>
temperature is kept at between about 0-3 degrees Celsius. The reaction mixture is<br>
brought to room temperature and stirred for 2 hours. The temperature of the reaction<br>
mixture is raised to 30 degrees Celsius and 8.4 g (0.21 M) sodium hydroxide is added. After 90 minutes, another charge of 8.4 g sodium hydroxide is introduced and the mixture is stirred at 30 degrees Celsius for another 150 minutes. The suspension is filtered and the solid is washed with 0.25 liters of ACN. The filtrate and washes are combined and evaporated in vacuo to a solid which is crystallized from about 80 ml of hot. ACN leading to a crude 26 gLevetiracetam (77 % purity). Recrystallization of the cmde levetiracetam from 170 ml hot ethylacetate gives 23.5 g of the final product.<br><br><br><br>
