				<td>The invention relates to a slide bar closure for a cabinet door<br>
pivotally mounted on a switchgear cabinet body, having a locking<br>
mechanism which includes an actuating member which can be set in the<br>
direction of rotation and is connected to a slide-in unit, the slide-in unit<br>
having an adjusting member, which is spaced from the axis of rotation of<br>
the actuating member transversely relative to the slide-in direction and is<br>
drivable by means of the actuating member.	<br>
Such a slide bar closure is known from DE 90 10 175 U1 In such case, a locking mechanism in the form of a transmission housing is placed on the inner side of a cabinet door. Rotatably accommodated in the transmission housing there is a pinion, which can be rotated with a handle. A slide-in unit is also guided in the transmission housing. It is formed by two toothed rods, which lie diametrically opposite each other with their toothings, and both mesh with the pinion. Slide bars, which serve to lock the cabinet door, are connected to the toothed rods. When the handle disposed on the front side of the cabinet door is rotated, the toothed rods are displaced in opposite directions. Rotation in a clockwise direction opens the cabinet door, and rotation in an anti-clockwise direction closes the cabinet door. By changing the type of stop means for the cabinet door, the door is rotated through 180°. However, the rotational direction of the handle is also changed thereby (rotation in a clockwise direction now effects closure). This, however, is not desirable for reasons of operational comfort.<br>
To overcome this disadvantage it is proposed, in EP 0 261 266 B1, to reconstruct both the handle and the locking mechanism when the type of stop means is changed. With this restructuring, the rotational direction can then be maintained. However, great expense is necessary to effect such a measure. Moreover, it is often necessary, because of space conditions, to be able to turn the handle selectively in a clockwise or anti-clockwise direction for locking, with the aforementioned type of stop means for the cabinet door. For such purpose, however, provision is made for two different closures to be used.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a slide bar closure of the initially mentioned type, which can be used for different requirements and has a high degree of operational comfort.<br>
This object of the invention is achieved, in that the adjusting member can be associated with the actuating member in various fitting positions, the slide-in direction of the slide-in unit being maintained in the changed fitting positions, but the direction of rotation of the actuating member being changed, and/or the slide-in direction of the slide-in unit being changed in the changed fitting positions, but the direction of rotation of the actuating member being maintained.<br>
According to the invention, a fitting is provided with the slide bar closure which permits the closed positions to be varied, as a result of simple restructuring measures. Depending on the association between the adjusting member and the actuating member, the slide-in direction of the slide-in unit and the rotational direction of the actuating member can be set independently of each other.<br>
A space-saving construction method is possible when provision is made for the slide-in unit to have a plate-like configuration and to be fitted in a flat manner on the front side of the cabinet door. More especially, the<br>
rear side of the cabinet door is kept free of components of the slide bar closure, whereby restricted space conditions, more especially in the edge region of the cabinet door, can be taken into account.<br>
A possible variation of the invention is characterised in that the actuating member is configured as a pinion, the teeth of which co-operate with the adjusting member, which is configured as a toothing.<br>
In such case, it can, more especially, be provided that, when viewed with respect to the slide-in direction, the toothed rod-like adjusting member can be selectively brought into engagement with the pinion on the left side or on the right side.<br>
It is also conceivable that, when viewed transversely relative to the slide-in direction, the part of the toothed rod-like adjusting member effecting the advancing movement is selectively disposed on the left side or on the right side of the pinion. With these simple measures, the rotational direction of the actuating member or respectively the slide-in direction of the slide-in unit can be set.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, it is provided that the slide-in unit is provided with a cutaway portion, in which the actuating member is accommodated, in that the slide-in unit is connected to a slide bar of the locking mechanism, and in that the mounting locations, where the slide-in unit is connected to the slide bar, and the centre of rotation of the mounting member* are disposed in a line extending in the slide-in direction. As a result of this symmetrical configuration, the slide-<br>
* Translator's note<br>
Perhaps the German word "Befestigungsglied" is a clerical error for "Betatigungsglied" (actuating member) here, to be consistent with the corresponding claim 6.<br>
in unit can be associated with, the actuating member in various fitting positions.<br>
A simple structure can be achieved with few parts when it is provided that the slide-in unit is retained with* a housing so as to be displaceable in the slide-in direction, that the housing rotatably supports a rotational body, and that the actuating member is non-rotatably retained on the rotational body.<br>
In such case, it is conceivable that the housing, the slide-in unit, the rotational body and the actuating member are combined to form a pre-assembled structural unit, which is securable on the cabinet door, and that the slide-in unit is attachable to the slide bar of the locking mechanism via connecting members.<br>
It is preferable for the slide,-in unit to be disposed on the front side of the cabinet door, and for the slide bar to be disposed on the rear side of the cabinet door. The slide-in unit is then operationally connected to the slide bar through an opening in the cabinet door.<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a slide bar closure for a.cabinet door pivotally mounted on a switchgear cabinet body, having a locking mechanism which comprises an actuating member which can be set in the direction of rotation and is connected to a slide-in unit, the slide-in unit having an adjusting member, which is spaced from the axis of rotation of the actuating member transversely relative to the slide-in direction and is drivable by means of the actuating member, characterized in that the adjusting member can be associated with the actuating member in various fitting positions, the slide-in .direction of the slide-in unit being maintained in the changed fitting positions, but the direction of rotation of the actuating member being changed or the slide-in direction of the slide-in unit being changed in the changed fitting positions, but the direction of rotation of the actuating member being maintained.<br>
The invention is explained more fully hereinafter with reference to embodiments illustrated in the drawings. In the drawings:<br>
Fig. 1 is an exploded perspective view of a slide bar closure; and<br>
Figs; 2A to 2D illustrate various fitting positions for the slide bar closure on a cabinet door.<br>
A slide bar closure according to the invention is shown more fully in Fig. 1, This slide bar closure can be secured to the front side of a cabinet door 60. The cabinet door 60 comprises a fiat door leaf 61, which is provided with chamfers 62 on its edge. In the chamfered region, a slide<br>
* Translator's note<br>
Perhaps the German word "mit" is a clerical error for the word "in" here,<br>
to be consistent with the corresponding claim 7.<br>
bar 63 can be attached internally to the cabinet door. The slide bar is configured as an angle plate and abuts against the door leaf 61 and the chamfer 62.<br>
The slide bar closure comprises a housing 10, which is provided with a receiver 13. The receiver 13 is incorporated as a rectangular recess in the region of the housing facing the door leaf 61. Access to the receiver 13 from the front side of the housing 10 is provided by a mounting 11, which is in the form of a bore. The bore axis in such case extends perpendicularly relative to the door leaf 61. A rotational body 30 may be mounted in the mounting 11. For such purpose, the rotational body 30 has a cylindrical bearing pin 31. A plug-in extension 32 is connected to the bearing pin 31. Plug-in extension 32 has two diametrically opposed recesses 33. An actuating member 40 can be secured thereto by means of extensions 41. The actuating member 40 is mainly configured as a pinion. It has a central plug-in receiver, by means of which it can be slipped over the plug-in extension 32. In order to secure the pinion, a threaded receiver 34 is incorporated in the end face of the plug-in extension 32.<br>
A slide-in unit 20 can be inserted into the receiver 13 of the housing 10. The slide-in unit 20 has a plate-like configuration. In respect of its width, it is configured to be adapted to the width of the receiver 13. However, the length of the slide-in unit 20 extending in the vertical direction is selected to be less than the length of the receiver 13. The slide-in unit 20 can therefore be displaced linearly in the housing 10. Connecting members 22 are secured to the slide-in unit 20. The connecting members 22 are configured as threaded bushes, which project beyond the front end of the slide-in unit 20. The slide-in unit 20 is provided centrally with a cutaway portion 21. This cutaway portion 21 is defined on one side by an adjusting member 23. The adjusting member 23<br>
is moulded integrally on the slide-in unit 20 as a toothed rod. When the slide-in unit 20 is inserted, the toothing of the adjusting member 23 meshes with the toothing of the actuating member 40. A holder 50 is used to secure the slide-in unit 20, the rotational body 30 and the actuating member 40. The holder 50 has a base plate 51, from which four locking extensions 53 are bent, in a claw-like manner, in the direction of the housing 10. The holder 50 can be locked in position on locking receivers 12 of the housing 10 with the locking extensions 53. In consequence, the housing 10, the slide-in unit 20, the rotational body 30, the actuating member 40 and the holder 50 form a structural unit, which is pre-assembled. The holder 50 is provided with a bearing sleeve 54. This bearing sleeve terminally accommodates the plug-in extension 32 of the rotational body 30. A bilateral mounting of the rotational body 30 is achieved with the bearing sleeve 54 and the mounting 11.<br>
For securing the housing 10 to the cabinet door, the door leaf 61 is provided with bores 64. The bores 64 are in alignment with threaded receivers 14 of the housing 10. The bore 64 is configured as a sinkhole bore, so that a corresponding screw 66 can be accommodated flush with the surface of the door leaf 61. The slide bar 63 is provided with a corresponding opening, so that the screw 66 can be inserted into the bore 64 and screwed into the thread 14. Because the screw 66 is accommodated in a countersunk manner relative to the surface of the door leaf 61, the slide bar 63 can be displaced unhindered on the door leaf 61. For connecting the slide bar 63 to the slide-in unit 20, bores 65 are incorporated in the slide bar 63. These bores are in alignment with the connecting members 22, which are provided with corresponding threads. The slide-in unit 20 can be screw-connected to the slide bar 63 by means of screws 67 via the bores 65.<br>
The rotational body 30 is accessible from the front side of the housing 10. It serves to accommodate a key or a handle. As a result of rotating this key or the handle, the rotational body 30 is rotated. The actuating member 40 also rotates with the rotational body 30. The actuating member 40 displaces the slide bar 20 as a result of the engagement in the adjusting member 23. Because the slide-in unit 20 communicates with the slide bar 63 via the connecting members 22, a displacement of the slide bar 63 in the vertical direction is effected by the adjustment of the adjusting member 23.<br>
Various fitting positions, in which the actuating member 40 is associated with the adjusting member 23, are illustrated in Figs. 2A to 2D. In these drawings, an internal view of the cabinet door 60 is schematically illustrated, showing the slide bar closure greatly enlarged. Hinges 68, with which a hinge-connection can be made with a switchgear cabinet body or the like, are disposed on the right of the cabinet door.<br>
In Fig. 2A, the adjusting member 23 is situated transversely relative to the closing direction (slide-in direction of the slide-in unit 20) on the left of the actuating member 40. The part of the toothed rod-like adjusting member effecting the advancing movement is disposed on the right of the actuating member 40 when viewed with respect to the slide-in direction. With this configuration, a displacement of the slide-in unit 20 vertically downwardly is effected when the rotational body 30 and, hence, the actuating member 40 are rotated in an anti-clockwise direction. When the rotational direction of the actuating member 40 is now to be changed, the slide-in unit 20 only needs to be rotated so that the adjusting member 23 is disposed on the right of the actuating member 40 when viewed transversely relative to the slide-in direction of the slide-in unit 20. This fitting position is illustrated in Fig. 2B. In such a configuration, the closing<br>
direction is maintained downwardly when the actuating member 40 is rotated in a clockwise direction.<br>
Figs. 2C and 2D show fitting positions in which the closing direction is orientated upwardly. In such case, the part of the toothed rod-like adjusting member effecting the advancing movement is disposed on the left of the actuating member 40 when viewed with respect to the slide-in direction. When viewed transversely relative to the slide-in direction, the adjusting member 23 is also fitted on the left of the actuating member 40. With this fitting position, the closing direction is effected upwardly when the actuating member 40 is rotated in a clockwise direction. By displacing the position of the slide-in unit 20 through 180°, the direction of rotation of the actuating member can be reversed (see Fig. 2D).    <br><br><br><br>
