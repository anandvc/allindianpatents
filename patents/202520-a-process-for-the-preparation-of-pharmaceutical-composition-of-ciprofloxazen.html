				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of pharmaceutical composition in the form of controlled release once a day formulation particularly with the drug ciprofloxacin . The pharmaceutical form of the present invention is designed for controlled release of the active ingredients that exhibit a small absorption window in the first portion of the gastrointestinal tract, i.e. in the stomach or the upper part of the small intestine.<br>
The instant patent application has been divided out of Indian patent application No. 723/CAL/2001<br>
A controlled release dosage form is one that delivers the physiologically active substance in a planned, predictable and slower than normal manner for longer period of time at a predetermined rate and thus reduces the drug plasma fluctuations commonly observed when multiple doses of immediate release conventional dosage forms are administered to a patient. The most common types of controlled release products are oral dosage forms. These products normally proceed for a 12 or 24 hour dosing interval. Dosing intervals for oral controlled release products beyond once a day dosing are limited by physiological characteristics of human gastrointestinal tract.<br>
There are various methods of developing molecules for traditional oral drug delivery system. Kariji Takada (Encyclopedia of control drug delivery vol.2,<br><br>
pp. 729), describes a detail list of various mechanisms, which are used for the gastro-retentive drug delivery system.<br>
A variety of oral controlled release drug delivery systems based on different release mechanism have been reported, for example, dissolution controlled systems, diffusion controlled systems, osmotically engineered systems, ion exchange resin erodible matrix system, etc.<br>
Per-oral administration is the route of choice for controlled release formulations due to obvious reasons. Controlled release administration forms described above are utilizable for drug absorbed effectively all through the gastrointestinal tract. These systems are not suitable for many drugs either due to their physicochemical properties or adaptation of carrier mediated transport, active transport or other specific transport mechanisms for effective absorption. These drugs are known to have so called "absorption window". The term "absorption window" states the fact that a drug will be absorbed from a limited region of gastrointestinal tract upon per oral administration of a drug or drug preparation. Most, if not all drugs usually pass from stomach to small intestine in an actually short time period, generally one to two hours. This fact often creates a need of frequent dosing of the agent in order to maintain desired plasma concentration. Such drugs, if formulated according to conventional controlled release systems mentioned in prior art, will not achieve their optimum therapeutic level to guarantee a long-term action. Furthermore, an important factor that restricts one to adopt prior art is that for majority of drugs, absorption from colon is usually erratic and incomplete. Thus controlled release system briefly mentioned above cannot be explored successfully for some specific categories like antibiotics e.g. cefuroxime axitel, which is well absorbed till the distal part of small intestine, but drug released in colon will be consumed by<br><br>
local bacteria and accidentally may lead to ailments like ulcerative colitis and drug resistance.<br>
It has been found difficult to alter transfer time of active agent through small intestine, although some emphasis has been given on attempting to control transit time of administration form in stomach. Drais et.al (Int. J. Pharm. 21,331-340, 1984) reported that gastrointestinal transit time of a pharmaceutical dosage form depends upon several factors as shape, size and nature of formulation and physiological condition of the stomach. Physiological behavior of the stomach is usually determined by whether it contains food or is empty. As the stomach undergoes contractions it breaks down the digestive materials to 2 mm or less before they pass through the pylorus into duodenum and non-digestive material is retropropelled into main part of stomach for further digestions. Non-digestive material is not generally able to leave the stomach in the fed state. At the end of digestive period retention of non-digestive material is further complicated by the ability of gastrointestinal tract to undergo powerful contractions called inter-digestive myoelectric motor complex or IMMC. IMMC's "housekeeper wave" (PHASE HI activity) tends to sweep non-digestive materials from stomach into duodenum. Consequently a need exists for a controlled release device that not only can deliver the drug for extended period of time but also can retain itself in stomach for a significantly longer period, whether in fed or fasted state.<br>
Shell et al (WO 097/47285), claims an extended release delivery systems for gastric retention that includes a water swellable particulate matrix impregnated with the drug combined with a chemical agent such as serotonin receptor antagonists, fatty acids and/or salts thereof and tryptophan that pharmacologically induces the fed mode in patient's stomach. It is self evident that these fed mode inducing substances specially 5 HT antagonists are all therapeutically active substances and will give their undesirable pharmacological<br><br>
response like nausea, vomiting, insomnia etc. on long-term therapy with dosage forms containing them.<br>
Talwar et al (US 6,261,601) discloses an orally effective controlled gas powered system providing temporal and spatial control. This multicomponent system comprises a drug, a swelling agent, a viscolyzing agent, a gas generating component and optionally a gelling polymer. The extent of drug loading is 69.9%w/w of ciprofloxacin base . The tablets were prepared by the steps of mixing, roll compaction, sieving, blending with the lubricants and compression into tablets.<br>
Indian patent 186250 describes a process for the preparation of tablet or capsule containing a drug, sodium alginate, xanthun gum, sodium bicarbonate and cross-linked poly vinyl pyrollidone. It was evident from the example stated by the author for dry granulation using roll compactor that the said drug as such is not suitable for tablet making. The method used in said patent as described is dry blending and roll compaction whereas the most preferred method of granulation is wet granulation. The granules obtained by wet granulation have better properties for the tableting behavior. Use of roll compaction is a lengthier process and adopted as a last option compared to wet granulation, which is capable of producing a large batch size in a limited period of time. The formula mentioned in this patent contains a quantity of the active pharmaceutical ingredient upto 69.9 % w/w that gives the tablet of 1000 mg drug of a very big size that may cause difficulty in swallowing.<br>
United States patent US 2001/0018070A1 discloses the use of polyethylene oxide as an excipient for developing a formulation that extends the<br><br>
release of the drug in the stomach during the fed mode by swelling to an extent that prevents the dosage form from passing through the pylorus.<br>
The present application uses a novel combination of swelling and floating dosage form of ciprofloxacin using excipients to a minimum.<br>
Drugs  like,  ciprofloxacin being a very low density material  with poor flow properties needs superior granulation in order to achieve better flow and compaction properties.     The  granules  obtained by  wet  granulation  have  better    properties  for tableting.<br>
Wet granulation is the process in which a liquid is added to a powder in a vessel equipped with any type of agitation that will produce agglomeration or granules. The advantages of wet granulation method over dry granulation or compaction are as follows:<br>
1. Drugs having a high dose and poor flow (like in case of ciprofloxacin) will require less binder to impart adequate compressibility and desired flow if wet granulated. In case of dry binding the quantity of binder will be very high to achieve the same properties for the granules.<br>
2.      In wet granulation bulky and dusty powders can be handled without producing a great deal of dust and airborne contamination.<br><br>
3.	Dry granulation can be practiced only by means of compaction .<br>
For wet granulation there are many kind of methods. Moreover, in<br>
dry   granulation   the   lubricants   usually   used   may   deteriorate<br>
disintegration and dissolution performance, tablet hardness and<br>
drug stability.<br>
4.	Granules prepared by dry granulations are generally irregular or<br>
plain, while these can be very many kinds of particle shape for<br>
granules prepared by wet granulation.<br>
5.	In dry granulation and direct compression methods, compressibility<br>
depends on the inherent deformation and cohesive properties of the<br>
active substance and diluents.   In wet granulation, distribution of<br>
binders    over the surface of the granules creates an adhesive<br>
property in the material that makes up for the lack of cohesiveness<br>
in the drugs and the diluents.<br>
The object of the invention is to prepare an improved controlled release oral dosage composition as a once a day formulation for drugs like ciprofloxacin.<br>
Another object of the invention is allowing for incorporation of a higher percentage by weight of the drug in the composition.<br><br>
Still  another  object of the invention  is for allowing for an  oral  dosage  form which is small and convenient for oral administration.<br>
Yet another object of the  invention is to provide a once a  day ciprofloxacin formulation having most optimum release profile when administered.<br>
The present efforts are directed to a process to develop a gastric retentive dosage form with the following unique features.<br>
1)	Compressible to  a size  suitable for per-oral  administration to humans<br>
and also suitable for high dose drugs.<br>
2)	Retained for extended period in stomach due to expansion of dosage<br>
form to a size that will prevent its passage through pylorus.<br>
3)	Entrapped air in hydro gel matrix causes the tablet to float on gastric fluid<br>
thus gastric retention is achieved via dual mechanism.<br>
4)	Provides sustained and controlled release of drug for a period that is more or<br>
less same as retention time of dosage form in stomach.<br>
5)	Monolithic device maintains structural integrity and sh ape memory even in<br>
hydrated state and thus resist the housekeeper wave of IMMC.<br><br>
6)	Releases drug into stomach in solution phase rather than a solid phase<br>
thus avoiding any chance of dose dumping.<br>
7)	Variation in drug release among dosage units is reduced to minimum.<br>
The present invention provides for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition in the form of controlled release once a day formulation comprising ciprofloxacin (78-84% w/w) as active ingredient; an in-situ gas forming agent,such as herein described, capable of producing a non-toxic gas upon contact with the gastric fluid (5-10% w/w); poly (ethylene oxide) (1-6% w/w) as a swellable polymer capable of entrapping the gas so generated and optionally having a fast dissolving film forming coating for tablet formulations and auxiliary pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, such as herein described, wherein the said process comprises the steps of-<br>

Controlled release devices of invention find use in humans or other animals. Additionally, gastro retentive system according to present invention can be used effectively in administration of a drug that can be used in local treatment of ailments like H.Pylori infection.<br>
The composition of the present invention is most suitable for once a day formulation of ciprofloxacin although it can also be used for other drug of similar solubility in the gastric fluid and exhibiting such absorption window.<br>
Ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone and one of the earliest drugs of this group that is widely used. It is effective against most of the common organisms which include gram negative organisms like Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophillus influenzae, Shigella and gram positive organisms like Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcal pyrogenes. One of the aspects in ensuring the effectiveness of any drug therapy is convenience of administration leading to a better compliance.<br>
The present invention provides an improved controlled release oral dosage composition as a once a day formulation wherein said composition comprising a pharmaceutical ingredient or a drug like Ciprofloxacin, an in-situ gas-forming agent capable of producing nontoxic gas upon contact with the gastric content, a highly swellable polymer capable of entrapping the generated gas, and optional fast dissolving film-forming coating with a pharmaceutical excipient.<br>
10<br><br>
The insitu gas generating agent may be selected from, but not limited to sodium bicarbonate, calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, sodium sulfite and the like.<br>
The highly swellable polymer may be selected from poly (ethylene oxide) and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose.<br>
As indicated above the composition according to the present invention may comprise auxiliary excipients such as binder, lubricants and the like.<br>
The suitable binder can be selected from, but not limited to povidone, copolyvidone, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose and the like.<br>
The lubricant can be selected from, but not limited to talc, colloidal silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate and the like.<br>
The ingredients like lactose, talc, titanium dioxide can be used to form coating on the tablet.<br>
It has been further observed by the inventor of the present invention, that most optimum dissolution profile of the drug with release of 20-60% of the drug within first hour, 40-80% of the drug within first two hours and not less than 85% of the drug within eight hours of administration is exhibited when the weight ratio of the rate controlling swellable polymer namely poly ethylene oxide and hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose used in the said formation is kept within certain range, particularly with range of weight ratio of 1 to 6% w/w<br>
11<br><br>
and more preferably 2 to 5% w/w for polyethylene oxide and range of weight ratio of 5 to 12% w/w and more preferably from 7.5 to 12% w/w hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose.<br>
The extent of drug that could be included in the formulation is 78-84% w/w. Thus, the controlled release oral dosage composition of the instant invention made by wet granulation method helps in high drug loading with high percentage by weight of the drug in the composition not achieved by the prior art composition. Further, the oral dosage form is small and convenient for oral administration with a highly satisfactory release profile.<br>
The examples given herein are by way of illustration alone and in no way limit the scope of the invention.<br>

21<br><br>
Conclusion:<br>
The experiments were conducted with high and low quantity of polymer. In order to comply with the in vitro results, the dissolution profile should be well within the range of all the three limits indicated in Table 8. As one or more of the in vitro dissolution results of the experiments i.e. Example 4, Example 5 and Example 6 are outside the limits specified in Table 8, none of them provide a satisfactory release profile for the drug, indicating that the composition mentioned in the invention is very critical for an efficacy of administered drug. Accordingy when Hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) is used as the rate controlling polymer the range of weight ratio of this polymer should preferably be 5 to 12% w/w and most preferably 7.5 to 12% w/w. In case of poly (ethylene oxide) as the rate controlling polymer, the weight ratio of the polymer is preferably 1 to 6% w/w and most preferably 2 to 5% w/w.<br>
Biological activity of the tablets prepared according to the instant invention was studied. Efficacy was further studied and correlated with blood level of the drugs and the areas under plasma concentration vs. time curve as shown in Fig. 1 of the drawing.<br>
Once a day formulation of Ciprofloxacin is designed with a view to achieve the compliance to the treatment without affecting the therapeutic<br>
22<br><br>
efficacy. In a bioavailability study in 12 healthy male volunteers, the drug was administered as one tablet of l000mg in a fed state. The blood samples were drawn for a period of 24 hours and were measured by HPLC method. The mean of AUC (Area Under the Curve) when computed is well above the required MIC (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration) for majority of the organisms. This concentration above MIC is for a period of upto 18 hrs. This duration along with the post antibiotic effect, a known phenomenon of antibiotic effects is adequate to provide an antibiotic cover to the patient for a period of 24 hrs.<br>
The results of this study are as under :-<br><br>
OD : Once a day<br>
Area Under the Curve (AUC) - The integral part of drug blood level over time from zero to infinity and is a measure of quantity of drug absorbed and in the body.<br>
AUC(o-t) - Area under the curve from zero to time t, where t represents the time at which last blood sample was taken.<br>
AUC   - Area under the curve from zero to infinity.<br>
23<br><br>
t½ (Elimination half life of a drug) - The time in hours necessary to reduce the drug concentration in the blood, plasma or serum to ½(half) after equilibrium is reached.<br>
Cmax - The peak plasma concentration achieved after the administration of the<br>
drug.<br>
Tmax - The time to reach peak plasma concentration.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, the curve of the test product according to the invention [OD-l000mg) has serum concentration up to 0.5  gm/ml till 18 hours and above 0.06  gm/ml till 24 hours. These values cover most of the microorganisms for a period enough to extend post-antibiotic effect i.e. letting the body's defense cells take care of reduced bacterial load. Thus, the formulation according to the instant invention indicates that it is suitable as once a day formulation.<br>
