				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel therapeutic and diagnostic systems. More<br>
particularly, the present invention is directed to dendrimer based multifunctional<br>
compositions and systems for use in disease diagnosis and therapy (e.g., cancer diagnosis<br>
and therapy). The compositions and systems generally comprise two or more separate<br>
components for targeting, imaging, sensing, and/or triggering release of a therapeutic or<br>
diagnostic material and monitoring the response to therapy of a cell or tissue (e.g., a<br>
tumor).<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
New initiatives in chemotherapeutics and radiopharmaceutics have improved the<br>
survival of patients with many forms of neoplasm. Several cancers now have five year<br>
survival rates greater than 80 percent. However, despite these successes, many problems<br>
still exist concerning cancer therapy. For example, many common neoplasms, such as<br>
colon cancer, respond poorly to available therapies.<br>
For tumor types that are responsive to current methods, only a fraction of cancers<br>
respond well to the therapies. In addition, despite the improvements in therapy for many<br>
cancers, most currently used therapeutic agents have severe side effects. These side<br>
effects often limit the usefulness of chemotherapeutic agents and result in a significant<br>
portion of cancer patients without any therapeutic options. Other types of therapeutic<br>
initiatives, such as gene therapy or immunotherapy, may prove to be more specific and<br>
have fewer side effects than chemotherapy. However, while showing some progress in a<br>
few clinical trials, the practical use of these approaches remains somewhat limited at this<br>
time.<br>
Despite the limited success of existing therapies, the understanding of the<br>
underlying biology of neoplastic cells has advanced. The cellular events involved in<br>
neoplastic transformation and altered cell growth are now identified and the multiple<br>
steps in carcinogenesis of several human tumors have been documented (See e.g., Isaacs,<br>
Cancer 70:1810 [1992]). Oncogenes that cause unregulated cell growth have been<br>
identified and characterized as to genetic origin and function. Specific pathways that<br>
regulate the cell replication cycle have been characterized in detail and the proteins<br>
involved in this regulation have been cloned and characterized. Also, molecules that<br>
mediate apoptosis and negatively regulate cell growth have been clarified in detail (Kerr<br>
et al., Cancer 73:2013 [1994]). It has now been demonstrated that manipulation of these<br>
cell regulatory pathways has been able to stop growth and induce apoptosis in neoplastic<br>
cells (See e.g., Cohen and Tohoku, Exp. Med., 168:351 [1992] and Fujiwara et al., J.<br>
Natl. Cancer Inst., 86:458 [1994]). The metabolic pathways that control cell growth and<br>
replication in neoplastic cells are important therapeutic targets.<br>
Despite these impressive accomplishments, many obstacles still exist before these<br>
therapies can be used to treat cancer cells in vivo. For example, these therapies require<br>
the identification of specific pathophysiologic changes in an individual's particular tumor<br>
cells. This requires mechanical invasion (biopsy) of a tumor and diagnosis typically by in<br>
vitro cell culture and testing. The tumor phenotype then has to be analyzed before a<br>
therapy can be selected and implemented. Such steps are time consuming, complex, and<br>
expensive.<br>
There is a need for treatment methods that are selective for tumor cells compared<br>
to normal cells. Current therapies are only relatively specific for tumor cells. Although<br>
tumor targeting addresses this selectivity issue, it is not adequate, as most tumors do not<br>
have unique antigens. Further, the therapy ideally should have several., different<br>
mechanisms of action that work in parallel to prevent the selection of resistant<br>
neoplasms, and should be releasable by the physician after verification of the location<br>
and type of tumor. Finally, the therapy ideally should allow the physician to identify<br>
residual or minimal disease before and immediately after treatment, and to monitor the<br>
response to therapy. This is crucial since a few remaining cells may result in re-growth,<br>
or worse, lead to a tumor that is resistant to therapy. Identifying residual disease at the<br>
end of therapy (i.e., rather than after tumor regrowm) would facilitate eradication of the<br>
few remaining tumor cells.<br>
Thus, an ideal therapy should have the ability to target a tumor, image the extent<br>
of the tumor and identify the presence of the therapeutic agent in the tumor cells. It<br>
ideally allows the physician to determine why cells transformed to a neoplasm, to select<br>
therapeutic molecules based on the pathophysiologic abnormalities in the tumor cells, to<br>
activate the therapeutic agents only in abnormal cells, to document the response to the<br>
therapy, and to identify residual disease.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel therapeutic and diagnostic systems. More<br>
particularly, the present invention is directed to dendrimer based multifunctional<br>
compositions and systems for use in disease diagnosis and therapy (e.g., cancer diagnosis<br>
and therapy). The compositions and systems generally comprise two or more distinct<br>
components for targeting, imaging, sensing, and/or triggering release of a therapeutic or<br>
diagnostic material and monitoring the response to therapy of a cell or tissue (e.g., a<br>
tumor).<br>
For example, the present invention provides a composition comprising a<br>
dendrimer complex, said dendrimer complex comprising first and second dendrimers, the<br>
first dendrimer comprising a first agent and the second dendrimer comprising a second<br>
agent, wherein the first agent is different than the second agent. In preferred<br>
embodiments, the first and said second agents are selected from the group consisting of<br>
therapeutic agents, biological monitoring agents, biological imaging agents, targeting<br>
agents, and agents capable of identifying a specific signature of cellular abnormality. In<br>
some embodiments, the first dendrimer is covalently linked to the second dendrimer. In<br>
certain embodiments, the dendrimer complex includes additional dendrimers. For<br>
example, in some embodiments, the complex comprises a third dendrimer (e.g, a<br>
third-dendrimer covalently linked to the first and second dendrimers). In yet other<br>
embodiments, the dendrimer complex comprises fourth, fifth, or additional dendrimers.<br>
Each of the dendrimers may comprise an agent<br>
In some embodiments, the present invention provides a composition comprising:<br>
a first dendrimer comprising a first agent; and a second dendrimer comprising a second<br>
agent, wherein the first and second dendrimers are complexed (e.g., covalently attached)<br>

agents capable of imaging biological materials or events), targeting agents (i.e., agents<br>
capable of targeting a biological material--i. e., specifically interacting with the biological<br>
material), and agents capable of identifying a specific signature of cellular identity (i.e.,<br>
capable of identifying a characteristic of a cell that helps differentiate the cell from other<br>
cell types—e.g., a cellular proteins specific for a particular cellular abnormality). The<br>

GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel therapeutic and diagnostic complexes.<br>
More particularly, the present invention is directed to dendrimer-based multifunctional<br>
compositions and systems for use in disease diagnosis and therapy (e.g., cancer diagnosis<br>
and therapy). The compositions and systems generally comprise two or more separate<br>
components for targeting, imaging, sensing, and/or triggering release of a therapeutic or<br>
diagnostic material and monitoring the response to therapy of a cell or tissue (e.g., a<br>
tumor).<br>
For example, the present invention provides nanodevices comprising two or more<br>
dendrimers, each complexed with one or more components for targeting, imaging,<br>
sensing, and/or triggering release of a therapeutic or diagnostic material and monitoring<br>
the response to therapy of a cell or tissue. In some embodiments of the present<br>
invention, the nanodevice comprises a core dendrimer complexed (e.g., covalently linked)<br>
to other dendrimer subunits containing the above functionalities. The present invention<br>
demonstrates that such compositions are non-toxic and present new methods for treating,<br>
detecting, and monitoring various physiological conditions. For example, in some<br>
embodiments, the nanodevices contain a dendrimer subunit that targets the nanodevice to<br>
particular cells or tissues {e.g., contains binding agents that recognize and are specific<br>
cellular components). In other embodiments, the nanodevices contain a dendrimer<br>
subunit that images a cell, a cellular component, or cellular reactions (e.g., provides a<br>
detectable signal upon exposure to the cell, component, or reaction). In yet other<br>
embodiments, the nanodevices contain a dendrimer subunit that provides a signature<br>
identifying agent such that, directly or indirectly, the presence of a cell or cellular<br>
condition is identified (e.g., identifying a cancer cell through interaction of the signature<br>
identifying agent with a cancer-specific factor). In still further embodiments, the<br>
nanodevices contain a dendrimer subunit that provides a therapeutic or diagnostic agent<br>
for delivery or release into a cell or subject<br>
Thus, the present invention provides a variety of useful therapeutic and diagnostic<br>
compositions for treating and characterizing cells or subjects with various pathologies or<br>
physiological conditions. The nanodevices of the present invention comprises any<br>
number of dendrimer components to give the desired functionality. For example, in<br>
cancer therapy, the present invention provides nanodevices that comprise a core<br>
dendrimer covalently linked to individual dendrimer units comprising signature<br>
identifying agents, imaging agents, therapeutic agents, targeting agents, and monitoring<br>
agents, respectively. For example, for breast cancer {See e.g., Figure 3 showing<br>
complexes for use in breast and colon cancer; and Figure 4 as described above), the core<br>
dendrimer is complexed with a first dendrimer comprising a gadolinium contrast agent<br>
for imaging the tissue by MRI, a second dendrimer comprising a therapeutic agent {e.g.,<br>
Taxol or cisplatin) for treating the cancer, a third dendrimer comprising a ligand for<br>
binding to a folate receptor for targeting the cancer cells, a fourth dendrimer comprising<br>
a fluorogenic component for detecting mutated p53 protein for identifying the cancer<br>
signature, and a fifth dendrimer comprising a fluorogenic marker of apoptosis to monitor<br>
treatment with the therapeutic agent. In some embodiments, the core dendrimer<br>
comprises any of the desired components. In yet other embodiments, two or more of the<br>
functionalities are provided on a single dendrimer.<br>
In preferred embodiments, of the present invention, libraries of individual<br>
dendrimers comprising the above functionalities are created for use in generating any<br>
desired nanodevice complexes. For example, libraries of dendrimers each containing one<br>
of a host of therapeutic agents are created. The same procedure is conducted for target<br>
agents, imaging agents, and the like. Such libraries provide the ability to mix-and-match<br>
components to generate the optimum therapeutic or diagnostic complexes for a desired<br>
application. The nanodevices may be generated rationally, or may be generated<br>
randomly and screened for desired activities. Thus, the present invention provides non-<br>
toxic systems with a wide range of therapeutic and diagnostic uses.<br>
Definitions<br>
To facilitate an understanding of the present invention, a number of terms and<br>
phrases are defined below:<br>
As used herein, the term "dendrimer complex" refers to a complex comprising<br>
two or more dendrimers in physical association with one another (e.g., covalent or non-<br>
covalent attachment to one another). For example, two dendrimers covalently linked to<br>
one another (e.g, directly or through a linking group) provide a dendrimer complex.<br>
As used herein, the term "agent" refers to a composition that possesses a<br>
biologically relevant activity or property. Biologically relevant activities are activities<br>
associated with biological reactions or events or that allow the detection, monitoring, or<br>
characterization biological reactions or events. Biologically relevant activities include,<br>
but are not limited to, therapeutic activities (e.g., the ability to improve biological health<br>
or prevent the continued degeneration associated with an undesired biological condition),<br>
targeting activities (e.g., the ability to bind or associate with a biological molecule or<br>
complex), monitoring activities (e.g., the ability to monitor the progress of a biological<br>
event or to monitor changes in a biological composition), imaging activities (e.g., the<br>
ability to observe or otherwise detect biological compositions or reactions), and signature<br>
identifying activities (e.g., the ability to recognize certain cellular compositions or<br>
conditions and produce a detectable response indicative of the presence of the<br>
composition or condition). The agents of the present invention are not limited to these<br>
particular illustrative examples. Indeed any useful agent may be used including agents<br>
that deliver or destroy biological materials, cosmetic agents, and the like. In preferred<br>
embodiments of the present invention, the agent or agents are associated with at least one<br>
dendrimer (e.g., incorporated into the dendrimer, surface exposed on the dendrimer, etc.).<br>
In some embodiments of the present invention, two or more dendrimers are present in a<br>
composition where any one dendrimer may have an agent that "is different than" an agent<br>
of another dendrimer. "Different than" refers to agents that are distinct from one another<br>
in chemical makeup and/or functionality.<br>
As used herein, the term "nanodevice" refers to small (e.g., invisible to the<br>
unaided human eye) compositions containing or associated with one or more "agents." In<br>
its simplest form, the nanodevice consists of a physical composition (e.g., a dendrimer)<br>
associated with at least one agent that provides biological functionality (e.g., a<br>
therapeutic agent). However, the nanodevice may comprise additional components (e.g.,<br>
additional dendrimers and/or agents). In preferred embodiments of the present invention,<br>
the physical composition of the nanodevice comprises at least one dendrimer and a<br>
biological functionality is provided by at least one agent associated with a dendrimer.<br>
The term "biologically active," as used herein, refers to a protein or other<br>
biologically active molecules (e.g., catalytic RNA) having structural., regulatory, or<br>
biochemical functions of a naturally occurring molecule.<br>
The term "agonist," as used herein, refers to a molecule which, when interacting<br>
with an biologically active molecule, causes a change (e.g., enhancement) in the<br>
biologically active molecule, which modulates the activity of the biologically active<br>
molecule. Agonists may include proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, or any other<br>
molecules which bind or interact with biologically active molecules. For example,<br>
agonists can alter the activity of gene transcription by interacting with RNA polymerase<br>
directly or through a transcription factor.<br>
The terms "antagonist" or "inhibitor," as used herein, refer to a molecule which,<br>
when interacting with a biologically active molecule, blocks or modulates the biological<br>
activity of the biologically active molecule. Antagonists and inhibitors may include<br>
proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, or any other molecules that bind or interact with<br>
biologically active molecules. Inhibitors and antagonists can effect the biology of entire<br>
cells, organs, or organisms (e.g., an inhibitor that slows tumor growth).<br>
The term "modulate," as used herein, refers to a change in the biological activity<br>
of a biologically active molecule. Modulation can be an increase or a decrease in<br>
activity, a change in binding characteristics, or any other change in the biological.,<br>
functional., or immunological properties of biologically active molecules.<br>
The term "gene" refers to a nucleic acid (e.g., DNA) sequence that comprises<br>
coding sequences necessary for the production of a polypeptide or precursor. The<br>
polypeptide can be encoded by a full length coding sequence or by any portion of the<br>
coding sequence so long as the desired activity or functional properties (e.g., enzymatic<br>
activity, ligand binding, signal transduction, etc.) of the full-length or fragment are<br>
retained. The term also encompasses the coding region of a structural gene and the<br>
including sequences located adjacent to the coding region on both the 5' and 3' ends for<br>
a distance of about 1 kb or more on either end such that the gene corresponds to the<br>
length of the full-length mRNA. The sequences that are located 5' of the coding region<br>
and which are present on the mRNA are referred to as 5' non-translated sequences. The<br>
sequences that are located 3' or downstream of the coding region and which are present<br>
on the mRNA are referred to as 3' non-translated sequences. The term "gene"<br>
encompasses both cDNA and genomic forms of a gene. A genomic form or clone of a<br>
gene contains the coding region interrupted with non-coding sequences termed "introns"<br>
or "intervening regions" or "intervening sequences." Introns are segments of a gene<br>
which are transcribed into nuclear RNA (hnRNA); introns may contain regulatory<br>
elements such as enhancers. Introns are removed or "spliced out" from the nuclear or<br>
primary transcript; introns therefore are absent in the messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript.<br>
The mRNA functions during translation to specify the sequence or order of amino acids<br>
in a nascent polypeptide.<br>
As used herein, the terms "nucleic acid molecule encoding," "DNA sequence<br>
encoding," and "DNA encoding" refer to the order or sequence of deoxyribonucleotides<br>
along a strand of deoxyribonucleic acid. The order of these deoxyribonucleotides<br>
determines the order of amino acids along the polypeptide (protein) chain. The DNA<br>
sequence thus codes for the amino acid sequence.<br>
As used herein, the terms "complementary" or "complementarity" are used in<br>
reference to polynucleotides (i.e., a sequence of nucleotides) related by the base-pairing<br>
rules. For example, for the sequence "A-G-T," is complementary to the sequence "T-C-<br>
A." Complementarity may be "partial.," in which only some of the nucleic acids' bases<br>
are matched according to the base pairing rules. Or, there may be "complete" or "total"<br>
complementarity between the nucleic acids. The degree of complementarity between<br>
nucleic acid strands has significant effects on the efficiency and strength of hybridization<br>
between nucleic acid strands. This is of particular importance in amplification reactions,<br>
as well as detection methods that depend upon binding between nucleic acids.<br>
As used herein, the term "hybridization" is used in reference to the pairing of<br>
complementary nucleic acids. Hybridization and the strength of hybridization (i.e., the<br>
strength of the association between the nucleic acids) is impacted by such factors as the<br>
degree of complementary between the nucleic acids, stringency of the conditions<br>
involved, the Tm of the formed hybrid, and the G:C ratio within the nucleic acids.<br>
As used herein, the term "Tm" is used in reference to the "melting temperature."<br>
The melting temperature is the temperature at which a population of double-stranded<br>
nucleic acid molecules becomes half dissociated into single strands. The equation for<br>
calculating the Tm of nucleic acids is well known in the art. As indicated by standard<br>
references, a simple estimate of the Tm value may be calculated by the equation: Tm =<br>
81.5 + 0.41 (% G + C), when a nucleic acid is in aqueous solution at 1 M NaCl (See e.g.,<br>
Anderson and Young, Quantitative Filter Hybridization, in Nucleic Acid Hybridization<br>
[1985]). Other references include more sophisticated computations that take structural as<br>
well as sequence characteristics into account for the calculation of Tm.<br>
As used herein the term "stringency" is used in reference to the conditions of<br>
temperature, ionic strength, and the presence of other compounds such as organic<br>
solvents, under which nucleic acid hybridizations are conducted. Those skilled in the art<br>
will recognize that "stringency" conditions may be altered by varying the parameters just<br>
described either individually or in concert With "high stringency" conditions, nucleic<br>
acid base pairing will occur only between nucleic acid fragments that have a high<br>
frequency of complementary base sequences (e.g., hybridization under "high stringency"<br>
conditions may occur between homologs with about 85-100% identity, preferably about<br>
70-100% identity). With medium stringency conditions, nucleic acid base pairing will<br>
occur between nucleic acids with an intermediate frequency of complementary base<br>
sequences (e.g., hybridization under "medium stringency" conditions may occur between<br>
homologs with about 50-70% identity). Thus, conditions of "weak" or "low" stringency<br>
are often required with nucleic acids that are derived from organisms that are genetically<br>
diverse, as the frequency of complementary sequences is usually less.<br>
"High stringency conditions" when used in reference to nucleic acid hybridization<br>
comprise conditions equivalent to binding or hybridization at 42°C in a solution<br>
consisting of 5X SSPE (43.8 g/1 NaCl, 6.9 g/1 NaH2PO4-H2O and 1.85 g/l EDTA, pH<br>
adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH), 0.5% SDS, 5X Denhardt's reagent and 100 μg/ml denatured<br>
salmon spam DNA followed by washing in a solution comprising 0.1X SSPE, 1.0%<br>
SDS at 42°C when a probe of about 500 nucleotides in length is employed.<br>
"Medium stringency conditions" when used in reference to nucleic acid<br>
hybridization comprise conditions equivalent to binding or hybridization at 42°C in a<br>
solution consisting of 5X SSPE (43.8 g/l NaCl, 6.9 g/l NaH2PO4•H2O and 1.85 g/l<br>
EDTA, pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH), 0.5% SDS, 5X Denhardt's reagent and 100<br>
fig/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA followed by washing in a solution comprising 1.0X<br>
SSPE, 1.0% SDS at 42°C when a probe of about 500 nucleotides in length is employed.<br>
"Low stringency conditions" comprise conditions equivalent to binding or<br>
hybridization at 42°C in a solution consisting of 5X SSPE (43.8 g/1 NaCl, 6.9 g/1<br>
NaH2PCyH2O and 1.85 g/1 EDTA, pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH), 0.1% SDS, 5X<br>
Denhardt's reagent [50X Denhardt's contains per 500 ml: 5 g Ficoll (Type 400,<br>
Pharamcia), 5 g BSA (Fraction V; Sigma)] and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA<br>
followed by washing in a solution comprising 5X SSPE, 0.1% SDS at 42°C when a<br>
probe of about 500 nucleotides in length is employed.<br>
As used herein, the term "antisense" is used in reference to DNA or RNA<br>
sequences that are complementary to a specific DNA or RNA sequence (e.g., mRNA).<br>
Included within this definition are antisense RNA ("asRNA") molecules involved in gene<br>
regulation by bacteria. Antisense RNA may be produced by any method, including<br>
synthesis by splicing the gene(s) of interest in a reverse orientation to a viral promoter<br>
which permits the synthesis of a coding strand. Once introduced into an embryo, this<br>
transcribed strand combines with natural mRNA produced by the embryo to form<br>
duplexes. These duplexes then block either the further transcription of the mRNA or its<br>
translation. In this manner, mutant phenotypes may be generated. The term "antisense<br>
strand' is used in reference to a nucleic acid strand that is complementary to the "sense"<br>
strand. The designation (-) (i.e., "negative") is sometimes used in reference to the<br>
antisense strand, with the designation (+) sometimes used in reference to the sense (i.e.,<br>
"positive") strand.<br>
The term "antigenic determinant" as used herein refers to that portion of an<br>
antigen that makes contact with a particular antibody (i.e., an epitope). When a protein<br>
or fragment of a protein is used to immunize a host animal., numerous regions of the<br>
protein may induce the production of antibodies which bind specifically to a given region<br>
or three-dimensional structure on the protein; these regions or structures are referred to as<br>
antigenic determinants. An antigenic determinant may compete with the intact antigen<br>
(i.e., the "immunogen" used to elicit the immune response) for binding to an antibody.<br>
The terms "specific binding" or "specifically binding" when used in reference to<br>
the interaction of an antibody and a protein or peptide means that the interaction is<br>
dependent upon the presence of a particular structure (i.e., the antigenic determinant or<br>
epitope) on the protein; in other words the antibody is recognizing and binding to a<br>
specific protein structure rather than to proteins in general. For example, if an antibody<br>
is specific for epitope "A," the presence of a protein containing epitope A (or free,<br>
unlabelled A) in a reaction containing labelled "A" and the antibody will reduce the<br>
amount of labelled A bound to the antibody.<br>
The term "transgene" as used herein refers to a foreign gene that is placed into an<br>
organism by, for example, introducing the foreign gene into newly fertilized eggs or<br>
early embryos. The term "foreign gene" refers to any nucleic acid (e.g., gene sequence)<br>
that is introduced into the genome of an animal by experimental manipulations and may<br>
include gene sequences found in that animal so long as the introduced gene does not<br>
reside in the same location as does the naturally-occurring gene.<br>
As used herein, the term "vector" is used in reference to nucleic acid molecules<br>
that transfer DNA segment(s) from one cell to another. The term "vehicle" is sometimes<br>
used interchangeably with "vector." Vectors are often derived from plasmids,<br>
bacteriophages, or plant or animal viruses.<br>
The term "expression vector" as used herein refers to a recombinant DNA<br>
molecule containing a desired coding sequence and appropriate nucleic acid sequences<br>
necessary for the expression of the operably linked coding sequence in a particular host<br>
organism. Nucleic acid sequences necessary for expression in prokaryotes usually<br>
include a promoter, an operator (optional), and a ribosome binding site, often along with<br>
other sequences. Eukaryotic cells are known to utilize promoters, enhancers, and<br>
termination and polyadenylation signals.<br>
As used herein, the term "gene transfer system" refers to any means of delivering<br>
a composition comprising a nucleic acid sequence to a cell or tissue. For example, gene<br>
transfer systems include, but are not limited to vectors (e.g., retroviral., adenoviral., adeno-<br>
associated viral., and other nucleic acid-based delivery systems), microinjection of naked<br>
nucleic acid, and polymer-based delivery systems (e.g., liposome-based and metallic<br>
particle-based systems). As used herein, the term "viral gene transfer system" refers to<br>
gene transfer systems comprising viral elements (e.g., intact viruses and modified viruses)<br>
to facilitate delivery of the sample to a desired cell or tissue. As used herein, the term<br>
"adenovirus gene transfer system" refers to gene transfer systems comprising intact or<br>
altered viruses belonging to the family Adenoviridae.<br>
The term "transfection" as used herein refers to the introduction of foreign DNA<br>
into eukaryotic cells. Transfection may be accomplished by a variety of means known to<br>
the art including calcium phosphate-DNA co-precipitation, DEAE-dextran-mediated<br>
transfection, polybrene-mediated transfection, electroporation, microinjection, liposome<br>
fusion, lipofection, protoplast fusion, retroviral infection, and biolistics.<br>
As used herein, the term "cell culture" refers to any in vitro culture of cells.<br>
Included within this term are continuous cell lines (e.g., with an immortal phenotype),<br>
primary cell cultures, finite cell lines (e.g., non-transformed cells), and any other cell<br>
population maintained in vitro.<br>
As used herein, the term "in vitro" refers to an artificial environment and to<br>
processes or reactions that occur within an artificial environment. In vitro environments<br>
can consist of, but are not limited to, test tubes and cell culture. The term "in vivo"<br>
refers to the natural environment (e.g., an animal or a cell) and to processes or reaction<br>
that occur within a natural environment.<br>
The term "test compound" refers to any chemical entity, pharmaceutical., drug,<br>
and the like that can be used to treat or prevent a disease, illness, sickness, or disorder of<br>
bodily function. Test compounds comprise both known and potential therapeutic<br>
compounds. A test compound can be determined to be therapeutic by screening using<br>
the screening methods of the present invention. A "known therapeutic compound" refers<br>
to a therapeutic compound that has been shown (e.g., through animal trials or prior<br>
experience with administration to humans) to be effective in such treatment or<br>
prevention.<br>
The term "sample" as used herein is used in its broadest sense and includes<br>
environmental and biological samples. Environmental samples include material from the<br>
environment such as soil and water. Biological samples may be animal., including,<br>
human, fluid (e.g., blood, plasma and serum), solid (e.g., stool), tissue, liquid foods (e.g.,<br>
milk), and solid foods (e.g., vegetables).<br>
As used herein, the terms "photosensitizer," and "photodynamic dye," refer to<br>
materials which undergo transformation to an excited state upon exposure to a light<br>
quantum (hv). Examples of photosensitizers and photodynamic dyes include, but are not<br>
limited to, Photofrin 2, benzoporphyrin, m-tetrahydroxyphenylchlorin, tin etiopurpurin,<br>
copper benzochlorin, and other porphyrins.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides novel systems and compositions for the treatment<br>
and monitoring of diseases (e.g., cancer). For example, the present invention provides<br>
systems and compositions that target, image, and sense pathophysiological defects,<br>
provide the appropriate therapeutic based on the diseased state, monitor the response to<br>
the delivered therapeutic, and identify residual disease. In preferred embodiments of the<br>
present invention, the compositions are small enough to readily enter a patient's or<br>
subjects cells.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the systems and compositions of the present invention<br>
are used in treatment and monitoring during cancer therapy. However, the systems and<br>
compositions of the present invention find use in the treatment and monitoring of a<br>
variety of disease states or other physiological conditions, and the present invention is not<br>
limited to use with any particular disease state or condition. Other disease states that<br>
find particular use with the present invention include, but are not limited to,<br>
cardiovascular disease, inflammatory disease, and other proliferative disorders.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the present invention provides nanodevices comprising<br>
dendrimer subunits. In preferred embodiments, the nanodevices are limited to a few<br>
hundred nanometers in diameter to facilitate internalization into cells.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention provide a composition comprising<br>
two or more different dendrimer structures, each including at least one functional<br>
component, including, but not limited to, therapeutic agents, biological monitoring<br>
components, biological imaging components, targeting components, and components to<br>
identify the specific signature of cellular abnormalities. These components ultimately<br>
form a therapeutic and/or diagnostic complexes in which each of the different<br>
components is located within a distinct dendrimer carrier. As such, the therapeutic<br>
nanodevice or complex is made up of at least two separate dendrimer carriers being<br>
specifically complexed with or covalently linked to at least one of the other dendrimer<br>
compositions of the complexes.<br>
The following discussion describes individual component parts of the nanodevice<br>
and methods of making and using the same in some embodiments of the present<br>
invention. To illustrate the design and use of the systems and compositions of the<br>
present invention, the discussion focuses on specific embodiments of the use of the<br>
compositions in the treatment and monitoring of breast adenocarcinoma and colon<br>
adenocarcinoma. These specific embodiments are intended only to illustrate certain<br>
preferred embodiments of the present invention and are not intended to limit the scope<br>
thereof. In these embodiments, the nanodevices of the present invention target the<br>
neoplastic cells through cell-surface moieties and are taken up by the tumor cell for<br>
example through receptor mediated endocytosis. The imaging component of the device<br>
allows the tumor to be imaged for example through the use of MRI. In those devices<br>
containing a sensing component, red fluorescence is activated by the presence of the<br>
particular cancer signature (e.g., Mucl, Her2 or mutated p53). This allows a triggered<br>
release of a therapeutic agent contained in the therapeutic component of the nanodevice.<br>
The release is facilitated by the therapeutic component being attached to a labile<br>
protecting group, such as, for example, cisplatin being attached to a photolabile<br>
protecting group that becomes released by laser light directed at those cells emitting the<br>
color of fluorescence activated as mentioned above (e.g., red-emitting) cells. Optionally<br>
the therapeutic device also may have a component to monitor the response of the tumor<br>
to therapy. For example, where the drug induces apoptosis of the cell, the caspase<br>
activity of the cells may be used to activate, a green fluorescence. This allows apoptotic<br>
cells to turn orange, (combination of red and green) while residual cells remain red. Any<br>
normal cells that are induced to undergo apoptosis in collateral damage fluoresce green.<br>
As is clear from the above example, the use of the compositions of the present<br>
invention facilitates non-intrusive sensing, signaling, and intervention for cancer. Since<br>
specific protocols of molecular alterations in cancer cells are identified using this<br>
technique, non-intrusive sensing through the dendritic molecules is achieved and may<br>
then be employed automatically against various tumor phenotypes. If the polymer array<br>
approach is employed, the targeting, sensing, and therapeutic conjugates are interchanged<br>
to address varied tumor types or different pathophysiological alterations. Thus, the array<br>
approach provides common, interchangeable therapeutic platforms that transcend any<br>
single type of tumor or cellular abnormality.<br>
I. Dendrimers<br>
In preferred embodiments of the present invention, the nanodevices comprises<br>
dendrimers. Dendrimeric polymers have been described extensively (See, Tomalia,<br>
Advanced Materials 6:529 [1994]; Angew, Chem, Int. Ed. Engl., 29:138 [1990];<br>
incorporated herein by reference in their entireties). Dendrimers polymers are<br>
synthesized as defined spherical structures typically ranging from 1 to 20 nanometers in<br>
diameter. Several generations of polyamidoamine (B-alanine subunit) dendrimers are<br>
shown in FIG. 1. Molecular weight and the number of terminal groups increase<br>
exponentially as a function of generation (the number of layers) of the polymer.<br>
Different types of dendrimers can be synthesized based on the core structure that initiates<br>
the polymerization process.<br>
The dendrimer core structures dictate several characteristics of the molecule such<br>
as the overall shape, density and surface functionality (Tomalia et al., Chem. Int. Ed.<br>
Engl., 29:5305 [1990]. Spherical dendrimers have ammonia as a trivalent initiator core<br>
or ethylenediamine (EDA) as a tetravalent initiator core. Recently described rod-shaped<br>
dendrimers (Yin et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc, 120:2678 [1998]) use polyemyleneimine<br>
linear cores of varying lengths; the longer the core, the longer the rod. Dendritic<br>
macromolecules are available commercially in kilogram quantities and are produced<br>
under current good manufacturing processes (GMP) for biotechnology applications.<br>
Dendrimers may be characterized by a number of techniques including, but not<br>
limited to, electrospray-ionization mass spectroscopy, 13C nuclear magnetic resonance<br>
spectroscopy, high performance liquid chromatography, size exclusion chromatography<br>
with multi-angle laser light scattering, capillary electrophoresis and gel electrophoresis.<br>
These tests assure the uniformity of the polymer population and are important for<br>
monitoring quality control of dendrimer manufacture for GMP applications and in vivo<br>
usage. Extensive studies have been completed with dendrimers and show no evidence of<br>
toxicity when administered intravenously in in vivo studies (Roberts et al., J. Biomed.<br>
Mat Res., 30:53 [1996] and Bourne et al., J. Magn. Reson. Imag., 6:305 [1996]).<br>
Numerous U.S. Patents describe methods and compositions for producing<br>
dendrimers. Examples of some of these patents are given below in order to provide a<br>
description of some dendrimer compositions that may be useful in the present invention,<br>
however it should be understood that these are merely illustrative examples and<br>
numerous other similar dendrimer compositions could be used in the present invention.<br>

ions, radionuclides, signal generators, antibodies, interleukins, hormones, interferons,<br>
viruses, viral fragments, pesticides, and antimicrobials.<br>
Other useful dendrimer type compositions are described in U.S. Patent 5,387,617,<br>

organosilicone and hydrophilic polyanicloamine nanscopic domains. The networks are<br>
prepared from copolydendrimer precursors having PAMAM (hydrophilic) or<br>
polyproyleneimine interiors and organosilicon; outer layers. These dendrimers have a<br>
controllable size, shape and spatial distribution. They are hydrophobic dendrimers with<br>
an organosilicon outer layer that can be used for specialty membrane, protective coating,<br>
composites containing organic organometallic or inorganic additives, skin patch delivery,<br>
absorbants, chromatography personal care products and agricultural products.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,795,582 describes the use of dendrimers as adjutants for influenza<br>
antigen. Use of the dendrimers produces antibody titer levels with reduced antigen dose.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,898,005 and U.S. Patent 5,861,319 describe specific immunobinding assays<br>
for determining concentration of an analyte. U.S. Patent 5,661,025 provides details of a<br>
self-assembling polynucleotide delivery system comprising dendrimer polycation to aid in<br>
delivery of nucleotides to target site. This patent provides methods of introducing a<br>
polynucleotide into a eukaryotic cell in vitro comprising contacting the cell with a<br>
composition comprising a polynucleotide and a dendrimer polycation non-covalently<br>
coupled to the polynucleotide.<br>
Dendrimer-antibody conjugates for use in in vitro diagnostic applications has<br>
previously been demonstrated (Singh et al., Clin. Chem., 40:1845 [1994]), for the<br>
production of dendrimer-chelant-antibody constructs, and for the development of<br>
boronated dendrimer-antibody conjugates (for neutron capture therapy); each of these<br>
latter compounds may be used as a cancer therapeutic (Wu et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem.<br>
Lett, 4:449 [1994]; Wiener et al., Magn. Reson. Med. 31:1 [1994]; Barth et al.,<br>
Bioconjugate Chem. 5:58 [1994]; and Barth et al).<br>
Some of these conjugates have also been employed in the magnetic resonance<br>
imaging of tumors (Wu et al., [1994] and Wiener et al., [1994], supra). Results from<br>
this work have documented that, when administered in vivo, antibodies can direct<br>
dendrimer-associated therapeutic agents to antigen-bearing tumors. Dendrimers also have<br>
been shown to specifically enter cells and carry either chemotherapeutic agents or genetic<br>
therapeutics. In particular, studies show that cisplatin encapsulated in dendrimer<br>
polymers has increased efficacy and is less toxic than cisplatin delivered by other means<br>
(Duncan and Malik, Control Rel. Bioact. Mater. 23:105 [1996]).<br>
Dendrimers have also been conjugated to fluorochromes or molecular beacons and<br>
shown to enter cells. They can then be detected within the cell in a manner compatible<br>
with sensing apparatus for evaluation of physiologic changes within cells (Baker et ai,<br>
Anal. Chem. 69:990 [1997]). Finally, dendrimers have been constructed as differentiated<br>
block copolymers where the outer portions of the molecule may be digested with either<br>
enzyme or light-induced catalysis (Urdea and Horn, Science 261:534 [1993]). This<br>
would allow the controlled degradation of the polymer to release therapeutics at the<br>
disease site and could provide a mechanism for an external trigger to release the<br>
therapeutic agents.<br>
While single dendrimers have been shown to contain these particular functions, to<br>
date, there has been no demonstration of a device that encompasses more than one of<br>
these modalities in a specific configuration. The present invention provides such<br>
nanodevices, wherein two or more dendrimers, each with a specific functionality are<br>
combined into a single complex. For example, preferred complexes of the present<br>
invention are constructed from individual dendrimer modules around a core dendrimer.<br>
This provides a core-shell dendrimer or a cluster molecule as shown in Figure 2. Prior<br>
to the constuction of the multi-dendrimer complex, separate conjugates for each of the<br>
different activities, e.g., one dendrimer conjugate for sensing, one for targeting and<br>
another for therapeutic carrier are produced. These different dendrimer modules are then<br>
clustered together and covalently linked in a manner that yields a single therapeutic<br>
device or complex.<br>
In this approach, one dendrimer acts as a core around which other shell-type<br>
dendrimers are covalently attached. In a preferred embodiment, the core molecule is an<br>
arnine-terminated dendrimer. The shell reagent dendrimers possess carboxylic acid/ester<br>
groups that allow covalent attachment by amide formation to the core. A highly<br>
concentrated mix of ammo-terminated dendrimers with different functional groups of the<br>
same or higher generation are then added to a core dendrimer. A cluster then forms by<br>
amide formation between the terminal amine groups of the core and the free terminal<br>
carboxylic acid groups of the functional outer dendrimers. A limited number of bonds<br>
can form between the core dendrimer and each outer-layer dendrimer because of<br>
sterically induced stoichiometries. In some embodiments, a molar excess of the<br>
outer-layer dendrimer is used to bias the reaction so that each outer core dendrimer reacts<br>
only with a single core molecule.<br>
II. Therapeutic Agents<br>
A wide range of therapeutic agents find use with the present invention. Any<br>
therapeutic agent that can be associated with a dendrimer may be delivered using the<br>
methods, systems, and compositions of the present invention. To illustrate delivery of<br>
therapeutic agents, the following discussion focuses mainly on the delivery of cisplatin<br>
and taxol for the treatment of cancer. Also discussed are various photodynamic therapy<br>
compounds, and various antimicrobial compounds.<br>
i. Cisplatin and Taxol<br>
Cisplatin and Taxol have a well-defined action of inducing apoptosis in tumor<br>
cells {See e.g., Lanni et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 94:9679 [1997]; Tortora et al., Cancer<br>
Research 57:5107 [1997]; and Zaffaroni et al., Brit. J. Cancer 77:1378 [1998]).<br>
However, treatment with these and other chemotherapeutic agents is difficult to<br>
accomplish without incurring significant toxicity. The agents currently in use are<br>
generally poorly water soluble, quite toxic, and given at doses that affect normal cells as<br>
wells as diseased cells. For example, paclitaxel (Taxol), one of the most promising<br>
anticancer compounds discovered, is poorly soluble in water. Paclitaxel has shown<br>
excellent antitumor activity in a wide variety of tumor models such as the B16<br>
melanoma, L1210 leukemias, MX-1 mammary tumors, and CS-1 colon tumor xenografts.<br>
However, the poor aqueous solubility of paclitaxel presents a problem for human<br>
administration. Accordingly, currently used paclitaxel formulations require a cremaphor<br>
to solubilize the drug. The human clinical dose range is 200-500 mg. This dose is<br>
dissolved in a 1:1 solution of ethanol:cremaphor and diluted to one liter of fluid given<br>
intravenously. The cremaphor currently used is polyemoxylated castor oil. It is given by<br>
infusion by dissolving in the cremaphor mixture and diluting with large volumes of an<br>
aqueous vehicle. Direct administration (e.g., subcutaneous) results in local toxicity and<br>
low levels of activity. Thus, there is a need for more efficient and effective delivery<br>
systems for these chemomerapeutic agents.<br>
The present invention overcomes these problems by providing methods and<br>
compositions for specific drug delivery. The present invention also provides the ability<br>
to administer combinations of agents {e.g., two or more different merapeutic agents) to<br>
produce an additive effect. The use of multiple agent may be used to counter disease<br>
resistance to any single agent For example, resistance of some cancers to single drugs<br>
(taxol) has been reported (Yu et al., Molecular Cell. 2:581 [1998]). Experiments<br>
conducted during the development of the present invention have demonstrated that<br>
cisplatin, conjugated to dendrimers, is even able to efficiently kill cancer cells that are<br>
resistant to cisplatin (See, Example 4). Although an understanding of the mechanism is<br>
not necessary to practice the present invention and the present invention is not so limited,<br>
it is contemplated that the dendrimer conjugates prevent multidrug resistance channels<br>
from pumping the cisplatin out of the cell.<br>
The present invention also provides the opportunity to monitor therapeutic success<br>
following delivery of cisplatin and/or Taxol to a subject. For example, measuring the<br>
ability of these drugs to induce apoptosis in vitro is reported to be a marker for in vivo<br>
efficacy (Gibb, Gynecologic Oncology 65:13 [1997]). Therefore, in addition to the<br>
targeted delivery of either one or both of these drugs to provide effective anti-tumor<br>
therapy and reduce toxicity, the effectiveness of the therapeutic can be gauged by<br>
techniques of the present invention that monitor the induction of apoptosis. Importantly,<br>
both therapeutics are active against a wide-range of tumor types including, but not<br>
limited to, breast cancer and colon cancer (Akutsu et al., Eur. J. Cancer 31A:2341<br>
[1995]).<br>
Although the above discussion describes two specific agents, any pharmaceutical<br>
that is routinely used in a cancer therapy context finds use in the present invention. In<br>
treating cancer according to the invention, the therapeutic component of the nanodevice<br>
may comprise compounds including, but not limited to, adriamycin, 5-fluorouracil,<br>
etoposide, camptothecin, actinomycin-D, mitomycin C, or more preferably, cisplatin.<br>
The agent may be prepared and used as a combined therapeutic composition, or kit, by<br>
combining it with the immunotherapeutic agent, as described herein.<br>
In some embodiments of the present invention, the dendrimer systems further<br>
comprise one or more agents that directly cross-link nucleic acids (e.g., DNA) to<br>
facilitate DNA damage leading to a synergistic, antineoplastic agents of the present<br>
invention. Agents such as cisplatin, and other DNA alkylating agents may be used.<br>
Cisplatin has been widely used to treat cancer, with efficacious doses used in clinical<br>
applications of 20 mg/M2 for 5 days every three weeks for a total of three courses. The<br>
nanodevice may be delivered via any suitable method, including, but not limited to,<br>
injection intravenously, subcutaneously, intratumorally, intraperitoneally, or topically<br>
(e.g., to mucosal surfaces).<br>
Agents that damage DNA also include compounds that interfere with DNA<br>
replication, mitosis and chromosomal segregation. Such chemotherapeutic compounds<br>
include adriamycin, also known as doxorubicin, etoposide, verapamil, podophyllotoxin,<br>
and the like. Widely used in a clinical setting for the treatment of neoplasms, these<br>
compounds are administered through bolus injections intravenously at doses ranging from<br>
25-75 Mg/M2 at 21 day intervals for adriamycin, to 35-50 Mg/M2 for etoposide<br>
intravenously or double the intravenous dose orally.<br>
Agents that disrupt the synthesis and fidelity of nucleic acid precursors and<br>
subunits also lead to DNA damage and find use as chemotherapeutic agents in the<br>
present invention. A number of nucleic acid precursors have been developed.<br>
Particularly useful are agents that have undergone extensive testing and are readily<br>
available. As such, agents such as 5-fluorouracii (5-FU) are preferentially used by<br>
neoplastic tissue, making this agent particularly useful for targeting to neoplastic cells.<br>
The doses delivered may range from 3 to 15 mg/kg/day, although other doses may vary<br>
considerably according to various factors including stage of disease, amenability of the<br>
cells to the therapy, amount of resistance to the agents and the like.<br>
The anti-cancer therapeutic agents that find use in the present invention are those<br>
that are amenable to incorporation into dendrimeric structures or are otherwise associated<br>
with dendrimer structures such that they can be delivered into a subject, tissue, or cell<br>
without loss of fidelity of its anticancer effect. For a more detailed description of cancer<br>
therapeutic agents such as a platinum complex, verapamil, podophyllotoxin, carboplatin,<br>
procarbazine, mechoremamine, cyclophosphamide, camptothecin, ifosfamide, melphalan,<br>
chlorambucil, bisulfan, nitrosurea, adriamycin, dactinomycin, daunorubicin, doxorubicin,<br>
bleomycin, plicomycin, mitomycin, etoposide (VP16), tamoxifen, taxol, transplatinum,<br>
5-fluorouracil, vincristin, vinblastin and methotrexate and other similar anti-cancer<br>
agents, those of skill in the art are referred to any number of instructive manuals<br>
including, but not limited to, the Physician's Desk reference and to Goodman and<br>
Gilman's "Pharmaceutical Basis of Therapeutics" ninth edition, Eds. Hardman et al.,<br>
1996.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the drugs are preferably attached to the nanodevice<br>
with photocleavable linkers. For example, several heterobifunctional., photocleavable<br>
linkers that find use with the present invention are described by Ottl et al (Ottl et al.,<br>
Bioconjugate Chem., 9:143 [1998]). These linkers can be either water or organic<br>
soluble. They contain an activated ester that can react with amines or alcohols and an<br>
epoxide that can react with a thiol group. In between the two groups is a 3,4-dimethoxy-<br>
6-nitrophenyl photoisomerization group, which, when exposed to near-ultraviolet light<br>
(365 nm), releases the amine or alcohol in intact form. Thus, the therapeutic agent,<br>
when linked to the compositions of the present invention using such linkers, may be<br>
released in biologically active or activatable form through exposure of the target area to<br>
near-ultraviolet light.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, the alcohol group of taxol is reacted with the<br>
activated ester of the organic-soluble linker. This product in turn is reacted with the<br>
partially-thiolated surface of appropriate dendrimers (the primary amines of the<br>
dendrimers can be partially converted to thiol-containing groups by reaction with a<br>
sub-stoichiometric amount of 2-iminothiolano). In the case of cisplatin, the amino<br>
groups of the drug are reacted with the water-soluble form of the linker. If the amino<br>
groups are not reactive enough, a primary ammo-containing active analog of cisplatin,<br>
such as Pt(II) sulfadiazine dichloride (Pasani et al., Inorg. Chim. Acta 80:99 [1983] and<br>
Abel et al., Eur. J. Cancer 9:4 [1973]) can be used. Thus conjugated, the drug is<br>
inactive and will not harm normal cells. When the conjugate is localized within tumor<br>
cells, it is exposed to laser light of the appropriate near-UV wavelength, causing the<br>
active drug to be released into the cell.<br>
Similarly, in other embodiments of the present invention, the amino groups of<br>
cisplatin (or an analog thereof) is linked with a very hydrophobic photocleavable<br>
protecting group, such as the 2-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl group (Pillai, V.N.R. Synuiesis:<br>
1-26 [1980]). With this hydrophobic group attached, the drug is loaded into and very<br>
preferentially retained by the hydrophobic cavities within the PAMAM dendrimer (See<br>
e.g., Esfand et al., Pharm. Sci., 2:157 [1996]), insulated from the aqueous environment<br>
When exposed to near-UV light (about 365 nm), the hydrophobic group is cleaved,<br>
leaving the intact drug. Since the drug itself is hydrophilic, it diffuses out of the<br>
dendrimer and into the tumor cell, where it initiates apoptosis.<br>
An alternative to photocleavable linkers are enzyme cleavable linkers. A number<br>
of photocleavable linkers have been demonstrated as effective anti-tumor conjugates and<br>
can be prepared by attaching cancer therapeutics, such as doxorubicin, to water-soluble<br>
polymers with appropriate short peptide linkers (See e.g., Vasey et ai, Clin. Cancer Res.,<br>
5:83 [1999]). The linkers are stable outside of the cell, but are cleaved by thiolproteases<br>
once within the cell In a preferred embodiment, the conjugate PK1 is used As an<br>
alternative to the photocleavable linker strategy, enzyme-degradable linkers, such as<br>
Gly-Phe-Leu-Gly may be used.<br>
The present invention is not limited by the nature of the therapeutic technique.<br>
For example, other conjugates that find use with the present invention include, but are<br>
not limited to, using conjugated boron dusters for BNCT (Capala et al., Bioconjugate<br>
Chem., 7:7 [1996]), the use of radioisotopes, and conjugation of toxins such as ricin to<br>
the nanodevice.<br>
ii. Photodynamic Therapy<br>
Photodynamic therapeutic agents may also be used as therapeteutic agents in the<br>
present invention. In some embodiments, the dendrimeric compositions of the present<br>
invention containing photodynamic compounds are illuminated, resulting in the<br>
production of singlet oxygen and free radicals that diffuse out of the fiberless radiative<br>
effector to act on the biological target (e.g., tumor cells or bacterial cells). Some<br>
preferred photodynamic compounds include, but are not limited to, those that can<br>
participate in a type II photochemical reaction:<br><br>
where PS = photosenstizer, PS*(1) = excited singlet state of PS, PS*(3) = excited triplet<br>
state of PS, hv = light quantum, *02 = excited singlet state of oxygen, and T =<br>
biological target. Other photodynamic compounds useful in the present invention include<br>
those that cause cytotoxity by a different mechanism than singlet oxygen production<br>
(e.g., copper benzochlorin, Selman, et al., Photochem. Photobiol., 57:681-85 [1993],<br>
incorporated herein by reference). Examples of photodynamic compounds that find use<br>
in the present invention include, but are not limited to Photofrin 2, phtalocyanins (See<br>
e.g., Brasseur et al., Photochem. Photobiol., 47:705-11 [1988]), benzoporphyrin,<br>
tetrahydroxyphenylporphyrins, naphtalocyanines (See e.g., Firey and Rodgers,<br>
Photochem. Photobiol., 45:535-38 [1987]), sapphyrins (Sessler et al., Proc. SPEE,<br>
1426:318-29 [1991]), porphinones (Chang et al., Proc. SPIE, 1203:281-86 [1990]), tin<br>
etiopurpurin, ether substituted porphyrins (Pandey et al., Photochem. Photobiol., 53:65-72<br>
[1991]), and cationic dyes such as the phenoxazines (See e.g., Cincotta et al., SPIE Proa,<br>
1203:202-10 [1590]).<br>
In other embodiments, toxic agents that directly produce free radicals (i.e., do not<br>
produce singlet oxygen) are incorporated into the fiberless radiative effectors during<br>
polymerization. This approach allows for larger and longer lived fiberless radiative<br>
effectors and will not be limited by local oxygen supplies. Such toxic agents include, but<br>
are not limited to 2-methyl-4-nitro-quinoline-N-oxide (Aldrich) and 4,4-dinitro-(2,2)<br>
bipyridinyl-N,N dioxide (Aldrich), which produce hydroxyl radicals when illuminated<br>
with 360-400 nm light (Botchway et al., Photochem. PhotobioL 67(7):635-40 [1998]);<br>
malachite green and isofuran blue (Molecular Probes), which produce hydroxyl radicals<br>
upon stimulation with about 630 nm light (Jay et al., PNAS 91:2659 [1994]; Haugland,<br>
Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Chemicals, 6th ed., Molecular Probes,<br>
Eugene, OR [1994]); potassium nitrosylpentachloromthenate (Molecular Probes) (abs =<br>
516 nm), Roussin's black salt and Roussin's red salt (abs 313-546 nm), serve as sources<br>
of NO which is toxic to cells (Murphy et al., Neuropharm. 33:1375-85 [1994]; Bourassa<br>
et al., JACS 119:2853-60 [1997]); and other photolytic nitric oxide and hydroxyl donors<br>
(De Leo and Ford, JACS 121:1980-81 [1999]).<br>
iii. Antimicrobial Therapeutic Agents<br>
Antimicrobial therapeutic agents may also be used as therapeteutic agents in the<br>
present invention. Any agent that can kill, inhibit, or otherwise attenuate the function of<br>
microbial organisms may be used, as well as any agent contemplated to have such<br>
activities. Antimicrobial agents include, but are not limited to, natural and synthetic<br>
antibiotics, antibodies, inhibitory proteins, antisense nucleic acids, membrane disruptive<br>
agents and the like, used alone or in combination. Indeed, any type of antibiotic may be<br>
used including, but not limited to, anti-bacterial agents, anti-viral agents, anti-fungal<br>
agents, and the like.<br>
III. Signature Identifying Agents<br>
In certain embodiments, the nano-devices of the present invention contain one or<br>
more signature identifying agents that are activated by, or are able to interact with, a<br>
signature component ("signature"). In preferred embodiments, the signature identifying<br>
agent is an antibody, preferably a monoclonal antibody, that specifically binds the<br>
signature {e.g., cell surface molecule specific to a cell to be targeted).<br>
In some embodiments of the present invention, tumor cells are identified. Tumor<br>
cells have a wide variety of signatures, including the defined expression of<br>
cancer-specific antigens such as Mucl, HER-2 and mutated p53 in breast cancer. These<br>
act as specific signatures for the cancer, being present in 30% (HER-2) to 70% (mutated<br>
p53) of breast cancers. In a preferred embodiment, a nanodevice of the present invention<br>
comprises a monoclonal antibody mat specifically binds to a mutated version of p53 that<br>
is present in breast cancer.<br>
In some embodiments of the present invention, cancer cells expressing<br>
susceptibility genes are identified. For example, in some embodiments, there are two<br>
breast cancer susceptibility genes that are used as specific signatures for breast cancer:<br>
BRCA1 on chromosome 17 and BRCA2 on chromosome 13. When an individual carries<br>
a mutation in either BRCA1 or BRCA2, they are at an increased risk of being diagnosed<br>
with breast or ovarian cancer at some point in their lives. These genes participate in<br>
repairing radiation-induced breaks in double-stranded DNA. It is thought that mutations<br>
in BRCA1 or BRCA2 might disable this mechanism, leading to more errors in DNA<br>
replication and ultimately to cancerous growth.<br>
In addition, the expression of a number of different cell surface receptors find use<br>
as targets for the binding and uptake of the nano-device. Such receptors include, but are<br>
not limited to, EGF receptor, folate receptor, FGR receptor 2, and the like.<br>
In some embodiments of the present invention, changes in gene expression<br>
associated with chromosomal abborations are the signature component. For example,<br>
Burkitt lymphoma results from chromosome translocations that involve the Myc gene. A<br>
chromosome translocation means that a chromosome is broken, which allows it to<br>
associate with parts of other chromosomes. The classic chromosome translocation in<br>
Burkitt lymophoma involves chromosome 8, the site of the Myc gene. This changes the<br>
pattern of Myc expression, thereby disrupting its usual function in controlling cell growth<br>
and proliferation.<br>
In other embodiments, gene expression associated with colon cancer are identified<br>
as the signature component. Two key genes are known to be involved in colon cancer:<br>
MSH2 on chromosome 2 and MLH1 on chromosome 3. Normally, the protein products<br>
-of these genes help to repair mistakes made in DNA replication. If the MSH2 and<br>
MLH1 proteins are mutated, the mistakes in replication remain unrepaired, leading to<br>
damaged DNA and colon cancer. MEN1 gene, involved in multiple endocrine neoplasia,<br>
has been known for several years to be found on chromosome 11, was more finely<br>
mapped in 1997, and serves as a signature for such cancers. In preferred embodiments<br>
of the present invention, an antibody specific for the altered protein or for the expressed<br>
gene to be detected is complexed with nanodevices of the present invention.<br>
In yet another embodiment, adenocarcinoma of the colon has defined expression<br>
of CEA and mutated p53, both well-documented rumor signatures. The mutations of p53<br>
in some of these cell lines are similar to that observed in some of the breast cancer cells<br>
and allows for the sharing of a p53 sensing component between the two nanodevices for<br>
each of these cancers (i.e., in assembling the nanodevice, dendrimers comprising the<br>
same signature identifying agent may be used for each cancer type). Both colon and<br>
breast cancer cells may be reliably studied using cell lines to produce tumors in nude<br>
mice, allowing for optimization and characterization in animals.<br>
From the discussion above it is clear that there are many different tumor<br>
signatures that find use with the present invention, some of which are specific to a<br>
particular type of cancer and others which are promiscuous in their origin. The present<br>
invention is not limited to any particular tumor signature or any other disease-specific<br>
signature. For example, tumor suppressors that find use as signatures in the present<br>
invention include, but are not limited to, p53, Mucl, CEA, pl6, p21, p27, CCAM, RB,<br>
APC, DCC, NF-1, NF-2, WT-1, MEN-1, MEN-II, p73, VHL, FCC and MCC.<br>
IV. Biological Imaging Component<br>
In some embodiments of the present invention, the nanodevice comprises at least<br>
one dendrimer-based nanoscopic building block that can be readily imaged. The present<br>
invention is not limited by the nature of the imaging component used. In some<br>
embodiments of the present invention, imaging modules comprise surface modifications<br>
of quantum dots (See e.g., Chan and Nie, Science 281:2016 [1998]) such as zinc<br>
sulfide-capped cadmium selenide coupled to biomolecules (Sooklal., Adv. Mater., 10:1083<br>
[1998]).<br>
However, in preferred embodiments, the imaging module comprises dendrimers<br>
produced according to the "nanocomposite" concept (Balogh et al., Proc. of ACS PMSE<br>
77:118 [1997] and Balogh and Tomalia, J. Am. Che. Soc, 120:7355 [1998]). In these<br>
embodiments, dendrimers are produced by reactive encapsulation, where a reactant is<br>
preorganized by the dendrimer template and is then subsequently immobilized in/on the<br>
polymer molecule by a second reactant. Size, shape, size distribution and surface<br>
functionality of these nanoparticles are determined and controlled by the dendritic<br>
macromolecules. These materials have the solubility and compatibility of the host and<br>
have the optical or physiological properties of the guest molecule (i.e., the molecule that<br>
permits imaging). While the dendrimer host may vary according to the medium, it is<br>
possible to load the dendrimer hosts with different compounds and at various guest<br>
concentration levels. Complexes and composites may involve the use of a variety of<br>
metals or other inorganic materials. The high electron density of these materials<br>
considerably simplifies the imaging by electron microscopy and related scattering<br>
techniques. In addition, properties of inorganic atoms introduce new and measurable<br>
properties for imaging in either the presence or absence of interfering biological<br>
materials. In some embodiments of the present invention, encapsulation of gold, silver,<br>
cobalt, iron atoms/molecules and/or organic dye molecules such as fluorescein are<br>
encapsulated into dendrimers for use as nanoscopi composite labels/tracers, although any<br>
material that facilitates imaging or detection may be employed.<br>
In some embodiments of the present invention, imaging is based on the passive or<br>
active observation of local differences in density of selected physical properties of the<br>
investigated complex matter. These differences may be due to a different shape (e.g.,<br>
mass density detected by atomic force microscopy), altered composition (e.g.,<br>
radiopaques detected by X-ray), distinct light emission (e.g., fluorochromes detected by<br>
spectrophotometry), different diffraction (e.g., electron-beam detected by TEM),<br>
contrasted absorption (e.g., light detected by optical methods), or special radiation<br>
emission (e.g., isotope methods), etc. Thus, quality and sensitivity of imaging depend on<br>
the property observed and on the technique used. The imaging techniques for cancerous<br>
cells have to provide sufficient levels of sensitivity to observe small, local concentrations<br>
of selected cells. The earliest identification of cancer signatures requires high selectivity<br>
(i.e., highly specific recognition provided by appropriate targeting) and the highest<br>
possible sensitivity.<br>
A. Magnetic Resonance Imaging<br>
Once the targeted nanodevice has attached to (or been internalized into) tumor<br>
cells, one or more modules on the device serve to image its location. Dendrimers have<br>
already been employed as biomedical imaging agents, perhaps most notably for magnetic<br>
resonance imaging (MRI) contrast enhancement agents (See e.g., Wiener et al., Mag.<br>
Reson. Med. 31:1 [1994]; an example using PAMAM dendrimers). These agents are<br>
typically constructed by conjugating chelated paramagnetic ions, such as<br>
Gd(III)-diemylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Gd(IIT)-DTPA), to water-soluble dendrimers.<br>
Other paramagnetic ions that may be useful in this context of the include, but are not<br>
limited to, gadolinium, manganese, copper, chromium, iron, cobalt, erbium, nickel,<br>
europium, technetium, indium, samarium, dysprosium, ruthenium, ytterbium, yttrium, and<br>
holmium ions and combinations thereof. In some embodiments of the present invention,<br>
the dendrimer is also conjugated to a targeting group, such as epidermal growth factor<br>
(EGF), to make the conjugate specifically bind to the desired cell type (e.g., in the case<br>
of EGF, EGFR-expressing tumor cells). In a preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, DTPA is attached to dendrimers via the isothiocyanate of DTPA as described<br>
by Wiener (Wiener et al., Mag. Reson. Med. 31:1 [1994]).<br>
Dendrimeric MRI agents are particularly effective due to the polyvalency, size<br>
and architecture of dendrimers, which results in molecules with large proton relaxation<br>
enhancements, high molecular relaxivity, and a high effective concentration of<br>
paramagnetic ions at the target site. Dendrimeric gadolinium contrast agents have even<br>
been used to differentiate between benign and malignant breast tumors using dynamic<br>
MRI, based on how the vasculature for the latter type of tumor images more densely<br>
(Adam et al., Ivest. Rad. 31:26 [1996]). Thus, MRI provides a particularly useful<br>
imaging system of the present invention.<br>
B. Microscopic Imaging<br>
Static structural microscopic imaging of cancerous cells and tissues has<br>
traditionally been performed outside of the patient. Classical histology of tissue biopsies<br>
provides a fine illustrative example, and has proven a powerful adjunct to cancer<br>
diagnosis and treatment. After removal., a specimen is sliced thin (e.g., less than 40<br>
microns), stained, fixed, and examined by a pathologist. If images are obtained, they are<br>
most often 2-D transmission bright-field projection images. Specialized dyes are<br>
employed to provide selective contrast, which is almost absent from the unstained tissue,<br>
and to also provide for the identification of aberrant cellular constituents. Quantifying<br>
sub-cellular structural features by using computer-assisted analysis, such as in nuclear<br>
ploidy determination, is often confounded by the loss of histologic context owing to the<br>
thinness of the specimen and the overall lack of 3-D information. Despite the limitations<br>
of the static imaging approach, it has been invaluable to allow for the identification of<br>
neoplasia in biopsied tissue. Furthermore, its use is often the crucial factor in the<br>
decision to perform invasive and risky combinations of chemotherapy, surgical<br>
procedures, and radiation treatments, which are often accompanied by severe collateral<br>
tissue damage, complications, and even patient death.<br>
The nanodevices of the present invention allow functional microscopic imaging of<br>
tumors and provide improved methods for imaging. The methods find use in vivo, in<br>
vitro, and ex vivo. For example, in one embodiment of the present invention, dendrimers<br>
of the present invention are designed to emit light or other detectable signals upon<br>
exposure to light. Although the labeled dendrimers may be physically smaller than the<br>
optical resolution limit of the microscopy technique, they become self-luminous objects<br>
when excited and are readily observable and measurable using optical techniques. In<br>
some embodiments of the present invention, sensing fluorescent biosensors in a<br>
microscope involves the use of tunable excitation and emission filters and<br>
multiwavelength sources (Farkas et al., SPEI 2678:200 [1997]). In embodiments where<br>
the imaging agents are present in deeper tissue, longer wavelengths in the Near-infrared<br>
(NIR) are used (See e.g., Lester et al., Cell Mol. Biol. 44:29 [1998]). Dendrimeric<br>
biosensing in the Near-IR has been demonstrated with dendrimeric biosensing<br>
antenna-like architectures (Shortreed et al., J. Phys. Chem., 101:6318 [1997]).<br>
Biosensors that find use with the present invention include, but are not limited to,<br>
fluorescent dyes and molecular beacons.<br>
In some embodiments of the present invention, in vivo imaging is accomplished<br>
using functional imaging techniques. Functional imaging is a complementary and<br>
potentially more powerful techniques as compared to static structural imaging.<br>
Functional imaging is best known for its application at the macroscopic scale, with<br>
examples including functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Positron<br>
Emission Tomography (PET). However, functional microscopic imaging may also be<br>
conducted and find use in in vivo and ex vivo analysis of living tissue. Functional<br>
microscopic imaging is an efficient combination of 3-D imaging, 3-D spatial<br>
multispectral volumetric assignment, and temporal sampling: in short a type of 3-D<br>
spectral microscopic movie loop. Interestingly, cells and tissues autofluoresce. When<br>
excited by several wavelengths, providing much of the basic 3-D structure needed to<br>
characterize several cellular components (e.g., the nucleus) without specific labeling.<br>
Oblique light illumination is also useful to collect structural information and is used<br>
routinely. As opposed to structural spectral microimaging, functional spectral<br>
microimaging may be used with biosensors, which act to localize physiologic signals<br>
within the cell or tissue. For example, in some embodiments of the present invention,<br>
biosensor-comprising dendrimers of the present invention are used to image upregulated<br>
receptor families such as the folate or EGF classes. In such embodiments, functional<br>
biosensing therefore involves the detection of physiological abnormalities relevant to<br>
carcinogenesis or malignancy, even at early stages. A number of physiological<br>
conditions may be imaged using the compositions and methods of the present invention<br>
including, but not limited to, detection of nanoscopic dendrimeric biosensors for pH,<br>
oxygen concentration, Ca2+ concentration, and other physiologically relevant analytes.<br>
V. Biological Monitoring Component<br>
The biological monitoring or sensing component of the nanodevice of the present<br>
invention is one which that can monitor the particular response in the tumor cell induced<br>
by an agent (e.g., a therapeutic agent provided by the therapeutic component of the<br>
nanodevice). While the present invention is not limited to any particular monitoring<br>
system, the invention is illustrated by methods and compositions for monitoring cancer<br>
treatments. In preferred embodiments of the present invention, the agent induces<br>
apoptosis in cells and monitoring involves the detection of apoptosis. In particular<br>
embodiments, the monitoring component is an agent that fluoresces at a particular<br>
wavelength when apoptosis occurs. For example, in a preferred embodiment, caspase<br>
activity activates green fluorescence in the monitoring component. Apoptotic cancer<br>
cells, which have turned red as a result of being targeted by a particular signature with a<br>
red label, turn orange while residual cancer cells remain red. Normal cells induced to<br>
undergo apoptosis (e.g., through collateral damage), if present, will fluoresce green.<br>
In these embodiments, fluorescent groups such as fluorescein are employed in the<br>
monitoring component. Fluorescein is easily attached to the dendrimer surface via the<br>
isothiocyanate derivatives, available from Molecular Probes, Inc. This allows the<br>
nanodevices to be imaged with the cells via confocal microscopy.<br>
Sensing of the effectiveness of the nanodevices is preferably achieved by using<br>
fluorogenic peptide enzyme substrates. For example, apoptosis caused by the therapeutic<br>
agents results in the production of the peptidase caspase-1 (ICE). Calbiochem sells a<br>
number of peptide substrates for this enzyme that release a fluorescent moiety. A<br>
particularly useful peptide for use in the present invention is:<br>
MCA-Tyr-Glu-Val-Asp-Gly-Trp-Lys-(DNP)-NH2 (SEQ ID NO:l)<br>
where MCA is the (7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)acetyl and DNP is the 2,4-dinitrophenyl<br>
group (Talanian et al., J. Biol. Chem., 272: 9677 [1997]). In this peptide, the MCA<br>
group has greatly attenuated fluorescence, due to fluorogenic resonance energy transfer<br>
(FRET) to the DNP group. When the enzyme cleaves the peptide between the aspartic<br>
acid and glycine residues, the MCA and DNP are separated, and the MCA group strongly<br>
fluoresces green (excitation maximum at 325 nm and emission maximum at 392 nm).<br>
In preferred embodiments of the present invention, the lysine end of the peptide is<br>
linked to the nanodevice, so that the MCA group is released into the cytosol when it is<br>
cleaved. The lysine end of the peptide is a useful synthetic handle for conjugation<br>
because, for example, it can react with the activated ester group of a bifunctional linker<br>
such as Mal-PEG-OSu. Thus the appearance of green fluorescence in the target cells<br>
produced using these methods provides a clear indication that apoptosis has begun (if the<br>
cell already has a red color from the presence of aggregated quantum dots, the cell turns<br>
orange from the combined colors).<br>
Additional fluorescent dyes that find use with the present invention include, but<br>
are not limited to, acridine orange, reported as sensitive to DNA changes in apoptotic<br>
cells (Abrams et al., Development 117:29 [1993]) and cis-parinaric acid, sensitive to the<br>
lipid peroxidation that accompanies apoptosis (Hockenbery et al., Cell 75:241 [1993]). It<br>
should be noted that the peptide and the fluorescent dyes are merely exemplary. It is<br>
contemplated that any peptide that effectively acts as a substrate for a caspase produced<br>
as a result of apoptosis finds use with the present invention.<br>
VI. Targeting Components<br>
As described above, another component of the present invention is that the<br>
nanodevice compositions are able to specifically target a particular cell type (e.g., rumor<br>
cell). Generally, the nanodevice targets neoplastic cells through a cell surface moiety and<br>
is taken into the cell through receptor mediated endocytosis.<br>
Any moiety known to be located on the surface of target cells (e.g., tumor cells)<br>
finds use with the present invention. For example, an antibody directed against such a<br>
moiety targets the compositions of the present invention to cell surfaces containing the<br>
moiety. Alternatively, the targeting moiety may be a ligand directed to a receptor<br>
present on the cell surface or vice versa. Similarly, vitamins also may be used to target<br>
the therapeutics of the present invention to a particular cell.<br>
In some embodiments of the present invention, the targeting moiety may also<br>
function as a signatures component. For example, tumor specific antigens including, but<br>
not limited to, carcinoembryonic antigen, prostate specific antigen, tyrosinase, ras, a<br>
sialyly lewis antigen, erb, MAGE-1, MAGE-3, BAGE, MN, gplOO, gp75, p97, proteinase<br>
3, a mucin, CD81, CID9, CD63; CD53, CD38, CO-029, CA125, GD2, GM2 and<br>
O-acetyl GD3, M-TAA, M-fetal or M-urinary find use with the present invention.<br>
Alternatively the targeting moiety may be a tumor suppressor, a cytokine, a chemokine, a<br>
tumor specific receptor ligand, a receptor, an inducer of apoptosis, or a differentiating<br>
agent<br>
Tumor suppressor proteins contemplated for targeting include, but are not limited<br>
to, pl6, p21, p27, p53, p73, Rb, Wilms tumor (WT-1), DCC, neurofibromatosis type 1<br>
(NF-1), von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease tumor suppressor, Maspin, Brush-1, BR.CA-1,<br>
BRCA-2, the multiple tumor suppressor (MTS), gp95/p97 antigen of human melanoma,<br>
renal cell carcinoma-associated G250 antigen, KS 1/4 pan-carcinoma antigen, ovarian<br>
carcinoma antigen (CA125), prostate! specific antigen, melanoma antigen gp75, CD9,<br>
CD63, CD53, CD37, R2, CD81, CO029, TI-1, L6 and SAS. Of course these are merely<br>
exemplary tumor suppressors and it is envisioned that the present invention may be used<br>
in conjunction with any other agent that is or becomes known to those of skill in the art<br>
as a tumor suppressor.<br>
In preferred embodiments of the present invention targeting is directed to factors<br>
expressed by an oncogene. These include, but are not limited to, tyrosine kinases, both<br>
membrane-associated and cytoplasmic forms, such as members of the Src family,<br>
serine/threonine kinases, such as Mos, growth factor and receptors, such as platelet<br>
derived growth factor (PDDG), SMALL GTPases (G proteins) including the ras family,<br>
cyclin-dependent protein kinases (cdk), members of the myc family members including<br>
c-myc, N-myc, and L-myc and bcl-2 and family members.<br>
Cytokines, that may be targeted by the present invention include, but are not<br>
limited to, IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, ILA 1, IL-12,<br>
IL-13, EL-14, IL-15, TNF, GMCSF, p-interferon and y-interferon. Chemokines that may<br>
be used include, but are not limited to, MlPlα, MlPlβ, and RANTES.<br>
Enzymes that may be targeted by the present invention include, but are not<br>
limited to, cytosine deaminase, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase,<br>
galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase, phenylalanine hydroxylase, glucocerbrosidase,<br>
sphingomyelinase, α-L-iduronidase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, HSV thymidine<br>
kinase, and human thymidine kinase.<br>
Receptors and their related ligands that find use in the context of the present<br>
invention include, but are not limited to, the folate receptor, adrenergic receptor, growth<br>
hormone receptor, luteinizing hormone receptor, estrogen receptor, epidermal growth<br>
factor receptor, fibroblast growth factor receptor, and the like.<br>
Hormones and their receptors that find use in the targeting aspect of the present<br>
invention include, but are not limited to, growth hormone, prolactin, placental lactogen,<br>
luteinizing hormone, foihcle-stimulating hormone, chorionic gonadotropin,<br>
thyroid-stimulating hormone, leptin, adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), angiotensin I,<br>
angiotensin U, β-endorphin, βmelanocyte stimulating hormone (β-MSH), cholecystokinin,<br>
endothelin I, galanin, gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP), glucagon, insulin, amylin,<br>
lipotropins, GLP-1 (7-37) neurophysins, and somatostatin.<br>
In addition, the present invention contemplates that vitarnins (both fat soluble and<br>
non-fat soluble vitamins) placed in the targeting component of the nanodevice may be<br>
used to target cells that have receptors for, or otherwise take up these vitamins.<br>
Particularly preferred for this aspect are the fat soluble vitamins, such as vitamin D and<br>
its analogues, vitamin E, Vitamin A, and the like or water soluble vitamins such as<br>
Vitamin C, and the like.<br>
In some embodiments of the present invention, any number of cancer cell<br>
targeting groups are attached to dendrimers. The targeting dendrimers are, in turn,<br>
conjugated to a core dendrimer. Thus the nanodevice of the present invention is such<br>
that it is specific for targeting cancer cells (i.e., much more likely to attach to cancer<br>
cells and not to healthy cells). In addition, the polyvalency of dendrimers allows the<br>
attachment of polyethylene glycol (PEG) or polyethyloxazoline (PEOX) chains to help<br>
increase the blood circulation time and decrease the immunogenicity of the conjugates.<br>
In preferred embodiments of the present invention, targeting groups are<br>
conjugated to dendrimers with either short (e.g., direct coupling), medium (e.g., using<br>
small-molecule bifunctional linkers such as SPDP, sold by Pierce Chemical Company), or<br>
long (e.g., PEG bifunctional linkers, sold by Shearwater Polymers) linkages. Since<br>
dendrimers have surfaces with a large number of functional groups, more than one<br>
targeting group may be attached to each dendrimer. As a result, there are multiple<br>
binding events between the dendrimer and the target cell. In these embodiments, the<br>
dendrimers have a very high affinity for their target cells via this "cooperative binding"<br>
or polyvalent interaction effect.<br>
For steric reasons, the smaller the ligands, the more can be attached to the surface<br>
of a dendrimer. Recently, Wiener reported that dendrimers with attached folic acid<br>
would specifically accumulate on the surface and within tumor cells expressing the<br>
high-affinity folate receptor (hFR) (Wiener et al., Invest. Radiol., 32:748 [1997]). The<br>
hFR receptor is expressed or upregulated on epithelial tumors, including breast cancers.<br>
Control cells lacking hFR showed no significant accumulation of folate-derivatized<br>
dendrimers. Folic acid can be attached to full generation PAMAM dendrimers via a<br>
carbodiimide coupling reaction. Folic acid is a good targeting candidate for the<br>
dendrimers, with its small size and a simple conjugation procedure.<br>
A larger, yet still relatively small ligand is epidermal growth factor (EGF), a<br>
single-chain peptide with 53 amino acid residues. It has been shown that PAMAM<br>
dendrimers conjugated to EGF with the linker SPDP bind to the cell surface of human<br>
glioma cells and are endocytosed, accumulating in lysosomes (Casale et al., Bioconjugate<br>
Chem., 7:7 [1996]). Since EGF receptor density is up to 100 times greater on brain<br>
tumor cells compared to normal cells, EGF provides a useful targeting agent for these<br>
kinds of tumors. Since the EGF receptor is also overexpressed in breast and colon<br>
cancer, EGF may be used as a targeting agent for these cells as well. Similarly, the<br>
fibroblast growth factor receptors (EGER) also bind the relatively small polypeptides<br>
(FGF), and many are known to be expressed at high levels in breast rumor cell lines<br>
(particularly FGF1, 2 and 4) (Penault-Llorca et al., Int. J. Cancer 61:170 [1995]).<br>
In preferred embodiments of the present invention, the targeting moiety is an<br>
antibody or antigen binding fragment of an antibody (e.g., Fab units). For example, a<br>
well-studied antigen found on the surface of many cancers (including breast HER2<br>
tumors) is glycoprotein pl85, which is exclusively expressed in malignant cells (Press et<br>
al., Oncogene 5:953 [1990]). Recombinant humanized anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies<br>
(rhuMabHER2) have even been shown to inhibit the growth of HER2 overexpressing<br>
breast cancer cells, and are being evaluated (in conjunction with conventional<br>
chemotherapeutics) in phase III clinical trials for the treatment of advanced breast cancer<br>
(Pegrarn et al., Proc. Am. Soc. Clin. Oncol., 14:106 [1995]). Park and Papahadjopoulos<br>
have attached Fab fragments of rhuMabHER2 to small unilamellar liposomes, which then<br>
can be loaded with the chemotherapeutic doxorubicin (dox) and targeted to HER2<br>
overexpressing tumor xenografts (Park et al., Cancer Lett., 118:153 [1997] and Kirpotin<br>
et al., Biochem., 36:66 [1997]). These dox-loaded "immunoliposomes" showed increased<br>
cytotoxicity against tumors compared to corresponding non-targeted dox-loaded<br>
liposomes or free dox, and decreased systemic toxicity compared to free dox.<br>
Antibodies can be generated to allow for the targeting of antigens or immunogens<br>
(e.g., tumor, tissue or pathogen specific antigens) on various biological targets (e.g.,<br>
pathogens, tumor cells, normal tissue). Such antibodies include, but are not limited to<br>
polyclonal., monoclonal., chimeric, single chain, Fab fragments, and an Fab expression<br>
library.<br>
In some preferred embodiments, the antibodies recognize tumor specific epitopes<br>
(e.g., TAG-72 (Kjeldsen et al., Cancer Res. 48:2214-2220 [1988]; U.S. Pat Nos.<br>
5,892,020; 5,892,019; and 5,512,443); human carcinoma antigen (U.S. Pat Nos.<br>
5,693,763; 5,545,530; and 5,808,005); TP1 and TP3 antigens from osteocarcinoma cells<br>
(U.S. Pat No. 5,855,866); Thomsen-Friedenreich (TF) antigen from adenocarcinoma<br>
cells (U.S. Pat. No. 5,110,911); "KC-4 antigen" from human prostrate adenocarcinoma<br>
(U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,708,930 and 4,743,543); a human colorectal cancer antigen (U.S. Pat.<br>
No. 4,921,789); CA125 antigen from cystadenocarcinoma (U.S. Pat. No. 4,921,790); DF3<br>
antigen from human breast carcinoma (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,963,484 and 5,053,489); a human<br>
breast tumor antigen (U.S. Pat. No. 4,939,240); p97 antigen of human melanoma (U.S.<br>
Pat. No. 4,918,164); carcinoma or orosomucoid-related antigen (CORA)(U.S. Pat. No.<br>
4,914,021); a human pulmonary carcinoma antigen that reacts with human squamous cell<br>
lung carcinoma but not with human small cell lung carcinoma (U.S. Pat. No. 4,892,935);<br>
T and Tn haptens in glycoproteins of human breast carcinoma (Springer et al.,<br>
Carbohydr. Res. 178:271-292 [1988]), MSA breast carcinoma glycoprotein termed<br>
(Tjandra et al., Br. J. Surg. 75:811-817 [1988]); MFGM breast carcinoma antigen (Ishida<br>
et al., Tumor Biol. 10:12-22 [1989]); DU-PAN-2 pancreatic carcinoma antigen (Lan et<br>
al., Cancer Res. 45:305-310 [1985]); CA125 ovarian carcinoma antigen (Hanisch et al.,<br>
Carbohydr. Res. 178:29-47 [1988]); YH206 lung carcinoma amigen (Hinoda et al.,<br>
(1988) Cancer J. 42:653-658 [1988]). Each of the foregoing references are specifically<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In other preferred embodiments, the antibodies recognize specific pathogens (e.g.,<br>
Legionella peomophilia, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Clostridium tetani, Hemophilus<br>
influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Treponema pallidum, Bacillus anthracis, Vibrio<br>
cholerae, Borrelia burgdorferi, Cornebacterium diphtheria, Staphylococcus aureus,<br>
human papilloma virus, human immunodeficiency virus, rubella virus, polio virus, and<br>
the like).<br>
Various procedures known in the art are used for the production of polyclonal<br>
antibodies. For the production of antibody, various host animals can be immunized by<br>
injection with the peptide corresponding to the desired epitope including but not limited<br>
to rabbits, mice, rats, sheep, goats, etc. In a preferred embodiment, the peptide is<br>
conjugated to an immunogenic carrier (e.g., diphtheria toxoid, bovine serum albumin<br>
(BSA), or keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH)). Various adjuvants are used to increase<br>
the immunological response, depending on the host species, including but not limited to<br>
Freund's (complete and incomplete), mineral gels such as aluminum hydroxide, surface<br>
active substances such as lysolecithin, pluronic polyols, polyanions, peptides, oil<br>
emulsions, keyhole limpet hemocyanins, dinitrophenol, and potentially useful human<br>
adjuvants such as BCG (Bacille Calmette-Guerin) and Corynebacterium parvum.<br>
For preparation of monoclonal antibodies, any technique1 that provides for the<br>
production of antibody molecules by continuous cell lines in culture may be used (See<br>
e.g., Harlow and Lane, Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual., Cold Spring Harbor<br>
Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY). These include, but are not limited to, the<br>
hybridoma technique originally developed by Kohler and Milstdin (Kohler and Milstein,<br>
Nature 256:495-497 [1975]), as well as the trioma technique, the human B-cell<br>
hybridoma technique (See e.g., Kozbor et al. Immunol. Today 4:72 [1983]), and the<br>
EBV-hybridoma technique to produce human monoclonal antibodies (Cole et al., in<br>
Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy, Alan R. Liss, Inc., pp. 77-96 [1985]).<br>
In an additional embodiment of the invention, monoclonal antibodies can be<br>
produced in germ-free animals utilizing recent technology {See e.g., PCT/US90/02545).<br>
According to the invention, human antibodies may be used and can be obtained by using<br>
human hybridomas (Cote et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.80:2026-2030 [1983]) or by<br>
transforming human B cells with EBV virus in vitro (Cole et al., in Monoclonal<br>
Antibodies and Cancer Therapy, Alan R. Liss, pp. 77-96 [1985]).<br>
According to the invention, techniques described for the production of single<br>
chain antibodies (U.S. Patent 4,946,778; herein incorporated by reference) can be adapted<br>
to produce specific single chain antibodies. An additional embodiment of the invention<br>
utilizes the techniques described for the construction of Fab expression libraries (Huse et<br>
al., Science 246:1275-1281 [1989]) to allow rapid and easy identification of monoclonal<br>
Fab fragments with the desired specificity.<br>
Antibody fragments that contain the idiotype (antigen binding region) of the<br>
antibody molecule can be generated by known techniques. For example, such fragments<br>
include but are not limited to: the F(ab')2 fragment that can be produced by pepsin<br>
digestion of the antibody molecule; the Fab' fragments that can be generated by reducing<br>
the disulfide bridges of the F(ab')2 fragment, and the Fab fragments that can be<br>
generated by treating the antibody molecule with papain and a reducing agent.<br>
In the production of antibodies, screening for the desired antibody can be<br>
accomplished by techniques known in the art (e.g., radioimmunoassay, ELISA<br>
(enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay), "sandwich" immunoassays, immunoradiometric<br>
assays, gel diffusion precipitin reactions, immunodiffusion assays, in situ immunoassays<br>
(using colloidal gold, enzyme or radioisotope labels, for example), Western Blots,<br>
precipitation reactions, agglutination assays {e.g., gel agglutination assays,<br>
hemagglutination assays, etc.), complement fixation assays, immunofluorescence assays,<br>
protein A assays, and immunoelectrophoresis assays, etc.).<br>
The dendrimer systems of the present invention have many advantages over<br>
liposomes, such as their greater stability, better control of their size and polydispersity,<br>
and generally lower toxicity and immunogenicity (See e.g., Duncan et al., Polymer<br>
Preprints 39:180 [1998]). Thus, in some embodiments of the present invention,<br>
anti-HER2 antibody fragments, as well as other targeting antibodies are conjugated to<br>
dendrimers, as targeting agents for the nanodevices of the present inventioa<br>
For breast cancer, the cell surface may be targeted with folic acid, EGF, FGF, and<br>
antibodies (or antibody fragments) to the tumor-associated antigens MUC1, cMet receptor<br>
and CD56 (NCAM). Once internalized into the cell, the nanodevice binds (via<br>
conjugated antibodies) to HER2, MUC1 or mutated p53.<br>
The bifunctional linkers SPDP and SMCC and the longer Mal-PEG-OSu linkers<br>
are particularly useful for antibody-dendrimer conjugation. In addition, many tumor cells<br>
contain surface lectins that bind to oligosaccharides, with specific recognition arising<br>
chiefly from the terminal carbohydrate residues of the latter (Sharon and Lis, Science<br>
246:227 [1989]). Attaching appropriate monosaccharides to nonglycosylated proteins<br>
such as BSA provides a conjugate that binds to tumor lectin much more tightly than the<br>
free monosaccharide (Monsigny et al., Biochemie 70:1633 [1988]).<br>
Mannosylated PAMAM dendrimers bind mannoside-binding lectin up to 400 more<br>
avidly than monomelic mannosides (Page and Roy, Bioconjugate Chem., 8:714 [1997]).<br>
Sialylated dendrimers and other dendritic polymers bind to and inhibit a variety of<br>
sialate-binding viruses both in vitro and in vivo. By conjugating multiple<br>
monosaccharide residues {e.g., α-galactoside, for galactose-binding cells) to dendrimers,<br>
polyvalent conjugates are created with a high affinity for the corresponding type of tumor<br>
cell. The attachment reaction are easily carried out via reaction of the terminal amines<br>
with commercially-available α-galactosidyl-phenylisothiocyanate. The small size of the<br>
carbohydrates allows a high concentration to be present on the dendrirner surface.<br>
A very flexible method to identify and select appropriate peptide targeting groups<br>
is the phage display technique (See e.g., Cortese et al., Curr. Opin. Biotechol., 6:73<br>
[1995]), which can be conveniently carried out using commercially available kits. The<br>
phage display procedure produces a large and diverse combinatorial library of peptides<br>
attached to the surface of phage, which are screened against immobilized surface<br>
receptors for tight binding. After the tight-binding, viral constructs are isolated and<br>
sequenced to identify the peptide sequences. The cycle is repeated using the best<br>
peptides as starting points for the next peptide library. Eventually, suitably high-affinity<br>
peptides are identified and then screened for biocompatibility and target specificity. In<br>
this way, it is possible to produce peptides that can be conjugated to dendrimers,<br>
producing multivalent conjugates with high specificity and affinity for the target cell<br>
receptors (e.g., tumor cell receptors) or other desired targets.<br>
.Related to the targeting approaches described above is the "pretargeting" approach<br>
(See e.g., Goodwin and Meares, Cancer (suppl.) 80:2675 [1997]). An example of this<br>
strategy involves initial treatment of the patient with conjugates of tumor-specific<br>
monoclonal antibodies and streptavidin. Remaining soluble conjugate is removed from<br>
the bloodstream with an appropriate biotinylated clearing agent. When the<br>
tumor-localized conjugate is all that remains, a radiolabeled, biotinylated agent is<br>
introduced, which in turn localizes at the tumor sites by the strong and specific<br>
biotin-streptavidin interaction. Thus, the radioactive dose is maximized in dose<br>
proximity to the cancer cells and minimized in the rest of the body where it can harm<br>
healthy cells.<br>
It has been shown that if streptavidin molecules bound to a polystyrene well are<br>
first treated with a biotinylated dendrimer, and then radiolabeled streptavidinis<br>
introduced, up to four of the labeled streptavidin molecules are bound per<br>
polystyrene-bound streptavidin (Wilbur et al., Bioconjugate Chem., 9:813 [1998]). Thus,<br>
biotinylated dendrimers may be used in the methods of the present invention, acting as a<br>
polyvalent receptor for the radiolabel in vivo, with a resulting amplification of the<br>
radioactive dosage per bound antibody conjugate. In the preferred embodiments of the<br>
present invention, one or more multiply-biotinylated module(s) on the clustered<br>
dendrimer presents a polyvalent target for radiolabeled or boronated (Barth et al., Cancer<br>
Investigation 14:534 [1996]) avidin or streptavidin, again resulting in an amplified dose .<br>
of radiation for the tumor cells.<br>
Dendrimers and clustered dendrimers may also be used as clearing agents by, for<br>
example, partially biotinylating a dendrimer that has a polyvalent galactose or mannose<br>
surface. The conjugate-clearing agent complex would then have a very strong affinity<br>
for the corresponding hepatocyte receptors.<br>
In other embodiments of the present invention, an enhanced permeability and<br>
retention (EPR) method is used in targeting. The enhanced permeability and retention<br>
(EPR) effect is a more "passive" way of targeting tumors (See, Duncan and Sat, Ann.<br>
Oncol., 9:39 [1998]). The EPR effect is the selective concentration of macromolecules<br>
and small particles in the tumor microenvironment, caused by the hyperpermeable<br>
vasculature and poor lymphatic drainage of tumors. The dendrimer compositions of the<br>
present invention provide ideal polymers for this application, in that they are relatively<br>
rigid, of narrow polydispersity, of controlled size and surface chemistry, and have<br>
interior "cargo" space that can carry and then release antitumor drugs. In fact, PAMAM<br>
dendrimer-platinates have been shown to accumulate in solid rumors (Pt levels about 50<br>
times higher than those obtained with cisplatin) and have in vivo activity in solid tumor<br>
models for which cisplatin has no effect (Malik et al., Proc. Int'l. Symp. Control. Rel.<br>
Bioact. Mater., 24:107 [1997] and Duncan et al., Polymer Preprints 39:180 [1998]).<br>
The targeting moieties of the present invention may recognize a variety of other<br>
epitopes on biological targets (e.g., on pathogens). In some embodiments, molecular<br>
recognition elements are incorporated to recognize, target or detect a variety of<br>
pathogenic organisms including, but not limited to, sialic acid to target HIV (Wies et al.,<br>
Nature 333: 426 [1988]), influenza (White et al., Cell 56: 725 [1989]), Chlamydia<br>
(Infect. Imm. 57: 2378 [1989]), Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus suis, Salmonella,<br>
mumps, newcastle, and various viruses, including reovirus, Sendai virus, and myxovirus;<br>
and 9-OAC sialic acid to target coronavirus, encephalomyelitis virus, and rotavirus; non-<br>
sialic acid glycoproteins to detect cytomegalovirus (Virology 176: 337 [1990]) and<br>
measles virus (Virology 172: 386 [1989]); CD4 (Khatzman et al., Nature 312: 763<br>
[1985]), vasoactive intestinal peptide (Sacerdote et al., J. of Neuroscience Research 18:<br>
102 [1987]), and peptide T (Ruff et al., FEBS Letters 211: 17 [1987]) to target HTV;<br>
epidermal growth factor to target vaccinia (Epstein et al., Nature 318: 663 [1985]);<br>
acetylcholine receptor to target rabies (Lentz et al., Science 215: 182 [1982]); Cd3<br>
complement receptor to target Epstein-Barr virus (Carel et al., J. Biol. Chem. 265: 12293<br>
[1990]); p-adrenergic receptor to target reovirus (Co et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 82:<br>
1494 [1985]); ICAM-1 (Marlin et al., Nature 344: 70 [1990]), N-CAM, and myelin-<br>
associated glycoprotein MAb (Shephey et al., Proc. Natl. Acad, Sci. 85: 7743 [1988]) to<br>
target rninovirus; polio virus receptor to target polio virus (Mendelsohn et al., Cell 56:<br>
855 [1989]); fibroblast growth factor receptor to target herpes virus (Kaner et al.,<br>
Science 248: 1410 [1990]); oligomannose to target Escherichia coli; ganglioside GMI to<br>
target Neisseria meningitidis', and antibodies to detect a broad variety of pathogens (e.g.,<br>
Neisseria gonorrhoeae, V. vulnificus, V. parahaemolyticus, V. cholerae, and V.<br>
alginolyticus).<br>
In some embodiments of the present invention, the targeting moities are<br>
preferably nucleic acids (e.g., RNA or DNA). In some embodiments, the nucleic acid<br>
targeting moities are designed to hybridize by base pairing to a particular nucleic acid<br>
(e.g., chromosomal DNA, mRNA, or ribosomal RNA). In other embodiments, the<br>
nucleic acids bind a ligand or biological target. Nucleic acids that bind the following<br>
proteins have been identified: reverse transcriptase, Rev and Tat proteins of HTV (Tuerk<br>
et al., Gene 137(l):33-9 [1993]); human nerve growth factor (Binkley et al., Nuc. Acids<br>
Res. 23(16):3198-205 [1995]); and vascular endothelial growth factor (Jellinek et al.,<br>
Biochem. 83(34): 10450-6 [1994]). Nucleic acids that bind ligands are preferably<br>
identified by the SELEX procedure (See e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,475,096; 5,270,163; and<br>
5,475,096; and in PCT publications WO 97/38134, WO 98/33941, and WO 99/07724, all<br>
of which are herein incorporated by reference), although many methods are known in the<br>
art.<br>
VII. Synthesis and Conjugation<br>
The present section provides a description of the synthesis and formation of the<br>
individual components (i.e., individual dendrimers containing one or more of the<br>
components described above) of the nanodevice and the conjugation of such components<br>
into a nanodevice (e.g., the conjugation of one or more such dendrimers to a core<br>
dendrimer).<br>
In preferred embodiments of the present invention, the preparation of PAMAM<br>
dendrimers is performed according to a typical divergent (building up the macromolecule<br>
from an initiator core) synthesis. It involves a two-step growth sequence that consists of<br>
a Michael addition of amino groups to the double bond of methyl acrylate (MA)<br>
followed by the amidation of the resulting terminal carbomethoxy, -(CO2CH3) group,<br>
with ethylenediamine (EDA). When ammonia is used as the initiator core reagent, this<br>
synthesis may be represented by reactions shown in Figure 7.<br>
In the first step of this process, ammonia is allowed to react under an inert<br>
nitrogen atmosphere with MA (molar ratio: 1:4.25) at 47 °C for 48 hours. The resulting<br>
compound is referred to as generation = 0, the star-branched PAMAM tri-ester. The next<br>
step involves reacting the tri-ester with an excess of EDA to produce the star-branched<br>
PAMAM tri-amine (G=0). This reaction is performed under an inert atmosphere<br>
(nitrogen) in methanol and requires 48 hours at 0 °C for completion. Reiteration of this<br>
Michael addition and amidation sequence produces generation = 1.<br>
Preparation of this tri-amine completes the first full cycle of the divergent<br>
synthesis of PAMAM dendrimers. Repetition of this reaction sequence results in the<br>
synthesis of larger generation (G=l-5) dendrimers (i.e., ester- and amine-terminated<br>
molecules, respectively). For example, the second iteration of this sequence produces<br>
generation 1, with an hexa-ester and hexa-amine surface, respectively. The same<br>
reactions are performed in the same way as for all subsequent generations from 1 to 9,<br>
building up layers of branch cells giving a core-shell architecture with precise molecular<br>
weights and numbers of terminal groups as shown above. Carboxylate-surfaced<br>
dendrimers can be produced by hydrolysis of ester-terminated PAMAM dendrimers, or<br>
reaction of succinic anhydride with amine-surfaced dendrimers (e.g., full generation<br>
PAMAM, POP AM or POPAM-PAMAM hybrid dendrimers).<br>
Various dendrimers can be synthesized based on the core structure that initiates<br>
the polymerization process. These core structures dictate several important characteristics<br>
of the dendrimer molecule such as the overall shape, density, and surface functionality<br>
(Tomalia et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl., 29:5305 [1990]). Spherical dendrimers<br>
derived from ammonia possess trivalent initiator cores, whereas EDA is a tetra-valent<br>
initiator core. Recently, rod-shaped dendrimers have been reported which are based upon<br>
linear poly(ethyleneimine) cores of varying lengths the longer the core, the longer the rod<br>
(Yin et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc, 120:2678 [1998]).<br>
The dendrimers may be characterized for size and uniformity by any suitable<br>
analytical techniques. These include, but are not limited to, atomic force microscopy<br>
(AFM), electrospray-ionization mass spectroscopy, MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy, 13C<br>
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, high performance liquid chromatography<br>
(HPLC) size exclusion chromatography (SEC) (equipped with multi-angle laser light<br>
scattering, dual UV and refractive index detectors), capillary electrophoresis and get<br>
electrophoresis. These analytical methods assure the uniformity of the dendrimer<br>
population and are important in the quality control of dendrimer production for eventual<br>
use in in vivo applications. Most importantly, extensive work has been performed with<br>
dendrimers showing no evidence of toxicity when administered intravenously (Roberts et<br>
al., J. Biomed. Mater. Res., 30:53 [1996] and Bourne et al., J. Magnetic Resonance<br>
Imaging, 6:305 [1996]).<br>
To produce a single dendritic device possessing the various functional modules<br>
required for active sensing, targeting, imaging and therapeutic delivery, multiple<br>
PAMAM dendrimer modules, each with an individual differentiated function are<br>
covalently bound to form a single device. This involves the synthesis of separate<br>
conjugates or nanocomposites for each of the required activities (e.g., one dendrimer<br>
conjugate for sensing, one for targeting and another for therapeutic carrier). These<br>
different dendrimers are then self-assembled and covalently linked in a manner that<br>
yields a single therapeutic device. In certain embodiments, one dendrimer acts as a core<br>
around which other dendrimers are covalently (i.e., "clustered dendrimers"). In preferred<br>
embodiments, the core dendrimer is a POPAM dendrimer, while the outer dendrimers are<br>
PAMAM dendrimers. In yet other embodiments, dendrimers may be complexed to one<br>
another without a core dendrimer (e.g., four dendrimers covalently linked to one another<br>
in a linear chain).<br>
In one preferred embodiments of the present invention the formation of clustered<br>
dendrimers involves the formation of amide bonds between the core and exterior<br>
dendrimers using the ester aminolysis technique. The ester aminolysis technique involves<br>
reacting various poly(arnidoamine) PAMAM dendrimer core reagents with an excess of<br>
ester terminated PAMAM dendrimer shell reagents in methanol at 40 °C (See e.g.,<br>
Uppuluri et al., PMSE 80:55 [1999]). In an alternative embodiment, water is employed<br>
as the reaction medium. This method involves the self-assembly of amine terminated<br>
core reagents with an excess of carboxylate shell reagent followed by addition of a<br>
coupling agent (i.e., carboimide) to produce arninde linkages between the core and the<br>
shell components. These reactions take place at room temperature. Such embodiments<br>
are preferred when the reactions are conducted in the presence of biomolecules such as<br>
antibodies.<br>
The first step in the aqueous synthesis of these molecules involves self-assembly<br>
of the shell dendrimer molecules around a core dendrimer molecule, resulting in the<br>
efficient (i.e., maximum) packing of shell molecules around the core. The self-assembled<br>
cluster, as shown in Figure 5, is representative of the precursor used to make the<br>
covalently bonded core shell clustered dendrimer. In the next step, using a coupling<br>
reagent (such as EDC, a carbodiimide reagent), the core and shell molecules are<br>
covalently linked as shown in Figure 6. The reaction progress is monitored by size<br>
exclusion chromatography (SEC) and the loss of carboxylate functionality in the infrared<br>
region (FTIR) as well as by 1H/13C NMR and gel electrophoresis. The reaction is<br>
normally complete within an hour when run at room temperature.<br>
In some embodiments of the present invention, the size and shape of these higher<br>
molecular weight products is measured and compared to individual dendrimers by atomic<br>
force microscopy (AFM) and size exclusion chromatography SEC. These techniques<br>
demonstrate that core-shell dendrimers are indeed formed. Additional evidence is<br>
obtained, as desired, by gel electrophoresis, in which a higher molecular weight product<br>
is evident when the reaction is complete. The absolute molecular weight of the clustered<br>
dendrimer is determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy or by SEC equipped with a<br>
multi-angle laser light scattering detector (MALLS).<br>
The clustered dendrimer molecules formed by this method have narrow<br>
polydispersity by SEC (similar to that of large dendrimers). It takes about 3-4 weeks to<br>
convert PAMAM dendrimers of generation 6 to generation 9, but only about 1 day to<br>
synthesize clustered dendrimers with similar size, acceptable dispersity and shape<br>
(including purification procedures).<br>
For the multi-function clustered dendrimer, any cross-linking reaction problems<br>
with the functional groups on the exterior dendrimer modules are circumvented by using<br>
standard protecting groups on the side chains that are reacting. Another solution is to use<br>
bifunctional linker strategies, e.g., first, reacting the surface of the core amino-surfaced<br>
dendrimer with 2-iminothiolane to generate a thiol surface, then reacting the product with<br>
maleimide linker groups on the shell dendrimers.<br>
As discussed above, in some embodiments of the present invention a core-shell<br>
structure is used to assemble dendritic polymer components into a single molecular<br>
complex (See e.g., Figure 10). This allows one to place each component of the<br>
nanodevice on a different polymer and assemble them as a single, supramolecular<br>
assembly. The unique aspect of this technology is that the core-shell configuration<br>
directs and limits the assembly; the larger the core and the smaller the shell molecules,<br>
the greater the number of shell dendrimers can associate with a core. For example, the<br>
core of a cluster can be generation 7, amine surfaced PAMAM dendrimer; with an<br>
approximate molecular weight of 110kDa, a 7 nm diameter and 512 surface primary<br>
amines (Tomalia et at, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., 29:138 [1990]). The shell might be made<br>
up of generation 5 carboxyl-surfaced PAMAM dendrimer, with an approximate molecular<br>
weight of 27kDa, a 5 nm diameter and 128 surface carboxyl groups. This would lead to<br>
the self-assembly (if performed in an excess of E5) of a supra-molecular complex where<br>
an average of 12 E5 molecules surround an E7 core. Figure 10 shows that steric<br>
hindrance limits the number of associated shell polymers that bind to the core.<br>
There may be problems in attempting to assemble dendrimer-based nanodevices<br>
using this approach with multifunctional groups using covalently linked PAMAM<br>
dendrimers. For example, in some embodiments, the self-assembly of these components<br>
requires different charges on the core and surface polymers. This leaves excess charge<br>
on the shell polymer that may inhibit the function of the device, particularly as relates to<br>
targeting and internalizing into cells. Also important is that after the polymers<br>
self-assembly, in some embodiments, they are covalently linked. The chemistry involved<br>
in this step can affect the functional subunits of the nanodevice and in some cases<br>
destroy them. Thus, an alternative technique should be employed to assemble the<br>
supramolecular complex.<br>
In some embodiments of the present invention, individual dendrimer components<br>
of the multi-function clustered dendrimer are assembled though the use of linkers. For<br>
example, in some embodiments, shell dendrimers are attached to a core dendrimer<br>
through linker groups using covalent or non-covalent interactions. One illustrative<br>
example of such linking is demonstrated by the use of nucleic acid linkers, which provide<br>
a number of advantages.<br>
Oligonucleotides are a powerful tool to assemble molecules in desired structural<br>
arrangements due to the ease with which they can be conjugated to other materials, the<br>
ability to hybridize with another oligonucleotide of complementary base specificity, the<br>
programmability of the sequence, and the stiffness of the resulting duplex structure.<br>
Using this concept, supramolecular core-shell structures using dendrimers and<br>
complementary oligonucleotides were created during the development of the present<br>
invention. These structures have a number of advantages over those produced with the<br>
prior assembly techniques. For example, they are self assembling at low temperature<br>
without harsh chemicals, they provide the ability to specifically couple different subunits<br>
based on different oligonucleotide complementarities, and they provide the ability to<br>
design nuclease digestion sites or other cleavable sites into the oligonucleotide couplers<br>
to make the complex "biodegradable" and allow the subunits to be excreted through the<br>
kidney (e.g., they may be designed to fall apart once they've reached the target site, such<br>
that the smaller fragments may be excreted through the kidney). Figure 11 shows a<br>
schematic dendrimer complex assembled using nucleic acid linkers. A method for<br>
preparing the complexes is provided in Example 5.<br>
The present invention is not limited by the nature of the nucleic acid used as the<br>
linker group. In some preferred embodiments, the nucleic acid attached to a dendrimer<br>
does not contain intrastrand secondary structure. However, in some embodiments<br>
secondary structure may be used to provide a desired function or property (e.g., stability,<br>
cleavage recognition site, etc.). The length of the nucleic acid linker may be selected to<br>
provide a desired distance between the core dendrimer and the shell dendrimers. In<br>
some embodiments of the present invention, nucleic acids are modified to enhance<br>
stability (e.g., in the bloodstream) and/or to facilitate entry into cells. Methods are<br>
known in the art for making such modifications. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid<br>
molecules are labeled to allow detection or localization of the assemblies.<br>
Once nucleic acid linkers are attached to the dendrimers, the dendrimer complexes<br>
may be assembled and analyzed (e.g., to assure the structures have appropriate<br>
conformations). Because of the small size of these materials, a preferred method of<br>
characterizing the assembled complexes is atomic force microscopy. Use of atomic force<br>
microscopy clearly demonstrated the presence of dendrimer supramolecular assembles<br>
that are regular combinations of three and four modules (i.e., comprised a core and<br>
multiple shell dendrimers). Analysis of a single cluster demonstrated that the distance<br>
between the two components was 21 nm; almost exactly the theoretical distance predicted<br>
from the length of the oligonucleotide hybrid. This analysis was then applied to a<br>
population of the molecules, and all were found to have distances of approximately 20<br>
nm between the components. This documented the uniformity of the supramolecular<br>
structures that were developed. Given the fact that these supramolecular assemblies can<br>
connect components in a consistent manner, they can be used for almost any type of<br>
combined delivery of material from vaccine components to drugs to imaging agents.<br>
VIE Evaluation of Anti-Tumor Efficacy and Toxicity of Nanodevice<br>
The anti-tumor effects of various therapeutic agents on cancer cell lines and<br>
primary cell cultures may be evaluated using the nanodevices of the present invention.<br>
For example, in preferred embodiments, assays are conducted, in vitro, using established<br>
tumor cell line models or primary culture cells. The use of fresh tumor cells (as opposed<br>
to cultured lines) is preferable for confirmation of toxicity testing and efficacy because it<br>
allows more relevant determinations without artifacts induced by tissue culture (e.g.,<br>
tumor cell selection, etc.).<br>
A. Quantifying the Induction of Apoptosis of Human Tumor<br>
Cells In vitro<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the nanodevices of the<br>
present invention are used to assay apoptosis of human tumor cells in vitro. Testing for<br>
apoptosis in the cells determines the efficacy of the therapeutic agent. Multiple aspects<br>
of apoptosis can and should be measured. These aspects include those described above,<br>
as well as aspects including, but are not limited to, measurement of phosphatidylserine<br>
(PS) translocation from the inner to outer surface of plasma membrane, measurement of<br>
DNA fragmentation, detection of apoptosis related proteins, and measurement of<br>
Caspase-3 activity.<br>
B. In Vitro Toxicology<br>
In some embodiments of the present invention, to gain a general perspective into<br>
the safety of a particular nanodevice platform or component of that system, toxicity<br>
testing is performed. Toxicological information may be derived from numerous sources<br>
including, but not limited to, historical databases, in vitro testing, and in vivo animal<br>
studies.<br>
In vitro toxicological methods have gained popularity in recent years due to<br>
increasing desires for alternatives to animal experimentation and an increased perception<br>
to the potential ethical., commercial., and scientific value. In vitro toxicity testing systems<br>
have numerous advantages including improved efficiency, reduced cost, and reduced<br>
variability between experiments. These systems also reduce animal usage, eliminate<br>
confounding systemic effects (e.g., immunity), and control environmental conditions.<br>
Although any in vitro testing system may be used with the present invention, the<br>
most common approach utilized for in vitro examination is the use of cultured cell<br>
models. These systems include freshly isolated cells, primary cells, or transformed cell<br>
cultures. Cell culture as the primary means of studying in vitro toxicology is<br>
advantageous due to rapid screening of multiple cultures, usefulness in identifying and<br>
assessing toxic effects at the cellular, subcellular, or molecular level. In vitro cell culture<br>
methods commonly indicate basic cellular toxicity through measurement of membrane<br>
integrity, metabolic activities, and subcellular perturbations. Commonly used indicators<br>
for membrane integrity include cell viability (cell count), clonal expansion tests, trypan<br>
blue exclusion, intracellular enzyme release {e.g., lactate dehydrogenase), membrane<br>
permeability of small ions (K1, Ca24), and intracellular accumulation of small molecules<br>
(e.g., 51Cr, succinate). Subcellular perturbations include monitoring mitochondrial<br>
enzyme activity levels via, for example, the MTT test, determining cellular adenine<br>
triphosphate (ATP) levels, neutral red uptake into lysosomes, and quantification of total<br>
protein synthesis. Metabolic activity indicators include glutathione content, lipid<br>
peroxiidation, and lactate/pyruvate ratio.<br>
C. MTT assay<br>
The MTT assay is a fast, accurate, and reliable methodology for obtaining cell<br>
viability measurements. The MTT assay was first developed by Mosmann (Mosmann, J.<br>
Immunol. Meth., 65:55 [1983]). It is a simple colorimetric assay numerous laboratories<br>
have utilized for obtaining toxicity results {See e.g., Kuhlmann et al., Arch. Toxicol.,<br>
72:536 [1998]). Briefly, the mitochondria produce ATP to provide sufficient energy for<br>
the cell. In order to do this, the mitochondria metabolize pyruvate to produce acetyl<br>
CoA. Within the mitochondria, acetyl CoA reacts with various enzymes in the<br>
tricarboxylic acid cycle resulting in subsequent production of ATP. One of the enzymes<br>
particularly useful in the MTT assay is succinate dehydrogenase. MTT<br>
(3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yi)-2 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) is a yellow substrate that is<br>
cleaved by succinate dehydrogenase forming a purple formazan product The alteration<br>
in pigment identifies changes in mitochondria function.. Nonviable cells are unable to<br>
produce formazan, and therefore, the amount produced directly correlates to the quantity<br>
of viable cells. Absorbance at 540 nm is utilized to measure the amount of formazan<br>
product.<br>
The results of the in vitro tests can be compared to in vivo toxicity tests in order<br>
to extrapolate to live animal conditions. Typically, acute toxicity from a single dose of<br>
the substance is assessed. Animals are monitored over 14 days for any signs of toxicity<br>
(increased temperature, breathing difficulty, death, etc). Traditionally, the standard of<br>
acute toxicity is the median lethal dose (LD50), which is the predicted dose at which half<br>
of the treated population would be killed. The determination of this dose occurs by<br>
exposing test animals to a geometric series of doses under controlled conditions. Other<br>
tests include subacute toxicity testing, which measures the animal's response to repeated<br>
doses of the nanodevice for no longer than 14 days. Sub-chronic toxicity testing involves<br>
testing of a repeated dose for 90 days. Chronic toxicity testing is similar to subchronic<br>
testing but may last for over a 90-day period. In vivo testing can also be conducted to<br>
determine toxicity with respect to certain tissues. For example, in some embodiments of<br>
the present invention tumor toxicity (i.e., effect of the compositions of the present<br>
invention on the survival of tumor tissue) is determined (e.g., by detecting changes in the<br>
size and/or growth of tumor tissues).<br>
IX. Gene Therapy Vectors<br>
In particular embodiments of the present invention, the nanodevice compositions<br>
comprise transgenes for delivery and expression to a target cell or tissue, in vitro, ex<br>
vivo, or in vivo. In such embodiments, rather than containing the actual protein, the<br>
dendrimer complex comprises an expression vector construct containing, for example, a<br>
heterologous DNA encoding a gene of interest and the various regulatory elements that<br>
facilitate the production of the particular protein of interest in the target cells.<br>
In some embodiments, the gene is a therapeutic gene that is used, for example, to<br>
treat cancer, to replace a defective gene, or a marker or reporter gene that is used for<br>
selection or monitoring purposes. In the context of a gene therapy vector, the gene may<br>
be a heterologous piece of DNA. The heterologous DNA may be derived from more<br>
than one source (i.e., a multigene construct or a fusion protein). Further, the<br>
heterologous DNA may include a regulatory sequence derived from one source and the<br>
gene derived from a different source.<br>
Tissue-specific promoters may be used to effect transcription in specific tissues or<br>
cells so as to reduce potential toxicity or undesirable effects to non-targeted tissues. For<br>
example, promoters such as the PSA, probasin, prostatic acid phosphatase or<br>
prostate-specific glandular kallikrein (hK2) may be used to target gene expression in the<br>
prostate. Similarly, promoters may be used to target gene expression in other tissues<br>
(e.g., insulin, elastin amylase, pdr-1, pdx-1 and glucokinase promoters target to the<br>
pancreas; albumin PEPCK, HBV enhancer, alpha fetoproteinapolipoprotein C, alpha-1<br>
antitrypsin, vitellogenin, NF-AB and transthyretin promoters target to the liver; myosin H<br>
chain, muscle creatine kinase, dystrophin, calpain p94, skeletal alpha-actin, fast troponin<br>
1 promoters target to skeletal muscle; keratin promoters target the skin; sm22 alpha;<br>
SM-α-actin promoters target smooth muscle; CFTR; human cytokeratin 18 (K18);<br>
pulmonary surfactant proteins A, B and Q CC-10; P1 promoters target lung tissue;<br>
endothelin-1; E-selectin; von Willebrand factor; KDR/flk-1 target the endothelium;<br>
tyrosinase targets melanocytes).<br>
The nucleic acid may be either cDNA or genomic DNA. The nucleic acid can<br>
encode any suitable therapeutic protein. Preferably, the nucleic acid encodes a tumor<br>
suppressor, cytokine, receptor, inducer of apoptosis, or differentiating agent. The nucleic<br>
acid may be an antisense nucleic acid. In such embodiments, the antisense nucleic acid<br>
may be incorporated into the nanodevice of the present invention outside of the context<br>
of an expression vector.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the nucleic acid encodes a tumor suppressor, cytokines,<br>
receptors, or inducers of apoptosis. Suitable tumor suppressors include BRCA1, BRCA2,<br>
C-CAM, pl6, p211 p53, p73, or Rb. Suitable cytokines include GMCSF, IL-1, IL-2,<br>
IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-11, IL-12, IL-13, IL-14, IL-15,<br>
βMnteferon, γ-interferon, or TNF. Suitable receptors include CFTR, EGFR, estrogen<br>
receptor, IL-2 receptor, or VEGFR. Suitable inducers of apoptosis include AdE1B, Bad,<br>
Bak, Bax, Bid, Bik, Bim, Harakiri, or ICE-CED3 protease.<br>
X. Methods of Combined Therapy<br>
Tumor cell resistance to DNA damaging agents represents a major problem in<br>
clinical oncology. The nanodevices of the present invention provide means of<br>
ameliorating this problem by effectively administering a combined therapy approach.<br>
However, it should be noted that traditional combination therapy may be employed in<br>
combination with the nanodevices of the present invention. For example, in some<br>
embodiments of the present invention, nanodevices may be used before, after, or in<br>
combination with the traditional therapies.<br>
To kill cells, inhibit cell growth, or metastasis, or angiogenesis, or otherwise<br>
reverse or reduce the malignant phenotype of tumor cells using the methods and<br>
compositions of the present invention in combination therapy, one contacts a "target" cell<br>
with the nanodevices compositions described herein and at least one other agent. These<br>
compositions are provided in a combined amount effective to kill or inhibit proliferation<br>
of the cell. This process may involve contacting the cells with the immunotherapeutic<br>
agent and the agent(s) or factor(s) at the same time. This may be achieved by contacting<br>
the cell with a single composition or pharmacological formulation that includes both<br>
agents, or by contacting the cell with two distinct compositions or formulations, at the<br>
same time, wherein one composition includes, for example, an expression construct and<br>
the other includes a therapeutic agent<br>
Alternatively, the nanodevice treatment may precede or follow the other agent<br>
treatment by intervals ranging from minutes to weeks. In embodiments where the other<br>
agent and immunotherapy are applied separately to the cell, one would generally ensure<br>
that a significant period of time did not expire between the time of each delivery, such<br>
that the agent and nanodevice would still be able to exert an advantageously combined<br>
effect on the cell. In such instances, it is contemplated that cells are contacted with both<br>
modalities within about 12-24 hours of each other and, more preferably, within about<br>
6-12 hours of each other, with a delay time of only about 12 hours being most preferred.<br>
In some situations, it may be desirable to extend the time period for treatment<br>
significantly, however, where several days (2 to 7) to several weeks (1 to 8) lapse<br>
between the respective administrations.<br>
In some embodiments, more than one administration of the immunotherapeutic<br>
composition of the present invention or the other agent are utilized. Various<br>
combinations may be employed, where nanodevice is "A" and the other agent is "B", as<br>
exemplified below:<br>
A/B/A, B/A/B, B/B/A, A/A/B, B/A/A, A/B/B, B/B/B/A, B/B/A/B,<br>
A/A/B/B, A/B/A/B, A/B/B/A, B/B/A/A, B/A/B/A, B/A/A/B, B/B/B/A,<br>
A/A/A/B, B/A/A/A, A/B/A/A, A/A/B/A, A/B/B/B, B/A/B/B, B/B/A/B<br>
Other combinations are contemplated. Again, to achieve cell killing, both agents are<br>
delivered to a cell in a combined amount effective to kill or disable the cell.<br>
Other factors that may be used in combination therapy with the nanodevices of<br>
the present invention include, but are not limited to, factors that cause DNA damage such<br>
as y-rays, X-rays, and/or the directed delivery of radioisotopes to tumor cells. Other<br>
forms of DNA damaging factors are also contemplated such as microwaves and<br>
UV-irradiation. Dosage ranges for X-rays range from daily doses of 50 to 200 roentgens<br>
for prolonged periods of time (3 to 4 weeks), to single doses of 2000 to 6000 roentgens.<br>
Dosage ranges for radioisotopes vary widely, and depend on the half-life of the isotope,<br>
the strength and type of radiation emitted, and the uptake by the neoplastic cells. The<br>
skilled artisan is directed to "Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences" 15th Edition, chapter<br>
33, in particular pages 624-652. Some variation in dosage will necessarily occur<br>
depending on the condition of the subject being treated. The person responsible for<br>
administration will, in any event, determine the appropriate dose for the individual<br>
subject. Moreover, for human administration, preparations should meet sterility,<br>
pyrogenicity, general safety and purity standards as required by FDA Office of Biologics<br>
standards.<br>
In preferred embodiments of the present invention, the regional delivery of the<br>
nanodevice to patients with cancers is utilized to maximize the therapeutic effectiveness<br>
of the delivered agent. Similarly, the chemo- or radiotherapy may be directed to<br>
particular, affected region of the subjects body. Alternatively, systemic delivery of the<br>
immunotherapeutic composition and/or the agent may be appropriate in certain<br>
circumstances, for example, where extensive metastasis has occurred.<br>
In addition to combining the nanodevice with chemo- and radiotherapies, it also is<br>
contemplated that traditional gene therapies are used. For example, targeting of p53 or<br>
pl6 mutations along with treatment of the nanodevices provides an improved anti-cancer<br>
treatment. The present invention contemplates the co-treatment with other tumor-related<br>
genes including, but not limited to, p21, Rb, APC, DCC, NF-I, NF-2, BCRA2, p16,<br>
FHIT, WT-I, MEN-I, MEN-II, BRCA1, VHL, FCC, MCC, ras, myc, neu, raf. erb, src,<br>
fins, jun, trk, ret, gsp, hst, bcl, and abl.<br>
In vivo and ex vivo treatments are applied using the appropriate methods worked<br>
out for the gene delivery of a particular construct for a particular subject. For example,<br>
for viral vectors, one typically delivers 1 x 104, 1 x 10s, 1 x 106, 1 x 107, 1 x 108, 1 x<br>
109, 1 x 1010, 1 x 1011 or 1 x 1012 infectious particles to the patient. Similar figures may<br>
be extrapolated for liposomal or other non-viral formulations by comparing relative<br>
uptake efficiencies.<br>
An attractive feature of the present invention is that the therapeutic compositions<br>
may be delivered to local sites in a patient by a medical device. Medical devices that are<br>
suitable for use in the present invention include known devices for the localized delivery<br>
of therapeutic agents. Such devices include, but are not limited to, catheters such as<br>
injection catheters, balloon catheters, double balloon catheters, microporous balloon<br>
catheters, channel balloon catheters, infusion catheters, perfusion catheters, etc., which<br>
are, for example, coated with the therapeutic agents or through which the agents are<br>
administered; needle injection devices such as hypodermic needles and needle injection<br>
catheters; needleless injection devices such as jet injectors; coated stents, bifurcated<br>
stmts, vascular grafts, stent grafts, etc.; and coated vaso-occlusive devices such as wire<br>
coils.<br>
Exemplary devices are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,935,114; 5,908,413;<br>
5,792,105; 5,693,014; 5,674,192; 5,876,445; 5,913,894; 5,868,719; 5,851,228; 5,843,089;<br>

(Boston Scientific Corporation) and the NIR (Medinol Inc.). Such devices are delivered<br>
to and/or implanted at target locations within the body by known techniques.<br>
XL Photodynamic Therapy<br>
In some embodiments, the therapeutic complexes of the present invention<br>
comprise a photodynamic compound and a targeting agent that is administred to a<br>
patient. In some embodiments, the targeting agent is then allowed a period of time to<br>
bind the 'target' cell (e.g. about 1 minute to 24 hours) resulting in the formation of a<br>
target cell-target agent complex, In some embodiments, the therapeutic complexes<br>
comprising the targeting agent and photodynamic compound are then illuminated (e.g.,<br>
with a red laser, incandescent lamp, X-rays, or filtered sunlight). In some embodiments,<br>
the light is aimed at the jugular vein or some other superficial blood or lymphatic vessel.<br>
In some embodiments, the singlet oxygen and free radicals diffuse from the<br>
photodynamic compound to the target cell (e.g. cancer cell or pathogen) causing its<br>
destruction.<br>
XII. Pharmaceutical Formulations<br>
Where clinical applications are contemplated, in some embodiments of the present<br>
invention, the nanodevices are prepared as part of a pharmaceutical composition in a<br>
form appropriate for the intended application. Generally, this entails preparing<br>
compositions that are essentially free of pyrogens, as well as other impurities that could<br>
be harmful to humans or animals. However, in some embodiments of the present<br>
invention, a straight dendrimer formulation may be administered using one or more of<br>
the routes described herein.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the nanodevices are used in conjunction with<br>
appropriate salts and buffers to render delivery of the compositions in a stable manner to<br>
allow for uptake by target cells. Buffers also are employed when the nanodevices are<br>
introduced into a patient. Aqueous compositions comprise an effective amount of the<br>
nanodevice to cells dispersed in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or aqueous<br>
medium. Such compositions also are referred to as inocula. The phrase<br>
"pharmaceutically or pharmacologically acceptable" refer to molecular entities and<br>
compositions that do not produce adverse, allergic, or other untoward reactions when<br>
administered to an animal or a human. As used herein, pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carrier" includes any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and<br>
antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents and the like. Except insofar as<br>
any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the vectors or cells of the present<br>
invention, its use in therapeutic compositions is contemplated. Supplementary active<br>
ingredients may also be incorporated into the compositions.<br>
In some embodiments of the present invention, the active compositions include<br>
classic pharmaceutical preparations. Administration of these compositions according to<br>
the present invention is via any common route so long as the target tissue is available via<br>
that route. This includes oral., nasal., buccal., rectal., vaginal or topical. Alternatively,<br>
administration may be by orthotopic, intradermal., subcutaneous, intramuscular,<br>
intraperitoneal or intravenous injection.<br>
The active nanodevices may also be administered parenterally or intraperitoneally<br>
or intratumorally. Solutions of the active compounds as free base or pharmacologically<br>
acceptable salts are prepared in water suitably mixed with, a surfactant, such as<br>
hydroxypropylcellulose. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid<br>
polyethylene glycols, and mixtures thereof and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of<br>
storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of<br>
microorganisms.<br>
The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous<br>
solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile<br>
injectable solutions or dispersions. The carrier may be a solvent or dispersion medium<br>
containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol,<br>
and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable<br>
oils. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating, such<br>
as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and<br>
by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be<br>
brought about by various antibacterial an antifungal agents, for example, parabens,<br>
chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal., and the like. In many cases, it may be<br>
preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars or sodium chloride. Prolonged<br>
absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the<br>
compositions of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and<br>
gelatin.<br>
Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the active compounds in<br>
the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various of the other ingredients<br>
enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions<br>
are prepared by incorporating the various sterilized active ingredients into a sterile<br>
vehicle which contains the basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients<br>
from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of<br>
sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum-drying and<br>
freeze-drying techniques which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any<br>
additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof.<br>
Upon formulation, the dendrimer compositions are administered in a manner<br>
compatible with the dosage formulation and in such amount as is therapeutically<br>
effective. The formulations are easily administered in a variety of dosage forms such as<br>
injectable solutions, drug release capsules and the tike. For parenteral administration in<br>
an aqueous solution, for example, the solution is suitably buffered, if necessary, and the<br>
liquid diluent first rendered isotonic with sufficient saline or glucose. These particular<br>
aqueous solutions are especially suitable for intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous and<br>
intraperitoneal administration. For example, one dosage could be dissolved in 1 ml of<br>
isotonic NaCl solution and either added to 1000 ml of hypodermoclysis fluid or injected<br>
at the proposed site of infusion, (see for example, "Remington's Pharmaceutical<br>
Sciences" 15th Edition, pages 1035-1038 and 1570-1580). In some embodiments of the<br>
present invention, the active particles or agents are formulated within a therapeutic<br>
mixture to comprise about 0.0001 to 1.0 milligrams, or about 0.001 to 0.1 milligrams, or<br>
about 0.1 to 1.0 or even about 10 milligrams per dose or so. Multiple doses may be<br>
administered.<br>
Additional formulations that are suitable for other modes of administration include<br>
vaginal suppositories and pessaries. A rectal pessary or suppository may also be used.<br>
Suppositories are solid dosage forms of various weights and shapes, usually medicated,<br>
for insertion into the rectum, vagina or the urethra. After insertion, suppositories soften,<br>
melt or dissolve in the cavity fluids. In general., for suppositories, traditional binders and<br>
carriers may include, for example, polyalkylene glycols or triglycerides; such<br>
suppositories may be formed from mixtures containing the active ingredient in the range<br>
of 0.5% to 10%, preferably l%-2%. Vaginal suppositories or pessaries are usually<br>
globular or oviform and weighing about 5 g each. Vaginal medications are available in a<br>
variety of physical forms, e.g., creams, gels or liquids, which depart from the classical<br>
concept of suppositories. In addition, suppositories may be used in connection with<br>
colon cancer. The nanodevices also may be formulated as inhalants for the treatment of<br>
lung cancer and such like.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
The following examples are provided to demonstrate and further illustrate certain<br>
preferred embodiments of the present invention and are not to be construed as limiting<br>
the scope thereof.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Quantitative MTT Biocompatibility/Cytotoxicity Assays<br>
This Example describes quantitative MTT biocompatibility/cytotoxicity assays in<br>
both mouse and rat primary fibroblasts to measure cytotoxicity of various individual<br>
dendrimers and core-shell dendrimer molecules. In particular, the cytotoxicity of<br>
PAMAM dendrimers (G5 and G7 generations), POPAM dendrimers (generations 2, 3,<br>
and 4), and core-shell dendrimer molecules (i.e., POPAM 'core' dendrimer molecules<br>
covalently linked to 2 or 3 PAMAM 'shell' dendrimers) were analyzed employing a<br>
standard quantitative MTT assay (See Kuhlmann et al., 1998; Sladowski et al., 1993;<br>
Wang et al., 1996; Watanabe et al., 1994).<br>
Briefly, both the mouse and rat primary fibroblasts were cultured for 24 hours<br>
with MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yi)-2 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide), and either<br>
PAMAM dendrimers, POMAM dendrimers, or the core-shell dendrimer molecules. The<br>
quantity of viable cells was then measured by absorbance at 540 nm in order to detect<br>
the fonnazan product (purple) resulting from the cleavage of MTT (yellow) present only<br>
in viable cells.<br>
The results of these assays revealed a sharp distinction between the cytotoxicity of<br>
the POPAM dendrimers and both the PAPAM dendrimers and the core-shell dendrimers<br>
of the present invention. Specifically, the PAPAM dendrimers (G5 and G7 generations)<br>
assayed produced no significant in vitro cytotoxicity at concentrations up to 40 jig/ml. In<br>
contrast, the three types of POPAM dendrimers (generations 2, 3, and 4) induced<br>
concentration-related cytotoxic effects with CL50 concentrations of 40, 12, and 12 μg/ml<br>
respectively for murine fibroblasts, and 30, 9, and 9 ug/ml respectively for rat<br>
fibroblasts. Interestingly, the core-shell dendrimer molecules did not share the<br>
cytotoxicity problems of POPAM dendrimers as only concentrations of the core-shell<br>
dendrimers higher than 30 μg/ml produced detectable toxicity, with only 5-10% of the<br>
cells killed after 24 hours exposure to 40 ug/ml. These results demonstrate the favorable<br>
biocompatability properties of the core-shell dendrimer molecules of the present<br>
invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Construction of a Multifunctional Dendrimer Molecule<br>
This example describes the construction of a multifunctional dendrimer molecule<br>
with both targeting and signaling units. In particular, this example describes the<br>
construction of a generation 5 (G5) PAMAM dendrimer conjugated to folic acid and<br>
fluorescein where remaining amino surface groups on the dendrimer are 'capped' with<br>
acetic anhydride or glycidol.<br>
The schematic for production of the dendrimers if provided in Figure 8.<br>
Conjugation of the G5 PAMAM dendrimers was carried out by reacting G5 PAMAM G5<br>
with fluorescein isothiocyanate and N(Et)3. This fluorescein construct was then reacted<br>
with folic acid and EDC. Reaction of the remaining amino surface groups of the product<br>
with either acetic anhydride or glycidol resulted in their conversion to acetamido or<br>
bis(2,3-hydroxypropyl)amino moieties, respectively. These biologically- and charge-<br>
neutral "capping" groups gave the folate/fluorescein products and high aqueous solubility.<br>
G5 PAMAM dendrimers were purified via ultrafiltration of pH-neutralized material in<br>
1:1 DMSO/water.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
In vitro Screening Assays<br>
The toxicity and efficacy of the nanodevices of the present invention may be<br>
assayed in vitro. In preferred embodiments, the nanodevices are tested in cell culture<br>
models. For example, the efficacy of nanodevice for diagnosing, monitoring, and<br>
treating breast cancer may assayed in breast cancer cell lines. For example, dendrimers<br>
that target breast cancer cells are generated by conjugating ligands or antibodies that<br>
specifically recognize receptors over-expressed by a particular breast cancer cell line.<br>
For example, the SUM-52 cell line has an amplification of and over-expresses the FGFR-<br>
2, c-MET, and NCAM-1 genes. The products of all of these genes are expressed to high<br>
levels on the surface of SUM-52 cells and are not expressed to appreciable levels on<br>
normal cells, or on other breast cancer cells. Libraries of dendrimers containing<br>
candidate binding partners for any of these surface exposed factors are exposed to the<br>
cells and candidate with specific and high binding affinity are identified. Similar assays<br>
may be conducted with imaging components, therapeutic components, and the like. For<br>
example, a library of dendrimers comprising different therapeutic agents are exposed to<br>
the cell line. The ability of the agent to alter cell growth or kill the cell, while not<br>
harming normal cells is screened. Ideally, such assays are conducted in multi-well plates<br>
to allow the screening of large numbers of candidates simultaneouly or in a short time<br>
period. In preferred embodiments, the screening assays are automated. For example,<br>
screening for anti-cancer compounds that induce apoptosis can be automated by<br>
providing a system for detecting the colorimetric changes induced by apoptosis (e.g.,<br>
colorimetric changes caused by the imaging components of the present invention, as<br>
described above).<br>
Any number of cell lines may be used in the screening assays. For example, for<br>
breast cancer, the cell lines SUM-190 and SUM-225 have an amplification of and<br>
overexpress HER-2. Thus, antibodies, such as the humanized version of 4D5 (herceptin),<br>
can be used to target dendrimers specifically to these cells. SUM-149, SUM-159, and<br>
SUM-229 all over-express the EGFR. Thus, EGR, TGF-α, or amphiregulin are used to<br>
target dendrimers to these cells. SUM-44 cells express HER-4 and thus are trageted<br>
using heregulin-dendrimer conjugates. A variety of human mammary cell lines available<br>
from ATCC may be used as controls including BT20, MCF7, UACC-893, and<br>
UACC812. These cells differ in the expression of HER-2 and MUC1. Screening assays<br>
may be performed in isolated cell populations and mixed cell populations.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Killing of Drug-resistant Cells<br>
This example describes the killing of cisplatin resistant cell using cisplatin<br>
conjugated to dendrimers. In these experiments, cell viability was assessed using the<br>
tetrazolium-based colorimetric MTT assay (discussed in more detail below) (Mosmann, J.<br>
Immunol. Meth., 65:55 [1983]). Human cell line 16N2 was grown in serum free, Ham's<br>
F-12 medium supplemented with 5% BSA, insulin, and hydrocortisone. Cells were<br>
seeded in 96-well microtitre plates at 1 x 104/well. After 24 hours, the medium was<br>
changed and cisplatin (Stem Chemicals) or Dendrimer/Platin conjugates were added to<br>
the wells. Cell viability was evaluated after 72 hours by MTT assay. The results are<br>
shown in Figure 9. In Figure 9, drug concentration is expressed in platinum equivalents.<br>
Results are expressed as a percentage of the dead cells with respect to control cells<br>
grown in the absence of drug. Data represent mean +/- SEM (n=4). The Polymer 1 and<br>
Polymer 2 samples are both generation 3.5 PAMAM dendrimers conjugated with<br>
different content of platinum (E3.5-COONa:Pt with 19.25 and 20.26% of Pt,<br>
respectively). The hydrogel compound is a generation 4 PAMAM dendrimer conjugated<br>
with Pt (E4NH2:Pt gel containing 6.25% Pt).<br>
Example 5<br>
Methods for Preparing Oligonucleotide/Dendrimer Supramolecular Assemblies<br>
As a first step toward controlling the oligonucleotides conjugation to the surface<br>
primary amino groups of the dendrimers, partial and complete modification of amines<br>
with acetic anhydride was performed. The number of the amino groups before and after<br>
conjugation was determined by 1H NMR and potentiometric titration.<br>
I) Complete acetamide capping of G7 and G5 PAMAM by N-acetylation<br>
A dendrimer stock solution (10 wt% in MeOH; 0.05g, 0.43 μmol) was placed in a<br>
25 mL round-bottom flask flushed with dry nitrogen, and 4 times molar excess of acetic<br>
anhydride was added dropwise at 4°C. Triethylamine base (Aldrich) (0.23g; 2.3mmol)<br>
was added to the reaction mixture with mild stirring at room temperature for 24 hours,<br>
followed by addition of 1mL of MeOH (Aldrich, 99.8%) to dilute the mixture. This<br>
solution was then allowed to react at room temperature for 24 hours. The product<br>
solution was rotary evaporated to remove MeOH and transferred to 3.5k MWCO dialysis<br>
tubing (Spectrum). It was then dialyzed against double distilled water (18.2MQ, MiliQ)<br>
for 3 days, replacing the DI water 5 times during this period. After dialysis, the sample<br>
was freeze-dried at -52°C for 24 hours to yield white power (57mg, 94%). The product<br>
was analyzed by 1H-NMR.<br>
2) Determination of actual number of terminal amino groups of G7 and G5.<br>
The potentiometric titration of an aqueous solution of intact G7 and G5<br>
dendrimers was performed using a Corning 420 pH meter with a Corning glass<br>
combination electrode at 20°C. In brief, lyophilized G7 and G5 dendrimers were<br>
dissolved respectively at 10 mL of 0.1N NaCl solution to prevent any electrostatic<br>
interactions within the dendrimers caused by strong positive charges of amino group (See<br>
e.g., Kabanov et al., Macromolecules 32:1904 [1999]). The dendrimers were fully<br>
protonated by the addition of a 0. IN HC1 standard solution (Aldrich), then titrated with<br>
0.1N NaOH standard solution at 3 min time intervals to achieve constancy to measure pH<br>
values.<br>
3) Partial acetamide capping of G7 and G5 PAMAM by stoichiometric<br>
N-acetylation<br>
Using the actual number of primary NH2 group on the surface of dendrimers, the<br>
molar ratio of acetic anhydride to the amino groups was determined and reacted at same<br>
method mentioned above. Each of core and shell dendrimer was expected to have 89%<br>
and 90 % acetamide capping respectively by the addition of 89% of acetic anhydride to<br>
the amino groups in terms of molar ratio. Table 1 summarized the stochiometry of the<br>
partial acetylation for G7 and G5 PAMAM dendrimers.<br><br>
4) Sequence design<br>
The first 16 nucleotides of a 50-base oligomer served as a spacer and the last 34<br>
serve as a recognition element for the complementary target sequence. Sequences were<br>
selected such that on hybridization, recognition segments of the linkage could link the<br>
core and shell dendrimers tightly together. In addition, the recognition segment was<br>
designed to be cut by Sfil restriction enzyme so that any fragmentation pattern of this<br>
tectodendrimer may be observed from use in vivo. The sequence analysis of the core<br>
and shell oligonucleotides is as follows from the data of Vector NTI system.<br><br>
This construct virtually eliminates hairpin formations in either<br>
oligonucleotide and dramatically reduces the potential for core/core and shell/shell<br>
hybridization. It also allows for more precise control of core/shell hybridization<br>
using the differential of the Tm of the core/shell hybrid vs. the core/core or<br>
shell/shell hybrids. This will further reduce the incidence of unwanted crosslinking<br>
(gel formation). Furthermore, addition of extra nucleotides on the 3' end of and<br>
between the restriction sites should improve the ability of Sfil to recognize and cut<br>
the dsDNA recognition site during in vivo linker accessibility/degradation testing.<br>
Thus, the theoretical formation of core/shell dimer was assumed as follows.<br>
