				<td>PLASTIC AEROSOL CONTAINER AND METHOD OF MANUFACTURING SAME<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a container formed of plastics material, preferably PET, and which is adapted to dispense pressurised or aerosol products. The present invention also relates to a method of manufacturing such a container.<br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
Containers for dispensing pressurised products have been, to date, primarily constructed of metal, hi particular, a metal body, of substantially cylindrical shape, is formed having a seam along its length. Metal end closures, one having a manually actuable valve device, are affixed to the ends of the cylindrical shape container, and crimped thereto.<br>
Such metal containers have a number of inherent shortcomings. They are prone to rust when in contact with water and are prone to internal corrosion unless provided with an appropriate coating which is compatible with the product to be dispensed or the formulations to be dispensed are prepared in such a Avay as to prevent corrosion. In use, they are liable to become easily damaged, and/or, damage a substrate surface if they may be accidentally dropped thereon. This is particularly a problem when such containers are commonly used in household applications, and can be easily dropped on tiled surfaces, which may then be easily chipped or damaged.<br>
The deficiencies of such prior art metal containers have resulted in some relatively unsuccessful efforts to replace the metal container with a container formed of plastics.<br>
For example, US Patent No. 6390326 discloses an aerosol container in which is of plastics material, having a body and a shaped neck, formed by blow moulding a plastics preform. A metal collar is then mounted to the neck, and a valve device is engaged with the collar. The drawback of using such an arrangement is that, prior to supply of the product to be dispensed within the container body, the metal collar is required to be carefully placed to<br>
 <br>
rest about the neck. As the container is transported to the packaging plant and/or along the assembly line for supply of a product thereinto, the metal collar is prone to be very easily bumped from its desired position, with the consequence that the valve device cannot then be properly attached thereto.<br>
This therefore identifies a need for an improved aerosol container which has the advantage of being fabricated of plastics material, but which overcomes the disadvantages such known prior art plastic containers.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention seeks to provide a plastics aerosol container which overcomes the disadvantages of prior art aerosol containers.<br>
The present invention seeks to overcome the disadvantages of the prior art by providing a collar which is formed of plastics material and which is snap-fitted to the neck of the body such that it does not become dislodged from its position during transport or during the filling process of the aerosol product, as happens with the device of US 6390326.<br>
The present invention also seeks to provide a plastics aerosol container which is substantially formed of recyclable plastics material, such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET).<br>
The present invention also seeks to provide a method of manufacturing such a plastics aerosol container.<br>

Figures 9{a)(iv) and 9(b)(iv) show detailed enlargements of portions L and N of Figures 9(a)(iii) and 9(b)(iii), respectively.<br>
Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiment<br>
Throughout the drawings, like numerals will be used to identify similar features, except where expressly otherwise indicated.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, a container, generally designated by the numeral 1, is formed of plastics material and has a body portion 2, a collar 3, a valving mechanism 4, and a cap or closure 5.<br>
The body portion 2 is formed to have a base 6 at a first end thereof, and a neck portion 7 at a second end thereof. The body 2, including its base and neck portion, are all integrally formed by stretch blow moulding plastics material, such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) from a preform, such as shown in Figure 8.<br>
Figure 2 (a) shows the container after blow moulding but before the neck is trimmed, whilst Figure 2(b) shows the same container after the neck is trimmed. It will be noted from the elevational view of the body portion 2, illustrated in Figure 2, that the upper or neck portion 7 of the body of the container is formed having various discrete features including a rebated portion 8 to which the cap 5 may be neatly fitted to the container, an annular recess 9 to which the collar 3, shown in Figure 3, is adapted to engage, and one or more ribs 19 (either outwardly or inwardly protruding)which may act as alternative engagement points for the cap or closure or other components and/or as strengthening ribs to provide structural rigidity to the container, particularly when pressurised. An opening 10 is formed in the top of the neck 7, to receive the dispensing valve (described hereinafter).<br>
 <br>
The collar, illustrated by reference numeral 3, in Figures 3 and 6, is formed by injection moulding from pJasti.es material, and is shaped to preferably be snap-fitted to the shaped neck of the body 2 about the opening 10. This is formed by the provision of an annular recess 9 on the neck of the body, which is adapted to engage an annular lip protruding inwardly from the inner surface of the collar 3, perhaps best illustrated in Figure 6(a). The collar is preferably formed of plastics material and has the characteristics of being strong and rigid with some degree of flexibility, such that it provides strength to the neck 7 of the bod}' 2, which is important when housing a pressurised product, whilst having some degree of flexibility to enable it to be snap-fitted to the neck 7 of the body 2. Suitable materials will become apparent to persons skilled in the art.<br>
Once the collar 3 is positioned about the neck 7, a dispensing valve 4, as illustrated in Figure 4, may be attached by being compressed therearound. The dispensing valve is of the conventional type of dispensing valve used in prior art metal aerosol containers. It is preferably formed of metal or like malleable material, and provided with an outer flange 11 which is shaped to fit about and be retained to the collar 3 by being compressed therearound. The lower portion 12 of the dispensing valve is adapted to fit within the opening 10 of the container 2.<br>
It should be noted that the upper portion 13 of the neck of the container 2 may be provided with an outwardly disposed protrusion, formed by a defined lip, an outward taper andVor gradual enlargement of the neck, such that, when it is cut (as shown in Figure 2(b), there is a slight outward protrusion, which the collar 3 can ride over in a manner to cause fitting of the collar 3 to the neck 13. In one embodiment, the upper portion of the neck may be cut from the preform in a way in which it slightly protrudes and the outer portion of the flange 11 can fit about the protruding neck 13. An annular recess 9 may alternatively or additionally be provided about the neck of the container 2, adapted to cooperate in snap-fitting engagement with the annular protrusion 15 provided on the inner surface of the collar 3.<br>
A seal 14 is also preferably provided "between the engaging portions of the neck 13 and the dispensing valve 4, such as illustrated by reference numeral 14. This is provided to prevent<br>
 <br>
leakage of the product between the collar and the neck. More detailed views of the body and the collar are shown in Figure 5.<br>
Figure 7 illustrates various embodiments of caps, closures or lids 20, which may be engaged with an upper portion of the container 2. Figure 7(a)(i), 7(b)(i) and 7(c)(i) illustrate elevational views of various forms of caps which are of slightly different diameters and which engage slightly differently to the container. Specifically, the cap 20 of Figures 7 (a) is of equivalent diameter to the container 2, and is engaged by finger(s) 21 contacting the neck of the container, whilst Figures 7(b) and 7(c) show how the cap 20 may engage a rib 19 provided on the upper portion of the container by an appropriately positioned lip 21.<br>
Figure 8 illustrates a preform, from which the container 2 of the present invention may be stretch blow moulded. It has a pair of annular protruding rings 16 and 17 therearound which are used for gripping purposes. Once the container is stretch blow moulded, the container shown in Figure 2(a) is cut off at a position approximately indicated by reference numeral 18 to achieve the container shown in Figure 2(b), the upper portion of the blow moulded preform then being discarded or recycled.<br>
Figure 9 illustrates, in Figures 9(a) and 9(b), various alternative arrangements for the base 6 of the container 1. Figure 9(a) shows a champagne base with a cap 22 being attached, by, for example, snap fitting to a suitable attachment, as best illustrated in Figure 9(a)(iv). Figure 9(b) illustrates an alternative arrangement, whereby the base is more simply formed as a ribbed champagne base, with strengthening ribs 23 appropriately positioned therearound.<br>
It will be appreciated that the container described in the present invention has advantages over conventional type metal aerosol containers. It will also be appreciated that whilst particular embodiments have been hereinbefore described, variations and modifications may be made to the shape and configuration thereto, still achieving advantages to the invention. Such variations and modifications should be considered to be within the scope of the invention as hereinbefore described.<br>
 <br>
It would also be appreciated that the method of manufacturing the container has significant advantages over prior art methods of manufacturing aerosol type containers.<br>
hi the assembly of the container, it will be appreciated that firstly, a preform, such as shown in Figure 8, is made by the process or injection moulding. The container is then stretch blow moulded from the preform, to achieve the container shown in Figure 2(a). The top of the preform, that is, the extremity of the neck, can be cut, using a laser cutter, rotary knives or any other cutting mechanism. The cut portion may be discarded or recycled. The container with the extremity of the neck cut therefrom is shown in Figure 2(b). A collar, such as shown in Figure 3, may then be attached by snap fitting the collar to the top of the container. By the snap fitting of the collar to the container, the collar is not prone to be easily bumped off the top of the container during the on-going manufacturing/assembling process. This was a significant disadvantage of the metal collared prior ail product shown in the aforementioned US Patent. That is, the metal collar of the afore mentioned US Patent simply rests atop the neck of the container and is liable to be easily bumped or removed during the filling/ assembly process.<br>
Once the collar is attached to the top of the container, product maybe supplied into the container, and the dispensing valve, such as shown in Figure 4, may be attached and compressed around the collar for securement thereto. A closure 20 may then be applied to the top of the container, such as shown in Figure 7, as may a base, as shown in Figure 9, and any associated labelling may then be applied to the plastics aerosol container.<br>
Obviously the plastics aerosol container of the present invention will be capable of dispensing a variety of products, including all products known to be currently dispensed from metal aerosol containers. The plastics aerosol container, formed of PET material, however, has the significant advantage that it can be readily recycled, and is thus more environmentally<br>
friendly.<br>
 <br>
It will be appreciated that numerous variations and modifications may also be made to the method of manufacture of the plastics aerosol container, and the filling of the plastics aerosol container. All such variations and modifications should be considered to fall within the scope of the invention as broadly hereinbefore described and as hereinafter claimed.<br>
