APPARATUS, KIT AND METHOD FOR ROLLER CHAIN ASSEMBLY<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the assembly of products requiring multiple assembly stations.  More particularly, the present invention relates to equipment and methods for the assembly of roller chain and roller link products.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Many assembled products require that different parts be assembled together at a plurality of work or assembly stations in a production line.  One example of such a product is roller chain, where the various components of the chain are added one piece at a time, and then pressed together, for example, to assemble the complete chain.  Many of such products are made in different sizes for different end uses.  For example, different roller chains may have a variety of pitches, that is, the distance between the centerlines of adjacent rollers, calling for different lengths of top, bottom and link plates.  The distance between the pressing mechanisms relates to the pitch of the chain.  With different pitches and lengths of link plates, it is necessary that the different pressing mechanisms be spaced apart at specific distances varying with the product.  Thus, in a typical manufacturing operation, several assembly lines had to be designed to accept different tooling.   Thus, in a typical assembly operation, several assembly lines were needed to make different products, or the stations had to be designed to accept different tooling. However, since the pressing mechanisms had to be spaced apart at different distances, the tooling had to be designed with various offsets to<br><br>
account for the different sizes of components to accommodate the different train stack-up. In such offset tooling, one work station support would be used with replaceable tooling.  The replaceable tooling included a vertically-operating press equipment and a horizontally operating slide.  Depending on the pitch of the chain, the vertical press could operate in a plane offset from the vertical center plane of the work station support, resulting in unbalanced loads being placed on die work station support.  Another alternative was to provide for additional track to be incorporated between the stations, such as curved track, and to use the variable track length to allow for more efficient production.  Problems could arise in using boom of these solutions: using offset tooling creates off-center loading during pressing of the components and off-center loading can lead to wear and premature failure of the work station support; adding curved track not only adds to the expense of the operation, but also creates potential operating problems in feeding the parts through the curved track sections.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
One object of the present invention is to provide for efficient production of a variety of products on a single production line.  The present invention provides a solution to the problem of using an existing set of assembly stations for more than one size of component in an assembly operation.  The present invention addresses the need for variable spacing between assembly operations by providing movable work or assembly stations, so that the work stations can be positioned at optimal distances for the type of product being<br><br>
manufactured, for balanced loading at the work station, and for improved‚Äù efficiency in" changing over from the assembly of one product to the assembly of another.  The present invention provides a design for changing the spacing between stations on roller chain and roller link assembly machines to permit assembly of various size roller chains and components on the same machine.<br>
In one aspect, the present invention provides an assembly apparatus for assembling a product from work pieces.   The apparatus includes a main drive mechanism having a central longitudinal axis.  The main drive mechanism is rotatably about its central longitudinal axis. The apparatus also includes a first assembly station,  The first assembly station comprises a movable assembly mechanism to act on a work piece and a drive train between the moveable assembly mechanism and the main drive mechanism for moving the assembly mechanism in response to rotation of the main drive mechanism.  The drive train includes an assembly station drive shaft having a central longitudinal axis substantially perpendicular to the central longitudinal axis of the main drive mechanism and means for rotating the assembly station drive shaft with rotation of the main drive mechanism.  The apparatus also includes a second assembly station spaced from the first assembly station and comprising a movable assembly mechanism to act on a work piece received from the first assembly station and a drive train between the movable assembly mechanism and the main drive mechanism for driving the assembly mechanism in response to rotation of the main drive mechanism.

A drive linkage is between the second assembly station drive shaft and the ram to move the ram with rotation of the second assembly station drive shaft.  A drive linkage extends from the second assembly station drive shaft to move the locator member with rotation of the second assembly station drive shaft.  The first assembly station is movable with respect to the second assembly station to a plurality of positions at different distances from the second assembly station.  At a first position, the second assembly station workpiece support abuts the first assembly station workpiece support to provide a continuous support path for the workpiece between the first assembly station and the second assembly station.  At least one of the locator units is removable from the associated assembly station. The kit further includes an alternate locator unit interchangeable with the removable locator unit on the assembly station.  The alternate locator unit has a workpiece support sized and shaped to abut the adjacent locator unit workpiece support to provide a continuous support path for the workpiece between the two assembly stations when one of the assembly stations is at another position with a different distance between the assembly stations.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
As shown in the accompanying drawings, the present invention provides a product assembler apparatus 10, which may be part of a kit with interchangeable parts for use in making a variety of products.  The kit or assembler 10 may be used in a novel method as described below.<br>
The illustrated product assembler apparatus 10 is a press assembly system, and may be useful in the assembly of a roller chain product.  A roller chain assembler will have a<br><br>
plurality of assembly stations 12, 14, 16. shown in FIGS. 1-4, each assembly station having a single press system, with the individual stations arranged serially on a planar base 17 for assembling different parts of a particular chain product.  First, second and third assembly stations 12, 14, 16 are shown in FIGS. 1-4, but it should be understood that fewer or more stations could be provided, and the principles of the present invention may be applied to assemblers with fewer or more stations.<br>
A typical roller chain 18 that may be assembled with such equipment is shown in an exploded view in FIG. 6, and typically has a plurality of roller link plates 20 joined together by pin link plates 22.  Each roller link plate 20 has a pair of bushings 24 press fit into holes 25 in the roller link plate 20, and each pin link plate 22 has a pair of pins 26 press fit into holes 27 in the pin link plate 22. Each roller link plate 20 is pivotally connected to two adjoining pin link plates 22 with one pin 26 from each of the adjoining pin link plates 22 extending through one of the roller link plate bushings 24.  Rollers 28 are mounted for rotation on the bushings 24.  Such roller chain products 18 are useful in power transmission, and are usually load-bearing in operation.  A variety of sizes and shapes of roller chain are made and used, and me different chains may have linkplates 20 with different contours, and the chains may have different pitches, measured as the distance in inches between the centerlines of the adjacent joint members, such as the distance between me centerlines of adjacent pins 26.  As the pitch of the chain varies, the distances between the press mechanisms of adjacent assembly stations 12 in the assembler 10 will also vary.<br><br>
The assembler apparatus 10 could comprise a roller link assembler apparatus, with the first assembly station 12 comprising a bush link assembly station, for pressing the bushings 24 into the roller link plates 20, die second assembly station 14 comprising a roller assembly station for placing the rollers 28 on the bushings, and the third assembly station 16 comprising an upper linkplate assembly station for pressing the upper roller link plate 20 onto the bushings 24 to assemble a complete roller link.  The assembler 10 could also comprise a roller chain assembler apparatus, with the first station 12 comprising a pin link assembly station for pressing pins 26 into holes in a pin link plate 22, the second assembly station 14 comprising a roller link assembly station for placing a complete roller link on the adjacent pins 26 of adjacent pin link plates 22, and the third assembly station 16 could comprise a coverplate assembly station for pressing the covering pin linkplate 22 to complete the roller chain.<br>
The illustrated assembler apparatus 10 includes a main drive mechanism 40 having a central longitudinal axis 42-  The main drive mechanism 40 is rotatable about its central longitudinal axis 42, and is driven by a clutch 44 which is driven by a flywheel 46.  The flywheel-46 is rotated by a drive belt 48 connected to a gear 50 that is rotated by a motor 52. This means for rotating the main drive mechanism 40 is shown and described for purposes of illustration only; it should be understood that other devices and linkages may be used for rotation the main drive mechanism 40.<br>
Each assembly station 12, 14, 16 in the illustrated assembler 10 includes a movable assembly mechanism 54 to act on a workpiece and a drive train 56 between the moveable<br><br>
assembly mechanism and the main drive mechanism 40 for moving the assembly mechanism in response to rotation of the main drive mechanism 40.  In the illustrated embodiment, the first assembly station. 12 and third assembly station 16 are movable on the planar base 17 in a direction parallel to the main drive mechanism central longitudinal axis 42 between a plurality of positions.  In the illustrated embodiment, the position of the second assembly station 14 is fixed on the base.   Each position of the first assembly station 12 and diird assembly station 16 is at a different spacing from the second assembly station to vary the distances dl and 62 as shown in FIG. 4 between the assembly stations 12, 14, 16 without disconnecting the main drive mechanism 40.<br>
Each movable assembly 54 operates on one or more workpieces.  In the case of an assembler apparatus used to assemble roller chain or a roller link of the type shown in FIG. 6, the workpieces may comprise the roller link plates 20, the pin link plates 22, the bushings 24, the pins 26 or the rollers 28.  Other workpieces would be used for assemblers making<br>
other products.<br>
As shown in FIG. 5, each illustrated drive train 56 includes an assembly station drive shaft 58 having a central longitudinal axis 60 that is substantially perpendicular to the central longitudinal axis 42 of the main drive mechanism 40.  Each drive train 56 also includes means for rotating the assembly station drive shaft 58 with rotation of the main drive mechanism 40.  The means for rotating may comprise a gear box 62, or any conventional bevel gear apparatus.  A suitable right angle gear box for use with the present invention is available from the Boston Gear Division of Quincy, Massachusetts, of IMO Industries, Inc.<br><br>
of Lawrenceville, New Jersey, Model No. R1515, with an overhung load (no thrust) of 13QQ pounds and 1.5 inches from the end of the shaft, and a stock gear ratio of 1:1, 1.35:1 or 1.5:1.  It should be understood that this right angle gear box is identified for purposes of illustration only, and that other gear boxes and right angle drives may be used to rotate the assembly station drive shaft 58 with the rotation of the main drive mechanism 40.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, the first illustrated main drive mechanism 40 has a plurality of axial splines 64.  The first illustrated main drive mechanism 40 is a common drive shaft, and extends from the clutch 44 to an end past the third assembly station 16.  The axial splines 64 may extend the length of the common drive shaft or may be provided in the area of one or more of the assembly stations 12, 14, 16.  In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 2, the common drive shaft 40 extends through each gear box 62 and each gear box 62 is mounted on the splines 64 of the shaft 40 so that the rotating splines contact and turn the gears in the gear box.  Each gear box 62 is slidable on the splines in a direction parallel to the central longitudinal axis 42 of the common drive shaft 40 so that the positions of the first and third assembly stations 12, 16 can be changed: the gear box for the first and third assembly station can be slid on the main drive mechanism as the assembly stations move without disconnecting the gear boxes 62, without changing any of the gears for driving the assembly station drive shaft 58, and without moving the common drive shaft.  Thus, rotation of each assembly station drive shaft 58 is tied to rotation of the main drive mechanism 40, so that the timing of the operation of each assembly station 12, 14, 16 may be coordinated.  The splines 64 in the vicinity of each assembly station are long enough to allow for the gear box to be<br><br>
moved to the extreme positions.   It should be understood that one or all of the assembly stations could be made to be movable along the main drive mechanism.<br>
An alternative form of main drive mechanism 40 is shown in FIGS. 3 and 5.   As there shown, the main drive mechanism 40 may comprise a plurality of discrete splined shaft segments 41 received within mating sleeves 43. The interiors of the sleeves are splined so that the sleeves and splined shaft segments rotate as one.  The sleeves 43 are attached to drive the gears in the gear boxes 62, and to move the gear boxes with the movement of at least one adjacent sleeve.  The splined shaft segments 41 may slide into and out of the receiving sleeves 43, to allow the relative positions of the adjacent assembly stations to be changed without disconnecting the gear boxes 62.  The splined shaft segments 41 and sleeves 43 have a common central longitudinal axis 42 about which all rotate.  As used herein, the phrase "main drive mechanism" is intended to include both the common drive shaft illustrated in FIG. 2 and the combination of splined shaft segments 41 and sleeves 43 illustrated in FIGS. 3 and 5.  It should be understood that other structures may also be used for the main drive mechanism, such as a splined yoke, and are intended to be included within that phrase.   Moreover, it should be understood that structures other than splines may be used.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment, as shown in FIGS. 1-2, means for changing the spacing between the first and second 12, 14 and means for changing die spacing between second and third 14, 16 assembly stations are provided.  The illustrated means for changing the spacing comprise a first threaded member 66 and a second threaded member 68.  The first threaded<br><br>
member 66 extends between the first and second assembly stations 12, 14, from a connection to a vertical side frame member 69 of the stationary second assembly station 14, through two spaced vertical side frame 70 members to the exterior of the first assembly station 12.   The second threaded member 68 extends between the second and third assembly stations, from a connection to another vertical side frame member 71 of the second assembly station 14 tfirough two spaced vertical side frame members 72 to die exterior of the third assembly station 16.  Suitable fittings may be provided around the threaded members 66, 68 on the first and third assembly stations 12, 16 so that as the first threaded member 66 is turned, the first assembly station moves closer to or further from the second assembly station to change the spacing between the stations and so that as the second threaded member 68 is turned, the third assembly station moves closer to or further from the second assembly station 14 to change the spacing between the second and third assembly stations.  Each of the illustrated threaded members 66, 68 comprises a lead screw device, and commercially available lead screw devices may be used; for example, the types of lead screws typically used on lathes could be used.<br>
The lead screws 66, 68 in me illustrated embodiment are each operated by a separate motor 74, 76.   As shown schematically in FIG. 4, each motor 74, 76 can be connected to be controlled by a computer or other programmable control element 78 so that the optimum position for each assembly station for each product can be stored in the computer memory and translated into controlled rotation of each lead screw 66, 68 to easily and efficiently position the assembly stations 12, 16.  An example of such a computer element is SLC 500<br><br>
available from the Allen-Bradley Co., of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  Other systems for controlled linear movement of the assembly stations may be employed and are with the scope of the invention.   It should be understood that the lead screws could also be manually operated, and that in some embodiments it may be desirable to not use such lead screws.<br>
To facilitate controlled linear movement of the first and second assembly stations 12, 16 on the base 17, the illustrated assembler 10 includes a set of guide rails 80 that prevent twisting or vertical movement of the assembly stations 12, 16 on the base, as shown in FIGS. 1-4.  The guide rails 80 and movable assembly stations 12, 16 could have bearings at their interfaces to facilitate sliding movement of the assembly stations, and the movable assembly stations 12, 16 could have bearings or some other device for rolling movement along the surface of the base 17.  The illustrated guide rails 80 are illustrated as extending over the front of each assembly station to maintain co-linear paths of travel for the movable assembly stations 12, 16.   Other systems for controlled movement of the assembly stations 12, 16 can be used.  For example, long rods or beams could be used for the base and the assembly stations could be mounted on bearing blocks on the rods or beams for support and guided movement.   It should be understood that these systems are identified for purposes of illustration only, and other systems may be used.<br>
It may be desirable to employ stops in the base structure for positioning of the assembly stations on the base.  For such stops, it may be desirable to use complementary spring-biased shot pins 81 and holes or depressions associated with the base 17 or guide rails 80 and the movable assembly stations 12, 16, one of the complementary members being<br><br>
positioned on the base at each desired location for the assembly stations to endure proper positioning of the assembly stations.  Whether the holes are in the base or the assembly stations, and which element should carry the shot pins are a matter of design choice.   Other manual or automatic locking devices may be used to lock the assembly stations in each of their positions.  In the motorized embodiment, the positions of the movable assembly stations 12, 16 could also be locked through the control of the motor 74; in a computer controlled embodiment, the computer 78 may control the motor 74 to prevent relative movement of the assembly stations or to control a mechanical locking mechanism.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment, the movable assembly mechanism 54 of each assembly station 12, 14, 16 comprises a ram 82 movable through a pre-determined vertical path for applying a force to the workpiece.  Each illustrated assembly station 12, 14, 16 also includes a locator unit 84 for moving workpiece elements horizontally into the path  of the ram 82. The movable assembly mechanisms 54 and locator units 84 are shown schematically in FIGS. 3-4, and examples of suitable structures for rams 82 and locator units 84 are illustrated in FIGS. 2, 5 and 7-8.<br>
A typical assembly station is shown in FIG. 5, and it should be understood that the structures shown in FIG. 5 may be used in each assembly station 12, 14, 16.  Each illustrated assembly station 12, 14, 16 has a vertical frame member 86 perpendicular to the spaced side vertical frame members 69, 70, 71, 72.  Each of the spaced vertical side frame members 69, 70, 71, 72 is L-shaped, and each assembly station has a horizontal frame member 88 that extends over and between each of the spaced vertical members adjacent the<br><br>
vertical frame member 86.  As shown in FIG. 1, the illustrated vertical frame members 86 each carry a pair of spaced linear bearings 90 to guide the movement of the ram 82 in a vertical linear path.  The lower end of each ram 82 has a hammer 92 for contacting the workpieces.  As shown in FIGS. 1-4, each ram 82 has a path of movement that is substantially centered on the assembly station frame so that me load applied by the ram is centered on the frame.  In the present invention, since the entire movable assembly station 12, 16, including the frame, moves as a unit, the vertical path of travel of each ram 82 does not change with any change in position of the assembly station, and it is not necessary to employ an offset ram to adjust spacing.<br>
Each assembly station 12, 14, 16 has a similar drive train 56 extending between the ram 82 or movable assembly mechanism 54 and the drive shaft 58 for that assembly station. A typical drive train that may be used is illustrated in FIG. 5, and it should be understood that such a drive train may be used for all three assembly stations.  As shown in FIG. 5, the ram 82 is connected to a rod 98 through a pivotal connecting pin 100.  The opposite end of the rod 98 is connected to a clevis 102 that is connected through a clevis pin 104 to the front end 106 of a ram lever 108.  Pivoting is permitted between the clevis pin 104 and the ram lever 108, and one or more bearings may be used to facilitate pivoting.<br>
The illustrated ram levers 108 are pivotally mounted on the assembly station vertical side frame members 69, 70, 71, 72 at pivots 110.  The pivots 110 for the ram levers 108 may comprise pins and may have one or more bearings to permit free pivoting of the ram lever 108.  The pivots 110 are between me front ends 106 of the ram levers 108 and me<br><br>
back ends 112 of the ram levers.   The back ends 112 of the illustrated ram levers 108 are each pivotally connected to an air spring clevis 114 through an air spring clevis pin 116 so that the ram lever 108 can pivot with respect to the clevis 114.  Each air spring clevis 114 is connected to the top end of an air spring assembly 118 comprising an air spring rod 120 telescopically received in an air spring barrel 122.  The bottom end of the air spring barrel 122 is mounted through a pin 124 to a frame fixture 126; the bottom end of the air spring is free to pivot about the frame fixture but vertical movement is limited.<br>
In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 5, between the pivot 110 and the connection to the air spring clevis 114 at the back end 112 of the ram lever 108, the ram lever 108 is pivotally connected to a top end of a clevis 128 through a clevis pin 130.  The clevis 128 is connected through a rod to a cam follower assembly including a block 132 and a cam follower roller 134.<br>
Each assembly station drive train 56 also includes a rotatable cam 136.   Each cam follower roller 134 bears against the rotatable cam 136 for that station.  Each rotatable cam 136 is mounted on the drive shaft 58 for that assembly station.  The rotatable cam 136 is mounted to rotate with rotation of the drive shaft.  Suitable supports 138 and bearings 140 may be provided for the assembly station drive shaft 58 and rotatable cam 136.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 1-2 and 7-8, each illustrated locator unit 84 includes a work piece feed assembly 146, a locator member 148 for moving a workpiece element toward the path of the ram 82, and a workpiece support 150.  Each illustrated workpiece feed assembly 146 includes a bridge 152 spanning the horizontal path of the locator member 148 and a<br><br>
workpiece supply line 154 supported by the bridge 152.  The type of workpiece supply line 154 varies with the workpiece being supplied.  It may comprise a pair or rubes 156 as in the first assembly station 12 shown in FIG. 1 for delivering pins 26 or rollers 28 or bushings 24 to the locator member 154; it may comprise a stack of link plates 20, 22 to be supplied to the locator member, as shown in the second assembly station 14 of FIG. 1.  An additional supply line 155 may be provided to supply a base link plate to the first assembly station 12, as shown in FIG. 1.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 7-8, where the supply lines 154 arc removed for purposes of illustration, the bridges 152 have boles 157 generally corresponding in size and shape with the workpieces to be fed.  The bridges and supply lines may be made to be removable from the locator units.<br>
Each illustrated locator member 148 includes a workpiece pusher 158 between two locator arms 160.  Each pusher 158 and set of locator arms 160 are shaped to push the workpiece element received through the holes in the bridge toward the path of the ram 82, and the locator arms 160 are shaped to hold the elements in position as the hammer 92 is applied to the workpieces.<br>
Each illustrated locator unit 84 has a base 162 supported on the flat horizontal frame member 88 of each assembly station, and may be fixed to the frame member with any suitable clamp 164 or the like that allows the locator unit 84 to be easily removed when desired.  The base 162 may have a recess 165 to receive a part of the clamp 164 fixed to the<br><br>
frame member 88.  The base 162 may be shaped to define a path of travel for the pusher iss and locator arms 160, or may carry a linear bearing to guide these elements.<br>
Each assembly station has a drive linkage 166 extending from the drive shaft for that assembly station to move the locator member with rotation of the assembly station drive shaft.  A typical drive linkage that may be used is illustrated in FIG. 5 and includes a barrel cam 168 mounted for rotation on die assembly station drive shaft 58.  The barrel cam 168 has a cam surface that bears against a cam follower 170,  The cam follower 170 is mounted on a trolley 171 on the underside of the horizontal frame member 88, and is biased toward the ram 82 by an air spring or the like on the trolley 171.  The horizontal frame member 88 has a slot 172 extending through it, and a drive lug 174 is connected to the cam follower 170 through the slot. Thus, as the barrel cam 168 is rotated by the assembly station drive shaft 58, the cam follower 170 moves the drive lug 174 so that the locator member 148 may be moved toward or away from me ram 82 by me action of me spring, cam, cam follower and drive lug.  As shown in FIG. 5, forward of the barrel cam 168, the assembly station drive shaft 58 is supported by a support member 167 and bearing 169.<br>
At each assembly station, the supports 138, 167 and bearings 140, 169 are fixed to the vertical side frame members 69, 70, 71, 72 of each assembly station 12, 14, 16 so that each ram 82, drive shaft 58, right angle gear box 62 and both drive trains 94, 166 move wim the assembly station as a unit along the axis 42 of the main drive mechanism 40.<br>
To move the partial or complete assemblies from one assembly station to the next, two systems are used: first 12 to second 14 assembly station transfers being effected by a<br><br>
pushing apparatus of the type shown at 191 in FIGS. 1 and 2, acting in a direction substantially parallel with the workpiece suppon 150; second 14 to third 16 assembly station transfers being effected by a rotatable sprocket 180 on a horizontal support 182 beyond the third assembly station 16.  The sprocket 180 may be tied through a drive train to the main drive mechanism 40 or independently driven so that the sprocket 180 indexes to pull the chain or partial assemblies from the second assembly station 14 to the third assembly station 16, after the second assembly station movable assembly mechanism 54 has operated on the chain workpieces, and after the third assembly station movable assembly mechanism 54 has operated on the chain workpiece, from the third assembly station 16 to a storage area.<br>
Each locator unit 84 workpiece support 150 functions to provide a substantially continuous horizontal support for the workpieces between the ram 82 of each assembly station 12, 14, 16 and for the complete chain to the sprocket 180. As shown in FIGS. 7-9, in some assembly stations, the workpiece support 150 may also provide vertical supports or walls 181 to define an undercut channel 179 through which a bottom plate, such as a roller or pin link plate 20, 22 with upstanding pins 26 or bushings 24 maintained uprights by the vertical supports 181 assure proper positioning of partial or complete assembly of workpieces as it travels from one assembly station to the next.  A continuous horizontal suppon 183 may [ie beneath the vertical supports 181, as shown in FIGS. 7-9.<br>
It should be understood that the shape of the support 150 will depend on the use of he apparatus.  For example, it may be desirable to have such vertical supports 181 and indercuts along a substantial length of me apparatus, particularly if the apparatus is being<br><br>
used to assemble a roiler link component for later assembly into a completed chain.  For such an apparatus, the sprocket 180 would not be effective to pull the assemblies through from one station to the next, and the pushing apparatus 191 could be used to move the assembiies along the line.   For such an apparatus, it may be desirable to use supports 150 of the type shown in FIG. 2 that define the path for the workpiece elements.  Although the sprocket 180 is shown in that embodiment, it would not necessarily be used.  For an apparatus being used to assemble a complete chain, it may be desirable to use locator units 84 having supports 150, with a substantial area between the second and third assembly stations 14, 16 being free from vertical supports 181, having only a horizontal support 183.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 7-8, the workpiece supports 150 for adjacent assembly stations each have breaks 184 of complementary shapes to provide a continuous support for die assembly as it travels between the assembly stations.  Other complementary shaped may be used, such as shown in FIG. 2.  Each of the locator units 84 is removable by loosening the clamp 164 and lifting the locator unit 84 from me frame member 88 and drive lug 174,<br>
As shown in FIG. 7, the locator unit 84 elements may be connected together or located by any suitable mechanical means, such as hex-socket head cap screws 185, or nuts and bolts 187.  Location sensors 189 may also be carried on the locator units 84, wim output fed to a programmable controller or computer 78.<br>
The present invention also provides at least one removable alternate locator unit 190, as shown in FIG. 8, of substantially the same design as the top locator unit illustrated in FIG. 7, but with a workpiece support 150 of a different length.  Thus, to make a different<br><br>
type of chain, one would remove at least one of the locator units from at least one of the assembly stations, move the assembly stations to the desired spacing, and replace the removed locator unit 84 with an alternate locator unit 190 having a workpiece support 150 of a different length, a length that will assure that a continuous support is provided between the assembly stations at the new spacing.  The shape of the break 184 in the alternate locator unit support 150 should be similar to that of the removable locator unit, as seen from comparing FIGS. 7 and 8, to complement the shape of the break in die adjacent locator unit.<br>
The assembler of the present invention may comprise a kit, with one or more removable and interchangeable alternate locator units 84, 190 provided, each having workpiece support lengths 150 and breaks 184 sized and shaped to mate with or abut the workpiece support of an adjacent locator unit at the various spacings.  Thus, with one of the interchangeable alternate locator 84, 190 units in place, a continuous support path is provided for the workpieces between the three assembly stations when one of the assembly stations is at different positions with different distances between two of the assembly stations.<br>
It should be understood that an alternate locator unit 190 may be provided for any one or all of the locator units 84 of FIG. 2 or FIG. 7.  More than one set of alternate locator units may also be provided, depending on the variety of products to be made with the assembler.  Each of the bridges 152 and workpiece supply lines 154 may also be removable and interchangeable with alternate structures that may be provided with a kit.<br>
In the method of the present invention, roller chain products of different pitch may be made on a common assembly system apparatus 10. The method comprises the steps of<br><br>
providing First, second and third assembly stations 12, 14, 16.   Each assembly station includes an assembly mechanism 54 and a drive train 56 for driving the assembly mechanism.  A main drive mechanism 40 is provided for all three assembly stations 12, 14, 16.  Each assembly station drive train 56 is connected to be driven by the main drive mechanism 40.  The first, second and third assembly stations 12, 14, 16 are then positioned at a pre-determined spacing from each other and with the main drive mechanism 40 running along all three assembly stations by sliding a part of me drive train along me main drive mechanism 40 in a direction parallel to the central longitudinal axis 42 of the main drive mechanism 40.<br>
In operation, appropriate supplies or workpieces are loaded into each of the supply lines 154 and the motor 52 is started.  For a roller link assembly apparatus, the supply line 155 may be filled with  stacked roller link plates 20, and the supply lines 154 to the first assembly station 12 filled with bushings 24.  The supply line 154 at the second assembly station 14 may be filled with rollers 28, and the supply line 154 at the third assembly station 16 may be filled with a stack of roller link plates 20. The lateral feed mechanism 191 pushes the roller link plates 20 from the supply line 155 into the path of the ram, below the ram 82, and two bushings 24 are gravity fed into the path of the locator member 148.  The motor 52, gear 50 and drive belt 48 cause me flywheel 46 to rotate, which causes one side of the clutch 44 to rotate, which in rum rotates the other side of the clutch 44 dirough friction or me like.  Rotation of the clutch 44 causes the main drive mechanism 40 to rotate.  As me main drive mechanism 40 rotates, the right angle gear boxes 62 cause each assembly station<br><br>
drive shaft 58 to rotate.   As each assembly station drive shaft 58 rotates the rotatable cam 136 and barrel cam 168 of each assembly station rotates, moving each cam follower 134, 170, setting the remainders of die drive linkages in motion to move or allow die locator members 148 to move horizontally toward the ram 82, pushing the workpiece, such as me bushings 24, into the path of the ram hammer 92.  Then, the drive linkages move me ram 82 vertically downward toward the locator members.  Force is applied by me ram hammer 92 to two or more of the workpieces to force them together, such as pressing the bushings into the holes in the roller link plates.  As me main drive mechanism 40 continues to rotate, me cams 136, 168 and cam followers 134, 170 move the ram 82 and locator members 148 away from each other and the pushing apparatus 191 pushes another plate 20 into position, which pushes the assembly toward the next assembly station.  As me assembly moves, it is supported by the workpiece support 150: from me first to the second assembly station 12, 14, me upright bushings 24 are between the vertical supports 181 and the roller link plate 20 is in the undercut, supported by the continuous horizontal support 183.   The workpiece comprising the roller link plate 20 and the upright bushings 24 is pushed toward the second assembly station 14 as the lateral feed mechanism 191 feeds another roller link plate 20 to the first assembly station.  When me workpiece reaches die second assembly station, rollers 28 are graviry fed into me path of me second station locator member 148, which pushes the rollers into me path of the ram 82 through operation of the barrel cam 168, follower 170 and drive lug 174.  The drive linkage for me ram forces me second assembly station ram down to push the rollers down into position on the bushings.  Workpieces from me first assembly station<br><br>
push the work pieces from the second assembly station further down the line toward the third assembly station 16.  At the third assembly station 16, another roller link plate 20 is gravity fed into the path of the locator member 148.  As the main drive mechanism 40 rotates, turning the third assembly station drive shaft 58 and thereby rotating the barrel cam 168, the cam follower 170 moves toward the ram, moving the drive lug 174 and locator member 148 toward die ram, pushing the roller link plate onto the awaiting bushings 24 of the workpiece. The rotating third assembly station drive shaft 58 rotates the cam 136, and through the drive linkage, die third assembly station ram 82 pushes the roller link plate onto the bushings and press fits them together.  The completed roller link is dien pushed further down the line for storage.<br>
For assembly of a complete chain, the locator units 84 shown in FIG. 2 could be removed and replaced with locator units of the type shown in FIG. 7.  Each locator unit would be placed so that drive lug 174 is received to enable it to drive the locator member toward and away from the ram.  The spacing of the assembly stations could be adjusted if needed, either manually or through computer control by the programmable computer 78. The supply lines 154, 155 could be changed to supply pin link plates 22 and pins 26 at the first station 12, roller link assemblies at the second station 14, and a top pin link plate 22 at the third station 16.  Operation of each station would be similar to that described above, with the locator members 148 pushing pins at the first station, roller link assemblies at me second station 14, and top pin link plates at the third station.  In this set up, the sprocket 180 would<br><br>
operate to pull the partially completed chain from the second assembly station 14 and the completed chain from the third assembly station 16.<br>
It may be desirable to combine the present invention with that disclosed in the patent application filed concurrently herewith by David C. Armenoff and David J. Frey, and assigned to Amsted Industries, Inc. and entided "Apparatus and Method for Control of Roller Chain Assembly", the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.<br>
