				<td>The invention relates to an apparatus for use in spinning preparation for<br>
detecting foreign objects of plastics material, such as polypropylene bands, fabric<br>
and films and the like, in or among fibre material, especially fibre flocks, for<br>
example, of cotton. The fibre material may in particular, but not exclusively, be<br>
fibre flocks being removed (opened) from bales of textile fibre, during which<br>
process a foreign object detector and the fibre flocks are movable relative to one<br>
another, the foreign object detector comprising a transmitter and a receiver for<br>
electromagnetic waves or rays and an evaluating device for distinguishing the<br>
foreign objects from the fibre flocks.<br>
In a known apparatus (DE 36 44 535 Al), the fibre flocks are arranged in a loose<br>
pile on a moving conveyor belt. A transmitter for the electromagnetic waves or<br>
rays is arranged above the conveyor belt with the pile of fibre flocks. A receiver<br>
is located between the upper and lower belt regions. The material of the<br>
conveyor belt is a material that is permeable to electromagnetic waves or rays.<br>
The loose pile of flocks is then irradiated. The foreign objects are often<br>
polypropylene bands. The apparatus enables the form (shape) colour, size or<br>
brightness of foreign objects to be determined. The recognised outwardly<br>
differing features of the foreign objects are used to differentiate them, by a<br>
comparison process, from the good fibres of the fibre flocks.<br>
It is an aim of the invention further to improve the apparatus for detecting<br>
foreign objects of plastics materials, such as polypropylene bands, fabric and<br>
films, and the like.<br><br>
The invention provides a detection apparatus for detecting foreign objects of<br>
plastics material in or amongst fibre material, comprising<br>
a source of polarised light;<br>
a transport arrangement for so transporting the fibre material that it is<br>
irradiated by the source; and<br>
a detector device being arranged to receive the light from the fibre<br>
material.<br>
The measures according to the invention enable a reliable detection of light-<br>
coloured or transparent plastics foreign objects that are responsive to polarised<br>
light to be achieved. It is advantageous therein that in particular those foreign<br>
objects having only a slight optical contrast with the good fibres (textile fibres)<br>
can be detected. The plastics materials occur in many cases in the form of<br>
packaging films or packaging fabrics. According to the invention, not only<br>
relatively large parts but also foreign fibres are recognized and detected.<br>
The foreign objects of plastics material may be able to rotate the polarisation<br>
vector of the polarised light. The light may be linearly polarised, circularly<br>
polarised, or elliptically polarised. The light source and the detector device may<br>
be arranged on different sides of the fibre flocks (transmitted light arrangement).<br>
The light source and the detector device may be arranged on the same side of<br>
the fibre flocks (incident light arrangement). Depolarisation may be effected for<br>
detection. Reflection-suppression may be effected for detection. Foreign objects<br>
of plastics material may change the polarised light by anisotropics (such as<br><br>
double refraction) such that the light is rendered visible by the analyser of the<br>
detector device. The fibre material may be arranged in a channel of glass or the<br>
like. The fibre material may be conveyed through a channel pneumatically. The<br>
fibre material may be arranged on a conveyor belt. The fibre material may be<br>
arranged with a roller, e.g. detaching roller.<br>
The roller may rotate rapidly. There may be provided a background that is<br>
diffuse; reflecting, for example, mirror-like; or luminous. The detector device<br>
may be a line-scan camera. The detector device may be a matrix camera. The<br>
detector device may comprise light sensors. Detection may take place in colour.<br>
Detection may take place in black and white. A polariser may be arranged<br>
between light source and fibre material. A light source that emits polarised light<br>
may be present. A polariser may be integrated on or within the light source. An<br>
analyser may be arranged between the fibre material and the detector device. A<br>
detector that also acts as analyser may be present. The analyser may be<br>
integrated on or within the detector. Light-refracting elements, for example<br>
prisms, may be arranged in the ray path. In addition or instead, lenses may be<br>
arranged in the ray path.<br>
A device for removing foreign objects may be arranged downstream of the<br>
evaluating device. The evaluating device and the removal device may be<br>
electrically connected with one another by a control or switching device. The<br>
device may be arranged downstream of a bale opener. The device may be<br>
arranged in or downstream of a cleaning device. The device may be arranged in<br><br>
or downstream of a carding machine. The device may be arranged in or<br>
downstream of a foreign fibre separator. The device may be arranged in or<br>
downstream of a foreign object separator.<br>
Anisotropics such as the double refractive effect of the foreign objects may be<br>
used for detection. Selectively absorbing behaviour (dichroism) of the foreign<br>
objects may be used for detection. Optically active behaviour (rotary dispersion)<br>
of the foreign objects may be used for detection. The detector device is<br>
advantageously able to distinguish sheet-form from fibre-form foreign objects on<br>
the basis of its resolution.<br>
The invention also provides an apparatus in spinning preparation for detecting<br>
foreign objects of plastics material, such as polypropylene bands, fabric and films<br>
and the like, in or among fibre flocks, for example, of cotton, that are being<br>
removed (opened) from bales of textile fibre, during which process a foreign<br>
object detector and the fibre flocks are movable relative to one another, the<br>
foreign object detector comprising a transmitter and a receiver for<br>
electromagnetic waves or rays and an evaluating device for distinguishing the<br>
foreign objects from the fibre flocks, characterised in that a source of polarised<br>
light that cooperates with at least one detector device (camera) acts on the fibre<br>
material (fibre flocks, fibre flock web), the fibre material being irradiated, with<br>
light passing through light-coloured and/or transparent sheet-form foreign<br>
objects of plastics material, and the detector device being capable of<br>
distinguishing sheet-form foreign objects from fibrous plastics items (synthetic<br>
fibres).<br><br>
The invention also provides a method for detecting foreign objects of plastics<br>
material in or amongst fibre material, comprising effecting relative movement of<br>
the fibre material and a source of polarised light, irradiating a portion of the fibre<br>
material with polarised light, detecting light from the fibre material, and<br>
evaluating the detected light to distinguish foreign objects of plastics material.<br>

Figure 1 shows a carding machine, with feed roller 1, feed table 2, licker-ins 3a,<br>
3b, 3c, cylinder 4, doffer 5, stripping roller 6, squeezing rollers 7, 8 web-guide<br>
element 9, web funnel 10, take-off rollers 11, 12, revolving card top 13 with<br>
guide rollers 13a, 13b and card flat bars 14, can 15 and can coiler 16. The<br>
directions of rotation of the rollers are shown by curved arrows. The letter M<br>
denotes the midpoint (axis) of the cylinder 4. 4a denotes the clothing and 4b the<br>
direction of rotation of the cylinder 4. The letter C denotes the direction of<br>
rotation of the revolving card top 13 in the carding position and the letter D<br>
denotes the return transport direction of the card flat bars 14. Beneath the<br>
stripping roller 6 there is arranged a stationary supporting and guiding member<br>
17; the upper squeezing roller is arranged in close proximity to the stripping<br><br>
roller 6. The directions of rotation of the cylinder 4 and the rollers are<br>
represented by respective curved arrows. The supporting and guiding member<br>
serves to receive the apparatus 18 according to the invention. The letter A<br>
denotes the working direction.<br>
In Figure 2, the reference number 21 denotes the region in which the removed<br>
fibre web 19 passes from the stripping roller 6 to the squeezing rollers 7, 8. The<br>
supporting and guiding member 17 has essentially a four-cornered cross-section.<br>
The upper surface is slightly concavely curved. The radius of curvature of the<br>
curve of the upper surface is greater than the radius of curvature of the stripping<br>
roller 6. The arrow A indicates the running direction of the fibre we 19. The<br>
element 17 is in the form of a housing, a transparent window 20 being provided<br>
in the sliding contact region. The fibre web 19 is located initially on the clothing<br>
of the doffer 5, is guided in the roller nip between doffer 5 and stripping roller 5<br>
around and over the clothing 6a of the stripping roller 6, is detached from the<br>
stripping roller 6 a little way after the region of the perpendicular diameter, is<br>
guided in the region of the window 20 in direction A, following the end region<br>
runs completely freely and finally enters the roller nip between the squeezing<br>
rollers 7, 8 and passes between these. The upper surface of the element 17<br>
faces towards the clothing 6a of the stripping roller 6. With its one end region,<br>
the element 17 is associated with the roller nip between doffer 5 and stripping<br>
roller 6. The other end region is arranged in the region between stripping roller 6<br>
and squeezing rollers 7, 8, the edge thereof being aligned in the direction<br>
towards the roller nip between the squeezing rollers 7, 8. The element 17 is an<br>
extruded profile, for example, of aluminium, with an inner cavity 17a. Fixed<br><br>
cameras 21a to 21i, for example, diode matrix cameras, an illuminating device<br>
22 arranged to generate polarised light, (for example, comprising several light-<br>
emitting diodes), and a reflecting mirror 23 are arranged in the inner cavity 17a<br>
of the housing 17. The reflecting mirror 23 is arranged at an angle between the<br>
objective of the cameras 21a to 21i and the illuminating device 22 on the one<br>
hand and the inside of the window 20 on the other hand. The fibre web 19 runs<br>
over the outside of the window 20 in direction A. The window 20, for example of<br>
glass, is kept clean by contact with the moving fibre material. The cameras 21a<br>
to 21i (only camera 21a is shown in Figure 2) are arranged on a common<br>
support 24, which is secured to the element 17. The reference numeral 25<br>
denotes an electrical lead. The reference numeral 26 denotes an electronic<br>
evaluating unit to which the display device 27 and/or a separating device 28 (see<br>
Figures 4 and 5) are connected. The reference numeral 52 denotes the machine<br>
control for the card (see Figure 1).<br>
In the arrangement of Figure 3, an apparatus 18 according to the invention is<br>
mounted on a cleaning machine 30, the apparatus 18 is associated with the fibre<br>
tuft material 33, e.g. cotton, removed by the last roller 31c - viewed in the<br>
working direction B - of the multiple roller cleaner 30 and discharged through a<br>
pipeline 32. The apparatus 18 is connected to the machine control system and<br>
allows unwanted polypropylene foreign objects in the cotton fibre material to be<br>
detected.<br>
Referring to Figure 4, an apparatus 18 according to the invention and a<br>
pneumatic foreign object separates device 34 are associated with the middle<br><br>
roller 31b of the cleaner 30, viewed in the direction of rotation 31' of the roller<br>
31b.<br>
In the arrangement of Figure 5, the apparatus 18 according to the invention is<br>
associated with the high-speed roller 36 of a foreign object recognition and<br>
separation device 37, viewed in the direction of rotation of the roller 30,<br>
downstream of the device 37 there is arranged a pneumatic foreign object<br>
separating device 34, which comprises a plurality of blast nozzles 38 across the<br>
width of the machine 37. The machine control system (52, see Figure 2.) to<br>
which the apparatus 18 according to the invention and the device 34 are<br>
connected, always functions in response only to one nozzle 38a to 38n or to two<br>
adjacent nozzles 38a to 38n, in the operative region of which the foreign object<br>
has been detected. As a consequence, only a few fibre tufts (only 1-2 g) of<br>
cotton per separation process are removed. This permits a selective, sensitive<br>
adjustment of the system to enable even small portions to be separated out<br>
without allowing an unduly high loss of fibre material. The foreign objects 30 and<br>
the fibre material are located on the roller 36, which has a saw-tooth or needle<br>
clothing.<br>
Figure 6 shows an arrangement in which an apparatus of the invention is<br>
associated with a glass channel 40, the apparatus being operable as a<br>
transmitted light arrangement: the light radiating from a light source 4 is<br>
converted by means of a polariser 42 into linearly, circularly or even elliptically<br>
polarised light. Thus shines through the material to be inspected that is being<br><br>
transported through the transparent channel 40 through the optical<br>
arrangement. Whereas with cotton 43 and other natural constituents of the<br>
cotton 43 there is no change in the light, the plastics foreign object 44 produces<br>
a change in the plane of polarisation of the light. This change can be rendered<br>
visible by means of the analyser 45. Contrast differences and colour shifts occur<br>
relative to the other good material. These are picked up one or more detectors<br>
46 (a camera in Figure 6) and processed by an associated evaluating unit 47, so<br>
that an automatic separation (not shown) of the detected plastics items 44 can<br>
be carried out.<br>
Figure 7 shows an arrangement which is the same, in principle, as Figure 6,<br>
except that an incident light arrangement is used. The essential difference is that<br>
both illuminating means 41 and detector 46 (a camera in Figure 7) are situated<br>
on the same side of the material. The material is also separated here from the<br>
measuring arrangement by a window. The background 48 can be provided both<br>
by conveyor belts or rollers, which simultaneously serve to transport the<br>
material, and by fixed surfaces with lamps or surfaces with diffuse and shiny to<br>
mirror-like reflecting properties. Depending on the background used, the<br>
evaluating has to be effected differently, the important factor being that there is<br>
always an assessable change in light intensity or colour between cotton material<br>
43 and the plastics items 44. Depending on the evaluating method used, a<br>
contrast between background 48 and the material can be present/desirable cr<br>
not.<br><br>
A further modification of the arrangement of Figure 7 is illustrated in Figure 8.<br>
Here, the element polariser 42 and analyser 45 are combined in one componert<br>
51. Here too, surfaces of diffuse or shiny to reflective construction come into<br>
consideration as the background.<br>
Yet other embodiments comprise working with one or more pairs of<br>
cameras/detectors, the cameras of the or each pair being directed directly onto<br>
the same spot in the flow of material, as illustrated in Figure 9. One camera 46 is<br>
equipped with an analyser 45, which is arranged so that the analyser 45<br>
suppresses reflection. The other camera 49 of the pair does not need this<br>
analyser 45 and is spatially arranged so that a maximum light reflection occurs<br>
with plastics films. Both cameras 46 and 49 are aligned with respect to one<br>
another so that they both take exactly the same image section. Even if the<br>
cameras are not aligned, however, this can be created by a calibration in the<br>
evaluating unit. In the evaluation, both images of the spatially identical scene<br>
(one with and one without light reflection) are now assessed by comparison after<br>
a previously possible signal conditioning. One option for this would be, for<br>
example, to compute the two image signals to a third image, for example, by<br>
means of a difference or quotient process.<br>
The advantage of using two cameras is that the slight differences between image<br>
with light reflection and image without light reflection can easily be brought out,<br>
so that reliable detection is possible.<br><br>
In order to simplify the mechanical construction, it is also possible to house both<br>
cameras/detectors in a common housing 50, optionally with a common objective,<br>
the interior construction of which is designed in such a way, for example, by<br>
using beam splitters, prisms etc. or by the exact alignment of the two sensors<br>
relative to one another, that both image signals are received exactly from the<br>
same point or a spatial calculation or calibration in the evaluating unit 47 is easily<br>
possible.<br>
If the material is being conveyed by a conveyor belt or a needle roller, in which<br>
case the spatial arrangement of the individual fibres or fibre bundles relative to<br>
one another does not change, that is, the transport is merely linear, then both<br>
cameras 46 and 49, as shown in Figure 10, can scan the surface also at different<br>
points. The evaluation is then effected in the manner described for Figure 9.<br>
The described arrangement shown in Figure 6 to 10 can basically be used with<br>
linearly or circularly polarised light. In instances of the arrangements shown in<br>
Figures 6 to 8 it is advantageous, however, to use circularly polarised light,<br>
because this enables independence from the effect of the rotated position of the<br>
plastic items 44 to be achieved.<br><br>
