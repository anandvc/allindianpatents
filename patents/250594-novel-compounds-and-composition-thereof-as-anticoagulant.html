				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Background of Invention<br>
Warfarin (coumarin) is an anticoagulant that acts by inhibiting vitamin K-<br>
dependent coagulation factors. Warfarin based compounds are, typically, derivatives<br>
of 4-hydroxycoumarin, such as 3-{a-acetohylbenzyl)-4-hydroxycouniarin<br>
(COUMADIN). COUMADIN and other coumarin anticoagulants inhibit the<br>
synthesis of vitamin K dependent clotting factors, which include Factors II, YEL, DC<br>
and X. Anticoagulant proteins C and S are also inhibited by warfarin anticoagulants.<br>
Warfarin is believed to interfere with clotting factor synthesis by inhibiting vitamin K<br>
epoxide reductase, thereby inhibiting vitamin K regeneration.<br>
An anticoagulation effect is generally seen about 24 hours after administration<br>
of a single dose of warfarin and is effective for 2 to 5 days. While anticoagulants<br>
have no direct effect on an established thrombus and do not reverse ischemic tissue<br>
damage, anticoagulant treatment is intended to prevent the extension of formed clots<br>
and/or to prevent secondary thromboembolic complications. These complications<br>
may result in serious and possibly fatal sequelae.<br>
The FDA has approved warfarin for the following indications: 1) the treatment<br>
or prophylaxis of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, 2) thromboembolic<br>
complications associated with atrial fibrillation and /or cardiac valve replacement, and<br>
3) reducing the risk of death, recurring myocardial infarction, and stroke or systemic<br>
embolism after myocardial infarction.<br>
A number of adverse effects are associated with the administration of<br>
warfarin. These include fatal or nonfatal hemorrhage from any tissue or organ and<br>
hemorrhagic complications such as paralysis. Other adverse effects include<br>
paresthesia including feeling cold and chills; headache; chest, abdomen, joint, muscle<br>
or other pain; dizziness; shortness of breath; difficult breathing or swallowing;<br>
unexplained swelling, weakness, hypotension, or unexplained shock. Other adverse<br>
reactions reported include hypersensitivity/allergic reactions, systemic cholesterol<br>
microembolization, purple toes syndrome, hepatitis, cholestatic hepatic injury,<br>
jaundice, elevated liver enzymes, vasculitis, edema, fever, rash, dermatitis, including<br>
bullous eruptions, urticaria, abdominal pain including cramping, flatulence/bloating,<br>
fatigue, lethargy, malaise, asthenia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, pain, headache,<br>
dizziness, taste perversion, pruritus, alopecia and cold intolerance.<br>
Drug toxicity is an important consideration in the treatment of humans and<br>
animals. Toxic side effects resulting from the administration of drugs include a<br>
variety of conditions that range from low grade fever to death. Drug therapy is<br>
justified only when the benefits of the treatment protocol outweigh the potential risks<br>
associated with the treatment. The factors balanced by the practitioner include the<br>
qualitative and quantitative impact of the drug to be used as well as the resulting<br>
outcome if the drug is not provided to the individual. Other factors considered<br>
include the physical condition of the patient, the disease stage and its history of<br>
progression, and any known adverse effects associated with a drug.<br>
Drug elimination is the result of metabolic activity upon the drug and the<br>
subsequent excretion of the drug from the body. Metabolic activity can take place<br>
within the vascular supply and/or within cellular compartments or organs. The liver is<br>
a principal site of drug metabolism. The metabolic process can be broken down into<br>
primary and secondary metabolism, also called phase-1 and phase-2 metabolism. In<br>
phase-1 metabolism, the drug is chemically altered by oxidation, reduction,<br>
hydrolysis, or any combination, of the aforementioned processes and usually yields a<br>
more polar product than the parent drug. In Phase-2 metabolism the products of the<br>
phase-1 reaction are combined with endogenous substrates, e.g., glucuronic acid, to<br>
yield an addition or conjugation product that is even more hydrophilic than the<br>
product of phase-1 and which is readily eliminated in the bile or in the urine. In some<br>
cases, a drug can undergo only phase-2 (conjugation) metabolism, in other cases a<br>
drug can be eliminated unchanged. The first step in such synthetic reactions is often<br>
an oxidative conjugation performed by the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) system.<br>
Metabolites formed in phase-2 reactions are typically the product of a conjugation<br>
reaction performed by a transferase enzyme. These reactions include glucuronidation,<br>
amino acid conjugation, acetylation, sulfoconjugation, and methylation.<br>
Mammalian cytochrome) P450 enzymes (CYP450), including human CYP450,<br>
are membrane-bound heme-containing proteins that were originally discovered in rat<br>
liver microsomes. In order to function, CYP450 enzymes need a source of electrons.<br>
There are two different kinds of electron transfer chains for CYP450s. These depend<br>
on the location of the enzyme in the cell. Some P450s are found in the mitochondrial<br>
inner membrane and some are found in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The protein<br>
that donates electrons to CYP450s in the ER is called NADPH cytochrome P450<br>
reductase. Ferredoxin is the immediate donor of electrons to the CYP450s in<br>
mitochondria (CYP11A1, CYP11B1, CYP11B2, CYP24, CYP27A1, CYP27B1,<br>
CYP27C1). NADPH is the source of electrons that flow from ferredoxin reductase to<br>
ferredoxin and then to CYP450.' A few P450s also can accept electrons from<br>
cytochrome b5.<br>
Polymorphisms (differences in DNA sequence found at 1% or higher in a<br>
population) can lead to differences in drug metabolism, so they are important features<br>
of CYP450 genes in humans. CYP2C19 has a polymorphism that changes the<br>
enzyme's ability to metabolize mephenytoin (a marker drug). In Caucasians, the<br>
polymorphism for the poor metabolizer phenotype is only seen in 3% of the<br>
population. However, it is seen in 20% of the Asian population. Because of this<br>
difference, it is important to be aware of a person's race when drugs are given that are<br>
metabolized differently by different populations. Some drugs that have a narrow<br>
range of effective dose before they become toxic might be overdosed in a poor<br>
metabolizer.<br>
CYP2D6 is perhaps the best studied P450 with a drug metabolism<br>
polymorphism. This enzyme is responsible for more than 70 different drug<br>
oxidations. Since there may be no other way to clear these drugs from the system,<br>
poor metabolizers may be at severe risk for adverse drug reactions. CYP2D6<br>
Substrates include antiarrhythmics . (Flecainide, Mexiletine, Propafenone),<br>
antidepressants (Amitriptyline, Paroxetine, Venlafaxine, Fluoxetine, Trazadone),<br>
antipsychotics (Clorpromazine, Haloperidol, Thioridazine), beta-blockers (Labetalol,<br>
Timolol, Propanolol, Pindolol, Metoprolol), analgesics (Codeine, Fentanyl,<br>
Meperidine, Oxycodone, Propoxyphene), and many other drugs. CYP2E1 is induced<br>
in alcoholics. There is a polymorphism associated with this gene that is more<br>
common in Chinese people.<br>
The CYP3A subfamily is one of the most important drug metabolizing<br>
families in humans. CYP3A4 is "the most abundantly expressed CYP450 in human<br>
liver". (Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 369, 11-23 1999) CYP3A4 is known to metabolize<br>
more than 120 different drugs, e.g., acetaminophen, codeine, cyclosporin A,<br>
diazepam, erythromycin, lidocaine, lovastatin, taxoL cisapride, terfenadine, and<br>
warfarin, to name a few.<br>
The number of adverse drag reactions (ADRs) in the United States has risen<br>
dramatically in recent years and now represents a critical national health problem.<br>
The World Health Organization (WHO) defines an ADR as "a response to a drug that<br>
is noxious and unintended and occurs at doses normally used in man for the<br>
prophylaxis, diagnosis or therapy of disease, or for modification of physiological<br>
function". To highlight the importance of error in the genesis of ADRs and the fact<br>
that most (30-80%) ADRs are preventable, a more recent definition of an ADR is "an<br>
appreciably harmful or unpleasant reaction, resulting from an intervention related to<br>
the use of a medicinal product, which predicts hazard from future administration and<br>
warrants prevention or specific treatment, or alteration of the dosage regimen, or<br>
withdrawal of the product"<br>
Because ADRs are a major source of morbidity and mortality in our health<br>
care system, reducing the incidence of ADRs has become a national priority (FDA,<br>
Center for Drag Evaluation and Research). According to formal estimates, greater<br>
than 2.5 million ADRs occur each year in hospitals, ambulatory settings and nursing<br>
homes, resulting in over 106,000 deaths, and costing the US economy $136B annually<br>
in drug-related morbidity and mortality. This expense is greater than the annual cost<br>
of cardiovascular disease and diabetes in the United States. In addition, the estimated<br>
mortality rate associated with ADRs make them the fourth leading cause of death in<br>
this country.<br>
Many ADRs arise from the fact that most drags developed by the<br>
pharmaceutical industry significantly interact with components of the CYP system,<br>
either by relying on them for their metabolism and/or by inhibiting or inducing<br>
various CYP fractions. In other words, because so many important drug classes (e.g.,<br>
antihypertensives, antihistamines, antidepressants, immunosuppressants, statins)<br>
interact with the CYP system, it can act as a "bottleneck" for the safe metabolism and<br>
elimination of these agents and lead to toxic effects. With regard to drug metabolism,<br>
two fractions of the CYP system merit special mention: CYP3A4 and CYP2D6.<br>
Approximately one half of all known drugs interact with CYP3A4. Likewise,<br>
CYP2D6, an enzyme fraction whose activity is highly dependent on genetics (genetic<br>
polymorphisms), metabolizes one third of drugs in clinical use. Both of these<br>
enzymes are involved in the metabolism of warfarin-like compounds.<br>
The vast majority (70-90%) of ADRs occur as extensions of their expected<br>
pharmacological effects (exaggerated pharmacology). This is particularly relevant to<br>
the use of warfarin since the extension of the warfarin pharmacological effect is<br>
bleeding. Although many different factors can contribute to the development of<br>
ADRs, altered drug metabolism leading to elevated drug levels, either due to drag<br>
interactions at the enzymatic level, genetic alterations in enzyme activity, and/or<br>
organ dysfunction (liver, kidney), play a particularly important role in the genesis of<br>
ADRs.<br>
Drug therapy using warfarin is particularly difficult because the metabolism of<br>
warfarin is complex and subject to interactions with a host of other drugs, including<br>
drugs that are commonly prescribed in patients suffering from atrial fibrillation, such<br>
as amiodarone for example. Warfarin is a mixture of enantiomers having different<br>
intrinsic activities at the vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKER) enzyme. These<br>
enantiomers have different metabolic pathways using different CYP450 isozymes.<br>
The CYP450 metabolic system is highly inducible or repressible by a host of external<br>
factors such as diet and other medications. Also, the CYP450 system is subject to<br>
many genetic variations and has a low capacity and is easily saturable. For these<br>
reasons the metabolism of warfarin is subject to unpredictable variations and each<br>
enantiomer has a different metabolic fate and different potencies at the VKER<br>
enzyme.<br>
In addition, warfarin activity at the VKER enzyme results in inhibition of<br>
coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X, which have different half-lives of their own,<br>
ranging from hours (factor VIII) to days (factor X). Because of this complex situation,<br>
the pharmacological effect (increased coagulation time) of warfarin becomes apparent<br>
only 5 to 10 days after a dose. It is therefore easy to understand why warfarin therapy<br>
is extremely difficult to predict and why patients are at high risk of bleeding<br>
complications including death. In the current state of warfarin therapy, patients on<br>
warfarin must report to a coagulation lab once a week in order to be monitored and in<br>
order to detect any early risk of bleeding complications. Even with this strict<br>
monitoring system, many patients on warfarin die every year from bleeding<br>
complications.<br>
The potential clinical problems and business risk associated with developing<br>
drugs, which must past through the P450 metabolism "gauntlet", is markedly<br>
increased in the United States by the following two facts: 1) the number of<br>
prescriptions filled in this country has increased to about 3 billion per year or 10 per<br>
person, and 2) patients, particularly those that live longer and have more complex<br>
medical problems, tend to take multiple medications. The latter issue is important<br>
because the incidence of ADRs rises exponentially when subjects take more than four<br>
drugs. Although it is good practice to avoid polypharmacy, in many cases this is not<br>
possible because patients require different classes of drugs to effectively treat<br>
complex medical conditions,<br>
The landscape of drug R&amp;D is littered by failed drugs that were withdrawn by<br>
the FDA because they caused fatal ADRs involving CYP metabolism. These drags<br>
were clinically effective and in many cases commercially successful. Notable drugs<br>
that were withdrawn due to ADR-related deaths involving CYP450 metabolism<br>
include terfenadine (February 1998), astemizole (July 1999) and cisapride (January<br>
2000). In each of these cases, drug interactions involving CYP3A4 caused<br>
concentrations of the pharmaceutical agent to increase to such a degree that it<br>
significantly inhibited a particular type of potassium channel in the heart called Ik,<br>
which in turn, prolonged the QT interval and caused: a potentially fatal form of<br>
ventricular tachyarrhythmia called torsades de pointes.<br>
A warfarin analog that has a controllable and a predictable metabolic fate, not<br>
depending on CYP450, is therefore highly desirable and would be an important<br>
addition to the armamentarium of drugs available for treating atrial fibrillation<br>
patients. Certain warfarin analogs have been previously reported. See, for example,<br>
WO 02/085882, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>

Specific embodiments of the present invention include the following compounds:<br><br>
By "alkyl" .is meant a straight or brasehed, non-cyclic, hydrocarbon.<br>
Examples of alkyl' groups include methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl n-butyl, sec-butyl, .<br>
tert-butyl, pentyl, 2-pentyl, isopeptyl, neopentyi, hexyl, 2-hexyi, 3-hexyI, 3-<br>
methylpentyl, heptyl and octyl "C1-C6 alkyl" denotes straight or branched, non-<br>
cyclic, alkyl groups having 1-6 carbon atoms. Likewise, "C1-C4 alkyl" denotes<br>
straight or branched, non-cyclic, alkyl groups having 1-4 carbon atoms.<br>
The terms "halogen" or "halo" indicate fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine.<br>
The subject invention provides materials and methods for anticoagulant<br>
treatment Advantageously, the therapeutic compounds of the subject invention are<br>
stable in storage but have a shorter half-life in the physiological environment than<br>
other drugs that are available for anticoagulant treatment; therefore, the compounds of<br>
the subject invention can be used with a lower incidence of side effects and toxicity.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the subject invention provides therapeutic anticoagulant<br>
compounds. The compounds of the subject invention can be used to treat at-risk<br>
populations thereby bringing relief of symptoms, improving the quality of life,<br>
preventing acute and long-term complications, reducing mortality and treating<br>
accompanying disorders.<br>
Advantageously, the subject invention provides compounds that are readily<br>
metabolized by the physiological metabolic drug detoxification systems. Specifically,<br>
in a preferred embodiment, the therapeutic compounds of the subject invention<br>
contain a halogenated ester group, which does not detract from the ability of these<br>
compounds to provide a therapeutic benefit, but which makes these compounds more<br>
susceptible to degradation by hydrolases, particularly serum and/or cytosolic<br>
. esterases. Advantageously, the compounds have been found to inhibit the vitamin K<br>
epoxide reductase (VKER) enzyme.<br>
In addition to their activity at the VKER enzyme, the presence of at least one<br>
halogen atom in the ester moiety gives these compounds certain advantageous<br>
properties. Specifically, the addition of halogen to these compounds greatly reduces<br>
or eliminates their metabolism by CYP450; while at the same time greatly increasing<br>
esterase mediated hydrolysis. Thus, halogenation unexpectedly confers a predilection<br>
for esterase metabolism when in the absence of such halogenation there is a<br>
predilection for CXP450 metabolism. This property gives the halogenated ester<br>
compounds important therapeutic advantages over non-halogenated analogs.<br>
Because the halogenated compounds of the subject invention do not depend on<br>
CYP450 enzymes for metabolism, they are not likely to interact with other drags at<br>
the CYP450 site and therefore they are safe to use in patients who are already taking<br>
other medications, unlike their non-halogenated analogs. The compounds of the subject<br>
invention are useful in methods of treatment comprising the administration of these<br>
compounds to individuals in need of anticoagulant treatment.<br>
In a further embodiment, the subject invention'pertains to breakdown products<br>
that are formed when the therapeutic compounds of the subject invention are acted<br>
upon by esterases. These breakdown products can be used, for example, as described<br>
herein to monitor the clearance of the therapeutic compounds from a patient<br>
The compounds of the subject invention are useful in methods for the treatment of<br>
coagulation disorders. Specifically, the subject invention provides compounds which<br>
are readily metabolized by the hydrolytic drug detoxification systems preferentially to<br>
the oxidative drug detoxification. system. Specifically, this invention provides<br>
compounds that are susceptible to degradation by hydrolases, particularly serum<br>
and/or cytosolic esterases.<br>
This invention is drawn to compounds which are more easily metabolized by<br>
the hydrolytic drug detoxification systems.<br>
Specifically, this invention provides analogs of<br>
drugs which have been designed to be more susceptible to degradation by hydrolases,<br>
particularly serum and/or cytosolic esterases and methods of treatment comprising the<br>
administration of these analogs to individuals.<br>
Advantageously, use of the compounds of the subject invention can result in a<br>
reduction of clinically relevant metabolic interactions involving the CYP system<br>
(particularly the CYP3A4 fraction) and helps to avoid ADRs. These compounds do<br>
not rely on the CYP450 enzyme system, but instead, exploit widely distributed<br>
esterases for metabolism and generation of a metabolite that is substantially<br>
pharmacologically inactive. This approach makes anticoagulant agents safer while<br>
maintaining efficacy, and also significantly reduces the financial risk of drug<br>
development.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the subject invention, therapeutic compounds<br>
are provided which are useful in providing anticoagulant treatment and which contain<br>
a halogenated ester group that is acted upon by hydrolytic enzymes, thereby breaking<br>
down the compound to a substantially inactive and water soluble metabolite and<br>
facilitating its efficient removal from the treated individual. As referred to herein, a<br>
"substantially inactive" metabolite may exhibit, e.g., less than or equal to about 10%<br>
(and more preferably less than or equal to about 5%; even more preferably less than<br>
or equal to about 2%; and most preferably less man or equal to about 1%) of the<br>
parent compound's activity. In a preferred embodiment the therapeutic compounds<br>
are metabolized by plasma esterases, tissue esterases, and/or non-oxidatrve/hydrolytic<br>
microsomal esterases.<br>
A further aspect of the subject invention pertains to the breakdown products<br>
that are produced when the therapeutic compounds of the subject invention are acted<br>
upon by esterases. The presence of these breakdown products in the urine or serum<br>
can be used to monitor the rate of clearance of the therapeutic compound from a<br>
patient<br>
The ester linkage may be introduced into<br>
the compound at a site that is convenient in the manufacturing process for the target<br>
drug. Additionally, the sensitivity of the ester linkage may be manipulated by the<br>
addition of side groups which hinder or promote the hydrolytic activity of the<br>
hydrolases or esterases responsible for cleaving the drug at the ester locus. Methods<br>
of adding such side groups, as well as the side groups themselves, are well known to<br>
the skilled artisan and can be readily carried out utilizing the guidance provided<br>
herein.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are useful in anticoagulant treatment comprising the<br>
administration of a therapeutically effective amount of halogenated ester compounds<br>
to an individual in need of treatment Accordingly, the subject invention provides<br>
halogenated esters and pharmaceutical compositions of these ester compounds. In a<br>
preferred embodiment the patient is a human; however, non-human animals also can<br>
be treated.<br>
Adverse drug-drug interactions (DDI), elevation of liver function test (LFT)<br>
values, and QT prolongation leading to torsades de pointes (TDP) are three major<br>
reasons why drug candidates fail to obtain FDA approval. All these causes are, to<br>
some extent, metabolism-based. A drug that has two metabolic pathways, one<br>
oxidative and one non-oxidative, built into its structure is highly desirable in the<br>
pharmaceutical industry. An alternate, non-oxidative metabolic pathway provides the<br>
treated subject with an alternative drug detoxification pathway (an escape route) when<br>
one of the oxidative metabolic pathways becomes saturated or non-functional. While<br>
a dual metabolic pathway is desirable and necessary in order to provide an escape<br>
metabolic route in case the primary route is blocked, in the case of VKER inhibitors<br>
such as the disclosed compounds of the subject invention, it is very important that the<br>
primary metabolism route be non-oxidative, because oxidative metabolism is<br>
especially sensitive to drug-drug interactions. The halogenated esters of this<br>
invention are primarily, if not only, metabolized by esterases, a non-oxidative<br>
enzymatic system, and therefore are especially useful to treat patients who are taking<br>
other medications.<br>
Additional modifications of the compounds disclosed herein can readily be<br>
made by those skilled in the art. Thus, analogs and salts of the exemplified<br>
compounds are within the scope of the subject invention. With a knowledge of the<br>
compounds of the subject invention, skilled chemists can use known procedures to<br>
synthesize these compounds from available substrates. As used in this application,<br>
the term "analogs" refers to compounds which are substantially the same as another<br>
compound but which may have been modified by, for example, adding additional side<br>
groups. The term "analogs" as used in this application also may refer to compounds<br>
which are substantially the same as another compound but which have atomic or<br>
molecular substitutions at certain locations in the compound.<br>
Analogs of the exemplified compounds can be readily prepared using<br>
commonly known, standard reactions. These standard reactions include, but are not<br>
limited to, hydro genation, methylation, acylation, halogenation and acidification<br>
reactions. For example, new salts within the scope of the invention can be made by<br>
adding mineral bases, e.g., NaOH, etc., or strong organic bases, e.g., triethanolamine,<br>
etc., in appropriate amounts to form the salt of the parent compound or its derivative.<br>
Also, synthesis type reactions may be used pursuant to known procedures to add or<br>
modify various groups in the exemplified compounds to produce other compounds<br>
within the scope of the invention.<br>
Non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to<br>
salts of inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, sulfuric, phosphoric, diphosphoric,<br>
hydrobromic, and nitric or salts of organic acids such as formic, citric, malic, maleic,<br>
fumaric, tartaric, succinic, acetic, lactic, memanesulfonic, p-toluenesulfonic, 2-<br>
hydroxyethylsulfbnic, salicylic and stearic. Similarly, pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
cations include, but are not limited to sodium, potassium, calcium, aluminum, lithium<br>
and ammonium. Those skilled in the art will recognize a wide variety of non-toxic<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts. The present invention also encompasses<br>
prodrugs of the compounds of the present invention.<br>
Advantageously, the halogenated compounds are less favorable substrates for<br>
cytochrome CYP450 than their non-halogenated analogs. They are therefore more<br>
likely to be metabolized by esterases, which is desirable for eliminating drug-drug<br>
interactions according to the subject invention.<br>
The syndesis of the compounds of the present invention can be achieved as shown in<br>
scheme 1.<br><br>
la scheme 1, 4-hydroxycournarin and an optionally<br>
substituted aromatic aldehyde are heated in a mixture of triethylamine and formic acid<br>
(2:5 molar ratio) to give the correspondingly substituted 3-benzyI-4-hydroxycoumarin<br>
wherein R is defined as above.<br>
The subject invention further pertains to enantiomericallyenriched compounds,<br>
and compositions comprising the compounds, useful for the treatment of<br>
coagulation disorders. The isolated enantiomeric forms of the compounds of the<br>
invention are substantially free from one another (i.e., in enantiomeric excess). In<br>
other words, fee "R" forms of the compounds are substantially free from the "S"<br>
forms of the compounds and are, thus, in enantiomeric excess of the "S" forms.<br>
Conversely, "S" forms of the compounds are substantially free of "R" forms of die<br>
compounds and are, thus, in enantiomeric excess of the "R" forms. In one<br>
embodiment of the invention, the isolated enantiomeric compounds are at least about<br>
in 80% enantiomeric excess. In a preferred embodiment, the compounds are in at<br>
least about 90% enantiomeric excess. In a more preferred embodiment, the<br>
compounds are in at least about 95% enantiomeric excess. In an even more preferred<br>
embodiment, the compounds are in at least about 97.5% enantiomeric excess. Ia a<br>
most preferred embodiment the compounds are in at least 99% enantiomeric excess.<br>
The compounds of the subject invention are useful in methods for treating coagulation disorde<br>
comprising the administration of a therapeutically effective amount of the halogenated<br>
esters of this invention to an individual in need of treatment. The therapeutic<br>
compounds of this invention have applicability in both veterinary and human clinical<br>
contexts. Further, the compounds of this invention have therapeutic properties similar<br>
to those of the unmodified parent compound (COUMADIN). Accordingly, dosage<br>
rates and routes of administration of the disclosed compounds are similar to those<br>
already used in the art and known to the skilled artisan (see, for example, Physicians'<br>
Desk Reference, 54th Ed., Medical Economics Company, Montvale, NJ, 2000 or U.S.<br>
Patent 5,856,525 ).<br>

Using methods and procedures essentially analogous to those in Example 6,<br>
the (S,R) diastereomer from Example 6, step 2 wis hydrolyzed to afford the desired<br>
(R)-isomer of the alcohol, which was then coupled with 4-carboxybenzaldehyde to<br>
afford (R&gt;3,3,4,4,4-pentafIiiorobutan-2-yl 4-formyIbenzoate, which was then coupled<br>
with 4-hydroxycoumarin to afford the title compound.<br>
The sodium salt was made as follows: the free acid (1.605 g, 3.63 mmol) and<br>
NaHC03 (303 mg, 3.62 mmol) were dissolved in a-cetonitrile (20 mL), water (5 mL),<br>
and then lyophilaed to yield the Na-salt, as a white solid. MS m/e 465 (MNa4), 441<br>

Example 9 —Effects of compounds on vitamin K epoxide reductase activity<br>
Compounds of the subject invention were tested against vitamin K epoxide<br>
reductase.<br>
Briefly: increasing concentrations of compounds were incubated in the<br>
presence of vitamin K epoxide and in the presence of a bovine microsomal<br>
preparation containing vitamin K epoxide reductase. The amount of residual vitamin<br>
K epoxide at the end of the incubation period was directly proportional to the<br>
inhibitory activity of the test compounds on the enzyme.<br>
The tests were performed as follows:<br>
Microsomes were prepared from fresh cow liver according to the method<br>
described in: 'Turification of gamma-glutamyl carboxylase from bovine liver. Wu<br>
SM, Mutucumarana VP, and Stafford DW. Methods in Enzymology (1997) 28Z:346-<br>
57."<br>
Serial dilutions of test compounds were prepared as follows: Dissolve trie test<br>
compounds to a final dilution of lOmM either in water or in DMSO (if not sohi"ble in<br>
water). From this mother solution, prepare 2 further dilutions by diluting it with<br>
water: one 200pM solution and one 5mM solution. Prepare a series of tubes as<br>
follows:<br>
Table 1<br>
Tube# Substrate Water (uL)<br>
1 30uL of 200uM solution 0<br>
2 20p.L of 200 uM solution 10<br>
3 1 OuL of 200uM solution 20<br>
4 45 uL of 5 uM solution<br>
5 30<br>
6 30<br>
7 30<br>
8 30<br>
9 30<br>
Remove 15uL from tube 4 and add to tube 5, vortex, then remove 15juL from<br>
tube 5 and add to tube 6, vortex, etc... until 15uL is added to tube 9. Vortex and then<br>
remove 15p.L from tube 9.<br>
Prepare another set of 4 tubes and add 30uL of water.<br>
A reaction mixture consisting of 600uL buffer (2.5M NaCl, 0.125M MOPS,<br>
pH7.5), 520uL water, and 150pL of 10% CHAPS was prepared. The tubes were kept<br>
on ice for 5 minutes and then 500uL of microsomal preparation was added. The<br>
mixture was mixed by vortex and kept on ice for 10 min for sufficient solubilization.<br>
To this was added 150uL of vitamin K epoxide solution (1.5mg/ml in isopropanol),<br>
then again vortexed and kept on ice for 5 minutes. An aliquot (70uL) of this reaction<br>
mix was added to each one of the series of tubes prepared as above and containing<br>
serial dilutions of test compounds in 30uL of water. The tubes were then vortexed<br>
and then kept on ice for 5 min. To 2 of the water-containing tubes was addecl 500pL<br>
of a stop reagent consisting of 5 volumes of 50mM AgN03 and 5 volumes of<br>
isopropanol. These 2 tubes were used to measure a zero value.<br>
The tubes were placed in a 30C mixer for 3 min and 5uL of IOOidlM DTT<br>
solution in water was added. The tubes were then vortexed and kept in "the dark<br>
without shaking for another 20 min, at the end of which 500uL of the stop&gt; reagent<br>
was added.<br>
To each tube was then added 600uL of a lOOug/ml solution of vitamin E in<br>
hexane, the tubes were capped and then vortexed for 1 minute. The tubes were then<br>
centrifuged for 5 min at 5,000g3 and the upper layer (the hexane layer) was transferred<br>
to a series of fresh tubes. The hexane was evaporated at room temperature in the dark<br>
using a speedvac, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in 100p.L of methanol.<br>
The amount of vitamin K epoxide in each sample was then measured using a<br>
HPLC determination method. Residual vitarnin K epoxide was then plotted against<br>
test compound concentration. The results are shown in Figures 1-9.<br>
Example 10-Metabolism in pooled human microsomes<br>
Pooled human liver microsomes were used as an in vitro model of drug<br>
metabolism. These microsomes contain both esterase and CYP450 drug metabolizing<br>
enzymes. Pooled human microsomes were suspended in Tris buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4)<br>
at a final concentration of 1 mg/mL of microsomal protein. Test compounds<br>
dissolved in acetonitrile:DMSO (1:99) were added to a final concentration of 2 uM.<br>
Incubations were performed at 37° C and samples (50 uL) were collected after 5, 15,<br>
30, 60 and 90 minutes and then were precipitated by the addition of 100 uL of<br>
acetonitrile containing Internal Standard and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at<br>
4°C. Samples were analyzed by LC/MS/MS for the content of parent drag.<br>
To determine the role of CYP450 in the metabolism, incubations were run<br>
either with or without an NADPH regenerating system - NADPH is an obligate<br>
cofactor for CYP450 enzymes. Incubations that included NADPH cofactor represent<br>
the total metabolism by CYP450 + esterase. Incubations that do not contain any<br>
NADPH represent esterase metabolism alone. Thus, when the relative decline of<br>
parent drug observed is greater in the presence of NADPH, the metabolism is<br>
CYP450-mediated. When the relative decline is equivalent in the presence and<br>
absence of cofactor the metabolism is esterase mediated.<br>
An additional set of incubations was run as a control: these incubations did not<br>
contain microsomes and established the stability of the compound in the test system.<br>
All of the compounds were stable.<br>
The test compounds had the general formula:<br><br>
wherein R represents a group capable of forming an ester moiety. Similar structures<br>
were tested such that the only difference was the presence or the absence of a halogen<br>
atom in the ester group. Results are shown in Figures 12-14.<br>
Similarly, compounds were tested in which R is CH3, CH2-CH3, (O^CHs,<br>
CH2-CHrOH, CH2-C(CH3)3, CH2-CH2-O-CH3, 1-pyrroUdinylethyl, CH2-CH2-S02-<br>
CH3, benzyl, CH2-CH2-0-Phenyl, CHa-CHs-SQj-PhenyL CH2-Cyclopropyl, phenyl,<br>
substituted phenyl. In all cases CYP450 was either the only metabolic agent, or if<br>
esterases were present, CYP450 was the major pathway. Other halogenated esters<br>
were tested such as compounds in which R is CH(CH2Fh, C(CH3)(CF3)2,<br>
polyfiuorinated cyclohexyl. In every case the metabolism was mainly by esterase.<br>
In a separate set of incubations the effects of paraoxon, a known esterase<br>
inhibitor, were tested in order to confirm that the metabolism observed was due to<br>
esterase. Paraoxon, at a final concentration of 320 ug/mL, effectively inhibited the<br>
metabolism of the halogenated esters, as is shown in Figure 15, coiifirming that<br>
esterase was the primary enzyme involved in the metabolism of halogenated<br>
compounds.<br>
Further data generated essentially using the assay protocol described above<br>
appears below.<br><br>
Example 11 HEK-293 Cell Stadv<br>
Electrophysiological recordings of Ik* in stably transfected HEK-293 cells<br>
were made in the whole cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique (Hamill et al,<br>
1981) using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Patch<br>
microelectrodes were pulled from 1.5-mm borosilicate glass tubing using a two-stage<br>
vertical pipette puller (Narishige, East Meadow, NY). When filled with recording<br>
solution, patch microelectrodes had a resistance of 3-5 MO. HEK-293 cells were<br>
plated in 35 mm plastic cell and tissue culture dishes for 2-3 days. For application of<br>
drag-containing solutions to cells, the SF-77B system (Warner Instrument Corp,<br>
Hamden, CT) was used. Solution exchanges were completed within 20 ms. Current<br>
data were digitized online using a DigiData 1200A analog-to-digital board (Axon<br>
Instruments) and stored on the hard disc of an IBM compatible Pentium computer<br>
(GP7-600 MHz, Gateway Computer, Sioux City, ND). Voltage-clamp experimental<br>
protocols and off-line data analysis were performed using the software program<br>
pCLAMP7 (Axon Instruments). The experiments were performed at room<br>
temperature (22-23°C).<br>
The composition of the extracellular control solution is described in the table<br>
below. Its pH was adjusted to 7.4 using NaOH.<br>
The solution for filling the patch electrodes is described in the table below and<br><br>
The effect of warfarin, 2,2,2-trifluoro-l-methyl-l-(trifluoromethyl)ethyl 4-[(4-<br>
hydroxy-2-oxo-2H-chromen-3-yl)methyl]benzoate and its corresponding acid<br>
metabolite, 4-[(4-hydroxy-2-oxo-2H-chromen-3-yl)methyl]benzoic acid on IKr was<br>
studied in a stably transfected HEK-293 cell line using a two-pulse protocol. Cells<br>
were clamped at a holding potential of-80 mV and depolarized to +10 mV for a 20 s<br>
period to activate IKr and tlien a repolarizing step to -50 mV was applied for 5 sec to<br>
elicit an outward deactivating tail current (tail Ik,). The two-pulse protocol was<br>
applied every 45 s. Tail IKr amplitude was measured as the difference between the<br>
peak current and baseline current at -50 mV in control and in the presence of ATI-<br>
compounds when steady-state block was obtained<br>
The study showed that 2,2,2-triiluoro-l-methyl-I-{triiIiioromerIryl)et!iyI 4-[(4-<br>
hydroxy-2-oxo-2H-chromen-3-yl)methyr{benzoate and its corresponding acid<br>
metabolite, 4-[(4-hydroxy-2-oxo-2H-chromen-3-yl)inethyl]beriZoic acid, had no<br>
inhibitory effect on human Ikr (IC50 &gt; 100 and &gt;1000 µM, respectively.) Nor did<br>
either compound exhibit significant activity in a broad cellular and biochemical<br>
receptor screening assay, at concentrations up to 10 10µM.<br>
