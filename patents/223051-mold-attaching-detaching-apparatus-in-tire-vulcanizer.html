MOLD ATTACHING/DETACHING APPARATUS IN TIRE VULCANIZER<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a mold<br>
attaching/detaching apparatus in a tire vulcanizer.<br>
Background Art<br>
With the trend of tire width toward smaller size, the<br>
main stream of a mold in a tire vulcanizer is shifting from<br>
a two-piece mold that is vertically divided into two pieces,<br>
to a segmental mold.<br>
This segmental mold includes an upper container plate,<br>
a lower container plate, and a plurality of divided segments<br>
expanding and contracting in radial directions.<br>
An expansion/contraction device for expanding and<br>
contracting the segments of the segmental mold is provided<br>
to a top plate. These segments are adapted to expand and<br>
contract due to an expanding/contracting operation of the<br>
expansion/contraction device and the inner structure of the<br>
segmental mold.<br>
The mold in a tire vulcanizer needs to be replaced in<br>
accordance with the size of a tire to be produced. For this<br>
purpose, locking/unlocking means is provided between the<br>
expansion/contraction device and the upper container plate<br>
of the segmental mold.<br>
As locking/unlocking means provided between the<br>
expansion/contraction device and the upper container plate<br>
of the segmental mold, for example, locking/unlocking means<br>
using a bayonet mechanism as disclosed in Japanese Examined<br>
Patent Application Publication No. 5-62046, has hitherto<br>
been known.<br>
The locking/unlocking means using this bayonet<br>
mechanism includes a bayonet lock provided to the upper<br>
container plate and a bayonet claw provided to the<br>
expansion/contraction device, and has a configuration in<br>
which the bayonet claw is engaged with and disengaged from<br>
the bayonet lock.<br>
However, as before, the locking/unlocking means using<br>
the bayonet mechanism needs to rotate its bayonet claw<br>
provided to the expansion/contraction device to engage with<br>
and disengage from the bayonet lock.<br>
Originally, the function of the expansion/contraction<br>
device is to expand and contract the segments of the<br>
segmental mold by expanding/contracting operations thereof,<br>
and hence, the expansion/contraction device has only to have<br>
a structure allowing expanding/contracting operations.<br>
However, the conventional locking/unlocking means is<br>
required to incorporate a rotational mechanism for rotating<br>
the bayonet claw into the expansion/contraction device.<br>
In the arrangement incorporating the locking/unlocking<br>
means into the expansion / contraction device thereof as described above, a problem has occurred in<br>
that the structure thereof becomes complicated correspondingly, as well as the locking / unlocking<br>
operation also becomes complicated since the locking / unlocking entails a rotational operation.<br>
The present invention has been made for solving the above-described conventional problem.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a mold attaching / deataching apparatus in a tire<br>
vulcanizer, having locking / unlocking means configured to perform an engagement and<br>
disengagement by utilizing a relative movement between the top plate and bottom plate of the tire<br>
vulcanizer in a horizontal direction, and thereby capable of being inexpensively constructed by<br>
simplifying the structure and operation of the locking / unlocking means.<br>
To solve the above-described problems, the present invention provides a mold<br>
attaching / deataching apparatus in a tire vulcanizer. Herein, the tire vulcanizer has a top<br>
plate and a bottom plate relatively moving in a horizontal direction, and relatively moving<br>
in a vertical direction at a vulcanizing position; a segmental mold that includes an upper<br>
container plate, a lower container plate, and a plurality of divided segments extending and<br>
contracting in radial directions, and that is replaceably<br>
placed on the bottom plate; an expansion/contraction device<br>
mounted to the top plate, and expanding and contracting the<br>
segments of the segmental mold; a locking/unlocking means<br>
provided between the expansion/contraction device and the<br>
upper container plate; and the segmental mold being held<br>
between the top plate and the bottom plate to perform<br>
vulcanization at the vulcanizing position, and opened and<br>
closed while expanding and contracting the segments by<br>
raising and lowering the top plate and operating an<br>
expansion/contraction device, in an engaged state of the<br>
locking/unlocking means. Herein, the locking/unlocking<br>
means includes a locking piece provided in the<br>
expansion/contraction device, and a receiving piece provided<br>
to the upper container plate of the segmental mold. The<br>
locking/unlocking means is configured so that the locking<br>
piece horizontally moves to below the receiving piece and is.<br>
engaged with the receiving piece when the<br>
expansion/contraction device mounted to the top plate and<br>
the segmental mold placed on the bottom plate move to the<br>
vulcanizing position where the center of the<br>
expansion/contraction device and the center of the segmental<br>
mold coincide with each other by a relative movement between<br>
the expansion/contraction device mounted to the top plate<br>
and the segmental mold placed on the bottom plate in the<br>
horizontal direction, and so that the locking piece<br>
horizontally moves, from below the receiving piece and is<br>
disengaged from the receiving piece when the<br>
expansion/contraction device or the segmental mold moves to<br>
an offset position shifted from the vulcanizing position in<br>
the horizontal direction.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Hereinafter, an embodiment according to the present<br>
invention will be described with respect to the drawings.<br>
The specific construction of the present invention is not<br>
limited by the embodiment described below.<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic sectional view showing a mold<br>
attaching/detaching apparatus in a tire vulcanizer,<br>
according to the embodiment. Fig. 2 is a sectional view<br>
taken along a line A-A in Fig. 1. Figs. 3 to 6 are each an<br>
explanatory view of an operation of a locking/unlocking<br>
means provided in the mold attaching/detaching apparatus.<br>
In these figures, numeral 1 denotes a top plate, 2<br>
denotes a bottom plate. These top plate 1 and bottom plate<br>
2 are supported so as to relatively move in a horizontal<br>
direction, and relatively move in a vertical direction at a<br>
vulcanizing position M.<br>
In this embodiment, the top plate 1 is mounted to a<br>
main body cylinder (not shown), and at the vulcanizing<br>
position M, vertically moves up and down between an ascent<br>
position X (the position in Fig. 3) separated from a<br>
segmental mold 3, an opening position Y (the position in<br>
Figs. 4 and 5) for opening the segmental mold 3, and a<br>
closing position Z (the position in Fig. 6) for closing the<br>
segmental mold 3.<br>
The bottom plate 2 is mounted on a carriage (not shown),<br>
and with the segmental mold 3 placed thereon, the bottom<br>
plate 2 laterally move between the vulcanizing position M<br>
(the position in Figs. 5 and 6); an offset position N (the<br>
position in Figs. 3 and 4), which is horizontally shifted by<br>
a small distance L from the vulcanizing position M so as to<br>
be located immediately in front of the vulcanizing position<br>
M; and a mold replacement position (not shown).<br>
On the undersurface of the top plate 1, an upper platen<br>
11 is provided, with an upper heat insulating plate 10<br>
therebetween. On the top surface of the bottom surface 2, a<br>
lower platen 21 is provided, with a lower heat insulating<br>
plate 20 therebetween, and has an annular pressurizing<br>
cylinder 22 incorporated therein.<br>
The segmental mold 3 includes an upper container plate<br>
30 having an upper side-wall mold (not shown) mounted on the<br>
bottom surface thereof; a lower container plate 31 having a<br>
lower side-wall mold (not shown) mounted on the top surface<br>
thereof, and a plurality of divided segments 32 having a<br>
tread mold (not shown) mounted on the inner surface thereof,<br>
and expanding and contracting in radial directions.<br>
On the outer peripheral surface of the upper container<br>
plate 30, a container ring 33 having a tapered inner surface<br>
is fixed. The segments 32 are supported on the upper<br>
container plate 30 so as to slide with respect to the<br>
container ring 33 and upper container plate 30.<br>
The segments 32 perform expanding/contracting<br>
operations with an expansion/contraction device 4 mounted to<br>
the top plate 1. In this embodiment, a fluid pressure<br>
cylinder (hydraulic cylinder) is used as the<br>
expansion/contraction device 4.<br>
With a cylinder rod 40 of the expansion/contraction<br>
device 4 engaged with the upper container plate 30, the<br>
segments 32 opens and closes due to expanding/contracting<br>
operations of the cylinder rod 40 and the inner structure of<br>
the segmental mold 3 (detailed descriptions are omitted).<br>
The segmental mold 3 needs to be replaced in accordance<br>
with the size of a tire to be produced. For this purpose,<br>
locking/unlocking means is provided between the<br>
expansion/contraction device 4 and the upper container plate<br>
30.<br>
The locking/unlocking means is constituted of a locking<br>
piece 50 formed at the front end of the cylinder rod 40 of<br>
the expansion/contraction device 4 so as to Jut out outward<br>
along the circumference, and a receiving piece 61 formed in<br>
a receiving block 60 mounted to the upper container plate 30,<br>
The receiving block 60 has a long slotted hole 62<br>
formed in the moving direction of the bottom plate 2, and<br>
the receiving piece 61 is formed at the upper edge on one<br>
side of the slotted hole 62 so as to jut out inward semi-<br>
arcuately. The locking piece 50 is formed so as to be<br>
engaged with the receiving piece 61, at the vulcanizing<br>
position M, and so as to be disengaged from the receiving<br>
the offset position N.<br>
Specifically, when a new replaced segmental mold 3 is<br>
connected to the tire vulcanizer, in a state where the top<br>
plate 1 is located at the rising position as shown in Fig. 3<br>
the bottom plate 2 on which the segmental mold 3 is placed<br>
moves from the mold replacement position to the offset<br>
position N.<br>
Next, as shown in Fig. 4, the top plate 1 moves down to<br>
the opening position Y together with the liquid pressure<br>
cylinder serving as the expansion/contraction device 4. At<br>
this time, the front end of the cylinder rod 4 0 is inserted<br>
into the slotted hole 62 of the receiving block 60. In this<br>
state, however, the locking piece 50 and receiving piece 61,<br>
which serve as the locking/unlocking means, are not yet<br>
engaged with each other.<br>
Then, as shown in Fig. 5, the segmental mold 3 placed<br>
on the bottom, plate 2 moves from the offset position N to<br>
the vulcanizing position M, and thereby the center of the<br>
expansion/contraction device 4 mounted to the top plate 1<br>
and the center of the segment mold 3 placed on the bottom<br>
plate 2 coincide with each other at the vulcanizing position<br>
M. By this movement, in the slotted hole 62, the locking<br>
piece 50 horizontally moves to below the receiving piece 61<br>
and is engaged with the receiving piece 61.<br>
Herein, the locking/unlocking means is formed so that a<br>
little gap occurs between the locking piece 50 and receiving<br>
piece 61 in a mutual engaged state.<br>
Even though there occurs a gap between the locking<br>
piece 50 and receiving piece 61 in. this way, it does not<br>
interfere with operations of the expansion/contraction<br>
device 4. The provision of this gap enables the locking<br>
piece 50 to smoothly perform a horizontal movement between<br>
the offset position N and vulcanizing position M.<br>
After the liquid pressure cylinder serving as the<br>
expansion/contraction device 4 and the upper container plate<br>
30 of the segmental mold 3 have been connected with each<br>
other in this manner, as shown in Fig. 6, the top plate 1 is<br>
lowered to the closing position Z, and the top plate 1 and<br>
upper container plate 30 are connected with fastening means<br>
such as bolts, thus completing connecting work for the mold.<br>
When replacing the mold, in order to release the<br>
connection between the segmental mold 3 and tire vulcanizer,<br>
the reverse operations (Fig. 6 ? Fig. 3) of the foregoing<br>
is to be performed.<br>
The vulcanization of a tire is performed in a state<br>
where, at the vulcanizing position M, the top plate 1<br>
connected with the upper container plate 30 moves down from<br>
the opening position Y to the closing position Z, and the<br>
segmental mold 3 is held between the top plate 1 and bottom<br>
plate 2. In this situation, inside the segmental mold 3,<br>
there is provided a bladder (not shown) expanding and<br>
contracting under the supply/discharge of a heating fluid.<br>
and the bladder expanded by the supply of the heated fluid<br>
is pressed against the inner surface of a raw tire set<br>
inside the segmental mold 3, and heating is performed by the<br>
upper platen 11 and lower platen 21, whereby the<br>
vulcanization molding is performed.<br>
The insertion/withdrawal of the tire in/from the<br>
segmental mold 3 is performed by opening and closing the<br>
segmental mold 3 while expanding and contracting the segment<br>
32, by raising and lowering the top plate 1 between the<br>
opening position Y and closing position Z, as well as<br>
expanding and contracting the expansion/contraction device 4,<br>
in a mutual engaged state between the locking piece 50 and<br>
receiving piece 61, which serve as the locking/unlocking<br>
means.<br>
In the present invention, it is essential only that the<br>
top plate and bottom plate can relatively move in the<br>
horizontal direction and that they can relatively move in<br>
the vertical direction at the vulcanizing position. Hence,<br>
contrary to the above-described embodiment, the top plate<br>
may be caused to move in the horizontal direction, and the<br>
bottom plate may be caused to move up and down.<br>
As the expansion/contraction device, a fluid pressure<br>
cylinder or motor-operated cylinder is usually employed.<br>
However, the expansion/contraction device is not limited to<br>
such a cylinder, but may include any one performing an<br>
expanding/contracting operation.<br>
Also, the engaging means is not limited, to a locking<br>
piece and receiving piece as in the embodiment, but may<br>
include any ones that are configured so as to be engaged<br>
with each other in a state where the top plate and bottom<br>
plate coincide with each other at the vulcanizing position,<br>
and so as to be disengaged from each other at the offset<br>
position where the top plate or bottom plate is shifted from<br>
the vulcanizing position in the horizontal direction.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
As described above, the mold attaching/detaching<br>
apparatus in a tire vulcanizer, according to the present<br>
invention has locking/unlocking means that performs<br>
engagement and disengagement utilizing the relative movement<br>
between the top plate and bottom plate of the tire<br>
vulcanizer. Therefore, there is no need to incorporate a<br>
rotational mechanism into the expanding/contracting device,<br>
unlike the conventional locking/unlocking means using a<br>
bayonet mechanism. This simplifies the structure and<br>
operation of the locking/unlocking means, and produces an<br>
effect of allowing an inexpensive construction.<br>
