				<td>METHOD  AND  APPARATUS  FOR  CHECKING  THE  QUALITY OF SERVICE PROVIDED  BY  A  CELLULAR TELEPHONE SYSTEM<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to performance testing of communications systems, and specifically to checking the quality of cellular telephone systems.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Cellular telephone systems operating in a given region comprise a number of base transceiver stations (BTSs) which are capable of receiving signals from, and transmitting signals to, portable telephones in the region. The quality of the service (QoS) provided is an important aspect of the system, and, accordingly, system operators require measurements of the quality of service provided by each of the base stations.<br>
U.S. patent 5,490,204, to GuUedge, which is incorporated herein by reference, describes an automated quality assessment system for cellular networks. The system uses a mobile station, comprising a laptop computer coupled to a station system controller and a cellular telephone, to check the quality of service provided by a base station.<br>
Airlink Communications, Inc., of San Jose, California, produce a field diagnostic and measurement tool, called an Airlink CDPD (Cellular Digital Packet Data) Cell Wizard. The tool comprises a laptop computer coupled to a CDPD modem and a global positioning system (GPS) receiver, enabling an operator to identify problems at a known position in a network.<br>
Ameritec Corporation, of Covina, California, produce a problem identification system called SWARM. The system comprises a master unit coupled to a base station, and a number of mobile responders, which are operated remotely by the master unit. Each responder comprises a cellular telephone and controlling circuitry. The master tmit originates and terminates calls to the responders, and is able to measure audio quality using a multiple-tone testing method. The responders perform network parametric tests, and results are uploaded to the master unit.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of some aspects of the present invention to provide methods and apparatus for improved checking of the quality of service provided by a base transceiver station in a cellular telephone system.<br>
It is another object of some aspects of the present invention to provide methods and apparatus for substantially simultaneous transmission of calls and analysis of the quality of the calls.<br>
It is a further object of some aspects of the present invention to provide improved methods and apparatus for checking the quality of service provided by a code division multiple access telephone system.<br>
In preferred embodiments of the present invention, a quality of service (QoS) checker unit comprises two transceivers, most preferably cellular telephones, mounted in a weatherproof enclosure. The unit is located in a region within contact of but remote from a base station, and operates as a quahty of service checker unit for the base station. The unit may be attached to a fixed object, such as a pole or a wall, or mounted in a mobile vehicle.<br>
One of the two transceivers, herein termed the call transceiver, is used to receive call signals and return call signals via the base station. The call signals may be call signals directed to the transceiver, or other radiofrequency signals which are received by the call transceiver. The QoS unit comprises a controller, which performs measurements on the call signals received and/or returned, and based on the measurements calculates parameters indicative of the quality of service (QoS) of the transmissions from the base station. The other transceiver, herein termed the control transceiver, is used independently of the call transceiver to transmit data signals comprising the QoS parameters for further analysis. The control transceiver may transmit data at substantially the same time as the call receiver is receiving, or at some later time. The control transceiver is also used to receive data signals, for example data comprising control information for the call transceiver and/or instructions regarding the measurements to be performed, transmitted via the base station.<br>
In some preferred embodiments of the present invention, call signals and/or data transfer are initiated by a testing facility, remote from the base station and the unit. Alternatively, the call signals and/or data trarisfer are initiated by the unit, for transmission to the testing facility. Preferably, the testing facility communicates with the unit via the base station using an<br><br>
industry-standard protocol. Most preferably, the testing facility comprises a dedicated server which is able to communicate with a user using an industry-standard browser via an industry-standard network such as the Internet.<br>
In some preferred embodiments of the present invention, control software is loaded into the controller to enable the unit to operate substantially independently and automatically. Most preferably, the control software comprises instructions for the unit to initiate and receive call signals, to analyze call signals, and to store results of the analysis in a memory contained in the unit. The control software may be updated via an external cormector on the unit, or over the air (OTA) via the control transceiver. While software is being updated, the unit is able to continue initiating, receiving, and analyzing call signals, via the call transceiver, according to previously installed software. It will be appreciated that the use of two transceivers in a unit, one for call signals and one for data trarrsfer, significantly improves the flexibility and real-time operation of the system, compared to systems at present known in the art using a single transceiver.<br>
In some preferred embodiments of the present invention, the calls placed are "looped-back" automatically, i.e., the calls and/or analyzed data from the calls are automatically returned to an originator of the call. Comparison of the original call with the returned call or analyzed data enables a quality of service measure to be made for the call.<br>
In some preferred embodiments of the present invention, the calls initiated or received are in the form of digital signals, and the digital signals are analyzed to measure the QoS. Cellular telephone transmissions are typically in the form of spread frequency spectrum transmissions, such as code division multiple access (CDMA), wherein analysis of network behavior is difficult. Use of digital signal transmission and analysis when the network is operating with one of these types of spread-spectrum transmission significantly enhances the overall network analysis capability of the present invention.<br>
In some preferred embodiments of the present invention, calls between the checker unit and the base station are initiated by the base station and terminate at the unit, or vice versa.<br>
In some preferred embodiments of the present invention, calls are placed between the call transceiver and the control transceiver via the base station, and the calls are analyzed.<br>
In some preferred embodiments of the present invention, a plurality<br><br>
of QoS checker units are located within contact of but remote from a plurality of base stations, and are operated and controlled by a testing facility.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 1, which schematically illustrates a general layout of a cellular wireless coverage system 20 using a quality of service (QoS) checker unit 32, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. System 20 comprises a base station transceiver 22, which transmits signals to and receives signals from cellular telephones 34 in a base station operating region 24.<br>
QoS checker unit 32 is located in region 24, remote from the base station, and operates independently of the base station. Call signals are transmitted between the base station and the unit, and the call signals are analyzed in the unit and/or the base station. Most preferably, results of the analysis, giving one or more measures of the quality of the transmissions between the unit and the base station, are transmitted onward, for example, to a telephone 34 in region 24, to a telephone outside the region, or to a<br><br>
remote testing facility 35. Alternatively, the results are acted upon by the base station. Preferably, remote testing facility 35 comprises a central processing unit 37, operating as a manager 39 for unit 32. Most preferably, manager 39 communicates with unit 32 via an industry-standard protocol such as TCP/IP using IS-707 services. A user 43 is able to communicate with manager 39 via a user interface 41 by, most preferably, using a standard browser utilizing a hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) and/or a small network management protocol (SNMP). Preferably, the communication between user 43 and manager 39 utilizes an industry-standard network such as the Internet and/or a public service telephone network. Thus, any standard computer station at substantially any point may be used to observe the testing results from unit 32. The detailed operation and construction of checker unit 32, and working modes utilizing and/or reading results provided by the unit, are described hereinbelow.<br>
Fig. 2 is a schematic block diagram showing the major elements of unit 32, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Most preferably, xanit 32 is encased in a weatherproof outer casing 36, and is fixedly mounted thereby to an immobile surface in region 24 (Fig. 1) and receives power from an AC line therein. Alternatively, unit 32 is mounted so as to be able to move, for instance, in or on a vehicle, in which case power is preferably provided via a DC line and a DC-AC converter 56.<br>
Unit 32 comprises a "call" transceiver 28 used to receive and transmit calls, and a "control" transceiver 26 used to receive and transmit control and information signals. Most preferably, the transceivers are commercially available cellular telephones, with minor modifications as required, operating on 800 MHz or 1900 MHz bands or other industry-standard wavebands, such as two QCM-800 telephones or two QCM-1900 telephones produced by Qualcomm Inc., San Diego, CA. Transceivers 26 and 28 are coupled to an antenna 38 via a radiofrequency interface board (RIB) 40 and an antenna cormector 58. Most preferably, electromagnetic interference between the transceivers and the remainder of unit 32 is minimized by shielding the transceivers using a grounded metallic plate 60.<br>
The operation of transceivers 26 and 28 is controlled via a central processing board 30, which also receives signals from the transceivers. Board 30 communicates with and receives data and control signals from base station 22 (Fig. 1) over the air via control transceiver 26. Board 30 may also receive data and control signals directly via a cormector 46, mounted on casing 36, which method is most preferably used for initial setup of unit 32.<br><br>
Optionally, board 30 also communicates via a connector 42 with a global positioning system (GPS), as is known in the art, which is most preferably utilized when unit 32 is mobile in the region being checked.<br>
Regulated DC power to transceivers 26 and 28, and to board 30, is supplied from a power supply board 52 and a DC - DC converter 50. Power supply board 52 also powers, via a thermostatic control, a heater 44 which is used to maintain the ambient temperature of unit 32 above its minimum operating temperature, typically 0*^C. Power supply board 52 is driven by a line source external to unit 32, via an AC connector 54. Alternatively, board 52 is driven by an external DC source, via external DC-AC converter 56. Power supply board 52 preferably comprises protection devices at its input, such as current surge protectors and under-voltage and over-voltage luniters, as are known in the art.<br>
Fig. 3 is an isometric, exploded diagram of unit 32, showing the physical layout and positioning of some of the major elements referred to with reference to Fig. 2, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Elements which are substantively identical in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 have identical numbers. Transceivers 26 and 28 are mounted on one side of shield 60, which has central processing board 30 mounted on its other side. Heater 44 is fixedly positioned over board 30 so that it is electrically irisulated from, but in good thermal contact with, the board. A power supply 51 is mounted onto power supply board 52, which is then mounted over heater 44. During assembly of unit 32, connectors 42, 46, 54, and 58 are fixedly located in a connector panel 64, and are coupled as described above to their respective boards, after which cormector panel 64 is affixed to casing 36.<br>
Fig. 4 is a schematic block diagram of radiofrequency interface board 40, shown as a single block in Fig. 2, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Board 40 comprises matching networks 72 and 74, which are coupled to respective RF inputs of transceivers 26 and 28. A power combiner 70, most preferably a Willkinson power combiner, as is known in the art, couples the matching networks to the antenna. A lightning protection device 68, most preferably a X/4 50Q. stub, as is known in the art, is coimected to the anterma side of the combiner.<br>
Fig. 5 is a schematic block diagram of central processing board 30, shown in Fig. 2, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. A central processing unit (CPU) 86, for example, an MPC860 PowerPC core microprocessor produced by Motorola SPS Inc., of Phoenix,<br><br>
Arizona, communicates with and controls the other components of unit 32, and determines the working mode used by the unit. The CPU communicates with the other components via a programmable logic device 76, for example, a 7128A-10 CPLD produced by Altera Corporation, of San Jose, California. The CPU also reads data from and can write data to a nonvolatile flash memory 80 and a volatile synchronous DRAM memory (SDRAM) 82. (Examples of working modes of unit 32 are given hereinbelow.)<br>
Preferably, code to run CPU 86 is stored in memory 80, and during system startup the code is transferred by CPU 86 to SDRAM 82, from which the processor reads its code during operation. The code stored in memory 80 may be updated, for example if a new or different working mode is required, via setup/update connector 46 (Fig. 2), or over the air. Most preferably, SDRAM 82 is also used to store data gathered by unit 32, and this data may also be trarxsferred to flash memory 80. Code for storage within call transceiver 28 or control transceiver 26 may also be transferred when required, under control of CPU 86, via cormector 46 or over the air.<br>
Board 30 further comprises a reset control 78, and a digital temperature sensor 84. Reset control 78, for example an MAX706TCUA, produced by Maxim Integrated Products of Sunnyvale, California, operates at power-up, by deactivating a reset signal to components controlled by controller 76 when the supply voltage is within a predetermined range. Temperature sensor 84, for example an LM75 produced by National Semiconductor Corporation of Santa Clara, California, is used by CPU 86 as a thermostatic control to determine when power to the heater should be supplied, in order to maintain the temperature of unit 32 above its minimum operating temperature and within a predefined range.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 6, which is a flowchart that schematically illustrates an operational mode of unit 32, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. A call signal is received by call transceiver 28 of unit 32. The call signal may be a call directed to transceiver 28 via base station 22, or another radiofrequency signal, such as a pilot signal from the base station, received by transceiver 28. Preferably, the call signal is analyzed by unit 32 according to software preprogrammed into the unit, and the analyzed data is stored within the tmit. Most preferably, operator 43 or manager 39 (Fig. 1) in remote testing facility 35 accesses the analyzed data via control transceiver 26 to determine one or more QoS parameters for base station 22. The analyzed data may also be accumulated<br><br>
over a period of time and stored as a historical data record within memory 80 or DRAM 82 (Fig. 5) of unit 32, for access as required by operator 43 or manager 39. Examples of parameters that may be determined are signal strength, frame error rate, and statistics on dropped calls.<br>
It will be understood that the receiving of call signals using the call transceiver and the access to data using the control transceiver are substantially independent of each other. Thus operator 43 or manager 39 may access substantially real-time analysis data and/or a historical data record from unit 32 while call transceiver is continuing to receive call signals.<br>
Fig. 7A and Fig. 7B are flowcharts that schematically illustrate "loop-back" operational modes of unit 32, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. In a loop-back mode, unit 32 receives a call and automatically returns the call, and/or data measuring the call, to the originator of the call. Fig. 7A shows the steps involved when a call originates from a source remote from base station 22, for example from operator 43 or manager 39. The call is transferred via BTS 22 to call transceiver 28 of unit 32, and the call is then looped back (via the BTS) to the originator of the call. Unit 32 and/or the remote source are able to analyze the call substantially in real-time to determine one or more QoS parameters for the base station, according to software preprogrammed into the unit and the remote source. In the event that unit 32 analyzes the call, the analysis may be accessed by the call originator via control transceiver 26 of unit 32.<br>
Fig. 7B shows the steps involved when BTS 22 originates a call, for example, according to software preprogrammed into the base station. The call is received by call transceiver 28 of unit 32, and the unit then loops the call back to BTS 22. Unit 32 and/or base station 22 analyze the call, as described above with reference to Fig. 7A, according to software preprogrammed into the unit and the base station. The mode of operation illustrated by Fig. 7B is typically used by the BTS to perform self-testing functions. The modes of operation illustrated by Figs. 7A and 7B are typically used when digital call signals such as Markov calls, described in more detail hereinbelow, are looped back.<br>
A Markov call is a loop-back CDMA call wherein an originator sends a predefined sequence of bits according to a predetermined algorithm to a receiver, and the receiver returns the sequence of bits to the originator. As is known in the art, comparison of the received bits with the original sequence enables   either   the   originator   or   the   receiver   to   make   an   objective<br><br>
determination of the quality of the transmission. Most preferably, the software loaded into call originators and unit 32 enables receipt and analysis of Markov calls, so that objective analyses of transmission quality can be made.<br>
Figs. 8A and 8B are flowcharts that schematically illustrate data transfer operational modes of unit 32, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Fig. 8A shows steps involved in a one-way data transfer to unit 32. The steps illustrate a method of downloading software code (S/W) over the air from a system external to unit 32 into a target within the unit. The target may be flash memory 80 (Fig. 5), for example when software controlling unit 32 is to be upgraded, or memory within call transceiver 28 or control transceiver 26 of unit 32. As shown in Fig. 8A, the initiating call has a notification of data transmission embedded in the call, which is conveyed via logic device 76 to CPU 86. When the call is received by unit 32, CPU 86 instructs elements of unit 32 to switch to a data receive mode, in which the data are most preferably received utilizing control transceiver 26. The software code to be transferred is first downloaded via transceiver 26, logic device 76, and CPU 86, to S5mchronous DRAM 82. Depending on the final target for the software, the downloaded software is transferred to an appropriate memory in the call or control transceiver or to flash memory 80.<br>
Fig. 8B shows the steps involved in a two-way data communication with unit 32, for example if one of the analysis parameters stored in the flash memory of unit 32 is to be checked. After receiving an initiating call, unit 32 switches to a receive/transmit mode, most preferably utilizing control transceiver 26. Requests for data values are then transmitted to unit 32, and the values are returned by unit 32 to the call originator, according to predefined software present in the call originator and present in the unit.<br>
Fig. 9 is a flowchart that schematically illustrates communication between call transceiver 28 and control transceiver 26 of unit 32, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. A call is placed by call transceiver 28 to control transceiver 26, via BTS 22. Preferably, the call is placed according to software preprogrammed into unit 32. Alternatively, the call is placed respondent to signals from operator 43 or manager 39. The call i is analyzed by unit 32, and data from the analysis is stored in unit 32, for access as described hereinabove with reference to Fig. 6. The mode of operation illustrated by Fig. 9 is typically used when loop-back tests are to be performed without the involvement of a remote call termination, or when<br><br>
a network load is to be created during a load test.<br>
Fig. 10 schematically illustrates a general layout of a cellular wireless coverage network 100, using a plurality of QoS units 132, a plurality of QoS units 232, and a plurality of QoS units 332, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The internal operation and construction of tmits 132, 232, and 332, are substantially the same as those of unit 32 (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5), and the different numerals are used in the following description to differentiate the positions of the pluralities of units within network 100. While the description below of network 100 refers to two wireless coverage systems within the network, network 100 may be composed of any whole number of wireless coverage systems.<br>
Network 100 comprises a first cellular wireless coverage system 120 having a base transceiver station 122 communicating to a region 124, and a second cellular wireless coverage system 220, having a base transceiver station 222 communicating to a region 224. A region 324 is the region where region 124 and region 224 overlap. Units 132, which are located in region 124 but not in region 324, communicate with base station 122. Units 232, which are located in region 224 but not in region 324, communicate with base station 222. Units 332, which are located in region 324, may communicate with base station 122 and/or base station 222. Each of the pluralities of units 132, 232, and 332, is fixedly positioned, or is mobile in network 100, at a location remote from base stations 122 and 222, as described hereinabove for system 20 (Fig. 1).<br>
Network 100 further comprises testing facility 35, comprising central processing unit 37, manager 39, user interface 41, and user 43, which is able to communicate with each of units 132, 232, or 332, as described above for system 20 (Fig. 1). Thus manager 39 and/or user 43 are able to communicate directly with each unit in network 100. For example, manager 39 and/or user 43 may communicate with a pre-seiected number of units in a specific region of network 100 in a time-slice manner. This mode of operation is useful when manager 39 and/or user 43 want to assess BTS operation and QoS in a specific region.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 11, which is a flowchart that schematically illustrates a "circular" loop-back operational mode with one of the plurality of units 332, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. In a circular loop-back mode, one of the plurality of units 332 receives a call via a first base station and automatically returns the call, and/or data measuring the call, to the originator of the call via a second base<br><br>
station. Manager 39 and/or user 43 initiate a call via one of the base stations to one of the plurality of units 332, and the call is received by the call transceiver of unit, wherein the call is analyzed. Data from the analysis is looped back from the control transceiver of the unit to manager 39 and/or user 43, via the other of the base stations. Thus the forward and return paths of the loop are via different base stations. Circular loop-back modes of operation as described above significantly improve the ability of a manager or user to determine the QoS of a system, for example, when communication via one base station is difficult because of a weak signal. It will be appreciated that circular loop-back modes of operation are only feasible when there are two transceivers in the checking unit.<br>
It will thus be appreciated that the use of two transceivers in the checking unit substantially increases the flexibility and efficacy of the unit in terms of measuring the quality of transmission from a base station to a cellular telephone, compared to units having only one transceiver. It will also be appreciated that other methods of checking apart from those specifically described hereinabove, utilizing two transceivers in a unit, may be used. All such methods are to be considered within the scope of the present invention.<br>
It will be further appreciated that the preferred embodiments described above are cited by way of example, and the full scope of the invention is lunited only by the claims.<br><br><br>
