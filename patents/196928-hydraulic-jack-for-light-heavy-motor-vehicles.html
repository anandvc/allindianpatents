				<td>The present invention relates to a 'Hydraulic Jack for Light &amp; Heavy Motor Vehicles' in the field of automobiles.<br>
NEED FOR HYDRAULIC JACK<br>
Today in this World of speed and motion, man's movement from place to place has been very rapid. Numerous ways of transport and travel have emerged owing to the needs of human being.<br>
When such is the emphasis laid by man on time and comfort, it is of utmost importance to reduce breakdown and unnecessary halts during travelling. A person acquainted with driving problems will certainly understand the difficulties and the frustration due to breakdown of vehicle during journey. In automobile breakdown, not only is our precious time affected but also a great amount of money is wasted due to many factors that lead to breakdown. A few of them are suspension ill effects, engine problems and tyre damage. The most frequently encountered problem is that of tyre damage, be it under inflated tyres or punctured tyres.<br>
Due to God's grace, one may be fit enough to handle the conventional jack and change the tyres. But one fact remains that all are not alike in the matter of strength. Today chunk of fair sex is doing a lot of driving. The change of tyres requires the use of jack. The most commonly adopted is the conventional screw jack. One has to place the jack under the vehicle and operate the lever i.e. physical effort is required to operate the jack and lift the vehicle.<br>
One could overcome these hardships, if he has provided himself with a lifting device that would operate automatically with least or no physical effort being put into it and is also time saving.<br>
After a lot of research and survey, I came up with an innovative idea of 'Hydraulic Jack for Light &amp; Heavy Motor Vehicles'. The major thrust was on handiness and ease of use.<br>
Jack is one of the most essential tools required in the use and function of an automobile. It is the mechanism by which the whole automobile or a part of it can be lifted for either servicing or replacement of tyres. Jacks are classified according to method of operation i.e. Mechanical and Hydraulic. Hydraulic Jacks come in portable type and fixed type. According to the design and size jacks are fixed on the vehicle at different places like under the axle, bumper or body of the vehicle.<br>
Hydraulic jacks have an added advantage over the mechanical jacks as they have a smooth ascend and descend. Lesser effort is needed to raise the load. As friction is less, and they are self lubricating, lesser time is consumed in raising and lowering the jack. The disadvantage of a hydraulic jack is that when a leak of the fluid occurs the jack will either not function properly or not function at all.<br>
In the present day the vehicles are mostly owner driven and should a tyre get punctured, the owner has to get out of the vehicle for lifting the vehicle with a mechanical jack. To reduce the effort on the owners, hydraulic jacks are designed here in for fixing them under the vehicle and an owner can lift the vehicle with much lesser effort and fatigue.<br>
CONVENTIONAL DEVICES<br>
With the development of automobiles, man needed devices, which would lift the automobiles for repair work. The need led to development of jacks, which were manually operated. To reduce manual efforts, further development led to hydraulic, pneumatic, hydro-pneumatic jacks etc..<br>
JACK<br>
Jacks are lifting devices used commonly for lifting of automobiles for repair works. Various types of jacks in common use are:<br>
1.	Screw Jack<br>
2.	Hydraulic Jack<br>
3.	Hydro Pneumatic Jack<br>
4.	Pneumatic Jack.<br>
SCREW JACKS (POWER SCREWS)<br>
The power screws also known as translation screws are used to convert rotary motion into translatory motion. It is used in lathe, presses, clamps, aircrafts control, jack valves etc..<br>
In case of screw jack, a small force applied on the horizontal plane is used to raise or lower a larger load. In most of the power screws, the nut has axial motion force while the screw rotates in its bearings. In some screws, the screw rotates and moves axially against the resisting force while the nut is stationary and in other the nut rotates while the screw moves axially with no rotation.<br>
DISADVANTAGES:<br>
1.	More effort is required<br>
2.	Manufacturing process is complex.<br>
3.	It is heavy for given load capacity.<br>
HYDRAULIC JACK ADVANTAGES:<br>
1.	Less effort is required.<br>
2.	Easily operated.<br>
3.	High Lift.<br>
DISADVANTAGES:<br>
1.	Heavy as fluid weight is also added.<br>
2.	Maintenance is required.<br>
3.	Two valves are required, as against a mechanical jack.<br>
There are mainly two types of hydraulic jacks<br>
1.	Trolley type lifting jack:<br>
2.	Bottle type:<br><br>
a)	Heavy duty<br>
b)	Lightweight.<br>
HYDRO-PNEUMATIC JACK:<br>
This type of jack uses the air under pressure from the compressor to make the fluid flow into the cylinder from a non-return valve. This moves the piston upwards and lifts the load (vehicle). The downword motion of the piston is by a release valve, which will allow the fluid into the out cylinder.<br>
DISADVANTAGES OF HYDRO PNEUMATIC JACK<br>
1.	Air compressor is essential.<br>
2.	Maintenance is required.<br>
3.	Proper sealing is required.<br>
4.	Lubrication is required.<br>
5.	Extra valves are required.<br>
PRE CIPLE:<br>
The Hydraulic Jack for Light &amp; Heavy Motor Vehicles' is based on the law of Pasc; i which says that any force when applied to a confined liquid is transmitted equal :y in all directions throughout the liquid regardless of the shape of the vessel and c i the Virtual Incompressibility of materials.<br>

In the system (see Fig.l), a five-way valve 5 is made which has one inlet 5(a) and five  utlets- four of them namely 6(a),7(a),8(a) &amp; 9(a) connecting to the jacks on the I ont Left, Front Right, Rear Left &amp; Rear Right tyres of the automobile respt tively. The last outlet 5(b) leads to the Brake line of the automobile for Braking purposes. The Master Cylinder 2 of the automobile is provided with an addit mal reservoir 2(b) containing Brake fluid for jacking purpose, along with the Primary reservoir 2(a) already present in the Master Cylinder 2. The Master Cylinder 2 is connected to the manual non-return valve 4 which is further connected to the five-way valve 5. The driver can select whether he has to use the brake or the jack. While driving, the five-way valve 5 is kept towards the brake line 5(b) and non-fturn valve 4 is opened. While using any of the jacks 6, 7, 8 or 9, the non-returrn valve 4 is closed and five-way valve 5 is kept towards the required jack to be lifted<br>
DESCRIPTION:<br>
All present day vehicles are equipped with hydraulic brake systems. Using the mastr  cylinder of the hydraulic brakes system, a hydraulic jack system can be designed. Herein four hydraulic jacks 6, 7, 8 &amp; 9 are provided at suitable places near the four wheels of vehicle. The Front Tyre jacks 6 &amp; 7 are mounted on the From chassis under the Mud guard of the automobile &amp; the Rear Tyre jacks 8 &amp; 9 are n united on the Rear Spring of the automobile. A manually operated non-return checl valve 4 is provided on the fluid line 4(a) from the master cylinder 2 to a five way alve 5. The five way valve 5 can be operated manually. Non-return check valvt 4 is provided so that the fluid does not return back into the master cylinder 2. Whei the master cylinder 2 is being used in the hydraulic brake system of the vehic e, the non-return check valve 4 is manually opened so that it allows the fluid to go back in to the master cylinder 2 when the brake pedal 1 is released.<br>
To prevent the vehicle being operated without the brake system, two micro limit switches 21(a) &amp; 21(b) are provided, 21(a) on the manually operated non-return check valve 4 and 21(b) on the five way plug valve 5. These micro-limit switches 21(a) &amp; 21(b) are kept in series electrically with the battery wire leading to the igniti n switch of the vehicle. The limit switches 21(a) &amp; 21(b) close the circuit only vhen the manually operated non-return check valve 4 is in the open position and the five way plug valve 5 connects the master cylinder 2 to the brake system through the brake line 5(b). Thus, when the master cylinder 2 is being used for liftin the vehicle by any one of the hydraulic jacks 6, 7, 8 or 9, the vehicle will not start. A larger hydraulic fluid reservoir 2(b) will have to be provided for the dual syste I of brakes and jacks.<br>
For 1 ting any one of the front wheels, the jacks 6 &amp; 7 will be permanently fixed by four 0 mm belts and nuts to the front chassis under the front mud guard. The jacks 6 &amp; 7 • ill be fixed between the spaces in the front of the brake line that emerges out<br>
from die mud guard. The lowest point of the jack is kept at the level of the oil charr &gt;er of the vehicle which is the lowest point in the front of the vehicle.<br>
For 1 ting the rear wheels, the jacks 8 &amp; 9 are mounted on to the rear spring about 20 ci from the centre belt of other spring to the front side of the vehicle. A 6 cm space will be welded in the same relative position of the jack which is also suitable for mounting on the two rear springs as in the front spring using 1 cm thick plate for the front chassis.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE MASTER CYLINDER (See Fig.2)<br>
The system has a Master Cylinder 2 of the automobile which is already incorporated in the vehicle for braking purpose. The Master Cylinder 2 has a Primary Piston 12 which is operated by the brake pedal 1 and a Secondary Piston 13 operated by the force exerted by the compression springs 14 when pressure is applied by pushing the brake pedal. The Master Cylinder 2 has two reservoirs, Primary Reservoir 2(a) &amp; Seco dary reservoir 2(b). These reservoirs contain brake fluid which is used for braki g in the hydraulic brake system of the vehicle. When the Brake pedal 1 is pushi J, it pushes the Primary Piston 12 in the forward direction. This linear motion of the Primary Piston 12 is further propagated to the Secondary Piston 13 through Compression springs 14 by using the pressure of the Hydraulic Brake Fluid present in tht Reservoirs 2(a) &amp; 2(b). This pressurized Brake Fluid then travels towards the Non  ' eturn Valve 4 through the path 4(a)<br>
DESCRIPTION OF MANUAL NON RETURN VALUE (See Fig.3)<br>
The manual non-return valve 4 includes a screw operating handle 16 provided on the top with two check nuts 16(a). When the screw operating handle 16 is screwed, it pushi s the Aluminium piston 17 and Compression spring 18 down, thereby pressing the ceck valve 15 on to the rubber seat 20. The pressing down of the Check Valve 15 of MIS the passage shown by arrows and the fluid travels to the outlet of the Non Return Valve 4. The check nuts 16(a) provided on the handle 16 are to adjust the maxium pressure on the jacks. As the spring 18 is compressed further down, the press are will increase. The check nuts are tightened on the handle and also act as a stop for further pressure on the spring 18. There is a groove on the lower end of the handd in which a steel ring sits supporting a flat washer 19 which prevents the hand : from being completely unscrewed from the body. The entry of the hydraulic fluid s from the side 4(a) and outlet at the bottom of the check valve 5(a).<br>
The ianual non-return check valve 4 is required in this system to withhold the press" ire in the jack when the brake pedal 1 is released. As the pedal 1 is released, the n aster cylinder 2 reacts allowing its check valve to open up and ready for another stroke of the pedal 1, pushing the hydraulic fluid from the reservoirs 2(a) &amp; 2(b) . uto the system past the manual non-return check valve 4 to the jacks 6, 7, 8 or 9. 7 IUS the jack with each stroke of the brake pedal 1 is filled with a particular amoi it of brake fluid and is pushed down when manual non-return check valve 4 is in cli sed position.   When the jacks have to be retracted back to the top position,<br>
unsci wing its handle 16 opens up the manual non-return check valve 4 and the fluid will 1 turn back from the jack.<br>
Manual non-return check valve 4 acts also as a relief valve, should the pressure in the system increase beyond the limits specified, the spring 18 on the manual non-return check valve 4 will be pushed up releasing the fluid past the check valve 15 and powering the system. Also should the operator go on pumping the master cylin er 2 after the full extended position of the jack, the check valve 15 will open up and return the liquid to the reservoirs 2(a) &amp; 2(b). A micro-switch 21(a) is instaaled so that when the valve 15 is completely open, it makes contact and completes the battery circuit to the ignition switch.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF FIVE-WAY VALVE (See Fig.4)<br>
The live way valve 5 is one of the essential requirements in this system of hydraulic jackas it is the main controlling point of the passage of hydraulic fluid in the system. It consists of a body with a conical plug 25, compression spring 27, operating handle 24, nicro switch 21(b), hydraulic fluid inlet 5(a) and five outlets 6(a), 7(a), 8(a), 9(a) .a: 5(b). The outlet 5(b) goes to the brake line for normal braking operation.<br>
The fandle 24 of the valve is used to select the direction of flow of the hydraulic fluid It will be seen that the inlet 5(a) of this valve is connected to the check valve 4 which in turn is connected to the master cylinder 2 of the vehicle. The outlet of the valve is at the discretion of the user, i.e. if he would like to use any one of the four jacks 6(a), 7(a), 8(a) or 9(a) or the brake 5(b). When the flow is in the direction of the j;ks, the brakes will not function and vice-versa.<br>
The body 23 of the valve is in the shape of a cylinder and its interior is in the shape of a  one 25. The interior is well ground for good seating of the plug 25. The body 23 haa body cover or plate which is placed on it and is fastened by screws after the plug 5 is placed in the body. The body 23 has an inert port on its circumference at the top. The body plate has markings indicating the direction of the passage for hydralic fluid i.e. right front jack 7(a), left front jack 6(a), right rear jack 9(a), left rear jack 8(a) and brakes 5(b). The operating handle 24 is fixed to the plug 25 by threa s and a check nut 24(a) so as to fix the handle 24 in the direction of the outlet port i f the plug 25. This means that when the handle 24 is in the direction of the left front jack 6(a) marking of the cover plate, it will operate the left front jack on press ng the brake pedal.<br>
The lug 25 is of conical shape and fits into the body 23 having ground finish surfa e so as to not allow any fluid to escape between the body 23 and the plug 25. As and added precaution, grooves are provided on the plug 25 above and below the portfoles wherein rubber '0' rings 25(a) &amp; 25(b) are provided between the inlet and outle ports to prevent fluid leakage from inlet port to outlets ports. The inlet 5(a) in the body 23 opens into a groove 22 in the plug 25 and is connected through an 'L' shape hole in the plug 25 to the different outlets 6(a), 7(a), 8(a) or 9(a) or the brake 5(b). The vertical hole 22 is plugged with the operating handle 24 with a check nut<br>
24(a) A little space is left between the plug 25 and body 23 at the bottom to allow wear in the plug 25 and body 23 surfaces during usage. The bolt 28 is integrated with ne plug 25 and the spring 27 between the nut and the body keeps the plug 25 in place On wear of the plug 25 and body 23, they move down a little, thus increasing the sc iting and causing no leakage.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF JACK (See Fig.5)<br>
The flydraulic Jack consists of a Jack body 33 and a piston 31 which slides inside the Jack body 33. The Piston 31 has a groove wherein Rubber 'O' ring 30 is fitted. On top of the piston 31, a Rubber Cup Washer 29 is fixed. A Flat Steel Washer 34 is fitted between the Piston 31 and the Jack body 33 to wipe off any dust that may cling to the Jack body 33. This Washer 34 is kept pressed against the Jack body 33 by the Compression Spring 32 inside the Piston 31. The assembly is fitted from the bottom with the help of a Ball &amp; Socket Joint 38 attaching the Piston 31 with the Base 37 of the Jack assembly. This Ball &amp; Socket Joint 38 on the Base 37 is provided to allow slight tilting without creating undue stresses on the Base 37 &amp; the Jack 33. A circular Check Nut 35 is also screwed on the lower end of the Jack body 33 around the Ball &amp; So ket Joint 38. This Check Nut 35 also acts as a guide to the Jack 33. A Rubber Boot 36 is provided below the Check Nut 35 to prevent ingress of dust &amp; dirt into the Eill &amp; Socket Joint 38. When the Hydraulic Brake Fluid under pressure enters the J ck body 33 from the inlet 7(a), it pushes the Piston 31 in the downward direction till it is stopped by the Check Nut 35 which rests on the Rubber Boot Seati g 36. Further entry of the Hydraulic Fluid inside the Jack body 33 creates press re in the top portion of the Jack body (shown by shaded area) due to which a back' ard thrust is exerted on the Jack body 33 which leads to its upward movement. This ack body 33 is attached to the tyre of the automobile. Thus, upward movement of the Jack 33 results in lifting the tyre of the vehicle. To prevent the presence of any trapped air bubble inside the Jack body 33, a Bleeder Valve 39 is provided on top of the Jack body 33.<br>
APPLICATION OF HYDRAULIC JACK<br>
The ery innovation of 'Hydraulic Jack for Light &amp; Heavy Motor Vehicles' has unleashed a variety of options for future developments and complete automation.<br>
Apar from fulfilling its primary function for which it was conceptualized and devel &gt;ped, it renders other useful services also.<br>
1)	The primary area of its application is to work as jack to the vehicle to facilitate<br>
the change of punctured tyres.<br>
h case of a punctured tyres on a journey, one is left out with no other option but replacing the tyres with a spare one. The change of tyres involves a tedious procedure of lifting up the vehicle using a conventional jack and lowering it down after the replacement is done. This involves a tremendous amount of peysical effort and one feels really uneasy and frustrated in such circumstances.<br>
2)	feing easy to use one can lift up the vehicle within a minute and all that by just<br>
pushing a pedal. The main advantage of this is considerable amount of time<br>
Saving and requirement of negligible physical effort. While operating it also, the<br>
maintenance required is minimum.<br>
3)	The product 'Hydraulic Jack for Light &amp; Heavy Motor Vehicles' can also be<br>
used by garage personnel for temporary lifting of vehicles for minute<br>
observations or alterations that are to be made, thus saving a considerable time of<br>
their working hours.<br>
Apar from garages, it can also be used at service stations. Although there are Jacks available in the service stations that can lift the vehicle in no time but sometimes durin peak hours or tight schedule, these platforms are busy. In such a case, this device can be used which would certainly increase the working efficiency of worker as it would save the physical effort and time factor involved as compared to the conventional screw jack.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
