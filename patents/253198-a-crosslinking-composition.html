				<td>STABILIZED CROSSLINKING COMPOSITION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is directed to aminoplast-based crosslinking compositions and their<br>
method of preparation. In particular, the invention relates to stabilized aminoplast-based<br>
crosslinking compositions, which are stabilized by organic acids and prepared by reacting<br>
amino compounds with mono(alkylaldehydes) and/or poly(alkylaldehydes) and alcohol.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Traditional industrial coatings have for years been based in significant part on<br>
backbone resins having active hydrogen groups crosslinked with various derivatives of<br>
amino-1,3,5-triazines. Most notable among the amino-1,3,5-triazine derivatives are the<br>
aminoplasts such as the alkoxymethyl derivatives of melamine and guanamines which,<br>
while providing excellent results in a number of aspects, have the disadvantage of<br>
releasing formaldehyde as a volatile by-product under curing conditions and requiring<br>
relatively high temperatures to adequately crosslink the film.<br>
Despite the excellent film coating properties, which can be achieved with<br>
aminoplast crosslinked systems, the coatings industry is under great pressure to reduce<br>
the environmentally undesirable emission of formaldehyde. In addition, high temperature<br>
crosslinking systems require more energy to cure and/or crosslink slower resulting in less<br>
throughput. As a result, it has long been a desire of industry to find acceptable alternative<br>
crosslinkers and coatings systems, which emit no formaldehyde, or low amounts of<br>
formaldehyde, are soluble and/or stable in common solvents used in the coating industry<br>
and cure at relatively lower temperatures.<br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 3, 806, 508 and 4,180,488 disclose the preparation of resins<br>
prepared by reacting melamine with a mono(aikylaldehyde) and an alcohol. However,<br>
neither patent discloses nor teaches the use of organic acids to stabilize the resin<br>
composition.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,454,133 discloses the preparation of antimicrobial compounds<br>
prepared by reacting an amide or imide compound with poly(alkylaldehydes), e.g.,<br>
glutaraldehyde. However, the patent neither discloses nor teaches reacting an amino-<br>
based compound with mono(alkylaldehydes) and/or poly(alkylaldehydes) and alcohol to<br><br>
form a crosslinking composition, nor discloses the use of organic acids to stabilize the<br>
composition.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the present invention, the term "mono(alkylaldehyde)" is an aldehyde having the<br>
general formula: R2-CHO, where R2 is alkyl, halogenated alkyl, aryl, aralkyl, halogenated<br>
aralkyl, alkoxyalkyl or an alkaryl, having from 1 to about 24 carbon atoms or about 1 to 12<br>
carbon atoms or about 1 to 4 carbon atoms.<br>
The term "poly(alkylaldehyde)" is an aldehyde having the general formula:<br>
B-[-CHO]n, where B is a organic residue of a poly(alkylaldehyde) with n aldehyde groups<br>
and n is an integer of 2 to about 8. A non-limiting example of a poly(alkylaldehyde) is<br>
glutaraldehyde having the structure OHC-(CH2)3-CHO, where B is -(CH2)3- and n is<br>
equal to 2.<br>
The term "and/or" means either or both. For example, "A and/or B" means A or B,<br>
or both A and B.<br>
The term "hydrocarbyl," as used herein, is a monovalent hydrocarbon group in<br>
which the valency is derived by extraction of a hydrogen from a carbon. Hydrocarbyl<br>
includes, for example, aliphatics (straight and branched chain), cycloaliphatics, aromatics<br>
and mixed character grups (e.g., aralkyl and alkaryl). Hydrocarbyl also includes groups<br><br>
with internal unsaturation and activated unsaturation. More specifically, hydrocarbyl<br>
includes, but is not limited to: alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, aralkyl, alkaryl, alkenyl, cycloalkenyl,<br>
and alkynyl, typically having from 1 to about 24 carbon atoms, preferably having from 1 to<br>
about 12 carbon atoms or 1 to about 4 carbon atoms. A hydrocarbyl may contain one or<br>
more carbonyl groups (which is/are included in the carbon count) and/or a heteroatom or<br>
heteroatoms (such as at least one oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, or silicon) in the chain or ring.<br>
In addition, a hydrocarbyl may have one or more of the hydrogens of the hydrocarbon<br>
group replaced by a functional group commonly found in organic molecules. The phrase<br>
"functional group commonly found in organic molecules" means non-hydrocarbyl groups<br>
that are typically found in organic molecules including, but not limited to, halides, cyano<br>
groups, amino groups, thiol groups, carboxylate groups, hydroxyl groups, sulfonate<br>
groups, nitroso groups, nitro groups, and the like.<br>

atoms and Rc is an alkyl, halogenated aryl, aralkyl, halogenated aralkyl, alkoxyalkyl or an<br>
alkaryl having from 1 to about 24 carbon atoms; and wherein the alkyl or aryl groups in<br>
each radical may optionally have heteroatoms in their structure. The amount of organic<br>
acid that may be used to stabilize the crosslinking composition ranges from a low of about<br>
1:50, or about 1:20 or about 1:10 or about 1:5 or about 1:2.5 moles of organic acid to<br>

Another embodiment of this invention is a process for producing a stabilizing<br>
crosslinking composition comprising reacting an amino compound containing amino<br>
groups; a mono(alkylaldehyde); and an alcohol; and stabilizing the composition by adding<br>

and propionic acid.<br>
Non-limiting examples of mono(alkylaldehyde) that may be used in this invention<br>
are acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, n-butyraldehyde, isobutyraldehyde, valeraldehyde,<br>
chloral, caproaldehyde, octylaldehyde, acrolein and crotonaldehyde.<br><br>
Examples of poly(alkylaldehyde) which made be used in this invention include, but<br>
are not limited to glutaraldehyde; the reaction product of crotonaldehyde and polyhydritic<br>
alcohols, such as glycerol, pentaerythritol, trimethylolpropane, sorbitol, 1,4-butanediol,<br>

ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, isobutanol, cyclohexanol, phenol, benzyl alcohol,<br>
monoalkyl ether of ethylene or propylene glycol and mixtures thereof.<br>
In the above reactions, the molar ratio of amino groups in all amino compounds to<br>
mono(alkylaldehyde) is about 1:0.1 to about 1:30, or about 1:0.25 to about 1:10 or about<br>
1:0.5 to about 1:5. In this application "amino groups" include groups with primary and/or<br>
secondary amines, i.e., -NH2 and -NHR groups, respectively.<br>
In addition, the molar ratio of amino groups in the amino compounds to aldehyde<br>
groups in the poly(alkylaldehyde) is about 0.1:1 to about 50:1, or about 0.5:1 to about 25:1<br>
or about 1:1 to about 10:1.<br>
The molar ratio of aldehyde groups in the mono(alkylaldehyde) and<br>
poly(alkylaldehyde) to alcohol is about 1:0.2 to about 1:50, or about 1.0.5 to about 1:5 or<br>
about 1:1 to about 1:3.<br>
The amount of organic acid that may be used to stabilize the crosslinking<br>
composition ranges from a low of about 1:50, or about 1:20 or about 1:10 or about 1:5 or<br>
about 1:2.5 moles of organic acid to moles of amino compound to a high of about 1:2, or<br>
about 1:1, or about 1.5:1 or about 2:1 or about 4:1 or about 10:1 or about 20:1 or about<br>
50:1 moles of organic acid to moles of amino compound.<br>
It is believed that many of the amino-based crosslinking compositions derived from<br>
mono(alkylaldehydes) and/or poly(alkylaldehydes) are not very soluble and/or not stable<br>
in common solvents used in the coatings industry. Many of these amino-based<br>
compounds are not soluble or precipitate out over time leading to unstable compositions.<br>
The inventors of the present invention have discovered that the use of organic acids in<br>
these compositions better solubilizes the amino-based crosslinking compounds in the<br>
solvents leading to more stable compositions. Crosslinking solids concentration needed<br>
for coating applications is typically greater than about 20 wt.% based on the total weight of<br>
crosslinker and solvent.<br>
It should be noted that the above amounts are a general guide and the actual<br>
amount of the ingredients will depend on the type of reactants and conditions used to<br>
produce and stabilize the crosslinking composition.<br><br>
The reaction should be conducted to prevent gelation, which would have a<br>
deleterious effect on the crosslinking composition. For example, if the amino compounds<br>
contain a large number of amino groups, then a relative small amount of polyfunctional<br>
poly(alkylaldehydes) should be used in order to end-cap with amino groups to prevent an<br>
insoluble crosslinked gel from forming. Conversely, one can charge a large excess of<br>
poly(alkylaldehydes) to effectively end-cap with aldehydes in order to prevent gelation. In<br>
addition, higher reaction temperatures could also tend to lead to self-condensation and<br>
possibly gelation. One skilled in the art would be able to choose the proper reactant<br>
amounts and conditions to reduce or eliminate gel formation.<br>
The above process may be prepared in a one-step or multi-step process. In one<br>
embodiment of a multi-step process, the amino compounds are first reacted with the<br>
mono(alkylaldehyde) and/or poly(alkylaldehyde) compounds (alkylolation reaction), and<br>
then the etherification step would occur by the reaction with an alcohol. In another<br>
embodiment of a multistep reaction, the amino compounds are first reacted with a<br>
poly(alkylaldehyde) followed by an etherification step, then reacted with a<br>
mono(alkylaldehyde) followed by another etherification step.<br>
The alkylolation reaction is preferably conducted in the presence of a catalyst. An<br>
acid or base catalyst may be used.<br>
It should be noted that the above organic acids of this invention that are utilized to<br>
stabilize the crosslinking compositions may be added to the reaction as a catalyst for both<br>
the alkylolation and etherification steps. In general, the amount of the organic acids<br>
needed as catalyst will be less than the amount needed to stabilize the crosslinking<br>
composition.<br>
Non-limiting examples of base catalysts are inorganic basic salts such as the<br>
hydroxides, carbonates or bicarbonates of lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium and<br>
magnesium, or the organic bases and basic salts such as amines and guanidine,<br>
quaternary-ammonium or phosphonium hydroxide and (bi-)carbonate salts.<br>
The etherification reaction is preferably conducted in the presence of an acid<br>
catalyst. The same acid catalyst described above for the alkylolation reaction may also<br>
be used in the etherification reaction.<br>
The reaction is carried out at a temperature from about 0°C to about 125°C, or<br>
about 25°C to about 100°C or about 50°C to about 75°C for a time of about 0.5 hours to<br>
about 48 hours, or about 1 hour to about 24 hours or about 1 hour to about 12 hours.<br>

such as a liquid medium to aid the uniform application and transport of the curable<br>
composition. Any or all of the ingredients of the curable composition may be contacted<br>
with the liquid medium. Moreover, the liquid medium may permit formation of a<br>
dispersion, emulsion, invert emulsion, or solution of the ingredients of the curable<br>
composition. Particularly preferred is a liquid medium, which is a solvent for the curable<br>
composition ingredients. Suitable solvents include aromatic hydrocarbons, aliphatic<br>
hydrocarbons, halogenated hydrocarbons, ketones, esters, ethers, amides, alcohols,<br>

crosslinking composition is in the range of from about 99:1 to about 0.5:1 or about 10:1 to<br>
about 0.8:1 or about 4:1 to about 0.8:1.<br>
The weight percent of the cure catalyst, if present, is in the range of from about<br>
0.01 to about 3.0 wt % based on the weight of the crosslinker and active hydrogen-<br>
containing material components.<br>
The present coating compositions may employ a liquid medium such as a solvent,<br>
or it may employ solid ingredients as in powder coatings, which typically contain no<br>
liquids. Contacting may be carried out by dipping, spraying, padding, brushing,<br>
rollercoating, flowcoating, curtaincoating, electrocoating or electrostatic spraying.<br><br>
The liquid or powder coating compositions and a substrate to be coated are<br>
contacted by applying the curable composition onto the substrate by a suitable method,<br>
for example, by spraying in the case of the liquid compositions and by electrostatic<br>
spraying in the case of the powder compositions. In the case of powder coatings, the<br>
substrate covered with the powder composition is heated to at least the fusion<br>
temperature of the curable composition forcing it to melt and flow out and form a uniform<br>
coating on the substrate. It is thereafter fully cured by further application of heat, typically<br>
at a temperature in the range of about 120°C to about 220°C for a period of time in the in<br>
the range of about 5 minutes to about 30 minutes and preferably for a period of time in the<br>
range of 10 to 20 minutes.<br>
In the case of the liquid compositions, the solvent is allowed to partially evaporate<br>
to produce a uniform coating on the substrate. Thereafter, the coated substrate is allowed<br>
to cure at temperatures of about 20°C to about 150°C, or about 25°C to about 120°C for<br>
a period of time in the in the range of about 20 seconds to about 30 days depending on<br>
temperature to obtain a cured film. In a particularly advantageous embodiment, coating<br>
compositions formulated with crosslinker containing compositions of the present invention<br>
can be heat cured at lower temperatures preferably ranging from about 20°C to about<br>
90°C.<br>
The heat cured compositions of this invention may be employed in the general<br>
areas of coatings such as original equipment manufacturing (OEM) including automotive<br>
coatings, general industrial coatings including industrial maintenance coatings,<br>
architectural coatings, powder coatings, coil coatings, can coatings, wood coatings, and<br>
low temperature cure automotive refinish coatings. They are usable as coatings for wire,<br>
appliances, automotive parts, furniture, pipes, machinery, and the like. Suitable surfaces<br>
include metals such as steel and aluminum, plastics, wood and glass.<br>
The curable compositions of the present invention are particularly well suited to<br>
coat heat sensitive substrates such as plastics and wood which may be altered or<br>
destroyed entirely at the elevated cure temperatures prevalent in the heat curable<br>
compositions of the prior art.<br>
The present invention will now be illustrated by the following examples. The<br>
examples are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention. In conjunction with<br>
the general and detailed descriptions above, the examples provide further understanding<br>
of the present invention.<br><br>
Example 1. Preparation of Tris(propylol)melamine Methyl Ether (TPMM)<br>
In a suitable flask was mixed 3026 grams of melamine (2.4 mole) with 1394 grams<br>
of propionaldehyde (24 moles), 1991 grams of methanol and 15.6 grams of acetic acid.<br>
The mixture was heated to 65°C, and kept for 2 hours. The solution cooled to precipitate<br>
solids, which were then separated by filtration. The solids had a melting point of about<br>
152-154°C.<br>
Examples 2 and 2C. Solubility of Tris(propylol)melamine Methyl Ether in Ethyl<br>
Acetate<br>
The resin of Example 1 was placed in the following liquids<br><br>
Both compositions were heated to 80°C. The resin in Example 2 dissolved and<br>
the composition became homogenous (clear) and remained homogenous upon cooling.<br>
The resin in Example 2C did not dissolve upon heating and the composition did not<br>
become homogenous (not clear - hazy).<br>
Example 3. Solvent Resistance of Coatings Containing the Crosslinking Resins of<br>
Examples 2.<br>
A coating compositions containing the crosslinking composition of Examples 2 was<br>
prepared by mixing 36 parts crosslinking resin with 64 parts acrylic backbone resin<br>
(Joncryl® 500) on a dry weight basis and 1.0 parts dimethyl acid pyrophosphate catalyst<br>
in butanol. The formulation was applied on iron phosphate treated cold roll steel panels<br>
and baked at 105°C for 20 minutes. Solvent resistance of the baked film was measured<br>
using a methylethyl ketone (MEK) rub. The result is shown in Table 2 below.<br><br><br>
Solvent Resistance is measured by methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) double rubs to remove the<br>
coating.<br>
Example 3 demonstrates that a film with good solvent resistance may be formed<br>
by using an organic acid additive.<br>
Examples 4 to 8 and 4C to 8C. Solubility of Tris(propyIoI)melamine Methyl Ether in<br>
Other Common Coating Solvents<br>
The TPMM resin of Example 1 was contacted with additional solvents to determine<br>
their solubility in common solvents used in the coating industry. The compositions and<br>
the results of the solubility tests are disclosed in Table 3 below.<br><br>
The results show that without the glacial acetic acid, none of the solvents<br>
solubilized the TPMM resin. The use of glacial acetic acid allows the TPMM resin to be<br>
used as a crosslinker for coating applications.<br>
