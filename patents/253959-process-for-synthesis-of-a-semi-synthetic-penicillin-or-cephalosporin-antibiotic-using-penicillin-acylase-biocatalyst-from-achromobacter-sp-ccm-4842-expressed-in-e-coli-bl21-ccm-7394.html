3.	PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION:	'<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
Process for the preparation of immobilized recombinant Penicillin Acylase catalyst from Achromobacter sp. CCM 4824 expressed in E. coli BL21 CCM 7394 and its nse for the synthesis of beta-lactam antibiotics.<br>
Technical Field:<br>
The present invention relates to isolation of Penicillin Acylase (PA) from Achromobacter sp CCM 4824 expressed in recombinant strain E. coli BL21 CCM 7394 bearing the recombinant plasmid pKXIPl and processing of PA into biocatalyst useful for the industrial synthesis of antibiotics. More particularly the invention relates to the synthesis of semi-synthetic p-lactam antibiotics from the reaction mixture consisting of activated acyl donor (D-p-hydroxyphenylglycine methyl ester or amide for Amoxicillin and Cefadroxil; D-phenylglycine methyl ester or amide for Ampicillin and Cephalexin) and nucleophile (6-APA or 7-ADCA) catalyzed by PA derived from recombinant E.coli BL21 CCM 7394 as the biocatalyst<br>
Background of the invention:<br>
For several decades, Penicillin G acylase (E.C.3.5.1.11) has been commercially exploited to hydrolyse the acyl group of Penicillin G ancl its six member variant Deacetoxycephalosporin G, so as to yield 6-Aminopenicillanic acid ( 6-APA) and 7- Aminodeacetoxycephalosporanic acid ( 7-ADCA) respectively, the key building block for P-lactam antibiotics.<br>
Synthetic properties of Penicillin acylase from Escherichia coli ATCC 11105 are only moderate, which causes incomplete conversion of the subtrates to products. Similar Penicillin acylases are reported from Kluyvera cryocrescens and Providencia rettgeri but the synthetic potential of these enzymes are not well documented. In the recent years, a number of mutants with altered kinetic properties, especially with improved S/H ratios {the ratio of synthesis of antibiotic to hydrolysis of activated acyl donor abbreviated in literature as S/H) have been constructed by site directed mutagenesis. However, these variants of E.coli PA did not give the desired results. Organisms that have been found to produce penicillin acylases, for example Acetobacter, Aeromonas, Alcaligenes, Aphcmocladium, Alcaligenes faecalis, Xartthomonas sp., Providencia rettgeri, Xanthomonas citrii, Bacillus megaterium, E. coli, of which E. coli PA is most commonly used. <br>
As in most cases of E.coli based expression systems, the preproprotein is transported into periplasmic space where it undergoes post-translational modification to become a fully functional enzyme. This gives the possibility of using selective methods of cell breaking so that without too much of energy consumption, the respective enzyme can be released from the cells with relatively high specific purity. Breaking of cells can be done by classical mechanical methods like high pressure homogenization or disintegration in Beadmill, of which more often homogenization is followed at industrial level Alternatively, organic solvents could be used to break the cells and to extract the product,<br>
There are reports of using a combination of solvents to enhance cell lysis yield and purit of enzyme. De Leon et al in (2003), reported the use of various organic solvent to extrac Penicillin G acylase from recombinant E. coli. (A. De Leon, B. Garcia, A. P. Barba de I Rosa, F Villasefior, A.Estada, R.Lopez- Revilla, Process Biochemistrys39:301-305,2003 However, chemical lysis methodologies have to be custom developed depending on th microorganism and the enzyme sensitivity to the organic solvents.<br>
Penicillin acylase can be used in thermodynamically controlled synthesis as well a kinetically controlled synthesis of β-lactam antibiotics.Penicillin acylase is used in th kinetically controlled synthesis of β-lactam antibiotics by direct condensation of th activated acyl donors with the respective β-lactam nucleus. These enzymatic processes although seemingly competitive with traditional chemical synthesis, actually confront major difficulty which determines the overall yield of ah antibiotic, namely hydrolysis of the activated acyl donor as well as the antibiotic formed. (MA.Wegman, U. Heinemani A.Stloz, F.Van Rantwijk and R.A.Sheldon, Organic Process Res Dev. 4:318-322,2000,) The enzymatic synthesis of (3-lactam antibiotics may work directly from the acyl donoi or from an ester or from amide derivative. (Kashe V. Enzyme Microbial Technology, IS 4-16,1986).<br>
In the first case of thermodynamically controlled synthesis, the main issue is to shift th reaction equilibrium towards the products. Though presently this may not be successful this would be an ideal and an elegant solution.<br>
In the second case of kinetically controlled synthesis, an activated precursor of the acyl donor, either in ester form or in amide form of the D-acyl side chain of the antibiotic reacts with the p-lactam nucleus,1 releasing the antibiotic in addition to alcohol or ammonium plus, unreacted reactants and by products. Usually in kinetically controlled approach, the acyl donor is to be taken in molar excess in order to drive the reaction towards the synthesis, which makes the process unattractive. (Luciana R. B. Goncalves, Ruy Sousa, Jr. Roberto, Fernandcz-Lafiiente, Jose M.Guisan, Raquel L. C. Giordano, Roberto C. Giordano, Biotechnology and Bioengineering 8:6,622-631, 2002).<br>
The major issues of this kinetically controlled enzymatic approach have been the yield, scalability and process economics due to excessive use of acyl donor. Many studies were aimed to improve this, which includes process optimization, addition of co-solvents or the use of high concentration of the substrates or improving the biocatalyst activity by immobilization.<br>
Enzyme immobilization plays a very crucial role in stability and selectivity of the enzyme which in turn decides the future of the enzymatic process. Enzyme processes by and large compete with the well established chemical process and eventually get rejected if the process economics is not attractive. By and large, industrial enzyme immobilization has been quite successful since several years of which Penicillin G acylase is one of the successful enzymes used in pharmaceutical industry.<br>
Usually for covalent type of immobilization, the target enzyme needs to be purified sufficiently which in turn increases the cost of production with increase in time. Also, specific traits of carrier material need to be studied to predict the suitability to particular protein as these carriers tend to alter the secondary, tertiary or quaternaiy structures of protein which subsequently hinder in their specific use.<br>
This has also led to exploration of other possibilities of non-covalent immobilization. Entrapment and encapsulation have been most preferred methods of non-covalent immobilization. <br>
Entrapment is particularly advantageous as it requires proteins in less purified form, even whole cells have been suitably entrapped in various carriers. The proteins in enzyme extract can be aggregated by addition of salts, organic or non-ionic polymers which induces protein to form super molecular forms and render them insoluble in aqueous solutions and the same can be cross linked with suitable agents to give cross linked enzyme aggregates. ( A.M.van der Weilen, M.Ottens and A.J.J, Straathof et al, Straathof, A. J. J.Panke, S. and Schmid, A. Current Opin Biotechnol, 13:548-556 ,2002 and Cao, L, Van Langen, L. M. Van Rantwijk F et al, Enzyme Microbial Technology, 11: 665-670, 2001.Based on the above revelation and economic point of view, we have chosen entrapment as method of immobilization for recombinant PA from Achromobacter sp. CCM 4824.<br>
The entrapment methods according to the invention for immobilization have either used whole cells or purified proteins which compromise on either the yield of expressed activity or the cost of enzyme purification. The enzyme used in the invention is partially- purified by precipitating the protein in saturated solution made by slow addition of precipitant like solid ammonium sulphate. (Protein Purification and Process Engineering Edited by Roger G Harrison, Marcel Dekker Inc. Publication,141-l 83,1993)<br>
The object of enzyme immobilization includes high catalyst activity, high mechanical and operational stability, recyclability, high S/H ratios in case the enzyme is used in synthetic reactions and cost of manufacture.<br>
Apart from above approaches, a more fundamental approach to enhance product yields is the use of new biocatalysts with improved kinetic properties, since it has been convincingly shown that kinetically controlled reactions are highly influenced by the kinetic parameters of the enzyme.<br>
Consequently, current trends in research lead to the development of large number of new biocatalysts/ new variants of enzymes useful in chemical/ pharmaceutical industries. These new enzymes (bio catalysts) can be obtained by classical isolation of production microorganisms from nature, recombinant DNA technique from environmental gene pool or by an approach of directed evolution of enzymes resulting in a new family of penicillin acylases with improved synthetic potential.<br>
Thus the availability of a penicillin acylase with outstanding synthetic potential is a crucial factor for the development of enzymatic processes for p-lactam synthesis. One of the main kinetic parameters IS the ratio of synthesis of antibiotic to hydrolysis of activated acyl donor (abbreviated in literature as S/H). This ratio is die key performance parameter of biocatalyst.<br>
Studies by Sheldon et al (Sheldon,Van Rantwijk, Van Langen, Wegman, CAO and Janssen Synthesis of B-lactam antibiotics, Edited by Alle Bruggink, Kluwer Academic publication :126-129,2003) revealed that there is a great variation in hydrolytic activities as well as synthetic activities between different preparations of PA from E. coli.<br>
Enzyme	Carrier	Hydrolytic activity (U/g)<br>
Poly-XDA-GA-PA	Poly-XDA-GA	200<br>
Assemblase 7500	Gelatin-chitosan	260<br>
PGA 450	Special polymer	210<br>
PcA	EupergitC	310<br><br>
Of the above examples,. Poly XDA-GA-PA (microbeads from l,4-di(amino methyl) benzene (p-xylylene diamine, by glutaraldehyde activation) proved to be eui efficient catalyst for 0- lactam synthesis. In case of Ampicillin synthesis, the S/H ratio with this enzyme preparation was 2,0 at 85% conversion, which was comparable with free enzyme and better than Assemblase ( S/H 1.22 at 80% conversion). In case of Amoxicillin synthesis, the same enzyme performed well with S/H ratio of 4.5 upto 75 % conversion which is slightly higher than that with free Penicillin acylase.<br>
Penicillin acylase (PA; E.C. 3.5,1.11, penicillin amidohydrolase) from Achromobacter sp. CCM 4824 (originally Comamonas testosteroni CCM 4824; PMfikovd et al. (K. Plh&amp;iSkovd et al. Applied Microbial Technology, 32:507-516,2001), Skrob et al., Enzyme Microbial Technology 32: 738-744, 2003) exhibits better traits as regards the enzymatic <br>
syntheses of Ampicillin, Amoxicillin, Cephalexin and Cefadroxil when compared to PA from outer sources.<br>
Kyslik et al. (Czech patent application PV 2007-82) on further work cloned and expressed the above Penicillin acylase from Achromobacter CCM4824 in recombinant strain &amp; coli BL21(pKXlPl) CCM7394 on a plasmid vector.

The present invention involves the application of Penicillin acylase as derived above in industrial synthesis of {3- lactam antibiotics.<br>
Thus the present invention predominantly involves in extraction of penicillin acylase from E. coli BL21(pKXlPl) and subsequent synthesis of fWactam antibiotics by using Penicillin acylase, a new biocatalyst, to obtain final product with improved yields.<br>

Detail description of the invention:<br>
The present invention is related to field of enzymatic approach for the preparation of commercially important semi-synthetic 0-lactams. These antibiotics are among the most used pharmaceuticals, of which semi-synthetic penicillins and cephalosporins (e.g Ampicillin, Amoxicillin, Cephalexin, Cefazolin, Cefadroxil) and several others contribute more than 60% of global sales.<br>
The present invention provides isolation of recombinant Penicillin Acylase from Achromobacter sp, CCM 4824 expressed in genetically modified E. coli BL21 CCM 7394 cells and this invention predominantly includes, cell lysis, enzyme isolation, preparation of biocatalyst by enzyme stabilization and designing parameters for efficient synthesis of Amoxicillin, Ampicillin and Cephalexin using immobilized recombinant Penicillin<br>
Acylase as biocatalyst isolated from E. coli CCM 7394. The method of cultivation of the recombinant strain CCM 7394 is described in Czech patent PV-2007-82.<br>
According to the invention p-lactam antibiotics are synthesized from the reaction mixture consisting of activated acyl-donor (D-p-hydroxyphenylglycine methyl ester or amide for Amoxicillin and Cephadroxil; D-phenylglycine methyl ester or amide for Ampicillin and Cephalexin) with nucleophile (6-APA or 7-ADCA) catalyzed by recombinant penicillin Acylase derived from Achromobacter sp. CCM 4824<br>
In one embodiment, the invention provides method of cell lysis of E.coli BL21 CCM 7394 cells containing Penicillin Acylase from Achromobacter sp.CCM 4824,using various methods such as high pressure homogenize^ mild chemical extraction using various solvents such as ethyl acetate, tolune; butyl acetate and chloroform. The degree of lysis using different solvents is measured by drawing the samples periodically from the reaction medium. Hie degree of lysis caused due to the solvent is measured by assaying AHpenG in supernatant samples and comparing with initial activity of cell suspension (%cell lysis). The method of cultivation of the recombinant strain CCM 7394 is described in Czech patent PV-2007-82.<br>
The experimental results have proved that chloroform is the most suitable solvent with a yield of 60% and hence further experiments were done to optimize the enzyme yield with high SAHpeng. The results are shown in Table 1<br>
By following the above procedure, various concentrations of chloroform were added to initiate the chemical lysis and subsequent extraction of the enzyme is carried out. At 2% v/v chloroform concentration, the cell lysis observed is 80% when compared with other concentrations. The results were given in Table2<br>
Further, to improve the degree of cell lysis, different supplements such as chemical detergents and metal chelators selected from EDTA ( Ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid) , cetrimide, urea and sodium lauryl sulphate are added to the chloroform and observed that the use of sodium laurylsulphate as a supplement enhances the degree of lysis. The results <br>
are shown in Table 3. This reaction can be conveniently carried out at a temperature range of 15to35°C.<br>
Further, the lysed biomass is stored for 12 hrs at 5°C to allow the separation of protein from the ruptured cells. The temperature of the suspension was raised to 28 to 30°C and diluted with distilled water; and the pH is adjusted to 5,0 using 2M acetic acid. The coagulation of acid protein from the suspension is done by adding polyethylene imine at 40°C for 1 hr. The flocculated material is separated from the solution by centrifugation. The pH of the clear supernatant liquid is adjusted to 7.5 with 4N sodium hydroxide and the obtained solution is designated as soluble enzyme (SE).<br>
Part of the above SE solution is stirred at 5°C and pH is adjusted to 7.5. To this, solid ammonium sulphate, 390 grams per liter, equivalent to saturation of 60% (w/v) was slowly added, over a period of 20minutes.0n further stirring at same temperature for 60minutes. The saturated solution is refrigerated for 12 hrs and the precipitated enzyme is isolated at 5°C. The precipitate contained AHpenG of 700 units per gram and specific activity of 2 units per mg protein.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the invention describes preparation of enzyme paste by addition of 283.6 grams per liter of solid ammonium sulphate to the pre cooled SE (0- 1°C) in the course of 30minutes. Precipitation proceeded for 2hrs followed by centrifugation to obtain the enzyme paste. The yield of enzyme was 74%.The enzyme pastes obtained in (he above were used in immobilization into polyacrylamide gel or further for purification of PA as described below-<br>
In another embodiment, the invention provides a purification step of penicillin acylase using ion-exchange chromatography method. Chromatography on CATEX with functional carboxy groups, a weak cation-exchanger, was applied to prepare purified PA from enzyme paste suitable for immobilization on macroporous polyacrylate resins such as Sepabeads and DILBEADS ™. The PA is selectively bound to the ion-exchanger and the bulk protein with lower isoelectric point went through the column. Bound PA was recovered from the column with a gradient of Potassium Chloride. The solution of purified enzyme contains two isoforms of identical SAHPB1G present in weight ratio 1: 2.7. Total yield of activity after this purification is equal to 45%.<br>
The immobilization process of Penicillin acylase was also suitably designed to enhance the synthetic ability of the immobilized enzyme and retention of increased activity for longer period to ensure better stability of the biocatalyst. The immobilization process involves a method of enzyme entrapment. Polyacrylamide based polymers are most commonly used for enzyme entrapment, because their degree of similarity to those of free enzymes The immobilization yields achieved are nearly 90% in terms of protein binding and almost 60-70% in terms of expressed activity. The limitation in use of poly acrylamide is the leakage of the enzyme from the matrix due to non-reactive nature of the polymer, physical stability and also diffusion problem encountered to a large substrate molecule. Both these limitations have been overcome by use of optimized degree of cross linking. Of all the other cross linking agents, Glutaraldehyde, a bi-functional cross linker is agent of choice for Polyacrylamide based gel entrapment. (Protein Immobilisation- Fundamentals and Application,. Edited by Richard Taylor, Marcel Defcker Inc Publication, 40:1991)<br>
The main criteria of this optimization are to retain the synthetic enzyme activity though certain degree of inactivation is unavoidable and also to impart mechanical strength to the polymerized gel to limit leakage of enzyme from polymer. The gel entrapped enzyme is further recrosslinked to ensure better stability of the biocatalyst as a final product.<br>
The method is more suitably adapted to have considerable amount of npnspecific proteins in precipitation to aid better cross linking with glutaraldehyde. This also helps to accelerate the polymerization process as well. The use of enzyme with low specific activity makes the process economical and with higher yield in terms of product and activity.<br>
100 grams of enzyme paste obtained as above is diluted with sodium phosphate buffer to obtain a homogenized solution. 14.5 ml from the stock solution containing Acrylamide monomer solution (10% w/v) and N',N'-methylenebisacrylamide (0.5%w/v) were added to above stirred enzyme solution at 5'C and further continued stirring for 5minutes. To this reaction mass, 5ml of 25% (w/V) solution of glutaraldehyde was added and allowed to stir for exactly 8minutes. Then 0.5% (v/v) solution of TEMED and 1.0 % (w/v) freshly <br>
prepared solution of ammonium persulfate were added to the solution. Polymerization is initiated within 2minutes.<br>
The amount of ammonium persulphate and TEMED used for the purpose of complete polymerization is studied and the results were described in Table 6. It has been confirmed that the ratio 1: 0.6 of ammonium persulphate and TEMED is the best one to achieve the complete polymerization.<br>
A thick, opaque polymerizing mass obtained which was poured into pre-chilled trays and allowed to fully polymerize and incubated for 30minutes The formed gel aggregate was cut and sieved through #30 mesh (500 micron) sieve. The resulting gel aggregate is washed through # 50 mesh (300 micron) with water to remove finer particles, traces of un-reacted monomer and other reagents.<br>
Further washing of the entrapped enzyme is done with 1.2 M Sodium Chloride to remove traces of unbound protein.<br>
To enhance crosslinking, the aggregate is stirred in 0.5% (v/v) solution of Glutaraldehyde at 25 °C for 30minutes. After re-crosslinking, traces of Glutaraldehye are removed by washing with 5 volumes of water.<br>
Finally die catalyst is vacuum filtered to remove excess water and stored in 50mM Sodium Phosphate buffer, pH 7,8 containing 500 ppm, Ethylparaben. The % dry weight of the final product ranges between 12-15%, with particle size distribution of 98% particles between 100-300 microns.<br>
The yield in terms of weight ranged from 88 to 92 %. The yield of expressed activity ( AHPenG = 110 U/g ww; AHPen0= 750 U/g dw) is equivalent to 47% with respect to the activity taken for immobilization.<br>
The activity is determined by alkalimetrie titration using 25mM Penicillin G, 50mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 8.0, at 37°C. The amoxicillin synthetic activity (ASamox =150U/g dw) is determined at reaction conditions using 40mmoles of 6-APA and 60 mmoles of HPGMeHCl, at pH 6.3 and 40°C. The reaction is carried out for 30minutes, followed by HPLC analysis for activity determination.<br>
The above process is, repeated by using variable concentrations of Acrylamide and N',N'- methylene bisacrylamide to ascertain the best workable ratio of the same for enzyme entrapment. The best workable concentration ratio of Acrylamide to N',N'-methylene bisacrylamide is found to be 19:1 with a resultant yield 92% of enzyme activity. The experimental results to this extent are shown in Table 5.<br>
The above experiment is further continued with variable concentrations of glutaraldehyde chosen from 1 to 5 mille mole per milligram of protein used for cross-linking. The results obtained are indicated that the increase in concentration of glutaraldehyde increases the strength of the biocatalyst formed but yield of activity is inversely related to concentration of glutaraldehyde. The results are shown in Table 6.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the invention describes the evaluation of hydrolytic activity and polyacrylamide gel aggregate (FERMASENA™ 150) and (FERMASE NA™ 1500) at and at 37'aC and observed that the activity of the catalyst is found nearly two fold at higher temperature.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the invention is directed to the synthesis of Amoxicillin trihydrate from 6-APA (nucleophile) and HPGMeHCl(acyl donor) using FERMASE NA ™ 150 and FERMASE NA™ 1500.<br>
In the process of.the invention, acyl-donor is used in molar excess to shift the threshold of the reaction towards the product, an antibiotic. Both reactants (acyl donor, nucleophile) may be added into the batch-type reaction at once in the beginning of the reaction which results in formation of thick suspension due to low solubility of acyl donor, or acyl donor may be added into the reaction in a step-wise mode to prevent formation of the suspension. In the later case, the reaction solution is clear until the less-soluble product (antibiotic) is formed, the initial rate of the hydrolysis of the acyl donor is lower and the process can be operated in continuous mode. Both ways of addition of acyl donor may be combined. . <br>
There is tendency of pH to decrease in the course of reaction so that it is necessary to adjust the pH of reaction mass. The specific final pH of 6.3 is necessary to achieve the maximum conversion of 6-APA into Amoxicillin trihydrate. The pH is adjusted using phosphoric acid or sodium hydroxide or ammonia.<br>
Similar experiments were carried out for the synthesis of Amoxicillin from 6-APA (nucleophile) and HPGMeHCl (acyl donor) using FERMASE PA ™ 1500 at controlled pH conditions.<br>
The reaction is terminated based on the % conversion of 6-APA with concomitant increase in Amoxicillin. The enzyme is removed from the reaction mass and washed with water thoroughly for further use.<br>
In similar manner, the other p-lactam antibiotics are synthesised using recombinant PA as biocatalyst obtained from Achromobacter sp. CCM 4824. The condensation of 6- APA(nucleophiIe) and PGMeHCl(as acyl donor) for the synthesis of Ampicillin; 7- ADCA (nucleophile) and HPGMeHClester or amide (acyl donor) for the synthesis of cefadroxil; 7-ADCA (nucleophile) and PGMeHCI ester or amide (acyl donor) for the synthesis of Cephalexin.<br>

Examples: Example 1<br>
Cell lysis by high pressure homogeniser<br>
Exoli BL 21 CCM 7394 cells with the activity of PA from Achromobacter sp.CCM 4824 were harvested from die culture broth by centrifugation in a form of cell paste (Sharpies <br>
centrifuge) or in a form of cell suspension (Alfa-Laval continuous separator). The harvested biomass was suspended in 0.02M sodium phosphate to get about 5 % (cdw/v) suspension pH of which was adjusted to 7.0 and maintained at this value with 20%w/v sodium hydroxide. Cell suspension (2350 ml, 4.9% cdw/v, AHPenG of 86.5 U/ml) cooled to 8-13°C was subjected to disintegration (homogenizer Manton-Gauliq, pressure of 40-50 MPa, three consecutive cycles). After each cycle, Ihe homogenate was cooled down to 8-13°C and pH was adjusted to 7.0. The cell debris and a fraction of ballast proteins were removed by thermocoagulation step consisting in: pH adjustment to 5.0 with 50% acetic acid, addition of the flocculant Sedipur CL 930 (2-4g/L) and maintaining the temperature at 40°C for 1 hour. After fast cooling of the homogenate to 8-13°C, the homogenate was diluted with 700 ml H20, pH was adjusted to 8.0 (20% sodium hydroxide solution) and the mixture was centrifuged (Beckman centrifuge, .angle rotor,4 X.350 ml, 10,000 rpm) for 20 min. pH of die clear enzyme solution (2580 ml, 8.7 mg protein/ml, AHPcnG of 64.8 U/ml) was adjusted to 7.0 and enzyme solution was frozen at -16 °C. The yield of the enzyme (S AHPenG = 8.4 U/mg protein) was 82 % (the activity of the cell suspension before disintegration equals 100%).<br>

Results indicated that Chloroform gave the best results with yield of 60% and hence further experiments were done to optimize the enzyme yield with high SA'VenO-<br>
B. Enzyme extraction by mild chemical extraction with chloroform<br>
By following the same procedure described above, various concentrations of Chloroform were added to initiate the chemical lysis and subsequent extraction of enzyme.<br>

It was evident that Chloroform used at concentration of 2% (v/v) was effective to achieve maximum degree of lysis as shown in the above Table 2. In the case of higher concentrations of chloroform the lower yield is due to denaturation of the enzyme by solvents.<br>
C. Enzyme extraction by mixture of chloroform and different supplements<br>
By following the same procedure described above, various concentrations of chemical detergents and metal chelators were added along with Chloroform to enhance the chemical lysis and enzyme yield. Substances like EDTA ( Ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid), Cetrimide and Urea are known to help in cell lysis, either individually or in <br>
combination. The addition of Sodium lauryl sulphate enhances the degree of lysis. Tht results were shown below in Table 3. Table 3<br>

Example 3<br>
Preparation of enzyme concentrate<br>
350gm of cell paste prepared as in Example 1 was suspended in distilled water to final concentration of 5% (cdw/v) at 20 - 25°C. The pH of the cell suspension was adjusted to 7.0 and ice cold 2% (v/v) Chloroform and 0.2% (w/v) Sodium lauryl sulfate was added to initiate lysis. Samples were withdrawn periodically during the total period of 5 hrs. The lysed biomass was further stored at 5°C for 12hrs before further processing to allow separation of protein from the ruptured cells. The temperature of the suspension was raised to 28- 30°C and diluted two fold with distilled water. The pH was adjusted to 5.0 with 2M acetic acid. Coagulation of acid protein from the suspension was done by adding 1% (w/v) of Polyethylene imine at 40°C for one hour. The flocculated material was separated from the solution by centrifugation at 7000rpm, The pH of clear supernatant was adjusted to 7.5 with 4N sodium hydroxide solution and obtained solution was designated as soluble enzyme (SE). The en2yme yield with respect to initial activity of cell paste was 90%. Table 4 shows the yield of PA activity in the course of preparation. This soluble enzyme (SE) was used further for preparation of catalyst<br>

Purification of enzyme paste by amtnoniam sulphate treatment Method A<br>
Enzyme solution prepared as in Example 1 (2580 ml, 8.7 mg protein/ml, AHPeno of 64,8 U/ml, pH 7.0) was further purified by precipitation with ammonium sulfate. Solid ammonium sulfate (283.6 g/L) was added to the pre-cold enzyme solution (0-l°C) in the course of 30 minutes under cooling. Precipitation proceeded for 2 hrs and the precipitate was removed by centrifiigation. The enzyme paste was used for immobilization into polyacrylamide gel or for further purification of PA. The yield of the enzyme was 74 % (the activity of the cell suspension before disintegration equals 100%).<br>
Method B<br>
Part of SE prepared in Example 3 was stirred at 5°C and pH was adjusted to 7.5. Solid Ammonium sulphate, 390 grams per liter, equivalent to a saturation of 60% (w/v), was slowly added over a period of 20mins.<br>
On further stirring 5°C for 60minutes; the saturated enzyme solution was refrigerated for 12hrs. Enzyme precipitate was separated by centrifiigation (Remi Centrifuge) at 7000 rpm at 5°C for 30 minutes. The precipitate contained AHpeno of 700 units per gram and specific activity of 2 units per mg protein.<br>
Method C<br>
Purification of PA by ion-exchange chromatography:<br>
Chromatography on CATEX with functional carboxy groups, a weak cation-exchanger, was applied to prepare purified PA from enzyme paste suitable for immobilization on macroporous polyacrylate resins such as Sepabeads and DILBEADS™. As an weak cation-exchanger, Fractogel COO" (Merck) equilibrated with 0.02M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) was used. The paste (prepared in Example 6) was dissolved in 0.1M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0,400 ml) and thoroughly dialyzed against 0.02M sodium <br>
phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) so that the conductivity of the sample and the buffer is the same. The solution was centrifuged and the pellet was discarded. AHPENG in supernatant equalled 259 U/ml and SAHPenO = 16.8 U/mg protein. The solution was applied onto the column, the PA was selectively bound to the ion-exchanger and the bulk protein with lower isoelectric point went through the column. Bound PA was recovered from the . column with gradient of potassium chloride (0.0 - 0,14 M potassium chloride in 0.02 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0). To isolate PA from the 0.4 1 of dialyzed solution, a glasscolumn with bedvolume of 1 1 was used. The solution of purified enzyme (volume of 1.25 1, AHPenG of 43.4 U/ml) contained two isoforms of identical SAHPenG (38.1 and 42.6 U/mg protein) present in weight ratio 1: 2.7. Total yield of activity after this step of purification equalled 45%.<br>
Example 5<br>
Preparation of Polyacrylamide gel aggregates:- FERMASE NA™ 150 Method A<br>
The enzyme paste obtained from Example 3A was diluted with 0.3M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) to get 75ml of solution of PA (AHPEILG of250 U/ml). The solution was kept in stirring at 5°C. 14.5ml of 10% (w/v) solution of Acrylamide monomer and 0.5% (w/v) solution of N',N'-methylenebisacrylamide was added to enzyme solution and stirred for 5 minutes. 5ml of 25% (v/v) Glutaraldehyde was added and allowed to stir for exactly 8 minutes. Then, 0.5% (v/v) solution of TEMED and 1.0 % (w/v) freshly prepared solution of Ammonium persulfate were added to the solution. Polymerization was initiated within 2 minutes.<br>
At this stage, a thick, opaque polymerizing mass was poured into pre-chilled trays and allowed to fully polymerize and incubated for 30 min. The formed gel aggregate is cut and sieved through #30 mesh (500 micron) sieve. The resulting gel aggregate is washed through #50 mesh (300 micron) with water to remove finer particles, traces of un-reacted monomer and other reagents. "<br>
Further washing of die entrapped enzyme was done with 1.2 M sodium chloride prepared in 5 times of the volume to remove traces of unbound protein.<br>
To enhance crosslinking, the aggregate was stirred in 0.5% (v/v) solution of Glutaraldehyde at 25 °C for 30 minutes. After re-crosslinking, traces of Glutaraldehyde were removed by washing with 5 volumes of water.<br>
Finally the catalyst was vacuum filtered to remove excess water and stored in 50mM Sodium Phosphate buffer pH 7.8, containing 500 ppm of Ethylparaben. The dry weight of the final preparation ranges between 12-15%, with particle size distribution of 9 8% particles between 100-300 microns.<br>
The mass yield ranged from 88 to 92 %. The yield of expressed activity (AHpenG = HO U/g ww; AHpeoo= 750 U/g dw) was equivalent to 47% with respect to the activity taken for immobilization.<br>
The activity was determined by alkalimetric titration using 25mM Penicillin G potassium, 50mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 8.0, at 37°C. The amoxicillin synthetic activity (As Amox — 150U/g dw) was determined at reaction conditions using 40 mmol of 6-APA and 60 mmol of HPGMe.HCl, at pH 6.3 and 40°C. The reaction was carried out for 30 minutes, followed by HPLC analysis for activity determination.<br>
Method B<br>
The procedure as described in Example 5 Method A was followed but variable concentration of acrylamide and N,N'-Methylenebisacrylamide were used (Table 5). Literature reports suggest the use of the two monomers in the ratio ranging from 2:1 to 20:1. The variation resulted in gel matrix of different pore size which would entrap protein molecules to different extent. Also the different ratio of acrylamide and N'N- methylenebisaciylamide affects the pore size and the catalytic activity of the resultant biocatalyst.<br>

Based on the above results, for better enzyme activity, concentration of acrylamide and N'N-methylenebisaciyiamide used for catalyst preparation was 8.35% (w/v) and 0.43% (w/v), respectively, which corresponds to the ratio of 19 :1 (Experiment No. 6).<br>
Method C.<br>
Modified preparation of polyacrylamide gel aggregates: Fermase NA™150 The procedure as described in Example 5, Method B was repeated with 8.35% (w/v) of acrylamide and 0.43 % (w/v) N\N'-Methylenebisacrylamide except that varying concentration of Glutaraldehyde was used for cross linking. The concentration chosen varied from 1 to 5 millimole per milligram of protein. Optimum concentration of Glutaraldehyde was chosed based on strength of biocatalyst. Strength of biocatalyst was determined by subjecting the biocatalyst to mechanical stress. For this, 10 % of biocatalyst suspension is prepared in water and subjected to shaking with glass beads (5 mm diameter) in an orbital shaker at 25 °C at 70 RPM for 12 hrs. After stress treatment, the biocatalyst was checked for the residual enzyme activity and gravitational settling time. The results are summarized as in Table 6. Table 6<br>

The biocatalyst with relatively less mechanical strength tend to break into finer panicle and due to the buoyancy of these finer particles, the settling time increases. Hence, settling time is taken as a measure of the mechanical stability. Though the Experiment No.4 has less activity compared to its counterparts, due its stability it was selected as the best combination for further experimentation.<br>
Method D<br>
It was suggested by literature to (Preparation of immobilized systems Edited by Ichiro Chibata,78-92,1978) use 0.75% - 1.0 % (w/v) Ammonium persulfate and 0.5% (v/v) TEMED for polymerization. The time required for complete polymerization was checked in each experiment. The results are discussed below in table 7.<br>

Evaluation of polyacrylamide gel aggregate ( FERMASE NA™ 150) The catalyst was prepared by entrapment of the recombinant PA of Achromobacter sp.CCM 4824 (rPAAs), expressed in E.coli BL21 CCM 7394. The gel entrapment into polyacrylamide was used as described in Example 5. <br>
Method A<br>
The hydrolytic activity of catalyst was determined using alkalimetric assay (15 mM Penicillin G potassium, 0.1M sodium phosphate, pH 8.0 at 25 °C). Ihe catalyst with the AMpenG of 27.5 U/g ww (13.5 % d.w., AHPenG of 204 U/g dw) was used in the synthetic experiments. In addition, the hydrolytic activity of the same catalyst was determined using alkalimetric assay at higher temperature (15 mM Penicillin G potassium, 0.1M sodium phosphate, pH 8.0 at 37 °C): the activity of catalyst was nearly two fold (AHPeno ~ 58 U/g ww, AHPBNG = 430 U/g dw). Method B<br>
The amoxicillin synthetic activity AsAmox of 192 U/g dw was determined at reaction conditions: 300 mmol 6-APA, 700 mmol HPGMe.HCl, pH 6.3,25 °C. The reactants in the course of amoxicillin synthesis were determined by HPLC method using column Luna 5µ.C18, 150 x 2 mm (Phenomenex) thermostated at 28°C, mobile phase was 0.05M sodium phosphate buffer pH 3.1, containing 7.5% methanol at flow rate 0,2 ml/min. The peaks were monitored at 215 nm.<br>
Preparation of sample: Sample of reaction mixture was diluted 200 times with mobile phase containing 0.05% Sodium lauryl sulfate, centrifuged (14 000 rpm, 10 min) and injected (volume of 10 µl). The retention times in HPLC analysis of HPG, 6-APA, HPGMe and AMOX were 2.3,3.2, 5.5 and 7.6 rain, respectively. The Unit of Amoxicillin synthesis is one micromole of Amoxicillin formed per 1 min under the conditions of the reaction.<br>
