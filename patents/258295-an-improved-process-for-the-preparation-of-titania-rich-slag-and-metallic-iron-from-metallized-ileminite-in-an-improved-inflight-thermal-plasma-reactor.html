				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for preparation of titania rich slag and metallic iron from metallized ilmenite. Titania rich slag contains about 75-85% Ti02 which is one of the major feedstock for the production of TiO2 pigment. TiOa is an excellent material for its white luster, which is used in paints, papers, plastics, rubber, ceramics and printing ink and in the manufacture of corrosion resistant as well as heat resistant materials.<br>
Background and prior art of the invention<br>
The invention relates to a modified process for the production of Titania rich slag and metallic iron from metallized ilmenite in a static bed thermal plasma reactor using in-flight process. To reduce the energy consumption a process has been developed to melt separates the metallized ilmenite in an in-flight extended transferred arc thermal plasma reactor. The mentioned process can widely be used in ilmenite processing industries for making Titania rich slag and high value of iron. More particularly, the present invention relates to a process using a static bed plasma reactor with in-flight processing for continuous production of titania rich slag and iron ingot from metallized ilmenite. The product titania rich slag can be used for production of TiO2 pigment. Slag can also be used to produce synthetic rutile containing more than 90% TiO2.<br>
Synthetic rutile is primarily produced by chemical treatment of ilmenite with hydrochloric acid or sulphuric acid to upgrade TiC2content to more than 90%. Direct acid leaching of ilmenite with sulphuric acid brings both TiO2 and iron oxide into solution while HCI digestion brings only iron into solution. [E.N. Kramer, U.S. patent 2437164 (1948); British Titan Products Co. Ltd., British patent 1085359(1967); Ching-Lung Lo and T.S. Muckey, Wah Chang Corp. U.S. patent 3193376 (1965); G.S.Davar, Ind. Patent 124558 (1969); Kenzo Ishihara, outline of Ishihara Sangyo kaisha Ltd. (1970); Columbia Southern Chemical Corp. Br. Pat. 795164, (1958); N.N. Murach and LG. povedskaya, USSR patent 116155 (1958); N.A. Aawal, M. Rehman, S.A. Rarafder and A.M.S. Huq, chem. Abs. 85, (1976), 14632]. The disadvantage of these processes is that it generates large quantities of effluents. During such<br><br>
processing for every pound of TiO2 1.2 pounds of iron chloride or 4 pounds of iron sulphate were produced [chemical week, 116(1975) 26]. These wastes are difficult to handle and create pollution problems.<br>
Alternatively, Titania rich slag is produced by smelting the ilmenite in an electric arc furnace where the iron oxide is reduced by carbon and separated as pig iron leaving TiO2 in the slag. [T. Noda, J. Metals, (1965) 1728].<br>
Reduction of ilmenite and melting are simultaneously carried out in the arc furnace. The process was very well commercialized at Sorel, Canada for production of titania rich slag, (G.W. Elger, D.E. Kishy, S.C. Rhoads, USBM Rl 8140, (1976), 31; D-J. Swinden and D.G.Jones, Trans. Inst. Min. metal. Sec. C, 87, (1978), 83-87; A.J.Mercahnt and M.A.Warner, Trans. Inst. Min metal. C, 101, (1992) 177-182; R.H.Nafziger, Trans. Inst. Min. metal. C 87, (1978), 120, P.K. Mishra, S.K.Singh, B.C.Acharya, B.C.Mohanty and P.K.Sahoo, Min. processing, Recent Advances and Future trends, Conf. Proc. (1995), 875-878, (Eds) S.P. Mehrotra and Shekar Rajeev, Allied publ, New Delhi; G.M. Denton, A. Schoukens and S. Francois, European patent 583126 (1994). However, this process for the production of Titania rich slag is very much energy intensive and as such quite uneconomical for countries where electrical energy is scarce and expensive.<br>
Thus, smelting of ilmenite for the production of titania rich slag is very much energy intensive and as such quite uneconomical for countries where electrical energy is scare and expensive. Further, titania rich slag so produced by electrical smelting is tailor made only to sulphate route of TiO2 pigment manufacture and it needs further processing to enable to employ it in chloride process. [Mohandas, P.N.; Bhat, K.H.; Janaki, MEK; Sasibhushanan, S.; Mukherjee, P.S.; Mohanty, B.C.; Ray, H.S. USPA NO. 6,306, 195, Oct. 23,2001].<br>
Plasma smelting of ilmenite have also been investigated for production of TiO2 rich slag and iron ingot [A.D. Brent, The smelting of ilmenite in a d.c. transferred arc plasma furnace with a molten anode configuration, Report No. M304, Randburg Mintek, 15 July, 1987; P.K.Sahoo, R.K.Galgali, S.K.Singh, S. Bhattacharjee, P.K.Mishra and B.C. Mohanty, Sc. J. Metell., 28 (1999) 243]. Reference may be made to US patent 6,306, 195 (2001), where it has been described for the<br><br>
preparation of high-grade synthetic rutile and pig iron by plasma using metallized ilmenite wherein energy requirement can be reduced considerably. [Mohandas, P.N.; Bhat, K.H.; Janaki, MEK; Sasibhushanan, S.; Mukherjee, P.S.; Mohanty, B.C.; Ray, H.S. USPA NO. 6,306, 195, Oct. 23,2001]. Reference may be made to US patent 5,244,488 (1993) where direct smelting process with thermal plasma has been described. (Safo; Ryoda; Shoji, kichino suke; Takemura; Naoshi, US pat 5, 244, 488, September14, 1993).<br>
The smelting of ilmenite to produce Titania rich slag and iron is energy intensive process and hence it may not be suitable for commercial production in the countries where electrical energy is expensive. To reduce the overall energy consumption, a process has been developed to melt the pre-reduced metallized ilmenite in a transferred arc plasma to produce titania rich slag and pig iron [P.N.M Das, K.H, Bhat, P.S.Mukherjee, B.C. Mohanty, H.S. Ray, US Patent No. 6,306, 195 B 7, oct. 23, 2001]. However the disadvantage of the process is that the plasma melting is carried out in a fixed bed plasma reactor and is a batch process. To overcome the above drawback. A patent is filed by R.K.Galgali, P.S. Mukherjee, S.K.Singh, S. Bhattacharjee, &amp; V.N.Mishra where in a moving bed plasma reactor is used for processing of metallized ilmenite in a continuous manner. However, the disadvantages of the process is that a substantial amount of heat is lost in the surroundings by<br>
i)        Radiation<br>
ii)       Splashing of the heated powders.<br>
iii)       Heat loss by residue of unreacted powders.<br>
Object of the invention<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of titania rich slag and iron metal from ilmenite by using static bed plasma reactor with inflight processing, which obviates the drawbacks of the prior art as detailed above.<br><br>
Another objective of the invention is to provide an improved in-flight process for processing metallized ilmenite for the preparation of Titania rich slag and metallic iron with reduced energy consumption.<br>
Yet another object is to provide an improved process for the preparation of titania rich slag and iron metal from metallized ilmenite in a well heat insulated plasma reactor to avoid heat losses.<br>
Yet another objective is to reduce the splashing heated powders in a closed reactor.<br>
Still another object is to eliminate heat loss &amp; material loss due to un reacted powder in the plasma reactor.<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
The present invention is essentially a development of static bed reactor with in-flight process for the preparation of titania rich slag and iron metal from metallized ilmenite in an extend arc plasma reactor. More specifically it relates to an extended plasma arc furnace having one electrode with an axial hole through which an appropriate gas, such as argon is introduced. Still more specifically the furnace embodies a vertical graphite electrode with an inner hollow through which a particulate charge is fed by gravity into the extended plasma arc zone. The in-flight arrangement has facility to vary the feed rate of the charge (metallized ilmenite), which is passed through hollow cathode. The melted charge is collected inside the crucible which acts as anode. Argon as plasmagen gas is passed through the hollow cathode along with the powder feed. The plasma arc is initiated by shorting the two electrodes instantaneously and then lifted to a particular arc length, which is directly proportional to the voltage. A fixed current is set to pass through the arc. The powder feeder stopper is then opened by fixing a particular feed rate of the metallized ilmenite. Both feed rate &amp; time were varied for a particular metallized ilmenite. Keeping feed rate and duration of smelting constant ilmenite with various degree of metallization was treated by inflight processing. The observations were analyzed with respect to yield rate, energy consumption and metallic iron yield (%). The percentage of iron separated i.e. the metal yield % is directly proportional to the slag quality. Energy consumption was measured using an energy meter placed in the electrical circuit.<br>
In accordance with this invention it has been found that improvements in operation and in economy for the process can be effected by the inflight extended arc plasma reactor design and parameters of operation, which are described herein. The improved design is based on the extended arc plasma which is stabilized with one electrode having an axial opening through which an appropriate gas is passed. Such as argon is fed into the arc. The reactor design also features a vertical powder feeder positioned in the top electrode which is above the extended arc so that the particulate charge may be fed by gravity directly into the stabilized extended arc plasma zone.<br>
It has been found that this operation results in.<br><br>
(1)	Reduced energy consumption.<br>
(2)	Improved heat transfer.<br>
(3)	Reduced heat loss.<br>
(4)	Improved power control.<br>
(5)	Reduced acoustical and electrical noise.<br>
The preparation of TiO2 rich slag by this process is beneficial in many ways .The process is eco-friendly and creation of large amount of effluent by chemical route can be avoided while producing synthetic TiOa using titania rich slag. Secondly, energy consumption can be reduced considerably in comparison to the conventional processes and the by-product viz-high value iron known as Sorel metal is an equally important and marketable product.<br>
In the present invention, the apparatus includes three major functional component systems.<br>
(i)       Static bed plasma reactor assembly (ii)      Master control unit, (iii)      Plasma power supply.<br>
In the present invention the graphite electrode is held in a water-cooled holder having facility to connect DC terminal (cathode). The electrode has an axial hole to pass plasma forming argon gas. The electrode is mounted on a rack and pinion mechanism for up and down movement of the electrode.<br>
In yet another feature of the present invention, the reactor is equipped with master control unit for regulating voltage &amp; current.<br>
This unit comprises main electrical switch for switching power on or off to the reactor. Gas flow meters for precise control of the gas to the electrodes, volt meter for measuring the on load voltage, Ammeter for measuring the arc current and energy meter for measuring the input power to the reactor, safety switch for switching off electrical supply to the unit in the event of water supply to the reactor assembly is stopped.<br>
Supply of water and gas to plasma reactor is ensured and the plasma power supply switch is put on to provide power to the reactor before the beginning of the<br><br>
experiment while keeping both electrodes in contact with each other. Plasma is generated by moving top electrode away and stabilizing the arc.<br>
The process of the invention generally involves the following sequential steps.<br>
Power input to plasma reactor and powder feed rate arc prefixed and melting of metallized ilmenite is carried out and duration of melting is varied. After a fixed time the crucible was taken out and the molten product, which is collected inside the graphite crucible in the form of a lump was separated out. The iron gets separated due to melting point difference and settles at the bottom because of its higher density. The solidified lump was then cleaned and crushed in order to separate the titania rich slag and the pig iron. Both the slag &amp; metal were weighted separately to find the yield and the % iron separated. Energy consumption was recorded by the energy meter. The raw material for the plasma experiment i.e. metallized ilmenite (85%) has the following major composition.<br>
Total iron-39.61% Metallic iron - 33.45% Ti02 - 56.5% Phosphorus-0.01% Carbon-0.91% Sulphur-0.11%<br>
Thermal Plasma parameters can be varied as given below Arc Currents 100-500 amp Arc Voltage = 30 - 90 V Argon flow = 0 to 10 Itr/min Feed rate = 70 to 500 gm/min<br>
Following experimental parameters were fixed for the thermal plasma as typical examples.<br>
Arc Current = 200 amps.<br><br>
Arc Voltage = 60 V Argon flow = 2 lit/min<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustrates of the working of the invention in actual practice and therefore shouldn't be read or construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
