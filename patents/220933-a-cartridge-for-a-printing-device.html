This application was divided out of Indian patent application no,IN/PCT/2001/00381/DEL, dated 9 November 1999.<br>
The present invention relates to cartridges for printing device. The cartridge has been developed originally as a cartridge for a sticker printing digital camera device that is preferably sized to be hand held and will be described hereinafter with reference to this application. However, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the inventive cartridge can be used with many other kinds and types of printer devices where it is desired to print ink onto adhesive print media.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
In accordance with the invention there is provided a cartridge for a printing device, said cartridge including:<br>
a cartridge casing defining a first container portion for housing therein a supply of adhesive coated print media and a second container portion for storing an ink supply.<br>
Preferably, the cartridge includes some form of authentication means that is recognisable by the printing device.<br>
Desirably, the ink storage container portion of the cartridge includes one or more ink outlets that are piercable upon installation so as to connect with an ink distribution unit on the printing device.<br><br>
In the preferred form, the casing housing the sticker rollers of a generally annular configuration with the ink storage container extending outwardly therefrom. Preferably, the cartridge casing is adapted to snap fit with the device with which it is to be used.<br>
In one particularly preferred form, the cartridge is sized and configured for use with a sticker printing digital camera device of the kind described hereafter.<br>

Description of Preferred and Other Embodiments<br>
The preferred application of the inventive cartridge is to a sticker printing camera able to print stickers on demand on a replenishable printroll. The "stickercam" 1 as illustrated in the accompanying figures has a multi-part housing defined by an external front cover moulding 2, an internal sub-structure and rear molding 3, a sticker and ink cartridge molding 4 and an external rear cover 5.<br>
The housing in the illustrated preferred form is generally tear drop shaped in elevation, the generally circular portion 6 being adapted to store stickers in a printroll form and the remaining portion housing the ink supply 7, printhead arrangement 8 and sticker feed mechanism 9.<br>
The view finder 10 is also disposed at or near the centre of the circular housing portion 6 and extends fully through the casing from the front cover 2 to an optional eye piece 11 on the rear. Provided immediately below the view finder 10 at the front of the<br><br>
casing is a camera lens 12 which is operatively associated with the suitable image sensing ,    and processing means such as the CCD 13 shown in Fig. 12. Further, a "take" button 14 is provided at the top of the casing together with a "print" button 15 for taking and printing images respectively.<br>
The preferred "stickercam" as illustrated also includes an "effects dial" 16 which is rotatable so as to implement a series of effects such as normal, black and white, sepia, soft blending, etc. It can also be used for the addition of graphical clip arts such as love hearts, flowers, surprise effects etc. On the dial, a series of icon pictures may be provided on which is printed an indicator of the effect. The effect placed at the indicator marker 17 is the one then applied by the camera. The effect dial can be implemented by placing a series of conductive segments on the reverse side of the wheel with the conductive segments forming a binary pattern indicative of the type of effect to be displayed. The segments can complete a circuit monitorable by the stickercam so as to provide for the effect.<br>
The stickers are provided in the form of a sticker roll 18 which is preferably housed in a cartridge assembly 19 according to the present invention which is releasably secured to the external casing. This first preferred form of the cartridge is of a similar shape and structure to the external housing of the camera device and comprises a top molding 20 which defines a first generally annular sticker roll containing portion 21 and a second generally triangular sectioned ink storage portion 22. The ink storage portion is preferably divided into a plurality of distinct chambers 23 so as to provide for both colour and black and white printing. Two slots are also provided in the side wall of the cartridge top molding, the first being a sticker exit slot 24 and the second being a pick up roller slot 25 which forms part of the sticker feed mechanism 27 that is described in more detail below. The cartridge 19 also includes a base molding 28 which seals both the sticker roll cavity and the ink chambers. Preferably, ink outlet perforations 29 are provided in the base molding that are covered by a sealing film that is pierced during installation so as to be in fluid communication with a printer mechanism 30. Desirably, the cartridge is a sealed unit such that the stickers and ink supply are to be replenished simultaneously. Conveniently, the cartridge may be snap fitted with the external housing by means of pressure snap mounts 31 shown in the drawings.<br><br>
The sticker feed mechanism 27 and printer mechanism 30 are best illustrated in figures 2, 5, 7, 9 and 12. The sticker feed mechanism 27 includes a pick up roller 32 which spools the stickers forward once the cartridge has been inserted in the outer housing. Adjacent the pick up roller are several pairs of drive rollers or nip rollers 33 which are operated via an appropriate gear chain 34 by the motor 35. A serrated cutter 36 may also be provided as part of the feed sub-assembly and arranged so as to be adjacent the printed sticker outlet 37 that is formed as part of the housing front molding 2. Alternatively, a guillotine type arrangement could be provided.<br>
The printer mechanism 30 is best shown in figures 6 and 7 and comprises a page width printhead chip 40 with an ink distribution unit 41. Forming part of the ink distribution unit is an ink supply connection manifold 42 which has a plurality of ink inlet projections 43 which engage the ink outlet perforations 29 on the sticker roll and ink cartridge 19. Preferably, the printer mechanism and sticker feed mechanism are a single unit and are detachable for replacement or repair.<br>
Turning now to Figure 12 (and Figure 5), there is shown a schematic arrangement of a part of the electrical circuitry for the control and operation of the stickercam device. As can be seen, a simple flexible PCB harness can be used to interconnect the take and print buttons 14 and 15 to the CCD 13 and the printhead assembly 30. Also provided as part of the circuit are contacts 45 for the power supply which is preferably in the form of a three volt battery 46. Further, the detachable printhead and/or sticker and ink supply cartridge preferably include an authentication mechanism such as that outlined in applicant's earlier PCT application number PCT/AU98/00544 entitled "A camera with an internal printing system". The authentication chip contact 47 is shown in Figure 12.<br>
In use, the "stickercam" is oriented toward the target subject and the take button 14 is then operated to capture the image. The effects dial 16 can then be rotated and an effect selected. When the print button 15 is then operated the sticker feed mechanism 27 delivers the next sticker or portion of sticker media to the printhead assembly 30 for printing of the effect processed image thereon.<br>
Numerous variations are possible within the overall inventive concept of the "stickercam". For example, the printhead unit can be a suitable adaptation of that outlined in the Australian provisional patent application entitled "Image Creation Method and Apparatus (ART 79)" filed concurrently herewith by the present applicant, the<br><br>
contents of which are hereby incorporated by cross reference. Alternatively, the preferred embodiment can be implemented as a rearrangement of the system disclosed in PCT Patent Application PCT/AU98/00549 (WO 99/04551) entitled "A Replenishable One Time Use Camera System" also filed by the present applicant. Advantageously, the image sensor can be of a reduced size to that described in the above referenced PCT application due to the small size of the stickers.<br>
Similarly, the electronics of the stickercam can be based around a CMOS images sensor 19 which also includes processing circuitry for processing an image and forwarding it to the printhead 12 for printing. The operation of the internal control electronics can be substantially as set out in the aforementioned PCT specification WO 99/04551.<br>
Although the invention has been described with reference to one specific examples, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the inventive cartridge can be embodied in many other forms and adapted for use with printers and printer applications of all kinds and types.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
