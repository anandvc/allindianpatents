				<td>The present invention relates to liquors having aromatic principles resembling musk <br>
process for introducing with a characteristic taste and mouth- feeling. More particularly, this invention is concerned with spicy liquors havings aroma resembling Musk concentrate obtained from the male musk deer roaming in the wooded foothills of the Himalayas, and a process for preparing such liquors resembling brandy in body and taste. The liquors of this invention may thus be called 'Musk Brandy' to give an idea of the aroma and also the body and taste of the subject beverage.<br>
It has been observed that beverages containing ethanol having soothing but not inebriating effects, are obtained when, in a suitable stage of their preparation or in their finished slate, there are incorporated in them one or more derivatives of carbohydrates of the type n (C6H10O5) in which an organic radical is substituted for at least one hydroxyl atom, such as ethers or esters. which are soluble in aqueous ethanol or in water<br>
Spicy liquors have long been favourite Oriental beverages, very much liked and patronized by royalties, emperors, Kings and rulers in the Indian Sub-continent It is noted that such spicy liquors have been popular and in use for around 250 years Amidst various spices and flavouring agents used in preparing the liquors, musk has always occupied a place of prominence due mainly to its unique aroma and other characteristic qualities, which has been used liberally in many preparations, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic.<br>
In the olden days forest cover was a plenty in the foothills region of the Himalayas, where Musk deer used to roam about freely and its population was quite substantial. The musk concentrate was obtained from a 'Sac' located in the lower abdominal region of male Musk deer. The musk obtained from the animal in the 'Sac' was extensively used in making Ayurvedic medicinal preparations. The aroma and medicinal properties of musk obtained from Musk deer was put to use by the present applicant in arriving at a unique liquor<br><br>
named as "Sikkim Musk Brandy"<br>
Unfortunately due to extensive deforestation and indiscriminate killing has resulted in an alarming dwindling of the Musk deer population which has become an endangered species in real sense of the term So much so, since sometime past a total ban has been imposed by the Govt, of India and other organizations, e.g. World Wildlife Fund on the hunting and killing of Musk deer This has resulted in virtual non-availability of musk, causing deterioration in quality, taste, aroma, etc However, after a sustained developmental work, a formulation has been evolved which when added to the liquor, imparts unique taste, aroma and qualities. The formulation is a virtual substitute for 'musk' and is obtained mainly from naturally occurring spices, herbs and fruits, both fresh and in dry conditions. Inclusion of this formulation in a liquor in a particular manner results in "Sikkim Musk Brandy"<br>
As pointed out earlier, Sikkim Musk Brandy is unique in flavour, taste and properties The formulation is prepared by using tinctures of spices and herbs, such as, for instance, cardamom, mace, nutmeg, brown and white sandalwood, aniseed, saffron and such other organic materials from vegetative sources. The tinctures or active principles of the herbs and spices may be extracted by a novel technique evolved for the first time by the Applicants This technique does not necessitate refluxing or warming / heating to take out the active principles of spices and herbs, and thus may be adequately termed "cold extraction". It is to be noted that none of the individual ingredient from vegetative sources is capable of exuding 'musk' aroma, but surprisingly the aroma is generated when the aforesaid ingredients are mixed together and is subjected to 'cold extraction'.<br>
The principal object of this invention is to evolve a process for producing liquors with aromatic principles resembling musk<br>
A further object of the present invention concerns a process for<br>
[2]<br><br>
producing liquors wherein the active ingredients of the aromatic principles are taken out from the present bodies by a novel 'cold extraction' technique.<br>
Another object of this invention is to evolve a process wherein ingredients from vegetative sources are processed to evolve a formulation having an aroma which resembles natural musk from Musk deer.<br>
The foregoing and other objects are fulfilled by the present invention relating to a process for producing liquors with aromatic principles resembling musk which comprises in combination -<br>
a)	sorting, picking and grinding the following spices and herbs in<br>
amounts indicated against each one of them :<br>
i)	cardamon	-	12.5 - 18 Kgs<br>
ii)	mace	-	1.5 - 3 Kgs<br>
lii)	nutmeg	-	3-5 Kgs<br>
iv)	brown sandalwood	-	7.5-12.5 Kgs<br>
v)	white sandalwood	-	7.5-12.5 Kgs<br>
vi)	saffron	-	1.0 - 2.5 Kgs and<br>
vii)	aniseed	-	18.0 - 22.5 Kgs<br>
b) adding to the ground mass a desired amount of honey of from around 40 to around 60 Kgs or the like sweetening agent and thoroughly mixing the same ;<br>
c) soaking the mix obtained from step (b) in neutral alcohol of 40% v/v strength ;<br>
d) allowing the entire mass to stand for around 15 days and agitating the same for around 30 minutes everyday by means of an agitator/churner ;<br>
e) transferring the mass to a specially designed pot still and heating the same with an indirect source of heat under controlled conditions of temperature and pressure to give rise to a distillate ;<br>
f) blending the distillate with requisite quantity of extra neutral alcohol, fruits spirit and demineralized water ;<br>
g) maturing the blend obtained from step (vi) in wooden casks, vats or similar receptacles for a predetermined period and, if desired, h) filtering and bottling the desired end product.<br>
[3]<br><br>
vii) maturing the blend obtained from step (vi) in wooden casks vats or similar receptacles for a predetermined period and. if desired,<br>
viii) filtering and bottling the desired end product<br>
Sikkim "Musk Brandy" i.e. the end product aforesaid is unique in flavour, taste and properties. This is obtained by using tinctures of spices and herbs and other organic materials mentioned below extracted by a novel technique which may justifiably be termed as "cold extraction" .<br>
I. Cardamom	- 12 5	-	18	Kgs<br>
II. Mace	- 1.5	-	3	Kgs<br>
III. Nutmeg	- 3	-	5	Kgs<br>
IV. Saffron	- 1 0	-	2.5	Kgs<br>
V	Brown Sandalwood	- 7.5	-	12 5	Kgs<br>
VI	White Sandalwood	- 7.5	-	12.5	Kgs<br>
VII. Aniseed	- 18.0	-	22 5	Kgs<br>
VIII.Honey	- 40	-	60	Kgs<br>
As mentioned earlier, all the herbs and spices are ground and/or pulverised to a desired degree of fineness. The ground materials are mixed with honey, treacle or similar carbohydrate - rich material either before or after grinding or pulverising and the mix is soaked in extra neutral alcohol of desired quality. The alcohol (ethanol) is of 40% v/v strength and the soaking is continued for around a fortnight. The entire mass is stirred manually or with an<br>
[4]<br><br>
agitator/stirrer fitted in the vessel containing the soaked material Such agitation is continued for a limited duration, say, for around 30 mins per day and then the soaked mass is allowed to stand for the rest of the day After this cold tincture extraction procedure, the entire mass is transferred to a special!) designed pot still. The cold extract is distilled by indirect heating, either by steam coil or by electrical heating The pressure inside the coil is maintained at around 2 0 Kg/cm2 and temperature during the distillation is maintained between 105° and 115°C, preferably at around 110°C.<br>
The distillate from the tincture is obtained by batch process distillation under controlled conditions of temperature and pressure indicated above by using specially designed high-performance pot still The distillate is then blended with requisite amount of high grade extra neutral alcohol, fruits spirit and demineralised water, preferably from Himalayan springs The blended mixture is then allowed to mature in wooden casks/vats for around 2 years to lend body and to achieve a soothing mellowness The end product may be filtered, bottled, and marketed as rich and uniquely spiced, oriental "Sikkim Musk Brandy".<br>
The invention will now be more explicitly described by the following illustrative example which is given by way of illustration and not by way of limitation<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
Preparation of 'Sikkim Musk Brandy' is preceded by carrying out of cold extraction technique for extracting tinctures of spices and herbs, such as cardamom, mace, nutmeg, brown and white sandalwood, aniseed, saffron, honey and such other organic materials. In accordance with the aforesaid cold extraction process, all the spices and herbs are ground in dry condition wherein the ingredients are taken in the following amounts<br>
[5]<br><br>
I. Cardamom	- 15 Kgs<br>
II Mace	- 02 Kgs<br>
III. Nutmeg	- 04 Kgs<br>
IV. Brown Sandalwood	- 10 Kgs<br>
V	White Sandalwood	- 10 Kgs<br>
VI Saffron	- 1.5 Kgs<br>
VII Aniseed	- 20 Kgs. VIII.Honey	- 50 Kgs<br>
All the ground herbs and spices are mixed and soaked in extra neutral alcohol of 40% v/v strength for a minimum of 15 days by mixing with an agitator for 30 minutes duration everyday After this cold extraction process the entire mass is transferred to a specially designed pot still The cold extract is distilled by indirect heating with steam coil. The maximum pressure in the coil is maintained at 2.0 kg/cm2 and the temperature during distillation is maintained at 110°C (+ 2°c).<br>
The distillate from this tincture is obtained by a batch process distillatioin under closely controlled parameters of temperature and pressure as given above with the help of specially designed high performance pot still. This distillate is then blended with requisite amount of high grade extra neutral alcohol, fruits spirit and de-mineralized Himalayan spring water to produce 5000 litres of finished product.<br>
The blended mixture is then allowed to mature in wooden casks / vats for two years to achieve body and a soothing mellowness The end product is filtered, bottled and marketed as a rich and uniquely spiced, oriental "Sikkim<br>
[6]<br><br>
Musk Brandy"<br>
When the final product is intended, besides ethanol, to contain substances imparting special taste or aroma, or sweetening substances, or juices of fruits or syrups, or flavouring agents, such aromatic essence or oils, or colouring matters, in short any material(s) other than ethanol, the derivatives of carbohydrates or their solutions, as far as it is compatible with the nature of the respective mgredient(s) may be incorporated with these materials and thereafter introduced into the alcoholic beverages, for example by incorporating them with the solution of ethanol intended for the final product which may or may not contain some other ingredients to be present in the final product.<br>
While the invention has been described above by way of illustration, it includes within its scope alternatives and obvious equivalents without deviating from the spirit and scope of the invention<br>
