				<td>OXY-COMBUSTION COAL FIRED BOILER AND METHOD OF<br>
TRANSITIONING BETWEEN AIR AND OXYGEN FIRING<br>
[0001] Field of the Invention<br>
[0002] The present invention relates generally to oxy-combustion, and in particular, to a<br>
new and useful combustion apparatus and methodology of fossil fuel combustion<br>
wherein combustion air is replaced with an oxygenated combustion gas to produce a<br>
flue gas comprised primarily of carbon dioxide.<br>
[0003] Background<br>
[0004] The combustion of fossil fuels such as coal has provided a reliable and cost<br>
effective means of producing electricity for several decades. During this time ever-<br>
tightening emissions constraints across different regions of the world have continually<br>
produced a need to develop new and improved technologies aimed at reducing coal<br>
fired plant emissions to near zero.<br>
 <br>
[0005] Over the years this need has been met as technologies to control the emission<br>
of many pollutants such as sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, particulates, and mercury<br>
were successfully developed. Recently however, a growing concern has developed to<br>
control or otherwise regulate the emission of carbon dioxide from coal fired power<br>
plants.<br>
[0006] One promising technology capable of reducing carbon dioxide emissions is oxy-<br>
combustion. In traditional coal fired applications, coal is combusted in the presence of<br>
air, which is approximately 79 percent by volume nitrogen. Carbon dioxide, a natural<br>
byproduct of combustion, is present as a dilute constituent of the resulting flue gas, thus<br>
requiring an additional step such as chemical scrubbing to separate the carbon dioxide<br>
from the flue gas.<br>
[0007] Unlike traditional air firing, oxy-combustion enables the combustion of coal in the<br>
absence air, thereby eliminating Nitrogen's dilution effect. Air is replaced with recycled<br>
flue gas and near pure oxygen is introduced into the combustion system in sufficient<br>
quantities to produce a flue gas consisting essentially of carbon dioxide and water. In<br>
addition to reducing nitrogen oxide emissions by virtue of an absence of nitrogen, the<br>
resulting carbon dioxide rich combustion byproduct can be processed without the need<br>
of an additional chemical scrubbing step.<br>
 <br>
[0008] While the abstract concept and associated benefits of oxy-combustion presented<br>
above can be appreciated, significant technical challenges remain for oxy-combustion to<br>
be implemented on a commercial scale. These challenges include but are not limited to<br>
developing a means of adequately oxygenating a flue gas and a methodology of starting<br>
up, transitioning to, and operating a commercial scale oxy-combustion boiler.<br>
[0009] Summary of the Invention<br>
[0010] The present invention solves the aforementioned problems by providing an oxy-<br>
combustion boiler structure and a method of operating, transitioning to, and starting up<br>
an oxy-combustion boiler. The present invention further promotes control of carbon<br>
dioxide emissions by providing a combustion methodology capable of producing a flue<br>
gas consisting essentially of carbon dioxide and water, which is readily capable of being<br>
processed for storage or other industrial uses.<br>
[0011] The present invention provides a boiler structure and methodology for transition<br>
between air and oxygen firing for a utility coal boiler. Transition may begin with either<br>
the primary or secondary stream, or both concurrently. Once the transition is initiated by<br>
the operator, the flue gas recycle flow control damper for the stream being transitioned<br>
is gradually ramped open allowing flue gas to enter the fan (FD for secondary stream or<br>
and PA for primary stream) inlet and mix with the air entering from the fresh air intake.<br>
[0012] With the recycle flow control damper open, the fresh air inlet control damper for<br>
the fan being transitioned is gradually ramped closed, further increasing the recycle flue<br>
 <br>
gas flow into the fan inlet. During this process, a near pure oxygen gas flows from an<br>
oxygen supply to one or more oxygen/recycled flue gas mixing locations.<br>
[0013] The gas flow and mixing rates are carefully measured and controlled based on<br>
the changing contributions from the fresh air and flue gas recycle streams to provide the<br>
proper proportions of gaseous mass flow and oxygen needed for complete combustion<br>
of the fuel, and trimmed as necessary to maintain desired excess oxygen levels at the<br>
boiler outlet to account for unmeasured variation in the composition of the fuel being<br>
combusted. During transition between the air and oxygen firing modes, the transition<br>
density is calculated as a function of the measured recycled flue gas and fresh air flows<br>
and the measured oxygen level in the recycled flue gas.<br>
[0014] Once the fresh air inlet control dampers are closed, the associated fresh air<br>
isolation dampers are closed to minimize the infiltration of nitrogen rich air into the flue<br>
gas recycle through the fresh air inlet control damper. FD and PA fans control and<br>
maintain the required mass flows in the primary and secondary streams during<br>
transition.<br>
[0015] FD and PA fan flows are measured after the airheater to account for any leakage<br>
in the airheater. These flows are temperature compensated based on the densities of<br>
the air and oxygen/recycle gas flow streams. Equilibrium is maintained by venting<br>
excess flue gas flow (the sum of the excess oxidant added, air infiltration, and the<br>
 <br>
products of combustion) to the stack. System pressure during transition is maintained<br>
by regulating the stack inlet damper.<br>
[0016] Full oxygen combustion mode is established once both the primary and<br>
secondary streams are full transitioned and all fresh air intakes are fully closed. Once<br>
the flue gas reaches the desired C02 concentration in full oxygen combustion mode,<br>
the Compression and Purification Unit (CPU) can be placed in service.<br>
[0017] As the compressor is loaded, the stack inlet damper will begin to close in a<br>
controlled manner that maintains the desired pressure balance. When the stack inlet<br>
damper reaches the limit of its control range, control of the system pressure balance will<br>
switch to the CPU, wherein the non-recycled flue gas (having a high C02 concentration)<br>
that would otherwise exit the stack is processed by the CPU for C02 purification and<br>
pressurization into a liquid form for storage via sequestration or otherwise.<br>
[0018] The various features of novelty which characterize the present invention are<br>
pointed out with particularity in the claims annexed to and forming a part of this<br>
disclosure. For a better understanding of the invention, its operating advantages and<br>
specific benefits attained by its uses, reference is made to the accompanying drawings<br>
and descriptive matter in which the preferred embodiments of the invention are<br>
illustrated.<br>

[0024] Stoichiometric Oxygen is defined as the amount of theoretical oxygen required to<br>
combust a given fuel at a given load.<br>

referred to as the ASU Demand.<br>
[0029] Oxygen is defined as nearly pure oxygen, which may be supplied by an air<br>
separation unit (ASU)<br>
[0030] Detailed Description<br>
[0031] Oxygen combustion is a means of drastically decreasing the amount of nitrogen<br>
in the flue gas from a boiler firing a carbonaceous fuel in order to achieve a much higher<br>
concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the combustion gasses to permit cleaning,<br>
compression and storage.<br>
[0032] The present invention provides a new and unique coal fired oxy-combustion<br>
process wherein near pure oxygen may be introduced to the boiler furnace in several<br>
locations including directly into the flame through the burner and/or directly into the<br>
furnace as nearly pure oxygen, and/or into the recycle flue gas streams to the burners,<br>
including both primary and secondary streams.<br>
 <br>
[0033] The boiler unit is preferably started up on air, and subsequently transitioned to<br>
oxy-combustion firing wherein as much as about 70 percent, and in some applications<br>
greater than 70 percent, of flue gas leaving the boiler is recycled back to the combustion<br>
process replacing the air normally used for combustion. A brief description of a means<br>
of air start up to achieve a gas mass flow is provided below. The description is merely<br>
exemplary in nature to provide a broader understanding of fossil fuel combustion. The<br>
steps provide shall not be interpreted as necessary elements of the present invention,<br>
as there are various methodologies of starting an air fired boiler, many of which are<br>
dependent on boiler arrangement, fuel, and other criteria.<br>
[0034] Coal Fired Utility Start-up on Air<br>
[0035] A first step in starting an air fired boiler system is establishing an open flow path<br>
through the unit by opening control and shutoff dampers between the forced draft fan<br>
inlet and the unit's stack. As part of establishing the open flow path, the burner air<br>
registers are positioned to their burner light-off position, which typically establishes a<br>
small flow of air through the unit by natural draft created by the stack effect.<br>
[0036] Once and open flow path is established, the control and outlet damper on the<br>
first induced draft (ID) fan are closed as part of the ID fan start procedure. The dampers<br>
remain open on the second ID fan maintaining the open flow path. The ID fan motor is<br>
energized and after the fan comes up to speed; its outlet damper is opened as the outlet<br>
damper on the other ID fan is closed to eliminate any recirculating flow through the idle<br>
 <br>
ID fan. The operating ID fan inlet vane position or blade angle, depending on whether it<br>
is a centrifugal or axial flow fan, is adjusted to provide an air flow through the unit while<br>
maintaining the furnace at a desired pressure.<br>
[0037] In a similar fashion, the control and outlet damper on the first forced draft (FD)<br>
fan are closed as part of its start procedure. The dampers remain open on the second<br>
FD fan maintaining the open flow path. The FD fan motor is energized and after the fan<br>
comes up to speed; its outlet damper is opened as the outlet damper on the other FD<br>
fans are closed to eliminate any recirculating flow through the idle FD fan. The<br>
operating FD fan inlet vane position or blade angle, depending on whether it is a<br>
centrifugal or axial flow fan, is adjusted to establish the minimum boiler air flow through<br>
the unit required to perform a purge of the boiler enclosure. The ID fan 23 is adjusted<br>
at the same time to maintain the furnace at a desired pressure.<br>
[0038] The unit is then purged with all sources of fuel or other combustibles proven off<br>
to remove any combustibles which may be present in the unit. Code requires the purge<br>
rate air flow be maintained through the unit for at least five minutes and until at least five<br>
volume changes of the boiler enclosure have occurred. The air flow is required to be at<br>
least 25% of the design full load mass air flow for the unit and, for coal fired units, not<br>
greater than 40% of the design full load mass air flow. The boiler enclosure is defined<br>
by code as the volume where combustion occurs and is enclosed by pressure parts.<br>
Depending on the specific coal characteristics a unit is designed to fire, the time<br>
 <br>
required to achieve five volume changes can be longer than the minimum five minutes<br>
specified to account for the enclosure volume.<br>
[0039] When the purge requirements have been satisfied, the Master Fuel Trip (MFT)<br>
relays are reset, allowing firing to be initiated in the unit. Igniters, generally natural gas<br>
or oil are placed in service to begin warming the unit. As the unit warms up, the<br>
secondary air temperature will increase, improving the combustion in the unit. Once<br>
heat input from the igniters is insufficient to further increase steam flow from the unit,<br>
coal firing is initiated.<br>
[0040] With the igniters in service on the first coal pulverizer to be placed in service, a<br>
Primary Air (PA) fan will be started with its control and outlet dampers closed. After the<br>
PA fan motor comes up to speed, its outlet damper will be opened. Its inlet damper will<br>
try to maintain the desired pressure in the duct downstream even though no hot or<br>
tempering air flow occurs since primary air flow has yet to be established through any<br>
pulverizer.<br>
[0041] The PA shutoff damper on the first pulverizer to be placed in service will be<br>
opened and then the burner line shutoff valves on the pulverizer will be opened<br>
establishing primary air flow through the pulverizer to the burners. To prevent exposing<br>
pulverizer lubricants and seals to the hot primary air flow (~500-700 F) temperatures<br>
prior to coal being admitted to the pulverizer, the primary air flow is limited to only<br>
tempering air flow (~110 F) as the hot air damper is maintained closed.<br>
 <br>
[0042] Depending on the grade of coal and the weather conditions it has been exposed<br>
to since it was mined, the inherent and surface moisture of the raw coal can vary from<br>
greatly. Once the primary air flow has stabilized, the feeder discharge gate is opened<br>
and the raw coal feeder is started. With the coal flow available to limit excessive<br>
temperatures in the pulverizer, the temperature of the coal-air mixture at the pulverizer<br>
outlet is controlled with the hot air damper opening while the tempering air damper<br>
closes to achieve the desired pulverizer outlet temperature for stable combustion and to<br>
achieve drying of the coal to improve the grinding process. The ratio of hot and<br>
tempering air flows is controlled to maintain the outlet temperature at its setpoint. This<br>
changes the temperature of the primary air entering the pulverizer to provide the heat<br>
needed to evaporate surface moisture and raise the temperature of the coal and<br>
remaining moisture to the outlet temperature.<br>
[0043] The raw coal entering the pulverizer goes through the grinding zone and is<br>
fluidized by the primary air flow with only the desired smaller particles (70% through 200<br>
mesh) making it through the classification action in the pulverizer. The coal which is<br>
rejected recycles back through the grinding zone along with the raw coal feed. This<br>
coal storage in the pulverizer results in the coal to the burners lagging the raw coal feed<br>
by a 3rd or 4th order lag function. Once sufficient coal flow to the burners is achieved for<br>
stable combustion, the burner air registers on the operating pulverizer are opened to<br>
their firing position.<br>
 <br>
[0044] As the loading on the boiler is increased, the raw coal feed rate and primary air<br>
flow are increased. Total boiler air flow is maintained at the purge rate air flow with the<br>
secondary air flow decreasing proportionally to the increase in primary air flow. As load<br>
conditions permit, an additional pulverizer is placed in service following the same<br>
procedure.<br>
[0045] When the boiler firing rate air flow requirements exceed the purge rate air flow,<br>
the total boiler air flow is increased to maintain the desired excess air for the firing rate.<br>
At this point, air registers on idle burners are moved to their cooling positions to<br>
distribute the required air to the operating burners.<br>
[0046] With stable combustion established in the furnace, igniters can be removed from<br>
service. This condition normally requires at least two pulverizers in service, the unit<br>
load above 25 percent and the combustion air temperature above 200 F.<br>
[0047] Additional pulverizers are placed in service as required by the unit load by<br>
placing its air registers to the light off position, placing its igniters in service and starting<br>
the pulverizer following the procedure described above.<br>
[0048] Transition from Air to Oxy-combustion<br>
[0049] Once a minimum load for transition is reached, a coal fired boiler can be<br>
transitioned from using air as the oxidant to using near pure oxygen. Minimum load for<br>
 <br>
transition will vary based upon boiler type, in drum boiler applications for example<br>
minimum load would be approximately 30% load, and in general below about 40% load<br>
in most applications. Essential to the transition is controlling flue gas recycle. During<br>
transition, the mass volume of nitrogen from air is essentially eliminated and the<br>
resulting quantity of combustion gas produced can be approximately a fourth of that in<br>
air firing. In order to provide the gas mass flow necessary for maintaining the required<br>
boiler heat absorption during transition, flue gas is recycled. The present invention, as<br>
described herein, provides a means of smoothly and safely transitioning from air firing to<br>
oxy-combustion with flue gas recycle.<br>
[0050] A coal fired boiler 1, such as that schematically illustrated in Fig 1, is provided<br>
and started in a usual air fired manner and brought to an approximately stable load. An<br>
oxygen supply system, such as an Air Separation Unit (ASU), is proximately available<br>
and prepared for oxygen supply service prior to initiating transition.<br>
[0051] To facilitate the transition and minimize air infiltration, individual flow control<br>
dampers 18A, 18B and tight shutoff (TSO) dampers 19A, 19B are provided on the fresh<br>
air intakes 8, 9 upstream of the for the Forced Draft 10 and Primary Air fans 7. Air flow<br>
measurement is also provided. Recycle flow control dampers 20A, 20B are also<br>
provided at the take-off of the primary and the secondary recycle flues to their<br>
respective fans.<br>
 <br>
[0052] Prior to the initiation of the transition, the FD 10 and PA 7 fans, fresh air inlet<br>
control 19A, 19B and isolation (tight shut-off) dampers 18A, 18B will be fully open and<br>
the associated flue gas recycle control dampers 20A, 20B fully closed. The stack inlet<br>
damper 21 will be open with all flue gas going to the stack.<br>
[0053] In a first transition step, oxygen may be supplied to the system through an<br>
operating burner 14 via an oxygen lance 15. In this embodiment the lance 15 is<br>
preferably purged prior to the addition of oxygen to avoid accumulation of particulate<br>
and cool the lance. In this step oxygen is first introduced to the lance of the operating<br>
burners at a minimum flow rate as defined by lance cooling requirements then<br>
increased as needed during transition to maintain stability of combustion at the burner.<br>
[0054] In another transition step, the secondary recycle damper 20B begins to open and<br>
the transition between secondary air and secondary oxygenated recycled flue gas<br>
begins. As the FD fan fresh air feed clamper 19B begins to close, secondary oxygen,<br>
provided to the secondary oxygen mixer 11 is mixed with recycled flue gas and any<br>
remaining intake air to produce a secondary oxygenated recycled flue gas of a desired<br>
oxygen concentration. . Transition is complete once the secondary recycle damper 20B<br>
is fully opened and the FD fan fresh air damper is closed 19B. In one embodiment the<br>
transition occurs at a rate between about 1 and about 3 percent full load per minute,<br>
and more preferably at about 2 percent full load per minute. It is understood that rate of<br>
transition will vary from this embodiment due to variation in boiler applications, fuel<br>
types and other design criteria.<br>
 <br>
[0055] During this step of oxygenating the secondary recycled flue gas the oxygen<br>
concentration is monitored downstream of the secondary oxygen mixer 11. Introduction<br>
of oxygen into the secondary mixer 11 is then adjusted to maintain between about 4<br>
percent and about 28 percent oxygen in the secondary oxygenated recycled flue gas. In<br>
a preferred embodiment the oxygen concentration is maintained between about 18 and<br>
about 23 percent. Once transition is complete, tight shut off damper 18B is closed to<br>
prevent air infiltration.<br>
[0056] In another transition step, primary recycle damper 20A subsequently begins to<br>
open and the transition between primary air and primary oxygenated recycled flue gas<br>
begins. As the PA fan fresh air feed damper 19A begins to close, primary oxygen,<br>
provided to the primary oxygen mixer 5 is mixed with recycled flue gas and any<br>
remaining intake air to produce a primary oxygenated recycled flue gas of a desired<br>
oxygen concentration. . . Transition is complete once the primary recycle damper 20A is<br>
fully opened and the PA fan fresh air damper 19A is closed. In a preferred embodiment<br>
the transition occurs at a rate between about 2 and about 4 percent full load per minute,<br>
and more preferably at about 3 percent full load per minute.<br>
[0057] During this step of oxygenating the primary recycled flue gas the oxygen<br>
concentration is monitored downstream of the primary oxygen mixer 5. Introduction of<br>
oxygen into the primary oxygen mixer 5 is then adjusted to maintain between about 16<br>
and about 23.5 percent oxygen. In a preferred embodiment the oxygen concentration is<br>
maintained between about 17 and about 20 percent. In embodiments where primary<br>
 <br>
and secondary oxygen mixer 5, 11 operate in series, introduction of oxygen into the<br>
secondary oxygen mixer 11 is concurrently adjusted to maintain the desired levels of<br>
oxygen in the secondary oxygenated recycled flue gas. Once transition is complete,<br>
tight shut of damper 18A is closed to prevent air infiltration.<br>
[0058] Once transition has occurred, boiler load may be adjusted to full or an otherwise<br>
desired less than full load. As load is adjusted, coal flow and oxygen flow are preferably<br>
adjusted separately, such that adjustments in oxygen flow lead adjustments in fuel flow<br>
on load increases and lag the fuel flow on load decreases.<br>
[0059] While the boiler firing rate controls the total oxygen and flue gas recycle flow<br>
demands, in an alternative embodiment, the oxygen/recycle gas flow ratio may be used<br>
to trim (increase or decrease) furnace absorption for steam temperature control.<br>
[0060] In the above embodiment transition to the secondary oxygenated recycled flue<br>
gas is completed first, subsequently followed by the transition to the primary oxygenated<br>
recycled flue gas. Depending on what is most expedient in a specific plant configuration,<br>
in an alternative embodiment the order in which the transitions occur could be reversed<br>
or the transitions may occur in parallel, either simultaneously or one lagging the other.<br>
[0061] In another alternative embodiment, igniters may be used to support combustion<br>
until the transition is complete.<br>
 <br>
[0062] A boiler arrangement of the present invention is shown schematically in Fig 1.<br>
During oxy-combustion transition and operation, oxygen is provided to the primary<br>
oxygen mixer 5 though oxygen inlet 6, and to the secondary oxygen inlet through<br>
secondary oxygen inlet 12. Additional oxygen 17 may also be provided directly to the<br>
burner 14 via an oxygen lance 15.<br>
[0063] Prior to reaching the burner, both the primary oxygenated recycled flue gas<br>
stream and the secondary oxygenated recycled flue gas stream are optionally<br>
preheated via air heater 2. The primary oxygenated recycled flue gas stream then<br>
proceed to the pulverizer 13, and the secondary oxygenated recycled flue gas stream<br>
proceed to the windbox 16.<br>
[0064] Oxy-combustion occurs in the boiler 1, wherein optional levels fuel and oxidant<br>
provided to the burner are combusted to produce a C02 rich flue gas. The resulting flue<br>
gas exits the boiler, enters the air heater 2, and is subsequently undergoes post<br>
combustion pollutant cleansing measures 3 (i.e. S02, particulate, and moisture<br>
removal).<br>
[0065] Once cleansed the stream of oxy-combustion flue gas is split into a flue gas<br>
recycle stream and a C02 purification and compression stream. The flue gas recycle<br>
stream proceeds to the primary oxygen mixer 5 to be enhanced with oxygen from<br>
primary oxygen inlet 6. The C02 compression stream proceeds to a CPU 4 for<br>
processing. Prior to transition the non-recycled flow gas flow will exit at the stack 22.<br>
 <br>
Stack clamper 21 regulates flue gas flow to the stack 22. During transition stack damper<br>
21 begin to shut, reduced flow to the stack 22, and increasing flow to the CPU 4 When<br>
damper 21 is full closed transition from venting flue gas to capturing C02 capture is<br>
complete.<br>
[0066] In an alternative embodiment, the methodology of the present invention may<br>
also be applied to transitioning from oxy-combustion firing to air firing. The transition<br>
back to air firing is essentially the reverse of transitioning from air to oxy-combustion.<br>
[0067] In a first step, the boiler load is reduced to transition load and the CPU 4 is<br>
removed from service and flow through the stack is re-established. The primary<br>
recycled flue gas stream is then transitioned to air by first opening tight shut off damper<br>
18A then slowly opening control damper 19A while concurrently closing recycle damper<br>
20A. The secondary recycled flue gas stream is then transitioned to air by first opening<br>
tight shut off damper 18B then slowly opening control damper 19B while concurrently<br>
closing 20B. During this process the oxygen added is regulated as necessary to<br>
maintain a desired concentration in the oxygenated recycle gas. Once transition is<br>
complete all oxidant necessary for combustion is supplied from the fresh air intakes 8, 9<br>
and the oxygen supply mean can be taken off line.<br>
[0068] While the specific embodiments of the invention have been shown and described<br>
in detail to illustrate the application of the principles of the invention, it will be<br>
 <br>
understood that the invention may be embodied otherwise as appreciated by one of<br>
ordinary skill in the art without departing from the scope of the present invention<br>
