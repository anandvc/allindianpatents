				<td>RECQNNECTION OF DROPPED CALL<br>
IN MOBILE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to the field of wireless<br>
communication, and more particularly, to a method of reconnecting a dropped<br>
call in a mobile communication system.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
In a public land mobile network (PLMN), a connection is made between a<br>
base station (BS) and a mobile station (MS) in a radio environment. In some<br>
cases, call service cannot be provided in shadow areas due to physical<br>
characteristics of the radio environment which adversely affect signal<br>
propagation. In the case where a terminal subscriber roams on foot or is moving<br>
in a vehicle, a call can be temporarily dropped. In accordance with<br>
conventional technology, if a call drop lasts for a predetermined time period, it is<br>
determined that a call service cannot be provided and the call is released. In<br>
IS-95, the predetermined time is approximately 5 seconds (i.e., equal to one<br>
frame duration 20ms x 270). Upon this unintended call release, a calling party<br>
should resume the attempt to call to a called party.<br><br>
To overcome the aforestated problem of call drops, several approaches<br>
have been suggested in the prior art, including:<br>
(1)	U.S. Patent No. 5,546,382: reconnection of a circuit to continuously<br>
provide a data communication service upon generation of a transmission failure;<br>
(2)	U.S. Patent No. 5,239,571: reconnection of an abnormally terminated<br>
communication line by adding a separate device to a terminal or modifying the<br>
terminal. That is, with the aid of a RAM in the terminal for storing information<br>
on call origination and call termination, a call is automatically set up in the case<br>
of an abnormal disconnection of a call; and<br>
(3)	U.S. Patent No. 5,566,236: reconnection of a disconnected telephone<br>
communication by use of a nearby telecommunication system (e.g., PBX:<br>
Private Branch Exchange and Centrex: Centralized PBX Service) with the<br>
concept of an intelligent network introduced.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a method of<br>
automatically reconnecting a dropped call which is while a call service is being<br>
provided in a mobile communication system.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a method of<br>
automatically reconnecting a dropped call while a call service is being provided<br>
in a mobile communication system.<br>
A further object of the present invention to provide a method of manually<br>
reconnecting a dropped call which is while a call service is being provided in a<br>
mobile communication system.<br><br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a method of<br>
reconnecting a dropped call upon detection of the call drop by a mobile station.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a method of<br>
reconnecting a dropped call upon detection of the call drop by a system (i.e.,<br>
base station (BS) or mobile switching center (MSC)).<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a method of<br>
reconnecting a call dropped due to an abnormality of bidirectional traffic<br>
channels for communication between a mobile station (MS) and a system, upon<br>
detection of the call drop by both the MS and the system.<br>
A still further object of the present invention is to provide a method of<br>
reconnecting a dropped call when a mobile station (MS) detects the call drop and<br>
requests a location registration.<br>
Briefly, these and other objects are accomplished by a method of<br>
reconnecting a communication link terminated by a service impediment during a<br>
service between an MS subscriber and its counterpart subscriber communicating<br>
with the MS subscriber through a mobile communication system having a<br>
plurality of MSCs connected to one another, each MSC being connected to a<br>
plurality of base stations Bss. When the service impediment lasts for at least a<br>
predetermined first time period, the MS subscriber sends a reconnection request<br>
signal. Then, the service is reinitiated between the MS subscriber and its<br>
counterpart subscriber through one of the plurality of BSs and one of MSCs<br>
connected to the BS in response to the reconnection request signal.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail<br>
with reference to the attached drawings. Like reference numerals denote the<br>
same components in the drawings. It is to be noted that a detailed description<br>
of the known structure and function of the present invention will be omitted if it<br>
is deemed to obscure the subject matter of the present invention.<br>
Terms and Definitions<br>
Oa call service in progressO : a state where voice communication and data<br>
communication of still images, moving pictures, and the like are being<br>
performed.<br>
"dropped callO: is defined as a call provided in a call service which can no<br>
longer be maintained either temporarily or permanently. A dropped call may<br>
be caused by either a call disconnection, noise channel on a specific channel, or<br>
non-serviceability.<br>
"call disconnection" : is the state where a call remains disconnected for a<br><br>
predetermined time.<br>
The embodiments of the present invention will be described with in the<br>
context of the North American digital mobile communication system standard<br>
(IS-95, IS-634, and IS-41 series) by way of example. The present invention is<br>
also applicable to 3G IS-95 which provides the additional services of high<br>
quality voice, high speed data, moving pictures, and Internet browsing.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, the mobile communication system to which the<br>
present invention is applied includes an HLR (Home Location Register) 80,<br>
MSCs (Mobile Switching Centers) MSCO 70a and MSC1 70b, BSCs (Base<br>
Station Controllers) BSC00 64a, BSC01 64b, and BSC10 64c, BTSs (Base<br>
Station Transceiver Subsystems) BST000 62a to BTS101 62f, and an MS 50.<br>
A plurality of HLRs and MSCs are interconnnected in the PLMN to perform<br>
subscriber management and call switching. As shown in FIG. 1, the single<br>
HLR 80 is connected to a plurality of MSCs, MSCO 70a and MSC1 70b. Each<br>
MSC is in turn connected to a plurality of BSCs, and each BSC to a plurality of<br>
BTSs. A BS is typically comprised of a BSC and BTSs.<br>
An MSC controls a connection to the PSTN (Public Switch Telephone<br>
Network) and the PLMN, (public land mobile network). A BSC controls a<br>
radio link and performs a handoff, a BTS forms a radio link with an MS and<br>
manages radio resources, and an HLR registers subscriber locations and serves<br>
as a database for storing subscriber information. Each MSC has a VLR (Visitor<br>
Location Register) for temporarily storing the information of an MS entering the<br>
service area of the MSC. If the MS moves into another service area, the stored<br>
information is discarded.<br><br>
For a call set-up, the mobile communication system assigns radio<br>
channels between an MS and a BTS, forms communication links between the<br>
BTS and a BSC, between the BSC and an MSC, and between the MSC and the<br>
PLMN or an external network such as PSTN. If the established call cannot be<br>
maintained for a predetermined time because the MS is in a shadow area or due<br>
to characteristics of the radio environment, the mobile communication system<br>
typically disconnects the call. Shadow area problems may arise from a number<br>
of situations including, for example, an elevator, a relay-free tunnel, a long<br>
tunnel located between adjacent cells, a shadow area among dense tall buildings.<br>
A call drop as defined in the embodiments of the present invention can<br>
occur in such locations as indicated by reference numerals 10, 12, 14, and 16 in<br>
FIG. 1.<br>
Reference numerals 10, 12, and 14 indicate locations of a dropped call<br>
within the same MSC area, and reference numeral 16 indicates a location of a<br>
dropped call between BTSs covered by different MSCs. Specifically, reference<br>
numeral 10 denotes a call dropped location of the MS 50 communicating with<br>
the BTS000 62a within the coverage area of the BTS000 62a, reference numeral<br>
12 denotes a call dropped location of the MS 50 communicating with the<br>
BTS000 62a or the BTS001 62b in the service area of the BSC00 64a, and<br>
reference numeral 14 denotes a call dropped location of the MS 50<br>
communicating with the BTS001 62b or the BTS010 62c on the border of their<br>
coverage areas.<br>
A BS and an MSC of FIG. 1 controls the reconnection of a dropped call,<br>
possibly using the same algorithm.<br><br>
A dropped call reconnecting function can be provided in two ways: (a) a<br>
system applies the function indiscriminately to all MSs by modifying their<br>
operations; and (b) the function is provided on an individual basis to each MS as<br>
an additional service. The former method is viable if all the subscriber<br>
terminals are similarly configured to implement the dropped call reconnecting<br>
function. The latter method allows a flexible application of the reconnection<br>
function, and only subscribers requiring the service need modify their<br>
terminals.<br>
In the embodiments of the present invention, either existing signals are<br>
modified or new signals are used. Existing call release signals including a Release<br>
signalD communicated between a BS and an MSC and a "Release Order signal" which<br>
is communicated between an MS and a BS, can be used or added with a new function.<br>
If a call drop can be detected from the call release signals, they can be used.<br>
Otherwise, a parameter as shown in FIG. 2 is added to them to separately indicate a<br>
normal call release signal or a dropped call-caused call release signal.<br>
In FIG. 2, a parameter RELEASESTAT, indicating release status is added to a<br>
call release signal for discriminating normal call release signal from a call release<br>
signal due to a dropped call. The parameter occupies one bit. If the bit is zero, it<br>
indicates a normal call release signal. If the bit is one, it indicates a call release signal<br>
due to a dropped call.<br>
A typical protocol for using the existing signals "Release" and "Release Order"<br>
is shown, by way of example, in FIG. 6 which illustrates the signal flow for releasing<br>
an MS originated call based on the IS-634 standard. Reference numeral 20 denotes<br>
the signals "Release" and "Release Order". Alternatively, the parameter<br>
RELEASESTAT can be added to a signal "Clear" to achieve the same objective. As<br><br>
an additional alternative solution, a new signal can be used.<br>
To obtain information to be used for a connection to an established call on a<br>
temporary hold, a conventional reconnection request signal "Reconnection" directed<br>
from an MS to a BS, from a BS to an MSC, from an MSC to a VLR, and from an MSC<br>
to another MSC can be used or modified. When directed from an MS to a BS or<br>
from a BS to an MSC, messages used for an orgination call use an additional<br>
parameter, OLD_BS_ID, shown in FIG. 3 as information to be used to make a<br>
connection to an established call on a temporary hold. This parameter includes 16<br>
bits and can be generated by modifying an existing origination message and a set-up<br>
signal.<br>
FIG. 7 illustrates the procedure for an MS originated call proceeding. In FIG.<br>
7, reference numeral 30 denotes signals "Origination Order" and "Setup" added with<br>
the parameter OLDBSID.<br>
To indicate whether a dropped call reconnection function is provided as an<br>
additional service to each MS. As previously described, a parameter DCAR FLAG,<br>
as shown in FIG. 4 is added to data in the HLR 80, and VLRO 72a &amp; VLR1 72b of<br>
FIG. 1. This parameter is one bit. If the bit is zero, it indicates a deactivation state<br>
(0=DACT) and if the bit is one, it indicates an activation state (l=ACT).<br>
A parameter WATINGFLAG, shown in FIG. 5 for discriminating a normal<br>
call release signal from a dropped call-caused call release signal is added to the<br>
subscriber data in VLRO 72a and VLR1 72b of FIG. 1. This parameter is one bit. If<br>
the bit is zero, it indicates a normal call release state (0=NORMAL), and if the bit is<br>
one, it indicates a call drop release state (l=DROP). The initial value of the parameter<br>
is zero.<br><br>
Drop Call Detection<br>
A dropped call is recognized in the following ways according to the<br>
embodiments of the present invention:<br>
First Embodiment: Detection by an MS<br>
Detection of dropped call information by MS: an MS detects the drop of a call<br>
in progress due to an abnormality of a traffic channel directed from the system to the<br>
MS. For example, the MS would store information on a call drop generating location,<br>
and if the MS transits to a normal state, it then notifies the system of the call drop.<br>
That is, the MS notifies the BS and MSC.<br>
Second Embodiment: Detection by a System<br>
Detection of dropped call by system: in this case, the system can determine<br>
whether a call in progress drops or not. The call drop is caused by an abnormality of<br>
a traffic channel directed from an MS to the system. The system sends a<br>
reconnection request for the MS to perform a reconnection function, or forces the<br>
reconnection function to be implemented.<br>
Third Embodiment: [PLEASE PROVIDE DESCRIPTION]<br>
Abnormality of bidirectional traffic channels between MS and system.<br>
Fourth Embodiment:<br>
Location registration request from MS: after a call is dropped, an MS transits to<br>
a normal state without information on a call drop-caused location, reserves information<br>
different from existing parameters, and requests a location registration to the system<br>
due to the call drop. Upon generation of a call drop in this situation, the MS is<br>
normally initialized and registers its location. If the updated value of the parameter<br>
WAITINGFLAG in a VLR is one, the previously established call is reconnected.<br><br>
The location registration is the process by which an MS notifies a BTS of its location,<br>
status, identification, slot cycle, and other characteristics.<br>
Drop Call Processing<br>
Processing a dropped call varies depending upon how the dropped call is<br>
detected. Prior to describing dropped call processing according to the previously<br>
described four detection methods, dropped call processing performed by an MS, a BS,<br>
and an MSC alone or in combination will be described comprehensively referring to<br>
FIGs. 1 and 8.<br>
In FIG. 8, a call is set up in step 100 and proceeds in step 101. An MS or a BS<br>
determines in step 102 whether there is a manual reconnection request from an MS<br>
subscriber during the call. The MS subscriber can manually request a call<br>
reconnection by pressing a manual reconnection request keywhen serious noise is<br>
generated in voice or images, or the voice is mute during the call. The manual<br>
reconnection request key can be added to a key pad of the terminal, or may be<br>
provided using an existing function key, or constructed by a combination of existing<br>
digit keys.<br>
In the absence of the manual reconnection request from an MS subscriber, it is<br>
determined whether frames are being continuously received on a current traffic<br>
channel, in step 104. Upon receipt of a frame, it is determined whether the received<br>
frame has an error, in step 105. If no errors exist in the frame, a counter for counting<br>
unreceived or bad frames (hereinafter, referred to as a non-reception counter) is<br>
cleared in step 106. If the frame has an error in step 105, a non-reception count is<br>
incremented in step 108. Then, it is determined whether the non-reception count is<br>
equal to or greater than a predetermined time TimerVall, in step 110. The<br>
predetermined time TimerVall varies depending upon a system operation state and<br><br>
whether a frame is received at each 20ms interrupt.<br>
If 20 consecutive bad frames are received from the CMDB 1040, the TSB 1060<br>
considers it to be predictive of a call drop. Then, if a predetermined number of<br>
consecutive bad frames are received for a first predetermined time, the TSB 1060<br>
determines that the call is dropped. Assuming that the first predetermined time is 2<br>
seconds, for example, the TSB 1060 declares a call drop if it receives 80 consecutive<br>
bad frames. However, if two consecutive normal frames are received, the<br>
non-reception counter is initialized and the TSB 1060 returns to a normal operation.<br>
On the other hand, if 20 consecutive frames are not received, the TSB 1060 considers<br>
it to be predictive of a call drop. Then, if no consecutive frames are received for a<br>
second predetermined time, the TSB 1060 determines that the call in progress is<br>
dropped. The second predetermined time is preferably shorter than the first<br>
predetermined time.<br>
MS Detection of Call Drop<br>
Now, an MS detection of a call drop will be described. An MS monitors a<br>
forward traffic channel on the traffic channel state. When the MS receives L<br>
consecutive bad frames on the forward traffic channel, it disables its transmitter.<br>
Then, if M consecutive good frames are received, the MS enables the transmitter.<br>
The MS activates a fade timer for the forward traffic channel when the transmitter is<br>
enabled, in a traffic channel initialization substate of the MS control on the traffic<br>
channel state. The fade timer is reset to N seconds when M consecutive good frames<br>
are received. When no consecutive good frames are received during the fade timer<br>
sequence, the MS disables the transmitter and declares a call drop.<br>
Returning to FIG. 8, if the MS and/or the BS detects a call drop in steps 104 and<br>
106, it holds the current call in step 112 while the radio links between the MS and the<br><br>
subscriber characteristics, ranging from zero to ten seconds, preferably 1.2 seconds, to<br>
determine whether a call is dropped or not. The time of 1.2 seconds is about 5<br>
seconds shorter than the release time for a call in the prior art. The value TimerVall<br>
is registered as system initialization data and may be changed by an operator. When<br>
the dropped call reconnection function is uniformly registered for all MSs, the value<br>
TimerVall is set as a predetermined value commonly applied each MS. On the<br>
other hand, if the function is provided individually for each MS, the value TimerVall<br>
is unique to each MS.<br>
The ways an MS and a BS detect a call drop will be described in more detail.<br>
BS Detection of a Call Drop<br>
FIG. 15 is a block diagram of the BS for detecting a call drop. Referring to<br>
FIG. 15, a CDMA signal received through an antenna 1000 is converted to an IF<br>
(Intermediate Frequency) signal by an RF &amp; XCVB (Radio Frequency &amp; Transceiver<br>
Block) 1020. A CMDB (CDMA Modulation and Demodulation Block) 1040<br>
converts the IF signal to a QCELP (Qualcomm Code Excited Linear Predictive<br>
coding) packet. During this operation, the CMDB 1040 determines whether a packet<br>
frame is normal or abnormal by checking its CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Code), and if<br>
abnormal it adds the abnormality indicating information (Quality Matrix: HNOO-HNff)<br>
to the converted packet. If the abnormality indicating information is zero, a TSB<br>
1060 subjects the packet frame received from the CMDB 1040 to an abnormality<br>
operation. If it is one, the TSB 1060 converts the received packet frame to a PCM<br>
(Pulse Code Modulation) signal and sends the PCM signal to an MSC.<br>
Upon a determination that the packet frame as bad, the TSB 1060 counts<br>
continuous errors and unreceived frames using a timer interrupt generated every 20ms<br>
to make a final decision wether a call is dropped or not. That is, it is determined<br><br>
BS, between the BS and an MSC, and between the MSC and the PSTN (or another<br>
MSC) are still maintained. When necessary, the radio links between the MS and the<br>
BS and between the BS and the MSC can be released. In step 114, an information<br>
message notifying a wait for a reconnection is sent to the other subscriber or a service<br>
provider. The information message takes the form of voice message, music, tone, or<br>
mute for the other telephone subscriber. The message takes the form of null data for<br>
a data communication subscriber and a data service provider.<br>
In step 116, a timer is set for a predetermined time Timer_Val2. When a<br>
reconnection waiting state is entered in step 118, the timer is activated in step 120. It<br>
is determined in step 122 whether there is a reconnection request or a location<br>
registration request is issued from the MS or the system (BS or MSC) before the timer<br>
expires. The timer value Timer_Val2 varies depending upon a system operating state<br>
and subscriber characteristics, ranging from several tens of seconds to several<br>
hundreds of seconds (e.g., 10-180 seconds) to determine the action time of call<br>
releasing. Timer_Val2 is preferably 30 to 60 seconds. When the dropped call<br>
reconnection function is uniformly registered for all MSes, the value Timer_Val2 is set<br>
as a predetermined value commonly applied to the MSes. On the other hand, if the<br>
function is provided individually for each MS, the value Timer_Val2 varies for each<br>
MS.<br>
Upon request of a call reconnection or location registration within the value<br>
Timer_Val2 in step 122, the timer is deactivated in step 124. In step 126, the<br>
established call is released from the hold stated and reconnected on a traffic channel<br>
suitable for a new location of the MS. The information message is withdrawn in step<br>
128. Thus, the MS can continue communication with the other subscriber or the<br>
service provider in the existing call service. However, if no reconnection request is<br>
issued within the value Timer_Val2, an information message notifying a call drop is<br><br>
sent to the other subscriber or the service provider in step 130, and the call is released<br>
instep 132.<br>
Now, a description of a dropped callprocessing according to the four<br>
embodiments for drop call detection, previously described, will be given hereinbelow<br>
referring to FIGs. 1 and FIGs. 8 to 12.<br>
Prior to the description, it should be noted that in the same MSC/VLR area and<br>
in a different MSC/VLR area as shown in FIGs. 9 to 12 respectively, indicate that the<br>
MS is located in the same MSC/VLR area at the time when a call is dropped and a<br>
reconnection request and a location registration request are issued, and that the MS is<br>
located in a different MSC/VLR areas at the time when a call is dropped and a<br>
reconnection request and a location registration request are issued.<br>
First Embodiment: Call Drop Processing for a Drop Call Detected by an MS<br>
FIG. 9 is a flowchart of processing a dropped call when the MS detects the call<br>
drop. This situation occurs due to an abnormal traffic channel directed from the<br>
system to the MS.<br>
Referring to FIGs. 1 and 9, when an MS subscriber presses a reconnection<br>
request key during a call in step 200, the MS perceives the reconnection request in step<br>
201 and is initialized in step 204. If a call is dropped due to non-reception of frames<br>
during the call in step 200, it is determined whether the call drop state lasts as long as<br>
or longer than the predetermined time Timer_Vall in step 202. If it does, the MS is<br>
initialized in step 204. Here, step 204 can be omitted.<br>
Then, if the call drop is overcome, for example, due to a change in the location<br><br>
of the MS, the MS sends a reconnection request signal "ReconnectD having the<br>
parameter OLD_S_ID shown in FIG. 3, to its serving BS in step 206. The serving ,<br>
BS sends the signal "Reconnect" to a corresponding MSC in step 208. In step 210,<br>
the MSC sends a signal "ReconnectAck" back to the serving BS and in step 212, the<br>
BS sends the signal "ReconnectAck" back to the MS.<br>
In step 213, the MSC determines whether the call reconnection function is<br>
uniformly registered for all MSs or as an additional service for an individual MS. If<br>
it is individually provided as an additional service, the MSC further determines<br>
whether the reconnection function is registered to be implemented for the MS<br>
requiring the call reconnection by analyzing the parameter DCAR FLAG stored in its<br>
VLR. If the call reconnection function is not registered, a call release operation is<br>
performed in step 234. If the call reconnection function is registered, the MSC<br>
determines whether the parameter OLD BSID of the received signal "Reconnect"<br>
indicates whether the MS is within the service area of the MSC, in step 214. If it<br>
does indicate the serving BS, the MSC sends an information message notifying a<br>
reconnection waiting to the other subscriber or the service provider, in step 216. For<br>
example, a call in progress is dropped when the MS 50 is within the coverage area of<br>
BTS000 62a, and the MS 50 moves into the area of BTS001 62b and requests a call<br>
reconnection. Then, MSC0 70a recognizes that the MS 50 is within its service area<br>
and sends the information message notifying "a reconnection waiting" to the other<br>
subscriber or the service provider.<br>
If the MS is not within the service area of the MSC in step 214, the MSC sends<br>
the received signal "Reconnect" to a different MSC in step 218. The new MSC sends<br>
the signal "ReconnectAck" to the previous MSC in step 220, and sends the<br>
information message notifying " reconnection waiting" to the other subscriber or the<br>
service provider. For example, a call in progress is dropped when the MS 50 is<br><br>
within the coverage area of BTS011 62d, and the MS 50 moves into the area of<br>
BTS100 62e and requests a call reconnection. Then, MSCO 70a sends MSC1 70b the<br>
signal "Reconnect" because the MS 50 is beyond its service area and the MSC1 70b<br>
sends the information message notifying a reconnection waiting to the other subscriber<br>
or the service provider.<br>
After step 216 or 222, the MSC releases the existing links and connects an<br>
initiated call according to the current location of the MS in step 224. If the MS is<br>
within the service area of the same MSC, an origination call is set up, and the existing<br>
links are released and the initiated call is connected in the same manner as a hard<br>
handoff between BSes. For example, the MS 50 moves out of the coverage area of<br>
BTS000 62a into that of BTS001 62b and requests a reconnection, the existing links<br>
between the MS 50 and BTS000 62a and between BTS000 62a and BSC00 64a are<br>
released, and links are established between the MS 50 and BTS001 62b and between<br>
BTS001 62b and BSC00 64a. Then, those new links are connected to the other<br>
subscriber or the service provider. On the other hand, If the MS is within the service<br>
area of a different MSC, an origination call is set up, and the existing links are released<br>
and the initiated call is connected in the same manner as a hard handoff between MSCs.<br>
For example, the MS 50 moves out of the coverage area of BTS 100 62e into that of<br>
BTS011 62d and requests a reconnection, the existing links between the MS 50 and<br>
BTS 100 62e, between BTS 100 62e and BSC10 64c, and between BSC10 64c and<br>
MSC1 70b are released, and links are established between the MS 50 and BTS011 62d,<br>
between BTS011 62d and BSC01 64b, between BSC01 64b and MSCO 70a, and<br>
between MSCO 70a and MSC1 70b. Then, those new links are connected to the other<br>
subscriber or the service provider.<br>
In step 226, the MSC withdraws the information message notifying the waiting<br>
for reconnection, and in step 228, determines whether the initiated call is normally<br><br>
connected to the other subscriber or the service provider. If it is normally connected,<br>
the call proceeds in step 230. Otherwise, the MSC sends an information message<br>
notifying a call release to the other subscriber or the service provider in step 232 and<br>
performs a call release operation in step 234.<br>
It is noted from FIG. 9 that the timer set for Time_Val2 in steps 116 and 122 of<br>
FIG. 8 does not operate. This is because the MS issues a reconnection request shortly<br>
after its initialization in steps 204 and 206 and thus the BS need not determine whether<br>
a predetermined time passes after the reconnection request.<br>
Second Embodiment: Call Drop Processing According to Drop Call Detection by<br>
the System (i.e., BS or MSC)<br>
FIG. 10 is a flowchart of processing a dropped call when the system detects the<br>
call drop. This case happens due to an abnormal traffic channel directed from the MS<br>
to the system.<br>
Referring to FIGs. 1 and 10, if a call is dropped due to non-reception of frames<br>
during the call in step 300, the BS determines whether the call drop state lasts as long<br>
as or longer than the predetermined time TimerVal 1 in step 302. If it does, the BS<br>
sends a signal "Release Order" including the parameter RELEASE STAT set to one<br>
(DROP=l) to the MS in step 304 and a signal "Release" including the parameter<br>
RELEASESTAT set to one (DROP=l) to the MSC in step 306. Then, the MSC<br>
sends a signal "Release Complete" to the BS in step 308. In step 309, the MSC<br>
determines whether the call reconnection function is uniformly registered for all MSs<br>
or as an additional service for an individual MS and whether the reconnection<br>
function, if it is individually provided as an additional service, is registered to be<br>
implemented for the MS by analyzing the parameter DCARFLAG stored in its VLR.<br>
If the call reconnection function is not registered regardless of indiscriminate provision<br><br>
or individual provision, a call release operation is performed in step 338. If the call<br>
reconnection function is registered, the MSC sends an information message notifying a<br>
reconnection waiting to the other subscriber or the service provider and activates a<br>
timer by setting the timer for Timer_Val2, in step 310.<br>
In step 311, the MS, which received the signal "Release Order" having the<br>
parameter RELEASESTAT set to one (DROP=l) from its serving MSC or a different<br>
MSC, is initialized. This step can be omitted because the MS can change the used<br>
traffic channel to a new traffic channel without its initialzation. After step 311, if the<br>
call drop is overcome due to a variation in the location of the MS, the MS sends a<br>
signal "Reconnect" having the parameter OLD BS ID to the BS, in step 312. The<br>
BS sends the signal "Reconnect" to the MSC in step 314. The MSC determines in<br>
step 316 whether the parameter OLDBSID represents the ID of a BS within its<br>
service area. If it does, the MSC sends a signal "ReconnectAck" to the BS in step<br>
322, and the BS sends the signal "ReconnectAck" to the MS in step 324.<br>
If the parameter does not represent a BS covered by the MSC in step 316, the<br>
MSC sends the received signal "Reconnect" to a corresponding MSC in step 318.<br>
The new MSC sends the signal "ReconnectAck" to the old MSC in step 320. Then,<br>
the old MSC sends the BS the signal "ReconnectAck" in step 322, and the BS sends<br>
the MS the signal "ReconnectAck" in step 324.<br>
In step 326, the MSC releases the existing links and connects an initiated call.<br>
If the MS is within the service area of the same MSC, an origination call is set up, and<br>
the existing links are released and the initiated call is connected in the same manner as<br>
a hard handoff between BSs. On the other hand, If the MS is within the service area<br>
of a different MSC, an origination call is set up, and the existing links are released and<br>
the initiated call is connected in the same manner as a hard handoff between MSCs.<br><br>
In step 328, the MSC withdraws the information message notifying a wait for<br>
reconnection, and in step 330, determines whether the initiated call is normally<br>
connected to the other subscriber or the service provider. If it is normally connected,<br>
the call proceeds in step 332. Otherwise, the MSC sends an information message<br>
notifying a call release to the other subscriber or the service provider in step 336 and<br>
performs a call release operation in step 338.<br>
Meanwhile, if the timer set for Timer Val2 (e.g., 30 to 60 seconds) has expired<br>
without receiving the reconnection request signal "Reconnect" from the MS in step<br>
334, the MSC sends an information message notifying a call release to the other<br>
subscriber or the service provider in step 336 and performs a call release operation in<br>
step 338.<br>
While the BS sends the signal "Reconnect Order" of DROP-1 to the MS in FIG.<br>
10, the signal "Reconnect Order" can be replaced by a signal "Reconnect". In this<br>
case, steps 310, 312, and 324 can be omitted.<br>
Third Embodiment: Call Drop Processing According to Drop Call Detection By<br>
MS and System Due<br>
FIG. 11 is a flowchart of processing a dropped call caused by bidirectional<br>
abnormal traffic channels between the MS and the system.<br>
Referring to FIGs. 1 and 11, if a call is dropped due to non-reception of frames<br>
during the call in step 400, the BS and the MS determine whether the call drop state<br>
lasts as long as or longer than the predetermined time TimerJVall in steps 401 and<br>
402, respectively.<br><br>
If it does, the BS sends a signal"Release Order" including the parameter<br>
RELEASESTAT set to one (DROP=l) to the MS in step 404 and a signal "Release"<br>
including the parameter RELEASESTAT set to one (DROP=l) to the MSC in step<br>
406. Then, steps 406 and 438 are performed. A description of those steps will be<br>
omitted since they are the same as steps 306 to 338 of FIG. 10.<br>
Fourth Embodiment: Call Drop Processing According to a Location Registration<br>
Request<br>
FIG. 12 is a flowchart of processing a dropped call when the MS detects the call<br>
drop and request a location registration. This case happens an MS transits to a<br>
normal state without information on a call drop-caused location after a call drop,<br>
reserves information different from existing parameters, and requests a location<br>
registration to the system due to the call drop.<br>
Referring to FIGs. 1 and 12, if a call is dropped due to non-reception of frames<br>
during the call in step 500, the MS determines whether the call drop state lasts as long<br>
as or longer than the predetermined time in step 502. If the time duration exceeds<br>
TimerVall, the MS sends a signal "Release Order" including the parameter<br>
RELEASE_STAT set to one (DROP=l) to the BS in step 504 and the BS sends the<br>
signal Release including the parameter RELEASE STAT set to one (DROP=l) to the<br>
MSC in step 506. In step 507, the MSC determines whether the call reconnection<br>
function is uniformly registered for all MSs or as an additional service for an<br>
individual MS and then whether the reconnection function, if it is individually<br>
provided as an additional service, is registered to be implemented for the MS by<br>
analysing the parameter DCAR_FLAG stored in its VLR. If the call reconnection<br>
function is not registered regardless of indiscriminate provision or individual provision,<br>
a call release operation is performed in step 546.<br>
If the call reconnection function is registered, the MSC sends a signal "DROP<br><br>
SET" to its VLR in step 508, and the VLR sets the parameter WAITING FLAG<br>
indicating a normal call release or a dropped call-caused call release to DRP=1 in step<br>
510. Then, the VLR sends the MSC a signal DROP CONF representative of drop<br>
confirmation in step 512.<br>
Meanwhile, the MSC sends an information message notifying a reconnection<br>
waiting to the other subscriber or the service provider and activates a timer by setting<br>
the timer for Timer_Val2, in step 509.<br>
In step 514, the MS, which sent the signal "Release Order" having the<br>
parameter RELEASESTAT set to one (DROP=l) to the BS, is initialized. This step<br>
can be omitted. After step 511, if the call drop is overcome due to a change in the<br>
location of the MS, the MS sends a location registration request signal "Registration<br>
Message" to the BS, in step 516. In response, the BS sends a signal "Location<br>
Updating Request" to the MSC in step 518 and the MSC sends the received signal to<br>
the VLR in step 519. Then, the VLR determines in step 520 whether the MS is<br>
within the service area of the VLR. If it is not, the VLR requests an HLR or another<br>
VLR to determine whether the call proceeds for the MS, in step 522, and receives a<br>
response message for the request in step 524. On the contrary, if the MS is within the<br>
service area of the VLR, the VLR checks the parameter WAITINGFLAG for the<br>
MS, in step 526. If the parameter is set to zero, the VLR performs a general location<br>
registration procedure in step 530. If the parameter is set to one, the VLR sends a<br>
signal "Reconnect" to the MSC in step 528.<br>
In step 531, the MSC releases the existing links and connects an initiated call.<br>
If the MS is within the service area of the same MSC, an origination call is set up, and<br>
the existing links are released and the initiated call is connected in the same manner as<br>
a hard handoff between BSs. On the other hand, If the MS is within the service area<br><br>
of a different MSC, an origination call is set up, and the existing links are released and<br>
the initiated call is connected in the same manner as a hard handoff between MSCs.<br>
In step 532, the MSC sends a signal DROP UNSET to the VLR and in step 534,<br>
the VLR changes the parameter WAITING_FLAG to zero. Then, the VLR sends a<br>
signal DROP CONF to the MSC in step 536. In step 538, the MSC withdraws the<br>
information message notifying the waiting for reconnection, and in step 540,<br>
determines whether the initiated call is normally connected to the other subscriber or<br>
the service provider. If it is normally connected, the call proceeds in step 542.<br>
Otherwise, the MSC sends an information message notifying a call release to the other<br>
subscriber or the service provider in step 544 and performs a call release operation in<br>
step 546.<br>
Meanwhile, if the timer set for Timer_Val2 (e.g., 30 to 60 seconds) has expired<br>
without receiving the reconnection request signal "Reconnect" from the MS in step<br>
543, the MSC sends an information message notifying a call release to the other<br>
subscriber or the service provider in step 544 and performs a call release operation in<br>
step 546.<br>
FIGs. 13 and 14 illustrate call processing state transitions according to both<br>
conventional technology and in the present invention.<br>
As shown in FIG. 13, upon a call release request or a call drop for a<br>
predetermined time, for example, 5 seconds, a call release state is entered in the prior<br>
art. In comparison to the prior art, as shown in FIG. 4, upon a call drop for a first<br>
time (e.g., 1.2 seconds) during a call service, an idle state is entered in the present<br>
invention. Then, if a reconnection request is issued, the idle state transitions to a<br>
conversation state. However, if the call drop occurs a second time (preferably, 30 to<br><br>
60 seconds) in the idle state, a call release state is entered. If a call release is<br>
requested in the conversation or idle state, the call release state is immediately entered.<br>
As described above, the present invention is advantageous in that the<br>
inconvenience of resuming a call temporarily dropped in an elevator or a tunnel<br>
overcome by providing an automatic dropped call reconnecting function in a PLMN.<br>
Therefore, subscribers are relieved of the concerns associated with call drops and call<br>
service quality can be increased.<br>
While the present invention has been described in detail with reference to the<br>
specific embodiments, they are mere exemplary applications. Thus, it is to be clearly<br>
understood that many variations can be made by anyone skilled in the art within the<br>
scope and spirit of the present invention.<br><br>
