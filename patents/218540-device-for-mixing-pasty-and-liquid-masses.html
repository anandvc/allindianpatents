				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a device for mixing<br>
pasty and liquid masses.<br>
Such devices are much used for mixing paint or<br>
inks, for instance for printing companies. The inks are<br>
for instance placed together in measured quantities in a'<br>
container and these inks are subsequently mixed by means<br>
of a mixer to form a homogeneous substance. This ink can<br>
then be used to print an object. When ink must be mixed.<br>
in a following container, the mixer first has to be<br>
cleaned so as to prevent contamination from the<br>
preceding container.<br>
Cleaning devices are known wherein the mixer<br>
is taken out of the container, is then displaced or<br>
rotated in a horizontal plane, whereafter the mixer is<br>
carried into a washing space and there cleaned by means<br>
of a cleaning liquid.<br>
Such a cleaning device has the drawback that<br>
it takes up a great deal of space and that the movement<br>
of the mixer takes up much time, whereby the throughput<br>
speed of such a mixing device is low.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a<br>
mixing device wherein cleaning can be performed more<br>
rapidly and wherein in addition little space is taken up<br>
by the mixing device.<br>
This objective is achieved according to the<br>
invention with a device for mixing pasty and liquid<br>
masses, which device comprises:<br>
- a substantially vertically displaceable<br>
mixer having a substantially vertical, driven shaft and<br>
a mixer part arranged on an outer end of the shaft, and<br><br>
WO 2004/080580	PCT/NL2004/000161<br>
2<br>
- a cleaning device for cleaning at least the<br>
mixer part, which cleaning device comprises a washing<br>
space arranged around the vertical shaft and bounded by<br>
walls, wherein spray means are arranged in the washing<br>
space and an access opening is arranged in a lower wall<br>
such that at least the mixer part can be carried into<br>
the washing space. So as to achieve an even better<br>
cleaning, a second scraper can be arranged so that a<br>
double scraper ring results. Further water rinsing can<br>
moreover then be arranged wherein a water flow passes<br>
along the shaft between the two scrapers.<br>
A space-saving is firstly already achieved by<br>
placing the washing space above the mixing device<br>
instead of adjacently thereof. In addition, a horizontal<br>
displacement of the mixer is prevented, whereby a higher<br>
throughput speed is obtained. Because the mixer must be<br>
taken out of the container, the mixer must be displaced<br>
in vertical direction at all times. By now placing the<br>
washing device in the same line as the direction of<br>
removal, i.e. above the container, the mixer can be<br>
carried in one movement out of the container into the<br>
washing space.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the device<br>
according to the invention, the access opening comprises<br>
a standing edge. This prevents for instance cleaning<br>
liquid flowing out on the underside via the access<br>
opening and possibly falling into a container placed<br>
thereunder.<br>
In a further embodiment the device comprises a<br>
closure for closing an access opening. This prevents any<br>
cleaning agent or residue from the mixer dripping out<br>
via the access opening in the lower wall.<br>
In another embodiment of the device according<br>
to the invention, a passage is arranged in an upper wall<br>
of the upper space for passage of the shaft, and a<br><br>
WO 2004/080580	PCT/NL2004/000161<br>
3<br>
scraper is arranged in the passage for scraping the<br>
shaft clean. Adhering dirt is kept inside the washing<br>
space with this scraper and there flushed away.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the device<br>
according to the invention, the washing space is<br>
displaceable in vertical direction. If the mixing device<br>
is used for containers of different dimensions, it may-<br>
be advantageous to always place the washing space at a<br>
minimal distance above the containers. A maximum<br>
throughput speed is hereby achieved.<br>
These and other features of the invention are<br>
further elucidated with reference to the annexed<br>
drawings.<br>
Figure 1 shows in perspective view with partly<br>
broken-away parts an embodiment of the device according<br>
to the invention.<br>
Figure 2 shows the device of figure 1 in a<br>
position where the mixer has been placed in the washing<br>
space.<br>
Figure 3 shows an enlarged view of the washing<br>
space in perspective and with partly broken-away parts.<br>
Figure 1 shows a device 1 according to the<br>
invention. This device 1 has a rear wall 2 on which are<br>
mounted guides 3 on which a bearing block 4 is guided.<br>
This bearing block 4 can be displaced in vertical<br>
direction by means of a pneumatic cylinder 5. Arranged<br>
on this bearing block 4 is a motor 6 which drives a<br>
shaft 7, on the outer end of which is arranged a mixer<br>
part 8.<br>
Mixer S protrudes into a container 9 which is<br>
supplied by means of conveyor belt 10. Shaft 7 of the<br>
mixer protrudes through a washing space 11.<br>
Figure 2 shows the position in which the<br>
bearing block 4 is carried vertically upward along<br>
guides 3, whereby shaft 7 with mixer part 8 thereon is<br><br>
WO 2004/080580	PCT/NL2004/000161<br>
4<br>
likewise carried upward. Mixer part 8 is hereby carried<br>
into washing space 11. The mixer part has herein passed<br>
through the opening 12 in the underside of washing space<br>
11. Opening 12 has a standing edge 13, thus preventing<br>
liquid being able to flow via opening 12 into container<br>
9.<br>
Figure 3 shows washing space 11 in more<br>
detail. Opening 12 is here closed by a closing slide 14.<br>
This is operated by means of a rod assembly 14 and a<br>
cylinder 16. Arranged in washing space 11 are sprayers<br>
17 which clean mixer part 8. Cleaning liquid can then<br>
flow away via outlet 18.<br>
Shaft 7 protrudes to the outside on the top<br>
side of the washing space 11 and is therein enclosed by<br>
a scraper ring 19. This scraper ring 19,scrapes dirt<br>
from shaft 7 so that the dirt remains behind in washing<br>
space 11 and can there be drained off.<br><br>
