A Pump Filtration System Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to filtration systems and particularly to a pump filtration system which can be manually operated.<br>
Background to the Invention<br>
At present in many areas of the developed and underdeveloped parts of the world there is a problem with the quality of water, particularly water for human consumption. Water in many areas is contaminated by a variety of pollutants such as various metals chemicals and bacteria. Examples of pollutants in water include Arsenic, nitrates, fluorides, iron, magnesium, calcium which effects water hardness, giardia and Cryptosporidium. There has long been a need for an inexpensive, simple to operate and maintain filtration system which removes or at least substantially reduces such pollutants in drinking water.<br>
At present there a large number of filtration systems available world wide and they vary in cost and function depending on user requirements and available resources. At present there are very few if any inexpensive, easy to operate and maintain filtration systems with low maintenance and running costs available for use in underdeveloped areas where there is a pressing need for better or good quality water for drinking and. domestic use.<br>
s<br>
Typical filtration systems for drinking water include a number of filters in series with each filter designed to remove particular unwanted and undesirable contaminant or pollutant materials from the water The number and type of filters incorporated in a filtration system depend on the particular problem associated with a particular geographical region. The filters are selected so that the eventual output water is of a potable quality which reaches desired health standards.<br><br>
Typically filtration systems include a cartridge filter and a media tank filter. Cartridge filters have a ceramic cartridge, a polypropylene filter or a pleated paper or cardboard filter selected to suit a user's requirements. Only ceramic cartridge filters are rated to provide an absolute level of filtration. This is understood to be because the other, filters have inherent limitations and depending on the input pressure of water to the filter do allow particles slightly larger than the filters nominal rating to pass through the filter.<br>
The initial capital cost of each filtration system is largely dependent on the number of filters required. Such filtration systems require either their own pump or rely on a reticulation system to provide sufficient pressure to force the water through the filtration system. A problem with many of the known filtration systems is that they are costly to operate and in remote conditions a lack of electric or other power to operate the necessary pumping system means that in many third, world or underdeveloped situations people either have inadequate water or unclean water.^Maintenance of filters is also expensive as many existing filtration system use cartridge filters which can have high operating and replacement costs because of the regular need to<br>
replace the cartridge filters.<br>
Â»<br>
An object of the invention is therefore to provide a pump filtration system which can be manually operated, is relatively inexpensive to operate and maintain and which offers a useful alternative choice.<br>
Further objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following descriptions which are given by way of example only.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a pump filtration system which can be manually operated, the filtration system including a frame adapted to support a preliminary filter, media tank filter and a ceramic or the like filter, the filters being connected in series along with a pump, the arrangement being such that the series of filters are selected to suit user<br><br>
requirements and that the pump is selected so that when it is driven at about 400 rpm it provides a water flow of about 10 to 15 litres a minute at an outlet end of the series of filters.<br>
According to a second aspect of the invention there is provided a method of filtering water using a manually operated pump filtration system, the method including powering by hand or legs a pump adapted to force water under pressure through a preliminary filter, media tank filter and a ceramic or the like filter at a rate of about 10 to 15 litres a minute.<br>
Preferably the pump is driven manually by a user's arms or legs and is preferably an energy efficient gear pump. The gear pump is preferably rated so that a pressure relief valve, if incorporated, operates to release pressure in the pump housing if the pressure is above 100psi. If the optional pressure relief valve is incorporated it can be adjustable to release at any pressure between 20psi and 100psi.<br>
The frame can support in addition to the filters and pump a sub-frame for a pedal or hand driven flywheel connected to drive the pump.<br>
The frame can support a seat for example a bicycle type seat positioned so a user seated on the seat rotates foot pedals.<br>
The preliminary filter can include any suitable filtration medium. For example the preliminary filter can be a cartridge filter rated between 1 and 20 microns with a polypropylene filter or a pleated cartridge filter. If required the preliminary filter can be a media tank filter as described below.<br>
The media tank filter can be any suitable filter for removing heavy metal or other contaminants from water passing through the media tank filter. Preferably the media tank filter is a modified cartridge filter in which the filter casing is adapted to be top hung. The cartridge filter casing is modified so that a boss normally incorporated in the base of the casing is removed so that a riser tube with bottom basket can be fitted with the top of the riser tube<br><br>
located in a sealed arrangement associated with an outlet in the cartridge top of the filter. The riser can be located centrally in the filter casing by upper and lower spacers. At least the upper spacer is such that a filter media can be inserted into the casing before it ;is hung from the cartridge top of the filter supported on the frame. The filter media inserted in the media tank is selected to remove particular contaminants such as fluoride, arsenic, iron or perhaps a media for softening the water.<br>
A slow release iodine filter media can be incorporated either in the cartridge filter media or as a separate cartridge advantageously positioned prior to the ceramic filter. The slow release iodine filter can be formed as an iodide resin.<br>
The ceramic or the like filter is selected to have a throughput of about 10 litres per minute and is rated to remove pollutants and bacteria from the water. Preferably the absolute rating of the ceramic filter is 0,9 microns.<br>
The pump can be a geared rotary pump with sealed bearings. The pump's bearings can be glacial long life bearings.<br>
Further aspects of the invention will become apparent from the following descriptions which are given by way of example.<br>
Description of the Drawings<br>
Examples of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows a side view of a first example of filtration system according to the invention which is pedal powered;<br>
Figure 2 shows a side view of a second example of the present invention which is hand powered;<br><br>
Figure 3 is a side view of a media tank filter which is a modified cartridge filter usable in the present invention;<br>
Figure 4 is a perspective view from above of the media tank filter shown in Figure 3;<br>
Figure 5 is a vertical section through the media tank filter shown in Figures 3 and 4; and<br>
Figure 6 is a perspective sectional view of the media tank filter shown in Figures 4 to 6.<br>
Description of the Preferred Examples<br>
In the first example of the invention shown in Figure 1 the filtration system includes a frame 1 mounted on a set of legs 2, 3 which are arranged to support the parts of the filtration system above ground level indicated by arrow 4. The central member 5 of the frame 1-is adapted to support in series a preliminary filter 6, media tank filter 7 and a ceramic or the like filter 8. The legs 2, 3 are supported in an upright orientation by transverse feet 9t 10 respectively.<br>
The leg 2 has mounted thereon a pump 11. The pump 11 can be a geared rotary pump with sealed bearings. The pump's bearings can be glacial long life bearings. The pump is preferably rated to produce an output up to 100psi. The pump can include a pressure relief valve (not shown) which is adapted to activate at 100psi. The pressure relief valve if included can be manually adjusted so that pressure relief occurs at a preselectedpressure between 20 andlOOpsi,<br>
The preliminary filter 6 can include a cartridge with any suitable filtration medium such as a polypropylene or pleated paper or cardboard cartridge. Depending on the level of filtration required the cartridge can be selected to provide filtration of between 1 to 20 microns.  The preliminary filter removes<br><br>
suspended particles from the water and significantly reduces turbidity in the water, Optionally, depending on the prevailing input water conditions, the preliminary filter can be a second media tank filter of the type described below.<br>
The media tank filter 7 can be any suitable filter for removing heavy metal or<br>
other contaminants from water passing through the media tank. The filter<br>
media in the media tank filter is selected to suit whatever contaminants are to<br>
be removed. For example the media can be selected to remove iron,<br>
fluorides, arsenic or even to soften the water.	<br>
The ceramic or the like filter 8 is selected to have a throughput of about 10 litres per minute and is adapted remove bacteria from the water. Preferably the ceramic filter has an absolute rating of about 0.9 microns. This means that any particle greater in size that 0.9 microns is filtered by the ceramic cartridge from passing through the filter.<br>
The filters are connected in series by pipes or hoses 12 and the pump 11 is connected to the filter 6 by pipe 13 and to a water reticulation system by connection 14. The outlet 15 from the filter 8 can be connected to an outlet connection 16 or direct to a water outlet.<br>
The central member 5 in this example is provided with a connection at 17 for a subframe 18 which supports a stem 19 on which a seat such as a cycle seat 20 is mounted. The subframe 18 is mounted on a transverse foot member 21 which along with the feet 9, 10 provides sufficient stability to the filtration system when a person is seated on the cycle seat 20. The subframe 18 supports a flywheel 22 which is rotated by cranks 23 which have pedals 24 mounted at their distal ends.<br>
The flywheel 22 has a peripheral edge adapted to engage with a drive means connected to drive a shaft of the pump 11. In the example the pump 11 has a drive pulley 25 adapted to be driven by a chain, v-belt or toothed belt 26.<br><br>
Preferably the media tank filter 7 is, as shown in Figures 3 to 6, a modified cartridge filter in which a distributor top 33 for a filter casing 34 is adapted to be top hung from frame 1. The cartridge filter casing 34 is modified so that a<br>
riser tube 35 (shown in Figures 5 and 6) with bottom basket 36 can be fitted<br>
Â»â <br>
with the top 37 of the riser tube 35 located in a sealed arrangement at 38 which is associated with an outlet 39 in the djsjtributojrjtop 33 of the filter. The riser tube 35 can be located centrally in the filter casing by upper and lower spacers 40, 41 respectively. At least the upper spacer 40 is manufactured so that a filter media can be inserted through holes 42 in the spacer 40 and into the casing before it is hung from the distributor top 33 of the filter. The cartridge filter casing is modified at 43 by removing a spigot from the baso of the chamber 44 to provide a locating means for the base of the basket 36 on the base of the riser pipe 35. An advantage of incorporating such a media tank filter is that media can be purchased in bulk and used as required thereby reducing running costs of the filter by not using an expensive cartridge filter.<br>
In use a person sitting on the seat 20 rotates the cranks 23 and their position on the filtration system is stabilised by use of their hands on a handle bar 27 mounted on shaft 28 which extends upward from the subframe 18.<br>
In the second example shown in Figure 2 similar parts to those used in the first example are referenced by the same numerals. In this example the connection at 17 Is provided for a subframe 29. The subframe 29 supports a flywheel 30 which in this example is rotated by hand. The flywheel 30 being driven by handles 31 mounted on cranks 32.<br>
In use the arrangement is such that driving the pump 11 at about 400 rpm provides a water flow of about 10 to 15 litres a minute at an outlet end 16 of the series of filters 6, 7, 8. The flow rate is in part dependent on the rating of the ceramic filter 8 which creates the greatest resistance to water flow through the filtration system.<br><br>
The preliminary filter 6 is selected to remove particles have a size of larger than between 1 and 20 microns depending on the cartridge selected. The media filter is adapted to remove contaminents such as heavy metals. The ceramic filter is adapted to remove bacteria and preferably has an absolute rating of 0.9 microns.<br>
Thus by the invention there is provided a method and apparatus for filtering water using a manually operated pump filtration system,, the method including powering by hand or legs a pump adapted to force water under pressure through a preliminary filter, media tank filter and a ceramic or the like filter at a rate of about 10 to 15 litres a minute.<br>
