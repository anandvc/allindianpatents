FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to a stereoselective method for the preparation of substituted diarylethene of the general formula (I), and more particularly relates to the preparation of tris-0-substituted-(E)-l-(3,5-dihyd^oxyphenyl)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethene which is a key intermediate in the synthesis of trans-resveratrol (I, R -R =R =H). The invention also provides a method for the exclusive synthesis of trans-isomer of compounds of formula (I) without any contamination of cis-isomer.<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Polyhydroxylated trans-stilbenes, the natural products, have been found to exhibit interesting biological activities. Trans-resveratrol has been found to raise the level of high-density lipoproteins (HDL) and lower the level of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) in human beings thereby reducing the risk of clogging arteries and consequent myocardial infarctions (Toppo, F. US 6,048.903). Many 5-alkenyl resorcinols show antileukemic activity (Alonso, E; Ramon, D. J; Yus, M. J. Org. Chem. 1997, 62, 417-421; Thakkar, K; Geahlen, R. L.; Cushman, M. J. Med. Chem. 1993, 36(20}, 2950-2955) and anti-tumor properties (He, K.; Zheng, Q.Y.; Zheng, B. L.; Kim, C. H. WO 2000/037021). Plant material containing trans-resveratrol has been used as a herbal medicine for the treatment of hyperliupemia and liver diseases in China and Japan for many centuries (Kimura, K. M. et al. Shoygakugaku Zasshi 1987, 83, 35-58). Further investigations led to identification many important biological functions including inhibition of lypooxygenase activity (Kimma, Y. et al. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1985, 834, 275), inhibition of anaphylactoid (Ragazy et al. Pharmacol. Ref. Commun. 1988, 79, 20) and protection of lipoproteins against oxidative and free radical damage (Frankel E. N. et al. Lancet 1979, i, 1017).<br><br>
It has been reported that piceatannol, a known antileukemic principle in the seeds of Euphorbia lagascae, inhibits the PTK (protein-tyrosine kinase) activities of p40 as well as p56 by binding to the substrate binding sites (Geahlen, R. L.; McLaughlin, J. L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989, 165. 241-245). Thakkar et al. studied a series of hydroxylated trans-stilbenes and reported enhanced activity for inhibition of the lymphoid cell lineage-specific protein-tyrosine kinase p56 which plays an important role in lymphocyte proliferation and immune function.<br>
In view of the vital biological activities of the polyhydroxylated trans-stilbenes, there have been few methods reported for the synthesis of these compounds. For example, trans-resveratrol is synthesized by the Wittig reaction of 3,5-dimethoxybenzyltriphenyl phosphonium salt with p-anisaldehyde in the presence of n-butyl lithium. The mixture of cis-and trans olefins so obtained is demethylated with large amount of boron tribromide to get very low yield of the product (Toppo, F. US 6.048.903). This method suffers from the low yield, low quality and use of expensive and hazardous reagents, which prevents from employing this method on commercial scale. Similar low yields are reported employing condensation of phosphonate esters with aromatic aldehydes followed by demethylation using pyridine hydrochloride (WO 2000/021368). In case of piceatannol, tetramethoxystilbene precursor is synthesized by the Wittig reaction and the methyl groups are then removed by demethylation reaction with pyridine hydrochloride (Drewes, S. E; Fletcher, I. P. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1974, 961-962) or with boron tribromide (Bajaj, R; Gill, M. T.; McLaughlin, J. L. Rev. Latinoamer Quim. 1987,18, 79-80).<br>
Use of trimethylsilyl protecting groups followed by wittig reaction to get the hydroxy-trans-stilbene products has also been reported (Reimann, E. Tetrahedron Lett. 1970, 4051-4053). Yet another route comprising the reaction of 3,5-dihydroxyphenylacetate and 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde in acetic anhydride, decarboxylation of the ensuing 3,3', 4,5'-tetraacetoxystilbene-a-<br><br>
carboxylic acid with copper and quinoline at high temperature, and hydrolysis of the resulting piceatannol tetraacetate with sodium hydroxide is also reported. (Cunningham, J; Haslam, E; Haworth, R. D. J. Chem. Soc. 1963, 2875-2883). All these processes for the preparation of trans-resveratrol are reported to proceed in moderate to low yields.<br>
In those cases where Wittig reactions are employed, the undesired cis-isomers are also formed along with the desired trans-isomers to the extent of 52% (trans 48%) when potassium t-butoxide is employed (Ali, M. A.; Kondo, K; Tsuda,Y. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1992, 40(5). 1130-1136). Similarly, cis isomers are formed to the extent of 45% (trans : 23%) when sodium hydride is used. (Cushman, M; Nagarathnam, D; Gopal D. et al. J. Med. Chem. 1992, 35(12). 2293-2306; Chen, Yi-Ping; Lei, Tong-Kang. Zhongguo Yiyao Gongye Zazhi 2000, 31(7). 334-336.<br>
In another process, 3,5-dimethoxybenzyl trimethylsilyl ether is treated with lithium metal in the presence of p-anisaldehyde to yield, after dehydration, 3,4',5-trimethoxystilbene, a penultimate intermediate which requires excess boron tribromide (Alonso, E; Ramon, D. J.; Yus, M. J. Org. Chem. 1997, 62(2). 417-421). Similar use of excess boron tribromide has been indicated in WO 01/60774.<br>
A wide variety of demethylating reagents such as boron tribromide, boron tribromide-dimethyl sulfide complex, boron trichloride-dimethyl sulfide complex, pyridine hydrochloride with a catalytic amount of quinoline at elevated temperatures, methyl magnesium iodide etc., are employed. In all these cases, demethylation is always incomplete and the yields and quality are disappointing. To purify the product obtained after dealkylation, chromatographic techniques were employed (Thakkar, K; Geahlen, R. L; Cushman, M. J. Med. Chem. 1993, 36(20). 2950-2955).<br><br>
In the synthesis, which involves the Wittig reaction, the mixture of cis-and trans-isomers are separated by column chromatography or irradiated a solution of the mixture to convert cis into trans isomers. The processes involved are commercially and technically difficult to be implemented.<br>
In addition, the main problems in the synthesis of these polyhydroxylated-1,2-diphenylethenes are caused by the instability of this polyphenolic stilbene due to its oxidation, resulting in the formation of unstable radicals and quinones. The final isolation of the product has to therefore be carried out from dark coloured mixture containing multiple components.<br>
Objectives of the Invention :<br>
1.	The objective of the present invention is to develop a commercial method for preparing substituted polyhydroxy-l,2-diphenylethenes, especially substituted	(E)-l-(3,5-dihydroxyphenyl)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethene, with exclusive trans stereo chemistry.<br>
2.	Another objective of the present invention is to overcome the technical difficulties associated with the reported methods and develop a commercial process to manufacture exclusively the trans-isomer.<br>
3.	Yet another objective of the invention is to provide a simple and effective process without using photochemical reaction in the manufacturing process.<br>
4.	Another objective is to avoid the use of expensive and hazardous chemicals (boron tribromide, lithium, lithium aluminum hydride, sodium hydride, triethyl phosphite, phosphorus tribromide, etc.) in the process.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the stereoselective synthesis of substituted   diarylethenes,   more   particularly   tris-0-substituted-(E)-l-(3,5-<br><br>
dihydroxyphenyl)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethene derivatives of the formula (I), wherein those disadvantages, which have plagued this art, are readily obviated.<br><br>
wherein Rj, R2 and R3 are independently represented as H, alkoxyalkyl, allyl, vinyl, silyl, formyl, acyl, arylalkyl or substituted arylalkyl groups, or a combination thereof.<br>
Moreover, the foregoing technique has been found to be markedly attractive, both from commercial point of view, as well as from a stereo selectivity standpoint, and affords an almost exclusive formation of the trans-isomer and is also free from the limitations discussed above.<br>
The subject compounds (I) are eminently well suited as intermediates to manufacture (E)-l-(3,5-dihydroxyphenyl)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethene (I; Ri, R2, R3 = H) for carrying out the process of the invention. Moreover, the preparation of this can be accomplished quite easily and inexpensively.<br>
Accordingly the compounds (I) of the present invention are useful as intermediates for the production of (E)-l-(3,5-dihydroxyphenyl)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethene (I; R], R2, R3 = H) which has broad spectrum biological activity.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention describes a stereoselective process for the preparation of substituted diaryl ethenes and more specifically tris-0-substituted-(E)-l-(3,5-dihydroxyphenyl)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) ethene of formula (I)<br><br><br>
wherein Ri, R2 and R3 are independently represented as H, alkoxyalkyl, allyl, vinyl, silyl, formyl, acyl, arylalkyl or substituted arylalkyl groups, or a combination thereof, the said process comprising the steps of:<br>
a)	treating the compound of formula (III) with a halogenating agent in an<br>
organic solvent under nitrogen at a temperature of-30 to +110°C, for a<br>
period 60-180 minutes,<br><br>
wherein R], R2 and R3 are as defined above,<br>
b)	removing the precipitated by-products of step (a) by filtration to get solution,<br>
c)	evaporating the solution of step (b) to obtain a residue,<br>
d)	dissolving the residue of step (c) in a dry organic solvent,<br>
e)	treating the dry solution of step (d) with an oxidizing agent, at a temperature between -30 to +60°C, for a time period of 15-300 minutes,<br>
f)	quenching the reaction mixture of step (e) with ice, thereby forming an organic layer and aqueous layer,<br>
g)	separating the organic layer of step (f),<br>
h) washing the organic layer of step (g) with water, aqueous alkali carbonate<br>
solution and water, i)   charcoalizing the organic layer of step (h), filtering and removing the<br>
organic solvent under vacuum to obtain compound of general formula (IV),<br><br><br>
j) treating the a-halosulfone compound of formula (IV) of step(i) with a phase transfer catalyst and a base in an organic solvent at a temperature in the range of- 60° to + 110°C (preferably 25°-45°C) for a period of 15 minutes to 480 minutes,<br>
k) adding water to the reaction mixture of step (j), and<br>
1) separating the organic layer from reaction mixture of step (k), charcoalizing, filtering, and evaporating the organic layer to obtain residue,<br>
m) treating the residue of step (1) with alcoholic solvent at a temperature in the range of 25°-32°C for 1-3 hours to obtain exclusively in a stereoselective form substituted poly aryl ethene represented by formula (I).<br>
In another embodiment, the compound of general formula (I), is alternatively prepared by a process comprising steps of oxidizing compound of formula (III) using an oxidizing agent in a medium containing aqueous organic acid at a temperature in the range of-30°C to +60°C for a period of 15 minutes to 300 minutes, followed by quenching the reaction mixture into ice, and performing steps (g) to (1) described above to obtain compound of formula (II), which is further treated with phase transfer catalyst, halogenating reagent and a base in an organic solvent at a temperature in the range of - 60° to + 110°C for a period of 15 minutes to 480 minutes, followed by adopting step (k) to (m) described above to obtain exclusive stereoselective form of tris-0-substituted (E)-l -(3,5-dihydroxyphenyl)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethene represented by formula (I).<br>
The process adopted for the preparation of compound of formula (I) is depicted in a flow chart (Scheme I) as shown below:<br><br><br><br>
The groups, Ri, R2 and R3, which represent a protecting group for the hydroxyl groups in the compounds of the formula (I)-(IV) are arylalkyl, allyl or silyl groups which can be removed selectively without disturbing the double bond and more particularly, the stereochemistry with respect to the double bond. Since the protecting group ultimately is to be cleaved, it is desirable that the protecting group be easily cleaved in an optional step after the preparation of the compound (I). It is further required that the protecting group be stable during the olefination reaction during halogenation and alkali-treatment. In this respect arylalkyl, allyl, vinyl and silyl groups are useful protecting groups. In addition alkoxymethyl, acetyl and formyl groups are the alternate choices.<br>
In an embodiment, the present invention provides the use of 3,4 ,5-tri-O-substituted dibenzyl sulphide as a starting material for the synthesis of tris-0-substituted (E)-l-(3,5-dihydroxyphenyl)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethane and trans-resveratrol.<br>

In a further embodiment, the present invention provides temperature for performing the reaction in the range of-60 to +110°C and preferably between 20°-45°C.<br><br>
In yet another embodiment, the present invention provides the use of organic solvent in carrying out the reaction selected from the group consisting of chloroform, dichloromethane, benzene, toluene, tetrahydrofuran and dioxane.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, base used is selected from the group consisting of alkali metal hydroxide, alkaline earth metal hydroxide, and secondary/tertiary amine organic bases.<br>
In still yet another embodiment, the present invention provides the use of phase transfer catalyst to promote the reaction, preferably lipophilic phase transfer catalyst selected from the group consisting of quaternary ammonium salts and crown ethers.<br>
In still another embodiment, the present invention provides the use of equimolar ratio of halogenating agent and the substrate (Process B).<br>
In still another embodiment, the present invention provides the use of excess halogenating agent to enhance the rate of reaction and quality of the product (Process A).<br>
In still one more embodiment, the present invention provides the relative mole equivalents of the compound (II) and base as in the range of 1:1 to 1:4.<br>
In still another embodiment, the present invention provides the reaction time for completion in the range of 15 minutes to 480 minutes.<br>
