The Electronic Voting machine of the present invention comprises of two parts, i.e. a control unit and a ballot unit, both units being connected by interconnecting cable. The said cable is a protected flat cable, one end of which is permanently attached to the Ballot Unit. The other end is attached to a connector with a hood for connecting it to the Control Unit.<br>
The Control Unit controls the polling process and it consists of four sections:<br>
a. Display Section; b. Candidate Set Section; c. Result Section and, d. Ballot Section. The various sections of the control unit are controlled by the programmed micro controller/micro processor which has a set of instructions/programmes embedded therein. From the block diagram of the said control unit (see Fig. 3), it can be seen that the micro controller is connected to a memory module wherein the number of votes cast are recorded. The memory module has two memory banks and each bank has two non-volatile memory locations. This provision helps to record the vote cast by a voter in "quadruplicate". The micro-controller is embedded with a set of instructions to carry out the various functions. The display interface having a printed circuit board is connected to the micro controller and this display interface helps to display on demand the total number of votes polled at any time during polling, the votes polled for each candidate sequentially and also display the operational and electrical error conditions, if any. The results are displayed in the removable seven-segment display panel provided in the control unit. Control switches represented by reference numeral 5 to 11 are connected to the said micro controller. The said control switches act as the input devices and will send the necessary request to the micro controller, which will process the requests and display the results in the display panel. The functions of the control switches are listed herein under:<br>
ON/OFF Switch: Reference Numeral 5: A toggle switch to turn on/off battery power to Control Unit. The switch is placed in the rear side of the control unit as shown in Fig. 1. Candidate set button: Reference Numeral 6: To set the number of contesting candidates in conjunction with corresponding Ballot Unit (s). This button is placed in the Candidate Set Section of the Control unit.<br>
Clear Button: Reference Numeral 7: To clear all the previously recorded voting data and set all the counts to zero. This is placed in the result section of the control unit.<br><br>
Ballot Button: Reference Numeral 8: This switch is placed in the ballot section of the control unit, to permit the voter to cast a vote. This is similar to the issue of ballot paper in conventional voting.<br>
Total Button: Reference Numeral 9: To display the number of contesting candidates and the total votes polled for each post during poll. This switch is also placed in the ballot section of the control unit.<br>
Close Button: Reference Numeral 10: To close the polling operation after which no further votes are accepted, voting data is frozen.<br>
Result 1 Button: Reference Numeral 11: To display sequentially the total votes polled for each candidate for post 1.<br>
Result 2 Button: Reference Numeral 12: To display sequentially the total votes polled for each candidate for Post 2.<br>
The switches 10, 11 and 12 are placed in the result section of the control unit.<br>
The Candidate Set Section B (Fig.l) houses a Power Pack compartment (15) and a "Cand Set" button (6). This section has a cover (Door III), which opens from left to right. On Opening its cover, by pressing the latch on the left hand side, the two compartments are seen.<br>
The Power Pack compartment is on the left side of the Candidate Set Section and is for fixing the Power Pack. The "Cand Set" button compartment on the right side is covered with a flap "f which opens from left to right and can be sealed by thread seal. In this compartment a red "Cand Set" (6) button is located. The Candidate Set Section can be closed and sealed by thread seal.<br>
The cover (Door II) of the Result Section "C has an elliptical aperture "api" on the left hand side through which the "Close" button (10) is seen. The left portion of the Result Section houses a black "Close" button (10). The right portion is actually an irmer compartment with its own door (Door I).<br>
The door of the inner compartment has two elliptical apertures "ap ii &amp; ap iii" through which buttons (11 &amp; 12) marked "Result F and "Result IF are seen. The inner door can be opened<br><br>
by inserting the thump and a finger through the two apertures above the "Result I and Result IF buttons and then pressing the inner door should be forced open without releasing the latches in the manner described above, to avoid any damage to this most vital compartment. On opening the door of the inner compartment by inserting forefinger, and thumb through the holes which are marked "Result F and "Result IF and pressing the latches and pulling the cover up, there will be seen on its inner side a fi-ame around the two apertures for fixing Green Paper Seal. This will also reveal three sub sections with two yellow buttons marked "Result I " and "Result IF and a white "Clear" button. (Result II button is not used in case of single poll).<br>
In the Ballot Section "D" there are two buttons - a grey "Total" button (9) and a large blue "Ballot" button (8), as can be seen in Fig.l.<br>
The bottom portion of the Control Unit has also a compartment with a cover. This cover is hinged in the bottom and opens swinging downwards, when the latch in the middle is pressed downwards. This has a provision for thread sealing. The cover, when opened will reveal a plug on the left hand side for plugging the Interconnection cable from the Ballot Unit and a "Power" switch in the middle, for switching the EVM ON or OFF . "ON" Lamp<br>
The "ON" Lamp (3) is located at the top left comer of the Display Section. When the Power switch is pushed upwards to the "ON" position, the lamp glows "GREEN" to indicate that the EVM is ready for use.<br>
"BUSY" Lamp<br>
The "Busy" lamp (4) is located at right comer of the Display Section. It glows "RED" when the "Ballot" button is pressed by the polling official to enable the voter to cast his vote. It goes off when the voter has cast his vote. Security Seal Mechanism<br>
•	The control switches are located in three different compartments, which can be sealed by thread and lac. This will prevent the un-authorised operation of these buttons either during of after polling.<br>
•	Security paper seal mechanism for result and clear compartment<br>
•	Thread/lac seal-mechanism.<br><br>
First seal for result and clear compartment.<br>
Second seal for composite "close" button and result and clear compartments.<br>
Third seal for candidate set and battery compartment.<br>
The micro controller is also connected to a buzzer interface having buzzer-1 and buzzer -2 (Ref Fig.3). Buzzer 1 gives an aural indication when a voter exercises his/her franchise and buzzer 2 gives an aural indication while displaying total votes polled for each candidate. For information, the time interval between two ballots is 12seconds and the buzzer starts from only 9.5"^ second to the end of 12seconds in case the voter exercises his franchise within 9 seconds. In other words, the duration of the buzzer is fixed for 2.5seconds only. The micro controller can be optionally connected to a mini control unit (MCU), which can be used for simultaneous poll. It is also used for interfacing with a computer for accessing the voting data. The micro controller is also provided with an interface along with the necessary connector to enable the connection between the Ballot Unit and Control Unit.<br>
The Ballot Unit is that unit of the machine, which the voter operates to exercise his fi-anchise. It consists of a rectangular box. The box, which is as shown in fig.2, has -<br>
a.	Interconnecting Cable - 20 with connector pin 19<br>
b.	Ready Lamp -18<br>
c.	Slide Switch Panel - SL<br>
d.	16 Candidates" Buttons - marked "a"<br>
e.	16 Candidates" Lamps with "arrow" mark and<br>
f	Provision for insertion of Ballot paper containing the SI. Nos, Names and Election<br>
Symbols of contesting candidates under a transparent acrylic sheet (17) (Ballot Paper Screen).<br>
The interconnecting cable (20) is a protected flat cable, one end of which is permanently attached to the Ballot Unit. To its other end is attached the connector with a hood (not shown) for connecting it to the Control Unit.<br><br>
The "Ready Lamp" (18) is on the top left side of the Ballot Unit. This lamp glows GREEN when the "Ballot" button on the Control Unit is pressed by the Presiding Officer to enable the voter to cast his vote. It goes off when the voter has cast his vote.<br>
The Slide Switch Panel "SL" is on the top right side. The Slide Switch inside the Ballot Unit can be operated to set any one of the four positions viz., 1,2,3 or 4. When only one Ballot Unit is to be used, the Switch is to be set to 1. The Position of the switch is indicated through the transparent panel on the unit. If a second Ballot Unit is used, the Switch in that unit is set to position 2 and so on.<br>
The voter records his vote by pressing the Candidate"s button against the name and symbol of the Candidate of his choice. When the Button is pressed, the Lamp arrow mark (Candidate"s lamp) on the left side of that button glows RED and the voter"s choice is recorded.<br>
The Ballot Unit has a provision for inserting on its top face the Ballot Paper in which the SI. Nos, Names and Symbols of the contesting candidates are printed. A transparent acrylic sheet (17) (Ballot Paper Screen) protects the Ballot paper.<br>
The top cover of the Ballot Unit is opened by pressing simultaneously, towards the right, the latches at the top and bottom of the right edge of the Unit. The inside of the Unit is as in fig.2. Sixteen Candidates" buttons are visible, each having an associated masking tab. The buttons that are required to be used should not be covered or masked. The buttons which are not required to be used should be covered or masked with their associated masking tabs.<br>
The housing is a multi part injection molded plastic cabinet with a cover (21). Special sliding mechanisms (not shown in the drawings) are provided for masking the unused Vote Buttons.<br>
The block diagram of the ballot unit is shown in fig 4. As can be seen from fig 4, the electrically programmable logic device is the centre of the Ballot Unit having a set of instructions embedded therein. It includes (i) means for scanning the buttons of those candidate keys which are activated only and (ii) means for decoding the commands from the control unit and execute them accordingly. The same is connected to the visual indicator LEDs 1 to 16 represented by an arrow mark and candidate switches i.e. buttons 1 to 16 generally represented by reference numeral "a" in fig. 2. It is further connected to a slide switch and the necessary coimectors for power supply and for connecting to the control unit.<br><br>
SOFTWARE:<br>
The software is based on the flow chart given in Fig (5). After factory programmed, the system is in clear state with default parameters. Before an election, the input parameter for the election i.e. the number of contesting candidates is set with the candidate set key. The system is ready for use for voting. The Ballot key is pressed when each candidate has to vote. The Red Lamp on the Control Unit is an indication to the polling official of the readiness of the unit to accept a vote and the Ready Lamp on the Ballot Unit is an indication to the voter that the system is ready to accept a vote. Once the voter has exercised his franchise there is a visual and audio indication to the voter that his vote has been recorded. The lamps on the Control Unit and Ballot Unit then go off During the voting process, there is a feature for checking if any Ballot Keys is in a jammed condition or the intercormecting cable is disconnected/loose. The former gives a "Pressed Error" (PE) error message and later gives a "Link Error" (LE) error message. At the end of the poll the close button is pressed after which no further voting is allowed. The Result button is pressed for result display. If any key is pressed out of the above sequence, "no" is displayed. During operation, the action between "clear state" and "candidate set state" is possible both ways. It is also possible to go to "ballot state" from "clear state". This provision facilitates to go to the ballot state directly after clear if there is no change in the number of contesting candidates for the next poll.<br>
The data is encoded and retained in redundant memory banks for the integrity of data. The data is verified for correctness in writing to memory. During computation of the result this data is read and compared from the memory banks before final display. In case of any error, the software also provided for display of voting data up to the instant prior to the error condition.<br>

A Separate lamp, for each candidate, adjacent to the candidate"s Vote Button, to glow momentarily when the voter exercises the franchise by pressing a button.<br>
For setting the Ballot Unit position using the Slide Switch depending on the number of contesting candidates.<br>
Both the Control Unit and the Ballot Unit are provided with carrying cases.<br>
OPERATION: Before the Electronic Voting Machine is sent to the Polling Stations, the Ballot Unit has to be prepared by the Officer-in-charge as given below:<br>
a)	Inserting the Ballot paper,<br>
b)	Masking the Candidate"s buttons, which are not required to be used,<br>
c)	Setting the Shde Switch at the appropriate position, i.e. 1,2,3, or 4 as the case may be according to the number of such units which are to be used depending upon the No. of candidates and the sequence in which, they are to be used and<br>
d)	Sealing the unit.<br>
After taking out the Ballot Unit from the carrying case, the top cover of the unit may be opened carefully by pressing simultaneously, towards the right, the latches at the top and bottom on the right edge of the unit (Ref Numeral 22-fig.2), and swinging the cover up. (Ref Numeral 21-fig.2).<br>
OPENING OF BALLOT PAPER SCREEN<br>
Open the Ballot Paper Screen, which is a transparent acrylic sheet, hinged to the top cover on the extreme left side. The release latches of the screen are inside the top cover (Ref Numeral 21). By pressing the latches simuhaneously, first slightly towards right and then pushing them downwards, the Ballot Paper Screen will become free for opening on the upper side of<br><br>
the said top cover. While opening the screen care should be taken to ensure that it is not damaged.<br>
FIXING OF BALLOT PAPER<br>
Place the Ballot Paper in the space provided for the purpose on the upper side of the top cover. Align the Ballot paper properly so that each candidate"s name and his symbol are in line with the corresponding Candidate"s lamp and button. After ensuring this alignment, close and press fit the Ballot Paper Screen to secure the Ballot Paper firmly underneath that screen.<br>
After the Ballot Paper has been firmly fixed and the Ballot Paper Screen has been pressed fit on the upper side of the Top Cover, the screen is to be sealed on the inner side of the Top Cover. This is to be done by passing the thread through the two holes on the screen specially provided for the purpose and by putting the thread seal on the prescribed address tag showing the particulars of the election with the seal of the Returning Officer.<br>
MASKING OF CANDIDATES" BUTTONS<br>
If the number of Candidates on the ballot paper is less than 16, the white masking tabs should be moved onto the Candidates" buttons not required to be used.<br>
SETTING OF SLIDE SWITCH<br>
Inside the Ballot Unit on the top right side, there is a SUde Switch, which has four positions 1,2,3 and 4. If only one Ballot Unit is to be used, set this Switch to the position marked "1". If two Ballot Units are to be used, set this Switch to the position marked " 1" in the Ballot Unit in which the names of the Candidates at SI. Nos. 1 to 16 appear, and in the second Ballot Unit set this Switch to the position marked "2". If three Ballot Units are to be used, the Slide Switch will be set to the position marked " 1" in the first Ballot Unit in which the names of candidates at SI. Nos. 1 to 16 appear, to the position marked "2" in the second Ballot Unit in which the names of contesting candidates at Sl.Nos.17 to 32 appear, and to the position marked "3" in the third Ballot Unit. Likewise, if the 4"^ Ballot Unit is also to be used if the number of contesting candidates exceeds 48, then the Slide Switch will be sent to the position marked "4" in the last Ballot Unit.<br><br>
1234           1234              1234              1234<br>
J^	   	[j-L-J	        "     "     " O  			        O<br>
Position 1	Position 2	Position 3	Position 4<br>
SEALING OF BALLOT UNIT<br>
Close the Ballot Unit by bringing the top cover back to its original position. Pass two threads, one through the three holes at the top and the other through the three holes at the bottom provided for the purpose and seal each thread with Returning Officer"s seal.<br>
CONTROL UNIT<br>
The Control Unit is to be prepared by the Returning Officer by-<br>
a)	Installing the Power Pack.<br>
b)	Setting the number of contesting candidates<br>
c)	Sealing the "Cand Set" button compartment and<br>
d)	Sealing the Candidate Set Section<br>
POWER PACK INSTALLATION<br>
Open the cover of the Candidate Set Section by pressing slightly inward the latch provided on the left side. Install the Power Pack specially supplied by mating the socket of the Power Pack to the plug. Ensure that Power Pack is pressed tight.<br>
SETTING THE NUMBER OF CONTESTING CANDIDATES<br>
After connecting the Power Pack, open the compartment at the bottom of the Control Unit as explained above, and proceed as follows for setting the No. of contesting candidates:<br>
a) Connect the Ballot Unit to the Control Unit by plugging the connector of the Interconnecting Cable in the plug in that compartment. As the connector and the plug are multi-pin connectors, it will need some practice to plug them properly. The cormector goes into the socket only one way, which can be found out easily by looking at the orientation of the pins and "Top" of the hood. As the pins are delicate,<br><br>
do not force the connector in such a way as it may damage or bend the pins. The EVM will work only when this connection is made properly.<br>
b)	After plugging the connector properly, push the "Power" switch to "ON" position. It will give a beep sound and the "ON" lamp on the Display Section of the Control Unit will glow GREEN.<br>
c)	After the "ON" lamp glows GREEN, press the "Cand Set" button in the Candidate Set Section. There upon the 2 digit Display Panel in the Display Section will now flash the letters "Cd" and the 4 digit Display Panel will flash "- -".<br>
d)	When the letters "Cd", "- -" start flashing on the Display Panels on the Control Unit, press the Candidate"s button against the last contesting candidate in Ballot Unit. For example, if there are 9 contesting candidates, press the 9* candidate"s button. On that button being pressed, the Display Panels will stop flashing the letters "Cd - -". Instead, the fiill panel will start displaying the following information sequentially -<br>
This way the machine is set for 9 contesting candidates.<br>
e)	Switch OFF the EVM by pushing the "Power" switch downwards to OFF position.<br>
Then switch ON the EVM and confirm that the number of contesting candidates is as<br>
per the set value. Next, switch OFF the EVM and disconnect the Interconnecting<br>
Cable from the Control Unit. For this purpose, the spring type clips on both sides of<br>
the connector hood should be pressed inward simultaneously and then the connector<br>
pulled out. Then close the cover of the bottom compartment of the Control Unit.<br><br>
SEALING THE "CAND SET" BUTTON COMPARTMENT<br>
Close the flap which houses the Cand Set button and pass a thread through the two holes provided on the left side and seal with the seal of the Returning Officer. While sealing take care that direct flame does not come in contact with the Control Unit and molten wax does not fall on any part of the Control Unit.<br>
SEALING THE CANDIDATE SET SECTION.<br>
Close the Candidate Set Section. Pass a thread through the two holes provided on the left side and seal with the seal of the Returning Officer. While sealing take care that direct flame does not come in contact with the Control Unit and molten wax does not fall on any part of the Control Unit.<br>
Put back the Ballot Unit and the Control Unit in their respective carrying cases. They are ready for transportation to the Polling Station.<br>
On the day of Election, the presiding Office shall make the following preparations:<br>
The Ballot Unit sill be checked to see if the Ballot Paper is properly fixed in place and that the two seals are intact.<br>
In the Control Unit, the presiding officer will check if the Candidate Set Section is intact and then connect the Ballot Unit to the Control Unit by plugging the connector of the interconnecting cable, put the "Power" switch to "ON" position and then close the bottom compartment. Then open the "Result" Section in the Control Unit and press the "Clear" button to set all counts to "ZERO". It takes about fourteen seconds and the buzzer is "ON" during the clearing process.<br>
On completion of the clearing process, the display panel will start displaying that all counts are set to "ZERO" sequentially (i.e. one by one, the display panel will show the total number of candidates, total votes polled and number of votes for each candidate). If need be the presiding officer will conduct a "MOCK POLL" in the presence of some polling agents &amp; others.<br>
During the actual poll, the "Result Section" should be sealed. Using special security paper serially numbered. This paper seal has to be firmly fixed in the inner cover frame of the<br><br>
Result Section. A thin cardboard padding may be provided. The seal should be so fixed that its green surface is seen through the apertures from the outer side. Here is also a provision for making a thread seal on the left side of the inner door. After this, the outer cover of the Result Section has to be pressed for closing this section.<br>
PROCEDURE DURING POLL<br>
The Poll shall commence at the hour fixed for such commencement. Press the "Total" button and ensure that the total votes polled is zero. After all procedural requirements relating to identification of voter, application of indelible ink on his forefinger and obtaining his signature/thumb impression in the Register of Voters have been completed with regard to the first voter, the voter concerned has to be allowed for recording his vote. For that purpose, press the"Ballot"button on Ballot Section of the Control Unit which would make the Ballot Unit ready for recording of the vote by that voter as has been explained herein above. Repeat that procedure every time the next voter is to be allowed to record his vote. It should be ensured that only one voter goes inside the voting compartment to vote. Special care should be taken to ensure that a voter goes in that compartment in the same order in which his Name is entered in the "Register of Voters." Also ensure that the Ballot button is pressed only when the earlier voter has come out of the voting compartment. At any time, if the total number of votes polled has to be ascertained, "Total" button should be pressed. The Display panel will then show the total number of votes polled by that time. Please remember that the "Total" button is to be pressed only when the "Busy" lamp is OFF.<br>
After the close of the poll, the close button will be pressed. When this button is pressed the display panel will show the total number of candidates and the total number of votes polled during the day.<br>
On the day of counting, after making the necessary checks, the Result button I in the Control Unit pressed to start the Result computation process. On completion of the result computation process, the total number of candidates, the total number of votes and the total number of votes for each candidate will be displayed in the "Display Panel" sequentially.<br><br>
Uniqueness of the invention:<br>
CONTROL UNIT:<br>
The software for setting the number of contesting candidates works in a unique way and provides a simple and efficient method to set the machine to the number of contesting candidates.<br>
The "display on demand" provision in the control unit greatly reduces the power requirements for the machine and at the same time provides adequate time for the viewer to take note of the displayed data.<br>
The software, which detects the presence of ballot units, works in a unique way. When the ballot key is pressed and is a valid key, the software periodically checks for the presence of the ballot unit and gives a clear audio-visual indication (Link Error XE") regarding the error condition if the ballot unit is disconnected.<br>
The provision in software for reading back the vote data as soon as it is written in the memory provides a unique way of continuously checking the memory retention as well as functioning and leads to "so far so good" type of working. Error at any time during the poll is immediately detected and further polling is stopped. The votes recorded till then are secure and the result of the poll thus far conducted can be seen at the time of counting. Poll can be continued with a new machine.<br>
The software for the detection of pressed error condition works in a unique way to detect the jammed buttons on the ballot unit. Under this error condition, the control unit display TE" (Pressed Error).<br>
The method of recording the votes in the non-volatile memory inside the control unit helps in reducing the numbers of write cycles per cell in the memory thereby greatly increasing the usability of the machine. In fact, during every poll, any specific location in the non-volatile memory is written, on an average ten (10) times. With a non-volatile memory, with about a million write cycle durability, this machine can be used for at least one hundred thousand elections (one Lakh) election before the memory needs a replacement.<br><br>
The provision to include an error-checking bit with the recording of each vote inside the memory greatly enhances the reliability of the recorded data.<br>
The provision to record the vote cast by a voter in "QUADRUPLICATE" inside the control unit helps in computing and displaying the result of the poll in a more reliable fashion. This feature also provides for adequate redundancy of data storage.<br>
The unique software in the control unit, which computes the resuk of the poll, performs up to 10 compare and validation checks before the vote is assigned to a candidate.<br>
The unique software inside the control unit provides for a sequence looking for the control buttons - ballot, close, result 1 / result 2, clear and Cand Set in such a way that<br>
i)	Contesting Candidate setting cannot be changed unless the machine is in the<br>
condition, ii)        Votes cannot be cast on the machine unless it is in the cleared condition, iii)       Votes cannot be added to the machine once it is closed (by pressing the close button), iv)       Result caimot be seen unless the machine is closed (by pressing the close button) v)        The machine cannot be cleared (by pressing the clear button) unless the result is seen<br>
at least once if there are non zero votes recorded on the machine.<br>
The unique software inside the Control unit provides for regulating the voting on the machine. This is achieved by ensuring that a maximum of only 5 votes per minute can be cast on the machine. This is especially useful to discourage rigging during poll.<br>
The interlocking feature built into the software in the control unit, which requires the connection of ballot unit for the clear operation to commence, prevents accidental erasure of voting data.<br>
The gray code conversion of the binary scan codes by the control unit when scanning the ballot units reduces the frequency of signals on the cable connecting the ballot unit with the control unit. This helps in reducing the susceptibility of the machine to induced electromagnetic interface.<br>
The control unit has the unique feature of retaining the voting data without the need for applying any power.<br><br>
The control unit can retain, securely, the voting data without any power connection for up to 10 years.<br>
The control unit can be switched off safely at any stage of operation and still continue to work satisfactorily after reapplying the power.<br>
Using a gadget called "Auxiliary Display Unit (ADU)" which is connected to in parallel to the display board and the result data can be conveniently displayed even if the internal display digits/segments in digits on the control unit have failed.<br>
The provision for connecting a gadget called "Totalizer" to the MCU connector of the Control unit and its subsequent detection by the CU when Result buttons are operated, help in mixing of votes and prevent the results of individual polling stations from being displayed.<br>
The machine provides unique provision for conducting "Simultaneous poll". This feature enables one control unit along with a mini-control unit to conduct polls simultaneously to two posts - like Member of ParUament and Member of State Legislative Assembly.<br>
BALLOT UNIT:<br>
The mechanical blocking tabs provided in the ballot unit to block the unused candidate buttons with color identical to that of the body of the ballot unit removes any confusion in the minds of the voter regarding the actual candidate buttons in use. This also prevents votes being cast on buttons not in use.<br>
The software in the control unit for scanning the candidate keys in the ballot unit works in a unique way such that only the buttons of those candidates who are in poll are scanned. Rest of the buttons as well as boxes if connected is ignored.<br>
No invalid vote can be cast on the voting machine.<br>
The hardware daisy chaining provision implemented in the ballot unit prevents wrong connection of the ballot units when more than one ballot unit is used (As in the case where the number of contesting candidates is more than 16). The control unit always detects any error in the sequential connection of the ballot units at the appropriate time and an error message is flashed and fiirther operation stopped. This prevents wrongly registering the votes on the machine.<br><br>
The locking pins, provided under the transparent ballot paper screen on the Ballot unit, prevent the movement of the ballot paper placed under the screen.<br>
No part inside the machine, which requires periodic reconditioning or replacement.<br>
The machine has unique feature of providing for up to 64 candidates on both the polls when used for simultaneous poll.<br>
The cabinet designs for both the control unit and the ballot unit provide for adequate interlocking of the required functions/keys.<br>
The carrying cases provided separately for the control unit and the ballot units provide for easy transport of the machines and also enable them to be carried over rugged terrain without causing any damage to the units.<br><br><br>
