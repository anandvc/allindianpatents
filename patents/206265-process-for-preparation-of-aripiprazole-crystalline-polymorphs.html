quinolinone  and  its  salts  are  useful for treating  schizophrenia  and their therapeutic uses were disclosed in US 5,006,528.<br>
Processes for the preparation of aripiprazole and its salts were described in US 5,006,528. These processes do not produce well defined, reproducible crystalline forms.<br>

We have discovered two novel crystalline forms of aripiprazole and four novel crystalline forms of aripiprazole hydrochloride. The novel forms have been found to be stable over the time and reproducible and so, suitable for pharmaceutical preparations.<br>

Another object of the present invention is to provide stable novel crystalline forms of aripiprazole hydrochloride, processes for preparation of the novel crystalline forms and pharmaceutical compositions containing these novel crystalline forms.<br><br>
Since the novel crystalline forms of aripiprazole hydrochloride are obtained with high purity, preparation of aripiprazole via the crystalline forms of aripiprazole hydrochloride serves as a means of producing pure aripiprazole.<br>

Hydrochloric acid may be added as an aqueous solution or as a solution in any other solvent; or hydrochloric acid gas may be passed through the solution of aripiprazole. Then the contents are maintained for about 1 hour to 4 hours at about 15°C to 25°C and the separated solid is filtered and dried to obtain Form C of aripiprazole hydrochloride.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a novel crystalline form of aripiprazole hydrochloride, designated as Form D, characterized by an x-ray powder diffraction pattern having peaks expressed as 29 at about 9.0, 14.7, 16.4, 17.4, 19.0, 19.3, 19.8, 21.4, 23.4, 24.7, 25.4 degrees. Figure 6 shows typical Form D x-ray powder diffraction pattern.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a process for preparation of the Form D of aripiprazole hydrochloride. Thus aripiprazole is dissolved in tetrahydrofuran. Hydrochloric acid is added to the solution. Hydrochloric acid may be added as an aqueous solution or as a solution in any other solvent; or hydrochloric acid gas may be passed through the solution of aripiprazole. Then the contents are maintained for 2 hour to 4 hours at about 15°C to 25°C and the separated crystals are filtered and dried to produce Form D of aripiprazole hydrochloride.<br>
The novel crystalline forms of aripiprazole hydrochloride obtained by the processes described above are very pure. So, aripiprazole with high purity can be obtained by basifying a solution of aripiprazole hydrochloride crystalline form and isolating aripiprazole from the solution by usual processes known in the art.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising Form I or Form II of aripiprazole and a pharmaceutical^ acceptable carrier.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising crystalline form of aripiprazole hydrochloride and a pharmaceutical^ acceptable carrier. The crystalline form may be Form A, Form B, Form C or Form D.<br>

pharmaceutical  compositions are tablets,  capsules,  powders,  suspensions, emulsions, injections and the like.<br>
The following examples will serve to further illustrate the invention.<br>

The solution is slowly cooled to 25°C in 1 hour and maintained at 25°C for 3 hours. The separated crystals are filtered and dried to give 1 gm of Form I of aripiprazole.<br>
Example 2 Aripiprazole (2 gm) (obtained by a process described in US 5,006,528) is dissolved in tetrahydrofuran and the solvent is removed by vacuum drying at 25°C for 6 hours to give Form II of aripiprazole in quantitative yield.<br>
Example 3 Aripiprazole (2 gm) (obtained by a process described in US 5,006,528) is dissolved in tetrahydrofuran and the solvent is removed by spray drying at 25°C for 6 hours to give Form II of aripiprazole in quantitative yield.<br>
Example 4 Aripiprazole (2 gm) (obtained by a process described in US 5,006,528) is dissolved in methanol (12 ml) and cone, hydrochloric acid (1 ml) is added to the solution. The contents are maintained for 2 hours at 25°C and the separated solid is filtered to give 2 gm of Form A of aripiprazole hydrochloride.<br>
Example 5 Aripiprazole (2 gm) (obtained by a process described in US 5,006,528) is dissolved in acetone (12 ml) and cone, hydrochloric acid (1ml) is added to the solution. The contents are maintained for 3 hours at 25°C and the separated solid is filtered to give 1.9 gm of Form B of aripiprazole hydrochloride.<br>
Example 6 Aripiprazole (2 gm) (obtained by a process described in US 5,006,528) is dissolved in ethyl acetate (12 ml). 10% WA/ HCI in ethyl acetate (4 ml) is added to the solution. The solution is maintained at 25°C for 2 hours and the separated crystals are collected by filtration to give 2 gm of Form C of * aripiprazole hydrochloride.<br>
Example 7<br><br>
Aripiprazole (2 gm) (obtained by a process described in US 5,006,528) is dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (12 ml) and cone, hydrochloric acid (1ml) is added to the solution. The contents are maintained for 3 hours at 25°C and the separated solid is collected by filtration to give 2 gm of Form D of aripiprazole hydrochloride.<br>
Example 8 Example   1   is  repeated  using   Form   II   of  aripiprazole  instead  of aripiprazole to give Form I of aripiprazole.<br>
Example 9 Example   2  is   repeated   using   Form   I   of  aripiprazole  instead  of aripiprazole to give Form II of aripiprazole.<br>
Example 10 Example   5   is   repeated   using   Form   I   of  aripiprazole  instead   of aripiprazole to give Form B of aripiprazole hydrochloride.<br>
Example 11 Example  7   is   repeated   using   Form   II   of aripiprazole  instead  of aripiprazole to give Form D of aripiprazole hydrochloride.<br><br><br><br>
