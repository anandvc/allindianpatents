				<td>Three-position Switch particularly for a<br>
Medium Tension or High Tension Switchgear<br>
Description<br>
The invention pertains to a three-position switch particularly for a medium tension or<br>
high tension switch gear, with an electrically earthed housing that has a first and a second<br>
front side, with a first and a second connector, to which respectively an electrical<br>
conductor can be connected from outside, as well as with a contact piece that can be<br>
shifted along an axis, to which either one of both the connectors can be electrically<br>
connected to the housing, or none of both the connectors can be electrically connected to<br>
the housing, or both connectors can be electrically connected to one another.<br>
Such a three-position switch is known for example from the document EP 1 128 509 Al.<br>
There one deals with a gas-insulated switch, in which both the connectors on the<br>
periphery of the housing are accessible from outside and hence the respective allied<br>
electrical conductor can be connected there.<br>
It is the task of this invention to create a three-position switch that can contribute to a<br>
reduction in the required structural space.<br>
This task is fulfilled with the help of a three-position switch as per the invention of the<br>
type as described above, in that the front sides are arranged almost transverse to the axis<br>
and the first connector can be connected with the electrical conductor on the first front<br>
side and the second connector can be connected with the electrical connector on the<br>
second front side.<br>
This design extension brings forth the advantage that the three-position switch according<br>
to the invention forms an extremely compact structural unit that requires very less space<br>
for itself. Hence the three-position switch can be completely mounted along with another<br>
switching device, e.g. a heavy duty switch, and tested in the work and then on account of<br>
the compactness of the entire arrangement be transported as a complete unit to the place<br>
of application.<br><br>
2<br>
With the help of the arrangement as per the invention of both connectors it is further<br>
achieved that no structural parts of the three-position switch have to be present or<br>
accessible on the periphery of the housing. This yields the advantage that other<br>
components of the electrical switch gear can be arranged on the periphery. This leads to<br>
further reduction in the overall required structural space.<br>
It is particularly advantageous if at least one current transformer core is arranged on the<br>
periphery of the housing of the three-position switch. This means that the three-position<br>
switch is integrated within the current transformer core. This structural form has an<br>
overall significantly lesser space requirement than the space required if the current<br>
converter cores and the three-position switch are in separate structure types.<br>
In an advantageous extension of the invention the first connector has a section that is<br>
provided with a borehole that is accessible on the first front side from outside and into<br>
which the electrical conductor can be plugged in from outside. In this way, the connect-<br>
ability of the first connector and the electrical conductor on the first front side as<br>
suggested by the invention can be realised in a simple manner. It is obvious that the<br>
borehole can be arranged somewhat coaxial to the axis, or even eccentric on the front<br>
side.<br>
In another advantageous extension of the invention the second connector protrudes<br>
outwards against the second front side and the electrical conductor can be connected<br>
there from outside. This also similarly allows simple realisation of the connect-ability of<br>
the second connector and the electrical conductor on the second front side. Here too it is<br>
possible that the connection is foreseen somewhat coaxial to the axis or eccentric.<br>
In another advantageous extension of the invention the second connector is designed like<br>
a pin or tube and the shift-able contact part is designed as sleeve that can e shifted back<br>
and forth on the pin-shaped or tube-shaped second connector. In this way one can realise<br>
a guiding of the contact part on the second connector, which ensures high functional<br>
safety and at the same time less structural complication.<br><br>
3<br>
In an extension of the invention the first connector has a section towards the second<br>
connector that is foreseen with a borehole whose inner diameter matches the outer<br>
diameter of the sleeve. Thus it is possible in a very advantageous manner to connect the<br>
first and the second connector electrically with one another by means of the sleeve.<br>
In an advantageous extension of the invention the shift-able contact part is connected to a<br>
plate that stands away almost transverse to the axis of the contact part. With the help of<br>
this plate it is possible to influence the electrical field in the inner space of the three-<br>
position switch. This can be used to design the three-point switch as per the invention in<br>
an even more compact manner.<br>
It is particularly advantageous if the housing has a section protruding inwards whose<br>
inner diameter matches the outer diameter of the plate. It is thus possible to use the plate<br>
as electrical connecting member by earthing the second connector. The plate thus has<br>
double function - namely influencing the field and earthing.<br>
It is furthermore particularly advantageous if the shift-able contact part can be moved<br>
back and forth by a gear system, particularly a lever and if the gear system, particularly<br>
the lever is arranged on the side of the plate away from the first connector. In this way the<br>
plate can be used for electrical shielding of the lever.<br>
Further feature, application possibilities and advantages of the invention can be obtained<br>
from the following description of design examples of the invention that are shown in the<br>
figures of the drawing. All described or shown features form the objective of the<br>
invention either individually or in any arbitrary combination, irrespective of their<br>
combination in the patent claims or irrespective of their formulation or depiction in the<br>
description or in the drawing.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a schematic sectional depiction of a design example of a three-position<br>
switch as per the invention in an earthed position; Fig. 2 shows a schematic depiction of<br>
the three-position switch shown in Fig. 1 in a disconnected position; and Fig. 3 shows a<br><br>
4<br>
schematic sectional depiction of the three-position switch shown in Fig. 1 in a closed<br>
position.<br>
Fig. 1 to 3 show a three-position switch 10 of a medium tension or high tension<br>
switchgear. The three-position switch 10 is preferably foreseen for installation in an air-<br>
insulated switchgear or a so called compact switchgear assembly or a so called dead-tank<br>
switch. Besides, the three-position switch 10 can also be used in a gas-insulated<br>
switchgear.<br>
The three-position switch 10 shown in figures 1 to 3 is designed largely rotation-<br>
symmetric and has an axis A. Somewhat transverse to the axis A the three-position<br>
switch 10 has a first front side S1 and a second front side S2.<br>
The three-position switch 10 has a housing 13 that is designed largely cylindrical and<br>
from which three circular ring type sections 14, 15, 16 stand away inwards in the<br>
direction to the axis A. The housing 13 is made of an electrically conducting material and<br>
is electrically earthed.<br>
Outside on its periphery the housing 13 is surrounded by three current transformer cores<br>
18 that rotate around the housing 13 almost coaxial to the axis A and are arranged beside<br>
one another in the direction of the axis A. the current transformer cores 18 are covered on<br>
their outer side by a shielding plate 19.<br>
A disc-shaped insulating part 21 is held against the section 14 of the housing 13 and has a<br>
circular opening 22centric and hence almost coaxial to the axis A. The insulating part 21<br>
can eccentrically have further openings for the purpose of exchanging insulating gas. In<br>
the opening 22 a first connector 24 is held that is made of an electrically conductive<br>
material. The first connector 24 is accessible on the front side S1 of the three-position<br>
switch 10 from the outside.<br><br>
5<br>
The first connector 24 has a cylindrical section 25 and a mushroom section 26. Both<br>
sections 25,26 are aligned almost coaxial to the axis A. The cylindrical section 25 is<br>
accessible on the front side S1 from outside and has a borehole 27 almost coaxial to the<br>
axis A, which is foreseen so that an electrical conductor can be plugged into it from<br>
outside. The electrical conductor is mostly a rod. The borehole 27 of the section 25 is<br>
accessible for this purpose from outside. The mushroom section 26 is situated in the inner<br>
space of the three-position switch 10 and has a borehole coaxial to the axis A, whose<br>
purpose will be described below. For holding the first connector 24 in the insulating part<br>
a ring 29 is plugged on to the cylindrical section 25 from outside.<br>
On the section 16 of the housing 13 a disc-shaped insulating part 31 is held, which has a<br>
circular opening 32 almost centric and hence almost coaxial to the axis A. the insulating<br>
part 31 can eccentrically have further openings for the purpose of replacing insulating<br>
gas. In the opening 32 a second connector 34 is held that is made of an electrically<br>
conductive material. The second connector 34 is accessible on the front side S2 of the<br>
three-position switch 10 from outside.<br>
The second connector 34 is designed as a pin or tube and is aligned almost coaxial to axis<br>
A. In the inner space of the three-position switch 10 the diameter of the second connector<br>
34 is largely uniform. For holding the second connector 34in the insulating part 31, the<br>
second connector 34 is provided with two projecting rings 35, 36. The second connector<br>
34 protrudes outwards on the front side S2 out of the housing 13 of the three-position<br>
switch 10. There the second connector 34 can be connected from outside to an electric<br>
conductor. The electric conductor can especially be a cylindrical component.<br>
On the pin-type or tube-type second connector 34 a cylindrical sleeve 38 is arranged in a<br>
shift-able manner in the inner space of the three-position switch 10. The sleeve 34 is<br>
made of an electrically conductive material. The sleeve 34 can be pushed back and forth<br>
in the direction of the axis A on the second connector 34. The sleeve 38 thus forms a<br>
contact part movable along an axis.<br><br>
6<br>
The inner diameter of the sleeve 38 and the outer diameter of the sleeve 34 are tuned to<br>
one another in such a way that in every shifting position there is an electrical contact<br>
between the second connector 34 and the sleeve 38. Furthermore, the sleeve 38 and the<br>
mushroom section 26 of the first connector 24 are tuned to one another as will be<br>
explained below.<br>
In the region of that free end of the sleeve 38 that is towards the first connector 24, the<br>
sleeve 38 is provided with a disc-shaped plate 39. This plate 39 stands away from the<br>
sleeve 38 almost transverse to the axis A and protrudes into the inner space of the three-<br>
position switch 10. The plate 39 is made of an electrically conductive material.<br>
In the region of that free end of the sleeve 38 that is away from the first connector 24 a<br>
rod 41 is pivoted against the sleeve 38 and is connected through a swivel-able hinged<br>
lever 42 to a rotate-able shaft 43. The rod 41 and/or the lever 42 are made of an<br>
electrically insulating material. The shaft 43 is supported in the housing 13 almost<br>
transverse to the axis A and is guided outwards through the housing 13 (not shown). By a<br>
suitable rotation movement of the shaft 43 the sleeve 38 can be pushed back and forth on<br>
the second connector 34 in the direction of the axis A by means of the rod 41 and the<br>
lever 42.<br>
Viewed with respect to the first connector 24 the rod 41 and the lever 42 are arranged<br>
behind the plate 39. The plate 39 can thus be used for electrical shielding of the rod 41<br>
and the lever 42. Furthermore, through the spatial arrangement and design of the plate 39<br>
the electrical field in the inner space of the three-position switch 10 can be influenced.<br>
It is obvious that instead of the rod 41 and the lever 42 a very general gear system can be<br>
foreseen. In that case at least one component of the gear system should be made of an<br>
electrically insulating material. Furthermore, the gear system or at least a part of it is<br>
arranged on the side of the plate 39 away from the first connector 34. For example, it is<br>
possible that a toothed gear system is foreseen, in which one toothed gear is plugged onto<br><br>
7<br>
the shaft 43 and a toothed rack is coupled with the sleeve 38, whereby the toothed gear<br>
and the toothed rack mesh into one another.<br>
On the free end of the section 15 of the housing 13 a contact ring 45 is arranged that is<br>
made of an electrically conductive material and is electrically connected to the housing<br>
13. The disc-shaped section 15 standing away inwards from the housing 13 and the disc-<br>
shaped plate 39 standing away outwards from the sleeve 38 are adapted to one another in<br>
such a way that - as long as the plate 39 is arranged in the region of the section 15 - there<br>
is an electrical connection between the sleeve 38 through the plate 39 and the contact ring<br>
45 to the section 15 of the three-position switch 10.<br>
Fig. 1 shows an earthed position of the three-position switch 10. There is an electrically<br>
conductive connection from the second connector 34 through the sleeve 38, through the<br>
plate 39 and through the contact ring 45 to the section 15 of the earthed housing 13. The<br>
second connector 34 is thus at the same electrical potential as the housing 13 and hence<br>
earthed. The first connector 24 has no electrical connection with the second connector 34<br>
and is similarly not earthed.<br>
If now the shaft 43 is brought into a rotation movement, then the sleeve 38 gets pushed<br>
on the second connector 34 in a direction towards the first connector 24. The sleeve 38<br>
then goes over from the position shown in Fig. 1 to the position shown in Fig. 2.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a disconnected position of the three-position switch 10. The plate 39 no<br>
longer has an electrical connection with the contact ring 45, so that the second connector<br>
34 is no longer connected with the housing 13. The second connector 34 is thus no longer<br>
earthed. The first connector 24 continues to have no electrical contact with the second<br>
connector 34 and is similarly not earthed.<br>
If now the shaft 43 is brought into a further rotation movement, then the sleeve 38 gets<br>
pushed on the second connector 34 further in direction towards the first connector 24.<br><br>
8<br>
The sleeve then goes over from the position shown in Fig. 2 to the position shown in Fig.<br>
3.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a closed position of the three-position switch 10. The free end of the sleeve<br>
38 is immersed into the borehole 28 of the mushroom section 26 of the first connector 24.<br>
The outer diameter of the sleeve 38 is tuned to the inner diameter of the borehole 28 of<br>
the mushroom section 26 of the first connector 24 in such a way that in immersed<br>
condition there is an electrical contact between the sleeve 38 and the first connector 24.<br>
Thus an electrical contact is established between the first connector 24 and the second<br>
connector 34 through the mushroom section 26 and the sleeve 38. In this closed position<br>
both connectors 24, 34 are disconnected from the housing 13 of the three-position switch<br>
10 and hence not earthed.<br>
The design of both connectors 24, 34 in Fig. 1 to 3 should be understood as examples. It<br>
is obvious that the connectors 24, 34 can also be designed differently. It is particularly<br>
possible that the connector on the first front side S1 is designed as a cylindrical pin and/or<br>
the connector on the second front side S2 is designed as cylindrical borehole. Thus it is<br>
possible that the entire three-position switch 10 can not only be installed in a medium<br>
tension or high tension switchgear in a position shown in Fig. 1 to 3 but also inverted, i.e.<br>
turned by 180 degrees.<br><br>
