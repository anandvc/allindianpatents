Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a process for the production of blister copper.<br>
Background to the Invention<br>
The production of blister copper to date has been dominated by use of<br>
Pierce-Smith converters. However these converters are progressively falling<br>
further behind environmentally acceptable standards for off-gas emissions. In<br>
more recent times, technologies such as those developed by Outokumpu and<br>
Mitsubishi have been adapted to the production of blister copper. These not only<br>
provide an improvement in environmental performance over the Pierce-Smith<br>
converters, but also improve the scale of operation and productivity. Still more<br>
recent is the proposal of Edwards et al disclosed in US patent 5888270, issued<br>
30 March 1999.<br>
The proposal of Edwards et al utilises what is referred to as a lance based<br>
process. More specifically, the process uses a top-submerged injection lancing<br>
furnace in which an injection lance is lowered from above a molten bath to<br>
submerge a discharge tip at its lower end for injection within the bath. The bath<br>
consists of a continuous slag phase, in particular of a calcium ferrite slag, which<br>
floats on a continuous molten blister copper phase. Matte and/or concentrate,<br>
together with a suitable flux, is added to the slag phase while that phase is<br>
agitated by the submerged injection of an oxidizing gas capable of reacting with<br>
the matte and/or concentrate to form blister copper. The lance tip is located deep<br>
within the slag phase to ensure that a substantial proportion of injected oxidizing<br>
gas contacts the blister copper phase.<br>
It is suggested in Edwards et al that contact of oxidizing gas with the blister<br>
copper oxidises the blister copper and generates copper oxide which floats to an<br>
interface between the slag and blister copper phases. It is further suggested that<br>
the copper oxide reacts with matte or concentrate which reaches the interface, or<br>
alternatively is dissolved or dispersed in the slag to react with the matte or<br>
concentrate. It also is contended that the copper oxide assists desulphurisation of<br>
the copper and improves the utilization of oxygen by the sulphur with concomitant<br>
reduction of the sulphur content of the blister copper and of copper losses to the<br>
slag. However, low sulphur blister copper contents are said to be achieved by<br><br><br>
injecting oxygen directly into the copper layer, as distinct from merely deeply injecting<br>
the oxygen in the slag for contacting the copper layer at its interface with the slag<br>
layer.<br>
The present invention also relates to a process for producing blister copper by<br>
5top-submerged injection. However, the process of the invention is directed to a<br>
process which obviates the need for a substantial proportion of an oxidizing gas to<br>
make contact with the blister copper phase, or for any need for injection into the<br>
copper phase through its interface with the continuous slag phase.<br>
Broad Outline of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides a process for converting a copper sulphide<br>
matte to blister copper, wherein the process includes the steps of:<br>
adding the copper sulphide matte and flux to an agitated slag phase; and<br>
injecting, from a discharge tip at the lower end of a top-submerged lance, an<br>
oxidizing gas by which the slag phase is agitated and which is suitable for reacting<br>
with the matte to produce blister copper which forms or adds to a continuous blister<br>
copper phase below the slag phase;<br>
wherein the conversion is carried out continuously, the slag phase comprises an iron<br>
based silicate slag, the copper sulphide matte is dispersed in the iron based silicate<br>
slag, and the depth of the iron based silicate slag phase and the level at which the<br>
lance tip is located in the slag phase are such that the injected gas agitates the slag<br>
phase and reacts with copper sulphide matte dispersed in the slag phase but so that<br>
a jet or stream of the injected gas is unable to pass through the lower surface of the<br>
slag phase and the gas is substantially precluded from contacting the continuous<br>
copper phase, and the produced blister copper is tapped continuously or at intervals.<br>
The process of the invention is conducted with a substantial depth of slag. This<br>
is a depth which, with the required lance tip location, enables agitation of the slag<br>
phase by the top-submerged injection therein without a stream or jet of the injected<br>
gas passing through to the lower surface of the slag phase. The actual depth of slag<br>
can vary with a number of factors, including the size and shape of the furnace or<br>
reactor, and the number of and spacing between lances where more than one is<br>
used. The depth of slag may range from a minimum of about 500mm up to about 2m,<br>
preferably about 700mm to about 1.7m.<br><br>
The depth of the slag phase and the requirements for top-submerged injection<br>
in the present invention have a number of practical benefits. A first benefit is that<br>
start-up of the process is facilitated in that a blister copper phase need not initially be<br>
present at all or to a significant extent. In contrast, the process of Edwards et al<br>
5necessitates the presence of a blister copper phase at<br><br>
the outset, in order to prevent gas which is to contact that phase from impinging<br>
on refractory lining of the furnace, or to use a modified mode of operation until a<br>
sufficient depth of blister copper has been produced.<br>
A further benefit of the requirements of the present invention for top-<br>
submerged injection is that injection is able to be at a significant height above the<br>
lower surface of the slag phase. Due to this, the submerged injection need not be<br>
directed towards that surface, but instead can be directed downwardly and<br>
laterally outwardly. Thus, the injection is able to be at a mid-region of the slag<br>
phase, or nearer to the top of the slag phase where this is relatively shallow, and<br>
directed laterally outwardly from the lance tip. The injected gas is able to be<br>
directed downwardly and laterally outwardly in a plurality of streams angularly<br>
spaced around the tip of the lance. In this way, the gas more readily is able to<br>
agitate the entire slag phase body, thereby facilitating uniform dispersal of the<br>
copper sulphide matte throughout the slag phase. This enables substantially<br>
maximum utilization of the slag phase as a reaction medium in which the matte is<br>
able to be oxidised, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency of operation of the<br>
process. The process of the present invention therefore may be conducted with a<br>
lance which has an outlet tip provided with a plurality of suitable oriented outlets<br>
for providing a plurality of downwardly and outwardly directed streams. However,<br>
the lance more preferably has vanes or swirlers which impart helical flow to gas<br>
passing therethrough for injection, to maximise mixing of the gas with, and<br>
turbulence in, the slag phase. In each case the lance is of a form that provides<br>
injected gas with a radial injection component to promote dispersion of the gas<br>
into the slag phase and avoid penetration of gases into the metal phase.<br>
Since the slag is the reaction medium for conversion of the copper sulphide<br>
matte to blister copper, the volume of the slag phase is a factor which contributes<br>
to the rate of production of blister copper. The indicated requirements for top-<br>
submerged injection enable use of a relatively large slag phase volume for a given<br>
reactor and, hence, a relatively high rate of production of blister copper. In<br>
contrast, the mode of injection required by the process of Edwards et al tends to<br>
confine the effective volume of slag phase to a lower region of the available slag<br>
phase volume. Certainly, in the process of Edwards et al, there can be a<br>
substantial depth of slag phase. However, the upper region of the slag phase<br>
tends to provide a less effective part of the overall volume for efficient production<br><br>
of blister copper and the extent of the upper region increases with increasing slag<br>
phase depth. Also, with increasing depth of the slag phase, there is an increased<br>
risk of problems arising from vibration of the furnace induced by the high velocity<br>
and mass flow rate of the injected gas.<br>
A still further benefit of the requirements of the present invention for top-<br>
submerged injection is the reduction of competing reactions. Thus, contrary to the<br>
proposal of Edwards et al, it is preferable to avoid oxidation of copper in the<br>
continuous blister copper phase and the present invention facilitates this<br>
avoidance.<br>
Overall, there are significant differences between the present invention and<br>
the process of Edwards et al in relation to the slag phase. Edwards et al teaches<br>
the use of a deep slag layer in order to:<br>
(a)	allow time for the copper sulphide matte or copper concentrate to melt and<br>
react with the slag;<br>
(b)	maintain the matte as a dispersion - but reaction between the matte and<br>
slag is maximised while reaction between the matte and blister copper is to<br>
be minimised; and<br>
(c)	ensure the slag is well agitated by the injected gas while injecting a<br>
substantial portion of the injected oxygen into the blister copper by a deeply<br>
submerged lance, in the maintained deep slag ph-ase.<br>
The injection of a substantial portion of the oxygen into the blister copper<br>
will result in a lower region of the slag phase in which blister copper is dispersed.<br>
However, reaction between matte (in the slag) and blister copper (dispersed in a<br>
lower region of the slag) is to be minimised. Thus, it is evident that substantially<br>
all or a substantial proportion of the matte needs to be reacted to produce blister<br>
copper before it reaches the lower region of the slag phase. However, it is difficult<br>
enough to minimise reaction between matte and blister copper in the process of<br>
converting matte to blister copper without, at the same time, dispersing blister<br>
copper from the layer of blister copper phase into the region of the slag in which<br>
the matte is dispersed.<br>
In contrast, the present invention, while able to accommodate a similar<br>
depth of slag phase, does not necessitate this. Also, regardless of the slag phase<br>
depth, the present invention enables and benefits from a slag phase in which<br>
matte is relatively uniformly or homogeneously dispersed, rather than one in<br><br>
which compositional strata or gradients are to be generated. Additionally, the<br>
invention obviates the need for injection into the blister copper phase, and that<br>
phase is able to be maintained as a relatively quiescent phase in which blister<br>
copper being produced by the process is able to collect. Thus, with continuous<br>
converting of matte, the process of the invention is considerably more amenable<br>
to tapping of blister copper, either continuously or at intervals, without the need to<br>
interrupt top submerged injection,<br>
As indicated above, the proposal of Edwards et al is illustrated by reference<br>
to a calcium ferrite slag. That slag preferably is highly oxidised and has copper<br>
oxide, calcium oxide, and ferric and ferrous oxides as its main components, and<br>
also some silica. The use of a calcium ferrite slag is in accord with recent<br>
recommended and accepted practice, such as illustrated by the use of calcium<br>
ferrite slags in the conversion stage of the Mitsubishi process. However, there are<br>
significant difficulties with the use of calcium ferrite slags in copper converting. As<br>
a result, there recently has been work on investigating the use of ferrous calcium<br>
silicate slags.<br>
Calcium ferrite slags are used in the converting stage of the Mitsubishi<br>
process. This is in contrast to the iron silicate slags used in the first, smelting<br>
stage of the Mitsubishi process, and also used throughout Pierce-Smith<br>
converting. The calcium ferrite slags present a wide, homogeneous liquid area<br>
when mixed with iron oxides. This enables them to absorb iron oxide generated<br>
during converting. The calcium ferrite slags thus are able to avoid troublesome<br>
magnetite precipitation and so obviate the risk of slag foaming" which magnetite<br>
precipitation can cause with iron silicate slags. However, the calcium ferrite slags<br>
have their own problems. One major problem with calcium ferrite slags results<br>
from their high fluidity/low viscosity. Also, they cause excessive refractory<br>
damage, and have a iow lead removal ratio. Additionally, the calcium silicate<br>
slags retain substantial quantities of copper oxide, while they are not suitable for<br>
subsequent treatment by flotation or reduction in conventional slag cleaning<br>
furnaces for the recovery of copper. This limits the treatment of the resulting slag<br>
to recycling as a solid to a smelting stage. Moreover, calcium ferrite slags have<br>
little tolerance for silica which may enter the process as impurities in the feed<br>
streams either because silica is inherent in the feed materials or inadvertently is<br>
introduced through contamination. The extent of the problems with calcium ferrite<br><br>
slags is reflected by the move to ferrous calcium silicate slags, despite these being<br>
relatively untested on a commercial scale.<br>
In the present invention, the slag phase is an iron based silicate slag. The iron<br>
based silicate slag may be an iron silicate (fayalite) slag, a lime modified iron silicate<br>
slag, or a ferrous calcium silicate (olivine) slag. In other contexts, the iron based<br>
silicate slag system has known problems. We have found that these problems can be<br>
overcome or avoided with use of the present invention. Also, we have found that the<br>
known benefits of the iron based silicate slags are able to be retained with use of the<br>
present invention. Thus, the process of the invention is able to be based on a slag<br>
phase with which the industry is familiar. Also, in converting copper sulphide matte, it<br>
is possible to integrate the process with an existing smelting plant producing the<br>
matte, with the slag resulting from the process of the invention able to be treated<br>
readily by way of recycle, flotation or reduction to recover contained copper.<br>
Moreover, blister copper product is able to be of a required commercial quality, such<br>
as with respect to a low sulphur content.<br>
The preferred iron based silicate slag used for the slag phase in the present<br>
invention has a composition which is significantly different to the calcium ferrite slag<br>
taught by Edwards et al. This is illustrated by reference to particularly preferred<br>
compositional ranges for the iron based slag shown in the following Table 1.<br><br>
While the overall ratio Fe/SiO2 is 1.14 to 2.11, it may, for example, be from 1.14<br>
to 1.55.<br>
General Description of the Accompanying Drawings<br>
In order that the invention may more readily be understood, description is<br>
directed to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br><br>
Figure 1 shows a phase equilibrium diagram relevant to the iron based<br>
silicate slags preferred for the present invention;<br>
Figure 2 is a flowsheet illustrating forms enabling continuous converting<br>
according to the present invention; and<br>
Figure 3 is a partly broken away perspective view of a top submerged<br>
injection lance reactor according to the present invention.<br>
Detailed Description of the Drawings<br>
The differences between the composition of iron based silicate slags of the<br>
present invention and calcium ferrite slags are further illustrated by Figure 1. In<br>
Figure 1 there is shown a simplified CaO - "FeOx" - SiO2 oxide system phase<br>
equilibrium diagram. It is to be understood that this is a two dimensional ternary<br>
projection of a quaternary system that includes Fe2+ and Fe3+, due to the varying<br>
levels of both Fe2+ and Fe3+ in the respective slag systems.<br>
In Figure 1, three regions of the diagram have been highlighted. The first<br>
region A is the area containing the calcium ferrite slags of Edwards et al. The<br>
region B contains the iron based silicate slags preferred for the present invention,<br>
while region C within region B contains the particularly preferred iron based<br>
silicate slags for use in the present invention.<br>
The region A, as shown in Figure 1, is constrained by the lines CaO/SiO2 =<br>
5 and CaO/SiO2 = 10 and by the lines CaO/Fe = 0.15 and CaO/Fe = 0.7.- The<br>
precise boundaries for regions B and C are yet to be fully delineated. However,<br>
current indications are that region C is bordered by the lines Fe/SiO2 =1.14 and<br>
Fe/SiO2 = 2.11, such as from 1.14 to 1.55. Overall, the region C is illustrated by<br><br><br><br>
Thus, considerable variability is possible with the iron based silicate slags used<br>
in the present invention. This can enable a specific converting operation to be based<br>
on a slag composition best suited for use with locally available fluxes, or in<br>
accordance with the level of impurities reporting in the matte to be fed to the<br>
converting process conducted in that installation.<br>
As indicated, the move to calcium ferrite slags, such as in the Mitsubishi<br>
process and followed in the proposal of Edwards et al, was in part to avoid the risk of<br>
slag foaming due to precipitation of magnetite. The calcium ferrite slags have a<br>
relatively high solubility limit for magnetite, thereby enabling them to reduce the<br>
tendency for foaming to occur. However, while iron based silicate slags have a lower<br>
solubility for magnetite, they can be used in the process of the present invention with<br>
little risk of foaming. This is believed to be due, in large part, to the requirements of<br>
the present invention for top-submerged injection. That is, that injection results in a<br>
more uniform or homogeneous slag phase in terms of agitation and of the dispersion<br>
therein of matte. Also, by not injecting gas into the blister copper phase, the present<br>
invention reduces the risk of producing a third phase comprising a slag/metal<br>
emulsion, with the risk of this triggering slag foaming.<br>
It is found that the risk of foaming is able to be further reduced in the process<br>
of the present invention by the addition of a suitable reductant operable to reduce or<br>
prevent the formation of magnetite. Lump coal is a suitable reductant, in view of its<br>
tendency to float on the slag surface, such that slag is able to circulate to the coal<br>
under the agitation generated by submerged injection. The addition of lump coal is<br>
proposed in Edwards et al. However, this is to reduce the copper content of the slag<br>
for a given sulphur content in the blister copper. It is not to reduce the risk of foaming<br>
by preventing the formation of magnetite and that risk is obviated in Edwards et al by<br>
the choice of slag.<br>
A flowsheet, illustrating the present invention in a form enabling continuous<br>
converting, is shown in Figure 2. The flowsheet shows a smelting/settling furnace 10<br>
into which copper feed is received as shown at 11. Also shown is a converting<br>
furnace 12 operable in accordance with the present invention. The smelting/settling<br>
furnace 10 can be of any type suitable for smelting copper feed, comprising a copper<br>
sulphide concentrate, to produce a copper matte product and a slag. The slag<br>
produced in furnace 10 may be discardable as shown at 14, or<br><br>
suitable for further processing. After smelting, the matte and slag are allowed to<br>
settle to enable the slag to be discharged and the matte to be passed as shown at<br>
16 to the converting furnace 12. While the smelting/settling furnace 10 can be of<br>
any suitable type, a top-submerged lancing reactor is used as furnace 12 for the<br>
converting stage.<br>
The matte produced in furnace 10 and transferred to furnace 12 may be of<br>
any grade suitable for converting to produce blister copper. It typically will range<br>
from 30% to 70% copper with various levels of Fe and S. The feed for the<br>
converting stage in furnace 12 preferably is produced from an earlier<br>
smelting/settling operation in furnace 10 in which a sufficient quantity of matte is<br>
produced to enable continuous converting over a sufficient interval of time. Thus,<br>
the matte may be stockpiled until such quantity is achieved. However, additional<br>
matte may be derived from another source.<br>
The matte feed material for converting may be fed to furnace 12 via a<br>
charging port in the roof of the top-submerged reactor comprising furnace 12, or<br>
via either a dedicated or specialised lance. The feed material need only be of a<br>
suitable size to allow it to be conveyed by the chosen feeding means, while it<br>
does not need to be dried. It is preferred that the matte feed material is<br>
granulated, for example as a product from smelting/settling furnace 10 following<br>
the smelting of concentrate. However, at least part of the matte feed material may<br>
be supplied from the smelting/settling furnace 10 in the hot, molten state.<br>
In addition, other copper containing materials, such as reverts or scrap may<br>
be charged to furnace 12 to allow efficient recovery of the contained copper. This<br>
may also be used for the control of process temperature. However, process<br>
temperature additionally or alternatively may be controlled by the addition of minor<br>
amounts of fuel, injected via the submerged lance or otherwise charged to the<br>
slag.<br>
In the process of converting matte in furnace 12, to produce blister copper<br>
output from furnace 12 as shown at 18, the Fe and S present in the matte are<br><br><br>
Thus, iron reports as iron oxide in the slag, while S reports as SO2 in the<br>
converting furnace off-gas stream.<br>
Two important factors during the converting operations are:<br>
(i) slag chemistry and copper losses to the slag, and<br>
(ii) the final quality of the blister copper.<br>
On the issue of slag chemistry, typical converting operations in Pierce-<br>
Smith converters make use of the addition of silica to promote the formation of a<br>
molten iron silicate (fayalite) slag. Iron oxidised from the matte is taken up in that<br>
slag, reducing the formation of a solid magnetite phase. In large quantity, solid<br>
magnetite phase would make the slag unworkable, and lead to high copper losses<br>
due both to physical copper entrainment in the slag and to copper solubility.<br>
As indicated herein, the present invention utilises a mode of top-<br>
submerged injection during converting in the reactor comprising furnace 12, which<br>
obviates or overcomes perceived problems with iron silicate slags which, at least<br>
in part, contributed to the move away from those slags. Thus, the present<br>
invention preferably uses an iron based silicate slag, such as of fayalite or olivine<br>
composition. As detailed above, these slags provide significant benefits.<br>
Our testwork has shown that a well controlled iron based silicate slag, such<br>
as of the fayalite type, enables acceptable levels of copper in slag. This is<br>
particularly so for slag to be recycled from furnace 12 to furnace 10, as<br>
represented by solid line 20. Irrespective of the actual level of copper in recycled<br>
slag, that contained copper may be readily recovered by further processing as<br>
described later herein. Our testwork also has shown that, as detailed earlier<br>
herein, slag foaming is able to be prevented, or at least controlled.<br>
As indicated above, blister copper product quality is of importance. The<br>
level of sulphur remaining in blister following processing is important, as too high<br>
a level requires additional processing downstream in order to remove it. An<br>
important relationship exists between the levei of S in the blister copper and the<br>
level of copper reporting to slag. These levels are related to the oxygen potential<br>
needed to remove sulphur to a desired level and the effect of over-oxidising a<br>
portion of the copper to slag as Cu2O, by reaction (4) detailed above. Results<br>
obtained in a pilot plant operation in accordance with the present invention<br>
showed that a low level of Cu in slag can be achieved together with a good level<br>
of S in blister copper, as indicated in Table 3. In each of the Examples of Table 3,<br><br>
the pilot plant operation was with a respective slag composition shown for the<br>
corresponding Example number in Table 2.<br><br>
The process of Edwards et al is characterised by the level of sulphur in the<br>
blister copper being affected by the lance tip position. This necessitates the lance<br>
tip being as close as possible to the interface between the slag and blister copper<br>
phases. With the present invention, the position of the lance tip is important, as<br>
detailed earlier herein, but is not a significant factor in achieving good quality<br>
blister product.<br>
As indicated, slag from furnace 12 may be recycled to furnace 10 to enable<br>
recovery of its copper content. However, in an alternative arrangement also<br>
shown by Figure 2, the slag from furnace 12 may be passed, as shown by broken<br>
line 22, to concentration installation 24. In installation 24, the slag received from<br>
furnace 12 can be processed in stages of slag cleaning, grinding, flotation to<br>
produce a copper concentrate and reduction smelting of the concentrate to<br>
produce a copper product at 26 and a discardable slag at 28.<br>
Figure 3 shows a top submerged lancing reactor 30 suitable for use as the<br>
reactor comprising furnace 12 of Figure 2. The reactor 30 has an upright<br>
cylindrical body having an outer shell 32 of steel and an internal refractory lining<br>
34. Reactor 12 also has an asymmetrically tapered upper portion 36 which leads<br>
to an off-take fiue 38.<br>
At an upwardly facing region of its portion 36, reactor 30 has a charging<br>
port 40 by which feed material is able to be charged into the interior 42 of the<br>
reactor. Port 40 preferably has an adjustable feeding means (not shown) which,<br>
while allowing material to be charged to reactor 30, minimises loss of reactor<br><br>
gases from interior 42 via port 40. Adjacent to port 40, reactor 30 has a tubular<br>
housing 44 through which an elongate top-submerged injecting lance 46 is<br>
inserted. Also, adjacent to its base, reactor 30 has a tapping hole 48.<br>
In use of reactor 30, the lower, discharge end of lance 46 is submerged in<br>
molten slag 50 contained within reactor 30. An oxygen-containing gas is supplied<br>
through lance 46 to generate jets 52 of oxidizing gas within slag 50 to agitate the<br>
slag. Copper sulphide matte is charged into reactor, via port 40, or entrained in<br>
the gas injected by lance 46, or by a combination of these two charging<br>
arrangements. In each case, the matte is dispersed, as lumps or granules 54,<br>
throughout the agitated slag 50. The matte 54 thus is exposed to and reacted<br>
with the oxygen content of the injected gas to form droplets of blister copper. The<br>
droplets fall through the slag 50 and collect therebelow as a continuous blister<br>
copper phase 56.<br>
During the conversion of copper sulphide matte 54 to blister copper 56,<br>
control is necessary over the vertical position of lance 46. As indicated, the lower<br>
end of lance 46 is submerged in the agitated slag phase. Thus, jets 52 issuing<br>
from the lower, discharge end of lance 46 are injected within the slag phase. In<br>
the arrangement shown, lance 46 has an angular array of outlet nozzles at its<br>
discharge end, with a respective jet 52 issuing from each outlet. The arrangement<br>
is such that the jets 52 diverge downwardly and laterally outwardly from each<br>
other. In alternative arrangements, the jets 52 need not diverge, but may simply<br>
be directed downwardly, or there may be a single jet directed either downwardly<br>
or laterally and downwardly. "In each case, the arrangement is to achieve<br>
agitation of the slag 50, dispersion of the matte 54 throughout the slag 50, and<br>
reaction of the oxygen content of the injected gas with the matte 54 to produce<br>
droplets of blister copper. However, discharge end of lance 46 within the slag<br>
phase is to be such as to preclude a substantial proportion of the injected gas<br>
from contacting the continuous blister copper phase 52.<br>
The requirement of the invention that a substantial proportion of the<br>
injected gas is precluded from contacting the continuous blister copper phase 52<br>
is such as to avoid the streams of injected gas from penetrating that continuous<br>
phase. Thus, while a minor proportion of the injected gas may sweep over the<br>
surface of the continuous blister copper phase, jets of the gas are not to pass<br>
beyond the interface between the slag phase and the continuous blister copper<br><br>
phase. Preferably the location of the lance tip is such as to completely preclude jets of<br>
injected gas from directly contacting or impinging on that interface.<br>
As will be appreciated, a flux needs to be charged to reactor 30 in order to<br>
maintain a suitable depth of slag phase and maintenance of slag oxide ratios during<br>
the course of converting reactions and to allow for periodic tapping of slag. The flux<br>
may be charged via port 40 and/or via lance 46, with or separately from the feed of<br>
copper sulphide matte.<br>
As is required in the present invention, the slag phase 50 comprises an iron<br>
based silicate slag, such as a fayalite or olivine slag. The slag may, for example, have<br>
a composition similar to that of any one of the Examples set out in Table 2. While<br>
such slags can be used with little risk of foaming, that risk can be further reduced by<br>
addition of coal to reactor 30 via port 40. The coal preferably is supplied as lumps<br>
able to float on the slag phase 50. Agitation of the slag by the injection via lance 46<br>
sufficiently causes the slag to circulate to the floating coal lumps, whereby the<br>
reducing action of the coal reduces or prevents formation of magnetite in the slag<br>
phase 50.<br>
Finally, it is to be understood that various alterations, modifications and/or<br>
additions may be introduced into the constructions and arrangements of parts<br>
previously described without departing from the spirit or ambit of the invention.<br><br>
