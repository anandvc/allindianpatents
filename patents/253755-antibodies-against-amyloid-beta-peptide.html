Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to antibodies that bind β-amyloid peptide and in<br>
particular human β-amyloid peptide. The present invention also concerns methods of<br>
treating diseases or disorders characterised by elevated β- amyloid levels or β-<br>
amyloid deposits, particularly Alzheimer's disease, with said antibodies,<br>
pharmaceutical compositions comprising said antibodies and methods of<br>
manufacture. Other aspects of the present invention will be apparent from the<br>
description below.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of age-related cognitive<br>
decline, affecting greater than 12 million individuals worldwide (Citron M (2002) Nat.<br>
Neurosci 5, Suppl 1055-1057). The earliest stages of the disease are characterized<br>
by a progressive loss of memory with associated cognitive decline and language and<br>
behavioural deficits. In the later stages of the disease, patients develop global<br>
amnesia and have greatly reduced motor function. Death typically occurs 9 years<br>
following diagnosis and is often associated with other conditions, typically pneumonia<br>
(Davis K.L. and Samules S.C. (1998) in Pharmacological Management of<br>
Neurological and Psychiatric Disorders eds Enna S.J. and Coyle J.T. (McGraw-Hill,<br>
New York pp267-316)). Current therapies represent symptomatic approaches,<br>
focussing on alleviating the cognitive impairment and ameliorating the behavioural<br>
symptoms associated with the progressing disease aetiology. In practice these<br>
treatments provide only a short lived cognitive benefit with the level of cognitive<br>
impairment reported only to last up to 2 years. The potential for a disease-modifying<br>
therapy that slows and possibly halts the progression of the disease is enormous.<br>
Such approaches would provide radical and sustained improvements to the quality of<br>
life of patients and importantly their carers as well as reducing the huge overall<br>
healthcare costs of this disease.<br>
Clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is based upon a combination of physical<br>
and mental tests which lead to a diagnosis of possible or probable Alzheimer's<br>
disease. At post mortem the disease is confirmed by well characterised neurological<br>
hallmarks in the brain, which include the deposition of Aβ in parenchymal plaques<br>
and cerebral vessels, intraneuronal formation of neurofibrillary tangles, synaptic loss<br>
and loss of neuronal subpopulations in specific brain regions (Terry, RD (1991) J<br>
Neural Trans Suppl 53 : 141-145).<br>
A plethora of genetic, histological and functional evidence suggests that the β-<br>
amyloid peptide (Aβ) is key to the progression of Alzheimer's disease (Selkoe, D. J.<br>
(2001) Physiological Reviews 81: 741-766).<br>
Aβ is known to be produced through the cleavage of the beta amyloid precursor<br>
protein (also known as APP) by an aspartyl protease enzyme known as BACE1 (also<br><br>
known as β-secretase, Asp2 or Memapsin-2) (De Strooper, B. and Konig, G. (1999)<br>
Nature 402: 471-472). In addition to the parenchymal and vascular deposition,<br>
soluble oligomeric forms of Aβ have been postulated to contribute to the onset of AD<br>
and they may affect neuronal function initially by impairing synaptic function (Lambert<br>
et. al. (1998) Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, U.S.A. 95 : 6448-<br>
6453). Although insoluble amyloid plaques are found early in AD and in MCI, the<br>
levels of soluble Aβ aggregates (referred to as oligomers or Aβ-derived diffusible<br>
ligands (ADDLs) are also increased in these individuals, and soluble Aβ levels<br>
correlate better with neurofibrillary degeneration, and the loss of synaptic markers<br>
than do amyloid plaques (Naslund et. al. (2000) J Am Med Assoc 283: 1571-1577,<br>
Younkin, S. (2001) Nat. Med. 1: 8-19). The highly amyloidogenic Aβ42 and<br>
aminoterminally truncated forms Aβx-42 are the predominant species of Aβ found in<br>
both diffuse and senile plaques (Iwatsubo, T (1994) Neuron. 13:45-53, Gravina, SA<br>
(1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270:7013-7016) The relative levels of Aβ42 appear to be the<br>
key regulator of Aβ aggregation into amyloid plaques, indeed Aβ42 has been shown<br>
to aggregate more readily that other Aβ forms in vitro (Jarrett, JT (1993)<br>
Biochemistry.32:4693-4697) and as such Aβ42 has been implicated as the initiating<br>
molecule in the pathogenesis of AD (Younkin SG, (1998) J. Physiol. (Paris). 92:289-<br>
292). Although Aβ42 is a minor product of APP metabolism, small shifts in it's<br>
production are associated with large effects on Aβ deposition therefore it has been<br>
postulated that reduction of Aβ42 alone may be an effective way of treating AD<br>
(Younkin SG, (1998) J. Physiol. (Paris). 92:289-292) In support of this, mutations in<br>
the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin genes have been reported to<br>
predominantly increase the relative levels of Aβ42 and therefore shortening the time<br>
to onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Selkoe D.J., Podlisny M.B. (2002) Annu. Rev.<br>
Genomics Hum. Gemet. 3:67-99). It should be noted however, that the rate of<br>
deposition is also dependant on catabolism and Aβ clearance.<br>
Animal models of amyloid deposition have been generated by overexpressing mutant<br>
human transgenes in mice. Mice overexpressing single human APP transgenes<br>
typically develop cerebral plaque-like β-amyloid deposits from 12 months of age<br>
(Games D. et al., (1995) Nature 373: 523-527; Hsiao K. et al., (1996) Science 274:<br>
99-102)), while mice carrying both mutant human APP and presenilin-1 (PS-1)<br>
transgenes typically develop cerebral plaque-like β-amyloid deposits as early as 2<br>
months of age (Kurt M.A. et al., (2001) Exp.NeuroJ. 171: 59-71; McGowan E. et al.,<br>
(1999) Neurolbiol. Dis. 6: 231-244.<br>
It has become increasingly apparent that the transport of exogenous Aβ between the<br>
central nervous system (CNS) and plasma plays a role in the regulation of brain<br>
amyloid levels (Shibata, et al (2000) J Clin Invest 106 : 1489-1499), with CSF Aβ<br>
being rapidly transported from CSF to plasma. Therefore active vaccination with Aβ<br>
peptides or passive administration of specific Aβ antibodies rapidly binds peripheral<br>
Aβ altering the dynamic equilibrium between the plasma, CSF and ultimately the<br>
CNS. Indeed there are now a plethora of studies demonstrated both these<br><br>
approaches can lower Aβ levels, reduce Aβ pathology and provide cognitive benefit<br>
in various transgenic models of amyloidosis. Limited studies have also been<br>
conducted in higher species. Caribbean vervet monkeys (16-10 years old) were<br>
immunised with Aβ peptide over 10 months. Aβ40 levels were elevated 2-5 fold in<br>
the plasma which peaked at 251 d while the CSF levels of Aβ340 and Aβ42 were<br>
significantly decreased by 100d and returned towards baseline thereafter. This<br>
reduction in CSF was accompanied by a significant reduction in plaque burden<br>
(Lemere, CA (2004) Am J Pathology 165 : 283-297). Similar increases in plasma Aβ<br>
levels were also detected following immunisation of aged (15-20 year old) Rhesus<br>
Monkeys (Gandy, S (2004) Alzheimer Dis Assoc Disord 18 : 44:46.<br>
The first immune therapy targeting brain amyloid was Elan/Wyeth's AN-1792, an<br>
active vaccine. This treatment was terminated following the development of clinical<br>
signs consistent with meningoencephalitis. Subgroup analyses suggested that<br>
treatment slowed the decline of cognitive function (Nature Clin Pract Neural (2005)<br>
1:84-85). Post-mortem analysis of patients also showed evidence of plaque-<br>
clearance (Gilman S. et al, (2005) Neurology 64 (9) 1553-1562). Bapineuzumab<br>
(AAB-001, Elan/Wyeth), a passive MAb therapy has been shown to significantly<br>
improve cognition scores in a small phase I safety study.<br>
Other diseases or disorders characterised by elevated p- amyloid levels or β-amyloid<br>
deposits include mild cognitive impairment (MCI, Blasko I (2006) Neurobiology of<br>
aging "Conversion from cognitive health to mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's<br>
disease: Prediction by plasma amyloid beta 42, medial temporal lobe atrophy and<br>
homocysteine" in press, e-published 19 Oct 2006), hereditary cerebral haemorrhage<br>
with β-amyloidosis of the Dutch type, cerebral β-amyloid angiopathy and various<br>
types of degenerative dementias, such as those associated with Parkinson's disease,<br>
progressive supranuclear palsy, cortical basal degeneration and diffuse Lewis body<br>
type of Alzheimer's disease (Mollenhauer B (2007) J Neural Transm e-published 23<br>
Feb 2007, van Oijen, M Lancet Neurol. 2006 5:655-60) and Down syndrome (Mehta,<br>
PD (2007) J Neural Sci. 254:22-7).<br>

Throughout this specification, the terms "CDR", "CDRL1", "CDRL2", "CDRL3",<br>
"CDRH1", "CDRH2", "CDRH3" follow the Kabat numbering system as set forth in<br>
Kabat er al; Sequences of proteins of Immunological Interest NIH, 1987. Therefore<br>

The VH3 gene family and related immunoglobulin gene nomenclature is described in<br>
Matsuda et al (Journal of Experimental Medicine, 188:2151-2162, 1998) and Lefranc<br>
&amp; Lefranc (The Immunoglobulin Factsbook. 2001. Academic Press: London).<br>
In a particular embodiment, the human heavy chain variable region originates from:<br>
•	A V gene selected from the following subset of VH3 family members: VH3-48,<br>
VH3-21, VH3-11, VH3-7, VH3-13, VH3-74, VH3-64, VH3-23, VH3-38, VH3-<br>
53, VH3-66, VH3-20, VH3-9 &amp; VH3-43<br>
•	A V gene selected from the following subset of VH3 family members: VH3-48,<br>
VH3-21 &amp;VH3-11<br>
•	The VH3-48 gene<br>
or an allele thereof.<br>
The sequence in Genbank entry M99675 is an allele of the VH3-48 gene. M99675 is<br>
a Genbank nucleotide sequence of a genomic piece of DNA including the two exons<br>
that constitute the human heavy chain gene VH3-48 (SEQ ID No:22) and encode the<br>
variable region amino acid sequence given in SEQ ID No:21. In a particular aspect<br>
the human acceptor heavy chain framework is derived from M99675.<br><br>
In order to construct a complete V-region a framework 4 has to be added to the<br>
germline encoded V-gene M99675. Suitable framework 4 sequences include that<br>
encoded by the human JH4 minigene (Kabat):<br>
YFDYWGQGTLVTVSS (SEQ ID No:23)<br>
of which the initial four residues fall within the CDR3 region which is replaced by the<br>
incoming CDR from the donor antibody.<br>
The skilled person appreciates that a germline V gene and a J gene do not include<br>
coding sequence for the entirety of heavy chain CDR3. However, in the antibodies of<br>
the invention, the CDR3 sequence is provided by the donor immunoglobulin.<br>
Accordingly, the combination of a VH gene such as VH3-48, a JH minigene such as<br>
JH4, and a set of heavy chain CDRs, such as SEQ ID No:1, SEQ ID No:2 and SEQ<br>
ID No:3 (assembled in a manner so as to mimic a mature, fully rearranged heavy<br>
chain variable region) is sufficient to define a heavy chain variable region of the<br>
invention such as that represented in SEQ ID No:26, 28, 30.<br>
The variable region encoded by Genpept ID CAA51134 has the amino acid<br>
sequence given in SEQ ID No:24.<br>
The light chain variable region framework sequence known by the GenPept ID<br>
CAA51134 is the deduced amino acid sequence of a fully rearranged light chain<br>
variable region and is identical to another amino acid sequence with the same<br>
frameworks in the database: Genpept accession number S40356, and is described in<br>
Klein, R., et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 23 (12), 3248-3262 (1993). The DNA coding<br>
sequence for CAA51134, accessible as Genbank Accesion No X72467, is given as<br>
SEQ ID No: 25.<br>
In a particular aspect of the invention the human acceptor heavy chain framework is<br>
derived from M99675 and the JH4 minigene and the human acceptor light chain<br>
framework is derived from CAA51135, optionally containing one or more, such as<br>
one to four, more particularly one to three, substitutions of amino acid residues based<br>
on the corresponding residues found in the donor VH domain having the sequence:<br>
SEQ ID No: 17 and VL domain having the sequence: SEQ ID No: 19 that maintain all<br>
or substantially all of the binding affinity of the donor antibody for β-amyloid peptide.<br>
By 'substantially all of the binding affinity' is meant that the therapeutic antibody has<br>
at most a ten-fold reduction in binding affinity compared to the donor antibody.<br>
In a more particular aspect the human acceptor heavy chain framework derived from<br>
M99675 and JH4 has one to four amino acid residue substitutions selected from<br>
positions 24, 48, 93 and/or 94 (Kabat numbering).<br><br>
In a more particular aspect of the invention the human acceptor heavy chain<br>
framework derived from M99675 and JH4 comprises the following residues (or a<br>
conservative substitute thereof):<br>
(i)<br>
Position	Residue<br>
93	V<br>
94	S<br>
or<br>
(ii)<br>
Position	Residue<br>
24	V<br>
93	V<br>
94	S<br>
or<br>
(iii)<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
1. Antibody Structures<br>
1.1 Intact Antibodies<br>
Intact antibodies are usually heteromultimeric glycoproteins comprising at least two<br>
heavy and two light chains. Aside from IgM, intact antibodies are heterotetrameric<br>
glycoproteins of approximately 150KDa, composed of two identical light (L) chains<br>
and two identical heavy (H) chains. Typically, each light chain is linked to a heavy<br>
chain by one covalent disulfide bond while the number of disulfide linkages between<br>
the heavy chains of different immunoglobulin isotypes varies. Each heavy and light<br>
chain also has intrachain disulfide bridges. Each heavy chain has at one end a<br>
variable domain (VH) followed by a number of constant regions. Each light chain has<br>
a variable domain (VL) and a constant region at its other end; the constant region of<br>
the light chain is aligned with the first constant region of the heavy chain and the light<br>
chain variable domain is aligned with the variable domain of the heavy chain. The<br>
light chains of antibodies from most vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two<br>
types called Kappa and Lambda based on the amino acid sequence of the constant<br>
region. Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant region of their heavy<br>
chains, human antibodies can be assigned to five different classes, IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG<br>
and IgM. IgG and IgA can be further subdivided into subclasses, lgG1, lgG2, lgG3<br>
and lgG4; and lgA1 and lgA2. Species variants exist with mouse and rat having at<br>
least lgG2a, lgG2b. The variable domain of the antibody confers binding specificity<br>
upon the antibody with certain regions displaying particular variability called<br>
complementarity determining regions (CDRs). The more conserved portions of the<br>
variable region are called framework regions (FR). The variable domains of intact<br>
heavy and light chains each comprise four FR connected by three CDRs. The CDRs<br>
in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FR regions and with the<br>
CDRs from the other chain contribute to the formation of the antigen binding site of<br>
antibodies. The constant regions are not directly involved in the binding of the<br>
antibody to the antigen but exhibit various effector functions such as participation in<br>
antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), phagocytosis via binding to<br>
Feγ receptor, half-life/clearance rate via neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) and<br>
complement dependent cytotoxicity via the C1q component of the complement<br>
cascade. The human lgG2 constant region lacks the ability to activate complement<br>
by the classical pathway or to mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. The<br>
lgG4 constant region lacks the ability to activate complement by the classical<br>
pathway and mediates antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity only weakly.<br>
Antibodies essentially lacking these effector functons may be termed 'non-lytic'<br>
antibodies.<br>
1.1.1 Human antibodies<br>
Human antibodies may be produced by a number of methods known to those of skill<br>
in the art. Human antibodies can be made by the hybridoma method using human<br>
myeloma or mouse-human heteromyeloma cells lines see Kozbor J.Immunol 133,<br><br>
3001, (1984) and Brodeur, Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and<br>
Applications, pp51-63 (Marcel Dekker Inc, 1987). Alternative methods include the<br>
use of phage libraries or transgenic mice both of which utilize human V region<br>
repertories (see Winter G, (1994), Annu.Rev.lmmunol 12,433-455, Green LL (1999),<br>
J.lmmunol.methods 231, 11-23).<br>
Several strains of transgenic mice are now available wherein their mouse<br>
immunoglobulin loci has been replaced with human immunoglobulin gene segments<br>
(see Tomizuka K, (2000) PNAS 97,722-727; Fishwild D.M (1996) Nature Biotechnol.<br>
14,845-851, Mendez MJ, 1997, Nature Genetics, 15,146-156). Upon antigen<br>
challenge such mice are capable of producing a repertoire of human antibodies from<br>
which antibodies of interest can be selected.<br>
Of particular note is the Trimera™ system (see Eren R et al, (1998) Immunology<br>
93:154-161) where human lymphocytes are transplanted into irradiated mice, the<br>
Selected Lymphocyte Antibody System (SLAM, see Babcook et al, PNAS (1996)<br>
93:7843-7848) where human (or other species) lymphocytes are effectively put<br>
through a massive pooled in vitro antibody generation procedure followed by<br>
deconvulated, limiting dilution and selection procedure and the Xenomouse II™<br>
(Abgenix Inc). An alternative approach is available from Morphotek Inc using the<br>
Morphodoma™ technology.<br>
Phage display technology can be used to produce human antibodies (and fragments<br>
thereof), see McCafferty; Nature, 348, 552-553 (1990) and Griffiths AD et al (1994)<br>
EMBO 13:3245-3260. According to this technique antibody V domain genes are<br>
cloned in frame into either a major or minor coat of protein gene of a filamentous<br>
bacteriophage such as M13 or fd and displayed (usually with the aid of a helper<br>
phage) as functional antibody fragments on the surface of the phage particle.<br>
Selections based on the functional properties of the antibody result in selection of the<br>
gene encoding the antibody exhibiting those properties. The phage display<br>
technique can be used to select antigen specific antibodies from libraries made from<br>
human B cells taken from individuals afflicted with a disease or disorder described<br>
above or alternatively from unimmunized human donors (see Marks; J.Mol.Bio.<br>
222,581-597,1991). Where an intact human antibody is desired comprising a Fc<br>
domain it is necessary to redone the phage displayed derived fragment into a<br>
mammalian expression vectors comprising the desired constant regions and<br>
establishing stable expressing cell lines.<br>
The technique of affinity maturation (Marks; Bio/technol 10,779-783 (1992)) may be<br>
used to improve binding affinity wherein the affinity of the primary human antibody is<br>
improved by sequentially replacing the H and L chain V regions with naturally<br>
occurring variants and selecting on the basis of improved binding affinities. Variants<br>
of this technique such as "epitope imprinting" are now also available see WO<br>
93/06213. See also Waterhouse; Nucl.Acids Res 21, 2265-2266 (1993).<br><br>
1.2 Chimaeric and Humanised Antibodies<br>
The use of intact non-human antibodies in the treatment of human diseases or<br>
disorders carries with it the now well established problems of potential<br>
immunogenicity especially upon repeated administration of the antibody that is the<br>
immune system of the patient may recognise the non-human intact antibody as non-<br>
self and mount a neutralising response. In addition to developing fully human<br>
antibodies (see above) various techniques have been developed over the years to<br>
overcome these problems and generally involve reducing the composition of non-<br>
human amino acid sequences in the intact therapeutic antibody whilst retaining the<br>
relative ease in obtaining non-human antibodies from an immunised animal e.g.<br>
mouse, rat or rabbit. Broadly two approaches have been used to achieve this. The<br>
first are chimaeric antibodies, which generally comprise a non-human (e.g. rodent<br>
such as mouse) variable domain fused to a human constant region. Because the<br>
antigen-binding site of an antibody is localised within the variable regions the<br>
chimaeric antibody retains its binding affinity for the antigen but acquires the effector<br>
functions of the human constant region and are therefore able to perform effector<br>
functions such as described supra. Chimaeric antibodies are typically produced<br>
using recombinant DNA methods. DNA encoding the antibodies (e.g. cDNA) is<br>
isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g. by using oligonucleotide<br>
probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the H and L chain<br>
variable regions of the antibody of the invention, e.g. DNA of SEQ.I.D.NO 18 and 20<br>
described supra). Hybridoma cells serve as a typical source of such DNA. Once<br>
isolated, the DNA is placed into expression vectors which are then transfected into<br>
host cells such as E.Coli, COS cells, CHO cells, PerC6 cells or myeloma cells that do<br>
not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein to obtain synthesis of the antibody.<br>
The DNA may be modified by substituting the coding sequence for human L and H<br>
chains for the corresponding non-human (e.g. murine) H and L constant regions see<br>
e.g. Morrison; PNAS 81, 6851 (1984). Thus another embodiment of the invention<br>
there is provided a chimaeric antibody comprising a VH domain having the sequence:<br>
SEQ ID No: 17 and a VL domain having the sequence: SEQ ID No: 19 fused to a<br>
human constant region (which maybe of a IgG isotype e.g. lgG1).<br>
The second approach involves the generation of humanised antibodies wherein the<br>
non-human content of the antibody is reduced by humanizing the variable regions.<br>
Two techniques for humanisation have gained popularity. The first is humanisation<br>
by CDR grafting. CDRs build loops close to the antibody's N-terminus where they<br>
form a surface mounted in a scaffold provided by the framework regions. Antigen-<br>
binding specificity of the antibody is mainly defined by the topography and by the<br>
chemical characteristics of its CDR surface. These features are in turn determined<br>
by the conformation of the individual CDRs, by the relative disposition of the CDRs,<br>
and by the nature and disposition of the side chains of the residues comprising the<br>
CDRs. A large decrease in immunogenicity can be achieved by grafting only the<br>
CDRs of a non-human (e.g. murine) antibodies ("donor" antibodies) onto a suitable<br><br>
human framework ("acceptor framework") and constant regions (see Jones et al<br>
(1986) Nature 321,522-525 and Verhoeyen M et al(1988) Science 239, 1534-1536).<br>
However, CDR grafting per se may not result in the complete retention of antigen-<br>
binding properties and it is frequently found that some framework residues of the<br>
donor antibody need to be preserved (sometimes referred to as "backmutations") in<br>
the humanised molecule if significant antigen-binding affinity is to be recovered (see<br>
Queen C et al (1989) PNAS 86, 10,029-10,033, Co, M et al(1991) Nature 351, 501-<br>
502). In this case, human V regions showing the greatest sequence homology<br>
(typically 60% or greater) to the non-human donor antibody maybe chosen from a<br>
database in order to provide the human framework (FR). The selection of human<br>
FRs can be made either from human consensus or individual human antibodies.<br>
Where necessary key residues from the donor antibody are substituted into the<br>
human acceptor framework to preserve CDR conformations. Computer modelling of<br>
the antibody maybe used to help identify such structurally important residues, see<br>
WO99/48523.<br>
Alternatively, humanisation maybe achieved by a process of "veneering". A<br>
statistical analysis of unique human and murine immunoglobulin heavy and light<br>
chain variable regions revealed that the precise patterns of exposed residues are<br>
different in human and murine antibodies, and most individual surface positions have<br>
a strong preference for a small number of different residues (see Padlan E.A. et al;<br>
(1991) Mol.lmmunol.28, 489-498 and Pedersen J.T. ef al (1994) J.Mol.Biol. 235; 959-<br>
973). Therefore it is possible to reduce the immunogenicity of a non-human Fv by<br>
replacing exposed residues in its framework regions that differ from those usually<br>
found in human antibodies. Because protein antigenicity can be correlated with<br>
surface accessibility, replacement of the surface residues may be sufficient to render<br>
the mouse variable region "invisible" to the human immune system (see also Mark<br>
G.E. et al(1994) in Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology vol.113: The<br>
pharmacology of monoclonal Antibodies, Springer-Verlag, pp105-134). This<br>
procedure of humanisation is referred to as "veneering" because only the surface of<br>
the antibody is altered, the supporting residues remain undisturbed. Further<br>
alternative approaches include that set out in WO04/006955 and the procedure of<br>
Humaneering™ (Kalobios) which makes use of bacterial expression systems and<br>
produces antibodies that are close to human germline in sequence (Alfenito-M<br>
Advancing Protein Therapeutics January 2007, San Diego.California).<br>
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the term "derived" is intended to<br>
define not only the source in the sense of it being the physical origin for the material<br>
but also to define material which is structually identical to the material but which does<br>
not originate from the reference source. Thus "residues found in the donor antibody"<br>
need not necessarily have been purified from the donor antibody.<br>
It is well recognised in the art that certain amino acid substitutions are regarded as<br>
being "conservative". Amino acids are divided into groups based on common side-<br><br><br>
chain properties and substitutions within groups that maintain all or substantially all of<br>
the binding affinity of the therapeutic antibody of the invention are regarded as<br>
conservative substitutions, see the following Table 1:<br>
1.3 Bispecific antibodies<br>
A bispecific antibody is an antibody derivative having binding specificities for at least<br>
two different epitopes and also forms part of the invention. Methods of making such<br>
antibodies are known in the art. Traditionally, the recombinant production of<br>
bispecific antibodies is based on the coexpression of two immunoglobulin H chain-L<br>
chain pairs, where the two H chains have different binding specificities see Millstein<br>
et al, Nature 305 537-539 (1983), WO93/08829 and Traunecker et al EMBO, 10,<br>
1991, 3655-3659. Because of the random assortment of H and L chains, a potential<br>
mixture of ten different antibody structures are produced of which only one has the<br>
desired binding specificity. An alternative approach involves fusing the variable<br>
domains with the desired binding specificities to heavy chain constant region<br>
comprising at least part of the hinge region, CH2 and CH3 regions. It is preferred to<br>
have the CH1 region containing the site necessary for light chain binding present in<br>
at least one of the fusions. DNA encoding these fusions, and if desired the L chain<br>
are inserted into separate expression vectors and are then cotransfected into a<br>
suitable host organism. It is possible though to insert the coding sequences for two or<br>
all three chains into one expression vector. In one preferred approach, the bispecific<br>
antibody is composed of a H chain with a first binding specificity in one arm and a H-<br>
L chain pair, providing a second binding specificity in the other arm, see<br>
WO94/04690. See also Suresh et al Methods in Enzymology 121, 210, 1986.<br>
Delivery of therapeutic proteins to the brain has been hampered by the presence of<br>
the blood brain barrier (BBB). Where it is desired to deliver an antibody of the<br>
invention or antibody fragment of the invention across the BBB various strategies<br>
have been proposed to enhance such delivery where needed.<br>
In order to obtain required nutrients and factors from the blood, the BBB posseses<br>
some specific receptors, which transport compounds from the circulating blood to the<br>
brain. Studies have indicated that some compounds like insulin (see Duffy KR et al<br>
(1989) Brain Res. 420:32-38), transferin (see Fishman JB et al (1987) J.Neurosci<br>
18:299-304) and insulin like growth factors 1 and 2 (see Pardridge WM (1986)<br><br>
Endocrine Rev.7:314-330 and Duffy KR et al (1986) Metabolism 37:136-140)<br>
traverse the BBB via receptor-mediated transcytosis. Receptors for these molecules<br>
thus provide a potential means for therapeutic antibodies of the invention to access<br>
the brain using so -called "vectored" antibodies (see Pardridge WM (1999)<br>
Advanced Drug Delivery Review 36:299-321). For example, an antibody to<br>
transferrin receptor has been shown to be dynamically transported into the brain<br>
parenchyma (see Friden PM et al(1991) PNAS 88:4771-4775 and Friden PM et al<br>
(1993) Science 259:373-377). Thus one potential approach is to produce a<br>
bispecific antibody or bispecific fragment such as described supra wherein a first<br>
specificity is towards and a second specificity towards a transport receptor located at<br>
the BBB e.g. a second specificity towards the transferrin transport receptor.<br>
1.4 Antibody Fragments<br>
In certain embodiments of the invention there is provided therapeutic antibody which<br>
is an antigen binding fragment. Such fragments may be functional antigen binding<br>
fragments of intact and/or humanised and/or chimaeric antibodies such as Fab, Fd,<br>
Fab1, F(ab')2, Fv, ScFv fragments of the antibodies described supra. Fragments<br>
lacking the constant region lack the ability to activate complement by the classical<br>
pathway or to mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Traditionally such<br>
fragments are produced by the proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies by e.g.<br>
papain digestion (see for example, WO 94/29348) but may be produced directly from<br>
recombinantly transformed host cells. For the production of ScFv, see Bird et al;(<br>
1988) Science, 242, 423-426. In addition, antibody fragments may be produced using<br>
a variety of engineering techniques as described below.<br>
Fv fragments appear to have lower interaction energy of their two chains than Fab<br>
fragments. To stablise the association of the VH and VL domains, they have been<br>
linked with peptides (Bird et al, (1988) Science 242, 423-426, Huston et al, PNAS,<br>
85, 5879-5883), disulphide bridges (Glockshuber et al, (1990) Biochemistry, 29,<br>
1362-1367) and "knob in hole" mutations (Zhu et al (1997), Protein Sci., 6, 781-788).<br>
ScFv fragments can be produced by methods well known to those skilled in the art<br>
see Whitlow et al (1991) Methods companion Methods Enzymol, 2,97-105 and<br>
Huston et al(1993) Int.Rev.Immunol 10, 195-217. ScFv may be produced in<br>
bacterial cells such as E.Coli but are more typically produced in eukaryotic cells.<br>
One disadvantage of ScFv is the monovalency of the product, which precludes an<br>
increased avidity due to polyvalent binding, and their short half-life. Attempts to<br>
overcome these problems include bivalent (ScFv')2 produced from ScFV containing<br>
an additional C terminal cysteine by chemical coupling ( Adams et al (1993)<br>
Can.Res 53, 4026-4034 and McCartney et al (1995) Protein Eng. 8, 301-314) or by<br>
spontaneous site-specific dimerization of ScFv containing an unpaired C terminal<br>
cysteine residue (see Kipriyanov et al(1995) Cell. Biophys 26, 187-204).<br>
Alternatively, ScFv can be forced to form multimers by shortening the peptide linker<br>
to between 3 to 12 residues to form "diabodies", see Holliger et al PNAS (1993), 90,<br>
6444-6448. Reducing the linker still further can result in ScFV trimers ("triabodies",<br><br>
see Kortt et al (1997) Protein Eng, 10,423-433) and tetramers ("tetrabodies", see Le<br>
Gall et al (1999) FEBS Lett, 453,164-168). Construction of bivalent ScFV molecules<br>
can also be achieved by genetic fusion with protein dimerizing motifs to form<br>
"miniantibodies" (see Pack et al (1992) Biochemistry 31, 1579-1584) and<br>
"minibodies" (see Hu ef al (1996), Cancer Res. 56, 3055-3061). ScFv-Sc-Fv<br>
tandems ((ScFV)2) may also be produced by linking two ScFv units by a third peptide<br>
linker, see Kurucz et al (1995) J. Immol. 154,4576-4582. Bispecific diabodies can be<br>
produced through the noncovalent association of two single chain fusion products<br>
consisting of VH domain from one antibody connected by a short linker to the VL<br>
domain of another antibody, see Kipriyanov et al (1998), Int.J.Can 77,763-772. The<br>
stability of such bispecific diabodies can be enhanced by the introduction of<br>
disulphide bridges or "knob in hole" mutations as described supra or by the formation<br>
of single chain diabodies (ScDb) wherein two hybrid ScFv fragments are connected<br>
through a peptide linker see Konterrnann et al (1999) J.lmmunol.Methods 226 179-<br>
188. Tetravalent bispecific molecules are available by e.g. fusing a ScFv fragment to<br>
the CH3 domain of an IgG molecule or to a Fab fragment through the hinge region<br>
see Coloma et al (1997) Nature Biotechnol. 15,159-163. Alternatively, tetravalent<br>
bispecific molecules have been created by the fusion of bispecific single chain<br>
diabodies (see Alt et al, (1999) FEBS Lett 454, 90-94. Smaller tetravalent bispecific<br>
molecules can also be formed by the dimerization of either ScFv-ScFv tandems with<br>
a linker containing a helix-loop-helix motif (DiBi miniantibodies, see Muller et al<br>
(1998) FEBS Lett 432, 45-49) or a single chain molecule comprising four antibody<br>
variable domains (VH and VL) in an orientation preventing intramolecular pairing<br>
(tandem diabody, see Kipriyanov et al, (1999) J.Mol.Biol. 293, 41-56). Bispecific<br>
F(ab')2 fragments can be created by chemical coupling of Fab1 fragments or by<br>
heterodimerization through leucine zippers (see Shalaby et al, (1992) J.Exp.Med.<br>
175, 217-225 and Kostelny et a/(1992), J.Immunol. 148, 1547-1553). Also available<br>
are isolated VH and VL domains, see US 6, 248,516; US 6,291,158; US 6, 172,197.<br>
1.5	Heteroconjuqate antibodies<br>
Heteroconjugate antibodies are derivatives which also form an embodiment of the<br>
present invention. Heteroconjugate antibodies are composed of two covalently<br>
joined antibodies formed using any convenient cross-linking methods. See US<br>
4,676,980.<br>
1.6	Other Modifications.<br>
The interaction between the Fc region of an antibody and various Fc receptors<br>
(FcγR) is believed to mediate the effector functions of the antibody which include<br>
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), fixation of complement,<br>
phagocytosis and half-life/clearance of the antibody. Various modifications to the Fc<br>
region of antibodies of the invention may be carried out depending on the desired<br>
effector property. In particular, human constant regions which essentially lack the<br>
functions of a) activation of complement by the classical pathway; and b) mediating<br>
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity include the lgG4 constant region, the lgG2<br><br>
constant region and lgG1 constant regions containing specific mutations as for<br>
example mutatbns at positions 234, 235, 236, 237, 297, 318, 320 and/or 322<br>
disclosed in EP0307434 (WO8807089), EP 0629 240 (WO9317105) and WO<br>
2004/014953. Mutations at residues 235 or 237 within the CH2 domain of the heavy<br>
chain constant region (Kabat numbering; EU Index system) have separately been<br>
described to reduce binding to FcγRI, FcγRII and FcγRIII binding and therefore<br>
reduce antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) (Duncan et al. Nature 1988,<br>
332; 563-564; Lund et al. J. Immunol. 1991, 147; 2657-2662; Chappel et al. PNAS<br>
1991, 88; 9036-9040; Burton and Woof, Adv. Immunol. 1992, 51;1-84; Morgan et al.,<br>
Immunology 1995, 86; 319-324; Hezareh et a!., J. Virol. 2001, 75 (24); 12161-<br>
12168). Further, some reports have also described involvement of some of these<br>
residues in recruiting or mediating complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC)<br>
(Morgan et al., 1995; Xu et al., Cell. Immunol. 2000; 200:16-26; Hezareh et al., J.<br>
Virol. 2001, 75 (24); 12161-12168). Residues 235 and 237 have therefore both been<br>
mutated to alanine residues (Brett et al. Immunology 1997, 91; 346-353;<br>
Bartholomew et al. Immunology 1995, 85; 41-48; and WO9958679) to reduce both<br>
complement mediated and FcγR-mediated effects. Antibodies comprising these<br>
constant regions may be termed 'non-lytic' antibodies.<br>
One may incorporate a salvage receptor binding epitope into the antibody to increase<br>
serum half life see US 5,739,277.<br>
There are five currently recognised human Feγ receptors, FcγR (I), FcγRlla, FcγRllb,<br>
FcγRllla and neonatal FcRn. Shields et al, (2001) J.Biol.Chem 276, 6591-6604<br>
demonstrated that a common set of lgG1 residues is involved in binding all FcγRs,<br>
while FcγRII and FcγRIII utilize distinct sites outside of this common set. One group<br>
of lgG1 residues reduced binding to all FcγRs when altered to alanine: Pro-238, Asp-<br>
265, Asp-270, Asn-297 and Pro-239. All are in the IgG CH2 domain and clustered<br>
near the hinge joining CH1 and CH2. While FcγRI utilizes only the common set of<br>
lgG1 residues for binding, FcγRII and FcγRIII interact with distinct residues in addition<br>
to the common set. Alteration of some residues reduced binding only to FcγRII (e.g.<br>
Arg-292) or FcγRIII (e.g. Glu-293). Some variants showed improved binding to<br>
FcγRII or FcγRIII but did not affect binding to the other receptor (e.g. Ser-267Ala<br>
improved binding to FcγRII but binding to FcγRIII was unaffected). Other variants<br>
exhibited improved binding to FcγRII or FcγRIH with reduction in binding to the other<br>
receptor (e.g. Ser-298Ala improved binding to FcγRIII and reduced binding to FcγRII).<br>
For FcγRllla, the best binding lgG1 variants had combined alanine substitutions at<br>
Ser-298, Glu-333 and Lys-334. The neonatal FcRn receptor is believed to be<br>
involved in protecting IgG molecuies from degradation and thus enhancing serum<br>
half life and the transcytosis across tissues (see Junghans R.P (1997) Immunol.Res<br>
16. 29-57 and Ghetie ef al (2000) Annu.Rev.lmmunol. 18, 739-766). Human lgG1<br>
residues determined to interact directly with human FcRn includes Ile253, Ser254,<br>
Lys288, Thr307, Gln311, Asn434 and His435.<br><br>
The therapeutic antibody of the invention may incorporate any of the above constant<br>
region modifications.<br>
In a particular embodiment, the therapeutic antibody essentially lacks the functions of<br>
a) activation of complement by the classical pathway; and b) mediating antibody-<br>
dependent cellular cytotoxicity. In a more particular embodiment the present<br>
invention provides therapeutic antibodies of the invention having any one (or more) of<br>
the residue changes detailed above to modify half-life/clearance and/or effector<br>
functions such as ADCC and/or complement dependent cytotoxicity and/or<br>
complement lysis.<br>
In a further aspect of the present invention the therapeutic antibody has a constant<br>
region of isotype human lgG1 with alanine (or other disrupting) substitutions at<br>
positions 235 (e.g. L235A) and 237 (e.g. G237A) (numbering according to the EU<br>
scheme outlined in Kabat.<br>
Other derivatives of the invention include glycosylation variants of the antibodies of<br>
the invention. Glycosylation of antibodies at conserved positions in their constant<br>
regions is known to have a profound effect on antibody function, particularly effector<br>
functioning such as those described above, see for example, Boyd et al (1996),<br>
Mol. Immunol. 32,1311-1318. Glycosylation variants of the therapeutic antibodies of<br>
the present invention wherein one or more carbohydrate moiety is added,<br>
substituted, deleted or modified are contemplated. Introduction of an asparagine-X-<br>
serine or asparagine-X-threonine motif creates a potential site for enzymatic<br>
attachment of carbonhydrate moieties and may therefore be used to manipulate the<br>
glycosylation of an antibody. In Raju et al (2001) Biochemistry 40, 8868-8876 the<br>
terminal sialyation of a TNFR-IgG immunoadhesin was increased through a process<br>
of regalactosylation and/or resialylation using beta-1, 4-galactosyltransferace and/or<br>
alpha, 2,3 sialyltransferase. Increasing the terminal sialylation is believed to increase<br>
the half-life of the immunoglobulin. Antibodies, in common with most glycoproteins,<br>
are typically produced in nature as a mixture of glycoforms. This mixture is<br>
particularly apparent when antibodies are produced in eukaryotic, particularly<br>
mammalian cells. A variety of methods have been developed to manufacture defined<br>
glycoforms, see Zhang ef al Science (2004), 303, 371, Sears et al, Science, (2001)<br>
291, 2344, Wacker et al (2002) Science, 298 1790, Davis et al (2002) Chem.Rev.<br>
102, 579, Hang et a/(2001) Acc.Chem.Res 34, 727. Thus the invention concerns a<br>
plurality of therapeutic antibodies (which maybe of the IgG isotype, e.g. lgG1) as<br>
described herein comprising a defined number (e.g. 7 or less, for example 5 or less<br>
such as two or a single) glycoform(s) of said antibodies.<br>
Derivatives according to the invention also include therapeutic antibodies of the<br>
invention coupled to a non-proteinaeous polymer such as polyethylene glycol (PEG),<br>
polypropylene glycol or polyoxyalkylene. Conjugation of proteins to PEG is an<br>
established technique for increasing half-life of proteins, as well as reducing<br><br>
antigenicity and immunogenicity of proteins. The use of PEGylation with different<br>
molecular weights and styles (linear or branched) has been investigated with intact<br>
antibodies as well as Fab' fragments, see Koumenis I.L et al (2000)<br>
Int.J.Pharmaceut. 198:83-95. A particular embodiment comprises an antigen-binding<br>
fragment of the invention without the effector functions of a) activation of complement<br>
by the classical pathway; and b) mediating antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity;<br>
(such as a Fab fragment or a scFv) coupled to PEG.<br>
2. Production Methods<br>
Antibodies of the present invention may be produced in transgenic organisms such<br>
as goats (see Pollock ef al (1999), J. Immunol. Methods 231:147-157), chickens (see<br>
Morrow KJJ (2000) Genet.Eng.News 20:1-55), mice (see Pollock et al ibid) or plants<br>
(see Doran PM, (2000) Curr.Opinion Biotechnol. 11,199-204, Ma JK-C (1998),<br>
Nat.Med. 4; 601-606, Baez J et al, BioPharm (2000) 13: 50-54, Stoger E et al; (2000)<br>
Plant Mol.Biol. 42:583-590). Antibodies may also be produced by chemical synthesis.<br>
However, antibodies of the invention are typically produced using recombinant cell<br>
culturing technology well known to those skilled in the art. A polynucleotide encoding<br>
the antibody is isolated and inserted into a replicable vector such as a plasmid for<br>
further propagation or expression in a host cell. One useful expression system is a<br>
glutamate synthetase system {such as sold by Lonza Biologies), particularly where<br>
the host cell is CHO or NSO (see below). Polynucleotide encoding the antibody is<br>
readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g. oligonucleotide<br>
probes). Vectors that may be used include plasmid, virus, phage, transposons,<br>
minichromsomes of which plasmids are a typical embodiment. Generally such<br>
vectors further include a signal sequence, origin of replication, one or more marker<br>
genes, an enhancer element, a promoter and transcription termination sequences<br>
operably linked to the light and/or heavy chain polynucleotide so as to facilitate<br>
expression. Polynucleotide encoding the light and heavy chains may be inserted into<br>
separate vectors and introduced (e.g. by transformation, transfection, electroporation<br>
or transduction) into the same host cell concurrently or sequentially or, if desired both<br>
the heavy chain and light chain can be inserted into the same vector prior to such<br>
introduction.<br>
It will be immediately apparent to those skilled in the art that due to the redundancy<br>
of the genetic code, alternative polynucleotides to those disclosed herein are also<br>
available that will encode the polypeptides of the invention.<br>
2.1 Signal sequences<br>
Antibodies of the present invention maybe produced as a fusion protein with a<br>
heterologous signal sequence having a specific cleavage site at the N terminus of the<br>
mature protein. The signal sequence should be recognised and processed by the<br>
host cell. For prokaryotic host cells, the signal sequence may be an alkaline<br>
phosphatase, penicillinase, or heat stable enterotoxin II leaders. For yeast secretion<br><br>
the signal sequences may be a yeast invertase leader, a factor leader or acid<br>
phosphatase leaders see e.g. WO90/13646. In mammalian cell systems, viral<br>
secretory leaders such as herpes simplex gD signal and native immunoglobulin<br>
signal sequences (such as human Ig heavy chain) are available. Typically the signal<br>
sequence is ligated in reading frame to polynucleotide encoding the antibody of the<br>
invention.<br>
2.2	Origin of replication<br>
Origin of replications are well known in the art with pBR322 suitable for most gram-<br>
negative bacteria, 2μ plasmid for most yeast and various viral origins such as SV40,<br>
polyoma, adenovirus, VSV or BPV for most mammalian cells. Generally the SV40<br>
origin of replication component is not needed for integrated mammalian expression<br>
vectors. However the SV40 ori may be included since it contains the early promoter.<br>
2.3	Selection marker<br>
Typical selection genes encode proteins that (a) confer resistance to antibiotics or<br>
other toxins e.g. ampicillin, neomycin, methotrexate or tetracycline or (b) complement<br>
auxotrophic deficiencies or supply nutrients not available in the complex media or (c)<br>
combinations of both. The selection scheme may involve arresting growth of the host<br>
cells that contain no vector or vectors. Cells, which have been successfully<br>
transformed with the genes encoding the therapeutic antibody of the present<br>
invention, survive due to e.g. drug resistance conferred by the co-delivered selection<br>
marker. One example is the DHFR-selection system wherein transformants are<br>
generated in DHFR negative host strains (eg see Page and Sydenham 1991<br>
Biotechnology 9: 64-68). In this system the DHFR gene is co-delivered with antibody<br>
polynucleotide sequences of the invention and DHFR positive cells then selected by<br>
nucleoside withdrawal. If required, the DHFR inhibitor methotrexate is also employed<br>
to select for transformants with DHFR gene amplification. By operably linking DHFR<br>
gene to the antibody coding sequences of the invention or functional derivatives<br>
thereof, DHFR gene amplification results in concomitant amplification of the desired<br>
antibody sequences of interest. CHO cells are a particularly useful cell line for this<br>
DHFR/methotrexate selection and methods of amplifying and selecting host cells<br>
using the DHFR system are well established in the art see Kaufman R.J. et al<br>
J.Mol.Biol. (1982) 159, 601-621, for review, see Werner RG, Noe W, Kopp<br>
K.Schluter M," Appropriate mammalian expression systems for biopharmaceuticals",<br>
Arzneimittel-Forschung. 48(8):870-80, 1998 Aug. A further example is the glutamate<br>
synthetase expression system (Bebbington et al Biotechnology 1992 Vol 10 p169). A<br>
suitable selection gene for use in yeast is the trp1 gene; see Stinchcomb et al Nature<br>
282, 38, 1979.<br>
2.4	Promoters<br>
Suitable promoters for expressing antibodies of the invention are operably linked to<br>
DNA/polynucleotide encoding the antibody. Promoters for prokaryotic hosts include<br>
phoA promoter, Beta-lactamase and lactose promoter systems, alkaline<br><br>
phosphatase, tryptophan and hybrid promoters such as Tac. Promoters suitable for<br>
expression in yeast cells include 3-phosphoglycerate kinase or other glycolytic<br>
enzymes e.g. enolase, glyceralderhyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase, hexokinase,<br>
pyruvate decarboxylase, phosphofructokinase, glucose 6 phosphate isomerase, 3-<br>
phosphoglycerate mutase and glucokinase. Inducible yeast promoters include<br>
alcohol dehydrogenase 2, isocytochrome C, acid phosphatase, met allothionein and<br>
enzymes responsible for nitrogen metabolism or maltose/galactose utilization.<br>
Promoters for expression in mammalian cell systems include RNA polymerase II<br>
promoters including viral promoters such as polyoma, fowlpox and adenoviruses<br>
(e.g. adenovirus 2), bovine papilloma virus, avian sarcoma virus, cytomegalovirus (in<br>
particular the immediate early gene promoter), retrovirus, hepatitis B virus, actin, rous<br>
sarcoma virus (RSV) promoter and the early or late Simian virus 40 and non-viral<br>
promoters such as EF-1 alpha (Mizushima and Nagata Nucleic Acids Res 1990<br>
18(17):5322. The choice of promoter may be based upon suitable compatibility with<br>
the host cell used for expression.<br>
2.5	Enhancer element<br>
Where appropriate, e.g. for expression in higher eukaroytics, additional enhancer<br>
elements can included instead of or as well as those found located in the promoters<br>
described above. Suitable mammalian enhancer sequences include enhancer<br>
elements from globin, elastase, albumin, fetoprotein, met allothionine and insulin.<br>
Alternatively, one may use an enhancer element from a eukaroytic cell virus such as<br>
SV40 enhancer, cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer, polyoma enhancer,<br>
baculoviral enhancer or murine lgG2a locus (see WO04/009823). Whilst such<br>
enhancers are typically located on the vector at a site upstream to the promoter, they<br>
can also be located elsewhere e.g. within the untranslated region or downstream of<br>
the polydenalytion signal. The choice and positioning of enhancer may be based<br>
upon suitable compatibility with the host cell used for expression..<br>
2.6	Polyadenylation/Termination<br>
In eukaryotic systems, polyadenylation signals are operably linked to polynucleotide<br>
encoding the antibody of this invention. Such signals are typically placed 3' of the<br>
open reading frame. In mammalian systems, non-limiting example signals include<br>
those derived from growth hormones, elongation factor-1 alpha and viral (eg SV40)<br>
genes or retroviral long terminal repeats. In yeast systems non-limiting examples of<br>
polydenylation/termination signals include those derived from the phosphoglycerate<br>
kinase (PGK) and the alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (ADH) genes. In prokaryotic system<br>
polyadenyiation signals are typically not required and it is instead usual to employ<br>
shorter and more defined terminator sequences. The choice of<br>
polyadenylation/termination sequences may be based upon suitable compatibility<br>
with the host cell used for expression<br>
2.7	Other methods/elements for enhanced yields<br><br>
In addition to the above, other features that can be employed to enhance yields<br>
include chromatin remodelling elements, introns and host-cell specific codon<br>
modification. The codon useage of the antibody of this invention thereof can be<br>
modified to accommodate codon bias of the host cell such to augment transcript<br>
and/or product yield (eg Hoekema A et al Mol Cell Biol 1987 7(8):2914-24). The<br>
choice of codons may be based upon suitable compatibility with the host cell used for<br>
expression.<br>
2.8 Host ceils<br>
Suitable host cells for cloning or expressing vectors encoding antibodies of the<br>
invention are prokaroytic, yeast or higher eukaryotic cells. Suitable prokaryotic cells<br>
include eubacteria e.g. enterobacteriaceae such as Escherichia e.g. E.Coli (for<br>
example ATCC 31,446; 31,537; 27,325), Enterobacter, Erwinia, Klebsiella Proteus,<br>
Salmonella e.g. Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia e.g. Serratia marcescans and<br>
Shigella as well as Bacilli such as B.subtilis and B.licheniformis (see DD 266 710),<br>
Pseudomonas such as P.aeruginosa and Streptomyces. Of the yeast host cells,<br>
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, schizosaccharomyces pombe, Kluyveromyces (e.g.<br>
ATCC 16,045; 12,424; 24178; 56,500), yarrowia (EP402, 226), Pichia Pastoris<br>
(EP183, 070, see also Peng et al J.Biotechnol. 108 (2004) 185-192), Candida,<br>
Trichoderma reesia (EP244, 234j, Penicillin, Tolypocladium and Aspergillus hosts<br>
such as A.nidulans and A.niger are also contemplated.<br>
Although Prokaryotic and yeast host cells are specifically contemplated by the<br>
invention, typically however, host cells of the present invention are vertebrate cells.<br>
Suitable vertebrate host cells include mammalian cells such as COS-1 (ATCC<br>
No.CRL 1650) COS-7 (ATCC CRL 1651), human embryonic kidney line 293,, PerC6<br>
(Crucell), baby hamster kidney cells (BHK) (ATCC CRL1632), BHK570 (ATCC NO:<br>
CRL 10314), 293 (ATCC NO.CRL 1573), Chinese hamster ovary cells CHO (e.g.<br>
CHO-K1, ATCC NO: CCL 61, DHFR minus CHO cell line such as DG44 (Uriaub et<br>
al, Somat Cell Mol Genet (1986) Vol 12 pp555-566), particularly those CHO cell lines<br>
adapted for suspension culture, mouse Sertoli cells, monkey kidney cells, African<br>
green monkey kidney cells (ATCC CRL-1587), HELA cells, canine kidney cells<br>
(ATCC CCL 34), human lung cells (ATCC CCL 75), Hep G2 and myeloma or<br>
lymphoma cells e.g. NSO (see US 5,807,715), Sp2/0, YO.<br>
Thus in one embodiment of the invention there is provided a stably transformed host<br>
cell comprising a vector encoding a heavy chain and/or light chain of the therapeutic<br>
antibody as described herein. Typically such host cells comprise a first vector<br>
encoding the light chain and a second vector encoding said heavy chain.<br>
Such host cells may also be further engineered or adapted to modify quality, function<br>
and/or yield of the antibody of this invention . Non-limiting examples include<br>
expression of specific modifying (eg glycosylation) enzymes and protein folding<br>
chaperones.<br><br>
2.9 Cell Culturinq Methods.<br>
Host cells transformed with vectors encoding the therapeutic antibodies of the<br>
invention may be cultured by any method known to those skilled in the art. Host cells<br>
may be cultured in spinner flasks, shake flasks, roller bottles, wave reactors (eg<br>
System 1000 from wavebiotech.com) or hollow fibre systems but it is preferred for<br>
large scale production that stirred tank reactors or bag reactors (eg Wave Biotech,<br>
Somerset, New Jersey USA) are used particularly for suspension cultures. Typically<br>
the stirred tankers are adapted for aeration using e.g. spargers, baffles or low shear<br>
impellers. For bubble columns and airlift reactors direct aeration with air or oxygen<br>
bubbles maybe used. Where the host cells are cultured in a serum free culture<br>
media this can be supplemented with a cell protective agent such as pluronic F-68 to<br>
help prevent cell damage as a result of the aeration process. Depending on the host<br>
cell characteristics, either microcarriers maybe used as growth substrates for<br>
anchorage dependent cell lines or the cells maybe adapted to suspension culture<br>
(which is typical). The culturing of host cells, particularly vertebrate host cells may<br>
utilise a variety of operational modes such as batch, fed-batch, repeated batch<br>
processing (see Drapeau et al (1994) cytotechnology 15: 103-109), extended batch<br>
process or perfusion culture. Although recombinantly transformed mammalian host<br>
cells may be cultured in serum-containing media such media comprising fet al calf<br>
serum (FCS), it is preferred that such host cells are cultured in serum -free media<br>
such as disclosed in Keen et al (1995) Cytotechnology 17:153-163, or commercially<br>
available media such as ProCHO-CDM or UltraCHO™ (Cambrex NJ, USA),<br>
supplemented where necessary with an energy source such as glucose and<br>
synthetic growth factors such as recombinant insulin. The serum-free culturing of<br>
host cells may require that those cells are adapted to grow in serum free conditions.<br>
One adaptation approach is to culture such host cells in serum containing media and<br>
repeatedly exchange 80% of the culture medium for the serum-free media so that the<br>
host cells learn to adapt in serum free conditions (see e.g. Scharfenberg K et al<br>
(1995) in Animal Cell technology: Developments towards the 21st century (Beuvery<br>
E.C. et a/eds), pp619-623, Kluwer Academic publishers).<br>
Antibodies of the invention secreted into the media may be recovered and purified<br>
from the media using a variety of techniques to provide a degree of purification<br>
suitable for the intended use. For example the use of therapeutic antibodies of the<br>
invention for the treatment of human patients typically mandates at least 95% purity<br>
as determined by reducing SDS-PAGE, more typically 98% or 99% purity, when<br>
compared to the culture media comprising the therapeutic antibodies. In the first<br>
instance, cell debris from the culture media is typically removed using centrifugation<br>
followed by a clarification step of the supernatant using e.g. microfiltration,<br>
ultrafiltration and/or depth filtration. Alternatively, the antibody can be harvested by<br>
microfiltration, ultrafiltration or depth filtration without prior centrifugation. A variety of<br>
other techniques such as dialysis and gel electrophoresis and chromatographic<br>
techniques such as hydroxyapatite (HA), affinity chromatography (optionally involving<br><br>
an affinity tagging system such as polyhistidine) and/or hydrophobic interaction<br>
chromatography (HIC, see US 5,429,746) are available. In one embodiment, the<br>
antibodies of the invention, following various clarification steps, are captured using<br>
Protein A or G affinity chromatography followed by further chromatography steps<br>
such as ion exchange and/or HA chromatography, anion or cation exchange, size<br>
exclusion chromatography and ammonium sulphate precipitation. Typically, various<br>
virus removal steps are also employed (e.g. nanofiltration using e.g. a DV-20 filter).<br>
Following these various steps, a purified (typically monoclonal) preparation<br>
comprising at least 10mg/ml or greater e.g. 100mg/ml or greater of the antibody of<br>
the invention is provided and therefore forms an embodiment of the invention.<br>
Concentration to 100mg/ml or greater can be generated by ultracentrifugation.<br>
Suitably such preparations are substantially free of aggregated forms of antibodies of<br>
the invention.<br>
Bacterial systems are particularly suited for the expression of antibody fragments.<br>
Such fragments are localised intracellularly or within the periplasma. Insoluble<br>
periplasmic proteins can be extracted and refolded to form active proteins according<br>
to methods known to those skilled in the art, see Sanchez et al (1999) J.Biotechnol.<br>
72, 13-20 and Cupit PM et al (1999) Lett Appl Microbiol, 29, 273-277.<br>
3. Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
Purified preparations of antibodies of the invention (particularly monoclonal<br>
preparations) as described supra, may be incorporated into pharmaceutical<br>
compositions for use in the treatment of human diseases and disorders such as<br>
those outlined above. Typically such compositions further comprise a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable (i.e. inert) carrier as known and called for by acceptable<br>
pharmaceutical practice, see e.g. Remingtons Pharmaceutical Sciences, 16th ed,<br>
(1980), Mack Publishing Co. Examples of such carriers include sterilised carrier<br>
such as saline, Ringers solution or dextrose solution, buffered with suitable buffers<br>
such as sodium acetate trihydrate to a pharmaceutically acceptable pH, such as a pH<br>
within a range of 5 to 8. Pharmaceutical compositons for injection (e.g. by<br>
intravenous, intraperitoneal, intradermal, subcutaneous, intramuscular or intraportal)<br>
or continuous infusion are suitably free of visible particulate matter and may comprise<br>
from 1mg to 10g of therapeutic antibody, typically 5mg to 1g, more specifically 5mg<br>
to 25mg or 50mg of antibody. Methods for the preparation of such pharmaceutical<br>
compositions are well known to those skilled in the art. In one embodiment,<br>
pharmaceutical compositions comprise from 1mg to 10g of therapeutic antibodies of<br>
the invention in unit dosage form, optionally together with instructions for use.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be iyophilised (freeze dried) for<br>
reconstitution prior to administration according to methods well known or apparent to<br>
those skilled in the art. Where embodiments of the invention comprise antibodies of<br>
the invention with an lgG1 isotype, a chelator of met al ions including copper, such as<br>
citrate (e.g. sodium citrate) or EDTA or histidine, may be added to the<br>
pharmaceutical composition to reduce the degree of met al-mediated degradation of<br><br>
antibodies of this isotype, see EP0612251. Pharmaceutical compositions may also<br>
comprise a solubiliser such as arginine base, a detergent/anti-aggregation agent<br>
such as polysorbate 80, and an inert gas such as nitrogen to replace vial headspace<br>
oxygen.<br>
Effective doses and treatment regimes for administering the antibody of the invention<br>
are generally determined empirically and are dependent on factors such as the age,<br>
weight and health status of the patient and disease or disorder to be treated. Such<br>
factors are within the purview of the attending physican. Guidance in selecting<br>
appropriate doses may be found in e.g. Smith et al (1977) Antibodies in human<br>
diagnosis and therapy, Raven Press, New York but will in general be 1mg to 10g. In<br>
one embodiment, the dosing regime for treating a human patient is 1mg to 1g of<br>
therapeutic antibody of the invention administered subcutaneously once per week or<br>
every two weeks, or by intravenous infusion every 1 or 2 months. Such a dosage<br>
corresponds to 0.014-140mg/kg, such as 0.014-14mg/kg. Compositions of the<br>
present invention may also be used prophylatically.<br>
4. Clinical uses.<br>
It will be appreciated that diseases characterised by elevated β-amyloid levels or β-<br>
amyloid deposits include Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, Down's<br>
syndrome, hereditary cerebral haemorrhage with β-amyloidosis of the Dutch type,<br>
cerebral β-amyloid angiopathy and various types of degenerative dementias, such as<br>
those associated with Parkinson's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, cortical<br>
basal degeneration and diffuse Lewis body type of Alzheimer's disease.<br>
Most preferably, the disease characterised by elevated β-amyloid levels or β-amyloid<br>
deposits is Alzheimer's disease.<br>
Although the present invention has been described principally in relation to the<br>
treatment of human diseases or disorders, the present invention may also have<br>
applications in the treatment of similar diseases or disorders in non-human<br>
mammals.<br><br>

Generation of mouse monoclonal antibody 2E7<br>
Mouse monoclonal antibody 2E7 was generated from a conventional immunisation of<br>
mice. Mice were immunised with soluble or aggregated β-amyloid 1-40 and 1-42<br>
formulated in Freund's adjuvant. Following final boost without adjuvant, splenocytes<br>
were fused with myeloma cells. Fused cells were grown in 96-well plates from which<br>
hybridoma supematants were screened for potential leads. Selected antibody 2E7,<br>
which was obtained from the immunisation with soluble β-amyloid 1-40, was of<br>
murine lgG2a isotype and had beta-amyloid binding activity in the efflux assay<br>
described below and an affinity of 36.1 pM for beta-amyloid 1-40 when measured by<br>
Biacore—, Method A(i) (Table 10A).<br>
Epitope Mapping of 2E7<br>
In order to finely map the binding of antibody 2E7 to the β-amyloid peptide, a peptide<br>
set (A) was utilised. Peptide set (A) consisted of a set of 31 12-mer overlapping<br>
peptides covering the complete sequence of the β-amyloid 1-42 peptide. Each<br>
sequential peptide was initiated at the sequential amino acid within the β-amyloid<br>
peptide, thus shifting the sequence covered between sequential peptides by a single<br>
amino acid. All peptides in set (A) contained a 3 amino acid C-terminal linker<br>
(glycine-serine-glycine) and a terminal biotinylated lysine residue. In addition, all<br>
peptides except peptide Aβ1 DAEFRHDSGYEVGSGK-biotin (SEQ ID No:15) were<br>
N-terminally acetylated. A second set of peptides (set (B); consisted of sequential<br>
one amino acid C-terminal deletions from a peptide containing amino acids 1 to 10 of<br>
the β-amyloid sequence. All peptides in set (B) contained a 3 amino acid C-terminal<br>
linker (glycine-serine-glycine) and a terminal biotinylated lysine residue, but with<br>
additional glycine and serine residues to replace for deleted β-amyloid amino acids<br>
(Table 2). Thus all peptides in set (B) are of the same length.<br>

Monitoring the binding of 2E7 to β-amyloid derived peptides using Optical<br>
Biosensors<br>
96-well SRU Bind™ streptavidin-coated plates (SRU Biosystems) were washed with<br>
PBS containing 1% DMSO to remove glycerol and preservative. A volume of<br>
50ul/well was left to equilibrate to room temperature to provide a constant base line .<br>
Biotinylated peptides were diluted to approx. 0.3ug/ml in PBS containing 1% DMSO<br>
and 50ul of each added to wells and incubated for approximately 1h. Replicate wells<br>
were prepared using different sectors of the plate and at least one no-peptide control<br>
well was used in each sector to reference subtract the data. After peptide capture the<br>
plate was washed with PBS containing 1% DMSO, leaving 50ul of fresh buffer per<br>
well to provide a new base line on the reader. No decay of peptide from the surface<br>
was seen. The buffer was then replaced with 40ul/well buffer containing test antibody<br>
at 20-64nM. for 2 hours. It was found that antibody 2E7 only bound to the peptide<br>
encompassing amino acids 1-12 of the β-amyloid peptide in peptide set (A) (peptide<br>
Api, SEQ ID No: 15) This result implies that the aspartic acid at residue 1 is critical<br>
for binding to this peptide.<br>
In order to further characterise the binding site of antibody 2E7, peptide set (B) was<br>
utilised. Using SRU BIND™ biosensor methodology antibody 2E7 showed negligible<br>
binding to the peptides encompassing amino acids 1-3 and 1-4 of the β-amyloid<br>
peptide (SEQ ID No:14 and 13). Binding to a peptide encompassing amino acids 1-7<br>
of the β-amyloid peptide (SEQ ID No: 10) was comparable to the peptide<br>
encompassing amino acids 1-12 of the β-amyloid peptide (from peptide set (A)).<br>
Binding to peptides encompassing amino acids 1-5 or 1-6 of the β-amyloid<br>
peptide(SEQ ID No:12 or 11) was observed, but was weaker (as measured by<br>
stability after an additional washing step) than the binding to the peptide<br>
encompassing amino acids 1-7 of the β-amyloid peptide (SEQ ID No: 10).<br>
Thus it has been shown that only residues 1-7 of the β-amyloid peptide are required<br>
for full binding as measured using this methodology.<br>
Surface Plasmon Resonance assay<br>
In addition to the experiments described above, the Biacore™ 3000 optical biosensor<br>
was used to monitor the binding of 2E7 antibody to selected β-amyloid sequence<br>
derived peptides. Binding was measured by injecting test antibodies at up to 64nM<br>
for 5 minute over peptides captured on separate streptavidin chip surfaces (130-230<br>
RU (resonance units)). A running buffer (HBS-EP) containing 0.01 M HEPES pH7.4,<br>
0.15M NaCI, 3mM EDTA and 0.005% Surfactant P20™ at 25°C was used at a flow<br>
rate of 20ul/min. All runs were double referenced against a blank streptavidin surface<br>
and blank injections. Analysis was carried out using the Biacore™ analysis software<br>
BIAevaluation™ version 4.1. Results from selected peptides in set (A) further<br>
confirmed the SRU BIND™ derived data indicating that 2E7 bound only to the<br>
peptide encompassing amino acids 1-12 (SEQ ID No:15) of the β-amyloid peptide<br><br>
with an apparent equilibrium constant KD of approximately 50pM. Under the same<br>
conditions, 2E7 did not bind to the peptide encompassing amino acids 2-13 of the β-<br>
amyloid peptide.<br>
Peptide Aβ2-13	AEFRHDSGYEVHGSGK-biotin (SEQ ID No:44)<br>
The experimental method and conditions used allowed the detection of high but also<br>
lower affinity molecules - in the same experimental setup, by contrast to 2E7,<br>
another antibody recognising an N-terminal epitope of the β-amyloid peptide was<br>
shown to bind the 2-13 peptide (SEQ ID No:44) with an apparent KD of 7nM. 2E7 did<br>
not bind to a selection of peptides in set (A) from mid regions of the β-amyloid<br>
peptide. In a separate experiment the β-amyloid 1 -40 peptide was captured via its N-<br>
terminal aspartic acid residue that had been biotinylated. This peptide was captured<br>
onto a Biacore™ streptavidin coated chip as previously described. Antibody 2E7<br>
injected at 66nM for 1 minute could not bind this peptide. Therefore, it is concluded<br>
that the previously descibed N-terminal binding site was masked by the linker and<br>
capture method, thus further confirming the extreme N-terminus as containing the<br>
core binding site<br>
Binding to Cell Expressed Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP)<br>
β-Amyloid is composed of peptides formed by proteolytic cleavage of a type I<br>
transmembrane precursor protein named amyloid precursor protein (APP). As APP<br>
has a large extracellular domain, binding to this protein could potentially initiate an<br>
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity reaction (ADCC).<br>
To characterise binding of antibody to cell-surface full length APP an FMAT™<br>
ABI8200 based assay was utilised.<br>
Transfection of HEK293T cells with wild type APP DNA<br>
HEK293T cells are maintained in DMEM F12 medium containing 10 % (v/v) FCS and<br>
1x Glutamax. Cells are seeded in 75cm2 tissue culture flasks and grown to 60-80 %<br>
confluency (18-24 h) prior to transfection. For transfection, 9 ug of DNA, (either wild<br>
type APP DNA (in PCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) vector), or vector only controls), is mixed<br>
with 0.3 ml of Opti-MEM™ media. 30ul Lipofectamine™ transfection agent is mixed<br>
with 0.3ml Opti-MEM™ media and the two mixtures pooled. The pooled mixtures are<br>
incubated at room temperature for 30 min prior to the addition of a further 4.8 ml of<br>
Opti-MEM™ media. The final mixture is added to the cells (post washing with Opti-<br>
MEM™ media) for 5 h and 6 ml of 10 % (v/v) newborn calf serum in DMEM is then<br>
added. 48hrs post transfection, supernatant is removed and the monolayer washed<br>
in versene, and then 3ml of Versene™ chelating agent is added to each flask,<br>
incubated for 5mins at 37C, and the detached cells pelleted at 200g for 5mins. The<br>
resultant cell pellet is gently resuspended in 1ml of assay buffer (2% heat treated<br>
serum, 0.5% BSA, 0.1% NaN3 in PBS pH7.4, filtered through a 0.2um filter) to create<br>
a single cell suspension.<br><br>
FMAT™ ABI8200 based assay<br>
Test antibodies (2E7, LN27 (Zymed) mouse IgG to extracellular domain of APP as a<br>
positive control, and an antibody G210 which recognises the x-40 form of the β-<br>
amyloid peptide as a negative control) were diluted to 10pg/ml in sterile filtered assay<br>
buffer (2% heat treat serum, 0.5% BSA, 0.1 % NaN3 in PBS pH7.2) in a polypropylene<br>
plate, and then a further six serial 1:1 dilutions were performed down the plate.<br>
Assay buffer only was used as a blank. 50ul of a suspension of HEK293T cells<br>
transfected with wild type APP DNA (Experiment 1: 10,000 cells; Experiment 2:<br>
20,000 cells) was added to each well of a 96 well plate, to which 5ul of each of the<br>
antibody solutions were added to duplicate wells. 50ul/well of F-MAT™ blue anti<br>
mouse IgG stock, (antibody is labelled using F-MAT™ blue monofunctional reactive<br>
dye kit from ABI, 4328408), diluted 1:500 (Experiment 1) and 1:1000 (Experiment 2)<br>
in assay buffer, was then added to each well and the plate briefly shaken and left to<br>
settle for 1hr. The plate was then read using the ABI 8200 fluorescence macro<br>
confocal cellular detection system (Applied Biosystems).<br>
Derived counts data were then interpreted using Excel™ spreadsheet software.<br>
Briefly, mock transfected counts were subtracted from the full length APP transfected<br>
cell counts to obtain a specific signal for each antibody. Two antibody concentrations<br>
that were on the linear part of the curve were chosen (1.25 and 0.63ug/ml) and the<br>
background corrected derived counts at these concentrations expressed as the<br>
percentage of the LN27 antibody binding, and averaged over the two antibody<br>
concentrations. The resultant data is described in Table 3 (% of LN27 binding ±SE)<br>
Thus, within this assay system, the binding of 2E7 to cell surface APP is<br>
indistinguishable from that of the negative control antibody G210.<br><br>
Binding to Amyloid Precursor Protein Derived Peptide<br>
The previously described epitope mapping studies have shown that antibody 2E7<br>
binds to the extreme N-terminus of the β-amyloid peptide, with the aspartic acid<br>
residue at position 1 being essential for binding. This suggests that the antibody<br>
recognises a 'neo' epitope formed by cleavage of APP at the β-secretase site. This<br>
observation would suggest that antibody 2E7 should not recognise adjacent APP<br><br>
peptide sequence. To test this hypothesis an APP peptide (Peptide APP1, SEQ ID<br>
No: 16) was synthesised which included residues 1-7 of the β-amyloid peptide and<br>
the five adjacent APP derived amino acids. Thus peptide APP1 contained<br>
contiguous amino acids from position 5 N-terminal to the BACE-1 cleavage site to<br>
position 7 C-terminal to the BACE-1 cleavage site and was N-terminally<br>
acetylated.The ability of antibody 2E7 to bind to the APP derived peptide APP1 and<br>
the β-amyloid 1-12 peptide (peptide Aβ1) was compared using Biacore™<br>
methodology (as previously described for epitope mapping). Antibody 2E7 showed<br>
high affinity binding to the β-amyloid peptide Aβ-1 , which contains the basic epitope<br>
1-7. However, no binding was observed to the APP1 peptide which also contains the<br>
basic β-amyloid derived sequence 1-7.<br>
Peptide Aβ1	DAEFRHDSGYEVGSGK-biotin SEQ ID No:15<br>
APP1	AcNH-SEVKMDAEFRHDGSGK-biotin SEQ ID No: 16<br>
A combination of FMAT™ based cellular binding and Biacore™ based peptide<br>
mapping has been utilised to show that, in these formats, 2E7 has no binding affinity<br>
for the full length APP protein. Given that the aspartic acid residue at position 1 of the<br>
β-amyloid peptide is required for binding, it is concluded that 2E7 only recognises the<br>
'neo' N-terminus of β-amyloid and hence should not bind cell surface expressed<br>
APP.<br>
In vivo Biological Activity<br>
I125 B-Amvloid Efflux Model<br>
A number of published studies have shown that β-amyloid antibodies can form<br>
complexes with β-amyloid peptide in the bloodstream. It is argued that this<br>
sequestration of peripheral β-amyloid allows for further efflux of CNS amyloid into the<br>
bloodstream (DeMattos RB, PNAS (2001), 98(15); 8850-8855). An acute<br>
pharmacodynamic model was developed to screen antibodies for their ability to<br>
complex with brain derived β-amyloid peptide in the bloodstream.<br>
Anaesthesia (4% isoflurane) was induced in male C57/BL6J mice and maintained<br>
(1.5% isoflurane) in 100% oxygen. Animals were then placed in a stereotaxic frame.<br>
Following midline incision along the sagittal suture a bore hole was drilled through<br>
the skull and a guide cannula was inserted into the lateral cerebral ventricle (co-<br>
ordinates anterioposterior (AP) -0.5mm, lateral (L) +0.7mm, ventral (V) -2.5mm). A<br>
further two bore holes were drilled through the skull into which cortical screws were<br>
placed. The cannula was anchored in place by cyanoacrylate gel and the incision<br>
was sutured around the cyanoacrylate gel headcap. Post-operatively the mice<br>
received 0.3ml saline subcutaneously and were placed in a warm environment to<br>
recover from anaesthesia. On recovery of the righting reflex, mice were housed<br>
singly and received 5 days standard post-op care. No procedures were permitted for<br>
a further 5 days or until pre-operative body weight was regained. Following recovery,<br>
cannula placement was verified by the angiotensin II drinking response. Each mouse<br>
received an intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration (5μl) of 100ng angiotensin II<br><br>
(All) (made up in 0.9% saline). Following administration of All, water intake was<br>
observed for 15 minutes. Mice with a positive dipsogenic response to All (sustained<br>
drinking) were included in the studies, which commenced no sooner than five days<br>
post All injection.<br>
On the day of study the mice were placed for 5-10 minutes in a warm environment to<br>
induce vasodilation, necessary for ease of injection into the tail vein. Test antibody<br>
(600μg) or PBS vehicle (dose volume no greater than 10ml per kg body weight) was<br>
injected via the tail vein and mice were returned to their individual cages post-<br>
injection. At exactly one hour post tail vein injection, mice were slowly ICV injected<br>
(2μl per minute) with 2ng (1μCl) of I125 beta-amyloid 1-40 (Amersham Biosciences,<br>
UK) in a dose volume of 5μl. At exactly four hours post ICV dose, 50μl of trunk blood<br>
was collected and the radioactivity level measured on a scintillation counter.<br>
Mice that had been injected into the tail-vein with 2E7 (n=6 per treatment group)<br>
showed a statistically significant increase in the radioactive signal (counts per minute<br>
- CPM) in 50μl of trunk blood compared with the CPM signal detected in vehicle<br>
injected mice - (CPM - vehicle: 1339.7 ± 496.2 vs. 2E7 4387.9 ± 980.3;<br>
ANOVA:F(2,13) = 4.97, p
Duncans: p=0.02 2E7 vs, vehicle]).<br>
In two further studies with 2E7 conducted with the identical protocol, similar<br>
increases in amyloid efflux into blood when compared with vehicle injected controls<br>
were observed (CPM blood: Vehicle 352 +/-113 versus 2E7 2397 +/- 353, and<br>
Vehicle 1281 +/- 312 versus 2E7 5291 +/- 885; ANOVA with post-hoc LSD test<br>

Transgenic CNS B-Amyloid Lowering Models<br>
1. B-Amvloid Load following 4 week dosing of 2 month old TASTPM mice<br>
Male and female TASTPM transgenic mice (double-mutant APPswe x PS1.M146V,<br>
Howlett DR (2004) Brain Research 1017 (1-2) 130-136) aged between 61 and 65<br>
days at the start of the study and were singly housed. Equal numbers of mice were<br>
assigned to each treatment group (N=12 per group) and were randomized according<br>
to gender and age. Treatment groups comprised the following: A: MOPC21<br>
(antibody with unknown specificity, Holton et al (1987) J.Immunol 139(9) 3041-3049,<br>
negative control), B: 2E7 (test antibody). All antibodies were dissolved in PBS and<br>
were dosed by the intraperitoneal route. Irrespective of animal weight, 300ug of<br>
antibody was administered. Animals were dosed twice weekly for four weeks. One<br>
day after the final dose, animals were euthanased by overdose with sodium<br>
pentobarbital. Brains were dissected and hemisected. Hemisected brain samples<br>
were collected into pre-weighed 2ml eppendorf™ tubes and snap frozen. Samples<br>
were subsequently thawed, reweighed and 1ml of 5M guanidine HCI containing<br>
Complete protease inhibitor™ tablets (Boehringer Mannheim) added, before the<br><br>
samples were homogenized and incubated at 4°C for &gt;90 min with constant<br>
agitation.<br>
Samples were then diluted 1 in 10 into assay buffer (50mM Tris HCI, pH7.4, 150mM<br>
NaCI, 0.05% Tween-20+ 1% BSA), vortexed and spun at 20.000G for 20 mins at<br>
4°C. The supernatant was removed and added as triplicate samples to the assay<br>
plate.<br>
The levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 were measured using a sensitive plate based<br>
electrochemiluminescent immunoassay (BioVeris™) employing C-terminal specific β-<br>
amyloid antibodies (to Aβ40 or Aβ42) labelled with Oritag™ specific label to facilitate<br>
detection (BioVeris™) used to capture either Aβ40 or Aβ42, along with a biotinylated<br>
N-terminal specific Aβ antibody. Antibody-Aβ complexes were captured with<br>
streptavidin coated beads that bind biotinylated antibodies (Dynabeads™, Dynal)<br>
incubated overnight at room temperature with vigorous mixing and assayed in a<br>
BioVeris™ M8 photodetector. Standard curves were constructed using human Aβ40<br>
and Aβ42 peptides in assay buffer containing the required concentration of<br>
Guanidine HCI. Data was analysed using Excel Robosage™ statistical analysis<br>
software and Aβ levels expressed as pmole/g tissue.<br>
In this paradigm, treatment with 2E7 antibody reduced CNS Aβ42 load by 37%<br>
(p
In subsequent studies under similar experimental conditions, 2E7 antibody reduced<br>
CNS A(342 load by 38% (Study 1, males only), 22% (Study 2, non-significant) and<br>
39% (Study 3, males, p=0.001) and 13% (Study 3, females, non-significant) when<br>
compared to PBS treated animals. In these studies 2E7 also reduced CNS Aβ40 by<br>
18% (Study 3, males, p=0.017) and offered a non-significant reduction in CNS Aβ40<br>
by 25% (Study 1, males only), 
(Study 3, females) when compared to PBS treated animals.<br>
2. B-Amyloid Load following 4 month dosing of 4 month old TASTPM mice<br>
Briefly, 4 month old TASTPM transgenic mice were dosed 300μg of antibody once or<br>
twice weekly via an intraperitonial (i.p.) route. After 4 months of dosing CNS β-<br>
amyloid levels were measured by ELISA and plaque load was measured by<br>
immunohistochemistry. Between the ages of 4 and 8 months, the CNS β-amyloid<br>
load increases exponentially and consequently, plaque pathology rapidly develops<br>
(Howlett DR (2004) Brain Research 1017 (1-2) 130-136).<br>
Mice were aged between 120 and 128 days at the start of the study and were singly<br>
housed. Similar numbers of mice were assigned to each treatment group (N=20 or 21<br>
per group) and were randomized according to gender and age. Treatment groups<br>
comprised the following: A: PBS (vehicle) dosed twice weekly, B: 2E7 dosed once<br>
weekly, C: 2E7 dosed twice weekly, D: PBS dosed once weekly. A 300 microgram<br><br>
dose (79 microlitres volume) of 2E7 was administered via the intraperitoneal route.<br>
Vehicle treated animals received the same volume of PBS. Animals were dosed for<br>
eighteen weeks. TASTPM mice are liable to suffer spontaneous seizures and as a<br>
result a number of animals died during the course of the study. Final numbers were<br>
as follows A: 4 females, 9 males; B: 5 females, 8 males; C: 4 females, 9 males; D: 2<br>
females, 9 males. Two or four days after the final dose (equal numbers per group)<br>
animals were euthanased by overdose with sodium pentobarbital. A tail tip sample<br>
from each mouse was taken for confirmation of the genotype. Brains were dissected<br>
and hemisected. The right hemisphere was fixed by immersion in 4%<br>
paraformaldehyde and processed for histology. The left hemisphere was collected<br>
into pre-weighed 2ml eppendorf™ tubes, frozen on dry ice and stored at -80°C for<br>
subsequent analysis of amyloid content. Prior to analysis, samples were thawed,<br>
reweighed and 1ml of 5M guanidine HCI containing Complete protease inhibitor™<br>
tablets (Boehringer Mannheim) added, before the samples were homogenized and<br>
incubated at 4°C for &gt;90 min with constant agitation.<br>
Samples were then diluted 1 in 10 into assay buffer (50mM Tris HCI, pH7.4,150mM<br>
NaCI, 0.05% Tween-20+ 1% BSA), vortexed and spun at 20.000G for 20 mins at<br>
4°C. The supernatants were diluted a further 1:1000 and added as triplicate samples<br>
to the assay plate.<br>
The levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 were measured as for the 4 week dosing study.<br>
An analysis of variance was used with treatment, sex and dosing schedule included<br>
in the model as fixed effects. All of the interactions between the three factors were<br>
also included. There were no significant differences between the two dosing<br>
schedules (once or twice weekly). With this experimental design, firstly it could be<br>
assessed if there were any significant differences between the dosing schedules and<br>
secondly, as there were no such significant differences, data from the two dosing<br>
schedules could be combined, thus increasing the power of the experiment by<br>
doubling the number of mice in the analysis.<br>
In this paradigm, treatment with 2E7 antibody reduced CNS Aβ42 load by 22.5%<br>
(p=0.0152). Levels of CNS Aβ40 were also lowered by 12.1%, but this figure did not<br>
reach statistical significance (p=0.118).<br>
A complex immunohistochemical analysis of these samples was performed to define<br>
the area of brain tissue showing plaque pathology. Sections were taken from the<br>
cortex at the level of the caudate and from the cortex at the level of the hippocampus.<br>
Adjacent sections were stained with either an Aβ40 or Aβ42 specific antibody or<br>
alternatively with the amyloid stain Congo Red. Using image analysis software, the<br>
area of the section stained for plaque was expressed as a percentage of the total<br>
section area.<br><br>
After fixation, the PFA-immersed half brains were coronally cut in a brain matrix into<br>
6 x 2mm thick sections. These 2mm sections will be referred to as sections A to F, A<br>
being the most rostral and F the most caudal. Sections A, B &amp; C and D, E &amp; F were<br>
placed in separate embedding cassettes numbered for each animal. Cassettes were<br>
held in PFA until ready for processing and embedding.<br>
Embedding was undertaken on a Citadel™ 1000 (Shandon) tissue processor. All<br>
tissues received the following processing regimen:-<br>
70% IMS - 1 hr<br>
100%IMS-3x1hr<br>
100%ethanol-2hr<br>
100% isobutyl alcohol; 1 x 2hr; 1 x 1.5hr<br>
Histoclear™-2x1.5hr<br>
Paraffin wax - 2 x 2hr<br>
On completion of the processing cycle, the wax impregnated tissue sections were<br>
transferred to molten-paraffin wax filled base moulds and embedded utilising a<br>
Histocentre™ (Shandon) paraffin embedding system. Tissue was embedded such that<br>
sections A, B &amp; C went into one mould; D, E &amp; F into a second mould. This was<br>
carried out for all sets of sections ie. each hemisected brain resulted in two wax blocks<br>
of three sections each. Sections were placed in the moulds such that the caudal<br>
surface of each piece became the future cutting surface. Care was taken to ensure<br>
that each section was pushed well down in the mould so that microtoming of each<br>
would occur in parallel. The perforated processing cassette was then carefully placed<br>
onto each mould which was then topped up with molten wax. Embedded blocks were<br>
then cooled on the refrigerated plate until they could be removed from the moulds.<br>
Blocks were stored at room temperature until required for microtoming. Blocks were<br>
cut at random and 5 micron sections floated onto prelabelled gelatine coated slides<br>
(Superfrost™, Erie Scientific Company) slides. Two sections were floated onto each<br>
slide. Wherever possible, consecutive sections were mounted and slides were<br>
numbered consecutively from 1 to 25. Fifty sections (25 slides) were taken from each<br>
block. Slides were dried on a hot plate and then stored at room temperature until<br>
required.<br>
Immunohistochemistry was undertaken on sets of 30 slides. On each slide, the top<br>
section was labelled with an Aβ40 antibody (G30, rabbit polyclonal recognising x-40 β-<br>
amyloid), the lower section with the Aβ42 antibody, 20G10, monoclonal antibody<br>
recognising x-42 β-amyloid. A minimum of 5 sections per antibody per block were<br>
labelled.<br>
Labelling was carried out as follows. Following dewaxing through Histoclear and<br>
graded alcohols, sections were immersed in 85% formic acid for 8 minutes and then<br>
blocked in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide for 30 minutes to block endogenous peroxidases.<br>
Antibodies G30 and 20G10 were both applied overnight at 1:1000 dilutions, sections<br><br>
being left at 4°C. Development of the sections was with the respective biotinylated anti<br>
rabbit and anti-mouse secondaries. Colour development was accomplished with a<br>
diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride staining kit (DAB™, Vector Labs). Sections were<br>
briefly counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin before being dehydrated, cleared and<br>
cover-slipped.<br>
Sections were left to dry for at least 48 hours before microscopy. Images were<br>
captured on a Leica DMRB™ microscope equipped with digital camera. Images were<br>
analysed using Qwin™ software (Leica) and results presented as % of the section area<br>
that was labelled by the Aβ antibody.<br>
An analysis of variance was used with treatment, sex and dosing schedule included<br>
in the model as fixed effects. All of the interactions between the three factors were<br>
also included. There were no significant differences between the two dosing<br>
schedules (once or twice weekly). With this experimental design, firstly we could<br>
assess if there were any significant differences between the dosing schedules and<br>
secondly, as there were no such significant differences, data from the two dosing<br>
schedules could be combined, thus increasing the power of the experiment by<br>
doubling the number of mice in the analysis.<br>
In this paradigm, treatment with 2E7 antibody reduced plaque pathology as<br>
measured with an antibody recognising Aβ42. Plaque pathology was reduced by<br>
27.1% (p=0.0026) in the cortex at the level of the hippocampus and 43% (p
in the cortex at the level of the caudate. Plaque pathology was also reduced when<br>
measured with an antibody recognising Aβ40. Plaque pathology was reduced by<br>
16.6% (p=0.0421) in the cortex at the level of the hippocampus and 17.3%<br>
(p=0.0342) in the cortex at the level of the caudate.<br>
No evidence of microhaemorrhage (as determined by Perls' Prussian Blue) was<br>
observed in any mice from this study treated with vehicle or 2E7. This method<br>
visualises ferric iron (iron is an essential constituent of the oxygen-carrying<br>
haemoglobin found in red cells) by producing an insoluble blue compound. All levels<br>
of brain from all animals were clear.<br>
Cognition models<br>
Following the 4 month dosing of 4 month old TASTPM mice as described above,<br>
these mice were tested in two models of cognition: the object recognition assay and<br>
the fear conditioning assay.<br>
Object recognition assay<br>
The object recognition assay exploits the animals' natural propensity to explore novel<br>
objects and relies on the animals' ability to recall an object which had been explored<br>
previously (familiar object). Eight month old TASTPM mice have been reported to<br>
demonstrate a deficit in the ability to distinguish between novel and familiar objects<br><br>
(Howlett et al., 2004) indicating impaired cognitive performance in these animals. In<br>
this study, however, 8 month-old TASTPM mice treated with vehicle failed to<br>
demonstrate cognitive impairment i.e. they were able to distinguish between novel<br>
and familiar objects. There was therefore no window to investigate any potential<br>
therapeutic effect resulting from treatment with 2E7.<br>
Fear conditioning assay<br>
The fear conditioning model was designed to test the animals' ability to correlate a<br>
previous painful stimulus with a contextual or cued signal and recall this when<br>
presented with the same context or tone following Xh delay. In this study 8-month old<br>
TASTPM mice treated with vehicle (once or twice weekly) exhibited a deficit in<br>
contextual differentiation indicative of cognitive impairment in these animals. This<br>
deficit was unaffected by treatment with 2E7 when administered once of twice weekly<br>
4 Month dosing of 6 month old TASTPM mice<br>
This study involved the administration of 2E7 (300ug i.p. twice weekly) to TASTPM<br>
mice for 4 months, starting at 3 months of age. Control animals received lgG2A in<br>
PBS. As described above, brains were dissected and hemisected. The right<br>
hemisphere was fixed by immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde and processed for<br>
histology. The left hemisphere was collected into pre-weighed 2ml eppendorf™<br>
tubes, frozen on dry ice and stored at -80°C for subsequent analysis of amyloid<br>
content.<br>
A preliminary analysis of a single section from each of a random selection of brain<br>
samples (n=6 vehicle, n=7 2E7 treated group) by IHC was undertaken using the<br>
same general protocol as above. Statistical analysis (Student's t-test) shows that<br>
there was a significant decrease in Aβ42 plaque load in thalamus (71.9%, p=0.007)<br>
and in thalamus + cortex + hippocampus (54.1%, p=0.022) in mice dosed with 2E7<br>
but no significant change in Aβ40.<br>
For biochemical measurement of brain Aβ40 and Aβ42, samples were processed<br>
and measured as above (dilution factor 1:10,000). Aβ42 was significantly decreased<br>
(p=0.01) by 29.9% in mice dosed with 2E7 (n=12 control, n=16 treated). Aβ40<br>
concentrations were also decreased (22.6%) but this decrease failed to reach<br>
statistical significance (p=0.052).<br>
Cloning of Hvbridoma Variable Regions<br>
Variable Region Sequences<br>
Total RNA was extracted from 2E7 hybridoma cells and heavy and light variable<br>
domain cDNA sequences were then generated by reverse transcription and<br>
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The forward primer for RT-PCR was a mixture<br>
of degenerate primers specific for murine immunoglobulin gene leader-sequences<br><br>
and the reverse primer was specific for the antibody constant regions, in this case<br>
murine isotype lgG2a for the heavy chain and murine kappa for the light chain.<br>
Primers were designed according to the strategy described by Jones and Bendig<br>
(Bio/Technology 9:88. 1991). RT-PCR was carried out in duplicate for both V-region<br>
sequences to enable subsequent verification of the correct V-region sequences. The<br>
V-region products generated by RT-PCR were cloned (Invitrogen TA Cloning Kit)<br>
and sequence data obtained.<br>

Cloning and Expression of 2E7 Chimera<br>
A chimeric 2E7 antibody (2E7c) consisting of the parent murine V regions grafted on<br>
to human lgG1 (Fc mutated (L235A, G237A)) for the heavy chain or human C kappa<br>
regions for the light chain was generated in order to express recombinant antibody<br>
material that could be used to confirm the correct cloning of functional murine V<br>
regions. DNA encoding 2E7 murine heavy and light chain V regions and endogenous<br><br>
murine signal sequences was cloned in frame into the mammalian expression<br>
vectors RLD-bshe (for the heavy chain) and RLN-bshe (for the light chain) already<br>
containing human constant regions (lgG1 Fc mutated (L235A, G237A) or human C<br>
kappa, respectively).<br>

Clones with correctly cloned VH and VL sequences were identified and plasmids<br>
prepared for expression in suspension culture CHO cells. Expressed 2E7c antibody<br>
was purified from cell culture supernatant by protein A chromatography on a FPLC<br>
system, and then tested for binding to Aβ by ELISA and SPR using Biacore™<br>
technology. The results indicated that the correct 2E7 mouse V regions were cloned<br>
and expressed, resulting in a functional antibody with similar characteristics to the<br>
parent murine antibody 2E7.<br>
Light Chain Humanisation<br>
A human acceptor sequence with the Genpept ID CAA51135 (SEQ ID No:24) and<br>
Genbank Accesion No X72467, which had 77% identity on the amino acid level<br>
(including CDRs) was selected as the acceptor framework. Construct L1 is a graft of<br>
the murine CDRs from the 2E7 VL domain into this acceptor framework.<br><br>
Heavy Chain Humanisation<br>
Human sequence Genbank accession No M99675 (SEQ ID No:21) an allele of the<br>
VH3-48 gene with 74% identity on the amino acid level (including CDRs 1 and 2) to<br>
the 2E7 mouse variable heavy region was selected as the human heavy chain<br>
acceptor framework together with the human JH4 minigene. Three humanised<br>
variable heavy chain variants were designed based on the M99675 sequence and<br>
JH4. H1 is a graft of the murine CDRs using the Kabat definition with two additional<br>
framework back mutations at positions 93 and 94. H2 and H3 were both derived from<br>
H1, but incorporated one additional framework mutation which were different in each<br>
construct; (positions 24 and 48 respectively; see Table 4).<br><br>
Humanised V regions were synthesised de novo by build up of overlapping oligos<br>
and PCR amplification. Restriction sites for cloning into mammalian expression<br>
vectors RLD-bshe and RLN-bshe and human immunoglobulin signal sequences<br>
derived from the chosen human acceptor frameworks were included. The DNAs<br>
encoding the humanised V regions (H1 (SEQ ID NO:27), H2 (SEQ ID NO.29), H3<br>
(SEQ ID NO:31), L1 (SEQ ID NO:33)) together with signal sequences and restriction<br>
sites were then cloned in frame into mammalian expression vectors: H1, H2 and H3<br>
into RLD-bshe to generate DNA encoding three full length human lgG1 Fc mutated<br>
heavy chains each containing mutations L235A and G237A, full length H1 (SEQ ID<br>
NO-.35), full length H2 (SEQ ID NO:37) and full length H3 (SEQ ID NO:39); L1 was<br>
cloned in frame into RLN-bshe containing the DNA encoding human kappa constant<br>
region to generate DNA encoding a full length human kappa light chain (SEQ ID<br>
NO:41).<br>
Representative Examples of Expression of Humanised Heavy and Light Chain<br>
Antibody Combinations<br>
CHOK1 cells were transiently transfected at small scale with all combinations of<br>
humanised light and heavy chain DNA constructs: L1+H1, L1+H2, L1+H3 (SEQ ID<br>
Nos: 35 + 41, 37 + 41, 39 + 41) in 6-well plates. CHOK1 cells passaged in DMEM<br>
F12, with 5% ultra low IgG foet al bovine serum and 2mM glutamine were grown to<br>
confluency in 6-well plates. The confluent cells were transfected with a total of 7.5 pg<br>
DNA: 30 μg Transfast lipid (Promega) in Optimem Glutamax medium (Invitrogen).<br>
Transfected cells were incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2. At 72 hours supernatants<br>
were harvested and assayed for antibody concentration and then tested for binding<br><br>
to human Aβ by ELISA. Humanized L1 combined with the three humanized heavy<br>
chains all expressed complete antibody that bound to human Aβ.<br>
Humanized antibodies were also expressed in large scale transient CHOK1 cell<br>
transfections using liposomal delivery of DNA (eg TransFast (Promega)) and<br>
expression in culture bottles. For optimization of expression levels in transient<br>
transfections a heavy to light chain expression vector DNA ratio of 1:6 was used.<br>
Material from transient transfection was purified using ProSepA columns or FPLC<br>
with ProSepA HiTrap columns.<br>
Assessment of 2E7 Humanised Variants H1L1, H2L1 and H3 L1 in β-Amyloid<br>
Binding ELISA<br>
2E7 H1L1, H2L1 and H3L1 humanised variants were assessed for binding to human<br>
Aβ peptide (1-40) biotinylated at the C terminus. The chimeric 2E7 was used as a<br>
reference. Tables 5-7 show results with various batches of purified material from<br>
large scale transient transfections.<br><br>
These results indicated very similar Aβ binding profiles for each of the 2E7-derived<br>
humanised variants. Comparison of the EC50 values to the 2E7c showed little loss of<br>
Aβ binding activity had been incurred through the humanization process.<br>
Comparison of 2E7 Humanised Variants bv Competition ELISA<br><br>
2E7c chimeric and humanised antibodies H1L1, H2L1 and H3L1 were assessed for<br>
their ability to inhibit the binding between the human Aβ peptide and the parental<br>
mouse 2E7 MAb in a competition ELISA.<br>
Two types of competition ELISA were established in order to compare the Aβ binding<br>
activity of the three humanised variants compared to the 2E7 chimeric antibody.<br>
1) Immobilised β-amyloid: biotinylated human Aβ peptide (1-40) was immobilized<br>
through Streptavidin on ELISA plates Mouse 2E7 antibody was added at a constant<br>
concentration along with a dilution series of 2E7-derived humanised variant<br>
antibodies. Bound mouse 2E7 MAb was then detected with anti-mouse IgG<br>
conjugate. Table 8 shows results of two assays.<br><br>
2) β-amyloid in solution; a constant concentration of β-amyloid was pre-incubated<br>
with a dilution series of humanised 2E7 antibody variants - the mixture including<br>
complexed and free amyloid was added for a short time to wells containing<br>
immobilised mouse 2E7 MAb. The amount of free β-amyloid that was still available<br>
for binding the immobilised parental 2E7 MAb was then detected. Table 9 shows<br>
results of two assays.<br><br>
All humanised antibody variants inhibited the binding of mouse 2E7 MAb to β-<br>
amyloid with a very similar profile. IC50 values generated for H2L1 and H3L1 variants<br>
were consistently close to that of the 2E7c chimera (where used), which had the<br>
highest inhibitory activity in both assays. However, variant H1L1 showed a somewhat<br>
reduced inhibitory activity in both assays, indicating a possible slightly lower affinity<br>
for β-amyloid.<br>
SPR Biacore™ Analysis of 2E7. 2E7c. H1L1. H2L1. H3L1<br><br>
The kinetics parameters of recombinant mouse 2E7 MAb, chimeric 2E7c and<br>
humanized variants H1L1, H2L1 and H3L1 binding to human beta-amyloid peptide<br>
(1-4Q) and (1-42) were assessed using Biacore™ analysis on a Biacore™ 3000. Two<br>
different assay formats were used.<br>
Method A<br>
(i) Briefly, 
terminus) were captured on a streptavidin biosensor chip (as used for Table 10A).<br>
The antibodies were diluted down in HBS-EP buffer and passed over the<br>
streptavidin/beta-amyloid surface at concentrations ranging from 0.001 nM-8nM (for<br>
Table 10A). Two separate runs were carried out; each run was carried out on a new<br>
streptavidin/beta-amyloid surface. Runs 1 and 2 were essentially the same though<br>
there were some differences in the parameters used; Run 1 was carried out using a<br>
chip surface on which 16 RU's of beta-amyloid were captured, and antibody<br>
concentrations of 0.001 nM-8nM were used, an association time of 4 minutes and a<br>
dissociation time of 20 minutes were used at a flow rate of 50μl per minute. For Run<br>
2, less than 10 RU's of beta-amyloid were captured and antibody concentrations of<br>
0.003125nM-8nM were used. The flow rate and association times were the same as<br>
Run 1, however the dissociation time was reduced to 15 minutes,<br>
(ii) Beta amyloid (1-40) and (1-42) were amine-coupled on different surfaces of a<br>
CM5 biosensor chip to a level of 
The antibodies were diluted down in HBS-EP buffer and passed over the<br>
biosensor/beta-amyloid surface at concentrations ranging from 1 nM-64nM (as used<br>
for Table 10B).<br>
Method B<br>
In the second instance the assay was reversed, in that antibodies were first captured<br>
to a level of 1000-2500 resonance units on an anti-mouse IgG polyclonal antibody<br>
surface (for recombinant mouse 2E7 MAb) or a protein A surface (for humanized<br>
H2L1) of a CM5 biosensor chip. Freshly prepared beta-amyloid (1-40) or (1-42) was<br>
diluted down in HBS-EP buffer and passed over the captured-antibody surface at<br>
concentrations ranging from 4-500nM (Table 10C and 10D).<br>
In both methods, regeneration was via a pulse of 100mM H3PO4, and for Table 10A<br>
data also followed by a pulse of 50mM NaOH. The surface was shown to be stable<br>
and unaffected by regeneration. All runs were double referenced against buffer blank<br>
injections. Analysis was carried out using the Biacore™ analysis software<br>
BIAevaluation version 4.1.<br>
Results<br>
Method A(i) was used to rank order the antibodies by beta-amyloid binding kinetic<br>
data. The data obtained is shown in Table 10A. This shows that the parental 2E7<br>
Mab has a KD of 36.1 pM for streptavidin-captured beta-amyloid. The chimeric<br>
mouse-human antibody showed a slightly reduced KD of 45.8 pM and the humanised<br><br>
constructs range from 54 (H2L1) to 93.6 pM (H1L1). In conclusion this demonstrates<br>
that the humanisation procedure had been very successful and very little affinity had<br>
been lost. The additional backmutations introduced for H2 and H3 had a small but<br>
beneficial effect, although the differences between H2 and H3 constructs are within<br>
the standard deviations for these experiments.<br><br>
Method A(ii) was used to confirm that the additional two amino-acid residues on the<br>
C-terminus of beta-amyloid (1-42) compared to beta-amyloid (1-40) did not<br>
significantly alter the binding properties of 2E7 and H2L1. The data obtained<br>
is shown in Table 10B and did confirm this.<br><br>
Method B was used to negate avidity effects potentially seen in the first assay format.<br>
Avidity effects, caused by both Fab domains of a single antibody molecule binding at<br>
the same time to two adjacent beta-amyloid molecules on the biosensor surface (or<br><br>
in multimeric forms of beta-amyloid), would increase the apparent affinity of binding.<br>
Affinity measurements obtained using Method B are shown in Table 10C.<br><br>
Evidence that this assay provided true 1:1 binding affinities was obtained when Fab<br>
fragments of H2L1, obtained by papain digestion, bound streptavidin-captured beta-<br>
amyloid (1-40) by a similar method to Method A(i) with an estimated KD of 2.4nM.<br>
Method B was also used to confirm that the additional two amino-acid residues on<br>
the C-terminus of beta-amyloid (1-42) compared to beta-amyloid (1-40) did not<br>
significantly alter the binding properties of an identical sequence clone to mouse 2E7<br>
MAb, named 2F11. The data obtained<br>
is shown in Table 10D.<br><br>
In a study similar to the epitope mapping study on 2E7 using the Surface Plasmon<br>
Resonance assay described above, H2L1 behaved similarly to 2E7 in binding to the<br>
peptide encompassing amino acids 1-12 (Aβ1, SEQ ID No:15) of the β-amyloid<br>
peptide and not to the peptide encompassing amino acids 2-13 of the β-amyloid<br>
peptide (Aβ2-13, SEQ ID No:44).<br>
Activity of H2L1 in the I125 β-Amyloid Efflux Model<br>
In order to functionally compare the humanised H2L1 with the parent mouse<br>
monoclonal 2E7, both were tested on the same day in the I125 β-amyloid efflux model<br>
described above.<br>
Both H2L1 and 2E7 significantly increased counts per minute (CPM) in blood<br>
compared with vehicle control. CPM of radioactivity in blood was as follows (Vehicle:<br>
1940 ± 166; 2E7: 10065 ± 1386; H2L1: 10913 ± 1535). Statistics used were ANOVA<br><br>
with post-hoc LSD test, n=7 vehicle, n=6 2E7, n=6 H2L1, (p
compound vs. vehicle).<br>
This data provides further evidence that the humanised H2L1 antibody has retained<br>
the functional properties shown with the mouse 2E7 molecule.<br>
Investigation of the Pharmacokinetics of H2L1 and 2E7<br>
The terminal half life of test antibody in mice was investigated. Test antibody was<br>
administered by a 1 h intravenous infusion to 4 mice to achieve a target dose of<br>
400ug per mouse. Serial blood samples were taken from each mouse up to 5 days<br>
after dosing (one mouse from the 2E7 group did not complete the study and one from<br>
the H2L1 group was removed from subsequent analysis because it became apparent<br>
the dose had not been administered i.v.). Antibody levels were measured using a β-<br>
amyloid capture ELISA.<br>
Analysis of the data indicates that the humanised antibody H2L1 has a terminal half<br>
life of circa 82 hours in mice (Table 11), which is comparable to that of the parent<br>
mouse monoclonal antibody 2E7 (circa 75 hours).<br><br>

Effect of H2L1 on peripheral amyloid load in aged non-human primates<br>
A study was conducted in aged Cynomolgus monkeys (approximately 15 years old)<br>
to investigate the exposure response relationship with respect to amyloid/H2L1<br>
complex formation and clearance and the subsequent effects on CSF and CNS<br>
amyloid levels. Weekly lumbar CSF (taken under ketamine sedation) and blood<br>
samples were collected 3 weeks prior to 1st dose of H2L1. Immediately following<br>
sampling on week 3, animals received placebo (n=10). 0.1mg/kg (n=5), 1mg/kg (n=5)<br>
or 10mg/kg (n=10) H2L1 and then every 2 weeks for 12 weeks. Blood samples for<br><br>
plasma analysis of H2L1 and total Aβ42 were taken weekly. CSF samples for<br>
quantification of Aβ40/42 were collected every 2 weeks. Following completion of the<br>
dosing period, animals were euthanased for the purpose of brain quantification of<br>
beta-amyloid by biochemical analyses as described above and investigation of<br>
microhaemorrhage. In the lowest dose group (0.1 mg/kg), animals were euthanased<br>
in a staggered fashion to evaluate the potential time course effect in brain levels as a<br>
consequence of termination of dosing and hence saturation of the plasma amyloid<br>
pool.<br>
This study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee<br>
(lACUC) of MACCINE Pte Ltd, or "Maccine" prior to start of the experimental phase.<br>
The lACUC protocol number was #08-2006. GSK has performed a site visit of<br>
Maccine and has reviewed their ethical review process and found it acceptable<br>
Plasma samples were serially diluted 1:10 to 1:50000 and added to Aβ40 coated<br>
ELISA plates. Standard curves were created ranging from 0-10μg/ml H2L1 in<br>
diluent. Following an overnight incubation at 4°C H2L1 was visualised using anti-<br>
human IgG horseradish peroxidase (Amersham - diluted 1:2000 in diluent) and<br>
tetramethylbenzidene detection system. Following single and repeat iv bolus<br>
administration, plasma levels of H2L1 appeared to increase in a dose dependent<br>
fashion. There was no evidence of severe non-linearities in the pharmacokinetics,<br>
indicating that for the majority of the dosing interval, excess molar concentrations of<br>
H2L1 in the plasma compared with free amyloid levels were achieved.<br>
Total Ap42was measured in neat plasma using a commercially available Aβ 1-42<br>
ELISA kit (Innogenetics) in accordance with the manufacturers instructions, with<br>
standard curves ranging from 500-7pg/ml created in kit diluent. Samples and<br>
standards are incubated overnight at 4°C before assaying in duplicate according to<br>
kit instructions. It should be noted that due to the interference of the detection<br>
antibody supplied with the Aβ42 assay, this kit cannot be used to measure free Aβ42<br>
levels but measures the apparent 'total' Aβ42. There was a dose and concentration<br>
dependent increase in Aβ42 (with plateau levels of approximately 300,125 and 25<br>
pg/ml detected following 10, 1 or 0.1 mg/kg H2L1 respectively).<br>
From the analysis, the increase in the "total Aβ42" is likely to be due to the result of a<br>
significant efflux of amyloid from outside the plasma pool, that appeared dependent<br>
upon H2L1 concentrations &gt;1 ug/mL, and did not appear to be a result of lack of<br>
clearance of complex. This was evident by the elimination rate of the total Aβ42as<br>
well as the fluctuation in the total levels over a dosing interval.<br>
To date only the plasma analysis has been completed and fully analysed. However<br>
preliminary analysis indicates that there was a trend towards reduction in CSF and<br>
increase in the hippocampal level of 'total' Aβ42 (measured as generally described<br>
above) following treatment with 10mg/kg H2L1.<br><br>
In some brain sections, small areas of microhaemorrhage were detected as shown<br>
by the Perls' Prussian Blue staining method. This method visualises ferric iron (iron is<br>
an essential constituent of the oxygen-carrying haemoglobin found in red cells) by<br>
producing an insoluble blue compound. However there was no difference in the<br>
incidence between vehicle and drug treated animals.<br>
Analyses on Aged Cynomologus macaque monkeys for beta amyloid plagues<br>
in the brain and total beta amyloid in the plasma<br>
Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and tissue parameters of human AD have been displayed<br>
in the cynomolgus monkey. The aged cynomolgus monkey has been shown to have<br>
evidence of amyloid deposition. (Covance, The cynomolgus monkey as a model for<br>
Alzheimer's disease. In: Buse E, Habermann G, Friderichs-Gromoll S, Kaspereit J,<br>
Nowak P and Niggemann K, editors. Poster Presentation at the 44th Annual Meeting<br>
of the Society of Toxicology, New Orleans, Louisiana, 6 to 10 March 2005). The<br>
potential for H2L1 to elicit an inappropriate response (such as encephalitis) in an<br>
aged brain was investigated in old, ca. 20 years, ex-breeding female monkeys. In<br>
addition, safety, treatment-related microhaemorrhage, neutralization/clearance of test<br>
material, hypersensitivity, and immune complex disease were also investigated<br>
following intravenous administration for 8 weeks in two-weekly intervals. In addition<br>
CNS and blood samples were analysed for levels of Aβ40/42-<br>
Study Design<br>
Groups of 5 (group 1), 9 (group 2) or 10 (group 3) geriatric female cynomolgus<br>
monkeys were given 0 (vehicle), 50 or 100 mg/kg/dosing day H2L1 in vehicle (4<br>
ml/kg) every second week for 8 weeks intravenously by slow bolus administration.<br>
The vehicle consisted of sodium acetate trihydrate 6.81 mg/mL, disodium edetate<br>
dehydrate 0.0186 mg/mL, polysorbate 80 0.2 mg/mL, and L-Arginine base 10 mg/mL,<br>
the pH was 5.5. Dose levels were chosen to investigate dose levels that were 5 and<br>
10 fold intended clinical dose levels.<br>
The following evaluations were performed pre-dose, daily (clinical signs, body weight,<br>
food consumption), week 4 and the week before necropsy: in-life animal<br>
observations, body weight, body temperature, haematology, clinical chemistry<br>
(including cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] analysis), urinalysis, and cytokine determination<br>
in CSF. Following necropsy, organ weights, macroscopic observations, and<br>
microscopic observations of the brain, cervical spinal cord and gross lesions were<br>
conducted on all animals. Toxicokinetic evaluation was performed after each dosing.<br>

There were no unscheduled deaths, and there were no signs which indicated an<br>
influence of the test item on the general condition of the animals at the administered<br>
doses. The only remarkable observations in clinical pathology (hematology and<br>
serum chemistry) were concluded to be age- and not test article related.<br><br>
Systemic exposure to H2L1 (as measured by AUC0-T and Cmax) increased<br>
approximately in proportion to dose.For both dose groups, there was no marked<br>
change (≥2-fold) in systemic exposure between the 1st dose and 4th dose sampling<br>
periods.<br>
There were no signs of inflammatory reactions in the brain detected by CSF-analysis,<br>
and there were no macroscopic or microscopic findings at necropsy that suggested a<br>
test item influence, specifically no microhaemorrhage or encephalitis.<br>
This study was conducted in compliance with the Good Laboratory Practice<br>
Regulations as outlined in German Chemical Law, annex 1 and 2 to §19a<br>
Chemikalien Gesetz, June 2002, the OECD Principles of Good Laboratory Practice<br>
(revised 1997, issued January 1998) ENV/MC/CHEM (98) 17, the Consensus<br>
Document "The Application of the OECD Principles of GLP to the Organisation and<br>
Management of Multi-Site Studies" ENV/JM/MONO(2002)9. Studies conducted in<br>
compliance with the above regulations and standards were considered acceptable to<br>
US FDA regulatory authorities.<br>
Analysis of Plague load in the CNS<br>
The left brain hemispheres of the vehicle treated cynomologus macaque monkeys<br>
from the above study were analysed by immunohistochemistry. A coronal section, at<br>
the level of the middle temporal sulcus containing portions of the dentate gyrus and<br>
hippocampus, was processed into wax as described above. For<br>
immunohistochemistry, sections were labelled with a pan-Aβ antibody (1E8,<br>
monoclonal antibody raised to Aβ 13-27), or with the Aβ42 antibody, (20G10,<br>
monoclonal antibody recognising Aβ x-42), and labelling was developed as above. A<br>
visual count of the number of plaques was taken for each section. Tissue from all five<br>
vehicle-treated cynomolgus monkeys showed evidence of parenchymal Aβ plaques.<br>
There was also evidence of cerebrovascular labelled Aβ and intraneuronal Aβ.<br>
Analysis of beta amyloid/antibody complexes in plasma<br>
Biochemical analysis was carried out on plasma samples from two time points (at the<br>
end of weeks 4 and 8 after start of dosing) from animals dosed with 50mg/kg (n=9) or<br>
100mg/kg (n=10) H2L1, or vehicle dosed controls (n=5). 100ul duplicate samples<br>
were analysed using the commercially available Innogenetics Aβ 1-42 ELISA kit,<br>
incubated overnight at 4°C. Control samples were analysed both neat and at 1:10<br>
dilution (using the supplied diluent), while samples from the dosed animals were<br>
tested neat and at 1:25. Subsequent absorbance values were analysed, with<br>
unknown absorbance values backcalculated to pg/ml values using standard curves,<br>
and then corrected for any assay dilution. Total plasma levels of Aβ42 derived from<br>
these samples are shown in Table 12 below (figures in pg/ml ± SE); all samples from<br>
animals treated with H2L1 contained significantly higher levels of Aβ42 (p 
student t-test) than in control groups.<br><br><br>
Data reported were obtained from diluted samples. Results from the neat samples<br>
were not used as many data points were either greater than the top standard, or due<br>
to sample volume limitation, only assayed as a single point.<br>
Production process<br>
Expression vectors encoding H2L1 and operatively linked to amplifiable selection<br>
markers such as the DHFR or glutamine synthetase may be used to transfect or<br>
transduce appropriate parental CHO cell lines (eg CHODG44 or CHOK 1) to produce<br>
engineered cell lines suitable for production of monoclonal antibody at large scale<br>
(for review see Bebbington and Hentschel DNA Cloning Volume III; A practical<br>
approach (edited by Glover DM) (Oxford IRL press, 1987). In order to increase<br>
expression levels the coding sequence maybe codon optimized in order to avoid cis-<br>
acting sequence motifs and extreme GC contents (high or low). SEQ. ID Nos:42 and<br>
No:43 exemplify such a coding sequence for H2 heavy chain and L1 light chain.<br>
Large scale production maybe in stirred tank bioreactors using animal-derived-<br>
component-free medium, followed by purification. This may comprise clarification of<br>
the harvest, followed by Protein-A affinity chromatography, and further purification<br>
using ion (e.g. cation) exchange and mixed mode (e.g. ceramic hydroxyapatite)<br>
chromatography unit operations. A virus removal nanofiltration is followed by a final<br>
ultrafiltration/diafiltration step that enables formulation suitable for the intended route<br>
of administration.<br><br>
