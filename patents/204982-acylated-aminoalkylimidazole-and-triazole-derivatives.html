A solution of 1.24 g of 4'-chlorobiphenyl-4-carbonyl-[2(R)-hydroxy-2-phenylethyl] amide in 20 ml of pyridine is cooled in an ice bath and treated with a solution of 921 mg of methanesulfonic acid anhydride in dichloromethane. The reaction mixture is stirred for additional 16 hours at 5 °, ethyl acetate and saturated aqueous sodium hydrogencarbonate are added, the organic layer is separated, dried and concentrated in vacuo. Vacuum flash chromatography on silicagel (toluene / ethyl acetate = 3/1) yields the compound as pale yellow crystals; m.p.: 121.5° (recrystallized from ethanol); fa]D20 = + 133.5° (c = 1.3, methanol); 1H-NMR (CDCI3) S = 8.09/ 7.63/ 7.56/ 7.43 (4d, J = 8.5 Hz; 8H); 7.44-7.36 (m; 5H); 5.68 (dd.

H)  (+) and (-&gt;-1-Amino-1--2-ethane<br>
a)  1-[(1S)-Camphanoyl]amino-1-(5-chloro-2-pyridyl)-2-(1H-imidazol-1-yI)ethane<br>
To a solution of 0.38 g of 1-amino-1-(5-chloro-2-pyridyl)-2-(1H-imidazol-1-yl)ethane (racemic compound, see A) above) in 4 mi of dry dichloromethane is added 0.26 g (0.36 ml) of triethylamine. The mixture is stirred and cooled to-79°. Then 0.44 g of (1S)(-)-camphanic acid chloride are added in such a way that the temperature does not exceed -74°. Stirring is continued for additionally 90 minutes without further cooling. For working up the mixture is poured onto ice-water, extracted three times with dichloromethane and washed with brine. After drying with sodium sulfate the solvent is evaporated. A mixture of the two diastereomeric amides is     obtained     which     is     separated     by     chromatography     over     silicagel<br><br>
(dichloromethane / methanol / heptane = 10/1 / 5). The two compounds are obtained as white crystals:<br>
-	diastereomer B:  m.p.: 195-199°<br>
-	diastereomer A:  m.p.: 151-160°.<br>
b) (+)- and H-1-Amino-1-(5-chloro-2-pyridyl)-2-(1H-imidazol-1-yl)ethane<br>
0.16 g of the camphanoyl diastereomer B are heated with 0.8 ml of 35% perchloric acid in a glass autoclave for 12 hours at 120°. After dilution with 2 ml of water the mixture is extracted with ethyl acetate (which is discarded). The aqueous phase is made alkaline with 2N sodium hydroxide and extracted three times with ethyl acetate. The organic layer is dried over magnesium sulfate and evaporated to dryness. Chromatography over silicagel (dichloromethane / methanol / heptane = 10/1/5 -» 7/1/ 4) yields the (+)-enantiomeric title compound (B isomer) as a pale yellow oil:<br>
'H-NMR (CDCI3) 5 =: 8.57 (d, J=2.5Hz, 1H); 7.61 (dd, J, 2.5, J2 = 8.3Hz, 1H);7.38(s, 1H); 7.13 (d, J^ 8.3; 1H); 7.02 (s, 1H); 6.83 (s, 1H); 4.32-4.14 (m, 3H); 1.73 (s,b, 2H).<br>
Analogously as described above the (-)-enantiomeric title compound (A isomer) is obtained by hydrolysis of the camphanoyl diastereoisomer A.<br>
I)  2-Phenyl-2"(1H-imidazol-1-yl)-1-aminoethane<br>
The compound is obtained from 2-phenylazirrdine analogously as described above under E) c). Chromatography on silicagel (dichloromethane * methanol / aqueous NH3 = 10/1/0.1) gives the title compound as a cotouttess viscous oil<br><br>
The compounds of formula I in free form or pharmacologically acceptable salt form, hereinafter briefly referred to as "the agents of the invention", exhibit pharmacological activity and are therefore indicated for use as pharmaceuticals, in particular they are strong, selective inhibitors of the 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 - hydroxylases, which attack the C20-27 - side chain of calcitriol, e.g. the 25(OH)D3-24-hydroxylase, and thereby catabolize hormonally active vitamin D3-metabolites (e.g. calcitriol), while they interfere much more weakly with the synthesis of calcitriol itself, which occurs via the 25(OH)D3~1 -hydroxylase.<br>
Selective inhibition may e.g. be determined by the following test methods:<br>
Activity of the 1-hydroxylase:<br>
This can be determined in confluent cultures of human keratinocytes directly, while for determination of the activity of the hydroxylases attacking the C20-27 - side chain a 16 hours pretreatment schedule of the confluent cultures with 1,25(OH)2D3 (10 nM) has to precede which upregulates these activities (both methods arc described in Bikle, D.D. et al., J. Clin. Invest. 78, 557 [1986]).<br>
Keratinocyte cultures:<br>
Normal human keratinocytes are isolated from fresh adult skin obtained from mammary reduction and immediately used under stenle conditions, isolation and cultivation under serum-free conditions and without a feeder layer follows a modified protocoll as used by Bikle et al., Biochemistry 25 (1986) 1545-1548. These conditions are chosen in order to avoid undefined contributions from vitamin D - metabolites possibly retained in the serum and/or feeder layer. After separation of the epidermis from the dermis with a sterile dermatome the epidermis is incubated in a 0.25 % trypsin solution for 45 minutes at 37°. Thereafter the cells are scraped off and put in 50 ml of HBSS containing 10 % FGS to block further trypsin digestion and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 2 minutes. The resulting ceil peilet suspended in KGM, a defined serum-free medium at low (0.06 mM) calcium concentration containing 0.1 ng/ml EGF, 5 pg/ml insulin, 0.5 pg/ml hydrocortisone, bovine pituitary extract and antibiotics (gentamycin, amphothericin) gives the primary culture. After 24 hours at 37° in an incubator with carbogen gassing (95 % Os/ 5 % C02) the unattached cells are removed, the flask washed and provided with fresh KGM.   The culture medium is changed then every alternate day and the cells are<br><br>
passaged when they reach 80-90% confluency (usually 6 to 10 days after plating). For passaging old KGM is removed and the attached keratinocytes displaced by a short treatment (5 minutes) with 0.125 % of trypsin, then put into HBSS + FCS, centrifuged and eventually resuspended in KGM in such a way that 1 plate of primary culture yields 3 plates first passage cells. In order to expand the final cell number keratinocytes are further cultivated as described above and generally used in their second passage.<br>
a) Selective inhibition of vitamin D3 - hydroxylases:<br>
Confluent cultures of human keratinocytes in KGM at low calcium (0.06 mM) have a high capacity to produce calcitriol via the 1-hydroxylase, however, activities of sequential metabolism via side chain oxidation are almost entirely lacking. Therefore, the inhibition of the 1-hydroxylase in the confluent cultures is determined directly, and the inhibition of sequential metabolism after up-regulation of the respective hydroxyJases, e.g. the 24-hydroxylase, is determined by an overnight (17 hours) pretreatment with 10 nM of calcitriol as described by Bikle et al. (1986) (supra).<br>
The activities of the 1-hydroxylase and of particular steps in the sequential metabolism [e.g. formation of 1,24,25(OH)3D3 + 1,24oxo,25(OH)2D3] which still retain calcitriol-like activities, the formation of 3-epi caicitrio! metabolites, of polar metabolites retained in the water phase and those indicative of side-chain cleavage and their inhibition by the test compounds are determined by following the oxidation of 3H-25(OH)D? (Amersham; specific activity about 0.61 mCi/nmole) as follows:<br>
Confluent human ke-atinocytes In 1 mt of KGM and in 6-weti plates are incubated in duplicate at 37° with 3H-2S{OH)D3 for 1 hour (1 -hydroxylase), 4 hours (sequential metabolism) and for a range of time interals between 1 and 24 hours, without and after preincubation with 10 nM of calcitriol, and without and with test inhibitory compounds added in a concentration range between 0 and 10 yM Thereafter, the reaction is stopped with 1 m! of methanol per we!!, the cells are scraped off, transferred to a test tube together with the supernatant and two washings (with 1 ml of methanol and 0.8 ml of water). Unmodified 3H-25(OH)D3 and most of the products are totally extracted from the combined solutions and the cell pellet by sequential extractions with 2.1 ml and 1 ml of CHCI3 at room temperature. 3H-activity in the CHCI3-phase, in the water, and total 3H-yield is determined. Incubations for extended time intervals (&gt; 4 hours) give rise to a high increase of 3H-activity in the wafer phase due to highly polar metabolites and<br><br>
a significant loss of 3H-activity in volatile products, almost entirely due to side chain cleavage in which the 3H-label at C26/27 is split off. The combined CHCI3 extracts are then evaporated under argon ai 35°, the residues dissolved in 0.4 mi of ethanoi and an aliquot subjected to HPLC-analysis on a Zorbax-Sil column (Dupont; 4.6 x 250 mm) using a non-linear gradient from 97 : 3 to 85 : 15 of hexane : 2-propanol at a flow rate of 2 ml/min and a total run time of 70 minutes. Substrate and individual metabolites are assigned to peaks by matching with unlabeled standards in co-chromatography. The extent of distinctive product formation in the presence of a particular inhibitor at concentrations ranging from 0 to 10 pM is determined and the strength of inhibition (IC50) calculated from a Dixon Plot (1/rate versus inhibitor concentration). Selectivity can be assessed by comparing the IC50 values of a distinct inhibitor for particular sequential processes and for the 1-hydroxylase.<br>
b) 3H-Thymidine incorporation into human keratinocytes - antiproliferative effects of vitamin D - metabolites in the presence of selective inhibitors of their catabolism:<br>
3H-Thymidine incorporation is measured in 96-well plates as follows: Keratinocytes in 200 pi of 'KGM at low calcium concentration are plated at an initial density of 104 cells per well (second passage) and kept for 24 hours at 37° in an incubator with carbogen gassing (95 % O^ / 5 % COz). Thereafter, the test compounds are added in I p! of ethanoi in a range of concentrations between 0 and 10 uM in the presence and absence of 25{OH)D3 or 1a,25(OH)2D3 (both in a range between 0 and 7 nM), each concentration in triplicate. Blanks containing the solvent only or the vitamin D - metabolite are located after each well-triplet. 5 to 10 blanks per plate in the absence of solvent are added. After further 24 hours 50 pi of 3H-thymidine (1 uCi) in KGM are added, incubation continued for an additional 17 hours and eventually stopped by cell harvesting and lysis.<br>
Harvesting is done on a Filtermate 19fi - Harvester (Packard-Canberra), in a first step, the supernatants are soaked through a 96-weli filterplate and washed 3x with water. Measurement of these filterplates as described below clearly shows that no cells with incorporated 3H-activity have been shed off. Then the adherent cells in the incubated plates are released by treatment with 100 pi of 0.125 % trypsin in PBS at 37° for 5 minutes, harvested on a new filterplate and washed 3x with water.  50 pi of scintillation cocktail  (MicroScint O,<br><br>
Packard) are added and 3H-activity is counted on a Microplate Scintillation Counter (Topcount, Packard Canberra).<br>
Data are used as means ± SEM (n = 3). The iC50-values for the inhibition of proliferation by the vitamin D - metabolites in the presence of varying concentrations of inhibitors of side chain metabolism and vice versa are assessed by plotting the inverse proliferation rate versus one inhibitor concentration, with the concentration of the other inhibitors kept constant (Dixon Plot). Independent of the mechanism of inhibition the IC50-values can be read in this plot from the intercept on the x-axis.<br>
The agents of the invention show inhibitory activity in the above tests a) and b) at concentrations of from about 0.01 pM to about 10 pM.<br>
The agents of the invention are therefore indicated for use as selective inhibitors of the 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 - hydroxylases which attack the C20-27 - side chain of vitamin D3, in the treatment of disorders of proliferation and differentiation in vitamin D - responsive tissues, particularly for the treatment of conditions where it is desired to selectively inhibit the catabolism of the hormone calcitriol without interfering with its synthesis from its precursor 25(OH)D3, such as to increase and prolong endogenous hormone levels and therefore exert beneficial effects with respect to proliferation and differentiation, to immune function and to calcium homeostasis, such as, for skin, in hyperproliferative and inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis and eozematous diseases, in degenerative changes of connective tissue both pathologic and accompanying normal aging, in the prevention of hair loss and regeneration of hair growth, and beyond skin, in tumor suppression, in increasing tolerance against ailotransplantates, in rheumatoid arthritis and in bone remodeling.<br>
For these indications the appropriate dosage will, of course, vary depending upon, for example, the agent of the invention used, the host, the mode of application and the intended indication. However, in general, satisfactory results in animals are indicated to be obtained at a daily dosage from about 1 mg/kg to about 20 mg/mg animal body weight. In larger mammals, for example humans, an indicated daily dosage is in the range from about 70 mg to about 1400 mg of an agent of the invention conveniently administered, for example, in divided doses up to two or four times daily for enteral/systemic treatment, and in the concentration range of less than 0.5 %, e.g. 0.1 %, to about 2 % in a cream/solvent for topical treatment.<br><br>
The agents of the invention may be admixed with conventional pharmaceutical^ acceptable diluents and carriers and, optionally, further excipients.<br>
They may be administered by any conventional route, in particular enterally, e.g. orally, e.g. in the form of tablets or capsules, or topically, e.g. in the form of lotions, gels, creams, sprays and solutions such as ophthalmic or nasal solutions or aerosols for local treatment of skin and mucosal membranes, such as the eye, respiratory tract, vagina, oral and nasal cavity.<br>
They may be administered alone or in combination with low doses of calcitriol or with standards such as cyclosporin A (SandimmunR) to enhance immune suppressive and antiinflammatory effects; far lower doses of the individual drugs than usual will reduce undesired side effects. The agents of the invention may substitute for therapy with glucocorticoids (e.g. dexamethasone, betamethasone, prednisolone) and other immune suppressive agents and may supplement treatment with calcitonin and parathyroidal hormone.<br>
The enantiomeric compounds N-[4-(4-chlorophenyl)benzoyl]-2-(1 H-imidazo!-1 -yl)-2(S)-phenyl-1 -aminoethar.e (example 8) and its (R)-enantiomer (example 9), are the preferred agents in the above indications. They are selective inhibitors of the 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 -hydroxylases which attack the C20-27 - side chain of vitamin D3 without interfering with its synthesis from the precursor 25(CH)D3. !t has, for example, been determined that they have an !C50 of between 10 nM and 50 nM in the above two tests a)-and b) for the inhibition of side chain metabolism, eg. for, respectively, the (S)- and the (R)-enantiomer:<br>
-	in test a):   40 nMand12 nM, respectively, as regards stabilization of 3-epi 1,25(OH)2D3 levels<br>
and 45 nM and 19 nM as regards stabilization of levels of the sum of 1,25(OH)2D3, 1,24,25(OH)3D3 and 1,24oxo,25(OH)2D3, but an IC^ of 530 nM and 620 nM, respectively, for inhibition of 1-hydroxylase;<br>
-	in test b):   an IC50 of 30 nM and 35 nM, respectively, as regards the concentration required to<br>
double the antiproliferative effect of ia,25(OH}JD3t and 11 nM and 12 nM for<br>
25(OH)D3. It is, therefore, indicated that for treatment in e.g. psoriasis they may be administered at a concentration of from about 0.1 % to about 0.5 % by topical administration to large mammals, for example humans, by similar modes of administration as conventionally employed.<br><br>
The invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions for e.g. topical application comprising an agent of the invention together with at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. Such compositions may be manufactured in conventional manner by mixing an agent of the invention together with at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. Unit dosage forms contain, for example, from about 20 mg to about 700 mg of active substance.<br>
The use in the treatment of psoriasis is preferred.<br>
The agents of the invention exhibit more pronounced and selective 25(OH)D3 - hydroxylase inhibiting activity than would be expected for structurally similar compounds.<br><br><br>
