Background of the Invention Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to compounds and methods of synthetic preparation in the fields of chemistry and medicine. More specifically, the presenf invention relates to compounds and procedures for making compounds useful in the treatmenf of cancer and the treatment of fungal infections.<br>
Brief Description of the Related Art<br>
.	It is thought that a single, universal cellular mechanism controls the<br>
regulation of the eukaryotic cell cycle process.   See, e.g., Hartwell, L.H. et al, Science<br>
ij<br>
(1989), 246: 629-34. It is also known that when an abnormality arises in the control<br>
mechanism of the cell cycle, cancer or an immune disorder may occur. Accordingly, as is<br>
also known, antitumor agents and immune suppressors may be among the substances that<br>
regulate the cell cycle. Thus, new methods for producing eukaryotic cell cycle inhibitors are<br>
needed as antitumor and immune-enhancing compounds, and should be useful in the<br>
treatment of human cancer as chemotherapeutic, anti-tumor agents. See, e.g., Rob|rge, M. et<br>
a/., Cancer Res. (1994), 54,6115-21.	'<br>
"	Fungi, especially pathogenic fungi and related infections, represent an<br>
increasing clinical challenge. Existing antifungal agents are of limited efficacy and toxicity,<br><br>

Febiger, !v|alvern, PA).<br>
ii [0005}       Recently, it has been reported that tryprostatins A and B (which are<br>
diketopiperazines consisting of proline and isoprenylated tryptophan residues), and five other stracturallV-related diketopiperazines, inhibited cell cycle progression in the M phase, see Cui, C. et'fyl, 1996 J Antibiotics 49:527-33; Cui, C. et al 1996 J Antibiotics 49:53,4^40, and that these compounds also affect the microtubule assembly, see Usui, T. et al. 1998 Biochem /333:543J48; Kondon, M. et al. 1998 J Antibiotics 51:801-04. Furthermore, natural and synthetic compounds have been reported to inhibit mitosis, thus inhibit the eukaryotic cell cycle, by) binding to the colchicine binding-site (CLC-site) on tubulin, which is a macromol|cule that consists of two 50 kDa subunits (a- and (3-tubulin) and is the major constituent of microtubules. See, e.g., Iwasaki, S., 1993 MedRes Rev ISilSS-igj^Hbmel, E. 1996 Medt Res Rev 16:207-31; Weisenberg, R.C. et al., 1969 Biochemistiy 7:4466-79. Microtubules are thought to be involved in several essential cell functions, such as axonal<br>
I<br>
transport, icell motility and determination of cell morphology. Therefore, inhibitors of microtubule function may have broad biological activity, and be applicable to medicinal and<br>
t;<br>
agrochemi|;al purposes. It is also possible that colchicine (CLC)-site ligands such as CLC, steganacinl see Kupchan, S.M. et al., 1973 J Am Chem Soc 95:1335-36, podophyllotoxin, see Sackett, D|L., 1993 Pharmacol Ther 59:163-228, and combretastatins, see Pettit, G.R. et al, 1995 J M$d Chem 38:166-67, may prove to be valuable as eukaryotic cell cycle inhibitors and, thus, may be useful as chemotherapeutic agents.<br><br>
Although diketopiperazine-type metabolites have been isolated from various fungi as myeotoxins, see Horak R.M. et al, i981'\i/(dyrCA*fe' Cbmttt 1263467; Ali M. et al, 1898 Toxicology Letters 48:235-41, or as secondary jxietafeoliies, ^eeSmed|gaard J. et al, 1996 J Microbiol Meth 25:5-17, little is known about the specific structure of the<br>
ij<br>
diketopiperazine-type metabolites or their derivatives and their antitumor . activity, particularly in vivo. Not only have these compounds been isolated as mycoioxins, the chemical synthesis of one type of diketopiperazine-type metabolite, phenylaMstii|, has been described by Hayashi et al. in J. Org. Cheat. (2000) 65, page 8402. In the ar| one such<br>
i;<br>
diketopiperazine-type metabolite derivative, dehydrophenylahistin, has been prepared by enzymatic dehydrogenation of its parent phenylahistin. With the incidences of caicer on the rise, there exists a particular need for chemically producing a class of substantially purified diketopiperazine-type metabolite-derivatives having animal cell-specific pro|liferation-inhibiting activity and high antitumor activity and selectivity. There is therefore a particular need for an efficient method of synthetically producing substantially purified, and structurally and biologically characterized, diketopiperazine-type metabolite-derivatives. j<br>
•-J4K	Also, PCT Publication WO/0153290 (July 26, 2001) describes a non-<br>
synthetic method of producing dehydrophenylahistin by exposing phenylahistm or a particular phenylahistin analog to a dehydrogenase obtained from Streptomyces alb^lus.<br>

I<br>
[0157] Pharmaceutical preparations for oral use may be obtained by jjsombining the active compounds with solid excipient, optionally grinding a resulting mixture, and processing the mixture of granules, after adding suitable auxiliaries, if desired,! to obtain tablets or dragee cores. Suitable excipients are, in particular, fillers such as sugarsj including lactose, sucrose, mannitol, or sorbitol; cellulose preparations such as, for example, maize<br><br>

Dyestuffs or pigments may be adiled to the tablets or dragee coatings for identification or to characterize different combinations of active compound doses. Such formulations can be made using methods known in the art (see, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,733,888 (injectable compositions); 5,726,181 fpoorly water soluble compounds); 5,707,641 (therapeutically active proteins or peptides); |,667,8®9 (lipophilic agents); 5,576,012 (sohibilizing polymeric agents); 5,707,615 (anti-viral I formulations); 5,683,676 (particulate medicaments); 5,654,286 (topical formulations); 5,688,529 (oral suspensions); 5,445,829 (extended release formulations); 5i653,987 (liquid formulations); 5,641,515 (controlled release formulations) and 5,601,845 (spheroid formulations).<br>
[Olf&gt;8] Further disclosed herein are various pharmaceutical compositions well known in| the pharmaceutical art for uses that include intraocular, intranasal, and intraauricular delivery. Pharmaceutical formulations include aqueous ophthalmic solutions of the active compounds in water-soluble form, such as eyedrops, or in gellan gum (Shedden et al., 200fl Chn Ther 23(3):440-50) or hydrogels (Mayer et al., 1996 Ophthalmologica 210:101-3); ophthalmic ointments; ophthalmic suspensions, such as microparticulates, drug-containing small polymeric particles that are suspended in a liquid carrier medium (Joshi, A., 1994 J O4il Pharmacol 10:29-45), lipid-soluble formulations (Aim et al., 1989 Prog Clin Biol Res 3f 2:447-58), and microspheres (Mordenti, 1999 Toxicol Sci 52:101-6); and ocular<br><br>
inserts. Such suitable pharmaceutical formulations are most often and preferably formulated to be sterile, isotonic and buffered for stability and comfort. Pharmaceutical compositions may also include drops and sprays often prepared to simulate in many resf ects nasal secretions to ensure maintenance of normal ciliary action. As disclosed in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Mack Publishing, 18th Edition), and well-known to thosp skilled in the art, suitable formulations are most often and preferably isotonic, slightly ^uffered to<br>
maintain a pH of 5.5 to 6.5, and most often and preferably include antimicrobial preservatives<br>
ii<br>
and appropriate drug stabilizers.   Pharmaceutical formulations for intraauricul^r delivery<br>
3,<br>
include suspensions and ointments for topical application in the ear. Common solvents for<br>
such aural formulations include glycerin and water.	I<br>
[0159]      When used as a cell cycle inhibitor, a mmor-growth-inhibitmg, or a<br>
f<br>
fungus-growth-inhibiting compound, the compound of Formula (I) can be administered by either oral or a non-oral pathways. When administered orally, it can be administered in capsule, tablet, granule, spray, syrup, or other such form. When administered nojji-orally, it can be administered as an aqueous suspension, an oily preparation or the like orf as a drip,<br>
|<br>
suppository, salve, ointment or the like, when administered via injection oi| infusion,<br>
subcutaneously, intreperitoneally, intravenously, intramuscularly, or the like, similarly, it<br>
may be administered topically, rectally, or vaginally, as deemed appropriate by mqse of skill<br>
in the art for bringing the compound into optimal contact with a tumor, thus inhibiting the<br>
growth of the tumor. Local administration at the site of the tumor is also contemplated, either<br>
before or after tumor resection, as are controlled release formulations, depot formulations,<br>
and infusion pump delivery.	I<br>
Methods of Administration	;!<br>
[0160] The present invention also encompasses methods for making and for administering the disclosed chemical compounds and the disclosed pharmaceutical compositions. Such disclosed methods include, among others, (a) administration though oral pathways, which administration includes administration in capsule, tablet, granule, spray, syrup, or other such forms; (b) administration through non-oral pathwaj^, which<br>
:<f></f>
administration includes administration as an aqueous suspension, an oily preparation or the like or as a drip, suppository, salve, ointment or the like; administration via in|ection or<br><br>
infusion, s|bcutaneously, intraperitoneally, intravenously, intramuscularly, intradennally, or the like; j as well as (c) administration topically, (d) administration rectally, or (e) administration vaginally, as deemed appropriate by those of skill in the art for bringing the compoundf into contact with living tissue; and (f) administration via controlled released formulations, depot formulations, and infusion pump delivery. As further examples of such modes of |idmmistration and as further disclosure of modes of administration, disclosed herein are fvarious methods for administration of the disclosed chemical compounds and pharmaceutical compositions including modes of administration through intraocular, intranasal, and intraauricular pathways.<br>
[01^1] The pharmaceutically effective amount of the dehydrophenylahistin or dehydroph|nylahistin analog composition required as a dose will depend on the route of administration, the type of animal, including human, being treated, and the physical characteristics of the specific animal under consideration. The dose can be tailored to achieve a f desired effect, but will depend on such factors as weight, diet, concurrent medication* and other factors which those skilled in the medical arts will recognize.<br>
[OIJ52] In practicing the methods, the products or compositions can be used alone or in combination with one another, or in combination with other therapeutic or diagnostic agents. For example, as disclosed herein, the compounds disclosed herein are effective in the treatment j&amp;f cancer when used in combination with other actives, specifically other chemother^peutics, for example biologies and the specific chemotherapeutics CPT-11, Taxotene (docataxel) and paclitaxel. The compounds disclosed herein are also effective in the treatment of cancer when used in combination with other actives, including anti-vascular agents, anti-angiogenenic agents, such as Erbuitux (Imclone/bristol-Myers) and Iressa (AstraZen
 <br>
subcutaneously, intramuscularly, colonically, rectalty, vaginally, nasally or intoapfsritoneally,<br>
employing a variety of dosage forms. Such methods may also be applied to testii|g chemical<br>
activity in vivo.	I<br>
(0163) As will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art, the useful in vivo dosage to be administered and the particular mode of administration will varyj depending upon the age, weight and mammalian species treated, the particular compounds} employed, and the specific use for which these compounds are employed. The deternfination of effective dosage levels, that is the dosage levels necessary to achieve the desiredfresult, can be accomplished by one skilled hi the art using routine pharmacological methods. I Typically, human clinical applications of products are commenced at lower dosage levels, vfith dosage level being increased until the desired effect is achieved. Alternatively, acceptable in vitro studies can be used to establish useful doses and routes of administration of the compositions identified by the present methods using established pharmacological methods. j<br>
[0164] hi non-human animal studies, applications of potential products are commenced at higher dosage levels, with dosage being decreased until the desired |ffect is no longer achieved or adverse side effects disappear. The dosage may range broadly, jdepending upon the desired affects and the therapeutic indication. Typically, dosages may tjje between about 10 microgram/kg and 100 mg/kg body weight, preferably between fbout 100 microgram/kg and 10 mg/kg body weight Alternatively dosages may be |ased and calculated upon the surface area of the patient, as understood by those of skill In the art.<br>
|<br>
Administration may be oral on an every third day, every other day, daily, twice daili, or thrice<br>
daily basis.	jj<br>
P<br>
[0165] The exact formulation, route of administration and dosage canjbe chosen by the individual physician in view of the patient's condition. See for example, Fintl et al., in The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 1975. It should be noted that thej attending physician would know how to and when to terminate, interrupt, or adjust administration due to toxicity, or to organ dysfunctions. Conversely, the attending physician would als|o know to adjust treatment to higher levels if the clinical response were not adequate (precluding toxicity). The magnitude of an administrated dose in the management of the disorder of interest will vary with the severity of the condition to be treated and to the! route of<br>
32-<br><br>
administration. The severity of the condition may, for example, be evaluated, in part, by standard prognostic evaluation methods. Further, the dose and perhaps dose frequency, will also vary according to the age, body weight, and response of the individual patient. A program cdbiparable to that discussed above may be used in veterinary medicine.<br>
[01JB6] Depending on the specific conditions being treated, such agents may be formulated! and administered systemically or locally. A variety of techniques for formulation and administration may be found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed., Mack Publishing! Co., Baston, PA (1990). Suitable administration routes may include oral, rectal, transdermajjl, vaginal, transmucosal, or intestinal administration; parenteral delivery, including intramuscular, subcutaneous, intramedullary injections, as well as intrathecal, direct intraventrieular, intravenous, via infusion, intraperitoneal, intranasal, or intraocular injections. •<br>
[01JS7] For injection or infusion, the agents may be formulated hi aqueous solutions, jlfor example, in physiologically compatible buffers such as Hanks' solution, Ringer's solution, or physiological saline buffer. For such transmucosal administration, penetrants f appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrantsfare generally known in the art. Use of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers to formulate JBie compounds herein disclosed for the practice of the invention into dosages suitable fojjr systemic administration is within the scope of the invention. With proper choice Of carrier! and suitable manufacturing practice, the compositions disclosed herein, in particular,}those formulated as solutions, may be administered parenterally, such as by intravenous injection or infusion. The compounds can be formulated readily using pharmaceijtically acceptable carriers well known in the art into dosages suitable for oral administration. Such carriers enable the compounds to be formulated as tablets, pills, capsules, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions and the like, for oral ingestion by a patient to fce treated.<br>
[0168] Agents intended to be administered intracellularly may be administered using techniques well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. For example, such agents may be encapsulated into liposomes, then administered as described above. All molecules present inf an aqueous solution at the time of liposome formation are incorporated into the<br><br>
aqueous interior. The liposomal contents are both protected from the exte&amp;al micro-<br>
environment and, because liposomes fuse with cell membranes, are efficiently delivered into<br>
the cell cytoplasm. Additionally, due to their hydrophobicity, small organic molecules may<br>
be directly administered intracellularly.	i<br>
[0169]      Determination of the effective amounts is well within the capability of<br>
|<br>
those skilled in the art, especially in light of the detailed disclosure provided herein. In addition to the active ingredients, these pharmaceutical compositions may contain suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers comprising excipients and auxiliaries which facilitate processing of the active compounds into preparations which can be used pharm|ceuticaUy. The preparations formulated for oral administration may be in the form of tablelp, dragees, capsules, or solutions. The pharmaceutical compositions may be manufactured i^ a manner that is itself known, for example, by means of conventional mixing, dissolving, granulating, dragee-making, levitating, emulsifying, encapsulating, entrapping, or lyophilizing processes.<br>
[0170] Compounds disclosed herein can be evaluated for efficacy a$d toxicity using known methods. For example, the toxicology of a particular compound, or pf a subset of the compounds, sharing certain chemical moieties, may be established by determining in vitro toxicity towards a cell line, such as a mammalian, and preferably human, cell line. The<br>
I<br>
results of such studies are often predictive of toxicity in animals, such as mammae, or more specifically, humans. Alternatively, the toxicity of particular compounds in an animal model, such as mice, rats, rabbits, or monkeys, may be determined using known methods. The efficacy of a particular compound may be established using several art recognized methods, such as in vitro methods, animal models, or human clinical trials. Art-recogniz4d in vitro<br>
models exist for nearly every class of condition, including the conditions abated by the<br>
!<br>
compounds disclosed herein, including cancer, cardiovascular disease and various fungal<br>
infections. Similarly, acceptable animal models may be used to establish efficacy of<br>
chemicals to treat such conditions. When selecting a model to determine efficacy, ihe skilled<br>
artisan can be guided by the state of the art to choose an appropriate model, dose, a$d route of<br>
administration, and regime. Of course, human clinical trials can also be used to determine the<br>
efficacy of a compound in humans.	-3 +<br><br>
[0|71J When used as an anti-cancer agent, or a tumor-growth-inhibiting compoun4 the compounds disclosed herein may be administered by either oral or a non-oral pathways.! When administered orally, it can be administered in capsule, tablet, granule, spray, syrup, or jother such form. When administered non-orally, it can be administered as an aqueous suspension, an oily preparation or the like or as a drip, suppository, salve, ointment or the likf, when administered via injection or infusion, subcutaneous!/, intreperitoneally, intraveno^ry, inframuscularly, intradermally, or the like. Similarly, it may be administered topically, fectally, or vaginally, as deemed appropriate by those of skill in the art for bringing the compound into optimal contact with a tumor, thus inhibiting the growth of the tumor. Local adnjinistration at the site of the tumor or oilier disease condition is also contemplated, either befdre or alter tumor resection, or as part of an art-recognized treatment of the disease condition.} Controlled release formulations, depot formulations, and infusion pump delivery are similarly contemplated.<br>
[OJ72J When used as an anti-cancer agent or an anti-tumor agent, may be orally or non-orall)| administered to a human patient in the amount of about .0007 mg/day to about 7,000 ragJday of the active ingredient, and more preferably about 0.07 mg/day to about 70 mg/day of? the active ingredient at, preferably, one time per day or, less preferably, over two to about tfn times per day. Alternatively and also preferably, the compound may preferably be administered in the stated amounts continuously by, for example, an intravenous drip. Thus, for |i patient weighing 70 kilograms, the preferred daily dose of the active anti-tumor ingredientfwould be about 0.0007 mg/kg/day to about 35 mg/kg/day including 1.0 mg/kg/day and 0.5 rcjg/kg/day, and more preferable, from 0.007 mg/kg/day to about 0.050 mg/kg/day, including 0.035 mg/kg/day. Nonetheless, as will be understood by those of skill in the art, in certain situations it may be necessary to administer the anti-tumor compound in amounts that<br>
?<br>
excess, o^j even far exceed, the above-stated, preferred dosage range to effectively and aggressively treat particularly advanced or lethal tumors.<br>
[0|73] When used as an antifungal agent the preferable amount of the dehydrophfenylahistin or its analog effective in the treatment or prevention of a particular fungal palhogen will depend in part on the characteristics of the fungus and the extent of infection, and can be determined by standard clinical techniques. In vitro or in vivo assays<br><br>
may optionally be employed to help identity optimal dosage ranges. Effective dojjtes may be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro analysis or prefe -ably from animal models. The precise dosage level should be determined by the attending p tysician or other health care provider and will depend upon well known factors, includir g route of administration, and the age, body weight, sex and general health of the individual; the nature, severity and clinical stage of the infection; the use (or not) of concomitant therapie .<br>

are well k|K&gt;wn in the pharmaceutical art, and are described, for example, in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co. (A.R. Gennaro edit. 1985). For example, such compositions may be formulated and used as tablets, capsules or solutions for oral administration; suppositories for rectal or vaginal administration; sterile solutions or suspensions for injectable administration. Injectables can be prepared in conventional forms, either as liquid solutions or suspensions, solid forms suitable for solution or suspension in liquid prior to injection or infusion, or as emulsions. Suitable excipients include, but are not limited toj saline, dextrose, mannitol, lactose, lecithin, albumin, sodium glutamate, cysteine hydrochlo^de, aad the like. In addition, if desired, the injectable pharmaceutical compositions may contain minor amounts of nontoxic auxiliary substances, such as wetting agents, pH buffering agents, and the like. If desired, absorption enhancing preparations (for example, Bposomes), may be utilized.<br>
[0^77] The pharmaceutically effective amount of the composition required as a dose will {depend on the route of administration, the type of animal being treated, and the physical characteristics of the specific animal under consideration. The dose can be tailored to achieve a desired effect, but will depend on such factors as weight, diet, concurrent<br>

appreciated by those of skill in the art	;<br>
EXAMPLE 1	,;<br>
A.       Synthesis of Dehvdropjienylahistin	;<br>
[0200] Dehydrophenylahistin was synthesized by condensation acconjjing to the<br>
following basic reaction scheme, as shown in Figure 1:	'•,<br><br><br><br><br><br>
[021)1]       25.0 g of global 2,5-piperazinedione 1 [2,5-piperazinedione (Aldrich G640-6), 2J5.0 g, 0.218 mol] in 100 mL of acetic anhydride (Ac2O) was mixed with sodium<br>
i<br>
acetate (N|OAc) (17.96 g, .0218 mol). The mixture was heated at 110°C for 8 h using a double co^ed condenser under an Ar atmosphere. After AcjO was removed by evaporation, the residui was dissolved in AcOEt, washed with 10% citric acid, 10% NaHCOs and saturated If aCl (three times each), dried over NajSO/t, and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was triturdjted with ether to form a solid. This solid was recrystallized from EtOAc with ether-hexafie to afford 26.4 g (61%) of N,N'-diacetyl-2,5-piperazinedione 1.<br>
piperazineflione 2<br>
[02J)2] To a solution of 5-(l,l-dimethyl-2-propenyl)imidazole-4-carboxaldehyde (100 mg, (|.609 mmol) in DMF (2 mL) was added compound 1 (241 mg, 1 .22 mmol) and the solution wjas repeatedly evacuated in a short time to remove oxygen and flushed with Ar, followed fy the addition of Cs2COj (198 mg, 0.609 mmol) and the evacuation-flushing process w|s repeated again. The resultant mixture was stirred for 5 h at room temperature. After the sfolvent was removed by evaporation, the residue was dissolved in the mixture of EtOAc an| 10% NaaCOj, and the organic phase was washed with 10% NaaCOa again and saturated iffaCl for three times, dried over NaaSCU and concentrated in vacuo. The residual oil was purified by column chromatography on silica using CHCla-MeOH (100:0 to 50:1) as an eluant tj&gt; give 60 mg (33 %) of a pale yellow solid 2. Dehydrop|envlahigtin<br>
[0^03] To a solution of 2 (30 mg, 0.099 mmol) in DMF (0.8 mL) was added benzaldeh^de (5 1 uL, 0.496 mmol, 5 eq) and the solution was repeatedly evacuated in a short time to refnove oxygen and flushed with Ar, followed by the addition of CsaCOa (53 mg, 0.149 mmol, 1.5 eq) and the evacuation-flushing process was repeated again. The resultant mixture w|is heated for 2.5 h at 80°C. (The temperature must be increased slowly. Rapid heating increases the production of E-isomer at the benzylidene moiety.) After the solvent was removed by evaporation, the residue was dissolved in EtOAc, washed with water for two<br><br>
i!<br>
times and saturated Nad for three times, dried over Na2SC&gt;4 and concentrated in \acuo. On TLC using CHCU-MeOH (10:1), you can observe a spot with bright grien-yellow luminescence at 365 nm UV. The purity of this crude product was more than J75% from HPLC analysis. The resulting residue was dissolved in 90% MeOH aq and jjapplied to reverse-phase HPLC column (YMC-Pack, ODS-AM, 20 x 250 mm) and eluted usiig a linear gradient from 70 to 74% MeOH in water over 16 min at a flow rate of 12 mL/m n, and the<br><br>
desired fraction was collected and concentrated by evaporation to give a 19.7 mj<br><br>
(60%) of<br><br>
yellow   colored   dehydrophenylahistin.      The   HPLC   profile   of the   synth
;<br>
dehydrophenylahistin is depicted in Figure 2.	[0204] In the purification of dehydrophenylahistin, as shown in Figure J4, a major peak was the desired Z- form compound of dehydrophenylahistin. The formatiojii of an E-isomer was observed as a minor component (about 10%), which was eluted as a |nore polar peak than Z-isomer. As other minor peaks, the reduced Z- and jE-compounds, injwhich the dimethylallyl part of dehydrophenylahistin was reduced, was also observed. The! formation of these reduced compounds was due to the aldehyde 2 with a reduced impurity, |vhich was generated during the reduction of with DIBAL-H and was not separated in the subsequent<br>
f<br>
process.<br>
[0205] These minor compounds could be removed by preparative HPLC purification, afforded dehydrophenylahistin with the Z-configuration at the benzy^dene part in a 60% yield (20% yield in two steps) with more than 95% purity. The compounds with E-<br>
ij<br>
configuration at the imidazole side of the diketopiperazine ring were not observed in this<br>
HPLC chart, suggesting that the first reaction from compound 1 to 3 in Figufre 1 is Z-<br>
selective.	B.       Chemical Characteristics:	jj<br>
[0206] The above dehydrophenylahistin compound is a pale yellow jjsolid. Its structure is confirmed by standard NMR analyses.<br><br>

[0220] The sequence of introduction of the aldehydes is a relevant to thfe yield and is therefore aspect of the synthesis. An analogue of dehydrophenylahistin was synthesized, as<br><br>
a control of model, wherein the dimethylallyl group was changed to the tert-butyl group with a similar static hindrance at the 5-position of the imidazole ring.<br>
[02JJ1] The synthesis of this "tert-butyl (tBu)-dehydrophenylahistin" using "Route A" was as Ishown above: Particularly, the sequence of introduction of the aldehyde exactly follows th^ dehydrophenylahistin synthesis, and exhibited a total yield of 16.5% tBu-dehydroph|nylahistin. This yield was similar to that of dehydrophenylahistin (20%). Using "Route B"j where the sequence of introduction of the aldehydes is opposite that of Route "A" for the dehydrophenylahistin synthesis, only a trace amount of the desired tBu-dehydroPLH was obtained with a total yield of 0.9%, although in the introduction of first benzaldehyde 4 gave a 76^o yield of the intermediate compound 17. This result indicated that it may be difficult tojj introduce the highly bulky imidazole-4-carboxaldehydes 15 with a substituting group having a quaternary-carbon on the adjacent 5-position at the imidazole ring into the intermediate compound 17, suggesting that the sequence for introduction of aldehydes is an important aspect for obtaining a high yield of dehydrophenylahistin or an analog of dehydroph|nylahistin employing the synthesis disclosed herein:<br>
|<br>
[02JZ2] From the HPLC analysis of the final crude products, as shown in Figure 4, a very higl| content of tBu-dehydrophenylahistin and small amount of by-product formations were obscured in the crude sample of Route A (left). However, a relatively smaller amount of the desifed tBu-dehydrophenylahistin and several other by-products were observed in the sample obtained using Route B (right).<br><br>

The evacuation-flushing process was repeated a further two times, then cesium carbonate (4.70 g, 1^4 mmol) was added. The evacuation-flushing process was repeated a further three times, the^ the resultant mixture was heated under the temperature gradient ad shown below.<br>
[0368] After a total time of 5 h the reaction was allowed to cool to room temperature and the mixture was added to ice-cold water (500 ml). The precipitate was collected, gashed with water (300 ml), then freeze-dried to afford a yellow solid (2.80 g). This material was dissolved in chloroform (250 ml) filtered through filter paper and evaporate^ to azeotrope remaining water. The residual yellow precipitate (2.70 g, HPLC (214nm) |R = 7.26 (93.6%) min.) was partially dissolved in chloroform (20 ml), the suspension was sonicated for 5 min, then the solid was collected and air dried to afford 3-Z-benzylidei|e-6-[5"-(l,l-dimemylallyl)-l^-irmdazol-4"-Z-ylmethylene]-piperazine-2,5-dione (1.82 g, 54%) (Hayashi, Personal Communication (2001)), m.p. 239-240° (dec.).<br>

[03|i&gt;l] To a solution of 5-(l,l-dimethyl-2-propenyl)imidazole-4-carboxaldehyde (100 mg, 01609 mmol) in DMF (2 mL) was added compound 1 (241 mg, 1.22 mmol) and the solution wfts repeatedly evacuated in a short time to remove oxygen and flushed with AT, followed l}y the addition of CsaCOs (198 mg. 0.609 mmol) and the evacuation-flushing process w*s repeated again. The removal of oxygen is preferred because such removal is believed toi decrease oxidation of alpha-carbon at the position 6 of the diketopiperazine ring. The resultant mixture was stirred for 5 h at room temperature. After the solvent was removed by evaporation, the residue was dissolved in the mixture of EtOAc and 10% Na2CO3, and the organic phpe was washed with 10% Na2COs again and saturated NaCl for three times, dried over Naa(fO3 and concentrated in vacuo. The residual oil was purified by column chromatoglaphy on silica using CHCh-MeOH (100:0 to 50:1) as an eluant to give 60 mg (33%) of afpale yellow solid 2. Dehydroplienylahistin<br>
[0^62] To a solution of 2 (30 mg, 0.099 mmol) in DMF (0.8 mL) was added benzaldelr|de (51 \iL, 0.496 mmol, 5 eq) and the solution was repeatedly evacuated in a short time to remove oxygen and flushed with Ar, followed by the addition of CsaCOs (53 mg, 0.149 mm$&gt;l, 1.5 eq) and the evacuation-flushing process was repeated again. The resultant mixture wfes heated for 2.5 h at 80°C. (The temperature must be increased slowly. Rapid heating increases the production of E-isomer at the benzylidene.moiety.) After the solvent was renwvijed by evaporation, the residue was dissolved in EtOAc, washed with water for two times and isaturated NaCl for three times, dried over NaaSCU and concentrated in vacuo. On TLC using CHCU-MeOH (10:1), you can observe a spot with bright green-yellow luminescence at 365 nm UV. The purity of this crude product was more than 75% from<br><br>

Biological Characteristics of Dehvdrophenylahistin and Dehvdrophenvlahistin Analogs<br>
A.       Biological Evaluation	I<br>
[03631 The biological characteristics of synthesized tBu-dehydrophinylahistin and dehydrophenylahistin were evaluated in both HT29 human colon cells, land PC-3 prostatic adenocarcinoma cells.<br>
[0364] HT-29 (ATCC HTB-38) a human colorectal adenocarcii|oma was maintained in McCoy's complete medium (McCoy's 5A medium with L-glutamine and 25mM HEPES supplemented with 10% FBS, ImM Na pyruvate, IX NEAA| 2mM L-<br>
glutamine, and Pen/Strep at lOOIU/ml and 100ng/ml, respectively).   PC-3 .(ATJJCC CRL-<br>
t<br>
1435), a human prostate adenocarcinoma, was maintained in F12K complete medium (F12K medium supplemented with 10% FBS; 2mM Glutamine; 1% HEPES; and Pe|i/Strep at<br>
lOOIU/ml and lOO^ig/ml, respectively). Cell lines were cultured at 37 °C, 5% CC)| in a 95%<br>
i humidified incubator.<br>
[0365] For tumor cytotoxicity assays HT-29 or PC-3 cells were seedej^ at 5,000<br>
cells/well in 90 ul complete media into a Corning 3904 black-walled, clear-bot|om tissue<br>
culture plate and the plate were incubated overnight to allow cells to establish an
phase growth. 20 mM stock solutions of dehydrophenylahistin and tBu-dehydrophanylahistin<br>
were prepared in 100% DMSO and stored at -20 °C. 10X concentrated serial dilutions of the<br>
two compounds were prepared in appropriate culture medium for final concentrations ranging<br>
from 2.0 x 10"5 M to 2.0 x 10"'° M. Ten jil volumes of the 10X serial dilutions werjb added to<br>
the test wells in triplicate and the plates returned to the incubator for 48 hours. JThe final<br>
concentration of DMSO was 0.25% in all samples.	I<br>
[0366] Following 48 hours of drug exposure 10 p.1 of 0.2 mg/ml j resazurin (obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co.) in Mg2+, Ca2+ free PBS was added tof each well<br>
"72-<br><br>
and the plaftes were returned to the incubator for 3-4 hours. The plates were removed and resazurin fluorescence was measured using 530 nm excitation and 590 nm emission filters in a Fusion fiuorimeter (Packard Instruments). Resazurin dye without cells was used to determine |he background, which was subtracted from the data for all experimental wells. The data were analyzed using Prism software (GraphPad Software). The data were normalized! to the average of the cells treated with media only (100% cell growth) and ECso values wer| determined using a standard sigmoidal dose response curve fitting algorithm.<br>
[03f7]      As indicated in Table 1 below, tBu-dehydrophenylahistin demonstrates about a 4-t|mes greater cytotoxic activity in comparison with dehydrophenylahistin. Table 1. Cytotoxic Effect of dehydrophenylahistin and derivative.<br><br>

C.        Evaluation of dehvdropheflylahistin derivatives<br>
[0381] Evaluation of derivatives described above is assessed according to the methods described in Example 3. Additional evaluation of the derivatives are extended to specific activities such as determining the inhibiting effect on cell proliferation, thej effects on a specific cellular mechanism (i.e. microtuble function), effects on cell cycle progression, evaluating in vitro anti-tumor activity against cancer cell lines, etc. Some evaluation method protocols are given below.<br><br>
V) Qell Proliferation Inhibiting Effect of Dehvdrophenvlahistin And Its Analogs [•382] Into each well of a 96-well microtiter plate, 100^1 of A-549 cells derived from human hag cancer prepared to 10s cells/ml in a culture medium obtained by adding 10% bo'fine fetus serum to EMEM culture medium (Nissui Seiyaku Co., Ltd.) having antitumofr effect against A-549 cells derived from human lung cancer are placed. Methanol solution <t>f the derivative obtained by the above-listed examples are added to the wells of the uppermost row, specimens are diluted by the half-log dilution method and added, and the plate is incubated in a carbon dioxide gas incubator at 37°C for 48 hours. The result is added in lots |of lOfil with MTT reagent (3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-fliiazole)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetra bromide)J!(lmg/ml • PBS), followed by incubation in a carbon dioxide gas incubator at 37 °C for 6 ho^rs. The culture medium is discarded and the crystal of produced in the cells are dissolved in 100)jl/well of dimethylsulfoxide. Absorption of 595 nm light is then measured with a mjcroplate reader. By comparing the light absorptions of the untreated cells to that of cells treafted with a specimen of a known concentration, the specimen concentration that inhibitedjcell proliferation 50% (ICso) is calculated.<br>
2} Cell Cycle Inhibiting Activity of Dehvdrophenvlahistin And Its Analogs [0383] Cell strain A431 is derived from human lung cancer. EMEM culture medium Containing 10% bovine fetal serum and 1% MEM nonessential amino acid solution (SIGMAJM2025) is used to incubate A431 cells at 37 °C in an incubator saturated with 5% carbon dioxide gas and water vapor. The refined specimen of dehydrophenylahistin obtained by the methods above is added to the cells in the log-growth phase and progression of the cell cycle is analyzed by flow cytometer and microscopic observation.<br>
[0884]       The effect on cell cycle progression of HeLa cells is depicted in Figure 42.<br>

Derivatives<br>
1)        Overview in derivative syntheses<br>
[dbsSJ Many, but not all, of the derivatives of dehydroPLH disclosed herein include ope, two, or three modifications at the phenyl ring (Figure 5 below). The derivatives were syrrifhesized by the methods described above. As shown in Table 5, certain compounds<br><br>
showed more potent cytotoxic activity than dehydroPLH and ffiu-dehydroPLHl The most potent compound exhibiting an EC50 value of 3 nM was KPU-90. This value vfas 16-times and 4-times higher than that of dehydroPLH and tBu-dehydroPLH, respectively. These derivatives have mono-substitution at the o- or m-position of the phenyl ring with the halogen atoms such as fluorine and chlorine atoms or the methyl, vinyl or metHoxy group. Derivatives with substitutions to heteroaryl structures such as the npahthalene, th|ophene and furan rings also elicited a potent activity.. KPU-35, 42, 69, 80 and 81 also shqwed higher activity than tBu-dehydroPLH.<br>

[0387] The result demonstrated that substitutions at the w- or o-positioft increased cytotoxic activity against HT-29 cells. KPU-9 and 16 showed high activity. The methoxy-derivatives with triple substitution (KPU-11, 17 and 45) also showed activity. Thfc structure of KPU-24 was assigned by MASS analysis.<br>
3)        Modification with the electron-withdrawing groups<br>
[0388] To study more expanded structure-activity relationship on the ptyenyl ring, a series of different functional groups were introduced, which include both! electron-withdrawing and -donating groups. The result of «ytotoxiciry against HT-29 cells is shown in Tables 7 and 8, respectively.<br><br>
[03^9]       Substitution at the o- or m-position effectively increased activity.  These results wa|e well consistent with the case of the methoxy group. Table 7. I|gect of the electron-withdrawing group on proliferation of HT-29 cells<br><br>

(03|90] The present disclosure is not bound by or limited to any particular scientific $ieory. Nonetheless, it is appreciated that persons of skill in the art may interpret the resultsjjpresented herein to suggest that a relatively smaller functional group, affecting less steric hindrance, may be preferred to elicit more potent activity, and slightly large groups such as t^e ethoxy group (when compared to the methoxy group) or the Br atom (when compared fto the Cl atom) may affect steric hindrance unfavorable to interaction with, for example, ?the tubulin binding site. Moreover, because the electrical property of these substituenis did not affect the activity, it is suggested that these relatively small substituents do not directly interact with the binding site of p-tubulin, but restrict the conformation of dehydroPJ|H suitable for the binding. Or, as another possible hypothesis, the hydrophobic property niay be a more important factor at the binding site for o- or m-position on P-tubulin, since introduction of the hydrophilic hydroxyl group, which can form the hydrogen bonding as a hydrogen-donor, drastically decreased the activity.<br><br>
[0391] As shown in Table 9, the effect of the substituents in the cytotojijic activity at the o-position may be ordered* as in the case of m-position, as shown in Tabl4 10. The compounds having effective functional groups, which showed higher activity than tBu-dehydroPLH, may also be further modified. And since the migration of the stereochemistry from Z to E under the visible light irradiation was observed, substituents that decrease the electron density in the conjugated double bonds may contribute to the reduction jof Z to E migration by the light, results in more physicochemically stable structures. Tempejrarure can also effect this migration.<br>
[0392] Modification at two parts of the ring can be preferred for the defelopment of potent but also biologically stable compounds. The phenyl ring of phenyjahistin is oxidized by cytochrome P-450. Double modification that reduces the electron density of the phenyl ring may therefore be effective to avoid P-450 oxidation. Thus, the combination of the small electron withdrawing group such as the fluorine atom to the element that can increase the activity such as -OMe, -Me, -Cl, -F and Br, may result in more jjotent and biologically stable drug compounds.<br>

4)       Substitution of the phenyl ring to aryl-heterocycles<br>
[0&amp;93] The phenyl ring may also be replaced by heteroaryl groups. The result of such replacements in terms of the cytotoxic activity is shown in Table 11. Since the arylic nitrogen |toms can form a hydrogen bonding with a NH group of the diketopiperazine ring and restrict the conformation of the molecule between pyridine and diketopiperazine rings to an uniplanar structure, the active conformation of dehydroPLH would be required a certain level of d|hedral angle formed by the steric repulsion between an amide hydrogen atom of the diketopipiprazine ring and an o-hydrogen atom of the phenyl ring (Figure 6).

[03J&gt;4] Replacing the phenyl ring with a smaller furan or thiophene ring, for example, KHJ-29 or -42, exhibited activity. The phenyl ring can be changed to other aromatic slhicture while maintaining the potent activity.<br>
5)	Metabolism of phenylahistin<br>
[03f&gt;5] In the recent his study, (±)-phenylahistin was treated with rat hepatic microsome or human hepatic P450s. In human case at least seven metabolites were detected, and two off them, i.e., PI and P3, were major metabolites, represented more than 60% of the recovered Metabolites.<br>
[0396] Since there is no exo-olefin structure in tBu-dehydroPLH, present synthesized derivatives have no oxidization like PI and P4. However, oxidizations such as P3 and P5S are formed during the hepatic metabolism. Various derivatives, which prevent such metatfolism, are effective to avoid P450 oxidization at the phenyl ring. The imidazole ring can al|o be modified to avoid the unfavorable oxidation.<br>
6)	Physicochemical stability of dehydroPLH<br>
[03&amp;7] The physicochemical stability is one of the unfavorable problems of dehydroPLJH. In phenylahistin, since there is no additional olefin structure at the benzyl part, there is not such problem. However, in dehydroPLH, the benzylidene moiety can be easily activated, |&gt;robably with the visible light, and the Z to E migration frequently occurs due to the existence of longer conjugation of the double bond. This migration occurred even under normal rocjhi light, hi the cytotoxic assay, some of the compounds migrate to £-form during the incubation, almough this migration probably equilibrates at the 1 : 1 ratio in the case of<br>
115<br><br>
dehydroPLH. This migration can be controlled. The Z to E migration is alsof known in combretastatin A4, a same type of tubulin inhibitor, and a few studies for impjjoving this problem were reported.<br>
7)       Prqdrug Synthesis<br>
[0398] The E-form may also be used as a prodrug of dehydroPLH orf of one or more of its analogs, including those analogs described herein. One of thefundesired properties of anti-tubulm drugs involves its low selectivity between tumor and intact tissues, although these drugs belong to one of the molecular target therapies. This causesjundesired side effects. However, if the compounds functions selectively only in tumor tissue^, negative side effects of anti-microtubule drugs can be reduced. Since the dehydroPLH (Z|form) can be produced from its £-isomer by visible light irradiation, the .E-fbrm is administered and photo irradiation is performed only at the tumor site, then only, the tumor is dajmaged by photo-produced Z-form and the adverse effect to the intact tissues is reduced.<br>
[0399] The 2?-fbrm can be protected chemically by the addition of a Jbulky but biodegradable acyl group, which is introduced into the diketopiperazine ring as a prodrug. This acyl group can be cleaved by the protease in the body. Therefore, the ajpylated-E-compound is maintained before administration, then after administration it is chained to the real E-form, which can migrate to the bioactive Z-form by the local photo irradiatioji.<br>
[0400] The synthetic scheme of this acyl-E-form of tBu-dehyd|:oPLH is summarized in Figure 9.<br>

For this purpose, the compound administered or applied is in the fornj of a composition including a pharmacologically acceptable topical carrier, such as a gel, an ointment, a lotion, or a cream, which includes, without limitation, such carriers as water, gly^erol, alcohol, propylene glycol, fatty alcohols, triglycerides, fatty acid esters, or mineral o^ls. Other topical carriers include liquid petroleum, isopropyl palmitate, polyethylene glycol, ethanol (95%), polyoxyethylene monolaurate (5%) in water, or sodium lauryl sulfate (5%) in water. Other materials such as anti-oxidants, hurnectants, viscosity stabilizers^ and similar agents may be added as necessary. Percutaneous penetration enhancers»such as Azone may also be included. In addition, in certain instances, it is expected that the compound may be disposed within devices placed upon, in, or under the skin. Suc|i devices include patches, implants, and injections which release the compound into the skfn, by either passive or active release mechanisms.<br>
EXAMPLES \  In v^ro Pharmacology of KPU-2. KPU-35 and t-butvl phenvlahistin<br>
[04&gt;4] The in vitro efficacy studies performed with KPU-2, KPU-35 and t-butyl phenylahi^tin included: A) a panel of six tumor cell lines, B) studies in multidrug-resistant tumor cellf, and C) studies to determine the mechanism of action.<br><br>
A). Study of KPU-2. KPU-35 and t-butvl phenvlahistinin a panel of six tumor cfol lines<br>
[0405] The following cell lines (source in parentheses) were used: HT|9 (human colon tumor;. ATCC; HTB-38), PCS (human prostate tumor; ATCC; CRL-1435), ljfflDA-MB-231 (human breast tumor; ATCC; HTB-26), NCI-H292 (human non-small cell li|ng tumor; ATCC; CRL-1848), OVCAR-3 (human ovarian tumor; ATCC; HTB-161), B16-FJO (murine melanoma; ATCC; CRL-6475) and CCD-27sk (normal human fibroblast; AT^C; CRL-1475). Cells were maintained at subconfluent densities in their respective culture n|edia.<br>
[0406] Cytotoxicity assays were performed as described above in E|cample 4,<br>
using Resazurin fluorescence as an indicator of cell viability.	;<br>
[0407]       The disclosed compounds are effective agents against a variety off different<br>
and distinct tumor cell lines.   Specifically, for example, KPU-2 and KPU-35 ^ere most<br>
i effective on the HT-29 tumor cell line, both in terms of potency (active in the low aanomolar<br>
range) and efficacy (most responsive in terms of the maximum cytotoxic effec^j); t-butyl-<br>
• ! phenylahistin exhibited its greatest potency against the PC-3 tumor cell line, although the<br>
greatest efficacy was displayed against the HT-29 cell line; KPU-2 and KPlf-35 were generally 10-40 fold more potent than t-butyl-phenylahistin whereas the efficacy A*|as similar for all three compounds in the different tumor cell lines; the HT-29, PC-3, MD.4-MB-231 and NCI-H292 tumor cell lines all responded similarly to the NPI compounds, whereas the B16-F10 appeared to be somewhat less sensitive, t-butyl-phenylahistin displayedja marked differential between normal fibroblasts and the tumor cell lines, with a ratio ranging from &gt;20 - &gt;100, except for the OVCAR-3 cell line.<br><br>

B). Studies in Drue Resistant Cell Lines<br>
[0408] One of the major challenges in the use of chemotherapeutic agents in clinical oncology is the development of resistance to the drug effect by the tumor cells. There are several mechanisms for the development of resistance, each of which will have differential! effects on chemotherapeutic drugs. These mechanisms include increased expression lofATP-dependent efflux pumps such as the P-glycoprotein encoded \syMDRl or the multidirug-resistance associated protein 1 encoded by MRP1. Reduced drug uptake, alteration qjf the drug's target, increasing repair of drug-induced DNA damage, alteration of the apopto^c pathway and the activation of cytochrome P450 enzymes are other examples of mechanises by which cancer cells become resistant to anticancer drugs. The selected<br><br>
compounds were studied in three different cell lines that exhibit two different mechanisms of resistance; the overexpression of the P-glycoprotein and altered topoisomerase II activity.<br>
1) Human Uterine Sarcoma Tumor Cell Line Pair: MES-SA (Taxol Senffitive) and MES-SA/Dx5 (Taxol Resistant).<br>
[0409] This cell line expresses elevated mdr-1 mRNA and P-glycojirotein (an extrusion pump mechanism). Pretreatment with cyclosporin-A (CsA) blocks P-g^coprotein and reinstates activity in the resistant cell line for those compounds for which the resistance is due to elevated P-glycoprotein.<br>
[0410] As can be seen from Table 13, KPU-2, and KPU-35 haveij the same potency in the resistant cell line as in the sensitive line and the potency |&gt;f t-butyl-phenylahistin was only slightly reduced. Cyclosporin A (GsA) pretreatment did n|&gt;t alter the potency of the selected compounds. In contrast, taxol was virtually inactive in | the MES-SA/DX5 resistant cell line, whereas this compound was very potent in the sensitivfe cell line. CsA treatment restored the sensitivity to taxol of the MES-SA/DX5 cell line. iThe MES-SA/DX5 cell line also showed reduced susceptibility to etoposide (60 fold), doxoAibicin (34 fold) and mitoxantrone (20 fold).<br>
[0411] These data indicate that the effects of KPU-2, KPU-35 aifd t-butyl-phenylahistin are not susceptible to the taxol-related resistance mechanism (p-gWfcoprotein) in this cell line, and that cross-resistance from taxol does not occur to theae selected compounds in this model.<br>

2") Human jAcute Promyelocvtic Leukemia Cell Line Pair: HL-60 (Mitoxantrone-Sensitive') andHL-6Q|MX-2 flVfttoxantrone-Resistanf)<br>
[04|3] This cell line is considered to have atypical drug resistance properties with altered topoisomerase n catalytic activity without overexpression of P-glycoprotein.<br>
[0414] As can be seen in Table 14, these results indicate that the potencies of the selected nqfvel compounds are very similar in the sensitive and resistant HL-60 cell lines. In contrast, Mitoxantrone loses efficacy by a factor of 24-fold in the resistant HL-60/MX-2 cell line.<br>
[045] Thus, KPU-2, KPU-35 and t-butyl-phenylahistin are not susceptible to the same resistance mechanisms as Mitoxantrone in this cell line, and there is no cross-resistance from Mitoxantrone to these selected novel compounds in this model.<br><br>

[0416] This study involved KPU-2 in comparison to taxol. KPU-2 defnonstrated similar potencies in both the sensitive and resistant members of this cell line pair. Jn contrast, taxol was virtually inactive in the resistant cell line whereas there was low inane-molar potency in the sensitive cell line (Table 15).<br>
[0417] These studies confirm in a different human tumor cell line! that taxol<br>
resistance does not transfer to KPU-2.	'(<br>

C) Studies of the Mechanism of Action<br>
1). Action on Microtubule Function	-,<br>
[0418] Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HuVEC from Cam&amp;rex) were<br>
used in this study, for evaluating the effects of KPU-2 and t-butyl-phenyiahistin in<br>
comparison to colchicine and taxol on tubulin by staining for a-tubulin.	i<br>
[0419] Thirty minutes exposure to KPU-2, t-butyl-phenylahistin or colchicine (all at 2 uM) induced microtubule depolymerization as was indicated by the laclf: of intact microtubule structure in contrast to that observed in the DMSO Control and cell jimembrane blebbing (a clear indication of apoptosis) in the HuVEC cells, whereas taxol did toot induce<br><br>
microtubu|e depolymerization under these conditions. Colchicine is a known microtubule depolyme^zang agent whereas taxol is a tubulin stabilizing agent. Similar results were obtained ^hen CCD-27sk cells were exposed to KPU-2 or colchicine.<br>
2). Induction of Apoptosis<br>
[0420] Apoptosis and its dysregulation play an important role in oncology, the selective induction of the programmed cell death cycle in tumor cells is the goal of many chemotherftpeutic drug discovery programs. This induction of apoptosis can be demonstrated by different methods including the characteristic cell membrane blebbing, DNA fragmentaf on, hyperphosphorylation of the antiapoptotic factor Bcl-2, activation of the caspase cascade and cleavage of poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP).<br>
[0421] The characteristic signs of apoptotic cell death include cell membrane blebbing, fisrupttoh of nuclei, cell shrinkage and condensation and finally cell death, very distinctive! from necrotic cell death. KPU-2 induced the typical morphological changes associated! with early stages of apoptosis in human prostate tumor cells. A similar finding was also cjear in the treatment of HuVEC cells with KPU-2.<br>
3\ DNA<br>
[0422] A late stage characteristic of apoptosis is intemucleosomal DNA cleavage that result^ in a distinctive ladder pattern that can be visualized by gel electrophoresis. This approach ^as used to study the effect of KPU-2 on DNA laddering in Jurkat cells (human T cell leukemia line) in comparison to halimide and dehydrophenylahistin (KPU-1). KPU-2 induced DNA laddering at the 1 nM concentration whereas halimide and KPU-1 were much less potentl<br>
4). Activation of the Caspase Cascade<br>
[04J3] Several enzymes in the caspase cascade are activated during apoptosis, including jCaspase-3, -8 and-9. The activity of Caspase-3 was monitored in Jurkat cells following ^eatment with KPU-2, KPU-35 and t-butyl-phenylahistin.<br>
[04§24] The results indicate that caspase-3 was activated in a dose-dependent manner byftreatment with all three compounds in a manner similar to halimide. The caspase-<br><br>
3 activation occurred over a similar concentration range as for the ICSOs for cyt|&gt;toxicity in<br>
the Jurkat cell line (Table 16).	Table 16 Cvtotoxicitv of KPU-2. KPU-35 and t-butvl-pheavlahistni ia JurkaiCells<br><br>

5X Cleavage of PoMADP-ribose') Polvmerase (PARF) in Jurkat Cells<br>
[0425] In order to assess the ability of these compounds to induce apoptosis in Jurkat cells, cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) was monitored. JPARP is a 116 kDa nuclear protein that is one of the main intracellular targets of Caspafee-3. The<br>
cleavage of PARP generates a stable 89 kDa product, and this process cans be easily<br>
I<br>
monitored by western blotting. Cleavage of PARP by caspases is one of the hallmarks of<br>

apoptosis, and as such serves as an excellent marker for this process.   KPU-2 jit 100 nM<br>
induced cleavage of PARP in Jurkat cells 10 hours after exposure of the c^lls to the compound. KPU-2 appeared to be more active than either halimide or KPU-1.<br>
6). Enhanced Vascular Permeability in HuVEC Cells<br>
[0426] Compounds that depolymerize microtubules (e.g. combretasjtatin A-4-phosphate, ZD6126) have been shown to induce vascular collapse in tumors in fz'vo. This vascular collapse is preceded by a rapid induction of vascular cell permeability initially to electrolytes and soon after to large molecules. The enhanced permeability of HuV^C cells to a fluorescent-labeled dextran is used as a proxy assay for vascular collapse.<br>
[0427] KPU-2, KPU-35 and t-butyl-phenylahistin all rapidly (withi|i 1 hour)<br>
induced significant HuVEC monolayer permeability, to an extent similar to colch|cine. The<br>
microtubule stabilizing agent taxol was inactive in this assay (Figure 12).	j<br>
7). Profile in A Broad Kinase Screen	i<br>
[0428] KPU-2 was initially screened at a concentration of 10 pM in a p&amp;nel of 60 different kinases; the ATP concentration was 10 uM. Four kinases were inhibitedfby greater<br><br>
than 50%f in the primary screen and the ICSO's determined in secondary screening are presented sin Table 17. All of the IC50 values are in the low micromolar range, which indicates that inhibition of these kinases is not related to the low nanomolar activities observed lor tumor cell cytotoxicity.<br>

In vivo Pharmacology<br>
[0429] Preliminary studies with KPU-2 were performed using the MX-1 (breast) and HT-29 (colon) xenograft models and the P-388 murine leukemia tumor model, in the mouse. Other tumor models selected on the basis of activity in the in vitro tumor panel were the DU-1J&amp;5 (prostate), MCF-7 (breast), and the A549 (hrag) cell lines. The human pancreatic* tumor (MiaPaCa-2) was also included. The novel compounds were studied as monother^jpy and in combination with a clinically-used chemotherapeutic agent. The doses of the selected novel compounds were determined from the acute tolerability testing (Maximally Tolerated Dose, MTD) and were adjusted if necessary during each study. The doses of t|e clinically-used chemotherapeutic agents were selected on the basis of historical studies. '<br>
[O^SO] KPU-2 was the first compound to be studied in these five tumor models. Followingjj the initial results from this study, all three compounds were compared hi the HT-29 humani colon tumor, the DU-145 human prostate and the MCF-7 human breast tumor xenograft fnodels.<br>
{0431J The above models all use the subcutaneous xenograft implantation technique pnd are potentially subject to selective effects of a compound on the subcutaneous vasculaturje producing a magnified (or apparent) antirurnor activity. In order to circumvent mis possibility, two other tumor models have been incorporated in the research. One of these is the observation of lung metastases following the intravenous injection of B16-F10 mouse<br><br>
melanoma tumor cells. The other model is the implantation of MDA-231 huipan breast<br>
tumor cells in the mouse mammary fat pad. While this latter model is a xenograft |nodel, the<br>
subcutaneous vasculature does not play a role.

[0436] Animals were implanted subcutaneously (s.c.) by trocar with fragments of HT-29 tumors harvested from s.c. growing tumors in nude mice hosts. When the |umor size reached 5 mm x 5 mm (about 10-17 days) the animals were matched into treatment and control groups. Mice were weighed twice weekly and tumor measurements wer4 obtained using calipers twice weekly, starting on Day 1. The tumor measurements were converted to estimated mg tumor weight using the formula (W2xL)/2. When the estimated tunior weight of the control group reached an average of 1000 mg the mice were weighed, sacrificed and the tumor removed.

Results<br>
Studies in the HT-29 Human Colon Tumor Xenoeraft Model<br>
1. In Kivo| Evaluation of KPU-2 +/- CFT-11 in the HT-29 Human Colon Tumor Xenoeraft Model     i<br>
[0454] This study assessed changes in dosage strength and dosing regimen for KPU-2 al
[O^jSS] KPU-2 was administered at doses of 7.5 mg/kg ip daily for five days (qdx5), 3.f 5 mg/kg ip bid for five days, 7.5 mg/kg ip every second day for 10 days (qodxS) and 7.5 m$/kg ip every third day for 15 days (q3dx5). The combination of CTP-11 with NPI-2358 at a dose of 7.5 mg/kg ip q3dx5 resulted in a significantly greater effect than for either<br><br>
compound alone, which lasted for the duration of the study (Figure 13). These observations during the in-life portion of the study were confirmed.by the mean group final tumor weights at autopsy for which only the combination group exhibited a statistically significant lower tumor weight than controls. In addition the difference between the mean tumor weights of the combination therapy and CPT-11 monotherapy groups was statistically significant (Figure 14). When the individual final tumor weights at autopsy are examined the greater effect of cothetapy is clear (Figure 14). The TGI of cotherapy was 78% as compared toJ38.9% for CPT-11 alone. The TGI for the combined therapy group exceeds the NCI criterion of 58% for a positive result. 2. Study of KPU-2 +/- Standard Chemotherapy vs. Five Human Tumor XenoRraft yodels<br>
[0456] This study consists of five different arms, each with its ow^ protocol, timing, dosing regimen and reference compound. Each arm will be considered jwithin the presentation of the particular tumor model.<br>
[0457] The aim of the HT-29 arm of the study was to investigate a sligfitly higher dose of KPU-2 (10 mg/kg ip q3dx5) in the HT-29 human colon tumor xenograft model as compared to those used in the study described above, in which a marked synergy was observed between KPU-2 (7.5 mg/kg ip q3dx5) and CPT-11 (100 mg/kg ip qwx3).<br>
[0458] As can be observed in Figure 15, the combination of KPU-2 a|d CPT-11 in this model resulted in a marked synergy in the inhibition of tumor growth, with- the tumor growth being almost completely inhibited up to Treatment Day 29 in the combination therapy group. The combined therapy maintained efficacy and the estimated tumor grovWi for this group was significantly lower than for either monotherapy group. Accordingly, administration of KPU-2 and CPT-11 inhibited tumor growth and is an effective janti-tumor treatment.<br>
[0459] The observations of the in-life portion of the study (estimated tumor growth, Figure 15) are supported by measurement of the weights of the tumors jexcised at autopsy (Figure 16). The tumor weights for the combination group was significantly less than the Controls (p
[0460] When the individual final tumor weights are considered (F^g 16), the tumor size for the combination group was generally smaller than for the other treated or<br><br>
pontrol groups. The TGI of the combination group was 65.8%, indicating a positive effect by the NCI cr|terion, while monotherapy did not reach the NCI criterion of TGI &gt; 58%. 3. Study ffi activity of gPU-2. KPU-35 and t-butyl-phenvlahistin in the HT-29 Human Colon Tumor Xe|ograftaStqdv<br>
104J61] The results of this study are presented in Figure 17 and Table 18. The combination therapy groups all indicated a marked synergy between the novel compounds and CPT-|1. The individual tumor weights demonstrate the effectiveness of the cotherapy treatment ^Figure 18). In each case the TGI for the combination group surpasses the NCI criterion fifr a positive effect, whereas the TGI for CPT-11 monotherapy did not reach this level. ;<br><br>

[0 58% for a positive effect. The results generated in the three studies are very comparable for both the inUife observations (Figure 19) and for the weights of the tumors excised at autopsy (Figure 20).<br>
Studies in the DU-145 Human Prostate Tumor Xenograft Model (0463]       Two studies have been completed with this model: the first study involved KPU-2 alojjae and in combination with taxotere; the second study compared KPU-2, KPU-35 and t-butyl-phenytahistin alone and in combination with taxotere.<br>
1.	Effect 4f KPU-2 in Combination with Taxotere ui the DU-145 Human Prostate Tumor<br>
Xenograft Model<br>
[0464] As can be seen from the data obtained during the in-life portion of this study (Fig|21), tbe most effective treatment of the DU-145 human prostate tumor was the combined fherapy of KPU-2 plus taxotere. The treatment effect was most pronounced at the beginning jof the study and appeared to be reduced as the study progressed. From treatment Days 20 -27, the combination therapy did provide an apparent TGI that exceeded the NCI criterion (|TGI &gt; 58%), and the estimated tumor weight of the combined therapy was significant|y less than for either monotherapy.<br>
2.	Activit| of KfU-2. KPU-35 and t-butvl-phenvlahistin Alone or in Combination with<br>
Taxotere i| the DU-145 Human Prostate Xenograft Model<br>
[04(65] Based on the data obtained with KPU-2 in combination with taxotere in the Study\ described above a second study comparing KPU-2 to KPU-35 and t-butyl-phenylahistin alone and in combination with taxotere was initiated.<br>
[04166] The observations made during the in-life portion of this study indicate that the combination of either KPU-2 or KPU-35 with taxotere has a greater reduction on tumor growth th|n for taxotere alone (Figure 22). The tumor growth was almost completely blocked b)| KPU-35 in combination with taxotere.<br><br>
[0467] The excised tumor weights at autopsy confirmed the observations made during the in-life segment of the study. The combination of either KPU-2 (Figure 23) or KPU-35 (Figure 24) with taxotere was significantly more effective than taxote|e alone in blocking tumor growth , in the case of KPU-35, three often mice showed evidence| for tumor shrinkage. The tumor growth inhibition indices indicated a marked inhibition of tumor<br>
growth for KPU-2 (group mean = 74.1 %) and an almost total block for KPU-35 (droop mean<br>
i = 92.5%).  Taxotere alone did not reach the NCI established criterion for a pos|tive effect<br>
(TGA&gt; 58%).	I<br>
5.	Studies in the MCF-7 Human Breast Tumor Xenograft Model	»<br>
[0468] This study compared the effects of KPU-2, KPU-35 atfd t-butyl-phenylahistin in the MCF-7 human breast tumor xenograft model. The doges of the compounds were administered on Days 1,2, 3, 4, and 7; Taxotere was administered on Days 1,3 and 7.<br>
[0469] The selected novel compounds have early onset, statistically significant<br>
effects when used in combination with taxotere in this model, apparently almost Completely<br>
blocking estimated tumor growth (Figure 25). Of the three compounds, KPU-2 appeared to<br>
be the most effective, with t-butyl-phenylahistin also exhibiting a significant poteaitiation of<br>
taxotere.	*<br>
6.	Studies in the A549 Human Non Small Cell Lung Tumor Xeaograft Model       i<br>
[0470] The in-life observations during this study (Figure 26) indicated that the combination of KPU-2 (7.5 mg/kg ip, qdx5) with taxotere resulted in a marked inhibition of<br>
•(<br>
tumor growth as compared to the Control or either monotherapy group. This wasjjconfirmed<br>
by the autopsy tumor weights, as the mean of the cotherapy group was significant^ less than<br>
r<br>
that of taxotere alone or the Control group (Figure 27). The cotherapy group turnfor weights form a cluster of low tumor weights, indicating the consistency of the effect.         I<br>
[0471] When the tumor growth index is calculated, the cotherapy groupjhad a TGI of 74.4% as compared to the control group well in excess of the NCI criterion finf a positive effect (TGI &gt; 58%). Taxotere alone had a TGI of 26.1 %.<br><br>
7.	Studies |n the MDA-231 Human Breast Tumor Orthotopic Xcnoeraft Model<br>
[0472J This model involves the placement of the human tumor tissue into the mouse mammary fat pad, a surrogate of the natural environment. In this manner the possibility! of a Positive effect due to a specific action on the subcutaneous vascular bed- is avoided. (This study compared the effect of KPU-2 (7.5 mg/kg ip, q3dx5) alone and in combination with paclitaxel (16 mg/kg ip, qdx5).<br>
[0^73] Three weeks into the study there was a significant inhibition of tumor growth in the combination therapy group, a highly significant effect. This effect appeared to be more marked than for taxotere alone (Figure 28).<br>
8.	Studies in the Murine Melanoma B16 F10 Metastatic Tumor Model<br>
[0474] This study examined the effect of KPU-2, KPU-35 and t-butyl-phenylahisjtin alone and in combination with paclitaxel on the number of metastases appearing on the surface of the lung 16 days after the intravenous injection of B16 F10 melanoma! cells to the mouse. This model is not a xenograft model; however, it does not involve a ^igh degree of vascularization into the tumor mass.<br>
[0<f75j in this model the most effective treatment was kpu-2 alone having a ifean metastases count about less than that for paclitaxel of and respectively while study does not itself establish combination therapy is more monotherapy it indicate kpu-35 t-butyl-phenylahi are highly vascularized tumors.></f75j>
EXAMPLE 10 Assays For Activity Against Pathogenic Fungi<br>
[04J76J Comparative activity of a dehydrophenylahistin or its analog against a pathogenic fungus, relative to known antiftmgal compounds recited above, for use in determini% the dehydrophenylahistin or its analog's AF/IS value is measured directly against the fungall organism, e.g. by raicrotiter plate adaptation of the NCCLS broth macrodilution method described in Dtagn Micro and Infect Diseases 21:129-133 (1995). Antifungal activity cafn also be determined in whole-animal models of fungal infection. For instance, one may efnploy the steroid-treated mouse model of pulmonary mucormycosis (Goldaill, L.Z. &amp; Sugar, ^..M. 1994 J Antimicrob Chemother 33:369-372). By way of illustration, in such<br>
155<br><br>
studies, a number of animals are given no dehydrophenylahistin or its analog, various doses of dehydrophenylahistin or its analog (and/or combinations with one or more otheil antifungal<br>
F<br>
agents), or a positive control (e.g. Amphotericin B), respectively, beginning before, at the<br>
time of, or subsequent to infection with the fungus. Animals may be treated oncje every 24<br>
hours with the selected dose of dehydrophenylahistin or its analog, positive |;ontrol, or<br>
vehicle only. Treatment is continued for a predetermined number of days, e.g. up ^a ten days.<br>
Animals are observed for some time after the treatment period, e.g. for a total of th ree weeks,<br>
with mortality being assessed daily. Models can involve systemic, pulmonary, vaginal and<br>
other models of infection with or without other treatments (e.g. treatment witfe steroids)<br>
designed to mimic a human subject susceptible to infection.	1<br>
[0477] To further illustrate, one method for determining the in vivo fierapeutic<br>
efficacies (ED50, e.g. expressed in mg dehydrophenylahistin or its analog/kg subject), is a<br>
rodent model system. For example, a mouse is infected with, the fungal pathogen (such as by<br>
intravenous infection with approximately 10 times the 50% lethal dose of the pathogen (106<br>
C. albicans cells /mouse). Immediately after the fungal infection, dehydrophenylahistin<br>
compounds are given to the mouse at a predetermined dosed volume. The ED50 isjjcalculated<br>
by the method of Van der Waerden (Arch Exp Pathol Pharmakol 195:389-412, 1)940) from<br>
the survival rate recorded on 20th day post-infection. Generally, untreated control animals<br>
die 7 to 1 3 days post-infection.	I<br>
[0478] In another illustrative embodiment, C. albicans Wisconsin (C^S) and C. tropicalis (Cl 12), grown on Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) slants for 48 h at|28°C, are<br>
i<br>
suspended in saline and adjusted to 46% transmission.at 550 ran on a spectrophotometer. The inoculum is further adjusted by hemacytometer and confirmed by plate counts to be approximately 1 or 5 x 107 CFU/ml. CF-1 mice are infected by injection 1 or 5 £ 106 CPU into the tail vein. Antifungal agents are administered intravenously or subcuta|ieously in ethanolrwater (10:90), 4 h post infection and once daily thereafter for 3 or 4 ifiore days. Survival is monitored daily. The EDso can be defined as that dose which allowSs for 50% survival of mice.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 11<br>
i	Evaluating Antimicotic Activity<br>
[04J79] Benzimidazoles and griseoiulvin are anti-tubulin agents capable of binding to fungal jpicrotubules. Once bound, these compounds interfere with cell division and intracellul^r transport in sensitive organisms, resulting in cell death. Commercially, benzimidaloles are used as fungicidal agents in veterinary medicine and plant disease control. 4 wide variety of fungal species, including Botrytis cinerea, Beauveria bassiana, Helmintho^porium solani, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus are susceptible to these molecules.! Toxieity concerns and increasing drug resistance, however, have negatively impacted tfceir usage. Qriseofulvin is used clinically to treat ringworm infections of the skin, hair and |iails, caused by Trichophyton sp., Microsporum sp., and Epidermophyton floccosumj. Its antifungal spectrum, however, is restricted to this class of fungal organisms. Genotoxidfty is also a significant side effect. Terbinafine, while an alternative first-line treatment, Hs more costly. Further, clinical resistance recently has been observed in Trichopkyjpn rubrum (the major causative agent for all dermatophyte infections).<br>
[0480] In Candida albicans, microtubule/microfilament formation is affected where cell| are exposed to the microtubule inhibitors nocodazole and chloropropham. These results further validate the exploration of cytoskeleton inhibitors as effective antimycotic agents. Accordingly, several of the compounds disclosed herein were evaluated for antimycotii; activity.<br>
[0481] Specifically, disclosed compounds were evaluated alongside commercially available microtubulin inhibitors as well as recognized antifungal agents. The test compound| and controls used in this study: (-)-Phenylahistin, KPU-1, KPU-2, KPU-11 and KPU-17, |CPU-35, t-butyl phenylahistin, Colchicine (commercial microtubulin inhibitor tested versfis 3 Candida isolates), Benomyl (commercial microtubulin inhibitor tested versus 3 Candida isolates), Griseofulvin (commercial microtubulin inhibitor and antibiotic control for testing| versus 6 dermatophyte isolates), Amphotericin B (antibiotic control for testing versus 3 (§andida isolates), Itraconazole (antibiotic control for testing versus 2 Aspergillus isolates).<br><br>
[0482] Microorganisms against which these compounds were testecf included:<br>

Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Epidermophyton floccosum. With the exception <f f candida></f>
glabrata (one isolate), two isolates of each species were tested.	!<br>
[0483] Antirungal susceptibility testing was accomplished according to the methods outlined in the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards, M38-A "Reference Method for Broth Dilution Antirungal Susceptibility Testing of jConidium-Forming Filamentous Fungi; Approved Standard." This includes testing in RPMlJl640 with glutamine and without bicarbonate, an inoculum size of 0.4 - 5 x io4, and incubation at 30 or 35°C for 48 hours. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was defined asjjthe lowest concentration that resulted in an 80% reduction in turbidity as compared to £J drug-free control tube. Drug concentrations were 0.03-16 ug/ml for the investigational compounds, 0.015-8 fig/ml for itraconazole and griseofulvin.<br>
[0484] The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) at which a compound prevented the growth of the target microorganism was assessed according to th| modified version of the NCCLS protocol. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined<br>
I<br>
at the first 24-hour interval where growth could be determined in the drug-free control tube. The defined MIC was the lowest concentration that exhibited an 80% reduction fn turbidity as compared to the growth control. The minimum lethal concentration OflLC) was determined by plating 0.1 ul from the MIC concentration and each concentration above the<br>
MIC. The MLC was called at the first concentration that exhibited five or fewer colonies of<br>
j fungal growth representing a 99.95% kill. When a MIC was obtained, a minimum! fungicidal<br>
concentration (MFC) was determined to assess the fungistatic/fungicidal nature of the compound. This procedure entails diluting drug-treated cell samples (removed from test wells containing compound at and above the MIC) to compound concentrations significantly below the inhibitory concentration and depositing them on agar plates. The coinpound is scored as fungistatic if the cells are able to resume growth and fungicidal if no ijegrowth is possible because the compound had killed the organisms.<br><br>
[0485] Compounds disclosed herein were shown to be effective against two Trichopk$on species, T. rubrum is the principal causative agent for human dermatophytic infections  and would be the key organism to target in the development of a clinical agent.<br>
{0486] Compounds KPU-2, KPU-11 and KPU-17, KPU-35 &amp; t-butylpheniiahistiB were equivalent in potency or in some cases more potent than griseorulvin, a current, standard pharmaceutical agent used for treating dermatophytic infectionsjj<br>
[0487] Compounds (-)-Phenylahistin and KPU-1 were significantly less potent than the o|her compounds when tested versus T. rubrum and weaker but more comparable to the others j/ersus the sensitive T. mentagrophytes isolate.<br>
(0488] In those instances when an MFC could be determined, the results indicate that these pompounds are fungistatic in nature (see Tables 19 and 20).<br><br>

EXAMPLE 12<br>
Evaluating vascular targeting activity<br>
(0489] Tumors and neoplastic conditions can be treated using the Compounds disclosed herein. The occlusion of the blood supply in tumors with vascular targeting agents (VTAs) induces regression of the tumors. The compounds disclosed herein, inclupngNPU-02 and KPU-35, for example, can be as VTAs. Many VTAs exhibit their vasculaf effects by interacting at the colchicine-binding site on microtubules. This interaction f induces a characteristic, rapid collapse and occlusion of established vasculature in the tumor and therefore compromises the integrity of existing vessels leading to necrosis.<br>
[0490] Vascular collapse can occur, for example, within 30-60 |minutes of exposure to the VTA and involves changing the shape of the immature and proliferating, but<br>
1<br>
not the quiescent and mature, endothelial cells in the central portion of the tumor. This differential effect on vascular cells provides a rationale for the selective effects on the tumor due to the higher percentage of proliferating immature endothelial cells in the tumor blood vessels versus normal blood vessels. VTAs can be classified into three overlapping spectra<br>
'!<br>
of activity: (1) potent vascular and cytotoxic effects, (2) potent vascular with wea|c cytotoxic<br>
effects, and (3) potent cytotoxic with weak vascular effects.<br>
In Vivo Vascular Targeting Activity of KPU-02 and KPU-35	'[0491] Animal models are essential to investigate new therapies ijhat inhibit<br>
tumor-induced angiogenesis, target the established tumor vasculature, and inhibit tumor<br>
growth.	'
[0492] A murine syngeneic "pseudo-orthotopic" breast cancer model yas used to address these issues. Torres Filho et al., Microvascular Research (1995)49, 212-^26, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. To create the "pseudo-orthotojjjic milieu," the coverslip of a dorsal skinflap chamber was removed and small pieces of mamihary fatpad from donor mice were implanted into the chamber. On top of the fatpad graft, tumor spheroids containing N202 mammary tumor cells transduced with Histone (^2B)-green fluorescent protein (GFP) were applied. The use of H2B-QFP transduced cells} allows for visualizing tumor growth and monitoring mitosis and apoptosis.<br><br>
[0493J Fluorescence video microscopy allows for the relatively non-invasive study of tujmor microcirculation in conscious mice. This model can provide data regarding the effects jjof compounds on tumor vasculature, tumor growth, mitosis and apoptosis, and is useful to fxamine the activity of compounds either alone or in combination with other therapeutic^. Utilizing this model, KPU-02 and KPU-35 were shown to induce a rapid vascular c<fllapse leading to central necrosis and the regression of established tumors after a single i.v. administration.></fllapse>
[04f&gt;4] On day 12 of tumor growth, mice were treated i.v. with a 2-minute infusion of 5 mg/kg KPU-35, a 5 minute i.v. infusion of 10 mg/kg KPU-02, or bolus of vehicle (1|% solntol (w/w) + 2% DMSO in water). On day 13, 5-minute infusions of 10 mg/kg KPfM)2, KPU-35 or vehicle were administered. Treatments with KPU-02 or KPU-35 were well folerated. Mice were observed for two additional days. Tumor area, blood flow rate, and fascular density within and surrounding the tumor were visualized. Real-time observations were recorded at various time-points using still photos and video microscopy.<br>
[0495] This study demonstrates the rapid collapse of the central vasculature after the single |.v. treatment with either KPU-02 or KPU-35. The changes in vascular functions resulted ina significant central tumor necrosis, without an observed effect on the vasculature in the surrounding fat pad or skin (Figure 30). These observations support the selectivity and specificity|of KPU-02 and KPU-35, which both individually can disrupt established tumor vasculaturf. In Vivo Activity of KPU-02 in Human Tumor Xenogrqfts<br>
[0496] When KPU-02 was administered with CPT-11 (Mnotecan), Taxotere or Paclitaxel^ marked antitumor activity was seen in the human colon (HT-29), breast (MCF-7; MDA-MBJpl) and lung (A549) tumor xenograft models (Table 21). The effect of KPU-02 in the HT-J29 model was robust, reproducible in three studies, and showed a dose-dependent effect i.e.,|7.5 mg/kg was statistically greater than 2.5 mg/kg (Figures 32, 33). In vitro Activity of KPU-02 and KPU-35 in HuVEC cells<br>
[0^97] The above-described in vivo effects of KPU-02 and KPU-35 on tumor vasculaturp were supported by the in vitro effects of the same compounds in HuVEC cells. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells are considered a good in vitro model of tumor<br><br>
endothelium, which is considered "immature". Tumor endothelium lacks supporting vascular<br>
mural cells and is increasingly reliant on microtubule network for integrity off the tumor<br>
vasculature.    Therefore, disruption of the microtubule network tamos causep vascular<br>
collapse.<br>
KPU-02 induces rapid tubulin depolymerization in HuVEC cells.	<br>
[0498] Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HuVECs; Cambrex CC2519A) were maintained at subconfluent densities in EGM-2 (Cambrex) media. The |cells were cultured in an incubator at 37°C in 5% COa and 95% humidified air. For tubulin staining assays, HuVEC cells were seeded at a density of 3xl04 cells/ml in EGM-2 on tissue culture compatible coverslips (Fisher). The plates were returned to the incubator for 2 day*.<br>
[0499]      Stock (20 mM) solutions of the test compounds were prepare^ in 100%<br>
i DMSO. 400X concentrated dilutions of the compounds were prepared in 100% DilSO. 5 jil<br>
volumes of the dilutions were added to individual wells resulting in a final concentration of 200 nM. The final concentration of DMSO was 0.25% in all samples. The plates were returned to the incubator for 30 minutes. HuVEC cells were treated for 30 min with 200 nM KPU-02 or KPU-35.<br>
[0500] The cells were rinsed in dPBS before fixation in 10%(v/v) neutral buffered formalin for 10 minutes at room temperature. Following fixation, a-tubulin wasj visualized by indirect immunofluorescence. Specifically, the cells were permeabilized ini|0.2%(v/v) triton X-100/dPBS for 10 minutes. The cells were washed prior to transferring thelcoverslips to a humidified chamber, the coverslips were blocked for two hours in antibOdy buffer (2%(w/v) BSA/ 0.1%(v/v) Tween 20/ dPBS). The coverslips were incubated wijh 50 \i\ of 0.1 g/ml mouse a-tubulin (Molecular Probes) in antibody buffer for 1 hour before washing and incubation with 50 \d of 1 ng/ml goat anti-mouse FFTC (Jackson ImmuiioResearch Laboratories) for one hour in the dark. Finally, the cells were washed and treated with 2 ug/ml DAPI (Molecular Probes) for 10 minutes before rinsing in H2O and mounting with Vectashield (Vector Labs) mounting media. The cells were imaged using ja 60x oil<br>
immersion objective on an upright microscope (Olympus BX51). The images we|-e digitally<br>
i<br>
captured using a CCD camera and Magnafire 2.0 software (Olympus). Post image (processing was performed in Photoshop Elements 2.0 (Adobe) and in Microsoft Powerpoint.<br>

[05^1]       Figure 33 shows that KPU-02 and KPU-35 rapidly induce tubulin depolymer^ation in HuVEC cells. KPU-02 induces dose dependent monolayerpermeability in HuVEC cells.<br>
[05|2] Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HuVECs; Cambrex CC2519A) were maintained at subconfluent densities in EGM-2 (Cambrex) media. The cells were cultured njj an incubator at 37°C in 5% COa and 95% humidified air. For monolayer permeability assays, HuVEC cells were seeded at IxlO5 cells/ ml in EGM-2 media on FibronectinUoated 3.0 pm Fluoroblok inserts (Becton Dickinson) in 24-well plates. The plates were| returned to the incubator for 4 days to allow the cells to reach confluency.<br>
[0503] Stock solutions (20 mM) of the test compounds were prepared in 100% DMSO. l(fX concentrated serial dilutions of the compounds were prepared in EGM-2. 10 n\ volumes of the serial dilations were added to the test inserts in duplicate resulting in final concentrations ranging from 2 (JM to 2 nM. The final concentration of DMSO was 0.25% in<br>
!i<br>
all sampled The cells were treated with 2 nM-2 |jM KPU-02 for 15 minutes.<br>
[OSJJM] FrrC-Dextran (50 mg/ml) in dPBS (38.2 kDa; Sigma) was diluted 2.5 fold in EGM-2| 10 (jl of FTTC-Dextran was added to each insert. The final concentration of FrrC-Dex^n was 1 mg/ml. The plates were returned to the incubator and 30 minutes later the fluorescence of the lower chambers of the 24 well plates was read using a Fusion fluorimeteij (Packard Bioscience) with Xex = 485 run and Xem = 530 nm filters.<br>
fO^)51 Figure 34 shows that KPU-02 is able to induce monolayer permeability in a dose dependent manner. The results shown in Figure 34 represent the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments.<br>
Blood Flcfy in the P22 Rat Sarcoma Model with I2SI-IAP<br>
[05JD6] Tumor blood flow was assessed in a model using a quantitative 125I-iodoantipyjine (IAP) technique in rats bearing a P22 rat sarcoma. KPU-02 (15 rag/kg, IP) markedly ^nd selectively reduced tumor blood flow to 23% of vehicle at 1 hour after administration; blood flow remained markedly reduced 24 hours later (59% vehicle). In contrast, b|ood flow in non-tumor tissues was affected to a much lesser extent at 1 hour (see Figure 35)j<br><br>
[0507] The reduction in blood flow at 24 hours post-dose was mojfe variable<br>
between tissues for KPU-02 compared to vehicle, as shown in Figure 36. The bl<jk>d flow to<br>
the tumor was the most affected, other tissues exhibited a small.reduction in tflood flow,<br>
skeletal muscle blood flow appeared to be increased at 24 hours post-dose.	]<br>
[0508] The effects of KPU-02 observed at 1 hour appear to be longer lasting and<br>
more selective for tumor blood flow than that previously reported for CA4P usinjjg the same<br>
technique.	I<br>
[0509] In an experiment with the P22 rat sarcoma model, it was demonstrated that KPU-02 7.5 and 15 mg/kg IP (n=2 per dose) produced a dose-dependent tumor necjrosis by 24 hours post-dose, with the highest dose resulting in an almost total necrosis of thjje tumor as shown in Figure 37. All tumors in the KPU-02-treated rats showed evidence 4f necrosis, whereas tumors in vehicle-treated rats did not. The VTAs that have entered int^ the clinic (e.g., CA4P, ZD6126, AVE8062) show similar qualitative effects on tumor blood using the IAP methodology (or similar technology) to demonstrate reduced blood flow in |he P22 rat sarcoma tumor and in humans using the dce-MRI technique.

Combination Therapy wim Microtabule Targeting Agents	j<br>
[0510] The findings that VTAs selectively damage the vasculature infthe central part of the tumor versus the periphery, which recovers functionality, support psing these agents in combination with chemotherapeutics (Taxol, Vinblastine and Cisplatirf), radiation and angiogenesis inhibitors directed against VEGF and EGF. The new |VTAs will<br><br>
supplemen^ rather than supplant these therapies and should provide for greater autitumor<br>
activities, i<br>
Treatment frf other conditions<br>
[OS|l) In addition to cancer, other diseases may be treated using the VTAs disclosed hjerein. Conditions include other neoplasms, retinopathies, and any other condition or disease |hat reMes upon blood supply, preferably blood supply from new vasculature in order to rerfiain viable and/or proliferate.<br>
[05|2] Many conditions are associated with excessive or inappropriate vasculaturd Examples of conditions associated with excessive vasculature include inflammatory disorders such as immune and non-immune inflammation, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic articular rheumatism and psoriasis; disorders associated with inappropriate or inopportune invasion of vessels such as diabetic retinopathy, neovascular glaucoma, retinopathy of prematurity, macular degeneration, cornea! graft rejection, retrolental fibroplasia| rubeosis, capillary proliferation in atherosclerotic plaques and osteoporosis; and cancer associated disorders, including for example, solid tumors, tumor metastases, blood bom tumops such as leukemias, angiofibromas, Kaposi .sarcoma, benign tumors such as hemangiomas, acoustic neuromas, neurofibromas, trachomas, and pyogenic granulomas, as well as ot|er cancers which require vascularization to support tumor growth. Additional examples ff vasculature-dependent diseases include, for example, Osier-Webber Syndrome; myocardial angiogenesis; plaque neovascularization; telangiectasia; hemophiliac joints and wound granulation. Furthermore, excessive vasculature is also associated with clinical problems Is part of biological and mechanical'implants (tissue/organ implants, stents, etc.). The instant compounds and compositions can be used to target vasculature, in preferably to preferentially target disease vasculature over non disease tissue vasculature, and thus the compound)^ and compositions can be used in the treatment of such conditions.

EXAMPLE 13<br>
Structure-Activitv Relationship<br>
[0515] The effect of activity from various modifications on the pheiyl ring of<br>
tBu-dehydroPLH is illustrated by the data in Figure 38. It is apparent that substitution with<br>
relatively hydrophobic and smaller functional groups at the m- or o- position irfcreased or<br>
maintained the cytotoxic activity at HT-29 cells while substitutions at the j|- position<br>
decreased activity. While not being bound to any particular theory, this data Suggests a<br>
rigorous recognition of the phenyl ring by tubulin.	[0516] 3D-QSAR (CoMFA) analysis (see Figure 39) also supports th| existence of sterically favorable fields at m- and o- positions and sterically unfavorable fields exist at the p- position. X-ray crystal analysis (see Figure 40) indicates that the conformation of potent derivatives require a certain amount of dihedral angle between the phenyl rjjng and the pseudo-tricyclic cor template formed by DKP and imidazole rings. Thus, modification with the appropriate conformational restriction of the phenyl ring may elicit potent actrvjity. While not being bound to any particular theory, it may be that the binding mode of PLH perivatives at the chochicine binding site of tubulin is different from mat of colchicines and; its known homologues.<br>

In Vitro Action on Microtubules Purification of Microtubule Protein and Tubulin<br>
[0517] Microtubule protein (MTP) was prepared as previously described (Farrell KW and Wilson L. (1987) Tubulin-colchicine complexes differentially poisofi opposite microtubule ends. Biochemistry 23(16):3741-8, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). MTP preparations consisting of 70% tubuiin and 30% microtubulej-associated proteins (MAPs) were isolated from bovine brain by three cycles of warm polymerization and cold deporymerization in PEM100 (100 mM 1-4 piperazinediethansulfonic acidi (Pipes), 1 mM MgSO4) 1 mM EGTA, pH 6.8) and 1 mM GTP. MTP was drop-froze|i in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70°C until use. Tubulin was purified from microtubule|protein by phosphocellulose chromatography (PC-rubulin) and stored in PEM50 (50 mM P^jes, 1 mM<br><br>
MgSO4, 1 fnM EGTA, pH 6.8). Protein concentration was determined by a Bradford assay (Sigma Chjpmicals, St. Louis, MO) using bovine serum albumin as the standard (Bradford, 1976).<br>
Test Agents<br>
[0518] Stock solutions of KPU-02 were prepared at a concentration of 20 mM in DMSO. s|tock solutions of Combretastatin A4 (National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD) (CA4) wasj prepared at a concentration of 5 mM in DMSO. Colchicine (Sigma Chemicals, St. Louis, Jv4O) (CLC) was prepared at a concentration of 3 mM in water. All agents were shielded t^am ambient light with amber Eppendorf tubes.

Determination of Steady-State Microtnbule Polymer Mass<br>
[050) MTP (2 rag/ml) was polymerized into microtubules in the presence of a range of flrug concentrations in PEM100 containing 1 mM GTP and a final DMSO concentration of 0.5%. Samples were monitored by light scattering at 350 nm at 37°C for 75 minutes.<br>
[0520] Polymerization reactions were centrifuged and the microtubule protein concentrations in the supernatant, a measure of the soluble tubulin at steady state, and the<br>
ij<br>
pellet, a measure of the microtubule polymer, were used to calculate the inhibition of polymerization. After incubation, polymerized microtubules were separated and sedimented from unp^lymerized MTP by centrifugation (150,000 x g, 45 minutes, 37°C). The supernatant was removed, and the microtubule pellets were depolymerized in deionized HjO (24 hours, jp°C) before protein determination by the Bradford assay.<br>
i;<br>
[0521] The percent inhibition was calculated in two ways and the values obtained from the tjivo ways were compared. In one way, a ratio of the microtubule protein in the pellet, drug to no drug, was calculated. Another ratio of microtubule protein in the pellet to the supernatant, drug to no drug, was also calculated. The numbers wete in close agreement and the feigner values were used because they were subject to less variance and experimental perturbation.<br>

Microtubule Mean Length Distributions<br>
[0522] Transmission electron microscopy was used to determine the nteair lerigth distribution of microtubules in the absence or presence of tested agent. At 75 njjmutes and prior to sedimentation, 10 ul aliquots from the polymer mass experiments werjb fixed by dilution into 290 ul PEMlOO-buffered 0.2% glutaraldehyde. Thirty microliteifs of fixed sample was settled onto formvar-coated 150 ICG mesh electron microscope g$ds for 90 seconds. Excess sample was wicked off with Whatman filter paper. Thirty mi|roliters of cytochrome C (1 nag/ml) was applied for 30 seconds to enhance protofilament resolution and facilitate negative staining. Uranyl acetate (1.5%) was applied for 20 seconds andjthe excess was wicked off. Grids were viewed in a Jeol electron microscope-1200 EX11 at |OOOX and 30,OOOX magnification. The Zeiss MOPffl was used to determine microtubiile length distributions and mean lengths for at least 100 microtubules per sample.<br>
CLC Competition Assays<br>
[0523] PC-tubulin (0.2 mg/ml) was incubated in PEM50 with 1 mMf GTP, 1% DMSO, 10 uM of tested agent and 7-25 uM [3H] CLC for 120 minutesj at 37°C. Measurement of [3H] CLC binding was followed by DEAE-cellulose filter-binding assay as described previously (Wilson, 1970). This method depends on the adsorption oi| tubulin to filter paper impregnated with DEAE-cellulose. Whatman DE81 filter paper was pife-wet with PEM50 prior to sample application. The total 100 ul reaction volume was applied^ to 2.5 cm disks of filter paper, over parafilm, on ice. The paper disks were washed by imfnersion in five successive 50 ml changes of PEM50, 5 mm/wash, 4°C, to remove alf unbound<br>

colchicine.   The paper disks with adhering tubulin-bound colchicine were thqjn counted directly in a scintillation vial containing 2 ml of Beckman Coulter Ready Protein solution<br>
(Fullerton, CA). All of the disks were washed together. Negligible binding of unbound CLC<br>

[0524] The K; values were calculated by linear regression of a doublet reciprocal plot of the experimental data in Microsoft Excel. The Km value of tubulin for CL(| under the experimental conditions was first determined, with x intercept equal to -I/Km. £4 BpP, Km in<br><br>

[OS26] The bis-ANS fluorophore probes the hydrophobic surface of proteins and a change in Intensity of the bis-ANS fluorescence signal is a result of a change in the solvent accessible (surface area of a protein. If there is some conformational change that changes the tubulin-bis|-ANS interaction upon ligand binding, then bis-ANS can be used to report binding.<br>
[05f27] PC-tubulin (0.2 mg/ml) was incubated with 0 - 30 nM KPU-02 at 25°C for 20 miijutes. Bis-ANS (25 uM) was then added and relative fluorescence intensities of samples wfare measured at 25°C within 15 minutes. Buffer blank spectra were collected and showed tl|at KPU-02 plus bis-ANS produced negligible fluorescence in the experimental wavelengt^ range.<br>
[0528] The Ka was determined by fitting experimental data in Sigmaplot and Microsoft j Excel using the equation F = ((-Fmax x L)/(Ka 4- L)) + FO where F is the fluorescence intensity of bis-ANS-tubulin in the presence of total ligand concentration L, Fmax is the biljj-ANS fluorescence intensity of fully liganded tubulin, and FO is bis-ANS fluorescence in the absence of drag. Fmax was determined by plotting l/(Fo-F) versus 1/L and extrapolating to 1/L = 0. The fraction of binding sites- B occupied by KPU-02 was determined using the following relationship: B = (Fo-F)/(Fo-Fmax). The concentration of tree ligand wa| determined with Lfree = L - B[C] in which [C] is the molar concentration of ligand-binflmg sites, assuming a single binding site per tubulin dimer.<br><br>
Inhibition of microtubule polymerization by KPU-02<br>
[0529J      KPU-02, CA4, and CLC were assayed for their ability tof alter the<br>

the presence of MAPs that copurify with tubulin. Although microtubule polymer in the<br>

[05JJ51] As shown in Figure 44, all three of the tested agents produced a concentration dependent inhibition of the extent of microtubule polymerization from 1.25-5 uM. Therijs are two important differences to note among the spectra. First, the initial rate of increase ii| absorbance over time decreases with increasing drug concentration (Figure 44A and 44B). 1 The spectra indicate that there is a lag period for MT formation in the presence of KPU-02 gbd CA4.

concentra^ons (above 5 uM), as shown by the absorbance values that increase linearly with time (Figi^e 44A and 44B). In contrast, MTP in the presence of CLC reaches steady state at high drug (Concentrations (Figure 44C).<br>
[0532] The amount of drug required to inhibit polymerization by 50% (ICso) was determine*! from the analysis of the linear relationship between the decrease in microtubule polymer sjpdimented by centrifugation with the increase in drug concentration (Figure 45). The errorj bars in Figure 45 represent standard deviation values from at least three independent experiments.<br>
Decrease |n mean microtubule length measured by transmission electron microscopy<br>
[0|33] Transmission electron microscopy was performed on agent-microtubule polymerization reactions to describe the polymer formed at steady state and to evaluate conclusions drawn from the light scattering spectra. KPU-02, CA4, and CLC all decreased<br><br>
the lengths of the miciotubules formed at steady state. MTs were progressively siorter with<br>

[0535] KPU-02 and CA4 were comparably potent in decreasing the aierage MT length. At 1.25 uM, the lowest drug concentration analyzed by electron mieroscopjk KPU-02 and CA4 decreased mean MT length by approximately 70%, and CLC by 40% (Figbre 48).<br>

Competitive Inhibition of CLC Binding<br>
[0338] KPU-02 and CA4 competitively inhibited CLC binding to tubulin (Figure 50). Figure 50 depicts the results of an inhibition assay where phosphocellulose-purified tubulin (0|2 mg/ml) was incubated with various concentrations of [3H]CLC in the absence (0), or presence of 10 uM KPU-02 (o) or 10 uM CA4 (a). Tubulin-CLC Km was 11 ± 4.4 uM and inhibition constants for KPU-02 and CA4 were 3.2 ± 1.7 uM and 2.4 ± 0.3 uM, respective|y. Constants were calculated from three independent experiments. The colchicinej-tubulin binding reaction is time and temperature dependent and the binding dissociation constant is Kj = 0.1-1 uM, depending on the conditions of the assay (Wilson L and Meza I. (1973) The mechanism of action of colchicine. Colchicine binding properties of<br><br>
sea urchin sperm tail outer doublet tubulin. Journal of Cell Biology 58(3):709-1^, which is<br>
] incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Under Hie test conditions, the Kn| of tubulin<br>
for CLC is 11 ± 4.4 uM. The Km may be considered the overall Kd of tubulin for CLC, however, due to the time-dependence of CLC binding, the Km is greater than tife reported values for the Kd. The Kj for KPU-02 and CA4 was 3.2 ± 1.7 uM and 2.4 jjb 0.3 uM, respectively. The K, is defined as the amount of drug required to inhibit CLC pinding by 50% and it is based on the amount of radioactive CLC bound to tubulin. The Ks isja measure of the drugs' ability to compete with CLC; it is not a direct measurement of d|ug-tubulin binding dissociation because of the method in which binding affinity is reported.<br>
Results	,<br>
At all concentrations of CLC assayed, MAP-rich tubulin reached steadj| state. In contrast, at higher KPU-02 or CA4 drug concentrations, MAP-rich tubuli^ did not<br>
polymerize to steady state and microtubules were not observed by electron microscopy. KPU-02 and CA4 effectively decreased the concentration of available tubulin. Th|s decrease in the pool of soluble tubulin increased the MT critical concentration and \ prevented polymerization. The stoichiometric amounts of KPU-02 and CA4 required to decrease in vitro polymer mass coupled with the data that microtubule protein did not reach steady state above those concentrations, suggesting that KPU-02 and CA4 act by a sequestering mechanism in which soluble tubulin is bound and prevented from polymerization.<br>
Observations by electron microscopy on the steady state, MAP-rich microtubules formed in the presence of the tested agents were consistent with the proposed mechanism that KPU-02 and CA4 sequester tubulin. There was a concentration-dependent decrease in the average microtubule length in the presence of KPU-02, CA4, and CLC. In the j|resence of KPU-02 and CA4, there was a drug concentration dependent decrease in the initial rate of polymerization, indicating that these drugs reduce the tubulin available for elongation. This decrease in the initial polymerization rate was not seen with CLC due to its slow Association with tubulin. Furthermore, microtubules were formed at CLC concentrations over its ICso for polymerization, but microtubules were not formed at KPU-02 or CA4 concentrations over their ICso for polymerization. While not being bound by any particular tfieory, the<br>
re*<br><br>
concentration of soluble tubulin bound by KPU-02 or CA4 must be under the critical concentration required for tubulin polymerization to proceed.<br>
[OS^9] Binding studies indicated that tubulin has a lower affinity for KPU-02 than it has for (|LC. Inhibition of CLC binding to tubulin by KPU-02 and CA4 occurred within a 20-minute (incubation period, indicating that KPU-02 and CA4 association with tubulin approached equilibrium relatively faster than for CLC (data not shown). KPU-02 competitively inhtrited CLC binding to tubulin at a site overlapping with the CLC-binding site, consiltent with studies characterizing phenylahistin (halunide) (Kanoh K, Kohno S, Kataka LJTakahashi J and Uno I. (1999) (-)-Phenylahistin arrests cells hi mitosis by inhibiting ijtubulin polymerization. The Journal of Antibiotics 52(2): 134-141, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). CA4, a structural analog of CLC, also competitivfsly inhibited CLC binding. Without being bound to any particular theory, it appears th|rt despite sharing a tubulin binding region with CLC, KPU-02 and CA4 interact with tubul|n and inhibit microtubules by a mechanism distinct from that of CLC.<br>

The stage was enclosed in a Pyrex bo|t and maintained at 36 ± 1°C by a forced air heating system. Thirty images of each cell T$ete acquired at 4-s intervals using a Photometries CoolSNAP HQ digital camera (Tucson, 4?) driven by Metamorph software (Universal Imaging, Media, PA) at 10 MHz, with a 300 bis exposure time, a gain of 2, and 2x2 binning to enhance brightness.<br>
Analysis of microtubule dynamics<br>
[05ft5] The positions of the plus ends of microtubules over time were tracked using the j^etamerph Track Points application exported to Microsoft Excel and analyzed using Rea| Time Measurement software. The lengths of individual microtubules were graphed asj a function of time. Individual growth and shortening rates were determined by linear regression. Changes of &gt; 0.5 utn between two points were considered to be growth or shortening! events, and changes of 
[0546] The time-based catastrophe frequency for each microtubule was calculated by dividing the number of catastrophes per microtubule by the time spent in growth or attenuation. The time-based rescue frequency per microtubule was calculated by dividing the total number of rescues per microtubule by the time spent shortening. The distance-based catastrophf and rescue frequencies were calculated similarly by dividing the number of transitionsfby the length grown or shortened, respectively. Microtubules that were visible for

[05JJI8] Most MT-targeting agents block mitosis at the metaphase to anaphase transition, f Mitotic block at the metaphase to anaphase transition is associated with suppressioi of MT dynamics. Without being bound to any particular theory, the earlier prometaphfse block, together with the depletion of MT polymer, suggests a distinct mechanism* of action for KPU-02 as compared with other MT depolymerizing drugs, e.g., vinblastinej which at low concentrations stabilize MT dynamics.<br>
Depolymetization of the mitotic spindle and the interphase array MTs<br>
[0549] KPU-02, CA4, and CLC were observed to be potent microtubule depolymer|zers in MCF7 cells. Although mitotic spindle microtubules are more susceptible to depolynferization and/or inhibition of polymerization than interphase array microtubules, both mic|otubule populations were affected (Figure 52). Figure 52 depicts immunofluorescence microscopy images of MCF7 cells. Interphase arrays are relatively more stab$ to depolymerization by KPU-02, CA4 and CLC than mitotic spindles. Cells were prepared and seeded as for mitotic progression and treated with the mitotic block ICso for each dfug for 20 hours.

KPU-02, 75% of the mitotic cells contained asters or foci of tubulin, and the remaining cells<br>
had no detectable mitotic polymer. In the presence of CLC, half of the cells wjere bipolar<br>
with uncongressed chromosomes and the remaining half were monopolar. At concentrations<br>
of twice the ICso for mitotic block, there was little detectable MT polymer in ntitotic cells<br>
treated with KPU-02, CA4, or CLC.	j<br>
[0551]       Microtubule interphase arrays were more resistant to depol] merization<br><br>
than mitotic spindles for all of the compounds examined (Figure 52). However, a<br><br>
qualitative<br><br>
decrease in polymer was observed in a dose-dependent manner for all three i ompounds<br>
(Figure 54 A-C). Figure 54A-C depicts immunofluorescence microscopy images of MCF7<br>
!<br>
cells treated with KPU-02 (a), CA4 (b), and CLC (c) for 20 hours.    Interphase MT<br>

Presumably, tubulin is sequestered in these interphase cells, despite the presence of<br>
! intracellular stabilizing MAPs, just as MAP-rich tubulin is sequestered in in vzflto polymer<br>

mass assays.	,<br>
Lack of suppression or modulation of MT dynamic instability in living MCFTJcells<br>
[0552] KPU-02, as well as CA4, did not have a measurable effect on Mtr dynamic instability at concentrations effecting 25% (Table 24) or 50% (Table 25) of fhj» maximal mitotic block in MCF7 cells. Without being bound by any particular theory, Jthese data suggest that the antiproliferative mechanism of action of KPU-02 (and CA4) is primarily due to inhibition of MT polymerization, rather than suppression of microtubule dynamics.<br><br>
