THE PATENTS ACT 1970 [39 OF 1970]<br>
&amp;<br>
THE PATENTS RULES, 2003 COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"BENZENE DERIVATIVES AND PROCESS FOR PREPARATION THEREOF"<br>
SANOFI-SYNTHELABO, of 174, Avenue de France, F-75013 Paris, France,<br>
The  following   specification  particularly   describes  the   invention   and   the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br><br><br><br>
The present invention relates to benzene derivatives comprising an amine function substituted with an alkyl group and a cycloalkyl group, which binds specifically. to the sigma receptors, in particular to those of the peripheral nervous system, to a process for preparing these compounds and to their use in pharmaceutical compositions "and more particularly 'as immunosuppressants.<br>
The sigma receptors have been revealed with the aid of several ligands. Firstly, mention may be made of opiate compounds, 6,7-benzomorphans or SKF-10,047, more particularly the chiral compound (+) SKF-10,047 (W. R. Martin et al.,   J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1976,197, 517-532 ; B. R. Martin et al. , J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1984, 231,   539-544). Among these compounds, the ones most commonly used are ( + ) JV-allylnormetazocin or ( + ) NANM and (+) pentazocin. A neuroleptic agent, haloperidol, is also a sigma receptor ligand, as are (+) 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-1-propylpiperidine and ( + } 3-PPP'"(B. L. Largent et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 1984, 81,   4983-4987).<br>
US patent 4 7 09 094 describes guanidine derivatives that are highly active as ligands that are specific for<br>
the sigma receptors, and mention may be made more<br><br><br>
particularly of di-(O-tolyl)guanidine, or DTG. The anatomic distribution of the sigma receptors in the brain has been studied by autoradiography, after labelling these receptors with DTG according to E. Weber et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 1986, 83,   8784-8788, as well as with the ligands (+) SKF-10,047 and (+) 3-PPP according to B. L. Largent et al.,   J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. USA 1986, 238,   739-748. The autoradiography study made it possible to identify the sigma receptors of the brain clearly and to distinguish them from the other opiate receptors, as well as from the phencyclidine receptors. The sigma receptors are particularly abundant in the central nervous-system and are concentrated in the cerebral trunk, the limbic system and the regions involved in regulating the emotions. Sigma receptors are also found in various peripheral tissues. At least two types of sigma receptor are distinguished: the sigma-1 receptors and the sigma-2 receptors. Ligands of the (+) SKF-10,047 type bind selectively to the sigma-1 receptors, while other ligands such as DTG, haloperidol or (+) 3-PPP show great affinity for both the sigma-1 and sigma-2 receptors. Patent EP 461 986 describes compounds of formula:<br><br><br><br><br>
which bind selectively to the sigma receptors and which have immunosuppressant activity.<br>
Among this series of compounds, (Z)-[3-(3-chloro-4-cyclohexylphenyl)allyl]eyelohexylethylamine hydrochloride, of formula:<br><br><br>
CH—CH3<br>
,HCI<br><br>
has been studied in particular. Reference may be made, for example, to Biological Chemistry 1997, 272   (43), 0  27107-27115; Immunopharmacology and Immunotoxicology 1996, 18   (2), 179-191. However, the compounds of formula (A) have a specific property which may be considered as a drawback. This is a property which appears during metabolization: the dependency on the 5  cytochrome known as CYP 2D6.<br>
In 1957, it was envisaged for the first time that hereditary differences might be responsible for variations in response to medicinal products. Oxidative metabolism shows large variations between 2fc)  individuals and races. The research carried out in the<br><br><br>
last 15 years has shown that the variations in the functional expression of the multigenic cytochrome P450 (CYP) family is the cause of these differences. Only a few isoforms of cytochrome P450 among those already characterized in man have a role in the oxidative metabolism of medicinal products. Reference may be made to Xenobiotica, 1986, 16,   367-378. Until now, CYP 1A2, CYP 2A6, CYP 2C9, CYP 2D6, CYP 2C19, CYP 2E1 and CYP 3A4 have been identified on the basis of their clinical importance. Currently, it is estimated that. CYP 3A4, CYP 2D6 and CYP 2C9 are responsible by themselves (and to variable degrees) for 90% of the oxidative metabolism of medicinal products. Although the functional expression of these isoforms is regulated and influenced by a good number of environmental and physiological factors, the genetic factors have the most pronounced influence, which underlines the important role played by polymorphism in the oxidation of medicinal products. A certain number of these polymorphisms have been studied (particularly those of CYP 2C19 and CYP 2D6). More particularly, the clinical importance of the polymorphism of CYP 2D6 in the 4-hydroxylation of debrisoquine has been demonstrated (Clin. Pharmacol.' Ther. 1991, 50,   233-238). The genetic polymorphism of CYP 2D6 is responsible for the problematic metabolism of more than 3 0 important<br><br><br>
medicinal products and affects up to 10% of the Caucasian population (slow metabolizers). It has now been shown that this isoform controls the biotransformation of medicinal products such as antiarrythmic agents, (3-blockers, anti-hypertensive agents, antiangina agents, neuroleptic agents and antidepressants. With a few exceptions, these medicinal products are used in psychiatric and cardiovascular medicine for long-term treatment.<br>
The pharmacokinetic consequences are especially of quantitative order: slow-metabolizing individuals have a 'level of unchanged product which is higher than the others. These quantitative differences have a considerable clinical impact for molecules which have a small therapeutic index.<br>
Genetics thus greatly influences the differences in efficacy and in side effects observed between individuals. Thus, it is important to determine whether or not the metabolism of a medicinal product can be modified in the case of genetic deficiency of an enzyme.<br>
Novel fine benzene derivatives for the sigma receptors, in particular those of the peripheral nervous system, have now been found according to the present invention, which have immunosuppressant activity but a low rate of<br><br><br><br>
metabolization and/or little or no involvement of CYP<br>
2D6 in the oxidative process.<br>
The compounds according to the invention also have<br>
antitumour, activity, and in particular they inhibit the<br>
proliferation of cancer cells.<br>
Moreover, these novel compounds have been shown to have<br>
activity in the cardiovascular field, more particularly<br>
in controlling the heart rate.<br>
The compounds according to the invention also have<br>
activity on apoptosis.<br>

hydrates thereof.<br>
The salts of the compounds according to the invention<br>
are prepared according to techniques that are well<br>
known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The salts of the compounds of formula (I) according to<br>
the present invention comprise those with inorganic or<br>
organic acids which allow a separation or a suitable<br>
crystallization of the compounds of formula (I), as<br>
well as of the pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>
Suitable acids which may be mentioned are: picric acid,<br>
oxalic acid or an optically active acid, for example a<br>
tartaric acid, a dibenzoyltartaric acid, a mandelic<br>
acid or a camphorsulphonic acid, and those which form<br>
physiologically acceptable salts, such as the<br>
hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulphate, hydrogen<br><br><br>
sulphate, dihydrogen phosphate, maleate, fumarate, 2-naphthalenesulphonate or para-toluenesulphonate. The hydrochlorides are most particularly preferred among the salts of the compounds of formula (I).    When a compound according to the invention contains one or more asymmetric carbons, the optical isomers of this compound form an integral part of the invention. When a compound according to the invention presents a stereoisomerism, for example of axial-equatorial type   or Z-E type, the invention comprises all the stereoisomers of this compound.<br>
The present invention comprises the compounds of formulas (I) in the form of pure isomers, but also in the form of a mixture of isomers in any proportion. The compounds (I) are isolated in the form of pure isomers by the conventional separation techniques: use may be made, for example, of fractional recrystallizations of a salt of the racemic mixture with an optically active acid or base, the principle of which is well known, or conventional chromatography techniques on a chiral phase or a non-chiral phase; for example, use may be made of separation on silica gel or Cis-grafted silica gel, eluting with mixtures such as chlorinated solvents/alcohol. The above compounds of formula (I) also comprise those in which one or more hydrogen, carbon or halogen atoms, in particular chlorine or<br><br><br><br>
fluorine atoms, have been replaced with their radioactive isotope, for example tritium or carbon-14. Such labelled compounds are useful in research studies, of metabolism or pharmacokinetics, in biochemical tests as receptor ligands.<br>
The functional groups which may be present in the molecule of the compounds of formula (I) and in the reaction intermediates can be protected, either in permanent form or in temporary form, with protecting groups which ensure an unequivocal synthesis of the expected compounds. The protection and deprotection reactions are carried out according to techniques that are well known to those skilled in the art. The expression "temporary protecting group for amines, alcohols, phenolthiols or carboxylic acids" means protecting groups such as those described in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Greene T.W. and Wuts P.G.M., ed. John Wiley and Sons, 1991 and in Protecting Groups, Kocienski P.J., 1994, Georg Thieme Verlag. A person skilled in the art will be capable of selecting the appropriate protecting groups. The compounds of formula (I) can comprise precursor groups for other functions which are generated subsequently in one or more steps.<br><br><br>
A subject of the present invention is also a process<br>
for preparing the compounds of formula (I),<br>
characterized in that:<br>
1) when A represents a —C=C— group:<br>
a) either, if n = 1, a Mannich reaction is carried out<br>
between the phenylacetylene derivative of formula : Y<br>
-C=CH        (||)<br>
X<br>
in which R1# X and Y are as defined for (I), the formaldehyde and the amine (1) HNR2R3, R2 and R3 being as defined for (I);<br>
b) or, a Suzuki coupling is carried out between the<br>
compound of formula:<br><br>
in which X, Y, n", R2 and R3 are as defined for (I) and Z represents a bromine, an iodine or a trifluoromethanesulphonate (OTf) group and a boron derivative (2) of formula Ri-B(OR)2 in which R represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl or aryl group in the presence of a base and a metal catalyst; c) or, when Ri represents a cyclohexyl group monosubstituted, disubstituted, trisubstituted or tetrasubstituted with a methyl group; a cycloheptyl, 4-<br><br><br>
tetrahydropyranyl, 4-tetrahydrothiopyranyl or adamantyl group, a coupling is carried out between compound (la)<br><br>
in which Z represents an iodine or bromine atom and the<br><br>
ketone (3) corresponding to Ri represented by<br>
in the presence of a base, to give the intermediate compound of formula:<br><br>
in which X, Y, n, R2 and R3 are as defined for (I) ; the<br>
said compound (I1) then being reduced under selective<br>
conditions;<br>
d) or, a coupling reaction is carried out between the<br>
amine of formula:<br><br>
in which n, R2 and R3 are as defined for (I) , and the compound of formula :<br><br>
in which R1# X and Y are as defined for (I) and Z represents a bromine or iodine atom or a trifluoromethylsulphonate (triflate or OTf) group;<br><br><br>
2) when A represents a — CH=CH~ group, a hydrogenation is carried out, with nascent hydrogen or in the presence of cyclohexene, of compound (I) in which A represents an acetylene group —C=C~, in order to prepare the ethylenic compound (I) in the form of a mixture of the Z and E isomers, or this hydrogenation is carried out in the presence of a metal catalyst on a support in order to prepare the ethylenic compound (I) in Z form, or alternatively compound (I) in which A represents an acetylene group —CsC~ is reacted with a metal hydride in order to prepare the ethylenic compound (I) in E form;<br>
3) when A represents a -CH2-CH2- group, a hydrogenation is carried out on compound (I) in which A represents a -CH=CH" or -C=c— group.<br>
Step la of the process according to the invention is carried out with heating, preferably at a temperature of between 80°C and 90°C, in a polar solvent such as 1,2-dimethoxyethane or 1,4-dioxane. A catalyst can be used to facilitate the condensation reaction, for example a metal salt such as copper II chloride or copper III chloride.<br>
In step lb of the process, the Suzuki coupling is preferably carried out between a compound (la) in which Z represents OTf and the boron derivative (2) of formula Ri-B(OH)2. The reaction is carried out in the<br><br><br>
presence of a base, such as alkali metal or alkaline-earth metal hydroxides, alkoxides, phosphates or carbonates, more particularly potassium phosphate or sodium carbonate. The reaction is carried out in the  presence of a metal catalyst, for example a copper, tin or, preferably, palladium catalyst, such as tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium optionally with a halide such as lithium chloride acting as co-catalyst. The process is performed with heating, at a temperature of between 60°C and 80°C in an inert solvent such as toluene or 1,2-dimethoxethane or, preferably, in a toluene/aqueous solution two-phase medium optionally with a portion of alcohol such as ethanol. Suzuki coupling has been studied in many publications such as, for example, Synth. Commun. 1981, 11   (7) , 513-519 and J. Org. Chem. 1993, 58   (8), 2201-2208. The boronic acids (2) Ri-B(0H)2 are commercially available or synthesized conventionally from the corresponding halo, preferably bromo, derivatives RiBr by the action, for example, of trimethyl borate in the presence of a base such as fcert-butyllithium.<br>
In step lc, the coupling is preferably carried out on a compound (la) in which Z represents a bromine atom, in the presence of a base such as n-butyllithium in an inert solvent, preferably diethyl ether at low temperature, the preferred temperature range being from<br><br><br>
-80 to -70°C. The reduction of (I1) to (I) is carried out under selective conditions, for example according to the method described in Tetrahedron, 1995, 51, 11043-11062 by the action of chlorotrimethylsilane and sodium iodide in a mixture of acetonitrile/chlorinated solvent such as dichloromethane, followed by a treatment with acetic acid in the presence of zinc, or alternatively by the action of hydriodic acid or by ionic hydrogenation by the action of sodium tetraborohydride in triflic acid.<br>
In step Id of the process, the coupling is carried out in the presence of a palladium catalyst, one or more tertiary amines and optionally lithium chloride. A compound (III) in which Z represents a triflate will preferably be used, and the process will be carried out in the presence of a palladium catalyst such as tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium or dichlorobis(triphenylphosphine)palladium and optionally a co-catalyst such as copper iodide. When Z represents a triflate, lithium chloride will also be used. This coupling is preferably carried out in the presence of triethylamine and pyridine at the reflux point of the reaction mixture. For this type of coupling, known as Sonogashira coupling, reference may be made to J. Org. Chem. 1993, 58,   7368-7376 and 1998, 63,   1109-1118 ; Syn.

To prepare the compounds (I) in which A represents a —CH=CH— group in Z form, the hydrogenation is generally carried out in the presence of cyclohexene and a metal catalyst on a support, such as palladium on barium sulphate or calcium carbonate or Raney nickel or, preferably, the Lindlar catalyst, in a solvent which is inert for the reaction, such as petroleum ether or an alcoholic solvent. To prepare the compounds (I) in E form, the metal hydride preferably used is diisobutylaluminium hydride (DIBALH) in an inert solvent such as toluene.<br>
To prepare the compounds (I) in which A represents a ~CH2—CH2~ group, the hydrogenation is generally carried out in an alcohol, for example ethanol, in the presence of a catalyst such as platinum oxide or, preferably, palladium on charcoal.<br>
For the techniques for reducing the alkenes and alkynes used above,   reference may be made to "Catalytic Hydrogenation. Techniques and Applications in Organic Chemistry", Robert L. Augustine, 1965, Marcel Dekker, Inc. New York.<br>
The general process for preparing the compounds (I) in which A represents an acetylene group —C=C_ is described in Scheme 1 below :<br><br><br><br><br>
In Scheme 1, A = -C=C~ , and X, Y, n, Ri, R2 and R3 are as defined for (I), R represents a hydrogen atom or an -^    alkyl or aryl group, Z represents a bromine or iodine atom or a triflate and Z' represents a triflate when Z represents a bromine or iodine, or else Z' represents a<br><br><br>
bromine or iodine atom. The importance of the nature of the substituents Z and Z' in the coupling reaction labelled ROUTE D will be detailed hereinbelow.<br>
Compound (II) is obtained by treatment in basic medium<br>
of the chloroacrolein of formula:<br><br>
in which X, Y and Ri are as defined for (I) , preferably by the action of sodium hydroxide in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or, preferably, 1,4-dioxane, at the reflux temperature of the solvent.<br>
The chloroacrolein (IV) is prepared from the acetophenone of formula:<br><br>
in which X, Y and Ri are as defined for (I) , by the action of a Vilsmeier complex. Use is made, for example, of (chloromethylene)dimethylammonium chloride, a commercial Vilsmeier complex, or of a Vilsmeier complex obtained from a disubstituted formamide combined with oxalyl chloride, phosphorus oxychloride or phosgene. The process is generally performed in a<br><br><br>
chlorinated solvent or an ether at a temperature of between -20°C and 40°C. A Vilsmeier complex obtained from dimethylformamide and oxalyl chloride in a solvent such as dichloromethane or 1,2-dimethoxyethane at temperatures of between -10°C and 10°C is used more<br>
particularly.<br>
For this type of reaction, reference may be made, for<br>
example, to J. Chem. Soc. (C) 1970, 2484-2488 and<br>
Angew. Chem. Internat. Ed. 1963, 2,   98-99.<br>
The acetophenones (V) are known or prepared according<br>
to known methods such as those described in Gazz. Chim.<br>
Ital. 1949, 79,   453-457 and J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1947, 69,<br>
1651-1652.<br>
Scheme 2 illustrates the methods used to prepare the<br>
compounds (V).<br><br><br><br><br>
In Scheme 2, X, Y and Ri are as defined for (I), Cy is as defined above for (I'), Z represents a bromine or iodine atom or OTf, R represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl or aryl group and P represents a protecting group for the ketone function such as a methyl.<br><br><br>
The compounds (V) can be obtained directly from the compounds (Va) by the action of the boron compound Ri-B(0R)2 (2) as described for the conversion from (la) to (I). The ketone function of the compound (Va) can also be protected conventionally, for example by the action of a trialkyl orthoformate in the corresponding alcohol in the presence of an acid such as para-toluenesulphonic acid.<br><br><br>
The compound (Vp) is thus obtained, which is reacted<br>
with the ketone<br><br>
under the conditions described<br><br>
for the conversion from (la) to (I')- The ketone function is deprotected by hydrolysis in acidic medium to give the compound (V ) . The said compound ("V ) is then reduced under the mild conditions described for the conversion of (I') to (I)'.<br>
In certain cases, for example when Ri represents a 4,4-dimethylcyclohexyl or 4-tetrahydropyranyl group, the intermediate compound of formula:<br>
-C—CH3    (VI)<br>
in which X = 0 or -C(CH3)2 may be formed, which will give, after prior protection of the ketone function and hydrogenation, for example in the presence of palladium on charcoal in methanol, followed by deprotection of the ketone function, the desired compound (V).<br><br><br>
The compounds (V) in which X and/or Y is other than hydrogen can be obtained from the compounds (V) in which X = Y = H by methods known to those skilled in the art. For example, when X and/or Y represents a chlorine atom, chlorination of the aromatic nucleus is carried out by the action of gaseous chlorine in the presence of a Lewis acid, preferably aluminium trichloride, in a chlorinated solvent such as dichloromethane, preferably at 0°C.<br>
The compounds (Va) are commercially available or can be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art.<br>
For example, when Z represents a triflate, the compound (Va) can be prepared as shown in SCHEME 3:<br><br>
In Scheme 3, X and Y are as defined for (I). The compounds (VIII) are commercially available or prepared conventionally.<br><br><br>
According to another of its aspects, a subject of the present invention is also the compounds of formula (la) :<br><br>
in which X, Y, n, R2 and R3 are as defined for (I) and Z represents a bromine or iodine atom or OTf. These compounds are novel and constitute key intermediates in the synthesis of the compounds (I).<br>
The present invention also relates to a process for preparing the derivatives (la) characterized in that:<br>
- either, when n = 1, a Mannich reaction is carried out between the phenylacetylene derivative of<br><br>
-C=CH        (Ha) X<br>
in which X and Y are as defined for (I) and Z represents a bromine or iodine atom or OTf, formaldehyde and the amine (1) HNR2R3 ;<br>
- or, a coupling reaction xs carried out between the amine of formula:<br><br><br><br><br><br>
in which R2, R3 and n are as defined for (I), and the derivative of formula:<br>
in which X and Y are as defined for (I), Z represents a bromine or iodine atom or a triflate and Z' represents a bromine or iodine atom if Z represents a triflate, otherwise Z' represents a triflate, in the presence of a palladium catalyst, one or more tertiary amines and optionally lithium chloride.<br>
The Mannich reaction is carried out under the same conditions as those described for the conversion from (II) to (I) .<br>
A Sonogashira reaction described for the coupling of the compounds (III) and (4) is used for the coupling between the compounds (Ilia) and (4). When Z represents a triflate and Z' represents a bromine or iodine atom, the process is performed in the absence of lithium chloride. On the other hand, when Z represents a bromine or iodine atom and Z' represents a triflate, ■* the process is performed in the presence of lithium chloride. The use of lithium chloride makes it possible to direct the coupling reaction.<br>
The propargylamines (4) (in the case where n = 1) are prepared conventionally, for example according to<br><br><br><br>
Tetrahedron Lett. 1989, 30   (13), 1679-1682 starting<br>
with the amine (1) HNR2R3 and 3-bromopropyne by the<br>
action of potassium carbonate in acetonitrile at a<br>
temperature of between 50°C and 80°C.<br>
The compounds (III) in which Z = OTf are conventionally<br>
obtained from the corresponding alcohols of formula: Y<br><br>
X<br>
in which X, Y and Ra are as defined for (I), by the<br>
action of trifluoromethanesulphonic anhydride (triflic<br>
anhydride) in pyridine.<br>
The alcohols (IX) are themselves obtained from the<br>
compounds of formula: Y<br>

in which Z" represents a bromine or iodine atom, according to the methods described previously for the conversion from (la) to (I) or from (Va) to (V) . The compounds (IXa) are commercially available or prepared according to techniques that are well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The compound (Ila) is prepared from the chloroacrolein of formula:<br><br><br><br>

dans laquelle X and Y are as defined for (I) and Z<br>
represents a bromine or iodine atom or OTf, which is<br>
itself obtained from the acetophenone of formula: Y<br>
Z—\ , )— £~CH3   (Va) X<br>
in which X, Y and Z are as defined above for (IVa), according to the methods described for the conversion from (IV) to (II) and from (V) to (IV) .<br>
The compounds according to the invention have undergone biochemical and pharmacological studies. The compounds of formula (I) and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts, hydrates and solvates thereof bind specifically to the sigma receptors, in particular to those of the peripheral nervous system, also known as the sigma-2 receptors.<br>
The affinity for the sigma-1 receptors was studied in vitro  on guinea pig brain membranes using 3H-(+)-3PPP as ligand, according to De Haven-Hudkins et al.,   Life Science 1993, 53,   41-48. (+)-Pentazocin binds specifically to the sigma-1 receptors. A guinea pig brain membrane fragment is prepared according to the<br><br><br><br>
usual methods. The membrane preparation (0.3 mg of protein /ml) is incubated for 150 minutes at 37°C in the presence of 0.5 nM [3H]-{+)-pentazocin. The non¬specific binding is determined in the presence of 10 jiM (+)-pentazocin. The membranes are then filtered and rinsed 3 times. The filtered material is analysed to determine the fraction of [3H]-pentazocin specifically bound. Under these conditions, the compounds of the invention, examples of which follow, have IC50 values of between 0.1 nM and 100 nM.<br>
The capacity of the compounds according to the invention to interact with the sigma-2 receptors was tested in  vitro  on the rat spleen membranes using [3H]-DTG as ligand, according to R. Paul et al.   Journal of Neuroimmunology 1994, 52,   183-192. The membrane preparation (1 ml) is incubated with 2 nM [3H]-DTG for 90 minutes at 20°C. The amount of non-specific binding is estimated in the presence of 10 /xM DTG or haloperidol. The membranes are filtered and washed twice, and the filtered material is analysed to determine the amount of [3H]-DTG specifically bound. The compounds according to the invention have a sigma-2 activity of between 1 nM and 500 nM.<br><br><br>
1 - The compounds according to the invention were also tested in tests of immunosuppressant activity presented below.<br>
D-Galactosamine, SEB and LPS are obtained from Sigma Chemical Co (St Louis, MO). The SEB contains less than 0.00029% of endotoxin ("limulus amoebocyte lysate" test Bioproduct, Walkersvilie, MD). These molecules are dissolved in a phosphate salt buffer solution; the compounds according to the invention are dissolved in a solution containing 5% ethanol, 5% Tween 80 and 90% water.<br>
The mice used are 6- to 8-week-old female Balb/C mice obtained from the Charles River breeding stock (France) and 8-week-old female C57BL/6 and B6D2F1 mice obtained from the IFFA CREDO breeding stock (Domaine des Oncins, BP 0109, 69592 L'Arbresle Cedex, France). Cytokine determination: 5 mice are injected with the compounds or the solvent alone, intraperitoneally 30 minutes before the LPS (10 /xg/mouse intravenously) or orally 1 hour before. Blood samples are taken by retro-orbital or cardiac puncture, 1 hour 3 0 minutes after the injection of LPS. The samples are centrifuged and the serum is taken. The serum is stored at -80°C before analysis. The TNF- and IL-10 contents are determined with the aid of the ELISA kit (Genzyme, Cambridge). The<br><br><br>
tests are carried out according to the instructions featured on the notice for use. Toxin shock: the compounds are administered intraperitoneally to 10 animals. 30, minutes later, SEB {Staphylococcus  enterotoxin B, Sigma St. Louis, MO) is administered at a rate of 10 /j.g/mouse  intravenously, and D-galactosamine is administered (20 mg/mouse, intraperitoneally). Death is observed 48 hours later.<br>
GVH (Graft-Versus-Host) disease: the test compounds or the solvent alone (as control) are injected into female B6D2F1 (H2b x H2d) mice intraperitoneally. 4 hours later, they are injected with 7.5 x 107 C57BL/6 (H2b) mouse spleen mononuclear cells to initiate the GVH. All the animals are sacrificed one week after the graft and the increase in the weight of their spleen, caused by GVH, is measured. The following index is<br>
calculated: I =	weight of the  weight of the<br>
spleen	spleen.<br>
weight of the / weight of the<br>
animal	animal<br>
The results are expressed as<br>
follows: PS =	Iexp - 1   x10Q<br>
Icontr - 1 with PS : percentage of splenomegaly.<br><br><br>
Measurement of the T cell proliferation; Cell suspensions are prepared using Balb/C mouse spleens. The red blood cells are first lysed in the course of a short hypotonic shock carried out with sterile distilled water. The remaining cells (the white blood cells) are washed twice with the culture medium (RPMI 1640 containing 2% heat-inactivated foetal calf serum, 2mM L-glutamine, ImM sodium pyruvate, 100 Ul/ml of penicillin, 100 /xg/ml of streptomycin and 15 mM PIPES) adjusted beforehand to pH 6.6. The cell viability, determined using the trypan blue technique, always exceeds 95% by this preparation method.<br>
The splenocytes, at a concentration of 6 x 106 cells/ml, are cultured with the test products, in flat-bottomed 96-well plates (Falcon, Becton Dickinson, Lincoln Park, NJ) in the presence of 2 ji^/ml of SEB. Four wells are prepared for each concentration of test products. The incubation is carried out at 37°C in a cell culture incubator (atmosphere: 95% air + 5% CO2) for 4 days. 2 ^tCi of tritiated thymidine (Amersham, Les Ullis, France) are then added to each culture well. Four hours later, the cells are recovered on a glass fibre filter (Filtermat A, Wallac, Turku, Finland) using a skatron (Pharmacia LKB, Piscataway, NJ). The radioactivity incorporated and bound on the filter is measured in a<br><br><br>
suitable liquid scintillation counter (Betaplate,<br>
Pharmacia LKB).<br>
The compounds according to the invention thus show<br>
immunosuppressant activity according to the results<br>
observed during these biochemical and behavioural<br>
tests.<br>
2 - The compounds according to the invention also<br>
underwent tests showing their capacity to inhibit the proliferation of tumour cells and cancer cells. Measurement of the proliferation of MDA/MB231 cells<br>
(hormone-independant breast cancer) : The MDA/MB231 cells are maintained in  vitro  by successive passages in DMEM medium (Gibco Laboratories, Grand Island, NY) containing 10% heat-inactivated foetal calf serum, ImM sodium pyruvate, 100 Ul/ml penicillin and 100 /j.g/m.1  of streptomycin.<br>
For the proliferation measurement, the cells, at a concentration of 2 x 105/ml, are cultured with the test products in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10/ig/ml of bovine insulin (Sigma) and 10/ig/ml of apotransferrin (Sigma), in flat-bottomed 96-well plates (Falcon, Becton Dickinson, Lincoln Park, NJ). Three wells are prepared for each concentration of the test products. The incubation is carried out at 37°C in a cell culture incubator (atmosphere : 95% air + 5% C02) for 4 days. 2 /iCi of tritiated thymidine (Amersham, Les Ullis,<br><br><br>
France) are then added to each culture well. Twenty-four hours later, the cells are detached using trypsin-EDTA (Gibco) and recovered on a glass fibre filter (Filtermat A, Wallac, Turku, Finland) using a skatron (Pharmacia LKB, Piscataway, NJ). The radioactivity incorporated and bound on the filter is measured in a suitable liquid scintillation counter (Betaplate, Pharmacia LKB). 3 - The compounds of the invention also underwent tests<br>
demonstrating their value in the cardiovascular<br>
field. The antiarrhythmic effects of the compounds according to the invention were tested on reinfusion arrhythmias in anaesthetized rats. The experiment was performed on male Sprague Dawley rats under normal tension, weighing from 250 to 3 00 g. These animals are obtained from the IFFA CREDO breeding stock. The animals are kept under standard laboratory conditions and fed with standard food: A04 (UAR). Water is supplied ad libitum. The occlusion and reinfusion technique used in this study corresponds to the methods described by Manning et al.    (Circ. Res. 1984, 55,   545-548) and Kane et al. (Br. J. Pharmacol. 1984, 82,   349-357), slightly modified.<br>
The animals were anaesthetized with pentobarbital sodium in a proportion of 60 mg/kg intraperitoneally,<br><br><br>
tracheotomized and ventilated with ambient air (Harward respirator). A catheter (PE10) was placed in the jugular vein for the intravenous injection of the test products. Hypodermic needles were placed on the four legs of the animal to record the electrocardiogram (ECG), usually DII (Gould ES1000 or on an Astromed 7400 polygraph). After performing a thoracotomy, a thread was placed on the left anterior descending coronary artery, near to its origin, to ligate the artery. The two ends of the thread are passed through a plastic tube, which is placed on the surface of the heart, just above the coronary artery. The coronary artery was occluded by exerting a tension on the ends of the thread for 5 minutes, and reinfusion was carried out by relaxing the tension. The temperature of the animal was controlled and maintained at 37°C by means of a homeothermal cover.<br>
For the intravenous-route study, the products were dissolved in a mixture of 75% PEG-400/distilled water and injected 5 minutes before ligating the artery. The products were injected in a volume of 0.1 ml/100 g of rat. The control group received this solvent. For the oral-route study, the products were suspended in 0.6% methylcellulose and administered to the conscious animal by gavage, 120 minutes before ligating the coronary artery. The products were administered in<br><br><br>
a volume of 1 ml/100 g of rat. The control group received this vehicle.<br>
The following arrhythmias were analysed by ECG during the reinfusion period (study lasting 10 minutes), according to the Lambeth Conventions (Cardiovasc. Res., 1988, 22,   447-455) :<br>
-	ventricular extrasystoles (VES),<br>
-	ventricular tachycardia (TV), given that the VT is the succession of at least four. VESs,<br>
-	ventricular fibrillation (VF),<br>
-	and mortality by fatal ventricular fibrillation or by cardiac arrest.<br>
These arrhythmias are expressed as a percentage of animals exhibiting the event (frequency). The animals were divided into groups of 4 to 10 animals. Each animal received only one dose, of product. Both intravenously and orally, the products protect the animal against reinfusion arrhythmias by reducing or eliminating the mortality and frequency of the VFs. Furthermore, certain products reduce and/or eliminate the frequency of the VTs and the VESs, when they are administered intravenously.<br>
The involvement of CYP 2D6 can be demonstrated by in vitro metabolism studies on human hepatic microsomal fractions. The concept most commonly used is inhibition<br><br><br><br>
of the enzyme by its specific inhibitor: quinidine used<br>
at 20 times its Ki value, the Ki being the absolute<br>
value of the inhibition constant of an active principle<br>
with respect to an enzyme.<br>
Various models make it possible to demonstrate, in a<br>
specific metabolic reaction, the involvement of CYP<br>
2D6.<br>
It is possible to use human hepatic microsomal fractions which contain all of the human hepatic isoforms incubated in the presence of oxidoreduction co-factor (NADPH) and in the absence or presence of quinidine at 2 0 times its Ki value with respect to CYP 2D6. The decrease in metabolization observed in the presence of quinidine may be associated with the inhibition of CYP 2D6 isoform, thus proving its possible involvement in the metabolic pathway(s) studied. Microsomal fractions prepared from transfected cells which express only one isoform of human cytochrome P-450 (GENTEST Corp.) can also be used. Human hepatocytes in primary culture which are capable of carrying out phase I and II metabolic reactions can also be used. In this case, the incubations are performed kinetically over 24 hours in the presence and absence of quinidine, a powerful and specific inhibitor of CYP 2D6.<br><br><br>
Reference may be made to J. Pharm. Exp. Ther. 1996, 277, 321-332.<br>
The compounds according to the invention were<br>
particularly studied as follows:<br>
The said compound is incubated with human hepatic microsomal fractions and NADPH (oxidoreduction co-factor) as well as in the presence or absence of quinidine. The degree of inhibition of the metabolization observed in the presence of quinidine reflects the involvement of CYP 2D6 in the metabolization of the said compound. This approach can be used when the metabolization on hepatic microsomal fractions is of a sufficient amplitude (i.e. greater than or equal to 10% of the amount of starting substrate).<br>
When the metabolization of the said compound on hepatic microsomes is too small to be able to quantify an inhibition with precision, or when additional verifications are necessary, additional, more in-depth studies on human hepatocytes in primary culture are performed kinetically over 24 hours. The degree of involvement of CYP 2D6 in the overall hepatic metabolization is then revealed by the decrease in the intrinsic clearance of the said<br><br><br>
compound, possibly observed in the presence of quinidine.<br>
The results obtained show that the compounds according to the invention have a low degree of metabolization and/or little involvement of CYP 2D6 in the oxidation process. No sign of toxicity is observed with these compounds at the pharmacologically active doses and their toxicity is thus compatible with their use as medicinal products.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are particularly advantageous and may be used advantageously as medicinal products especially for treating conditions in which it is desirable to reduce the immunological activity, and also conditions associated with inflammatory disorders. Mention may be made, as non-limiting guide, of: conditions with autoimmune components such as, for example, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus erythematosus, conditions caused by demyelinization, for instance multiple sclerosis, Crohn's disease, atopic dermatitis, diabetes or graft rejection reactions, graft-versus-host reaction, organ transplant conditions, or alternatively autoimmune uveitis,   uveoretinitis,   Behcet's disease, atherosclerosis, asthma, fibrotic diseases, pulmonary<br><br><br>
idiopathic fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, glomerulonephritis, certain spondylarthropathies, rheumatoid spondylitis, osteoarthritis, gout, bone and cartilage resorption, osteoporosis, Paget's disease, septic shock, septicaemia, endotoxin shock, adult respiratory distress syndrome, silicosis, asbestosis, pulmonary sarcoidosis, ulcerative colitis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, disseminated lupus erythematosus, haemodynamic shock, ischaemic pathologies (myocardial infarction, myocardial ischaemia, coronary vasospasm, angina pectoris, cardiac insufficiency, heart attack), post-ischaemic reinfusion attacks, malaria, mycobacterial infections, meningitis, leprosy, viral infections (HIV, cytomegalovirus, herpesvirus), AIDS-related opportunist infections, tuberculosis, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and contact dermatitis, cachexia and radiation-related damage.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can also be used in therapy in any pathological process which entails the proliferation of tumour cells. This cell proliferation can be either hormone-sensitive or hormone-insensitive. More specifically, clinical applications for which the use of these compounds may be envisaged comprise conditions resulting from a proliferation of tumour cells, in particular<br><br><br>
glioblastomas, neuroblastomas, lymphomas, myelomas,<br>
melanomas, leukaemia, carcinomas of the colon, and<br>
colorectal, epithelial, hepatic, pulmonary, mammary,<br>
ovarian, pancreatic, bladder or prostate carcinomas.<br>
The compounds according to the invention may thus be<br>
used advantageously as medicinal products intended to<br>
combat the proliferation of tumour cells, in particular<br>
as antitumour agents or anticancer agents.<br>
They may also be used in the cardiovascular field, more<br>
particularly for treating heart; rate disorders.<br>
The compounds according to the invention may also be<br>
very advantageous for their neuroprotective activity as<br>
well as their activity on apoptosis.<br>
The use of the compounds according to the invention to<br>
treat the conditions mentioned above, as well as for<br>
the preparation of medicinal products intended to treat<br>
the said conditions, forms an integral part of the<br>
invention.<br>
A subject of the present invention is thus also<br>

The tablets can be coated with sucrose, with a cellulosic derivative, or with other suitable materials, or alternatively they can be treated such that they have a prolonged or delayed activity and such that they release a predetermined amount of active principle continuously.<br>
A preparation in gel capsules is obtained by mixing the active ingredient with a diluent and pouring the mixture obtained into soft or hard gel capsules. A preparation in the form of a syrup or elixir or for administration in the form of drops can contain the active ingredient together with a sweetener, preferably a calorie-free sweetener, methyl paraben and propyl paraben as antiseptic, as well as a flavour enhancer and a suitable dye.<br>
The water-dispersible powders or granules can contain the active ingredient mixed with dispersants, wetting agents or suspending agents, such as<br><br><br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone, as well as with sweeteners or<br>
flavour enhancers.<br>
For rectal administration, use is made of suppositories<br>
which are prepared with binders melting at rectal<br>
temperature, for example cocoa butter or polyethylene<br>
glycols.<br>
For parenteral administration, use is made of aqueous<br>
suspensions, isotonic saline solutions or injectable<br>
sterile solutions which contain pharmacologically<br>
compatible dispersants and/or wetting agents, for<br>
example propylene glycol or butylene glycol.<br>
The active principle can also be formulated in the form<br>
of microcapsules, optionally with one or more supports<br>
or additives, or alternatively with matrices such as a<br>
polymer or a cyclodextrin (patch, sustained-release<br>
forms).<br>
The compositions of the present invention can contain,<br>
along with the products of formula (I) above or the<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates and<br>
hydrates thereof, other active principles which can be<br>
used in the treatment of the complaints or conditions<br>
