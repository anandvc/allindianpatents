				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a replaceable roof for sintering furnaces for the incorporation of curtain type top mounted gas fired burner system. In particular the present invention relates to a replaceable roof for sintering furnaces for top mounted burner systems for igniting the top layer of the sinter bed.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Sintering is a process of agglomerating iron-ore fines for improving properties of raw materials in iron and steel manufacture by its fluxing, desulphurisation, and dearsenification. In sintering process, generally iron ore concentrate or iron ore fines are thoroughly mixed with blast furnace flue dust, fine coke breeze and limestone. The mixture is moistened and loaded on to a sintering furnace in a layer of 200 - 350 mm thickness. An intensive flame source ignites the fuel contained in the charge layer. The flame source is provided by number of burners at the side wall of the sinter hood. The furnaces are lined in the roof with metal clad hanging bricks of generally mag-chrome quality. Side walls are lined with fire clay/insulation bricks. Burners are installed in the side walls for horizontal firing. An exhaust fan located beneath the agglomeration charge effects air suction through the layer. In such conventional furnaces the burning commences at the top of the charge layer, gradually proceeds downwards through the charge layer and ends at the grate of the furnace. Burning fuel raises the temperature in excess of 14OOÂ°C which is sufficient to partially fuse and sinter the charge grains. Upon completion of the burning, the whole charge layer becomes a porous lumpy product for charging into Blast Furnace.<br>
In general, the sinter hood or sintering furnaces have dimensions of 8,000-10,000 mm length 4,000 - 5,000 mm width and about 1200 to 1400 mm height. The lining is done with metal clad hanging bricks in the roof and fire clay/insulation bricks in the side walls. 12-16 Nos. of burners are provided at both the side walls of the sinter hood. Mixed gas (mixture of Blast Furnace and Coke Oven gas) of about 1800 calorific value is used for making the sinter.<br>
2<br><br>
Such conventional arrangement of burners, in particular burners which are horizontal to the side walls of sintering furnace, does not allow proper contact with the charge. As the burners are horizontally fixed to the side walls the flames do not properly touch the charge and the efficiency of the furnace is not satisfactory. This leads to high fuel consumption and substantial increase in the production cost. Furthermore every year during the capital repairs of the furnaces total bricks are dismantled and new brick lining is carried out. This is due to the non modular design of the support structure for the burner system. Life of the refractory in case of the conventional horizontal mounted burner system is around a year as the refractory gets damaged due to loosening of refractory lining and falling of bricks from roof and cracking of side wall burner blocks,<br>
Therefore there is a need to provide a burner system and support structure which allow improved ignition efficiency of sintering furnaces and has longer life<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
Therefore the object of the present invention is to provide a novel arrangement of burners and support system for allowing improved ignition efficiency of sintering furnaces leading to lower fuel consumption.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a novel arrangement of burners and support system which requires lower maintenance<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide a novel arrangement of burners and support system which is easy installation in sintering furnaces with the least modification in the same<br>
The applicants have now developed a replaceable roof structure for sintering furnaces for incorporation of top mounted gas fired burner system. Such top mounted burner systems allow better contact of the flames with the charge and also reduces the burning<br>
3<br><br>
zone and height of furnace which in turn reduces the cost towards refractories for lining the furnaces.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides replaceable roof for sintering furnaces along with separators for incorporation of curtain type top mounted vertically gas fired burner system wherein<br>
the sintering furnace comprises sinter bed and end walls defining the charging side and the discharge side, the replaceable roof comprising:<br>
a plurality of cast beams comprising at least two main beams separating said top mounted burners and at least two end beams in contact with end walls of said sintering furnace wherein said at feast two beams in contact with end walls comprises at least one in the charging side and at least one at the discharge side, thereby decreasing the furnace height and furnace lenath;<br>
vertically fired burners being disposed in between said main beams such that the flames of said burners ignite the top layer of sinter bed<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to a preferred embodiment and accompanying figures:<br>
Figure 1 shows a conventional furnace with horizontal burners<br>
Figure 2 shows the replaceable roof of sinter furnace of present invention<br>
Figure 3 shows roof beam arrangement<br>
Figure 4 shows isometric view of end beam<br>
Figure 5 shows isometric view of main beam<br>
Figure 6 shows cross sectional views of main beam and end beam<br>

Description of preferred embodiment<br>
Figure 1 shows a conventional furnace with horizontal burners. The furnace is lined in the roof with metal dad hanging bricks of Mag-chrome quality. Side walls are lined with fire clay/insulation b<br>
ricks. Six burners (1), as seen in the elevation view, are provided with air supply (2) and mixed gas supply (3). The charging side (4) and the discharge side (5) are as indicated. The distance between two columns (6) is around 3000 mm.<br>
Figure 2 shows the roof system of the present invention. The charging side (7) and the discharge side (8) are as indicated. (9) and (10) are the front and back wall beams with low moisture castable casting respectively. The vertical line (11) indicates the top of the sinter bed. Air (12) and mixed gas (13) are supplied for making the sinter. The roof system, as shown in figure 3, comprises an arrangement of cast beams with preferably low moisture castable which may vary from 4 to 5 depending on the space availability for installation. Two main beams (14 &amp; 15) separating the top mounted burners (16) and two end beams (17 &amp; 18) serving as end walls, one in the charging side and another at the discharge side are provided. The beams are of 7000mm length and 540mm width and end walls are cast with 70% AI2O3 containing Low Moisture Castable (LMC). The beams are provided with SS-310 anchors (19) and ceramic fibre blanket (20). The thickness of the casting at the bottom is 250mm and at the sides is 65mm. The length of the casting on 7000 mm beams is 4000 mm and the remaining 3000 mm is left un-cast on both sides for resting on the furnace support beams which are welded to the vertical columns on both sides of the furnace. Figure 6 shows the pattern details for casting with LMC. The beams (21) and their casting (22) for main beams (figure 6a) and end beams (figure 6b) are shown.<br>
The isometric views of the beams with their castings are shown in figures 4 and 5. (41) indicates the beams and (42) the castings. The main beams are made for placement in the furnace proper and for placing the burner system between the castings. End beams, used for separating the burning zone from the charging zone and cooling zone, are made by joining two "I" beams (41) encased   by   a   metal   plate    on    all   sides    of   the   joined    "I"<br>
5<br><br>
beams for proper support. Total height of the end "I" beams is 700 mm and width 160 mm Casting with LMC of 425 mm at the bottom and 65 mm at the outer face was done of these end beams. The design is done in such a way that casting of the mainbeams just adjacent to the end beams sit tightly on the projected refractory casting of the end beams.<br>
After casting the beams are air cured for 24 hours and heated slowly with mixed gas till 600Â°C is attained for removal of moisture completely.<br>
For installation of above 5 beams in a conventional furnace, the furnace was shut down and 3 m length of the furnace at the charging end is cleared off for refractory and other structures. Two support beams are welded between two columns on either side of the furnace. The beams cast with LMC are then lifted and places on the supporting beams of the furnace one by one. The burners of 250 mm width are placed after 2 beams (one end beam and one main beam) which are connected to air and gas pipe lines. Furnace roof height above charge ievel reduced from 1400 mm to about 500 mm. All other horizontal burners are closed. The length of the burning zone of the furnace comes down to 3000 mm form 8000 to 10000 mm. The efficiency of the furnace improved as the flames are directly impinging on the sinter bed and cooling zone is increased by 5000 mm.<br>
As the furnace working volume is reduced considerably, energy efficiency of the furnace improves and refractories consumption is found to be reduced by about 70%<br>
