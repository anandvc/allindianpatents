				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a burner for operating a heat generator according to the preamble of claim 1.<br>
EP-0 780 629 A2 has disclosed a burner which consists of a swirl generator on the incident-flow side, the flow formed herein being passed over smoothly into a mixing section. This is done with the aid of a transition geometry, which is formed at the start of the mixing section* for this purpose and consists of transition passages which cover sectors of the end face of the mixing section, in accordance with the number of acting sectional bodies of the swirl generator, and run helically in the direction of flow. On the outflow-side of these transition passages, the mixing section has a number of prefilming bores, which ensure that the flow velocity along the tube wall is increased. This is then followed by a combustion chamber, the transition between the mixing section and the combustion chamber being formed by a jump in cross section, in the plane of which a backflow zone or backflow bubble forms.<br>
The swirl intensity in the swirl generator is therefore selected in such a way that the breakdown of the vortex does not take place inside the mixing section but further downstream, as explained above in the region of the jump in cross section. The length of the mixing section is dimensioned in such a way that an adequate mixture quality is ensured for all types of fuel.<br>
Although this burner, compared with those from the prior art, has brought about a significant improvement with regard to intensification of the flame stability, lower pollutant emissions, lower pulsations, complete burn-out, large operating range, good cross-<br><br>
ignition between the various burners, compact construction, improved mixing, etc., it has been found that a further intensification of the flame stability as well as improved adaptation of the flame to the predetermined geometry of the combustion chamber has become necessary for smooth operation at the highest level in the premix combustion of the newer generation, in particular when it is a matter of eliminating the pulsations.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, one object of the invention, as defined in the claims, in a burner of the type mentioned at the beginning, is to provide novel measures which bring about an intensification of the flame stability and an adaptation of the flame to the predetermined geometry of the combustion chamber without reducing the other advantages of this burner in any way.<br>
For this purpose, the fuel nozzle which acts on the head side and belongs to the swirl generator of the burner, this fuel nozzle preferably being arranged on the axis of the swirl generator or the burner and being operated with a liquid fuel as a rule, is surrounded at a distance by an annular casing in which bores are made in the peripheral direction, and an air quantity for purging around the fuel nozzle flows through these bores. Additional injectors, which are preferably operated with a gaseous fuel, interact with these bores. A small quantity of fuel is injected by these injectors into the air quantity for purging around the fuel nozzle in such a way that the burner-flow center, which is important for the stability of the flame, is always supplied to the correct extent. This achieves the effect that an even fuel concentration appears over the cross section of flow of the burner and results in the suppression of combustion-chamber oscillations. This even fuel concentration over the cross section of flow becomes particularly apparent on the burner axis.<br><br>
where it is known from experience that the oscillations in the flame front, which lead to pulsations, are produced on account of uneven fuel enrichment. In addition, with the suppression of the combustion-chamber oscillations, the operating range of the burner is substantially extended, since instability of the flame, which leads to a deterioration of the extinction limit, need no longer be feared.<br>
A further advantage of the invention may be seen in the fact that the purging air through the said openings in the region of the fuel nozzle prevents wetting of the inner wall of the conical swirl generator by the injected liquid fuel.<br>
Advantageous and expedient developments of the achievement of the object according to the invention are defined in the further claims.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a burner for operating a heat generator, the burner comprising: swirl generator for a combustion air flow and means for injecting at least one fuel into the combustion air flow; a mixing section arranged downstream of the swirl generator and having inside a first part of the mixing section in the direction of flow, a number of transition passages for passing a flow formed in the swirl generator into a mixing tube arranged downstream of the transition passages and merging into a burner front, characterized in that the swirl generator has means for evening out the fuel concentration through a flow cross section of the mixing tube and the means has a number of bores arranged circumferentially on a head side of the swirl generator and fuel injectors that inject a fuel into an air quantity flowing through the bores.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals designate identical or corresponding parts throughout the several views, all features not essential for the direct understanding of the invention have been omitted, and the direction of flow of the media is indicated by arrows, Fig. 1 shows the overall construction of a burner. Initially a swirl generator 100 is effective, the configuration of which is shown and described in more detail below in Figs 3-6. This swirl generator 100 is a conical structure to which a combustion-air flow 115 entering tangentially is repeatedly admitted tangentially. The flow forming herein, with the aid of a transition geometry provided downstream of the swirl generator 100, is passed over smoothly into a transition piece 200 in such a way that no separation regions can occur there. The configuration of this transition geometry is described in more detail under Fig. 6. This transition piece 200 is extended on the outflow side of the transition geometry by a mixing tube 20, both parts forming the actual mixing section 220. The mixing section 220 may of course be made in one piece, i.e. the transition piece 200 and the mixing tube 20 are then fused to form a single cohesive structure, the characteristics of each part being retained. If transition piece 200 and mixing tube 20 are constructed from two parts, these parts are connected by a sleeve ring 10, the same sleeve ring 10 serving as an anchoring surface for the swirl generator 100 on the head side. In addition, such a sleeve ring 10 has the advantage that various mixing tubes can be used. Located on the outflow side of the mixing tube 20 is the actual combustion chamber 30,<br><br>
which is symbolized here merely by a flame tube. The mixing tube 220 largely fulfills the task of providing a defined section, in which perfect premixing of fuels of various types can be achieved, downstream of the swirl generator 100. Furthermore, this mixing section, that is primarily the mixing tube 20, enables the flow to be directed free of losses so that at first no backflow zone or backflow bubble can form even in interaction with the transition geometry, whereby the mixing qualities for all types of fuel can be influenced over the length of the mixing section 220. However, this mixing section 220 has another property, which consists in the fact that, in the mixing tube 220 itself, the axial velocity profile has a pronounced maximum on the axis, so that a flashback of the flame from the combustion chamber is not possible. However, it is correct to say that this axial velocity decreases toward the wall in such a configuration. In order also to prevent a flashback in this region, the mixing tube 20 is provided in the flow and peripheral directions with a number of regularly or irregularly distributed bores 21 having widely differing cross sections and directions, through which an air quantity flows into the interior of the mixing tube 20 and induces an increase in the rate of flow along the wall for the purposes of a prefilmer. These bores 21 may also be designed in such a way that effusion cooling appears at least in addition at the inner wall of the mixing tube 20. Another possibility of increasing the velocity of the mixture inside the mixing tube 20 is for the cross section of flow of the mixing tube 20 on the outflow side of the transition passages 201, which form the transition geometry already mentioned, to undergo a convergence, as a result of which the entire velocity level inside the mixing tube 20 is raised. In the figure, these bores 21 run at an acute angle relative to the burner axis 60. Furthermore, the outlet of the transition passages 201 corresponds to the narrowest cross  section  of  flow  of  the  mixing  tube  20.<br><br>
Said transition passages 201 accordingly bridge the respective difference in cross section without at the same time adversely affecting the flow formed. If the measure selected initiates an intolerable pressure loss when directing the tube flow 4 0 along the mixing tube 20, this may be remedied by a diffuser (not shown in the figure) being provided at the end of this mixing tube. A combustion chamber 30 then adjoins the end of the mixing tube 20, there being a jump in cross section, formed by a burner front 70, between the two cross sections of flow. Not until here does a central flame front having a backflow zone 50 form, which has the properties of a bodiless flame retention baffle relative to the flame front. If a fluidic marginal zone, in which vortex separations arise due to the vacuum prevailing there, forms inside this jump in cross section during operation, this leads to intensified ring stabilization of the backflow zone 50. At the end face, the combustion chamber 3 0 has a number of openings 31 through which an air quantity flows directly into the jump in cross section and there, inter alia, helps to intensify the ring stabilization of the backflow zone 50. In addition, it must not be left unmentioned that the generation of a stable backflow zone 50 also requires a sufficiently high swirl coefficient in a tube. If such a high swirl coefficient is undesirable at first, stable backflow zones may be generated by the feed of small, intensely swirled air flows at the tube end, for example through tangential openings. It is assumed here that the air quantity required for this is approximately 5-20% of the total air quantity. As far as the configuration of the burner front 70 at the end of the mixing tube 20 for stabilizing the backflow zone or backflow bubble 50 is concerned, reference is made to the description under Fig. 8.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a schematic view of the burner according to Fig. 1, reference being made here in particular to the purging around a centrally arranged<br><br>
fuel nozzle 103 and to the action of fuel injectors 170. The mode of operation of the remaining main components of the burner, namely swirl generator 100 and transition piece 200, are described in more detail under the following figures. The fuel nozzle 103 is encased at a distance by a ring 190 in which a number of bores 161 disposed in peripheral direction are placed, and an air quantity 160 flows through these bores 161 into an annular chamber 180 and performs the purging there around the fuel lance. These bores 161 are positioned so as to slant forward in such a way that an appropriate axial component is obtained on the burner axis 60. Provided in interaction with these bores 161 are additional fuel injectors 170 which feed a certain quantity, of preferably a gaseous fuel into the respective air quantity 160 in such a way that an even fuel concentration appears in the mixing tube 20 over the cross section of flow, as the representation in the figure is intended to symbolize. It is precisely this even fuel concentration 150, in particular the pronounced concentration on the burner axis 60, which provides for stabilization of the flame front at the outlet of the burner, whereby the occurrence of combustion-chamber pulsations is avoided.<br>
In order to better understand the construction of the swirl generator 100, it is of advantage if at least Fig. 4 is used at the same time as Fig. 3. In the description of Fig. 3 below, the remaining figures are referred to when required.<br>
The first part of the burner according to Fig. 1 forms the swirl generator 100 shown according to Fig. 3 . The swirl generator 100 consists of two hollow conical sectional bodies 101, 102 which are nested one inside the other in a mutually offset manner. The number of conical sectional bodies may of course be greater than two, as Figures 5 and 6 show; this depends in each case on the mode of operation of the entire burner, as will be explained in more detail further below.  It  is  not  out  of  the  question  in  certain<br><br>
operating configurations to provide a swirl generator consisting of a single spiral. The mutual offset of the respective center axis or longitudinal symmetry axes 101b, 102b (cf. Fig. 4) of the conical sectional bodies 101, 102 provides at the adjacent wall, in mirror-image arrangement, one tangential duct each, i.e. an air-inlet slot 119, 120 (cf. Fig. 4) through which the combustion air 115 flows into the interior space of the swirl generator 100, i.e. into the conical hollow space 114 of the same. The conical shape of the sectional bodies 101, 102 shown has a certain fixed angle in the direction of flow. Of course, depending on the operational use, the sectional bodies 101, 102 may have increasing or decreasing conicity in the direction of flow, similar to a. trumpet or tulip respectively. The two last-mentioned shapes are not shown graphically, since they can readily be visualized by a person skilled in the art. The two conical sectional bodies 101, 102 each have a cylindrical initial part 101a. Accommodated in the region of this cylindrical initial part is the fuel nozzle 103, which has already been mentioned under Fig. 2 and is preferably operated with a liquid fuel 112. The injection 104 of this fuel 112 coincides approximately with the narrowest cross section of the conical hollow space 114 formed by the conical sectional bodies 101, 102. The injection capacity of this fuel nozzle 103 and its type depend on the predetermined parameters of the respective burner. Furthermore, the conical sectional bodies 101, 102 each have a fuel line 108, 109, and these fuel lines 108, 109 are arranged along the tangential air-inlet slots 119, 120 and are provided with injection openings 117 through which preferably a gaseous fuel 113 is injected into the combustion air 115 flowing through there, as the arrows 116 are intended to symbolize. These fuel lines 108, 109 are preferably arranged at the latest at the end of the tangential inflow, before entering the conical hollow space 114, in order to obtain optimum fuel/air mixing. As mentioned, the fuel 112 fed through<br><br>
the fuel nozzle 103 is a liquid fuel in the normal case,  a mixture  formation with another medium,  for example  with  a  recycled  flue  gas,  being  readily possible. This fuel 112 is injected at a preferably very acute angle into the conical hollow space 114. Thus a conical fuel spray 105, which is enclosed and reduced by the rotating combustion air 115 flowing in tangentially,  forms  from the  fuel  nozzle  103.  The concentration  of  the  injected  fuel  112  is  then continuously reduced in the axial direction by the inflowing combustion air 115 to form a mixture in the direction of vaporization.  If a gaseous fuel 113 is injected via the opening nozzles 117,  the  fuel/air mixture is formed directly at the end of the air-inlet slots  119,  120. . If  the  combustion  air  115  is additionally preheated or, for example, enriched with recycled flue gas or exhaust gas, this provides lasting assistance for the vaporization of the liquid fuel 112, before this mixture flows into the downstream stage, here into the transition piece 200 (cf. Figs 1 and 7) . The same considerations also apply if liquid fuels are to be supplied via the lines 108, 109. Narrow limits per se are to be adhered to in the configuration of the conical sectional bodies 101, 102 with regard to the cone angle and the width of the tangential air-inlet slots 119, 120 so that the desired flow field of the combustion air 115 can develop at the outlet of the swirl generator 100. In general it may be said that a reduction in the tangential air-inlet slots 119,  120 promotes  the  quicker  formation of  a backflow  zone already in the region of the swirl generator. The axial velocity  inside  the  swirl  generator  100  can  be increased or stabilized by a corresponding feed of an air quantity, this feed being described in more detail under Fig. 2 (item 160). Corresponding swirl generation in interaction with the downstream transition piece 200 (cf.  Figs 1 and 7)  prevents the formation of flow separations inside the mixing tube arranged downstream of the swirl generator 100. Furthermore, the design of<br><br>
the swirl generator 100 is especially suitable for changing the size of the tangential air-inlet slots 119, 120, whereby a relatively large operational range can be covered without changing the overall length of the swirl generator 100. The sectional bodies 101, 102 may of course be displaced relative to one another in another plane, as a result of which even an overlap of the same can be provided. Furthermore, it is possible to nest the sectional bodies 101, 102 spirally one inside the other by a contra-rotating movement. It is thus possible to vary the shape, size and configuration of the tangential air-inlet slots 119, 120 as desired, whereby the swirl generator 100 can be used universally without changing its overall length.<br>
Inter alia-, the geometric configuration of baffle plates 121a, 121b, which may be provided as desired, is apparent from Fig. 4. They have a flow-initiating function, in which case, in accordance with their length, they extend the respective end of the conical sectional bodies 101, 102 in the incident-flow direction relative to the combustion air 115. The ducting of the combustion air 115 into the conical hollow space 114 can be optimized by opening or closing the baffle plates 121a, 121b about a pivot 123 placed in the region of the inlet of this duct into the conical hollow space 114, and this is especially necessary if the original gap size of the tangential air-inlet slots 119, 120 is to be changed dynamically, for example in order to change the velocity of the combustion air 115. These dynamic measures may of course also be provided statically by baffle plates forming as and when required a fixed integral part with the conical sectional bodies 101, 102.<br>
Fig. 5, in comparison with Fig. 4, shows that the swirl generator 100 is now composed of four sectional bodies 130, 131, 132, 133. The associated longitudinal symmetry axes for each sectional body are identified by the letter a. It may be said of this configuration that,  on account of the smaller swirl<br><br>
intensity thus produced, and in interaction with a correspondingly increased slot width, it is best suited to prevent the breakdown of the vortex flow on the outflow side of the swirl generator in the mixing tube, whereby the mixing tube can best fulfill the role intended for it.<br>
Fig. 6 differs from Fig. 5 inasmuch as the sectional bodies 140, 141, 142, 143 here have a blade-profile shape, which is provided for supplying a certain flow. Otherwise, the mode of operation of the swirl generator is the same. The admixing of the fuel 116 with the combustion-air flow 115 is effected from the interior of the blade profiles, i.e. the fuel line 108 is now integrated in the individual blades. Here, too, the longitudinal symmetry axes for the individual sectional bodies are identified by the letter a.<br>
Fig. 7 shows the transition piece 200 in a three-dimensional view. The transition geometry is constructed for a swirl generator 100 having four sectional bodies in accordance with Fig. 5 or 6. Accordingly, the transition geometry has four transition passages 201 as a natural extension of the sectional bodies acting upstream, as a result of which the cone quadrant of the said sectional bodies is extended until it intersects the wall of the mixing tube. The same considerations also apply when the swirl generator is constructed from a principle other than those described under Fig. 3. The surface of the individual transition passages 201 which runs downward in the direction of flow has a form which runs spirally in the direction of flow and describes a crescent-shaped path, in accordance with the fact that in the present case the cross section of flow of the transition piece 200 widens conically in the direction of flow. The swirl angle of the transition passages 201 in the direction of flow is selected in such a way that a sufficiently large section subsequently remains for the tube flow up to the jump in cross section at the combustion-chamber inlet in order to effect perfect<br><br>
premixing with the injected fuel. Furthermore, the axial velocity at the mixing-tube wall downstream of the swirl generator is also increased by the abovementioned measures. The transition geometry and the measures in the region of the mixing tube produce a distinct increase in the axial-velocity profile toward the center of the mixing tube, so that the risk of premature ignition is decisively counteracted.<br>
Fig. 8 shows the breakaway edge already discussed, which is formed at the burner outlet. The cross section of flow of the tube 20 in this region is given a transition radius R, the size of which in principle depends on the flow inside the tube 20. This radius R is selected in such a way that the flow comes into contact with the wall and thus causes the swirl coefficient to increase considerably. Quantitatively, the size of the radius R can be defined in such a way that it is &gt; 10% of the inside diameter d of the tube 20. Compared with a flow without a radius, the backflow bubble 50 is now hugely enlarged. This radius R runs up to the outlet plane of the tube 20, the angle JS between the start and end of the curvature being  3 mm. Of course, the edge running parallel here to the outlet plane of the tube 20 can be brought back to the outlet-plane step again by means of a curved path. The angle S" which extends between the tangent of the breakaway edge A and the perpendicular to the outlet plane of the tube 2 0 is the same size as angle S. The advantages of this design of this breakaway edge can be seen from EP-0 780 629 A2 under the section "SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION". A further configuration of the breakaway edge for the same purpose can be achieved with torus-like notches on the combustion-chamber side.<br>
Obviously,    numerous    modifications    and variations of the present invention are possible in<br><br>
light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that, within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described herein.<br><br>
