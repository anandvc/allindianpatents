The following specification particularly describes the  invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a machine to be used for cleaning and drying of industrial parts. More particularly, this invention relates to universal cleaning machine for removing hydrocarbon contaminates, oil, core sand residue and alike foreign particles from variety of industrial parts with better cleaning performance (minimum Millipore value after completion of cleaning operation).<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Industrial parts cleaning machine(s) have become very popular for cleaning industrial parts so that such parts can be accurately inspected, handled in a sanitary manner and more easily handled during the assembly and reinstallation of parts in different machines. These cleaning machine(s) has maximum cleaning effect of the industrial parts subjected to cleaning operation, which is measured in terms of Millipore<br>
value (i.e. amount of foreign particles available in the industrial part after completion of both cleaning and drying process). The failure to remove debris/ foreign particles from the industrial parts results in poor performance and / or damage to the parts and/or the machines in which the parts are contained after assembly.<br>
The term "Industrial part", means a metallic component that is a part of a machine [main machine] in which it is contained.<br>
To improve cleaning performance (minimum Millipore value) against the conventional (general-purpose dunking type) cleaning machines, manufacturers have developed special-purpose cleaning machine (SPM). These SPM were restricted to the cleaning of specific industrial part design. However, in current scenario major and rapid<br>
engineering changes are occurring in product design . Thus the product design change in short span requires new special purpose cleaning machine and scrapping of the existing machine or renovation. Apart from the above factor the performance delivered by these machines are not to the mark (resulting Millipore value reports more than 10 mg / industrial part) because of various problems like :-<br>
2<br><br>
1.	Cleaning fluid supplied through high-pressure sprayers (nozzles / Jets) to industrial parts itself has Millipore value more that l0mg, which is because of poor filtration and oil skimming performance.<br>
2.	Non-uniform cleaning fluid pressure through high-pressure sprayers (nozzles /jets).<br>
3.	Mismatch between industrial part cleaning surfaces located on part holding fixture and high-pressure sprayers (nozzles / Jets).<br>
4.	Flow pattern of cleaning fluid passing through high-pressure sprayers (nozzles / Jets).<br>
Some of the patent reference in the area of industrial parts cleaning apparatus or machine<br>
are described as follows:<br>
US patent 6,511,550 B1 - 28th June 2003 titled "METHOD FOR CLEANING AND DRYING AN INDUSTRIAL PART" talks about the three steps followed during the cleaning and drying process of cleaning machine. According to this invention industrial part cleaning process comprises of:<br>
1.	Washing the part in a cleaning fluid,<br>
2.	Spinning the part at a speed of 150 to 500 rpm and for 10 to 90 seconds,<br>
3.	Drying the part in a Vacuum, greater than 20 inches of mercury to flush out the possibility of iron based part oxidation due to long term drying of the industrial part and availability of water or cleaning fluid even after completion of cleaning cycle.<br>
Hence the above invention dose not address the requirement of universal cleaning machine for cleaning variety of industrial parts with better cleaning performance i.e. in terms of minimum Millipore value after completion of cleaning operation.<br>
US patent 5,398,708 - 21st March 1995, titled "PARTS CLEANING MACHINE" talk about the common device both for the automatic and manual industrial part washing system. According to this invention a combination device having both types of part washers (Cabinet and Sink type) is develop which can function simultaneously, there by the requirement of the any one part washer in absence of each other is eliminated.<br>
Hence the above invention dose not address the requirement of universal cleaning machine for cleaning different types of industrial parts with better cleaning performance i.e. in terms of minimum Millipore value.<br>
3<br><br>
Therefore, to overcome above mentioned problems pertaining to cleaning of industrial part and the requirement of the cleaning machine as per current product change scenario calls for the design of universal cleaning machine wherein variety of industrial parts can be cleaned with better cleaning performance.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Accordingly it is a primary objective of the present invention to provide universal cleaning machine, which can be used for cleaning variety of industrial parts with better cleaning performance without deviating from the cost factor.<br>
Another further object of the present invention is to provide mechanism for locating various high pressure sprayer (nozzle / jet) manifold(s) and part locating fixtures designed to suit for specific part. The design of manifold(s) is unlike the special purpose cleaning machine, wherein the high pressure sprayer manifold is part of machine, whereas in present invention it is designed like machine fixture, which can be replaced while changeover from one part cleaning to another.<br>
Another further object of the present invention is to provide baffle plates in the high pressure sprayer (nozzle / jet) manifold(s) in "V" or zigzag or alike structure to maintain uniform / constant fluid pressure throughout manifold(s) area.<br>
Another further object of the present invention is to provide multi stage cleaning fluid processing system comprising of Nylon filter (disposal type), Magnetic dust separator, Filtering wire mesh with different sizes and alike, to ensure quality of the cleaning fluid (with minimum Millipore value) supplied through high pressure sprayers.<br>
Another further object of the present invention is to provide disk or alike type oil skimmer in a silent compartment / zone of the dirty cleaning fluid tank for it's maximum oil filtration performance.<br>
Another further object of the present invention to provide nozzles / jets having spiral structure for creating turbulence flow of cleaning fluid to be directed against the article (industrial parts), which gives additional cleaning effect over conventional sprayers used in the cleaning machine.<br>
4<br><br>
Another further object of the present invention is to provide controls for the heating and alike cleaning parameters so that the necessary setting according to different parts design can be carried out.<br>
Other objects and features of this invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art based on the following description taken in combination with the accompanied drawings and can be used individually or in combination of various systems depending upon their requirement and benefits.<br>

Gap of about 6 mm is maintained in between inner and / or outer face (35, 36) and edge of the baffle plates, which facilitate cleaning fluid back-pressure and it's turbulence flow. This gap can be varied depending up on the cleaning fluid volume and pressure supplied to the high-pressure manifold (7) and requirement of the industrial part. Also above arrangement helps in achieving more cleaning fluid pressure at all sprayers (32) with the same high-pressure pump (29) and eliminate necessity of higher capacity pump (29). Hence the design of high pressure manifold(s) (7) is unlike the special purpose machines in which the manifold is the part of cleaning machine, whereas in the<br>
present invention it is designed to be a part of fixtures so that it can be replaced / adjusted depending upon industrial part design.<br>
Quick change couplings (8) or alike arrangement is provided in between inlet pipe(s) (6) and high pressure sprayer manifold (7), which helps in immediate changeover from one cleaning part set up to another by disengaging / engaging manifold and inlet pipe(s) within shortest possible time.<br>
