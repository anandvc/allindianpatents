Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the purification of Piperacillin. This invention also relates to a process for the preparation of Piperacillin of formula (I).<br><br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Piperacillin is a beta-lactam antibiotic and is mainly bactericidal. It inhibits the third and final stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis by preferentially binding to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) that are located inside the bacterial cell wall. Piperacillin sodium is widely admixered in combinations with tazobactam sodium. Tazobactam protects piperacillin against Richmond and Sykes types II, III, IV, and V beta-lactamases; staphylococcal penicillinase; and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. Tazobactam enhances and extends the antibiotic spectrum of piperacillin to include beta-lactamase producing bacteria normally resistant to piperacillin.<br>
The chemical name of piperacillin sodium is sodium (2S, 5R, 6R)-6-[(R)-2-(4-ethyl-2,3-dioxo-l- piperazinecarboxamido)-2- phenylacetamido]-3,-3-dimethyl- 7-oxo-4-thia~l-azabicyclo [3.2.0]heptane-2-carboxylate.<br><br>
US patent 4,112,090 claims Piperacillin and its pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts. This patent also disclose various processes for the preparation Piperacillin.<br>
US patent 4,477,452 claims a process for freeze-drying an aqueous solution of sodium piperacillin, by evaporating a frozen aqueous solution of sodium piperacillin under vacuum from the frozen state to dryness.<br>
US patent 6,828,438 a process for the preparation of sodium salt of 6[D-(-)a-4-(ethyl-2,3-dioxo-l-piperazinocarbonylamino) phenylacetamido]penicillanic acid (Piperacillin). The process involves reaction of the Piperacillin with a reagent selected from the group consisting of sodium hydroxide, sodium carboxylates and sodium alcoholates, followed by a separation of the so obtained sodium salt by precipitation.<br>
Most of the literature reported process for the preparation of Piperacillin sodium involves either crystallization using organic solvent or lyohilisation. One of the major problems associated in crystallization method is the product obtained has higher residual solvent. The lyohilisation technique involves initial dissolution of Piperacillin or Piperacillin monohydrate in aqueous medium, followed by freeze-drying. The drawback associated with in this process is Piperacillin monohydrate obtained by prior art process has poor solubility in aqueous medium and has higher residual solvent, hence makes the process difficult; Because of these drawbacks there is a need to develop a purification process required for Piperacillin or Piperacillin monohydrate.<br>
In view of importance of Piperacillin sodium, we have found a process for the preparation of Piperacillin monohydrate that has higher solubility in<br><br>
aqueous medium and meets residual solvent content as per ICH guidelines and meets the requirements of USP.<br>
Objectives of the Invention<br>
The main objective of the present invention provides an improved process for the purification Piperacillin monohydrate of formula (I), which has better solubility in aqueous medium.<br>
Another objective of the present invention also provides a process for the preparation of Piperacillin monohydrate of formula (I).<br>

(i) disoloving Piperacillin of formula (I) using a solvent consisting of methanol, water and ethyl acetate in the presence or absence of base, and<br>
(i)       precipitating Piperacillin (I) or its hydrates.<br>

The present invention is illustrated with the following examples, which should not be construed for limiting the scope of the invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of Piperacillin (I):<br><br>
R- (-)-a-[[(4-Ethyl-2, 3-dioxo-l-piperazinyl) carbonyl] amino] benzene acetic acid (156.3 gm) was dissolved in Dichloromethane (500 ml) and N, N Dimethyl acetamide (250 mL). To the resultant solution phosphoryl chloride (79gm) was added at -20°C and stirred for one hour. The reaction mixture was cooled to -45°C. To this mixture, previously prepared solution of 6APA Diethylamine salt soltion (Prepared by treating Diethyl amine (37.2 gm) with 6-APA (100 gm) at 20-30 °C in 500 mL Dichloromethane) was added at -43 to -45°C in 30 min. The resultant solution was stirred till completion of reaction. After completion of reaction water was added to the reaction mixture and stirred at 0°C. The layers obtained was separated and pH of organic layer (MDC) was adjusted pH 6.2 - 6.5 using 5.7 % aqueous solution of sodium bicarbonate (1500 mL) at 10-15°C. Layers again were separated and to aqueous layer Ethyl acetate was added. The pH of resultant solution adjusted to pH 2.0- 2.2 at 10 - 15°C using 18 % HC1. The precipitate obtained filtered and dried to yield Piperacillin Acid (240 gm)<br>
