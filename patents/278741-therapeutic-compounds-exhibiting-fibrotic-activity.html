together with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, carrier or excipient.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition for the treatment of a disease or condition characterised by inflammation and/or benign or malignant neoplastic disease, including a compound of the Formula 3, as set out above.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, carrier or excipient may be selected from any suitable carrier or excipient known in the art.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition may be formulated In any suitable form, including, but not limited to, formulations for oral, injectable, rectal, parenteral, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular or other delivery. The pharmaceutical composition may be formulated In any suitable form, including, but not limited to tablet, capsule, capiet, injectable, ampoule, vial, ready-to-use solution, lyophilised material, suppository, bolus or implant form.<br>
The formulation of such compositions is well known to persons skilled in the art. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and/or diluents include any and all conventional solvents, dispersion media, fillers, solid carriers, aqueous solutions, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active substances is well known in the art, and it is described, by way of example, in Remington's Pliarmaceutical Sciences, 18th Edition, IVlack Publishing Company, Pennsylvania, USA.<br>
 <br>
Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the terminal groups of the dendrimer polymer described herein, use thereof in the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention is contemplated. Supplementary active ingredients may also be incorporated Into the compositions.<br>
It is especially advantageous to formulate compositions in unit dosage form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. "Unit dosage form" as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the human subjects to be treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical earner and/or diluent. The specifications for the novel dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by and directly dependent on (a) the unique characteristics of the active ingredient and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and (b) the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an active ingredient for the particular treatment.<br>
In yet another aspect of the present invention there is provided use of an effective amount of a compound as described above in the prophylactic or therapeutic treatment of, or in the manufacture of a medicament for treatment of, a human or non-human animal patient.<br>
In a still further aspect of the present invention there is provided a method for the treatment of a disease indicator or physiological deficiency in a mammalian, including human, patient, which method includes administering to a patient requiring such treatment a prophylactically or therapeutically effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition, as described above.<br>
A variety of administration routes are available. The particular mode selected will depend, of course, upon the particular condition being treated and the dosage required for therapeutic efficacy. The methods of this invention, generally speal<ing may be practised using any mode of administration that is medically acceptable meaning produces therapeutic levels the active component invention without causing clinically unacceptable adverse effects. such modes include but are not limited to oral rectal topical nasal inhalation transdermal or parenteral></ing>
 <br>
(e.g. subcutaneous, intramuscular and intravenous), intraocular and intravitreal (ie, into the eye's vitreous) routes. Formulations for oral administration include, but are not limited to, discrete units such as capsules, tablets, lozenges and the like. Other routes include, but are not limited to, intrathecal administration directly into spinal fluid, direct introduction such as by various catheter and balloon angioplasty devices well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, and intraparenchymal injection into targeted areas.<br>
The compositions may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Such methods include, but are not limited to, the step of bringing the active compound Into association with a carrier, which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing the active compound into association with a liquid carrier, a finely divided solid carrier, or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.<br>
Compositions of the present invention suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets, tablets or lozenges, each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient, in liposomes or as a suspension in an aqueous liquor or non-aqueous liquid such as a syrup, an elixir, or an emulsion.<br>
Compositions suitable for parenteral administration conveniently comprise a sterile aqueous preparation of the active component which is preferably isotonic with the blood of the recipient. This aqueous preparation may be formulated according to known methods using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non¬toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in polyethylene glycol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, and Isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose, any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono-or dl-glycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables<br>
The compound of the present invention may also be formulated for delivery in a system<br>
 <br>
designed to administer the compound intranasally or by inhalation, for example as a finely dispersed aerosol spray containing the active component.<br>
Other delivery systems may include sustained release delivery systems. Preferred sustained release delivery systems are those which may provide for release of the compound of the present invention in sustained release pellets or capsules. Many types of sustained release delivery systems are available. These include, but are not limited to: (a) erosional systems in which the active component is contained within a matrix, and (b) diffusional systems in which the active component permeates at a controlled rate through a polymer. In addition, a pump-based hardware delivery system may be used, some of which are adapted for implantation.<br>
The compound of the present invention is administered in prophylactically or therapeutically effective amounts, A prophylactically or therapeutically effective amount means that amount necessary to at least partly attain the desired effect, or to delay the onset of, inhibit the progression of, or halt altogether, the onset or progression of the particular condition being treated. Such amounts will depend, of course, on the particular condition being treated, the severity of the condition and individual patient parameters including age, physical condition, size, weight and concurrent treatment. These factors are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art and may be addressed with no more than routine experimentation. It is preferred generally that a maximum dose be used, that is, the highest safe dose according to sound medical judgement. It will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art, however, that a lower dose or tolerable dose may be administered for medical reasons, psychological reasons or for virtually any other reasons.<br>
Generally, daily doses of the compound may be from about 0.01 mg/kg per day to 1000 mg/kg per day. Small doses (0.01-1 mg/kg per day) may be administered initially, followed by increasing doses up to about 1000 mg/kg per day. In the event that the response in a subject is insufficient at such doses, even higher doses (or effective higher doses by a different, more localised delivery route) may be employed to the extent patient tolerance permits. Multiple doses per day are contemplated to achieve appropriate systemic levels of compounds.<br>
 <br>
In a further preferred embodiment, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients may be selected from one or more of sterile aqueous salt solutions, suspensions and emulsions, including saline and buffered media, Ringer's dextrose, dextrose and sodium chloride, and lactated Ringer's solution. Intravenous vehicles include fluid and nutrient replenishers, electrolyte replenishers, such as those based on Ringer's dextrose, and the like. For administration by non-intravenous routes, the carrier can be in the form of clotted plasma, preferably the patient's clotted plasma. Alternatively the carrier can be a plasma-free, physiologically compatible, biodegradable solid or semi-solid, such as a gel, suspension or water soluble jelly. Acacia, methylcellulose and other cellulose derivatives, sodium alginate and tragacanth suspensions or gels are suitable for use as carriers in the practice of this invention, for example, sodium carboxymethylcellulose 2.5%, tragacanth 1.25% and guar gum 0.5%.<br>

The term "kidney disease", as used herein, refers to a disorder of at least one kidney in a subject that compromises the function of the kidney. The kidney disease may result from a primary pathology of the kidney (e.g., injury to the glomerulus or tubule), or another organ (e.g., pancreas) which adversely affects the ability of the kidney to perform biological functions. A kidney disease in the human can be the direct or indirect effect of disease. Examples of a kidney disease as a result or consequence of an indirect effect on the kidneys Is kidney disease as a consequence of diabetes or systemic lupus. A kidney disease may be the result or a consequence of any change, damage, or trauma to the glomerulus, tubules or interstitial tissue in either the renal cortex or renal medulla of the kidney.<br>
The term "kidney disease" as used herein refers to a progressive kidney disease that<br>
 <br>
overtime (e.g., days, weeks, months, years) leads to a loss of renal function.<br>
The kidney disease may include, but Is not limited to, a progressive glomerular kidney disease including without limitation diabetic nephropathy (e.g., as a consequence of Type I or Type II diabetes or systemic lupus), primary glomerulonephritis (e.g., membranous nephropathy, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis, membranous focal segmental glomerulosclerosis) or secondary glomerulonephritis (e.g., diabetic nephropathy, ischemic nephropathy).<br>
The term "renal function" as used herein refers to a physiological property of the kidney, such as the ability to retain protein thereby preventing proteinuria. Renal function can be assessed using methods known in the art such as determining one or more of glomerular filtration rate (e.g., creatinine clearance), excretion of protein in urine, blood urea nitrogen, and serum or plasma creatinine.<br>
A progressive kidney disease treated by the compositions and methods described herein includes any kidney disease that can, ultimately, lead to end-stage renal disease. A progressive kidney disease that can be treated by the compositions and methods of the invention can be, for example, associated with endogenous iron deposit in the kidney (e.g., glomerulus, tubules).<br>
Diabetic cardiomyopathy refers to any one or more cardiac pathology and/or dysfunction in a subject, which is a complication of either Type I or Type II diabetes in the subject. The diabetes may be symptomatic or asymptomatic. Cardiac pathology which is characteristic of diabetic cardiomyopathy includes myocellular hypertrophy, myocardial fibrosis, and in some cases left ventricular hypertrophy. The pathologies which are contemplated arise Independently from complications arising from coronary artery disease, although both diabetic complications and coronary artery complications may be present in the same subject. Diastolic dysfunction, such as an impairment in early diastolic filling, a prolongation of isovolumetric relaxation and increased atrial filling is also characteristic of diabetic cardiomyopathy, and may be identified using Doppler methods such as Doppler 2-dimensional echocardiography (for example Bedford MM et<br>
 <br>
a/., "Burden of systolic and diastolic dysfunction in tiie community". JAIVIA (2003) 289:194-203) or radionuclide imaging for early or mild dysfunction and by standard echocardiograph testing for more severe dysfunction.<br>
Cardiac fibrosis refers to tlie formation of fibrous tissue, including cellular and extracellular components, in the lining and muscle of the heart. If present in sufficient quantities, the fibrous tissue will result in a decrease in the contractility and/or relaxation of one or more regions of the heart, resulting in functional deficit in cardiac output.<br>

EXAMPLES Example 1<br>
General description of synthetic chemistry<br>
Two general approaches were used for the synthesis of various substituted cinnamoyi anthranilates. In the first approach via a piperidine-catalyzed Knoevenagel condensation of a carboxyacetamidobenzoic acid and a benzaidehyde derivative thereof to provide a substituted cinnamoyi anthranilate as a piperidinium salt followed by acidification and recrystallization to produce a cinnamoyi anthranilate as the free acid providing an A/-cinnamoyl-4-aminobenzoic acid via the following synthesis.<br>
 <br>
In the second approach, converting a substituted cinnamic acid to the corresponding acid chloride and condensing with a 2-aminobenzamide, or aniline.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
The benzaldehyde precursors required for the above reactions were either obtained from commercial sources, or were synthesized by alkylation of precursor phenolic benzaldehydes with assorted alkyl halides or alkyl tosylates (derived in turn from the corresponding alcohols). Alkylations were typically performed using potassium carbonate as base in acetone. Carboxyacetamidobenzoic acids were obtained by the condensation of various anthranilic acid derivatives with Meldrum's acid. 2-Aminobenzamides were synthesized by the reaction of primary amines with isatoic anhydride. Saturation of the internal alkene of tranilast was performed by reduction with hydrogen in the presence of palladium on carbon catalyst. Cinnamic acids were prepared by Knoevenagel condensation of benzaldehydes with malonic acid. Formation of triazole substituted derivatives was performed using copper(l) catalyzed condensation of azides and terminal aikynes and provides only the 1,4-regioisomer.<br>
Experimental<br>
High resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were obtained using on a Finnigan hybrid linear quadrupole ion trap-Fourier transform (LTQ-FT) mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron, San Jose, CA) equipped with an electrospray ionization source. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) and proton decoupled carbon nuclear magnetic resonance (13C NMR) spectra were obtained on Unity 400, Innova 400 and Innova 500 instruments (Melbourne, Australia) operating at 400 MHz and 500 MHz for 1H and at<br>
 <br>
100 MHz and 125 MHz for 13C, All signals were referenced to solvent peaks (CDCI3: 7.26 ppm for 1H and 77.0 ppm for 13C; DMSO-d6: 2.49 ppm for 'H and 39.5 ppm for 13C). Infrared (IR) spectra were obtained using a PerkinElmer Spectrum One FT-IR spectrometer with zinc selenide/diamond Universal ATR Sampling Accessory. Melting points were obtained using a Reichert-Jung Inot stage apparatus and are corrected. Analytical thin layer chromatography (TLC) was conducted on 2 mm thick silica gel GF254 (Merck). Compounds were visualised with solutions of 20% w/w phosphomolybdic acid in ethanol, 20% w/w potassium permanganate in water, or under UV (365 nm). Flash chromatography was performed according to the method of Still et al. [20] with Merck Silica Gel 60. Petrol refers to the fraction boiling at 40-60 °C. All other reagents were used as received.<br>
Procedure 1<br>
Anthranilic acid (1.1 eq.) was added to a solution of Meldrum's acid (1.0 eq.) in toluene. The reaction flask was fitted with a Dean-Stark apparatus and the suspension was heated to reflux for 3 h. The suspension was cooled, and the precipitate collected by filtration, washed with toluene and dried.<br>
Procedure 2<br>
Piperidine (1.1 eq.) was added to a suspension of an aldehyde (1.1 eq.) and diacid (1.0 eq.) in toluene. The reaction flask was fitted with a Dean-Stark apparatus and heated to reflux for 4 h, cooled to rt and stirred for 1 h. The resulting suspension was filtered, and the filter cake was washed with toluene to afford the piperidinium salt. The piperidinium salt was dissolved in MeOH (5 mL/g) and water (2 mL per/g) at 40 °C. The solution was acidified and the resulting precipitate was collected by filtration.<br>
Procedure 3<br>
Propargyl bromide (1.1-1.5 eq.) was added to a suspension of the phenol (1.0 eq.) and potassium carbonate (2.0 eq.) in acetone. The suspension was heated to reflux for 16 h and then the suspension was filtered, using acetone to rinse the filter cake. The filtrate<br>
 <br>
was concentrated under reduced pressure, and water was added to the residue and the aqueous phase was extracted with EtOAc. The organic extract was washed with water, brine, dried and concentrated.<br>
Procedure 4<br>
i 4-l\/lethylbenzenesulfonyl chloride (1.5 eq.) was added to a cooled solution of alcohol (1.0 eq.) and pyridine (2.0 eq.) in CH2CI2 at 0 °C. The solution was stirred at 0 °C for 1 h, warmed to rt and stirred for 4 h. Water was added and the aqueous phase was extracted with ether. The organic extract was washed with 1 IVI HCI, saturated aqueous NaHCO3 , water, brine and dried. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the crude product was purified by flash chromatography, to afford the methylbenzenesulfonate, The methylbenzenesulfonate (1.5 eq.) was added to a suspension of phenol (1.0 eq.), potassium carbonate (3.0 eq.) and sodium iodide (0.1 eq.) in acetonitrile. The suspension was heated to reflux for 16 h, filtered, and the filter cake rinsed with acetonitrile. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure.

Cell culture studies - transforming growth factor-;? stimulation<br>
The anti-fibrotic effects of 3-inethQxy-4-propargyloxybenzaldehyde (FT011) in a renal cell line were tested by measuring proline incorporation after transforming growth factor-p stimulation.<br>
A well-characterized cloned mesangial cell line (1097) isolated from Sprague-Dawley rats [30] was used between passages 30 and 40. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's (DME) medium (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) with heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100u/mL penicillin and 100ug/mL streptomycin in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37°C.<br>
To compare the effects of tranllast and FT011 on collagen production in vitro, incorporation of tritiated proline was used [40]. Mesangial cells were plated at low<br>
 <br>
density into 24-well culture plates in DME/5%FBS and allowed to adhere overnight. The subconfluent cells were starved overnight in DME/0.5%FBS and 150mM L-ascorbic add (Sigma-Aldrich). Tranilast or FT011 was then added to the wells, followed 4 hours later by L-[2,3,4,5-^H]-proline. 0.5μCi/well (Amersham) and TGF-β  5ng/ml (R&amp;D systems). Mesangial cells were harvested 48 hours post-stimulation, washed three times with ice cold PBS, and incubated with 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) for 30 minutes on ice, followed by a wash in ice cold 10% TCA. Cells were then solubilised in 750ml 1M NaOH. Scintillation counting was performed on 500mL aliquots of solubilized cells neutralized with 500mL of 1M HCI in lOmL of Instagel Plus scintillant (Perl<in-elmer boston ma></in-elmer>
The data shown in Figures 1 and 2 suggest that in renal mesangial cells, both tranilast and FT011 significantly reduce proline incorporation from 30 to lOOfjM. The degree of proline incorporation in vitro relates to the degree on fibrosis in vivo.<br>
Example 3<br>
Matrix synthesis may be stimulated by platelet derived growth factor (PDGF). Accordingly, mesangial cells incubated with PDGF will demonstrate proline incorporation, which is an indicator of matrix synthesis and thereby a model for fibrosis.<br>
In order to assess the effect of FT011 on PDGF stimulated matrix synthesis, mesangial cells (prepared as described in Example 2) were incubated with FT011 or tranilast in the presence of PDGF. The results of this analysis were provided in Figure 3. As shown in Figure 3, FT011 inhibits PDGF-stimulated matrix synthesis (shown by reduced proline incorporation) at 30 and 100 //M concentrations. At 30  concentrations, FT011 is more potent at reducing proline incorporation than tranilast.<br>
Example 4<br>
Matrix synthesis may be stimulated by both angiotensin II or transforming growth factor beta (TGF-/?). Accordingly, neonatal cardiac fibroblasts incubated with angiotensin II or TGF-β  will demonstrate proline incorporation, which is an indicator of matrix synthesis and thereby a model for fibrosis.<br>
 <br>
Neonatal SD rat cardiac fibroblasts (NCFs) were isolated from one-day-old pups with enzymatic digestion. NCFs were purified by percoll gradient and seeded with DI\/1EIVI in the present of 1% antibiotic/antimycotic (AB/AM) and 10% fatal bovine serum (FBS). NCFs were then subcultured when they are about 80% confluence. The second    passage of NCFs was used for the assays.<br>
NCFs were seeded at 25,000 cells/well in 12-well plates and incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2 overnight in DMEM with 1% AB/AM and 10% FBS. Cells were then washed with DMEM and then the media replaced with DMEM/F12 with 1%AB/AM, 0.5% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) and Vitamin C, before being incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 24 hours.<br>
The effect of FT011 on TGF-β - or angiotensin ll-stimulated fibrosis in the neonatal SD rat cardiac fibroblasts was investigated. As shown in Figure 4, FT011 inhibited TGF-y?-stimulated fibrosis (indicated by proline incorporation) in rat neonatal cardiac fibroblasts. As shown in Figure 3, FT011 inhibited angiotensin ll-stimulated fibrosis (indicated by proline incorporation) in neonatal cardiac fibroblasts.<br>

Methodology<br>
Proline Incorporation:<br>
A well-characterized cloned rat mesanglal cell line [30] (gift of D Nikolic-Patterson) is cultured in DMEM with FBS, 100U/mL penicillin, and 100ug/mL streptomycin in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37°C. Cells are plated into 24-well culture dishes in DMEM/10%FBS at low density and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells are used between passages 20 and 40. The subconfluent cells are starved overnight in DMEM/0.1%FBS containing 150uM L-ascorbic acid, prior to 4 hours of pre-treatment with or without tranilast or the FT compounds, followed by the addition of 5ng/mL<br>
 <br>
rhTGF-;ffi1 (R&amp;D Systems) and 1uCi7mL of L-(2,3,4,5-^H)-proline. Control wells have the compounds but no TGF-^i added. Cells are incubated for a further 44 hours during which time their appearance is visually monitored. The cells are then washed three times in ice-cold PBS, twice in ice cold 10% TCA and solubilized in 750uL MA NaOH for 45 minutes at 37°C or overnight at 4°C. A 500uL aliquot is neutralized with 500uL 1M HCI and lOmL scintillation fluid (Instagel Plus - Perkin-Elmer) added. Counts are performed on a beta counter.<br>
To normalize the proline incorporation counts to take into account the proliferative effects of TGF-/?i, a BioRad protein assay is performed on a 100-150uL aliquot of the remaining solubilized cells. The sample is neutralized with an equal amount of 1M HCI prior to the assay. The BSA standards used to construct the standard curve have the same amount of 1M NaOH and 1M HCI added as is present in the samples for assay.<br>
Proline incorporation is expressed as cpm/ug protein. In order to compare inter-assay results, the incorporation is expressed as percentage reduction of TGF stimulated proline incorporation, where TGF alone gives 0% reduction and the zero control gives 100% reduction.<br>
MTT Assay:<br>
Mesangial cells are plated at 15000 cells per well into 96-well culture dishes in DMEM/10%FBS and allowed to adhere overnight. The subconfluent cells are stan/ed overnight in DMEM/0.1%FBS, prior to 4 hours of pre-treatment with or without tranilast or the FT compounds. Following the addition of 5ng/mL rhTGF-^ffi, the ceils are incubated in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37°C for 44 hours. Control wells have the compounds but no TGF-iffi added. The culture medium is removed from each well and lOOuL MTT (0.5mg/mL ) in starve medium is added to each well. The plates are incubated for a further 4 hours at 37X. The culture medium is then removed and replaced with 10O^L isopropanol and incubated at 37'C for 20 to 30 minutes, until the blue formazan crystals have dissolved. The absorbance is measured at a wavelength of 570nm with background subtraction of 690nm.<br>

Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and fibroblast cultures<br>
Neonatal SD rat cardiac myocytes (NCMs) and fibroblasts (NCFs) were isolated from one-day-old pups with enzymatic digestion as described in detail previously [20,21]. NCFs were seeded and maintained in high-glucose (25mmol/L) Dulbecco's modified<br>
 <br>
Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen Mount Waverley, Vic, Australia) in the presence of 1% antibiotic/antimycotic (AB/AM) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (JRH biosciences, Kansas, USA). NCFs were used at passage 2 [31]. Purified NCMs were seeded (1000 cells/mm^) In 6-well plates and then maintained in serum-free DMEM (Invitrogen, NY, USA) supplemented with insulin and transferrin as described previously (4). Bromodeoxyuridlne was included for the first 3 days. 50 mmol/L KCI was added to the medium to prevent spontaneous contraction characteristic of the plated NCMs [32].<br>
Measurement of neonatal rat cardiomyocyte hypertrophy<br>
NCM hypertrophy studies were performed as previously described [Please provide details of this reference] [22]. Four hours after treatment with the compounds (concentrations various from 1 to 30 iJ.M), ANG II (10"'^ mol/L) was used to stimulate hypertrophy. After 60 hours of stimulation, cells were harvested and hypertrophy defined as a significant increase in protein content (Bradford assay) in the absence of any significant change in DNA content (Burton assay) [33].<br>
Measurement of collagen synthesis and proliferation and cell viability in neonatal rat cardiac fibroblasts<br>
NCFs collagen synthesis assays were performed as described previously [31]. Briefly, NCFs plated at a density of 50,000 cells/ well in 12-weIl plate and incubated overnight. NCFs were then serum starved for 24 hours in high-glucose DMEM. The cells were then preincubated for 30 min in the presence or absence of compounds (1 to 30|aM) in fresh DMEM/F12 before stimulation with 2x10-'° mol/L of TGF-;ei or 10'^mol/L of ANG II.<br>
For collagen synthesis, IfiCi of [^H]-Proline was added to each well and incubated for further 48 hours before harvest. Cells were harvested by precipitation with 10% TCA on ice for 30 min, before solubilisation with 0,75mL of 1 mol/L NaOH overnight at 4°C. The samples were then neutralized with 1 mol/L HCI and ^H level were counted with 10 ml scintillation fluid on a beta-counter to determine [^H]-proline incorporation.<br>
For proliferation studies, NCFs were treated with 1 mCl of [^H]-thymidine added to each<br>

Animals<br>
The animal studies were conducted with the approval of the Animal Welfare and Ethics Committee of the St Vincent's Hospital and the National Health and Medical Research Foundation of Australia. All rats received normal rat chow (Certified Rodent Diet #5002, LabDiet, USA) and drinking water ad libitum. All animals were housed in a stable environment maintained at 22 ± 1° C with a 12-hour light/dark cycle commencing at 6am.<br>
Pilot study (toxicity assessment)<br>
A total of twenty male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats weighing 200-250g were randomised to either FT011 (Fibrotech Therapeutics Pty Ltd, Melbourne, Australia) or Tranilast (Pharm Chemical, Shanghai Lansheng Corporation, China) at the dose of 50mg, 100mg, 200mg and 400mg/kg/day by gavage twice daily (n=2-3 per group). A control group of animals were gavaged with vehicle (1% carboxy methyl cellulose). The study was conducted for 2 weeks. Animals were bled daily at one, four, and eight hours after oral gavage to measure the plasma concentration. Serum was also collected to assess renal and liver function at the end of the study (plasma creatine and urate, ALT and bilirubin). Rats were individually housed in metabolic cages at the end of the study, habituated for 2 to 3 hours, and urine collected over 24 hours. Animals continued to have free access to tap water and standard laboratory chow during this period. The biochemistry tests performed at the department of pathology, St Vincent's hospital. Major organs including lung, heart, liver, spleen and kidney were harvested and<br>
 <br>
immersed fix with 10% neutral buffered formalin and then embedded paraffin for subsequent light microscope examination.<br>
Myocardial infarct rats<br>
Forty male SD rats weighing 200-250g were randomised to two groups of 20 animals that each undenA/ent surgery. Anaesthesia was achieved with 3% isoflurane/97% oxygen in a tidal volume of 1 ml/IOOg body weight, at a rate of 72 breaths/minute. Twenty rats underwent ligation of left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) to Induce anterior myocardial infarction (Ml). Briefly, surgery performed under aseptic conditions on a heated table (SyC) to maintain body wamnth during the course of the procedure. The chest swabbed with chlorhexidine in 70% ethanol to disinfect the area. An incision made into the skin to the left of the sternum and the underlying muscle layers blunt dissected. A thoracotomy performed through the fourth to fifth intercostal space and the ribs held open using retractors to enable access to the heart. The pericardial sac surrounding the heart torn open and a 6-0 prolene suture used to ligate the LAD immediately. Visible blanching and hypokinesis of the anterior wall of the left ventricle and swelling of the left atrium are indicative of successful ligation. The control groups (sham + vehicle, sham + FT011) underwent a sham operation consisting of the same procedure except that the suture passed through the myocardium beneath the LAD without ligation [34].<br>
Echocardiography was performed on all animals 2 days post surgery and randomised to sham and Ml groups. Animals were re-randomised at day 7 post surgery (10 animal each) to receive: vehicle or FT011 (lOOmg/kg bid gavage). Every week, systolic blood pressure (SBP) was detennined in preheated conscious rats via tail-cuff plethysmography using a non-Invasive blood pressure (NIBP) controller and Powerlab (AD instruments, NSW, Australia). Cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography and cardiac catherization prior to sacrificing at day 35 post surgery for all animals [34].<br>
Diabetic (mRen-2)27 rats<br>
Forty six-week old female, heterozygous (mRen-2)27 rats (St. Vincent's Hospital Animal<br>
 <br>
House, Melbourne, Australia) were assigned to receive either 55 mg/kg of STZ (Sigma, St. Louis, USA) diluted in 0.1 M citrate buffer, pH 4.5 or citrate buffer alone (non-diabetic) by tail vein injection following an overnight fast. Control and diabetic groups were then each randomised into 2 groups (n=10), receiving either treatment with: the FT 011 (lOOmg/kg bid gavage, Fibrotech Therapeutics Pty Ltd, Melbourne, Australia), or no treatment for 16 weeks. Treatment commenced within 24 hours of STZ or citrate buffer injection. Each week, rats were weighed and their blood glucose levels were measured (Accu-check Advantage II Blood Glucose Monitor, Roche Diagnostics, USA) and only STZ-treated animals with blood glucose &gt;15 mmol/L were considered diabetic. Every 4 weeks, systolic blood pressure (SBP) was determined in preheated conscious rats via tail-cuff plethysmography using a non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) controller and Powerlab (AD instruments, NSW, Australia). Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was measured by HPLC at the end of the study. Diabetic rats received a daily injection of insulin (2-4 units intraperitoneally; Humulin NPH, Eli Lilly and Co., Indianapolis, IN) to reduce mortality and to promote weight gain [37, 39].<br>
Heart function<br>
Echocardiography<br>
Echocardiography, including Doppler examination, was performed using a Vivid 7 Dimension (GE Vingmed, Horten, Norway) echocardiograph with a 10 MHz phased array probe. Electrocardiographic data were acquired simultaneously. End-diastole was defined as the peak of the R wave, and end-systole was defined as the end of the T wave.<br>
Animals were anaesthetized with pentobarbitone sodium 60mg/kg i.p. injection. Animals undenA/ent echocardiographic interrogation in the left recumbent position. M-mode echocardiography was performed using a parasternal short axis view at the level of the papillary muscles. Left ventricular posterior (LVPW) and anterior wall thickness (LVAW) were obtained during diastole (d) and systole (s), as were the left ventricular internal diameter at end-diastole (LVIDd) and end-systole (LVIDs). From the para-sternal short axis view, the end diastolic and end systolic cross sectional blood pool areas were<br>
 <br>
measured. Fractional area change (FAC) was then calculated according to the formulae:<br>
FAC = [(end-dlastolic area-end-systolic area)/end-diastolic areaflOO.<br>
The apical 4-chamber view was used to assess early and late transmitral peak diastolic flow velocity (E and A waves), using pulsed wave Doppler with a sample volume of 2 mm placed at the tips of the mitral valve leaflets. All Doppler spectra were recorded for 10 cardiac cycles at a sweep speed of 200 mm/s. All parameters were assessed using an average of three beats, and calculations were made in accordance with the American Society of Echocardiography guidelines [41]. All data were acquired and analyzed by a single blinded observer using EchoPAC (GE Vingmed) offline processing.<br>
Cardiac catheterization<br>
Post echocardiography, animals were placed on a warming pad (37°C), intubated using a 14 gauge catheter, and ventilated using positive pressure with a tidal volume of 10% body weight at 70 breaths per minute using room air. Animals were secured in a recumbent position and the right jugular vein was cannulated with 0.9% NaCI infused at 100 pL per hour. Pressure was calibrated after wamning the catheter (Model SPR-838 Millar instruments, Houston, TX) in 0.9% NaCI at in ST^C for 30 minutes. The right internal carotid was then identified and ligated cranially. A 2F miniaturized combined conductance catheter-micromanometer was Inserted into the carotid artery to obtain aortic blood pressure, then advanced into the left ventricle until stable pressure volume (PV) loops were obtained. The abdomen was then opened and the inferior vena cava and portal vein identified. Elastic bands were placed around these vessels to allow rapid reduction in cardiac preload. All loops were obtained with the ventilator turned off for 6-10 seconds and the animal apnoeic.<br>
Using the pressure conductance data, functional parameters were then calculated (Millar analysis software PVAN 3.4). These Included the slope of the end diastolic pressure volume relationship (EDPVR) and the slope of the preload recruitable stroke work relationship (PRSW), defined as the relationship between stroke work and end<br>
 <br>
diastolic volume, where stroke work is the pressure-volume loop area for each beat. Renal Function<br>
Rats were individually housed in metabolic cages at 4, 8 12 and 16 weeks, habituated for 2 to 3 hours, and urine collected over 24 hours. Animals continued to have free access to tap water and standard laboratory chow during this period. After 24 hours in metabolic cages, an aliquot of urine (5 mL) was collected from the 24-hour urine sample and stored at -70°C for subsequent analysis of albumin by radio-immunoassay, as previously performed [36]. Prior to sacrifice, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was determined by injecting a single shot of 99Tc-DTPA into the tail vein and sampling the blood after 43 minutes, as previously described [37].<br>
Tissue Preparation<br>
Rats were anaesthetised (Nembutal 60 mg/kg body wt l.p. Boehringer-Ingelheim, Australia). Lungs, left ventricle (LV), right ventricle (RV) and atria were separated, blotted dry once and weighed, the LV was then sectioned immediately and tissue was either frozen fresh, stored frozen in OCT or fixed in neutral buffered formalin. Kidneys were excised, decapsulated, sliced transversely, half of the kidney snap frozen for tissue RNA assay and other half immersed fix with formalin and paraffin-embedded for subsequent light microscopic evaluation.<br>
Histopathology and Immunohistochemistry<br>
Histopathological changes in kidney and heart were assessed in a masked protocol. Sections were stained with either haematoxylin and eosin (H &amp; E), periodic acid Schiff's stain (PAS), picrosirius red and/or Masson's modified trichrome to demonstrate collagenous matrix.<br>
Infarct size<br>
The picrosirius red stained slides of heart: were examined under light microscopy and<br>

To examine extracellular matrix deposition in heart sections were stained with picrosirius red and the accumulation of matrix within the non-infarct zone (NIZ) was then quantified using a modification of the technique described by La! et al. (Lai et al., 2004) with a blinded manner. Briefly, 5 random stained sections from the mid left ventricle were digitally captured and then loaded onto a Pentium III IBM computer. To isolate the NIZ from the infarct and the peri-infarct zone, the infarct and a 2 mm zone on either side of it were excluded. To assess the tubulointerstitial fibrosis in kidney sections were stained with modified Masson's trichrome. Briefly, 5 random non-overlapping fields from 10 rats per group were captured and digitised using a BX50 microscope attached to a Fujix HC5000 digital camera. Digital images were then loaded onto a Pentium III IBM computer as described as above. An area of red in heart and blue in kidney on<br>
 <br>
picrosirius red and trichrome-stained section, respectively, were selected for its color range and the proportional area of tissue with this range of color was then quantified. Calculation of the proportional area stained red and blue (matrix) was then determined using image analysis (AIS, Analytical imaging Station Version 6.0, Ontario, Canada) [37, 39].<br>
Immunohistochemistry<br>
Collagen subtypes I and III<br>
Collagen subtypes I and III were assessed in the heart using goat and mouse anti-Collagen I (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc. Birmingham, AL 35226 USA) and III antibody (Biogenex, San Ramon Cal, 94583 USA). In brief, four micron sections were placed into histosol to remove the paraffin wax, re-hydrated in graded ethanol, and immersed into tap water before being incubated for 20 minutes with normal goat serum (NGS) diluted 1:10 with O.lmol/L PBS, pH 7.4. Sections were incubated respective primary antibodies overnight (18 hours) at 4°C. The following day the sections were thoroughly washed in PBS (3x5 minute changes), incubated with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes to block endogenous peroxide, then rinsed with PBS (2x5 min), and incubated with either blotinylated swine anti-goat or goat anti mouse IgG antibody (DAKO, Carpinteria CA), diluted 1:200 with PBS. Sections were then rinsed with PBS (2x5 min) followed by Incubation with an avidin-biotin peroxidase complex (Vector, Buriingame, CA), diluted 1:200 with PBS. Following rinsing with PBS (2x5 min), localization of the peroxidase conjugates was achieved by using diaminobenizidine tetrahydrochioride as a chromagen, for 1-3 minutes. Sections were rinsed in tap water for 5 minutes to stop reaction and then counterstained in Mayer's haemotoxylin, differentiated in Scott's tap water, dehydrated, cleared and mounted in Depex. Sections incubated with 1:10 NGS, instead of the primary antiserum, served as the negative controls. The accumulation of immunostaining for collagen I and III were quantified using computer-assisted image analysis. Briefly, 10 random non-overiapping fields from 10 rats per group were captured and digitized as described as above. An area of brown on immunostained sections (Collagen I and 111) was selected for their color ranges.   To  correct  for variation  due  to   shrinkage,  the  area  of  positive<br>
 <br>
immunostaining (collagen/area tissue) relative to the total area (matrix + myocytes) was determined using computer-assisted image analysis (AIS, Analytical imaging Station Version 6.0, Ontario, Canada), as previously reported [40].<br>
Macrophages<br>
Four micron heart sections were placed into histosol to remove the paraffin wax, hydrated in graded ethanol and immersed into tap water before being incubated for 20 minutes with normal goat serum (NGS) diluted 1:10 with 0.1 M PBS at pH 7.4. Sections were then incubated for 18 hours at 4°C with specific primary monoclonal rat macrophage marker (ED-1, 1:200 Serotec, Raleigh NC, USA). Macrophage number was estimated by counting the number of macrophages in 10 fields under light microscope with x200 power per animal from each group (n=10 per group) and expressed as numbers per field [38].<br>
Statistics<br>

Results<br>
FT011 pilot study (toxicity assessment)<br>
In the in vivo pilot study, there was no change in body weight amongst all animal groups (Table 1). Plasma levels of creatinine and urate, ALT and bilirubin were similar to control rats at all doses (Table 1). Following gavage of FT011, the level of FT011<br>
 <br>
measured in plasma increased in a dose dependent manner (Figure 1). A significant level of FT011 was also measured in ttie urine of rats treated with FT011 (Figure 2).<br>

Post-myocardial infarct in rats treated with FT011<br>
Animal characteristics<br>
In rats post myocardial infarct, RV and lung: body weight ratio was increased. The increase In lung: body weight ratio, a marker of pulmonary edema secondary to left heart failure was significantly reduced with FT011 treatment (Table 2).<br>

 <br>
*P
Myocardial infarct size was similar in the treated and untreated Ml groups (Figure 23; P= 0.36). In comparison with sham rats, Ml rats displayed increased interstitial fibrosis as evidenced by Masson's trichrome staining (Figures 24 and 25) and a greater abundance of interstitial cardiac fibrillar collagenous subtype I and III within the non-infarct zone (NIZ, Figures 26 and 27). Ml animals also showed evidence of an increase in the infiltration of macrophages in NIZ (Figures 28 and 29). All of these changes were attenuated by FTOl 1 treatment, indicative of a diminution in adverse remodelling post-Mi.<br>
Echocardiography<br>
Following Ml, over the 5 weeks duration of the study, echocardiography demonstrated the hallmarks of adverse LV remodelling including: ventricular dilatation, as evidenced by an increase in LVIDd and LVIDs; impaired systolic and diastolic function as evidenced by a reduction in percentage of fractional area change (FAC), and an increased E: A ratio and deceleration time, respectively (Table 3). All of these changes were significantly attenuated by FT011 treatment (Table 3).<br>
 <br>
In vivo pressure volume loop analysis<br>
Pressure volume loop analysis was used to assess both load-sensitive and load-insensitive measures of systolic and diastolic function.<br>
The preload recruitable stroke work index, used to assess systolic function, was significantly reduced in the Ml animals when compared to sham (p 
Chamber compliance, measured by the slope of the end diastolic pressure volume relationship was increased in the Ml animals when compared to sham, indicating impaired diastolic function. Treatment with FT011 restored compliance in the Ml animals to levels comparable with sham (Figure 30).<br>

Diabetic (mRen-2)27 rats treated with FT011<br>
Animal characteristics<br>
Diabetic rats had reduced body welglit and were all equally hyperglycaemic Table 4). Diabetic rats had increased albuminuria and FT011 significantly attenuated the rise in albuminuria (Figure 11)<br>
