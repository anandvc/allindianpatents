The noxious arthropod controlling composition of the present invention contains the compound of the present invention and an inert carrier. Generally, it is a preparation obtained by mixing the compound of the present invention and an inert carrier such as a solid carrier, a liquid carrier, a gaseous carrier and/or bait for poison bait, and if necessary, adding a surfactant and other adjuvant for formulation. The formulation includes, for example, an emulsifiable concentrate, an oil solution, a dust, a granule, a wettable powder, a flowable, a microcapsule, an aerosol, a smoking pesticide, a poison bait, regious preparation and the like. These formulations can be converted to use into a poison bait, a sheet. In the noxious arthropod controlling composition of the present invention, the compound of the present invention is usually contained in an amount of 0.01% to 95% by weight.<br>
The solid carrier for formulation includes, for example, a fine power and a granule of clays (e.g., kaolin clay, diatomite, bentonite, Fubasami clay, acid clay, etc.), synthetic hydrated silicon oxide, talc, ceramic, other inorganic minerals (e.g., sericite, quartz, sulfur, activated carbon, calcium carbonate,<br><br>
