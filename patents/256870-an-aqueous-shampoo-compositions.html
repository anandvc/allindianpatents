SHAMPOO COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING A COMBINATION OF<br>
CATIONIC POLYMERS<br>
5   FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to shampoo compositions containing a combination of cationic polymers.<br>
10   BACKGROUND AMD PRIOR ART<br>
Shampoo compositions comprising various combinations of cleansing surfactant and conditioning agents are known. These products typically comprise an anionic cleansing<br>
15  surfactant in combination with a conditioning agent. Amongst the most popular conditioning agents used in shampoo compositions are oily materials such as mineral oils, naturally occurring oils such as triglycerides and silicone polymers. These are generally present in the shampoo as<br>
20  dispersed hydrophobic emulsion droplets.  Conditioning is<br>
achieved by the oily material being deposited onto the hair resulting in the formation of a film.<br>
However, many shampoo compositions do not provide a 25  sufficient level of deposition of conditioning agent onto<br>
the hair and skin during the cleansing process. Without such deposition, large proportions of conditioning agent are rinsed away during the cleansing process and therefore provide little or no conditioning benefit. 30<br><br>
WO 2007/065537<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/010954<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
one known method for improving deposition of a conditioning agent from such shampoo compositions involves the use of cationic deposition polymers. These polymers may be synthetic or natuxal polymers that have been modified with 5  cationic substituents.<br>
A problem associated with the use of cationic deposition polymers is that is difficult to obtain a good balance of conditioning benefits at different stages of the shampooing 10  process.<br>
For example, some cationic deposition polymers are effective at impx-oving wet stage hair sensory attributes during the stages of washing and rinsing, but give an undesirable haix* 15  feel after drying.<br>
The present inventors have found that this problem can be overcome by using a specific combination of cationic polymex-s in a shampoo composition which comprises small 20  droplets of a water-insoluble oily conditioning agent.<br>
In particular", shampoo compositions of the invention give improved wet conditioning benefits, such as soft feel, smooth feel and combability when wet, with a reduction in 25  dry hair sensory negatives such as the heavy, gx-easy or<br>
coated feel that many consumers experience when high charge density cationic polymex-s and oily conditioning agents are combined in shampoos.<br><br>

Polygalactomannans are polysaccharides composed principally of galactose and mannose units and are usually found in the endosperm of certain leguminous seeds such as guar, locust 5  bean, honey locust, flame tree and the like. Guar gum, for example, is composed mostly of a galactomannan with essentially is a straight chain rnannan with single membered galactose branches. The ratio of galactose to mannose in the guar polymer is 1:2. Locust bean gum is a polygalactomannan 10  gum if  similar molecular structure in which the ratio of galactose to mannose is 1:4.<br>
