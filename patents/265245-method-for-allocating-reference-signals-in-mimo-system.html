METHOD FOR ALLOCATING REFERENCE SIGNALS IN<br>
MIMO SYSTEM<br>
Technical Field<br>
[ 1 ] The present invention relates to wireless communication, and more particularly, to a<br>
method for allocating reference signals in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)<br>
antenna system.<br>
Background Art<br>
[2] A multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system is defined as a system that<br>
improves data communication efficiency by the use of multiple transmit antennas and<br>
multiple receive antennas, The MIMO system may be realized using a MIMO scheme<br>
such as a spatial multiplexing and a spatial diversity. According to the spatial mul-<br>
tiplexing, different streams are concurrently transmitted through the multiple transmit<br>
antennas, and thus fast transmission is achieved without having to increase a system<br>
bandwidth. According to the spatial diversity, same streams are transmitted through the<br>
multiple transmit antennas to obtain diversity.<br>
[3] In order to reproduce a signal transmitted from a transmitter, channel estimation has<br>
to be carried out by a receiver. Channel estimation is defined as a process in which a<br>
distorted signal is restored by compensating for signal distortion due to fading. In<br>
general, for the channel estimation, reference signals are required which are known by<br>
both the transmitter and the receiver.<br>
[4] The reference signals may be allocated using either a first scheme in which the<br>
reference signals are allocated over the entire frequency band or a second scheme in<br>
which the reference signals are allocated over a part of the frequency band. The<br>
reference signals are further densely allocated in the first scheme rather than the second<br>
scheme. The channel estimation can be further accurately performed when the first<br>
scheme is used. On the other hand, a higher data rate can be achieved in the second<br>
scheme rather than the first scheme. In the second scheme, the reference signals are<br>
scarcely allocated, and thus the channel estimation may degrade.<br>
[5] In the MIMO system, multiple channels are independently provided for multiple<br>
antennas. The reference signals need to be allocated in consideration of the multiple<br>
channels. In addition, the MIMO system may operate in either a single-codeword mode<br>
or a multiple-codeword mode according to a rank. The number of reference signals<br>
may increase along with the increase in the number of transmit antennas. But, this may<br>
adversely affect the data rate.<br>
[6] Therefore, there is a need for a technique in which the reference signals can be ef-<br><br>
fectively allocated in consideration of the multiple antennas.<br>

Division Multiplexing (OFDM) symbols in a time domain and a plurality of sub-<br>
carriers in a frequency domain. The method includes allocating a plurality of first<br>
reference signals for a first antenna on a first OFDM symbol over a sub-frame for the<br>
first antenna at regular intervals in the frequency domain, allocating a plurality of<br>
second reference signals for a second antenna on the first OFDM symbol over a sub-<br>
frame for the second antenna at regular intervals in the frequency domain such that the<br>
plurality of second reference signals does not overlap with the plurality of first<br>
reference signals, allocating a plurality of third reference signals for a third antenna on<br>
a second OFDM symbol over a sub-frame for the third antenna at regular intervals in<br>
the frequency domain, wherein the second OFDM symbol is contiguous with the first<br>
OFDM symbol and allocating a plurality of fourth reference signals for a fourth<br>
antenna on the second OFDM symbol over a sub-frame for the fourth antenna such that<br>
the plurality of fourth reference signals does not overlap with the plurality of third<br>
reference signals.<br>
[9] According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for placing<br>
reference signals in a wireless communication system. The method includes preparing<br>
a plurality of sub-frames for a plurality of antennas, one sub-frame comprising a<br>
plurality of OFDM symbols in a time domain and a plurality of sub-carriers in a<br>
frequency domain, placing a reference signal for one sub-frame and placing a reference<br>
signal for another sub-frame not to overlap with the reference signal for one sub-frame,<br>
wherein the reference signal for one sub-frame and the reference signal for another<br>
sub-frame are successively placed on contiguous OFDM symbols or on the contiguous<br>
sub-carriers.<br>

Mode for the Invention<br>
[24] Additional features and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the de-<br>
scription which follows, and in part will be apparent from the description, or may be<br>
learned by practice of the invention. It is to be understood that both the foregoing<br>
general description and the following detailed description of the present invention are<br>
exemplary and explanatory and are intended to provide further explanation of the<br>
invention as claimed.<br>
[25] The technique to be described below may be used in various communication<br>
systems. The communication systems are widely distributed so as to provide various<br>
communication services (e.g. voice, packet data, etc). The technique may be used for<br>
downlink or uplink. In general, downlink means communication from a base station<br>
(BS) to user equipment (UE), and uplink means communication from the UE to the<br>
BS. The BS is generally referred to a fixed station that communicates with the UE and<br>
may also be referred to as another terminology such as a node-B, a base transceiver<br>
system (BTS) and an access point. The UE may be fixedly located or may have<br>
mobility. The UE may also be referred to as another terminology such as a mobile<br>
station (MS), a user terminal (UT), a subscriber station (SS) and a wireless device.<br>
[26] A communication system may be either a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)<br>
system or a multiple-input single-output (MISO) system. The MIMO system includes a<br>
plurality of transmit antennas and a plurality of receive antennas. The MISO system<br>
includes a plurality of transmit antennas and a single receive antenna.<br>
[27] There is no limit in a multiple access modulation scheme. The multiple access<br>
modulation scheme may be a well-known single carrier modulation scheme (e.g. time<br>
division multiple access (TDMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), code<br>
division multiple access (CDMA), single carrier-frequency division multiple access<br>
(SC-FDMA)) or a multiple carrier modulation method (e.g. orthogonal frequency<br>
division multiplexing (OFDM)).<br>
[28] The channel estimation can be effectively performed by a receiver when reference<br>
signals are allocated under the following conditions.<br>
[29] First, the reference signals have to be allocated so that the receiver can distinguish<br>
the reference signals transmitted from multiple transmit antennas. This is because the<br>
reference signals are used by the receiver for the channel estimation. The reference<br>
signals can be allocated not to overlap one another in a time and/or frequency domain<br>
for the respective transmit antennas, so that the receiver can distinguish the reference<br><br>
signals. Alternatively, when the reference signals are orthogonal to each other in a<br>
code domain, the reference signals can overlap one another in the time and/or<br>
frequency domain. To achieve orthogonality in the code domain, the reference signals<br>
may use an orthogonal code having excellent auto-correlation or cross-correlation.<br>
Examples of the orthogonal code include a constant amplitude zero auto-correlation<br>
(CAZAC) sequence and a Walsh code.<br>
[30] Second, a channel variance has to be negligibly small in a region where the reference<br>
signals are placed. A channel in this region is used to decode data allocated adjacent to<br>
the reference signals. If the channel significantly changes in this region, a channel<br>
estimation error may become significant.<br>
[31] In exemplary embodiments, reference signals may be shifted by a specific interval on<br>
the time axis or by a specific interval on the frequency axis. That is, for each sub-frame<br>
for respective transmit antennas, the reference signals may be generally shifted by a<br>
specific time interval and/or by a specific frequency interval while the interval between<br>
reference signals is maintained.<br>
[32] A reference signal may be a reference signal for an user or a reference signal for a<br>
multi-user signal. The multi-user signal may be a broadcast signal and/or a multicast<br>
signal. The broadcast signal is sent to all users within a specific area (e.g. cell and/or<br>
sector). The multicast signal is sent to a specific group of users. A unicast signal is sent<br>
to a specific user. One example of the multi-user signal may be a mobile broadcast/<br>
multicast service (MBMS) signal. When transmitting the MBMS signal, the same<br>
signal is transmitted from all cells (or base stations).<br>
[33] Hereinafter, various examples of a reference signal allocation for an MIMO system<br>
having four transmit antennas will be described. The reference signals will be allocated<br>
according to the following principles. First, the number of reference signals for first<br>
and second antennas in a sub-frame is larger than that of reference signals for third and<br>
fourth antennas in the sub- frame. Second, the percentage occupied by the entire<br>
reference signals in the sub-frame is below a predetermined value. Third, Reference<br>
signals for each transmit antenna do not overlap one another.<br>
[34] A sub-frame includes a plurality of OFDM symbols in a time domain and a plurality<br>
of sub-carrier in a frequency domain. The sub-frame is a resource grid which is defined<br>
for each transmit antenna. A transmission time interval (TTI) can be defined as a time<br>
required for transmitting a single sub-frame. A frame may include a plurality of sub-<br>
frames. For example, one frame may include ten sub-frames.<br>
[35] The sub-frame can be divided by two regions, a control channel and a data channel.<br>
The control channel is the region carrying control data. The data channel is the region<br>
carrying user data. For example, a first OFDM symbol, a second OFDM symbol and a<br>
third OFDM symbol may be allocated for the control channel and the other OFDM<br><br>
symbols mat be allocated for the data channel. Although the number of OFDM<br>
symbols for the control channel is smaller than that of OFDM symbols for the control<br>
channel, the reliability for the control channel has to be higher than that of the data<br>
channel. Only a part of multiple antennas can be assigned for transmitting the control<br>
channel. A first antenna and a second antenna can be used for the control channel. In<br>
this case, reference signals for a third antenna and reference signals for a fourth<br>
antenna may not be assigned for the OFDM symbols for the control channel because<br>
the third antenna and the fourth antenna are not used for the control channel.<br>
[36] FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a transmitter having multiple antennas.<br>
[37] Referring to FIG. 1, a transmitter 100 includes a channel encoder 120, a mapper 130,<br>
an MIMO processor 140, a multiplexer 150 and an OFDM modulator 160. The channel<br>
encoder 120 encodes an input stream according to a predetermined coding scheme and<br>
then generates a coded word. The mapper 130 maps the coded word to a symbol that<br>
represents a position on signal constellation. Since there is no limit in a modulation<br>
scheme of the mapper 130, the modulation scheme may be m-phase shift keying<br>
(m-PSK) or m-quadrature amplitude modulation (m-QAM). Examples of the m-PSK<br>
include BPSK, QPSK, and 8-PSK. Examples of the m-QAM include 16-QAM,<br>
64-QAM, and 256-QAM. The MIMO processor 140 processes an mapped symbol by<br>
using an MIMO scheme according to transmit antennas 190-1, ..., 190-Nt (Nt&gt;l). For<br>
example, the MIMO processor 140 may handle codebook-based pre-coding.<br>
[38] The multiplexer 150 allocates an input symbol and reference signals to a sub-carrier.<br>
The reference signals are allocated for the respective transmit antennas 190-1,...,<br>
190-Nt. The reference signals, also referred to as pilots, are used for channel estimation<br>
or data demodulation and are known by both the transmitter 100 and a receiver 200 of<br>
FIG. 2. The OFDM modulator 160 modulates a multiplexed symbol and thus outputs<br>
an OFDM symbol. The OFDM modulator 160 may perform inverse fast Fourier<br>
transform (IFFT) on the multiplexed symbol, and may further insert a cyclic prefix<br>
(CP) therein after IFFT is performed. The OFDM symbol is transmitted through the<br>
respective transmit antennas 190-1, ..., 190-Nt.<br>
[39] FIG. 2 is a block diagram of a receiver having multiple antennas.<br>
[40] Referring to FIG. 2, a receiver 200 includes an OFDM demodulator 210, a channel<br>
estimator 220, an MIMO post-processor 230, a de-mapper 240, and a channel decoder<br>
250. Signals received from receive antennas 290-1, ..., 290-Nr are subject to fast<br>
Fourier transform (FFT) by the OFDM demodulator 210. The channel estimator 220<br>
obtains an estimated channel by using reference signals. The MIMO post-processor<br>
230 performs post-processing equivalent to the MIMO processor 140. The de-mapper<br>
240 de-maps the input symbol to a coded word. The channel decoder 250 decodes the<br>
coded word so as to be restored to original data.<br><br>
[41] Now, allocation of reference signals will be described.<br>
[42] FIG. 3 illustrates an example of a reference signal allocation when two transmit<br>
antennas are used. In general, data transmission can be achieved in the unit of a sub-<br>
frame for respective transmit antennas according to a OFDM modulation scheme. For<br>
example, the sub-frame shown in FIG. 3 includes seven OFDM symbols where a TTI<br>
is 0.5 milli-second (msec.). However, the present inventive concept is not limited<br>
thereto, and thus the sub-frame and the TTI may be configured in various forms.<br>
[43] Referring to FIG. 3, reference signals are respectively allocated for a sub-frame of a<br>
first antenna and a sub-frame of a second antenna. D denotes a data symbol for<br>
carrying data, R denotes a first reference signal for the first antenna and R denotes a<br>
second reference signal for the second antenna. The first reference signal R may be<br>
equal to or different from the second reference signal R .<br>
[44] Each of elements over a resource grid constituting a sub-frame is referred to as a<br>
resource element. For example, a resource element q(k,l) is placed at a k-th OFDM<br>
symbol and an 1-th sub-carrier. The data symbol D, the first reference signal R , and the<br>
second reference signal R2 are carried in one resource element.<br>
[45] Regarding the sub-frame of the first antenna, the reference signals are allocated over<br>
seven OFDM symbols. For clarity of description, hereinafter, the seven OFDM<br>
symbols will be respectively referred to as a first OFDM symbol, a second OFDM<br>
symbol, ..., and a seventh OFDM symbol from the beginning of a TTI.<br>
[46] In the first OFDM symbol, the first reference signals R may be allocated at the<br>
interval of six sub-carriers. Likewise, in the fifth OFDM symbol, the second reference<br>
signals R may be allocated at the interval of six sub-carriers. In the fifth OFDM<br>
symbol, the second reference signals R are each shifted by the size of three sub-<br>
carriers from positions where the first reference signals Rl in the first OFDM symbol<br>
are placed. In the sub-frame, an array of (R , D, D, D, D, D) is repeated in the first<br>
OFDM symbol and an array of (D, D, D, R , D, D) is repeated in the fifth OFDM<br>
symbol.<br>
[47] Regarding the second antenna, reference signals are allocated in the same pattern as<br>
in the first antenna. In the first OFDM symbol, the first reference signals R are<br>
allocated at the interval of six sub-carriers. In the fifth OFDM symbol, negative second<br>
reference signals -R are allocated at the interval of six sub-carriers. The negative<br>
second reference signals -R are obtained by negating the second reference signals R .<br>
In the fifth OFDM symbol, the negative second reference signals -R are each shifted<br>
by the size of three sub-carriers from positions where the first reference signals Rl in<br>
the first OFDM are placed. That is, an array of (R , D, D, D, D, D) is repeated in the<br>
first OFDM symbol and an array of (D, D, D, -R2, D, D) is repeated in the fifth OFDM<br>
symbol.<br><br>
[48] Since the reference signals are allocated in the same pattern in both the first and<br>
second antennas, an orthogonal code can be used so that the receiver can distinguish<br>
the reference signals for the respective transmit antennas. The orthogonal code may be<br>
a CAZAC sequence or a Walsh sequence having excellent auto-correlation or cross-<br>
correlation.<br>
[49] FIG. 4 illustrates an example of a reference signal allocation when four transmit<br>
antennas are used. The reference signals are allocated for each sub-frame for the<br>
respective transmit antennas. Here, N denotes a null symbol, R denotes a first<br>
reference signal, R2 denotes a second reference signal and D denotes a data symbol.<br>
The null symbol can be defined as a symbol that does not carry data. The null symbol<br>
may be generated when no data is allocated to a sub-carrier or when the sub-carrier<br>
allocated with data is punctured later.<br>
[50] Regarding the first antenna, reference signals are allocated at the interval of six sub-<br>
carriers. In other words, the reference signals are placed with five sub-carriers<br>
therebetween. The five sub-carriers may include four data symbols D and one null<br>
symbol. Therefore, the first OFDM symbol is repeated with an array of (R , D, D, N,<br>
D, D). The null symbol is allocated to a resource element where reference signals for<br>
the third and fourth antennas to be described below are placed. Reference signals are<br>
not allocated in the second, third, and fourth OFDM symbols. Instead, data symbols D<br>
are allocated therein. Reference signals may be allocated at the interval of six sub-<br>
carriers in the fifth OFDM symbol. The reference signals in the fifth OFDM symbol<br>
are each shifted by the size of three sub-carriers from positions where the reference<br>
signals in the first OFDM symbol are placed. The sixth and seventh OFDM symbols<br>
are allocated with data symbols instead of reference signals.<br>
[51] Regarding the second antenna, reference signals are allocated in the same pattern as<br>
those of the first antenna. The reference signals for the first and second antennas are<br>
allocated to overlap each other in the same OFDM symbols and sub-carriers. The<br>
receiver may use an orthogonal code having an excellent auto-correlation or cross-<br>
correlation in order to distinguish the reference signals for the first antenna from the<br>
reference signals for the second antenna. By using orthogonality of the reference<br>
signals R and R transmitted through the first antenna and the reference signals R and<br>
-R transmitted through the second antenna, the receiver may separate these reference<br>
signals from one another.<br>
[52] Regarding the third antenna, reference signals are allocated as follows. T'he reference<br>
signals R are allocated at the interval of six sub-carriers in the first OFDM symbol.<br>
Likewise, the reference signals R are allocated at the interval of six sub-carriers in the<br>
fifth OFDM symbol. The reference signals R in the fifth OFDM symbol are each<br>
shifted by the size of three sub-carriers from positions where the reference signals R in<br><br>
the first OFDM symbol are placed. Therefore, an array of (N, D, D, R , D, D) is<br>
repeated in the first OFDM symbol, and an array of (R2, D, D, N, D, D) is repeated in<br>
the fifth OFDM symbol. Regarding the fourth antenna, reference signals are allocated<br>
in the same pattern as those of the third antenna. Reference signals are allocated at the<br>
interval of six sub-carriers in the first and fifth OFDM symbols. The receiver may use<br>
an orthogonal code in order to distinguish the reference signals for the third antenna<br>
from the reference signals for the fourth antenna.<br>
[53] Although the aforementioned reference signal allocation is exemplified, the present<br>
inventive concept is not limited thereto, and thus reference signals may be shifted by a<br>
specific interval on the time axis or by a specific interval on the frequency axis. That<br>
is, for each sub-frame for respective transmit antennas, the reference signals may be<br>
generally shifted by a specific lime interval and/or by a specific frequency interval<br>
while the interval between reference signals is maintained. Since the reference signals<br>
can be generally shifted as described above without having to reallocate the reference<br>
signals, channel estimation can be achieved for multiple cells, multiple sectors and<br>
multiple users.<br>
[54] In the mean time, reference signals for a specific antenna may be partially or entirely<br>
used (or not used) according to time-varying channel variation in a multiple of the<br>
number of sub-frames.<br>
[55] In the aforementioned descriptions, the reference signals overlap one another when at<br>
least two transmit antennas are used. The overlapping reference signals maintain their<br>
orthogonality in the code domain by using an orthogonal code.<br>
[56] FIG. 5 illustrates an example of a reference signal allocation. R denotes a reference<br>
signal and a blank of a resource element denotes a data symbol or a null symbol.<br>
[57] Referring to FIG. 5, a plurality of reference signals R is allocated at the interval of<br>
two sub-carriers in the third OFDM symbol. A plurality of reference signals R is also<br>
allocated at the interval of two sub-carriers in the seventh OFDM symbol which is<br>
spaced apart by the size of four OFDM symbols from the third OFDM symbol. The<br>
reference signals R in the third and seventh OFDM symbols are staggered from each<br>
other. A plurality of reference signals R is allocated at the interval of two sub-carriers<br>
in the eleventh OFDM symbol which is spaced apart by the size of four OFDM<br>
symbols from the seventh OFDM symbol.<br>
[58] Each reference signal R may be a reference signal for a multi-user signal. Here, the<br>
multi-user signal may be a broadcast signal and/or a multicast signal. The broadcast<br>
signal is sent to all users within a specific area (e.g. cell and/or sector). The multicast<br>
signal is sent to a specific group of users. A unicast signal is sent to a specific user.<br>
One example of the multi-user signal may be a mobile broadcast/multicast service<br>
(MBMS) signal. When transmitting the MBMS signal, the same signal is transmitted<br><br>
from all cells (or base stations). Therefore, all base stations use the same reference<br>
signal.<br>
[59] When using the MBMS signal, the reference signals R can be placed with a narrow<br>
interval therebetween so as to minimize frequency selectivity due to delay spread. In<br>
addition, the reference signals are densely arranged on the time axis so as to minimize<br>
time selectivity.<br>
[60] According to some MIMO technique such as cyclic delay diversity (CDD) and beam-<br>
forming, an UE seems to receive reference signals through single transmit antenna.<br>
Therefore, a BS does not need to transmit the reference signals by classifying the<br>
reference signals for each transmit antennas.<br>
[61] FIG. 6 illustrates another example of a reference signal allocation.<br>
[62] Referring to FIG. 6, reference signals R are placed with a relatively wider interval of<br>
the frqeucny domain therebetween than that of FIG. 5. By dosing so, it is advantageous<br>
when frequency selectivity is relatively low or when bandwidth of sub-carrier is<br>
relatively small. The bandwidth of sub-carrier may be half that of sub-carrier shown in<br>
FIG, 5.<br>
[63] FIG. 7 illustrates an example of a reference signal allocation for a multi-user signal.<br>
Herein, R is a reference signal for the first antenna. R2 is a reference signal for the<br>
second antenna.<br>
[64] Referring to FIG. 7, the reference signals R1 are allocated at the interval of two sub-<br>
carriers in the third OFDM symbol. That is, the reference signals Rl are placed with<br>
one sub-carrier therebetween. Therefore, an array of (R1, N) is repeated in the third<br>
OFDM symbol, where N denotes a null symbol. The reference signals Rl are allocated<br>
at the interval of two sub-carriers in the seventh OFDM symbol which is spaced apart<br>
by the size of four OFDM symbols from the third OFDM symbol. The reference<br>
signals R in the third and seventh OFDM symbols are staggered from each other.<br>
[65] The reference signals R2 are alternately allocated in the same OFDM symbol with<br>
respect to the reference signal R1. That is, one reference signal R2 is placed between<br>
two reference signals R1 with the same interval in the frequency domain.<br>
[66] FIG. 8 illustrates another example of a reference signal allocation for a multi-user<br>
signal when multiple antennas are used.<br>
[67] Referring to FIG. 8, the reference signals R1 for the first antenna are allocated at the<br>
interval of four sub-carriers in the third OFDM symbol. That is, the reference signals R<br>
are placed with three sub-carriers therebetween. Therefore, an array of (R1, D, N, D)<br>
is repeated in the third OFDM symbol where a blank of a resource element denotes D<br>
and N. The reference signals R are allocated at the interval of four sub-carriers in the<br>
seventh OFDM symbol which is spaced apart by the size of four OFDM symbols from<br>
the third OFDM symbol. The reference signals R in the third and seventh OFDM<br><br>
symbols are staggered from each other.<br>
[68] The reference signals R2 for the second antenna are alternately arranged with respect<br>
to the reference signal R1 in the same OFDM symbols at the same interval as the<br>
reference signals R1. That is, one reference signal R2 is placed between two reference<br>
signals R with the same interval in the frequency domain.<br>
[69] FIG. 9 illustrates another example of a reference signal allocation for a multi-user<br>
signal when multiple antennas are used.<br>
[70] Referring to FIG. 9, the reference signals Rl for the first antenna are allocated at the<br>
interval of two sub-carriers in the third OFDM symbol. That is, the reference signals R<br>
are placed with one sub-carrier therebetween. Therefore, an array of (R1, N) is repeated<br>
in the third OFDM symbol. The reference signals R are allocated at the interval of two<br>
sub-carriers in the seventh OFDM symbol which is spaced apart by the size of four<br>
OFDM symbols from the third OFDM symbol. The reference signals R1 in the third<br>
and seventh OFDM symbols are staggered from each other in the frequency domain.<br>
[71] The reference signals R2 for the second antenna are allocated in the same frequency<br>
domain as in the case of the reference signals R1 in OFDM symbols (e.g. fourth OFDM<br>
symbol, eighth OFDM symbol, etc) which are adjacent to the OFDM symbols where<br>
the reference signals R1 are allocated. That is, the frequency signals R2 are allocated at<br>
the same interval as the frequency signals R2.<br>
[72] FIG. 10 illustrates another example of a reference signal allocation for a multi-user<br>
signal when multiple antennas are used.<br>
[73] Referring to FIG. 10, the reference signals R1 for the first antenna are allocated at the<br>
interval of four sub-carriers in the third OFDM symbol. That is, the reference signals R<br>
1 are placed with three sub-carriers therebetween. Therefore, an array of (R1, D, N, D)<br>
is repeated in the third OFDM symbol. The reference signals R are allocated at the<br>
interval of four sub-carriers in the seventh OFDM symbol which is spaced apart by the<br>
size of four OFDM symbols from the third OFDM symbol. The reference signals R in<br>
the third and seventh OFDM symbols are staggered from each other.<br>
[74] The reference signals R2 for the second antenna are allocated in the same frequency<br>
domain as in the case of the reference signals R1 in OFDM symbols (e.g. fourth OFDM<br>
symbol, eighth OFDM symbol, etc) which are adjacent to the OFDM symbols where<br>
the reference signals R1 are allocated. That is, the frequency signals R2 are allocated at<br>
the same interval as the frequency signals R2 in the frequency domain.<br>
[75] FIG. 11 illustrates another example of a reference signal allocation for a multi-user<br>
signal when multiple antennas are used.<br>
[76] Referring to FIG. 11, the reference signals R for the first antenna are allocated at the<br>
interval of two sub-carriers in the third OFDM symbol. That is, the reference signals R1<br>
are placed with one sub-carrier therebetween. Therefore, an array of (R1, N) is repeated<br><br>
in the third OFDM symbol. The reference signals R1 are allocated at the interval of two<br>
sub-carriers in the seventh OFDM symbol which is spaced apart by the size of four<br>
OFDM symbols from the third OFDM symbol. The reference signals R in the third<br>
and seventh OFDM symbols are staggered from each other.<br>
[77] The reference signals R2 for the second antenna overlap the reference signals R in<br>
the same OFDM symbols in the same frequency domain. The reference signals R and<br>
R2 can maintain orthogonality in the code domain by using the orthogonal code.<br>
[78] FIG. 12 illustrates another example of a reference signal allocation for a multi-user<br>
signal when multiple antennas are used.<br>
[79] Referring to FIG. 12, the reference signals R for the first antenna are allocated at the<br>
interval of four sub-carriers in the third OFDM symbol. That is, the reference signals R<br>
are placed with three sub-carriers therebetween. Therefore, an array of (R1, D, N, D)<br>
is repeated in the third OFDM symbol. The reference signals R1 are allocated at the<br>
interval of four sub-carriers in the seventh OFDM symbol which is spaced apart by the<br>
size of four OFDM symbols from the third OFDM symbol. The reference signals R1 in<br>
the third and seventh OFDM symbols are staggered from each other.<br>
[80] The reference signals R2 for the second antenna overlap the reference signals R1 in<br>
the same OFDM symbols in the same frequency domain. The reference signals R1 and<br>
R2 can maintain orthogonality in the code domain by using the orthogonal code.<br>
[81] FIG. 13 illustrates another example of a reference signal allocation for a multi-user<br>
signal when multiple antennas are used.<br>
[82] Referring to FIG. 13, the reference signals R1 for the first antenna are allocated at the<br>
interval of three sub-carriers in the third OFDM symbol. The reference signals R2 for<br>
the second antenna are adjacent to the reference signals R1 and are allocated at the<br>
same interval as the reference signals R1. Therefore, an array of (R1, R2, D) is repeated<br>
in the third OFDM symbol.<br>
[83] Both of the reference signals R1 and R2 are allocated in OFDM symbols which are<br>
spaced apart by the size of three OFDM symbols starting from the third OFDM<br>
symbol.<br>
[84] FIG. 14 illustrates another example of a reference signal allocation for a multi-user<br>
signal when multiple antennas are used. Throughout FIGS. 14 to 19, R denotes a<br>
reference signal for a multi-user signal, and T denotes a reference signal for a<br>
dedicated user signal. That is, hereinafter, two heterogeneous reference signals will be<br>
exemplified.<br>
[85] Referring to FIG. 14, the reference signals T1 for the first antenna and the reference<br>
signals T2 for the second antenna are allocated in the first OFDM symbol. In addition,<br>
the reference signals T1 and T2 are also allocated in the fourth OFDM symbol. The<br>
reference signals R1 for the first antenna and the reference signals R2 for the second<br><br>
antenna are allocated in OFDM symbols which are spaced apart by the size of four<br>
OFDM symbols from the third OFDM symbol.<br>
[86] FIG. 15 illustrates another example of a reference signal allocation for a multi-user<br>
signal when multiple antennas are used.<br>
[87] Referring to FIG. 15, the reference signals R1 for the first antenna and the reference<br>
signals R2 for the second antenna are allocated at a wider interval than those in the<br>
example of FIG. 14.<br>
[88] FIG. 16 illustrates another example of a reference signal allocation for a multi-user<br>
signal when multiple antennas are used.<br>
[89] In comparison with the example of FIG. 4, referring to FIG. 16, the reference signals<br>
R1 for the first antenna and the reference signals R2 for the second antenna are re-<br>
spectively allocated at the interval of three sub-carriers in the third OFDM symbol. The<br>
reference signals R2 are adjacent to the reference signals R1 and are allocated at the<br>
same interval as the reference signals R1.<br>
[90] FIG. 17 illustrates another example of a reference signal allocation for a multi-user<br>
signal when multiple antennas are used.<br>
[91] In comparison with the example of FIG. 14, referring to FIG. 17, the reference<br>
signals T1 for the first antenna and the reference signals T2 for the second antenna are<br>
allocated only in the first OFDM.<br>
[92] FIG. 18 illustrates another example of a reference signal allocation for a multi-user<br>
signal when multiple antennas are used.<br>
[93] Referring to FIG. 18, the reference signals R1 for the first antenna and the reference<br>
signals R2 for the second antenna are allocated at a wider interval than those in the<br>
example of FIG. 17.<br>
[94] FIG. 19 illustrates another example of a reference signal allocation for a multi-user<br>
signal when multiple antennas are used.<br>
[95] In comparison with the example of FIG. 16, referring to FIG. 19, the reference<br>
signals T1 for the first antenna and the reference signals T2 for the second antenna are<br>
allocated only in the first OFDM.<br>
[96] In embodiments of FIGS. 14 to 19, reference signals for multi-users can be<br>
transmitted through single transmit antenna. Since an UE seems to receive reference<br>
signals through single transmit antenna in CDD or beam-forming, a BS does not need<br>
to transmit the reference signals after classifying the reference signals for each transmit<br>
antennas.<br>
[97] Hereinafter, various examples of a reference signal allocation for an MIMO system<br>
having four transmit antennas will be described. The reference signals will be allocated<br>
according to the following principles.<br>
[98] (1) The reference signals R1 for the first antenna described in the example of FIG. 3<br><br>
remain their positions also in the MIMO system having four transmit antennas.<br>
[99] (2) Among the whole signals used, the percentage occupied by the entire reference<br>
signals is below a predetermined value. When the percentage of the entire reference<br>
signals increases, the receiver can relatively perform accurate channel estimation by<br>
receiving a plurality of reference signals. However, the higher the percentage, the<br>
lower the data rate is. It will be assumed that the percentage is below about 15 percent<br>
or 20 percent. In this case, if the reference signals are effectively allocated,<br>
performance degradation of the channel estimation can be minimized.<br>
[100] (3) Reference signals for each transmit antenna do not overlap one another. That is,<br>
the reference signals for each transmit antenna do not overlap one another in both the<br>
time domain and the frequency domain.<br>
[101] FIG. 20 illustrates an example of a reference signal allocation according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. T1 is a reference signal for the first antenna, T2 is<br>
a reference signal for the second antenna, T3 is a reference signal for the third antenna,<br>
and T4 is a reference signal for the fourth antenna. A blank resource element may be a<br>
data symbol or a null symbol.<br>
[102] Referring to FIG. 20, one sub-frame comprises fourteen OFDM symbols. However,<br>
this is only an example, and thus the number of OFDM symbols constituting one sub-<br>
frame may vary. Although one sub-frame is illustrated for convenience, reference<br>
signals for each antenna are allocated for each sub-frame for respective antennas. That<br>
is, the reference signals T1 are allocated in the sub-frame for the first antenna. The<br>
reference signals T2 are allocated in the sub-frame for the second antenna. The<br>
reference signals T3 are allocated in the sub-frame for the third antenna. The reference<br>
signals T are allocated in the sub-frame for the fourth antenna. For clarity of de-<br>
4<br>
scription, it will be assumed that fourteen OFDM symbols are defined as a first OFDM<br>
symbol, a second OFDM symbol, ..., and a fourteenth OFDM symbol from a<br>
beginning of a TTI.<br>
[103] The reference signals T are allocated at the interval of six sub-carriers in the first and<br>
eighth OFDM symbols. In addition, the reference signals T are also allocated at the<br>
interval of six sub-carriers in the fifth and twelfth OFDM symbols. The reference<br>
signals T1 allocated in the fifth and twelfth OFDM symbols are each shifted by the size<br>
of three sub-carries from those allocated in the first and eighth OFDM symbols.<br>
[104] The reference signals T2 are allocated at the interval of six sub-carriers in the first,<br>
fifth, eighth and twelfth OFDM symbols. The reference signals T2 in the first and fifth<br>
OFDM symbols are each shifted by the size of three sub-carriers from positions where<br>
the reference signals T1 are placed. The reference signals T2 in the fifth and twelfth<br>
OFDM symbols are each placed in the same positions as the reference signals T1.<br>
[105] The reference signals T3 are allocated at the interval of 12 sub-carriers in the first,<br><br>
fifth, eighth and twelfth OFDM symbols. The reference signals T3 in the first OFDM<br>
symbol are each shifted by the size of one sub-carrier from positions where the<br>
reference signals T1 are placed. The reference signals T3 in the fifth, eighth and twelfth<br>
OFDM symbols are allocated at the interval of twelve sub-carriers and are shifted by<br>
the size of one sub-carrier where reference signals of other antennas are placed.<br>
[106] The reference signals T4 are allocated at the interval of twelve sub-carriers in the<br>
first, fifth, eighth and twelfth OFDM symbols. The reference signals T4 are each<br>
shifted by one sub-carrier from positions where the reference signals T3 are placed.<br>
[107] The reference signals T1 and T2 are more densely allocated than the reference signals<br>
T3 and T4 so that the first and second antennas which are more frequently used than<br>
other antennas can have better channel estimation performance.<br>
[108] In general, more control signals are carried in OFDM symbols located prior to the<br>
third OFDM symbol. The reference signals T1 to T4 are allocated such that an array of<br>
(T1, T3, T4, T2, D, D, T1, D, D, T2, D, D) is repeated in the first OFDM symbol, and an<br>
array of (T2, D, D, T1, D, D, T2, T3, T4, T1, D, D) is repeated in the fifth OFDM symbol.<br>
An array of (T1, D, D, T2, T3, T4, T1, D, D, T2, D, D) is repeated in the eighth OFDM<br>
symbol, and an array of (T2, D, D, T1, D, D, T2, D, D, T1, T3, T4, T2) is repeated in the<br>
twelfth OFDM symbol. Data symbols D may be allocated where these reference<br>
signals are not placed. In this case, the percentage occupied by the data symbols D is<br>
about 86 percent.<br>
[109] The percentage occupied by the data symbols in a sub-frame may be different<br>
according to characteristics of the system. Hereinafter, we exemplarily illustrate 14<br>
OFDM symbols per a TTI but it's not limited. One TTI may include 12 or more<br>
OFDM symbols.<br>
[110] The depicted reference signal allocation pattern is shown in relatively positions, and<br>
thus this does not indicate absolute positions. The reference signal pattern may be<br>
shifted in the time domain and/or the frequency domain while the reference signals<br>
maintained each interval.<br>
[111] In a sub-frame, a null symbol may be allocated to a resource element where reference<br>
signals of other antennas are placed. For example, in the sub-frame for the first<br>
antenna, the null symbol may be allocated to a resource element where reference<br>
signals for the second to fourth antennas are placed.<br>
[112] At least one of the reference signals for respective antennas may be a reference signal<br>
for a multi-user signal. In a sub-frame, the reference signal for a multi-user signal may<br>
not be allocated in OFDM symbols including a dedicated control signal but be<br>
allocated in the rest of OFDM symbols. For example, if the first and second OFDM<br>
symbols include the dedicated control signals, the reference signals for the multi-user<br>
signal may be allocated starting from the third OFDM symbol.<br><br>
[113] FIG. 21 illustrates an example of a reference signal allocation according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[114] Referring to FIG. 21, the reference signals T1 and T3 are sequentially allocated in the<br>
first OFDM symbol together with one data symbol. A blank resource element may be a<br>
data symbol or a null symbol. The reference signals T2 and T4 are sequentially<br>
allocated, following the data symbol D. Accordingly, an array of (T1, T3, D, T2, T4, D)<br>
may be repeated.<br>
[115] In the fifth OFDM symbol, the reference signal T2 is placed followed by two data<br>
symbols D and the reference signal T1. Two data symbols D are placed again, followed<br>
by the reference signal T2. Accordingly, an array of (T2, D, D, T1, D, D) may be<br>
repeated.<br>
[116] The eighth OFDM symbol may have the similar pattern to the first OFDM symbol,<br>
and thus an array of (T1, T4, D, T2, T3, D) may be repeated. The twelfth OFDM symbol<br>
may have the same pattern to the fifth OFDM symbol.<br>
[117] The percentage occupied by the data symbols D is about 86%. Therefore, the<br>
percentage occupied by the reference signals is about 14%. Accordingly, the reference<br>
signals do not overlap one another for respective transmit antennas, and thus the<br>
receiver can estimate respective channels.<br>
[118] FIG. 22 illustrates an example of a reference signal allocation according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[119] Referring to FIG. 22, in the first OFDM symbol, the first, third, and fourth reference<br>
signals T1, T3, T4 and T2 are each allocated. A blank resource element may be a data<br>
symbol or a null symbol. Then, two data symbols D are placed, followed by another<br>
reference signal T1. Two data symbols are placed again, followed by another reference<br>
signal T2. Then, two data symbols are placed, followed by the reference signals T1, T3,<br>
T4 and T2, in that order. Accordingly, an array of (T1, T3, T4, T2, D, D, T1, D, D, T2, D,<br>
D) may be repeated in the first OFDM symbol.<br>
[120] In the fifth OFDM symbol, the reference signal T2 is placed, followed by two data<br>
symbols and the reference signal T1. Then, two data symbol are placed, followed by<br>
the reference signals T2, T3, T4 and T1, in that order. Then, two data symbols are placed<br>
again, and this arrangement may be repeated. Accordingly, an array of (T2, D, D, T1, D,<br>
D, T2, T3, T4, T1, D, D) may be repeated in the fifth OFDM symbol.<br>
[121] The eight OFDM symbol has the same reference signal allocation as the first OFDM<br>
symbol. The twelfth OFDM symbol has the same reference signal allocation as the<br>
fifth OFDM symbol.<br>
[122] Data symbols occupy about 85% of the entire area. Thus, reference signals occupy<br>
about 15%. Accordingly, the receiver can estimate channels by using the reference<br>
signals transmitted from the respective transmit antennas.<br><br>

[180] FIG. 51 illustrates an example of a reference signal allocation according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[181] An array of (T1, D, D, T2, D, D) is repeated in the first and eighth OFDM symbols.<br>
An array of (T2, D, D, T1, D, D) is repeated in the fifth and twelfth OFDM symbols. An<br>
array of (T3, D, D, T4, D, D) is repeated in the second OFDM symbol. An array of (T4,<br>
D, D, T3, D, D) is repeated in the ninth OFDM symbol.<br>
[182] In the first, fifth and twelfth OFDM symbols, the reference signals T1 and T2 are<br>
staggered from each other for each antenna in the frequency domain. In the second and<br>
ninth OFDM symbols, the reference signals T3 and T4 are staggered from each other<br>
for each antenna in the frequency domain. Accordingly, selectivity can be ensured in<br>
the frequency domain.<br><br>
[183] The reference signals T1 and T2 are allocated in the first OFDM symbol. The<br>
reference signals T3 and T4 are allocated in the second OFDM symbol adjacent to the<br>
first OFDM symbol. When reference signals for multiple antennas are allocated over<br>
two consecutive OFDM symbols, the lower the rank, the higher the effectiveness is.<br>
For example, if the rank is one in some MIMO techniques, the same data is transmitted<br>
through four antennas. In this case, channel estimation can be further effectively<br>
achieved when the reference signals are allocated in the two consecutive OFDM<br>
symbols.<br>
[184] Furthermore, reference signals for at least two antennas are transmitted across the<br>
same frequency domain in the two consecutive OFDM symbols. Therefore, channel<br>
estimation can be achieved less erroneously than the case where reference signals are<br>
excessively staggered when the reference signals are concentrated in the frequency<br>
domain and the time domain.<br>
[185] Only a part of reference signals for all antennas are allocated in one OFDM symbol.<br>
For example, among reference signals for four antennas, only reference signals for two<br>
antennas may be allocated. Thus, power can be further boosted for each antenna, where<br>
power is allocated to the reference signals. As the power of reference signals increases,<br>
channel estimation can be further effectively carried out by the receiver.<br>
[186] In some receivers, the first some OFDM symbols (e.g. three OFDM symbols) are<br>
decoded. If the decoding result does not coincide with data stored in the receiver, the<br>
OFDM symbols transmitted thereafter are not buffered. This is referred to as a micro-<br>
sleep mode. In this case, the first some OFDM symbols have to include reference<br>
signals for all antennas. The micro-sleep mode may also be implemented when the<br>
reference signals for all antennas are allocated in the first and second OFDM symbols.<br>

[225] A sub-frame can be divided by two regions, a control channel and a data channel. T<br>
he control channel is the region carrying control data. The data channel is the region<br>
carrying user data. For example, a first OFDM symbol, a second OFDM symbol and a<br>
third OFDM symbol may be allocated for the control channel and the other OFDM<br>
symbols mat be allocated for the data channel. Although the number of OFDM<br>
symbols for the control channel is smaller than that of OFDM symbols for the control<br>
channel, the reliability for the control channel has to be higher than that of the data<br>
channel. Only a part of multiple antennas can be assigned for transmitting the control<br>
channel. A first antenna and a second antenna can be used for the control channel. In<br>
this case, reference signals for a third antenna and reference signals for a fourth<br>
antenna may not be assigned for the OFDM symbols for the control channel because<br>
the third antenna and the fourth antenna are not used for the control channel.<br>

[255] FIG. 83 illustrates an example of a reference signal allocation for a multi-user signal.<br>
[256] Referring to FIG. 83, R denotes a reference signal for a multi-user signal. The<br>
reference signal R may be used for any antenna. In the case of using two antennas, R<br>
may denote either a reference signal for the first antenna or a reference signal for the<br>
second antenna. A blank resource element may be a data symbol or a null symbol.<br>
[257] In one sub-frame, the reference signals T1 for the first antenna are allocated at the<br>
interval of six sub-carriers in the first OFDM symbol. That is, the reference signals T1<br>
are allocated with five sub-carriers therebetween. The reference signals T2 for the<br>
second antenna are allocated at the same interval as the first reference signals T1 so as<br>
not to overlap the first reference signals T1 in the same OFDM symbols. That is, the<br>
reference signals T2 are placed between the two references signals T1 at the same<br>
interval as the first reference signals T1.<br>
[258] The reference signals R are allocated staring from positions where dedicated control<br>
signals are not allocated, for example, from the third OFDM symbol. That is, the<br>
reference signals R are allocated at the interval of two sub-carriers in the third OFDM<br>
