				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MANAGING VERSIONS OF VARIOUS<br>
APPLICATION INFORMATION MESSAGES AND USING THE APPLICATION<br>
INFORMATION MESSAGES<br>
1.	Technical Field<br>
The present invention is related to a method and apparatus for providing messages<br>
carrying a variety of application information needed for operation of public transportation<br>
means or vehicles and using the provided information.<br>
2.	Background Art<br>
As various car navigation devices and portable wireless terminals for personal use are<br>
widely spread, traffic information guide is becoming a major topic for car drivers. A current<br>
navigation device (or a portable wireless terminal for personal use) provides drivers (or<br>
individuals) with application services such as route guidance for vehicle operation based on a map<br>
and GPS system. In ordinary circumstances, such services are provided based on a map<br>
embedded in a receiving device, local information and coordinate information received from<br>
GPS.<br>
Being in such a situation, TPEG (Transport Protocol Experts Group) technology<br>
gaining much attention recently provides a basic framework whereby various services for<br>
individual local areas including traffic conditions, traffic accidents, parking information, local<br>
information (spatial information about structures located at fixed positions such as restaurants,<br>
buildings, and public facilities or spaces) and public transportation information are provided<br>
dirough various media channels (e.g., TV or radio broadcast channel).<br>
A specific application service based on TPEG technology comprises transmitting<br>
TPEG-messages having a structure illustrated in Fig. 1 to a terminal and the terminal's<br>
interpreting the TPEG-messages, thereby providing an information service for the user. The<br>
TPEG message of Fig. 1 selectively includes a message management container 10A carrying<br>
version information for managing TPEG messages, an application status container 10B carrying<br>
application information distinguished for individual applieation services, and a TPEG location<br>
container 10C carrying information about location where a service is provided.<br>
Various application services that can be provided by utilizing TPEG technology include<br>
TPEG-SNI (Service and Network Information), TPEG-RTM (Road Traffic Message), and<br>
TPEG-CTT (Congestion and Travel-Time). The services are all transmitted through TPEG<br>
message structure of Fig. 1 and specific application information is carried by the application<br><br>
status container 10B.<br>
Meanwhile, the message management container 10A (hereinafter, it is called .'MMC for<br>
short) transfers management information about the corresponding TPEG message having the<br>
structure shown in Fig. 2.<br>
The MMC structure of Fig. 2 illustrates that of a TPEG-RTM service among<br>
application services based on TPEG. MMCs for other application services also have a message<br>
identifier (Message ID), a version number for managing information update, length, and a<br>
selector as necessary items. The message ID is used to distinguish each individual TPEG message<br>
and the version number is used to keep each message up-to-date, length provides the length of<br>
the total message to show the size of valid data and the selector is used to transfer necessary<br>
information in accordance with the corresponding message. Up to eight fields are employed, each<br>
of which is associated with the corresponding bit of the select. In the example of Fig. 2, these<br>
fields include start time, stop time, and message expiry time, which are varied according to type<br>
of an application service utilizing TPEG technology. TPEG components, the last field of the<br>
selector (a field accompanying when the most significant bit of the selector is 1), comprises<br>
components carrying a plurality of service information and thus constitutes the application status<br>
container 10B mentioned above, each component including data used for an actual service.<br>
While application information is provided using the above structure, transfer of<br>
information is carried out in the form of the same structure at each time of transfer. Therefore,<br>
' when part of application information provided for a terminal is changed (or when new<br>
information is added), for example when part of local information is changed, a TPEG message<br>
including not only a component or components carrying the changed contents but also<br>
components carrying the contents of unchanged local information is organized and transmitted.<br>
At this time, a value higher than the version number included in MMC of a previously<br>
transmitted TPEG message is assigned to the version number of MMC (for example, if previous<br>
transmitted version number is "1.0.0.", "1.0.1" is assigned and transmitted). This implies that<br>
updated information is present in the information transmitted by a TPEG message of the<br>
corresponding application service transferred previously.<br>
Accordingly, when the terminal receives a TPEG message having a higher value than<br>
the version number of a previously received TPEG message, the terminal decodes all the<br>
information accompanying the message and updates previously decoded information and<br>
displays the information for the user in case of need.<br>
Although only part of the information transmitted by a TPEG message has been<br>
updated, since the above method, based on a version number of MMC higher than a previous<br>
one, decodes all the received components and regards, stores, and uses the decoded components<br>
as updated information, resources (such as computing power, etc) more than needed are wasted<br>
to obtain actually updated information.<br><br>
3. Disclosure of the Invention<br>
One objective of the present invention is to provide application service information for<br>
a terminal to effectively obtain updated information.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to enable much more amount of diverse<br>
i   application service information to be provided more quickly within limited resources of<br>
communications.<br>
One method for encoding application information according to the present invention<br>
comprises creating at least one component including application information and version<br>
information of the at least one component, writing, in a message management container where<br>
management information about the at least one component is written, information indicating<br>
accompaniment of the version information, and organizing the at least one component, the<br>
version information and the message management container to a transfer message.<br>
One method for decoding application information according to the present invention<br>
comprises extracting from received signals a transfer message including at least one component<br>
carrying application information, checking a selector indicating accompaniment of information<br>
recorded in a message management container in the extracted transfer message, and extracting<br>
identifying information and version information for identifying the at least one component from<br>
the transfer message according to the checked value of the selector.<br>
In one embodiment according to the present invention, the version information is<br>
created with a one-to-one correspondence to identifying information of a component and is<br>
included in the message management container.<br>
In one embodiment according to the present invention, information for identifying a<br>
component is an ID assigned to a component, classified according to type of information carried<br>
by the component<br>
In one embodiment according to the present invention, the version information and<br>
identifying information of a component are recorded put together at a component management<br>
information unit within the message management container.<br>
In the one embodiment, the component management information unit further includes<br>
information about information type and information about the number of components.<br>
In one embodiment according to the present invention, the information about<br>
information type is used to indicate whether all or only part of at least one component belonging<br>
to a transfer message includes updated information.<br>
In one embodiment according to the present invention, when deletion of information<br>
transferred by a component included in the above transfer message is requested, the version<br>
information is assigned a particular value and thus transferred.<br>
In one embodiment according to the present invention, one bit value of the selector<br>
included in the message management container indicates whether version information about the<br><br>
at least one component is included.<br>
In one embodiment according to the present invention, another bit of the selector is<br>
used to indicate whether information about time including creation and/or expiry time of the at<br>
least one component accompanies.<br>
In one embodiment according to the present invention, yet another bit of the selector is<br>
used to indicate whedier management information distinguished according to application services<br>
is included put together in the message management container.<br>
In one embodiment according to the present invention, the application information is<br>
information needed for vehicle operation, service information of a public transportation means<br>
or information about a local area.<br>

5. Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Hereinafter, according to the present invention, preferred embodiments will be<br>
described in detail with reference to appended drawings.<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates a network where version of application service information is managed<br>
so that information services are provided. In the network of Fig. 3, an application information<br>
providing server 100 in a broadcast station classifies and organizes information about congestion<br>
and road conditions (e.g., obstacles on the road) collected from various sources (e.g., operator<br>
input, information received from another server through a network 101 or probe cars), parking<br>
information and public transportation information with respect to each individual application<br>
information and transmits the organized information wirelessly so that a navigation terminal<br>
installed in a car 201 or an information terminal 200 carried by the user can receive the<br>
information. An information originator organizing a variety of application information and a<br>
carrier transmitting the organized information wirelessly can be different service providers.<br>
The application information providing server 100 can also provide a variety of other<br>
application information (e.g., weather and local information associated with traffic) in addition to<br>
previously illustrated application information. Alternatively, the application information providing<br>
server 100 provides only congestion and travel-time (CTT) information while other application<br>
information is provided through a different server.<br>
The MMC of a TPEG message carrying application information organized and<br>
transferred by the application information providing server 100 or the different server is written<br>
according to the structure illustrated in Fig. 4. The MMC structure of Fig. 4 has a selector whose<br>
bits have the corresponding accompanying fields different from those of Fig. 2.<br>
To describe the MMC structure of Fig. 4 specifically, the least significant bit (bO) of a<br>
selector indicates accompaniment of a time-related information unit<br>
(<time_related_information>) 401 integrating time information for message management<br>
organized according to the syntax illustrated in Fig. 5A. The next significant bit (bl) indicates<br>
accompaniment of a specific information unit (<application_specific_information>) 203<br>
organized according to the syntax of Fig. 5C with respect to characteristics of an individual<br>
application service, being provided independently of subsequent components.<br>
As the application information providing server 100 organizes MMC of a TPEG<br>
message for each individual application service as shown in Fig. 4, redundancy occurs in the bits<br>
of a selector as compared with a method of Fig. 2. Therefore, by assigning more information<br><br>
needed for message management and relating the information with specific redundant bits, a<br>
possibility for much effective management of messages is left open.<br>
The time-related information unit illustrated in Fig. 5A is an example defined with<br>
respect to a TPEG-RTM service; in case of a different application service, internal elements<br>
defined can be somewhat different from those of Fig. 5A. However, irrespective of type of an<br>
application service based on TPEG, one single bit is used for a field indicating accompaniment<br>
of information related with time of a TPEG message such as creation, expiry or valid time of a<br>
TPEG message. In one embodiment according to the present invention, time-related information,<br>
too, is recorded put together in a single field within MMC as shown in Fig. 5A according to die<br>
value of a bit (bO) of a selector instead of being added individually as shown in Fig. 2 according<br>
to the value of each bit of a selector within MMC.<br>
The foregoing description applies equally to the case of a specific information unit of<br>
Fig. 5C. That is tp say, specific information provided separately from a component, die<br>
information being varied according to each individual application service, is recorded put<br>
together in a single field within MMC as shown in Fig. 5C according to the value of a bit (b2) of<br>
a selector instead of being added individually according to respective bits of a selector as shown<br>
in Fig. 2.<br>
In one embodiment according to the present invention, actual data according to an<br>
individual application service, namely a component management information unit organized<br>
according to the syntax illustrated in Fig. 5B, including version information about individual<br>
components carrying application data, is included in an MMC and provided. At this point, a<br>
specific bit of a selector, for example bl is set as illustrated in Fig. 4.<br>
A component management information unit of Fig. 5B includes an information type<br>
identifier (ID) indicating type of information carried by the unit and more than one component<br>
information unit including version information assigned in correspondence to a component ID.<br>
The information type ID 501 indicates whether a component or components following MMC<br>
within a TPEG message carry only updated information. For example, if the information type<br>
ID 501 is 1, it indicates that a subsequent component or components carry information<br>
composing entirely of updated application information whereas it indicates subsequent<br>
components carry the same information as transferred previously in addition to updated<br>
information if the information type ID 501 is 0. A specific example of the above is described in<br>
detail below.<br>
Fig. 6 illustrates a structure of a component management information unit organized<br>
and transferred by the application information providing server 100 according to the syntax<br>
illustrated in Fig. 5B. As shown in the figure, each component information unit 601 includes<br>
information about a component ID 601A and a component version 601B. The component ID<br>
unit 601A records an ID identifying a particular component ota component carrying specific<br><br>
type of information. The component carrying specific type of information can be a component<br>
carrying local information, a component carrying average speed information about a road<br>
segment, or a component carrying location information of a station for a public transportation<br>
means. As a matter of course, in addition to the above, the component ID unit 601A is used to<br>
identify a component carrying information belonging to a certain type of information among<br>
various types of application information provided from an application service. Version<br>
information carried by the version unit 601B represents a version of application information<br>
transferred being carried by a component or components specified by the component ID 601A.<br>
Therefore, the application information providing server 100, to organize an initial<br>
TPEG message for an arbitrary application service, assigns a version to each component carrying<br>
application data included in the TPEG message and loads information about the assigned version<br>
to the component management information unit and transfers the information. Fig. 7 illustrates a<br>
TPEG message transferred according to the above with respect to a component management<br>
information unit.<br>
In the example of Fig. 7, in case of transfer of an initial TPEG message in the<br>
corresponding application service, information carried by individual components accompanying<br>
MMC should be considered as the latest information by a terminal. Therefore, information type<br>
ID 711 in a component management information unit 710 transferred to assign a version to each<br>
component is also assigned a value (e.g., 1) to indicate that all the components in a TPEG<br>
message carry the latest information. It is obvious, however that in case of transfer of an initial<br>
TPEG message, since an information receiving terminal does not keep the version of a<br>
previously received component, irrespective of an actual version of a component, the<br>
component would be regarded to be of the latest version. Therefore, for the case of transfer of<br>
an initial TPEG message, the information type ID 711 can be assigned a value (e.g., 0) indicating<br>
that only part of the TPEG message carries the latest information.<br>
In the example of Fig. 7, each component information unit in the component<br>
management information unit 710 includes information for assigning a version to each ID of<br>
components transferred being carried by an application status container subsequent to MMC 720.<br>
Although the example of Fig. 7 assumes one-to-one correspondence between components and<br>
component IDs for intuitive understanding, it is obvious that one ID can correspond to multiple<br>
components for providing actual application services. This is because a component ID is used to<br>
designate a component carrying a specific type of application information (e.g. section average<br>
speed, section travel time, service route information of an arrival bus for each bus stop) and a<br>
specific type of information can be transferred being divided into several components. The<br>
above description applies in the same manner to the following description.<br>
After transfer of an initial TPEG message as illustrated in Fig. 7, if changes occur in the<br>
contents of information carried by components constituting part of the TPEG message (e.g.,<br><br>
part of local information, toad congestion information, road obstacle information, or public<br>
transportation information) or if new information has to be provided by a component to which a<br>
new ID has been assigned, as shown in Fig. 8A, the application information providing server 100,<br>
with respect to a component carrying changed information (or new information), e.g., a<br>
component with an ID 2, loads MMC with a component management information unit including<br>
a component information unit 811 having a higher version than a previously assigned version<br>
"1.0" (e.g., "1.1") and thus transfers the component. At this point, version information in MMC<br>
801 can also be transferred with a higher value (e.g., "1.0.1") than that of a previously transferred<br>
TPEG message. This is intended for a terminal to know the existence of updated information<br>
(or new information) in the information carried by a received TPEG message without decoding a<br>
component management information unit. In another embodiment according to the present<br>
invention, a terminal always decodes a component management information unit and if part of<br>
components included in a TPEG message includes changed information, the same version as<br>
MMC version of a previous TPEG message is used.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 8A, in an embodiment wherein a component including updated<br>
information is provided, since only part of components in a TPEG message being transferred<br>
includes updated information, to notify of the above, the application information providing<br>
server 100 records a value of 0 in information type ID 812 within a component management<br>
information unit<br>
In another embodiment according to the present invention, only such a component<br>
including updated or new information is included in a TPEG message and thus transferred. Fig.<br>
8B illustrates an example of a message organized and transferred by the application information<br>
providing server 100 according to the present invention. As shown in Fig. 8A, if only the<br>
contents of information carried by part of components in a previously transferred TPEG<br>
message (namely, a component of an ID 2) have been changed from those of a previous TPEG<br>
message (or if a component including new information has to be provided by assigning a new ID<br>
(e.g., "k+1") to the component), the component including changed information (or new<br>
information) is transferred being included in a status container as shown in Fig. 8B and at the<br>
same time, only a component information unit of ID 2 820A is included in a component<br>
management information unit 820. At this time, a version assigned to the component<br>
information unit 820A has a higher value (e.g., "1.1") than that assigned earlier to the<br>
corresponding component Also, since a TPEG message and the component management<br>
information unit 820 being transferred include only such a component carrying changed or new<br>
information and version information about the component respectively, a value of '1' is recorded<br>
for information type ID 820B within the component management information unit 820 to<br>
indicate the above and thus transferred.<br>
Since the entire contents of a TPEG message being transferred carry changed or new<br><br>
information with respect to a previously transferred TPEG message, the application information<br>
providing server 100 assigns a version value to a version field of a message management<br>
container 821, e.g., "1.0.1" higher than that transferred previously.<br>
Since provision of application information according to the present embodiment makes<br>
date size small on the average, a high transfer frequency can be implemented within limited<br>
transmission bandwidth. This immediately enables the user who uses the corresponding<br>
application service to obtain the latest information more quickly.<br>
In the embodiments according to the present invention, in order for a terminal not to<br>
use information provided by a previously transmitted component, a command for requesting<br>
deletion of a component with the corresponding ID can be transferred through a component<br>
management information unit For example, if information provided by an arbitrary component<br>
among components provided through a TPEG message becomes unnecessary information after<br>
particular time (e.g., midnight) or termination of a particular accident (e.g., removal of road<br>
blockage), it is necessary to delete information provided through the component after the<br>
particular time or termination of the particular accident In this case, the application information<br>
providing server 100, as shown in Fig. 8C, loads ID (j in Fig. 8C) assigned to a component<br>
carrying the information to be deleted and a component information unit carrying in a version<br>
field 831 an invalid value for a version (e.g., OxFF) into the component management information<br>
unit and transfers the above. At this point, a component with the corresponding ID is not<br>
contained in a subsequent status container.<br>
Fig. 9 illustrates a structure of a terminal according to one embodiment of the present<br>
invention, receiving application information (this application information is either one of a<br>
variety of application information such as road congestion information, road obstacle<br>
information and service status information of a public transportation means or combination<br>
thereof) organized and transferred by the application information providing server 100 according<br>
to a method described with reference to Figs. 4, 5A through 5C, 6, 7, and/or 8A through 8C, the<br>
terminal carried by a person or installed in a car.<br>
The terminal (200 or a navigation device installed in a car 201) of Fig. 9 comprises a<br>
tuner 1 resonating at the required frequency band of a specified application information service<br>
and subsequendy outputting modulated application information signals, a demodulator 2<br>
outputting application service signals by demodulating the modulated application information<br>
signals in an appropriate manner, a TPEG decoder 3 decoding the demodulated application<br>
service information signals and acquiring application information, a GPS module 8 for<br>
calculating a current position (i.e., latitude, longitude, and altitude) by receiving signals from a<br>
plurality of satellites, memory 4 pre-storing a variety of graphic information and temporarily<br>
storing necessary information, an input device 9 receiving the user's input, a controller 5<br>
controlling screen display based on the user's input, current location, and acquired application<br><br>
information, an LCD panel 7 for video display and an LCD drive 6 feeding driving signals to the<br>
LCD panel 7 according to graphic data for display. The input device 9 can be a touch screen .<br>
equipped on the LCD panel 7. The terminal (200 or a navigation device installed in a car 201) can<br>
be further equipped with non-volatile memory containing an electronic map in addition to the<br>
   memory 4.<br>
The tuner 1 resonates at signals that the application information providing server 100<br>
(or a carrier that receives and transmits application information organized by the application<br>
information providing server 100) transmits; the demodulator 2 demodulates and outputs<br>
resonating signals in a manner specified by the controller 5. The TPEG decoder 3 then decodes<br>
application information provided by input demodulated signals and delivers the decoded<br>
information to the controller 5.<br>
The TPEG decoder 3 extracts a TPEG message from demodulated signals from the<br>
decoding process and checks MMC organized as in Fig. 4 first If a version field (ver) of the<br>
MMC has a value lower than that previously decoded and stored to the TPEG decoder 3, a status<br>
container including subsequent components is not decoded but ignored.<br>
Since it indicates reception of an initial TPEG message when no version information is<br>
found to be stored in the TPEG decoder 3, a value of a version field (ver) within a message<br>
management container identified at this time is stored in the TPEG decoder 3; the TPEG<br>
decoder 3 then checks ID and version information about each component carried by a<br>
component management information unit within the container, thereby storing the ID and<br>
version information in a form of a table by associating each other as a pair as shown in Fig. 10.<br>
Surely, at this point, subsequent components are all decoded and information acquired from the<br>
decoding is transferred to the controller 5.<br>
Unless the value of a version field (ver) within MMC is lower than that previously<br>
decoded and stored in the TPEG decoder 3, information carried by a component management<br>
information unit organized as shown in Fig. 6 within the MMC is investigated and it is<br>
determined whether to decode a component or part of subsequent components. If a received<br>
TPEG message is organized as shown in Fig. 8A and information type ID in a component<br>
management information unit is indicating that updated information is present only in some part<br>
of subsequent components (e.g., if information type ID is 0), the TPEG decoder 3 compares ID<br>
and a version value carried by each individual component information unit within the component<br>
management information unit with a version value stored in association with the same ID in the<br>
table constructed as shown in Fig. 10. If a received version value is higher than a stored value or<br>
if an ID identical to a received component ID is not stored already in the table constructed as<br>
shown in Fig. 10, the TPEG decoder 3 decodes among subsequent components only such a<br>
component that has the corresponding ID with a high version value (or a new ID received for<br>
the first time) and transfers application information contained in the component to the controller<br><br>
Therefore, when a version is not provided with respect to each component ID, as the<br>
TPEG decoder 3 decodes all the received components and delivers the decoded components to<br>
the controller 5, thereby overwriting previously stored information, operations leading to waste<br>
of computing power are prevented. For the case of decoding with respect to some component<br>
ID as above, a version value higher (e.g., "1.1") dian a previous value received in accordance with<br>
the ID is either recorded by updating the corresponding version field S1101 or added to a table<br>
constructed as shown in Fig. 10 by associating the ID with the received version value as a single<br>
entry.<br>
If a received TPEG message is organized as shown in Fig. 8B and information type ID<br>
within a component management information unit is indicating that subsequent components all<br>
include updated information (e.g., if information type ID is 1), all the subsequent components (as<br>
many components as the number recorded in a number of components field 820C of a<br>
component management information unit of Fig. 8B) are decoded and application information<br>
acquired from the above is provided for the controller 5. Also, the TPEG decoder 3 updates a<br>
version value of each component information unit within the component management<br>
information unit and records the value in a version field within the table of Fig. 10 corresponding<br>
to the same ID. As a matter of course, before decoding and updating a version field as described<br>
above, whether a version value carried by each component information unit is higher than that<br>
stored in a pair with the ID identical to the corresponding ID of the version value can be<br>
checked. Unless the version value is found high, decoding and updating a version value as<br>
described above are not carried out, which is intended to avoid fault in organizing information<br>
from the application information providing server 100.<br>
The controller 5, from decoded application information received from the TPEG<br>
decoder 3, constructs an application information table in the memory 4 in a form appropriate to<br>
provide for the user. At this time, constructed application information also contains the ID of a<br>
component that carried the information, the ID being delivered from the TPEG decoder 3.<br>
If the user requests specific information, e.g., 'public transportation information' from<br>
the application information constructed in the memory 4, through the input device 9, the<br>
controller 5 displays a menu related to public transportation information on the LCD panel 7. At<br>
this point, a menu screen can be organized based on position information obtained from the<br>
GPS module 8. With regard to stations, for example, a list consisting of only those stations close<br>
to a current position can be prepared and provided as a station selection window.<br>
If the user enters additional information, e.g., a service route number (or a station)<br>
from a menu displayed on the LCD panel 7 through a relevant UI, the controller 5 searches the<br>
memory 4 and obtains information about each station (or each transit service route) constructed<br>
in the memory 4 and displays station names (or ID of each transit service route and service route<br><br>
information) on a screen together with a service route ID and service route information. At this<br>
time, if different type of information is associated with a table constructed in the memory 4, the<br>
information can also be provided together.<br>
Selection of public transportation information and contents of information provided<br>
by the controller 5 according to the selection are nothing but a simple example. Contents of the<br>
above information carried by each component are not necessarily required for the present<br>
invention and management of a version for each individual component as described above and<br>
operations according thereto can be applied immediately by following instructions described<br>
above independent of application information being loaded into a component Therefore, a case<br>
where the contents of application information carried by a component are different from those<br>
illustrated to help understanding the present invention should also be considered to belong to the<br>
scope suggested in the principles and purpose of the present invention.<br>
While receiving and storing the information described above and information display<br>
according to a request of the user are being carried out, if a component information unit, being<br>
organized as illustrated in Fig. 8C and demanding deletion of information provided by a<br>
component of a particular ID, is received being included within MMC, the TPEG decoder 3<br>
interprets a command for deleting a version field, processes remaining information except for a<br>
component information unit 830 including the deletion command according to the procedure<br>
described above and extracts a component ID recorded in the component information unit 830,<br>
thereby providing an internal command for requesting information deletion for the controller 5<br>
along with the extracted ID. The controller 5 then carries out an operation of deleting application<br>
information stored in association with a received ID from among an application information<br>
table constructed and managed by the controller 5. Since the deletion operation invokes an<br>
operation for de-allocating an area of the memory 4 where the corresponding information has<br>
been stored, the released area can be used again for another received information.<br>
The present invention described in detail through a limited number of embodiments<br>
above, when update of application information or transfer of new application information<br>
through a new component is requested frequently, enables to transfer only the corresponding<br>
application information, thereby achieving effective utilization of limited transfer resources and<br>
also enables a terminal to selectively decode only those data having updated or newly added<br>
application information, thereby achieving effective utilization of resources of the terminal and<br>
prompt processing of information.<br>
The foregoing description of a preferred embodiment of the present invention has<br>
been presented for purposes of illustration. Thus, those skilled in the art may utilize the<br>
