The invention provides a detergent composition containing any of the above shown granular anionic surfactants and use of any of the above shown granular anionic surfactants as a detergent<br>
Detailed explanation of the invention<br>
In JP-A 54-106428 and JP-A 5-331496, however, fine powder of the anionic surfactant occurs on the surfaces of particles through adhesion etc , and may generate dust in handling and transportation  In this case, even if the fine powder is removed by a vibrating classification screen or an air classifier, the treatment time is prolonged because of a relatively large amount of fine powder, which may result m<br>
disintegration of the particles to generate fine powder Particularly when the surfaces of the particles are not smooth, dust is generated upon rubbing the particles against one another in handling and transportation, and the outward appearance, such as transparency or lustrous appearance, of such particles does not satisfy the consumer' s sense of beauty<br>
A purpose of the present invention is to provide a granular anionic surfactant of low dust generation and having an excellent appearance and a detergent composition blended with the same<br>
According to the present invention, there can be obtained a granular anionic surfactant having transparency and lustrous appearance, having a smooth surface, with suppressed dust generation In addition, a granular anionic surfactant of low dust generation can be obtained by establishing the preferable temperature condition in a stirring granulator having a stirring blade, without compounding other agents and without surface treatment  Further, a detergent composition compounded with the granular anionic surfactant of low dust generation and having an excellent appearance can be obtained [Anionic surfactant]<br>

When the number of carbon atoms in R1 and R2 in formulae (I) and (II) is relatively small, caking properties upon powdering tend to be lowered, while when the number of carbon atoms therein is too large, performance such as powder solubility etc  tends to be lowered, and thus the number of carbon atoms is preferably 8 to 20, more preferably 10 to 18 AO is preferably an oxyalkylene group wherein the number of carbon atoms is 2 to 4, particularly 2 m is 0 to 2, preferably 0 to 1, more preferably 0 to 0 8, from the viewpoint of giving excellent powder characteristics and improving the caking<br>

The granular anionic surfactant obtained by the method of the present invention is characterized in that the surfactant has a very transparency and lustrous appearance,<br>

and tapped 10 times with a Ro-Tap type screen shaker, and the degree of passage is determined according to the following equation<br>
Degree of passage (%) = [weight of powder having passed (g)/weight of the whole sample (g)]*100 <fluidity time></fluidity>
The fluidity time is defined as the time required for 100 mL powder to flow out through a hopper for bulk density measurement prescribed in JIS K 3362 <surface smoothness></surface>
In the present invention, the granular anionic surfactant excellent in surface smoothness refers to the one having a surface roughness of 1 0 µm or less, more preferably 0 8 µm or less A surfactant of lower surface roughness works effectively to improve dust generation, caking properties and fluidity<br>
The surface roughness described in the present invention is an arithmetic average roughness (Ra) prescribed m JIS B 0601-1994, which refers to an average value determined by filtering an image taken with a measurement resolution of 0 02 um with a 50-power lens (type, simple average, size, 5x5 pixels, number of times, 2) , and then measuring 6 sites (cutoff value, 0 08 mm, evaluation length, 0 48 mm) selected at random from an upper part of a particle<br>
The surface smoothness measuring device used in measurement is not particularly limited insofar as the minimum measurement resolution of 0 01 µm is satisfied, and for example,<br>
a super deepness shape measuring microscope VK-8500 (manufactured by KEYENCE) can be used<br>
The analysis method is not particularly limited, and for example VK shape analysis software (manufactured by KEYENCE) can be used <average particle diameter></average>
The average particle diameter is determined from weight distribution by the size of screen opening after vibration of a sample on a standard screen in JIS Z 8801 (opening 2000 to 45 urn) for 5 minutes <bulk density></bulk>
The bulk density is measured according to a method prescribed in JIS K 3362 [Other components]<br>
