				<td>SUBSTITUTED (El-STYRYL BENZYLSULFONES FOR TREATING PROL1FERATIVE DISORDERS<br>
The benefit of the filing date of U, S. Provisional Application Serial No. 60/238,222, filed October 5, 2000, is hereby claimed. The entire disclosure of the aforesaid application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to compositions and methods for the treatment of cancer and other proliferative disorders.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Extracellular signals received at transmembrane receptors are relayed into the cells by the signal transduction pathways (Pelech et a/., Science 257:1335 (1992)) which have been implicated in a wide array of physiological processes such as induction of cell proliferation, differentiation or apoptosis (Davis et a/., J. Biol. Chem. 268:14553 (1993)). The Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) cascade is a major signaling system by which cells transduce extracellular cues into intracellular responses (Nishida et a/., Trends Biochem. Sci. 18:128 (1993); Blumer et a/., Trends Biochem. Sci. 19:236 (1994)). Many steps of this cascade are conserved, and homologous for MAP kinases have been discovered in different species.<br><br>
In mammalian cells, the Extracellular-Signal-Regulated Kinases (ERKs), ERK-1 and ERK-2 are the archetypal and best-studied members of the MARK family, which all have the unique feature of being activated by phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine residues by an upstream dual specificity kinase (Posada etal., Science 255:212 (1992); Biggs III et a/., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:6295 (1992); Garner et a/., Genes Dev. 6:1280 (1992)).<br>
Recent studies have identified an additional subgroup of MAPKs, known as c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases 1 and 2 (JNK-1 and JNK-2), that have different substrate specificities and are regulated by different stimuli (Hibi et a/., Genes Dev. 7:2135 (1993)). JNKs are members of the class of stress-activated protein kinases (SPKs). JNKs have been shown to be activated by treatment of cells with UV radiation, pro-inflammatory cytokines and environmental stress (Derijard et a/., Cell 1025 (1994)). The activated JNK binds to the amino terminus of the c-Jun protein and increases the protein's transcriptional activity by phosphorylating it at ser63 and ser73 (Adler etal., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:5341 (1992); Kwok et a/., Nature 370:223 (1994)).<br>
Analysis of the deduced primary sequence of the JNKs indicates that they are distantly related to ERKs (Davis, Trends Biochem. Sci. 19:470 (1994)). Both ERKs and JNKs are phosphorylated on Tyr and Thr in response to external stimuli resulting in their activation (Davis, Trends Biochem. Sci. 19:470 (1994)). The phosphorylation (Thr and Tyr) sites, which play a critical role in their activation are conserved between ERKs and JNKs (Davis, Trends Biochem. Sci. 19:470 (1994)). However, these sites of phosphorylation are located within distinct dual phosphorylation motifs: Thr-Pro-Tyr (JNK) and Thr-Glu-Tyr (ERK). Phosphorylation of MAPKs and JNKs by an external signal often involves the activation of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) (Gille et a/., Nature 358:414 (1992)), which constitute a large family of proteins encompassing several growth factor receptors and other signal transducing molecules.<br><br>
Protein tyrosine kinases are enzymes which catalyze a well defined chemical reaction: the phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue (Hunter et at, Annu Rev Biochem 54:897 (1985)). Receptor tyrosine kinases in particular are attractive targets for drug design since blockers for the substrate domain of these kinases is likely to yield an effective and selective antiproliferative agent. The potential use of protein tyrosine kinase blockers as antiproliferative agents was recognized as early as 1981, when quercetin was suggested as a PTK blocker (Graziani et at, Eur. J. Biochem. 135:583-589 (1983)).<br>
The best understood MARK pathway involves extracellular signal regulated kinases which constitute the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK kinase cascade (Boudewijn era/., Trends Biochem. Sci. 20, 18 (1995)). Once this pathway is activated by different stimuli, MARK phosphorylates a variety of proteins including several transcription factors which translocate into the nucleus and activate gene transcription. Negative regulation of this pathway could arrest the cascade of these events.<br>
What are needed are new anticancer chemotherapeutic agents which target • receptor tyrosine kinases and which arrest the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK kinase cascade. Oncoproteins in general, and signal transducing proteins in particular, are likely to be more selective targets for chemotherapy because they represent a subclass of proteins whose activities are essential for cell proliferation, and because their activities are greatly amplified in proliferative diseases.<br>
What is also needed are new cell antiproliferative agents, and anticancer therapeutics in particular, which are highly selective in the killing of proliferating cells such as tumor cells, but not normal cells.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
According to the present invention, certain substituted styryl benzylsulfone derivatives selectively kill various tumor cell types without killing normal cells.<br>
Without wishing to be bound by any theory, it is believed that the compounds affect the MARK signal transduction pathway, thereby affecting tumor cell growth and viability. This cell growth inhibition is associated with regulation of the ERK and JNK types of MARK. Without wishing to be bound by any theory, the styryl sulfones of the present invention may block the phosphorylating capacity of ERK-2.<br>
The compounds of the invention inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells by inducing cell death.<br>
The compounds of the invention are believed effective against broad spectrum of cancer types of diverse histologic subtype and origin. Cancer types which may be treated by the present compounds include those cancers listed and described in the National Cancer Institute's "CancerNet" at http://cancemet.nci.nih.gov/pdq/pdq_treatment.shtnU which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
For example, the compounds of the invention may be used to kill primary or metastatic tumor or neoplastic cells in cancers of at least the following histologic subtypes: sarcoma (cancers of the connective and other tissue of mesodermal origin); melanoma (cancers deriving from pigmented melanocytes); carcinoma (cancers of epithelial origin); adenocarcinoma (cancers of glandular epithelial origin); cancers of neural origin (glioma/glioblastoma and astrocytoma); and hematological neoplasias, such as leukemias and lymphomas (e.g., acute iymphoblastic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and chronic myelocytic leukemia).<br>
The present compounds may also be used to kill primary or metastatic tumor or neoplastic cells in cancers having their origin in at<br><br>
least the following organs or tissues, regardless of histologic subtype: breast; tissues of the male and female urogenital system (e.g. ureter, bladder, prostate, testis, ovary, cervix, uterus, vagina); lung; tissues of the gastrointestinal system (e.g., stomach, large and small intestine, colon, rectum); exocrine glands such as the pancreas and adrenals; tissues of the mouth and esophagus; brain and spinal cord; kidney (renal); pancreas; hepatobiliary system (e.g., liver, gall bladder); lymphatic system; smooth and striated muscle; bone and bone marrow; skin; and tissues of the eye.<br>
Furthermore, the present compounds are believed effective in<br>
treating cancers or tumors in any prognostic stage of development, as<br>
measured, for example, by the "Overall Stage Groupings" (also called<br>
"Roman Numeral") or the Tumor, Nodes, and Metastases (TNM) staging<br>
systems. Appropriate prognostic staging systems and stage descriptions<br>
for a given cancer are known in the art, for example as described in<br>
http://cancernet.nci.nih.gov/pdq/pdq_treatment.shtml, supra.	The<br>
compounds do not kill normal cells in concentrations at which tumor cells are killed.<br>
The compounds are also believed useful in the treatment of non-cancer proliferative disorders. Non-cancer proliferative disorders are characterized by the uncontrolled growth of cells with a benign phenotype, meaning that the cells evade only the normal controls on growth, but cannot metastasize. Non-cancer proliferative disorders which may be treated with the present compounds include, but are not limited to, the following: hemangiomatosis in newborn; secondary progressive multiple sclerosis; chronic progressive myelodegenerative disease; neurofibromatosis; ganglioneuromatosis; keloid formation; Pagefs Disease of the bone; fibrocystic disease (e.g., of the breast or uterus); sarcoidosis; Peronies and Duputren's fibrosis, cirrhosis, atherosclerosis and vascular restenosis.<br><br>
Treatment of this broad range of tumor cells with the styryl benzylsulfone compounds of the invention leads to inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptotic cell death.<br>
Tumor cells treated with the compounds of the invention accumulate in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. As the cells exit the G2/M phase, they appear to undergo apoptosis. Treatment of normal cells with the styryl benzylsulfones does not result in apoptosis.<br>
The (E)-styryl benzylsulfones of the present invention may be prepared by Knoevenagel condensation of aromatic aldehydes with benzylsulfonyl acetic acids. The procedure is described by Reddy et a/., Ada. Chim. Hung. 115:269-71 (1984); Reddy era/., Sulfur Letters 13:83-90 (1991); Reddy et a/., Synthesis No. 4, 322-323 (1984); and Reddy et a/., Sulfur Letters 7:43-48 (1987), the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
According to the Scheme 1 below, Ra represents mono- or di-substitution. Similarly, Rb represents mono- or di-substitution. The benzyl thioacetic acid B is formed by the reaction of sodium thioglycoliate and a benzyl chloride A. The benzyl thioacetic acid B is then oxidized with 30% hydrogen peroxide to give a corresponding benzylsulfonyl acetic acid C. Condensation of the benzylsulfonyl acetic acid C with an aromatic aldehyde D via a Knoevenagel reaction in the presence of benzylamine and glacial acetic acid yields the desired (E)-styryl benzylsulfone E.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
Scheme 1<br>
The following is a more detailed two-part synthesis procedure for preparing (E)-styryl benzylsulfones according to the above scheme.<br>
General Procedure 1: Synthesis (E)-Styryl Benzylsulfones Part A. To a solution of (8g, 0.2 mol) sodium hydroxide in methanol (200 ml), thioglycollic acid (0.1 mol) is added slowly and the precipitate formed is dissolved by stirring the contents of the flask. Then an appropriately substituted benzyl chloride (0.1 mol) is added stepwise and the reaction mixture is refluxed for 2-3 hours. The cooled contents are poured onto crushed ice and neutralized with dilute hydrochloric acid (200 ml). The resulting corresponding benzylthioacetic acid (0.1 mol) is subjected to oxidation with 30% hydrogen peroxide (0.12 mol) in glacial acetic acid (125 ml) by refluxing for 1 hour. The contents are cooled and poured onto crushed ice. The separated solid is recrystalized from hot water to give the corresponding pure benzylsulfonylacetic acid.<br>
Part B. A mixture of the benzylsulfonyl acetic acid (10 mmol), an appropriately substituted aromatic aldehyde (10 mmol), and benzylamine (200 ml) in glacial acetic acid (12 ml) is refluxed for 2-3 hours. The<br>
contents are cooled and treated with cold ether (50 ml). Any product precipitated out is separated by filtration. The filtrate is diluted with more ether and washed successively with a saturated solution of sodium bicarbonate (20 ml), sodium bisulfite (20 ml), dilute hydrochloric acid (20 ml) and finally with water (35 ml). Evaporation of the dried ethereal layer yields styryl benzylsulfones as a solid material.<br>
According to an alternative to Part A, the appropriate benzylsulfonylacetic acids may be generated by substituting a thioglycollate HSCHjCOOR for thioglycollic acid, where R is an alkyl group, typically C1-C6 alkyl. This leads to the formation of the alkylbenzylthioacetate intermediate (F),<br>
:H2SCH2COOR<br>
R<br>
Rfl<br>
which is then converted to the corresponding benzyl thioacetic acid B by alkaline or acid hydrolysis.<br>
The styryl benzylsulfone compounds of the present invention may be derivatized with a chemical group to permit conjugation to a carrier molecule, for the purpose of raising antibodies to the styryl sulfones. Suitable derivatizing chemistries are well known to those skilled in the art. Preferably, the derivative comprises a carboxylic acid derivative. The carrier may comprise any molecule sufficiently large to be capable of generating an immune response in an appropriate host animal. One such preferred carrier is keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH).<br>
The compounds of the present invention may take the form or pharmaceutically acceptable salts. The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salts", embraces salts commonly used to form alkali metal salts and to form addition salts of free acids or free bases. The nature of the salt is not critical, provided that it is pharmaceutically acceptable.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts may be prepared from an inorganic acid or from an organic acid. Examples of such inorganic acids are hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, nitric, carbonic, sulfuric and phosphoric acid. Appropriate organic acids may be selected from aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, aromatic, araliphatic, heterocyclic, carboxylic and sulfonic classes of organic acids, example of which are formic, acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, gluconic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, glucuronic, maleic, fumaric, pyruvic, aspartic, glutamic, benzoic, anthranilic, mesylic, salicyclic, salicyclic, 4-hydroxybenzoic, phenylacetic, mandelic, embonic (pamoic), methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic, pantothenic, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonic, toluenesulfonic, sulfanilic, cyclohexylaminosulfonic, stearic, algenic, beta-hydroxybutyric, salicyclic, galactaric and galacturonic acid. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts of compounds of formula I or II include metallic salts made from calcium, lithium, magnesium, potassium, sodium and zinc or organic salts made from N,N'-dibenzylethylenediamine, chloroprocaine, choline, diethanolamine, ethylenediamine, meglumine (N-methylglucamine) and procaine. All of these salts may be prepared by conventional means from the corresponding compound of formula I or II by reacting, for example, the appropriate acid or base with the compound of formula I or II.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be administered in the form of a pharmaceutical composition, in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The active ingredient in such formulations may comprise from 0.1 to 99.99 weight percent. By "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" is meant any carrier, diluent or excipient which is compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and to deleterious to the recipient.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be administered to individuals (mammals, including animals and humans) afflicted with cancer.<br>
The compounds are also useful in the treatment of non-cancer proliferate disorders, that is, proliferative disorders which are characterized by benign indications. Such disorders may also be known as "cytoproliferative" or "hyperproliferative" in that cells are made by the body at an atypically elevated rate, but do not escape normal position controls (i.e., have no metastatic potential). Such disorders include, but are not limited to, the following: hemangiomatosis in newborn; secondary progressive multiple sclerosis; chronic progressive myelodegenerative disease; neurofibromatosis; ganglioneuromatosis; keloid formation; Paget's Disease of the bone; fibrocystic disease (e.g., of the breast or uterus); sarcoidosis; Peronies and Duputren's fibrosis, cirrhosis, atherosclerosis and vascular restenosis.<br>
The compounds may be administered by any route, including oral and parenteral administration. Parenteral administration includes, for example, intravenous, intramuscular, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, intranasal, rectal, intravaginal, intravesical (e.g., to the bladder), intradermal, topical or subcutaneous administration. Also contemplated within the scope of the invention is the instillation of drug in the body of the patient in a controlled formulation, with systemic or local release of the drug to occur at a later time. For example, the drug may localized in a depot for controlled release to the circulation, or for release to a local site of tumor growth.<br>
The active agent is preferably administered with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier selected on the basis of the selected route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. The active agent may be formulated into dosage forms according to standard practices in the field of pharmaceutical preparations. See Alphonso Gennaro, ed., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed., (1990) Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA. Suitable dosage forms may comprise, for example, tablets, capsules, solutions, parenteral solutions, troches, suppositories, or suspensions.<br>
For parenteral administration, the active agent may be mixed with a suitable carrier or diluent such as water, an oil (particularly a vegetable oil), ethanol, saline solution, aqueous dextrose (glucose) and related sugar solutions, glycerol, or a glycol such as propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol. Solutions for parenteral administration preferably contain a water soluble salt of the active agent. Stabilizing agents, antioxidizing agents and preservatives may also be added. Suitable antioxidizing agents include sulfite, ascorbic acid, citric acid and its salts, and sodium EDTA. Suitable preservatives include benzalkonium chloride, methyl- or propyl-paraben, and chlorbutanol. The composition for parenteral administration may take the form of an aqueous or nonaqueous solution, dispersion, suspension or emulsion.<br>
For oral administration, the active agent may be combined with one or more solid inactive ingredients for the preparation of tablets, capsules, pills, powders, granules or other suitable oral dosage forms. For example, the active agent may be combined with at least one excipient such as fillers, binders, humectants, disintegrating agents, solution retarders, absorption accelerators, wetting agents absorbents or lubricating agents. According to one tablet embodiment, the active agent may be combined with carboxymethylcellulose calcium, magnesium stearate, mannitol and starch, and then formed into tablets by conventional tableting methods.<br>
The specific dose of compound according to the invention to obtain therapeutic benefit will, of course, be determined by the particular circumstances of the individual patient including, the size, weight, age and sex of the patient, the nature and stage of the disease, the aggressiveness of the disease, and the route of administration. For example, a daily dosage of from about 0.05 to about 50 mg/kg/day may be utilized. Higher or lower doses are also contemplated.<br>
