COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"INTERLEUKIN-5 INHIBITING 6-AZAURACIL DERIVATIVES"<br>
JANSSEN PHARMACEUTICA N.V., of Turnhoutseweg 30, B-2340 Beerse, Belgium,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
The present invention relates to IL-5 inhibiting 6-azauracil derivatives useful for treating eosinophil-dependent inflammatory diseases, to processes and intermediates for their preparation as well as to pharmaceutical compositions comprising the said derivatives. It further relates to the use of such derivatives as a medicine, and to processes for marking a receptor or imaging an organ using the said derivatives.<br>
Eosinophil influx, leading to subsequent tissue damage, is an important pathogenic event in bronchial asthma and allergic diseases. The cytokine interleukin-5 (IL-5), produced mainly by T lymphocytes as a glycoprotein, induces the differentiation of eosinophils in bone marrow and, primes eosinophils for activation in peripheral blood and sustains their survival in tissues. As such, IL-5 plays a critical role in the process of eosinophilic inflammation. Hence, the possibility that inhibitors of IL-5 production would reduce the production, activation and/or survival of eosinophils provides a therapeutic approach to the treatment of bronchial asthma and allergic diseases such as, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, and also other eosinophil-dependent inflammatory diseases.<br>
Steroids, which strongly inhibit IL-5 production in vitro, have long been used as the only drugs with remarkable efficacy for bronchial asthma and atopic dermatitis, but they cause various serious adverse reactions such as diabetes, hypertension and cataracts. Therefore, it would be desirable to find non steroidal compounds having the ability to inhibit IL-5 production in human T-cells and which have little or no adverse reactions.<br>
US 4,631,278 discloses α-aryl-4-(4,5-dihydro-3,5-dioxo-l,2,4-triazin-2(3H)-yl)-benzene-acetonitriles and US 4,767,760 discloses 2-(substitutedphenyl)-l,2,4-triazine-3,5(2H,4H)-diones, all having anti-protozoal activity, in particular, anti-coccidial activity. EP 831,088 discloses 1,2,4-triazine-3,5-diones as anticoccidial agents. W099/02505 discloses 6-azauracil derivatives which prove to be potent inhibitors of the production of IL-5.<br>

The cyclization can suitably be carried out by refluxing the intermediate (IV) in acidic medium such as acetic acid and in the presence of a base such as, for example, potassium acetate.<br><br><br>
A suitable way to prepare intermediates of formula (IV) involves the<br>
Depending on its nature, E can be eliminated using various art-known elimination procedures. For example when E is an amide or a cyano moiety, it can be hydrolized to a carboxylic moiety by for instance refluxing the intermediate bearing the E group in hydrochloric acid and acetic acid. The thus obtained intermediate can then be further reacted with mercaptoacetic acid or a functional derivative thereof to obtain a compound of formula (I). Said reaction is conveniently carried out at elevated temperatures ranging up to reflux temperature.<br><br>
reaction of an intermediate of formula (VI) with sodium nitrate or a functional derivative thereof in an acidic medium such as for example hydrochloric acid in acetic acid, and preferably in the same reaction mixture, further reacting the thus obtained intermediate with a reagent of formula (VII) wherein L and E are as defined above, in the presence of a base such as, for example, sodium acetate.<br><br>
An interesting subgroup within the present invention are those compounds of formula (I) wherein -X-R2 is an optionally substituted 2-thiazolyl moiety, said compounds being represented by formula (l-a). The optionally substituted 2-thiazolyl moiety can be incorporated in the compounds of formula (l-a) at different stages of the preparation process.<br>
For instance, scheme 1 above depicts three possible ways to prepare compounds of formula (l-a).<br><br><br>
A first pathway involves the reaction of the cyano moiety in an intermediate of formula (VIII) to the corresponding thioamide using H2S gas in a suitable solvent such as, for example, pyridine and in the presence of a base such as, for example, triethylamine, thus obtaining an intermediate of formula (IX-a). This thioamide can then be cyclized with an intermediate of formula (XII) wherein W is a suitable leaving group such as, for example, a halogen, e.g. promo, in a suitable solvent such as, for example, ethanol. The amino moiety in the resulting 2-thiazolyl derivative of formula (IX-b) can then be further reacted<br><br>
as described hereinabove to form a 6-azauracil ring, thus obtaining a compound of formula (l-a).<br>
A second pathway to form compounds of formula (l-a) involves first the protecting of the amino moiety in an intermediate of formula (VIII) by introducing a suitable protective group P such as, for example, an alkylcarbonyl group, using art-known protection techniques. In the example of P being a alkylcarbonyl group, the intermediates of formula (VII) can be reacted with the corresponding anhydride of formula alkyl-C(=0)-0-C(=0)-alkyl in an appropriate solvent such as, for example, toluene. The thus obtained intermediate of formula (X-a) can then be further reacted according to the first pathway described hereinabove. The final step, before formation of the 6-azauracil ring can be initiated after having deprotected the amino moiety using art-known deprotection techniques. In the example of P being a alkylcarbonyl group, the intermediates of formula (X-c) may be deprotected by reacting them in a suitable solvent such as, for example, ethanol, in the presence of an acid such as, for example, hydrochloric acid.<br>
A third pathway involves first the formation of the 6-azauracil ring as described hereinabove but starting from an intermediate of formula (VIII), and subsequently reacting the thus formed intermediate of formula (Xl-a) with H2S and further reacting the thioamide of formula (Xl-b) with an intermediate of formula (XII) as described in the first pathway, to finally form a compound of formula (l-a).<br>
Another interesting subgroup within the present invention are those compounds of formula (I) wherein -X-R2 is an optionally substituted 1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl moiety, said compounds being represented by formula (l-b-1). The optionally substituted 1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl moiety can be incorporated at the same stages of the reaction procedure as depicted for the 2-thiazolyl derivatives in scheme 1.<br>
For instance, analogous to one of the three pathways shown in scheme 1, compounds of formula (l-b-1) can be prepared by reacting an intermediate of formula (VIII) as depicted in scheme 2.<br><br>
Scheme 2<br><br>
In said scheme 2, the cyano group of an intermediate of formula (VIII) is reacted with hydroxylamine or a functional derivative thereof in a suitable solvent such as, for example, methanol, and in the presence of a base such as, for example sodium methanolate. The thus formed intermediate of formula (Xlll-a) is then reacted with an intermediate of formula (XIV) wherein W is a suitable leaving group such as, for example, a halogen, e.g. chloro, in an appropriate solvent such as, for example, dichloromethane, and in the presence of a base, such as, for example, N,N-(1-methylethyl)ethaneamine. The resulting intermediate of formula (Xlll-b) is then cyclized to a 3-oxadiazolyl derivative of formula (Xlll-c). The amino moiety in the intermediates of formula (Xlll-c) can then be transformed to the 6-azauracil ring as described above.<br>
Still another interestng subgroup within the present invention are those compounds of formula (I) wherein -X-R2 is'an optionally substituted 1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl moiety, said compounds being represented by formula (l-b-2).<br>
For instance, compounds of formula (l-b-2) can be prepared as depicted in scheme 3.<br><br><br><br>
derivative may be refluxed in a mixture of sulfuric acid and acetic acid in water. The carboxylic acid derivative of formula (XVI-a) may the further be reacted with a chlorinating agent such as, for example, thionyl chloride, to form an acylchloride derivative of formula (XVI-b). Subsequently, The acyl chloride may be reacted with a hydrazine derivative of formula (XVII) in a suitable solvent such as, for example, dichloromethane, and in the presence of a base such as, for example N,N-(1-methylethyl)ethaneamine. The thus formed intermediate of formula (XVI-c) may be cyclized to a 1,2,4-oxadiazol-2-yl derivative of formula (XVI-d) in the presence of phophoryl chloride.As a final step before the formation of the 6-azauracil ring as described above, the nitro group in the intermediates of formula (XVI-e) is reduced to an amino group using art-known reduction techniques such as, for instance, reducing the nitro group with hydrogen in methanol and in the presence of a catalyst such as Raney Nickel.<br>
Yet another interesting subgroup within the present invention are those compounds of formula (I) wherein -X-R2 is -NH-R2, said compounds being represented by formula (l-c-1). Scheme 4 depicts a suitable pathway to obtain compounds of formula (l-c-1).<br>

In said scheme 4, the cyano moiety of an intermediate of formula (Xl-a) is hydrolized to the corresponding amide using art-known techniques such as, for instance, hydrolysis in the presence of acetic acid and sulfuric acid. The thus formed amide in the intermediates of formula (XVIII-a) can be transformed in an amine using (diacetoxyiodo)benzene or a functional derivative thereof in a suitable solvent such as, for example a mixture of water and acetonitrile. The amine derivative of formula (XVIII-b) can then be reacted with benzotriazol-1-yloxytris(dimethylamino) phosphonium hexafluoro-phosphate as described in<br><br>
Tetrahedron Letters No.14 (1975) p. 1219-1222 to obtain a compound, or with a functional derivative thereof such as, for instance, an isothiocyanate, in an appropriate solvent such as, for example, tetrahydrofuran.<br>
Intermediates of formula (VIM) can be prepared as depicted in scheme 5.<br><br>
An intermediate of formula (XIX) and an intermediate of formula (XX) may be reacted in a suitable solvent such as, for example, dimethylsulfoxide, in the presence of a base such as, for example sodium hydroxide, to form an intermediate of formula (XV-a). The nitro moiety in the intermediates of formula (XV-a) may either be immediately reduced to an amino group using art-known reduction techniques such as, for example, reducing the nitro group with hydrogen in methanol and in the presnece of a catalyst such as Raney Nickel, or may first be reacted with an intermediate of formula R4-W wherein R4' is the same as R4 but other than hydrogen and W is a suitable leaving group such as, for example, a halogen, e.g. iodo, in a suitable solvent such as, for example, N,N-dimethylformamide, and in the presence of a suitable base such as, for example, sodium hydride, before reducing the nitro moiety.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) can also be converted into each other following art-known procedures of functional group transformation such as, for<br><br>
example, those mentioned in WO99/02505 and the ones exemplified in the experimental part hereinafter. In particular, compounds of formula (I) containing at least one - C(=O)-2-R14 moiety born by R2, wherein Z is O or S and R14 is other than hydrogen, can suitably be prepared by reacting the compound of      formula (XXI) containing the corresponding moiety - C(=0)-Z-H with an<br>
appropriate reagent of formula (XXII) wherein W2 is a suitable leaving group, as follows:<br><br>
For instance a first process of such preparation involves reacting the compound of formula (XXI) containing the corresponding moiety - C(=0)-Z-H with a halide, preferably a bromide having the formula Br -R14, in a reaction-inert solvent such as defined above and in the presence of sodium hydrogenocarbonate. The said reaction is performed at a temperature below the boiling point of the solvent used and, for example, for a period of time between about 2 and 18 hours when dimethylformamide is used as the solvent. A second process of such preparation involves reacting the compound of formula (XXI) containing the corresponding moiety - C(=0)-Z-H with an alcohol having the formula R14-OH, in a reaction-inert solvent such as defined above and in the presence of 1,1'-carbonylbis-1H-imidazole optionally admixed with 1,8-Diaza-7-bicyclo (5.4.0) undecene. When methylene chloride is used as the solvent, the reaction may be performed at room temperature for a period of time of several hours.<br>
The present invention is also concerned with new compounds of formula:<br><br><br>
(XXIII)<br><br>
wherein R20 and R21 are each independently selected from hydrogen or C1-20 alkyl or R20 and R21 taken together with the carbon atom to which they are attached form a cycloalkyl radical. These new compounds are useful for preparing a compound of formula (I) when Het5 represents a sulfonamido substituted piperazine. Such intermediate compounds of formula (XXIII) can be prepared by reacting N,N-dimethyl-1-piperazinesulfonamide with an alkylene oxide in a reaction-inert solvent such as methanol and/or methylene chloride. Suitable alkylene oxides for this purpose include for instance ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, 1-2 butylene oxide, cyclohexylene oxide and the like.<br>
The present invention is also concerned with new compounds of formulae:<br><br>
which are useful intermediates in the preparation of some of the compounds of formula (I).<br>
The compounds of formula (I) may also be converted to the corresponding A/-oxide forms following art-known procedures for converting a trivalent nitrogen into its N-oxide form. Said N-oxidation reaction may generally be carried out by reacting the starting material of formula (I) with 3-phenyl-2-(phenylsulfonyl)oxaziridine or with an appropriate organic or inorganic peroxide.   Appropriate inorganic peroxides comprise, for example, hydrogen<br><br>
peroxide, alkali metal or earth alkaline metal peroxides, e.g. sodium peroxide, potassium peroxide; appropriate organic peroxides may comprise peroxy acids such as, for example, benzenecarboperoxoic acid or halo substituted benzenecarboperoxoic acid, e.g. 3-chlorobenzenecarboperoxoic acid, peroxoalkanoic acids, e.g. peroxoacetic acid, alkylhydroperoxides, e.g. t-butyl hydroperoxide. Suitable solvents are, for example, water, lower alkanols, e.g. ethanol and the like, hydrocarbons, e.g. toluene, ketones, e.g. 2-butanone, halogenated hydrocarbons, e.g. dichloromethane, and mixtures of such solvents.<br>
Pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I) may be obtained by the application of art-known procedures. Diastereomers may be separated by physical methods such as selective crystallization and chromatographic techniques, e.g. counter-current distribution, liquid chromatography and the like.<br>
Some of the compounds of formula (I) and some of the intermediates in the present invention may contain an asymmetric carbon atom. Pure stereochemically isomeric forms of said compounds and said intermediates can be obtained by the application of art-known procedures. For example, diastereoisomers can be separated by physical methods such as selective crystallization or chromatographic techniques, e.g. counter current distribution, liquid chromatography and the like methods. Enantiomers can be obtained from racemic mixtures by first converting said racemic mixtures with suitable resolving agents such as, for example, chiral acids, to mixtures of diastereomeric salts or compounds; then physically separating said mixtures of diastereomeric salts or compounds by, for example, selective crystallization or chromatographic techniques, e.g. liquid chromatography and the like methods; and finally converting said separated diastereomeric salts or compounds into the corresponding enantiomers. Pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be obtained from the pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate intermediates and starting materials, provided that the intervening reactions occur stereospecifically.<br>
An alternative manner of separating the enantiomeric forms of the<br><br>
compounds of formula (I) and intermediates involves liquid chromatography, in particular liquid chromatography using a chiral stationary phase.<br>
Some of the intermediates and starting materials as used in the reaction procedures mentioned hereinabove are known compounds and may be commercially available or may be prepared according to art-known procedures.<br>
IL-5, also known as eosinophil differentiating factor (EOF) or eosinophil colony stimulating factor (Eo-CSF), is a major survival and differentiation factor or eosinophils and therefore thought to be a key player in eosinophil infiltration into tissues. There is ample evidence that eosinophil influx is an important pathogenic event in bronchial asthma and allergic diseases such as, cheilitis, Titable bowel disease, eczema, urticaria, vasculitis, vulvitis, winterfeet, atopic dermatitis, pollinosis, allergic rhinitis and allergic conjunctivitis; and other inflammatory diseases, such as eosinophilic syndrome, allergic angiitis, eosinophilic fasciitis, eosinophilic pneumonia, PIE syndrome, idiopathic eosinophilic, eosinophilic myalgia, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and the ke diseases.<br>
The present compounds also inhibit the production of other chemokines such as monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and -3 (MCP-1 and MCP-3). MCP-1 is known to attract both T-cells, in which IL-5 production mainly occurs, and monocytes, which are known to act synergeticaily with eosinophils (Carr et al., 994, Immunology, 91, 3652-3656). MCP-3 also plays a primary role in allergic inflammation as it is known to mobilize and activate basophil and eosinophil leukocytes (Baggiolini et al., 1994, Immunology Today, 15(3), 127-133).<br>
The present compounds have no or little effect on the production of ther chemokines such as IL-1, IL-2, II-3, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, γ-interferon (IFN-0) nd granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (QM-CSF) indicating mat the present IL-5 inhibitors do not act as broad-spectrum immunosuppressives.<br>
The selective chemokine inhibitory effect of the present compounds can e demonstrated by in vitro chemokine measurements in human blood. In vivo bservations such as the inhibition of eosinophilia in mouse ear, the inhibition f blood eosinophilia in the Ascaris mouse model; the reduction of serum IL-5<br><br>
protein production and splenic IL-5 mRNA expression induced by anti-CD3 antibody in mice and the inhibition of allergen- or Sephadex-induced pulmonary influx of eosinophils in guinea-pig are indicative for the usefulness of the present compounds in the treatment of eosinophil-dependent inflammatory diseases.<br>
The present inhibitors of IL-5 production are particularly useful for administration via inhalation.<br>
The intermediates of formula (Xl-a) are interesting intermediates. Not only have they a particular usefulness as intermediates in the preparation of the compounds of formula (I), they also have valuable pharmacological activity.<br>
In view of the above pharmacological properties, the compounds of formula (I) can be used as a medicine. In particular, the present compounds can be used in the manufacture of a medicament for treating eosinophil-dependent inflammatory diseases as mentioned hereinabove, more in particular bronchial asthma, atopic dertmatitis, allergic rhinitis and allergic conjunctivitis.<br>
In view of the utility of the compounds of formula (I), there is provided a method of treating warm-blooded animals, including humans, suffering from eosinophil-dependent inflammatory diseases, in particular bronchial asthma, atopic dertmatitis, allergic rhinitis and allergic conjunctivitis. Said method comprises the systemic or topical administration of an effective amount of a compound of formula (I), a N-oxide form, a pharmaceutically acceptable addition salt or a possible stereoisomeric form thereof, to warm-blooded animals, including humans.<br>
The present invention also provides compositions for treating eosinophil-dependent inflammatory diseases comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I) and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.<br>
To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, a therapeutically effective amount of the particular compound, in base form or addition salt form, as the active ingredient is combined in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which may take a wide variety of<br><br>
forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are desirably in unitary dosage form suitable, preferably, for systemic administration such as parenteral administration; or topical administration such as via inhalation, a nose spray or the like. Application of said compositions may be by aerosol, e.g. with a propellent such as nitrogen, carbon dioxide, a freon, or without a propellent such as a pump spray, drops, lotions, or a semisolid such as a thickened composition which can be applied by a swab. In particular, semisolid compositions such as salves, creams, gellies, ointments and the like will conveniently be used.<br>
It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used in the specification and claims herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such dosage unit forms are tablets (including scored or coated tablets), capsules, pills, powder packets, wafers, injectable solutions or suspensions, teaspoonfuls, tablespoonfuls and the like, and segregated multiples thereof.<br>
In order to enhance the solubility and/or the stability of the compounds of formula (I) in pharmaceutical compositions, it can be advantageous to employ α -, β- op γ-cyclodextrins or their derivatives. Also co-solvents such as alcohols may improve the solubility and/or the stability of the compounds of formula (I) in pharmaceutical compositions. In the preparation of aqueous compositions, addition salts of the subject compounds are obviously more suitable due to their increased water solubility.<br>
Appropriate cyclodextrins are α-,β-,γ-cyclodextrins or ethers and mixed ethers thereof wherein one or more of the hydroxy groups of the anhydroglucose units of the cyclodextrin are substituted with C1-6alkyl, particularly methyl, ethyl or isopropyl, e.g. randomly methylated p-CD; hydroxyC1-6alkyl, particularly hydroxyethyl, hydroxy-propyl or hydroxybutyl; carboxyCi.6alkyl, particularly carboxymethyl or carboxy-ethyl; C1-6alkylcarbonyl,<br><br>
particularly acetyl; C1-6alkyloxycarbonylC1-6alkyl or carboxy-C1-6alkyloxyC1-6alkyl, particularly carboxymethoxypropyl or carboxyethoxy-propyl; C1-6alkylcarbonyloxyC1-6alkyl, particularly 2-acetyloxypropyl. Especially noteworthy as complexants and/or solubilizers are β-CD, randomly methylated β-CD, 2,6-dimethyl-β-CD, 2-hydroxyethyl-β-CD, 2-hydroxyethyl-γ-CD, 2-hydroxypropyf-γ-CD and (2-carboxymethoxy)propyl-β-CD, and in particular 2-hydroxypropyl-β-CD (2-HP-β-CD).<br>
The term mixed ether denotes cyclodextrin derivatives wherein at least two cyclodextrin hydroxy groups are etherified with different groups such as, for example, hydroxypropyl and hydroxyethyl.<br>
The average molar substitution (M.S.) is used as a measure of the average number of moles of alkoxy units per mole of anhydroglucose. The M.S.value can be determined by various analytical techniques, preferably, as measured by mass spectrometry, the M.S. ranges from 0.125 to 10.<br>
The average substitution degree (D.S.) refers to the average number of substituted hydroxyls per anhydroglucose unit. The D.S. value can be determined by various analytical techniques, preferably, as measured by mass spectrometry, the D.S. ranges from 0.125 to 3.<br>
Due to their high degree of selectivity as IL-5 inhibitors, the compounds of formula (I) as defined above, are also useful to mark or identify receptors. To this purpose, the compounds of the present invention need to be labelled, in particular by replacing, partially or completely, one or more atoms in the molecule by their radioactive isotopes. Examples of interesting labelled compounds are those compounds having at least one halo which is a radioactive isotope of iodine, bromine or fluorine; or those compounds having at least one 11 C-atom or tritium atom.<br>
One particular group consists of those compounds of formula (I) wherein R"l is a radioactive halogen atom. In principle, any compound of formula (I) containing a halogen atom is prone for radiolabelling by replacing the halogen atom by a suitable isotope. Suitable halogen radioisotopes to this purpose are radioactive iodides, e.g. 122l, 123l, 125l, 131l; radioactive bromides, e.g. 75Br, 76Br,<br><br>
77Br and 82Br, and radioactive fluorides, e.g. 18F. The introduction of a radioactive halogen atom can be performed by a suitable exchange reaction or by using any one of the procedures as described hereinabove to prepare halogen derivatives of formula (I).<br>
Another interesting form of radiolabelling is by substituting a carbon atom by a 11C-atom or the substitution of a hydrogen atom by a tritium atom.<br>
Hence, said radiolabelled compounds of formula (I) can be used in a process of specifically marking receptor sites in biological material. Said process comprises the steps of (a) radiolabelling a compound of formula (I), (b) administering this radiolabelled compound to biological material and subsequently (c) detecting the emissions from the radiolabelled compound.<br>
The term biological material is meant to comprise every kind of material which has a biological origin. More in particular this term refers to tissue samples, plasma or body fluids but also to animals, specially warm-blooded animals, or parts of animals such as organs.<br>
The radiolabelled compounds of formula (I) are also useful as agents for screening whether a test compound has the ability to occupy or bind to a particular receptor site. The degree to which a test compound will displace a compound of formula (I) from such a particular receptor site will show the test compound ability as either an agonist, an antagonist or a mixed agonist/antagonist of said receptor.<br>
When used in in vivo assays, the radiolabelled compounds are administered<br>
in an appropriate composition to an animal and the location of said<br>
radiolabelled compounds is detected using imaging techniques, such as, for<br>
instance, Single Photon Emission Computerized Tomography (SPECT) or<br>
Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and the like. In this manner the<br>
distribution of the particular receptor sites throughout the body can be detected<br>
and organs containing said receptor sites can be visualized by the imaging<br>
techniques mentioned hereinabove. This process of imaging an organ by<br>
administering a radiolabelled compound of formula (I) and detecting the<br>
emissions from the radioactive compound also constitutes a part of the present<br>
invention.	<br><br>
In general, it is contemplated that a therapeutically effective daily amount would be from 0.01 mg/kg to 50 mg/kg body weight, in particular from 0.05 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg body weight. A method of treatment may also include administering the active ingredient on a regimen of between two or four intakes per day.<br>
