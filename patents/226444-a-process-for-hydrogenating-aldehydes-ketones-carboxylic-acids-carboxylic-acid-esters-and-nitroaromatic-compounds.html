				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
This application has been divided out. of the parent application no.<br>
1069/CAL/96 of 10.6.1996, entitled "SHAPED HYDROGENATION<br>
CATALYST AND PROCESSES FOR THEIR PREPARATION AND USE"<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
This invention relates to catalysts which are useful as hydrogenation<br>
catalysts and particularly for the catalytic hydrogenation of aldehydes,<br>
ketones, carboxylic acids, carboxylic acid esters and nitroaromatic<br>
compounds. This invention also relates to processes for preparing said<br>
catalysts and to hydrogenation processes using said catalysts.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART:<br>
Hydrogenation reactions and catalysts useful in such reactions are well<br>
known. For example, U.S. patent 4.666,879 describes an extruded<br>
copper chromite-alumina catalyst prepared, by blending together from<br>
40-82% by weight of copper chromite and 18-60%. of an extrudable<br>
alumina, typically having a pseudoboehmite or a hydroxy boehmite<br>
structure. The extruded catalyst after calcining is useful for the liquid<br>
and vapor phase hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis of various carbonyl<br>
compounds and the functional side groups of aromatic compounds. The<br>
extruded catalyst is characterized as having a surface area of between 20<br>
and 225 square meters per gram and a packed apparent bulk density of<br>
between about 0.70 and about 1.20 g/cc.<br>
U.S. Patent 4,762,817 describes an aldehyde hydrogenation catalyst<br>
consisting essentially of a mixture<br><br>
of copper and zinc oxide impregnated with a minor<br>
selectivity improving amount of a selectivity enhancer<br>
comprising the combination of an alkali metal selectivity<br>
enhancer selected from the group consisting of sodium,<br>
potassium, lithium, cesium, and mixtures thereof and a<br>
transition metal selectivity enhancer selected from the<br>
group consisting of nickel, cobalt, and mixtures thereof.<br>
U.S. Patent 4,929,771 describes catalyst compositions<br>
comprised of chemically-mixed, copper-titanium oxides and<br>
the use of such catalyst compositions in the hydrogenation<br>
of certain esters to obtain the alcohol corresponding to<br>
the acid residue of the ester.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,008,235 describes a process tor<br>
hydrogenating feeds into their corresponding alcohols by<br>
contact with a coprecipitated catalyst comprising copper,<br>
aluminum, and a metal (X) selected from the group<br>
consisting of magnesium, zinc, titanium, zirconium, tin,<br>
nickel, cobalt and mixtures thereof; that has been reduced<br>
with an increasing temperature during the reduction.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,043,509 describes catalyst particles<br>
employed in reactions involving the conversion of organic<br>
compounds that should possess a desired configuration in<br>
order to maintain a desired voidage which will permit<br>
passage of the feedstock through the catalyst bed during<br>
the conversion reaction. Solid phosphoric acid catalysts<br>
which comprise an admixture of an acid<br>
of phosphorus and a solid binder such as a siliceous<br>
material may be formed into polylobular, tubular, ridged,<br>
fluted, or channeled cylindrical particles which will<br>
permit a sufficient amount of voidage in the catalyst bed<br>
to be maintained even though the catalyst particles will<br>
swell during the reaction due to the formation of coke on<br>
the surface thereof.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,093,534 describes a process for the<br>
preparation of saturated alcohols from aldehydes. The<br>
hydrogenation of saturated and unsaturated aldehydes to<br>
alcohols can be carried out over catalysts containing<br><br>
copper and nickel. In this process, the selectivity of the<br>
alcohol preparation is further improved by a combination of<br>
an alkaline copper catalyst and a nickel-containing<br>
catalyst whose carrier material has acidic centers of a<br>
certain acid strength HO.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,124,295 describes to a formed copper<br>
chromite catalyst prepared from a blend comprising from<br>
about 20 to about 80% by weight of copper chromite and from<br>
about 20 to about 80% by weight of at least one extrudable<br>
inorganic binder material wherein the catalyst has a<br>
surface area of from about 20 to about 225 m2/g, and the<br>
total pore volume of the pores in said catalyst having a<br>
diameter of up to about 95,000 A is between about 0.35 to<br>
about 1 cc/g. In another embodiment, the patent describes<br>
a process for preparing this formed copper chromite<br>
catalyst and the process comprises:<br>
(A) preparing a blend comprising from about 20 to<br>
about 80% by weight of copper chromite, from about 20<br>
to about 80% by weight of at least one extrudable<br>

peptizing agent, and sufficient water to form an<br>
extrudable blend?<br>
(B)	extruding the blend to form an extrudate; and<br>
(C)	calcining the extrudate. This patent also<br>
describes a process for hydrogenating aldehydes,<br>
ketones, carboxylic acids and carboxylic acid esters<br>
with catalysts of the type described.<br>

catalyst comprising a major amount of the oxides of a first<br>
metal selected from copper or zinc, a second metal selected<br>
from chromium, molybdenum, tungsten and vanadium, and<br>
optionally, a minor amount of the oxide of a promoter metal<br>
selected from the group consisting of manganese, barium,<br>
zinc, nickel, cobalt, cadmium, iron and any combination<br>

alumino-silicate clays such as attapulgites, sepiolites,<br>
serpentines, kaolinites, calcium montmorillonit.es and<br>
mixtures thereof.<br>
Clays useful in making compositions of the instant<br>
invention include those obtained from the Meigs -<br>
Attapulgus - Quincy fullers earth districts, located in<br>
southwest Georgia and northern Florida.<br>
For purposes herein, the term "attapulgite" is used to<br>
mean chain lattice type clay minerals, encompassing<br>
minerals and mineral groups variously referred to in the<br>
literature as "attapulgite," "palygorskite, " "sepiolite, "<br>
and "hormite." Typically, the clays suitable for use in<br>
the instant invention contain a major amount of<br>
attapulgite. As used herein, "major amount" shall mean and<br>
refer to a component which is present in the largest amount<br>
of any of the components present.<br>
Those skilled in the art will be familiar with methods<br>
to determine the relative amounts of various mineral phases<br>
present in such clays.<br>
The clays suitable for use in the practice of this<br>
invention may be undried, dried or calcined.<br>
The free moisture content of the clays suitable for<br>
use in this invention is preferably from about 3 up to<br>
about 8 weight percent. As used herein, the "free-moisture<br>
content" is the amount of water removed from the clay by<br>
heating to constant weight at 220°F. Typically, the clay<br>
material as mined contains up to about 45% by weight free<br>
moisture content.<br>
The clay material for use in this invention is<br>
preferably powdered and typically has particles having mesh<br>
sizes of less than about 200 mesh (U.S. Standard),<br>
preferably less than about 325. The composition of this<br>
invention may contain up to about 30% by weight of at least<br>
one clay material; typically from about 1% up to about 30%<br><br>
by weight; preferably from about 3 up to about 15% by<br>
weight.<br>
Preferably the compositions of this invention are<br>
free of added alumina other than that which may be present<br>
resulting from the clays incorporated in said compositions.<br>
Shaped catalysts compositions of this invention can be<br>
prepared by a process which comprises:<br>
(A)	preparing a paste of (i) at least one metal oxide<br>
wherein said metal is selected from the group consisting of<br>
copper, manganese, zinc, nickel, cobalt and iron; (ii) at<br>
least one solvent; (iii) calcium silicate, (iv) at least<br>
one clay material and (v) such other optional components<br>
discussed therein.<br>
(B)	forming a shaped particle from said paste; and<br>
(C)	drying and calcining said shaped particle.<br>
The metal oxides suitable for use in preparing the<br>
compositions of this invention are the oxides of copper,<br>
manganese, zinc, nickel, cobalt and iron. As used herein<br>
"metal oxides" includes the precursors of such oxides such<br>
as carbonates and nitrates.<br>
The metal oxides used in the process of the instant<br>
invention are typically in a physical form suitable for the<br>
formation of shaped particles; preferably the metal oxides<br>
used herein are in powdered form.<br>
The process of this invention also includes the use of<br>
one or more solvents selected from conventional liquid<br>
solvents which are inert in the context of the process of<br>
the instant invention. These solvents include, but are not<br>
limited to, water: alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol and<br>
propanol; ketones, such as acetone and methyl ethyl ketone;<br>
and aldehydes, such as propanal and butanal. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, water is used as the solvent.<br>
The amount of solvent used in preparing the paste in<br>
the instantly claimed process is an amount that provides a<br>
consistency which allows for a shape to be formed out of<br>
said paste, but not so fluid as to fail to hold the formed<br>
shape.. Typically, the total amount of solvent in the paste<br><br>
including that contributed by other components such as clay<br>
is from about 20 up to about 60% by weight of the paste;<br>
preferably from about 35% up to about 55% by weight of the<br>
paste.<br>
The calcium silicate useful for the purposes of this<br>
invention may be from naturally occurring or synthetic<br>
sources. The calcium silicate may be in one or more of its<br>
several forms including calcium metasilicate (CaSiO3) ,<br>
dicalcium silicate (Ca2SiO3) and tricalcium silicate<br>
(Ca3SiO5) . The calcium silicate may be formed ex situ or<br>
in situ. Ex situ formed calcium silicate is that which is<br>
formed separate from the presence of one or more of the<br>
components used in the preparation of the shaped<br>
compositions of the instant invention. Typically this<br>
involves use of a commercially available source of calcium<br>
silicate which is mixed with the other components used in<br>
the preparation of the shaped compositions of instant<br>
invention. Calcium silicate formed in situ is that which<br>
is formed in the presence of one or more of the components<br>
used in the preparation of the shaped compositions of the<br>
invention. For the purpose of this invention, in situ<br>
calcium silicate may be formed in the presence of the<br>
source of metal or the clay material although, preferably,<br>
the calcium silicate is formed in the presence of a mixture<br>
of the source of metal and the clay material. Typically,<br>
the in situ formed calcium silicate is formed by<br>
contacting, prior to the shaping of said composition, at<br>
least one source of calcium with at least one source of<br>
reactive silica.<br>
The source of calcium, as used herein, refers to non-<br>
halogen and non-sulfur calcium salt which are capable of<br>
reacting with a reactive silica source to form calcium<br>
silicate, such as oxides, nitrates, carbonate, etc.<br>
Suitable sources of such calcium nitrate, calcium<br>
hydroxide, calcium carbonate, etc.<br>
The reactive source of silica, as used herein, refers<br>
to a silicon-containing material capable of reacting with<br><br>
the calcium source, under ambient conditions of temperature<br>
and pressure, to form calcium silicate. Suitable sources<br>
of such silica include acid or base stabilized silica sols,<br>
sodium silicate, potassium silicate, etc.<br>
The molar ratio of calcium to silicon added to the<br>
paste is preferably about 1:1, although typically can range<br>
from 0.6:1.4 to 1.4 to 0.6. In addition, the paste<br>
typically has an atomic ratio of said metal to calcium to<br>
silicon of 2.5 to 6.0:0.6 to 1.4:0.6 to 1.4.<br>
The paste of the instant process may also contain<br>
rheology control agents and pore forming agents. Rheology<br>
control agents include starches, sugars, glycols, polyols,<br>
powdered organic polymers, graphite, stearic acid and its<br>
esters. Pore forming agents include graphite,<br>
polypropylene or other organic polymer powders, activated<br>
carbon, charcoal, sugars, starches and cellulose flour.<br>
The rheology control agents and pore forming agents are<br>
well-known to those of ordinary skill in the art and are<br>
used as necessary to obtain the desired viscosity of the<br>
paste or porosity of the formed particle as the case may<br>
be. Typically, either one of these may be present in an<br>
amount of from about 0.5% up to about 20% by weight,<br>
preferably from about; 1% up to about 10% by weight of the<br>
paste.<br>
The metal oxide, solvent, calcium silicate (and/or<br>
source of calcium and reactive source of silica) and<br>
optional rheology control agents, pore forming agents,<br>
promoter materials and clay are mixed or mulled thoroughly<br>
for a period of time sufficient to provide uniform mixing<br>
of the components. This time can vary from a few minutes to<br>
several hours. Preferably, the mixture is mixed or mulled<br>
for a total period of from about 5 minutes to about 120<br>
minutes, more preferably from about 10 minutes up to about<br>
90 minutes. This is typically carried out at room<br>
temperature at or about atmospheric pressure. A formed<br>
particle is then prepared from the paste. Extrusion is the<br>
preferred forming technique and typically the formed shape<br><br>
is a cylinder, although other, shapes such as tubular,<br>
polylobular, fluted, and ridged are also useful. The<br>
formed particle is then dried to remove the bulk of the<br>
solvent from said particle. Typically, drying is done at a<br>
temperature of from about 80° up to about 300°C in air for<br>
a period of up to 24 hours, preferably from about 6 hours<br>
up to about 12 hours. The particle is then calcined in air<br>
or inert gas for a period of time ranging from about one<br>
hour up to about 12 hours, preferably two to eight hours at<br>
a temperature of from about 400°C up to about. 1000°C,<br>
preferably about 600°C to about 850°C. The result is a<br>
hard, and low bulk density formed particle. In the context<br>
of this invention a particle typically has a hardness of 4-<br>
12 lbs/mm side crush strength, surface area is typically<br>
from about 5 up to about 150 m2/g, preferably, 10 up to 100<br>
m2/g; and packed bulk density is typically less than 1.4<br>
gms./cc, preferably from about 0.6 up to about 1.4 gms./cc.<br>
and more preferably from about 0.6 up to about 1.1 gms./cc.<br>
When used herein, hardness is determined by ASTM-04179-82 ;<br>
surface area is determined by B.E.T. N2 adsorption method<br>
(ASTM-4222-83) ; and packed bulk density is determined by<br>
ASTM-D4164-82.<br>
Following calcination, but before use, the catalyst<br>
may be and is normally activated by reducing at least some<br>
of the metal oxide present in the catalyst. The reduction<br>
step may be carried out in situ immediately prior to use,<br>
or alternatively, reduction may be carried out in advance<br>
of use by contacting the catalyst with hydrogen or a<br>
mixture of hydrogen and nitrogen at elevated temperatures<br>
according to well-known procedures in which a portion or<br>
all of the metal oxide are reduced. The reduced catalyst<br>
may then be stabilized or passivated, e.g., by exposing the<br>
catalyst to air or CO2 to form a thin oxide layer on the<br>
surface, or the reduced catalyst may be stored in a<br>
protective medium such as an inert liquid until use.<br>
The catalysts of the present invention are useful for<br>
hydrogenating aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids and<br><br>
carboxylic acid esters to alcohols and nitroaromatic<br>
compounds to amino aromatic compounds.<br>
The shaped catalysts of this invention may be utilized<br>
in fixed bed reactors.<br>
In one embodiment, carboxylic acids and carboxylic<br>
esters can be converted to alcohols in excellent yields. A<br>
wide variety of acids, particularly esters of carboxylic<br>
acids can be treated with the catalyst of the present<br>
invention to produce alcohols- The esters may be<br>
monoesters or diesters. Among the acids which may be<br>
hydrogenated to the corresponding alcohols without<br>
isolating the ester include stearic acids and caproic<br>
acids. Esters derived from the alcohols of lower molecular<br>
weight carboxylic acids are hydrogenated more rapidly and<br>
at lower temperatures than the esters derived from the<br>
higher alcohols. Examples of esters which may be<br>
hydrogenated with the catalyst of the present invention<br>
include the methyl ester of coconut fatty acid, methyl<br>
stearate, methyl oleate, ethyl laurate, ethyl myristate,<br>
the diethyl ester of ethyl malonic acid, diethyl succinate,<br>
di-n-butyl glutarate, diethyl sebacate. As noted, the<br>
esters are converted to alcohols, and examples of such<br>
conversions include: ethyl laurate to lauryl alcohol; ethyl<br>
myristate to myristyl alcohol; ethyl valerate to n-amyl<br>
alcohol; methyl caproate to n-hexyl alcohol, etc.<br>
Examples of aldehydes which may be hydrogenated to<br>
alcohols with the catalyst of the present invention<br>
include: butyraldehyde, furfural, 2-ethylhexenal,<br>
dodecanal, tetradecanal, etc. Examples of ketones include<br>
acetone, acetophenone, etc.<br>
The hydrogenation reactions which are conducted in the<br>
presence of the catalyst of the present invention are<br>
carried out at temperatures of from about 100°C to about<br>
350°c and at pressures of from about 15 psi to about 4500<br>
psi.<br>
Examples of this invention are included herein below.<br>
Of course, these examples are not intended as limiting this<br><br>
invention as modification of the examples by ordinary<br>
expedient will be readily apparent to those of ordinary<br>
skill in the art.<br>
Unless otherwise indicated in the following examples<br>
and elsewhere in the specification and claims, all parts<br>
and percentages are by weight, temperatures are in degrees<br>
Centigrade and pressures are at or near atmospheric.<br>

The hydrogenation tests, for which results are given<br>
in Tables 1-4, were carried out in test stands that consist<br>
of a catalyst activation system, an feed reservoir and<br>
pump, the reactor section, and a gas/liquid separator<br>
section for recovery of the product. The reactors are<br>
stainless steel tubes with three heating zones surrounding<br>
the catalyst bed and preheating section.. Concurrent,<br>
downflow configuration was used for both gas and liquid<br>
reactants. Hydrogen and nitrogen gas for catalyst<br>
activation and reactant hydrogenation, are metered through<br>
mass flow control devices. Each catalyst is activated by<br>
controlled hydrogen reduction of the active copper oxide<br>
component before starting the reaction. A multifunctional<br>
strip chart recorder is used to collect temperature,<br>
pressure, and flow data at preselected time intervals<br>
throughout the run.<br>
The vapor phase: ethyl-propyl-acrolein (EPA)<br>
hydrogenation test reported in Table 1 employs a catalyst<br>
volume of 150 milliliters. A minimum time of 23 hours was<br>
used to equilibrate the reaction rates and achieve<br><br>
steady-state conditions before hydrogenated 2-ethyl-hexanal<br>
(2-EH) product was sampled for gas chromatographic<br>
analysis. Feedstock and products were analyzed for C8<br>
aldehydes, C8 alcohols, undifferentiated light-end and<br>
heavy-end hydrocarbon byproducts- The 2-ethyl-2-hexenal<br>
feedstock was obtained from a domestic, commercial source<br>
and stored under an inert atmosphere (nitrogen.) while in<br>
use. Test conditions were chosen to (a) ensure vapor phase<br>
conditions prevailed throughout the reaction zone, and (b)<br>
to enable conversion and selectivity differentiation<br>
between catalysts. The following reaction conditions were<br>
applied: inlet temperature = 95°C; inlet pressure =14.7<br>
psig (absolute); LHSV (aldehyde) =0.30 hrs-1; GHSV<br>
(hydrogen) = 2241 hrs-1; and hydrogen/aldehyde (molar) =<br>
50.<br>
Table 1 compares Examples 1,2, and 7 with Comparative<br>
Examples A, B and C. The Table shows that the catalysts of<br>
the invention have much better activity and selectivity for<br>
the conversion of ethyl-propyl acrolein (EPA) to<br>
2-ethyl-hexanol (2-EH) than catalysts with similar contents<br>
of the active metal (copper). Example 7, the preferred<br>
embodiment, has better activity and selectivity than<br>
examples 1 and 2. The catalyst of example 7 also has the<br>
highest crush strength, as well. The compositions of the<br>
control examples were chosen so as to demonstrate the<br>
effects of varying levels of clay or commercial synthetic<br>
calcium silicate on the performance of the extrusions. The<br>
Table shows that using only clay or commercial synthetic<br>
calcium silicate as binders does not impart the performance<br>
seen with the use of the both together. This is an<br>
unexpected synergistic effect that is seen to an even<br>
greater degree in the catalyst of the preferred embodiment,<br>
which uses the calcium silicate formed in-situ.<br>
The vapor phase furfural to furfuryl alcohol<br>
hydrogenation test reported in Table 2 employs a catalyst<br>
volume of 100 milliliters. The feedstock and products were<br>
analyzed forfurfural, furfuryl alcohol, furan, and<br><br><br><br>
undifferentiated light-end and heavy-end hydrocarbon<br>
byproducts. The furfural feedstock was obtained from a<br>
domestic, commercial source and distilled to remove as much<br>
residual sulfur-containing impurity as possible. It was<br>
stored under an inert atmosphere (nitrogen) while in use.<br>
Test conditions were chosen to (a) ensure vapor phase<br>
conditions prevailed throughout the reaction zone, and (b)<br>
to enable conversion and selectivity differentiation<br>
between catalysts, and (c) reflect current commercial<br>
usage.<br><br>
TABLE 1<br>
Vapor-Phase Ethyl-Propyl-Acrolein Hydrogenation<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Table 2 gives data comparing a commercial non-chromium<br>
copper catalyst (Engelhard Cu-0320T: 61% Cu, 20% Na2SiO3)<br>
with Examples 3 and 4 of the present invention. The data<br>
show that the catalysts of the invention have activities<br>
and selectivities comparable to the commercial catalyst,<br>
but are both stronger and less dense. The lower density is<br>
very desirable in commercial operation due to the lowered<br>
cost of filling a given reactor volume (since these types<br>
of catalysts are always sold by weight). The increased<br>
crush strength means there is less likelihood of attrition<br>
during shipping and less chance of a catalyst bed<br>
collapsing during use.<br>
The vapor phase nitrobenzene to aniline hydrogenation<br>
test reported in Table 3 employs a small catalyst: volume of<br>
25 milliliters due to the highly exothermic nature of this<br>
reaction. The feedstock and products were analyzed for<br>
nitrobenzene and aniline. The feedstock was obtained from<br>
a domestic, commercial source and the test conditions were<br>
chosen to reflect current commercial usage.<br><br>
TABLE 2<br>
FIXED BED HYDROGENATION OF FURFURAL<br><br><br><br><br>
Table 3 compares Example 6 with a copper chromite<br>
catalyst used commercially (Engelhard Cu-1152T: 29% Cu, 26%<br>
Cr, 7% Ba, 15% CaSiO3) for the hydrogenation of<br>
nitrobenzene to aniline:. The nitrobenzene: hydrogenation<br>
data show that the catalyst of the invention gives better<br>
activity than the commercial catalyst and does so with<br>
higher strength and much lower bulk density (offering the<br>
same advantages mentioned above).<br>
The liquid phase C12 methylester hydrogenation test<br>
reported in Table 4 employs a catalyst: volume of 200<br>
milliliters. A minimum, time of 24 hours was used to<br>
equilibrate the reaction rates and achieve steady-state<br>
conditions before hydrogenated C12 alcohol product was<br>
sampled for gas chromatographic analysis. Feedstock and<br>
products were analyzed for C8-C14 esters, C8-C14 alcohols,<br>
undifferentiated light-end and heavy-end hydrocarbon by-<br>
products .<br>
The C12 feedstock was obtained from a domestic,<br>
commercial source and stored under an inert atmosphere<br>
(nitrogen) while in use. Test conditions were chosen to<br>
reflect current commercial usage. The bed temperature was<br>
varied from 180 to 200°C; two inlet pressures were used:<br>
4350 psig and 3510 psig; two LHSVs were used: 0.50 and 1.0<br>
hrs-1; and hydrogen/ester (molar) = 44-100.<br><br><br><br>
Table 4 compares Examples 6 and 8 with a commercially<br>
available reference catalyst (Engelhard Cu- 1987 Tl/8: 36%<br>
Cu, 33% Cr, 3% Mn). The activity of the catalysts are<br>
reported in saponification value (sap. value) which<br>
indicates the. degree of remaining ester feedstock (or other<br>
saponifiable intermediates) and is reported in units of<br>
milligrams of potassium hydroxide (KOH) per grains of<br>
product. The sap. value of the feedstock is 265. The<br>
table shows that the catalysts of the invention have better<br>
activity and selectivity for the conversion of C12<br>
methylester to C12 alcohol than a state-of-the-art;<br>
commercial copper chromite catalyst. At the higher<br>
pressure (4350 psig), Example 6 gives saponification values<br>
that are about the same or slightly lower than the<br>
reference catalyst. However, the bulk density of the<br>
catalyst of the invention is about half that of the<br>
commercial copper chromite. At the lower pressure (3510<br>
psig), Example 6 produces product with saponificatin<br>
values that are approximately half that, of the reference<br>
for a given temperature and liquid hourly space velocity<br>
(LHSV) . The hydrocarbon byproduct make is very low for all<br>
of the runs. Example 8 is nominally the same diameter and<br>
length as the reference catalyst and Example 6, but has a<br>
5-fluted cross-sectional shape. This extrusion shape<br>
serves to lower the bulk density of the extrusions even<br>
further and also offers more external surface area, for<br>
enhanced feed/product diffusion. This catalyst gives<br>
saponif ication values that: are about, an order of magnitude<br>
lower than the reference catalyst fcr a given set of<br>
temperatures and LHSVs. In addition, it is possible to<br>
lower the operating pressure to 2500 psig and still obtain<br>
a low saponif ication value. Obviously, one sould reduce<br>
the space velocity and increase the temperature to enable<br>
operation at even lower pressures; with this catalyse.<br>
Thus, the preferred embodiment of the present invention<br>
extruded in various shapes, offers the following advantages<br><br>
relative to current commercial catalyates much lower<br>
cost-to-fill, greater activity, lowered oporating pressure,<br>
and very good selectivity.<br><br>
