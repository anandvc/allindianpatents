				<td>1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to an apparatus for cooling a metal strip, comprising at<br>
least two nozzle fields which are disposed opposite of each other with respect<br>
to the metal strip conveyed continuously in its longitudinal direction and which<br>
comprise nozzles facing towards the respective strip surface and being at-<br>
tached to blowing boxes for a cooling gas, and flow conduits provided between<br>
the nozzles for discharging the cooling gas flows from the nozzles which are<br>
deflected on the surface of the strip.<br>
2.	Description of the Prior Art<br>
In order to prevent microstructural formations or precipitations after a heat<br>
treatment of metal strips, and of steel in particular, such metal strips need to be<br>
cooled very rapidly, which occurs with the help of a protective gas which is<br>
usually a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen for preventing oxidation reactions in<br>
the area of the surface of the strip. In order to achieve the required cooling-<br>
down gradients which for steel strips with a strip thickness of 1 mm lie from 50<br>
up to 150Â°C/s depending on the composition of the alloy, the cooling gas needs<br>
to be blown with rapid speed against the surface of the strip and needs to be<br>
removed from there again. For this purpose it is known (EP 1 029 933 B1) to<br>
provide blowing boxes which extend on either side of the metal strip in its longi-<br>
tudinal direction, which when positioned in a row are spaced from one another<br>
with lateral distance and which comprise flat-jet nozzles facing towards the re-<br>
spective strip surface and extending transversally to the longitudinal direction of<br>
the strip. These flat-jet nozzles of the individual blowing boxes which are dis-<br>
-    2    -<br><br>
posed successively behind one another at a distance in the longitudinal direc-<br>
tion of the strip complement one another into continuous rows of nozzles which<br>
extend transversally to the longitudinal direction of the strip. The cooling gas<br>
which flows from the flat-jet nozzles and is deflected on the strip surface can<br>
thus be removed between the rows of nozzles. Apart from the fact that in com-<br>
parison with flat-jet nozzles with nozzle fields made of round jet nozzles it is<br>
generally possible to achieve a more even application of the strip surface with<br>
the cooling gas, the flow conduits obtained between the individual rows of noz-<br>
zles are penetrated in this known apparatus by the blowing boxes, leading to<br>
uneven flow-off conditions which are accompanied by the likelihood that as a<br>
result of uneven cooling there will be warping of the strip, requiring subsequent<br>
straightening of the metal strip.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is thus based on the object of providing an apparatus for cooling<br>
a metal strip of the kind mentioned above in such a way that even cooling of<br>
the metal strip can be ensured with a high cooling-down gradient without any<br>
likelihood of warping of the strip.<br>
This object is achieved by the invention in such a way that the nozzles are<br>
combined in groups in nozzle strips which are disposed next to one another in<br>
parallel with lateral distance and which consist of gas conduits connected with<br>
the blowing boxes and comprising nozzle openings facing the respective strip<br>
surface and being distributed over the length of the nozzle strips, and that the<br>
flow conduits for removing the cooling gas flows are provided between the noz-<br>
zle strips extending transversally to the blowing boxes.<br>
By using gas conduits for the nozzle strips forming the cooling gas, nozzle<br>
fields with round jet nozzles can be simply provided, which are obtained by<br>
nozzle openings arranged in the nozzle strips and are distributed over the<br>
length of the nozzle strips. Advantageous removal of the cooling gas flow de-<br>
-    3    -<br><br>
fleeted on the strip surface is ensured by the spaces between the adjacently<br>
disposed nozzle strips, which cooling gas flows can be removed with a com-<br>
paratively low pressure loss through the flow conduits between the nozzle<br>
strips. As a result of the round jet nozzles and the removal of the cooling gas<br>
flows between the nozzle strips which deflected on the strip surface, advanta-<br>
geous cooling conditions can be maintained for the metal strip, so that an even<br>
cooling of the metal strip can be ensured without any likelihood of warping.<br>
In order to exclude any disadvantageous influence of the blowing boxes on the<br>
removal of the cooling gas, the nozzle strips can be connected at one of their<br>
face sides with the blowing boxes. In this case, the blowing boxes are situated<br>
outside of the flow area of the cooling gas flowing away from the nozzle strips.<br>
It is also possible to connect the nozzle strips in the middle of their longitudinal<br>
extension to the blowing boxes, which facilitates chaining the nozzle strips in<br>
their longitudinal direction by maintaining the nozzle distance beyond the<br>
chained nozzle strips. In order to ensure that an even cooling gas flow to the<br>
individual nozzle openings can be maintained within the nozzle strips, the noz-<br>
zle strips may taper in their flow cross section towards their end starting from<br>
their connection to the respective blowing box.<br>
In order to create especially advantageous constructional conditions, it can also<br>
be provided that the nozzle strips which are each provided with two rows of<br>
nozzles staggered against each other form the nozzles between two longitudi-<br>
nal wall sections with bulging portions which each complement the respective<br>
nozzle conduit and that the longitudinal wall sections which are between the<br>
bulging portions in a boundary section produce the separating walls connecting<br>
the nozzles of the two nozzle rows in an alternating manner, of which the longi-<br>
tudinal wall sections run apart to the longitudinal walls of the gas conduit. Since<br>
as a result of this measure only the face surfaces of the longitudinal edges of<br>
the longitudinal wall sections face towards the surface of the strip and said lon-<br>
gitudinal wall sections rest against each other in a boundary section between<br>
the individual nozzles which thus leads to the consequence that perpendicularly<br>
-    4     -<br><br>
extending separating walls are obtained in the area of the boundary sections<br>
resting against each other, which walls join the nozzles of the two rows in an al-<br>
ternating manner, the cooling gas flows which are deflected evenly in the case<br>
of round jet nozzles to all sides on the surface of the strip are split into two par-<br>
tial flows by the separating walls in the area of the nozzles strips in a manner<br>
which is advantageous to the flow, which partial flows are removed via the flow<br>
conduits between the nozzle strips. The longitudinal wall sections which move<br>
apart from the boundary sections in contact with each other to the longitudinal<br>
walls of the gas conduits for guide surfaces for the return flow of the cooling<br>
gas flows which flow along the deflected cooling gas flows to the flow conduits<br>
between the nozzle strips, which occurs with a reduced formation of eddy cur-<br>
rents which supports the outflow.<br>
The nozzles themselves are not formed by a nozzle opening but in addition by<br>
a nozzle conduit which is each obtained between the mutually oppositely paired<br>
bulging portions of the two longitudinal wall sections of each nozzle strip. This<br>
ensures an outlet direction determined by the alignment of the nozzle conduit<br>
for the cooling gases irrespective of the cross-sectional progress of the nozzle<br>
strip in the area of the nozzles, especially when the height of the separating<br>
walls as measured in the direction of the nozzle axes corresponds at least to<br>
the mean diameter of the nozzles because in this case the nozzle conduits<br>
have a minimum length corresponding to their mean diameter, which separat-<br>
ing walls are formed by the longitudinal wall sections of the nozzle strips which<br>
rest on each other.<br>
Since the separating walls connect the nozzles of the two nozzle rows of each<br>
nozzle strip in an alternating manner with each other, the bulging portion of the<br>
longitudinal wall section on the outside averted from the other row of nozzles<br>
would become larger than the inside facing the other row of nozzles in the case<br>
of a progress of the separating wall through the axes of the directly connected<br>
nozzles, which - when the bulging portions are embossed - would lead to dif-<br>
ferent loads of the longitudinal wall sections on the outside and inside. In order<br>
-    5    -<br><br>
to avoid the thus resulting disadvantages, the abutting surfaces between the<br>
longitudinal wall sections forming the nozzles can be situated in the area of the<br>
individual nozzles in a diametrical plane of the nozzles extending in the longitu-<br>
dinal direction of the nozzle strip, so that symmetrical conditions are obtained<br>
with respect to the bulging portions of the two longitudinal wall sections of the<br>
nozzle strips, which bulging portions are situated opposite each other in pairs.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The illustrated cooling apparatus for a metal strip 1 comprises in accordance<br>
with Figs. 1 to 3 a housing 2 through which the metal strip 1 to be cooled is<br>
conveyed in a continuous manner in the feeding direction s. Blowing boxes 3<br>
for a cooling gas such as a gas mixture of 95% by volume of nitrogen and 5%<br>
-    6    -<br><br>
by volume of hydrogen are provided on either side of the metal strip 1. Nozzle<br>
strips 4 are connected to said blowing boxes 3 which extend next to one an-<br>
other in parallel and form flow conduits 5 between themselves. The nozzle<br>
strips 4 themselves are arranged in the form of a gas conduit 6 which is rectan-<br>
gular in its cross section and which tapers away from the blowing boxes 3 and<br>
comprises round nozzle openings 7 on the side facing the metal strip 1. The<br>
nozzle openings 7 are distributed over the length of the nozzle strips 4 con-<br>
nected to the respective blowing box 3 and are arranged in a row, so that a<br>
nozzle field is obtained with round jet nozzles which are distributed evenly over<br>
a surface section of the metal strip 1, as is shown especially in Fig. 2. The noz-<br>
zle openings 7 of adjacent nozzle strips 4 are provided with a staggered con-<br>
figuration.<br>
The cooling gas streams flowing from the nozzle openings 7 against the strip<br>
surface are deflected on the strip surface and removed from the metal strip 1<br>
through the flow conduits 5 between the nozzle strips 4, as is indicated by the<br>
flow arrows in Fig. 3. Since the housing 2 forms a collecting chamber for the<br>
removed cooling gas flows, the cooling gas can be removed from the housing 2<br>
via discharge nozzles 8. According to the embodiment, the nozzle strips 4 ex-<br>
tend in the longitudinal direction of the metal strip 1, i.e. in the direction of feed,<br>
which thus allows, among other things, the formation of nozzles 7 with flow<br>
cross sections which differ over the length of the nozzle strips without having to<br>
fear any uneven cooling of the strip because due to the fact that the nozzle<br>
strips 4 are the same among each other an even distribution of the flow of the<br>
cooling gas is ensured transversally to the longitudinal direction of the strip.<br>
Moreover, the cooling apparatus can be adjusted in a simple manner to differ-<br>
ent strip widths when nozzle strips 4 on the boundary side are blocked off from<br>
the associated blowing boxes 3, so that these nozzle strips 4 outside of the<br>
width of the metal strip 1 are no longer supplied with cooling gas. The align-<br>
ment of the nozzle strips 4 in the longitudinal direction of the metal strip 1 is not<br>
mandatory.<br>
-    7     -<br><br>
The embodiment according to Figs. 4 and 5 differs substantially from the one<br>
according to Figs. 1 to 3 only by the shape of the nozzle strips 4 which are<br>
connected to the blowing boxes 3 in the center of their longitudinal extension.<br>
The gas conduit 6 of the nozzle strips 4 thus extends to both sides of the asso-<br>
ciated blowing box 3, thus again leading to a tapering towards the ends of the<br>
gas conduit 6 in order to achieve an even supply of the nozzle openings 7. As<br>
is shown in Fig. 5, two rows of nozzle openings 7 are provided for each nozzle<br>
strip 4, with the nozzle openings 7 of the two rows being provided with a stag-<br>
gered arrangement. Coinciding nozzle strips 4 can be used with such an ar-<br>
rangement of the nozzle openings 7, thus simplifying production.<br>
According to the embodiment in accordance with Figs. 6 to 9, the nozzle field is<br>
formed by nozzle conduits 9 which are distributed evenly over the surface sec-<br>
tion of the metal strip 1. In accordance with Fig. 9, the cooling gas flows exiting<br>
from the nozzle conduits 9 against the strip surface are deflected on the strip<br>
surface again and removed from the metal strip 1 through flow conduits 5 be-<br>
tween the nozzle strips 4, as is indicated by the flow arrows.<br>
The individual nozzles 7 of each nozzle strip 4 are formed between two longitu-<br>
dinal wall sections 10 of the nozzle strips 4. These longitudinal wall sections 10<br>
are provided with bulging portions 11 which are situated opposite of each other<br>
in pairs and complement the nozzle conduits 9 and between which the longitu-<br>
dinal wall sections 10 rest on each other in a boundary section, and the nozzles<br>
7 of the two nozzle rows lead to separating walls 12 which connect each other<br>
in an alternating manner, as is shown especially in Fig. 8. The longitudinal wall<br>
sections 10 move away from each other to the longitudinal walls 14 of the gas<br>
conduits 6 of the nozzle strips 4 from said separating walls 12 by forming guide<br>
surfaces 13 for the cooling gas flows. The separating walls 12 thus divide the<br>
cooling gas flows deflected on the strip surface in the area of each nozzle strip<br>
4 into two partial streams and remove them according to the illustration in Fig. 9<br>
to both sides of the nozzle strips 4, thus creating advantageous flow conditions<br>
for the return flow of the deflected cooling gas flows. As a result of the longitu-<br>
-    8    -<br><br>
dinal wall sections 10 which move apart relative to the longitudinal walls 14 of<br>
the gas conduit 6, dissymmetry occurs in the inflow region of the individual<br>
nozzle conduits 9 which may have a disadvantageous effect on the alignment<br>
of the cooling gas flows exiting from nozzles 7. In order to exclude such a dis-<br>
advantageous influence, the nozzle conduits 9 can have a minimum length<br>
which corresponds to their mean diameter.<br>
Fig. 8 shows that the abutting surfaces 15 between the longitudinal wall sec-<br>
tions 10 in the area of the nozzles 7 lie in a diametrical plane of the nozzle con-<br>
duits 9 which extend in the longitudinal direction of the nozzle strips 4. This<br>
constitutes an advantageous precondition for an even formation of the bulging<br>
portions 11 which are situated opposite of each other in pairs and thus a more<br>
even loading of the two longitudinal wall sections 10 during the embossing of<br>
the bulging portions 11.<br>
