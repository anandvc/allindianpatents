				<td>The present invention relates to a method and devices for<br>
performing security control in electronic message exchanges<br>
and in particular for monetary transactions such as those<br>
made with credit or debit cards and the like.<br>
Security problems in the exchange of messages in electronic<br>
form and especially over intrinsically unsafe networks like<br>
for example the networks making up Internet are known.<br>
Among the various problems there can be listed the<br>
possibility that someone might generate messages (in<br>
particular, monetary transaction requests) by falsifying<br>
the owner of the message and the possibility that actual<br>
messages might be duplicated to obtain that a request<br>
contained in the message be met again.<br>
In the prior art it has been sought to remedy some aspects<br>
of these problems, for example by introducing systems like<br>
the so-called 'electronic signature' which however allows<br>
having reasonable certainty of the identity of the owner of<br>
the message but not of the uniqueness of the message.<br>
Known systems are however in general complicated and<br>
difficult to apply and/or they generate an overload in the<br>
processing and/or transmission of messages which are not<br>
always acceptable and especially in the case of<br>
applications which they produce and must manage a high<br>
number of message in relatively short times such as for<br>
example with monetary transactions by credit or debit card<br>
and especially if used to pay for goods or services on<br>
internet or in stores having POS terminals or the like.<br>
An example of system for performing security controls in electronic message<br>
exchanges is disclosed by WO 00/35143, wherein different identifiers and secret<br>
values are employed for generating a secure message.<br>
The general purpose of the present invention is to remedy the above mentioned<br>
shortcomings by making available a method and devices for security verification<br>
in the exchange of messages electronically which would be fast, easy to apply<br>
and intrinsically reliable.<br>
In view of this purpose it was sought to provide in accordance with the present<br>
invention a method for verifying the security of a message transmitted and<br>
received in electronic form which on the transmitting side comprises the steps of<br>
associating with the message for its later security verification a univocal message<br>
identifier and an identifier for control of the identity of the owner of the message<br>
with the control identifier being obtained by applying to the univocal message<br>
identifier an encoding associated with the owner of the message to be<br>
transmitted, and on the receiving side for security verification of a received<br>
message comprises the steps of verification and signaling of the fact of having or<br>
not having already received a message with the same univocal identifier of the<br>
associated message, applying a decoding associated with a supposed owner of<br>
the received message to the checking identifier of the owner associated with the<br>
received message, and ascertaining and signaling the agreement or not between<br>
the univocal message identifier associated with the received message and proven<br>
to be said decoding of the control username.<br>
Again in accordance with the present invention it was sought to realize a system<br>
for safety verification of a<br>
message transmitted and received in electronic form<br>
comprising on the transmitting side a univocal username<br>
generator of a message, and an encoding device receiving<br>
the message username produced by the generator and encoding<br>
it in accordance with a code associated with the owner of<br>
the message to be transmitted to obtain . therefrom an<br>
identifier for checking the identity of the message owner,<br>
and transmission means associating with the message to be<br>
transmitted the checking identifier and the univocal<br>
message identifier obtained, and on the receiving side<br>
comprises for safety verification of a received message a<br>
checking device which verifies and signals that the message<br>
identifier associated with the received message has of has<br>
not been received previously, and a decoding device which<br>
receives the owner checking identifier associated with the<br>
received message and applies thereto a decoding associated<br>
with a supposed owner of the received message, and<br>
verification means which ascertain and signal the agreement<br>
or not of the univocal message identifier with the result<br>
of the decoding of the checking username.<br>
Again in accordance with the present invention it was also<br>
sought to realize a device for association of security<br>
verification factors with a message transmitted in<br>
electronic form characterized in that it comprises a<br>
univocal message username generator, an encoding device<br>
receiving the message username produced by the generator<br>
and encoding it in accordance with a code associated with<br>
the owner of the message to be transmitted to obtain<br>
therefrom an identifier for checking the identity of the<br>
message owner, and means which associate with the message<br>
to be transmitted the checking identifier and the univocal<br>
message identifier obtained.<br>
To clarify the explanation of the innovative principles of<br>
the present invention and its advantages compared with the<br>
prior art there is described below with the aid of the<br>
annexed drawings a possible embodiment thereof by way of<br>
non-limiting example applying said principles. In the<br>
accompanying drawing:<br>
FIG 1 shows a block diagram of a device or part on the<br>
transmitting side of a security verification system<br>
realized in accordance with the present invention,<br>
FIG 2 shows a block diagram of a device or part on the<br>
receiving side of a security verification system realized<br>
in accordance with the present invention, and<br>
FIG 3 shows diagrammatically a possible combination of<br>
information in accordance with the method of the present<br>
invention.<br>
With reference to the figures, FIG 1 shows the part on the<br>
transmitting side designated as a whole by reference number<br>
10 of a security system realized in accordance with the<br>
present invention. This part or device 10 comprises a<br>
generator 11 for generation of a univocal message username<br>
(designated by IDMsg) and an encoding device 12 which<br>
receives the message username IDMsg produced by the<br>
generator and encodes it to obtain an encoded version<br>
thereof called here identifier IDCR which will be usable as<br>
clarified below as the identifier for checking the identity<br>
of the message owner.<br>
The device 10 is associated with a known system 13 (not<br>
described here as it is well known and readily imaginable<br>
to those skilled in the art) for production of messages Msg<br>
to be transmitted and of which it is wished to ensure the<br>
security offered by the present invention. These messages<br>
can be conventional electronic messages for management of<br>
monetary transactions of, for example, a credit or debit<br>
card circuit.<br>
The generator 11 is a known generator of single keys. It<br>
can be realized either as hardware or software, for example<br>
the known GUID generator of Microsoft. Its main operational<br>
principle is based on the random generation of a key or ID<br>
sufficiently long to make the probability of generating two<br>
identical keys practically zero. For each message to be<br>
sent, the generator therefore produces an identifier which<br>
can be represented by a sequence of bits, numbers,<br>
characters et cetera and which is the only one and will<br>
never be used again. This ensures that no "twin" keys<br>
exist.<br>
The ID of the message (which can also be called LEFT KEY)<br>
is surely to be understood therefore as a key but produced<br>
before and thus a new key.<br>
The encoding device 12 encodes the IDMsg so as to obtain a<br>
username IDCR containing the IDMsg in a concealed manner<br>
making it possible if the correct decoding is known to go<br>
back to it or at least to a representation thereof allowing<br>
knowing whether IDCR was really created by correct encoding<br>
of IDMsg. The IDCR can also be called RIGHT KEY.<br>
With a message Msg are thus associated the two usernames<br>
(unique for each message) IDMsg and IDCR. As clarified below,<br>
the former allows knowledge of the uniqueness of a message<br>
while the second allows having confirmation of the identity<br>
of the owner who produced the message or to whom it refers.<br>
Indeed, encoding of IDMsg in IDCR is done in accordance with<br>
a code which was previously associated with the owner of<br>
the message to be transmitted. For example it is<br>
advantageous that the encoding and the following<br>
corresponding decoding be realized as encryption and<br>
decryption operations with a key and with a particular key<br>
or algorithm associated with the particular owner of the<br>
message. In particular, such encryption and decryption can<br>
be advantageously of the known public/private key type in<br>
which the encryption is done by the - encoding device 12<br>
using the private secret key of the owner who sends the<br>
message or to whom it refers.<br>
Once the usernames to be associated with the message are<br>
obtained they can be sent to the receiving part of the<br>
system through a suitable known transmission means, for<br>
example internet, dedicated networks, telephone lines et<br>
cetera. The transmission means and the paths followed by<br>
the various usernames and the message can be the same for<br>
all or different from each other depending on specific<br>
requirements or desires.<br>
IDMsg and IDCR can also be assembled in a single compound<br>
identifier IDT which can also be called SUPER KEY = LEFT<br>
KEY + RIGHT KEY.<br>
If a single transmission means is used, the usernames and<br>
the message can be assembled in a single total MSGT<br>
message. All this is shown clearly in FIG 3. If desired,<br>
this total message can be in turn encrypted in accordance<br>
with known techniques.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention the message is<br>
also associated with a username IDowner, unique for each<br>
possible owner of the message to be transmitted. For<br>
example, in case of a transaction by credit card said<br>
IDowner can be the card number. This IDowner can be produced<br>
or extracted by means 14, for example a programmed<br>
electronic memory, manual input means or reading means of<br>
owner data contained on a card used in the transaction.<br>
This IDowner can also be used to control correct encoding in<br>
the encoding device 12.<br>
Known methods of combination of the various parts and<br>
possible known transmission codifications even dependent on<br>
the particular means of transmission and even desired for<br>
implementation of additional security levels can be used.<br>
All this is readily imaginable to those skilled in the art<br>
and is not further discussed or shown.<br>
FIG 2 shows the part designated as a whole by reference<br>
number 16 of the system in accordance with the present<br>
invention present on the message receiving side.<br>
To verify the security of a received message (Msg) (which<br>
can be processed in accordance with the intended use of the<br>
message by any known processing system 17, for example a<br>
transaction manager not further discussed here, said<br>
receiving part 16 comprises a control device 18 to<br>
recognize whether an IDMsg associated with a received<br>
message has not been received previously. For recognition,<br>
the device 18 manages an archive of previously used IDs 19.<br>
Every time an IDMsg arrives the device checks in the archive<br>
19 whether it has already been memorized and issues a<br>
corresponding ID acceptable or unacceptable signal 20. If<br>
the ID has not been used yet the associated message is<br>
considered new and the ID is memorized in the archive to<br>
prevent future new use.<br>
The receiving part 16 also comprises a decoding device 21<br>
which receives the control identifier of the owner IDCR<br>
associated with the received message and applies to it a<br>
decoding associated with a supposed owner of the received<br>
message. At outlet from the decoder an identifier IDDCR is<br>
thus obtained. The decoding is realized in such a manner<br>
that there is a predetermined agreement between IDMsg and<br>
IDDCR if the IDCR had been obtained for encoding of the IDMsg<br>
by the method associated with the message owner.<br>
Verification means 22 receive the IDMsg and IDDCR and<br>
ascertain and signal with a signal 23 the existence or not<br>
of said predetermined agreement. If there is agreement the<br>
message can be considered as belonging to its legitimate<br>
owner. If both the conditions at the outlets 20 and 23 are<br>
verified positively the device 16 emits a positive<br>
verification signal 24 and the message Msg associated with<br>
the usernames received can be considered acceptable on the<br>
basis of the security verification in accordance with the<br>
present invention.<br>
As may be seen again in FIG 2, the agreement signal 23 can<br>
also be sent to the sole ID recognizer 18 so as to inhibit<br>
memorization of the message ID among the IDs already used<br>
in case agreement between IDMsg and IDCR is not found. This<br>
avoids useless memorization of 'false' IDs among the IDs<br>
already used. The decoding device 21 will usually operate<br>
in reverse of the encoding device 12 in such a manner that<br>
if the encoder 12 obtains a certain IDCR from a specific<br>
IDMsg the decoder will again obtain the same IDMsg starting<br>
form the IDCR. In this case the agreement verification made<br>
by the device 22 will be a verification of sameness among<br>
received IDMsg and decoded IDCR.<br>
If, as mentioned above, the encoder makes a key encryption<br>
the decoder will make a corresponding key decryption. The<br>
keys associated with the owners will be memorized in a<br>
purposeful key archive 25.<br>
For example if the encryption system chosen is with<br>
public/private key, the decoder will perform a decryption<br>
as called for by said known system by using the appropriate<br>
key corresponding to the owner associated with the message.<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, if<br>
on the transmitting side the above mentioned owner<br>
identifier (IDowner) is also associated with the message, on<br>
the receiving side the decoding to be applied can<br>
advantageously be selected from among a plurality of<br>
possible decodings on the basis of the owner identifier<br>
associated with the received message. Selection of the<br>
right key from the archive 25 thus becomes much faster<br>
since the IDowner is supplied to the decryption device 21 as<br>
a search index for the right key in the key archive 25.<br>
It is now clear that it is possible to realize a device 10<br>
for association of safety verification factors with a<br>
message transmitted in electronic form and a system 10, 16<br>
for a security verification of a message transmitted and<br>
received in electronic form and a method for a security<br>
verification of a message transmitted and received in<br>
electronic form.<br>
As readily imaginable to those skilled in . the art, the<br>
practical realization can be totally software, totally<br>
hardware or mixed.<br>
The device 10 can also be realized in portable form (for<br>
example a smart card) to be supplied for example to a<br>
credit card owner who can thus generate an IDT or SUPER KEY<br>
to be supplied together with the other data (amount to be<br>
debited thereto, card number et cetera) for payment by<br>
card. These data can be considered the message MSG and if<br>
necessary encrypted in accordance with a known system.<br>
As an alternative the device could be kept at the store<br>
where the purchase is made and the card owner could input<br>
therein in a reserved manner the encoding key for<br>
production of the RIGHT KEY part of the SUPER KEY which<br>
would thus be generated by the apparatus.<br>
The security of the system in accordance with the present<br>
invention is evident from the above description.<br>
The SUPER KEYs are to be considered public as they are<br>
transmitted over channels which are intrinsically unsafe<br>
but which conceal within them in protected mode the<br>
univocity of both the message and the owner.<br>
An organization supplying the above mentioned service could<br>
supply to the customer an adequate hardware and/or software<br>
support (even directly integrated in an 'intelligent'<br>
credit card) and by means of this support the customer<br>
would be able to send the SUPER KEY generated through<br>
either a private or a public position. The SUPER KEY can<br>
cover (in the example of the monetary transaction) the same<br>
steps covered by the information of the normal credit or<br>
debit card. The SUPER KEY once used is recorded in the<br>
database of the organization and thus becomes inactive.<br>
Whoever tried to reuse it would nullify the request and<br>
interception of the SUPER KEY is thus useless. The SUPER<br>
KEY can also be understood as 'single use' identification.<br>
A dishonest user could refuse to use his own unique key<br>
generator but steal one of the keys already produced by<br>
another user and create a twin thereof. The key would<br>
however be unusable because each time a user makes a<br>
transaction by using the generator of unique keys, the key<br>
generated is added to the list present in the<br>
organization's database. The database contains the list of<br>
all the LEFT KEYs produced over time and only LEFT KEYS,<br>
not RIGHT or SUPER KEYs, and ensures that the keys already<br>
produced are unusable. The predetermined biunivocal<br>
agreement between the user and the corresponding algorithm<br>
or encoding/decoding key with the corresponding archive of<br>
keys and/or algorithms with the organization ensures the<br>
possibility for the organization to really distinguish two<br>
users and reject counterfeit requests or messages. Since<br>
the message uniqueness identifier reaches the organization<br>
both in clear and encoded form it is impossible to falsify<br>
only the message uniqueness identifier within a SUPER KEY.<br>
Naturally the above description of an embodiment applying<br>
the innovative principles of the present invention is given<br>
by way of non-limiting example of said principles within<br>
the scope of the exclusive right claimed here.<br>
For example the message MSG can be of any known type, even<br>
encrypted, to be decrypted upon arrival in accordance with<br>
any known method. These operations can also be performed by<br>
the same devices 12, 21 which encode and decode the message<br>
identifier.<br>
The message identifier can also be assembled with the<br>
message before encoding and the encoding can then be<br>
performed on the result of the assembly to have an<br>
identifier IDCR incorporated in encrypted form in the<br>
transmitted message to then be decoded' and extracted on the<br>
receiving side.<br>
The owner identifier can be a specific identifier assigned<br>
by the manager of the service or a unique already existing<br>
identifier chosen conventionally. For example in the case<br>
of a natural person owner, his taxpayer's code number,<br>
driving license number, credit card number et cetera may be<br>
used.<br>

- a univocal message identifier generator (IDMsg),<br>
- an encoding device which receives the message identifier<br>
(IDMsg) produced by the generator and encodes it in accordance<br>
with a unique code dependent on the owner of the message to<br>
be transmitted to obtain therefrom an identifier (IDCR) for<br>
checking the identity of the message owner,<br>
- means which append to the message to be transmitted the<br>
checking identifier (IDCR) and the univocal message identifier<br>
(IDMsg) obtained.<br>
13. Device as claimed in claim 12, wherein the encoding device is a keyed<br>
encryption device.<br>
14. Device as claimed in claim 12 wherein it issues a compound identifier<br>
(IDT) made up of the combination of the univocal message identifier<br>
(IDMsg) and the identifier (IDCR) for checking the identity of the message<br>
owner.<br>
DATED THIS 3RD DAY OF JUNE 2005<br><br>
A method for verifying the security of a message (Msg) transmitted and received<br>
in electronic form comprises on the transmitting side the steps of associating<br>
with the message a univocal message identifier (IDMsg) and a message owner<br>
identity checking identifier (IDCR) which is obtained by applying to the univocal<br>
message identifier (IDMsg) an encoding (12) associated with the owner of the<br>
message to be transmitted. On the receiving side the method comprises the<br>
steps of verification and signaling of the fact of having or not having already<br>
received a message with the same univocal message identifier (IDMsg) associated<br>
and ascertaining agreement between the univocal message identifier (IDMsg)<br>
associated with the received message and the result (IDDCR) of a decoding of<br>
the checking username (IDCR). A verification system and device in accordance<br>
with the method are also disclosed.</td>
