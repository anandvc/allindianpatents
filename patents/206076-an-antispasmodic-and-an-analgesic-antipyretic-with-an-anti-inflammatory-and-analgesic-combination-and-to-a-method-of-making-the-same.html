Celsius and the relative humidity below 60%. The mixer was run for 25 minutes<br><br><br>
at 30 r.p.m. so that a homogenous mixture of the particles of Camylofin and the<br>
above said inert excipients resulted.<br>
200 gms of ethyl cellulose was mixed with 5 Kg of isopropyl alcohol in a stainless<br>
steel [s.s.] tank under continuous stirring until the binder was completely<br>
dissolved in the solvent.   The solution was then added to the planetary mixer<br>
containing the homogenous mixture of the particles of Camylofin with the<br>
excipients.<br>
Wet mixing was then commenced for 20 minutes at 15 r.p.m. to obtain a wet<br>
homogenous mixture mass.<br>

perforated sieve to obtain camylofin granules of mesh size 8 to 12 mm.<br>
The wet granules were subjected to drying:<br>
The granules were subjected to heated drying at a temperature of 50 to 60<br>
degrees Celsius in a tray drier for 6 hrs. The drying mass was raked during the<br>
process. The Loss on drying was 1.2%.<br>

below 25 degrees Celsius and the relative humidity below 60%. The mixer was<br>
run for 25 minutes at 30 r.p.m. so that a homogenous mixture of the particles of<br>
actives and the diluents resulted.<br>
600 gms of povidone was mixed with 6 Kg of isopropyl alcohol in a stainless<br>
steel [s.s.] tank under continuous stirring until a clear solution is formed and the<br>
binder was completely dissolved in the solvent. The solution was then added to<br>
the planetary mixer containing the homogenous mass.<br>

homogenous mixture mass.<br><br><br>
The   wet homogenous mixture mass was milled, in a multimill fitted with 12 mm<br>
perforated sieve to obtain granules of mesh size 8 to 12 mm.<br>

degrees Celsius in a fluidized bed dryer for 1.5 hrs. The drying mass was raked<br>
during the process. The Loss on drying was 2%.<br>
The dry granules were sifted in an 18-mesh vibrosifter to obtain uniform size.<br>

addition of 6.0 kg methylene chloride and 100 ml of propylene glycol with<br>
constant stirring till to obtain a uniform slurry.<br><br><br>

sprayed one after another by following the usual method.<br>
The de-dusted cores were transferred into a coating pan and the tablet bed was<br>
heated by inching process using hot air blower. The initial temperature was set<br>
at 40°C. Once the tablet bed attains 45°C it was ready for spray coating with the<br>
coating suspension.   The cores were coated with the coating suspension. The<br>
relative humidity was maintained below 60 % throughout. The coated tablets<br>

(MEDICAL TRIALS)<br>
Trials were conducted by administering the tablets of the above examples to<br>
patients suffering from spasmodic pain with slight fever and headache.   Some<br>
patients were administered paracetamol, nimesulide and diclofenac separately<br>
and tablets of the above said formulation were given to some patients having the<br><br><br>
above indications. Significant results were obtained for the formulation of this invention over separate dose of paracetamol or nimesulide or diclofenac in different patients.
