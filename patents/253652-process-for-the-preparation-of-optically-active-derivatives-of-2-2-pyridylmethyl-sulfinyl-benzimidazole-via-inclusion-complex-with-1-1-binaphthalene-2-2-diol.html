				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of optically<br>
active derivatives of 2-(2-piridylmethylsulfinyl)-benzimidazole from racemic<br>
derivatives of 2-(2-piridylmethylsulfinyl)-benzimidazole.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Various derivatives of 2-(2-piridinylmethylsulfinyl)-benzimidazole are known<br>
as inhibitors of the proton pump and they are effective on the treatment of<br>
gastric ulcer. Omeprazole, 5-methoxy-2-[[(4-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl-2-<br>
piridyl)methyl]sulfinyl]-1 H-benzimidazole; lansoprazole,<br>
2-[[[3-methyl-4-(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)-2-pyridinyl]methyl]sulfinyl]-1H-<br>
benzimidazole; pantoprazole, 5-(difluoromethoxy)-2-[[(3,4-dimethoxy-2-<br>
pyridinyl)methyl]sulfinyl]-1 H-benzimidazole; and rabeprazole,<br>
2-[[[4-(3-methoxypropoxy)-3-methyl-2-pyridinyl]methyl]sulfinyl]-1H-<br>
benzimidazole stand out among these compounds. These compounds are<br>
sulfoxides with a center of asymmetry on the sulphur atom, therefore they<br>
exist in the form of a racemic mixture of two enantiomers.<br>
In the last years, the preparation of the enantiomers of pharmacologically<br>
active compounds has shown a growing interest because they can show<br>
improved pharmacokinetic and biological properties with regard to the<br>
racemic mixture.<br>
Among the known enantiomers of the derivatives of 2-(2-<br>
piridinylmethylsulfinyl)-benzimidazole is the Esomeprazole with the formula (I)<br>
shown below. It is the (S) enantiomer of the racemic product omeprazole. The<br>
S configuration corresponds to the (-)-enantiomer.<br><br><br>
Several methods for the separation of the enantiomers of omeprazole were<br>
described. In DE 4035455, it is described a process of resolution of<br>
omeprazole that uses a diastereomeric ether that is separated and later is<br>
hydrolised in an acidic solution.<br>
A process for the preparation of the magnesium salt of S-omeprazole based<br>
on the resolution of the racemic omeprazole by formation of a diastereomeric<br>
ester is described in EP 652.872-A.<br>
The separation of the enantiomers of a prazole that comprises the reaction<br>
with an agent of coordination (transition metal), a quelating agent and an<br>
organic acid, and the later separation of the resulting diastereomeric adduct<br>
is described in WO04/2982-A.<br>
Finally, a resolution process of omeprazole by forming inclusion complexes<br>
with bi-2-naphthol, bi-2-phenanthrol or derivatives of tartaric acid is described<br>
in CN 1.223.262. The enantiomers are recovered from the inclusion complex<br>
by chromatography. An 87% of enantiomeric excess (e.e.) is obtained at the<br>
best conditions described in this document, but it requires to use a<br>
benzene/hexane mixture as solvent. Benzene is a solvent that has a high<br>
toxicity, therefore it is not suitable for working at large scale. With other<br>
hydrocarbons such as toluene or xylene, an e.e. lower than 62% is obtained,<br>
which would make the process non-viable at industrial scale. This process<br>
also shows the typical problems of using chromatography at a large scale.<br>
Likewise, the reproduction of the experimental conditions for the preparation<br>
of the compounds of interest described in this document shows that, in fact,<br>
the products are obtained with low global yield. The same synthetic route is<br><br>
used in Jingen Deng's et al. article, "Resolution of omeprazole by inclusion<br>
complexation with a chiral host Binol", Tetrahedron Asymmetry 2000. vol. 11,<br>
pp. 1729-1732, whose authors are inventors of the patent. Nevertheless, the<br>
only solvent described is a benzene/hexane mixture that shows the<br>
disadvantages described before.<br>
Therefore, it is of interest the provision of an alternative process for the<br>
preparation of each of the individual enantiomers of derivatives of<br>
2-(2-piridinylmethylsulfinyl)-benzimidazole. In particular, if they are easily<br>
industrializable and do not involve the use of dangerous solvents nor the<br>
separation by chromatographic techniques.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the<br>
preparation of each of the enantiomers of the derivatives of<br>
2-(2-piridinylmethylsulfinyl)-benzimidazole, particularly to obtain each one of<br>
the enantiomers of omeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole and rabeprazole.<br>
The inventors have found that the resolution of prazoles may be performed in<br>
presence of an amine through the formation of inclusion complexes with one<br>
of the two enantiomers of a substituted [1,1'-binaphthalene]-2,2'-diol, with<br>
high yields and high optical purity, by a process that does not involve the use<br>
of dangerous solvents nor chromatographic separation. The enantiomer of<br>
the derivative of 2-(2-piridinylmethylsulfinyl)-benzimidazole may be recovered<br>
from the inclusion complex by a treatment with a hydroxide of an alkaline<br>
metal and extractions at a particular pH with a suitable organic solvent.<br>
Thus, according to an aspect of the present invention, it is provided a process<br>
for the preparation of each one of the substantially pure enantiomers of the<br>
racemic compound of formula (I), or a salt thereof, as well as its solvates<br>
including hydrates,<br><br><br>
wherein R1 ,R2 and R3 are radicals, same or different, which are selected from<br>
the group consisting of H; (C1-C3)-alkyl; (C1-C3)-alkoxyl optionally substituted<br>
by one or several atoms of fluorine; and (C1-C3)-alkoxy-(C1-C3)-alkoxyl; and<br>
R4 is a radical selected from the group consisting of H and (C1-C3)-alcoxyl<br>
optionally substituted by one or more atoms of fluorine; which comprises:<br>
a)	treating the compound of formula (I) in a racemic mixture form with one of<br>
the two enantiomers of a substituted [1,1'-Binaphthalene-2,2'-diol, in a<br>
mixture of an amine and a suitable solvent, in order to separate an inclusion<br>
complex formed by one of the enantiomers of the compound of formula (I)<br>
with one of the enantiomers of the substituted [1,1'-Binaphthalene]-2,2'-diol;<br>
b)	treating the inclusion complex obtained in the previous step with a<br>
hydroxide of an alkaline metal in a mixture of water and an organic solvent<br>
which is inmiscible or little miscible in water to give one of the enantiomers of<br>
the compound of formula (I) in a free base form, or in a salt form thereof; and<br>
c)	in case of obtaining an enantiomer of the compound of formula (I) in a free<br>
base form, optionally, convert it to a salt thereof.<br>
By substantially pure enantiomer is understood the one with an enantiomeric<br>
excess enough to a large-scale preparation, what depends on each particular<br>
case as those skilled in the art will detect at the moment of the exploitation of<br>
the invention. Generally, the process may be useful industrially with at least<br>
95% of enantiomeric excess (e.e.), even if desired it is possible to achieve at<br>
least 99% of e.e. through the process of the present invention.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the substantially pure enantiomer of the<br>
compound of formula (I) is that wherein R1 is methyl; R2 is<br><br>
2,2,2-trifluoroethoxyl; and R3 and R4 are hydrogen. In other preferred<br>
embodiment R1 and R2 are methoxyl; R3 is hydrogen; and R4 is<br>
difluoromethoxyl. In other preferred embodiment, R1 is methyl; R2 is<br>
3-methoxy-propoxyl; and R3 and R4 are hydrogen. In other preferred<br>
embodiment R1 and R3 are methyl; and R2 and R4 are methoxyl.<br>
The strategy used in the resolution of the racemic mixture is based on the<br>
formation of inclusion complexes with diastereomic character by addition of a<br>
chiral agent. As is already known by the person skilled in the art,<br>
diastereomers, unlike enantiomers, have different physical properties, for<br>
example solubility, which allows their separation. The selection of the<br>
enantiomer of the sustituted [1,1 '-Binaphthalen]-2,2'-diol to use will be done<br>
experimentally to achieve the desired enantiomer of the compound of formula<br>
(!)■<br><br>
Preferably, the inclusion complex is formed with the (S)-(-)-1,1'-Binaphthalen]-<br>
2,2'-diol of formula (II) or with the (RH+)-[1,r-Binaphthalen]-2,2'-diol of<br>
formula (II'), although other sustituted [1,1'-Binaphthalen]-2,2'-diols may be<br>
used.<br>
Thus, to obtain the S-omeprazole, an inclusion complex is formed by the<br>
treatment of omeprazole with the (SH-[1.1'-Binaphthalenl-2,2-diol of<br>
formula (II). The enantiomeric excess of the complex obtained with S-<br>
omeprazole is about 97%.<br>
The most suitable conditions to perform the process vary with the parameters<br>
considered by the person skilled in the art, as for example starting materials,<br>
temperature and similars. These parameters will be adjusted for every case to<br>
achieve the maximum amount of inclusion complex with the derivative of<br><br>
2-(2-piridylmethylsulfinyl)-benzimidazole. These conditions can be readily<br>
determined by said person skilled in the art through routine tests, and with<br>
help of the matter taught in the examples of the present description.<br>
Preferably, the molar ratio of the starting materials is 0.5 to 3 mol of the<br>
corresponding enantiomer of the [1,1'-binaphthalen]-2,2'-diol per mol of<br>
racemic compound. More preferably, the molar ratio ranges from 1.2 to 2<br>
moles of the [1,1'-binaphthalen]-2,2'-diol per mol of racemic compound. The<br>
most preferred molar ratio is 1.5 mol of the corresponding [1,1'-binaphthalen]-<br>
2,2'-diol per mol of racemic compound.<br>
Preferably, the used solvent is an aromatic hydrocarbon such as toluene or<br>
xylene, or a mixture of said aromatic hydrocarbons with an aliphatic<br>
hydrocarbon (C6-C8) such as hexane, cyclohexane or heptane. Preferably the<br>
solvent is selected from toluene, xylene, toluene/heptane mixtures,<br>
toluene/hexane mixtures, xylene/heptane mixtures and xylene/hexane<br>
mixtures. The amounts of solvent vary with the starting materials. Usually this<br>
amount is comprised between 5 and 50 ml/g. Preferably between 6 and 37<br>
ml/g. More preferably about 12 ml/g.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the amine is a tertiary amine such as<br>
triethylamine, tributylamine, and tripropylamine. In a more preferred<br>
embodiment, the tertiary amine is triethylamine. The amount of amine varies<br>
with the starting materials. Usually this amount is comprised between 0.01<br>
and 5 ml/g. Preferably between 0.1 and 1 ml/g. More preferably about 0.2<br>
ml/g.<br>
Usually, the formation of the inclusion complex is performed at a temperature<br>
comprised between 20°C and the reflux temperature of the solvent used.<br>
Preferably at a temperature comprised between 50 and 100 °C.<br>
The inclusion complex formed at the first stage can be isolated from the<br>
reaction medium by filtration. After the filtration, the inclusion complex is<br>
formed by one of the enantiomers of the [1,1'-binaphthalen]-2,2'-diol and one<br>
of the enantiomers of the derivative of 2-(2-piridylmethylsulfinyl)-<br>
benzimidazole, and the filtrate mainly contains the other enantiomer of the<br>
derivative of 2-(2-piridylmethylsulfinyl)-benzimidazole.<br><br>
One or several recrystallizations of the inclusion complex may be performed,<br>
if desired, to increase the e.e. Preferably, it is carried out with an (C1-C4)<br>
alcohol, preferably with ethanol, or with one of the solvents used to form the<br>
inclusion complex mentioned above.<br>
To obtain the desired enantiomer of the derivative of<br>
2-(2-piridylmethylsulfinyl)-benzimidazole which is a part of the inclusion<br>
complex, said inclusion complex must be broken. This break may be<br>
performed by a treatment with a hydroxide of an alkaline metal in a mixture of<br>
water and an organic solvent that is inmiscible or little miscible in water.<br>
Preferably, the hydroxide of an alkaline metal is sodium hydroxide or<br>
potassium hydroxide. More preferably, the hydroxide of an alkaline metal is<br>
sodium hydroxide.<br>
Also preferably, the organic solvent that is inmiscible or little miscible in water<br>
is selected from aromatic hydrocarbons (C6-C8) such as toluene or xilene;<br>
aliphatic chlorides (C1-C3) such as methylene chloride or chloroform, and<br>
aliphatic ethers (C2-C8) such as ethyl ether, isopropyl ether or tert-butylmethyl<br>
ether.<br>
The amounts of solvent and water vary with the inclusion complex. Usually<br>
the amount of solvent is comprised between 1 and 30 ml/g of inclusion<br>
complex. Preferably between 6 and 15 ml/g. Likewise, the amount of water is<br>
usually comprised between 1-30 ml/g of inclusion complex. Preferably<br>
between 4 and 15 ml/g.<br>
Once the complex has been broken, the pH of the reaction medium is<br>
adjusted and the phases are separated. Thus, the enantiomer of the used<br>
[1,1'-binaphthalen]-2,2'-diol, which is mainly in the organic phase, is<br>
separated from the enantiomer of the derivative of 2-(2-piridylmethylsulfinyl)-<br>
benzimidazole that remains mainly in the aqueous phase. Preferably the<br>
separation is performed at a pH comprised between 10.5 and 12.5. More<br>
preferably between 11.0 and 12.0.<br>
The enantiomer of the derivative of 2-(2-piridylmethylsulfinyl)-benzimidazole<br><br>
in a free base form is isolated by extractions of the aqueous phase at a lower<br>
pH, preferably between 6-10, with a solvent that is inmiscible or little miscible<br>
in water and, optionally, it can be transformed into a salt thereof by<br>
conventional methods.<br>
Preferably, the solvent is selected from (C6-C8) aromatic hydrocarbons such<br>
as toluene or xilene; (C1-C3) aliphatic chlorides such as methylene chloride or<br>
chloroform, and (C2-C8) aliphatic ethers such as ethyl ether, isopropyl ether or<br>
tert-butylmethyl ether.<br>
Alternatively, the salt of one of the substantially pure enantiomers of the<br>
compound of formula (I) may be obtained directly from the reaction medium<br>
by treatment with a salt of an alkaline or alkaline earth metal. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, the salt of an alkaline or alkaline earth metal is an halide of an<br>
alkaline or alkaline earth metal. In a more preferred embodiment, the halide of<br>
an alkaline or alkaline earth metal is the magnesium chloride.<br>
An advantage of the present invention is the fact that this process for the<br>
preparation of each of the substantially pure enantiomers of derivatives of<br>
2-(2-piridylmethylsulfinyl)-benzimidazole can provide any of the enantiomers<br>
with equal ease. Likewise, the present invention provides a brief and efficient<br>
process for the preparation of the enantiomers of derivatives of<br>
2-(2-piridylmethylsulfinyl)-benzimidazole, with high yields and high optical<br>
purity. Furthermore, the enantiomer with opposite absolute configuration<br>
could be racemized, what would allow recycling it through the fabrication<br>
process and would avoid loosing starting material. Likewise, the resolution<br>
agent can be recovered from the organic phase and it can be used in the next<br>
fabrication.<br>

(54) Title: PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF OPTICALLY ACTIVE DERIVATIVES OF 2-(2-PYRIDYLMETHYL- ,<br>
SULFINYL)-BENZIMIDAZOLE VIA INCLUSION COMPLEX WITH 1,1'-BINAPHTHALENE-2, 2'DIOL<br>
(57) Abstract: Process for the preparation of optically active derivatives of 2-(2-piridylmethylsulfinyl)-benzimidazole, or salts<br>
thereof, by resolution of the corresponding racemic derivatives of 2-(2-piridylmethylsulfinyl)-benzimidazole. The resolution is performed <br>
through the formation of inclusion complexes with (S)-(-) or (R)-(+)-[1,1'-Binaphthalene]-2,2'-diol in the presence of an<br>
amine, followed by the break of the inclusion complex by treatment with an hydroxide of an alkaline metal. The enantiomer of the<br>
derivative of 2-(2-piridylmethylsulfinyl)-benzimidazole may be obtained by extractions at a particular pH with a suitable organic<br>
solvent. The process allows to perform the resolution with high yields and high optical purity, without using neither toxic solvents<br>
nor chromatography.</td>
