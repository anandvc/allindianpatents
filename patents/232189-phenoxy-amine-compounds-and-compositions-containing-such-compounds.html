				<td>PHENOXY AMINE COMPOUNDS AND COMPOSITIONS<br>
FOR DELIVERING ACTIVE AGENTS<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/350,488, filed November 13, 2001, and U.S.<br>
Provisional Application No. 60/357,288, filed February 15, 2002,<br>
both of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to phenoxy amine compounds<br>
for delivering active agents, such as biologically or<br>
chemically active agents, to a target. These compounds are<br>
well suited for forming non-covalent mixtures with active<br>
agents for oral, intracolonic, pulmonary, and other routes of<br>
administration to animals. Methods for the preparation and<br>
administration of such compositions are also disclosed.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Conventional means for delivering active agents are often<br>
severely limited by biological, chemical, and physical<br>
barriers. Typically, these barriers are imposed by the<br>
environment through which delivery occurs, the environment of<br>
the target for delivery, and/or the target itself.<br>
Biologically and chemically active agents are particularly<br>
vulnerable to such barriers.<br>
In the delivery to animals of biologically active and<br>
chemically active pharmacological and therapeutic agents,<br>
barriers are imposed by the body. Examples of physical<br>
barriers are the skin, lipid bi-layers and various organ<br>
membranes that are relatively impermeable to certain active<br>
agents but must be traversed before reaching a target, such as<br>
the circulatory system. Chemical barriers include, but are<br>
not limited to, pH variations in the gastrointestinal (GI)<br>
tract and degrading enzymes.<br>
These barriers are of particular significance in the<br>
design of oral delivery systems. Oral delivery of many<br>
biologically or chemically active agents would be the route of<br>
choice for administration to animals if not for biological,<br>
chemical, and physical barriers. Among the numerous agents<br>
which are not typically amenable to oral administration are<br>
biologically or chemically active peptides, such as calcitonin<br>
and insulin; polysaccharides, and in particular<br>
mucopolysaccharides including, but not limited to, heparin;<br>
heparinoids; antibiotics; and other organic substances. These<br>
agents may be rapidly rendered ineffective or destroyed in the<br>
gastro-intestinal tract by acid hydrolysis, enzymes, and the<br>
like. In addition, the size and structure of macromolecular<br>
drugs may prohibit absorption.<br>
Earlier methods for orally administering vulnerable<br>
pharmacological agents have relied on the co-administration of<br>
adjuvants (e.gr., resorcinols and non-ionic surfactants such as<br>
polyoxyethylene oleyl ether and n-hexadecylpolyethylene ether)<br>
to increase artificially the permeability of the intestinal<br>
walls, as well as the co-administration of enzymatic<br>
inhibitors (e.g., pancreatic trypsin inhibitors,<br>
diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFF) and trasylol) to inhibit<br>
enzymatic degradation. Liposomes have also been described as<br>
drug delivery systems for insulin and heparin. However, broad<br>
spectrum use of such drug delivery systems is precluded<br>
because: (1) the systems require toxic amounts of adjuvants or<br>
inhibitors; (2) suitable low molecular weight cargos, i.e.<br>
active agents, are not available; (3) the systems exhibit poor<br>
stability and inadequate shelf life; (4) the systems are<br>
difficult to manufacture; (5) the systems fail to protect the<br>
active agent (cargo) ; (6) the systems adversely alter the ,â€¢<br>
active agent; or (7) the systems fail to allow or promote<br>
absorption of the active agent.<br>
Proteinoid microspheres have been used to deliver<br>
Pharmaceuticals. See, for example, U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
5,401,516; 5,443,841; and Re. 35,862. In addition, certain<br>
modified amino acids have been used to deliver<br>
Pharmaceuticals. See, for example, U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
5,629,020; 5,643,957; 5,766,633; 5,776,888; and 5,866,536.<br>
More recently, a polymer has been conjugated to a<br>
modified amino acid or a derivative thereof via a linkage<br>
group to provide for polymeric delivery agents. The modified<br>
polymer may be any polymer, but preferred polymers include,<br>
but are not limited to, polyethylene glycol (PEG), and<br>
derivatives thereof. See, for example, International Patent<br>
j<br>
Publication No. WO 00/40203.<br>
International Patent Publication Nos. WO 01/32130 and WO<br>
01/32596 disclose particular phenyl amine carboxylic acid<br>
compounds and phenoxy carboxylic acid compounds for delivering<br>
active agents. International Publication No. WO 00/50386 also<br>
discloses amine delivery agents.<br>
However, there is still a need for simple, inexpensive<br>
delivery systems which are easily prepared and which can<br>
deliver a broad range of active agents by various routes.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Delivery Agent Compounds<br>
The terms "alkyl", "alkenyl", and "alkynyl" as used<br>
herein include linear and branched alkyl, alkenyl, and alkynyl<br>
substituents, respectively.<br>
The delivery agent compounds may be in the form of the<br>
free base or salts thereof. Suitable salts include, but are<br>
not limited to, organic and inorganic salts, for example<br>
ammonium, acetate salt, citrate salt, halide (preferably<br>
hydrochloride), hydroxide, sulfate, nitrate, phosphate,<br>
alkoxy, perchlorate, tetrafluoroborate, carboxylate, mesylate,<br>
fumerate, malonate, succinate, tartrate, acetate, gluconate,<br>
and maleate. Preferred salts include, but are not limited to,<br>
citrate and mesylate salts. The salts may also be solvates,<br>
including ethanol solvates, and hydrates.<br>
Salts of the delivery agent compounds of the present<br>
invention may be prepared by methods known in the art. For<br>
example, citrate salts and mesylate salts may be prepared in<br>
ethanol, toluene and citric acid.<br>
In general, the amine compounds of the present invention,<br>
i.e. where R7 is -NR18R19, may be prepared by reacting the<br>
appropriate phenol with either (1) the appropriate<br>
dihalogenated alkyl chain or (2) the appropriate<br>
haloalkylalcohol which can then be transoformed into an<br>
appropriate leaving group, such as a methane sulfonic ester<br>
(e.g., by reaction with methanesulfonyl chloride), creating an<br>
ether compound with an active leaving group that is<br>
subsequently reacted with the appropriate amine optionally in<br>
the presence of a base, such as triethylamine. To obtain the<br>
corresponding salt the amine compound is reacted with the<br>
appropriate acid, i.e. to make the citric acid salt, the amine<br>
is reacted with citric acid and preferably with an excess of<br>
citric acid. To obtain the corresponding quaternary ammonium<br>
salt where R7 is -NR18R19 R20 (where R18, R19, R20 are not<br>
hydrogen), the amine moiety of the amine compound is alkylated<br>
by methods known in "the art.<br>
The delivery agent compound may be purified by<br>
recrystallization or by fractionation on one or more solid<br>
chromatÂ©graphic supports, alone or linked in tandem. Suitable<br>
recrystallization solvent systems include, but are not limited<br>
to, ethanol, water, heptane, ethyl acetate, acetonitrile,<br>
acetone, methanol, and tetrahydrofuran (THF) and mixtures<br>
thereof. Fractionation may be performed on a suitable<br>
chromatographic support such as alumina, using methanol/npropanol<br>
mixtures as the mobile phase; reverse phase<br>
chromatography using trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile<br>
mixtures as the mobile phase; and ion exchange chromatography<br>
using water or an appropriate buffer as the mobile phase.<br>
When anion exchange chromatography is performed, preferably a<br>
0-500 mM sodium chloride gradient is employed.<br>
The delivery agent may contain a polymer conjugated to it<br>
by a linkage group selected from the group consisting of -<br>
NHC(0)NH-, -C(0)NH-,-NHC(0), -OOC-, -COO-, -NHC(O)O-, -<br>
OC(0)NH-, -CH2NH -NHCH2-, -CH2NHC(O)O-, -OC (0)NHCH2-, -<br>
CH2NHCOCH2O-, -OCH2C(O)NHCH2-, - NHC(0)CH20-, -OCH2C(0)NH-, -NH-<br>
, -0-, and carbon-carbon bond, with the proviso that the<br>
polymeric delivery agent is not a polypeptide or polyamino<br>
acid. The polymer may be any polymer including, but not<br>
limited to, alternating copolymers, block copolymers and<br>
random copolymers, which are safe for use in mammals.<br>
Preferred polymers include, but are not limited to,<br>
polyethylene; polyacrylates; polymethacrylates;<br>
poly(oxyethylene); poly(propylene); polypropylene glycol;<br>
polyethylene glycol (PEG); and derivatives thereof and<br>
combinations thereof. The molecular weight of the polymer<br>
typically ranges from about 100 to about 200,000 daltons. The<br>
molecular weight of the polymer preferably ranges from about<br>

Delivery Bystems<br>
The composition of the present invention comprises one or<br>
more delivery agent compounds of the present invention, and<br>
one or more active agents. In one embodiment, one or more of<br>
the delivery agent compounds, or salts of these compounds, or<br>
poly amino acids or peptides of which these compounds or salts<br>
form one or more of the units thereof, may be used as a<br>
delivery agent by mixing with the active agent prior to<br>
administration to form an administration composition.<br>
The administration compositions may be in the form of a<br>
liquid. The solution medium may be water (for example, for<br>
salmon calcitonin, parathyroid hormone, and erythropoietin) ,<br>
25% aqueous propylene glycol (for example, for heparin) and<br>
phosphate buffer (for example, for rhGH). Other dosing<br>
vehicles include polyethylene glycol. Dosing solutions may be<br>
prepared by mixing a solution of the delivery agent compound<br>
with a solution of the active agent, just prior to<br>
administration. Alternately, a solution of the delivery agent<br>
compound (or active agent) may be mixed with the solid form of<br>
the active agent (or delivery agent compound). The delivery<br>
agent compound and the active agent may also be mixed as dry<br>
powders. The delivery agent compound and the active agent can<br>
also be admixed during the manufacturing process.<br>
The dosing solutions may optionally contain additives<br>
such as phosphate buffer salts, citric acid, glycols, or other<br>
dispersing agents. Stabilizing additives may be incorporated<br>
into the solution, preferably at a concentration ranging<br>
between about 0.1 and 20% (w/v).<br>
The administration compositions may alternately be in the<br>
form of a solid, such as a tablet, capsule or particle, such<br>
as a powder or sachet. Solid dosage forms may be prepared by<br>
mixing the solid form of the compound with the solid form of<br>
the active agent. Alternately, a solid may be obtained from a<br>
solution of compound and active agent by methods known in the<br>
art, such as freeze-drying (lyophilization), precipitation,<br>
crystallization and solid dispersion.<br>
The administration compositions of the present invention<br>
may also include one or more enzyme inhibitors. Such enzyme<br>
inhibitors include, but are not limited to, compounds such as<br>
actinonin or epiactinonin and derivatives 'thereof. Other<br>
enzyme inhibitors include, but are not limited to, aprotinin<br>
(Trasylol) and Bowman-Birk inhibitor.<br>
The amount of active agent used in an administration<br>
composition of the present invention is an amount effective to<br>
accomplish the purpose of the particular active agent for the<br>
target indication. The amount of active agent in the<br>
compositions typically is a pharmacologically, biologically,<br>
therapeutically, or chemically effective amount. However, the<br>
amount can be less than that amount when the composition is<br>
used in a dosage unit form because the dosage unit form may<br>
contain a plurality of delivery agent compound/active agent<br>
compositions or may contain a divided pharmacologically,<br>
biologically, therapeutically, or chemically effective amount.<br>
The total effective amount can then be administered in<br>
cumulative units containing, in total, an effective amount of<br>
the active agent.<br>
The total amount of active agent to be used can be<br>
determined by methods known to those skilled in the art.<br>
However, because the compositions of the invention may deliver<br>
active agents more efficiently than compositions containing<br>
the active agent alone, lower amounts of biologically or<br>
chemically active agents than those used in prior dosage unit<br>
forms or delivery systems can be administered to the subject,<br>
while still achieving the same blood levels and/or therapeutic<br>
effects.<br>
The presently disclosed delivery agent compounds<br>
facilitate the delivery of biologically and chemically active<br>
agents, particularly in oral, intranasal, sublingual,<br>
intraduodenal, subcutaneous, buccal, intracolonic, rectal,<br>
vaginal, mucosal, pulmonary, transdermal, intradermal,<br>
parenteral, intravenous, intramuscular and ocular systems, as<br>
well as traversing the blood-brain barrier.<br>
l<br>
Dosage unit forms can also include any one or combination<br>
of excipients, diluents, disintegrants, lubricants,<br>
plasticizers, colorants, flavorants, taste-masking agents,<br>
sugars, sweeteners, salts, and dosing vehicles, including, but<br>
not limited to, water, 1,2-propane diol, ethanol, olive oil,<br>
or any combination thereof.<br>
The compounds and compositions of the subject invention<br>
are useful for administering biologically or chemically active<br>
agents to any animals, including but not limited to birds such<br>
as chickens; mammals, such as rodents, cows, pigs, dogs, cats,<br>
primates, and particularly humans; and insects.<br>
The system is particularly advantageous for delivering<br>
chemically or biologically active agents that would otherwise<br>
be destroyed or rendered less effective by conditions<br>
encountered before the active agent reaches its target zone<br>
(i.e. the area in which the active agent of the delivery<br>
composition is to be released) and within the body of the<br>
animal to which they are administered. Particularly, the<br>
compounds and compositions of the present invention are useful<br>
for orally administering active agents, especially those that<br>
are not ordinarily orally deliverable, or those for which<br>
improved delivery is desired.<br>
The compositions comprising the compounds and active<br>
agents have utility in the delivery of active agents to<br>
selected biological systems and in an increased or improved<br>
bioavailability of the active agent compared to administration<br>
of the active agent without the delivery agent. Delivery can<br>
be improved by delivering more active agent over a period of<br>
time, or in delivering the active agent in a particular time<br>
period (such as to effect quicker or delayed delivery), or in<br>
delivering the active agent at a specific time, or over a<br>
period of time (such as sustained delivery).<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is a method<br>
for the treatment or prevention of a disease or for achieving<br>
a desired physiological effect, such as those listed in the<br>
table below, in an animal by administering the composition of<br>
the present invention. Preferably, an effective amount of the<br>
composition for the treatment or prevention of the desired<br>
disease or for achieving the desired physiological effect is<br>
administered. Specific indications for active agents can be<br>
found in the Physicians' Desk Reference (54th Ed., 2000,<br>
Medical Economics Company, Inc., Montvale, NJ), which is<br>
herein incorporated by reference. The active agents in the<br>
table below include their analogs, fragments, mimetics, and<br>
polyethylene glycol-modified derivatives.<br>
Active Agent<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
For example, one embodiment of the present invention is a<br>
method for treating a patient suffering from or susceptible to<br>
diabetes by administering insulin and at least one of the<br>
delivery agent compounds of the present invention.<br>
Following administration, the active agent present in the<br>
composition or dosage unit form is taken up into the<br>
circulation. The bioavailability of the agent can be readily<br>
assessed by measuring a known pharmacological activity in<br>
blood, e.g. an increase in blood clotting time caused by<br>
heparin, or a decrease in circulating calcium levels caused by<br>
calcitonin. Alternately, the circulating levels of the active<br>
agent itself can be measured directly.<br>

A mixture of 4-benzyloxyphenol (10.23 grams, 51.2 mmol)<br>
and ethyl 8-bromooctanoate (12.80 grams, 51.0 mmol) in 200 ml<br>
of 2-butanone was treated with 13.8 grams of potassium<br>
carbonate (100 mmol) and heated to reflux for 16 hours. The<br>
cooled reaction mixture was filtered. The filtrate was<br>
combined with 100 ml of ethyl acetate and washed in sequence<br>
with 2N NaOH, water, IN HC1 and brine, dried over anhydrous<br>
sodium sulfate. Solvent was removed by rotary evaporator to<br>
give a white solid as the product.<br>
The 18.53 grams (50.1 mmol) of the ester obtained above<br>
was dissolved in 200 ml of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran. Lithium<br>
aluminum hydride (1.9 grams, 50 mmol) was added slowly through<br>
a powder funnel. This mixture was stirred at room temperature<br>
for 2 hours before cooled in an ice bath. Water (2 ml) was<br>
added slowly followed by 6 ml of 15% NaOH and then another 2<br>
ml of water. The mixture was stirred overnight before<br>
filtration. The filtrate was concentrated to give 16.3 grams<br>

The 16.3 grams (49.7 mmol) of alcohol obtained above was<br>
dissolved in a mixture of 200 ml of methylene chloride and 10<br>
ml of N,N-dirnethylacetamide. Triethylamine (7.30 grams, 72.3<br>
mmol) was added. The resulting mixture was cooled in an icebath<br>
before methanesulfonyl chloride (7.39 grams, 64.5 mmol)<br>
was added. The mixture was then warmed to room temperature<br>
and stirred for 20 hours. The mixture was then washed in<br>
sequence with water, IN HCl, water, saturated sodium<br>
bicarbonate, water and brine, dried over sodium sulfate.<br>
Evaporation of the solvent afforded 21.25 grams of product.<br>

dissolved in 100 ml of N,N-dimethylacetamide and treated with<br>
sodium azide (5.01 grams, 77.1 mmol). The mixture was heated<br>
at 120Â°C for three hours before cooled to room temperature.<br>
The mixture was then poured into 200 ml water, and the large<br>
amount of the solid formed was collected by vacuum filtration<br>
(17.25 grams).<br>
The azide (16.64 grams, 47.1 mmol) obtained above was<br>
dissolved in 200 isopropanol and treated with ammonium formate<br>
(11.87 grams, 188.4 mmol). The mixture was heated to 60Â°C<br>
before palladium on carbon (10% in weight, 1.0 grams) was<br>
added slowly through a powder funnel. The reaction was<br>
stirred at 60Â°C for one hour before cooled to room temperature.<br>
Solvent was removed by rotary evaporation to obtain 13.09<br>

6- (2-acetylphenoxy) -1-dimethylaminohexane hydrochloride<br>
A solution of 9.32 g (68.5 tnmol) of 2-<br>
hydroxyacetophenone, 11.3 mL (9.94 g, 68.5 mmol) of 6-<br>
dimethylamino-1-hexanol, and 18.00 g (68.6 mmol) of<br>
triphenylphosphine in 70 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF) was<br>
prepared. A solution of 13.5 mL (13.86 g, 68.6 mmol)-of<br>
diisopropyl azodicarboxylate (DIAD) in 30 mL of THF was added<br>
to the above solution over approximately 30 minutes. The<br>
reaction mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for 20<br>
hours, diluted with 100 mL of ethyl acetate and extracted with<br>
five 50 mL portions of 1% aqueous hydrochloric acid and two 30<br>
mL portions of 10% aqueous hydrochloric acid. The combined<br>
aqueous extracts were brought to pH=9.5 by the addition of 10<br>
N sodium hydroxide, and extracted with three 50 mL portions of<br>
ethyl acetate. The combined organic phase was dried over<br>
sodium sulfate and concentrated in vacuo. The resulting<br>
slurry was diluted with 10 mL of ethyl acetate and the solids<br>
removed by filtration through glass wool. The organic phase<br>
was concentrated in vacuo and refrigerated. The resulting<br>
solids were diluted with approximately 40 mL of 10% aqueous<br>
hydrochloric acid, and the insoluble fraction removed by<br>
filtration. The solution was brought to pH=9 with 1 N sodium<br>
hydroxide, washed with four 30 mL portions of ethyl acetate<br>
and one 30 mL portion of water, dried over sodium sulfate,<br>
concentrated in vacuo, and stored at -5 "C. The resulting<br>
solids were stirred in hexanes, and the insoluble fraction<br>
removed by filtration. Gaseous hydrochloric acid was bubbled<br>
through the filtrate. The hexanes were decanted off the<br>
resulting solids, and the solids were stirred in ethyl acetate<br>
for approximately 20 hours. These solids were collected by<br>
filtration to give 5.77 g (28.1%) of 6-(2-acetylphenoxy)-1-<br>

The 7-bromoheptyl 2-benzyloxyphenyl ether may be prepared<br>
in the same manner as above from 2-benzyloxyphenol and 1,7-<br>
dibromoheptane. A suspension of 16.49 g (149.7 mmol) of 2-<br>
isopropylimidazole, 28.80 g (76.33 mmol) of 7-bromoheptyl 2-<br>
benzyloxyphenyl, 11.2 ml of triethylamine and 150 ml of<br>
dioxane was heated to 80C, causing all the solids to go into<br>
solution. After stirring for 5 hr, the reaction mixture was<br>
cooled to 25C, diluted with 50n ml of methyl t-butyl ether and<br>
filtered. The filtrate was diluted with 2:1 methyl t-butyl<br>
ether and hexanes and washed with water (3 X 60 mL) and brine<br>
(1 X 40 mL). The organic phase (the top one) was dried over<br>
sodium sulfate concentrated.<br>
The crude 31.0 g of benzyl ether isolated above was<br>
dissolved in ethanol and cooled to -$C. The solid that formed<br>
was isolated and discarded. The filtrate was concentrated to<br>
half the volume (150 mL), treated with 0.50 g of 10% palladium<br>
on charcoal and placed under 53 psig of hydrogen in a Parr<br>
shaker. Approximately 4 psig of hydrogen was used up over 40<br>
hours. The catalyst was removed by filtration through a<br>
Celite pad. The filtrate was concentrated. After 2 days, a<br>
solid formed, was taken up in toluene, filtered off and<br>
recrystallized from ethanol/toluene. This solid was subjected<br>
to Kugelrohr distillation to remove the 2-isopropylimidazole<br>
impurity at 66C and 0.1 mm. Upon cooling 5.89 g of (2-<br>

A solution of 10.0 g (47.8 mtnol) of 8-bromo-l-octanol,<br>
10.41 g (120 tnmol) of morpholine and tetrahydrofuran was<br>
heated to reflux for 3 hr. The cooled reaction mixture was<br>
treated with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate and<br>
extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic phase was washed<br>
with brine, dried over magnesium sulfate and concentrated to<br>
give 10.50 g of 4-(8-hydroxyoctyl)morpholine.<br>
The crude 4-(8-hydroxyoctyl)-morpholine (2.0 g, 9.3 mmol)<br>
was dissolved in methylene chloride and treated with 10 ml of<br>
triethylamine (7.3 g, 72 mmol). After cooling in an ice bath,<br>
the mixture was treated with 1.28 g (11.2 mmol) of<br>
methanesulfonyl chloride stirring for 1 hr before warming to<br>
25C. After stirring for 2 hour, the reaction mixture was<br>
diluted with aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution and extracted<br>

Example 2<br>
2A: Insulin - Oral Delivery<br>
Oral dosing (PO) compositions of delivery agent compound<br>
and human zinc insulin (minimum 26 lU/mg available from<br>
Calbiochem - Novabiochem Corp, La Jolla, CA) were prepared in<br>
deionized water. Typically, 500 mg of delivery agent compound<br>
was added to 1.5 ml of water. The solution was vortexed, then<br>
heated (about 37Â°C) and sonicated. The pH was adjusted to<br>
about 7 to 8.5 with NaOH or HCl. Additional NaOH was added,<br>
if necessary, to achieve uniform solubility, and the pH readjusted<br>
to about 7 to 8.5. Water was then added to bring<br>
the total volume to about 2.4 ml and vortexed. About 1.25 mg<br>
insulin from an insulin stock solution (15 mg/ml made from<br>
0.5409 g insulin and 18 ml deionized water, adjusting with HCl<br>
and NaOH to pH 8.15 and to obtain a clear solution using 40 ml<br>
concentrated HCl, 25 ml ION NaOH and 50 ml IN NaOH) was added<br>
to the solution and mixed by inverting. The solution may be<br>
used in the dosing protocol immediately, or alternatively, the<br>
solution may be placed into a 37Â°C water bath for one hour<br>
prior to dosing. The final delivery agent compound dose,<br>
insulin dose and dose volume amounts are listed below in Table<br>
1.<br>
The typical dosing and sampling protocols were as<br>
follows. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing between about 200-<br>
250g were fasted for 24 hours and administered ketamine (44<br>
tng/kg) and chlorpromazine (1.5 mg/kg) 15 minutes prior to<br>
dosing and again as needed to maintain anesthesia. A dosing<br>
group of five animals was administered one of the dosing<br>
solutions. For oral dosing, an 11 cm Rusch 8 French catheter<br>
was adapted to a 1 ml syringe with a pipette tip. The syringe<br>
was filled with dosing solution by drawing the solution<br>
through the catheter, which was then wiped dry. The catheter<br>
was placed down the esophagus leaving 1 cm of tubing past the<br>
incisors. The dosing solution was administered by pressing<br>
the syringe plunger.<br>
Blood samples were collected serially from the tail<br>
artery, typically at time = 15, 30, 60, 120 and 180 minutes.<br>
The percent change in glucose levels from baseline is reported<br>
in Table 1.<br>
Table 1. Insulin - Oral Delivery<br>
Delivery<br>
Agent<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The aforementioned procedure was repeated with the<br>
following modifications:<br>
Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing from 250 to 300 g were<br>
used rather than rats weighing between 200 and 250 g. All<br>
animals were stored in wire cages. All animals were placed in<br>
the room in which the experiment was performed at least 30<br>
minutes before the experiment. All loud noises and voices<br>
were avoided to reduce stress to the animals.<br>
Test strips used to determine the level of glucose in<br>
blood samples were only exposed to light as needed. All test<br>
strips were stored individually in closed vials except during<br>
use.<br>
When running a control, the control solution was<br>
vigorously shaken, the first drop was discarded, the bottle<br>
tip was wiped off with a kirn wipe, and one drop was applied to<br>
a test strip.<br>
Blood samples were taken at t=0, 15, 30, 45, and 60<br>
minutes by the Farmer's Wife Technique. Each rat's tail was<br>
cut at tip (about 2 mm of the tail). The first drop of blood<br>
from the animal's tail was not used to take a blood glucose<br>
reading. A fresh drop of blood from the tip of each rat's<br>
tail was placed on the tip of a test strip.<br>
After baselines, the animals were orally dosed while<br>
fully conscience. No anesthesia was given.<br>
2B: Biotinylated Ribonuclease A (bRNase A) Oral Delivery<br>
Oral gavage (PO) dosing solutions of delivery agent<br>
compound and bRNase A (Sigma (Milwaukee, WI): Ribonuclease A<br>
Type XII-A from bovine pancreas) in deionized water is<br>
prepared by mixing. A solution of the delivery agent compound<br>
is made. The delivery agent compound solution is prepared in<br>
phosphate buffer and stirred. If necessary, the pH of the<br>
mixture is adjusted upwards by the addition of aliquots of<br>
NaOH of an appropriate normality until the delivery agent<br>
compound is completely dissolved. The final pH of the<br>
dissolved delivery agent compound is between 7.5 and 9.5. The<br>
final dosing solutions are prepared by mixing 9 volumes of the<br>
delivery agent compound solution with 1 volume of a bRNase A<br>
stock solution (20 mg bRNase A in phosphate buffered saline<br>
(PBS)). Final concentrations are 150 mg/ml delivery agent<br>
compound and 2 mg/ml bRNase A.<br>
The dosing and sampling protocols are as follows. Male<br>
Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 200-250 g are fasted for 24 hours<br>
and administered ketamine (44 mg/kg) and chlorpromazine (1.5<br>
mg/kg) 15 minutes prior to dosing and again as needed to<br>
maintain anesthesia. A dosing group of five animals is<br>
administered one of the dosing solutions in the following<br>
manner. An 11 cm Rusch 8 French catheter is adapted to a 1 ml<br>
syringe with a pipette tip. The syringe is filled with dosing<br>
solution by drawing the solution through the catheter, which<br>
is then wiped dry. The catheter is placed down the esophagus<br>
leaving 1 cm of tubing past the incisors. The dosing solution<br>
is administered by pressing the syringe plunger. Blood<br>
samples are collected serially from the tail artery at 15, 30,<br>
45, 60 and 90 minutes. Serum bRNase A concentrations are<br>
quantified by a modified immunoassay as described below.<br>
Biotinylation of Ribonucleaee A<br>
To label each of the RNase A molecules with one biotin<br>
molecule, the ratio of the activated biotin is maintained at 3<br>
moles biotin/ 1 mole RNase A. In a representative<br>
biotinylation reaction 500 mg of RNase A is dissolved in 20 ml<br>
of 50 mM NaHCO3, pH 7.6. 57.08 mg of EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-LC<br>
Biotin (Pierce Chemical Company, Rockford, IL) is added to the<br>
solution, dissolved and allowed to stand on ice for 2 hours.<br>
The reaction mix is then dialyzed (10,000 MW cutoff dialysis<br>
membrane (Pierce, Rockford, Illinois)) against 4 liters of PBS<br>
at 4Â° C. overnight. The reaction mixture is placed in 4 liters<br>
of fresh PBS and dialyzed for an additional 4 hours. The<br>
dialyzed bRNase A is removed from the dialysis membrane,<br>
diluted to a final volume of 25 ml with PBS (final<br>
concentration of bRNase A = 20 mg/ml), and stored a 4Â° C.<br>
Assay of Serum Levels of Orally Administered bRNase A<br>
In general 100 nl aliquots of the rat sera collected at<br>
the various time points are placed in the appropriate wells of<br>
a 96 well Reacti-Bind Streptavidin Coated Polystyrene Plates<br>
(Pierce). After a 2 hour incubation period the plates are<br>
washed and then incubated with a polyclonal rabbit anti-RNase<br>
A (Chemicon, Pittsburgh, PA). After washing, the plates are<br>
incubated for 2 hours with a polyclonal goat anti-rabbit IgG<br>
(Chemicon, Pittsburgh, PA) conjugated to alkaline phosphatase.<br>
The plates are washed after the incubation and the amount of<br>
initially captured bRNase A is detected by the addition of<br>
para-nitrophenyl phosphate (a substrate for alkaline<br>
phosphatase) (Pierce, Rockford, Illinois). The amount of<br>
bRNase A circulating in the original rat sera is quantitated<br>
by comparison with a standard curve of bRNAse A which extends<br>
from 1000 - 0.1 ng/mL in fifteen two-fold dilutions. The<br>
maximum Â± standard deviation is given in Table 2 below.<br>

oxo-3 (2HO-quinazolinyl)-.[R-(R*,S*)]- (BIBN4096BS) in water<br>
were prepared. Typically, a solution of the delivery agent<br>
compound was prepared in water and stirred. The final dosing<br>
solutions were prepared by mixing the delivery agent compound<br>
with a BIBN4096BS stock solution and diluting to the desired<br>
volume (usually 1.0 mL). If necessary, the pH of the mixture<br>
was adjusted by the addition of aliquots of aqueous<br>
hydrochloric acid solution of an appropriate normality until<br>
the final pH of the dissolved delivery agent compound was<br>
below 7.0. The final compound amounts per dose were 25 mg/kg<br>
of BIBN4096BS and 200 mg/kg of delivery agent compound in a<br>
total volume of ImL/kg.<br>
The typical dosing and sampling protocols were as<br>
follows. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing between 200-250g<br>
were fasted for 24 hours and administered ketamine (44 mg/kg)<br>
and chlorpromazine (1.5 mg/kg) 15 minutes prior to dosing. A<br>
dosing group of five rats was administered one of the dosing<br>
solutions. For oral gavage (PO) dosing, an 11 cm Rusch 8<br>
French catheter was adapted to a 1 mL syringe with a pipette<br>
tip. The syringe was filled with dosing solution by drawing<br>
the solution through the catheter, which was then wiped dry.<br>
The catheter was placed down the esophagus leaving 1 cm of<br>
.tubing past the incisors. Solution was administered by<br>
pressing the syringe plunger. Blood samples were collected<br>
serially from the tail artery, typically at time =0, 15, 30,<br>
45, and 60 minutes for oral. Plasma BIBN4096BS concentrations<br>
were quantified by using a liquid chromatography/mass<br>
spectrometry/mass spectrometry assay method using UV<br>
detection. The standard range for the assay was 5-2,000 ng/mL.<br>
Previous studies indicated baseline values of about 10 ng/mL.<br>

2d. Oral Delivery of Daptomycin<br>
2d. Daptomycin - Oral/Intracolonic Delivery<br>
Dosing solutions containing a delivery agent compound and<br>
daptomycin (Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA) were<br>
prepared in 0.9% normal saline. A solution of the compound<br>
was made either with the sodium salt of the compound or by<br>
converting the free acid to its sodium salt. The free acid of<br>
the delivery agent compound was converted to the sodium salt<br>
with one equivalent of sodium hydroxide. This mixture was<br>
vortexed and placed in a sonicator (about 37Â°C) . The pH was<br>
adjusted to about 7.0-7.5 with aqueous HCl or NaOH.<br>
Additional NaOH was added, if necessary, to achieve uniform<br>
solubility, and the pH readjusted. The mixture was vortexed<br>
to produce a uniform solution, also using sonication if<br>
necessary. The delivery agent compound solution was mixed<br>
with daptomycin from a stock solution (200 mg daptomycin/mL in<br>
0.9% normal saline and the pH adjusted, if necessary, to<br>
between 6.0-7.0 with NaOH or HCl). The stock solution was<br>
stored frozen (-20Â°C) wrapped in foil, then thawed and warmed<br>
gradually to about 25Â°C before using. The delivery agentdaptomycin<br>
mixture was vortexed at low speed to produce a<br>
uniform solution. The pH was adjusted to about 7.0-7.5 with<br>
aqueous NaOH. The solution was then diluted with 0.9% normal<br>
saline to the desired volume (usually 2.0 ml) and<br>
concentration and stored wrapped in foil before use. The<br>
final delivery agent compound and daptomycin doses, and the<br>
dose volumes are listed below in Table 4.<br>
The typical dosing and sampling protocols were as<br>
follows. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing between 200-250 g<br>
were fasted for 24 hours and were anesthetized with ketamine<br>
(44 mg/kg) and thorazine (1.5 mg/kg) 15 minutes prior to<br>
dosing and again as needed to maintain anesthesia. A dosing<br>
group of five animals was administered one of the dosing<br>
solutions. For oral gavage (PO) dosing, an llcm Rusch 8<br>
French catheter was adapted to a 1 ml syringe with a pipette<br>
tip. The syringe was filled with dosing solution by drawing<br>
the solution through the catheter, which was then wiped dry.<br>
The catheter was placed down the esophagus leaving 1 cm of<br>
tubing past the incisors. Solution was administered by<br>
pressing the syringe plunger. For intracolonic (1C) dosing, a<br>
7.5cm, 8 fr Rusch catheter was adapted to a 1 ml syringe with<br>
a pipette tip. The dosing catheter was inserted into the<br>
colon through the anus until the tube was no longer visible.<br>
The dosing solution was expressed slowly into the colon by<br>
pressing the syringe plunger.<br>
Heparinized rat blood samples were collected via the<br>
ventral tail artery, typically at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 2.0,<br>
and 4.0 hours after dosing, and stored on ice. Blood samples<br>
were then spun (centrifuged) at 11,500 rpm for 4 minutes at<br>
4Â°C to obtain the plasma (supernatant), which was stored at -<br>
70Â°C. The plasma daptomycin concentrations were measured by<br>
isocratic reversed phase HPLC, keeping samples at 4Â°C during<br>
analysis. Blank plasma studies show baseline values of zero.<br>
Results from the animals in each group were averaged for<br>
each time point and the highest of these averages (i.e., mean<br>
peak daptomycin concentration, Qua*) is reported below in Table<br>

Oral dosing (PO) compositions of delivery agent compound<br>
and GRF analog g (available from Theratechnologies, Quebec<br>
Canada US Patent No. 5,861,379 and US Patent No. 6,020,311)<br>
were prepared in deionized water. Typically, 500 mg of<br>
delivery agent compound was added to 1.5 ml of water. The<br>
free base of the delivery agent compound was converted to the<br>
salt by stirring the resultant solution and adding one<br>
equivalent of hydrogen chloride. The solution was vortexed,<br>
then heated (at about 37Â°C) and sonicated. The pH was adjusted<br>
to about 7 to 8.5 with NaOH or HCl. Additional NaOH or HCl<br>
was added, if necessary, to achieve uniform solubility, and<br>
the pH re-adjusted to about 7 to 8.5. Water was then added<br>
to bring the total volume to about 2.4 ml and vortexed. About<br>
25 mg of GRF-Analog stock solution (50 mg/ml made from 100 mg<br>
GRF-Analog and 2 ml deionized water, adjusting with HCl to pH<br>
4.0) was added to the solution and mixed by inverting. The<br>
solution was immediately used in the dosing protocol, or<br>
alternatively, the solution was placed into a 37Â°C water bath<br>
for one hour prior to dosing.<br>
The typical dosing and sampling protocols were as<br>
follows. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing between about 200-<br>
250g were fasted for 24 hours and administered ketamine (44<br>

dosing and again as needed to maintain anesthesia. A dosing<br>
group of five animals was administered one of the dosing<br>
solutions. For oral dosing, an 11 cm Rusch 8 French catheter<br>
was adapted to a 1 ml syringe with a pipette tip. The syringe<br>
was filled with dosing solution by drawing the solution<br>
through the catheter, which was then wiped dry. The catheter<br>
was placed down the esophagus leaving 1 cm of tubing past the<br>
incisors. The dosing solution was administered by pressing<br>
the syringe plunger.<br>
Blood samples were collected serially from the tail<br>
artery, typically at time = 0, 15, 30, 60, &amp; 120 minutes.<br>
Plasma GRF-Analog levels were determined by RIA (first<br>
antibody Peninsula Labs, RIN 8061; second antibody Linco<br>
Research Labs, 5060-10). Plasma GRF-Analog concentrations<br>
(pg/ml) were measured for each time point for each of the five<br>
animals in each dosing group. The five values for each time<br>
point were averaged and the results plotted as plasma GRFanalog<br>
concentration versus time. The maximum (peak) are<br>
reported below in Table 6.<br>

Delivery<br>
(Table Removed)Dosing solutions of delivery agent compound and<br>
interferon alfacon-1 (IPN) (available as Infergen from<br>
InterMune, Inc. of Brisbane, CA) were prepared in deionized<br>
water. The free acid of the delivery agent compound was<br>
converted to the sodium salt with one equivalent of sodium<br>
hydroxide. Typically, a solution of the delivery agent<br>
compound was prepared in water and stirred, adding one<br>
equivalent of sodium hydroxide (1.0 N) when making the sodium<br>
salt. This mixture was vortexed and placed in a sonicator<br>
(about 37Â°C) . The pH was adjusted to about 7.0 to 8.5 with<br>
aqueous NaOH. The mixture was vortexed to produce a uniform<br>
suspension or solution, also using sonication and heat if<br>
necessary. Additional NaOH was added, if necessary, to<br>
achieve uniform solubility, and the pH re-adjusted to about<br>
7.0 to 8.5. The delivery agent compound solution was mixed<br>
with an IFN stock solution (about 22.0 to 27.5 mg/ml in<br>
phosphate buffered saline) and diluting to the desired volume<br>
(usually 3.0 ml). The final delivery agent compound and IFN<br>
doses, and the dose volumes are listed below in Table 6.<br>
The typical dosing and sampling protocols were as<br>
follows. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing between 200-250g<br>
were fasted for 24 hours and administered ketamine (44 mg/kg)<br>
and chlorpromazine (1.5 mg/kg) 15 minutes prior to dosing and<br>
again as needed to maintain anesthesia. A dosing group of<br>
five animals was administered one of the dosing solutions. An<br>
llcm Rusch 8 French catheter was adapted to a 1 ml syringe<br>
with a pipette tip. The syringe was filled with dosing<br>
solution by drawing the solution through the catheter, which<br>
was then wiped dry. The catheter was placed down the<br>
esophagus leaving 1 cm of tubing past the incisors. The<br>
dosing solution was administered by pressing the syringe<br>
plunger.<br>
Blood samples were collected serially from the tail<br>
artery, typically at time = 0, 15, 30, 45, 60 and 90 minutes.<br>
Serum IFN concentrations were quantified using Cytoscreen<br>
Immunoassay Kit for human IFN-alpha (catalog # KHC4012 from<br>
Biosource International, Camarillo, CA). Previous studies<br>
indicated baseline values of about zero. Results from the<br>
animals in each group were averaged for .each time point. The<br>
maximum of these averages (i.e., the mean peak serum IFN<br>
concentration) is reported below in Table 6.<br>
