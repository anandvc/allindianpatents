				<td>The present invention relates to Novel substituted [1, 1-Dimethyl-ethyl-amino)-I-hydroxy-ethyl]-6-hydroxy-4H-benzo[l,4]oxazin-3-ones) compounds<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
wherein the groups R1 , R2 and R3 may have the meanings given in the claims and in the specification, for preparing a pharmaceutical composition for the treatment of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), as well as new compounds of general formula 1 and processes for preparing them.<br>
Background to the invention<br>
 Betamimetics ((ÃŸ-adrenergic substances) are known from the prior art. Reference may be made, for example, to the disclosures of US 4,460,581, which proposes betamimetics for the treatment of a variety of complaints.<br>
For drug treatment of diseases it is often desirable to prepare medicaments with a longer duration of activity. As a rule, this ensures that the concentration of the active substance in the body needed to achieve the therapeutic effect is , guaranteed for a longer period without the need to re-administer the drug at frequent intervals. Moreover, giving an active substance at longer time intervals contributes to the well-being of the patient to a high degree.<br>
It is particularly desirable to prepare a pharmaceutical composition which can be used therapeutically by administration once a day (single dose). The use of a drug once a day has the advantage that the patient can become accustomed relatively quickly to taking the drug regularly at certain times of the day.<br>
The aim of the present invention is therefore to provide betamimetics which have a therapeutic benefit in the treatment of COPD and are characterised by<br><br><br>
a longer duration of activity and can thus be used to prepare pharmaceutical compositions with a longer duration of activity. A particular aim of the invention is to prepare betamimetics which, by virtue of their long-lasting effect, can be used to prepare a drug for administration once a day for treating COPD. In addition to the above objectives, the present invention also sets out to provide betamimetics which are not only exceptionally potent but are also characterised by a high degree of selectivity with respect to the p2-adreno-receptor.<br>

If desired, mixtures of the above acids may be used, particularly in the case of acids which have other properties in addition to their acidifying qualities, e.g. as flavourings, antioxidants or complexing agents, such as citric acid or ascorbic acid, for example. According to the invention, it is particularly preferred to use hydrochloric acid to adjust the pH.<br>
If desired, the addition of editic acid (EDTA) or one of the known salts thereof, sodium edetate, as stabiliser or complexing agent may be omitted in these<br><br>
formulations. Other embodiments may contain this compound or these compounds. In a preferred embodiment the content based on sodium edetate is less than 100 mg/100ml, preferably less than 50mg/100ml, more preferably less than 20mg/100ml. Generally, inhalable solutions in which the content of sodium edetate is from 0 to 10mg/100ml are preferred.<br>
Co-solvents and/or other excipients may be added to the propellant-free inhalable solutions. Preferred co-solvents are those which contain hydroxyl groups or other polar groups, e.g. alcohols - particularly isopropyl alcohol, glycols - particularly propyleneglycol, polyethyleneglycol, polypropyleneglycol, glycolether, glycerol, polyoxyethylene alcohols and polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters. The terms excipients and additives in this context denote any pharmacologically acceptable substance which is not an active substance but which can be formulated with the active substance or substances in the physiologically suitable solvent in order to improve the qualitative properties of the active substance formulation. Preferably, these substances have no pharmacological effect or, in connection with the desired therapy, no appreciable or at least no undesirable pharmacological effect. The excipients and additives include, for example, surfactants such as soya lecithin, oleic acid, sorbitan esters, such as polysorbates, polyvinylpyrrolidone, other stabilisers, complexing agents, antioxidants and/or preservatives which guarantee or prolong the shelf life of the finished pharmaceutical formulation, flavourings, vitamins and/or other additives known in the art. The additives also include pharmacologically acceptable salts such as sodium chloride as isotonic agents.<br>
The preferred excipients include antioxidants such as ascorbic acid, for example, provided that it has not already been used to adjust the pH, vitamin A, vitamin E, tocopherols and similar vitamins and provitamins occurring in the human body.<br>
Preservatives may be used to protect the formulation from contamination with pathogens. Suitable preservatives are those which are known in the art, particularly cetyl pyridinium chloride, benzalkonium chloride or benzoic acid or benzoates such as sodium benzoate in the concentration known from the prior art. The preservatives mentioned above are preferably present in concentrations of up to 50 mg/100 ml, more preferably between 5 and 20 mg/100ml.<br><br>
Preferred formulations contain, in addition to the solvent water and the active substance 1, only benzalkonium chloride and sodium edetate. In another preferred embodiment, no sodium edetate is present.<br>
The dosage of the compounds according to the invention is naturally highly dependent on the method of administration and the complaint which is being treated. When administered by inhalation the compounds of formula l_are characterised by a high potency even at doses in the ug range. The compounds of formula 1 may also be used effectively above the ug range. The dosage may then be in the gram range, for example.<br>
