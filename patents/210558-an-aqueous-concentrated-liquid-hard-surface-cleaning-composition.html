GERMICIDAL BLOOMING TYPE COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING BIPHENYL SOLVENTS<br>
The present invention relates to blooming type hard surface cleaning and disinfecting compositions. More particularly the present invention relates to concentrated liquid cleaning and disinfecting compositions which arc normally diluted in a larger volume of water to form a working solution therefrom, and which exhibit a blooming effect when diluted.<br>
Blooming is a property exhibited by dilutable compositions such as known cleaning compositions, specifically pine-oil type cleaning compositions which contain a significant amount (generally at least about 5% and more) of pine oil. Certain other known-art formulations, such as LYSOL (RTM) (where **RTM*' indicates a proprietary tradename, or trademark) disinfectant concentrate (Racket &amp; Colmnn, Inc., Montvale NJ) also exhibit such a blooming property. Blooming may be characterized as the formation of milky, creamy or cloudy appearance which is manifested when a dilutable composition is added to a larger volume or quantity of water.<br>
Such blooming is particularly desirable in compositions where the blooming characteristic in an aqueous dilution is long lasting.<br>
Accordingly it is an object of the invention to provide an aqueous concentrated liquid hard surface cleaning composition which blooms when added to jrlargerfvolTraje’ofiwater’hidrcom’’<br>
an organic solvent constituent;<br>
a germicidal constituent which provides a primary sanitizing benefit,<br>
preferably a quaternary ammonium compound; -binaryco’soivent’ystenrcomprising’nalkyldiphenyHolvent’mdatieast<br>
-oncxof;Solycnt;’<br>
optionally, a further detersive surfactant constituent;<br>
optionally but desirably at least one optional constituent selected from: chelating agents, coloring agent, light stabilizers, fragrances, dickering agents, hydrotropes, pH adjusting agents, pH buffers, as well as others known the art and<br><br>
useful in similar compositions. The one or more optional constituents are selected to be present, and are included in amounts which do not undesirably affect the overall blooming characteristics of the present inventive compositions.<br>
In preferred embodiments the concentrate compositions provide excellent initial blooming characteristics in *as mixed* dilutions with water, but also exhibit good retention of blooming characteristics over a longer time period, viz., days and weeks.<br>
A further aspect of the invention is a concentrated liquid hard surface cleaning composition wherein the composition exhibits a blooming effect when diluted in a larger volume of water.<br>
Desirably, the inventive compositions are essentially free of terpene solvents such as alpha-terpineols or d-Limonene which are characteristic of products such as so-called '*pine oil" cleaning compositions which typically include such terpene solvents.<br>
The inventive compositions include an organic solvent constituent Many useful organic solvents may be used, as long as it does not undesirably disrupt the favorable characteristics of the invention, especially the blooming characteristic. Mixtures of two or more organic solvents may also be used as the organic solvent constituent<br>
Useful organic solvents are those which are at least partially water-miscible organic solvents such as alcohols, water-miscible ethers (e.g. diethylene glycol diethylether, diethylene glycol dimethylcther, propylene glycol dimethyleflier), water-miscible glycols .ethers(e.g;propylOT’<br>
ethylether, propylene glycol monopropylether, propylene glycol monobutyl’w, ethylene glycol monobutylether, dipropylene glycol monomethylether, diethyleneglycol monobutylether), lower esters of monoalkylethers of ethylamine glycols "orpropjtote-glycols   propylene'gl3’ohmonometfi3id"etheracetate)"alt commax:iaUv"available from Union Cathead. Dow CSiiemic’s’’OT<br>
orgasmic  Duvets canals be use’’’<br>
Particularly serial organic solvents include glycols such as alkylene glycols such as propylene glycol, and glycol ethers. Examples of such glycol ethers include those having the general structure Rt-O-Rt-OH, wherein Ra is an alkyl of 1 to 20<br><br>
carbon atoms, or an aryl of at least 6 carbon atoms, and Br is an alkylene of 1 to 8 carbons or is an ether or polyether containing from 2 to 20 carbon atoms. Examples of such useful glycol ethers include propylene glycol methyl ether, dipropylene glycol methyl ether, tripropylene glycol methyl ether, propylene glycol isobutyl ether, ethylene glycol methyl ether, ethylene glycol ethyl ether, ethylene glycol butyl ether, diethylene glycol phenyl ether, propylene glycol phenol eflier, and mixtures thereof. Preferred are ethylene glycol n-butyl ether, diethylene glycol n-butyl ether, and mixtures thereof. Such glycol ethers are presently commercially available from a number of sources including in the DOWANOL*™ glycol ether from The Dow Chemical Company, Midland MI (USA),<br>
Further particularly useful organic solvents monohydric (straight chained or branched) primary, secondary or tertiary lower aliphatic alcohols, especially Ci-Ce aliphatic primary and secondary alcohols, of which isopropanol is particularly preferred.<br>
The present inventors have found that inclusion of the organic solvent constituent in amounts of about 0.001% by weight to about 50% by weight have been found to be effective in providing effective cleaning, particularly when the compositions arc dispersed into a larger volume of water, as well as in solubilizing other less water soluble constituents present in the concentrate compositions of the invention. Preferably, the organic solvent constituent is present m amounts of from 0.1 - 40% by weight, and most preferably from about 0.1 - 35% by weight.<br>
Additionally the inventor has found the according to certain preferred OTib1’GSrSitfW6Wp2i’SiVcfit?’<br>
preferred embodiments consist essentially of, both an alkylene glycol such as propylene glycol, and a monohydric lower aliphatic alcohol such as a Ci-Ce aliphatic primary and secondary alcohol, especially isopropyl alcohol.<br>
"The inventive conTposltiOTOlso’includiTa’ provides a primary sanitizing benefit preferably a quip compound;<br>
The compositions of the invention include a disinfecting effective amount of a quaternary ammonium compound having germicidal properties. Particularly useful quaternary ammonium compounds and salts thereof include quaternary<br><br>
ammonium germicides which may be characterized by the general structural formula:<br><br>
where at least one of Rj, Rj, R3 and R4 is a hydrophobic, aliphatic, aryl aliphatic or aliphatic acyl radical of from 6 to 26 carbon atoms, and the entire cation portion of the molecule has a molecular weight of at least 165. The hydrophobic radicals may be long-chain alkyl, long-champ droxy aryl, long-chain alkyl aryl, hologram-substituted long-chain alkyl aryl, long-chain alkyl phenoxy alkyl, aryl alkyl, etc. The remaining radicals on the nitrogen atoms other than the hydrophobic radicals are substituents of a hydrocarbon structure usually containing a total of no more than 12 carbon atoms. The radicals Ri, R2, R3 and R4 may be straight chained or may be branched, but are preferably straight chained, and may include one or more amide or ester linkages.   The radical X may be any salt-forming anionic radical.<br>
Exemplary quaternary ammonium salts within the above description mcludes the alkyl ammonium halides such as cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide, alkyl aryl ammonium halides such as octadecyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium bromide, N-alkyl pyridinium halides such as N-cetyl pyridinium bromide, and the like. Other suitable types of quaternary ammonium salts include those in which the molecule contains either amide or ester linkages such as octyl phenoxy ethoxy ethyl dimethyl benzyl<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
dilutions are carried out in a neutralizing broth. The diluted samples are then incubated for 24’8 hours at 35-37 . Thereafter, surviving organisms are quantified and log reduction, as a measurement of organism survivors are calculated as follows:<br>
Log Reduction = (Log Survivors/demonized H20)-(Log Survivors/Sample)<br>
Ex. 2 had a log reduction of 6.7.<br>
As may be seen from the results indicated above, the compositions according to the invention provide excellent cleaning benefits to hard surfaces, including hank surfaces with difficult to remove stains notwithstanding the low solids content of the inventive compositions. These advantages are further supplemented by the excellent antimicrobial efficacy of these compositions against known bacteria commonly found in mailroom. kitchen and other such advantages clearly illustrate the superior characteristics of the compositions, the cleaning and antimicrobial benefits attending its use which is not before known to the art<br><br><br><br><br>
