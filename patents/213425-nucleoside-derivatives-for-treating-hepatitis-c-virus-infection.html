State of the Art<br>
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes a liver damaging infection that can lead to cirrhosis, liver failure or liver cancer, and eventually death. HCV is an enveloped virus containing a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome of approximately 9.4 kb, and has a virion size of 30-60 nm.1<br>
HCV is a major causative agent for post-transfusion and for sporadic non-A, non-B hepatitis. Infection by HCV is insidious in a high proportion of chronically infected (and infectious) carriers who may not experience clinical symptoms for many years.<br>
HCV is difficult to treat and it is estimated that there are 500 million people infected with it worldwide. No effective immunization is currently available, and hepatitis C can only be controlled by other preventive measures such as improvement in hygiene and sanitary conditions and interrupting the route of transmission.<br>
At present, the only acceptable treatment for chronic hepatitis C is interferon (EFN-alpha) and this requires at least six (6) months of treatment and/or ribavarin, which can inhibit viral replication in infected cells and also improve liver function in some people.<br>
IFN-alpha belongs to a family of naturally occurring small proteuos with characteristic biological effects such as antiviral, immunoregulatory and antitumoral activities that are produced and secreted by most animal nucleated cells in response to several diseases, in particular, viral infections. IFN-alpha is an important regulator of growth and differentiation affecting cellular communication and immunological control. Treatment of HCV with interferon, however, has limited long term efficacy with a response rate about       25%. In addition, treatment of HCV with interferon has frequently been associated with adverse side effects such as fatigue, fever, chills, headache,<br>
2<br><br>
myalgias, arthralgias, mild alopecia, psychiatric effects and associated disorders, autoimmune phenomena and associated disorders and thyroid dysfunction.<br>
Ribavirin (1-?-D-ribofuranosyl-l H-1,2,-triazole-3-carboxarnide), an inhibitor of inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), enhances the efficacy of IFN-alpha in the treatment of HCV.   Despite the introduction of ribavirin, more than 50% of the patients do not eliminate the virus with the current standard therapy of interferon-alpha (IFN) and ribavirin. By now, standard therapy of chronic hepatitis C has been changed to the combination of PEG-IFN plus ribavirin. However, a number of patients still have significant side effects, primarily related to ribavirin. Ribavirin causes significant hemolysis in 10-20% of patients treated at currently recommended doses, and the drug is both teratogenic and embryotoxic.<br>
Other approaches are being taken to combat the virus. They include, for example, application of antisense oligonucleotides or ribozymes for inhibiting HCV replication. Furthermore, low-molecular weight compounds that directly inhibit HCV proteins and interfere with viral replication are considered as attractive strategies to control HCV infection. NS3/4A serine protease, ribonucleic acid (RNA) helicase, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase are considered as potential targets for new drugs.2,3<br>
Devos, et al.4 describes purine and pyrimidine nucleoside derivatives and their use as inhibitors of HCV RNA replication. Sommadossi, et al5 describes 1',2' or 3'-modified nucleosides and their use for treating a host infected with HCV.<br>
Given the fact of the worldwide epidemic level of HCV, there is a strong need for new effective drugs for HCV treatment.   The present invention provides nucleoside derivatives for treating HCV infections.<br>

The synthesis of the compounds of this invention generally follows either a convergent or linear synthetic pathway as described below.<br>
The strategies available for synthesis of compounds of this invention include for example:<br>

42<br><br>
where R1, R13, R14, W, W2, W3, A, B, D, E and F are as defined above, can be prepared by one of the following general methods.<br>
Convergent approach: Glycosylation ofNucleobase with Appropriately Modified Sugar<br>
The key starting material of this process is an appropriately substituted sugar with 2'-OH and 2'-H with the appropriate leaving group, for example, an acyl group or a chloro, bromo, fluoro or iodo group. The sugar can be purchased or can be prepared by any known means including standard epimerization, substitution, oxidation and/or reduction techniques. For example, commercially available 1,3,5-tri-0-benzoyl-a-D-ribofuranose (Pfanstiel Laboratories, Inc.) can be used. The substituted sugar can then be oxidized with the appropriate oxidizing agent in a compatible solvent at a suitable temperature to yield the 2'-modified sugar. Possible   . oxidizing agents are, for example, Dess-Martin periodine reagent, AC2O+ DCC in DMSO, Swern oxidation (DMSO, oxalyl chloride, triethylamine), Jones reagent (a mixture of chromic acid and sulfuric acid), Collins's reagent (dipyridine Cr(VI) oxide, Corey's reagent (pyridinium chlorochromate), pyridinium dichromate, acid dichromate, potassium permanganate, MnO2, ruthenium tetraoxide, phase transfer catalysts such as chromic acid or permanganate supported on a polymer, Cl2-pyridine, H2O2-ammonium molybdate, NaBrO2-CAN, NaOCl in HOAc, copper chromite, copper oxide, Raney nickel, palladium acetate, Meerwin-Pondorf-Verley reagent (aluminum 2-butoxide with another ketone) and N-bromosuccinimide.<br>
Coupling of an organometallic carbon nucleophile, such as a Grignard reagent, an organolithium, lithium dialkylcopper or R^SiMes in TBAF with the ketone with the appropriate non-protic solvent at a suitable temperature, yields the 2'-alkylated sugar. For example, R1gBr/TiCl4 or R1gBr/CeCl3 can be used as described in Wolfe et al. 1997. J. Org. Chem. 62: 1754-1759 (where R1 is as defined herein). The alkylated sugar can be optionally protected with a suitable protecting group, preferably with an acyl, substituted alkyl or silyl group, by methods well known to those skilled in the art, as taught by Greene et al Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley and Sons, Second Edition, 1991.<br>
43<br><br>
The optionally protected sugar can then be coupled to the purine base by methods well known to those skilled in the art, as taught by Townsend Chemistry of Nucleosides and Nucleotides, Plenum Press, 1994. Fox example, an acylated sugar can be coupled to a silylated base with a Lewis acid, such as tin tetrachloride, titanium tetrachloride or trimethylsilyltritlate in the appropriate solvent at a suitable temperature. Alternatively, a halo-sugar can be coupled to a silylated base with the presence of trimethylsilyltriflate.<br>
In addition to the above, the 2'- and 3'-C-substituted sugars used in the synthetic methods described herein are well known in the art and are described, for example, by Sommadossi, et al.5 and by Carrol, et al.6 both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>
Scheme 1 below describes the alternative synthesis of a protected sugar that is useful for coupling to the bases described herein.<br>
Scheme 1: Alternative Sugar Synthesis and Coupling<br><br>
Formation of sugar a in Scheme 1, above, is accomplished as described by Mandal, S.B., et al, Synth. Commun., 1993,9, page 1239, starting from commercial D-ribose. Protection of the hydroxyl groups to form sugar b is described in Witty, D.R., et al, Tet. Lett, 1990,31, page 4787. Sugar c and d are prepared using the method of Ning, J. et al., Carbohydr. Res., 2001,330, page 165, and methods described herein. R, in sugar e can be hydrogen, alkyl, substituted alkyl, alkenyl,<br>
44<br><br>
substituted alkenyl, alkynyl, and substituted alkynyl. Particularly preferred R groups are methyl, trifluoromethyl, alkenyl and alkynyl. Sugar e is prepared by using a modification of the Grignard reaction withn RMgBr or other appropriate organometallic as described herein (with no titanium/cerium needed). Finally the halogenated sugar used in the subsequent coupling reaction is prepared using the same protection method as used in to make sugar b above.  The halogenation is described in Seela.7<br>
Subsequently, any of the described nucleosides can be deprotected by methods well known to those skilled in the art, as taught by Greene et al Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Jon Wiley and Sons, Second Edition, 1991.<br>
Yet another alternative approach to making protected sugars useful for coupling to heterocyclic bases is detailed in Scheme 2 below. The details for this synthesis can be found in Example 32.<br>
45<br><br><br>
46<br><br>
Linear Approach: Modification of a pre-formed nucleoside.<br>
The key starting material for this process is an appropriately substituted nucleoside witib. a 2'-OH and 2'-H.  The nucleoside can be purchased or can be prepared by any known means including standard coupling techniques.. The nucleoside can be optionally protected with suitable protecting groups, preferably with acyl, substituted alkyl or silyl groups, by methods well known to those skilled in the art, as taught by Greene et at Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley and Sons, Second Edition, 1991.<br>
The appropriately protected nucleoside can then be oxidized with the appropriate oxidizing agent in a compatible solvent at a suitable temperature to yield the 2'-modified sugar. Possible oxidizing agents are, for example, Dess-Martin periodine reagent, Ac2CH- DCC in DMSO, Swern oxidation (DMSO, oxalyl chloride, triethylamine), Jones reagent (a mixture of chromic acid and sulruric acid), Collins's reagent (dipyridine Cr(VI) oxide, Corey's reagent (pyridinium chlorochromate), pyridinium dichromate, acid dichromate, potassium permanganate, MnO2 ruthenium tetroxide, phase transfer catalysts such as chromic acid or permanganate supported on a polymer, Cl2-pyridine, H2O2-ammonium molybdate, NaBrO2-CAN, NaOC1 in HOAc, copper chromite, copper oxide, Raney nickel, palladium acetate, Meerwin-Pondorf-Verley reagent (aluminum f-butoxide with another ketone) and N-bromosuccinimide. Coupling of an organometallic carbon nucleophile, such as a Grignard reagent, an organolithium, h'thium dialkylcopper or R1-SiMe3 in TBAF with the ketone with the appropriate non-protic solvent at a suitable temperature, yields the appropriate substituted nucleoside.<br>
Subsequently, the nucleoside can be deprotected by methods well known to those skilled in the art, as taught by Greene et al Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley and Sons, Second Edition, 1991.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the L-enantiomers are preferred. However, D-enantiomers are also useful herein. The L-enantiomers can be corresponding to the compounds of the invention can be prepared following the same foregoing general methods, beginning with the corresponding L-sugar or nucleoside L-enantiomer as starting material. In a particular embodiment, the 2'-C-branched<br>
47<br><br>
ribonucleoside is desired. In another embodiment, the 3'-C-branched ribonucleoside is desired.<br>
General Synthesis of Heterocvclic Bases Bases of formula V:<br><br>
where A, B, D, E, and F are as described above, Z is halo and M is hydrogen or an alkali metal such as lithium are well known in the art and/or can be obtained commercially. See, for example, Carroll, et al., International Patent Application Publication No. WO 02/057425 which application is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. In addition, the preparation of heterocyclic bases is reviewed by G. Shaw in "Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry" Pergamon Press, Vol. 5, chapter 4.09, p. 449 and "Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry IT* Pergamon Press, Vol. 7, chapter 7.11, p. 397.<br>
For example, the appropriate heterocyclic base of Formula V may be prepared from the heterocyclic base wherein the 2 or 8 position of the heterocyclic base is substituted with a suitable leaving group such as halogen or sulphonate. Such heterocyclic base precursors bearing leaving groups are available commercially, e.g. 6-chloropurine (Aldrich Chemical Company), 2,6-dichloropurine (Aldrich Chemical Company), 2-chloro-6-ammopurine (Aldrich Chemical Company), 8-bromoadenine (Sigma-Aldrich Company Limited) or obtained by procedures known in the art. For example 2- and 6-chloro substituted purines can be prepared by- chlorination of the corresponding 2 and 6-hydroxypurines respectively by the use of chlorinating agents such as phosphorus oxychloride (Bakuni et al. Indian J. Chem., Sect B 1984,23, 1286; LaMontagne et al. J. Heterocycl Chem. 1983,20,295) while introduction of a bromine into the 8-position of purines can be accomplished by direct bromination using brominating agents such as, for example, bromine (Mano et al, Chem Pharm<br>
48<br><br>
Bull 1983, 31,3454) or N-bromosuccinimide (Kelley et al. Heterocycl Chein. 1990, 27,1505). The purines where the 6-substituent is hydroxylamino, alkoxylamino may be prepared by treatment of the corresponding 6-halopurine with the appropriate hydroxylamines and alkoxylamines, (for example, Chae et al. JMed Chein, 1994,37, 342; Niebch and Schneider, Z. Naturforsch. BAnorg. Chern. Org. Chem. Biochem. Biophys. Biol. 1972,27, 675; LaMontagne et al., Heterocycl Chem 1983,20,295; Estep et al JMed Chern 1995, 38,2582). Similarly, 2-substituted purines can be prepared from the corresponding 2-halopurine, for example, purines where the 2-substituent is alkoxy, aryloxy, SH, alkythio, arylthio orNR3R4can be prepared from the corresponding 2-halopurine by treatment with alkoxides, thiols or amines (e.g. BarlkandFenn,Aust J Chem, 1983,36,633; Nugieletal et al., 1997, 62, 201). Similarly, 8-substituted purines can be prepared from the corresponding 8-halopurines. For example purines where the 8-substituent is altoxy, aryloxy, SH, alkythio, arylthio or NR3R4 can be prepared by treatment of the corresponding 8-bromopurine with the appropriate alkoxides, thiols or amines (Xing et al, Tetrahedron Lett, 1990, 31, 5849; Mano et al, Chem Pharm Bull 1983, 31, 3454).<br>
In some cases where the 6-substituent is a nitrogen containing heteroaryl or heterocyclic group linked through the nitrogen atom attached to the purine ring which may be prepared from the 6-aminopurine by reaction with a dicarbonyl compound or a reactive derivative of this such as an acetal. For example, 6-(lH-pyrrol-l-yl)-lH-purine can be prepared from a 6-aminopurine by reaction with 2,5-dirnethoxytetrahydrofuran as described by Estep et al JMed Chem 1995,38,2582.<br>

Harry-O'kuru, J. Smith, and M. WotfJ. Org. Chem. 1997, 62,1754-1759. Methylthio-purine is oxidized to methylsulfonyl-purine, 51, using the procedure described by Y-Z.

58<br><br>
Administration and Pharmaceutical Composition<br>
In general, the compounds of this invention will be administered in a therapeutically effective amount by any of the accepted modes of administration for agents that serve similar utilities. The actual amount of the compound of this invention, i.e., the active ingredient, will depend upon numerous factors such as the severity of the disease to be treated, the age and relative health of the subject, the potency of the compound used, the route and form of administration, and other factors. The drug can be administered more than once a day, preferably once or twice a day.<br>
Therapeutically effective amounts of compounds of this invention may range from approximately 0.05 to 50 mg per kilogram body weight of the recipient per day; preferably about 0.01-25 mg/kg/day, more preferably from about 0.5 to 10 mg/kg/day. Thus, for administration to a 70 kg person, the dosage range would most preferably be about 35-70 mg per day.<br>
In general, compounds of this invention will be administered as pharmaceutical compositions by any one of the following routes: oral, systemic (e.g., transdermal, intranasal or by suppository), or parenteral (e.g., intramuscular, intravenous or subcutaneous) administration. The preferred manner of administration is oral using a convenient daily dosage regimen that can be adjusted according to the degree of affliction. Compositions can take the form of tablets, pills, capsules, semisolids, powders, sustained release formulations, solutions, suspensions, elixirs, aerosols, or any other appropriate compositions. Another preferred manner for administering compounds of this invention is inhalation. This is an effective method for delivering a therapeutic agent directly to the respiratory tract, in particular for the treatment of diseases such as asthma and similar or related respiratory tract disorders (see U. S. Patent 5,607,915).<br>
The choice of formulation depends on various factors such as the mode of drug administration and bioavailability of the drug substance. For delivery via inhalation the compound can be formulated as liquid solution, suspensions, aerosol propellants or dry powder and loaded into a suitable dispenser for administration. There are several types of pharmaceutical inhalation devices-nebulizer inhalers,<br>
59<br><br>
metered dose inhalers (MDI) and dry powder inhalers (DPI). Nebulizer devices produce a stream of high velocity air that causes the therapeutic agents (which are formulated in a liquid form) to spray as a mist that is carried into the patient's respiratory tract. MDI's typically are formulation packaged with a compressed gas. Upon actuation, the device discharges a measured amount of therapeutic agent by compressed gas, thus affording a reliable method of administering a set amount of agent. DPI dispenses therapeutic agents in the form of a free flowing powder that can be dispersed in the patient*s inspiratory air-stream during breathing by the device. In order to achieve a free flowing powder, the therapeutic agent is formulated with an excipient such as lactose. A measured amount of the therapeutic agent is stored in a capsule form and is dispensed with each actuation.<br>
Recently, pharmaceutical formulations have been developed especially for drugs that show poor bioavailability based upon the principle that bioavailability can be increased by increasing the surface area i.e., decreasing particle size. For example, U.S. Pat. No, 4,107,288 describes a pharmaceutical formulation having particles in the size range from 10 to 1,000 nm in which the active material is supported on a crosslinked matrix of macromolecules. U.S. Patent No. 5,145,684 describes the production of a pharmaceutical formulation in which the drug substance is pulverized to nanoparticles (average particle size of 400 nm) in the presence of a surface modifier and then dispersed in a liquid medium to give a pharmaceutical formulation that exhibits remarkably high bioavailability.<br>
The compositions are comprised of in general, a compound of this invention or a mixture thereof in combination with at least one pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. Acceptable excipients are non-toxic, aid administration, and do not adversely affect the therapeutic benefit of the compound of this invention. Such excipient may be any solid, liquid, semi-solid or, in the case of an aerosol composition, gaseous excipient that is generally available to one of skill in the art.<br>
Solid pharmaceutical excipients include starch, cellulose, talc, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, magnesium stearate, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, sodium chloride, dried skim milk and the like. Liquid and semisolid excipients may be selected from glycerol, propylene<br>
60<br><br>
glycol, water, ethanol and various oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, e.g., peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil, etc. Preferred liquid carriers, particularly for injectable solutions, include water, saline, aqueous dextrose, and glycols.<br>
Compressed gases may be used to disperse a compound of this invention in aerosol form. Inert gases suitable for this purpose are nitrogen, carbon dioxide, etc. Other suitable pharmaceutical excipients and their formulations are described in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, edited by E. W. Martin (Mack Publishing Company, 18th ed., 1990).<br>
The amount of the compound in a formulation can vary within the full range employed by those skilled in the art. Typically, the formulation will contain, on a weight percent (wt%) basis, from about 0.01-99.99 wt% of a compound of this invention based on the total formulation, with the balance being one or more suitable pharmaceutical excipients. Preferably, the compound is present at a level of about 1-S0 wt%. Representative pharmaceutical formulations containing a compound of this invention are described below.<br>
