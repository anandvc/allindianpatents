				<td>Novel use of combined 5-HT1A agonists and selective serotonin<br>
reuptake inhibitors<br>
The present invention relates to the use of compounds being combined<br>
selective serotonin (5-KT) reuptake inhibitors (SSRis) and 5-HT1A receptor<br>
agonists for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of chronic<br>
pain.<br>
Particularly, the present invention relates to the use of combined selective<br>
serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (SSRis) and 5-HT1A receptor agonists<br>
chosen from the group consisting of 1-[4-(5-cyanoindol-3-yl)butyl]-4-(2-<br>
carbamoyl-benzofuran-5-yl)-piperazine or a physiologically acceptable salt<br>
thereof or 3-{4-[4-(4-cyano-phenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-butyl}-1 H-indole-5-<br>
carbonitrile or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof, for the manufacture<br>
of a medicament for the treatment of chronic pain.<br>
1-[4-(5-Cyanoindol-3-yl)butyl]-4-(2-carbamoyl-benzofuran-5-yl)-piperazine,<br>
physiologically acceptable salts thereof (US 5,532,241, column 7, lines 30<br>
to 58) and a process (US 5,532,241, Example 4) by which it/they can be<br>
prepared are known from U.S. Patent US 5,532,241. The compound which<br>
is referred to herein is described in the patent as a combined selective<br>
serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and 5-HT1A receptor agonist.<br>
Therefore, the use of 1-{4-(5-cyanoindol-3-yl)butyl]-4-(2-carbamoyl-<br>
benzofuran-5-yl)-piperazine and its physiologically acceptable acid addition<br>
salts for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of depressive<br>
disorders, including the sub-type disorders major depressive disorder and<br>
dysthymic disorder, for the treatment of anxiety disorders, for the treatment<br>
of psychiatric disorders like psychoses, schizophrenia or schizoaffective<br>
disorder, for the treatment of cerebral infarct like stroke and cerebral<br>
ischemia, for the treatment of CNS disorders such as tension, for the<br>
therapy of side-effects in the treatment of hypertension (e.g. with a-<br>
methyldopa) and for the prophylaxis and therapy of cerebral disorders is<br>
disclosed. Additionally, the use in endocrinology and gynecology is<br>
described, e.g. for the treatment of acromegaly, hypogonadism, secondary<br>
amenorrhea, premenstrual syndrome or undesired puerperal lactation.<br>
3-{4-[4-(4-Cyano-phenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-butyl}-1H-indole-5-carbonitrile,<br>
physiologically acceptable salts thereof (EP 0 736 525, page 3, lines 5, 26<br>
and, page 8 lines 28 to page 9 lines 12) and a process (EP 0 736 525,<br>
Example 1) by which it/they can be prepared are known from EP 0 736<br>
525. They show, in particular, actions on the central nervous system,<br>
especially 5-HT1A-agonistic and 5-HT-reuptake inhibiting actions. Therefore<br>
they are suitable for the treatment of disorders of the central nervous<br>
system such as states of tension, depressions and/or psychoses and of<br>
side effects in the treatment of hypertension. Additionally, the use in<br>
endocrinology and gynecology is described, e.g. for the treatment of<br>
acromegaly, hypogonadism, secondary amenorrhea, premenstrual<br>
syndrome or undesired puerperal lactation, and furthermore for the<br>
prophylaxis and therapy of cerebral disorders, in particular in geriatrics,<br>
similarly to certein ergot alkaloids and for the control of the sequelae of<br>
cerebral infarcts (apoplexia cerebri), such as stroke and cerebral<br>
ischaemias.<br>
The invention had the object of providing novel uses for compounds being<br>
combined selective serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and 5-<br>
HTia receptor agonists, in particular of 1-[4-(5-cyanoindol-3-yl)butyl]-4-(2-<br>
carbamoyI-benzofuran-5-yl)-piperazine and its physiologically acceptable<br>
salts or 3-{4-[4-(4-cyano-phenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-butyl}-1 H-indole-5-<br>
carbonittile or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
It has been found that combined selective serotonin (5-HT) reuptake<br>
inhibitors (SSRIs) and 5-HT1A receptor agonists, in particular 1-[4-(5-<br>
cyanoindol-3-yl)butyl]-4-(2-carbamoyl-benzofuran-5-yl)-piperazine or a<br>
physiologically acceptable salt thereof or 3-{4-[4-(4-cyano-phenyl)-<br>
piperazin-1-yl]-butyl}-1H-indole-5-carbonitrile or a physiologically<br>
acceptable salt thereof, also have activity against pain, especially against<br>
chronic pain. <br>
Piperazines, such as 1-[4-(5-cyanoindol-3-yl)butyl]-4-(2-carbamoyl-<br>
benzofuran-5-yl)-piperazine and its physiologically acceptable acid addition<br>
salts, are disclosed in U.S. Patent US 5,532,241 having analgesic effects.<br>
However, the usefulness of such piperazines for the treatment of pain,<br>
especially for chronic pain has not been disclosed.<br>
The disclosed analgesic effects do not inevitably lead to effective<br>
treatments for chronic pain. Acute pain is a normal sensation triggered in<br>
the nervous system to alert an individual to possible injury. Chronic pain<br>
results from persistent pain signals in the nervous system which continue<br>
after the initial damage or injury has disappeared. Chronic pain can occur<br>
in the absence of any past injury or evidence of body damage, so-called<br>
psychogenic pain.<br>
As used herein the term pain shall refer to ail types of pain. Preferably, the<br>
term shall refer to all types of chronic pain including nociceptive,<br>
neuropathic, psychogenic pain, and mixed category pain (nociceptive and<br>
neuropathic components). This in particular includes, but is not limited to,<br>
diabetic neuropathy, neurogenic pain, central pain, somatic pain, visceral<br>
and cancer pain, inflammatory pain, post-operative pain, chronic low back<br>
pain, sciatica, cervical and lumbar pain, tension headaches, cluster<br>
headaches, chronic daily headaches, herpes neuralgia and post-herpetic<br>
neuralgia, facial and oral neuralgias and myofascial pain syndromes,<br>
phantom limb pain, stump pain and paraplegic pain, dental pain, opioid<br>
resistant pain, post-surgical pain including cardic surgery and mastectomy,<br>
pain of labour and delivery, post-partum pain, post-stroke pain, angina<br>
pain, genitourinary tract pain including pelvic pain and cystitis and vulvar<br>
vestibulitis and orchialgia, irritable bowel syndrome, pre-menstrual<br>
syndrome pain, pain resulting from burns or chemical injury or sunburn,<br>
and bone injury pain.<br>
Sub-types of nociceptive pain are somatic pain and visceral pain.<br>
Somatic pain includes inflammatory pain, post-operative pain, chronic low<br>
back pain, cervical and lumber pain, cluster headaches, dental pain, pain of<br>
labour and delivery, post-partum pain, pain resulting from bums or<br>
chemical injury or sunburn, and bone injury pain. Visceral pain includes<br>
cancer pain, post-surgical pain including cardic surgery, angina pain,<br>
genito-urinary tract pain including pelvic pain and cystitis and vulvar<br>
vestibulitis and orchialgia and pre-menstruai pain syndrome. Sub-types of<br>
neuropathic pain are diabetic neuropathy, cancer pain, neurogenic pain,<br>
central pain, sciatica, herpes neuralgia, post-herpetic neuralgia, facial and<br>
oral neuralgias, phantom limb pain, stump pain and paraplegic pain, opioid-<br>
resistant pain, post-surgical pain including mastectomy and post-stroke<br>
pain. Sub-types of psychogenic pain are chronic daily headaches and<br>
tension headaches. Sub-types of mixed category pain are cancer pain,<br>
myofascial syndromes and tension headaches (e.g. McCaffery M, Pasero<br>

Force on Taxonomy, p 209-214, IASP Press, Seattle 1994 ; The Merck<br>
Manual, Section 14, Chapter 167, Pain, 17th Edition Merck &amp; Co 1999).<br>
The effectiveness of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in<br>
various pain indications has been demonstrated in animals as well as<br>
humans.<br>
For example, SSRIs have been shown to enhance the effects of traditional<br>
opioid analgesics and to be effective themselves against acute pain,<br>
inflammatory pain, and neuropathic pain in various animal models (e.g.<br>

1999, 82: 149-158; McCleane, Pain 2000, 85: 311-312).<br>
SSRIs are also effective in experimental pain in healthy volunteers (Coquoz<br>
et al., Schweiz. Med. Wochenschr. 1991, 121:1843-1845; Coquoz et al.,<br>
Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 1993,54:339-344) and, more relevant, in patients<br>
suffering of various chronic pain conditions like headache (tension<br>
headache), diabetic neuropathy, idiopathic pain, low back pain, phantom<br>
limb pain, rheumatic pain, irritable bowel syndrome, premenstrual<br>
syndrome pain or generalized or mixed pain syndrome (e.g. radicular pain,<br>
atypical facial pain) (e.g. Theesen and Marsh, DICP 1989,23:572-574;<br>

Harv. Rev. Psychiatry 2000,7: 257-277).<br>
Moreover, SSRIs are the most frequent drugs used in depressive<br>
disorders, and there is a high comorbidity for depression and pain, and they<br>
may even share a common etiology (e.g.(Ekselius et al., Scand. J. Rehabil.<br>
Med. 1997, 29: 91-96; Max et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 1992, 326: 1250-1256;<br>
Gruber et al., Psychiatr. Clin. North Am. 1996,19: 351-369).<br>
Finally, selective serotonin 5-HTiA receptor agonists reduce pain in animals<br>
in acute and chronic pain and inflammatory pain models (e.g. Fasmer et<br>
al., Pharmacol. Biochem Behav. 1986,25:883-888; Bragin et al., Pain<br>
1989, 36: 257-261; Giordano and Rogers, Pain 1989, 39:109-113; Murphy<br>

269:1182-1189; Sanchez et al., Neuroreport 1995, 6: 2585-2588; Millan et<br>
al., Behav. Brain Res. 1996, 73: 69-77; Robles et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol.<br>
1996, 295:181-188; Galeotti et al., Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 1997, 57:<br>
835-841; Rouzade et al., Digest. Dis. Sci. 1998, 43: 2048-2054; Jain and<br>
Kulkami, Meth. Find. Exp. Clin. Pharmacol. 1999, 21:161-165; Shannon<br>
and Lutz, Psychopharmacology 2000,149:93-97). To our knowledge,<br>
clinical results in pain patients are not available due to the lack of selective<br>
5-HTia agonists on the market.<br>
Therefore, the combination of serotonin reuptake inhibiting properties and<br>
serotonin 5-HTiA agonistic properties as realized in 1-[4-(5-cyanoindol-3-<br>
yl)butyl]-4-(2-carbamoyl-benzofuran-5-yl)-piperazine and its salts thereof or<br>
3^4-[4-(4-cyano-phenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-butyl}-1 H-indole-5-carbonitrile and<br>
its salts thereof represents an advantage over SSRIs alone for the<br>
treatment of chronic pain disorders or in treating other conditions where<br>
there is hyper-sensitization to painful signals, hyperalgesia, allodynia,<br>
enhanced pain perception, and enhanced memory of pain.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to the use of compounds being<br>
combined selective serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and 5-<br>
HT1A receptor agonists for the manufacture of a medicament for the<br>
treatment of chronic pain.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to the use of 1-[4-(5-cyanoindol-<br>
3-yl)butyl]-4-(2-carbamoyl-benzofuran-5-yl)-piperazine or a physiologically<br>
acceptable salt thereof, for the manufacture of a medicament for the<br>
treatment of chronic pain.<br>
The present invention relates furthermore to the use of 3-{4-[4-(4-cyano-<br>
phenyl)-piperazin-1-yll-butyl}-1H-indole-5-carbonitrile or a physiologically<br>
acceptable salt thereof, for the manufacture of a medicament for the<br>
treatment of chronic pain.<br>
A preferred salt of 1-[4-(5-cyanoindol-3-yl)butyl]-4-(2-carbamoyl-<br>
benzofuran-5-yl)-piperazine is 1 -[4-(5-cyanoindol-3-yl)butyl]-4-(2-<br>
carbamoyl-benzofuran-5-yl)-piperazinehydrochloride.<br>
Therefore the invention relates to the use for the manufacture of a<br>
medicament for the treatment of chronic pain in which the<br>
pharmacologically acceptable salt of 1-[4-(5-cyanoindol-3-yl)butyl]-4-(2-<br>
carbamoyl-benzofuran-5-yl)-piperazine is 1 -[4-(5-cyanoindol-3-yl)butyl]-4-<br>
(2-carbamoyl-benzofuran-5-yl)-piperazine hydrochloride.<br>
A preferred salt of 3-{4-[4-(4-cyano-phenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-butyl}-1 H-indole-<br>
5-carbonitrile is 3-{4-[4-(4-cyano-phenyl)-piperazin-1 -yl]-butyl}-1 H-indole-5-<br>
carbonitrile hydrochloride.<br>
Therefore the invention relates to the use for the manufacture of a<br>
medicament for the treatment of chronic pain in which the<br>
pharmacologically acceptable salt of 3-{4-[4-(4-cyano-phenyl)-piperazin-1-<br>
yl]-butyl}-1 H-indole-5-carbonitrile is 3-{4-[4-(4-cyano-phenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-<br>
butyl}-1 H-indole-5-carbonitrile hydrochloride.<br>
Additionally, the invention relates to the use of a pharmaceutical<br>
composition containing at least a compound being a combined selective<br>
serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and 5-HT1A receptor agonist, in<br>
particular 1-[4-(5-cyanoindol-3-yl)butyl]-4-(2-carbamoyl-benzofuran-5-yl)-<br>
piperazine or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof or 3-{4-[4-(4-cyano-<br>
phenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-butyl}-1 H-indole-5-carbonitrile or a physiologically<br>
acceptable salt thereof, together with at least one solid, liquid or semiliquid<br>
excipient or adjunct for the treatment of chronic pain.<br>
Thus the invention provides a pharmaceutical preparation for the treatment<br>
of pain characterized in that it contains at least 1-[4-(5-cyanoindol-3-<br>
yl)butyl]-4-(2-carbamoyl-benzofuran-5-yl)-piperazine or one of its<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>
Thus the invention provides a pharmaceutical preparation for the treatment<br>
of pain characterized in that it contains at least 3-{4-[4-(4-cyano-phenyl)-<br>
piperazin-1-yl]-butyl}-1 H-indole-5-carbonitrile or one of its pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts.<br>
The compounds being combined selective serotonin (5-HT) reuptake<br>
inhibitors (SSRIs) and 5-HT1A receptor agonists according to the invention<br>
are preferably administered in analogy to other known commercially<br>
available preparations for the treatment of pain (e.g. duloxetine). A unit<br>
dose will generally contain from 0.1 to 1000 mg, preferably between<br>
approximately 0.1 and 500 mg, in particular 5,10,20,30,40,50,100,150,<br>
200,250 and 300 mg. The composition may be administered once or more<br>
times a day for example 2, 3 or 4 times daily. The daily dose is preferably<br>
between approximately 0.01 and 50 mg/kg of body weight. However, the<br>
specific dose for each patient depends on all sorts of factors, for example<br>
on the activity of the specific compound employed, on the age, body<br>
weight, general state of health, sex, on the diet, on the time and route of<br>
administration, on the excretion rate, pharmaceutical substance<br>
combination and severity of the particular disorder to which the therapy<br>
relates. Oral administration is preferred, but also peroral routes of<br>
administration (e.g. intraveneous or transdermal) can be utilized.<br>
It is preferred that the chronic pain to be treated by combined selective<br>
serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (SSRls) and 5-HT1A receptor agonists,<br>
in particular 1 -[4-(5-cyanoindol-3-yl)butyl]-4-(2-carbamoyl-benzofuran-5-yl)-<br>
piperazine or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof or 3-{4-[4-(4-cyano-<br>
phenyl)-piperazin-1 -ylj-butyl}-1 H-indole-5-carbonitrile or a physiologically<br>
acceptable salt thereof, is nociceptive pain. Preferred indications of<br>
nociceptive pain are inflammatory and post-operative pain.<br>
Therefore, the invention relates to the use of compounds being combined<br>
selective serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (SSRls) and 5-HT1A receptor<br>
agonists, in particular of 1-[4-(5-cyanoindol-3-yl)butyl]-4-(2-carbamoyl-<br>
benzofuran~5-yl)-piperazine or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof or<br>
3-{4-[4-(4-cyano-phenyf)-piperazin-1-yl]-butyl}-1 H-indole-5-carbonitrile or a<br>
physiologically acceptable salt thereof, for the manufacture of a<br>
medicament for the treatment of nociceptive pain.<br>
It is preferred that the chronic pain to be treated by combined selective<br>
serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (SSRls) and 5-HT1A receptor agonists,<br>
in particular 1 -[4-(5-cyanoindol-3-yl)butyl]-4-(2-carbamoyl-benzofuran-5-yl)-<br>
piperazine or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof or 3-{4-[4-(4-cyano-<br>
phenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-butyl}-1H-indole-5-carbonitrile or a physiologically<br>
acceptable salt thereof, is neuropathic pain. Preferred indications of<br>
neuropathic pain are neurogenic pain and facial and oral neuralgias.<br>
Therefore, the invention relates to the use of compounds being combined<br>
selective serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (SSRls) and 5-HT1A receptor<br>
agonists, in particular of 1-[4-(5-cyanoindoi-3-yl)butyl]-4-(2-carbamoyl-<br>
benzofuran-5-yl)-piperazine or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof or<br>
3-{4-[4-(4-cyano-phenyl)-piperazin-1-yl}-butyl}-1 H-indole-5-carbonitrile or a<br>
physiologically acceptable salt thereof, for the manufacture of a<br>
medicament for the treatment of neuropathic pain.<br>
It has additionally been found that combined selective serotonin (5-HT)<br>
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and 5-HT1A receptor agonists, in particular 1-[4-<br>
(5-cyanoindol-3-yl)butyl]-4-(2-carbamoyl-benzofuran-5-yl)-piperazine or a<br>
physiologically acceptable salt thereof or 3-{4-{4-(4-cyano-phenyl)-<br>
piperazin-1-yi]-butyl}-1 H-indole-5-carbonitrile or a physiologically<br>
acceptable salt thereof, are further useful in treating other conditions where<br>
there is hyper-sensitization to painful signals, hyperalgesia, allodynia,<br>
enhanced pain perception, and enhanced memory of pain. A preferred<br>
indication is irritable bowel syndrome.<br>
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder of the intestines that<br>
leads to crampy pain, gassiness, bloating, and changes in bowel habits.<br>
The cause of IBS is not known but it often has been thought to be caused<br>
by emotional conflict or stress. IBS is called a functional disorder because<br>
there is no sign of disease when the colon is examined. People suffering<br>
from IBS usually have crampy abdominal pain with painful constipation or<br>
diarrhea.<br>
Therefore, the invention relates to the use of compounds being combined<br>
selective serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and 5-HT1A receptor<br>
agonists, in particular of 1-l4-(5-cyanoindol-3-yl)butyl]-4-(2-carbarnoyl-<br>
benzofuran-5-yl)-piperazine or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof or<br>
3-{4-[4-(4-cyano-phenyl)-piperazin-1-ylj-butyl}-1 H-indole-5-carbonitrile or a<br>
physiologically acceptable salt thereof, for the manufacture of a<br>
medicament for the treatment of inflammatory bowel syndrome.<br>
A preferred salt of 1 -[4-(5-cyanoindol-3-yl)butyl]-4-(2-carbamoyl-<br>
benzofuran-5-yl)-piperazine is 1-[4-(5-cyanoindol-3-yl)butyl]-4-(2-<br>
carbamoyl-benzofuran-5-yl)-piperazine hydrochloride.<br>
Therefore the invention relates to the use for the manufacture of a<br>
medicament for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome in which the<br>
pharmacologically acceptable salt of 1-[4-(5-cyanoindol-3-yl)butyl]-4-(2-<br>
carbamoyl-benzofuran-5-yl)-piperazine is 1 -[4-(5-cyanoindol-3-yl)butyl]-4-<br>
(2-carbamoyl-benzofuran-5-yl)-piperazinehydrochloride.<br>
A preferred salt of 3-{4-[4-(4-cyano-phenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-butyl}-1 H-indole-<br>
5-carbonitrile is 3-{4-[4-(4-cyano-phenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-butyl}-1 H-indole-5-<br>
carbonitrile hydrochloride.<br>
Therefore the invention relates to the use for the manufacture of a<br>
medicament for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome in which the<br>
pharmacologically acceptable salt of 3-{4-[4-(4-cyano-phenyl)-piperazin-1-<br>
yl]-butyl}-1 H-indole-5-carbonitrile is 3-{4-[4-(4-cyano-phenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-<br>
butyl}-1 H-indole-5-carbonitrile hydrochloride.<br>
Additionally, the invention relates to the use of a pharmaceutical<br>
composition containing at least a compound being a combined selective<br>
serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and 5-HT1A receptor agonist, in<br>
particular 1-[4-(5-cyanoindol-3-yl)butyl]-4-(2-carbamoyl-benzofuran-5-yl)-<br>
piperazine or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof or 3-{4-[4-(4-cyano-<br>
phenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-butyl}-1 H-indole-5-carbonitrile or a physiologically<br>
acceptable salt thereof, together with at least one solid, liquid or semiliquid<br>
excipient or adjunct for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome.<br>
Thus the invention provides a pharmaceutical preparation for the treatment<br>
of irritable bowel syndrome characterized in that it contains at least 1-[4-(5-<br>
cyanoindol-3-yl)butyl]-4-(2-carbamoyl-benzofuran-5-yl)-piperazine or one of<br>
its pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>
Thus the invention provides a pharmaceutical preparation for the treatment<br>
of irritable bowel syndrome characterized in that it contains at least 3-{4-[4-<br>
(4-cyano-phenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-butyl}-1H-indole-5-carbonitri!e or one of its<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>
The compounds being combined selective serotonin (5-HT) reuptake<br>
inhibitors (SSRIs) and 5-HT1A receptor agonists according to the invention<br>
are preferably administered in analogy to other known commercially<br>
available preparations for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). A<br>
unit dose will generally contain from 0.1 to 1000 mg, preferably between<br>
approximately 0.1 and 50 mg, in particular 5,10 and 20 mg. The<br>
composition may be administered once a day. The daily dose is preferably<br>
between approximately 0.01 and 10 mg/kg of body weight.<br>
However, the specific dose for each patient depends on all sorts of factors,<br>
for example on the activity of the specific compound employed, on the age,<br>
body weight, general state of health, sex, on the diet, on the time and route<br>
of administration, on the excretion rate, pharmaceutical substance<br>
combination and severity of the particular disorder to which the therapy<br>
relates. Oral administration is preferred, but also peroral routes of<br>
administration (e.g. intraveneous or transdermal) can be utilized.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations used for the treatment of pain or<br>
preferred for IBS, can be used as Pharmaceuticals in human or veterinary<br>
medicine.<br>
A process for the manufacture of a pharmaceutical preparation used for the<br>
treatment of chronic pain is characterised in that one compound being<br>
combined selective serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and 5-HT1A<br>
receptor agonist chosen from the group consisting of 1 -[4-(5-cyanoindol-3-<br>
yl)butyl]-4-(2-carbamoyl-benzofuran-5-yl)-piperazine or a physiologically<br>
acceptable salt thereof or 3-{4-[4-(4-cyano-phenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-butyl}-<br>
1 H-indole-5-carbonitrile or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof, are<br>
converted into a suitable dosage form together with at least one solid, liquid<br>
or semiliquid excipient or adjunct.<br>
Suitable excipients are organic or inorganic substances which are suitable<br>
for enteral (e.g. oral), parenteral or topical adminstration and which do not<br>
react with 1 -[4-(5-cyanoindol-3-yl)butyl]-4-(2-carbamoyl-benzofuran-5-yl)-<br>
piperazine and/or one of its biocompatible salts, for example water,<br>
vegetable oils, benzyl alcohols, alkylene glycols, polyethylene glycols,<br>
glycerol triacetate, gelatine, carbohydrates such as lactose or starch,<br>
magnesium stearate, talc, petroleum jelly. Forms which are used for oral<br>
administration are, in particular, tablets, pills, sugar-coated tablets,<br>
capsules, powders, granules, syrups, liquids or drops, forms for rectal<br>
administration are, in particular suppositories, forms for parenteral<br>
administration are, in particular, solvents, preferably oily or aqueous<br>
solutions, furthermore suspensions, emulsions or implants, and forms for<br>
topical administration are transdermal plasters, ointments, creams or<br>
powders. 1-[4-(5-cyanoindol-3-yl)butyl]-4-(2-carbamoyl-benzofuran-5-yl)-<br>
piperazine and/or one of its pharmaceutically acceptable salts may also be<br>
lyophilized and the resulting lyophilisates used for example for the<br>
preparation of injectable products. The abovementioned preparations can<br>
be in sterilized form and/or comprise auxiliaries such as glidants,<br>
preservatives, stabilizers and/or wetting agents, emulsifiers, salts for<br>
modifying the osmotic pressure, buffer substances, colourings, flavourings<br>
and/or other active ingredients, e.g. one or more vitamins.<br>
Preparations may, if desired, be designed to give slow release of 1-[4-(5-<br>
cyanoindol-3-yl)butyl]-4-{2-carbamoyl-benzofuran-5-yl)-piperazine or a<br>
biocompatible salt thereof.<br>
The following examples relate to animal models which are useful for<br>
illustrating the effectiveness of combined 5-HT1A agonists and serotonin<br>
reuptake inhibitors.<br>
Example 1: Procedures in the mouse and the rat to test pain-relieving acute<br>
analgetic properties<br>
1. Hot plate test in mouse or rat according to Eddy and Leimbach (J.<br>
Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1953,107:385-393):<br>
Mice or rats are placed onto a hot metal plate maintained at 54°C for mice<br>
or 52°C for rats surrounded by a Plexiglas cylinder (Height: 13 cm;<br>
Diameter: 19 cm). The latency to the first foot-lick is measured (maximum :<br>
30 seconds).<br>
2. Tail flick test in mouse or rat according to by D"Amour and Smith (J.<br>
Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1941,72:74-79):<br>
The animal"s tail is heated by means of a thermal light source. The latency<br>
before the animal withdraws its tail is measured (maximum: 15 seconds for<br>
mice, 30 seconds for rats).<br>
3. Shock sensitivity test in the mouse or rat follows that described by<br>
Eschalier et al. (Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1981,74:1-7):<br>
Each animal is placed on a grid floor connected to an electric shock<br>
generator that transmits a brief electric shock to the animal"s paws. Three<br>
shocks are given at an intensity of 1 mA, each for a duration of 0.5 sec.<br>
The shocks are spaced at 30 second intervals. Response to electric shock<br>
is quantified using a scale incorporating three parameters: jump,<br>
vocalization and flight (each parameter is scored 0, 1 or 2). The total score<br>
obtained for all three parameters for the three shocks is taken as a<br>
measure of sensitivity to electric shock.<br>
4. Shock Titration Test in the rat according to Weiss and Laties (J.<br>
Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1961, 131: 120-129):<br>
The apparatus consists of a sound-attenuated standard Skinner Box (23 x<br>
21 x 18 cm) fitted with a house light, one lever and a grid floor connected to<br>
a programmable scrambled shock generator (Imetronic). The Skinner<br>
boxes are connected to a MED.PC programming system which controls the<br>
experiment and collected the data automatically. The rats are first trained<br>
to press a lever in the experimental chamber in order to stop an electric<br>
foot-shock (0.8 mA) administered at 5 second intervals (escape training).<br>
They are then trained to control the intensity of the electric shock (30<br>
graded steps: 0.03-0.9 mA) by pressing the lever. When the rat presses the<br>
lever in the presence of shock, the shock terminates and returns 5 seconds<br>
later at the next lower intensity. If the rat fails to respond during the shock<br>
presentation, the shock terminates automatically after 5 seconds and<br>
returns 5 seconds later at the next higher intensity (shock titration). Lever<br>
pressing between shocks (inter-trial responses) is without consequence.<br>
Each training sessions lasts 15 minutes and begins at the tenth intensity<br>
level (0.3 mA). The animals receive a administration of the vehicle of the<br>
test compound 60 minutes before each session. Two behavioral measures<br>
are taken: The median shock level (nociceptive threshold) per rat is defined<br>
as the intensity above and below which the animal receives 50% of its<br>
shocks, and the Inter-trial responses defined as the number of lever-<br>
presses occurring between shock presentations. Drug testing is performed<br>
on animals having reached stable baseline performance over two ,<br>
consecutive weeks. Drug testing sessions are given twice weekly with at<br>
least one training session without drugs between drug test sessions.<br>
Animals are tested (training and test sessions) 5 days per week (Monday to<br>
Friday). As above, sessions terminate after 15 minutes. Each animal is<br>
used as its own control and receives all the selected treatments and<br>
controls (vehicle) in separate testing sessions. The sequence of treatments<br>
is determined by a procedure to ensure even distribution of the different<br>
treatments in time. Each animal is always tested in the same Skinner Box,<br>
in the same order and at the same time of the day.<br>
5. Phenylbenzoquinone and acetic writhing tests in mice follow the<br>
methods described by Hendershot et al (J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1959,<br>
125:237-240):<br>
Mice are injected with phenylbenzoquinone (PBQ) (1.25 mg/kg i.p.) or<br>
acetic acid (0.5% i.p.)- This treatment induces a recognizable writhing<br>
response in control animals. The number of writhes is counted for 10<br>
minutes beginning 5 minutes after injection of PBQ or acetic acid.<br>
1-[4-(5-cyanoindol-3-yl)butyl]-4-(2-carbamoyl-benzofuran-5-yl)-piperazine<br>
hydrochloride at 30 mg/kg p.o. reduced writhes by 82%.<br>
Example 2: Procedures in the mouse and the rat to test pain-relieving<br>
properties associated with antiinflammatory processes<br>
1. FormaKn paw test in the mouse or rat accorrding to Wheeler-Aceto et<br>
a/.,(Psychopharmacology 1991,104: 35-44):<br>
Animals are given an intraplantar injection of 5% formalin (25 ml for the<br>
mouse, 50 //I for the rat) into the posterior left paw. This treatment induces<br>
a recognizable flinching response in control animals. The number of<br>
flinches is counted for 10 minutes, beginning immediately after injection of<br>
formalin (early phase) and again for 5 minutes in mice or 15 minutes in<br>
rats, beginning 20 minutes after the injection.<br>
1-[4-(5-cyanoindol-3-yl)butyl]-4-(2-carbamoyl-benzofuran-5-yl)-piperazine<br>
hydrochloride at 30 mg/kg p.o. reduced the formalin-induced pain response<br>
by 79%.<br>
Example 3: Procedures in mouse and rat to test pain-relieving properties<br>
associated with antiinflammatory processes and<br>
antiinflammatory/antipyretic properties<br>
1. Carrageenan Edema Test in the rat follows that described by Winter et<br>
al. (Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1962,111: 544-547):<br>
Animals are injected with a carrageenan solution into the lower surface of<br>
the right hind-paw (0.75 mg per paw in 0.05 ml physiological saline). 2<br>
hours later rats are submitted consecutively to thermal and tactile<br>
stimulation of both the non-inflamed and the inflamed hindpaws. For<br>
thermal stimulation, the apparatus (Ugo Basile, Reference: 7371) consists<br>
of 6 individual Plexiglas boxes (17x11 x13 cm) placed upon an elevated<br>
glass floor. A rat is placed in the box and left free to habituate for 10<br>
minutes. Then, a mobile infrared radiant source (setting 20) is focused<br>
under the non-inflamed and inflamed hindpaws and the paw-withdrawal<br>
latencies are automatically recorded. Paw-withdrawal interrupts the<br>
reflected radiation and switches off the counter and the light source. In<br>
order to prevent tissue damage, if no reaction is noted, the test is<br>
terminated after 45 seconds. For tactile stimulation, the animal is placed<br>
under an inverted Plexiglas box (17x11x13 cm) on a grid floor. The tip of<br>
an electronic Von Frey probe is then applied with increasing pressure to<br>
the non-inflamed and inflamed hindpaws and the force required to induce<br>
paw-withdrawal is automatically recorded. This procedure is carried out 3<br>
times and the mean force per paw is calculated to provide basic scores per<br>
animal. 3.5 hours later, the animals are sacrificed by a blow to the cervical<br>
vertebrae and the hind-paws sectioned and weighed. An increase in paw<br>
weight (edema) indicates inflammation. This later procedure can also be<br>
appiled to mice.<br>
2. Yeast Hyperthermia Test in the mouse or rat according to by Teotino et<br>
al (J. Med. Chem. 1963, 6: 248):<br>
Animals are first measured for rectal temperature using a rectal probe.<br>
They are then injected with a yeast suspension (512 mg/kg s.c). 8 hours<br>
later, the test substance is administered. Mice are measured for rectal<br>
temperature immediately before test substance administration and again<br>
60 and 120 minutes later.<br>
Example 4: Procedures in rats to test pain-releaving properties in chronic<br>
pain and inflammation<br>
1. Chronic inflammatory pain test (Freund"s adjuvant test) in the rat<br>
according to Whiteley (Current Protocols in Pharmacology, Wiley, New<br>
York, 5.5,1999):<br>
An injection of Freund"s adjuvant in rats induces chronic clinical signs of<br>
polyarthritis with pain. On Day 1, rats are weighed and injected<br>
intradermally with a suspension of Mycobacterium butyricum (Freund"s<br>
adjuvant) into the proximal quarter of the tail (1 mg in 0.1 ml mineral oil).<br>
Sham controls receive a similar injection of mineral oil. On Day 18, when<br>
the chronic state is fully installed, rats are weighed again and are evaluated<br>
for clinical symptoms of inflammation. They are then submitted<br>
consecutively to thermal and tactile stimulation of both hindpaws. For the<br>
clinical signs, each paw is scored for inflammation according to a 5-point<br>
scale (0-4) and the tail according to a 4-point scale (0-3), i.e. a maximum<br>
score of 19 per animal. For thermal stimulation, the apparatus (Ugo Basile,<br>
Reference: 7371) consists of 6 individual Plexiglas boxes (17x11x13 cm)<br>
placed upon an elevated glass floor. A rat is placed in the box and left free<br>
to habituate for 10 minutes. Then, a mobile infrared radiant source (setting<br>
20) is focused under each hindpaw and the paw-withdrawal latency is<br>
automatically recorded. Paw-withdrawal interrupts the reflected radiation<br>
and switches off the counter and the light source. In order to prevent tissue<br>
damage, if no reaction is noted, the test is terminated after 45 seconds. For<br>
tactile stimulation, the animal is placed under an inverted Plexiglas box (17<br>
x 11 x 13 cm) on a grid floor. The tip of an electronic Von Frey probe<br>
(Bioseb, Model 1610) is then applied with increasing pressure to each<br>
hindpaw and the force required to induce paw-withdrawal is automatically<br>
recorded. This procedure is carried out 3 times and the mean force per<br>
paw is calculated to provide basic scores per animal. Prior to receiving drug<br>
treatment all animals will be submitted to tactile stimulation and assigned to<br>
treatment groups matched on the basis of their pain response.<br>
2. Neuropathic pain test (Chung test) in the rat according to Kim and<br>
Chung (Pain 1992, 50: 355-363):<br>
Tight ligature of spinal nerves in rats is associated with hyperalgesia,<br>
aflodynia and spontaneous pain, and constitutes therefore a model for<br>
peripheral neuropathic pain in humans. Antihyperalgesics reduce these<br>
chronic signs of pain hypersensitivity. Rats (180 - 220 g) are anesthetized<br>
(sodium pentobarbital 40 mg/kg i.p.) and an incision at the L4-S2 level is<br>
performed to expose the left L5 and L6 spinal nerves. A ligature is tied<br>
tightly around each nerve. The wound is then sutured. The rats receive an<br>
i.m. injection of 50 000IU Penicilline and are allowed to recover. At least 2<br>
weeks after the surgery, when the chronic state is fully installed, rats are<br>
submitted consecutively to thermal and tactile stimulation of both the non-<br>
lesioned and the lesioned hindpaws. For thermal stimulation, the apparatus<br>
consists of 6 individual Plexiglas boxes (17x11 x 13 cm) placed upon an<br>
elevated glass floor. A rat is placed in the box and left free to habituate for<br>
10 minutes. Then, a mobile infrared radiant source (setting 20) is focused<br>
under the non-lesioned and lesioned hindpaws and the paw-withdrawal<br>
latencies are automatically recorded. Paw-withdrawal interrupts the<br>
reflected radiation and switches off the counter and the light source. In<br>
order to prevent tissue damage, if no reaction is noted, the test is<br>
terminated after 45 seconds. For tactile stimulation, the animal is placed<br>
under an inverted Plexiglas box (17x11x13 cm) on a grid floor. The tip of<br>
an electronic Von Frey probe is then applied with increasing pressure to the<br>
non-lesioned and lesioned hindpaws and the force required to induce paw-<br>
withdrawal is automatically recorded. This procedure is carried out 3 times<br>
and the mean force per paw is calculated to provide basic scores per<br>
animal. Prior to receiving drug treatment all animals will be submitted to<br>
tactile stimulation and assigned to treatment groups matched on the basis<br>
of their pain response.<br>
