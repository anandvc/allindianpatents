[Title  of  the  Invention]  INTERLOCK  BRAKING  SYSTEM  FOR MOTORCYCLE [Technical Field] [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to an interlock braking system for motorcycle. Particularly, the present invention relates to an improvement in an interlock braking system for motorcycle, the interlock braking system including: a first brake operating member swingably supported by a supporter; a first braking force transmission system transmitting an operating force of the first brake operating member to a first brake; an interlocking master cylinder actuated by the operating force of the first brake operating member so as to activate a second brake; and an equalizer mechanism capable of transmitting the operating force of the first brake operating member to both of the first braking force transmission system and the interlocking master cylinder. [0002]<br>
Such an interlock braking system for motorcycle has already been known as disclosed in Fig. 16 of Patent Document 1.<br>
[Patent Document 1] Japanese Patent No. 3754484 [Disclosure of the Invention] [Problems to be Solved by the Invention] [0003]<br>
Meanwhile, the equalizer mechanism of the conventional interlock braking system for motorcycle includes the following four shafts as its essential components in addition to two levers arranged in a T-shape: a first support shaft, which<br>
connects one of the levers to a rear-brake lever; a second support shaft, which connects the levers to each other; a first connecting shaft, which connects one end portion of the other one of the levers to a rear braking force transmission system; and a second connecting shaft, which connects the other end portion of the other one of the levers to an input piston of an interlocking master cylinder. Thus, the equalizer mechanism has a large number of components, and requires a large space for installation. For this reason, a rear-brake operating member, an interlocking brake, and the equalizer mechanism cannot be compactly arranged. As a result, particularly when the equalizer mechanism is attached to a steering handlebar having a limited space for attachment, the flexibility in design is reduced. [0004]<br>
The present invention has been made in view of the above-described circumstances. An object of the present invention is to provide an interlock braking system for motorcycle having a simplified structure of an equalizer mechanism and making it possible to compactly arrange a brake operating member, an interlocking master cylinder, and the equalizer mechanism. [Means for Solving the Problems] [0005]<br>
In order to achieve the above object, a first aspect of the present invention is an interlock braking system for motorcycle. The interlock braking system for motorcycle includes: a first brake operating member swingably supported by a supporter; a first braking force transmission system transmitting an operating force of the first brake operating<br>
member to a first brake; an interlocking master cylinder actuated by the operating force of the first brake operating member so as to actuate a second brake; and an equalizer mechanism capable of transmitting the operating force of the first brake operating member to both of the first braking force transmission system and the interlocking master cylinder. In the interlock braking system for motorcycle, the equalizer mechanism includes an arm member, a knocker member, and a second connecting shaft. The arm member is rotatably supported by the supporter with a support shaft, and has a first arm and a second arm extending in opposite directions to each other. The knocker member is swingably connected to the first arm by a first connecting shaft, and has a contact portion and a pressing portion. The contact portion directly receives the operating force of the first brake operating member, and the pressing portion applies the operating force received from the first brake operating member to the interlocking master cylinder. The second connecting shaft connects the first braking force transmission system to the second arm in such a manner that the second arm and the first braking force transmission system are swingable relative to each other. [0006]<br>
In addition to the first aspect, a second aspect of the present invention is that both of the first brake operating member and the arm member are supported by the supporter commonly with the support shaft. [0007]<br>
Moreover, in addition to the first or second aspect, a third aspect of the present invention is that the knocker member is provided with a long hole through which the support shaft<br>
penetrates, and which allows rotational movement of the knocker member about the first connecting shaft. [0008]<br>
Further, in addition to any one of the first to third aspects, a fourth aspect of the present invention is that the knocker member is arranged to overlap the first brake operating member, and the contact portion is composed of a contact piece bent from the knocker member and brought into contact with an operating arm of the first brake operating member. [0009]<br>
Furthermore, in addition to the fourth aspect, a fifth aspect of the present invention is that while the knocker member overlaps the first brake operating member, the arm member is also arranged to overlap the knocker member. [0010]<br>
Still furthermore, in addition to any one of the first to fifth aspects, a sixth aspect of the present invention is that the interlock braking system for motorcycle further comprises equalizer restricting means for restricting the operation of the equalizer mechanism, in which in the operation of the first brake operating member, the equalizer restricting means restricts the operation of the equalizer mechanism so that the interlocking master cylinder is held at a non-actuating state thereof as long as the operating force of the first brake operating member is less than a predetermined value. [0011]<br>
Yet furthermore, in addition to any one of the first to sixth aspects, a seventh aspect of the present invention is that the knocker member is provided with an adjustment member which comes into contact with the support shaft so as to adjustably<br>
restrict an amount of operation of the knocker member with<br>
respect to the interlocking master cylinder.<br>
[0012]<br>
Still yet furthermore, in addition to any one of the first to seventh aspects, an eighth aspect of the present invention is that the interlocking master cylinder is attached to a steering handlebar, and a rear-braking lever serving as the first brake operating member is pivotally supported in a lever holder provided outward, in a vehicle-width direction, of the interlocking master cylinder. [0013]<br>
The following should be noted: the supporter corresponds to a second lever holder 12a in an embodiment, which will be described later, of the present invention; the first and second brakes correspond respectively to a rear brake Br and a front brake Bf; the first brake operating member corresponds to a rear-brake lever 13; the first braking force transmission system corresponds to a brake cable 15; and the equalizer restricting means corresponds to a return spring 21. [Effects of the Invention] [0014]<br>
According to the first aspect of the present invention, the first brake operating member, the knocker member, and the arm member overlap one another. In addition, the knocker member and the arm member are connected to each other by the first connecting shaft so as to be swingable relative to each other, while the operating force of the first brake operating member is transmitted directly to the knocker member. Accordingly, the components for the braking operation and the equalizer mechanism can be compactly constructed. As a result, the first<br>
brake operating member and the equalizer mechanism can be easily attached and put together compactly, even in a place with a limited space, such as a steering handlebar. [0015]<br>
According to the second aspect of the present invention, the single support shaft is shared for supporting both the first brake operating member and the arm member. Accordingly, this structure contributes to a reduction in the number of components and to making compact the components for the braking operation and the equalizer mechanism. [0016]<br>
According to the third aspect of the present invention, the actuation of the interlocking master cylinder by the knocker member can be performed without being interfered by the support shaft. Accordingly, there is no need to employ for the knocker member such a large shape as to bypass the support shaft for the purpose of avoiding the interference of the knocker member with the support shaft. This structure contributes to making further compact the equalizer mechanism. [0017]<br>
According to the fourth aspect of the present invention, the structure for bringing the first brake operating member and the knocker member into contact with each other can be obtained with a simple configuration. Accordingly, the manufacturing costs can be reduced. Moreover, the bending length of the contact piece, which is brought into contact with the operating arm of the first brake operating member, of the knocker member can be formed small. In this way, the rigidity of the contact piece can be enhanced, and the positioning accuracy of the contact portions with respect to each other can be improved.<br>
[0018]<br>
According to the fifth aspect of the present invention, the knocker member and the arm member can be connected to each other with the first connecting shaft, that is, with the possible minimum length. This arrangement enhances the rigidity of that portion, contributes to an improvement in durability, and also makes it possible to reduce the size of each of these members. [0019]<br>
According to the sixth aspect of the present invention, the braking force distribution characteristics to the first and second brakes can be approximated to ideal characteristics. [0020]<br>
According to the seventh aspect of the present invention, the action of the adjustment member makes it possible to freely set the point of restricting an increase in the braking force of the front brake, so that desired braking force distribution characteristics can be obtained. [0021]<br>
According to the eighth aspect of the present invention, the assembly of the three components, that is, the rear-brake lever, the equalizer mechanism, and the interlocking master cylinder, can be compactly constructed, and can be compactly attached to the steering handlebar, so that the flexibility in designing the external appearance can be enhanced. [Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention] [0022]<br>

Fig. 8 is an explanatory view illustrating the action of the interlock braking system at a final stage of the operation. Fig. 9 is a diagram showing braking force distribution characteristics to a rear brake and a front brake in the interlock braking system. [0024]<br>
In Fig. 1, a cylinder body 2 of a front master cylinder Ml, which is located adjacent to an inner end of a right-hand grip SR, is fixed to a steering handlebar S of a motorcycle. A front-brake lever 4 is pivotally supported to be swingable forward and rearward by a lever holder 2a formed integrally with the cylinder body 2. The front-brake lever 4 is capable of causing an input piston 3 of the front master cylinder Ml to move forward. The front master cylinder Ml includes an output port 6 through which a hydraulic pressure generated by the forward movement of the input piston 3 is outputted. [0025]<br>
On the other hand, a front brake Bf for braking a front<br>
wheel of the motorcycle is composed of a hydraulic disc brake, and has a caliper 8 provided with first and second input ports 9a and 9b. The front brake Bf is activated when a hydraulic pressure is supplied to at least one of the first and second input ports 9a and 9b. The output port 6 is connected to the first input port 9a via a first hydraulic conduit 10. Accordingly, when the front master cylinder Ml is actuated by the operation of the front-brake lever 4, the output hydraulic pressure is supplied from the front master cylinder Ml to the first input port 9a of the caliper 8, so that the front brake Bf is activated. [0026]<br>
In addition, a cylinder body 12 of an interlocking master cylinder M2, which is located adjacent to an inner end of a left-hand grip SL, is attached to the steering handlebar S. A rear-brake lever 13 is pivotally supported by second lever holders 12a formed integrally with the cylinder body 12 at an outer end portion, in the vehicle-width direction, of the cylinder body 12. [0027]<br>
On the other hand, a rear brake Br of the motorcycle is composed of a mechanical drum brake, and has an operating lever 14. The rear brake Br is activated when a brake cable 15 connected to the operating lever 14 is pulled. The starting end of the brake cable 15 extends to the rear-brake lever 13 side, and is held by a cable holder 12b formed integrally with the cylinder body 12. [0028]<br>
An equalizer mechanism 16 is disposed among the rear-brake lever 13, the interlocking master cylinder M2, and<br>
the brake cable 15. The equalizer mechanism 16 allows an operating force of the rear-brake lever 13 to be transmitted to the interlocking master cylinder M2 and the brake cable 15. Hereinafter, the interlocking master cylinder M2 and the equalizer mechanism 16 will be described. [0029]<br>
First, as shown in Fig. 3, the interlocking master cylinder M2 includes: the cylinder body 12 having a cylinder hole CH formed therein; an input piston 20 slidably fitted into the cylinder hole CH and defining a hydraulic chamber 19 in the cylinder hole CH; a return spring 21 housed in the hydraulic chamber 19 and urging the input piston 20 in its retracting direction with a predetermined set load; and a reservoir 22 located above the cylinder hole CH and reserving a hydraulic fluid supplied to the hydraulic chamber 19. An output port 23 is provided in a front end wall of the hydraulic chamber 19. The retracted position of the input piston 20 is restricted in such a way that a flange 20a formed at an intermediate portion of the input piston 20 comes into contact with a stopper ring 24 locked in the cylinder body 12. Accordingly, moving forward the input piston 20 against the set load of the return spring 21 causes the hydraulic pressure generated in the hydraulic chamber 19 to be outputted through the output port 23. The output port 23 is connected to the second input port 9b of the caliper 8 of the front brake Bf via a second hydraulic conduit 25. Accordingly, the actuation of the interlocking master cylinder M2 can also activate the front brake Br. [0030]<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, a bracket 26, which is fitted onto a front semicircular surface of the steering handlebar S, is<br>
formed integrally with the cylinder body 12. A bracket cap 27 is fastened, at the upper and lower end portions thereof, to the bracket 26 with bolts 18, so that the steering handlebar S is held between the bracket 26 and the bracket cap 27. In this way, the interlocking master cylinder M2 is attached to the steering handlebar S. In addition, as shown in Fig. 3, the pair of upper and lower lever holders 12a, 12a, each protruding rearward relative to the rear end of the input piston 20, are formed integrally with the cylinder body 12. The rear-brake lever 13 is swingably supported by a support shaft 30, which is supported, at both end portions thereof, by the respective lever holders 12a, 12a. The support shaft 30 is arranged on the axis of the input piston 20. [0031]<br>
Next, as shown in Figs. 2 to 5, the equalizer mechanism 16 includes: an arm member 31 swingably supported by the support shaft 30 below the rear-brake lever 13; and a knocker member 32 disposed so as to be sandwiched by the arm member 31 and the rear-brake lever 13. In this manner, the rear-brake lever 13, the knocker member 32, and the arm member 31 are arranged to overlap one another in this order from the top between the pair of lever holders 12a, 12a. [0032]<br>
The arm member 31 is formed in an I-shape having first and second arms 31a and 31b extending from the support shaft 30 in the opposite directions to each other, that is, respectively in the front and rear directions of the vehicle, in the embodiment shown in the figures. One end portion of the knocker member 32 is connected, with a first connecting shaft 33, to a tip portion of the first arm 31a extending rearward,<br>
so that the knocker member 32 and the first arm 31a are swingable relative to each other. On the other hand, the starting end of the brake cable 15 is connected, via a second connecting shaft 34, to a tip portion of the second arm 31b extending frontward. [0033]<br>
In Fig. 5, the rear-brake lever 13 integrally includes: a stopper arm 13a and an operating arm 13b. The stopper arm 13a comes into contact with a stopper surface 12c formed on one side of the cylinder body 12, and thus restricts the non-operating position of the rear-brake lever 13. The operating arm 13b has a front end portion thereof located at an intermediate position between the support shaft 30 and the first connecting shaft 33 in a plan view. A contact piece 32a, which is bent upward, is formed on one side edge of the knocker member 32. When the rear-brake lever 13 is operated, the contact piece 32a is pressed by the front end portion of the operating arm 13b. Here, A denotes a distance from a contact point of the operating arm 13b and the contact piece 32a to the first connecting shaft 33, while B denotes a distance from the contact point to a contact point of a pressing portion 32b and the input piston 20. The selecting of the ratio of the distance A to the distance B makes it possible to set the distribution of the operating force of the rear-brake lever 13 to the arm member 31 and thus to the input piston 20. [0034]<br>
The knocker member 32 has a long hole 35 formed therein through which the support shaft 30 penetrates, so that the knocker member 32 is allowed to swing within a predetermined angle range about the first connecting shaft 33 without being interfered by the support shaft 30.  In addition, the knocker<br>
member 32 also has the pressing portion 32b formed therein which abuts on, and thus is capable of pressing, the rear end portion of the input piston 20. The surface, which abuts on the input piston 20, of the pressing portion 32b is formed in an arcuate shape.<br>
[0035]<br>
Moreover, an adjustment screw 37 is screwed into a rear end wall, on the opposite side to the pressing portion 32b, of the long hole 35 of the knocker member 32, so as to be capable of being advanced and retreated for adjustment against an outer peripheral surface of the support shaft 30.<br>
[0036]<br>
The support shaft 30 is arranged on the axis of the input piston 20. This arrangement allows the equalizer mechanism 16 to be arranged in a concentrated manner near the input piston 20, so that the entire structure of the equalizer mechanism 16 can be made compact. In addition, this arrangement allows the pressing portion 32b of the knocker member 32 to press the center portion of the input piston 20, and thus contributes to an improvement in transmission efficiency of the operating force.<br>
[0037]<br>
In Figs. 1 and 2, the brake cable 15 is a Bowden cable including an inner cable 15a and an outer cable 15b through which the inner cable 15a is slidably inserted. The inner cable 15a is connected at one end portion thereof to the second connecting shaft 34 and is also connected at the other end portion thereof to the operating lever 14. In the embodiment shown in the figures, the second connecting shaft 34 is formed of a cylindrical connecting terminal casted together with and thus connected to an end portion of the inner cable 15a.<br>
[0038]<br>
On the other hand, the outer cable 15b is held at one end portion thereof by the cable holder 12b and is also held at the other end portion thereof by a fixing bracket 39 disposed adjacent to the rear brake Br. A return spring 40 is provided in a compressed manner between the fixing bracket 39 and the operating lever 14 so as to urge the operating lever 14 toward its non-operating position. [0039]<br>
Meanwhile, the set load of the return spring 21 in the interlocking master cylinder M2 is set at such a value that, in the operation of the rear-brake lever 13, the return spring 21 holds the input piston 20 of the interlocking master cylinder M2 at its retracted position as long as the operating force of the rear-brake lever 13 is less than a predetermined value. [0040]<br>
Next, the operation of the embodiment will be described. [0041]<br>
In the non-operating state of the rear-brake lever 13, as shown in Fig. 5, the input piston 20 of the interlocking master cylinder M2 is held at its retracted position by the set load of the return spring 21. The knocker member 32 having the pressing portion 32b in contact with the rear end surface of the input piston 20 causes the contact piece 32a to be in contact with the front end portion of the operating arm 13b of the rear-brake lever 13. With this operation of the knocker member 32, the rear-brake lever 13 is held at its retreated position where the stopper arm 13a is in contact with the stopper surface 12c of the cylinder body 12. [0042]<br>
 <br>
Now, the rear-brake lever 13 is operated to be pulled toward the left-hand grip SL in order to activate the rear brake Br. First, as shown in Fig. 6, the operating arm 13b of the rear-brake lever 13 rotates in a counterclockwise direction about the support shaft 30 so as to press the contact piece 32a of the knocker member 32 to the input piston 20 side. This pressing force is divided into: a force causing the knocker member 32 to rotate about the first connecting shaft 33 so as to press the pressing portion 32b against the rear end surface of the input piston 20; and a force causing, via the knocker member 32 and the first connecting shaft 33, the arm member 31 to rotate in a counterclockwise direction about the support shaft 30. [0043]<br>
However, as already described above, the set load of the return spring 21 in the interlocking master cylinder M2 is set at such a value that, in the operation of the rear-brake lever 13, the return spring 21 holds the input piston 20 of the interlocking master cylinder M2 at its retracted position as long as the operating force of the rear-brake lever 13 is less than the predetermined value. For this reason, in the initial stage of the operation of the rear-brake lever 13 with an operating force less than the predetermined value, the input piston 20 does not move from its retracted position as shown in Fig. 6. The knocker member 32 and the arm member 31 thus rotate integrally with the rear-brake lever 13 in the counterclockwise direction about the support shaft 30 so as to pull the inner cable 15a via the second connecting shaft 34. As a result of the pulling of the inner cable 15a, the operating lever 14 rotates to thus activate the rear brake Br.<br>
[0044]<br>
Thereafter, once the operating force of the rear-brake lever 13 is increased to the predetermined value or above, in other words, once the braking force of the rear brake Br is increased to a predetermined value or above, the knocker member 32 receives with the contact piece 32a an increased pressing force from the operating arm 13b of the rear-brake lever 13, as shown in Fig. 7. Accordingly, the knocker member 32 rotates in a clockwise direction about the first connecting shaft 33, and thus presses and moves forward the input piston 20 with the pressing portion 32b against the set load of the return spring 21. This action generates a hydraulic pressure in the hydraulic chamber 19 of the interlocking master cylinder M2. The hydraulic pressure thus generated is supplied via the second hydraulic conduit 25 to the second input port 9b of the caliper 8 of the front brake Bf, thus activating the front brake Bf. In this event, in association with the rotation of the knocker member 32 in the clockwise direction, the long hole 35 of the knocker member 32 moves rightward relative to the support shaft 30, so that the interference of the knocker member 32 with the support shaft 30 can be avoided.<br>
[0045]<br>
During the above operation, the increasing operating force of the rear-brake lever 13 keeps acting also on the arm member 31 via the knocker member 32, so that the braking force of the rear brake Br is increased. The braking force distribution characteristics to the rear brake Br and the front brake Bf during this operation can be shown by the line from the point a to the point b in Fig. 9.<br>
[0046]<br>
When the operating force of the rear-brake lever 13 is further increased, the amount of the forward movement of the input piston 20 by the knocker member 32 reaches a defined value, and then, the braking force applied to the front brake Bf reaches a set value. At this time, as shown in Fig. 8, the adjustment screw 37, which comes out in the long hole 35, of the knocker member 32 is brought into contact with the support shaft 30 so as to prevent the knocker member 32 from rotating toward the input piston 20. Accordingly, the knocker member 32 and the arm member 31 again rotate integrally with the rear-brake lever 13 about the support shaft 30. Moreover, since the pressing surface, pressing the input piston 20, of the pressing portion 32b of the knocker member 32 is formed in the arcuate shape, the increasing operating force of the rear-brake lever 13 is thereafter used only for the pulling of the inner cable 15a by the arm member 31, so that only the braking force of the rear brake Br is increased. [0047]<br>
The braking force distribution characteristics to the rear brake Br and the front brake Bf during this operation can be shown by the line from the point b to the point c in Fig. 9. Then, the point b at which an increase in the braking force of the front brake Bf is restricted is determined by an event where the adjustment screw 37 screwed into the knocker member 32 is brought into contact with the support shaft 30. Accordingly, by advancing and retreating for adjustment the adjustment screw 37 with respect to the support shaft 30, it is possible to freely set the point b at which an increase in the braking force of the front brake Bf is restricted. [0048]<br>
As described above, when the rear brake Br is activated by the operation of the rear-brake lever 13, the front brake Bf is also activated in association with the activation of the rear brake Br in a predetermined intermediate activating range. The braking force distribution characteristics to the rear brake Br and the front brake Bf can thereby be approximated to ideal distribution characteristics A shown in Fig. 9 with no operation of the front-brake lever 4. As a result, this configuration makes it possible to achieve both the simplification of the braking operation and improvement in the braking characteristics. [0049]<br>
In such front and rear wheel interlock braking system for motorcycle, the equalizer mechanism 16 includes: thearmmember 31 which is rotatably supported by the lever holder 12a with the support shaft 30, and which has the first and second arms 31a and 31b extending in the opposite directions to each other; the knocker member 32 which is swingably connected to the first arm 31a with the first connecting shaft 33, and which has the contact piece 32a directly receiving the operating force of the rear-brake lever 13 and the pressing portion 32b applying the operating force received from the rear-brake lever 13 to the interlocking master cylinder M2; and the second connecting shaft 34 connecting the brake cable 15 to the second arm 31b in such a way that the brake cable 15 and the second arm 31b are swingable relative to each other. The rear-brake lever 13, the knocker member 32, and the arm member 31 thus overlap with one another. Moreover, the knocker member 32 and the arm member 31 are connected to each other by the first connecting shaft 33 so as to be swingable relative to each other, and the operating<br>
force of the rear-brake lever 13 is directly transmitted to the knocker member 32 . Accordingly, the components for the braking operation and the equalizer mechanism 16 can be compactly constructed. As a result, the rear-brake lever 13 and the equalizer mechanism 16 can be easily attached and put together compactly, even in a place with a limited space, such as the steering handlebar S. [0050]<br>
In addition, since the rear-brake lever 13 and the arm member 31 are supported by the lever holder 12a with the same support shaft 30, the single support shaft 30 is shared for supporting both the rear-brake lever 13 and the arm member 31. This arrangement contributes to a reduction in the number of components and to making compact the components for the braking operation and the equalizer mechanism 16. [0051]<br>
Moreover, the knocker member 32 is provided with the long hole 35, through which the support shaft 30 penetrates, and which allows the rotational movement of the knocker member 32 about the first connecting shaft 33. Accordingly, the actuation of the interlocking master cylinder M2 by use of the knocker member 32 can be performed with no interference by the support shaft 30. As a result, there is no need to employ for the knocker member 32 such a large shape as to bypass the support shaft 30 for the purpose of avoiding the interference of the knocker member 32 with the support shaft 30. This structure contributes to making further compact the equalizer mechanism 16. [0052]<br>
Further, the knocker member 32 is arranged to overlap the<br>
rear-brake lever 13, and the contact piece 32a bent from the knocker member 32 is brought into contact with the operating arm 13b of the rear-brake lever 13. Accordingly, the structure for bringing the rear-brake lever 13 and the knocker member 32 into contact with each other can be simplified, in turn allowing the manufacturing costs to be reduced. In addition, the bending length of the contact piece 32a, which is brought into contact with the operating arm 13b of the rear-brake lever 13, of the knocker member 32 can be formed small. In this way, the rigidity of the contact piece 32a can be enhanced, and the positioning accuracy of the contacting portions with respect to each other can be improved. [0053]<br>
Furthermore, the knocker member 32 is arranged to overlap the rear-brake lever 13, and the arm member 31 is also arranged to overlap the knocker member 32. Accordingly, the knocker member 32 and the arm member 31 can be connected to each other with the first connecting shaft 33, that is, with the possible minimum length. This arrangement enhances the rigidity of that portion, contributes to an improvement in durability, and also makes it possible to reduce the size of each of these members. [0054]<br>
Still furthermore, the interlocking master cylinder M2 is attached to the steering handlebar S, and the rear-brake lever 13 is pivotally supported by the lever holder 12a provided outward, in the vehicle-width direction, of the interlocking master cylinder M2. Accordingly, the assembly of the three components, that is, the rear-brake lever 13, the equalizer mechanism 16, and the interlocking master cylinder M2, can be compactly attached to the steering handlebar S, so that the<br>
flexibility in designing the external appearance can be<br>
enhanced.<br>
[0055]<br>
Although the embodiment of the present invention has been described so far, the present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiment, and various modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. For example, a brake pedal may be employed in place of the rear-brake lever 13. In this case, a rod may be employed in place of the brake cable 15.<br>
