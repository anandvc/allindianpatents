				<td>PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF MELT PROCESSIBLE LIQUID CRYSTALLINF TERPOLYESTERS<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of melt processable liquid crystalline terpolyesters. The terpolyesters of the invention have the structure shown in formula I below:<br>
(FormulaRemoved)<br>
where R is CL C5H6. CH3CO. CH3<br>
Formula I<br>
The terpolyesters prepared by the process of the present invention are poly (4-phenylene naphthalene -2,6-carboxylate -co- 8 (3- oxyphenyl) octanoate), poly (4 - phenylene, 2 -methoxynaphthalene -2,6- carboxylate - co - 8 (3 - oxyphenyl) octanoate), poly (4 - phenylene 2 -phenyl naphthalene - 2, 6 - carboxylate -co - 8 (3 - oxyphenyl) octanoate) and related terpolyesters. The terpolyesters prepared by the process of the present invention are liquid crystalline polymers which can be used in electronics (eg. surface mount units, connectors, printing wiring boards etc. where-low--coefficient-of thermal expansionon-and-low dielectric-properties are required in computer-fields, in industry for making chemically resistant part (eg. tower packing saddles to replace ceramics). The industries to which the invention can apply are plastic industries / electronic industries/ computer industries. Background of the invention<br>
Thermotropic liquid crystalline terpolyesters obtained from rigid monomers, such as 4-hydroxybenzoic acid are intractable, insoluble and not processable because they decompose prior to<br><br>
melting and their transition temperatures are too high for the existing equipment to process them. (A. I Isayev, T. Kyu and S. Z. D.

There have been a large number of attempts to bring down the transition temperatures to a processable range (W. J. Jackson. Jr. aid H. F. Kuhfuss,.J. Appl. Polym. Sci.. 25, 1685 (1985,). A J East, L.

Sneddon, Polymer, 33, 3968 (1992)). A number of chemical approaches have been devised to arrive at structures that have lower transition temperatures and lower symmetries. These approaches involve disrupting the ordered structures of the homopolyesters by introducing chain disrupters such as flexible unit, a kink structure, or crank shaft structure etc. or by copolymerising with suitable comonomers that bring down the transition temperatures (W. J. Jackson, Jr. and H. F. Kuhfuss, J. Appl Polym. Sci., 25, 1685 (1985);. A. J. East, L. F. Charbenneau and G. W. Calundann, Mo/. Cryst. Liq. Inc. Non Linear Opt. 157, 615 (1988); A. Roviello and A.

Chem. 33, 415 (1995); V. Percec and H. Oda, J. Polym. Sci. Part A: Polym. Chem.33, 2359 (1995); J. Economy and K. Goranov,   Advances in Polymer Science, Vol. 117, High Performance Polymers, Springer verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg, 1994; C. K. S. Pillai, D. C. Sherrington and A. Sneddon, Polymer, 33,    3968 (1992)). A number of copolyesters have thus been prepared .out of which a few commercial polymers such as Vectra®. and<br>
Xydar®, are well known. It is, however, .now realised that these copolyesters still have-a processing temperature above 300°C and hence require newer methods or structures to overcome this problem. It is well known that introduction of disrupters such as a "kink" or flexible segments brings down the transition temperature of liquid crystalline polyesters to a processable range (J. Economy and K. Goranov, Advances_in Polymer Science. Vol. 117, High Performance Polymers, Springer verlag. Berlin, Heidelberg, 1994; A. I. Isayev, T. Kyu and S. 2 D. Cheng, Liquid Crystalline Polymer Systems: Technological Advances. American Chemical Society, Washington, DC, 1996). It has been shown that copolymerisation of hydroxy benzoic acid with comonomers having kink or flexible structures gives rise to decrease in the transition temperatures. Although a variety of comonomers containing such structural features have been employed for the synthesis of liquid crystalline copolyesters, use of a comonomer having both a kink and flexible segment built into the same<br><br>
molecule is rare. 8(3- hydroxyphenyl)octanoic acid is, thus, a comonomer having both kink and flexible segments in its structure which when copolymerised with hydroxy benzoic acid gave a transition temperature as low as 256°C (C. K. S. Pillai, D. C. Sherrington and A. Sneddon, Polymer, 33, 3968 (1992)); However, it was noted that this polymer although liquid crystalline, decompose before melting( Rajalekshmi, M. Saminathan, C.K.S. Pillai and C.P.Prabhakaran, J. Polym. Sci., Polym. Chem., 34, (2851) 1996). It was therefore thought that appropriate substitution in the phenolic ring may give rise to meltable polymers and hence expected to bring down the transition temperature when copolymerised stands a significant chance for contributing to solving this problem. The drawbacks of the currently marketed liquid crystalline polyesters are that, polyesters of 4-hydroxy benzoic acid do not form a rneit below its decomposition temperature and liquid crystalline copolyesters like 4-hydroxy benzoic acid / polyethylene terepthalate system (Eastman X76) has several shortcomings in that the heat distortion temp is low (

These terpolyestes are thermotropic liquid crystalline polymers having thermal stability value in the range of Ti (Temperature at which thermal decomposition is initiated) 370 - 390°C.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
The process of the present invention has essentially the following steps: in situ scetylation of the monomers, hydroquinone and 8- (3 hydroxy phenyl) octanoic acid in presence cf acetylating agents such as excess phthalic anhydride, trifluoroacetic anhydride, acetic anhydride or chloroacetic anhydride and acidolysis polycondensation of the acetoxy derivative of the hydroxy acid and the diol with 2,6 naphthalene dicarboxylic acid by acidolysis polycondensation in presence of transesterfication catalysts such as magnesium acetate, antimony trioxide , lead acetate etc. at higher temperatures in the order of 240-280°C for 2-6 hrs in inert atmospheres. Polymerisation was further continued under reduced pressure of 1-3 mm of Hg at a temperature range of 260-2SOoC for a period of 1-6 hrs. This was followed by a postpolymerisation step carried out at a temperature in the range of 260-280°C under inert atmosphere for 24-72 hrs and a purification step involving soxhlet extraction using solvent mixtures such as acetone-methanol, acetone -methylethyl ketone , acetone -isopropanol mixtures etc.<br>

Example 2<br>

Then temperature was increased to 250-300 °C and continued for 2-3 hrs in presence of 3ml of high temperature solvent Dowtherm®. Polymerisation was further continued at 0.01mm of Hg pressure for 1-2 hrs. Then the<br><br>
polymer was chipped out of the tube and purified by soxhlet extraction using acetone / isopropanol mixture for about 18 hrs and dried in an air oven at 60°C for about 3 hrs at reduced pressure. Example 3<br>
In a 60 ml polymerisation tube 0.2mol of 8 (3-hydroxyphenyl)octanoic acid ,0.40mol of 2 phenyl hydroquinone, and 0.40 mol of 2,6 naphthalene dicarboxylic   acid were taken mixed with O.O8moI of acetic anhydride and 0.01 mmol of magnesium acetate were added and heated under slow stirring in a slow purge of nitrogen to 140 °C and continued the heating for 1/2 hr.

Then the polymer was chipped out of the tube and purified by soxhlet extraction using acetone / isopropanol mixture for about 18 hrs and dried in an air oven at 60°C for about 3 hrs at reduced pressure.<br>
The advantages of the present invention are the following:<br>
The present invention provides a process for the preparation of melt processable liquid crystalline terpolyester from 8(3-hydroxyphenyl)octanoic acid, hydroquinones and 2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylic acid. The liquid crystalline terpolyester obtained from 8(3-hydroxyphenyl ) octanoic acid, hydroquinones and 2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylic acid of formula I has a transition temperature @ 220-240°C which is lower than those (300°C) of the commercial liquid crystalline copolyester such as Vectra® and terpolyesters such as Xydar®. Hence, the liquid crystalline terpolyester obtained by<br><br>
the process of the present invention can be melt processed at a lower temperature than that of Yectra® and Xydar® and this may solve many of the processing problems associated with the existing commercial liquid crystalline polymers. The liquid crystalline terpolyesters obtained by the process of the present invention do not decompose before melting whereas poly(4-hydroxybenzoate) decomposes prior to melting. As the presentinvention described by the present process of preparation of liquid crystalline terpolyester from 8(3-hydroxyphenyl) octanoic acid, hydroquinones and 2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylic acid does not use a comonomer which is too expensive, the ccst of the liquid crystalline terpolyester obtained by the present process is rather low when compared to those of Vectra® and Xydar®. 8(3-hydroxyphenyl) octanoic acid .and hydroquinone, the comczamers used in the preparation of the terpolyester prepared by the process of the present invention, are comparatively cheaper. The process of the present invention has a step of post-polymerisation whereby a higher molecular weight is obtained so that the properties of the polymer are better. This terpciyester has got<br>
comparatively higher decomposition temperature, Ti of @ 370-390°C. The cost of the terpclyesters are comparatively less than that of the commercial copolyesters. It shows drastic reduction in viscosity due to nematic mesophase which is required for further processing by injection moling and extrusion.<br><br><br><br>
