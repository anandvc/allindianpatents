				<td>This invention relates to a process for the preparation of a mixture of methanol and formaldehyde through the oxidation of methane. More particularly the present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of methanol and formaldehyde by the oxidation of methane, using an oxidant and a solid salen transition metal complex as a catalyst. The source of methane may be either pure methane or natural gas. Methane conversions are of particular interest due to large reserves of natural gas located in remote areas, far from their main centers of consumption. It is expensive to transport the gas to the latter location. It is preferable to convert it into liquids like methanol before transport. Large quantities of methane are also available from the decomposition of biomass, municipal waste, rice fields etc. Methane is one of the major greenhouse gases considered to be the primary causes of global warming. Hence technologies for the effective conversion of methane value added fuels or chemicals like methanol are desirable. The direct selective oxidation of methane to methanol is difficult to achieve. Considerable research is underway in an attempt to convert methane to methanol directly and bypass the costly reforming step. Present technology for methane conversion to to methanol is based on steam reforming   or partial oxidation to synthesis gas (CO+H2) followed by methanol synthesis. Although well integrated processes have been developed for conventional technology through synthesis gas, there is no escaping from the fact that it is first necessary to conduct an energy intensive endothermic steam reforming step followed by a subsequent catalytic conversion step which has equilibrated limitations. If one could directly convert methane in a single exothermic oxidation step in high yield,<br>
this would be more attractive than current trends. One would in effect supplement a two step route having a costly endothermic first step with a direct one-step route which is highly exothermic and cogenerate energy. Methane is oxidised to methanol at ambient conditions by certain enzymatic catalyst systems. Certain bacteria have been found which rely exclusively on methane as their source of life sustaining carbon compounds and energy.  The first and most difficult step in the processing of methane by these methanotrophic bacteria is its conversion into methyl alcohol. This conversion is catalyzed by a family of enzymes, the methane monooxygenases. These enzymes use C&gt;2 as their oxygen source. Moreover, although methane is the only hydrocarbon known to sustain growth of the bacteria, methane monooxygenases are able to catalyze the oxidation  of other  hydrocarbons   like  ethane,   propane  and  butane.   Oxidation   is accomplished by forming an activated oxygen : enzymes: substrate complex charged with two electrons acquired from a suitable donor such as NADH. The enzymatic systems, however, have practical limitations for industrial use because of the need for low concentrations of substrate, stiochiometric coreductants, narrow windows of temperature and pH etc. Synthetic bio-mimetics catalysts, dubbed enzymes can mimic enzymatic catalysis but suffer from similar drawbacks. Recent studies by Ellis et al ( J. Chem. Soc; Chem. Comm., 1989,1315) with higher hydrocarbons indicate that it may be possible to mimic some of the characteristics of the biological systems while catalyzing alkane oxidation using only oxygen and no coreductant with catalysts which are robust enough to survive industrial process conditions.<br>
U.S patent 5,345,011 claims the use of alummophosphates containing manganese in the structural framework as catalysts for the oxidation of methane to methanol in the vapour phase. However, methane conversion was low, being below 5 %. The selectivity for methanol was in the range 30-50 % mole. The use of ruthenium metal complex catalyst containing an end or bridged oxo group with a ligand L and a carboxylato group for the oxidation of methane to methanol was also claimed in U.S Patent 5,347,057. The catalyst turnover rate for the oxidation of reaction, however, was relatively low. In this system, the  ligand  and  the  ruthenium  metal  component  are  costly components  and the recyclability of the catalysts remains questionable. The gas phase oxidation of natural gas to methanol by molecular oxygen has also been disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,618,732. A 13 % conversion of natural gas ( composition not mentioned) was claimed at 300-500°C and 10-100 atmospheres. U.S. Patents 4,918,249 and 5,132,472 used silicometallates as catalysts for the gas phase oxidation of methane to methanol and CO2 was reported. In all the gas phase oxidation of methane at temperatures above 100°C, referred to in the above patents, significant amounts of CO2 in excess of 10 % are produced. It is thus evident that there is a need for the development of a process for the low temperature oxidation of methane using solid, recyclable catalysts and operating at a low temperature  (below   100°C,  for example)  to  avoid the production  of undesirable byproducts like carbon dioxide.<br>
It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a process for the low temperature oxidation of methane to methanol and formaldehyde using a catalyst which would remain in the solid state at the end of the oxidation reaction thereby facilitating the<br>
easy separation, recovery and recycle of the catalyst from the reaction products without<br>
having any adverse impact on the environment.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the<br>
oxidation of methane at a temperature below that wherein the production of CO2 is<br>
significant.<br>
Salens are planar tetradentate ligand systems where metallic cations can be easily<br>
accommodated at the center of these ligands with the two oxygen and two nitrogen as the ligating atoms. Salen complexes are known to be useful as chemical reagents of a catalytic nature, more particularly in directing certain oxidative processes. Many known salens  have been judged to  suffer certain  drawbacks  by being deficient  in the combination of properties desired for many candidate use, such as in the oxidation of alkanes and more particularly in the oxidation of methane. One major draw back of homogeneous salen catalysts in industrial oxidation processes is the formation of aggregates in solution which significantly deactivates these catalysts. Due to our continued research in this area the inventor of the present invention have observed that the organotransition metal complexes used as catalysts are solids insoluble in methane or the reaction products arising from oxidation of methane. Hence they do not undergo aggregation or change of phase during the oxidation wherein such changes are known to lead to catalyst deactivation problems. We have found that the oxidative stability as well as the catalytic activity of the metal salens in the oxidation of methane are enhanced by replacing the hydrogens from the salen by electron withdrawing groups like the halogens or nitro groups thereby rendering the metal ions easier to reduce leading to an improved oxidation activity and stability of the catalysts during the reaction.<br>
There are total eight hydrogen atom positions on such salen molecules which can in principle, be substituted by other substituents. We have observed that when some of the hydrogen atoms of the said salen are substituted by one or more electron withdrawing groups such as halogens or nitro groups or mixture of such groups there is substantial improvement in conversion.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for preparation of a mixture of methanol and formaldehyde through the oxidation of methane which comprises reacting methane with an oxidant such as here in described in the presence of a solid organo transition metal complex as catalyst, the said organo transition metal complex is encapsulated in a solid matrix is a salen or substituted salen wherein some of the hydrogen atoms of the said organ transition metal complex have been substituted by one or more electron withdrawing groups selected from the halogens, the nitro group or mixture thereof, at a temperature in the range of 0 to 100 C, at a pressure in the range of 10 to 1000 psi pressure optionally in the presence of solvents, and a promoter such as herein described and isolating mixture of methanol and formaldehyde by conventional methods<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the organ transition metal complex is selected from salen or substituted salens, wherein some or all of the hydrogen atoms have been substituted by one or more electron withdrawing groups such as halogen or nitro groups.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the transition metal may be manganese and copper.<br>
Some no limiting examples of such oregano transition metal complexes used as catalysts in the oxidation of methane to methanol and formaldehyde are iron manganese halosalens, coper halosalens, manganese nitrosalens and copper nitrosalens.<br>
In yet another embodiment of present invention the electron withdrawing groups attached to the organotransition metal complex is selected from the halogen like chlorine or bromine or nitro groups.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the oxidation of methane by molecular oxygen is catalyzed by the halogen or nitro salens of the manganese or copper. In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the oxidant used may be molecular oxygen, air or a mixture of oxygen and an inert gas diluent like nitrogen. Yet another embodiment of the present invention, the above mentioned reaction can be carried out in the presence or absence of solvents. It may be advantageous option to carry out the said oxidation reaction in the presence of a suitable solvent which would maintain the oxidation products like methanol in the dissolved state during the course of the reaction, thereby facilitating the separation of the methanol from the solid catalysts. Suitable solvents for such use include acetonitrile, benzonitrile and pyridine. Examples of such solvents which can be used in the process of the present invention include acetonitrile, acetone, benzene or any other organic solvent which is inert under the oxidation reaction conditions.<br>
In one advantageous embodiment of the present invention, the rates of the oxidation of methane to methanol may be significantly enhanced by addition of very small catalytic quantities of promoter. Examples of such promoters include alkyl hydroperoxide, dialkylperoxides and such compounds. Cyclohexyl hydroperoxide, cumyl peroxide, tertiary butyl hydroperoxide are some of the examples of such promoters which may be present in concentrations not exceeding 1 % by weight of methane and more preferably 0.1 % by weight of methane.<br>
In yet another advantageous embodiment of the present invention, the organotransition metal complex may be encapsulated in a solid matrix. Due to the greater dispersion of the organotransition metal complex catalyst in solid matrices and the consequent enhanced stability of the structural integrity of the catalyst significant process advantages like greater activity, stability and easy recovery and recyclability of the catalyst are observed. Examples of such solid matrices include inorganic oxide like silica, alumina, molecular sieves, zeolites and the like as well as organic polymeric materials. It is advantageous feature of the present invention that due to the high activity the catalysts used herein, the oxidation reaction can be carried out at temperatures much below those used in prior art and preferably below 100°C, thereby leading to much lower yields of undesired side products like CC^.<br>
