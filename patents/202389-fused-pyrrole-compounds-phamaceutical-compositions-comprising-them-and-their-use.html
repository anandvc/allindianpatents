				<td>Fused pyrrole compounds, pharmaceutical compositions comprising them and their use<br>
The present invention relates to fused pyrrole compounds, in particular pyrrolizines, indolizines and heteroanalogues having selective inhibitory action on isoenzyme-2 of prostaglandin H synthase (COX-2); pharmaceutical compositions which contain these compounds; and the use of these compounds for the treatment of disorders of the rheumatic type.<br>
It is recognized that the arachidonic acid metabolites prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), prostaglandin I2 (PGI2) and thromboxane B2 (TXB2) intervene profoundly in the inflammatory process. The key enzyme for prostaglandin synthesis is prostaglandin H synthase. As a cyclooxygenase, it produces prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) from arachidonic acid via the intermediate prostaglandin G2 (PGG2). The enzyme exists in two isoforms, namely cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2. Since the structures of the two isoezymes have already been elucidated, structural differences between the two enzymes have also been investigated more thoroughly.<br>
Cyclooxygenase-1 exists in almost all cells and produces intra- and extracellular ubiquitous prostaglandin mediators which are necessary in physiological amounts for the function of organs, such as the stomach and kidneys.<br>
The inhibition of this enzyme suppresses the synthesis of the vasodilating PGE2 as well as that of the cytoprotective PGI2. The decreased circulation and lack of protective effect can lead to damage to the gastric mucous membrane and as a result to ulceration. As a result of ischaemia, decreased renal blood flow can lead to damage to the renal parenchyma and further to renal insufficiency.<br>
Cyclooxygenase-2, however, is only found in specialized cells, e.g. in blood cells, such as monocytes and granulocytes, in synovial cells, vascular endothelial cells (venous) and locally in inflamed tissue. Experimentally, the formation (expression) of the isoenzyme-2 is induced by phorbol esters, lipopolysaccharides and other stress factors which can provoke local inflammation.<br>
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as acetylsalicylic acid, mefanamic acid, diclofenac, indomethacin, ibuprofen and naproxen, are widely used clinically. Pharmacologically, they act via inhibition of cyclooxygenase.<br><br>
Pyrrolizine compounds which have a similar pharmacological action are known from numerous publications. For example, pyrrolizine compounds having anti-inflammatory activity are described in Arch. Pharm. 319, 65-69 (1986); 319, 231-234 (1986); 318, 661-663 (1985); 318, 663-664 (1985); 319, 500-505 (1986); 319, 749-755 (1986); 327, 509-514 (1994); 330, 307-312 (1997) and in J. Med. Chem. 1987, 30, 820-823 and 1994, 37,1894-1897.<br>
Further pyrrolizine compounds are described in US 5,260,451 (corresponding to EP 0397175) and in WO 95/32970; WO 95/32971; and WO 95/32972. These compounds have the structural formula<br><br>
A fused diarylpyrrole structural element and a third acidic radical R is common to all compounds. The compounds are distinguished by high lipophilicity, good bioavailability and average half-lives, see Drugs of the Future, 1995, 20 (10): 1007-1009.<br>
Further pyrrolizine compounds of similar constitution are described in DE 198 45 446.6 and PCT/EP 99/09057. According to US 4,232,038, alkylsulphinylbenzoyl- and alkylsulphonylbenzoyl-substituted pyrrolizines should also have anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic properties. According to DE 196 24 290.8 and DE 196 24 289.4, certain compounds of this type have lipid-lowering action.<br>
ML 3000 (i), for example, a vicinally diaryl-substituted pyrrole derivative, is described as a dual inhibitor of cyclooxygenase (COX) and 5-lipoxygenase (LOX).<br><br>
However, via the inhibition of cyclooxygenase, toxic side effects also result, which are especially associated with the inhibition of the constitutive, physiological cyclooxygenase-1. More recent<br><br>
investigations show that the classical NSAIDs have an inadequate selectivity and frequently even prefer the isoenzyme-1 of cyclooxygenase.<br>
A selective inhibition of the cycIooxygenase-2 specifically overexpressed in inflamed tissue and leading to tissue damage due to the formation of non-physiological tissue levels of prostaglandins should lead to a superior, namely lower side-effect, anti-inflammatory principle.<br>
Substances which selectively inhibit cyclooxygenase-2 have likewise already been described.<br>
These especially include all 5-membered heterocyclic rings having bisaryl substitution. For example, WO 94/15932 mentions 3,4-diarylthiophenes, -furans and -pyrroles, and occasionally 3-(4-methylsulphonylphenyl)-4-(4-fluorophenyl)thiophene. WO 94/27980 describes 4,5-diaryloxazoles, for example 4-(4-fIuorophenyl)-2-methyl-5-[4-(methylsulphonyl)phenyl]oxazole. In EP 0087629, 2,3-diaryl-5-halothiophenes, for example 5-bromo-2,3-bis(4-fluorophenyl)thiophene, are mentioned and WO 95/15315 reports 1,5-diphenylpyrazoles, for example 5-(4-fluorophenyl)-l-[4-(methylsulphonyl)phenyl]-3-(trifluoromethyl)pyrazole. 2,3-Diarylpyrroles are mentioned in WO 95/00501 just as the 3,4-diarylfuranones illustrated below by example of lactones 4 and 5.<br>
In addition, cycloaliphatic or aromatic non-heterocyclic rings with bisaryl substitution are also found. For example, bisarylphenyls, for example 2-[(4-methylthio)phenyl]-l-biphenyl, are also described in WO 96/10012. 5-membered rings, in turn, can be looked up in WO 95/11883 as 1,2-diarylcyclopentenes illustrated below by example of the cyclopentene 6, (SC57666, SC 57949), and to which a spiro unit can be linked in the 4-position following WO 95/21817, for example as is the case in 5-(4-fluorophenyl)-6-[4-(methylsulphonyl)phenyl]spiro[2.4]hept-5-ene. Finally, the 2,3-diarylcyclopentadienes described in WO 95/30656, for example 1-methylsulphonyl-4-[l,l-dimethyl-4-(4-fluorophenyl)cyclopenta-2,4-dien-3-yl]benzene, may also be mentioned.<br>
Further pyrroles are described by Wilkerson et al. in J. Med. Chem 1994, 37, 988-998 and J. Med. Chem. 1995, 38, 3895-3901. WO 99/61016 also indicates certain substituted pyrroles as cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors.<br><br><br>
In the case of the lactones 4 and 5, only compound 5 shows a high activity on cyclooxygenase-2 and high selectivity for this isoform.<br>
The object of the present invention was to make available novel compounds which inhibit cyclooxygenase-2 more strongly than cyclooxygenase-1.<br>

According to the invention, one of the radicals Rl, R2, R3 is 4-substituted phenyl (para-substituted phenyl), the substituent being selected from certain sulphur-containing groups, namely from alkylthio, alkylsulphinyl, alkylsulphonyl, sulphamoyl, N-alkylsulphamoyl, N,N-dialkylsulphamoyl, alkylsulphonamido and alkylsulphone-N-alkylamido. Preferred substituents are alkylthio, alkylsulphinyl, alkylsulphonyl, sulphamoyl and alkylsulphonamido, in particular methylthio, methylsulphinyl, methylsulphonyl, sulphamoyl and methylsulphonamido, very particularly methylsulphonyl and sulphamoyl.<br><br>
A - more advantageously lipophilic - second of the radicals Rl, R2, R3 can be linear or branched, alicyclic or heterocyclic, non-aromatic or aromatic. On the one hand, aryl radicals, in particular phenyl radicals, on the other hand aliphatic and cycloaliphatic, in particular alkyl, cycloalkyl and cycloalkylalkyl radicals, are preferred. These radicals can be substituted according to the above details. Substitution is advantageous in particular for the first case, i.e. of aryl substitution. Accordingly, the second of the radicals Rl, R2, R3 is in particular phenyl monosubstituted in the para or meta position, in particular 4-substituted phenyl. Optionally present substituents are preferably selected from alkyl groups, in particular methyl, and especially electronegative groups, such as halogen atoms, in particular fluorine, and haloalkyl groups, in particular trifluoromethyl.<br>
If the second of the radicals Rl, R2, R3 is an alkyl radical, on the one hand alkyl radicals having a relatively large number of carbon atoms, in particular the abovementioned C4.6-alkyl radicals, and of these advantageously the branched and in particular the singly branched, and on the other hand alkyl radicals having a relatively low number of carbon atoms, especially methyl, are preferred.<br>
If the second of the radicals Rl, R2, R3 is a cycloalkyl radical, cyclohexyl is particularly advantageous.<br>
If the second of the radicals Rl, R2, R3 is a cycloalkylalkyl radical, cycloalkylmethyl radicals are preferred, cyclopropylmethyl being advantageous.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the second of the radicals Rl, R2, R3 is a fluoroaliphatic, in particular a poly- or in particular perfluorinated aliphatic radical. In particular, mention may be made here of poly- and perfluorinated alkyl radicals, i.e. especially the previously described alkyl radicals, in which 2 or more and in particular all H atoms are replaced by fluorine atoms. This analogously applies to cycloalkyl and cycloalkylalkyl radicals.<br>
According to a particular embodiment of the present invention, a third of the radicals Rl, R2, R3 is hydrogen, alkyl, haloalkyl, hydroxyalkyl, halogen, cyano, alkylsulphonyl, sulphamoyl or B-Y, in which B is alkylene or alkenylene, each of which can optionally be substituted by hydroxyl or alkoxy, and Y is hydroxyl; in the context of this embodiment hydrogen, alkyl, haloalkyl, in particular CF3 or halogen, are preferred. If the third of the radicals is B-Y, B is preferably alkylene which is optionally substituted by hydroxyl.<br><br>
If the third radical is an alkyl radical, the relatively short radicals are preferred here, where mention may in particular be made of methyl. Preferred alkoxycarbonyl radicals are methoxy- and ethoxycarbonyl. Of the halogen atoms, chlorine and optionally bromine are preferred in this case.<br>
A second and a third of the radicals Rl, R2, R3, if they are vicinal to one another, together with the C atoms to which they are bonded, can also form a cycloaliphatic radical. If R2 and R3 are involved, this ring taken per se is an unsaturated ring, for example a cyclopentenyl or cyclohexenyl ring, as is illustrated in the present Example 32. If Rl and R2 are involved, the ring has two exocyclic double bonds.<br>
Preferably, the first and the second of the radicals Rl, R2, R3 are vicinal to one another, i.e. Rl and R2 or R2 and R3 are involved. This leads to advantages, in particular for the [a]-fused pyrrole compounds according to the invention having bisaryl substitution.<br>
In principle, the positions of the groups designated as first, second and third radicals are variable. It has proved advantageous if the first of the radicals Rl, R2,R3 is in the position of Rl orR3. It has also proved advantageous if the second of the radicals Rl, R2, R3 is in the posi tion of R2.<br>
Compounds in which R3 is CHO, -COOH, -COCOOH, -COOalkyl, -COOAlkphenyl, -COCOOalkyl or B-Y, in which B is alkylene or alkenylene, each of which can optionally be substituted by hydroxyl or alkoxy, and Y is -COOH, -COO-alkyl or -CHO, can be used as synthesis intermediates. In the context of this particular embodiment, preferred radicals B-Y are 2-acetic acid and 3-propionic acid radicals.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can be prepared in the following way (in the schemes the radicals indicated have the previously mentioned meanings, if not stated otherwise; details in brackets serve as illustrative examples). In the reaction schemes, acyl has the meanings indicated above. R is an alkyl radical if not stated otherwise.<br>
The synthesis of sulphoxides and sulphones can be carried out via the reduction of sulphonyl chlorides using base metals, such as iron and zinc, in acidic, aqueous systems to give suitable thiols, which are then first alkylated to give thioethers and then oxidized stepwise using peroxides.<br>
A further possibility for the synthesis of sulphones proceeds via reduction of sulphonyl chlorides with base metals, such as iron and zinc, in neutral, buffered, aqueous systems, or using sulphites, to give sulphinates, which are then alkylated to alkylsulphinates and finally thermally rearranged to give the sulphones.<br><br>
For example, 6-(4-fluorophenyl)-5-methyl-7-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-lH-pyiTolizine, which can be prepared from 2-benzylpyrroline and 2-bromo-l-(4-fluorophenyl)ethanone according to the process described by Laufer et al. ( J. Med. Chem. 1994, 37,1894-1897), can be sulphonated in chlorosulphonic acid and converted to the sulphonyl chloride by means of a suitable chlorinating agent, such as phosphorus pentachloride, but also by means of excess chlorosulphonic acid, preferably in the presence of heat. The sulphonyl chloride is then reduced in an aqueous solution of sodium sulphite and a suitable base, e.g. sodium hydrogencarbonate at elevated temperature, e.g. 70°C. The anion of the sulphinic acid formed, which is in solution, is alkylated in, for example, an ethanolic/aqueous system using an alkyl iodide and the alkyl sulphinite primarily formed is converted into the desired alkylsulphone by heating (e.g. 100°C) for a number of hours (Reaction 1).<br><br>
If necessary, a protective group is first introduced for the extremely reactive position 5 of the starting compound, e.g. 6-(4-fluorophenyl)-7-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-lH-pyrrolizine. Suitable protective groups for reactive positions on pyrroles are carboxylic acid ester groups, which can be prepared almost quantitatively via the reaction of these pyrroles, for example, with phosgene, diphosgene or triphosgene and the subsequent alcoholysis of the carbonyl chlorides formed as intermediates. After introduction of the desired group has taken place, the esters are hydrolysed and the pyrrolecarboxylic acids isolated are thermally decarboxylated to the pjoroles.<br><br>
Advantageously, the aromatics carrying the necessary sulphur functions can be introduced by means of suitable precursors even during the synthesis of the pyrrolizine structure, as a result of which shortening of the synthesis sequence results. For example, the 4-methylsulphanylbenzyl-2-pyrroline (7) necessary for the synthesis of the compound from Example 6 according to the technique outlined is accessible via the Grignard reaction of 4-methylsulphanylbenzyl bromide with magnesium and subsequent addition to 4-chlorobutyronitrile (Reaction 2).<br><br>
Preferably, the preparation of the intermediate 7 is carried out via the condensation of a 4-alkyl-sulphonylphenylacetic acid ester with N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone in the presence of strong bases, e.g. NaH, K tert-butoxide, etc. and subsequent hydrolytic cleavage and decarboxylation of the l-vinyl-3-acyl-2-pyrrolidone formed in high yield as an intermediate (Reaction 3). For example, the reaction of the intermediate 7 with 2-bromo-l-(4-fluorophenyl)ethanone yields the pyrrolizine shown below (Example 6).<br><br>
The necessary starting compounds 4-alkylmercaptophenylacetic acid esters, here methyl 4-methyl-mercaptophenylacetate, can be conveniently prepared starting from thioanisole via Friedel-Crafts<br><br>
acylation with acetyl chloride and Willgerodt-Kindler rearrangement with subsequent hydrolysis and ester formation. The 4-alkylsulphonylphenylacetic acid esters can be obtained in good yields from the 4-alkylmercaptophenylacetic acid esters by peracid oxidation, e.g. using m-chloroperbenzoic acid or H2O2 in glacial acetic acid, and can be condensed analogously to the sulphonyl compound to give a pyrroline 9 and cyclized to the pyrrolizine of Example 7 (Reaction 4).<br><br>
Diarylpyrrolizine compounds according to the invention of the 6,7- (or 1,2-) diaryl series, in which the sulphur function is positioned in the para position on the aromatic to position 6 (or position 2) of the pyrrolizine can also be prepared from the corresponding phenacyl bromides which carry these sulphur functions in the case of the sulphanyl, sulphoxide, and of the sulphonyl and also the sulphamoyl compounds (Reaction 4b).<br>
Thus, for example, the reaction of 2-bromo-l-(4-methylsulphanylphenyl)-l-ethanone with 2-benzyl-1-pyrroline yields the compound of Example 1, with 2-(4-fluorobenzyl)-l-pyrroline that of Example 4, the reaction of 2-bromo-l-(4-methylsulphinylphenyl)-l-ethanone with 2-benzyl-l-pyrroline the compound of Example 2, the reaction of 2-bromo-l-(4-methylsulphonylphenyl)-l-ethanone with 2-benzyl-l-pyrroline that of Example 3, with 2-(4-fluorobenzyl)-l-pyrroline the compound of Examples.<br>
Acyl side chains can also be introduced in position 5 of the pyrrolizine in the said 6,7- (or 1,2) diarylpyrrolizine compounds by acylation in position 5 (or 3) and these can be converted by suitable reduction methods (HI reduction, NaCNBHs reduction, Vitride reduction etc. ) into alkyl side chains.<br><br><br>
5,6- (or 2,3) diarylpyrrolizine compounds and 6,7- (or 2,3) diarylindolizine compounds according to the invention can be prepared in the manner of a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition from corresponding munchnone or sydnone precursor compounds and suitable dienophiles or dipolarophiles. In this case, a sulphur function can be introduced on the one hand via the miinchnone/sydnone component, on the other hand via the dipolarophile component. Dipolarophiles used are dehydrocinnamic acids or other acetylene carboxylic acids, 2-halo-substituted ciimamic acids or 2-haloacrylates and nitrostyrenes. In the pyrrolizine series, N-acyl derivatives of proline (pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid) and in the indolizine series N-acyl derivatives of the homologous piperidine-2-carboxylic acid are employed for sydnone formation.<br>
For example, the cycloaddition of ethyl 2-bromo-3-(4-methylsulphanylphenyl)propenoate (10) to the munchnone of N-(4-fluorobenzoyl)proline (JJ., Reaction 5) produced in situ leads to the ethyl ester of the pyrrolizinecarboxylic acid of Example 11, that of ethyl 2-bromo-3-(4-methylsulphonylphenyl)-propenoate (12) to the ester from Example 12, and the cycloaddition of a 2-(4-methylsulphonyl-phenyl)-l-nitroethene (13) to the same munchnone leads to the pyrrolizine compound from Example 13 A.<br>
By the use of, for example, methyl dehydrocinnamate (14). I-nitrostyrene or N-benzoylproIine (15). unsubstituted 5,6- (or 2,3) diarylpyrrolizine compounds (Reaction 6) are first obtained into which a sulphur function can subsequently be introduced into the para ring position, for example, by chlorosulphonation.<br><br><br><br><br>
This is carried out in analogy to the 6-aryl and 6,7-diaryl compounds according to the techniques mentioned above (see above Reaction 1, Example 7): the reaction with chlorosulphonic acid in excess leads to the sulphonyl chlorides, which on the one hand can be converted into the sulphones by Na2S03 reduction and alkylation with subsequent rearrangement (Reaction 7) and on the other hand can be converted into the sulphonamides according to the invention in aqueous and non-aqueous solutions of ammonia. For example, the reaction of methyl 3-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-phenyl-6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolizin-l-ylcarboxylate with chlorosulphonic acid in excess, both in the cold and in the<br><br>
presence of heat, leads with simultaneous loss of the carboxylic acid ester function to 4-[3-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolizin-2-yl]benzenesulphonyl chloride, which can then be converted into the sulphonamide of Example 10 using ammonia.<br><br>
A suitable alternative for access to 5,6-diaryl-substituted pyrrolizines is especially offered by arylation according to Suzuki if the sulphur-containing aromatic is introduced in position 5.<br>
For example, the reaction of a 6-(4-fluorophenyl)-7-methyl-2,3-dihydro-lH-pyrrolizine, which was obtained from 2-ethyl-l-pyrroline and 2-bromo-l-(4-fluorophenyl)-l-ethanone, with N-bromo-succinimide in THF at low temperatures (-70°C to 25°C) yields a 5-bromo-6-(4-fluorophenyl)-7-methyl-2,3-dihydro-lH-pyrrolizine, which in the presence of tetrakistriphenylphosphinepalladium(0) can be condensed in aqueous/alkaline (e.g. Na2C03/CH2Cl2) medium with 4-methyl-sulphanylphenylboronic acid according to Suzuki to give the methylsulphanyl compound from Example 9 (Reaction 8).<br>
A suitable starting point for the 6-alkyl-7-(4-sulphamoylphenyl)-substituted pyrrolizines is also 7-phenyl-2,3-dihydropyrrolizine, which can be halogenated in position 5 by NBS in THF or can be acylated in position 5 with reaction with acylating compounds such as acid chlorides and acid anhydrides (Reaction 9).<br><br><br><br>
Subsequently, after prior modification ot this introduced acyl tunction (ct. Reaction 9, 20, 21, reduction, condensation etc.), the remaining free pyrrole position (position 6) of the pyrrolizine structure can be acylated again (Reaction 10). As a rule, before introduction of the sulphochloride function, the acyl group is converted into an alkyl group. The Wolff-Kishner or Huang-Minion reaction is suitable for this conversion, or the reaction with sodium cyanoborohydride in the presence of zinc iodide. On the one hand, the sulphochlorides obtained are converted by ammonia into the sulphonamides or, by reaction with sodium sulphite and methyl iodide, into the sulphones (see above Reaction 1).<br><br>
As a starting point for the synthesis of cycloaliphatically substituted pyrrolizines, e.g. of the 6-cyclohexyl derivatives, the acylated cycloaliphatics (e.g. cyclohexyl methyl ketone) can be used. Their bromination also leads to the desired bromoacetyl compounds. The reaction of the 1-acetyl-l-ethoxycarbonylcycloalkyl, e.g. of 1-acetyl-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane, with bromine to give 1-bromoacetyl-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane, which also cyclizes smoothly to give a pyrrolizine with pyrrolines, is more advantageous. Comparably to l-phenyl-6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolizin-3-yl acetic acid in Reaction 9 (preparation of compound 20), the 6-ylacetic acid is also unstable and decarboxylates at elevated temperature (Reaction 11, 24-COOH).<br><br><br>
In this case, the ethoxycarbonyl group functions as a protective group for the branching position in the cycloaliphatic. Finally, the sulphochlorides are also obtained here using chlorosulphonic acid, and on the one hand are converted by ammonia into the sulphonamides (cf. Example 14) or into the sulphones by reaction with sodium sulphite and methyl iodide (Reaction 12).<br><br><br>
The intermediately obtained pyrrolizines, as well as the pyrrolizines carrying sulphur functions, can be converted further in different ways, for example further functional groups can be introduced into the activated positions of the pyrrolizine nucleus, as is carried out in WO 95/23970 and WO 95/23971. The a-positions of the aliphatic fused ring adjacent to the pyrrole nucleus (position 1, or 7) can be flinctionalized by suitable methods: free-radical bromination with N-bromosuccinimide in aprotic solvents yields 1-bromo (or 7-bromo) derivatives, and in aqueous systems and in an excess of the reagent the 1-oxo derivatives of the pyrrolizines.<br>
When using 1 molar equivalent of N-bromosuccinimide, the compound of the formula 25 brominated in the 1-position is obtained (Reaction 13). This in turn can then be reacted with acylates, for example sodium acetate or alkoxides, such as sodium methoxide or sodium ethoxide, to give the corresponding compounds of the formulae 26 and 27 (Reaction 13). The reactions are carried out in a known manner, the reaction with the acylates takes place in an inert solvent, for example dimethylformamide (DMF), at elevated temperature, e.g. 70 to 90°C. The reaction of the compounds of the formula 25 with alkoxides is expediently carried out in the corresponding alcohol. Alternatively, the compounds of the formula 2 (Reaction 13), if desired without being isolated from the reaction mixture, can be reacted directly with an alcohol to give the compounds of the formula 27.<br><br>
Alternatively, a compound of the formula 11 can be reacted with one molar equivalent of NBS in a chlorinated solvent in the presence of water to give a compound of the formula 28. Using a further molar equivalent of NBS, a compound of the formula 29 is then obtained.<br><br>
The introduction of polar groups on the hydrocarbon skeleton of the fused ring, i.e. in the position of the substituents R4-R11, such as hydroxyl groups (Reaction 14, 30), amino groups (Reaction 14, 3Jj Z = NR2), carbonyl (Reaction 14, 32) and carboxyl groups (Reaction 14, 33) presupposes a modified synthesis strategy. Such functional groups can only be indirectly introduced subsequently on the hydrocarbon skeleton of the fused ring. The preparation is carried out by means of suitable precursors which already contain these functional groups, protected by so-called protective groups (= Pg) or can subsequently be converted into the desired group from a suitable precursor group (e.g. 30).<br><br>
Reaction 14 shows an example of how, using the methodology described in EP 0397175, starting here from trishydroxymethylene derivatives (R4 - R6=H, R8 = R9 = H, R7=CH20H) by selective introduction of a protective group for one of the 3 hydroxymethylene groups, compounds of the structure 30 31, 32 and 33 can be obtained which contain the corresponding substitution pattern with functional groups. These compounds (30 31, 32 and 33) occur in the form of two optical antipodes which, if required, are separated by use of chromatographic techniques or are separated using customary purification methods at the stage of diastereomeric synthesis intermediates (acetals or ketals where R=H, R"=alkyl, aryl etc, or R=R"= alkyl, aryl etc.). after their preparation and which yield the pure enantiomers of the precursors after recleavage.<br><br>
In vitro, the compounds according to the invention show a marked inhibition of the release of proinflammatory mediators of the arachidonic acid cascade and thus in vivo antipyretic, analgesic and anti-inflammatory action in inflammation models. The compounds according to the invention inhibit<br><br>
prostaglandin H synthase, the key enzyme of prostaglandin synthesis. In this case, its isoform 2 shows an increased sensitivity to the compounds according to the invention, so that these act as selective inhibitors of isoenzyme- 2. The compounds thus allow a markedly decreased side-effect profile, in particular on the kidney and GI tract, to be expected.<br>
The compounds also exert a weak to medium inhibitory action on 5-lipoxygenase, a further enzyme of arachidonic acid metabolism. Using the inhibitory action on 5-LO, similarly to dual inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-1/2 (COX-l/COX-2) and of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX), the disadvantageous effects of a pure COX-1 inhibition on bronchi (asthma) and GI tract (lesions) can be compensated.<br>
The compounds according to the invention are thus suitable for the treatment of disorders in which increased release rates of the eicosanoid mediators are responsible for the formation or the progressive course of these disorders. In particular, the compounds according to the invention can be used for the treatment of disorders of the rheumatic type and for the prevention of allergically induced disorders. The compounds according to the invention are thus efficacious anti-inflammatories, analgesics, antipyretics, antiallergics and broncholytics or have antibronchoconstrictor activity and can therefore be used for thrombosis prophylaxis and for the prophylaxis of anaphylactic and septic shock as well as for the treatment of dermatological disorders, such as psoriasis, urticaria, acute and chronic exanthema, of allergic and non-allergic genesis.<br>
The compounds according to the invention have increased chemical stability, parenteral administrability, enteral bioavailability and short half-lives.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can either be administered as individual therapeutic active compounds or as mixtures with other therapeutic active compounds: they can be administered as such, but in general they are administered in the form of pharmaceutical compositions, i.e. as mixtures of the active compounds with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, in particular vehicles or diluents and/or additives. The compounds or compositions can be administered enterally, e.g. orally or rectally, or parenterally, e.g. subcutaneously, intravenously or intramuscularly, but they are preferably given in oral dose forms.<br>
The nature of the pharmaceutical composition and of the pharmaceutical carrier or diluent depends on the desired manner of administration. Oral compositions can be present, for example, as tablets or capsules and can contain customary excipients, such as binding agents (e.g. syrup, acacia, gelatin, sorbitol, tragacanth or polyvinylpyrrolidone), fillers (e.g. lactose, sugar, maize starch, calcium phosphate, sorbitol or glycine), lubricants (e.g. magnesium stearate, talc, polyethylene glycol or silica),<br><br>
disintegrating agents (e.g. starch) or wetting agents (e.g. sodium laurylsulphate). Oral liquid preparations can be present in the form of aqueous or oily suspensions, solutions, emulsions, syrups, elixirs or sprays etc. or can be present as dry powders for reconstitution with water or another suitable carrier. Liquid preparations of this type can contain customary additives, for example suspending agents, flavourings, diluents or emulsifiers. For parenteral administration, solutions or suspensions with customary pharmaceutical carriers can be employed.<br>
The use of compounds according to the invention in the course of treatment comprises a process. In this case, an efficacious amount of one or more compounds, as a rule formulated corresponding to pharmaceutical and veterinary practice, is administered to the individual to be treated, preferably a mammal, in particular a human, agricultural animal or pet. Whether such a treatment is indicated and in which form it has to be carried out, depends on the individual case and is subject to medical assessment (diagnosis) which includes present signs, symptoms and/or dysfunctions, risks of developing specific signs, symptoms and/or dysfunctions, and further factors.<br>
As a rule, the treatment is carried out by administration one or more times daily, if appropriate together or alternately with other active compounds or active compound-containing preparations, so that a daily dose of approximately 0.1 mg to approximately 1000 mg and in particular 0.5 mg to approximately 100 mg per kg of body weight is administered to an individual to be treated.<br>

The melting points were determined on a Mettler FP 51 or on a Biichi Melting Point B 545: heating rate 2°C/min, average value (40% threshold) of 3 measurements with a regular melting course (melting course diagram), calibration against vanillin (83.0°C), phenacetin (136.0°C) and caffeine (237°C). The IR spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu IR 470; or FT-IR Nicolet Impact 410, on the latter processed using Omnic (Version 2.1). For this, the substance was compressed in KBr tablets or measured as a film between NaCl plates in transmitted light.<br>
The NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AC 200 (IH: 200 MHz, 13C: 50.3 MHz). For this, 20 - 50 mg of substance, in about 0.5 -1.0 ml of a deuterated solvent which contained 0.1% of tetramethylsilane as an internal standard, were dissolved to give a clear solution. The solution was transferred to a 0.5 cm sample tube in the sample space. For IH-NMR spectra, as a rule 32 FIDs were summed under D-lock for IH-NMR spectra and converted into frequency spectra by the FT process; for the recording of 13C-NMR spectra between 500 and 10 000 FDDs were collected. UV spectra were recorded on a UV Perkin-Elmer 550 SE UVA"IS spectroscope. Measurement was carried out in 1 cm quartz cuvettes in a suitable solvent.<br>
Mass spectra were recorded on a GC-MS system HP-MSD (HP 6890 GC - HP 5973 MSD); after GC separation in a high vacuum (10* Torr) excitation was carried out by EI, at an electron energy of 70 eV.<br>
The determination of volatile and thermostable compounds was carried out by means of GC on GC-MSD. Separation was carried out, if no other details are given, on an HP-5MS column (30 m, 0.25 mm, 5% phenylmethylsilicone, 0.25 |i,m) using helium at a constant flow of 1.2 ml and a split ratio of 50:1 according to the area method of TIC.<br><br>
The determination of poorly volatile and thermolabile compounds was carried out by means of HPLC on a Merck-Hitachi HPLC (L4000 detector, L6200A intelligent pump, D 2500 chromato-integrator) according to the area method; UV absorption measured at the absorption maximum or at 256 nm. The column (if not stated otherwise LiChroCART 125-4; LiChrosphere 100 RP-18; 5 im; from Merck, Darmstadt) was thermostated using a WO Electronics BFO-04 SV column oven (30°C). As a rule separation was carried out using a gradient of a ternary mixture of methanol, acetonitrile and a 5 mmol NaH2P04 buffer which is maintained at a pH of 3.5 using H3PO4, using a flow rate of 1 ml/min after injection of 20 |J,1 of a solution of 30 - 40 mg of the substance to be investigated in 100 ml of MeOH.<br>

Sodium hydride (300 g, 60% strength in white oil, 7.5 mol) is suspended under nitrogen in abs. THF (tetrahydrofuran) (1400 ml) in a 3 1 three-necked flask and the suspension is heated for 30 min, during which the initial evolution of hydrogen subsides. The mixture is allowed to cool to RT (room temperature) and a mixture of ethyl phenylacetate (457 g, 2.78 mol) and l-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone (278 g, 2.5 mol) in THF abs. (400 ml) is then added dropwise via a dropping funnel.<br>
The addition rate is chosen such that the evolution of hydrogen can be kept under control (3.5 h). After complete addition, reflux (66°C, IT (internal temperature)) is maintained for a further 3 h; the mixture is cooled to RT and allowed to stand for 16 h. The excess of sodium hydride is destroyed by cautious addition of a saturated (37% strength) ammonium chloride solution (2 1) to the starting solution. The organic phase is separated in a separating funnel, dried with Na2S04 and the filtrate is concentrated. The white oil depositing as an independent phase is decanted off. An oily residue of 569 g (99.4%) having a purity of 90% GC (gas chromatography) remains: 8-9% of ethyl phenylacetate. The material obtained can be employed in the next step without further purification.<br>

added dropwise, which leads to strong evolution of gas and to the foaming of the mixture. The gases<br>
(HCl, CO, CO2) are led through an absorber. Hydrazine (36.5 ml, 37.5 g, 0.6 mol) is added dropwise<br>
and diethylene glycol (72 ml) is poured in.<br>

The compound of Example 41 is prepared according to analogous procedures. Biological activity<br>
Test system for determining the inhibition of 5-lipoxvgenase<br>
Human granulocytes are used as a source of 5-lipoxygenase. LTB4 (leukotriene B4) is formed from endogenous arachidonic acid by stimulation with calcium ionophore A 23187. The granulocytes are isolated and the enzyme reaction is carried out according to known processes (see Arch. Pharm. 330, 307-312(1997)).<br>
The blood protected from clotting with heparin is centrifuged oyer a discontinuous Percoll®-gradient and the granulocyte layer is pipetted off. After lysis of the erythrocytes, the granulocytes are washed repeatedly and then maintained at a specific cell count. The enzyme reaction is then started with calcium ionophore A 23187 in the presence or absence of the test substance after addition of Ca. The synthesis of the leukotrienes is stopped after 1.5 minutes. The samples are centrifuged off and the supernatant is diluted. LTB4 is determined quantitatiyely by means of ELISA.<br>
Test system for determining the inhibition of cyclooxygenase-1<br>
In this test system, the amount of prostaglandin E2 formed from human platelets after addition of calcium ionophore is determined by means of ELISA. In this process, the platelets are obtained after centrifugation oyer a discontinuous Percoll® gradient. The enzyme reaction and the determination of the metabolites formed is carried out in principle as in the case of the determination of the inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase. Differences exist with respect to the incubation time. Furthermore, the addition of a thromboxane synthase inhibitor is necessary (see Arch. Pharm. Med. Chem. 330, 307 - 312 (1997)).<br>
Test system for determining the inhibition of cyclooxvgenase-2<br>
COX2 (from placenta of sheep) is preincubated at 4°C for 10 min with test substance, then stimulated with arachidonic acid (5 |iM) at 25°C for 10 min. Diclofenac (IC5o(COX2) = 3.0 x 10* M) is used as a reference. The determination is carried out in 3 dilutions (10"", 10"*, 10" M). The PGE2 concentrations are quantified by means of ELISA (see Mitchell J.A, et al. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 90: 11693-11697 (1993)).<br><br><br><br>
