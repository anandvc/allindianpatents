The present invention relates to combinations of phenolic and inorganic compounds which exhibit excellent antimicrobial activity when incorporated into a substrate resin, which mixtures do not exhibit the negative effects associated with the use of either alone. Plastic articles manufactured via a variety of processes from such resins are provided long term antimicrobial activity and exhibit superior resistance to discoloration and maintenance of physical properties, especially upon exposure to ultraviolet radiation.<br>
Triclosan, or Irgaguard®, Ciba Specialty Chemicals, 2,4,4'-trichloro-2'-hydroxydiphenyl ether, is a known antimicrobial for plastics applications. It is known to have high activity against numerous gram-βositive and gram-negative bacterial. It can be incorporated as a neat material or via a masterbatch into a variety of polymer substrates, for example, LDPE, HOPE, MDPE, PP, ABS, SAN, PS, polyacrylates, PMMA, polyamide, polyesters, PVC, latex, PUR, TPU, UP, UP, etc. Irgaguard® exhibits high activity at the surface of plastic articles and the activity remains after repeated washing of plastic articles. Further, Irgaguard® has a good toxicological profile.<br>
Disadvantages of Irgaguard® are that plastic articles formulated with it exhibit strong discoloration upon weathering. For example, polypropylene samples containing Irgaguard® exposed in a Xenon Arc Weather-Ometer at 035 W/m2, 63°C discolor within hours. Further, processing at temperatures greater than 250°C is poblematic due to the volatility of Irgaguard®.<br>
Silver based materials, such as colloidal silver, silver nitrate, silver sulfate, silver chloride, silver complexes and silver ion containing zeolites are known antimicrobial agents for plastic articles. Silver compounds exhibit high activity against microorganisms and they have a good toxicological profile. High processing temperatures are possible with silver compounds (greater than 300°C).<br>
Disadvantages of silver based antimicrobials are that plastic articles containing them often exhibit discloloration upon weathering, and the activity on the surface of the articles is often lost after repeated washing.<br><br>
It has been found, surprisingly, that a combination of certain phenolic compounds with certain inorganic compounds avoids the disadvantages of using either Irgaguard® or silver based antimicrobials alone in plastic articles while providing excellent long-term antimicrobial activity to the articles.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a novel mixture of antimicrobial agents for plastics applications.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide plastic articles or films with antimicrobial activity which also exhibit superior resistance to discoloration, may be processed at high temperatures, and which maintain physical properties upon weathering, especially upon exposure to UV radiation.<br>
The instant invention pertains to a novel mixture of antimicrobial agents for plastics applications which comprises<br>
a)  at least one phenolic antimicrobial compound of the formula (I)<br><br><br>
wherein the ratio of components a): b) is from about 1 : 9 to about 9:1.<br>
Preferred phenolic antimicrobial compounds of component a) are o-benzyl-phenol, 2-benzyl-4-chloro-phenol, 2,4,4'-trichloro-2'-hydroxydiphenyl ether, 4,4'-dichloro-2-hydroxydiphenyl ether, 5-chloro-2-hydroxy-diphenyl-methane, mono-chloro-o-benzyl-phenol, 2,2'-methylene bis-(4-chloro-phenol) and 2,4,6-trichlorophenol.<br>
Most preferred phenolic antimicrobial compounds of component a) are 2,4,4'-trichloro-2'-hydroxydiphenyl ether and 4,4'-dichloro-2-hydroxydiphenyl ether.<br>
Of special interest is a mixture of antimicrobial agents for plastic applications wherein the inorganic antimicrobial compound is a metal-containing zeolite or a surface-modified metal-containing zeolite.<br>
The metal-containing zeolites of component b) are those such as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,775,585, 4,911,898, 4,911,899 and 6,071,542, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference. A zeolite is generally aluminosilicate having a three dimensionally grown skeleton structure and is generally represented by xM2/nO-Al203-ySi02-zH20, written with AI2O3 as a basis, wherein M represents an ion-exchangeable metal ion, which is usually the ion of a monovalent or divalent metal; n corresponds to the valence of the metal; x is a coefficient of the metal oxide; y is a coefficient of silica; and z is the number of water of crystallization. The zeolites of the present invention have a specific surface area of at least 150mVg.<br>
Antibacterial metals for use in metal-containing zeolites include silver, copper, zinc, mercury, tin, lead, bismuth, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, nickel, zirconium, or a combination of two or more of these metals. Preference is given to silver, copper, zinc and zirconium, or a combination of these. Especially preferred metals are silver alone or a combination of silver with copper, zinc or zirconium.<br>
Particularly preferred inorganic antimicrobial compounds of component b) are surface-modified metal-containing zeolites according to U.S. Patent No. 6,071,542.<br><br>
Inorganic antimicrobial compounds of component b) which are of special interest are surface-modified metal-containing zeolites wherein the metal is selected from the group consisting of silver and combinations of silver with copper, zinc or zirconium.<br>
Especially preferred is the antimicrobial mixture wherein component a) is 2,4,4'-trichloro-2'-hydroxydiphenyl ether and wherein the inorganic antimicrobial compound of component b) is a surface-modified silver-containing zeolite. The term -silver-containing- includes the combination of silver with other metals such as zinc, copper and zirconium. BACTEKILLER BM-102GA (Kanebo) is an example of a surface-modified silver-containing zeolite according to U.S. Patent No. 6,071,542.<br>
In addition to zeolites, it is also contemplated that antibacterial metals such as silver, silver compounds and silver complexes may be supported on other inert materials, for example Si02, TiO2 and glass.<br>
The novel antimicrobial mixture of components a) and b) may be incorporated into the plastic resin prior to its being subjected to such manufacturing processes as blown film, rotational molding, fiber spinning, etc. The mixture of components a) and b) is able to withstand demanding processing conditions such as high temperature, e.g. temperatures greater than 200°C.<br>
The plastic films, fibers and articles comprising the present antimicrobial mixture of components a) and b) is suitable for outdoor exposure; they are resistant to weathering and UV light degradation.<br>
The antimicrobial mixture of components a) and b) exhibit good long-term activity and a good toxicological profile.<br>
Triclosan containing plastic samples lead to a strong discoloration within a very short time when exposed to weathering. Plastic samples containing the present combination of components a) and b) exhibit only minimal color changes.<br><br>
Triclosan containing plastic samples exhibit a reduced light stability. Plastic samples containing the present combination of components a) and b) exhibit physical properties that are comparable to a control formulation without antimicrobial agents.<br>
The plastic films, fibers and articles of the present invention are advantageously employed for applications that require long-term hygienic activity on the surface, e.g., medical devices, hand rails, door handles, etc. The antimicrobial plastic films, fibers and articles of the present invention are used for example in hospitals, households, public institutions, ventilation systems, air cleaning and air conditioning systems and waste disposal systems. Plastic articles exposed to outdoor weathering that may have incorporated therein the antimicrobial mixture of the present invention are for example waste containers, swimming pool equipment, outdoor swing set equipment, slides and the like, and stadium seats.<br>
The plastic films, fibers and articles of the present invention exhibit high antimicrobial activity at the surface. The antimicrobial activity remains after repeated washings.<br>
The compositions, plastic films, fibers and articles of the present invention, that is to say, the polymer substrates, may also have incorporated therein one or more of the following known additives:<br>

1. Polymers of monoolefins and diolefins, for example polypropylene, polyisobutylene, po-lybut-1-ene, poly-4-methylpent-1-ene, polyvinylcyclohexane, polyisoprene or polybutadiene, as well as polymers of cycloolefins, for instance of cyclopentene or norbornene, polyethylene (which optionally can be crosslinked), for example high density polyethylene (HOPE), high density and high molecular weight polyethylene (HDPE-HMW), high density and ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (HDPE-UHMW), medium density polyethylene (MDPE), low density polyethylene (LDPE), linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), (VLDPE) and (ULDPE).<br>
Polyolefins, i.e. the polymers of monoolefins exemplified in the preceding paragraph, preferably polyethylene and polypropylene, can be prepared by different, and especially by the following, methods:<br>
a)	radical polymerisation (normally under high pressure and at elevated temperature).<br>
b)	catalytic polymerisation using a catalyst that normally contains one or more than one metal of groups IVb, Vb, VIb or VIII of the Periodic Table. These metals usually<br><br>
have one or more than one ligand, typically oxides, halides, alcoholates, esters, ethers, amines, alkyls, alkenyls and/or aryls that may be either n- or α-coordinated. These metal complexes may be in the free form or fixed on substrates, typically on activated magnesium chloride, titanium(lll) chloride, alumina or silicon oxide. These catalysts may be soluble or insoluble in the polymerisation medium. The catalysts can be used by themselves in the polymerisation or further activators may be used, typically metal alkyls, metal hydrides, metal alkyl halides, metal alkyl oxides or metal alkyloxanes, said metals being elements of groups la, lla and/or Ilia of the Periodic Table. The activators may be modified conveniently with further ester, ether, amine or silyl ether groups.

The instant invention pertains also to an antimicrobial polymer composition comprising<br>
A)	a polymer substrate, and<br>
B)	an effective antimicrobial amount of a mixture of antimicrobial agents as described above.<br>
The effective antimicrobial amount of component (B) is for example 0.005 to 10 %, based on the weight of component (A).<br>
The instant invention also pertains to plastic films, fibers or articles that comprise the novel mixture of components a) and b).<br>
The mixture of components a) and b) is preferably present in the antimicrobial plastic film, fiber or article in an amount of about 0.005 to about 10 % by weight, relative to the plastic material. An amount of from about 0.01 to about 5 % by weight or about 0.05 to about 3 % by weight of the mixture of components a) and b) relative to the plastic material is especially preferred.<br>
The mixture of components a) and b) and optional further additives may be added to the plastic resin, e.g. the polyolefin, individually or mixed with one another. If desired, the individual components of an additive mixture can be mixed with one another in the melt (melt blending) before incorporation into the plastic material.<br>
The incorporation of the mixture of components a) and b) and optional further additives into the plastic material is carried out by known methods such as dry mixing in the form of a<br><br>
powder, or wet mixing in the form of solutions or suspensions. Components a) and b) and optional further additives may be incorporated, for example, before or after molding or also by applying the dissolved or dispersed stabilizer mixture to the plastic material, with or without subsequent evaporation of the solvent. The mixture of components a) and b) and optional further additives can also be added to the plastic material in the form of a masterbatch which contains these components in a concentration of, for example, about 2.5 % to about 70 % by weight; in such operations, the polymer can be used in the form of powder, granules, solutions, suspensions or in the form of latices.<br>

Components a) and b) and optional further additives can also be added before, during or after polymerization or crossiinking.<br>
Components a) and b) and optional further additives can be incorporated into the plastic material in pure form or encapsulated in waxes, oils or polymers.<br>
Components a) and b) and optional further additives can also be sprayed onto the plastic matenal. They are able to dilute other additives (for example the conventional additives in-icated above) or monomers or their melts so that they can be sprayed also together with these additives onto the plastic material. Addition by spraying during the deactivation of the polymerization catalysts is particularly advantageous, it being possible to carry out spraying using, for example, the steam used for deactivation.<br>
In the case of spherically polymerized polyolefins it may, for example, be advantageous to apply components a) and b) and optionally together with other additives, by spraying.<br><br>

The following examples illustrate the invention in more detail. They are not to be construed as limiting the instant invention in any manner whatsoever. The invention is declared to cover all changes and modifications of the specific examples which do not constitute departure from the spirit and scope of the invention. Parts and percentages are by weight.<br>
Example 1: Stabilization of polyethylene.<br>
High density polyethylene, Borealis MS 6591, is dry blended with the antimicrobial agents set forth in Table 1. The levels are percent by weight based on the HOPE. The mixtures are compounded with a twin screw at a maximum temperature of 220°C. The samples are injection molded into 2 mm plaques at a maximum temperature of 220°C. The plaques are subjected to accelerated weathering in a Ci65 Xenon Arc Weather-Ometer at 63°C, 0.35 W/m2 with a spray cycle. Yellowness Index is measured according to ASTM D-1925-77, Low Yl values denote little discoloration, high Yl values severe discoloration of the samples. The results are summarized in Table 1.<br><br><br>
b)	Example of this invention.<br>
c)	Irgaguard® B1000 is 2,4.4'-trichloro-2'-hydroxydiphenyl ether, Ciba Specialty Chemicals.<br>
d)	BM-102GA (Kanebo) is a surface-modified silver-containing zeolite.<br>
It can be seen that the formulations of the present invention, using a combination of antimicrobial agents of components a) and b), provide superior resistance to yellowing upon accelerated weathering.<br>
Example 2: Stabilization of polypropylene.<br>
Polypropylene homopolymer, Montell Profax 6301, is dry blended with the antimicrobial agents set forth in Table 2. The levels are percent by weight based on the polypropylene. The mixtures are additionally formulated with 0.06 % Irgastab® FS-301, 0.06 % Tinuvin® 783 and 0.05 % calcium stearate. The polypropylene samples are spun into fibers at 260°C. The fibers are subjected to accelerated weathering in a Ci65 Xenon Arc Weather-Ometer at 63°C, 0.35 W/m2 with a spray cycle. Yellowness Index is measured according to ASTM D-1925-77. Low Yl values denote little discoloration, high Yl values severe discoloration of the samples. The results are summarized in Table 2.<br><br><br>
It can be seen that the formulations of the present invention, using a combination of antimicrobial agents of components a) and b), provide superior resistance to yellowing upon accelerated weathering.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
