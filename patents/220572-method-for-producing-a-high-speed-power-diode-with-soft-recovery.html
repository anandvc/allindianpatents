				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to the field of power electronics. It relates in particular to a method for producing a high-speed power diode with soft recovery as claimed in the precharacterizing clause of claim 1, and to a power diode.<br>
Particularly with low bias currents and high voltages, an abrupt breakdown in the reverse current, which is referred to as a 'snap off", occurs during the commutation, without any circuitry, of high-speed, optimized-loss and optimized-reliability diodes (that is to say a diode having a semiconductor substrate which is distinguished by the silicon being thin and by a high basic material resistance).<br>
As described in a number of places, such a "snap-off" or such a hard switching response can be shifted by various measures toward higher voltages, which are above the voltages that occur during operation. This is achieved by an axial profile of the carrier life in the component, which is produced, for example, by diffusion of heavy-metal atoms or by ion bombardment (He++ or H+).<br>
For example, US-A-4,140,560 has proposed that a gold concentration with a pronounced concentration gradient be produced in the substrate, leading to soft recovery, by diffusion of gold atoms  into  the  semiconductor substrate of a high-speed diode.<br>
The "snap-off" is also assisted by a short effective charge carrier life,  as is required for large-area<br><br>
diodes 'designed for low dynamic losses. Reducing the switch-off losses by increasing the ion dose in the case of diodes which are bombarded purely by ions is also limited by the high reverse current in the component which results in consequence.<br>
In consequence, neither combined bombardment with ions and electrons nor increase in the ion dose achieves the aim.<br>
According to another known proposal {DE-Al-41 35 258) the semiconductor substrate of a high-speed power diode is subdivided by specific partial treatment (for example bombardment with protons or helium nuclei and electron bombardment) into two separate area elements located alongside one another. The partial diodes formed in this way differ in that one partial diode has soft recovery while the other has a hard "snap off" response. The desired overall diode response is obtained by connecting the two diode elements in parallel.<br>
It has also been proposed (DE-Al-196 09 244) for the two abovementioned diode elements to be designed in such a way that regions are arranged distributed in an area of the semiconductor substrate which is not subjected to bombardment or is subjected to basic bombardment with electrons, in which regions bombardment or additional bombardment has been carried out. A mask in the form of strips is used, for example, to produce the distributed regions. This results in the carrier life having a lateral profile in addition to the axial profile. The combination of the two profiles then leads to the desired diode switching response.<br>
The high-speed power diodes produced using the known methods and with soft recovery admittedly have a better switching response, but have undesirably high reverse currents and reverse losses.<br><br>
The object of the invention is thus to specify a method for producing a high-speed power diode with soft recovery, which leads to components with low reverse losses, and to specify a power diode produced using this method.<br>
The object is achieved by the totality of the features of claims 1 and 8. The essence of the invention is that, after ion bombardment over the entire surface, the component is masked during the subsequent electron bombardment to produce a three-dimensional life distribution. In principle, this results in two diode sub-areas, which can be regarded as parallel-connected diodes with different dynamic and steady-state characteristics. The diode part with a high bombardment dose (ion bombardment + electron bombardment) has a very high conduction resistance and carries virtually no forward current. Accordingly, its proportion of the total storage charge of the diode is low. The other sub-area (the part not subject to electron bombardment) carries virtually the entire forward current and governs the "recovery charge" and recovery response.<br>
Since this greatly reduces the active area, it results in increased current densities with a relatively long carrier life, which leads to correspondingly soft snap-off response. The bombardment with electrons leads to the increase in the reverse current being less than that for pure ion bombardment for a comparable forward voltage drop, so that the reverse losses also remain low. The reduced active area also means that there are sub-areas of the diode which, owing to the additional bombardment, carry no forward current, or only a reduced forward current, and thus produce no switching losses, or only small switching losses, when the diode is being switched off. Thus, overall, the area in which switch-off losses are generated becomes smaller. The heat losses which are produced are, however, dissipated<br><br>
outward distributed over the entire substrate area, as before. This results in a reduction in the thermal resistance Rth being achieved, related to the active area of the diode.<br>
A first preferred refinement of the method according to the invention is distinguished in that a perforated plate, preferably composed of steel or molybdenum, is used for the second, masked bombardment. Such a mask allows the regions of the two diode elements to be distributed optimally,<br>
Further profiling in the lateral direction can be achieved if, according to a second preferred refinement to the invention, a gauze, preferably composed of steel wire, is used for the second, masked bombardment. With an electron acceleration energy of, for example, 2.5 MeV, such a gauze with a wire thickness of 1 mm leads to total shielding at the node points and to partial shielding in the areas which are covered once, which leads to a limited electron penetration depth into the silicon, and thus to an additional defect profile. The bombardment takes place with its full energy in the areas which are not covered, which results in the production of an axially constant defect distribution.<br>
The surface area which is not covered by the mask is preferably between 2 0% and 80%, preferably approximately 50%, of the total area of the mask.<br>
Further embodiments result from the dependent claims.<br>
The invention will be explained in more detail in the following text with reference to exemplary embodiments and in conjunction with the drawing, in which:<br>
Figure 1  shows an example of a "technology curve" (a), with  whose  aid  power  diodes  can  be<br><br>
characterized, with dynamic switching losses (generally Eoff) being plotted against steady-state line losses;<br>
Figure 2  uses Sub-Figures 2A to 2D to show various<br>
steps in production methods according to two preferred exemplary embodiments of the invention;<br>
Figure 3 shows the current distribution in an example of a diode with a 3D life profile according to the invention. Curve (b) is the forward characteristic of the diode element with pure proton bombardment. Curve (c) is the diode element with additional electron bombardment;<br>
Figure 4 shows the recovery of the diode from Figure 3; curve (e) is the current when the diode element with pure proton bombardment is being switched off. Curve (d) is the diode element with additional electron bombardment. Curve (f) is the total current; and<br>
Figure 5  shows  a  simplified  longitudinal  section<br>
through an example of the design of a power diode according to the invention with thermal contact over the entire active and deactivated surface areas.<br>
Power diodes can be characterized by means of a "technology curve", as it is referred to, that is to say dynamic switching losses (generally Eoff or the switch-off energy) are plotted against the steady-state line losses (forward losses). One such technology curve is shown by way of example in Figure 1.<br>
The position of the technology curve in the graph is the result of the choice of the initial silicon material (diameter, thickness and resistivity) for the<br><br>
semiconductor substrate of the diode and the nature of the life distribution. Different technology curves are therefore obtained for different life technologies and different silicon material specifications.<br>
The position of individual components on one of these technology curves is governed by the absolute value of the carrier life for a given technology. In order to shift a component from the area "A" to the area "B" (see Figure 1) on the technology curve for a given diameter and given silicon thickness and silicon resistivity, the carrier life must be reduced further. This can be achieved by (a) increasing the electron bombardment dose or (b) additional heavy-metal diffusion, or (c) additional ion bombardment.<br>
Method (a) leads to a diode with a tendency to hard recovery characteristics when being switched off, while methods (b) and (c) lead, however, to a high leakage current and thus to high reverse losses and, in the worst case, to reverse-operation instability.<br>
The problem can be overcome by the life of a diode whose qualitative switching response is already governed by a laterally homogenous life distribution additionally being laterally structured by means of further masked bombardment, According to the invention, the first distribution is carried out in a manner known per se by ion bombardment so as to produce an axial life profile, and the diode characteristics are located in the area 'A" of Figure 1. Additional lateral structuring results in a diode having a three-dimensional (3D) life profile and electrical characteristics in the area "B" of the technology curve, without significantly influencing the qualitative recovery characteristics or the reverse losses. The diode can in this case be subdivided into two diode elements, in which case the double-bombarded<br><br>
A<br>
part (ion bombardment + electron bombardment) can be regarded as being electrically deactivated.<br>
The 3D life distribution is achieved by masking the component during the electron bombardment. The fundamental method steps are illustrated, for two alternatives, in Figure 2. These steps are based on a (flat) semiconductor substrate 10 in which, using suitable doping methods, a number of layers 11, 12 and 13 of a different conduction type and doping concentration have been produced (Figure 2A). The layer 11 is normally p-doped, the layer 12 n"-doped, and the layer 13 n'^-doped.<br>
An axially  (in the current direction)  varying but laterally (transversely with respect to the current) homogeneous profile of the carrier life is now produced in a first step  (Figure 2B)  in this semiconductor substrate (10) by unmasked ion bombardment 14.<br>
Then, in a subsequent second step (Figure 2C or alternatively Figure 2D), a laterally inhomogeneous life profile is produced by masked electron bombardment 15.,A perforated plate 16 composed of steel or molybdenum may be used, . for example, as the bombardment mask (in the alternative in Figure 2C) . In this case, two diode sub-areas are in principle obtained, which can be regarded as parallel-connected diodes with different dynamic and steady-state characteristics. The diode element having a high bombardment dose (areas which match the holes 17 in the perforated plate 16) has a very high conduction resistance and carries virtually no forward current-Correspondingly, its proportion of the total storage charge of the diode is low. The other sub-area (the part not bombarded with electrons) carries virtually the entire forward current and governs the "recovery charge" and the recovery response.<br><br>
since the active area is thus greatly reduced, this results in increased current densities with a relatively carrier life, which leads to a correspondingly soft snap-off response. The bombardment with electrons leads to less increase in the reverse current than pure ion bombardment for a comparable forward voltage drop, so that the reverse losses also remain low.<br>
Further (lateral) profiling of the life by means of electron bombardment can be achieved by using differently designed masks, such as a gauze 18 composed of steel wires 19, 20 with a defined mesh width (the alternative in Figure 2D). For an electron acceleration energy of, for example, 2.5 MeV, such a gauze 18 with the steel wires 19, 20 having a thickness of 1 mm leads to total shielding at the node points and to partial shielding in the areas which are covered once (by only one of the steel wires 19, 20), which leads to a limited electron penetration depth into the silicon, and thus to an additional defect profile. The bombardment takes place with its full energy in the areas (between the wires 19, 20) which are not covered, which results in the production of an axially constant defect distribution.<br>
The method according to the invention leads to high-speed power diodes whose electrical characteristics are illustrated, by way of example, by the curves for the diode elements in Figures 3 and 4. Figures 3 and 4 in this case show how the current is split between the two diode elements with an area ratio of 1:1 (between regions which are bombarded once and twice) for operation in the forward direction (Figure 3) and while being switched off (Figure 4) for a diode with proton bombardment over the entire surface and with masked, additional electron bombardment. The curve (b) in Figure 3 shows the forward characteristic of the diode element with pure proton bombardment. The curve<br><br>
(c) characterizes the diode element with additional electron bombardment. It can be seen that the forward current of the diode element which has been bombarded with protons and electrons is very much less than the forward current in the diode element which has been bombarded purely with protons.<br>
Curve (e) in Figure 4 shows the current while the diode element which has been bombarded purely with protons is being switched off. Curve (d) the current in the diode element with additional electron bombardment. Curve (f) shows the total current, that is to say the sum of the currents in the two diode elements.<br>
It is self-evident that the diode characteristics can be influenced by the ratio of the sub-areas of the two diode  elements   to  one  another.   For  practical applications, the electrically "deactivated" part (the diode element which has been bombarded with protons and electrodes) can make up 20% to 80% of the total area. The nature and configuration of the mask are determined in a corresponding manner.  The configuration for a diode with  the  above  characteristics  (area  ratio, active  area  to  total  area  of  approximately  1:2) comprises a steel gauze with a wire diameter of 1 mm and a mesh width of 2 mm.<br>
The splitting of the substrate surface into active and deactivated sub-areas also governs the reduction in the thermal resistance Rth/ related to the active area of the diode, of a power diode 26 produced with this semiconductor substrate 10, as is illustrated by way of example in Figure 5. The semiconductor substrate 10 produced using the method according to the invention is in this case arranged between two electrode disks 21, 24 (composed of Cu) which make electrical and thermal contact with the semiconductor substrate 10 over the entire area on both sides - via compensating intermediate  disks  22, 23  (composed  of  Mo) .  The<br><br>
concentric insulating housing is not snown. witnm tne semiconductor substrate 26, there are now distributed surface areas Fl, which belong to the active area of the diode, and surface areas F2 which are electrically-deactivated owing to the second bombardment (only one of these surface areas is in each case shown, by way of example, in Figure 5).<br>
The sub-areas of the diode which carry no forward current or a reduced forward current owing to the additional bombardment produce no switching losses, or only reduced switching losses, when the power diode 2 6 is being switched of f. The total area in which the switch-off losses are generated thus becomes smaller. However, as before, the heat losses which are produced are "distributed" over the entire semiconductor substrate 10 and are passed outward via the intermediate disks 22, 23 and the electrode disks 21, 24. The masked electron bombardment thus reduces the active area in which the switching losses are produced. At the same time, however, the total area for thermal dissipation of the heat which is produced to the exterior remains unchanged. Depending on the surface area which is covered (during the bombardment) this results in a reduction of the thermal resistance Rth related to the active area of the power diode 26.<br><br>
