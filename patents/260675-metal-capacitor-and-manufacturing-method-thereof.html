1.      METAL CAPACITOR AND MANUFACTURING METHOD THEREOF.<br>
(A)	OH, Young Joo<br>
(B)	Republic of Korea<br>
(C)	#1401 Villpolaris, 49-5 Jamwon-dong, Seocho-gu, Seoul 137-906,<br>

The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
1.	Field<br>
The present invention relates to a metal capacitor and a manufacturing method thereof, and more particularly, to a metal capacitor in which an electric conductivity is significantly improved by applying a metal material for an electrolyte and a manufacturing method thereof.<br>
2.	Background<br>
An aluminum electrolytic capacitor is used to smooth a power output from a power circuit to be a predetermined value, or is used as a low frequency bypass. Hereinafter, a method of manufacturing the aluminum electrolytic capacitor will be briefly described.<br>
An etching process of etching the surface of an aluminum foil is performed to enlarge a surface area of the aluminum foil and thereby increase an electric capacity. When the etching process is completed, a forming process of forming a dielectric substance on the aluminum foil is performed. When cathode and anode aluminum foils are manufactured through the etching process and the forming process, a slitting process of cutting the manufactured aluminum foil and a separator by as long as a desired width based on the length of a product is performed. When the slitting process is completed, a stitching process of stitching an aluminum lead patch, which is a lead terminal, to the aluminum foil is performed.<br>
When the slitting of the aluminum foil and the separator is completed, a winding process of disposing the separator between the anode aluminum foil and the cathode aluminum foil, and then winding the separator and the aluminum foils in a cylindrical shape and attaching a tape thereto, so as to not be unwounded. When the winding process is completed, an impregnation process of inserting the wound device into an aluminum case and injecting an electrolyte is performed. When the injecting of the electrolyte is completed, a curing process of sealing the aluminum case using a sealing material is performed. When the<br>
2<br><br>
curling process is completed, an aging process of restoring a damage to the dielectric substance is performed. Through this, the assembly of the aluminum electrolytic capacitor is completed.<br>
Due to advancement in digitalization and slimness of current electronic devices, there is a need for a capacitor having a low impedance in a high frequency. In order to improve the conventional aluminum electrolytic capacitor manufactured as above, a functional layer-type aluminum solid capacitor or a functional tantalum capacitor is used. However, there are problems as follow.<br>
Since the conventional functional layer-type aluminum solid capacitor or the functional tantalum capacitor uses conductive polymer compounds such as polpyrrole or polythiophene, for electrolyte, there are some constraints on the thermal resistance and the withstanding voltage. Also, since a negative electrode is formed by spraying paste such as graphite in turn, the capacitor becomes thicker. Accordingly, there is some constraint on the number of layers and a contact resistance occurs between layers to thereby deteriorate the impedance.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is conceived to solve the above-described problems and thus provides a metal capacitor in which an electric conductivity is improved by about 10,000 to 1,000,000 folds by applying a metal material for an electrolyte, in comparison to when using a conventional electrolyte or an organic semiconductor, a multi-layer metal capacitor using the metal capacitor, and a manufacturing method thereof.<br>
The present invention also provides a metal capacitor which can improve a miniature, a low equivalent series resistance (ESR), a reduction in a ripple pyrexia, a long life, a heat-resistant stability, non-fuming, non-firing, and environment by using a metal material for an electrolyte, and a manufacturing method thereof.<br>
3<br><br><br>

As shown in FIG. 4B, the terminal increase-type metal member 11 includes a groove forming portion I la that is provided by arranging a plurality of grooves lid on its both surfaces, and first and second electrode withdrawing portions 1 lb and 11c formed on one end and another end of the groove forming portion 11a. The terminal increase-type metal member 11 may connect three terminal electrodes by increasing a number of terminals. Each of a plurality of grooves 1 Id that is formed in the groove forming portion 11a is formed in the shape of a circle or a polygon. The terminal increase-type metal member 11 where the groove forming portion 1 la, and the electrode withdrawing portion 1 lb and 1 lc are integrally formed uses any one of aluminum (Al), niobium (Nb), tantalum (Ta), titanium (Ti), and zirconium (Zr).<br>
6<br><br>
The metal oxide layer 12 is formed on the metal member 11, and uses any one of alumina(Al2O3), niobium monoxide(NbO), niobium pentoxide(Nb2O5), tantalum pentoxide(Ta205), titanium dioxide(Ti02) , and zirconium dioxide(Zr02).. The metal oxide layer 12 is formed on both surface (top and bottom) and a side 1 lle of the terminal increase-type metal member 11.<br>
The insulating layer 15 is formed on the terminal increase-type metal member 11 along the side 1 le of the terminal increase-type metal member 11 so that the first and the second electrode withdrawing portion llb and lle of the terminal increase-type metal member may be externally exposed. The insulating layer 15 can be formed after forming a plurality of main electrode layers 14. At this time, the insulating layer 15 is formed on the plurality of main electrode layers 14 and/or the plurality of the main electrode layers 14.<br>
The insulating layer 15 is formed on all the remaining side lie of the terminal increase-type metal member 11, excluding the surface where the first and the second electrode withdrawing portions 1 l l b and 1 l l c of the terminal increase-type metal member 11 is formed.<br>
The plurality of seed electrode layers 13 is formed on the metal oxide layer 12s that are formed on both surfaces of the groove forming portion 1 la of the terminal increase-type metal member 11. The plurality of main electrode layers 14 is formed on the plurality of seed electrode layers formed on both surfaces of the groove forming portion 11a to fill in the plurality of grooves 1 Id formed on the groove forming portion 1 l l a of the metal member 11.<br>
The plurality of conductive connecting layers 16 is formed on the plurality of main electrode layers 14 and the insulating layer 15 to make the first and the second electrode withdrawing portion 1 l l b and 1 lc of the terminal increase-type metal member 11 orthogonal to each other and connect the plurality of main electrode layers 14. In order to connect the plurality of main electrode layers 14, the plurality of conductive connecting layers 16 is<br>
7<br><br>
formed on the plurality of main electrode layers 16 and the insulating layer 15 to make the first and the second electrode withdrawing portions 1 l l b and 1 l l c orthogonal to each other. The first and the second electrode withdrawing portions 1 lb and 1 lc face each other. Each of the plurality of main electrode layers 14 that is electrically connected by the conductive connecting layer 16, the seed electrode layer 13, and the conductive connecting layer 16 uses any one of aluminum (AI), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), silver (Ag), nickel (Ni), tin (Sn), indium (In), palladium (Pd), platinum (Pt), cobalt (Co), ruthenium (Ru), and gold (Au).<br>
The first lead terminal 21 is selectively connected to the first and the second electrode withdrawing portions lib and lie of the terminal increase-type metal member 11. For example, the first lead terminal 21 may be connected to the first electrode withdrawing portion lib of the terminal increase-type metal member 11 or to the second electrode withdrawing portion lie of the terminal increase-type metal member 11. The second lead terminal is connected to the main electrode layer 14 of the terminal increase-type metal member 11. Through this, the non-polar metal capacitor 10 is constructed.<br>
In order to improve the adhesiveness of the second lead terminal 22 connected to one of the main electrode layers 14, a conductive adhesive layer 17 is further provided. The conductive adhesive layer 17 is formed on the main electrode layer 14 connected to the second lead terminal 22 among the plurality of main electrode layers 14. The sealing member 30 seals the terminal increase-type metal member 11 connected to the first and the second lead terminals 21 and 22, so that the first and the second lead terminals 21 and 22 may be externally exposed. The sealing member 30 uses molding material or a cover member with an empty inside.<br>
Hereinafter, a manufacturing method of the metal capacitor 10 according to the first embodiment will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
8<br><br>
When a member 1 such as film, foil, etc., of a metal material is provided as shown in FIGS. 4A and 4B, the manufacturing method of the metal capacitor 10 according to the first embodiment of the present invention forms a pattern (not shown) using a printing ink or physical scratch, or scratches using a nano needle. The manufacturing method forms the groove forming portion 1 la where the plurality of grooves l l d is arranged on both surfaces of the member 1 using a direct current (DC) etching and thereby forms the terminal increase-type metal member 11 integrally formed with the first and the second electrode withdrawing portions 1 l l b and 1 lc on one end and the other end of the groove forming portion l la.<br>
The DC etching performs a pre-processing process for the member 1 in an aqueous solution with about 1% of phosphoric acid in the temperature of about 50 °C during about one minute, and performs first etching in the mixture of sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, aluminum, etc. in the temperature of about 70 °C and 90 °C during about two minutes. In this case, the current density is about 100 mA/cm2 through 400 mA/cm2. The DC etching performs second etching in the mixture of nitric acid, phosphoric acid, aluminum, etc., in the temperature of about 80 °C during ten minutes. In this case, the current density is about 10 mA/cm2 through 100 mA/cm2. When the first etching and the second etching are completed, chemical cleaning is performed in the solution of nitric acid 30 g through 70 g/l in the temperature of about 60 °C through 70 °C during about ten minutes. In case of the etching, etching structures are very simple and uniform and thus applies completely plating up to an inner end of the grooves.<br>
The first and the second electrode withdrawing portions 1 l l b and 1 lc formed on the terminal increase-type metal member 11 are constructed to make the metal capacitor have three terminals when constructing a polar metal capacitor by selectively connecting the first lead terminal 21, and may be constructed to make the metal capacitor have two terminals even when the metal capacitor is non-polar.   The plurality of grooves l l d formed on the<br>
9<br><br>
groove forming portion 1 la of the terminal increase-type metal member 11 is formed in the shape of a circle or a polygon and has a diameter of about 1 urn through 100 urn. When the thickness of the metal member 11 is 1 urn, the depth of the metal member 10 is formed to be less than about 0.5 urn.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4C, when the groove forming portion 11a, and the first and the second electrode withdrawing portions llb and lle are integrally formed on the terminal increase-type metal member 11, the manufacturing method performs a forming process of forming the metal oxide layer 12 on the metal member 11 by using an anodizing method.<br>
The anodizing method initially performs a boiling process in the temperature of about 80°C through 100 °C during one through fifteen minutes in a deionized water, proceeds first oxidation in an aqueous solution of boric acid and boric acid-ammonium with 120 through 150 voltages, and proceeds a plurality of, two or three times of oxidations with changing the concentration and the voltage of the aqueous solution. The anodizing method performs a thermal treatment in the predetermined temperature, for example, in the temperature of 400°C through 600 °C to perform a reforming process. Also, the anodizing method proceeds a by¬product treatment in order to disposal and remove the by-product generated in the reforming process. Also, the anodizing method repeats the reforming process and the thermal treatment and proceeds a predetermined cleaning process in order to clean boric acid or phosphoric acid.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 4D, the manufacturing method forms a non-through type metal member 10a by forming the insulating layer 15 on the plurality of main electrode layers 14 and/or the side 1 le of the terminal increase-type metal member 11 along the side 1 le of the metal member 11 by using a CVD(Chemical Vapor Deposition) method, so that the first and the second electrode withdrawing portion llb and lle of the terminal increase-type metal member 11 may be externally exposed. The insulating layer 15 is formed using an insulating<br>
10<br><br>
tape or a resin material. Although the CVD is used herein, it is possible to apply any one of a dipping process using an insulating resin or insulating ink, a spray process using ink-jet printing or screen printing, and a stamping process.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4E, the manufacturing method forms the plurality of seed electrode layers on the metal oxide layer 12 that is formed in the groove forming portion 1 la to be penetrated into the metal oxide layer 12 by using an electroless plating or an electroplating.<br>
The manufacturing method deposits a predetermined amount of palladium sulfate aqueous solution as an activator during 10 through 300 seconds in the seed electrode layer forming process and removes the activator of surface thereof by dipping and cleaning during one through thirty seconds at the normal temperature. Nickel phosphate aqueous solution applies in the nickel electroless plating and plates during about five through twenty minutes by adjusting pH range (4 through 8 pH) and temperature (50 °C through 80 °C). In this case, the seed electrode layer 13 forms in an inner part of the through-holes lid. An additional plating process and a dry process less than 100 °C may be performed depending on requirement of a user.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4F, when the plurality of seed electrode layers 13 is formed, the manufacturing method forms the plurality of main electrode layers 14 to fill in the plurality of grooves l l d formed in the groove forming portion 11a of the terminal increase-type metal member 11 by using the plurality of seed electrode layers 13 as media, by using the electroless plating or the electroplating.<br>
In the electroplating for forming the main electrode layer 14, the electroplating method adjusts pH range (1 through 5 pH) and temperature (30 °C through 70 °C) and applies D.C(Direct Current) with current density of 20 through 120 mA/cm2 in sulfuric acid nickel aqueous solution or nickel chloride aqueous solution.<br>
11<br><br>
In the electroless plating for forming the main electrode layer 14, the electroless plating method adjusts pH range (5 through 7 pH) and temperature (70 °C through 90 °C) and proceeds'material having seed electrode layer 13 during about ten through thirty minutes and removes plating solution components of surface thereof by dipping and cleaning during one through thirty seconds at the normal temperature.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4G, the manufacturing method forms a conductive connecting layer 16, connecting the plurality of main electrode layers 14, on the side 1 le of terminal increase-type metal member 11 in a direction where the first and the second electrode withdrawing portions 1 lb and 1 lc of the terminal increase-type metal member 11 are orthogonal to each other.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3, when the conductive connecting layer 16 is formed, the manufacturing method connects the second lead terminal 22 to the main electrode layers 14 of the terminal increase-type metal member 11 and selectively connects the first lead terminal 21 to the first and the second electrode withdrawing portions l l b and l l e. For example, when constructing the polar metal capacitor by selectively connecting the second lead terminal 22 to the first and the second electrode withdrawing portions l l b and l l c, it is possible to construct the metal capacitor to have three terminals. Also, when constructing the non-polar metal capacitor, it is possible to construct the metal capacitor to have two terminals.<br>
Between the forming of the conductive connecting layer 16 and the connecting of the first and the second lead terminals 21 and 22, the manufacturing method forms the conductive adhesive layer 17 on the main electrode layer 14 connected to the second lead terminal 22 in order to improve the adhesiveness of the first and the second lead terminals 21 and 22. The conductive adhesive layer 17 is formed by using any one of a method of spraying metal adhesives or solder paste, the electroplating, and the electroless plating.<br>
12<br><br>
As shown in FIG. 3, when the first and the second lead terminals 21 and 22 are connected, the manufacturing method seals the metal member 11 with the sealing member 30 so that the first and the second lead terminals 21 and 22 may be externally exposed. When sealing the terminal increase-type metal member 11 with the sealing member 30, the metal terminal increase-type member 11 is sealed using molding material or a cover member with an empty inside.<br>
(Embodiment 2)<br>
As shown in FIG. 5, the metal capacitor 110 according to the second embodiment of the present invention includes a plurality of non-through type metal members 10a, a conductive adhesive layer 17, a third lead terminal 23, a fourth lead terminal 24, and a sealing member 30. Hereinafter, the configuration thereof will be sequentially described.<br>
Each of the plurality of non-through type metal members 10a includes the terminal increase-type metal member 11, the metal oxide layer 12, the plurality of seed electrode layers 13, the plurality of main electrode layers 14, the insulating layer 15, and the conductive connecting layer 16. However, the seed electrode layers 13 may be removed and not be applied depending on requirement of the user.<br>
The configuration thereof has been described above when describing the metal capacitor 10, and thus further detailed descriptions will be omitted here. The plurality of non-through type metal members 10a is sequentially disposed. The conductive adhesive layer 17 is disposed between the main electrode layers 14 of the plurality of non-through type metal members 10a and thereby adheres the plurality of non-through type metal members 10a.<br>
The third lead terminal 23 is connected to the first electrode withdrawing portions 1 lb of the non-through type metal members 11 that are located in odd number* locations among the plurality of disposed non-through type metal members 10a.   Specifically, as shown in<br>
13<br><br>
FIG. 4, when it is assumed that, among the plurality of disposed non-through type metal members 10a, an uppermost located non-through type metal member 10 is a first non-through type metal member 10a and a non-through type metal member 10 located therebelow is a second non-through type metal member 10a, the third terminal 23 is connected to the first electrode withdrawing portions 1 l b of the non-through type metal members 10a located in the odd number"1 locations such as the first or the third location. Conversely, the fourth terminal 24 is connected to the second electrode withdrawing portions I lc of non-through type metal members 10a that are located in even number"1 locations among the plurality of disposed non-through type metal members. Through this, the non-polar metal capacitor 110 is constructed. Specifically, the third and the fourth lead terminals 23 and 24 are connected to the first and the second electrode withdrawing portions llb and llc of the terminal increase-type metal member 11 formed with the metal oxide layer having the same polarity. Accordingly, the metal capacitor 110 is constructed to have the non-polarity.<br>
The sealing member 30 seals the plurality of non-through type metal members 10a, connected with the third and the fourth lead terminals 23 and 24, so that the third and the fourth lead terminals 23 and 24 may be externally exposed. Through this, the non-polar metal capacitor 110 is constructed to thereby protect the plurality of internally disposed non-through type metal members 10a.<br>
(Embodiment 3)<br>
As shown in FIG. 6, the meal capacitor 120 according to the third embodiment of the present invention includes a plurality of non-through type metal members 10a, a conductive adhesive layer 17, a first polar lead terminal 25, a second polar lead terminal 26, and a third polar lead terminal 27. Hereinafter, the configuration thereof will be sequentially described.<br>
Each of the plurality of non-through type metal members 10a includes the terminal increase-type metal member 11, the metal oxide layer 12, the plurality of seed electrode<br>

thus is used as a cathode node.   Through this, the metal capacitor is constructed to have a polarity.<br>
The terminal increase-type metal member 11 including the first and the second electrode withdrawing portions 1 lb and 1 lc may be applicable to function as the negative electrode. When the terminal increase-type metal member 11 functions as the negative electrode, the main electrode layer 14 functions as the positive electrode. Accordingly, when the second polar lead terminal 26 is applied to the cathode electrode, the first and the third polar lead terminal 25 and 27 are applied to the anode electrode. Conversely, when the second polar lead terminal 26 is applied to the anode electrode, the first and the third polar lead terminal 25 and 27 are applied to the cathode electrode. Also, when the first and the third polar lead terminal 25 and 27 are applied to the cathode electrode, the second polar lead terminal 26 is applied to the anode electrode. Conversely, when the first and the third polar lead terminal 25 and 27 are applied to the anode electrode, the second polar lead terminal 26 is applied to the cathode electrode.<br>
The sealing member 30 seals the plurality of non-through type metal members 10a, connected with the first through third polar lead terminals 25, 26, and 27, so that the first through third polar lead terminals 25, 26, and 27 may be externally exposed. Through this, it is possible to protect the plurality of internally disposed non-through type metal members 110.<br>
As described above, since a non-through type metal capacitor according to the present invention uses a metal material, high voltage is enabled and also it is possible to improve the safety for thermal resistance and environmental influence. Accordingly, since it is not necessary to form a negative pole, the capacitor may be manufactured in slim. Also, since interlayer contact resistance does not occur, the impedance characteristic may be improved.<br>
16<br><br>
According to the present invention, it is possible to improve an electric conductivity by about 10,000 to 1,000,000 folds by applying a metal material for an electrolyte, in comparison to when using a conventional electrolyte or an organic semiconductor. Also, since the serial multi-laying is possible, high-voltage is enabled. Also, a relatively higher electrical safety is provided. It is possible to improve a miniature, a low equivalent series resistance (ESR), a reduction in a ripple pyrexia, a long life, a heat-resistant stability, non-fuming, non-firing, and environment.<br>
