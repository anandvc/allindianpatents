Detailed Description of Certain Embodiments <br>
An exemplary embodiment of an interferometric light modulator comprises a substrate, a first electrode layer over the substrate, a second electrode layer over the substrate, and a conductive<br>
15 	bus layer. At least a portion of the conductive bus layer is electrically coupled to at least one of the first electrode layer and the second electrode layer. The reflective surface moves between the first position and the second position in response to a voltage applied to the conductive bus layer. The conductive bus layer provides an electrical path that has significantly lower electrical resistance than configurations which electrically connect columns of interferometric modulators only through<br>
20 	the first electrode layer or connect rows of interferometric modulators only through the second electrode layer.<br>
The following detailed description is directed to certain specific embodiments of the invention. However, the invention can be embodied in a multitude of different ways. In this description, reference is made to the drawings wherein like parts are designated with like numerals<br>
25 	throughout. As will be apparent from the following description, the invention may be implemented in any device that is configured to display an image, whether in motion (e.g., video) or stationary (e.g., still image), and whether textual or pictorial. More particularly, it is contemplated that the invention may be implemented in or associated with a variety of electronic devices such as, but not limited to, mobile telephones, wireless devices, personal data assistants (PDAs), hand-held or<br>
30 	portable computers, GPS receivers/navigators, cameras, MP3 players, camcorders, game consoles, wrist watches, clocks, calculators, television monitors, flat panel displays, computer monitors, auto displays (e.g., odometer display, etc.), cockpit controls and/or displays, display of camera views (e.g., display of a rear view camera in a vehicle), electronic photographs, electronic billboards or signs, projectors, architectural structures, packaging, and aesthetic structures (e.g., display of<br>
6 <br>
images on a piece of jewelry). MEMS devices of similar structure to those described herein can also be used in non-display applications such as in electronic switching devices.<br>
One interferometric modulator display embodiment comprising an interferometric MEMS       display element is illustrated in Figure 1. In these devices, the pixels are in either a bright or dark <br>
5 	state. In the bright ("on" or "open") state, the display element reflects a large portion of incident visible light to a user. When in the dark ("off' or "closed") state, the display element reflects little incident visible light to the user. Depending on the embodiment, the light reflectance properties of die "on" and "off states may be reversed. MEMS pixels can be configured to reflect predominantly at selected colors, allowing for a color display in addition to black and white.<br>
10	Figure 1 is an isometric view depicting two adjacent pixels in a series of pixels of a visual<br>
display, wherein each pixel comprises a MEMS interferometric modulator. In some embodiments, an interferometric modulator display comprises a row/column array of these interferometric modulators. Each interferometric modulator includes a pair of reflective layers positioned at a variable and controllable distance from each other to form a resonant optical cavity with at least<br>
15 	one variable dimension. In one embodiment, one of the reflective layers may be moved between two positions. In the first position, referred to herein as the released state, the movable layer is positioned at a relatively large distance from a fixed partially reflective layer. In the second position, the movable layer is positioned more closely adjacent to the partially reflective layer. Incident light that reflects from the two layers interferes constructively or destructively depending<br>
20 	on the position of the movable reflective layer, producing either an overall reflective or non-reflective state for each pixel.<br>
The depicted portion of the pixel array in Figure 1 includes two adjacent interferometric modulators 12a and 12b. In the interferometric modulator 12a on the left, a movable and highly reflective layer 14a is illustrated in a released position at a predetermined distance from a fixed<br>
25 	partially reflective layer 16a. In the interferometric modulator 12b on the right, the movable highly reflective layer 14b is illustrated in an actuated position adjacent to die fixed partially reflective layer 16b.<br>
The fixed layers 16a, 16b are electrically conductive, partially transparent and partially reflective, and may be fabricated, for example, by depositing one or more layers each of chromium<br>
30	 and indium-tin-oxide onto a transparent substrate 20. The layers are patterned into parallel strips, and may form row electrodes in a display device as described further below. The movable layers 14a, 14b may be formed as a series of parallel strips of a deposited metal layer or layers (orthogonal to the row electrodes 16a, 16b) deposited on top of posts 18 and an intervening sacrificial material deposited between the posts 18. When the sacrificial material is etched away,<br>
35     the deformable metal layers are separated from the fixed metal layers by a defined air gap 19. A<br>
7<br><br>
highly conductive and reflective material such as aluminum may be used for the deformable layers, and these strips may form column electrodes in a display device.<br>
With no applied voltage, the cavity 19 remains between the layers 14a, 16a and the       deformable layer is in a mechanically relaxed state as illustrated by the pixel 12a in Figure 1.<br>
5 	However, when a potential difference is applied to a selected row and column, the capacitor formed at the intersection of the row and column electrodes at the corresponding pixel becomes charged, and electrostatic forces pull the electrodes together. If the voltage is high enough, the movable layer is deformed and is forced against the fixed layer (a dielectric material which is not illustrated in this Figure may be deposited on the fixed layer to prevent shorting and control the separation<br>
10 	distance) as illustrated by the pixel 12b on the right in Figure 1. The behavior is the same regardless of the polarity of the applied potential difference. In this way, row/column actuation that can control die reflective vs. non-reflective pixel states is analogous in many ways to that used in conventional LCD and other display technologies.<br>
Figures 2 through 5 illustrate one exemplary process and system for using an array of<br>
15 	interferometric modulators in a display application. Figure 2 is a system block diagram illustrating one embodiment of an electronic device that may incorporate aspects of the invention. In the exemplary embodiment, the electronic device includes a processor 21 which may be any general purpose single- or multi-chip microprocessor such as an ARM, Pentium®, Pentium II®, Pentium III®, Pentium IV®, Pentium® Pro, an 8051, a MIPS®, a Power PC®, an ALPHA®, or any special<br>
20 	purpose microprocessor such as a digital signal processor, microcontroller, or a programmable gate array. As is conventional in the art, the processor 21 may be configured to execute one or more software modules. In addition to executing an operating system, the processor may be configured to execute one or more software applications, including a web browser, a telephone application, an email program, or any other software application.<br>
25	In one embodiment, the processor 21 is also configured to communicate with an array<br>
controller 22. In one embodiment, the array controller 22 includes a row driver circuit 24 and a column driver circuit 26 that provide signals to a pixel array 30. The cross section of the array illustrated in Figure 1 is shown by the lines 1-1 in Figure 2. For MEMS interferometric modulators, the row/column actuation protocol may take advantage of a hysteresis property of<br>
30 	these devices illustrated in Figure 3. It may require, for example, a 10 volt potential difference to cause a movable layer to deform from the released state to the actuated state. However, when the voltage is reduced from that value, the movable layer maintains its state as the voltage drops back below 10 volts. In the exemplary embodiment of Figure 3, the movable layer does not release completely until the voltage drops below 2 volts. There is thus a range of voltage, about 3 to 7 V<br>
35      in the example illustrated in Figure 3, where there exists a window of applied voltage within which<br>
8<br><br>
the device is stable in either the released or actuated state. This is referred to herein as the     "hysteresis window" or "stability window." For a display array having the hysteresis characteristics of Figure 3, the row/column actuation protocol can be designed such that during row strobing, pixels in the strobed row that are to be actuated are exposed to a voltage difference of <br>
5 	about 10 volts, and pixels that are to be released are exposed to a voltage difference of close to zero volts. After the strobe, die pixels are exposed to a steady state voltage difference of about 5 volts such that they remain in whatever state the row strobe put them in. After being written, each pixel sees a potential difference within the "stability window" of 3-7 volts in this example. This feature makes the pixel design illustrated in Figure 1 stable under the same applied voltage conditions in<br>
10 	either an actuated or released pre-existing state. Since each pixel of the interferometric modulator, whether in the actuated or released state, is essentially a capacitor formed by the fixed and moving reflective layers, this stable state can be held at a voltage within the hysteresis window with almost no power dissipation. Essentially no current flows into the pixel if the applied potential is fixed.<br>
In typical applications, a display frame may be created by asserting the set of column<br>
15 	electrodes in accordance with the desired set of actuated pixels in the first row. A row pulse is then applied to the row 1 electrode, actuating the pixels corresponding to the asserted column lines. The asserted set of column electrodes is then changed to correspond to the desired set of actuated pixels in the second row. A pulse is then applied to the row 2 electrode, actuating the appropriate pixels in row 2 in accordance with the asserted column electrodes. The row 1 pixels are unaffected by the<br>
20 	row 2 pulse, and remain in the state they were set to during the row 1 pulse. This may be repeated for the entire series of rows in a sequential fashion to produce the frame. Generally, the frames are refreshed and/or updated with new display data by continually repeating dus process at some desired number of frames per second. A wide variety of protocols for driving row and column electrodes of pixel arrays to produce display frames are also well known and may be used in<br>
25     conjunction with the present invention.<br>
Figures 4 and 5 illustrate one possible actuation protocol for creating a display frame on the 3x3 array of Figure 2. Figure 4 illustrates a possible set of column and row voltage levels that may be used for pixels exhibiting the hysteresis curves of Figure 3. In the Figure 4 embodiment, actuating a pixel involves setting die appropriate column to -Vbias, and the appropriate row to +AV,<br>
30 	which may correspond to -5 volts and +5 volts respectively Releasing the pixel is accomplished by setting the appropriate column to +Vbias, and the appropriate row to the same +AV, producing a zero volt potential difference across the pixel. In those rows where the row voltage is held at zero volts, the pixels are stable in whatever state they were originally in, regardless of whether the column is at +Vbias, or -Vbias.<br><br>
Figure 5B is a timing diagram showing a series of row and column signals applied to the<br>
3x3 array of Figure 2 which will result in the display arrangement illustrated in Figure 5 A, where<br>
actuated pixels are non-reflective. Prior to writing the frame illustrated in Figure 5 A, the pixels can<br>
be in any state, and in this example, all the rows are at 0 volts, and all the columns are at +5 volts.<br>
5     With these applied voltages, all pixels are stable in their existing actuated or released states.<br>
In the Figure 5A frame, pixels (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2) and (3,3) are actuated. To accomplish this, during a "line time" for row 1, columns 1 and 2 are set to -5 volts, and column 3 is set to +5 volts. This does not change the state of any pixels, because all the pixels remain in the 3-7 volt stability window.  Row 1 is then strobed with a pulse mat goes from 0, up to 5 volts, and<br>
10 	back to zero. This actuates the (1,1) and (1,2) pixels and releases the (1,3) pixel. No odier pixels in the array are affected. To set row 2 as desired, column 2 is set to -5 volts, and columns 1 and 3 are set to +5 volts. The same strobe applied to row 2 will then actuate pixel (2,2) and release pixels (2,1) and (2,3). Again, no other pixels of the array are affected. Row 3 is similarly set by setting columns 2 and 3 to -5 volts, and column 1 to +5 volts.  The row 3 strobe sets the row 3<br>
15 	pixels as shown in Figure 5 A. After writing the frame, the row potentials are zero, and the column potentials can remain at either +5 or -5 volts, and the display is then stable in the arrangement of Figure 5 A. It will be appreciated that the same procedure can be employed for arrays of dozens or hundreds of rows and columns. It will also be appreciated that the timing, sequence, and levels of voltages used to perform row and column actuation can be varied widely within the general<br>
20 	principles outlined above, and the above example is exemplary only, and any actuation voltage method can be used with the present invention.<br>
The details of the structure of interferometric modulators that operate in accordance with the principles set forth above may vary widely. For example, Figures 6A-6C illustrate three different embodiments of the moving mirror structure.   Figure 6A is a cross section of the<br>
25	 embodiment of Figure 1, where a strip of metal material 14 is deposited on orthogonally extending supports 18. In Figure 6B, the moveable reflective material 14 is attached to supports at the corners only, on tethers 32. In Figure 6C, the moveable reflective material 14 is suspended from a deformable layer 34. This embodiment has benefits because the structural design and materials used for the reflective material 14 can be optimized with respect to the optical properties, and the<br>
30 	structural design and materials used for the deformable layer 34 can be optimized with respect to desired mechanical properties. The production of various types of interferometric devices is described in a variety of published documents, including, for example, U.S. Published Application 2004/0051929. A wide variety of well known techniques may be used to produce the above described structures involving a series of material deposition, patterning, and etching steps.<br>

The response time for discharging and charging an interferometric modulator is dependent in       part on an RC (resistance-capacitance) time constant for the voltage circuit connected to the interferometric modulator. This response time of the interferometric modulator has an effect on the display quality of the interferometric modulator array. When the time between incoming scan <br>
5 	pulses received by a given interferometric modulator is shorter than the response time of the interferometric modulator, the moving layer is unable to synchronize with the incoming scan pulses. Under such conditions, the state of the interferometric modulator does not respond to each and every scan pulse, thereby resulting in a degraded displayed image. It is therefore desirable to provide an interferometric modulator with a reduced response time to allow for faster scan and<br>
10    	 refresh rates.<br>
The voltage circuit connected to an interferometric modulator comprises the electrodes of the interferometric modulator, as well as the contacts, conductors, and other conductive elements which provide electrical connections between the electrodes and the row/column driver electronics. In certain embodiments, the materials and geometries of the electrodes of the interferometic<br>
15		 modulator impact the RC time constant for the voltage circuit. In certain array configurations, the electrodes of adjacent interferometric modulators are coupled together in series to connect adjacent interferometric modulators with the driver electronics, resulting in higher RC time constants. For other array configurations, wires or other electrical connectors may be utilized for the electrical connections between the row and column drivers and the electrodes of the interferometric<br>
20 		modulators, with these wires contributing to the RC time constants of the interferometric modulators.<br>
Figures 7 A, 7B, and 7C schematically illustrate an exemplary 3x3 portion of an interferometric modulator display in accordance with embodiments described herein. Display portions which are larger or smaller than the 3x3 portion illustrated in Figure 7A are also<br>
25 		compatible with embodiments described herein. As shown in the cross-sectional view of Figure 7B, each modulator comprises a substrate 1106, a first electrode layer 902 over the substrate 1106, and a second electrode layer 1302 over the substrate 1106. The modulator further comprises a reflective surface 901 which is substantially parallel to the first electrode layer 902 and is coupled to the second electrode layer 1302. The reflective surface 901 is movable between a first position<br>
30 		and a second position. The first position of the reflective surface 901 is a first distance from the first electrode layer 902. The second position of the reflective surface 901 is a second distance from the first electrode layer 902.<br>
In certain embodiments, as shown in Figure 7B, the first electrode layer 902 of each modulator is fixed, and is positioned in proximity to the substrate 1106. The first electrode layers<br>
35      	902 of the array are arranged in rows.   These rows are not shown in Figure 7 A, but they<br><br>
correspond to the three rows of modulators shown in Figure 7A. The first electrode layers 902 of each row are electrically connected to one another, but are electrically insulated from die first electrode layers 902 of the other rows.<br>
In certain embodiments, die second electrode layer 1302 of each modulator comprises at <br>
5 	least a portion of the moving layer above die first electrode layer 902. In me embodiment schematically illustrated by Figure 7A, die second electrode layer 1302 comprises me whole moving layer. In certain embodiments, the second electrode layers 1302 of die array are patterned so as to separate me second electrode layers 1302 of each column of modulators from the second electrode layers 1302 of adjacent columns of modulators. Thus, die second electrode layers 1302<br>
10 	of the array are arranged in columns. For example, in die embodiment schematically illustrated by Figure 7A, die second electrode layers 1302 have straps or tethers 1300 at me four corners of die second electrode layer 1302 of each modulator. The tethers 1300 mechanically couple die second electrode layers 1302 to die support posts 202 at the corners of the modulators. The tethers 1300 also electrically couple die second electrode layers 1302 of adjacent modulators widen a column,<br>
15 	while the second electrode layers 1302 are electrically insulated from die second electrode layers 1302 of me other columns. other second electrode layers 1302 compatible with embodiments described herein, have spring structures rapier man die tethers 1300 of Figure 7A.<br>
In certain embodiments, as schematically illustrated by Figures 7A and 7B, the reflective surface 901 of each modulator is mechanically coupled to die second electrode layer 1302 of the<br>
20 	corresponding modulator by a support member 1200. Certain other embodiments comprise a plurality of support members which mechanically couple die reflective surface 901 to die second electrode layer 1302. Thus, when the modulator is activated, me reflective surface 901 is moved between die first position and the second position relative to die first electrode layer 902 along a direction 903 substantially perpendicular to die reflective surface 901.<br>
25	In certain embodiments, each modulator of the array further comprises a conductive bus<br>
layer. At least a portion of the conductive bus layer is electrically coupled to at least one of the first electrode layer 902 and die second electrode layer 1302. The reflective surface 901 moves between die first position and die second position in response to a voltage applied to die conductive bus layer.<br>
30	The conductive bus layer 600 of certain embodiments comprises a conductive material,<br>
including but not limited to, metals, composites, and alloys. Exemplary conductive materials for me conductive bus layer 600 include, but are not limited to, titanium, chromium, nickel, and aluminum. In certain embodiments, die thickness of die conductive bus layer 600 is in a range between approximately 0.1 micron and approximately 2 microns measured in a direction that is<br>
12<br><br>
parallel to the direction 903 in Figure 7B. Other thick nesses are also compatible with embodiments described herein.<br>
In certain embodiments, as shown in Figure 7A, the conductive bus layer 600 is positioned above the second electrode layer 1302. The conductive bus layers 600 of the modulators form a <br>
5      	 plurality of conductive bars, which in the exemplary embodiment illustrated in Figure 7 A, are                                            located above the second electrode layers 1302. The conductive bars of each row are electrically connected to one another and electrically insulated from the conductive bars of the other rows. In certain embodiments, each conductive bar provides electrical connections between a row driver and the first electrode layers 902 of a corresponding row of modulators. In certain embodiments, the <br>
10 	width of the conductive bars running along the rows is in a range between approximately 4 microns and approximately 10 microns measured in a direction that is perpendicular to the direction 903 in Figure 7B. Other widths are also compatible with embodiments described herein.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in Figures 7A-7C, the conductive bus layer 600 of<br>
           a modulator is electrically coupled to the first electrode layer 902 of the modulator by a conductive<br>
15     portion of one or more of the support posts 202 of the modulator. The support posts 202 provide<br>
           structural support for the moving layer and the second electrode layer 1302. In certain<br>
         embodiments, the conductive portions of die support posts 202 are electrically coupled to both the<br>
           conductive bus layer 600 and the first electrode layer 902, but are electrically insulated from the<br>
           second electrode layer 1302 by insulating material 603, as shown in Figure 7B.<br>
20	Figure 7C schematically illustrates a support post 202 of the 3x3 portion of the<br>
interferometric modulator display of Figure 7A compatible with embodiments described herein.                   The tethers 1300 are mechanically coupled to the support post 202, but are electrically insulated from the conductive bus layer 600 and from the electrically conductive portion 700 of me support post 200. The electrically conductive portion 700 of the support post 200 electrically couples the <br>
25	 conductive bus layer 600 to the first electrode layer 902. As shown in Figure 7C, the electrically conductive portion 700 of the support post 200 has a generally circular shape, as illustrated by the concentric dashed lines. In certain other embodiments, the conductive portion 700 has other cross-sectional shapes (e.g., square). In certain embodiments, the conductive portion 700 is tubular, cylindrical, or solid. Embodiments of the conductive portion 700 may have a uniform or non-<br>
30     	uniform cross-section between the conductive bus layers 600 and the first electrode layers 902.<br>
Advantageously, for the embodiments schematically illustrated by Figures 7 A, 7B, and 7C,<br>
me conductive bus layer 600 is positioned over the second electrode layer 1302 and away from the<br>
optical path of light entering or being reflected from me interferometric modulator.   Thus, the<br>
conductive bus layer 600 of such embodiments does not interfere with the optical properties of 	the<br>
35     	 interferometric modulator. Furthermore, the conductive bus layer 600 advantageously provides an<br><br>
electrical path between die row driver electronics of the interferometric modulator array and the          first electrode layer 902 which has significantly lower electrical resistance than do other electrical paths of other configurations (e.g., the first electrode layers 902 of a row of interferometric modulators connected in series with one another), thereby advantageously reducing the RC time <br>
5     constant as compared to these other configurations.<br>
The conductive bus layer 600 of certain embodiments is positioned at various locations relative to the other portions of the display of interferometric modulators. In certain embodiments, as schematically illustrated by Figure 7 A, the conductive bus layer 600 is over the second electrode layer 1302.   As described below, in certain other embodiments, the conductive bus layer 600 is<br>
10 	positioned within or adjacent to the first electrode layer 902, or between the first electrode layer 902 and the second electrode layer 1302. The conductive bus layer 600 can also be located below the first electrode layer 902, or in subst antially the same plane as the second electrode layer 1302. Other configurations of the conductive bus layer 600 are also compatible with embodiments described herein.<br>
15	Figure 8A schematically illustrates an exemplary 3x3 portion of an interferometric<br>
modulator display having interferometric modulators in which the conductive bus layer 800 is located above die second electrode layer 1302 and is electrically coupled to die second electrode layer 1302. Figure 8B shows a cross-sectional view of the 3x3 portion of the interferometric modulator display of Figure 8A.  In certain embodiments, as shown in Figure 8A, die conductive<br>
20 	bus layers 800 of a column of modulators of the display are coupled together to form a plurality of conductive bars. The conductive bar of each column electrically connects die second electrode layers 1302 of me column to one anomer, and die conductive bar of each column is electrically insulated from die conductive bars of the other columns.<br>
In certain embodiments, each conductive bar provides electrical connections between a<br>
25	 column driver and die second electrode layers 1302 of die corresponding column of modulators. In certain embodiments, each conductive bus layer 800 is electrically connected to the corresponding second electrode layers 1302 at one or more locations. As illustrated in Figure 8B, the conductive bus layer 800 is connected to the second electrode layer 1302 over die support posts 202. In certain embodiments, the width of die conductive bars running along the columns is in a range<br>
30 	between approximately 4 microns and approximately 10 microns measured in a direction mat is perpendicular to die direction 903 in Figure 8B. Other widths are also compatible widi embodiments described herein. Advantageously, die conductive bus layer 800 provides an electrical path between the column driver electronics of the interferometric modulator array which has significantly lower electrical resistance din do other electrical padis of other configurations<br>
35      (e.g., the second electrode layers 1302 of a column of interferometric modulators connected in<br>
14 <br>
series with one another), thereby advantageously reducing the RC time constant as compared to other configurations.<br>
Figure 9A schematically illustrates an exemplary 3x3 portion of an interferometric modulator display having interferometric modulators in which the conductive bus layer 900 is <br>
5    	located between the first electrode layer 902 and the second electrode layer 1302. Figure 9B            shows a cross-sectional view of the 3x3 portion of the interferometric modulator display of Figure 9A. In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in Figure 9 A, the conductive bus layer 900 is located below the second electrode layer 1302 and is a conductive portion of the support posts 202 . In the embodiment schematically illustrated by Figure 9B, each conductive bus layer 900 is electrically<br>
10 	coupled to each first electrode layer 902 of a row of interferometric modulators and is electrically isolated from the first electrode layers 902 of the other rows of interferometric modulators.<br>
The conductive bus layer 900 of certain such embodiments electrically connects a row driver and the first electrode layers 902 of a corresponding row of interferometric modulators. The row driver selectively applies voltages through the conductive bus layer 900 to the first electrode<br>
15 	layers 902 of the interferometric modulators of a row of the display. The conductive bus layer 900 provides an electrical path that has significantly lower electrical resistance than configurations which electrically connect rows of interferometric modulators only through the first electrode layers 902.<br>
Figure 9C schematically illustrates an exemplary 3x3 portion of an interferometric<br>
20 	modulator display having interferometric modulators with a conductive bus layer 1000 located adjacent to and electrically coupled to the first electrode layers 902 of a corresponding row of interferometric modulators. Figure 9D shows a cross-sectional view of the 3x3 portion of the interferometric modulator display of Figure 9C. The conductive bus layer 1000 of certain such embodiments electrically connects a row driver and the first electrode layers 902 of a corresponding<br>
25	 row of interferometric modulators, thereby providing an electrical path between the row driver and the interferometric modulator that has significantly lower electrical resistance than other configurations which electrically connect rows of interferometric modulators only through the first electrode layers 902. In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in Figure 9D, the conductive bus layer 1000 is positioned between the support posts 202 and near the periphery of an underlying first<br>
30 	electrode layer 902. The conductive bus layer 1000 is electrically coupled to the underlying first electrode layer 902.<br>
The material for the conductive bus layer 1000 is selected to enhance the conductivity across the first electrode layers 902. In certain embodiments, the conductive bus layer 1000 comprises aluminum or other conductive material. Unlike the first electrode layers 902 of certain<br>
35      embodiments, the material selected for the conductive bus layer 1000 may be opaque.  In certain<br><br>
embodiments, the conductive bus layer 1000 has a width in a range between approximately 4 microns and approximately 10 microns measured in a direction that is perpendicular to the direction 903 in Figure 9D.<br>
In certain embodiments, a dielectric layer 906 is located between the conductive bus layer <br>
5 	    1000 and the reflective surface layers 901. The dielectric layer 906 of certain such embodiments  advantageously prevents contact between the conductive bus layer 1000 and the reflective surface layer 901 of the interferometric modulator.<br>
In certain embodiments, locating the conductive bus layer 1000 below the reflective surface layer 901 may adversely impact the optical performance of the interferometric modulator by<br>
10 	blocking at least a portion of the incoming and reflected light of the interferometric modulator. To reduce the visual impact of the conductive bus layer 1000 on the optical performance of the interferometric modulator, conductive bus layers 1000 with smaller widths measured in a direction that is perpendicular to the direction 903 in Figure 9D can be utilized.<br>
Figure 9E shows a cross-sectional view of another embodiment of the 3x3 portion of the<br>
15	 interferometric modulator display of Figure 9C. The interferometric modulators of the display illustrated by Figure 9E have a mask material 1002 generally aligned with the conductive bus layers 1000 of the interferometric modulators and located between the conductive bus layers 1000 and the viewing side of the 3x3 interferometric modulator display. The mask material 1002 is a generally opaque and optically absorbing material with a sufficient width to block incoming light<br>
20	 from impinging onto the conductive bus layers 1000. In the embodiment illustrated in Figure 9E, the mask material 1002 is a generally coplanar in a layer 1004 with an optically transmittive material (e.g., Si02) which transmits incoming light to the modulators and reflected light from the modulators.<br>
Figure 10A schematically illustrates an exemplary 3x3 portion of an interferometric<br>
25	 modulator display having interferometric modulators with a first conductive bus layer 1100 located over the second electrode layer 1302 and a second conductive bus layer 1102 located over the first conductive bus layer 1100. Figure 10B shows a cross-sectional view of the 3x3 interferometric modulator display of Figure 10A. The first conductive bus layer 1100 is electrically coupled through a conductive portion of at least one support post 202 to the first electrode layers 902 of a<br>
30 	row of interferometric modulators. The second conductive bus layer 1102 is electrically coupled to the second electrode layers 1302 of a column of interferometric modulators. The first conductive bus layer 1100 is electrically isolated from the second conductive bus layer 1102 via insulating portions 605 of the support posts 202.<br>
In Figure 10B, the first conductive bus layer 1100 is electrically coupled to the first<br>
35     electrode layer 902 through a conductive portion of one or more support posts 202.  The second<br>
-16 <br>
conductive bus layer 1102 is electrically coupled to the second electrode layer 1302 at locations         over one or more support posts 202.<br>
In certain embodiments, the lower resistance path provided by the conductive bus layers advantageously reduces the RC time constant of the circuit. Exemplary RC times for a plurality of <br>
5 	interferometric modulators having their first electrode layers 902 electrically coupled in series can range from 5 microseconds to 100 microseconds, depending on the number of interferometric modulators. This same plurality of interferometric modulators may have a resistance of as high as 30-50 ohms/square. The use of the conductive bus layers to electrically connect row and column drivers to the corresponding first electrode layers 902 and second electrode layers 1302 of the <br>
10	 plurality of interferometric modulators can reduce the electrical resistance of the circuit, thereby reducing the RC time constant. <br>
Method of Manufacture Conductive Bus over the Mechanical Layer<br>
An exemplary series of processing steps for forming a conductive bus structure located above a second electrode layer 1302 is schematically illustrated in Figures 11(A)-11(Q).  Figure <br>
15    	  11(A) shows the deposit of a black mask 1800 over a substrate 1106. In certain embodiments, the    black mask 1800 comprises molybdenum.<br>
Figure 11(B) shows the black mask 1800 patterned and etched to form islands on top of the<br>
substrate 1106. Figure 11(C) shows the deposit of an oxide layer 1802 over the black mask 1800<br>
and the substrate 1106, and the deposition of a metal layer 904 and a first electrode layer 902 over<br>
20     the oxide layer 1802.   In certain embodiments, the metal layer 904 comprises chromium and the<br>
first electrode layer 902 comprises indium-tin-oxide (ITO).<br>
Figure 11(D) show the first electrode layer 902 and the metal layer 904 being patterned and etched to form electrodes and interferometric modulators compatible with columns, rows, or other useful configurations in accordance with the display design.  In the exemplary embodiment <br>
25      illustrated in Figures 11(A)-11(Q), the first electrode layer 902 is usable as a column electrode.<br>
A dielectric (e.g., silicon oxide) layer 906 is formed over the metal layer 904, the first electrode layer 902, and the oxide layer 1802, as illustrated in Figure 11(D).<br>
Figure 11(E) shows the formation of a sacrificial layer 1804. The sacrificial layer 1804 determines the dimension of the cavity over which the reflective surface 901 is suspended. The <br>
30	 interference properties of the cavities are directly affected by their depth. Certain embodiments having color interferometric modulators construct modulators having cavities of differing depths which provide the resultant quiescent colors of red, green and blue. To produce these varying cavity dimensions, a different thickness of the sacrificial layer 1804 is deposited for each of the different colored interferometric modulators.<br><br>
For example, in certain embodiments, a first sacrificial layer is deposited, masked and patterned, with the first sacrificial layer defining the area of a first modulator. A second sacrificial layer is then be deposited and patterned to define the combined area of the first modulator defined above and a second modulator. The combined thicknesses of the first sacrificial layer and the <br>
5 	second sacrificial layer in the area of the first interferometric modulator is larger than the thickness of the second sacrificial layer in the area of the second interferometric modulator. Subsequently, in certain embodiments, a third sacrificial layer is formed over the second sacrificial layer defining the combined area of the first, second, and third interferometric modulator for each set of colored interferometric modulators. This third sacrificial layer need not be patterned in certain <br>
10 	embodiments, since its thickness will be included in all three of the modulators of the set of colored interferometric modulators.<br>
The three individual sacrificial layers described here may be of different thicknesses. In this way, the first modulator of the set of colored interferometric modulators would have a cavity depth equal to the combined thicknesses of the three sacrificial layers. The second modulator of the <br>
15 	set of colored interferometric modulators would have a cavity depth equal to the combined thicknesses of two of the three sacrificial layers. The third modulator of the set of colored interferometric modulators would have a cavity depth equal to the thickness of one of the three sacrificial layers. When the sacrificial layers are removed, the cavity dimensions will vary according to the various combined thicknesses of the three sacrificial layers, resulting in three <br>
20     different colors such as red, green and blue.<br>
Figure 11(F) illustrates the deposition of a reflective surface layer 1901 over the dielectric layer 906. In Figure 11(G), the reflective surface layer 1901 was patterned and etched to form islands of the reflective surface layer 1901.<br>
Figure 11(H) illustrates the deposition of a sacrificial layer 1810 over the reflective surface <br>
25      	layer 1901 and the dielectric layer 906. In certain embodiments, the sacrificial layer 1810                                comprises molybdenum.<br>
In Figure 11(1) the sacrificial layer 1810 has been patterned and etched to form conductive<br>
bus holes 1812 and reflective surface layer holes 1814.  The conductive bus holes 1812  extend<br>
          through the sacrificial layer 1810 and intervening layers to the first electrode layer 902.   The<br>
30      reflective surface layer holes 1814 extend through the sacrificial layer 1810 to the reflective surface<br>
layer 1901.<br>
In Figure 11(J), a conductive layer 1816 is deposited over the sacrificial layer 1810 and in the conductive bus holes 1812 and the reflective surface layer holes 1814. The conductive layer 1816 is electrically coupled to the first electrode layer 902 through the conductive bus holes 1812.<br>
-18-<br><br>
The conductive layer 1816 is also electrically coupled to the reflective surface layer 1901 through<br>
the reflective surface layer holes 1814.<br>
In Figure 11(K), the conductive layer 1816 is patterned and etched to form a conductive<br>
bus structure 1820 and reflective surface layer connectors 1818.   The reflective surface layer 5     connectors 1818 illustrated in Figure 11(K) are electrically isolated from the conductive bus<br>
structure 1820.<br>
In Figure 11(L), a dielectric layer 1824 is deposited. In Figure 11(M), the dielectric layer<br>
1824 is patterned and etched to remove portions of die dielectric layer 1824 in regions located<br>
between the conductive bus structure 1820 and the reflective surface layer connectors 1818.<br>
10	Figure 11(N) illustrates the deposition of a sacrificial layer 1826.   In Figure 11(0), the<br>
sacrificial layer 1826 is patterned and etched to form landings 1828 for a second electrode layer<br>
1302. In Figure 11(P), the second electrode layer 1302 has been deposited, patterned, and etched.<br>
In Figure  11(Q),  the sacrificial layers  1804,   1810,   1826 are removed,  resulting in the<br>
interferometric modulator having the bus structure 1820.<br>
15	Alone, or in combination with the features described above, the capacitance of the<br>
interferometric modulators can be reduced. Reducing the capacitance of the circuit reduces the RC<br>
time constant.<br>
Refresh Rate<br>
The time required to charge and discharge or change the applied voltage across the first 20     electrode layer 902 and the second electrode layer 1302 affects the refresh rate of the display. For<br>
example, a decrease in the reaction time of the second electrode layer 1302 to changes in the<br>
applied voltage allows the display to refresh in less time. A faster refreshing display can provide a<br>
less noticeable transition between subsequent frames.<br>
Image Resolution<br>
25	In certain embodiments, the use of a conductive bus structure comprising complex routing<br>
lines along the backside of an array of interferometric modulators improves gray scale display<br>
techniques.  Techniques for displaying a gray scale image include the subdividing of pixels into a<br>
plurality of interferometric modules or smaller sub-pixels.   By having more sub-pixels in each<br>
pixel, deeper grayscales can be achieved. However, increasing me number of sub-pixels increases 30     the complexity of the required routing to the row and column drivers located at the perimeter of the<br>
display array.<br>
In certain embodiments, the use of a conductive bus structure improves the gray scale<br>
display. In temporal modulation, each interferometric modulator of a grayscale image is pulsed or<br>
rapidly refreshed so that the viewer perceives the display to be exhibiting variations in intensity 35      level.   In certain embodiments, the refresh or modulation rate of the interferometric modulator is<br><br>
increased with the incorporation of one or more of the modifications described above. The refresh rate can be calculated by the following calculation:<br>
T-line = T-rc + T-interferometric modulator<br>
where T -line is the time to update 1 line;<br>
5	T_rc is the RC time for the line;<br>
T-interferometric modulator is die mechanical response time of the interferometric<br>
modulator.<br>
Then:<br>
T-refresh = n_rows x T_line<br>
10	where T_refresh is the time it takes to update the entire screen;<br>
n-rows is the number of rows on die display<br>
Then:<br>
Screen Refresh Rate = 1 / T-refresh<br>
where Screen Refresh Rate is the update rate of the entire display, typically in Hz. <br>
15		<br>
Thus, as T-rc is decreased with die use of the conductive bus, T_line decreases and<br>
T-refresh decreases.   As T-refresh decreases, die Screen Refresh Rate increases and enhances<br>
temporal modulation.<br>
Referring back to Figures 7A and 7B, die first electrode layer 902 has an intrinsic<br>
20 	conductivity depending on die material selected for die first electrode laya 902. The electrical circuit resistance of the interferometric modulator can be reduced by utilizing a material for the first electrode 902 diet has a higher conductivity. In certain embodiments, the material selected for die first electrode layer 902 comprises zinc tin oxide (ZnTO) which has a higher conductivity as compared to indium tin oxide (ITO).<br>
25	The thickness of die first electrode layer 902 may vary.   In certain embodiments, the<br>
thickness may be between 300 angstroms and 2,000 angstroms measured in a direction diat is parallel to the direction 903 in Figure 7B. Other thicknesses of the first electrode layer 902 may be used.<br>
A material with a low dielectric constant can be selected for die oxide layer or dielectric<br>
30 	material 906 that separates die first electrode layer 902 from die second electrode layer 1302. The dielectric electrically insulates the second electrode layer 1302 from die first electrode layer 902 allowing a charge or voltage to be stored between die first and second electrode layers. The dielectric layer 906 further allows the voltage or charge to form an electro-static force diat acts upon die second electrode layer 1302. A material having a low dielectric constant advantageously<br>
35     reduces the RC time constant of die electrical circuit. For example, a low dielectric constant (K) material can have a lower dielectric constant than a dielectric made from silicon dioxide (3.8). In certain embodiments, die dielectric constant of the dielectric layer 906 is as low as 2.0. Reduce Capacitance<br><br>
          Different and additional materials can be added to reduce the capacitance of the electrical<br>
          circuit.   In certain embodiments, the material selected for the dielectric layer 906 can reduce the<br>
         capacitance of the electrical circuit. These materials include spun-on-glass, SiN, Si02, A102, and<br>
           composites of one or more of these materials.<br>
5	In certain embodiments, a second dielectric layer 104 is provided between the metal layer<br>
904 and the first electrode layer 902. In certain embodiments, as illustrated in Figure 12, the second dielectric layer 104 is located between the metal layer 904 and the first electrode layer 902. This added dielectric layer 104 is in addition to the dielectric or oxide layer 906. In such embodiments, the dielectric layer 104 separates the optical functions of the metal layer 904 from<br>
10 	me electrical functions of the first electrode layer 902. In certain embodiments, this configuration does not adversely impact the image quality of the display.<br>
In certain embodiments of interferometric modulators, the reduction in capacitance due to the addition of the second dielectric layer 104 is a function of the thicknesses of the dielectric layer 906 and the second dielectric layer 104 when the reflective surface 901 is in the 'near' position. In<br>
15 	certain embodiments, the two dielectric layers 906, 104 comprise the same material, while in other embodiments, the two dielectric layers comprise different materials. The capacitance of an interferometric modulator can be approximated by the equation below when the dielectric layer 906 and the second dielectric layer 104 are the same material.<br>
Capacitance ~ (Area of the reflective surface 901) x (Dielectric Constant) x (Permittivity<br>
20     Constant) / (Thickness of Top Dielectric 906 + Thickness of Bottom Dielectric 104).<br>
In certain embodiments, the thickness of the dielectric layer 906 may vary. As illustrated in Figure 13, the dielectric layer 906 comprises one or more air gaps 1900 embedded within the dielectric layer 906.<br>
Figures 14 and 17 illustrate an array of adjacent interferometric modulators 110 arranged<br>
25 	in rows and columns, each having a center portion of the first electrode layer 902 that is electrically isolated from a peripheral portion of the first electrode layer 902. In certain embodiments, cuts in me first electrode layer 902 separate the center portion from me peripheral portion. In certain such embodiments, the area of the portion of the first electrode layer 902 participating in the driving of the interferometric modulator is reduced, thereby reducing the capacitance of the circuit.<br>
30	In certain embodiments, only the peripheral portion contributes to the electrically active<br>
area of the first electrode layer 902. In certain such embodiments, the peripheral portions are electrically connected to a conductive bus structure. In certain other embodiments, only the center portion contributes to me electrically active area of the first electrode layer 902. In certain such embodiments, the center portions are electrically connected to a conductive bus structure. Figures<br>
35      15 and 16 are cross-sections of two adjacent interferometric modulators from Figure 14 having an<br><br>
electrically active center portion 902(a) which is electrically isolated from a peripheral portion 902(b) of both interferometric modulators.<br>
Figure 17 illustrates an array of interferometric modulators 112 arranged in rows and columns, each interferometric modulator 112 having a first electrode layer 902 with a column <br>
5 	portion 902(c) that is electrically isolated from two peripheral portions 902(d), 902(e) of the first electrode layer 902. In certain embodiments, one or more of the peripheral portions 902(c), 902(d), 902(e) contribute to the electrically active area of the first electrode layer 902 and one or more of the peripheral portions 902(c), 902(d), 902(e) do not contribute to the electrically active area of the first electrode layer 902.  Figure 18 is a cross-section view of two interferometric modulators 112<br>
10 	from Figure 17 having electrically active peripheral portions 902(d), 902(e) electrically isolated from non-electrically active column portions 902(c) of both interferometric modulators.<br>
Figures 19 and 20 illustrate an embodiment of an interferometric modulator having a first electrode layer 902 comprising more than two electrically active areas 404(a)-(e). Together, the electrically active areas 404(a)-(e) and the second electrode layer 1302 form an electrostatic force<br>
15 	which pulls die second electrode layer 1302 towards the electrically active areas 404(a)-(e). As the second electrode layer 1302 moves towards the electrically active areas 404(a-(e), the reflective surface 901 moves a corresponding distance relative to the substrate 1106 and the metal layer 904. The movement of the reflective surface 901 turns the interferometric modulator 'ON' or 'OFF' as described above. By decoupling the two functions, the area of the electrically active portion of the<br>
20     optical layer (or of the mechanical layer) can be reduced to be smaller than the area of the optical portion of the optical layer (or of the mechanical layer). Reduce Power Consumption<br>
An additional benefit of reducing die resistance or capacitance of the circuit is a reduction in power consumption.    For example, to charge and discharge an array of interferometric<br>
25	 modulators, die column and row drivers require power to charge and discharge the interferometric modulators. By reducing die capacitance of the individual interferometric modulators, die row and column drivers can apply a lower voltage when activating each interferometric modulator. In certain embodiments, a reduction in the activation voltage is achieved by changing die mechanical stiffness of die interferometric module and/or affecting die strength of die electrostatic force within<br>
30     die interferometric modulator.<br>
For example, geometric changes of die interferometric module can reduce die mechanical stiffness of the second electrode layer 1302. Exemplary geometric changes include increasing the spacing between adjacent support posts 202 or changing the shape of die second electrode layer 1302. In certain embodiments, increasing die nominal spacing between support posts 202 increases<br>
35      die flexibility of die second electrode layer 1302 attached diereto.   This increase in flexibility<br><br>
allows the second electrode layer 1302 and the reflective surface 901 to change states in response to the column or row driver applying a lower activation voltage.<br>
In certain embodiments, as shown in Figure 21, the geometry of the second electrode layer 1302 can be changed so as to simulate a mechanical spring. The mechanical spring design de-<br>
5 	couples the reflective surface 901 from the second electrode layer 1302. Tethers 120 constitute a spring portion while the reflective surface 901 moves up and down. In certain embodiments, the reflective surface 901 comprises a portion of a rigid body, such as a reflective surface layer. In this way, the tethers 120 and reflective surface 901 are decoupled in that movement of one does not substantially affect the other.<br>
10	The selection of the material for the second electrode layer 1302 can affect the activation<br>
voltage. Selecting a more compliant material increases the flexibility of the second electrode layer 1302. In this way, in certain embodiments, the row and column drivers apply a lower activation voltage and still achieve the desired reflective surface layer displacement. In certain embodiments, the second electrode layer 1302 comprises a more compliant material such as aluminum to allow<br>
15 	the reflective surface layer 901 to respond to a lower activation voltage than does a second electrode layer 1302 comprising nickel. Other exemplary materials that could be used for the second electrode layer 1302 include, but are not limited to, Cr, Cu, composites made of oxides and metal (for example, Silicon Nitride encased by aluminum), organic films reinforced by metal (for example, photo resist plated with any of the metal examples).   The mechanical stiffness of the<br>
20 	second electrode layer 1302 can be further decreased by reducing the thickness of the second electrode layer 1302. In certain embodiments, the second electrode layer 1302 has a thickness of about 500 angstroms.<br>
Another technique in certain embodiments for reducing the activation voltage is to change the strength of the electric field created between the first electrode layer 902 and die second<br>
25 	electrode layer 1302. The strength of the electric field is increased by patterning the first electrode layer 902 to reduce the amount of electrically active area. In this way, the area of the interferometric modulator which forms the electrically active portion is reduced. Patterning the electrode by decreasing the electrically active area as illustrated in Figures 14-18 has the effect of increasing the actuation voltage assuming all other parameters are held constant.<br>
30	The activation voltage can be further reduced in certain embodiments by selecting materials<br>
for the one or more dielectric layers 906 that have higher dielectric constants. To first order, the relationship between dielectric constant and actuation voltage is: <br>
V~l/(KAl/2). <br>
The voltage is inversely proportional to the square root of the dielectric constant. Thus, as<br>
35      the constant is increased, it takes less voltage to pull the second electrode layer 1302 towards the<br>
-23<br><br>
first electrode layer 902. Materials with higher dielectric constants increase the resulting electrostatic attraction between the first and second electrode layers.<br>
One possible pixel configuration 602 in accordance with certain embodiments is shown in Figure 22. This view is as seen by the viewer from die front surface of a substrate 106, and is <br>
5	 comprised of nine elements, three for each of the colors red, green and blue. The modulators 1400(a), 1400(b), 1400(c) may correspond to red, 1400(d), 1400(e), 1400(f) to green and 1400(g), 1400(h), 1400(i) to blue, as shown. The array of interferometric modulators in die embodiment schematically illustrated by Figure 22 is arranged in an N x N matrix so as to provide a display surface for an image.<br>
10	The three different colors (red, green, and blue) may be achieved in certain embodiments<br>
by varying die distance between die mirror and the optical stack. When a voltage is applied to the modulators, they may all move a uniform distance towards die electrode or they may all move different distances toward the electrode. Indeed, all nine modulators may traverse die entire cavity and move to a near position that brings diem into direct contact with die substrate 106.   The<br>
15 	dimensions of the cavities in die quiescent state are shown by die vertical dimensions 1500, 1600 and 1700, in Figures 23, 24 and 25, respectively. In one embodiment, die vertical dimensions 1500, 1600, and 1700 are 4000 angstroms, 3000 angstroms, and 2000 angstroms, respectively.<br>
Interferometric modulators are minuscule, typically 25-60 microns on a side (400-1,000 dots per inch).  Therefore, in certain embodiments, many interferometric modulators elements can<br>
20	 be ganged and driven together as a pixel, or sub-pixel in a monochrome, color, or grayscale display. For example, each interferometer modulator can correspond to a single display pixel in a monochrome display. For color or grayscale displays, the color or intensity of each interferometric modulator in certain embodiments is determined by die size of die air gap between the optical and mechanical layers. Multiple sub-elements having different intensities or colors form a grayscale or<br>
25 	color pixel. To create a flat panel display, a large array of interferometric modulators are fabricated in the desired format (for example, 5" full color VGA) and packaged.<br>
The reflective surface 901 of modulator 1400(a) in certain embodiments may have back supports, a flex layer and support post interfaces designed to cause die reflective surface 901 to settle at a distance 1500. The reflective surface 901 of modulator 1400(d) in certain embodiments<br>
30 	may have back supports, a flex layer, and support post interfaces designed to cause die reflective surface layer to settle at a distance 1600 that is less dian distance 1500. Finally, die reflective surface layer 901 of modulator 1400(g) in certain embodiments may have back supports, a flex layer and support post interfaces designed to cause die reflective surface layer to settle at a distance 1700 that is less dian die distance 1600. In this way, controlling die mechanical properties and/or<br>
.24 <br>
the physical restraints of the supports in certain embodiments results in three different cavity dimensions, and thus three different pixel colors are created.<br>
Alternatively, the differing characteristics of the flex layer and supports could be manipulated to cause the reflective surface layer 901 to move different distances upon application <br>
5     		of the same voltage.  As yet another alterative, the modulators could all have the same structures, but differing voltages applied for differing colors.<br>
Figures 26A and 26B are system block diagrams illustrating an embodiment of a display device 2040. The display device 2040 can be, for example, a cellular or mobile telephone. However, the same components of display device 2040 or slight variations thereof are also<br>
10     illustrative of various types of display devices such as televisions and portable media players.<br>
The display device 2040 includes a housing 2041, a display 2030, an antenna 2043, a speaker 2045, an input device 2048, and a microphone 2046. The housing 2041 is generally formed from any of a variety of manufacturing processes as are well known to those of skill in the art, including injection molding, and vacuum forming. In addition, the housing 2041 may be made<br>
15 	from any of a variety of materials, including but not limited to plastic, metal, glass, rubber, and ceramic, or a combination thereof. In one embodiment the housing 2041 includes removable portions (not shown) that may be interchanged with other removable portions of different color, or containing different logos, pictures, or symbols.<br>
The display 2030 of exemplary display device 2040 may be any of a variety of displays,<br>
20 	including a bi-stable display, as described herein. In other embodiments, the display 2030 includes a flat-panel display, such as plasma, EL, OLED, STN LCD, or TFT LCD as described above, or a non-flat-panel display, such as a CRT or other tube device, as is well known to those of skill in the art. However, for purposes of describing the present embodiment, the display 2030 includes an interferometric modulator display, as described herein.<br>
25	The components of one embodiment of exemplary display device 2040 are schematically<br>
illustrated in Figure 26B. The illustrated exemplary display device 2040 includes a housing 2041 and can include additional components at least partially enclosed therein. For example, in one embodiment, the exemplary display device 2040 includes a network interface 2027 that includes an antenna 2043 which is coupled to a transceiver 2047.  The transceiver 2047 is connected to the<br>
30	 processor 2021, which is connected to conditioning hardware 2052. The conditioning hardware 2052 may be configured to condition a signal (e.g. filter a signal). The conditioning hardware 2052 is connected to a speaker 2045 and a microphone 2046. The processor 2021 is also connected to an input device 2048 and a driver controller 2029. The driver controller 2029 is coupled to a frame buffer 2028 and to the array driver 2022, which in turn is coupled to a display array 2030.   A<br>
25 <br>
power supply 2050 provides power to all components as required by the particular exemplary display device 2040 design.<br>
The network interface 2027 includes the antenna 2043 and the transceiver 2047 so that the exemplary display device 2040 can communicate widi one or more devices over a network. In one <br>
5 	embodiment the network interface 2027 may also have some processing capabilities to relieve requirements of the processor 2021. The antenna 2043 is any antenna known to those of skill in the art for transmitting and receiving signals. In one embodiment, the antenna transmits and receives RF signals according to the IEEE 802.11 standard, including IEEE 802.11(a), (b), or (g). In another embodiment, die antenna transmits and receives RF signals according to the BLUETOOTH<br>
10 	standard. In the case of a cellular telephone, the antenna is designed to receive CDMA, GSM, AMPS or other known signals that are used to communicate within a wireless cell phone network. The transceiver 2047 pre-processes the signals received from die antenna 2043 so that they may be received by and further manipulated by the processor 2021. The transceiver 2047 also processes signals received from me processor 2021 so that they may be transmitted from the exemplary<br>
15     display device 2040 via the antenna 2043.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the transceiver 2047 can be replaced by a receiver. In yet another alternative embodiment, network interface 2027 can be replaced by an image source, which can store or generate image data to be sent to the processor 2021. For example, the image source can be a digital video disc (DVD) or a hard-disc drive that contains image data, or a software<br>
20     module that generates image data.<br>
Processor 2021 generally controls the overall operation of the exemplary display device 2040. The processor 2021 receives data, such as compressed image data from the network interface 2027 or an image source, and processes die data into raw image data or into a format that is readily processed into raw image data. The processor 2021 then sends die processed data to the<br>
25 	driver controller 2029 or to frame buffer 2028 for storage. Raw data typically refers to the information that identifies me image characteristics at each location within an image. For example, such image characteristics can include color, saturation, and gray-scale level.<br>
In one embodiment, the processor 2021 includes a microcontroller, CPU, or logic unit to control operation of die exemplary display device 2040.   Conditioning hardware 2052 generally<br>
30	 includes amplifiers and filters for transmitting signals to the speaker 2045, and for receiving signals from the microphone 2046. Conditioning hardware 2052 may be discrete components widen me exemplary display device 2040, or may be incorporated widen me processor 2021 or other components.<br>
The driver controller 2029 takes the raw image data generated by the processor 2021 either<br>
35     directly from die processor 2021 or from die frame buffer 2028 and reformats the raw image data<br>
26 <br>
appropriately for high speed transmission to the array driver 2022. Specifically, the driver controller 2029 reformats the raw image data into a data flow having a raster-like format, such that it has a time order suitable for scanning across the display array 2030. Then the driver controller 2029 sends the formatted information to die array driver 2022. AMiough a driver controller 2029, <br>
5 	such as a LCD controller, is often associated with me system processor 2021 as a stand-alone Integrated Circuit (IC), such controllers may be implemented in many ways. They may be embedded in the processor 2021 as hardware, embedded in the processor 2021 as software, or fully integrated in hardware with the array driver 2022.<br>
Typically, the array driver 2022 receives the formatted information from the driver<br>
10 		controller 2029 and reformats the video data into a parallel set of waveforms that are applied many times per second to the hundreds and sometimes thousands of leads coming from the display's x-y matrix of pixels.<br>
In one embodiment, the driver controller 2029, array driver 2022, and display array 2030 are appropriate for any of the types of displays described herein. For example, in one embodiment,<br>
15 	driver controller 2029 is a conventional display controller or a bi-stable display controller (e.g., an interferometric modulator controller). In another embodiment, array driver 2022 is a conventional driver or a bi-stable display driver (e.g., an interferometric modulator display). In one embodiment, a driver controller 2029 is integrated with the array driver 2022. Such an embodiment is common in highly integrated systems such as cellular phones, watches, and other small area displays. In yet<br>
20 	another embodiment, display array 2030 is a typical display array or a bi-stable display array (e.g., a display including an array of interferometric modulators).<br>
The input device 2048 allows a user to control the operation of the exemplary display device 2040. In one embodiment, input device 2048 includes a keypad, such as a QWERTY keyboard or a telephone keypad, a button, a switch, a touch-sensitive screen, a pressure- or heat-<br>
25 	sensitive membrane. In one embodiment, the microphone 2046 is an input device for the exemplary display device 2040. When the microphone 2046 is used to input data to the device, voice commands may be provided by a user for controlling operations of die exemplary display device 2040.<br>
Power supply 2050 can include a variety of energy storage devices as are well known in<br>
30 	die art. For example, in one embodiment, power supply 2050 is a rechargeable battery, such as a nickel-cadmium battery or a lithium ion battery. In another embodiment, power supply 2050 is a renewable energy source, a capacitor, or a solar cell, including a plastic solar cell, and solar-cell paint. In another embodiment, power supply 2050 is configured to receive power from a wall outlet.<br>

In some implementations control programmability resides, as described above, in a driver<br>
controller which can be located in several places in the electronic display system. In some cases<br>
control programmability resides in the array driver 2022.  Those of skill in the art will recognize<br>
that the above-described optimization may be implemented in any number of hardware and/or<br>
