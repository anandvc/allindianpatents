Specification<br>
Substituted Cycloalkene Derivative<br>
[TECHNICAL FIELD]<br>
The present invention relates to a novel compound which<br>
has an action to suppress intracellular signal transduction or<br>
cell activation in various cells such as monocytes, macrophages<br>
and vascular endothelial cells, the intracellular signal<br>
transduction or cell activation being induced by endotoxin, and<br>
to suppress the generation of inflammatory mediators such as<br>
TNF-a due to the intracellular signal transduction and cell<br>
activation, and which is useful as a prophylactic and/or<br>
therapeutic agent for various diseases such as sepsis (septic<br>
shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation, multiple organ<br>
failure and the like), a production method therefor and a use<br>
thereof.<br>
[BACKGROUND ART]<br>
Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response syndrome<br>
(SIRS) which occurs due to an excess inflammatory response of a<br>
biological body against bacterial infection, and is a disease<br>
which may result in death when it is accompanied by shock or<br>
organ failure. Since there are only a few agents that are<br>
effective against sepsis until now, it is considered to be a<br>
disease that is difficult to prevent and treat. However, since<br>
its fatality is high and the number of patients is large,<br>
development of therapeutic agents for it is particularly<br>
important (for example, refer to Non-patent document 1).<br>
Endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS), which is a membrane<br>
component of bacteria, acts against cells such as monocytes,<br>
macrophages and vascular endothelial cells, induces an excess<br>
generation of various inflammatory mediators such as TNF-a and<br>
the like, causes sudden blood pressure reduction, blood<br>
coagulation disorders, cardiovascular disturbances and the like<br>
in addition to systemic inflammatory responses, and thus<br>
exhibits sepsis (for example, refer to Non-patent document 2).<br><br><br><br>
Lipid A, which corresponds to lipopolysaccharide and its partial<br>
structure, activates intracellular signal transduction via TLR4<br>
(Toll-like receptor 4), which is a functional cell surface<br>
receptor, after binding with CD14 (for example, refer to Non-<br>
patent document 3). Accordingly, lipid A initiates various cell<br>
responses represented by the generation of inflammatory<br>
mediators. Therefore, it is considered that a substance which<br>
suppresses the intracellular signal transduction or cell<br>
activation induced by endotoxin, and various cell responses<br>
induced by intracellular signal transduction and cell<br>
activation, the various cell responses being represented by an<br>
excess generation of inflammatory mediators such as TNF-a, can<br>
be an effective prophylactic and therapeutic agent for sepsis<br>
(for example, refer to Non-patent document 3, Non-patent<br>
document 4, Patent document 1 and Patent document 2).<br>
Intracellular signal transduction or cell activation<br>
induced by endotoxin, and various cell responses induced by the<br>
intracellular signal transduction and cell activation, the<br>
various cell responses being represented by an excess generation<br>
of inflammatory mediators such as TNF-a, lead to development and<br>
progress of various diseases such as ischemic brain disorder,<br>
arteriosclerosis, poor prognosis after coronary angioplasty,<br>
heart failure, diabetes, diabetic complication, joint<br>
inflammation, osteoporosis, osteopenia, autoimmune disease,<br>
tissue disorder and rejection after organ transplantation,<br>
bacterial infection, virus infection, gastritis, pancreatitis,<br>
nephritis, pneumonia, hepatitis and leukemia, in addition to the<br>
aforementioned sepsis (for example, Non-patent document 5 and<br>
Patent document 3).<br>
Therefore, a substance which suppresses intracellular<br>
signal transduction or cell activation induced by endotoxin, and<br>
various cell responses induced by the intracellular signal<br>
transduction and cell activation such as an excess generation of<br>
inflammatory mediators such as TNF-a, is considered to be<br>
effective as a prophylactic and/or therapeutic agent for these<br><br><br>
various diseases, and thus the development of an excellent<br>
therapeutic agent has been desired.<br>

diseases such as sepsis which are associated with intracellular<br>
signal transduction or cell activation induced by endotoxin, and<br>
with cell responses induced by the intracellular signal<br>
transduction and the cell activation, thereby leading to<br>
completion of the present invention.<br>

mediators such as TNF-α, pharmacologically acceptable salts<br>
thereof, a production method therefor, and a medicament<br>
containing the aforementioned substituted cycloalkene derivative<br>
as an active ingredient, which is excellent for prophylaxis<br>
and/or treatment of various diseases caused by intracellular<br>
signal transduction or cell activation induced by endotoxin, and<br>
caused by cell responses including an excess generation of<br>
inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α, the cell responses being<br>

In the reactions of Method A to Method C, in the case<br>
where the compound as the reactive substrate has a group auch as<br>
an amino group, hydroxy group and/or carboxyl group, which<br>
inhibits the intended reaction, these groups may be protected<br><br>
with a protective group as necessary. The protective group of a<br>
group which inhibits the intended reaction is not limited so<br>
long as it is a protective group which is ordinarily used to<br>
conduct the reaction, and may be, for example, a protective<br>
group described in "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd<br>
edition, T. W. Greene &amp; P. G. M. Wuts; John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc."<br>

procedures which are used in the field of synthetic organic<br>
chemistry (for example, the procedure described in the<br>

499 mg (1.53 mmol) of cesium carbonate and 471 mg (1.28 mmol) of<br>
tetrabutylammonium iodide were added thereto, followed by<br>
stirring for 1 hour at room temperature. 0.1 N hydrochloric<br>
acid was added to the reaction solution and the mixture was<br>
extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with<br>
water and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, followed by<br>
concentration under reduced pressure. The residue was subjected<br>
to silica gel column chromatography (solvent; dichloromethane :<br>
methanol = 49:1) to give 833 mg of the title compound as an<br>
amorphous substance (yield: 70%) .<br>
