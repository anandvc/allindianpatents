HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The  following  specification  particularly  describes  the  nature  of  the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
GRANTED<br><br><br>
ORIGINAL<br>
343/MUM/2001<br><br>

Field of the invention	<br>
The present invention relates to a system of packaging of items such as beverages              including tea and coffee as well as substances such as spices and the like which would provide   for   storage/transportation   of   said    items    in   fresh   condition   free   of atmospheric/external contamination and/or deterioration and will also be cost effective vis-a-vis conventional packaging presently in use and to a process for producing such system of packaging of said items.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Certain categories of beverages such as tea and coffee, as well as vegetable substances such as spices are available in plenty only during a'part of the year, that is during their growing cycle. However, these ltems have a constant demand throughout the year. This led to the need for storing these substances by appropriate packaging techniques to ensure that the quality does not degrade during storage.<br>
Over the years, packaging technology has growh' in importance to take care of the aforesaid aspects. This technology embraces a wide span of packaging materials, and methodologies for packing including different operational parameters and conditions.<br>
The presently known packaging techniques for maintaining such beverage and vegetable substances in fresh condition are substantially expensive. Furthermore, such techniques are found to be not so effective in storing the beverage and vegetable substances as it is sometimes found that after a certain period of time degradation in quality of the stored items take place.<br>
Usually such known techniques of packaging involved use of bilayered or multilayered films/packaging material.<br>
WO 922474, discloses a packaging material consisting of an inner polybag and an outer paper casing. The bag had to be filled up with tea at the tea factories. An oxygen<br>
scavenger substance made by the Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company Inc, was used.<br>
&gt;^		_	_	■ *    -<br>
This packaging technique involving several gadgets was found to be both complex and also cost-extensive.<br><br>
WO 0030947 disclosed yet another packaging system using a modified atmosphere obtained of solid carbon dioxide kept on trays used for storing the goods. As the carbon dioxide sublimed, it created the desired modified atmosphere.<br>
According to yet another known packaging technique the beverage/vegetable substance is first packed in laminated foil, and followed by a secondary packaging obtained of corrugated fibre cardboard boxes. Nitrogen is next introduced into the pack through a valve, after vacuumisation. This process obviously is cost extensive involving use of expensive gadgets and materials.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
The basic object of the present invention is to provide a selective system of packaging of articles such as beverage/ vegetable substance, which would on one hand meet.the desired packaging requirement'to maintain the articles packaged in fresh/good condition free of external contamination/deterioration even after substantial period and on the other hand will be cost effective and simple to obtain.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide an improved selective system for packaging using a selective liner material and modified atmosphere for storage of beverages such as tea and coffee and vegetable substances such as spices which would provide for desired storage conditions even after extended storage/transpiration of the article in said packaging.<br>
Another object of the present invention is directed to provide for improvement in selective packaging of articles stored/procured in bags such as teas from the garden which would provide for maintaining the material/tea in fresh conditions even after substantial period of time using simple and cost effective gadgets and material.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a cost effective method for<br>
t&gt;	<br>
obtaining the system of improved selective packaging for beverage/substances like spices which would be simple to carry out and favour packaging of material stored in bags/ sacks and the like.<br>
It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a selective system of packaging and method which would enable storage of material such as tea, beverages even with<br><br>
high moisture content (upto 9%) in fresh conditions free of atmospheric contamination/deterioration for a substantial period.<br>

Stack temperature in the range of 0 to 70°C, preferably 0 to 45°C.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The details of the invention its objects and advantages are explained hereunder in greater detail in relation to the non-limiting exemplary illustrations provided hereunder:<br><br>
EXAMPLE A<br>
In accordance with the desired object of the present invention the same provides for determining the suitable packaging film/laminate that could be used in the system of the invention. For the purpose, various parameters as detailed hereunder of such packaging films were tested using conventional techniques.<br>
I)	Gas permeabilities for various plastic films, low density polyethylene (LDPE),<br>
polyproylene (PP), poly vinyl chloride (PVC), LDPE/PET (PET is poly ethylene terephthalate) were determined using Dow cell apparatus as per the standard ASTM D1434-1982 (3). The results aV,e:illustrated in TABLE-1 here under:<br>
Table 1 : Permeability characteristics of various packaging films, amol/m.s.Pa<br>
(Dow-Cell Method)<br><br>
Material of the film	Film thickness M	Permeability (amol/m.s.Pa) x 103<br><br><br>
	C02	o2	N2<br>
LDPE	150	146	138	25<br>
PP	50	113	34	4<br>
PVC	200	11	15	6<br>
LDPE/PET	37/12	16	9	2<br>
The above data clearly demonstrated that LDPE/PET had low permeability and hence was most suitable.<br>
EXAMPLE B<br>
Based on the above results further tests were carried out to determine the compatibility of LDPE/PET and LDPE/Nylon/LDPE in gases for storage purposes. Following test protocols were followed :<br>
1.	Bags (made from the test material) of 14 x 24 cm are flushed and filled with the test gas of known composition (eg. Nitrogen 99%)<br>
2.	The gas concentration was measured inside the bag after 7 and 14 days.<br><br>
3. Another set was placed at 38°C and 90 + 2% Relative Humidity (RH) (as given in ASTM E 96) in environment test chamber to check the effect of high humidity on permeability characteristics<br>
The permeability results obtained using LDPE/Nylon/LDPE and LDPE/PET liners for oxygen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide as controlled atmosphere gases were noted and the results are illustrated in the following Tables 2, 3 and 4.<br>
Table 2: Oxygen retention (permeability) of chosen films by using the method of Example B<br><br>

14	83.2	82.9	83.9	84<br>
Table 2 shows the oxygen retention data of LDPE/PET and LDPE/Nylon/LDPE by the Method of Example B. The results demonstrate that both the films are able to retain the gas very well. This is found to be selectively advantageous, as 02 will not permeate through the films from the atmosphere into the package.<br>
Table 3 shows the results of nitrogen retention studies on LDPE/PET and LDPE/Nylon/LDPE by the Method of Example B. LDPE/PET was able to retain 97% of N2 at standard and ambient conditions. The performance of LDPE/PET was found to be better than that of LDPE/Nylon/LDPE (the latter was able to retain 92% at standard and ambient conditions). The method of Example B thus confirmed the results obtained by the Dow Cell Method, i.e. LDPE/PET and LDPE/Nylon/LDPE are superior and should be the preferred material for stack dressing. The percentage retention of N2 is altered very little due to change in temperature. This demonstrates the thermal stability of the films in case of temperature cycling.<br><br>

7	98.1	95.9	97.4	96.8<br>
14	91.5	92.3	96.1	95.2<br>
Table 4 shows the carbon dioxide retention data of plastic films by the Method of Example B. LDPE/Nylon/LDPE retains about 84% of C02 at ambient conditions. LDPE/PET has a slightly lower retention capacity for C02, since at the end of 14 days, it is able to retain about 74% in ambient conditions. Therefore, both LDPE/Nylon/DPE and LDPE/PET are inappropriate films for C02 retention.<br>
Table 4 : Carbon Dioxide retention (permeability) of chosen films by using the method of Example B<br><br>
	LDPE/Nylon/LDPE (Film Thickness 105)	L[ (Film T	)PE/PET lickness 50p)<br>

Thus, the above study confirmed the advantage in selective choice of N2 as a gas in Controlled Atmosphere than C02 (as retention of C02 is very low) in the packaging system of the invention.<br><br>
EXAMPLE C<br>
Water Vapour Transmission rates of the various plastic films were further determined. For<br>
the purpose bags of 10 cm by 10 cm size containing silica gel activated at 150°C were<br>
used. Typical conditions were 38°C and 90% relative humidity. Weight gain by bag of<br>
silica gel was measured periodically until the constant weight is reached. After steady<br>
state condition the rate of weight gain directly gave the WVTR of the plastic film. The<br><br>
results are reproduced hereunder in TABLE-5 :<br>
Table 5 : Water Vapour Transmission Rate (WVTR) of various films<br><br>
Plastic material	Thickness	WVTR	Permeability<br>
	Micron	g/day-m2	g.cm/pa.s.m2 x 109<br>
PVC	200	4.43	8.56<br>
LDPE	150	2.61	3.77<br>
PP	50	5.51	2.66<br>
PET+LDPE	50	4.12	1.99<br>
HMHDPE*	50	4.50	2.17<br>
LDPE/Nylon/LDPE 1	105	2.71	2.75<br>
LDPE/Nylon/LDPE 2**	105	0.93	0.94<br>
* HMHDPE: High molecular weight high density polyethylene "Amorphous nylon is used in this material.<br>
The measured WVTRs of various films and calculated permeability values for water vapour illustrate that while the permeability values clearly demonstrate that LDPE/Nylon/LDPE 2 is the best polymer for water retention. LDPE/PET, LDPE/Nylon/LDPE 1 &amp; 2, LDPE/PP show favourable WVTR and permeability characteristics.<br>
Since LDPE, HMHDPE (and other suitable polyethylene grades), PP have the low moisture barrier, these can be used only to sandwich (single layer, double layer or more) the gas impermeable material. Various grades of polyethylene are preferred due to the heat sealability and LDPE is the best.<br><br>
EXAMPLE D<br>
The thus selected packaging film and the controlled atmosphere of Nitrogen gas identified by way of the present invention as-a selective combination for the system for packaging<br><br>
under the present invention the same was used to store package tea and to confirm the characteristics of the tea thus stored ,vis-a-vis tea, Stored in conventional packaging.<br>
For the purpose, twelve auctions purchased jute bags.containing orthodox (FBOP grade, 4 bags) and CTC (PD &amp; BOP grades, 4 bags, each) teas were stored on a plastic pallet kept on a laminated nylon sheet (LDPE/nylon/LDPE, 110 microns). A similar plastic laminate was draped over the stacked bags, and heat-sealed to the bottom plastic sheet. As an alternative, tea bags may be stacked on pallets initially lined with LDPE - Nylon-LDPE of sufficient dimensions. Sealing was done such that at least one nozzle was created in the enclosure so obtained. The enclosure so obtained was flushed with nitrogen gas. Sensors were provided in the enclosure to measure the Relative Humidity and oxygen concentration in the gas phase. Flushing with nitrogen gas was carried out whenever the oxygen concentration rose above 5%. In practice, the concentration of oxygen in the gas space was maintained at 3-4%. One bag each of the three original reserve teas was kept on a nearby bench as control under ambient atmospheric conditions. A record of ambient Relative Humidity and temperature was also maintained. The characteristics of the tea thus packaged in accordance with the system of the invention   vis-a-vis the control package tea was tested as detailed hereunder:<br>
The moisture intake of the stored tea was determined after subjecting to control atmosphere storage vis-a-vis the moisture intake of tea under control packaging and the results are reproduced hereunder in Table 6<br>
Bag-in-stack means that the bags of tea are placed inside a stack envelope having a modified atmosphere. Indirect contact means that the contact of the gas is not directly on to the tea but to tea stored in bags.<br>
In Table 6, TD1 refers to modified atmosphere having 100% C02, 0% Nitrogen and 
 <br>
Table 6 : Moisture pick-up by tea in CA (Bag-in-stack : Indirect contact)<br>
(Initial Moisture Content (MC): 7.10%)<br><br>
Sr. No.	Tea	% Change in Moisture<br>

1.	TC	27	25<br>
2.	TN	25	29<br>
3.	TD1	1.4	1.5<br>
As evident from the above table the moisture pick up by tea in bag in stack there is a maximum increase of 2.3% MC over initial of 7.2'% at the end of 90 days of storage, thus indicating suitability of controlled atmosphere storage which was found to be superior than that of the moisture intake of the controlled tea.<br>
Microbiological Analysis :<br>
The results of microbiological analysis of samples at the end of the storage period were well within the limits.<br>
Chemical Analysis:<br>
Chemical analysis showed that there was a significant decrease in the aflavins (in the leaf) and Brightness (of the end cup) of samples stored in air (TC) for 90 days storage period. Samples stored in the modified atmosphere did not have a significant change in the measured parameters.<br>
The tasters evaluation was carried out and it was found that samples stored in under nitrogen (TD3) indicated no~I5'ss in~Te^CharacteT^(aroTria7flavour/taste") compared to sample stored in air (TC) during storage.<br>
The above results justified the favourable storage cbaracteristicsjof the cost effective system for packaging of the present invention and further studies were carried out to confirm such selective favourable characteristics of the system for packaging of the     present invention as detailed hereunder.<br><br>
EXAMPLE E<br>
Under this exemplary illustration the scaled trials were carried out on a palletized stack for a storage period of 8 months maintained, under the system of the invention and comparative study carried out with control packs of the same tea sample not so<br>
maintained as under the system of the invention. The samples of tea packed comprised<br><br>
FBOP = Flowery Broken Orange Pekoe (Orthodox)<br>
PD      = Pekoe Dust (CTC)    <br>
BOP    = Broken Orange Pekoe (CTC)<br>
The chemical data and tasters data (QDA) is shown in Tables 8 and 9. The moisture pick up and the change of humidity in the stack are given in Tables 10 and 11.<br>

Table 11 : Stack &amp; Ambient Relative Humidity and Moisture Retention in the CA tea<br>
during storage<br><br><br>
As illustrated in the above Tables, in particular for chemical parameter evaluation such as % theaflavins and % brightness for tea exposed to Controlled Atmosphere (CA). there was no significant influence of CA on quality of tea samples exposed to the chosen gas under the system of the invention. Importantly, the samples of BOP, PD and FBOP taken from stack better retained tea character (aroma/flavour/taste) and freshness (aroma/flavour) compared to control till the end of the six month storage period. This is confirmed by the chemical data as well as the tasters evaluation.<br>
The moisture pick up on storage in the samples' packed in accordance with the invention was less as compared to the control as is further revealed by the results noted in Tables 10 and 11 above.<br>
Thus as would be evident from the above disclosure the system for packaging of the present invention while utilizing low cost film/packaging material would provide for storage of substances such as beverages and spices mentioned herein for a substantial period free of atmospheric /external contamination/deterioration. Importantly the system of the invention avoids the need for oxygen scavengers, additional trays for storage, aluminium foil and nylon based liners all of which are expensive and lead to cost extensive packaging.
