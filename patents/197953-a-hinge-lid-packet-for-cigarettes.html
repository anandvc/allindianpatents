				<td>Hinge-lid Packet for Cigarettes<br>
Specification<br>
The invention relates to a huge-lid packet for cigarettes with a packet portion for receiving a block of cigarettes, a lid hinged to a rear wall of the packet portion and a collar connected to the packet portion and consisting of collar front wall and Lola side walls.<br>
Hinge-lid packets are a widespread type of packaging for cigarettes.  The hinge-lid packet consists of a packet portion and a lid disposed on a rear wall of the packet portion so as to be able to be swung back.  A collar is erring-. need on the packet portion.  The collar has a collar runt wall and collar side walls.  The collar protrui in an upper section from the packet portion.  The reed portion of the collar is surrounded by the lid when the hinge-lid packet is in the closed position.  The collar can be both part of a one-piece<br><br>
Blank for manufacturing the hinge-lid packet and manufactured from a separate blank.  The packet contents, namely a group of cigarettes, is surrounded by an inner wrapping of tinfoil or the like and thus forms a block of cigarettes.<br>
The problem underlying the invention is to improve a hinge-lid packet of the design described above so that additional functions, such as conveying additional information, can be realized.<br>
To solve this problem, the hinge-lid packet according to the invocation is characterised in that recesses are arranged ire the region of the packet portion and/or of the lid and are closed on the side pointing towards the block of covariates.  The recesses are associated with walls of the packet portion and/or of the lid.  The recesses are preferably closed by regions of the packet portion and/or lid and/or collar.  In the region of the recesses, the regions of the packet portion and/or lid and/or collar carry an imprint.  This can be advertising information, a coupon or a two-dimensional graphic design.<br>
According t': an advantageous development of the invention, ie or each recess is closed towards the outside by, covering which may be detached from the packet portion or lid.  When the covering has been<br><br>
Detached by the consumer, the information lying under the covering-: is revealed.<br>
Preferred developments arise from the secondary claims and the description.  Embodiments of the invention, given by way, of example, are explained in greater detail with the aid of the drawings.  This show:<br>

Fig. 4    a spread-out blank for the hinge-lid packet according to Fig. 2 in a view analogous to 3,<br>
Fig. 5   a spread-out blank for a collar for the<br>
Hinge-lid packets according to Figs. 1 and 2, ii! Plan view, and<br>
Fig. 6   a cross-section through the hinge-lid packets according to Figs. 1 and 2.<br><br>
The embodiments represented here show hinge-lid packets for cigarettes. A group of cigarettes is surrounded as the packet contents by an inner wrapping made of paper or tin foil and thus forms a block of cigarettes. Since the hinge-lid packets have a largely identical structure, the same reference numbers are used below for the seine elements.<br>
The hinge-lid packets 10, 11 consist in each case of a packet ponion 12 and a lid 13.  The packet portions i2 comprise a front wall 14, rear wall 15, side walls 16, 17 and a bees wall 18.  The side walls 16, 17 are in each case I formed from inner side flaps 19, 20 and outer side flaps 21,   22 of a one-piece blank 23 or 24 to form the packet portion 12 and lid 13 of the hinge-lid packet 10 c: 11.<br>
The lids I consist in each case of lid front wall 25, lid rear wall 26, lid side walls 27, 28 and a lid upper wall 29.  The lid side walls 27, 28 are, jus^fc like the side walls: .6, 17, formed by overlapping inner lid side flaps 30,r. as well as outer lid side flaps 32, 33.<br>
The respect lids 13 are hinged in the region of the lid rear We.1.1 26 to the rear wall 15 of the packet portion 12: n each case via a hinge line 34.<br>
In the packet portion 12 of the hinge-lid packets 10, 11, there sits in each case a collar 35 with collar<br><br>
Front wall 36 and collar side walls 37, 38.  The collar front wall 36 is connected to the front wall 14 of the packet portion 12 especially by gluing.  The collar side walls 37, 38 are adjacent to the inner side of the side walls 16, 17 or the inner side flaps 19, 20 and are likewise,-e connected to same by gluing.<br>
Furthermore, corner flaps are of importance for the hinge-lid packets 10, 11.  These are base corner flaps 39, 40 on: he one hand and lid corner flaps 41, 42 on the other hand.  The base corner flaps 39, 40 are connected to the adjacent side flaps 19, 20 lying on the inside, and the lid corner flaps 41, 42 to the lid side flaps 30, 31 lying on the inside.<br>
In addition, a lid inner flap 43, which adjoins the lid front wall 25, forms in each case part of the hinge-lid packets 10, 11 or blanks 23, 24.  When the hinge-lid packet 10, II is completely folded, the lid inner flap 43 is folded round against an inner side of the lid front wall 25.<br>
Fig. 6 shove’s the cigarettes 44 received by the hinge-lid packets 10, 11.  The block 45 formed by the cigarettes 44 is indicated in Figs. 1 and 2 by dot-dash lines.<br>
The special characteristic of the hinge-lid packet 10 according to Fig. 1 consists in the fact that it has<br><br>
recesses 46, 47 in the region of a wall of the packet portion 11, namely the front wall 14, on the one hand, and. in the region of a wall of the lid 13, namely the lid front wall 25, on the other hand.  The recesses 46, 47 of the binge-lid packet 10 are stamped out of front wall 14 a lid front wall 25.  Continuous stamping lines 48, 4-' accordingly delimit the recesses 46, 47 from front './all 14 and lid front wall 25.<br>
The recessed• 46, 47 of the hinge-lid packet 10 according t'. Fig. 1 are open towards the outside and closed on the side pointing towards the block of cigarettes 45.  In the embodiment shown here, the recess 46 in the region of the front wall 14 on the side pointer’s towards the block of cigarettes 45 is closed by a region of the collar 35, namely the collar front wall 36.  The recess 47 in the region of the lid front wall £5, on the other hand, is closed by a region of the lid 13, namely of the lid inner flap 43, on the side pointing towards the block of cigarettes 45.<br>
In regions 5:0 or 51, in which the collar front wall 36 or lid nine flap 43 overlaps the recesses 46 or 47, said collar front wall 36 or lid inner flap 43 serves as a carrier for an imprint.  Regions 50, 51 of collar front wall 3 5 and lid inner flap 43 are delimited by dot-dash lions in Figs, 3, 5.  The imprint in regions 50, 51 of cellar front wall 36 and lid inner flap 43 is for example, a coupon composed of words and/or<br><br>
pictures.  This can be a coupon, an entitlement voucher for participating in competitions, prize draws or the like.  To: his end, the collar 35 or collar front wall 36 must be printed on its front side.  The lid inner flap 43, o;;. The other hand has to be printed on its rear side.  This follows from the circumstance that, on the completely folded hinge-lid packets, the lid inner flap comes into contact with the lid front wall 25 by being folded round.<br>
On the emb'Jdiment shown here, recess 46 is formed with a comparat.vely large surface in the region of the front wall 14 of the packet portion 12.  As a result of this, the ::ollar 35 accordingly has a greater depth than on traditional hinge-lid packets.  In the embodiment shown here, the collar 35, namely its front wall 36, ire; extended almost into the region of the base wall 18.  Iloreover, the lid inner flap 43 extends over the full height of the lid front wall 36.<br>
Hinge-lid fiacket 11 according to Fig. 2 likewise has recesses ire. the region of the packet portion 12 and lid 13.  A fir.Tt recess 52 is associated with the front wall 14 of :he packet portion 12, a second recess 53 with the, front wall of the lid 13.  By contrast with hinge-lid j:acket 10 according to Fig. 1, the recesses 52, 53 of 1 Lnge-lid packet 11, however, are closed towards tht-; outside. A covering 54, 55 which is detachable .from the front wall 14 or from the lid front<br><br>
wall 25 serves this purpose in each case.  The coverings li  or 55 are portions of the front wall 14 or lid front vrall 25.  The coverings 54, 55 can be grasped and detached by the user via a holding tab 58, 59 delimited Iny continuous severance cuts 56, 57.  To this end, the ccverings 54, 55 of front wall 14 on the one hand, and !,id front wall 25 on the other hand are delimited -Isewhere by perforation lines 60, 61.  The recesses 5,:, 53 in the region of the packet portion 12 or lid 13, are accordingly only revealed by detaching the coverir.gs 54, 55.<br>
Recesses 52, 53 of hinge-lid packet 11 are, just like recesses 46, 47 of hinge-lid packet 10, closed on the side point-I ig towards the block of cigarettes 45.  This purpose is .served by region 50 of the collar front wall 36 on the c;ie hand, and by region 51 of the lid inner flap 43.  Tor the details of this, reference can be made to the above explanations.<br>
Coverin'gs b4,   55 of hinge-lid packet 11 can serve as carriers fen: an additional imprint both on their front side and or.i their rear side.  Thus, for example, a coupon or a lottery ticket number can be printed on the side of the coverings 54, 55 pointing towards the block of cigarettrs 45.  Only when the consumer has detached the coverinrr 54, 55 does the imprint become visible to him.<br><br>
As a varia:ion on the embodiments shown in the drawings, :lt is furthermore possible to arrange additional recesses in the region of the side walls 16,<br>
17	of the !;inge-lid packet 10, 11.  In this case, these<br>
recesses are associated with the outer side flaps 21,<br>
22 or lid Hide flaps 32, 33.  The inner side flaps 19,<br>
20 or inne:: lid side flaps 30, 31 serve in this case to<br>
close the recesses on the side pointing towards the<br>
block of cigarettes 45 and as a carrier for an imprint.<br>
Figs. 3, 4 show the blanks 23, 24 for the manufacture of hinge-lid packets 10, 11.  The blanks 23, 24 are of overall lo.:i,g stretched-out design.  The walls of packet portion 12 and of lid 10 of hinge-lid packets 10, 11 are configured succeeding one another as on a blank for a traditioi'.-.al hinge-lid packet. Accordingly, in the longitudinsL direction of the blanks 23, 24, front wall 14, base wall 18, rear wall 15, lid rear wall 26, lid upper wall 29  and lid front wall 25 are disposed in succession and defined by fold lines. The side flaps 19..22 or 1Ld side flaps 30..33 are arranged on both sides of the front wall 14 and rear wall 15 or lid rear wall 2 6 and lid front wall 25 to form the side walls 16, 17 or l;.d side walls 27, 28.  The base corner flaps 39, 40 or ],;.d corner flaps 41, 42 adjoin the base wall<br>
18	or lid upper wall 29 on both sides.<br>
The blanks 13, 24 are detached from a continuous web of material.  In this process, the recesses 47, 48 of<br><br>
front wall 14 and lid front wall 25 of blank 24 for manufactur.ng the hinge-lid packet 10 are also formed To_this en(:, stamping lines 48^ 49 are introduced into blank 24.  On blank 23, perforation lines 60, 61 are introduced into front wall 14 and lid front wall 25 to delimit co-<jerings after the individual blanks have been stamped out and stamping lines or perforation introduced into pr.-.nting is applied to this end lid flap printed on in region rear side. coverings of blank can be both their front side></jerings>
According to the embodiment shown here, the collar 35 is manufactured from a separate blank. As a variation on the embciiiment shown here, however, it is possible for the hinge-lid packet to be formed from a one-piece blank for packet portion 12, lid 13 and collar 35.<br><br><br>
