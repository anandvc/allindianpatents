				<td>The present invention relates to a process for preparation of a novel semigloss enamel formulation useful for decorative applications.<br>
The significance of the present invention is development of new formulations of semigloss enamels based on waste materials. The new formulations based on fly ash can be applied to a variety of surfaces for decorative purpose which simultaneously provides protection to the surface by acting as a barrier. The enamel formulations can also be applied as second coat over primers where higher degree of protection is desirable. The dulling of gloss is less in case of fly ash enamels as compared to the formulations based on conventional mineral extenders. The other properties of fly ash that offer added advantage as extender are its chemical inertness, abrasive nature, less oil absorption and low specific gravity values. Fly ash can be used without any chemical upgradation. The processing of fly ash is simple unlike other mineral extenders, which require long processing involving crushing, grinding, levigation etc. to bring the ores to the final forms.<br>
Reference may be made to published paper by B.B. Gogte &amp; Alok Agrawal in Paint India, Oct. 1994, XLIV,(10), 51-56, entitled 'Fly ash based coatings' wherein work has been reported on preparation of semigloss enamels incorporating fly ash as extender. The formulations were developed as water thinnable alkyd emulsion systems. The enamels were formulated in two shades as grey and green. The formulations of grey enamels are as mentioned below: <br>
(Table Removed) <br>
1.	The formulations of green enamels formulated as water thinnabie alkyd systems are as below: <br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The drawbacks are inferior durability and gloss characteristics of the formulations. The present invention describes the formulation of organic solvent-based semigloss enamels incorporating fly ash as extender for decorative applications. The influence of fly ash on performance properties of the enamels as gloss and colour shades have been studied.<br>
The development of enamel formulations useful for decorative application is a new area of flyash utilization leading to partial replacement of conventional extenders, simultaneously giving solution to safe disposal of an industrial waste.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparation of novel semigloss enamel formulation useful for decorative applications, which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process wherein fly ash, an industrial waste product, has been used.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for preparation of novel semi gloss enamel formulation useful for decorative applications which comprises:<br>
i.	Characterized in that by mixing 18 to 22 weight % of fly ash powder, 2 to 6<br>
weight % pigments, 1% by weight of antisettling agents, 35 weight% of resin Bisphenol -A epichlorohydrin epoxy resin and 20 weight% of organic solvents, to obtain a smooth paste having pigment value concentration in the range of 23.63 to 25.67%;<br>
ii. grinding and dispersing the paste obtained in step (i) till the particle size is in the range of 6-7 microns to obtain a semigloss enamel base;<br>
iii. mixing 4 parts by weight of semigloss enamel base as obtained in step (ii) with 1 part by weight of curing agent modified polyamidoamines optionally with requisite amount of organic solvent to obtain the said formulation.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the fly ash powder used may be of particle size less than 38 microns.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the pigments used may be such as titanium dioxide, pthalocyanine blue, lemon chrome or mixtures thereof, having particle size less than 30 microns.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the antisettling agent used may be such as fine silica, aluminum stearate or soya lecithin.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the organic solvent used may be such as xylene, toluene, N-butyl alcohol or mixtures thereof.<br>
In our copending patent application no nf 143/98, we have claimed and disclosed a novel base formulation which has been used for the preparation of semigloss formulation.<br>
The improved process of the present invention involves washing, drying and sieving of  ESP    (electro static precipitators)  fly   ash to less than   38 microns. The<br>
enamel compositions are formulated by adjusting PVC. The pigments used are like titanium dioxide, pthalocyanine blue and lemon chrome which are sieved to a particle size of less than38 micros. Fine silica is added as an antisettling agent. Resin used is Bisphenol-A epichlorohydrin epoxy with xylene and N-butyl alcohol as solvents. Modified polymidoamine is added as curing agent to the prepared base. The preparation is done by mixing resin and solvent as per the formulation with other powdered ingredients to form mill base of paste consistency, which is then fed in a ball mill with steel balls for grinding. The dispersion process is continued till the desired particle size (6-7 microns) is obtained on Hegmans Gauge. The viscosity and specific gravity for the formulations are determined. Film properties of the enamels are examined by application on mild steel (m.s.) panels. Immersion tests are conducted in distilled water, 5% Na2C03, 2% H2S04, 1% NaOH and organic solvents like toluene and mineral sprit for determination of corrosion resistance. The damage to the enamel coat if any, like blistering, chalking, checking, cracking etc. e visually observed. High stress (two body) abrasion test is conducted. Samples are exposed to natural weathering t 45 facing south and visual observations are taken at regular intervals.<br>
The results indicate good appearance and brushability characteristics of fly ash enamels. The gloss values obtained are in the range of 52-56%. The blue and pale yellow shades were unaffected by whitish grey colour of the ash, obviously a variety of colour shades can be obtained in fly ash enamels but very light shades as white may be slightly affected by the greyish colour of the ash. The maximum scratch hardness of the formulations is 1600 gms which is higher as compared to that of the enamels based on water thinnable systems i.e. 1000 gms. The presence of abrasive materials like silica and alumina as major constituents in fly ash helps to increase the abrasive wear property of the formulations in which it is incorporated. The chemical inertness of fly ash imparts excellent corrosion resistance to enamels in acidic and basic solutions as also in organic solvents. The present study revealed the properties of fly ash, which contribute to its superiority as extender are its less oil absorption and low specific gravity values. Less oil absorption helps to reduce the amount of resin required without affecting the performance of the formulations. The smooth surface structure of fly ash is responsible for less oil absorption. The low<br>
specific gravity of fly ash is an added advantage, as incorporating higher amount of fly ash does not have any adverse increase in the bulk density of the formulation. As observed solvent borne enamel formulations based on fly ash have better gloss, mechanical properties and corrosion resistance than similar compositions based on water thinnable systems.<br>

No hard setting occurs in the formulations during storage. Overall, the performance of solvent based enamels incorporating fly ash was improved in terms of appearance, mechanical properties and durability characteristics as compared to the water thinnable systems. The physical properties and film characteristics of the developed formulations are mentioned in the table below: (Table Removed)<br>
