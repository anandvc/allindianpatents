N-substituted imides as polymerization initiators<br>
The invention relates to novel N-substituted imides and polymerizabie compositions comprising these N-substituted imides. The invention further relates to the use of N-substituted imides as polymerization initiators.<br>
Free-radical polymerization is among the most important methods of building up a relatively long carbon chain. It is employed in process technology for preparing commercially important polymers such as polystyrene, PVC, poly(meth)acrylates, PAN and other polymers. For technical details, reference may be made to the still relevant standard work G. Odian, Principles of Polymerization, McGraw-Hill New York 1991.<br>
Free-radical polymerizations are started using initiators. Initiators which have become established in process technology are azo compounds, dialkyl peroxides, diacyl peroxides, hydroperoxides, thermolabile C-C-dimers, redox systems and photoinitiators. Reference is made to the "Handbook of Free Radical Initiators", (E.T. Denisov, T.G. Denisova, T.S. Pokidova, J. Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. Hoboken, New Jersey, 2003).<br>
Despite their widespread use, these initiators have various disadvantages. Thus, for example, peroxides are extremely readily ignitable and sustain fire. Other classes of substances are potential explosion hazards, so that their use, storage and transport has to involve costly safety precautions. Some initiators generate toxic products, as e.g.AIBN. There is therefore a general need for advantageous initiators useful in process technology which have a satisfactory safety profile for free-radical polymerization processes.<br>
J.D. Druliner describes in J.Phys.Org. Chem. 8, 316-324 (1995) the polymerization of acrylates and methacrylates to make homopolymers and block copolymers initiated by N-alkoxyphthalimides and succinimides.<br>
US2,872,450 describes the manufacture of thio-and dithiocarboxylic acid esters by reaction of cyclic oximides and thio-or dithiocarboxylic acid ester chlorides and their use as fungicides.<br><br>
US 6,667,376 describes compounds of the general formula R1S-C(=S)-0-NR2R3 used as control agents for living type free radical polymerization.<br>

Definitions: Thermal curing:<br>
Thermal curing refers to the application of convection heat or IR- or NIR-radiation or microwave irradiation or ultrasound exposure after the mixture has been applied to substrate. In case of powder coatings the adhered powder coating is first melted to form a surface layer preferably by convection heat. Suitable temperatures to initiate and complete free-radical polymerization are 60-180QC.<br>
NIR-curing<br>
The NIR radiation used in the process according to the invention is short-wave infrared radiation in the wavelength range from about 750 nm to about 1500 nm, preferably 750 nm to 1200 nm. Radiation sources for NIR radiation include, for example, conventional NIR radiation emitters, which are available commercially (for example, from Adphos).<br>
IR-curing<br>
The IR radiation used in the process according to the invention is medium wave radiation in the wave length range from about 1500 nm to about 3000 nm and/or longer-wave infra-red radiation in the wave length range above 3000 nm. IR radiation emitters of this kind are available commercially (for example, from Heraeus).<br><br>
Microwave curing:<br>
The microwave radiation used in this process according to the invention is electro magnetic radiation in the wavelength range from about 1 mm to 30 cm.<br>
Ultrasound Curing:<br>
Ultrasound used in this process according to the invention is sound with a frequency above<br>
20 kHz.<br>
UV-curing<br>
The photochemical curing step is carried out usually using light of wavelengths from about 200 nm to about 600 nm, especially from 200 to 450 nm. As light sources there are used a large number of the most varied types. Both point sources and planiform projectors (lamp carpets) are suitable. Examples are: carbon arc lamps, xenon arc lamps, medium-, high- and low-pressure mercury lamps, optionally doped with metal halides (metal halide lamps), microwave-excited metal-vapor lamps, excimer lamps, super actinic fluorescent tubes, fluorescent lamps, argon filament lamps, electronic flash lamps, photographic flood lights, electron beams and X-rays generated by means of synchrotrons or laser plasma.<br>
Double-curing<br>
Double curable systems comprise ethylenically unsaturated monomers, which can be polymerized by UV radiation or which can be polymerized thermally induced by IR or NIR radiation or microwave irradiation or ultrasound exposure or by convection heat. In a double cure system the thermal curing is preferably followed by UV-curing. However, it is also possible that the UV-curing follows the thermal curing.<br>
Dual-curing<br>
Dual curable systems comprise ethylenically unsaturated monomers, which can be polymerized thermally induced by IR or NIR radiation or microwave irradiation or ultrasound exposure or by convection heat. Furthermore, at least one second thermal crosslinkable compound is present. The second compound preferably crosslinks via a polyol-isocyanate reaction to form a polyurethane.<br><br>
Definition of the ethylenically unsaturated compound<br>
Suitable compounds with olefinic double bonds are all compounds that can be crosslinked by free radical polymerization of the double bond. The ethylenically unsaturated compound may be a monomer, an oligomer or a prepolymer, a mixture thereof or a copolymer thereof.<br>
Monomers suitable for free-radical polymerization are, for example, ethylenically unsaturated polymerizable monomers selected from the group consisting of (meth)acrylates, alkenes, conjugated dienes, styrenes, acrolein, vinyl acetate, vinylpyrrolidone, vinylimidazole, maleic anhydride, fumaric anhydride, (meth)acrylic acid, (meth)acrylic acid derivatives such as esters and amides, vinyl halides and vinylidene halides. Preferred are compounds having (meth)acryloyl, vinyl and/or maleinate groups. Especially preferred are (meth)acrylates.<br>
Compounds which contain free-radically polymerizable double bonds in the form of the preferred (meth)acryloyl groups may be produced in accordance with conventional methods. This may proceed, for example, by: transesterifying OH-functional resins, such as OH-functional polyesters, polyacrylates, polyurethanes, polyethers or epoxy resins, with alkyl esters of (meth)acrylic acid; esterifying the stated OH-functional resins with (meth)acrylic acid; reacting the stated OH-functional resins with isocyanate-functional (meth)acrylates; reacting acid-functional resins, such as polyesters, polyacrylates, polyurethanes with epoxy-functional (meth)acrylates; reacting epoxy-functional resins, such as polyesters, polyacrylates, epoxy resins with (meth)acrylic acid. These production methods stated by way of example are described in the literature and known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
Examples of prepolymers or oligomers include (meth)acryloyl-functional (meth)acrylic copolymers, polyurethane (meth)acrylates, polyester (meth)acrylates, unsaturated polyesters, polyether (meth)acrylates, silicone (meth)acrylates and epoxy resin (meth)acrylates having number-average molecular masses from, for example, 500 to 10,000, preferably 500 to 5,000.<br>
The (meth)acryloyl-functional prepolymers may be used in combination with reactive diluents, i.e., free-radically polymerizable low molecular weight compounds with a molar mass of below 500 g/mol. The reactive diluents may be mono-, di- or polyunsaturated. Examples of monounsaturated reactive diluents are (meth)acrylic acid and the esters thereof, maleic acid and the esters thereof, vinyl acetate, vinyl ether, substituted vinyl ureas, styrene,<br><br>

Examples of diunsaturated reactive diluents are di(meth)acrylates such as alkylene glycol di(meth)acrylate, polyethylene glycol di(meth)acrylate, 1,3-butanediol di-(meth)acrylate, vinyl (meth)acrylate, allyl (meth)acrylate, divinylbenzene, dipropylene glycol di(meth)acrylate, hexanediol di(meth)acrylate. Examples of polyunsaturated reactive diluents are glycerol tri(meth)acrylate, trimethylolpropane tri(meth)acrylate, pentaerythritol tri(meth)-acrylate, pentaerythritol tetra(meth)acrylate. The reactive diluents may be used alone or in mixture.<br>
Suitable salts of acrylic acid or methacrylic acid are, for example, (Ci-C4alkyl)4ammonium or (CrC4alkyl)3NH salts, e.g. the tetramethylammonium, tetraethylammonium, trimethylammo-nium ortriethylammonium salt, the trimethyl-2-hydroxyethylammonium or triethyl-2-hydroxy-ethylammonium salt, the dimethyl-2-hydroxyethylammonium or diethyl-2-hydroxyethylam-monium salt.<br>
The ethylenically unsaturated compounds may contain, in addition to the olefinic double bonds, one or more further, identical or different functional groups. Examples of functional groups include hydroxyl, isocyanate (optionally blocked), N-methylol, N-methylolether, ester, carbamate, epoxy, amino (optionally blocked), acetoacetyl, alkoxysilyl and carboxyl groups. Examples are polyurethane resins with (meth)acryloyl groups and glycerol mono-and di-(meth)acrylate, trimethylol propane mono-and di(meth)acrylate or pentaerythritol tri(meth)-acrylate.<br>

Such additives can be added in small amounts, e.g. UV-absorbers or light stabilizers, e.g. compounds selected from the group consisting of hydroxyphenylbenzotriazoles, hydroxyphenylbenzophenones, oxalamides and hydroxyphenyl-s-triazines. Particularly suitable light stabilizers are those selected from the group consisting of N-alkoxy-Hals compounds such as Tinuvin 123, or of sterically hindered amines Hals compounds of the 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-1,3,5-triazine or 2-hydroxyphenyl-2H-benzotriazole type.
