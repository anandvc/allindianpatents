[4]	Recently, mobile communication systems have developed remarkably, but for high<br>
capacity data communication services, the performance of mobile communication<br>
systems cannot match that of existing wired communication systems. Accordingly,<br>
technical developments for IMT-2000, which is a communication system allowing<br>
high capacity data communications, are being made and standardization of such<br>
technology is being actively pursued among various companies and organizations.<br>
[5]	A universal mobile telecommunication system is a third generation mobile com-<br>
munication system that has evolved from a European standard known as Global<br>
System for Mobile communications (GSM). The UMTS aims to provide improved<br>
mobile communication service based on a GSM core network and wideband code<br>
division multiple access (W-CDMA) wireless connection technology.<br>
[6]	In December 1998, ETSI of Europe, ARIB/TTC of Japan, T1 of the United States,<br>
and TTA of Korea formed a Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) for creating<br>
the detailed specifications of the UMTS technology.<br>
[7]	Within the 3GPP, in order to achieve rapid and efficient technical development of<br>
the UMTS, five technical specification groups (TSG) have been created for performing<br>
the standardization of the UMTS by considering the independent nature of the network<br>
elements and their operations.<br>
[8]	Each TSG develops, approves, and manages the standard specification within a<br>
related region. Among these groups, the radio access network (RAN) group<br>
(TSG-RAN) develops the standards for the functions, requirements, and interface of<br>
the UMTS terrestrial radio access network (UTRAN), which is a new radio access<br>
network for supporting W-CDMA access technology in the UMTS.<br>
[9]	Figure 1 illustrates an exemplary basic structure of a general UMTS network. As<br>
shown in Figure 1, the UMTS is roughly divided into a terminal or user equipment UE<br>
10, a UTRAN 100 and a core network (CN) 200.<br>
[10]	The UTRAN 100 includes one or more radio network sub-systems (RNS) 110,120.<br>
Each RNS 110, 120 includes a radio network controller (RNC) 111, and a plurality of<br>
base stations or Node-Bs 112,113 managed by the RNC 111 through an Iub interface.<br>
The RNC 111 handles the assigning and managing of radio resources, and operates as<br>
an access point with respect to the core network 200. RNCs 111 can be connected<br>
together via the Iur interface.<br>
[11]	The Node-Bs 112, 113 receive information sent by the physical layer of the<br>
terminal 10 through an uplink, and transmit data to the terminal 10 through a downlink.<br><br>
3<br>
WO 2006/104346	PCT/KR2006/001145<br>
The Node-Bs 112,113, thus operate as access points of the UTRAN 100 for the<br>
terminal 10. Each Node-B controls one or several cells, each being characterised by the<br>
coverage of a given geographical area on a given frequency.<br>
[12]	A primary function of the UTRAN 100 is forming and maintaining a radio access<br>
bearer (RAB) to allow communication between the terminal and the core network 200.<br>
The core network 200 applies end-to-end quality of service (QoS) requirements to the<br>
RAB, and the RAB supports the QoS requirements set by the core network 200. As the<br>
UTRAN 100 forms and maintains the RAB, the QoS requirements of end-to-end are<br>
satisfied. The RAB service can be further divided into an Iu bearer service and a radio<br>
bearer service. The Iu bearer service supports a reliable transmission of user data<br>
between boundary nodes of the UTRAN 100 and the core network 200.<br>
[13]	The core network 200 includes a mobile switching centre (MSC) 210 and a Media<br>
Gateway MGW 220 connected together for supporting a circuit switched (CS) service,<br>
and a serving GPRS support node (SGSN) 230 and a gateway GPRS support node 240<br>
connected together for supporting a packet switched (PS) service.<br>
[14]	The services provided to a specific terminal are roughly divided into the circuit<br>
switched (CS) services and the packet switched (PS) services. For example, a general<br>
voice conversation service is a circuit switched service, while a Web browsing service<br>
via an Internet connection is classified as a packet switched (PS) service.<br>
[15]	Various types of interfaces exist between network components to allow the network<br>
components to transmit and receive information to and from each other for mutual<br>
communication therebetween. An interface between the RNC 111 and the core<br>
network 200 is defined as an Iu interface. Each RNC is connected via the interface Iu<br>
to the core network 200. In particular, the Iu interface between the RNCs 111 and the<br>
core network 200 for packet switched systems is defined as Iu-PS, and the Iu interface<br>
between the RNCs 111 and the core network 200 for circuit switched systems is<br>
defined as Iu-CS.<br>
[16]	For supporting circuit switched services, the RNCs 111 are connected to the MSC<br>
210 of the core network 200, and the MSC 210 is connected to the Media Gateway<br>
(MGW) 220 which manages the connection with other networks via the interface Nb.<br>
The MGW 220 may be connected to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)<br>
in order to adapt codecs between the PSTN and the connected Radio Access Network.<br>
For supporting packet switched services, the RNCs 111 are connected to the SGSN<br>
230 and the GGSN 240 of the core network 200. The SGSN 230 supports the packet<br>
communications going toward the RNCs 111, and the GGSN 240 manages the<br>
connection with other packet switched networks, such as the Internet, via the interface<br>
Gi. The GGSN 240 notably handles the routing, the charging and the separation of data<br>
flows into different Radio Access Bearers RAB. The SGSN is connected via the GS<br><br>
4<br>
WO 2006/104346	PCT/KR2006/001145<br>
interface to the MSC and via the GN interface to the GGSN. The SGSN 230 is<br>
connected by respective interfaces to an EIR and to a HSS (not illustrated). The MSC<br>
210 is connected by respective interfaces to the EIR and the HSS. The MGW 220 is<br>
connected by an interface to the HSS. The GGSN is connected by an interface to the<br>
HSS. The EIR hosts lists of mobiles which are allowed or not to be used on the<br>
network The HSS handles the subscription data of the users.<br>
[17]	Figure 2 illustrates a structure of a radio interface protocol between the terminal and<br>
the UTRAN according to the 3GPP radio access network standards.<br>
[18]	As shown in Figure 2, the radio interface protocol has horizontal layers comprising<br>
a physical layer, a data link layer, and a network layer, and has vertical planes<br>
comprising a user plane UP for transmitting user data and a control plane CP for<br>
transmitting control information.<br>
[19]	The user plane is a region that handles traffic information of the user, such as voice<br>
or Internet protocol (IP) packets, while the control plane is a region that handles<br>
control information for an interface of a network, maintenance and management of a<br>
call, and the like.<br>
[20]	The protocol layers in Figure 2 can be divided into a first layer (LI), a second layer<br>
(L2), and a third layer (L3) based on three lower layers of an open system interconnection<br>
(OSI) standard model. Each layer will be described in more detail as<br>
follows.<br>
[21]	The first layer (LI), namely, the physical layer, provides an information transfer<br>
service to an upper layer by using various radio transmission techniques. The physical<br>
layer is connected to an upper layer called a medium access control (MAC) layer, via a<br>
transport channel. The MAC layer and the physical layer send and receive data with<br>
one another via the transport channel.<br>
[22]	The second layer (L2) includes a MAC layer, a radio link control (RLC) layer, a<br>
broadcast/multicast control (BMC) layer, and a packet data convergence protocol<br>
(PDCP) layer.<br>
[23]	The MAC layer handles mapping between logical channels and transport channels.<br>
The MAC layer provides an allocation service of the MAC parameters for allocation<br>
and re-allocation of radio resources. The MAC layer is connected to an upper layer<br>
called the radio link control (RLC) layer, via a logical channel.<br>
[24]	Various logical channels are provided according to the kind of transmitted in-<br>
formation. In general, when information of the control plane is transmitted, a control<br>
channel Ctrl is used. When information of the user plane is transmitted, a traffic<br>
channel is used. A logical channel may be a common channel or a dedicated channel<br>
depending on whether the logical channel is shared. Logical channels include a<br>
dedicated traffic channel (DTCH), a dedicated control channel (DCCH), a common<br><br>
5<br>
WO 2006/104346	PCT/KR2006/001145<br>
traffic channel (CTCH), a common control channel (CCCH), a broadcast control<br>
channel (BCCH) and a paging control channel (PCCH) or a Shared Channel Control<br>
Channel (SHCCH). The BCCH provides information including information utilized by<br>
a terminal to access a system. The PCCH is used by the UTRAN to access a terminal.<br>
[25]	A Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS or MBMS service) refers to a<br>
method of providing streaming or background services to a plurality of UEs using a<br>
downlink-dedicated MBMS radio bearer that utilizes at least one of point-to-multipoint<br>
and point-to-point radio bearer. MBMS is introduced in the UMTS standard in the<br>
Release 6 of the specification. It describes techniques for optimised transmission of<br>
MBMS bearer service in UTRA such as point-to-multipoint transmission, selective<br>
combining and transmission mode selection between point-to-multipoint and point-<br>
to-point bearer. This is used in order to save radio resources when the same content is<br>
sent to multiple users, and enables TV-like services. One MBMS service includes one<br>
or more sessions and MBMS data is transmitted to the plurality of terminals through<br>
the MBMS radio bearer only while the session is ongoing.<br>
[26]	As the name implies, an MBMS may be carried out in a broadcast mode or a<br>
multicast mode. The broadcast mode is for transmitting multimedia data to all UEs<br>
within a broadcast area, for example the domain where the broadcast is available. The<br>
multicast mode is for transmitting multimedia data to a specific UE group within a<br>
multicast area, for example the domain where the multicast service is available.<br>
[27]	For the purposes of MBMS, additional traffic and control channels exist. For<br>
example, an MCCH (MBMS point-to-multipoint Control Channel) is used for<br>
transmitting MBMS control information, an MTCH (MBMS point-to-multipoint<br>
Traffic Channel) is used for transmitting MBMS service data and an MSCH is used to<br>
transmit scheduling information. The MCCH schedule is common for all services.<br>
[28]	The different logical channels that exist are listed below:<br>
[29]	For the control channel CCH: BCCH, PCCH, DCCH, CCCH, SHCCH and MCCH.<br>
For the Traffic channel TCH : DTCH, CTCH and MTCH.<br>
[30]	The MAC layer is connected to the physical layer by transport channels and can be<br>
divided into a MAC-b sub-layer, a MAC-d sub-layer, a MAC-c/sh sub-layer, and a<br>
MAC-hs sub-layer according to the type of transport channel to be managed.<br>
[31]	The MAC-b sub-layer manages a BCH (Broadcast Channel), which is a transport<br>
channel handling the broadcasting of system information. The MAC-d sub-layer<br>
manages a dedicated channel (DCH), which is a dedicated transport channel for a<br>
specific terminal. Accordingly, the MAC-d sub-layer of the UTRAN is located in a<br>
serving radio network controller (SRNC) that manages a corresponding terminal, and<br>
one MAC-d sub-layer also exists within each terminal (UE).<br>
[32]	The MAC-c/sh sub-layer manages a common transport channel, such as a forward<br><br>
6<br>
WO 2006/104346	PCT/KR2006/001145<br>
access channel (FACH) or a downlink shared channel (DSCH), which is shared by a<br>
plurality of terminals, or in the uplink the Radio Access Channel (RACH). In the<br>
UTRAN, the MAC-c/sh sub-layer is located in a controlling radio network controller<br>
(CRNC). As the MAC-c/sh sub-layer manages the channel being shared by all<br>
terminals within a cell region, a single MAC-c/sh sub-layer exists for each cell region.<br>
Also, one MAC-c/sh sublayer exists in each terminal (UE). The MAC-m sublayer may<br>
handle the MBMS data.<br>
[33]	Referring to Figure 3, possible mapping between the logical channels and the<br>
transport channels from a UE perspective is shown. Referring to Figure 4, possible<br>
mapping between the logical channels and the transport channels from a UTRAN<br>
perspective is shown.<br>
[34]	The RLC layer supports reliable data transmissions, and performs a segmentation<br>
and concatenation function on a plurality of RLC service data units (RLC SDUs)<br>
delivered from an upper layer. When the RLC layer receives the RLC SDUs from the<br>
upper layer, the RLC layer adjusts the size of each RLC SDU in an appropriate manner<br>
upon considering processing capacity, and then creates certain data units with header<br>
information added thereto. The created data units are called protocol data units<br>
(PDUs), which are then transferred to the MAC layer via a logical channel. The RLC<br>
layer includes a RLC buffer for storing the RLC SDUs and/or the RLC PDUs.<br>
[35]	The BMC layer schedules a cell broadcast message (referred to as a CB message,<br>
hereinafter) received from the core network, and broadcasts the CB messages to<br>
terminals located in a specific cell(s). The BMC layer of the UTRAN generates a<br>
broadcast/multicast control (BMC) message by adding information, such as a message<br>
ID (identification), a serial number, and a coding scheme to the CB message received<br>
from the upper layer, and transfers the BMC message to the RLC layer. The BMC<br>
messages are transferred from the RLC layer to the MAC layer through a logical<br>
channel, i.e., the CTCH (Common Traffic Channel). The CTCH is mapped to a<br>
transport channel, i.e., a FACH, which is mapped to a physical channel, i.e., a S-<br>
CCPCH (Secondary Common Control Physical Channel).<br>
[36]	The PDCP (Packet Data Convergence Protocol) layer, as a higher layer of the RLC<br>
layer, allows the data transmitted through a network protocol, such as an IPv4 or IPv6,<br>
to be effectively transmitted on a radio interface with a relatively small bandwidth. To<br>
achieve this, the PDCP layer reduces unnecessary control information used in a wired<br>
network, with a function called header compression.<br>
[37]	A radio resource control (RRC) layer is located at a lowermost portion of the L3<br>
layer. The RRC layer is defined only in the control plane, and handles the control of<br>
logical channels, transport channels, and physical channels with respect to setup, re-<br>
configuration, and release or cancellation of radio bearers (RBs). The radio bearer<br><br>
7<br>
WO 2006/104346	PCT/KR2006/001145<br>
service refers to a service provided by the second layer (L2) for data transmission<br>
between the terminal and the UTRAN. In general, the setup of the radio bearer refers<br>
to the process of defining the characteristics of a protocol layer and a channel required<br>
for providing a specific data service, as well as respectively setting detailed parameters<br>
and operation methods. Additionally, the RRC handles user mobility within the Radio<br>
Access Network, and additional services like location services.<br>
[38]	The different possibilities that exist for the mapping between the radio bearers and<br>
the transport channels are not always possible. The UE/UTRAN deduces the possible<br>
mapping depending on the UE state and the procedure that the UE/UTRAN is<br>
executing. Different states and modes are explained in more detail below.<br>
[39]	The different transport channels are mapped onto different physical channels. For<br>
example, the RACH transport channel is mapped on a given PRACH, the DCH can be<br>
mapped on the DPCH, the FACH and the PCH can be mapped on the S-CCPCH, the<br>
DSCH is mapped on the PDSCH and so on. The configuration of the physical channels<br>
is given by an RRC signalling exchange between the RNC and the UE.<br>
[40]	In the following description, the start and the reconfiguration of a S-CCPCH<br>
carrying MTCH is described. The stop of a service can be considered as a special re-<br>
configuration, i.e. the S-CCPCH has a null configuration.<br>
[41]	According to the background art, when the UE reads the configuration of a service<br>
which is sent in PtM mode, the UE supposes this configuration is valid immediately.<br>
The UE receives the list of services that are active at the moment in one of the two<br>
messages; MBMS Unmodified services Information or in the message MBMS<br>
Modified services Information. These messages indicate that UEs that want to receive<br>
this service should perform a specific action, for example acquire information for<br>
counting purposes, acquire information for the configuration of the PtM radio bearer,<br>
establish a PMM connection, stop receiving the PtM radio bearer etc. On the network<br>
side, when the configuration is changed for a given service, the new configuration is<br>
indicated on the MCCH one modification period in advance in the MBMS Modified<br>
services Information message indicating that the UE shall acquire information for the<br>
configuration of the PtM radio bearer, so that UEs can receive the reconfigured<br>
channel from the beginning. Thus, there is a delay between the configuration taken into<br>
account by the UE and its effective use by the network.<br>
[42]	Such a configuration protocol is illustrated at Figure 10 for a single cell. In this<br>
case, a service starts in the current cell (the current cell is the control cell, i.e. the cell<br>
of which is taken into account the MCCH by the UE) and does not generate any con-<br>
figuration problem: indeed, the timing offset between the MTCH and the MCCH (due<br>
to a different Timing offset when they are mapped on different S-CCPCHs) remains<br>
the same. However, it is not clear which frame will be considered when the mod-<br><br>
8<br>
WO 2006/104346	PCT/KR2006/001145<br>
ification period of the MCCH is not completely aligned on the frame boundaries of the<br>
S-CCPCH carrying MTCH.<br>
[43]	The case with an ongoing reconfiguration illustrated at figure 11, generates more<br>
problems. During the Modification Period 1, the PtM configuration S1 of the Service S<br>
of cell A is sent on the MCCH as unmodified service. At the same time, the service S<br>
is sent on the cell A with the configuration S1. The UTRAN wants to change the con-<br>
figuration from S1 to S2. Therefore, the UTRAN broadcasts the new configuration S2<br>
of the S-CCPCH carrying service S on the MCCH during the modification period 2 as<br>
a modified service. During the modification period 2, the MTCH carrying the service S<br>
still uses the configuration S1. But at a given frame during modification period 2, the<br>
UE will start using configuration S2. In the Modification period 3 the MCCH is used to<br>
broadcast the configuration S2 as unmodified service. Thus, until the beginning of the<br>
modification period 3, the UE will use a wrong configuration for the MCCH.<br>
[44]	In the case a reconfiguration is ongoing and a UE starts to receive the MCCH<br>
during the modification period 2 where the new configuration is broadcast on the<br>
MCCH, the UE is not able to know about the configuration of the MTCH during the<br>
current modification period. Also, the UE is not able to receive the MTCH correctly<br>
during this period.<br>
[45]	In order to increase the coverage, a UE which is located between different cells can<br>
receive the same MBMS services from different cells at the same time, and combine<br>
the received information as shown in Figure 9. In this case, the UE reads the MCCH<br>
from one control cell that it has selected, this cell being named the control cell in the<br>
remainder of the description.<br>
[46]	In the background art, there is no restriction for the alignment of the MCCHs of<br>
these cells. This implies that the modification period of MCCHs of neighbouring cells<br>
(a control cell and one of its neighbouring cells for instance) can be different, and also<br>
that the start of each modification period in neighbouring cells can be different. This<br>
occurs naturally due to the clock drift of different NodeBs, e.g. one NodeB will<br>
advance faster as another NodeB.<br>
[47]	In order to maintain synchronisation between different services of the transmission<br>
of MTCH, the clock drift between two NodeBs can in general be easily adjusted by the<br>
RNC that is responsible for the scheduling of the S-CCPCHs by inserting an empty<br>
TTI from time to time when the time difference for the latest NodeB compared to the<br>
most advanced NodeB passes above one TTI, as illustrated at figure 12. However, for<br>
the synchronisation of the modification periods of the MCCH there is no easy solution,<br>
since the scheduling of the MCCH transmission is related to the System frame number<br>
(SFN, broadcast on the BCH) of each cell.<br>
[48]	If the configuration of a service in a neighbouring cell changes, this change is<br><br>
9<br>
WO 2006/104346	PCT/KR2006/001145<br>
aligned with the modification period of the MCCH of this neighbouring cell. However,<br>
the modification period of the neighbouring cell will not necessarily be aligned with<br>
the modification period of the cell that the UE is currently reading the MCCH from.<br>
This means that in the case the UE receives the information on the change of the con-<br>
figuration of a service of a neighbouring cell, it has no means for determining when<br>
this change will become active, since the offset (and the modification period) of the<br>
neighbouring cell is not aligned.<br>

Technical Solution<br>
[49]	Thus, there is a need for a solution that improves the service reconfiguration timing<br>
for a user equipment receiving a MBMS service from neighbouring cells. One aspect<br>
of the present invention involves the recognition by the present inventors of the<br>
drawbacks in the related art as explained above. In order to address such problems, the<br>
present invention proposes the following:<br>
[50]	The invention proposes a method for indicating the validity of physical channels of<br>
a control cell and a neighbouring cell carrying point-to-multipoint service data in a<br>
wireless communication system, the method comprising the following steps:<br>
[51]	-generating a message comprising configuration information for each of said<br>
channels;<br>
[52]	-including validity information with the message for deriving the validity timing of<br>
the configuration information for each of said channels; and<br>
[53]	-transmitting the message to a mobile terminal through the control cell.<br>
[54]	The point-to-multipoint service data may comprise Multimedia Broadcast Multicast<br>
Service (MBMS) data.<br>
[55]	The message may contain a neighbouring cell configuration validity timing related<br>
to a control cell system timing transmitted to the mobile terminal.<br>
[56]	The validity information may define a neighbouring cell configuration information<br>
validity timing based on a reference to the control cell System Frame Number.<br>
[57]	The reference to the control cell System Frame Number does preferably not include<br>
at least one of the most significant bits of the System Frame Number coding.<br>
[58]	The validity information may be included in a MBMS Modified Services In-<br>
formation or a MBMS Unmodified Services Information control message transmitted<br>
on the MCCH of the control channel.<br>
[59]	The message may define a modification period at the start of which a configuration<br>
information becomes valid.<br>
[60]	The message may define a time offset relative to the beginning of a modification<br>
period.<br><br>
10<br>
WO 2006/104346	PCT/KR2006/001145<br>
[61]	The message may define the time offset with a number representative of a number<br>
of frames or Time Transmission Intervals.<br>
[62]	The validity information may comprise the currently valid configuration in-<br>
formation and the next valid configuration information in case the configuration in-<br>
formation of the neighbouring cell is changed.<br>
[63]	The currently valid configuration information and the next valid configuration in-<br>
formation may be associated respectively to a beginning of validity timing and to an<br>
end of validity timing.<br>
[64]	The currently valid configuration may be associated to a flag indicating that this<br>
configuration may be used immediately.<br>
[65]	The invention also proposes a method for adapting the configuration of physical<br>
channels set by a user equipment with a control cell and a neighbouring cell carrying<br>
point-to-multipoint service data in a wireless communication system, the method<br>
comprising the following steps:<br>
[66]	-receiving a message comprising configuration information for each of said<br>
channels and validity information for deriving the validity timing of the configuration<br>
information for each of said channels;<br>
[67]	-determining respective timing starting from which the configuration information of<br>
each of said channels is valid based on the validity information;<br>
[68]	-starting from said timing, receiving the channels using the valid configuration.<br>
[69]	The point-to-multipoint service data may comprise Multimedia Broadcast Multicast<br>
Service (MBMS) data.<br>
[70]	The received message may contain a neighbouring cell configuration validity<br>
timing related to a control cell system timing transmitted to the mobile terminal.<br>
[71]	The validity information may define a neighbouring cell configuration information<br>
validity timing based on a reference to the control cell System Frame Number.<br>
[72]	The reference to the control cell System Frame Number does preferably not include<br>
at least one of the most significant bits of the System Frame Number coding.<br>
[73]	The validity information may be included in a MBMS Modified Services Information<br>
or a MBMS Unmodified Services Information control message transmitted<br>
on the MCCH of the control channel.<br>
[74]	The message may define a modification period at the start of which a configuration<br>
information becomes valid.<br>
[75]	The message may define a time offset relative to the beginning of a modification<br>
period.<br>
[76]	The validity information may comprise the currently valid configuration and the<br>
next valid configuration in case the configuration of the neighbouring cell is changed.<br>
[77]	The currently valid configuration and the next valid configuration may be<br><br>

WO 2006/104346	PCT/KR2006/001145<br>
associated respectively to a beginning of validity timing and to an end of validity<br>
timing.<br>
[78]	The currently valid configuration may be associated to a flag indicating that this<br>
configuration information may be used immediately.<br>
[79]	The invention also proposes a mobile equipment, comprising:<br>
[80]	-a reception module :<br>
[81]	-adapted to receive physical channels carrying point-to-multipoint service data<br>
from a control cell and from a neighbouring cell belonging to a wireless com-<br>
munication system; and<br>
[82]	-adapted to change the physical channel configuration at a given time moment;<br>
[83]	-a processing module :<br>
[84]	-adapted to extract configuration information associated to the physical channels<br>
and configuration validity information from a message transmitted by a control cell;<br>
and<br>
[85]	-adapted to derive the validity timing of the configuration information based on the<br>
configuration validity information;<br>
[86]	-adapted to generate a command defining a physical channel configuration change<br>
at a given moment and to provide it to the reception module.<br>
[87]	The invention also proposes a radio network controller, comprising:<br>
[88]	-a module for :<br>
[89]	-generating a message comprising configuration information for physical channels<br>
of cells intended to be used respectively as a control cell and a neighbouring cell, these<br>
physical channels being foreseen for carrying point-to-multipoint service data in a<br>
wireless communication system;<br>
[90]	-including validity information with the message based on which the validity<br>
timing of the configuration information may be derived for each of said channels; and<br>
[91]	-an interface adapted to provide the message to a control cell.<br>

Mode for the Invention<br>
[110]	The RLC layer (Radio Link Control) is a layer 2 protocol which is used in order to<br>
control the data exchange between the logical channels of the RNC and the UE. The<br>
RLC layer can currently be configured in 3 types of transfer modes: the transparent<br>
mode, the unacknowledged mode and the acknowledged mode. The detailed behaviour<br>
of these modes is described in the document named, Radio Link Control (RLC)<br>
protocol specification under the reference 3GPP TS 25.322. The different func-<br>
tionalities that are available depend on the transfer mode.<br>
[111]	In acknowledged and unacknowledged mode SDUs (serving data unit) can be split<br>
into smaller PDUs (packet data units) that are used for transmission over the air<br>
interface. The transmitter side separates the SDU in PDUs, and based on control in-<br>
formation that is added to the PDUs, the receiver side re-assembles the PDUs in order<br>
to reconstruct the SDUs. Such control information is for example a PDU sequence<br>
number in order to detect whether a PDU has been lost, or a Length Indicator (LI),<br><br>
13<br>
WO 2006/104346	PCT/KR2006/001145<br>
which indicates the beginning/end of a SDU inside an RLC PDU.<br>
[112] In unacknowledged mode (UM) the receiver does not send a confirmation to the<br>
transmitter of correctly received PDUs, but the receiver side just reassembles PDUs to<br>
SDUs based on signalling information contained in the PDUs and transfers the<br>
complete SDUs to higher layers.<br>
[113] In acknowledged mode (AM), the receiver sends acknowledgements for the<br>
correctly received PDU. The transmitter uses these acknowledgements in order to<br>
initiate retransmissions of missing PDUs. The acknowledgements are sent in certain<br>
conditions. Several mechanisms are used to initiate the transmission of the acknowl-<br>
edgements for PDUs received by the receiver. The choice of the activated mechanisms<br>
is defined in the standard and/or configured by RRC signalling. One example for such<br>
a mechanism for the transmission of a status PDU is for example the reception of a<br>
PDU with a sequence number that does not correspond to the latest received sequence<br>
number increased by one, or when the receiver receives an indication from the<br>
transmitter in the RLC control information that an acknowledgment (also called Status)<br>
should be sent. The indication of the transmitter to send a status PDU is called Polling.<br>
[114]	When the transmitter sends a Polling bit, a mechanism is defined in the UMTS<br>
standard if no Status report has been received after the transmission of the polling after<br>
a certain time. According to this mechanism, the transmitter retransmits a PDU<br>
including the polling indicator and is called a timer poll.<br>
[115]	Another mechanism counts the number of retransmissions of a PDU. In the case the<br>
retransmission exceeds a certain number (MaxDat) the transmitter starts the reset<br>
procedure. The reset procedure is a procedure that allows to set the transmitter and the<br>
receiver entity of a radio bearer using AM RLC mode to an initial state. When the<br>
Reset procedure is initiated, the initiating entity transmits a Reset PDU to the<br>
terminating entity. The terminating entity acknowledges the reception of the Reset<br>
PDU by transmitting the Reset Ack PDU. If the initiating entity has not received the<br>
Reset Ack PDU after a certain time, the initiating entity retransmits the Reset PDU. If<br>
the initiating entity has not received a Reset Ack PDU after a certain amount of re-<br>
transmissions, the initiating entity detects an unrecoverable error.<br>
[116]	This example describes the situation where a dysfunction is detected in the<br>
operation of an RLC entity in RLC AM mode. Other mechanisms to detect a<br>
dysfunction are possible, are already described in the UMTS standard, or possible to be<br>
imagined and implemented. It is also possible to imagine detection mechanisms for<br>
RLC entities in UM mode, which would for example detect that undefined signalling<br>
information is included in the RLC PDU, or where higher layers detect that the<br>
reception/transmission of the UM entity is not behaving correctly.<br>
[117]	Other mechanisms can detect an unrecoverable error, which can correspond to a<br><br>
14<br>
WO 2006/104346	PCT/KR2006/001145<br>
blocked situation, or a situation where the communication is disturbed.<br>
[118]	If the UE detects an unrecoverable error situation as described in the standard, the<br>
UE enters CELLJ_FACH state and sends a Cell update message to the NodeB/RNC<br>
eventually indicating that an unrecoverable error has occurred by setting the In-<br>
formation Element (IE) Cell update cause to the cause RLC unrecoverable error. The<br>
UE indicates by including the IE AM_RLC error indication (RB2, RB3 or RB4) that<br>
this unrecoverable error has either occurred for one of the SRBs with the Ids 2, 3 or 4.<br>
By including the IE AM_RLC error indication (RB&gt;4), the UE indicates that this error<br>
has occurred for one of the RBs using RLC AM mode with Ids higher than 4. The<br>
RNC can then send the Cell Update Confirm message and indicate that the RLC<br>
entities for SRBs with the Ids 2, 3 and 4, or for the RBs with Ids higher than 4 that use<br>
RLC AM mode shall be re-established by setting the IE RLC re-establish indicator<br>
(RB2, RB3 and RB4) and / or RLC re-establish indicator (RB5 and upwards) to true.<br>
[119]	The UM/AM RLC entity is also responsible for handling of ciphering and de-<br>
ciphering. In order to do so, the RLC entity in the transmitter and the receiver maintain<br>
a COUNT-C number, which is composed of a Hyper frame number (HFN) and the<br>
RLC sequence number (SN). The COUNT-C value, together with other information, is<br>
used as input to a mathematical function that generates a bitstring. This bitstring and<br>
the RLC PDU except the SN are combined by the logical XOR operation, which<br>
ensures the ciphering of the data part of the RLC PDU. The HFN value is incremented<br>
each time the RLC SN wraps around (i.e. when the RLC SN reaches its highest value<br>
and restarts from 0). In the case the receiver misses a certain number of SNs, or in the<br>
case the SN received has been altered during the reception, the COUNT-C in the<br>
receiver and the transmitter may be desynchronized. In this case, the receiver is not<br>
able to decipher correctly the information received. The receiver can detect the<br>
dysfunction of the deciphering entity by different mechanisms.<br>
[120]	The RRC mode refers to whether there exists a logical connection between the RRC<br>
of the terminal and the RRC of the UTRAN. If there is a connection, the terminal is<br>
said to be in RRC connected mode. If there is no connection, the terminal is said to be<br>
in idle mode. Because a RRC connection exists for terminals in RRC connected mode,<br>
the UTRAN can determine the existence of a particular terminal within the unit of<br>
cells, for example which cell or set of cells the RRC connected mode terminal is in,<br>
and which physical channel the UE is listening to. Thus, the terminal can be effectively<br>
controlled.<br>
[121]	In contrast, the UTRAN cannot determine the existence of a terminal in idle mode.<br>
The existence of idle mode terminals can only be determined by the core network to be<br>
within a region that is larger than a cell, for example a location or a routing area.<br>
Therefore, the existence of idle mode terminals is determined within large regions,<br><br>
15<br>
WO 2006/104346	PCT/KR2006/001145<br>
and, in order to receive mobile communication services such as voice or data, the idle<br>
mode terminal must move or change into the RRC connected mode. The possible<br>
transitions between modes and states of a user equipment are shown in Figure 5. OS<br>
stands for Out of service, IS stands for In service, R stands for a step of releasing a<br>
RRC connexion and E stands for a step of establishing a RRC connexion.<br>
[122]	A UE in RRC connected mode can be in different states, for example CELL_FACH<br>
state, CELL_PCH state, CELL_DCH state or URA_PCH state, other states being<br>
possible. Depending on the states the UE carries out different actions and listens to<br>
different channels. For example a UE in CELL_DCH state will try to listen (amongst<br>
others) to DCH type of transport channels which comprises DTCH and DCCH<br>
transport channels and which can be mapped to a certain DPCH, DPDSCH, or other<br>
physical channels. The UE in CELL_FACH state will listen to several FACH transport<br>
channel which are mapped to a certain S-CCPCH, the UE in PCH state will listen to<br>
the PICH channel and to the PCH channel which is mapped to a certain S-CCPCH<br>
physical channel.<br>
[123]	The main system information is sent on the BCCH logical channel which is mapped<br>
on the P-CCPCH (primary Common Control Physical Channel). Specific system in-<br>
formation blocks can be sent on the FACH channel. When the system information is<br>
sent on FACH, the UE receives the configuration of the FACH either on the BCCH<br>
that is received on P-CCPCH or on a dedicated channel. When system information is<br>
sent on the BCCH (i.e. via the P-CCPCH), then in each frame or set of two frames, the<br>
SFN (System frame number) is sent which is used in order to share the same timing<br>
reference between the UE and the NodeB. The P-CCPCH is always sent using the<br>
same scrambling code as the P-CPICH (primary common pilot channel) which is the<br>
primary scrambling code of the cell. The spreading code that is used by the P-CCPCH<br>
remains a fixed SF (spreading factor) 256 and the number remains equal to 1 as<br>
defined in 3GPP TS 25.213: Spreading and modulation (FDD),<br>
V6.0.0(ftp.//ftp.3gpp.org/Specs/ 2004-03/Rel-6/25_series/25213-600.zip). The UE<br>
knows about the primary scrambling code either by information sent from the network<br>
on system information of neighbouring cells that the UE has read, by messages that the<br>
UE has received on the DCCH channel, or by searching for the P-CPICH, which is<br>
sent using the fixed SF 256, the spreading code number 0 and which transmits a fixed<br>
pattern.<br>
[124]	The system information comprises information on neighbouring cells, configuration<br>
of the RACH and FACH transport channels, and the configuration of MICH and<br>
MCCH which are channels that are dedicated channels for the MBMS service.<br>
[125]	Each time the UE is changing the cell, it is camping (in idle mode) or when the UE<br>
has selected the cell (in CELL_FACH, CELL_PCH or URA_PCH states), the UE<br><br>
16<br>
WO 2006/104346	PCT/KR2006/001145<br>
verifies that it has valid system information. The system information is organized in<br>
SIBs (system information blocks), a MIB (Master information block) and scheduling<br>
blocks. The MIB is sent very frequently and gives timing information of the scheduling<br>
blocks and the different SIBs. For SIBs that are linked to a value tag, the MIB also<br>
contains information on the last version of a part of the SIBs. SIBs that are not linked<br>
to a value tag are linked to an expiration timer. SIBs linked to an expiration timer<br>
become invalid and have to be reread if the time of the last reading of the SIB is bigger<br>
than this timer value. SIBs linked to a value tag are only valid if they have the same<br>
value tag as the one broadcast in the MIB. Each block has an area scope of validity<br>
(Cell, Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) or equivalent PLMN areas) which signif<br>
ies on which cells the SIB is valid. A SIB with area scope Cell is valid only for the cell<br>
in which it has been read. A SIB with area scope PLMN is valid in the whole PLMN<br>
and a SIB with the area scope equivalent PLMN is valid in the whole PLMN and<br>
equivalent PLMN.<br>
[126]	In general UEs read the system information when they are in idle mode,<br>
CELL_FACH state, CELL_PCH state or in URA_PCH state of the cells that they have<br>
selected or the cell that they are camping on. In the system information, they receive<br>
information on the neighbouring cells on the same frequency, different frequencies and<br>
different RAT (Radio access technologies). This allows the UE to know which cells<br>
are candidate for cell reselection.<br>
[127]	As mentioned previously, MBMS data can be split in two categories: control plane<br>
information and user plane information. The control plane information notably<br>
contains information on:<br>
[128]	* Physical layer configuration ;<br>
[129]	* Transport channel configuration ;<br>
[130]	* Radio bearer configuration ;<br>
[131]	* Ongoing services ;<br>
[132]	* Counting information ;<br>
[133]	* Scheduling information.<br>
[134]	In order to allow UEs to receive this information, MBMS bearer specific control in-<br>
formation for MBMS is sent.<br>
[ 135] The user plane data of MBMS bearers can be mapped onto dedicated transport<br>
channels for a point-to-point service which is sent only to one UE or on a shared<br>
transport channel for point to multipoint service which is transmitted to (received by)<br>
several users at the same time.<br>
[136]	Point-to-point transmission is used to transfer MBMS specific control/user plane in-<br>
formation as well as dedicated control/user plane information between the network and<br>
a single UE in RRC Connected Mode. It is used only for the multicast mode of<br><br>
17<br>
WO 2006/104346	PCT/KR2006/001145<br>
MBMS. For a UE in CELL_FACH or Cell_DCH states, DTCH is used, allowing all<br>
existing mappings to transport channels.<br>
[137]	Point-to-multipoint transmission (PtM) is used to transfer MBMS specific control/<br>
user plane information between the network and several UEs in RRC Connected or<br>
Idle Mode. It is used for broadcast or multicast mode of MBMS.<br>
[138]	The MBMS point-to-multipoint Control Channel (MCCH) logical channel is used<br>
for a PtM downlink transmission of control plane information between network and<br>
UEs in RRC Connected or Idle Mode. The control plane information on MCCH is<br>
MBMS specific and is sent to UEs in a cell with an activated MBMS service. MCCH<br>
can be sent in S-CCPCH carrying the DCCH of the UEs in CELL_FACH state, or in<br>
standalone S-CCPCH, or in the same S-CCPCH with MTCH.<br>
[139]	The MCCH is always mapped to one specific FACH in the S-CCPCH as indicated<br>
on the BCCH. In case of soft combining, the MCCH is mapped to a different S-<br>
CCPCH (CCTrCH in Time Division Duplexing (TDD)) than MTCH. Reception of<br>
paging has priority over reception of MCCH for Idle mode and URA/CELL_PCH<br>
UEs.<br>
[140]	The configuration of the MCCH (modification period, repetition period etc.) is conf<br>
igured in the system information sent on the BCCH channel.<br>
[141]	The MBMS point-to-multipoint Traffic Channel (MTCH) logical channel is used<br>
for a PtM downlink transmission of user plane information between network and UEs<br>
in RRC Connected or Idle Mode. The user plane information on MTCH is MBMS<br>
Service specific and is sent to UEs in a cell with an activated MBMS service. The<br>
MTCH is always mapped to one specific FACH in the S-CCPCH as indicated on the<br>
MCCH.<br>
[142]	The MBMS point-to-multipoint Scheduling Channel (MSCH) logical channel is<br>
used for a PtM downlink transmission of MBMS service transmission schedule<br>
between network and UEs in RRC Connected or Idle Mode. The control plane in-<br>
formation on MSCH is MBMS service and S-CCPCH specific and is sent to UEs in a<br>
cell receiving MTCH. One MSCH is sent in each S-CCPCH carrying the MTCH.<br>
[143]	The MSCH is mapped to one specific FACH in the S-CCPCH, as indicated on the<br>
MCCH. Due to different error requirements the MSCH is mapped to a different FACH<br>
than MTCH.<br>
[144]	FACH is used as a transport channel for MTCH, MSCH and MCCH. S-CCPCH is<br>
used as physical channel for FACH carrying MTCH, MCCH or MSCH. As shown in<br>
figures 6 and 7 (respectively from the UE and UTRAN sides), for the downlink, the<br>
following connections between logical channels and transport channels exist: MCCH,<br>
MTCH and MSCH can be mapped to FACH.<br>

mapped to FACH uses the UM-RLC mode, with required enhancements to support out<br>
of sequence SDU delivery. A MAC header is used for logical channel type iden-<br>
tification. The data flow for MTCH mapped to FACH uses the UM-RLC mode, with<br>
required enhancements to support selective combining. Quick repeat may be used in<br>
RLC-UM. A MAC header is used for logical channel type identification and MBMS<br>

[146]	MBMS notification utilizes a new MBMS specific PICH called MBMS Notification<br>
Indicator Channel (MICH) in cell. The exact coding is defined in Stage-3 physical<br>
layer specifications.<br>
[147]	The MCCH information is transmitted based on a fixed schedule. This schedule will<br>
identify the TTI (Transmission Time interval, i.e. multiple of frames) containing the<br>
beginning of the MCCH information. The transmission of this information can take a<br>
variable number of TTIs and the UTRAN should transmit MCCH information in<br>
consecutive TTIs. The UE will keep receiving the S-CCPCH until:<br>
[148]	-It receives all of the MCCH information, or<br>
[149]	-It receives a TTI that does not include any MCCH data, or<br>
[150]	-The information contents indicate that further reception is not required (e.g. no<br>
modification to the desired service information).<br>
[151]	Based on this behaviour, the UTRAN can repeat the MCCH information following<br>
a scheduled transmission in order to improve reliability. The MCCH schedule is<br>
common for all services.<br>
[152]	The entire MCCH information is transmitted periodically based on a repetition<br>
period. The modification period is defined as an integer multiple of the repetition<br>
period. The MBMS ACCESS INFORMATION may be transmitted periodically based<br>
on an access information period. This period will be an integer divider of the repetition<br>
period. The values for the repetition and modification periods are given in the system<br>
information of the cell in which MBMS is sent.<br>
[153]	MCCH information is split into critical and non-critical information. The critical<br>
information is made up of the MBMS NEIGHBOURING CELL INFORMATION,<br>
MBMS SERVICE INFORMATION and MBMS RADIO BEARER INFORMATION.<br>
The non-critical information corresponds to the MBMS ACCESS INFORMATION.<br>
Changes to critical information will only be applied at the first MCCH transmission of<br>
a modification period and in the beginning of each modification period. UTRAN<br>
transmits the MBMS CHANGE INFORMATION including MBMS services identi-<br>
fications whose MCCH information is modified at that modification period. MBMS<br>
CHANGE INFORMATION is repeated at least once in each repetition period of that<br>
modification period. Changes to non-critical information could take place at any time.<br><br>

WO 2006/104346	PCT/KR2006/001145<br>
[154]	Figure 8 illustrates the schedule with which the MBMS SERVICE IN-<br>
FORMATION and RADIO BEARER INFORMATION is transmitted. Different<br>
patterns indicate potentially different MCCH content.<br>
[155]	In order to increase the coverage, a UE which is located between different cells can<br>
receive the same MBMS services from different cells at the same time, and combine<br>
the received information as shown in Figure 9. In this case, the UE reads the MCCH<br>
from one control cell that it has selected based on a certain algorithm.<br>
[156]	On this MCCH from the selected cell (e.g. A-B), in the figure, the UE receives in-<br>
formation on a service that the UE is interested in. This information contains the in-<br>
formation on the configuration of the physical channels, the transport channels, the<br>
RLC configuration, the PDCP configuration etc in the control cell, and on the<br>
neighbouring cells that the UE might be able to receive (e.g. cell A-A and cell B). In<br>
other words, the information refers to what the UE needs in order to receive the MTCH<br>
carrying the service that the UE is interested in cell A-A, A-B and B.<br>
[157]	When the same service is transported on different cells, the UE may or may not be<br>
able to combine the service from the different cells at different levels:<br>
[158]	No combining possible,<br>
[159]	Selective combining at RLC level,<br>
[160]	L1 combining at physical level.<br>
[161]	The selective combining for MBMS PtM transmission is supported by RLC PDU<br>
numbering. Therefore, the selective combining in the UE is possible from cells<br>
providing similar MBMS RB bit rate, provided that the de-synchronization between<br>
MBMS PtM transmission streams does not exceed the RLC re-ordering capability of<br>
the UE. Thus, there exists one RLC entity in the UE side. For selective combining<br>
there exists one RLC entity per MBMS service utilizing PtM transmission in the cell<br>
group of the CRNC. All cells in the cell group are under the same CRNC. In case de-<br>
synchronization occurs between MBMS transmissions in neighbouring cells belonging<br>
to an MBMS cell group, the CRNC may perform re-synchronization actions enabling<br>
UEs to perform the selective combining between these cells.<br>
[162]	For TDD, selective combining and soft combining can be used when Node-Bs are<br>
synchronised. For FDD, soft combining can be used when Node-Bs are synchronized<br>
inside the UE soft combining reception window, and the data fields of the soft<br>
combined S-CCPCHs are identical during soft combining moments.<br>
[163]	When selective or soft combining is available between cells, the UTRAN sends<br>
MBMS NEIGHBOURING CELL INFORMATION containing the MTCH con-<br>
figuration of the neighbouring cells, available for selective or soft combining. When<br>
partial soft combining is applied, the MBMS NEIGHBOURING CELL IN-<br>
FORMATION contains the L1-combining schedule, which indicates the time moments<br><br>
20<br>
WO 2006/104346	PCT/KR2006/001145<br>
when the UE may soft combine the S-CCPCH transmitted in neighbouring cells with<br>
the S-CCPCH transmitted in the serving cell. With MBMS NEIGHBOURING CELL<br>
INFORMATION the UE is able to receive MTCH transmission from neighbouring cell<br>
without reception of the MCCH of these neighbouring cells.<br>
[164]	The UE determines the neighbouring cell suitable for selective or soft combining<br>
based on a threshold (e.g. measured CPICH Ec/No) and the presence of MBMS<br>
NEIGHBOURING CELL INFORMATION of that neighbour cell.<br>
[165] The possibility of performing selective or soft combining is signalled to the UE.<br>
[166] The invention proposes to transmit a message including validity information<br>
through a control cell to the UE. The UE may use this validity information to derive<br>
the validity timing of the configuration information of the physical channels of the<br>
control cell and of the neighbouring cell. Alternately, the configuration validity timing<br>
may be derived by the UE based on predefined configuration validity rules, used both<br>
by the cells and the network.<br>
[167]	Figure 13 illustrates a session start in neighbouring cells. In figure 13, the service<br>
starts simultaneously in two neighbouring cells. However, due to the non alignment of<br>
the modification periods between the cells A and B, the configuration of the service S<br>
used in NodeB A (configuration S-A) and in the NodeB B (configuration S-B) is not<br>
broadcast at the same time.<br>
[168]	When the control cell is NodeB A, no known solution indicates when the con-<br>
figuration of the MTCH of the NodeB B is valid. Indicating the configuration S-B in<br>
the modification period 1A is not possible since the UE cannot listen to a channel that<br>
is not yet configured and thus, the reception will not be possible. The transmission of<br>
the configuration of the service S on the NodeB B is delayed until the modification<br>
period 2A, where the configuration of NodeB B is received by UEs listening to the<br>
MCCH of NodeB A. This delays the start of the transmission by half a modification<br>
period in average.<br>
[169]	In the case of a reconfiguration of a service sent on different NodeBs, in addition to<br>
the problem of UEs entering a cell, the same problems as in the case of the session start<br>
exists: a UE entering the cell where the new configuration is broadcast for the first<br>
time will not be able to receive the ongoing session.<br>
[170]	In addition, the known signalling is problematic for the UEs that are already<br>
receiving the ongoing service on the cell they are camping on and on neighbouring<br>
cells. If the modification periods of the NodeB A and of the NodeB B are not aligned,<br>
such a signalling does not indicate the correct configuration of the MTCH of the<br>
neighbouring NodeB B by the current NodeB A at a given instant.<br>
[171]	The determination of a correct configuration for the MTCH of the neighbouring<br>
cells at a given time moment is problematic. In the case the synchronisation needs to<br><br>
21<br>
WO 2006/104346	PCT/KR2006/001145<br>
be maintained, a derivable solution would be to update the system information in order<br>
to change the offset of the modification period. This procedure is heavy (burdensome)<br>
and would imply that all UEs in the cell wake up and re-read the system information.<br>
[172]	A first case of reconfiguration of a neighbouring cell is illustrated in the example at<br>
figure 14. The configuration S-A2 is sent in the modification period 1A on the NodeB<br>
A (since the configuration will change in the control cell NodeB A). For the<br>
neighbouring cell, the configuration S-Bl is sent by the MCCH of NodeB A during the<br>
modification period 1A. In this case, the UE supposes that the configuration of the<br>
service S is not changed during the next modification period.<br>
[173] Without further information, since the modification periods of the NodeB B and of<br>
the NodeB A are not aligned, and since changes can only occur at borders of mod-<br>
ification periods, the UE would use the wrong configuration.<br>
[174]	In the example illustrated at figure 15, another case of reconfiguration of a<br>
neighbouring cell is shown. The configuration S-A2 is sent in the modification period<br>
1A on the NodeB A (since the configuration will change in the control cell). For the<br>
neighbouring cell, the configuration S-B2 is sent during the modification period 2A of<br>
the NodeB A. In this case, the UE may suppose that the configuration of the MTCH is<br>
changed during the next modification period.<br>
[175]	Without further information, since the modification periods of the NodeB B are not<br>
aligned, and since changes can only occur at borders of modification periods, the UE<br>
would use the wrong configuration during the time indicated in Figure 15.<br>
[176]	To overcome the problem of the service reconfiguration timing for a user<br>
equipment receiving a MBMS service from neighbouring cells, the invention proposes<br>
to indicate the validity of the physical channels carrying point-to-multipoint service<br>
data in a wireless communication system by the control cell and the neighbouring cell<br>
in the following way. A message comprising configuration information for each of said<br>
channels is generated by the control cell. This message includes validity information<br>
which can be used by the UE to derive the validity timing of the configuration for each<br>
of said channels. The message is then transmitted to a UE.<br>
[177]	This information allows the UE to derive a configuration validity timing for a given<br>
service transmitted by the neighbouring cells. The right configuration of the service<br>
transmitted by the neighbouring cells may then be used by the UE with a limited offset.<br>
[178]	The validity timing information may indicate whether a configuration for a physical<br>
channel, such as an SCCPCH, carrying MBMS services is valid during a current mod-<br>
ification period or longer, after a given activation time, or up to a given activation time.<br>
Thus, the problem of a mobile terminal trying to use an invalid physical channel con-<br>
figuration from one of the neighbouring cell is avoided. As such, the validity timing<br>
may also be referred to as a timing indication.<br><br>
22<br>
WO 2006/104346	PCT/KR2006/001145<br>
[179]	Namely, the present invention provides a method for receiving a point-to-multipoint<br>
service, comprising: receiving a point-to-multipoint service related control message<br>
during a current period; determining whether timing indication exists or not in the<br>
received control message; and if timing indication does not exist, performing con-<br>
figuration of a physical channel for receiving point-to-multipoint service data at a next<br>
period, whereby information for performing the configuration is included in the<br>
received control message, if timing indication exists, performing configuration of a<br>
physical channel for receiving point-to-multipoint service data according to the timing<br>
indication, whereby information for performing the configuration is included in the<br>
received control message.<br>
[180]	Also, the present invention provides a method for providing a point-to-multipoint<br>
service, comprising: generating a point-to-multipoint service related control message<br>
based upon a validity of a physical channel, the control message includes information<br>
for performing configuration of the physical channel and optionally includes timing<br>
indication; sending the control message during a current period to allow a mobile<br>
terminal to perform configuration of the physical channel at a next period or according<br>
to the timing indication; and transmitting point-to-multipoint service data to the mobile<br>
terminal via the configured physical channel.<br>
[181]	Here, the timing indication may comprises a system frame number that indicates the<br>
start of the frame at which point-to-multipoint radio bearer reconfiguration is to be<br>
performed. Or the timing indication may comprise the least significant bits of the<br>
system frame number (SFN) that indicates the start of the frame at which point-<br>
to-multipoint radio bearer reconfiguration is to be performed. Or the timing indication<br>
may comprise the number of frames or transmission time intervals after the end of the<br>
current period that indicates the start of the frame at which point-to-multipoint radio<br>
bearer reconfiguration is to be performed.<br>
[182]	Alternatively, the timing indication may refer to a multimedia broadcast multicast<br>
service (MBMS) point-to-multipoint (p-t-m) activation time. The MBMS p-t-m<br>
activation time is an Information Element (IE) comprised of the 11 least significant<br>
bits (LSB) of the SFN. Here, the MBMS p-t-m activation time indicates the start of the<br>
10 ms frame corresponding to the indicated SFN value and of the primary CCPCH of<br>
the cell where this IE is transmitted. Also, the range of the MBMS p-t-m activation<br>
time is from 10 ms after the beginning of the MCCH modification period wherein it is<br>
transmitted and to the end of next following MCCH modification period. The UE shall<br>
consider a value out of this range as expired.<br>
[183]	In the present invention method, the steps may be performed when combining data<br>
from a current cell and one or more neighboring cells. Here, the step of combining data<br>
may comprise selective combining and soft combining. The steps may be performed<br><br>
23<br>
WO 2006/104346	PCT/KR2006/001145<br>
when a point-to-multipoint service starts in the current cell. The steps may be<br>
performed when a reconfiguration of a point-to-multipoint service in the current cell<br>
occurs. The steps may be performed when a session start in neighboring cells occurs.<br>
The steps may be performed when a reconfiguration in neighboring cells occurs. The<br>
current period and the next period may be modification periods. The start of each mod-<br>
ification period may indicate that control information for the point-to-multipoint<br>
service is modified. During each modification period, control information for the<br>
point-to-multipoint service may be repeatedly received. The control message may be<br>
received via a point-to-multipoint control channel. The physical channel may be a<br>
Secondary Common Control Physical Channel.<br>
[184]	Preferably, a currently valid configuration for a neighbouring cell is transmitted and<br>
the validity information indicates to the mobile terminal that this configuration is valid<br>
during a current modification period. Thus, when the validity information is received<br>
during the current modification period, the mobile terminal is informed that the<br>
SCCPCH configuration is currently valid on the corresponding MTCH and may be<br>
used upon reading the configuration information. Alternatively, the validity in-<br>
formation may indicate to the mobile terminal that the configuration information for a<br>
neighbouring cell is valid either after a given activation time or until a given activation<br>
time. Accordingly, once having read the validity information, the mobile terminal<br>
knows exactly how long to receive the MTCH using the corresponding configuration<br>
information.<br>
[185]	Additionally, two configurations may be transmitted for a given service and the cor-<br>
responding cell during a same modification period in case the configuration is<br>
modified: the currently valid configuration and the next valid configuration to be used<br>
after the reconfiguration. Flags may indicate which configuration is currently valid and<br>
which configuration will become valid.<br>
[186] This configuration validity timing information may be linked to the start or to the<br>
end of a modification period during which the configuration is received. This validity<br>
timing information may be linked to the modification period of the control cell or from<br>
its neighbouring cell. The right modification period may either be derived by the UE<br>
from the validity information based on predefined rules or by an additional<br>
transmission to the UE by the RNC on MCCH of the control cell.<br>
[187]	The information for deriving the validity timing may also be an indication of a<br>
given modification period, during which the configuration validity starts. This in-<br>
formation may also include an offset, for example a number defining a frame or TTT<br>
count. The configuration validity then starts at the offset timing after the beginning of<br>
the defined modification period.<br>
[188]	The information from which the validity timing of the configurations is derived,<br><br>
24<br>
WO 2006/104346	PCT/KR2006/001145<br>
may be a reference to a SFN timing, starting from which the configurations will be<br>
valid. The message generated by a given cell may include a validity reference to the<br>
SFN timing of each of the neighbouring cells. The information may also include some<br>
of the least significant bits of the SFN timing of a given cell, so that the validity timing<br>
may start at an intermediate portion of the SFN timing.<br>
[189] Validity timing information may be carried on the MCCH logical channel of the<br>
control cell. Validity timing information may be included in control messages like a<br>
MBMS Modified services Information message or a MBMS Unmodified services In-<br>
formation message transmitted on the MCCH logical channel.<br>
[190]	Otherwise, a special signalling may be transmitted to the UE to provide it with in-<br>
formation indicating that there was no reconfiguration in the former modification<br>
period if the service is listed in a message MBMS Unmodified Services information. In<br>
this case, the configuration received during the current modification period can be used<br>
immediately, for instance at the beginning of the next frame or TTI of the MTCH of<br>
the neighbouring cells.<br>
[191]	In the case the service is listed in a MBMS Modified services Information message,<br>
a currently valid configuration for the associated cell may also be sent, so that a UE<br>
just entering this neighbouring cell can determine that it can start receiving the service<br>
provided by this cell immediately using this valid configuration. The start may be syn-<br>
chronised with the beginning of the next frame or TTI of the MTCH of this<br>
neighbouring cell.<br>
[192]	Information may also be provided for the SCCPCH of each neighbouring cell,<br>
indicating whether the configuration has changed or not. This information may be<br>
detailed for each service and/or for each neighbouring cell.<br>
[193]	The use of the MBMS control messages may be the following:<br>
[194]	The MBMS Modified Services Information message may comprise an element<br>
named MBMS PtM Activation time defining a timing starting from which a new<br>
service configuration is valid.<br>
[195]	For the control cell, the UE reads the MBMS Modified Services Information<br>
(MMSI) message during the modification period of its reception and checks whether a<br>
given service is listed in the message. If said service is listed in the MMSI message, the<br>
corresponding configuration of the control cell broadcast for this service on MCCH<br>
will only be used starting from the next modification period. The UE will then use a<br>
formerly received configuration until the beginning of the next modification period.<br>
The UE also reads the MBMS Unmodified Services Information (MUSI) message<br>
during the modification period of its reception. If said service is listed in the MUSI<br>
message, the corresponding configuration will be considered valid and the UE can start<br>
the reception of the control cell MTCH as soon as the UE has received all necessary in-<br><br>
25<br>
WO 2006/104346	PCT/KR2006/001145<br>
formation.<br>
[196]	Then, if a UE moves or is switched on in a cell in which a reconfiguration is<br>
ongoing, if it has not formerly received the configuration, it shall not start the service<br>
reception on the control cell if this service is listed in the MMSI message.<br>
[197]	To overcome this problem, the currently valid configuration may also be<br>
transmitted and flagged as currently valid. The currently valid configuration can then<br>
be used immediately for the control cell service reception.<br>
[198] If a service is listed in the MMSI message because it is changed in a neighbouring<br>
cell, if this service is not modified in the control cell, the UE may read information<br>
indicating that the control cell configuration is valid and may then immediately use this<br>
configuration for the control cell. This information may be an indicator specifying each<br>
valid or modified configuration and may be inserted at the message level of the control<br>
cell or at the SCCPCH level. This may be especially useful in the case where only the<br>
MBMS MAC identification is changed.<br>
[199]	If the UE uses predefined rules to determine which configuration is valid at the<br>
beginning of a modification period, as an exception, the order of the received validity<br>
information may be taken into account, in order to determine if a configuration was<br>
modified or not. Thus, a valid configuration period may be used by the UE before<br>
waiting for the beginning of the next modification period in certain cases. For instance,<br>
any configuration sent after a MUSI will be considered as unchanged for this service<br>
and will be considered valid at the moment it is read and the UE will start using this<br>
configuration immediately, even if this service was listed as modified in a MMSI<br>
message.<br>
[200]	Figure 16 illustrates an example of a MCCH message succession for which the<br>
exception rules may be applied. For instance, the message 164 defines the con-<br>
figurations of the services S-T-U for the neighbouring cell. This message follows the<br>
MUSI message 163. Thus, all the configurations indicated in message 164 are im-<br>
mediately valid for the neighbouring cell, even if configurations of these services for<br>
control cell were given in message 162 after the MMSI message 161.<br>
[201]	Figure 17 illustrates an example of service start in the control cell. The validity in-<br>
formation provided to the UE defines a number of TTIs, a number of frames or a SFN<br>
reference defining an offset from the beginning of the control cell modification period.<br>
Services S and T on MTCH are started with the given configuration at this time offset<br>
after the end of the modification period where the service configuration information<br>
was received. This information may be provided on MCCH in the same modification<br>
period as the information about the services for which transmission on PtM bearer<br>
starts or as general information on system information.<br>
[202]	Otherwise, the validity information may indicate whether the configuration of the<br><br>
26<br>
WO 2006/104346	PCT/KR2006/001145<br>
services on node A is already valid during the current modification period.<br>
[203]	Figure 18 illustrates a control cell service reconfiguration. In the modification<br>
period 2A, service S is indicated as a changed service (it is listed in the message<br>
MBMS Modified services information for instance), and the new configuration S2 is<br>
transmitted (for instance in one of the MBMS Control cell PtM Rb Information,<br>
MBMS General Information or MBMS PtM Rb Information message). In order to<br>
prevent the UE from using configuration S2 at the wrong timing, validity information<br>
define that this configuration S2 shall only be used starting from the next modification<br>
period. If the UE had configuration S1 before receiving configuration S2, the validity<br>
information may define that the UE has to use this configuration S1 until the end of the<br>
current modification period. Configuration S1 is also sent during the modification<br>
period 2A, so that a UE entering the control cell may immediately use this con-<br>
figuration without waiting for the beginning of the next modification period.<br>
Respective tags identify the currently valid configuration (unchanged configuration)<br>
and the next valid configuration (changed configuration).<br>
[204] For the neighbouring cell, the following solutions are proposed.<br>
[205]	As illustrated in figure 14, if a service is listed in a MMSI message during mod-<br>
ification period 1A, the UE uses the modified configuration on the neighbouring cell<br>
only in the second modification period 3A after the modification period where the<br>
MMSI message was received. The UE uses a formerly received configuration for the<br>
transmission on NodeB B until the end of the modification period 1A. The UE stops<br>
the reception on NodeB B during the modification period 2A, to avoid any NodeB B<br>
configuration error during this period. If said service configuration is listed in the<br>
MUSI message during modification period 2A, the configuration on the neighbouring<br>
cell is considered valid starting from the next modification period 3A, since there<br>
might have been a reconfiguration before.<br>
[206]	Another solution is to broadcast the modification periods of MCCH of NodeB B on<br>
the MCCH of NodeB A, such that the UE can use NodeB B MTCH configuration<br>
changes at the borders of the modification periods of the NodeB B. If a service is listed<br>
in the MMSI message during the modification period 1A in figure 15, the UE will use<br>
the new configuration on the neighbouring cell only from the beginning of the mod-<br>
ification period on NodeB B (2B) after the end of the modification period on NodeB A<br>
in which the new configuration was received (1 A). If said service configuration is<br>
listed in the MUSI message during modification period 2A, the neighbouring cell<br>
service configuration is considered valid from the beginning of the modification period<br>
in NodeB B (2B) during the modification period (2A) in which it has been received in<br>
NodeB A, since there might have been a reconfiguration before.<br>
[207]	For each neighbouring cell that is reconfigured, the information may indicate an<br><br>
27<br>
WO 2006/104346	PCT/KR2006/001145<br>
SFN related to the control cell or the neighbouring cell from which or up to which the<br>
neighbouring cell reconfiguration is valid. Thus, the beginning or the end of validity of<br>
a configuration may be taken into account very accurately.<br>
[208] If a service is listed in the MUSI message during a modification period (for instance<br>
2A in Figure 15), additional information may be sent to the UE to indicate that there<br>
was no reconfiguration in the former modification period, so that the UE may use said<br>
service configuration immediately.<br>
[209] If a service is listed in the MMSI message, the currently valid configuration may<br>
also be transmitted to the UE, so that it may start receiving the service with this con-<br>
figuration if it enters the corresponding cell.<br>
[210]	The validity information may also include a configuration information change<br>
indicator for each neighbouring cell and/or service.<br>
[211]	The order of the received validity information may also be taken into account, in<br>
order to determine if a configuration was modified or not. For instance, any con-<br>
figuration listed in a MUSI will be considered as unchanged for this service and will be<br>
considered valid at the moment it is read or at the beginning of the next modification<br>
period of NodeB B after the end of the reading modification period in NodeB B or<br>
from the second modification period on NodeB A.<br>
[212]	The configuration information used by a given service for PtM transmission may<br>
notably relate to the following configurations:<br>
[213]	-S-CCPCH configuration,<br>
[214]	-Transport channel configuration,<br>
[215]	-MAC configuration,<br>
[216]	-PDCP configuration,<br>
[217]	-RLC configuration.<br>
[218] The present invention provides a method for receiving a point-to-multipoint service,<br>
comprising: receiving, from a network, information indicating a validity of a physical<br>
channel that carries point-to-multipoint service data; determining an appropriate time<br>
for configuring the physical channel based upon the received information; configuring<br>
the physical channel according to at least one of the determined timing and a con-<br>
figuration; and receiving the point-to-multipoint service data via the configured<br>
physical channel.<br>
