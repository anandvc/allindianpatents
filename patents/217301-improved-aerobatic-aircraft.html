				<td>Field Of The Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an improved acrobatic aircraft which utilizes two engines, where one engine is located in the nose portion of the fuselage and the second engine is located in the tail portion of the fuselage,<br>
Background Of The Invention<br>
Conventional acrobatic aircraft utilize a variety of aircraft designs and engine designs. For example, acrobatic aircraft designed by Curtis Pilts are single engine, biwing aircraft using tube/fabric construction. The Beech T 34A Mentor is a .single engine, low wing, all metal, monoplane. The Decathlons arc lu.be/fabrie aircraft with strut-braced high wings. The Russian YAK-52 utilizes a single radial piston engine. Although these prior art acrobatic aircraft utilize a variety of wing designs, engine designs, and construction techniques, they all utilize a single engine.<br>
A critical parameter in the performance of an aerobatic aircraft is its power to weight ratio. In order to perform vertical aerobatic maneuvers, an aerobatic aircraft necessarily needs to have available a large amount of power. An aircraft engine's power output increases us the number of cylinders and the size of those cylinders increase. A practical limit is reached, however, because an incremental percentage increase in engine power requires a greater incremental percentage increase in the engine's weight. Thus, increasing an aerobatic aircraft's power by using a larger engine results in a decreased power loading, i.e. horsepower per pound.<br>
It is known in the art to use power from a turbine engines drive to turn a propeller. Although these "turboprop" combinations can achieve greater horsepower for a given weight than can piston engines, these turboprop powerplants do not fare well in aerobatic aircraft use. Such aircraft have acceptable vertical flight capabilities. However, such powerplants give unacceptable snap maneuvers due to their circular engine mounts.<br>
What is needed is an aerobatic aircraft having increased power but a reduced power loading. Such an improved aerobatic aircraft would have both enhanced vertical maneuver capability and enhanced snap maneuver capability. Unlike prior art aerobatic aircraft, Applicant's invention utilizes a twin engine design with the first engine located in the nose portion of the aircraft's fuselage and the second engine located in the tail<br>
portion of the fuselage. Using this configuration, greater horsepower is available without sacrificing aircraft aerobatic performance.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Applicants' novel invention comprises an improved acrobatic aircraft design which utilizes two engines. A first engine is disposed with the nose portion of the fuselage and a second engine is disposed within the tail portion of that fuselage. Each engine has sufficient power to safely allow the aircraft to takeoff, maintain altitude, and land. Therefore, even if one engine were to fail during takeoff, Applicant's aerobatic aircraft would have sufficient power to continue that takeoff, safely navigate the traffic pattern, and safely land.<br>
In addition, Ihe thrust components of the two engines are coaxial along the long axis of the fuselage. Therefore, in the unlikely event one engine fails in flight, there is no change in the direction of the resulting thrust vector. Thus, even if an engine were to fail during an acrobatic maneuver, the pilot could safely complete that aerobatic maneuver, and then safely return to an airport and safely land.<br>
Applicant's invention further includes an oil system which operates in any aircraft orientation, i.e. upright, inverted, or vertical. This oil system uses two oil pumps which receive oil from opposite sides of the engines.<br>

Applicant's invention includes an oil system which provides an uninterrupted supply of oil to both first engine 18 and second engine 22 during acrobatic maneuvers of the aircraft. Such an oil system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,531,358 which is hereby incorporated by reference. In conventional oil supply systems, oil starvation occurs when the aircraft takes up an inverted attitude because the oil in the oil tank falls away from the pump inlet preventing the oil pump from supplying oil to the engine. Two potentially catastrophic effects can occur. First, engine components can fail due to the lack of lubrication. Second, the cooling effect of the circulating oil is; removed resulting in greatly increased engine temperatures which can lead to an oil fire when the normal flow of oil resumes.<br>
Referring 10 FIG. 6, Applicant's invention includes a first oil supply system which includes first oil pump 122 connected to oil tank 124, such that first oil pump 122 circulates oil to first engine 18 via first oil inlet 138, Similarly, first oil pump 122 is connected to second engine 22 via first oil inlet 144. The oil pump of choice is u gear pump. First oil pump 122 supplies oil to both engines when the aircraft is in a first, i.e. upright, position.<br>
In addition, Applicant's invention includes second oil pump 120 connected to oil tank 124 such that second oil pump 120 circulates oil to first engine 18 via second oil inlet 140. Second oil inlet 140 may be in any area of first engine 18, preferably opposite first oil inlet 138 both axially and circumfcrenlially so that the oil in the engine automatically migrates to second oil inlet ]40 when the aircraft maneuvers so as to take the oil away from first oil inlet 138. Similarly, second oil pump 120 is connected to second engine 22 via second oil inlet 142. Second oil inlet 142 may be in any area of second engine 22, preferably opposite first oil inlet 144 both axially and circumfercntially so that the oil in the engine automatically migrates to second oil inlet 142 when the aircraft maneuvers so as to take the oil away from first oil inlet 144. Second oil pump 120 supplies oil to both engines when the aircraft is in a second, i.e. inverted, position.<br>
In a separate embodiment, Applicant's aircraft includes a separate oil system for each engine. Each of these two oil systems includes two oil pumps, and is configured as discussed above with the exception that each oil system only supplies oil to one of QIC two engines.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, first engine 18 produces first thrust component 1 ] 0, Second engine 22 produces second thrust component 112. First engine 18 and second engine 22 are disposed within fuselage 12 such that first thrust component 110 and second thrust component 112 are coaxial along long axis 70. As those skilled in the art will appreciate, first thrust component 110 and second thrust component 112 are vectors, each of which can be characterized by both direction and magnitude. First thrust component 110 and second thrust component 112 are symmetrical about long axis 70.<br>
FIG. 5 depicts aggregate thrust component 114 which comprises the vector addition of first thrust component 110 and second thrust component 112. Aggregate thrust component 114 is also symmetrical about long axis 70. Because first thrust component 110 und second thrust component 112 are coaxial, aggregate thrust component 114 has the identical vector direction as do first thrust component 110 and second thrust component 112 individually. In a separate embodiment, aggregate thrust component 114 also passes directly through center of gravity point 116.<br>
Either first engine 18 or second engine 22 individually provide sufficient power to allow aircraft 10 to takeoff, maintain altitude, and/or land safely. In the event either first engine 18 or second engine 22 should fail during an acrobatic maneuver, there will be change in the direction of the aircraft's remaining thrust component. Thus, control of the aircraft during an acrobatic maneuver will not be diminished because of an engine failure. Moreover, because the remaining engine has sufficient power to safely complete the acrobatic maneuver in progress, Applicant's invention provides a measure of safety heretofore unavailable to both acrobatic pilots and spectators.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
