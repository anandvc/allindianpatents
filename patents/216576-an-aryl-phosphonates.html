Field of the Invention<br>
This invention ^elates to novel aiyl containing compounds that possess a phosphonate group that ar^ inhibitors of Fructose-l,6-bispliospiiatase. Itie invention also relates to the preparation and use of these compounds in the treatment of diabetes, and other diseases where the inhibition of gluconeogenesis, control of blood glucose levels, reduction in glycogen storage, or reduction in insulin levels is beneficial.<br>
Backgyouiid and Introduction to the Invention<br>
â– The following description of the background of the invention is provided to aid in understanding the invention, but is not admitted to be, or to describe, prior art to the invention. All cited pubHcations are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.<br><br>
Diabetes melHtus (or diabetes) is one of the most prevalent diseases in the world today. Diabetic patients have been divided into two classes, namely type I or insnlin-dependent diabetes jnellitu^ and type H or non-insulin dependent diabetes melhtus (NIDDM). NIDDM accounts for approximately 90% of all diabetics and is estimated to affect 12-14 million adults in. theU. S. alone {6.6% of thepopnlation). NEDDM is characterized by both fasting hyperglycerhia and exaggerated postprandial increases in    " plasma glucose levels. NEDDM is associated with a variety of long-term complications, including microvascular diseases such as retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy, and macrovascular diseases such as coronary heart disease. Numerous studies in animal models demonstrate a causal relationship between long term hyperglycemia and complications. Results fi-omthe Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and the StocMiokn Prospective Study demonstrate this.Telationship for the first time in jnan by showing that insulin-dependent diabetics with tighter glycemic control are at substantially lower risk for the development and progression of these complications. Titter control is also expected to benefit NIDDM patients..<br><br><br>
WO 01/66553	PCT/USOl/07452<br>
Current therapies used to treat NIDDM patients entail both controIling lifestyle risk factors and pharmaceutical intervention. First-hne therapy for NIDDM is typically a tightly-controlled regimen of diet, and exercise since" an overwhelming number of NIDDM patients are overweight or obese (67%) and since weight loss can improve insulin secretion,, insulin sensitivity and lead to normoglycemia. Normalization of blood glucose occurs in less than 30% of these patients due to poor compliance and poor response. Patients with hyperglycemia not controlled by diet alone are subsequently treated with oral hypoglycemics or insuhn. Until recently, the sulfonylureas were the only class of oral hypoglycemic agents available for NIDDM. Treatment with sulfonylureas leads to       ; effective blood glucose lowering in only 70% of patients and only 40% after 10 years of therapy. Patients that fail to respond to diet and-sulfonylureas are subsequently treated with daily insuUn iajections to gain adequate glycemic control.<br>
Although the sulfonylureas represent a major therapy for NIDDM patients, four factors hmit their overall success. First, as mentioned above, a large segment of the NIDDM population do not respond adequately to sulfonylurea therapy (i.e. primary failures) or becorhe resistant {i.e. secondary failures). This is particularly true in NIDDM patients with advanced NIDDM since these patients have severely impaired insulin secretion. Second, sulfonylurea therapy is associated with an increased risk of severe hypoglycemic episodes.. Third, chronic hyperinsuhnemia has been associated with increased cardiovascular disease although this relationship is considered controversial and unproven. Last, sulfonylureas are associated with weight gain, which leads to worsening of peripheral insulin sensitivity and thereby can accelerate the progression of the disease.<br>
Results from the U.K. Diabetes Prospective Study also showed thit patients undergoing maximal therapy of a sulfonylurea, metformin, or a combination of the two, were unable to maintain normal fasting glycemia over the six year period of the study. U.K. Prospective Diabetes Study 16. Diabetes, 44:1249-158,(1995). These results fiirther illustrate the great need for alternative therapies.<br>
 Gluconeogenesis from pyruvate and other 3-carbon precursors is a highly regulated biosynthetic pathway requiring eleven enzymes. Seven enzymes catalyze reversible reactions and are common to both gluconedgenesis and glycolysis. Four enzymes catalyze reactions unique to gluconeogenesis, namely pyruvate carboxylase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, fructose-l,6-bisphosphatase and glucose-6-phosphatase. Overall flux through the pathway is controlled by the specific activities of these enzymes, the enzymes that catalyzed the corresponding steps in the glycolytic direction,, and by substrate availability. Dietary factors (glucose, fat) and hormones (insulin, glucagon.<br><br>
WO 01/66553	PCT/USOl/07452<br>
glucocorticoids, epinephrine) coordinatively regulate enzyme activities in the gluconeogenesis and glycolysis pathways through gene expression and post-translational mechanisms.<br>
Of the four enzymes specific to gluconeogenesis, fructose-l,6-bisphosphatase (hereinafter "FBPase") is the most suitable target for a gluconeogenesis inhibitor based on efficacy and safety considerations. Studies indicate that nature uses the FBPase/PFK cycle as a major control point (metabolic switch) responsible-for determining whether metabolic flux proceeds in the direction of glycolysis or gluconeogenesis. Clans, et al., Mechanisms of Insulin Action, Belfrage, P: editor, pp.305-321, Elsevier Science 1992; Regen, et al. L Theor. BioL, 111:635-658 (1984); Pilkis, et al. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 57:755-7"83 (1988). FBPase is inhibited by fructose-2,6-bisphosphate in the cell. Fructose-2,6-bisphosphate binds to the substrate site of the enzyme. AMP binds.to an allosteric site on the enzyme:<br>
Synthetic inhibitors of FBPase have also been reported. McNiel reported that fiructose-2,6-bisphosphate analogs inhibit FBPase by binding to the substrate site.   J. Am. Chem. Soc. 106:7851-7853 (1984)-U.S. Patent No. 4,968,790 (1984). These compounds, however, were relatively weak and did not inhibit glucose production ia hepatocytes presumably due to poor cell penetration.<br>
Gruber reported that some nucleosides can lower blood glucose in the whole animal through inhibition of FBPase. These compounds exert their activity by first undergoing phosphorylation to the corresponding monophosphate., EP 0 427 799 Bl.<br>
Gruber et al. U.S. Patent No. 5,658,889 described the use of inhibitors of the AMP site,of FBPase to treat diabetes. WO 98/39344, WO 98/39343, WO 98/39342 and WO 00/14095 describe specific inhibitors of FBPase to treat diabetes.<br>

The term "prodmg" as used herein refers to any compound that when administered to a biological system generates the "drug" substance (a biologically active compound) in or-more steps involving spontaneous chemical reaction(s), inzyme catalyzed chemical reaction(s), or both. Standard prodrugs are formed using groups attached to functionality, e.g. H0-, HS-, HOOC-, R2N-, associated with the FBPase inhibitor, that cleave in vivo. Prodrugs for these groups are well known in the art and are often used to enhance oral bioavailability or other properties beneficial to the formulation, deUvery, or activity of the drug. Standard prodrugs include but are not limited to carboxylate esters where the group is alkyl, aryl, araDcyl, acyloxyalkyl, alkoxycarbonyloxyalkyl as well as esters of hydroxyl, thiol and amines where the group attached is an acyl group, an alkoxycarbonyl, aminocarbonyl, phosphate or sulfate. Standard prodrugs of phosphonic acids are also included and may be represented by R" in formula I. The groups illusfrated are exemplary,<br><br><br>

not exhaustive, and one skilled in the art could prepare other known varieties of prodrugs. Such prodrugs of the compounds of formula I fall within the scope of the present invention. Prodrugs must undergo some form of a chemical transformation to produce the compound that is biologically active, In some cases, the prodrug is biologically active usually less than the drug itself, and serves to improve efScacy or safety through improved oral bioavailability, pharmacodynamic half-life, etc.<br>
The term "prodrug ester" as employed herein refers to esters of phosphonic acids or phosphoramic acids and includes, but is not limited to, the following groups and combinations of these groups:,<br>
[1]       Acyloxyalkyl esters which are well described in the literature (Farquhar et al., J. Pharm. Sci. 72, 324-325 (1983)) and are represented by formula A<br><br>
Formula A<br>
wherein	R, R", and R" are independently H, alkyl, aryl, alkylaryl, and<br><br>
alicyclic; (see WO 90/08155; WO 90/10636). [2]       Other acyloxyalkyl esters are possible in which an alicycHc ring is formed such as shown in formula B. These esters have been shown to generate phosphorus- . containing nucleotides inside cells through a postulated sequence of reactions beginning with deesterification and followed by a series of elimination reactions {e.g. Freed et al., Biochem. Pharm. 38: 31.93-3198 (1989)).<br><br><br>
wo 01/66553	PCT/USOl/07452<br>
wherein R is -H, alkyl, aryl, alkylaryl, alkoxy, aryloxy, alkylthio, arylthio,<br>
alkylamino, arylamino, cycloalkyl, or alicyclic.	<br>
[3]      Another class of these double esters known as alkyloxycarbbnyloxyraethyl esters, as shown in formula A, where R is alkoxy, aryloxy, alkylthio, arylthio, alkylamino, and arylamino; R", andR" are independently H, alkyl, aryl, alkylaryl, and alicycUc, have been studied in the area of p-lactam-antibiotics (Tatsuo Nishimura et al. J. Antibiotics,. 1987, 40(1), 81-90; for a review see Fejxes, H., Dnigs of Today, 19S3,19, 499.). More recently Cathy, M. S., et al. (Abstract from AAPS Western Regional Meeting, April, 1997) showed that these alkyloxycarbonyloxymethyl ester prodrugs on (9-[(R)-2-phosphonomethoxy)propyi]adenine (PMPA) are bioavailable up to 30% in dogs.<br>
[4]       Aryl esters have also been used as phosphonate prodrugs {e.g. Erion, DeLambert et al., J. Med. Chem. 37: 498, 1994; Serafinowska et al., J. Med. Cbem. 38; 1372, 1995). Phenyl as well as mono and poly-substituted phenyl proesters have generated the parent phosphonic acid in studies conducted in animals and in man (Formula C). Another approach has been described where Y is a carboxylic ester ortho to the phosphate. Khamnei and Toixence, J. Med. Chem.: 39:4109-4115 (1996).<br><br><br>
Formula C<br>
wherein:	         Y is H, alkyl, aiyl, alkylaryl, alkoxy, acyloxy, halogen, amino,<br>
alkoxycarbonyl, hydroxy, cyano, and alicyclic.<br>
[5]       Benzyl esters have also been reported to generate the parent phosphonic acid. In some cases, using substituents at the para-position can accelerate the hydrolysis. Benzyl analogs with 4-acyloxy or 4-alkyloxy group [Formula D, X = H, OR or 0(CO)R or 0(CO)OR] can generate the 4-hydroxy compound more readily through the action of enzymes, e.g. oxidases, esterases, etc. Examples of this class of prodrugs are described in Mitchell et al, J, Chem. Soc. Perkm Trans. 12345 (1992); Brook, et al. WO 91/19721.<br><br>
WO 01/66553	PCT/US0iy07452<br><br>
Formula D<br>
wherein	X and Y are independently H, alkyl, aryl, alkylaiyl, alkoxy, acyloxy,<br>
hydroxy, cyano, nitro, perhaloalkyl, halo, or alkyloxycarbonyl; and R and R are independently H, alkyl, aryl, alkylaryl, halogen, and ahcyclic.<br>
[6]       Thio-containing phosphonate proesters have been described that are useful in the delivery of FBPase inhibitors to hepatocytes. These proesters contain a protected thioethyl moiety as shown in formula E. One or more of the oxygens of the phosphonate can be esterified. Since the mechanism that results in de-esterification requires the generation of a free thiolate, a variety of thiol protecting groups are possible. For example, the disulfide is.reduced by a reductase-mediated process (Puech et al., Antiviral Res., 22: 155-174 (1993)). Thioesters will also generate free thiolates after esterase-mediated hydrolysis. Benzaria, et al, J. Med. Chem., 39:4958 (1996). Cyclicanalogs are also possible and were shown to liberate phosphonate in isolated rat hepatocytes.  The cyclic disulfide shown below has not been previously described and is novel.<br><br>

incorporated from intermediate 2 is an aryl and the L fragment is -CH2KHC(O)-.<br>
Similarly, substitution of diethyl alkylaminoalkylphosphonates in this method may<br>
produce compounds with an L fragment represented by -R"C(R")N(R)C(O)-;<br>
Altematively, for example, coupling of an aryl amine preferably-with<br>
diethylphosphonoacetic acid can result in a compound of formula I whereia the ring <br>
fragment incorporated from intermediate 2 is an aryl and the L fragment is -CH2C(O)NH-.<br>
Compounds with an L fragment of-R"C(R")C(0)NR- may be prepared by extension of<br>
this method.	"	â– <br>
Known ester bond formation reactions can be used to produce compounds of   â€¢ formula I wherein L is alkylcarboxy or alkoxycarbonyl (e.g. -CH2C(O)O- or "CH20C(O)-). For example, when compound 2 fragment is a hydroxy substituted aryl (e.g. a phenol derivative) it can be acylated with diethylphosphonoacetyl chloride in the presence of a bindered amine such as triethylaroine to produce compounds wherein L is -CH2C(0)0-. Additionally, aryl-acyl halides (e.g..aryl-acyl chlorides) can be coupled to dialkyl (hydroxyalkyl)phosphonates (e.g. diethyl (hydroxy)methylphosphonate) to produce compounds wherein L is -alkoxycarbonyl- (e.g. -CH20.C(0)-).<br>
Known ether bond formation reactions can be used to produce compounds of â– formula I where L is an alkylene-0 or an alkylene-O-aUcylene group. For example^ the sodium salt of a phenol maybe alkylated with diethyl (iodomethyl)phosphonate or preferably diethylphosphonomethyl triflate to produce compounds of formula I wbere L is -alkylene-0. Likewise, aUcylation of the sodium salt of a aryhnethyl alcohol with diethyl (iodomethyl)phosphonate or preferably diethylphosphonomethyl triflate may produce compounds of formula I where L is -aUcylene-O-allcylene-. Altematively, freatment of diethyl hydroxymethylphosphonate with sodium hydride and reaction of this generated sodium salt with a haloalkylaryl compound can produce compounds of formula I where L is-alkylene-0-alkylene-.<br>
For compounds of formula I wherein L is an alkyl group, the phosphonate group can be infroduced using other common phosphonate formation methods such as Michaelis-Arbuzov reaction (Bhattacharya et al., Chem. Rev., 1981, 81: 4.15), Michaelis-Becker reaction (Blackbum et al., J. Organomet. Chem., 1988, 348: 55), and addition reactions of<br><br><br>
WO  01/66353	PCT/USOl/07452<br>
phosphorus to electrophiles (such as aldehydes, ketones, acyl halides, imines. and other carbonyl derivatives).<br>
When feasible and sometimes advantageous, compounds of formula 3 can also be<br>
prepared from an aryl componnd (2b) via the introdnction of a phosphonate moiety such as<br>
a dialcylphosphono group (e.g. a diethylphosphono group). For example, compounds of<br>
formula I wherein L is a 1,2-ethynyl can be prepared via the litktation of a terminal<br>
arylaUcyne followed by reacting the anion with a phosphorylating agent (e.g. CIPO3R2) to<br>
give an arylalkytiylphosphonate. The required arylalkynes are readily made using<br>
conventional chemistry. For example, arylalkynes can be derived from reactions of aryl<br>
halides (e.g. iodides, bromides) or triflates and trimethylsilylacetylene using Sonogashira<br>
reactions (Sonogashira in"Comprehensive Organic Synthesis, Pergamon Press: New York,<br>
1991, vol. 3, pp 521-549) followed by deprotection of the triinethylsilyl group to give "<br>
terminal arylalkynes.	<br>
fb)       Modification of the coupled molecule.<br>
The coupled, molecule 3" can be modified in a variety of ways. Aryl halides (J2 -J6 each optionally e.g. Br, I or 0-triflate) are useful intermediates and .are often readily converted to other substituents such as aryls, olefins, alkyls, alkynyls, arylamines and aryloxy groups via transition metal assisted coupling reactions such as Stille, Suzuki, Heck, Sonogashira andi otherreactions (Farina, et al, Organic Reactions, Vol. 50; Wiley, New York, 1997; Mitchell,.Synthesis, 1992, 808; Suzuki in. Metal Catalyzed Cross-Coupling Reactions; Wiley VCH, 1998, pp 49-97; Heck Palladium Reagents in Organic Synthesis; Academic Press: San Diego, 1985; Sonogashira in Comprehensive Organic Synthesis, Pergamon Press: New York, 1991, vol. 3, pp 521-549, Buchwald J. Am. Chem. Sac. 1999,121, 4369-4378; Hartwig, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999,121, 3224-3225; Buchwald^cc. Chem.-Res. 1998,31, 805).<br>
Compounds of formula I wherein J -J   are each optionally is a carboxamido group can be made from then corresponding alkyl carboxylate esters via aminolysis using various amines, or by reaction of carboxylic acids with amines under standard amide bond formation reaction conditions (e.g.: DIC/HOBt mediated amide bond formation).<br><br>
WO  01/66553	PCT/USOl/07452.<br>
Compounds of fpnnula I wherein J2 -J6 are each optionally a carboxylate ester group can be made from the corresponding carboxylic acids by standard esterification reactions (.e.g. DIEA/DMF/alkyl iodide or EDCI, DMAP and an alcohol), or from the corresponding aiyl hahdes/trifl"ates via transition metal-catalyzed carbonylation reactions.<br>
Compounds of formula I wherein J2-J6 are each optionally is an alkylaminoalkyi or arylainiaoalkyl group can be prepared from their corresponding aldehydes by standard reductive amination reactions (e.g. aryl or alkyl amine, TMOF, AcOH, DMSO, NaBH4).<br>
(c)       Deprotection of a phosphonate or phosphoramidate ester<br>
.   Compounds of formula 4 may be prepared from phosphonate esters using known phosphate and phosphonate ester cleavage conditions. Silyl hahdes are generally used to cleave various phosphonate esters. When required, acid scavengers (e.g. 1,1,1,3,3,3-   . hexamethyldisilazane, 2,6-lutidine etc.) can be used for the synthesis of acid labile compounds. Such silyl hahdes include preferably bromotrimethylsilaue (McKenna, et al, -Tetrahedron Lett., 1977,155), chlorotrimethylsilane (Rabinowitz, J. Org. Chem., 1963, 28: 2975) and iodotrimethylsilane (Blackburn, .efal, /. Chem. Soc, Chem. Commun., . 1978, 870). Alternately, phosphonate esters can be cleaved under strong acidic conditions (e.g. HBr, HCl: Moffatt, et al, U.S. Patent 3,524.846,1970). Aryl and benzyl phosphonate esters can be cleaved under hydrogenolysis conditions (Lejczak, et si, Synthesis, 1982, 412; Elliott, et al, J. Med. Chem., 1985,28:1208; Baddiley, et al. Nature, 1953, 777, 76).<br>
fd)       Preparation of a phosphonate orphosphoramidate prodrug<br>
The prodrug substitution can be introduced at different stages of the synthesis. Most often the prodrug is made from the phosphonio acid of fonnula.4 because of the instability of some of the. prodrugs. Advantageously, the prodmg can be introduced at an earlier stage, provided that it can withstand the reaction conditions of the subsequent steps. Bis-phosphoramidates, compounds of formula I wherein both Y"s are nitrogen.and R1 "s are identical groups derived from amino acids, can be prepared from compounds of formula 4 via the coupling of a suitably activated phosphonate (e.g. dichlorophosphonate) with an amino acid ester (e.g. alanine ethyl ester) with or without the presence of abase<br><br><br><br><br><br>
wo 01/66553	PCT/USOl/07452<br>
(e.g. N-methyltmidazole, 4-N,N-dimethylarniaopyridine). Alternatively, bis-phosphoramidates can be prepared-through reactions between compounds of formula 4<br>
â€¢   with an amino acid ester (e.g. glycine ethyl ester) in the presence of triphenylphosphine and 2,2"-dipyridyl disulfide in pyridine as described in WO 95/07920 orMukaiyama, T. et al, J Am. Chem. Soc, 1972, 94, 8528.  "<br>
Mixed bis-phosphorairddates, compounds of formula I wherein both-Y"s are nitrogen and R^"s are different groups with one R" being derived from amino acids and the other R^ being either derived from amino acids or other groups (e.g. alkyl, aryl, arylaUcyl amines), can be prepared by the methods described above but with sequential addition of the different" amines (e.g. a glycine ethyl ester and an alanine ethyl ester) to a suitably activated phosphonates (e.g. dichlorophosphonate). It is anticipated that the mixed bis-   â–  phosphoramidates may have to be"separated from other products (e.g. compounds of formula I wherein both Y"s are nifrogen and R^ "s are identical groups) using suitable purification techniques such as column chromatography, MPLC or cfystalUzation methods. Alternatively, mixed bis-phosphoramidates can be prepared in the following manner: coupling of an appropriate phosphonate monoester (e.g. phenyl esters or benzyl esters) with an amine (e.g. alanine ethyl ester or morpholine) via the chloridate method described<br>
,   above, followed by removal of the phosphonate ester (e.g. phenyl esters or benzyl esters) under conditions that the phosphoramidate bond is stable (e.g. suitable hydrogenation conditions), and the resulting mono-phosphoramidate can be coupled with a second amine (e.g. glycine ethyl ester) to give a mixed bis-phosphoramidate via the chloridate method described above. Mono esters of a phosphonic acid can be prepared using conventional methods (e.g.. hydrolysis of phosphonate diesters or procedures described in EP 481 214). Mono phosphoramidate mono esters, compounds of formula I wherein one Y is 0 and the other Y is N, can also be prepared using the sequential addition methods described above. For example, a dichloridate generated from compounds of formula 4 can be treated with 0.7 to 1 equivalent of an alcohol (e.g! phenol, benzyl alcohol, 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol) preferably in the presence of a suitable base (e.g. Hunig"s base, triethylamine). After the above reaction is completed, 2 to 10 equivalents of an amine (e.g. alanine ethyl ester) is added to the reaction to give compounds of formula I wherein one Y is O and the other Y<br><br>

is N. Alternatively, selective hydrolysis (e.g. using lithium hydroxide) of a phosphonate diester (e.g. a diphenyl phosphonate) can also lead to a phosphonate mono ester (e.g. a phosphonate mono phenyl ester), and the phosphonate mono ester can be coupled with an amine (e.g. alanine ethyl ester) via the chloridate method described above for the preparation of mixed bis-phosphoramidates.<br>
Compounds of formula 4, can be alkylated with electropbiles (such as alkyl halides, alkyl sulfonates, etc.) uiidernucleophilic substitution reaction conditions to give phosphonate esters. For example compounds of formula I, wherein R" are aeyloxyalkyl groups can be synthesized through direct alkylation of compounds of foimula 4 with an appropriate acyloxyalkyl halide (e.g. Cl, Br, I; Elhaddadi, et al Phosphorus Sulfur, 1990, 54(1-4): 143; Hoffinann, Synthesis, 1988, 62) in presence of a suitable base (e.g. N, N"-dicyclohexyl-4-morpholinecarboxamiduie, Hunig"s base etc.) (Starrett, et al, J. Med. Chem., 1994, 1857). The carboxylate component of these acyloxyalkyl halides can be, but is not limited to, acetate, propionate, 2-methylpropionate, pivalate, benzoate, and other carboxylates. When appropriate, further modifications are envisioned after the formation of acyloxyaUcyl phosphonate esters such as reduction of a nitro group. For example, compounds of formula 5 wherein J2 to J6 are each optionally a nitro group can be  converted to compounds of formula 5 wherein J2 to J6 are each optionally an amino group under suitable reduction conditions (Dickson, et al, J. Med. Chem., 1996, 39: 661; Iyer, et al, Tetrahedron Lett., 1989, 30:7141; Srivastva, et al, Bioorg. Chem., 1984,12: 118). Compounds of formula I wherein R1 is a cyclic carbonate, a lactone or a phthalidyl group can also be synthesized via direct alkylation of compounds of formula 4 with appropriate electrophiles (e.g. halides) in the presence of a suitable base (e.g. NaH or diisopropylethylamine, Biller et al., US 5,157,027; Serafinowska et al, J. Med. Chem. 1995, 38: 1372; Staixett et al., J. Med. Chem. 1994, 37: 1857; Martin et al., J. Pharm. Set 1987, 76: 180; Alexander et al., Collect. Czech. Chem. Commun, 1994, 59: 1853; EPO 0632048A1). Other methods can also be used to alkylate compounds of formula 4 (e.g. using iV,iV-Dimethylformamide dialkyl acetals as alkylating reagents: Alexander, P., et al Collect. Czech. Chem. Commun., 1994, 59, 1853).<br><br><br>
WO  01/66553	PCT/USOl/07452<br>
Alternatively, these phosphonate prodrugs can-also be synthesized by reactions of the corresponding dichlorophosphonates with an alcohol (Alexander et al. Collect. Czech. Chein. Commun., 1994, 59: 1853). For example, reactions of a"dichlorophosphonate with substituted phen.ols,afylalkyl alcohols IB the presence of a suitable base (e.g. pyridine, triethylamine, etc) yield compounds"of formula I where R" is an aryl group (Khamnei et al, J. Med. Chem., 1996, 39: 4109; Serafinowska et al., J. Med.Chem., 1995, 38: 1372; â– . De Lombaert et al, J. Med. Chem., 1994,"37: 498) or an arylalkyl group (Mitchell et al., J.<br>
  Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1,1992, 38: 2345) and Y is oxygen. The disulfide-containing prodrugs (Puech et al,. Antiviral Res., 1993, 22: 155) can also be prepared from a dichlorophosphonate and 2-hydroxyethyl disulfide under standard conditions. When applicable, these methods can be extended to the synthesis of other types of prodrugs, such as compounds of formula I wherein R1 is a 3-phthalidyl, a 2-oxo-4,5-didehydro-l,3-dioxolanemethyl, or a 2-oxotetrahydrofuran-5-yl group.<br>
A dichlorophosphonate or a monochlorophosphonate derivative of compounds of â–  formula 4 can be generated from the corresponding phosphonic acids using a chlorinating agent (e.g. thionyl chloride: Starrett et al., J. Med. Chem., 1994, 1857, oxalyl chloride:    â€¢ Stowell et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1990, 31: 3261, and phosphorus pentachloride: Quast et al. Synthesis, 1974, 490). Alternatively, a dichlorophosphonate can also be generated from<br>
.its corresponding disilyl phosphonate esters (Bhongle et al., Synth. Commun., 1987,17: 1071) or dialkyl phosphonate esters (Still et al.. Tetrahedron Lett, 1983, 24: 4405; Patois. et al. Bull Soc. Chim. Fr.,-1993,130: 485).<br>
â€¢Furthermore, when feasible some of these prodrugs can be prepared using<br>
Mitsunobu reactions(Mitsunobu , Synthesis, 1981, 1; Campbell, J. Org. Chem., 1992, 52:<br>
1<br>
6331), and other coupKng reactions (e.g. using carbodiimides: Alexander et al.. Collect. . Czech. Chem. Commun., 1994, 59: 1853; Casara et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 1992, 2: 145; Ohashi et al.. Tetrahedron Lett.. 1988, 29: 1189, and benzotriazolyloxytris-(dimethylamino)phosphonium salts: Campagne et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1993, 34: 61 A3). In some cases R1" can also be introduced advantageously at an early stage of the synthesis provided that it is compatible with the subsequent reaction steps. For example, compounds of formula I where R" is an aryl group can be prepared by metalation of a 2-fiiranyl<br><br>
WO 01/66553	PCT/USOl/07452<br>
substituted heterocycle (e.g. using LDA) followed by trapping the anion with a diaryl chlorophosphate.<br>
It is envisioned that compounds of formula I can be-mixed phosphonate esters (e.g. phenyl and benzyl esters, or phenyl and acyloxyalkyl esters) including the chemically combined mixed esters such as the phenyl and benzyl combined prodrugs reported by Meier, et al. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett, 1997, 7: 99.<br>
The substituted cyclic propyl phosphonate or phosphoramidate esters can be synthesized by reactions of the corresponding dichlordphosphonate with a substituted 1,3-propanediol, 1,3-hydroxypropylamine, or 1,3-propanediamine. Some of the methods useful for preparations of a substituted 1,3-propanediol, for example, are discussed below.<br>
Synthesis of a l,3-T3ropanedioh 1,3-hYdroxypropylamine and 1,3-propanediamine Various synthetic methods can be used to prepare numerous types of 1,3-propanediols: (i) 1-substituted, (ii) 2-substituted, (iii) 1,2- or 1,3-annulated 1,3-propanediols, (iv) 1,3-hydroxypropylaniine and 1,3-propanediamine. Substituents on the prodrug moiety of compounds of formula I (e.g. substituents on the 1,3-propanediol moiety) can be introduced or modified either during the synthesis of these diols,hydroxyamines, and diamines, or after the coupling of these compounds to the compounds of formula 4.<br>
fi)        1-Substituted 1,3-propanediols.	       .<br>
. 1,3-Propanediols useful for the synthesis of compounds in the present invention can be prepared using various synthetic methods. For example, additions of an aryl Grignard to a l-hydroxy-propan-3-al give 1-aryl substituted 1,3-propauediols (path a). This method is suitable for the conversion of various aryl hahdes to l-aryl substituted-1,3-propanediols (Coppi et. al, J. Org. Chem., 1988, 53, 911). Conversions of aiyl halides to 1-substituted 1,3-propanediols can also be achieved using Heck reactions (e.g. couplings with a l,3-diox-4-ene) followed by reductions and subsequent hydrolysis reactions (Sakamoto et. al.. Tetrahedron Lett., 1992, 33, 6845).. Various aromatic aldehydes can also be converted to l-substituted-l,3-propanediols using alkenyl Grignard addition reactions<br><br><br>
WO  01/66553		PCT/USOl/07452<br><br><br>
followed by hydroboration reactions (path b). Additions of a t-butyl acetate metal enolate to aromatic aldehydes followed by reduction of the ester (path e) are also useful for the synthesis of 1,3-propanediols (Turner., J. Org. Chem., 1990, 55 4744). in another method, epoxidations of cinnamyl alcohol derivatives using known methods (e.g. Sharpless epoxidations and other asymmetric epoxidation reactions) followed by a reduction reaction (e.g. using Red-Al) give various l,3-propan6diols (path c).: Alternatively, enautiomerically pure 1,3-propanediols can be obtained using chiral borane reduction reactions of hydroxyethyl aryl ketone derivatives (Ramachandran et. al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1997, 38 761). Propan-3-ols with a 1-heteroaryl substituent (e.g. apyridyl, a quinohnyl or an isoquinolinyl) can be oxygenated to give 1-substituted 1,3-propanediols using N-oxide formation reactions followed by a rearrangement reaction in acetic anhydride conditions (path d) (Yamamoto et. al., Tetrahedron , 1981, 37,1871). O-<br><br><br><br><br>

fiii)     Annulated 1,3-propane diols:<br>
Compounds of formula I wherein V and Z or V and W are connected by four   carbons to form a ring can be prepared from a 1,3-cyclohexanediol. For example, cis, cis-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol can be modified as described for 2-substituted 1,3-propanediols. It is envisioned that these modifications can be performed either before or after formation of a cychcphosphonate 1,3-propanediol ester. Various 1,3-cyclohexanediols caii also be prepared using Diels-Alder reactions (e.g. using a pyrone as the diene: Posner et. al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1991, 32, 5295). 1,3-Cyclohexanediol derivatives are also prepared via other cycloaddition reaction methodologies. For .example, cycloadditon of a nitrile oxide to an olefin followed by conversion of the resulting cycloadduct to a 2-ketoethanol derivative which can be converted to a 1,3-cylohexanediol using know chemistry (Curran, et. al., J. Am. Chem. Soc, 1985, J 07, 6023). Alternatively, precursors to r,3-cyclohexanediol can be made firom quinic acid (Rao, et. al., Tetrahedron Leff., 1991, 52, 547.)<br>
(vi)         Synthesis of chiral substituted 1,3-hydroxvamines and 1,3-diamuies:-<br>
Enantiomerically pure 3-aryl-3-hydroxypropan-1 -amines are synthesized by CBS enantioselective catalytic reaction of 3-chloropropiophenone!followed by displacement of halo group to make secondary or primary amines as required:(Corey, et al. Tetrahedron Lett., 1989, 30, 5207). Chiral 3-aryl-3-amino propan-1-ol type of prodrug moiety maybe obtained by 1,3-dipolar addition of chirally pure olefin and substituted nitrone of arylaldehyde followed by redixction of resulting isoxazolidine (Koizumi, et al., /. Org.   . Chem., 1982, 47,4005). Chiral induction in 1,3-polar additions to form substituted isoxazolidines is also attained by chiral phosphine palladium complexes resulting in enantioselective formation of S-amino alcohol (Hon, et al., /. Org. Chem., 1999, 64, 5017). Alternatively, optically pure l-aiyl substituted amino alcohols are obtained by selective ring opening of corresponding chiral epoxy alcohols with desired amines (Canas et al. Tetrahedron Lett., 1991, 32, 6931).<br>
Several methods are known for diastereoselective synthesis of 1,3-disubstituted aminoalcohols. For example, treatment of (E)-N-cnmamyltrichloroacetaraide with hypochlorus acid results in trans-dihydrooxazine which is readily hydrolysed to erythroÎ²<br><br>
WO  01/66553		PCT/USOl/07452-<br>
chloro-a-hydroxy-5-phenylpropanamiae in high diastereoselectivity (Commercon et at, Tetrahedron Lett., 1990, 31, 3871). Diastereoselective foimation of 1,3-aminoalcohols is also achieved by reductive amination of optically pure 3-hydroxy ketones (Haddad et al.. Tetrahedron Lett., 1997, 38, 5981). In an alternate approach, 3-aminoketones are transformed to 1,3-disubstituted aminoalcohols in high stereoselectivity by a selective hydride reduction (Barluenga et al, J. Org. Chem., 1992, 57," 1219).<br>
All the above mentioned methods can also be applied to prepare corresponding V-Z, V-W, or V -Z annulated chiral aminoalcohols. Furthermore, such optically pure amino alcohols are also a source to obtain optically pure diamines by the procedures described earlier in the section.<br>

parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, such as a solution in 1,3-butane-diol or prepared<br>
as a lyophilized powder. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be<br>
employed are water. Ringer"s solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution, hi addition,<br>
sterile fixed oils may conventionally TDC employed as a solvent or suspending medium. Por<br>
this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or<br>
.diglycerides.. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid may likewise be used in the<br>
preparation of injectables.	.<br>
The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier material to produce a single dosage form will vary"depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. For example, a time-release formulation intended for oral-administration to hrnnans may contain approximately 1 to 1000 mg of active material compounded with an appropriate and convenient amount of carrier material which may . vary from about 5 to about 95% of the total compositions. The pharmaceutical composition can be prepared to provide easily measurable amounts-for administration. For example, an aqueous solution intended for intravenous infusion should contain from about 3 to 330 |j,g of the active ingredient per milliliter of solution in order that infusion of a suitable volume at a rate of about 30 mL/hr can occur.        .    ,<br>
As noted above, formulations of the present invention suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient; as a powder or granules; as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aq-ueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. The active ingredient may also be administered as a bolus, electuarpripaste.<br>
A tablet may be made by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free flowing form such as a powder or, granules, optionally mixed with a binder (e.g., povidone, gelatin, hydroxypropyhnethyl cellulose), lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, disintegrant (e;g-., sodium starch glycolate, cross-linked povidone, eross-linked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose) surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture<br><br>

It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend on a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the"individual being treated; the time and route of administration; the rate of excretion; other drugs which have previously been administered; and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy, as is well understood by those skilled in the art.<br>
Utility<br>
FBPase inhibitors may be used to treat diabetes melhtus, lower blood glucose levels, and inhibit gluconeogenesis.<br>
FBPase inhibitors may also be used to treat excess glycogen storage diseases. Excessive hepatic glycogen stores are found in patients with some glycogen storage diseases. Since the indirect pathway contributes significantly to glycogen synthesis Shulman, G.I. Phys. Rev. 72:1019-1035 (1992)) inhibition of the indirect pathway (gluconeogenesis flux) decreases glycogen overproduction.<br>
FBPase inhibitors may also be used to treat or prevent diseases, associated with -increased insulin levels. Increased insulin levels are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular complications and atherosclerosis (Folsom, et al.. Stroke, 25:66-73 (1994); Howard, G. et al.. Circulation 93:1809-1817 (1996)). FBPase inhibitors are expected to decrease postprandial glucose levels by.enhancing hepatic glucose uptake. This effect is postulated to occur in individuals that are non-diabetic (or pre-diabetic, z. e. without elevated hepatic glucose output "hereinafter HGO" or fasting blood glucose levels). Increased hepatic glucose uptake will decrease insulin secretion and"thereby decrease the risk of diseases or complications"that arise from elevated insulin levels.<br>
One aspect of the invention is directed to the use of prodrugs of the novel aryl phosphonates or phosphoramidates which results in efficient conversion of the cyclic phosphonate or phosphoramidate. The cyclic 1,3-propanyl ester containing compounds are oxidized by p450 enzymes foimd in large amounts in the liver and other tissues containing these specific enzymes.-<br><br><br>
WO  01/66553	PCT/USOl/07452,<br>
In another aspect of the invention, these prodrugs can also be used to prolong-the â€¢ phannacodynamic half-life because the cyclic phosphonates or phosphoramidatess of the invention can prevent the action of enzymes which degrade the parent drug.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, these prodrugs can be used to achieve sustained<br>
delivery of the parent drug because various novel prodrugs are slowly oxidized in the liver<br>
at different rates.	<br>
The novel cyclic 1,3-piopanyl esters of the present invention may also be used to increase the distribution of a particular drug to the liver which contains abundant amoimts of the p450 isozymes responsible for oxidizing the cyclic 1,3-propanyl ester of the present invention so that the free phosphonate or phosphoramidate is produced.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, the cyclic phosphonate or phosphoramidate pro&amp;ugs can increase the oral bioavailability of the drugs.<br>
Theses aspects are described in greater detail below.<br>
Evidence of the liver specifi.city can also be shown in vivo after both oral and I-.V. administration of the prodmgs as described in Examples G and H.<br>
Prodrug Cleavage Mechanism of Cyclic l,3-propahyl esters	.<br>
The cyclic 1,3-propanyl ester prodrugs are rapidly cleaved in the presence of liver microsomes from rates and humans, by freshly isolated rat hepatocyles, and by cytochrome P450 inhibitors. It is beKeved that the isoenzyme cytochrome CYP3A4 is responsible for the "oxidation based on ketoconozole inhibition of drug formation. Inhibitors of c3d:ochroihe P450 family 1 and/or family 2 do not appear to inhibit prodrug cleavage. Furthermore, although these specific prodrugs appear to be cleaved by CYP3A4, other prodrugs in the class, may be substrates.for other P450s.<br><br><br><br>

BIOLOGICAL EXAMPLES<br>
Example A: Inhibition of Human Liver FBPase<br>
E. coli strain BL21 transformed with a human liver FBPase-encoding plasraid was obtained from Dr. M.R. El-Magtirabi at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. The enzyme was typically purified from 10 liters of recombinant E. coli culture as described (M. Gidh-Jain et al., 1994, The Journal of Biological Chemistry 269,-p-p 27732- " 27738). Enzymatic activity was measured spectrophotometrically in reactions that coupled the formation of product (fructose-6-phosphate) to the reduction of dimethylthiazoldiphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) via NADP  and phenazine methosulfate (PMS), using phosphoglucose isomerase and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase as the couphng enzymes. Reaction mixtures (200 p.!) were made up in 96-well niicrotibre plates, and consisted of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4,100 mM KCl, 5 mM EGTA, 2 mM MgClz, 0.2 mM NADP, 1 mg/ml BSA, 1 ,mM MTT, 0.6,mM PMS, 1 unit/rQl phosphoglucose isomerase, 2 units/ml glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and 0.150 mM substrate (fructose~l,6-bisphosphate). Inhibitor concentrations were varied from 0.01 ÂµM to 10 p.M. Reactions were started by the addition of 0.002 units of pure hlFBPase, and were monitored for 7 minutes at 590 run in a Molecular Devices Plate Reader (37 Â°C).<br>

Example B: AMP Site Binding<br>
To assess whether compounds bind to the allosteric AMP binding site of hlFBPase, the enzyme is incubated with radio-labeled AMP in the presence of a range of test compound concentrations.   The reaction mixtures consist of 25 mM ^H-AMP (54 mCi/mmole) and 0 -1000 mM test compound.in 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH .7.4, 100 mM   â–  KCl and 1 mM MgCl2- 1.45 mg of homogeneous FBPase "(=l nmole) is added last. After a 1 minute incubation, AMP bound to FBPase is separated from unboimd AMP by means of a centrifugal rdtrafiltration unit ("Ultrafi-ee-MC", Millipore) used according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The radioactivity in aliquots (100 Âµl) of the upper compartment of the unit (the retentate, which contains enzyme and label) and the lower compartment (the filtrate, which contains unbound label) is quantified using a Beckman liquid scintillation counter. The amount of AMP bound to the enzyme is estimated by comparing the counts in the filtrate (the unbound label) to the total counts in the retentate.<br>
Example C: AMP Site/Enzyme Selectivitv<br>

Example E:    Glucose Production Inhibition and Fructose-l,6-bisphosphate Accumulation in Rat Hepatocytes<br>
Isolated rat hepatocytes are prepared as described in Example D and incubated under the identical conditions described. Reactions are terminated by removing an aliquot (250 Âµl) of cell suspension and spinning it through a layer of oil (0.8 ml siHcone/mineral oil, 4/1) mto a 10% perchloric acid layer (100 Âµl). After removal of the oil layer, the" acidic cell extract layer is neutralized by addition of l/3rd volume of 3 M KOH/3 M KHCO3. After thorough mixing and centrifagation, the supernatant is analyzed for glucose content as described in Example D, and also for fructose-l,6-bisphosphate. Fructose-l,6-bisphosphate is assayed spectrophotometrically by coupling its enzymatic conversion to glycerol 3-phosphate to the oxidation of NADH, which is monitored at 340-nm. Reaction mixtures (1 ml) consist of 200 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.3 mM NADH, 2 units/ml glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 2 units/ml triosephosphate isomerase, and 50-100 yd cell extract. After a 30 minute preincubation at 37 Â°C,.l unit/ml of aldolase is: added and the change in absorbance measured imtil a stable value is obtained. 2 moles of NADH are oxidized in this reaction per mole of frutose-l,6-bisphosphate present in the cell extract.<br>

In a separate study, urinary recovery is determined following intravenous (tail vein) adrninistration of compound (in the case of the prodrugs, the appropriate parent phosphonic acid is administered LV.). The percentage oral bioavailability is estimated by comparison of the recovery of compound in urine 24 hours following oral administration, to that recovered in urine 24 hours after intravenous administration.<br>
Example J: Blood Glucose Lowering in Zucker Diabetic Fatty Rats, Oral<br>
Zucker Diabetic Fatty rats are purchased from Genetics Models Inc. (Indianapohs, Indiana) at 8 weeks of age and fed"therecommended Purina 5008 diet. At the age of 12 weeks, 16 animals with fed blood glucose levels between 500 and 700 mg/dl are selected and divided into two groups (n=8) with statistically equivalent average blood  glucose levels. A compound of the invention is administered at a dose of up to about   300 mg/kg by oral gavage to one group of animals at 1 p.m. The drug solution for this treatment is prepared in deionized water and adjusted to neutrality by. dropwise addition of 5 N NaOH. A second group of rats (n=8) is dosed orally with saline, iu-.parallel. Blood glucose is measured in each rat just prior to drug or saline adibinistration and 6 hours post administration. A HemoGue blood glucose analyzer (HemoGue Inc;, Mission Viejo, GA) is used for these measurements according to the manufachirer"s instructions.<br>
Example K: Blood Glucose Lowering in Zucker Diabetic Fatty Rats, Intravenous<br>
12-week old Zucker Diabetic Fatty rats (Genetics Models Inc., Indianapolis, Indiana) maintained on Puiina 5008 diet are instrumented with tail artery and tail vein catheters at 8 am on the day of the study. Food is removed for the remainder of the day.. Starting at 12 p.m., animals are infused for 6 hours via the tail vein catheter either with saline or compound of the invention at up to about 60 mg/kg/h. Blood samples are obtained from the tail artery catheter at the start of the infusions, and at hourly intervals thereafter. Glucose is measured in the samples by means of a HemoCue analyzer (HemoCue Inc., Mission Viejo, GA) according to the manufacturer"s instructions.<br><br><br>

ExampleL:   Inhibition of Gluconeogenesis by FBPase Inhibitor in Zucker Diabetic Fatty Rats<br>
Following a 6-hour infusion of a compound of the invention at up to about 60 mg/kg/h or saline to Zucker Diabetic Fatty rats (n=3/group) as described in Example K; a bolus of14C-bicarboriate (40 ÂµCi/1 OOg body weight) is administered via the tail vein catheter. 20 minutes later, a blood sample (0.6 mL) is taken via the tail artery. Blood   â€¢ (0.5 ml) is diluted into 6 mL deionized water and protein precipitated.by addition of 1 mL zinc sulfate (0,"3 N) and 1 mL barium hydroxide (0.3 N). The mixture is centrifuged (20 minutes, 1000 X g) and 5 mL of the resulting supernatant is then combined with 1 g of a mixed bed ion exchange resin (1 part AG 50W-X8,100--200 mesh, hydrogen form, and 2 parts AG 1-X8, 100-200 mesh, acetate form) to separate 14-C-bicabonate Irom 14C-glucose. The slurry is shaken at room temperature for four hours and then allowed to settle. An ahquot of the supernatant (0.5 mL) is.then counted in 5 mL scintillation cocktail. The percentage inhibition of gluconeogenesis in drug-treated rats is calculated by dividing the average cpm" of 14C-glucose in samples from drug-treated animals by those from saline-injected animals.<br>
Inhibition 14C-Glucose production provides evidence that the glucose lowering activity in the Zucker Diabetic Fatty rat (Example K) is due to the inhibition of gluconeogenesis.<br>
Example M: BIood Glucose Lowering in the Streptozotocin-Treated Rat<br>
Diabetes is induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300 g) by intraperitoneal injection of 55 mg/kg streptozotocin (Sigma Chemical Co.). Six days later, blood glucose is measured as described in Example F. Animals are selected with fed blood glucose values (8 am) between 350 and 600 mg/dl, and divided into two groups. One group is dosed orally with compound (up to about 300 mg/kg) and the second with an equivalent volume of saline; Food is removed from the animals. Blood glucose is measured again after 2 and 4 hours of drug/saline administration.<br>

WO 01/66553	PCT/USOl/07452<br>
Prodrugs of the iiivention are administered to normal, fed rats at 3 0 mg/kg both by intraperitoneal injection"and by oral gavage (n=3 rats/ compound/route of administration). Rats are subsequently placed in metabolic cages and urine collected for 24 hours. Parent compound, is quantitated in urine by reverse phase HPLC as described in Example G. By comparison of the amount of pareni; compormd excreted in urine following oral administration to that following intraperitoneal administration, the % oral absorption is calculated for each prodrug.<br>
 Example O: Chronic Oral Efficacy in the ZDF Rat<br>
To determine the chronic glucose lowering effects of aprodrug of the-invention, ZDF are administered the drug orally for 3 weeks.<br>
Methods: ZDF rats (10 weeks of age) are maintained either on powdered Purina   . 5008 rat chow (n=10) or the same powdered chow supplemented with 1% of the drug (n=8). Blood glucose measurements are made as described in Example F at baseliQe;and-at weekly intervals thereafter for a total of 3 weeks. Statistical analysis is performed using the Studenf s t test.<br>
Example P: Identification of  the P450 Isozyme Involved in the Activation<br>
Prodrugs are evaluated for human microsome-cafalyzed conversion to parent compound in the absence and presence of specific inhibitors of three major P450 isozymes: ketoconazole (CYP3A4), furafylline (CYP1A2), and sulfaphenazole (CYP2C9).<br>
Methods: Reaction (0.5 ml @ 37Â°C) consist of 0.2 M KH2PO4, 13 mM glucose-6-phosphate, 2.2 mMNADP"^, 1 unit of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 0-2.5 mg/ml human microsomal protein (En Vitro Technologies, In.), 250Âµ prodrug, and 0-100 ÂµM; P450 isozyme inhibitor; Reactions are stopped by addition of methanol to a concentration of 60%, filtered (0.2 ÂµM filter), and lyophilized. Samples are resuspended in HPLC buffer (10 mM phosphate pH 5.5, 2.5 mM octyl-triethylammonium), loaded onto a YMC C8 HPLC column (250 x 4.6 mm), and eluted with a methanol gradient to 80%. Foimuation of parent drug is confinned by co-elution with an authentic parent drug standard.<br><br>
WO 01/66553	PC.T/USOl/07452,<br>
Results: Prodrug is converted readily to parent drug in human liver microsomes.<br>
Ketoconazole will inhibit the formation of parent drugs in. a dose-dependent fashion. The<br>
other inhibitor, fusafylline and sulfaphenazole, will show no significant inhibition. The<br>
results indicate that CYP3A4 is the primary P450 isoform responsible for activation of<br>
prodrugs in human liver.	"	"	.<br>
