				<td>The present invention relates to a substituted quinazoline compound<br>
The present invention relates to quinazoline derivatives, processes for their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing them as active ingredient, methods for the treatment of disease states associated with angiogenesis and/or increased vascular permeability, to their use as medicaments and to their use in the manufacture of medicaments for use in the production of antiangiogenie and/or vascular permeability reducing effects in warm-blooded animals such as humans.<br>
Normal angiogenesis plays an important role in a variety of processes including embryonic development, wound healing and several components of female reproductive function. Undesirable or pathological angiogenesis has been associated with disease states including diabetic retinopathy, psoriasis, cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, atheroma, Kaposi's sarcoma and haemangioma (Fan et a], 1995, Treads PharmacoL Sci. 16: 57-66; Folkman, 1995, Nature Medicine 1: 27-31). Alteration of vascular permeability is thought to play a role in both normal and pathological physiological processes (Cullinan-Bove et al, 1993, Endocrinology 133: 829-837; Senger et al, 1993, Cancer and Metastasis Reviews, 12: 303-324).  Several polypeptides with in vitro endothelial cell growth promoting activity have been identified including, acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors (aFGF &amp; bFGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).  By virtue of the restricted expression of its receptors, the growth factor activity of VEGF, in contrast to that of the FGFs, is relatively specific towards endothelial cells. Recent evidence indicates that VEGF is an important stimulator of both normal and pathological angiogenesis (Jakeman et al, 1993, Endocrinology, 133: 848-859; Kolch et al, 1995, Breast Cancer Research and Treatment, 36:139-155) and vascular permeability (Connolly et al, 1989, J. Biol. Chem. 264: 20017-20024).  Antagonism of VEGF<br>
action by sequestration of VEGF with antibody can result in inhibition of tumour growth (Kim efal, 1993, Nature 362: 841-844). -Basic FGF (bFGF) is a potent stimulator of augiogenesis (e.g. Hayek et al, 1987, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 147: 876-880) and raised levels of FGFs have been found in the serum (Fujimoto et al, 1991, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 180: 386-392) and urine (Nguyen et al, 1993, J. Natl. Cancer. lost. 85: 241-242) of patients with cancer.<br>
Receptor tyrosiue kinases (RTKs) are important in the transmission of biochemical signals across the plasma membrane of cells. These transmembrane molecules<br><br>
characteristically consist of an extracellular ligand-binding domain connected through a<br>
segment in the plasma membrane to an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. Binding of ligand<br>
to the receptor results in stimulation of the receptor-associated tyrosine kinase activity which<br>
leads to phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on both the receptor and other intracellular<br>
molecules. These changes in tyrosiue phosphorylation initiate a signalling cascade leading to a<br>
variety of cellular responses. To date, at least nineteen distinct RTK subfamilies, defined by<br>
amino acid sequence homo logy, have been identified. One of these subfamilies is presently<br>
comprised by the fins-like tyrosine kinase receptor, Flt-1, the kinase insert domain-containing<br>
receptor, KDR (also referred to as FTk-1), and another fins-like tyrosine kinase receptor, Flt-4.<br>
Two of these related RTKs, Flt-1 and KDR, have been shown to bind VEGF with high affinity<br>
(De Vries et al, 1992, Science 255: 989-991; Terman et al, 1992, Biochem. Biophys. Res.<br>
Comra 1992, 187: 1579-1586). Binding of VEGF to these receptors expressed in<br>
heterologous cells has been associated with changes in the tyrosine phosphorylation status of<br>
cellular proteins and calcium fluxes.<br>
The present invention is based on the discovery of compounds that surprisingly inhibit<br>
the effects of VEGF, a property of value in the treatment of disease states associated with<br>
angiogeiiesis and/or increased vascular permeability such as cancer, diabetes, psoriasis,<br>
rheumatoid arthritis, Kaposi's sarcoma, haemangioma, lymphoedema, acute and chronic<br>
nephropathies, atheroma, arterial restenosis, autoimmune diseases, acute inflammation,<br>
excessive scar formation and adhesions, endometriosis, dysfunctional uterine bleeding and<br>
ocular diseases with retinal vessel proliferation including macular degeneration.<br>
VEGF is a key stimulus for vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. This cytokine induces a<br>
vascular sprouting phenotype by inducing endothelial cell proliferation, protease expression<br>
and migration, and subsequent organisation of cells to form a capillary tube (Keck, P.J.,<br>
Hauser, S.D., Krivi, G., Sanzo, K., Warren, T., Feder, J., and Connolly, D.T., Science<br>
(Washington DC), 246: 1309-1312, 1989; Lamoreaux, W.J., Fitzgerald, ME., Reiner, A.,<br>
Hasty, K.A., and Charles, S.T., Microvasc. Res., 55: 29-42, 1998; Pepper, M.S., Montesano,<br>
R., Mandroita, S.J., Orci, L. and Vassalli, J.D., Enzyme Protein, 49: 138-162, 1996.). In<br>
addition, VEGF induces significant vascular permeability (Dvorak, H.F., Detmar, M., Claffey,<br>
K.P., Nagy, J.A., van de Water, L., and Senger, D.R., (Int. Arch, Allergy ImmunoL, 107: 233-<br>
235, 1995; Bates, D.O., Heald, R.I., Curry, F.E. and Williams, B. J. Physiol. (Lond.), 533:<br>
263-272, 2001), promoting formation of a hyper-permeable, immature vascular network which<br>
is characteristic of pathological angiogenesis.<br>
It has been shown that activation of KDR alone is sufficient to promote all of the major<br>
phenotypic responses to VEGF, including endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and survival,<br>
and the induction of vascular permeability (Meyer, M., Clauss, M., Lepple-Wienhues, A.,<br>
Waltenberger, J., Augustin, H.G., Ziche, M., Lanz, C, Biittner, M., Rziha, H-J., and Dehio,<br>
C., EMBO J., 18: 363-374, 1999; Zeng, H., Sanyal, S. and Mukhopadhyay, D., J. Biol. Chem,<br>
276: 32714-32719, 2001; Gille, H., Kowalski, J., Li, B., LeCouter, J., Moffat, B, Zioncheck,<br>
T.R, Pelletier, N. and Ferrara, N., J. Biol. Chera, 276: 3222-3230, 2001).<br>
mtemational patent application publication number WO 00/47212 describes VEGF<br>
receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Compounds of WO 00/47212 possess activity against<br>
VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) such that they may be used in an amount sufficient to<br>
inhibit VEGF RTK whilst demonstrating no significant activity against EGF RTK. Their<br>
VEGF RTK inhibitory activity is due both to activity against KDR and against Flt-1, but<br>
generally they are more potent against KDR. Generally they have extended plasma<br>
pharmacokinetics. Some VEGF RTK inhibitors have been found to act as potassium channel<br>
blockers and are positive in a hERG assay; such activity may give rise to ECG<br>
(electrocardiogram) changes in vivo. Compounds of WO 00/47212 have predominantly basic<br>
side chains.<br>
Surprisingly we have now found compounds of the present invention to be very potent<br>
KDR inhibitors but to have less activity against Flt-1 than compounds of WO 00/47212, to<br>
have less extended plasma pharmacokinetics than compounds of WO 00/47212 and to be<br>
inactive or only weakly active in a hERG assay. Compounds of the present invention have<br>
predominantly neutral side chains. Compounds of the present invention have a beneficial<br>
toxicological profile compared to compounds of WO 00/47212.<br>

group is qualified by 'hereinbefore defined' or 'defined hereinbefore' the said group<br>
encompasses the first occurring and broadest definition as well as each and all of the preferred<br>
definitions for that group.<br>
In this specification unless stated otherwise the term "alky!" includes both straight<br>
and branched chain alkyl groups but references to individual alkyi groups such as "propyl" are<br>

Within the present invention it is to be understood that a compound of the formula I or<br>
a salt thereof may exhibit the phenomenon of tautomerism and that the formulae drawings<br>
within this specification can represent only one of the possible tautomeric forms. It is to be<br>
understood that the invention encompasses any tautomeric form which inhibits VEGF receptor<br>
tyrosine kinase activity and is not to be limited merely to any one tautomeric form utilised<br>
within the formulae drawings. The formulae drawings within this specification can represent<br>

encompasses all possible tautomeric forms of the compounds drawn not just those forms which<br>
it has been possible to show graphically herein.<br>
-57-<br>
It will be appreciated that compounds of the formula I or a salt thereof may possess an<br>
asymmetric carbon atom. Such an asymmetric carbon atom is also involved in the tautomerism<br>
described above, and it is to be understood that the present invention encompasses any chiral<br>
form (including both pure enautiomers, scalemic and racemic mixtures) as well as any<br>
tautomeric form which inhibits VEGF receptor tyro sine kinase activity, and is not to be limited<br>
merely to any one tautomeric form or chiral form utilised within the formulae drawings. It is to<br>
be understood that the invention encompasses all optical and diastereomers which inhibit<br>
VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity. It is further to be understood that in the names of<br>
chiral compounds (R,S) denotes any scalemic or racemic mixture while (^?) and (,$") denote the<br>
enautiomers. hi the absence of (R,S), (R) or (S) in the name it is to be understood that the<br>
name refers to any scalemic or racemic mixture, wherein a scalemic mixture contains R and S<br>
enautiomers in any relative proportions and a racemic mixture contains R and 5" enantiomers in<br>
the ration 50:50.<br>

exist in solvated as well as unsolvated forms such as, for example, hydrated forms. It is to be<br>
understood that the invention encompasses all such solvated forms which inhibit VEGF<br>
receptor tyrosine kinase activity.<br>
For the avoidance of any doubt, it is to be understood that when X1 is, for example, a<br>
group of formula -NRSC(O)-, it is the nitrogen atom bearing the R6 group which is attached to<br>
the quinazoline ring and the carbonyl (C(0)) group is attached to R5, whereas when X1 is, for<br>
example, a group of formula -C(O)NR7-, it is the carbonyl group which is attached to the<br>
quinazoline ring and the nitrogen atom bearing the R7 group is attached to R5. A similar<br>
convention applies to the other two atomX1 linking groups such as -NR9SOj- and -SC^NR8-.<br>
When X1 is -MR10- it is the nitrogen atom bearing the R10 group which is linked to the<br>
quinazoline ring and to R5. An analogous convention applies to other groups. It is further to<br>
be understood that when X1 represents -NR10- and R10 is CioalkoxyCz^alkyl it is the C2-3alkyl<br>
moiety which is linked to the nitrogen atom of X1 and an analogous convention applies to<br>

yi moiety which is linked to X1, similarly when R3 is, for example, a group of formula<br>
it is the Cz-jalkenyl moiety which is linked to X1 and an analogous convention<br>
applies to other groups. When R5 is a group l-R29prop-l-en-3-yl it is the first carbon to which<br>
the group R29 is attached and it is the third carbon which is linked to X1 and an analogous<br>
convention applies to other groups.<br>
For the avoidance of any doubt, it is to be understood that in a compound of the<br>
formula 1 when R5 is, for example, R28 and R28 is a pyrrolidinyl ring which bears a group -(-OXCMalkyl)<br>
gringD, it is the -O- or Ci^alkyl which is linked to the pyrrolidinyl ring, unless f and<br>
g are both 0 when it is ring D which is linked to the pyrrolidinyl ring and an analogous<br>
convention applies to other groups.<br>
For the avoidance of any doubt, it is to be understood that when R29 carries a Cj.<br>
4aminoalkyl substituent it is the Ci^alkyl moiety which is attached to R29 whereas when R29<br>
carries a Chalkylamino substituent it is the ainiuo moiety which is attached to R29 and an<br>
analogous convention applies to other groups.<br>

The present invention relates to the compounds of formula I as hereinbefore defined as<br>
well as to the salts thereof. Salts for use hi pharmaceutical compositions will be<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts, but other salts may be useful in die production of the<br>
compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts of the invention may, for example, include acid addition salts of the<br>
compounds of fonnula I as hereinbefore defined which are sufficiently basic to form such salts.<br>
Such acid addition salts include for example salts with inorganic or organic acids affording<br>
pharrnaceutically acceptable anious such as with hydrogen halides (especially hydrochloric or<br>
hydrobromic acid of which hydrochloric acid is particularly preferred) or with sulphuric or<br>
phosphoric acid, or with trifluoroacetic, citric or maleic acid. In addition where the<br>
compounds of formula I are sufficiently acidic, pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be<br>
formed with an inorganic or organic base which affords a pharmaceutically acceptable cation.<br>
Such salts with inorganic or organic bases include for example an alkali metal salt, such as a<br>
sodium or potassium salt, an alkaline earth metal salt such as a calcium or magnesium salt, an<br>
ammonium salt or for example a salt with methylamine, dimethylamine, trirnethylamine,<br>
piperidine, morpholine or tris-(2-hydroxyethyl)amine.<br>
A compound of the fonnula I, or salt thereof, and other compounds of the invention<br>
(as herein defined) may be prepared by any process known to be applicable to the preparation<br>
of chemically-related compounds. Such processes include, for example, those illustrated in<br>
International Patent Application Number WO 00/47212 and in European Patent Applications<br>
Publication Nos. 0520722, 0566226, 0602851 and 0635498. Such processes also include, for<br>
example, solid phase synthesis. Such processes, are provided as a further feature of the<br>
invention and are as described hereinafter. Necessary starting materials may be obtained by<br>
standard procedures of organic chemistry. The preparation of such starting materials is<br>
described within the accompanying non-limiting Examples. Alternatively necessary starting<br>
materials are obtainable by analogous procedures to those illustrated which are within the<br>
ordinary skill of an organic chemist.<br>
Thus, the following processes (a) to (f) and (i) to (vi) constitute further features of<br>
the present invention.<br>
Synthesis of Compounds of Formula I<br>
(a) Compounds of the formula I and salts thereof may be prepared by the reaction of a<br>
compound of the formula III:<br>
(Figure Remove) (wherein R2 and m are as defined hereinbefore and LL is a displaceable moiety), with a<br>
compound of the formula IV:<br>
ZH<br>
(IV)<br>
(wherein ring C, R1, Z and n are as defined hereinbefore) to obtain compounds of the formula I<br>
and salts thereof. A convenient displaceable moiety L1 is, for example, a halogeno, alkoxy<br>
(preferably Ci^alkoxy), aryloxy, alkylsulphanyl, arylsulphanyl, alkoxyalkylsulphanyl or<br>
sulphonyloxy group, for example a chloro, bromo, methoxy, phenoxy, methylsulphauyl, 2-<br>
methoxyethylsulphanyl, methanesulphouyloxy or toluene-4-sulphonyloxy group.<br>
The reaction is advantageously effected in the presence of a base. Such a base is, for<br>
example, an organic amine base such as, for example, pyridine, 2,6-lutidine, collidine,<br>
4-dimethylaminopyridine, triethylarnine, morpholine, N-methylmorpholine or<br>
diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene, tetramethylguanidine or for example, an alkali metal or<br>
alkaline earth metal carbonate or hydroxide, for example sodium carbonate, potassium<br>
carbonate, calcium carbonate, cesium carbonate, sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide.<br>
Alternatively such a base is, for example, an alkali metal hydride, for example sodium hydride,<br>
or an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal amide, for example sodium amide, sodium<br>
bis(trimethylsilyl)amide, potassium amide or potassium bis(trimethylsUyl)amide. The reaction<br>
is preferably effected in the presence of an inert solvent or diluent, for example an ether such as<br>
tetrahydrofuran or 1,4-dioxan, an aromatic hydrocarbon solvent such as toluene, or a dipolar<br>
aprotic solvent such as N,N-dimethylformarnide, N,N-dimethylacetamide,<br>
N-methylpyrrolidin-2-one or dimethyl sulphoxide. The reaction is conveniently effected at a<br>
temperature in the range, for example, 10 to 150°C, preferably in the range 20 to 90°C.<br>
Where R1 or R2 contains a heterocyclic ring with a substituent it is possible to add<br>
the substituent after process (a) above using standard procedures of organic chemistry. Thus<br>
for example a compound of formula III as defined hereinbefore but wherein R2 contains an<br>
unsubstituted heterocyclic ring may be reacted with a compound of formula IV as defined<br>
hereinbefore to give an intermediate compound in which R2 contains an unsubstituted<br>
heterocyclic ring. The intermediate compound can then be substituted on the heterocyclic ring<br>
in R2 using standard organic chemistry techniques to give a final compound of formula I.<br>
When it is desired to obtain the acid salt, the free base may be treated with an acid<br>
such as a hydrogen halide, for example hydrogen cllloride, sulphuric acid, a sulphonic acid, for<br>
example methane sulphonic acid, or a carboxylic acid, for example acetic or citric acid, using a<br>
conventional procedure.<br>
(b) Production of those compounds of formula I and salts thereof wherein at least one<br>
R2 is R5X', Q'X1, Q15W3 or Q21W4C1.5alkylX1, wherein R5, Q1, Q15, W3, Q21 and W4 are as<br>
defined hereinbefore, and X1 is -O-, -S-, -OC(O)- or -NR10- (wherein R10 independently<br>
represents hydrogen, Ci-salkyl or d.3alkoxyC2-3alkyl) can be achieved by the reaction,<br>
conveniently in the presence of a base (as defined hereinbefore in process (a)) of a compound<br>
of the formula V:<br>
HWorHX1<br>

rnoiety for example a halogeuo or sulphonyloxy group such as a bromo, methauesulphonyloxy<br>
or toluene-4-sulphonyloxy group, or L1 may be generated in situ from an alcohol under<br>
standard Mitsunobu conditions ("Organic Reactions", John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc, 1992, vol 42,<br>
chapter 2, David L Hughes). The reaction is preferably effected in the presence of a base (as<br>
defined hereinbefore in process (a)) and advantageously in the presence of an inert solvent or<br>
diluent (as defined hereinbefore in process (a)), advantageously at a temperature in the range,<br>
for example 10 to 150°C, conveniently at about 50°C.<br>
(c) Compounds of the formula I and salts thereof wherein at least one R2 is R5X\ Q'X1,<br>

example, the reduction may be effected by heating the nitro compound under hydrogen at 2<br>
atmospheres pressure in the presence of the activated metal and a solvent or diluent such as a<br>
mixture of water and alcohol, for example methanol or ethauol, at a temperature in the range,<br>

The compounds of formula III and salts thereof wherein at least one R2 is R5X' and<br>
wherein X1 is -NR6C(O)- or -NR9SC&gt;2- may be prepared for example from a compound of the<br>

 (wherein R2, W3 and s are as hereinbefore defined, X1 is as hereinbefore defined in this section<br>

A compound of formula XVIII is conveniently used in which L2 represents a<br>

deprotecting a compound of the formula XIX:<br>
 (wherein R2, W3, s and L2 are as hereinbefore defined, P1 is a protecting group and X1 is as<br>
hereinbefore defined in die section describing compounds of the formula XVIII). The choice<br>
of protecting group P1 is within the standard knowledge of an organic chemist, for example<br>
those included in standard texts such as "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis" T.W. Greene<br>
and R.G.M.Wuts, 2nd Ed. Wiley 1991, including N-sulphonyl derivatives (for example, ptoluenesulphonyl),<br>
carbamates (for example, t-butyl carbonyl), N-alkyl derivatives (for<br>
example, 2-chloroethyl, benzyl) and amino acetal derivatives (for example benzyloxymethyl).<br>
The removal of such a protecting group may be effected by any of the procedures known for<br>
such a transformation, including those reaction conditions indicated in standard texts such as<br>
that indicated hereinbefore, or by a related procedure. Deprotection may be effected by<br>
techniques well known in the literature, for example where P1 represents a benzyl group<br>
deprotection may be effected by hydrogenolysis or by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid.<br>
One compound of formula III may if desired be converted into another compound of<br>
formula III in which the moiety L1 is different. Thus for example a compound of formula III in<br>
which L1 is other than halogeno, for example optionally substituted phenoxy, may be converted<br>
to a compound of formula III in which L1 is halogeno by hydrolysis of a compound of formula<br>
III (in which L1 is other than halogeno) to yield a compound of formula XI as hereinbefore<br>
defined, followed by introduction of halide to the compound of formula XI, thus obtained as<br>

(ii) Compounds of formula IV and salts thereof in which ring C is indolyl may be<br>

John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd, edited by W. J. Houlihan.<br>
Examples of the preparation of indoles are given in Examples 1 and 10 hereinafter.<br>
Compounds of formula IV and salts thereof in which ring C is quiuolinyl may be<br>

Chemistry of Heterocycb'c Compounds: Quinolines Parts I, II and III", 1982 (Interscience<br>
publications) John Wiley &amp; Sous Ltd, edited by G. Jones, and in "Comprehensive Heterocyclic<br>
Chemistry Vol II by A. R. Katritzky", 1984 Pergamon Press, edited by A. J. Boulton and A<br>
McKillop.<br>
Compounds of formula IV and salts thereof in which ring C is indazolyl may be<br>

Petitcoles, Bull. Soc. Chiiu Fr. 1950, 466 and Davies, J. Chem. Soc. 1955, 2412.<br>
Compounds of formula IV and salts thereof in which ring C is azaindolyl may be<br>
prepared by any of the methods known in the art, such as for example those described in<br>
Heterocycles 50, (2), 1065-1080, 1999. They may also be made according to the process in<br>
Example 2 heren after.<br>
In Heterocycles 50, (2), 1065-1080, 1999 a process is described, shown in Scheme<br>
1 hereinafter, wherein 7-azaindole is halogenated to give 3,3,5-tribromo-2-oxo-l,3-<br>
dihydropyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine (12). 12 is then treated with zinc in acetic acid to give 5-<br>
bromo-2-oxo-l,3-dihydropyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridiiie (13) and 13 is then treated via two steps to<br>
give 5-bromo-7-azaindole (14). This synthesis is shown in Scheme 1:<br>
Scheme 1<br>
(Figure Remove)1<br>
Surprisingly we have found that it is better to synthesise the 5-bromo-7-azaindole by<br>
three steps outlined in Scheme 2:<br>
Scheme 2<br>
(Figure Remove)is surprisingly better than Scheme 1. Scheme 2 requires smaller quantities of<br>
reagent aud is more adaptable for large scale manufacture because it is cheaper, more efficient<br>
and more environmentally friendly than Scheme 1.<br>
Step 1:<br>
The reduction may be carried out by any of the procedures known for such a<br>
transformation. The reduction may be carried out, for example, by treating a solution of 7-<br>
azaindole in an alcohol, for example ethanol, or another solvent for example<br>
decahydronaphthalene, with wet Raney Nickel and then stirring the mixture in a hydrogen<br>
atmosphere under pressure, for example at 5 atmospheres pressure, at 50 to 150°C, preferably<br>
at about 95°C, over a period of time, for example 2 days, to give, after purification, 7-<br>
azaiudoline.<br>
The bromination may be carried out by any of the procedures Icnown for such a<br>
reaction. The bromination may be carried out, for example, by mixing 7-azaiudoline, p-toluene<br>
sulphonic acid monohydrate and l,3-dibromo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin in methylene chloride and<br>
stirring the mixture at for example ambient temperature for a period of time, for example 3<br>
hours. Extraction and purification gives 5-bromo-7-azaindoline.<br>
Step 3:<br>
The oxidation may be carried out by any of the procedures known for such a<br>
transformation. The oxidation may be carried out, for example, by mixing 5-bromo-7-<br>
azaiudoline and precipitated, active manganese (IV) oxide in toluene, then heating the mixture<br>
at 50 to 150°C, preferably at about 90°C to give 5-bromo-7-azaindole.<br>
In Heterocycles 50, (2), 1065-1080, 1999 the 5-bromo-7-azaindole (986rog, S.Ommol)<br>
is dissolved, under an inert atmosphere, in a mixture of DMF (32ml) and methanol (20ml). To<br>
this solution is added successively sodium methoxide (14.3g, 265mmol) and copper(I)bromide<br>
(1.43g, lO.Ommol) at ambient temperature. The mixture is heated at reflux for 2.5 hours to<br>
give, after extraction and purification, 5-methoxy-7-azaindole (530mg, 72%).<br>
We have found that the yield for this reaction is surprisingly and significantly increased<br>
from 72% to 97% if the reagents are used in proportionately smaller quantities including for<br>
example a different solvent mixture. Thus in Example 2 hereinafter:<br>
"A solution of 5-bromo-7-azaindole (8.6 g, 44 mmol), copper (I) bromide (12.6 g, 88<br>
mmol) and sodium methoxide (100 g, 1.85 mol) in a mixture of "degassed" DMF (260 mis)<br>
and methanol (175 mis) was stirred at ambient temperature in a nitrogen atmosphere, and then<br>
heated at reflux for 3.5 hours."<br>
After extraction and partial purification this gave crude solid, 5-methoxy-7-azaiudole<br>
(6.3 g, 97%), which was taken through the next step without further purification.<br>
The 5-hydroxy-7-azaindole may be generated from the 5-methoxy-7-azaiudole by the<br>
following process.<br>
Adding boron tribromide in methylene chloride to a solution of 5-methoxy-7-<br>
azaindole in methyleue chloride cooled at about -30°C. Leaving the mixture to warm up to<br>
ambient temperature and stirring it for a period of time, for example overnight. Pouring the<br>
mixture onto ice and water and adjusting the pH of the aqueous phase to about 6. Separating<br>
the organic phase and further extracting the aqueous phase with ethyl acetate. Combining the<br>
organic phases washing them with brine, drying them, for example over magnesium sulphate,<br>
and then evaporating them. The residue may then be purified, for example by column<br>
chromatography eluting with increasingly polar mixtures of methylene chloride and methanol<br>
to give 5-hydroxy-7-azaindole.<br>
Alternatively the 5-methoxy-7-azaindole may be suspended in methyleue chloride,<br>
stirred in a nitrogen atmosphere, cooled in a cold water bath and a 1.0 M solution of boron<br>
tribromide in methylene chloride added dropwise over a period of time, for example 30<br>
minutes. The mixture is then allowed to stir at ambient temperature for a period of time, for<br>
example 4 hours, before being quenched by taking the solution to about pH7, for example by<br>
the dropwise addition of 5N sodium hydroxide. The resulting 2 phase mixture is allowed to<br>
separate and the organic phase collected and evaporated in vacuo. The residue may be treated<br>
with the aqueous phase from above, the mixture adjusted to about pH7 once more and<br>
subjected to a continuous ethyl acetate extraction over a period of time for example 18 hours.<br>
The resulting ethyl acetate suspension is then evaporated in vacuo to give a product which may<br>
be purified, for example by column chromatography using Kieselgel 60 silica and methylene<br>
chloride/methanol/SSO ammonium hydroxide (100/8/1) solvent to give 5-hydroxyazaiudole.<br>

other L1 in a further position on the quinazoline ring may be the same or different) with a<br>
compound of the formula IV as hereinbefore defined, the reaction for example being effected<br>
by a process as described in (a) above.<br>
(v) Compounds of formula IX as defined hereinbefore and salts thereof may for example<br>

reaction may be effected for example by a process as described in (b) above,<br>
(vi) Intermediate compounds wherein X1 is -SO- or -S02- may be prepared by oxidation<br>
from the corresponding compound in which X1 is -S- or -SO- (when X1 is -SO:- is required in<br>
the final product). Conventional oxidation conditions and reagents for such reactions are well<br>
known to the skilled chemist.<br>
When a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a compound of the formula I is required,<br>
it may be obtained, for example, by reaction of said compound with, for example, an acid using<br>
a conventional procedure, the acid having a pharmaceutically acceptable anion.<br>
Many of the intermediates defined herein are novel and these are provided as a<br>

The identification of compounds which inhibit angiogenesis and/or increased vascular<br>
permeability, which potently inhibit the tyrosine kiuase activity associated with the VEGF<br>
receptor KDR and are selective for KDR over Flt-1, which have less extended plasma<br>
pharmacokinetics and which are inactive or only weakly active in the liERG assay, is desirable<br>
and is the subject of the present invention.<br>
These properties may be assessed, for example, using one or more of the procedures set out<br>
below:<br>
fa) In Vitro Receptor Tvrosine Kinase Inhibition Test<br>
This assay determines the ability of a test compound to inhibit tyrosine kinase<br>
activity. DNA encoding VEGF, FGF or EGF receptor cytoplasmic domains may be obtained<br>
by total gene synthesis (Edwards M, International Biotechnology Lab 5(3), 19-25, 1987) or by<br>
cloning. These may then be expressed in a suitable expression system to obtain polypeptide<br>
with tyrosine kinase activity. For example VEGF, FGF and EGF receptor cytoplasmic<br>
domains, which were obtained by expression of recombinaut protein in insect cells, were found<br>
to display intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. In the case of the VEGF receptor Flt-1 (Genbank<br>
accession number X51602), a 1.7kb DNA fragment encoding most of the cytoplasmic domain,<br>
commencing with methiouine 783 and including the termination codon, described by Shibuya<br>
et al (Oticogeue, 1990, 5: 519-524), was isolated from cDNA and cloned into a baculovirus<br>
transplacement vector (for example pAcYMl (see The Baculovirus Expression System: A<br>
Laboratory Guide, L.A. King and R. D. Possee, Chapman and Hall, 1992) or pAc360 or<br>
pBlueBacHis (available from Invitrogen Corporation)). This recombinant construct was cotrausfected<br>
into insect cells (for example Spodoptera frugiperda 2 l(Sf21)) with vkal DNA (eg<br>
Pharmingen BaculoGold) to prepare recombinant baculovirus. (Details of the methods for the<br>
assembly of recombinant DNA molecules and the preparation and use of recombinant<br>
baculovirus can be found in standard texts for example Sambrook et al, 1989, Molecular<br>
cloning - A Laboratory Manual, 2nd edition, Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory Press and<br>
O'Reilly et al, 1992, Baculovirus Expression Vectors - A Laboratory Manual, W. H. Freeman<br>
and Co, New York). For other tyrosine kinases for use in assays, cytoplasmic fragments<br>
starting from methionine 806 (KDR, Genbank accession number L04947), methionine 668<br>
(EGF receptor, Genbank accession number X00588) and methioniue 399 (FGF Rl receptor,<br>
Genbank accession number X51803) may be cloned and expressed in a similar manner.<br>
For expression of cFlt-1 tyrosine kinase activity, Sf21 cells were infected with<br>
plaque-pure cFlt-1 recombinant virus at a multiplicity of infection of 3 and harvested 48 hours<br>
later. Harvested cells were washed with ice cold phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS)<br>
(lOmM sodium phosphate pH7.4, 138mM sodium chloride, 2.7mM potassium chloride) then<br>
resuspended in ice cold HNTG/PMSF (20mM Hepes pH7.5, 150mM sodium chloride, 10%<br>

lOOmM solution in methanol) using 1ml HNTG/PMSF per 10 million cells. The suspension<br>
was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 13,000 rpm at 4°C, the supernatant (enzyme stock) was<br>
removed and stored in aliquots at -70°C. Each new batch of stock enzyme was titrated in the<br>
assay by dilution with enzyme diluent (lOOmM Hepes pH 7.4, 0.2mM sodium orthovanadate,<br>
0.1% v/v Triton X100, 0.2mM dithiothreitol). For a typical batch, stock enzyme is diluted 1 in<br>
2000 with enzyme diluent and 50jal of dilute enzyme is used for each assay well.<br>
A stock of substrate solution was prepared from a random copolymer containing<br>
tyrosine, for example Poly (Glu, Ala, Tyr) 6:3:1 (Sigma P3899), stored as 1 mg/ml stock in<br>
PBS at -20°C and diluted 1 in 500 with PBS for plate coating.<br>
Oa the day before the assay lOOfxl of diluted substrate solution was dispensed into<br>
all wells of assay plates (Nunc maxisorp 96-well immunoplates) which were sealed and left<br>
overnight at 4°C.<br>
On the day of the assay the substrate solution was discarded and the assay plate<br>
wells were washed once withPBST (PBS containing 0.05% v/v Tween 20) and once with<br>
50mM Hepes pH7.4.<br>
Test compounds were diluted with 10% dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) and 25JJ.1 of<br>
diluted compound was transferred to wells in die washed assay plates. "Total" control wells<br>
contained 10% DMSO instead of compound. Twenty five microlitres of 40rnM<br>
mangauese(n)chloride containing 8|aM adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) was added to all test<br>
wells except "blank" control wells which contained maugauese(II)chloride without ATP. To<br>
start the reactions 50fJ,l of freshly diluted enzyme was added to each well and the plates were<br>
incubated at ambient temperature for 20 minutes. The liquid was then discarded and the wells<br>
were washed twice with PBST. One hundred microlitres of mouse IgG anti-phospho tyro sine<br>
antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc. product 05-321), diluted 1 in 6000 withPBST<br>
containing 0.5% w/v bovine serum albumin (BSA), was added to each well and the plates were<br>
incubated for 1 hour at ambient temperature before discarding the liquid and washing the wells<br>
twice with PBST. One hundred micro litres of horse radish peroxidase (HRP)-linked sheep<br>
anti-mouse Ig antibody (Amersham product NXA 931), diluted 1 in 500 with PBST containing<br>
0.5% w/v BSA, was added and the plates were incubated for 1 hour at ambient temperature<br>
before discarding the liquid and washing the wells twice with PBST. One hundred microlitres<br>
of 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzmiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) solution, freshly prepared<br>
using one 50mg ABTS tablet (Boehringer 1204 521) in 50ml freshly prepared 50mM<br>
phosphate-citrate buffer pH5.0 + 0.03% sodium perborate (made with 1 phosphate citrate<br>
buffer with sodium perborate (PCSB) capsule (Sigma P4922) per 100ml distilled water), was<br>
added to each well. Plates were then incubated for 20-60 minutes at ambient temperature until<br>
the optical density value of the "total" control wells, measured at 405nm using a plate reading<br>
spectrophotometer, was approximately 1.0. "Blank" (no ATP) and "total" (no compound)<br>
control values were used to determine the dilution range of test compound which gave 50%<br>
inhibtion of enzyme activity.<br>
rb\In Vitro HUVEC Proliferation Assay<br>
This assay detennines the ability of a test compound to inhibit the growth factorstimulated<br>
proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC).<br>
HUVEC cells were isolated in MCDB 131 (Gibco BRL) + 7.5% v/v foetal calf<br>
serum (PCS) and were plated out (at passage 2 to 8), in MCDB 131 + 2% v/v PCS + 3M.g/ml<br>
hepariu + l|o,g/ml hydrocortisone, at a concentration of 1000 cells/well in 96 well plates. After<br>
a minimum of 4 hours they were dosed with the appropriate growth factor (i.e. VEGF 3ng/ml,<br>
EGF 3ng/ml or b-FGF 0.3ng/ml) and compound. The cultures were then incubated for 4 days<br>
at 37°C with 7.5% CO2. On day 4 the cultures were pulsed with luCi/well of tritiatedthymidine<br>
(Amersham product TRA 61) and incubated for 4 hours. The cells were harvested<br>
using a 96-wel] plate harvester (Tomtek) and then assayed for incorporation of tritium with a<br>
Beta plate counter. Incorporation of radioactivity into cells, expressed as cpm, was used to<br>
measure inhibition of growth factor-stimulated cell proliferation by compounds.<br>
fc) hi Vivo Solid Tumour Disease Model<br>
This test measures the capacity of compounds to inhibit solid tumour growth.<br>
CaLu-6 tumour xeuografts were established in the flank of female athymic Swiss<br>
nu/nu mice, by subcutaneous injection of IxlO6 CaLu-6 cells/mouse in 100/zl of a 50% (v/v)<br>
solution of Matrigel in serum free culture medium. Ten days after cellular implant, mice were<br>
allocated to groups of 8-10, so as to achieve comparable group mean volumes. Tumours were<br>
measured using vernier calipers and volumes were calculated as: (/ x w) x V(Z x w) x (u/6) ,<br>
where / is the longest diameter and w the diameter perpendicular to the longest. Test<br>
compounds were administered orally once daily for a minimum of 21 days, and control animals<br>
received compound diluent. Tumours were measured twice weekly. The level of growth<br>
inhibition was calculated by comparison of the mean tumour volume of the control group<br>
versus the treatment group using a Student T test and/or a Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test.<br>
The inhibitory effect of compound treatment was considered significant when p
(d) hERG-encoded Potassium Channel Inhibition Test<br>
This assay determines the ability of a test compound to inhibit the tail current flowing<br>
through the human ether-a-go-go-related-gene (hERG)-encoded potassium channel.<br>
Human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells expressing the hERG-encoded channel were<br>
grown in Minimum Essential Medium Eagle (EMEM; Sigma-Aldrich catalogue number<br>
M2279), supplemented with 10% Foetal Calf Serum (Labtech International; product number<br>
4-101-500), 10% Ml serum-free supplement (Egg Technologies; product number 70916) and<br>
0.4 mg/ml Geneticin G418 (Sigma-Aldrich; catalogue number G7034). One or two days<br>
before each experiment, the cells were detached from the tissue culture flasks with Accutase<br>
(TCS Biologicals) using standard tissue culture methods. They were then put onto glass<br>
coverslips resting in wells of a 12 well plate and covered with 2 ml of the growing media.<br>
For each cell recorded, a glass coverslip containing the cells was placed at the bottom<br>
of a Perspex chamber containing bath solution (see below) at ambient temperature (-20 °C).<br>
This chamber was fixed to the stage of an inverted, phase-contrast microscope. Immediately<br>
after placing the coverslip in the chamber, bath solution was perfused into the chamber from a<br>
gravity-fed reservoir for 2 minutes at a rate of - 2 ml/ruin. After this time, perfusion was<br>
stopped.<br>
A patch pipette made from borosilicate glass tubing (GC120F, Harvard Apparatus)<br>
using a P-97 micropipette puller (Sutter Instrument Co.) was filled with pipette solution (see<br>
hereinafter). The pipette was connected to the headstage of die patch clamp amplifier<br>
(Axopatch 200B, Axon Instruments) via a silver/silver chloride wire. The headstage ground<br>
was connected to the earth electrode. This consisted of a silver/silver chloride wire embedded<br>
in 3% agar made up with 0.85% sodium chloride.<br>
The cell was recorded in the whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique.<br>
Following "break-in", which was done at a holding potential of-80 mV (set by the amplifier),<br>
and appropriate adjustment of series resistance and capacitance controls, electrophysiology<br>
software (Clampex, Axon Instruments) was used to set a holding potential (-80 mV) and to<br>
deliver a voltage protocol. This protocol was applied every 15 seconds and consisted of a 1 s<br>
step to +40 mV followed by a 1 s step to -50 mV. The current response to each imposed<br>
voltage protocol was low pass filtered by the amplifier at 1 kHz. The filtered signal was then<br>
acquired, on line, by digitising this analogue signal from the amplifier with an analogue to<br>
digital converter. The digitised signal was then captured on a computer running Clampex<br>
software (Axou Instruments). During the holding potential and the step to + 40 mV the<br>
current was sampled at 1 kHz. The sampling rate was then set to 5 kHz for the remainder of<br>
the voltage protocol.<br>
The compositions, pH and osmolarity of the bath and pipette solution are tabulated<br>
below.<br>
(Figure Remove)The amplitude of die hERG-encoded potassium channel tail current following the<br>
step from +40 mV to -50 mV was recorded on-line by Clampex software (Axon Instruments).<br>
Following stabilisation of the tail current amplitude, bath solution containing the vehicle for the<br>
test substance was appb'ed to the cell. Providing die vehicle application had no significant<br>
effect on tail current amplitude, a cumulative concentration effect curve to the compound was<br>
then constructed.<br>
The effect of each concentration of test compound was quantified by expressing the<br>
tail current amplitude in the presence of a given concentration of test compound as a<br>
percentage of that in the presence of vehicle.<br>
Test compound potency (ICso) was determined by fitting the percentage inhibition<br>
values making up the concentration-effect to a four parameter Hill equation using a standard<br>
data-fitting package. If the level of inhibition seen at the highest test concentration did not<br>
exceed 50%, no potency value was produced and a percentage inhibition value at that<br>
concentration was quoted.<br>
Plasma pharmacokinetics may be assessed by measuring plasma half-life in vivo. The<br>
longer the plasma half-life in vivo the more extended are the plasma pharmacokiuetics.<br>
-83-<br>
Compoiuids of the present invention have less extended plasma pharmacokinetics than<br>
compounds of WO 00/47212. Compounds of the present invention have shorter half-lives in<br>
vivo than compounds of WO 00/47212.<br>
Plasma half-life in vivo may be determined by standard methods which are wellknown<br>
in the art of plasma pharmacokinetics. Any species may be used and the plasma halflife<br>
determined by standard methodology, for example plasma half-life may be measured in rat,<br>
dog, monkey or human.<br>

dose within the range 5-5000mg per square metre body area of the animal, i.e. approximately<br>
0. l-100mg/kg. A unit dose in the range, for example, l-100mg/kg, preferably l-50mg/kg is<br>
envisaged and this normally provides a therapeutically-effective dose. A unit dose form such<br>

of the formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as defined hereinbefore for use in<br>
a method of treatment of the human or animal body by therapy.<br>
We have found that compounds of the present invention inhibit VEGF receptor<br>
tyro sine kinase activity and are therefore of interest for their autiangio genie effects and/or their<br>
