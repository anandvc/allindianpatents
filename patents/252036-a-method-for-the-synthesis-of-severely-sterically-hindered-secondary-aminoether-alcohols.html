				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]     The present invention relates to a method for the preparation of severely sterically hindered secondary aminoether alcohols which are useful in the removal of hydrogen sulfide from gaseous streams containing hydrogen sulfide and which may also contain carbon dioxide.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
[0002]     It is well-known in the art to treat gases and liquids, such as mixtures containing acidic gases including CO2, H2S, CS2, HCN, COS and oxygen and sulfur derivatives of C1 to C4 hydrocarbons with amine solutions to remove<br>
these acidic gases. The amine usually contacts the acidic gases and the liquids as an aqueous solution containing the amine in an absorber tower with the aqueous amine solution contacting the acidic fluid countercurrently. Usually this contacting results in the simultaneous removal of substantial amounts of both the CO2 and H2S. USP 4,112,052, for example, utilizes a sterically hindered amine to obtain nearly complete removal of CO2 and H2S acid gases. This process is particularly suitable for systems in which the partial pressures of the CO2 and related gases are low. For systems where the partial pressure of<br>
CO2 is high or where there are many acid gases present, e.g., H2S, COS,<br>
CH3SH, CS2, etc., a process utilizing an amine in combination with a physical<br>
absorbent, referred to as a "non-aqueous solvent process" is practiced. Such a system is described in USP 4,112,051.<br>
[0003]     Selective removal of H2S from acid gas systems containing both H2S and CO2, however, is very desirable. Such selective removal results in a<br>
relatively high H2S/CO2 ratio in the separated acid gas which facilitates the<br>
subsequent conversion of the H2S to elemental sulfur in the Glaus process.<br>
[0004] The typical reactions of aqueous secondary and tertiary amines with<br>
CO2 and H2S can be represented as follows:<br>
where R is the same or different organic radical and may be substituted with a<br>
hydroxyl group. Because the reactions are reversible they are sensitive to the<br>
CO2 and H2S partial pressures which is determinative of the degree to which the<br>
reactions occur.<br>
[0005] Selective HS removal is particularly desirable in systems having low<br>
H2S/CO2 ratios and relatively low H2S partial pressures as compared to that of<br>
the CO2- The ability of amine to selectivity remove H2$ in such systems is very<br>
low.<br>
[0006] Solutions of primary and secondary amines such as monoethanolamine<br>
(MEA), diethanolamine (DEA), diisopropanolamine (DPA), and<br>
hydroxyethoxyethylamine (DEA) absorb both H2S and CC2, and thus have<br>
proven unsatisfactory for the selective removal of H2S to the exclusion of CO2-<br>
The CO2 forms carbamates with such amines relatively easily.<br>
 [0007] H2S has been selectively removed from gases containing H2S and<br>
CO2 by use of diisopropanolamine (DIPA) either alone or mixed with a nonaqueous<br>
physical solvent such as sulfolane. Contact times, however, must be<br>
kept short to take advantage of the faster reaction of H2S with the amine as<br>
compared to the rate of CO2 reaction with the amine.<br>
[0008] Frazier and Kohl, Ind. and Eng. Chem., 42,2288 (1950) showed that<br>
the tertiary amine methydiethanolamine (MDEA) is more selective toward H2S<br>
absorption as compared to C&amp;2- C(2 reacts relatively slowly with tertiary<br>
amines as compared to the rapid reaction of the tertiary amine with H2S.<br>
However, it has the disadvantage of having a relatively low H2S loading<br>
capacity and limited ability to reduce the H2S content to the desired level at low<br>
H2S pressures encountered in certain gases.<br>
[0009] UK Patent Publication No. 2,017,524A discloses the use of aqueous<br>
solutions of dialkylmonoalkanolamines, e.g., diethylmonoethanol amine<br>
(DEAE), for the selective removal of H2S, such material having higher<br>
selectivity and capacity for H2$ removal at higher loading levels than MDEA.<br>
DEAE, however, has the disadvantage of a low boiling point of 161 °C, making it<br>
relatively highly volatile resulting in large material loss.<br>
[0010] USP 4,471,138 the entire teaching of which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference, teaches severely sterically hindered acyclic secondary aminoether<br>
alcohols having a high selectivity for H2S compared to CO2- Selectivity is<br>
maintained at high H2S and CC2 loadings.<br>
[0011] The severely sterically hindered acyclic amine ether alcohols of USP<br>
4,471,138 are represented by the general formula:<br>
wherein RI and R2 are each independently selected from the group consisting of<br>
alkyl and hydroxyalkyl radicals having 1-4 carbon atoms, R$, R4, RS and Rg are<br>
each independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, and<br>
hydroxyalkyl radicals having 1-4 carbon atoms, with the proviso that at least one<br>
of R4 or RS bonded to the carbon atom which is directly bonded to the nitrogen<br>
atom is an alkyl or hydroxyalkyl radical when R3 is hydrogen, x and y are each<br>
positive integers ranging from 2-4, and z is a positive integer ranging from 1-4.<br>
These materials are prepared by a high temperature reaction preferably in the<br>
presence of a solvent, of a secondary or tertiary alkyl primary amine with an<br>
ether alcohol containing a carbonyl functionality in the presence of a source of<br>
hydrogen or with a haloalkoxyalkanol. Preferably the composition is of the<br>
general formula:<br>
wherein:<br>
R! = R2 = R3 = CH3CH2-; R4 = RS = Re = H; or<br>
R! # R2 # R3 = H, CH3-, CH3CH2-; R4 # R5 # Re = H, CH3-;<br>
and where x = 2 or 3.<br>
 [0012] U.S. Patent 4,487,967 is directed to a process for preparing severely<br>
sterically hindered secondary aminoether alcohols by reacting a primary amino<br>
compound with a polyalkenyl ether glycol in the presence of a hydrogenation<br>
catalyst at elevated temperatures and pressures. The primary amino compounds<br>
employed have a general formula:<br>
R1 -NH2<br>
where R is selected from the group consisting of secondary or tertiary alkyl<br>
radicals having 3 to 8 carbon atoms or cycloalkyl radicals having 3 to 8 carbon<br>
atoms. The polyalkenyl ether glycols employed have the general formula:<br>
where R2, RS, R4 and RS are each independently selected from the group<br>
consisting of hydrogen, Cj-C4 alkyl radicals, and C3-Cg cycloalkyl radicals,<br>
with the proviso that if the carbon atom of Rj directly attached to the nitrogen<br>
atom is secondary, at least one of R2 and R3 directly bonded to the carbon which<br>
is bonded to the hydroxyl group is as alkyl or cycloalkyl radical, x and y are<br>
each positive integers independently ranging from 2 to 4 and z is from 1 to 10,<br>
preferably 1 to 6, more preferably 1 to 4. The process is carried out in the<br>
presence of a catalytically effective amount of a supported Group VDI metal<br>
containing hydrogenation catalyst at elevated temperatures and pressure and the<br>
mole ratio of amino compound to polyalkenyl ether glycol is less than 2:1 when<br>
z is greater than 1.<br>

hindered secondary aminoether alcohols of the general formula 1:<br>

[0018] The reaction of two such components yields acyl sulfonates 5a, 5b, 5c<br>
and 5d. The reaction can be conducted at a temperature in the range of between<br>
about -20 to 200°C, preferably about -20 to 150°C, more preferably about 0 to<br>
120°C, and a pressure between about 1 bar to 100 bars, preferably about 1 bar to<br>
50 bars, more preferably about 1 bar to 10 bars.<br>
[0019] The reaction can be carried out neat, that is, in the absence of any<br>
solvent provided one or the other of the reactants in a liquid and capable of<br>
dissolving the non-liquid reactant, or both are liquid. Alternatively, an inert<br>
added solvent can be used such as sulfolane, hexanes or acetonitrile. Preferably<br>
the dioxane for the subsequent cleavage reaction is used as the solvent resulting<br>
in all three reactants being present in a unified first step wherein the reaction<br>
mixture contains the dioxane, organic carboxylic acid or salt thereof and the<br>
sulfonyl halide, sulfuryl halide, mixed sulfuryl ester halide or mixed sulfuryl<br>
amide halide. This reaction mixture can then be reacted under the conditions<br>
subsequently described for the dioxane cleavage reaction, yielding the cleavage<br>
product described by general formula 4.<br>
[0020] The sulfonate 5a and/or 5b are reacted with a 1,4-dioxane, which is<br>
typically of the formula:<br>
Other substituted isomers can be readily envisioned. Preferably, the 1,4-dioxane<br>
 [0021] Reaction at elevated temperature is for a time sufficient to cleave the<br>
dioxane ring and to achieve about 60-90% conversion to cleavage product. The<br>
dioxane also serves as the solvent for the reaction. The molar ratio of dioxane to<br>
sulfonate can range from about 1:1 to about 10:1, preferably about 1:1 to about<br>
8:1, most preferably about 1:1 to about 5:1. The reaction can be carried out in<br>
the absence of any added solvent, e.g., the dioxane serving as the solvent, or an<br>
additional solvent such as acetonitrile or toluene can be used, the reaction being<br>
conducted at temperatures between about 50°C to about 200°C, preferably about<br>
70°C to about 160°C, more preferably about 80°C to about 140°C.<br>
[0022] Preferably, the reaction is carried out in the absence of any added<br>
solvent, the dioxane serving as both reactant and solvent, at a temperature in the<br>

more preferably about 80°C to about 140°C.<br>
[0023] The dioxane cleavage step recited above are described in greater detail<br>
by Karger and Mazur in "The Cleavage of Ethers by Mixed Sulfonic-Carboxylic<br>
Anhydrides", Journal of the American Chemical Society, 1968, 90, 3878-3879.<br>

[0024] The cleavage product 7a and/or 7b and/or 7c and/or 7d is then<br>
aminated with an amine 8 typically of the formula:<br>

i i »for a time sufficient to replace the -O-SO2~R or the sulfonate group in 7a<br>
and/or 7b and/or 7c and/or 7d by the amine 8. In the case of the amination of<br>
materials 7a, 7c and 7d, the amine to sulfonate group mole ratio is in the range<br>
of about 1:1 to about 10:1, preferably about 1:1 to about 8:1, more preferably<br>
about 1:1 to 4:1, while in the case of the amination of material 7b the amine to<br>
sulfonate group ratio is in the range of about 2:1 to about 10:1, preferably about<br>
2:1 to about 8:1, more preferably about 2:1 to about 4:1. Expressed differently,<br>
in general the amine to group being replaced mole ratio can range from about<br>
stoichiometric to about 10:1, preferably about stoichiometric to about 8:1, more<br>
preferably about stoichiometric to about 4:1.<br>
[0025] This amination step can be carried out under any conditions typical in<br>
the art. Amination can be conducted at atmospheric or at elevated pressure,<br>
elevated pressure being especially suitable when amination is performed using<br>
relatively low boiling amines such as f-butyl amine.<br>
[0026] The amination can be conducted at pressures of from about<br>
atmospheric (1 bar) to about 100 bars, preferably about 1 to about 50 bars, and at<br>
temperatures of from about 40°C to about 200°C, preferably about 40°C to about<br>
125°C. The amination can be performed using reflux, but this is not absolutely<br>
necessary. An inert solvent can be optionally used, such as benzene, toluene,<br>
diethyl ether, hexane, and the like.<br>
[0027] Finally, the resultant 9<br>
is hydrolyzed using a base to yield the final desired product 1. Typical bases<br>
include an alkali metal hydroxide, an alkali metal carbonate, or an alkali metal<br>
alkoxide, such as sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium methoxide,<br>
sodium tert-butoxide, etc. Reaction is conducted at from about 20°C to about<br>
110°C, preferably about 20°C to about 50°C. Reaction under reflux is effective<br>
and a desirable technique.<br>
[0028] Use of a solvent is optional for the hydrolysis reaction, one being used<br>
if the reactants are not already in the liquid form. Solvents can include water, or<br>
alcohol and mixtures thereof.<br>
[0029] If alcohols are used, they can be of the same carbon number or are the<br>
same alcohols from which the alkoxide bases themselves are derived. Thus,<br>
methanol would be a suitable solvent to use where the base is an alkali<br>
methoxide.<br>

terf-butylamine (8.4 mL, 5.85 g, 80 mmol) were added to the residue and the<br>
mixture was gently refluxed for 24 hours. The reaction mixture was then cooled<br>

carboxylic acid or salt thereof with a sulfonyl halide, sulfuryl halide, mixed<br>
