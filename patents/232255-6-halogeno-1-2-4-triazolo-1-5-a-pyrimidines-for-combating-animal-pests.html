The present invention relates to 6-halogeno-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidines for combating animal pests.<br>
Animal pests destroy growing and harvested crops and attack wooden dwelling and commercial structures, causing large economic loss to the food supply and to property.

The 6-halogeno-[1,2,4]triazolo-[1,,5-a]pyrimidines of the formula I according to the present invention can be prepared, for example, similarly to a process desC1-ibed in Phar-mazie, 1971, 26, 534 ff or in DD 99 794. The synthesis is shown in Scheme 1.<br><br><br>
In Scheme 1, the variables R\ R2, R3, R4 and X are as defined above. The reaction of a 6,7-dihalogeno-[1,2,4]triazolo-[1,5-a]pyrimidine of the formula II with an amine of the formula III may be carried out in the presence or absence of a solvent. Suitable solvents are all solvents which are inert under the reaction conditions, such as aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons such as hexane, petrol ether, cyclohexane, benzene, toluene, xylenes, ethers, for example dialkyl ethers, such as diethyl ether, methyl tert-butyl ether, cyclic ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran or dioxane, halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane or trichloromethane or C1-C4-alkanols such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, iso-propanol, n-butanol or tert-butanol, water or mixtures of these solvents. It is preferred that the reaction is carried out in the presence of a solvent. If the reaction is carried out in the absence of a solvent, the amine (III) is employed in a large excess, based on 6,7-dihalogeno-[1,2,4]triazolo-[1,5-a]pyrimidin II.<br>
It is also preferred that the reaction is carried out in the presence of a base. Suitable bases include organic bases, for example tertiary amines, such as trimethylamine, triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine and N-methylpiperidine, pyridine, substituted pyri-dines such as collidine, 2,3-lutidine, 2,4-lutidine or 2,5-lutidine and inorganic bases, for example alkali metal carbonates and alkaline earth metal carbonates such as lithium carbonate, potassium carbonate and sodium carbonate, calcium carbonate and alkali metal hydrogencarbonates such as sodium hydrogen carbonate. An excess of the amine III may serve as base.<br>
The reaction temperature is usually in the range of from 0°C to the boiling of the solvent, preferably of from 20 to the 120°C.<br>
The molar ratio of amine III to 6,7-dihalogeno-[1,2,4]triazoIo-[1,5-a]pyrimidine II is generally at least 0.9:1, preferably at least 1:1. It may be advantageous to employ the amine III in a slight excess, for example of up to 20%, based on the 6,7-dihalogeno-[1,2,4]triazolo-[1,5-a]pyrimidine II.<br>
In general, the base is employed in at least equimolar amount to a 2-fold molar excess, based on the 6,7-dihalogeno-[1,2,4]triazolo-[1,5-a]pyrimidine II. It may be advanta-<br><br>
geous to employ the base in a slight excess, for example up to 30%, based on the 6,7-dihalogeno-[1 ,2,4]triazolo-[1 ,5-a]pyrimidine II.<br>
The reaction mixtures are worked up in a customary manner, for example by adding diluted acids, for example mineral acids such as diluted hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid and sulfuric acid or aqueous organic acids such as trifluoroacetic acid or acetic acid, aqueous hydrochloric acid being preferred, phase separation and, if appropriate, chromatographic purification, reC1-ystallization, trituration or digestion. The compounds according to the present invention are in general oils, resinous compounds or predominantly C1-ystalline solid materials.<br>
From the preparation, the compounds of formula I may be obtained as isomer mixtures (stereoisomers, enantiomers). If desired, these can be resolved by the methods customary for this purpose, such as C1-ystallization or chromatography, also on optically active adsorbate, to give the pure isomers.<br>
Some of the amines of the formula III which are employed as starting materials are commercially available. Other may be prepared by processes known in the art, for example, by conversion of the corresponding alcohols into its tosylates which are then converted to the phthalimido derivatives. The phthalimido derivatives are converted to the desired amines by using hydrazine or any other suitable cleavage agent using conventional methods [e.g. J. Am. Soc., Vol. 117, p. 7025 (1995); WO 93/20804]; by reduction of the corresponding nitriles [see, Heterocycles, Vol. 35, p. 2 (1993); Synthetic Commun., Vol. 25, p. 413 (1995); Tetrahedron Lett., p. 2933 (1995)], or by reductive amination of ketones (see, J. Am. Chem. Soc., Vol. 122, p. 9556 (2000); Org. Lett., p. 731 (2001), J. Med. Chem., p. 1566 (1988); by conversion of the appropriate halo-genides and, if appropriate, followed by alkylation. Alternatively, the amine may be carried out by addition of Grignard reagents to imines (see R.B. Moffett, Org. Synth.iV, 605 (1963)). Furthermore, the radical R4 may be introduced by Grignard reaction to nitriles or carboxylic acid anhydrides (see J. Org. Chem. p. 5056 (1992); Tetrahedron Lett., S. 29933 (1995)). If individual amines III are not disclosed in the cited literature they can be either obtained by routes desC1-ibed above or they can be prepared by de-rivatization of other compounds III or by customary modifications of the synthesis routes desC1-ibed above.<br>
The starting materials of the formula II may be prepared in two steps, in analogy to the process desC1-ibed in Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1959, Vol. 7, p. 903. The synthesis is shown in Scheme 2.<br><br><br>
In Scheme 2, the variables R1, R2 and X are as defined above, X' is halogen, R is alkyl, preferably C1-C6-alkyl, in particular methyl or ethyl and Hal means a halogenating agent. In the first step the 5-aminotriazole of the general formula IV is reacted with the malonic ester of the general formula V. The reaction may be carried out under alkaline conditions, preferably using high boiling tertiary amines as for example tri-n-butylamine. The 5-aminotriazoles IV are commercially available or can be prepared in analogy to the methods which are well known in the art.<br>
In the second step of Scheme 2 the resulting 6-halogeno-7-hydroxy-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine of the general formula VI is treated with a halogenating agent, preferably with a brominating or chlorinating agent Suitable halogenating agents include inorganic acid halides, preferably acid chlorides or acide bromides such as thionyl chloride, thionyl bromide, phosphorus oxychloride, sulfuryl chloride, phosphorus pentachloride or phosphorus tribromide, phosphorus trichloride and mixtures of these. If phosphorus oxychloride is used as a halogenating agent, the reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of a mineral acid, such as polyphosphoric acid and pyridinium salts such as pyridinium bromide or chloride. Preferred halogenating agents are POCI3l PCI3/CI2 or PCI5 and mixtures of these. The reaction can be carried out in the presence or absence of a solvent. The acid halides thionylchloride, phoshorus trichloride or phos-phoryl chloride may simultaneous act as solvent. Suitable solvents are furthermore acetonitrile or dichloromethane. The halogenating agent is generally used in at least equimolar amounts, based on the 6-halogeno-7-hydroxy-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine of the general formula VI. The reaction is suitable carried out at a temperature in the range from 0°C to 150°C, the preferred reaction temperature being from 80°C to 125°C.<br>

The compounds of the formula 1 are preferably used for controlling pests of the orders Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, Homoptera and Acarina.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) or the pesticidal compositions comprising them may be used to protect growing plants and C1-ops from attack or infestation by animal pests, especially insects, acaridae or arachnids by contacting the plant/C1-op with a pesticidally effective amount of compounds of formula (I). The term "crop" refers both to growing and harvested C1-ops.<br>
The animal pest, especially the insect, acaridae, arachnid, plant and/or soil or water in which the plant is growing can be contacted with the present compound(s) 1 or compositions) containing them by any application method known in the art. As such, "contacting" includes both direct contact (applying the compounds/compositions directly on the animal pest, especially the insect, acaridae and/or arachnid, and/or plant - typically to the foliage, stem or roots of the plant) and indirect contact (applying the compounds/compositions to the locus of the animal pest, especially the insect, acaridae, and/or arachnid, and/or plant).<br>
Moreover, animal pests, especially insects, acaridae or arachnids may be controlled by contacting the target pest, its food supply or its locus with a pesticidally effective amount of compounds of formula (I). As such, the application may be carried out before or after the infection of the locus, growing C1-ops, or harvested C1-ops by the pest.<br><br>
"Locus" means a habitat, breeding ground, plant, seed, soil, area, material or environment in which a pest or parasite is growing or may grow.<br>
Effective amounts suitable for use in the method of invention may vary depending upon the particular formula I compound, target pest, method of application, application timing, weather conditions, animal pest habitat, especially insect, arachnid or acarid habitat, or the like. In general, for use in treating C1-op plants, the rate of application of the compounds I and/or compositions according to this invention may be in the range of about 0.1 g to about 4000 g per hectare, desirably from about 25 g to about 600 g per hectare, more desirably from about 50 g to about 500 g per hectare. For use in treating seeds, the typical rate of application is of from about 1 g to about 500 g per kilogram of seeds, desirably from about 2 g to about 300 g per kilogram of seeds, more desirably from about 10 g to about 200 g per kilogram of seeds. Customary application rates in the protection of materials are, for example, from about 0.001 g to about 2000 g, desirably from about 0.005 g to about 1000 g, of active compound per cubic meter of treated material.<br>
