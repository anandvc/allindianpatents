				<td>A DEVICE FAR REVERSE IONTOPHORESIS USING A CONSTANT DIRECT CURRENT POWER<br>
SUPPLIER AND OPTIMAL CONDITIONS TO DETERMINE OR PREDICT SOLELY THE HUMAN<br>
 BLOOD UREA LEVEL FROM PRE DETERMINED CONTACT AREA   	<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This Invention relates to a method for measuring urea level in human blood by<br>
reverse iontophoresis and a device -urea meter- using the method and in<br>
particular, the amount of urea level is determined bv the changes of oH of the<br>
urease containing, solution so as to predict the blood urea level.<br>
Measurement and determination of urea level is particularly important for<br>
patients with insufficient kidney function, neonates, pregnant women, or for the<br>
epidemiological screening.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Various attempts have been observed for measuring and determining urea level<br>
In human blood, including biological-based methods and sampling of human<br>
blood.<br>
These conventionally utilized methods offer some reasonable outcomes in the<br>
sense of determining urea level in human blood. However, as it is<br>
acknowledged by a person skilled in the art, these practices accompany with<br>
some disadvantages comprising microbiological contamination embolism as<br>
well as causing paln to the patient, since these exercised methods are<br>
associated with t aking b iologic o r blood s amples and s ubsequintly a nalyzing<br>
these samples so as to determine the urea level in the blood.<br>
The risks involved are not limited with the present practices as set forth above,<br>
since taking blood samples is particularly important for patients! with diabetes,<br>
hemophilia or some coagulation disorders and more particularly the<br>
hemophiliacs.<br><br>
Further disadvantages with the present practices apply for neonates and infants<br>
with regard to the risk of infection and the difficulty for performing such taking<br>
blood samples from the neonates and infants.<br>
As for epidemiological screening for uremia, there exists possibility of mixing up<br>
the samples/injectors and thus lead to a greater infectious contamination.<br>
Yet another disadvantage with the existing practices is obvious for pregnant<br>
women, since taking blood thereof also poses additional discomfort and<br>
difficulty.<br>
Patients with uremia are influenced both emotionally and physically due to<br>
giving blood samples frequently for undergoing subsequent dialysis.<br>
Proposed invention relates to reverse iontophoresis. Such a method has been<br>
in use for example in WO 03000340 disclosing a method for non-invasively<br>
determining the relative levels of two substances present in a biological system<br>
includes the steps of extracting by reverse iontophoresis charged and<br>
uncharged substances from said biological system.<br>
WO 03000340 solely discloses the use of reverse iontophoresis for a biological<br>
system and does not teach or suggest any method for measuring and<br>
determining the urea level in human blood.<br>
WO 03010538 discloses a method and a device for increasing reverse<br>
iontophoresis flux so that non-invasive extraction of uncharged and charged<br>
permanent molecules alike through the skin.<br>
Therefore WO 03010538 does not suggest a solution for measuring and<br>
determining urea level in human blood.<br><br>
Iontophoresis usage is known from various applications as in attached<br>
reference list, to pass some compounds through the human skin or to enhance<br>
the permeability. Reverse iontophoresis, however, is utilized for taking glucose<br>
from the blood to measure the blood glucose level.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the present invention is to measure and determine urea level in<br>
human blood securely and without involving any contamination risk.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to measure and determine urea level<br>
in human blood painlessly.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to monitor of urea level in human<br>
blood.<br>
With this proposed invention, the urea level can be obtained in a very short<br>
period of time without taking blood or any other biological samples from the<br>
patient.<br>
In iontophoresis procedure, by using an electrical current (producing an<br>
electrical gradient), the ions (molecules or atoms having a net charge or<br>
partially charged) can be carried to the other side of the membrane according to<br>
applied current and electrical charge and it is possible to control by<br>
iontophoresis. Electrodes or similar tools are provided to the both side of the<br>
membrane and the applied electrical current or potential (direct or alternative<br>
current, square, sinus or triangular or even different frequencies and/or<br>
currencies) can be applied as needed.<br>
The ions in the solution migrate according to their charges and their movement<br>
is in proportional to the current. For instance, positively charged ions migrate to<br>
the negative electrode side and vice versa. While the charged ions are<br><br>
migrating according to the electrical current, they also drag the uncharged<br>
molecules along with themselves. At this instance, traveling from one side to the<br>
other side of the membrane creates a flow, a turbulence occurs (this is so called<br>
an electro-osmotic flow). Therefore the unchanged particles (atoms/molecules)<br>
can also be able to pass through the membrane by being pulled into this vortex<br>
or into the motion and, this passage occurs at a much faster rate than that of<br>
passive diffusion.<br>
When the molecular structure of urea investigated as in Figure-1, although it is<br>
known to behave as not charged molecules, it is seen that some local charges<br>
are present on the molecule. According to the experiments conducted, the<br>
higher urea transportation was observed than passive diffusion when urea was<br>
present at the positive electrode side because of the positive local charges on<br>
the molecule as in Figure-2. There is also a possibility that the electro-osmotic<br>
flow was partially influential for this transfer. However, during the transfer, if the<br>
other small but charged ions like potassium and sodium are present in the<br>
solution, the transfer rate decreases; but still the transfer is much larger and<br>
faster than the passive diffusion.<br>
These experiments were repeated using human skin (7) as the membrane, and<br>
similar results were obtained. So, since the urea molecules are partially charged<br>
with + load the reverse- iontophoresis' can be applied. For this, an anode, (+)<br>
electrode (6), can be placed right on the skin (7) surface in the forearm, and<br>
near this place, a cathode (4), (-) electrode, is inserted into a container (3)<br>
which contains an isotonic saline solution (5). When the electrical current is<br>
applied by a power supplier (1), the urea molecules will migrate from blood to<br>
the container (3) on the outside (Figure-3). This will be in direct proportion to the<br>
current and area used.<br>
In experiments conducted, 10 ml isotonic saline solution has been placed into<br>
the container (3). The area of the container is 12.5 cm2. The current is supplied<br>
with a 1000 uA, measured by an ampere-meter (2), level and applied for 5<br><br>
minutes. After the current is terminated the values in the solution are measured.<br>
These experiments have been conducted on volunteers as it is explained above<br>
with the reverse iontophoresis procedure and the solution (5) in the container<br>
(3) in which urea is accumulated is taken and the amount of urea in this solution<br>
is determined.<br>
The levels of urea in this solution were analyzed in biochemistry laboratory<br>
using urease method. In the process of this analysis, after adding a reactive<br>
agent, the ultraviolet absorbency at 305 nm is measured. The measured<br>
absorbency values placed into the calibration equation and the urea levels have<br>
been measured in 'mg/dl' terms. When the blood urea levels and the results<br>
obtained by reverse iontophoresis procedure are compared, (when all else like<br>
current, surface and time period held constant), it has been observed that there<br>
has been a definite relationship in between the two methods (Figure-4).<br>
In this proposed system, the amount of urea drawn into the solution (5) is<br>
measured-calculated according to the change of pH induced by the urease.<br>
Urease is an enzyme specific to urea. When it comes across with urea, NH3 is<br>
produced, and it raises the pH value of the solution. This is directly related with<br>
the amount of urea. One ml of 1% urease in the isotonic saline solution is added<br>
into the 5 ml of solution obtained form the reverse iontophoresis procedure<br>
(which contains urea drawn through the patient's skin). After 10 minutes, the<br>
mixture-new solution's pH is measured. The relationship between the patient's<br>
blood urea level and the pH values obtained in our experiment is shown in<br>
Figure-5. In the experiments, the composition of the electrodes is Ag for the<br>
anode and AgCI for the cathode. These electrodes do not cause any pH level<br>
change, but other electrodes can also be used such as cupper, wanadium,<br>
steel, gold etc.<br>
Alternatively, determination of urea level in solution is performed by measuring<br>
thereof through using spectrophotometric methods or by determining the<br><br>
change in the electrical properties of the skin in replace of the above-mentioned<br>
determination of change in pH.<br>
The method in the scope of the present invention is performed by practicing on<br>
a device i.e. an arm watch-like device or might be called as a urea-meter. The<br>
urea watch comprises a (+) electrode (6); and a solution (5) containing NaCI<br>
and urease in the inside of the watch casing-container (3) being in touch with<br>
the skin surface (7). The watch further comprises a dialysis membrane which<br>
protects from any leakage of the solution and provides the transfer of urea<br>
through (this membrane can be a hemodialysis membrane). There is also a (-)<br>
electrode (4) at the other side of the skin (7) which can be mounted at the strap<br>
of the watch, the pH measurement and the batteries must be present to provide<br>
a current.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the possibility of using a gel comprising a<br>
collection medium instead of solution mentioned above can be utilized. There is<br>
also a microcomputer/microprocessor and the software for the measurement of<br>
the urea level in blood and the pre-calibrated pH values and can be indicated<br>
the urea level in blood.<br>
