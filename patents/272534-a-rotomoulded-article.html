				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to use of a particular polypropylene composition in rotomoulding, to rotomoulding processes using the composition and to the rotomoulded articles that result More specifically the invention concerns use of a polymer composition for rotomoulding that comprises at least two polypropylene components and at least one nucleating agent<br>
Rotational moulding (or rotomoulding) is a moulding process in which a particulate polymer, the moulding powder, is filled into a mould which is placed into an oven and rotated so that the polymer melts and coats the inside of the surface of the mould. In order to ensure that the moulded product is defect free it is necessary to form a homogeneous melt. A key step in rotomoulding is therefore sintering of the moulding powder. This is characterised by the occurrence of coalescence of the moulding powder and the production of a porous three dimensional network. Other steps that occur in the mould are densification, bubble removal and surface levelling. After cooling, the moulded product is simply removed from the mould.<br>
A wide variety of articles 'may be prepared by rotomoulding but the, technique is particularly useful for the production of large objects. Examples of articles that may be made by rotomoulding include containers (e.g. boxes, drums, tanks, tubs), furniture, sports and leisure equipment, toys and garden equipment Use of rotomoulding for the production of interior parts, e.g. washing machine or dishwater parts or automotive parts is also common.<br>
Articles made by rotomoulding typically have well defined shapes and it is important that the eventual rotomoulded product has the dimensions that the mould is intended to produce. This is critical, for example, when the rotomoulded article is designed to fit or interact with another article or a specific environment. Rotomoulded products should therefore display minimum warpage.<br>
A variety of polymers have been rotomoulded although homopolymer and copolymers of ethylene are most commonly used. Borecene® is, for example, a commercially available rotomoulding polyethylene which is available from Borealis AS.<br>
Whilst polyethylenes can successfully be used for rotomoulding of a wide variety of articles, there has been a growing interest in rotomoulding of polypropylene. Propylene polymers have excellent thermo-mechanical properties such as high stiffness and high temperature stability and therefore have the potential to expand the range of products that can be made by rotomoulding. WO03/091295, for example, describes rotomoulding of metallocene-produced syndiotactic polypropylene or an isotactic random copolymer of propylene and WO02/070602 describes rotomoulding of propylene compositions, preferably comprising syndiotactic and isotactic polypropylene.<br>
However, rotomoulding of polypropylene is not straightforward. Polypropylene is intrinsically brittle, which is additionally aggravated by the slow crystallisation that occurs during rotomoulding and results in a coarse spherulitic structure. In some types of moulding, nucleating agents can be employed to reduce the spherullite size. However, the finer microstructure of nucleated propylene polymers is generally associated with a higher degree of crystallmity, which in rotomoulding is expected to result in increased warpage.<br>
Warpage is a problem that commonly occurs in rotomoulding due to the asymmetrical cooling that occurs. The outer wall of the article is in contact with the mould and is therefore cooled faster than the inner wall, where the heat loss is almost negligible. This creates a solidification front moving from the outer wall towards the inner wall and thus the volume contraction due to crystallisation induces asymmetrical residual stresses and warpage in the final product The greater the crystallmity of the polymer, the greater the volume contraction due to crystallisation, and hence asymmetrical residual stress and warpage are also increased.<br>
There still remains a need therefore for a polypropylene composition for rotomoulding which yields articles having good stiffness as well as low warpage and dimensional stability. To date, no polypropylene-based composition has been rotomoulded that provides articles having an attractive balance of all of these properties. However, it has now surprisingly been found that rotomoulded articles having a desirable combination or balance of these properties may be provided by rotomoulding a polymer composition comprising at least two polypropylene components and a nucleating agent.<br>
Thus viewed from a first aspect the invention provides use of a polymer composition for rotomoulding, wherein said composition comprises: (i)       at least two propylene polymer components; and (ii)      a nucleating agent.<br>
Viewed from a further aspect the invention provides a process for the preparation of an article comprising rotomoulding a polymer composition as hereinbefore defined.<br>
Viewed from a still further aspect the invention provides a rotomoulded article comprising a polymer composition as hereinbefore defined.<br>
Viewed from yet another aspect the invention provides a polymer composition for rotomoulding comprising: (i)       at least two propylene polymer components; and (ii)      a nucleating agent,<br>
wherein said composition is in the form of powder or pellets (preferably pellets) having an average size of 100 to 650 microns.<br>
The propylene polymer components present in the compositions used in the present invention preferably comprise at least 50 %, more preferably at least 70 %, still more preferably at least 90 %, e.g. at least 95 or 99 %, by weight of repeat units deriving from propylene. Preferred propylene polymer components are non-heterophasic.<br>
The polypropylene present in the compositions used in the present invention comprise two or more (e.g. three or four) propylene polymer components. Preferably, however, the polypropylene comprises two propylene polymer components.<br>
The propylene polymer components present in the compositions used in the present invention preferably have different structures in the polymer chains, e.g. the components may have different tacticity and/or different comonomer content. The tacticity of polypropylene can be determined by methods well known in the art, e.g. as described in Die Makromolekulare Chemie, 1965, 85, 34-45 or in the Journal of Applied Polymer Science, 2002, 85, 734-745.<br>
Particularly preferred compositions for use in the invention comprise at least two propylene polymer components having different crystallisation temperatures<br>
 (Tc). Still more preferably the compositions comprise at least two propylene polymer components having a difference of at least 5 °C in their Tcs, more preferably at least a difference of 10 °C in their Tcs, e.g. 5-30 °C difference in their Tcs, still more preferably a 10-25 °C difference in their Tcs. By the phrase "different crystallisation temperatures" is meant herein that the polymers per se (i.e. prior to addition of any nucleating agent) have different Tcs.<br>
The propylene polymer components present in the compositions used in the invention preferably have different comonomer contents. In other words, in preferred compositions, the propylene polymer is multimodal (e.g. bimodal or trimodal) in terms of comonomer distribution. As used herein, the term multimodal means that the polymer comprises of two or more components each having a different comonomer and/or comonomer content (wt%). Correspondingly the term bimodal refers to polymers having two different components each having a different comonomer and/or comonomer content (wt%). The term trimodal refers to polymers having three different components each having a different comonomer and/or comonomer content (wt%). In particularly preferred compositions, the polypropylene is bimodal.<br>
The propylene polymer components may all be propylene copolymers or all be propylene homopolymers. Preferably, however, the propylene polymer components comprise a propylene homopolymer and one or more propylene copolymers.<br>
Particularly preferably the polypropylene present in compositions for use in the present invention comprise at least 20 wt%, more preferably at least 30 wt%, still more preferably at least 40 wt% of each propylene component (e.g. homopolymer and copolymer) based on the total weight of the composition.'<br>
As used herein the term propylene homopolymer is intended to encompass polymers which consist essentially of repeat units deriving from propylene: Homopolymers may, for example, comprise at least 90 %, more preferably at least 95 %, still more preferably about 99 %, e.g. 100 % by weight of repeat units deriving from propylene.<br>
As used herein the term propylene copolymer is intended to encompass polymers comprising repeat units from propylene and at least one other monomer.<br>
In typical copolymers at least 1 %, preferably at least S %, e.g. at least 10 % by weight of repeat units derive from at least one monomer other than propylene.<br>
The propylene homopolymer component that may be present in the compositions of the present invention preferably has an MFR2 in the range 2 to 40 g/lOmin, more preferably 10 to 25 g/lOmin, e.g. about 20 g/lOmin. Preferably the homopolymer is isotactic.<br>
The propylene copolymer component that may be present in the compositions of the invention may be a block copolymer or a random copolymer, but is preferably a random copolymer. By a random copolymer is meant herein that the comonomer is distributed mainly randomly along the polymer chain. Preferred random copolymers are those made using Ziegler Natta catalysts.<br>
The propylene copolymer component comprises an a-olefin, e.g. a C2-18 α.-olefin other than propylene. Examples of suitable monomers include ethylene, but-1-ene, pent-1-enei hex-1-ene and oct-1-ene, especially ethylene. In preferred copolymers the only monomers present are propylene and ethylene. The total amount of a-olefin (e.g. ethylene) that is copolymerised with propylene may be 1-20 mol%, preferably 2.S to 10 mol%, e.g. 3.5 to 7 mol% based on the weight of the copolymer.<br>
When all of the components of polypropylene are copolymers, it is required mat the polymers be different. Thus when all of the components are copolymers, it is preferred the tl i amount of comonomer used in each component will be different, e.g. at least differing by 1 wt%, e.g. at least 2 wt%, preferably at least 3 wt%.<br>
The propylene copolymer component present in the compositions preferably has an MFR2 in the range 5 to 40 g/lOmin, more preferably 10 to 25 g/lOmin, e.g. about 23 g/lOmin.<br>
The polypropylene used in the present invention may be unimodal or multimodal (e.g. bimodal) in molecular weight distribution (MWD). Preferably the MWD is in the range 1.5 to 10, more preferably 2 to 7, still more preferably 3 to 5, e.g. about 2 to 4.<br>
The composition for use in the invention also comprises a nucleating agent. More preferably the composition for use in the invention comprises at least two (e.g. two) different nucleating agents.<br><br>

K., known as NA-11), and cyclic bis-phenol phosphates (such as NA-21, also available from Asahi Denka)), metal salts (such as calcium) of hexahydrophthalic acid, and the unsaturated compound of disodium bicyclo [2.2.1] heptene dicarboxylate, known as HPN-68 available from Milliken<br>
Commercially available products preferred for use in the practice of the present invention include Millad 3988 (3,4-dimethyldibenzylidene sorbitol) available from Milliken, NA-11; (sodium 2,2-methylene-bis- (4,6, di-tert-butylphenyl) phosphate, available from Asahi Denka Kogyo, and NA-21 (aluminum bis [2,2'-methylene-bis- (4,6-di-tert-butylphenyl) phosphate]),from Asahi Denka Kogyo.<br>
More preferably, however, the composition used in the present invention is nucleated with a polymeric nucleating agent, e.g. a polymer derived from vinyl cycloalkanes and/or vinyl alkanes. Still more preferably the composition is nucleated with a polymer containing vinyl compound units.<br>
A polymeric nucleating agent containing vinyl compound units may be a homopolymer of a vinyl compound or a copolymer of different vinyl compounds Preferably the polymeric nucleating agent is a homopolymer of a vinyl compound.<br>
Preferred polymeric nucleating agents present in the compositions of the present invention comprise vinyl compound units deriving from a vinyl compound of formula (I):<br>
a<br>
wherein R and R , together with the carbon atom they are attached to, form an optionally substituted, fused ring system or saturated, unsaturated or aromatic ring, wherein said ring system or ring comprises 4 to 20 carbon atoms (e.g. 5 to 12 carbon atoms) or R1 and R2 independently represent a linear or branched C4-30 alkane, a C4-20 cycloalkane or a C4-20 aromatic ring.<br>
Preferably R1 and R2, together with the carbon atom they are attached to, form an optionally substituted, optionally C1-2 bridged, 5 or 6 membered saturated, unsaturated or aromatic ring or R1and R2 independently represent a C1-4 alkyl group.<br>
In further preferred compounds of formula (I), R1 and R2, together with the carbon atom they are attached to, form a 6 membered ring. Still more preferably R1 and R2, together with the carbon atom they are attached to, form a non-aromatic ring (i.e. a vinyl cycloalkane).   In particularly preferred compounds the ring formed by R and R , together with the carbon atom they are attached to, is unsubstituted.<br>
Representative examples of vinyl compounds which may be present in the polymeric nucleating agent include vinyl cyclohexane, vinyl cyclopentane, vinyls-methyl cyclohexane, 3-methyl-l-pentene, 4-methyl-l-pentene, 3-methyl-l-butene, 3-ethyl-l -hexene or a mixture thereof. Vinyl cyclohexane is a particularly preferred vinyl compound.<br>
In particularly preferred compositions for use in the present invention a propylene homopolymer is nucleated with a polymeric nucleating agent as hereinbefore defined. Still more preferably the compositions for use in the invention further comprises a propylene copolymer nucleated with a polymeric nucleating agent or a non-polymeric nucleating agent (e.g. a non-polymeric nucleating agent).<br>
Non-polymeric nucleating agents may be added to the compositions for use in the invention in an amount from about 0.01 percent to about 10 percent by weight based on the weight of the total composition.   In most applications, however, less than about 3.0 percent by weight (based on weight of total composition) are required. In some applications, such compounds may be added in amounts from<br>
about 0.05 to about 0.3 % (based on weight of total composition) to provide beneficial characteristics.<br>
Polymeric nucleating agents may be present in the compositions used in the present invention in amounts of greater than 0.1 ppm, e.g. from about 0.1 to 1000 ppm based on the weight of the total composition. More preferably polymeric nucleating agents may be added to the compositions in amounts (based on total weight of the composition) of greater than 0.5 ppm, still more preferably in amounts of 1 to 500 ppm especially preferably 2 to 100 ppm, e.g. 3 to 50 ppm.<br>
One effect of adding a nucleating agent to the compositions used in the invention may be to increase the Tc of a propylene polymer component In compositions wherein one propylene component is nucleated, it is preferred mat the Tc of a nucleated propylene polymer component and the Tc of a non-nucleated polymer component are different (e.g. by at least 3 °C, more preferably at least 5 °C, still more preferably at least 10 °C). Preferably the Tcs of the components are different by 5-30 °C, more preferably 10-25 °C. In compositions wherein at least two propylene polymer components are nucleated, it is preferred that the Tcs of the nucleated components are different. Still more preferably the nucleated propylene polymer components have Tcs that differ by at least 3 °C, more preferably at least 5 °C, still more preferably at least i0 °C, e.g. 5-30 °C or 10-25 °C.<br>
The polypropylene present in the compositions used in the invention may be prepared by simple blending (e.g. melt blending, preferably extrusion blending), by two or more stage polymerisation or by the use of two or more different polymerisation catalysts in a one stage polymerisation. Blending may, for example, be carried out in a conventional blending apparatus (e.g. an extruder). Propylene homopolymers and copolymers (e.g. random copolymers) that may be used in this invention are commercially available from various suppliers, e.g. Borealis A/S.<br>
Alternatively the polypropylene may be produced in a multi-stage polymerisation using the same catalyst, e.g. a metallocene catalyst or preferably a Ziegler-Natta catalyst. In a preferred multi-stage polymerisation a bulk polymerisation, e.g. in a loop reactor, is followed by a gas phase polymerisation in a gas phase reactor.   A preferred bulk polymerisation is a slurry polymerisation. Conventional cocatalysts, supports/carriers, electron donors etc. can be used.<br>
A loop reactor - gas phase reactor system is described in EP-A-0887379 and W092/12182, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference, and is marketed by Borealis A/S, Denmark as a BORSTAR reactor system. The propylene polymer used in the invention is thus preferably formed in a two stage process comprising a first bulk (e.g. slurry) loop polymerisation followed by gas phase polymerisation in the presence of a Ziegler-Natta catalyst.<br>
With respect to the above-mentioned preferred bulk (e.g. slurry)-gas phase process, the following general information can be provided with respect to the process conditions.<br>
A temperature of from 40°C to 110°C, preferably between 60°C and 100°C, in particular between 80°C and 90°C is preferably used in the bulk phase. The pressure in the bulk phase is preferably in the range of from 20 to 80 bar, preferably 30 to 60 bar, with the option of adding hydrogen in order to control the molecular weight being available. The reaction product of the bulk polymerization, which preferably is carried out in a loop reactor, is transferred to a subsequent gas phase reactor, wherein the temperature preferably is within the range of from 50°C to 130°C, more preferably 80°C to 100°C. The pressure in the gas phase reactor is preferably in the range of from 5 to SO bar, more preferably 15 to 35 bar, again with the option of adding hydrogen in order to control the molecular weight available.<br>
The residence time can vary in the reactor zones identified above. The residence time in the bulk reaction, for example the loop reactor, may be in the range of from 0.5 to 5 hours, for example 0.5 to 2 hours. The residence time in the gas phase reactor may be from 1 to 8 hours.<br>
The properties of the polypropylene produced with the above-outlined process may be adjusted and controlled with the process conditions as known to the skilled person, for example by one or more of the following process parameters: temperature, hydrogen feed, comonomer feed, propylene feed, catalyst, type and amount of external donor, split between two or more components of the polymer.<br>
Preferably, the first propylene polymer component of the polymer used in the invention is produced in a continuously operating loop reactor where propylene (and comonomer when required) is polymerised in the presence of a polymerisation catalyst (e.g. a Ziegler Natta catalyst) and a chain transfer agent such as hydrogen.<br>
The liquid phase may be the monomer itself or in addition it may contain a diluent. The diluent is typically an inert aliphatic hydrocarbon, preferably isobutane or propane.<br>
The second propylene polymer component can then be formed in a gas phase reactor using the same catalyst. Prepolymerisation can be employed as is well known in the art. Ziegler-Natta catalysts are preferred. The nature of the Ziegler-Natta catalyst is described in numerous prior publications, e.g. US 5234879.<br>
Nucleation of the propylene components for use in the invention may be carried out by conventional techniques, e.g. by blending. More preferably, however, when the nucleating agent is a polymer containing vinyl compound units, nucleated propylene polymers are made by modifying a polymerisation catalyst with vinyl compounds as hereinbefore described and using the modified catalyst for the polymerisation of propylene, optionally in the presence of comonomers. The catalyst systems and reaction conditions suitable for application in this latter method are described in WO99/24501. For instance, examples 1 and 2 described therein disclose a specific procedure which may be used to prepare a propylene polymer comprising a polymeric nucleating agent for use in the compositions of the present invention.<br>
The polymer compositions of the present invention may also contain any conventional additives (e.g. process, heat and light stabilisers, colorants, antistatic agents, antioxidants, carbon black, pigments, flame retardants, foaming agents, blowing agents etc). A filler may also be present (e.g. talc).<br>
The compositions of the present invention may further comprise an impact modifier. By "impact modifier" is meant any polymer that functions to increase the impact resistance of the polymer compositions. Any conventional impact modifier may be used (e.g. any elastomer or plastomer). For example the impact modifier may be one or more elastomeric copolymer of propylene and one or more olefin comonomer (e.g. EPR), a LLDPE, a LDPE, or a mixture thereof.<br>
The elastomeric copolymer of propylene and one or more olefin comonomer preferably comprises 20 to 90 %wt of olefin comonomer (e.g. ethylene or C4-8 ct-olefin). Suitable amounts of ethylene or C4.8 a-olefin in the elastomeric propylene<br>
components of which said composition is comprised. Particularly preferred compositions for use in the present invention have a warpage -36 + (0.039 x Tensile Modulus), still more preferred compositions have a warpage  
Further preferred compositions for use in the present invention have at least<br>
two (preferably all) of the following properties (i)-(iii) wherein the tensile modulus<br>
is determined on samples machinated from rotomoulded samples as described in the<br>
examples and warpage and HDT B is determined as described in the examples:<br>
i) Tensile Modulus (MPa): at least 1200, preferably at least 1300, e.g. at least 1400<br>
ii) Warpage (mm):     less than 15, preferably less than 10, e.g. less than 5<br>
iii) HDT B (°C):	at least 90 °C, preferably at least 100 °C, e.g. at least 105 °C<br>
Representative examples of articles that may be rotomoulded using the compositions of the present invention include automotive parts (e.g. fuel tanks, mud guards and air ducts), furniture (e.g. design furniture, garden furniture), garden equipment (e.g. fences), interior parts (e.g. washing machine, dishwasher parts, heater parts) and tanks (e.g. hot water tanks).<br>
The invention will now be further illustrated by the following non-limiting examples.<br>
Analytical Tests<br>
Values quoted in the description and examples are measured according to the following tests:<br>
i) MFR2 was measured in accordance with ISO 1133 at 230°C with a 2.16 kg load for polypropylene and at 190 °C with a 2.16 kg load for polyethylene.<br>
ii) Density was measured according to ISO 1183<br><br>

Particularly preferably the elastomeric copolymer of propylene and one or nore olefin comonomer is ethylene-propylene-diene (EPDM) or ethylene propylene nbber (EPR) (e.g. EPR). Suitable EPRs for use in the invention are commercially available. For example Dutral CO 058 from Polimeri Europa may be used as the impact modifier.<br>
LLDPE that may be present as an impact modifier is preferably a copolymer of ethylene and one or more olefin comonomers, (e.g. C3-8 a-olefin). Suitable amounts of C3-8 a-olefin in the copolymer are 3 to 50 %mol, more preferably 5 to 30 %mol, e.g. 7 to 20 %mol. Preferably the comonomer is propylene, butene or octene, e.g. octene.<br>

LDPE for use an impact modifier is commercially available from Borealis A/S under the tradename CA9150.<br>
Preferred impact modifiers present in the compositions used in the invention include EPR and/or LLDPE as hereinbefore described. A particularly preferred impact modifier is LLDPE.<br>
The polymer compositions may be prepared by any conventional methods known in the art, e.g. by mixing each of the components hereinbefore described. The composition may also be made by making the polypropylene components in a BORSTAR process as hereinbefore described and optionally compounding the resulting polymer with an impact modifier. If impact modifier is present, however, it is preferably introduced into the compositions used in the invention by carrying<br><br>
out a further polymerisation step in the presence of the propylene polymer • components. If this latter process is used a heterophasic polypropylene is produced. In this case, a further external impact modifier may optionally be added after polymerisation is complete.<br>
Heterophasic polypropylene may be prepared by any conventional procedure. For instance, the. polypropylene produced in accordance with the processes discussed above may be transferred into a further reactor, preferably a gas phase reactor, in order to polymerize an impact modifier (e.g EPR).<br>
This polymerization stage is preferably carried out as a gas-phase polymerization in one or more gas-phase reactors. It is particularly preferred that this polymerization stage is carried out in one gas-phase reactor to which the polypropylene is fed together with comonomers (e.g. ethylene and propene), and hydrogen as needed.<br>
The conditions for the polymerization are within the limits of conventional production conditions, e.g. for EPR as disclosed in Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Engineering, Second Edition, Vol. 6, pp. 545-558. The temperature for the polymerization of EPR is preferably 40 to 90°C, and more preferably 60 to 70°C. The pressure is preferably 500 to 3000 kPa, preferably 1000 to 2000 kPa. The process, e.g. comonomer content and MFR, may be controlled in a known manner.<br>
Preferred compositions for use in the invention comprise less than 20 %wt, preferably less than 10 %wt, still more preferably less than 5 %wt of impact modifier based on the total weight of the composition. Particularly preferred compositions do not contain any impact modifier. •<br>
The MFR2 of the polymer compositions used in the invention is preferably 1 to 40, more preferably 7 to 30 g/10 min, still more preferably 10 to 25 g/lOmin, e.g. about 15 to 20 g/lOmin. The molecular weight distribution of preferred compositions is in me range 1.5 to 10, more preferably 2 to 7, still more preferably 3 to 5, e.g. about 2 to 4.<br>
To ensure that the composition is in a suitable form for rotomoulding the products of any polymerisation reaction may be converted to powder form or pelletised. Pellets are preferred. The average particle size of the powder/pellets is<br>
preferably less than 1000 microns, preferably 100 to 650 microns, e.g. about 500-600 microns. Suitably sized powder/pellets may, for example, be prepared by grinding.<br>
Alternatively micropellets may be produced using the technique described in WO00/35646 wherein a polymer composition is extruded in melt form through a die and pelletised to give particles having a particular size distribution. The particles are then dried to very low levels of moisture to improve rotomouldability.<br>
The polymer compositions of the present invention have a number of advantageous properties that render them especially suitable for use in die manufacture of rotomoulded articles. Rotomoulding may be carried out according to standard conditions. The polymer powder is placed in a mould which is then transferred to an oven and rotated, preferably about two axes to distribute the polymer powder over the hot surfaces of the mould. The heating cycle is continued until all of the powder has melted and formed a continuous layer within the mould. The mould is then removed from the oven and cooled until the polymer has solidified. The moulded article is then removed.<br>
The length of time for which the mould must be heated depends on the nature of the article being moulded, the amount and nature of polymer composition present and the temperature of the oven. Typical rotomoulding oven temperatures are 230 to 400 °C, more particularly 260 to 320 °C (e.g. about 290 °C). Heating time is chosen such that the peak internal air temperature (PIAT) in the mould is 160 to 300 °C, more preferably 170 to 250 °C (e.g. about 240 °C). This temperature can be measured using a Rotolog* or similar equipment to monitor the temperature or it may be chosen based on previous experience. The oven may optionally be pressurised to reduce the amount of time in the mould. Typical pressures that may be used are less wan 4 bar, more preferably less than 1 bar (e.g. about 0.5 bar).<br>
Cooling may be carried out under a stream of air, water spray or mist or simply in ambient air at room temperature. A combination of these methods may also be employed. Preferably cooling is achieved using a combination of blown air followed by ambient air or just blown air. Cooling times are normally of similar magnitude to heating times or slightly longer. Slow cooling further reduces the amount of warpage in an article, but the compositions of this invention are much<br>
less prone to warpage that the polypropylene compositions in the prior art. The moulded article may be removed from the mould at any convenient time after solidification has occurred.<br>
The skilled man is able to manipulate the temperature, time and rotation speed/ratio within a rotomoulding apparatus to ensure that well-formed moulded articles are produced. Particularly preferred rotomoulding conditions are: oven temperature 230-350 °C (e.g. 290 °C), PIAT 170 to 250 °C (e.g. 240 °C), oven time 5 mins to 120 mins (e.g. about 15 mins), rotation ratio 0.1-20 rpm/0.1-20 rpm (e.g. 9rpm/1.4rpm).<br>
An advantage of using the polymer compositions hereinbefore described in rotomoulding is that the resulting rotomoulded articles have an excellent stifmess as well as surprisingly low warpages.<br>
Compositions for use in the present invention preferably have a tensile modulus that is greater than the tensile modulus calculated on a weight basis from the tensile moduli of each of the propylene polymer components of which said composition is comprised (wherein the tensile modulus is determined on samples machinated from rotomoulded samples as.described in the examples). Preferred compositions have a tensile modulus of at least 1200 MP a, more preferably at least 1300 MPa, still more preferably at least 1400 MPa, e.g. at least 1500 MPa.<br>
Compositions for use in the present invention preferably have a warpage that is less than the warpage calculated on a weight basis from the warpages of each of the propylene polymer components of which said composition is comprised (wherein warpage is determined as described in the examples). Particularly preferably the compositions have a warpage that is less than 50 %, still more preferably less than 20 % of the warpage calculated on a weight basis as described above. Preferred compositions have a warpage of less than 25 mm, more preferably less than 15 mm, still more preferably less than 10 mm, e.g. less than 5 mm.<br>
Still more preferably compositions for use in the present invention have a have a tensile modulus that is greater than the tensile modulus calculated on a weight basis from the tensile moduli of each of the propylene polymer components of which said composition is comprised and a warpage that is less than the warpage calculated on a weight basis from the warpages of each of the propylene polymer<br><br>
iii) The weight average molecular weight, Mw and the molecular weight distribution (MWD = Mw/Mn wherein Mn is the number average molecular weight) is measured by a method based on ISO 16014-4:2003. A waters 150CV plus instrument was used with column 3 x HT&amp;E styragel from Waters (divinylbenzene) and trichlorobenzene (TCB) as solvent at 140 °C. The column set was calibrated using universal calibration with narrow MWD PS standards (the Mark Howinks constant K: 9.54x10-5 and a: 0.725 for PS, and K: 3.92x104 and a: 0.725 for PE).<br>
iv) Comonomer content (weight percent) was determined in a known manner based on FTTR, calibrated with C13NMR<br>
v) Melting temperature (Tm), crystallization temperature (Tc) and degree of crystallinity (XC) were measure according to ISOl 1357. The samples were cut from compression molded, 0.2 mm films. The measurements were performed at the following conditions:<br>
Stage	Temperature	Heating/Cooling	Time<br>
