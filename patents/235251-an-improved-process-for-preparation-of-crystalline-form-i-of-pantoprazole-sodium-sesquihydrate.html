FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of crystalline Form-I of Pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate, chemically known as 5-(Difiuoromethoxy)2-[[(3,4-dimelhoxy-2-pyridinyl) methyl ] sulfinyl]-lH-benzimidazole sodium sesquihydrate.  The Pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate of the present invention can be depicted as Formula (1).<br><br>
Formula (1) BACK GROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate is a known Anti-ulcerative drug, gastric acid<br>
secretion inhibitor and has been used for the treatment of ulcer patients.<br>
USP 4,758,79 specifically claimed the Pantoprazole and its pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salts. The patent also described the process for the preparation of pantoprazole and its<br>
related compounds.<br>
The process for the preparation of pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate is not described<br>
specifically in '579 patent, but disclosed in the summary of the invention that "the salts<br>
are obtained by dissolving five base in a suitable solvent, for example in a suitable halo<br>
hydrocarbon solvent such as methylene chloride or chloroform or a low molecular weight<br>
aliphatic alcohol such as ethanol or iso propanol or a ketone like acetone or water, which<br>
contains the desired acid or base, or to which the desired acid or base is added (if<br><br>
necessary) in the precisely calculated stochiometric amount accompanied by filtering,<br>
evaporating the solvent yielded the corresponding salt of Pantoprazole.<br>
The process disclosed in the above '579 patent suffers from the draw back that more<br>
number of stages and high volume of solvents are involved in the salt preparation.<br>
J.Med.Chem. 35,1049-1057 (1992) described the process for the preparation of<br>
Pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate, which comprises the dissolution of pantoprazole<br>
freebase in a mixture of ethanol and dichloromethane followed by addition of<br>
stoichiometric amount of sodium hydroxide solution and further reaction wort: up<br>
resulted the Pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate with a melting point of 130 c.<br>
The process of said journal also suffers from the draw back ofusing mixture of solvents<br>
in a high volume, which in turn the desired product was not isolated, hence the volume of<br>
ethanol was reduced to isolate the product.<br>
The crystalline forms of Pantaprazole sodium sesquihydrate were not reported in any of<br>
the relevant references known in the art till date.<br>
The inventors of the present invention have prepared the crystalline form of pantoprazole<br>
sodium sesquihydrate according to the process disclosed in J.Med.ChenL 35, 1049-1057<br>
(1992) with less volume of ethanol and analyzed the crystalline structure by X-ray<br>
diffractogram and hereinafter it is referred as prior art crystallne Form-I of Pantoprazole<br>
sodium sesqui hydrate for convenience.<br>
Many attempts have been done to provide the novel crystalline form of Pantaprazole<br>
sodium sesquihydrate but in all the cases the crystalline structure of product is<br>
substantially similar to that of prior art crystalline Form-I of Pantoprazole sodium sesqui<br>
hydrate.<br><br>
Since polymorphic fonns of drug substances are known to differ in their physical<br>
properties such as melting point, solubility, chemical reactivity etc., they can appreciably<br>
influence the phannaceutical properties such as dissolution rate and bioavailability and<br>
pentaprazole sodium sesqui hydrate is being a known anti ulcerative drug, it is important<br>
to further evaluate the polymorphism to obtain newer polymorphs or to provide an<br>
altemate process in a cost-effective, non-hazardous and commercially viable for existing<br>
polymorphs.<br>
The main aspect of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the<br>
preparation of crystalline Form-I of Pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate.  The improved<br>
process of the present invention is simple, cost effective, non-hazardous and industrially<br>
scalable.<br>
The crystalline nature of the pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate of the present invention<br>
has been analyzed by XRD and found that the crystalline stmcture is identical to that of<br>
prior art crystalline Form-I of Pantoprazole sodiimi sesqui hydrate.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention is related to an improved process for the preparation of crystalline<br>
Form-I of Pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate.<br>
The process  for the  preparation  of crystalline  Form-I of Pantoprazole  sodium<br>
sesquihydrate comprises dissolution of Pantoprazole free base in which it substantially<br>
dissolves at an ambient temperature containing a stoichiometric quantity of sodium<br>
hydroxide, filtration of the clear solution and followed by addition of anti-solvent in<br>
which the product is insoluble to isolate the desired crystalline compound. The solvents<br>
for  dissolution  are  selected   from  C1-C4  straight  or  branched  chain  alcohols,<br><br>
tetrahydrofuran, ethyl acetate and the solvents for isolation are selected from a group of<br>
aliphatic or alicyclic hydrocarbon solvents, such as petroleum ether, hexane, n-heptane,<br>
cyclohexane,   cycloheptane  or  chlorinated   solvents   such   as  dichloromethane  or<br>
chloroform or ethereal solvents, such as diisopropyl ether or methyl-tertiary butyl ether.<br>
