				<td>POLYALKYLENE GLYCOL POLYMER COMPOUND AND USES THEREOF<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The  invention  relates  to  novel  polyalkylene  glycol  compounds,   conjugates  of the polymers and proteins, and uses thereof<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Covalent attachment of hydrophilic polymers, such as polyalkylene glycol polymers, also known as polyalkylene oxides, to biologically-active molecules and surfaces is of interest in biotechnology and medicine<br>
In particular, much research has focused on the use of poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG), also known as or poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO), conjugates to enhance solubility and stability and to prolong the blood circulation half-life of molecules<br>
In its most common form, PEG is a linear polymer terminated at each end with hydroxyl groups<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
The above polymer alpha- omega-dihydroxylpoly (ethylene glycol), can also be represented as HO-PEG-OH where it is understood that the-PEG-symbol represents the following structural unit<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
where n typically ranges from about 4 to about 10, 000   PEG is commonly used as<br>
methoxy- PEG-OH, or MPEG, in which one terminus is the relatively inert methoxy<br>
group, while the other terminus is a hydroxyl group that is subject to ready chemical<br>
modification<br>
Additionally, random or block copolymers of different alkylene oxides (e  g   , ethylene<br>
oxide and propylene oxide) that are closely related to PEG in their chemistry can be<br>
substituted for PEG in many of its applications<br>
To couple PEG to a molecule of interest, it is often necessary to activate the PEG by preparing a derivative of the PEG having a reactive functional group at least at one terminus The functional group is chosen based on the type of available reactive group on the molecule that will be coupled to the PEG<br>
PEG is a polymer having the properties of solubility in water and in many organic solvents, lack of toxicity, and lack of immunogenicity  One use of PEG is to covalently attach   the   polymer   to   insoluble   molecules   to   make   the   resulting   PEG-molecule conjugate" soluble<br>
For example, it has been shown that the water-insoluble drug paclitaxel, when coupled to PEG, becomes water-soluble. Greenwald, et a!, J Org Ckem., 60 331-336 (1995)i<br>
The prodrug approach, m which drugs are released by degradation of more complex molecules (prodrugs) under physiological conditions, is a powerful component of drug delivery. Prodrugs can, for example, be formed by bonding PEG to drugs via linkages which are degradable under physiological conditions  The lifetime of PEG prodrugs in vivo depends upon the type of functional group(s) forming linkages between PEG and the drug In general, ester linkages, formed by reaction of PEG carboxylic acids or activated PEG carboxyhc acids with alcohol groups on the drug hydrolyze under physiological conditions to release the drug, while amide and carbamaie linkages, formed from amine groups on the drug, are stable and do not hydrolyze to release the free drug  It has been shown that hydrolytic delivery of drugs from PEG estets can be favorably controlled to a certain extent by controlling the number of linking methylene groups in a spacer between the terminal PEG oxygen and the carbonyl group of the attached carboxyhc acid or carboxylic acid derivative  For example, Hams et ah, in U S. Patent No 5,672,662, describe PEG butanoic acid and PEG propanoic acid, and activated denvatives thereof, as alternate es to caiboxymethyl PEG for compounds where less hydrolytic reactivity in the corresponding ester derivatives is desirable   See, generally, PCT publication WO 01/46291<br>
One factor limiting the usefulness of proteinaceous substances for medical treatment applications is that, when given parenterally, they are eliminated from the body within a short time  This elimination can occur as a result of degradation by proteases or by clearance using normal pathways for protein elimination such as by filtration in the kidneys  Oral administration of these substances is even more problematic because, in addition to proteolysis m the stomach, the high acidity of the stomach destroys these substances before they reach their intended target tissue   The problems associated with these routes ot administration of proteins are well known in the pharmaceutical industry, and vanous strategies are being employed in attempts to solve them  A great deal of work dealing with protein stabilization has been published  Vanous ways of conjugating proteins with polymeric materials are known, including use of dextrans, polyvinyl pyrrohdones, glycopeptides, polyethylene glycol, and polyamino acids   The resulting conjugated polypeptides are reported to retain their biological activities and solubility in water for parenteral applications.<br>
Of particular interest is increasing the biological activity of interferons while reducing the toxicity involved with use of these proteins for treating human patients  Interferons are a family of naturally-occurring small proteins and glycoproteins produced and secreted by most<br>
nucleated cells in response to wral infection as well as to other antigenic stimuli. Interferons render cells resistant to viral infection and exhibit a wide variety of actions on cells  They exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface Once bound to the cell membrane, interferons initiate a complex sequence of intracellular events. In vitro studies have demonstrated that these include the induction of certain enzymes; suppression of cell proliferation, immunomodulation activities such as enhancement of the phagocytic activity of macrophages; augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of lymphocytes for target cells; and inhibition of virus replication in virus-infected cells<br>
Interferons have been tested in the treatment of a variety of clinical disease states  The use of human interferon beta has been established in the treatment of multiple sclerosis  Two forms of recombinant interferon beta, have recently been licensed m Europe and the U S for treatment of this disease interferon-beta-la (AVONEX ®, Biogen, Inc , Cambridge, MA and REBIF * Serono, Geneva, Switzerland) and interferon-beta-lb (BETASERON*, Berlex, Richmond. CA). Interferon beta-la is produced in mammalian cells using the natural human gene sequence and is glycosylated, whereas interferon beta-lb is produced in E coli bacteria using a modified human gene sequence that contains a genetically engineered cysteine-to-serine substitution at ammo acid position 17 and is non-giycosylated.<br>
Non-immune interferons, which include both alpha and beta interferons, are known to suppress human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) m both acutely and chronically-infected ceils. See Poli and Fauci. 1992, AIDS Research and Human Retroviruses 8(2). 191-197. Due to their antmral activity, interferons, in particular alpha interferons, have received considerable attention as therapeutic agents in the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCWrelated disease  See Hoofnagle ctal, in. Viral Hepatitis 1981 International Symposium, 1982, Philadelphia, Franklin Institute Press, Hoofnagle et al., 1986, New hng. J Med 315.1575-1578, Thomson, 1987, Lancet L539-541 Kiyosawa et al, 1983. nr Zuckerman, ed , Viral Hepatitis and Liver Disease, Allen K. Liss, New York pp 895-897, Hoofnagle etal., 1985, Sem LivDis,1985, 9 259-263<br>
Interferon-polymer conjugates are described m. for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,766,106, US Pat No 4,917,888, European Patent Application No. 0 236 987, European Patent Application No. 0 510 356 and International Application Publication No WO 95/13090<br>
Chronic hepatitis C is an insidious and slowly progressive disease having a significant impact on the quality ot life  Despite improvement in the quality of the blood-donor pool and the recent implementation of testmg of donated blood for HCV, the estimated incidence of acute infection among persons receiving transfusions is 5 to 10%  See Alter ct al, m"<br>
Zuckerman, ed,, Viral Hepatitis and Liver Disease, Allen K  Liss, New York. 1088, pp  537-542. Thus, of the approximately 3 million persons who receive transfusions, m the United States each year, acute hepatitis C will develop m about 150.000. While many patients who contract hepabtis C will have subclinical or mild disease, approximately 50% will progress to a chrome disease state characterized by fluctuating scrum transaminase abnormalities and inflammatory lesions on liver biopsy It is estimated that cirrhosis will develop in up to about 20% of this group. See Koretz et al, 1985, Gastroenterology 88 1251-1254<br>
Interferons are known to affect a variety of cellular functions, including DNA replication, and RNA and protein synthesis, in both normal and abnormal cells  Thus, cytotoxic effects of interferon are not restricted to tumor or virus-mfectod cells but are also manifested in normal, healthy cells As a result, undesirable side effects may arise during mterferon therapy, particularly v\hen high doses are required   Administration of interferon can lead to myelosuppression, thereby resulting in reduced ted blood cell count, and reduced white blood cell and platelet levels. Interferons commonly give rise to flu-like symptoms (eg, fever, fatigue, headaches and chills), gastrointestinal disorders (e g, anorexia, nausea and diarrhea), dizziness and coughing. Often, the sustained response of HCV patients to non-PEGylated interferon treatment is low and the treatment can induce severe side effects, including, but not limited to, retinopathy, thyroiditis, acute pancreatitis, and depression<br>
The undesirable side effects that accompany mterferon therapy frequently limit the therapeutic usefulness of mterferon treatment regimes. Thus, a need exists to maintain or improve me therapeutic benefits of such therapy while reducing or eliminating the undesirable side effects.<br>

The terms "functional group", "active moiety"', "active group", "activating group", "activating moiety", "reactive site", "chemically-reactive group" and' chemically-reactive moiety" are used in the art and herein to refer to distinct, definable portions or units of a molecule   Die terms are somewhat synonymous in the chemical arts and are used herein to indicate the portions of molecules having a characteristic chemical activity dnd which are typically reactive with other molecules. The term "active," when used in conjunction with functional groups, is intended to include those functionai groups that react readily with electrophihc or nucleophihc groups on other molecules, in contrast to those groups that require strong catalysts or highly impractical reaction conditions m order to react  For example, as would be understood in the art, the term "active ester" would include those esters that react readily with nucleophihc groups such as amines. Typically, an active ester will react with an amine m aqueous medium in a matter of minutes, whereas certain esters, such as methyl or ethyl esters, require a strong catalyst in order to react with a nucleophihc group.<br>
In the compounds of the invention as defined above, the functional group R becomes a linking moiety, R*, after it has reacted with a biologically-active molecule to form a linkage or bond between the activated polyalkylcnc glycol compound (PGC) and the biologically-active compound  Thus, B is a biologically-active compound after conjugation to the PGC and R* is a moiety formed by the reaction of R on the activated PGC with one or more reactive functionai groups on the biologically-active compound, B, such (hat a single covalcnt<br>
attachment results between the PGC and biologically-active compound  In a preferred embodiment, RMs a moiety formed by the reaction of R on the activated PGC with a single reactive functional group on the biologically-active compound, such that a covalent attachment results between the activated polyalkylene glycol compound (PGC) and the biologically-active compound<br>
The biologically-active compound or precursor thereof (B) is preferably not adversely affected by the presence of the PGC  Additionally, B either naturally has a functional group which is able to react with and form a linkage with ihe activated PGC, or is modified tu contain such a reactive group<br>
As used herein, a precursor of B is an inactive or less active form of B that changes to the active or more active form, respectively, upon contact vvith physiological conditions, e.g., administration to a subject Such changes can be conformational or structural changes, including, but not limited to, changing from a protected form to a non-protected form of B. As used herein, such change does not include release of the conjugated PGCs ot this invention.<br>
As would be understood in the art. the term 'protected' refers to the presence of a protecting group or moiety that prevents reaction oi the chemically-reactive functional group under certain leaction conditions. The protecting gioup will vary depending on the type of chemically-reactive group being protected For example, if the chemically-reactive group is an amine or a hydrazide, the protecting group can be selected from the group of tert-butyloxycarbonyl (t-Boc) and 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc). If the chemically-reactive group is a thiol, the protecting group can be orthopyndyldisulfide. If the chemically-reactive group is a carboxylic acid, such as butenoic or propionic acid, or a hydroxyl group, the protecting group can be benzyl or an alkyl group such as methyl or ethyl  Odier protecting groups known in the art may also be used in the invention<br>
The terms "linking moiety"', "linkage" or "linker" are used herein to refer to moieties or bonds that are formed as the result of a chemical reaction and typically are covalent linkages. Thus, the linkage represented by bond R*-B m the above formulae results from the reaction between an activated moiety, R, on the PGC with a biologically-active compound, i.e, B'. R* is the linking moiety formed from R upon reaction with B', and B is the biologically-active compound as conjugated to the PGC by reaction of a functional group on B" with R.<br>
As used herein, the term "biologically-active compound" refers to those compounds that exhibit one or more biological responses or actions when administered to a subject and contain teactive groups that contain reactive moieties that are capable of reacting with and conjugating to at least one activated PGC of the invention   fhe term "biologically-active<br>
molecule", "biologically-active moiety" or "biologically-active agent" when used herein means any substance which can affect any physical or biochemical properties of any subject, including but not limited to viruses, bactena, fungi', plants, animals, and humans In particular, as used herein, biologically-active molecules include any substance intended for diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in humans or other animals, or to otherwise enhance physical or mental well-being of humans or animals.<br>
Examples of biologically-active molecules include, but are not limited to, peptides, peptide analogs, proteins, enzymes, small molecules, dyes, lipids, nucleosides, oligonucleotides, analogs of oligonucleotides, sugars, oligosaccharides, cells, viruses, liposomes, microparticles, surfaces and micelles.<br>
Classes of biologically-active agents that are suitable for use with the invention include, but are not limited to, chemokincs, lymphokmes, antibodies, soluble receptors, anti-tumor agents, anti-anxiety agents, hormones, growth factors, antibiotics, fungicides, fungistatic agents, anti-viral agents, steroidal agents, antimicrobial agents, germicidal agents, antipyretic agents, antidiabetic agents, bnmchodilators, antidiarrheal agents, coronary dilation agents, glycosides, spasmolytics, antihypertensive agents, antidepressants, antianxiety agents, other psychotherapeutic agents, corticosteroids, analgesics, contraceptives, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, blood glucose lowering agents, cholesterol lowering agents, anticonvulsant agents, other anliepileptic agents, immunomodulators, anticholinergics, sympatholytics, sympathomimetics, vasodilatory agents, anticoagulants, antiarrhythmics, prostaglandins having various pharmacologic activities, diuretics, sleep aids, anahistammic agents, antmeoplastic agents, oncolytic agents, antiandrogens, antimalarial agents, antileprosy agents, and various other types of drugs. See Goodman and Oilman's The Basis of Therapeutics (Ninth Edition, Pergamon Press, Inc, USA, 1996) and The Merck Index (Thirteenth Edition, Merck &amp; Co, Inc., USA, 2001), each of which is incorporated herein by reference<br>
Biologically-active compounds include any compound that exhibits a biological response m its present form, or any compound that exhibits a biological response as a result of a chemKal conversion of its structure from its present form. For example, biologically-active compounds will include any compound that contains a protective group that, when cleaved, results in a compound that exhibits a biological response  Such cleavage can be the result, for example, of an in vivo reaction of the compound with endogenous enzymes or a pre-admmislratjon reaction of the compound, including its reaction with the activated PGCs of this invention  As a further example, biologically-active compounds will also include any<br>
compound which undergoes a stereotransformation, in vivo or ex vivo, to form a compound that exhibits a biological response or action.<br>
Biologically-active compounds typically contain several reactive sites at which covalent attachment of the activated PGC is feasible. For example, amine groups can undergo acylatrons, sulfhydryl groups can undergo addition reactions and alkylations, carbonyl and carboxyl groups can undergo acylations, and aldehyde and hydroxyl groups can undergo animation and reductive animation. One or more of these reactions can be used in the preparation of the polyalkylene glycol-modified biologically-active compounds of the invention. In addition, biologically-active compounds can be modified to form reactive moieties on the compound that facilitate such reactions and the resultant conjugation to the activated PGC<br>
Those of ordinary skill will recognize numerous reaction mechanisms available to facilitate conjugation of the activated PGC to a biologically-active compound. For example, when the activating moiety, R, is a hydrazide group, it can be covalendy coupled to sulfhydryl, sugar, and carbonyl moieties on the biologically-active compounds (after these moieties undergo oxidation to produce aldehydes). The reaction of hydrazide activating moieties (R) with aldehydes on biologically-active compounds (B') creates a hydrazone linkage (R*-B). When R is a malerrnide group, it can be reacted with a sulfhydryl group to form a stable thioether linkage. If sulfhydryls are not present on the biologically-activc compound, they may be created through disulfide reduction or through thiolation with 2-iminothiolane or SATA. When R is an imidoester it will react with primary amines on B" to form an imidoamide linkage. Imidoester conjugation is usually performed between pH 8.5-9.0. When connecting the activated PGCs to biologically-activc protems, lmidoesters provide an advantage over other R groups since they do not affect the overall charge of the protein They carry a positive charge at physiological pH, as do the primary amines they replace. Imidoester reactions are carried out between 0 °C and room temperature (e.g., at 4 °C), or at elevated temperatures under anhydrous conditions  When R is an NHS-ester, its principal target is primary amines Accessible c-amine groups, for example those present on the jV-termini of peptides and proteins, react with NHS-esters to form a covalent amide bond<br>
In some embodiments, R*-B is a hydrolytically-stable linkage. A hydroiytically stable linkage means that the linkage is substantially stable in water and does not react with water at useful pHs, e g, the linkage is stable under physiological conditions for an extended period of time, perhaps even indefinitely In other embodiments, R*-B is a hydrolytically-unstable or degradable linkage  A hydrolytically-unstable linkage means that the linkage is degradable in<br>
water or in aqueous solutions, including tor example, blood  Enzyinatically-unstable or degradable hnkages also means that the linkage can be degraded by one or more enzymes.<br>
As understood in the art, polyalkylene and related polymers may include degradable linkages in the polymer backbone or in the linker group between the polymer backbone and one or more of the terminal functional groups of the PGC molecule  For example, ester hnkages formed by the reaction of, e.g., PGC carboxylic acids or activated PGC carboxylic acids with alcohol groups on a biologically-active compound generally hydrolyze under physiological conditions to release the agent Other hydrolyticalry-degradabJe linkages iuclude carbonate linkages, mime linkages resulted from reaction of an amine and an aldehyde (See. e.g, Ouchi at al, Polymer Preprints, 3S(l).582-3 {1997)); phosphate ester linkages formed by reacting an alcohol with a phosphate group; acetal linkages that are the reaction product of an aldehyde and an alcohol; orthoestcr linkages that are the reaction product of a formate and an alcohol; peptide linkages formed by an amine group, e g , at an end oi a the PGC, and a carboxyl group of a peptide, and oligonucleohde linkages formed by a phosphoramidite group, eg., at the end of a polymer, and a 5' hydroxyl group of an oligonucleotide.<br>
The polyalkylene glycol, P, can be polyethylene glycol, having the structure of Formula II<br>

Thus, when E is a moiety suitable for forming a bond between the compound of Formula I and a biologically-actrve compound or precmsor thereof, E can be a carboxylic acid, ester, aldehyde, aldehyde hydrate, acetal, hydroxy, protected hydroxy, carbonate, alkenyl, acrylate, methacrylate, acrylamide, substituted or unsubstituted thiol, halogen, substituted or unsubstmited amine, protected amine, hydrazide, protected hydrazidc, succinimidyl, lsocyanate, isothiocyanate, dithiopyridine, vinylpyridine, lodoacetarrride. epoxide, hydroxy succinimidyl, azole. maleimidc, sulfonc, ally], vinylsulfone, tresyl, sulfb-N-succinimidyl, dione, mesyl. tosyl, or glyoxal  It is to be understood that R should be compatible with R so that reaction between E and R does not occur<br>
B&gt; "detectable label"" is meant any label capable of detection. Non-limiting examples include radioactive isotopes, fluorescent moieties, phosphorescent moieties, chemiluminescent<br>
moieties, and quantum dots Other detectable labels include biotin, cysteine, histidine, haemagglutwin, myc or flag tagb.<br>

In this class of compounds, R" is a moiety buitable for forming a bond between the compound of Formula HI and a biologically-active compound or precursor thereof: andR,,J is a moiety suitable for forming a bond between the compound of Formula IV and a biologically-active compound or precursor thereof.<br>
R" and R*'" can be of carboxylic acid, ester, aldehyde, aldehyde hydrate, acetal, hydroxy, protected hydroxy, carbonate, alkenyl. acrylate, methacrylate, acrylamide, substituted or unsubstituted thiol, halogen, substituted oi unsubstituted amine, protected amine, hydrazide, protected hydrazide, succmimidyl, isocyanate, isothiocyanate, dithiopyridine, vinylpyridinc, lodoacctamide, epoxide, hydroxysuccinimidyl, azole, nidleirnide, sulfone, allyl, vinylsulfone, tresyl, sullo-N-succmiraidyl, dione, mesyl, tosyl, oi glyoxal. It is to be understood thatR" and R"' should be compatible with R so that reaction with R does not occur<br>

The conjugates of the invention can be prepared by coupling a biologic ally-active compound to a polyalkylene glycol compound as described in the Examples. In some embodiments, the coupling is achieved via a reductive alky latum reaction<br>
Biologically-active compounds of interest include any substance intended for diagnosis, cure mitigation, treatment, or pievention of disease m humans or other animals, or to otherwise enhance physical or mental well-being of humans or animals. Examples of biologically-active molecules include, but are not limited to, peptides, peptide analogs, proteins, enzymes, small molecules, dyes, lipids, nucleosides, oligonucleotides, analogs of oligonucleotides, sugars, oligosaccharides, cells, viruses, liposomes, micrnpartitles, surfaces and micelles  This class of compounds also include precursors of these types of molecules Gasses of biologically-active agents that are suitable for use with the invention include, but are not limited to, cytokines, chemofanes, rymphokmes, soluble receptors, antibodies, antibiotics, fungicides, anti-viral agents, anti-mflammatory agents, anti-tumor agents, cardiovascular agents, anti-anxiety agents, hormones, growth factors, steroidal agents, and the like<br>
The biologically-active compound can be a peptide, such as an interferon, including interferon-beta (e.g., mterferon-beta-la) or mterferon-alpha<br>
Because the polymeric modification with aPGC of the invention reduces antigenic responses, a foreign peptide need not be completely autologous in order to be used as a therapeutic  For example, a peptide, such as interferon, used to prepare polymer conjugates may be prepared from a mammalian extract, such as human, raminant, or bovine interferon, or can be synthetically or recombinantly produced.<br>
For example, in one aspect, the invention is directed to compounds and methods for treating conditions that are susceptible of treatment with interferon alpha or beta Administration of a polyalkylene glycol conjugated mteiferon beta (hereinafter "PGC IFN-beta". "PGC IFN-(3", c g, PEG IEN-beta", "PEG IFN-fr "PEGylated JFN-beta", or "PEGylated IFN-(3") provides improved therapeutic benefits, while substantially reducing or eliminating entirely the undesirable side effects normally associated with conventionally practiced interferon alpha or beta treatment regimes<br>
The PGC IFN-beta can be prepared by attaching a polyalkylene polymer to the terminal amino group of the IFN beta molecule A single activated polyalkylene glycol molecule can be conjugated to the N-termmus of IFN beta via a reductive alkylation reaction.<br>
The PGC IFN beta conjugate can be formulated, for example, as a liquid or a lyophilized powder for injection. The objective of conjugation of IFN beta with a PGC is to improve the delivery of the protem by significantly prolonging its plasma half-life, and thereby provide protracted activity of IFN beta.<br>
The term "interferon" or "IFN" as used herein means the family of highly homologous species-specific proteins that inhibit viral replication and cellular proliferation and modulate immune response  Human interferons are grouped into two classes; Type 1, including a- and p-rnterferon, and Type II, which is represented by y-interferon only. Recombinant forms of each group have been developed and are commercially available. Subtypes in each group are based on antigenic/structural characteristics<br>
The terms "beta interferon", "beta-interferon", "beta IFN", "beta-lFN", "p interferon", "p-interferon", "P IFN", "p-TJFN", "interferonbeta", "interferon-bcta", "interferon P", "mterferon-p", "IPN beta", "IFN-beta", "IFN0", "IFN-p", and "human fibroblast interferon" are used interchangeably herein to describe members of the group of interferon beta's which have distinct amino acid sequences as have been identified by isolating and sequencing DNA encoding the peptides<br>
Additionally, the terms "beta interferon la", "beti interferon-la" "beta-interferon la", "beta-mterferon-la", "beta IFN la", "beta IFN-la", "beta-TFN la", "beta-IFN-la". "p interferon la", "p interferon-la", "p-mterferon la", "p-interferon-la", "P IFN la", "piFN-la", "p-iFN la". "jMFN-la", "interferon beta la", "interferon beta-la", 'interferon-beta la", "interferon-beta-la", "interferon P la", 'interferon P-la", "interiemn-p la", "interferon-ß-la", "IFNbcta la", "IFN beta-la", "IFN-beta la", "IFN-beta-la". "IFN P la", "IFN p-la", "IFN-p la", "IFN-P-la" are used interchangeably herein to describe recombinantly- or synthetically-produced interferon beta that has the naturally-occuriing (wild type) amino acid sequences<br>
The advent of recombinant DNA technology applied to interferon production has permitted several human interferons to be successfully synthesized, thereby enabling the large-scale fermentation, production, isolation, and purification of various interferons to homogeneity. Recombinantly produced interferon retains some- or most of- its in \itro and in vivo antiviral and immunomodulatory activities   It is also understood that recombinant techniques could also include a glycosylation site for addition of a carbohydrate moiety on the recombinantly-denved polypeptide.<br>
The construction of recombinant DNA plasmids containing sequences encoding at least part of human fibroblast interferon and the expression of a polypeptide having immunological or biological activity of human fibroblast interferon is also contemplated. The construction of<br>
hybrid beta-vnterferon genes containing combinations of different subtype sequences can be accomplished by techniques known to those of sbll in the art<br>
Typical suitable recombinant beta-interfcrons which may be used in the practice of the invention include but are not limited to interferon beta-la such as AVONEX* available from Biogen, Inc., Cambridge, MA, and mlerferon-beta-lb such as BETASERON* available from Berlex, Richmond, CA.<br>
There are many mechanisms by which IFN-induced gene products provide protective elfects against viral infection  Such inhibitory viral effects occur at different stages of the viral life cycle  See U.S Patent No 6,030,785  For example, IFN can inhibit uncoatmg of viral particles, penetration, and/or fusion caused by viruses<br>
Conditions that can be treated in accordance with the present invention are generally those that are susceptible to treatment with interferon  For example, susceptible conditions include those, which would lespond positively or favorably (as these terms arc lenown in the medical arts) to interferon beta-based therapy  For purposes of the invention, conditions that can be treated with interferon beta therapy described herein include those conditions in which treatment with an interferon beta shows some efricacy, but in which tire negative side effects of BFN-p treatment outweigh the benefits  Treatment according to the methods of the invention results in substantially reduced or eliminated side effects ds compared to conventional interferon beta treatment. In addition, conditions traditionally thought to be refractory to JFN-P treatment, or those for which it is impractical to treat with a manageable dosage of IFN-p, can be treated in accordance with the methods of the present invention.<br>
The PGC IFN-P compounds of the invention can be used alone or in combination with one or more agents useful for treatment for a particular condition. At least one pilot study of recombinant interferon beta-la for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C has been conducted See generally Habeisetzer et al, Liver 30:437-441 (2000), incorporated herein by reference. For example, the compounds can be administered in combination with known antiviral agents for treatment of a viral infection. See Kakumu et al, Gastroenterology 105 507-12 (1993) and Pepinsky, et al, J. Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, 297.1059-1066 (2001), incorporated herein by reference<br>
As used herein, the term "antivirals" may include, for example, small molecules, peptides, sugars, proteins, virus-derived molecules, protease inhibitors, nucleotide analogs and/or nucleoside analogs, A 'small molecule" as the term is used herein refers to an organic molecule of less than about 2500 amu (atomic mass units), preferably less than about 1000 amu Examples of suitable antiviral compounds include, but are not limited to, ribavirin.<br>
levovkin, MB6S60, zidovudine 3TC, FTC, acyclovir, gancyclovir, viramide, VX-497, VX-950, and IS1S-14803.<br>
Exemplary conditions which can be treated with interferon include, but are not limited to, cell proliferation disorders, in particular multiple sclerosis, cancer (e.g., hairy cell leukemia, Kaposi's sarcoma, chronic myelogenous leukemia, multiple myeloma, basal cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma, ovarian cancer, cutaneous T cell lymphoma), and viral infections. Without limitation, tieatment with interferon may be used to treat conditions which would benefit from inhibiting the replication of rnterferon-sensitive viruses. For example, interferon can be used alone or m combination with AZT in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS or m comhmdtion with ribavirin m the treatment of HCV. Viral infections which may be treated in accordance with the invention include, but are not limited to, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, other non-A/non-B hepatitis, herpes virut., Epstein-Barr virus (LBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex, human herpes virus type 6 (HIIV-6), papilloma, poxvirus, picornavmis, adenovirus, rhmovrrus, human T lymphotropic virus-type 1 and 2 (HTLV-1/-2), human rotavirus, rabies, retroviruses including HIV, encephalitis, and respiratory wal infections  The methods of the invention can also be used to modify various immune responses.<br>
A correlation between HCV genotype and response to interferon therapy has been observed  See U.S Patent No 6,030,785, Enomoto et al, N. Engl. J. Med.334:77-Sl (1996); Enomoto et al, J Clin. Invest 96.224-30(1995). The response rate in patients infected with HCV-lbis less than 40%  See U.S. Patent No 6,030,785   SirmlaT low response rates have also been observed in patients infected with HCV-1 a. See id, Hoofhagel et al.. Intervirology 37:87-100 (1994). However, the response rate in patients infected with HCV-2 is nearly 80% See U.S Patent No 6,030,785, Fried et a]., Semm. Liver Dis. 15-82-91 (1995). In fact, an amino acid sequence oi a discrete region of the NS5A protein of HCV genotype lb was found to correlate with sensitivity to interferon. See US Patent No 6,030,785, incorporated herein by reference  See also Enomoto et al 1996, Enomoto et al. 1995   Tins region has been identified as the interferon sensitivity determining region (ISDR). See id.<br>
f he PGC EFN-beta conjugate is administered in a pharmacologically-efiectivc amount to treat any of the conditions described above, and is based on the IFN beta activity of the polymeric conjugate   The term "pharmacologically-effective amount" means the amount of a drug or pharmaceutical agent that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue, system, animal oi human that is being sought by a researcher or clinician   It is an amount that is sufficient to significantly affect a positive clinical response while maintaining diminished<br>
levels of side effects. The amount of PGC IFN-beta which may be administered to a subject in need thereof is in the range of 0.01-100 µg/kg, or more preferably 0.01-10 µg/kg, administered m single or divided doses<br>
Administration of the described dosages may be every other day, but preferably occurs once a week or once every other week. Doses are administered over at least a 24 week period by injection.<br>
Administration of the dose can be oral, topical, intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, or any other acceptable systemic method. Based on the judgment of the attending clinician, the amount of drug administered and the treatment regimen used will, of course, be dependent on the age, sex and medical history of the patient being treated, the neutrophil count ( g., the seventy of the neutropenia), the severity of the specific disease condition and the tolerance of the patient to the treatment as evidenced by local toxicity and by systemic side-effects<br>
In practice, the conjugates of the invention are administered in amounts which will be sufficient to inhibit or prevent undesired medical conditions or disease in a subject, such as a mammal, and are used in the form most suitable for such purposes. The compositions are preferably suitable for internal use and include an effective amount of a pharmacologically-active compound of the invention, alone or in combination with other active agents, with one or more pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers. The compounds are especially useful in that they have very low, if any, toxicity.<br>
The conjugates herein described can form the active ingredient of a pharmaceutical composition, and are typically administered in a mixture with suitable pharmaceutical diluents, excipients or carriers (collectively referred to herein as "carrier" materials) suitably selected with respect to the intended form of administration, that is, oral tablets, capsules, elixirs, syrups and the like. The compositions typically will include an effective amount of active compound or the pharmaccuticaily-acceptable salt thereof, and in addition, and may also include any earner materials as are customarily used in the pharmaceutical sciences   Depending on the intended mode of administration, the compositions may be in solid, semi-solid or liquid dosage form, such as, for example, injcctables, tablets, suppositories, pills, time-release capsules, powders, liquids, suspension4;, or the like, preferably in unit dosages.<br>
Conventional pharmaceutical compositions comprising a pharmacologically-effective amount of a conjugate, e g, PGC IFN-bera, together with pharmaceutically-acceptabk earners, adjuvants diluents, preservatives and/or solubilizets may be used in the practice of the invention. Pharmaceutical compositions of interferon include diluents of various buffers (e.g,<br>
arginine, Tns-HCl, acetate, phosphate) having a range of pH and ionic strength, carriers (e g, human serum albumin), solubilizcrs (eg., twcen, polysorbate), and preservatives (e g, benzyl alcohol). See, for example, U.S. Pat. No 4,496,537<br>
Administration of the active compounds described herein can be via any of the accepted modes of administration for therapeutic agents. These methods include systemic or local administration such as oral, nasal, parenteral, transdermal, subcutaneous, or topical administration modes<br>
For instance, for oral administration in the form of a tablet or capsule (e.g., a gelatin capsule), the active drug component can be combined with an oral, non-toxic pharmaceutically-acceptable inert earner such as ethanol, glycerol, water, and the like. Moreover, when desired or necessary, suitable binders, lubricants, disintegrating agents, and coloring agents can also be incorporated into the mixture. Suitable binders include starch, magnesium aluminum silicate, starch paste, gelatin, methylcellulose, sodium carhoxymethyluellulose and/or polyvinylpyrrolidone, sugars, com sweeteners, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, tragacanth OT sodium alginate, polyethylene glycol, waxes and the like. Lubricants used m these dosage forms include sodium oleate, sodium stearate, magnesium stearate, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium chlonde, silica, talcum, stearic acid, its magnesium or calcium salt and/or polyethylene glycol and the like. Disintegrators include, without limitation, starch, methyl cellulose, agar, bentonite, xanthan gum starches, agar, algvnic acid or its sodium salt, or effervescent mixtures, and the like. Diluents, include, e.g., lactose, dextrose, sucrose, manrutol, sorbitol, cellulose and/or glycine.<br>
The conjugates of the invention can also be administered in such oral dosage forms as timed-release and sustained-release tablets or capsules, pills, powders, granules, elixcrs, tinctures, suspensions, syrups, and emulsions.<br>
Liquid, particularly injectable compositions can, for example, be prepaied by dissolving, dispersing, etc   The active compound is dissolved m or mixed with a pharmaceutically-pure solvent such as, for example, water, saline, aqueous dextrose, glycerol, ethanol. and the like, to thereby form the injectable solution or suspension. Additionally, solid forms suitable for dissolving in liquid prior to injection can be formulated. Injectable compositions are preferably aqueous isotonic solutions or suspensions. The compositions may be sterilized and/or contain adjuvants, such as preserving, stabilizing, wetting or emulsifying agents, solution promoters, salts for regulating the osmotic pressure and/or buffers. In addition, they may also contain other therapeutically-valuable substances.<br>
The conjugates of the present invention can be administered in intravenous (e.g., bolus or infusion), intraperitoneal, subcutaneous or intramuscular form, all using forms well known to those of ordinary skill in the pharmaceutical arts. Injectables can be prepared m conventional forms, either as liquid solutions or suspensions<br>
Parental injectable administration is generally used for subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous injections and infusions  For example, when a subcutaneous injection is used to deliver 0 01-100 (ig/kg, or more preferably 0 01-10 pg/kg of PEGylated IfN-beta over one week, two injections of 0 005-50 u.g/kg, or more preferably 0.005-5 ug/kg, respectively, may be administered at 0 and 72 hours.

As described above, the course of the disease and its response to drug treatments may be followed by clinical examination and laboratory findings. The effectiveness of the therapy of the invention is determined by the extent to which the previously described signs and symptoms of a condition, e g. chronic hepatitis, are alleviated and the extent to which the normal side effects of interferon (i e., flu-like symptoms such as fever, headache, chills,<br>
myalgia, fatigue, etc and central nervous system related symptoms such as depression, paresthesia, impaired concentration, etc.) are eliminated or substantially reduced.<br>
In home embodiments, a polyalkylated compound of the indention (e.g.. a PKGylated interferon) is administered in conjunction with one or mure pharmaceutical agents useful for treatment lor a particular condition. For example, a polyalkylated protein can be administered in combination with a known antiviral agent or agent for treatment of a viral infection. Such antiviral compounds include, for example, nbavirin, levovtnn, MB 6866, and zidovudine 3TC, FTC, acyclovir, gancyclovir. vimmide, VX-497, VX-950, and ISIS-14803.<br>
The conjugate and antiviral can be simultaneously administered {e.g„ the agents are administered to a patient together); sequentially administered (e g., the agents are administered to the patient one after the other); or alternatively administered (e g., the agents are administered in a repeating series, such as agent A then agent B, then agent A, etc.).<br>
In the practice of the invention, the preferred PGC IFN-bcta (eg, PEG IFN-bcta) may be administered to patients infected with the hepatitis C virus. Use of PEG EFN-beta-la is preferred<br>
Patients are selected for treatment from anti-HCV antibody-positive patients with biopsy-documented chronic active hepatitis.<br>
In order to follow the course of HCV replication in subjects in response to drug treatment, HCV RNA may be measured in serum samples by, for example, a nested polymerase chain reaction assay that uses two sets of pnmers derived from the NS3 and NS4 non-structural gene regions of the IICV genome  See Farci et al., 1991, New Eng. J Med 325:98-104   Utrich et al, 1990. J Clin Invest, 861609-1614.<br>
Antiviral activity may be measured by changes m HCV-RNA titer. HCV RNA ddta may be analyzed by comparing titers at the end of treatment with a pre-treatrnent baseline measurement. Reduction in HCV RNA by week 4 provides evidence of antiviral activity of a compound. See Kkter et al-, 1993, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 37(3):595-97; Onto et al., 1995, J. Medical Virology, 46 109-115. Changes of at least two orders of magnitude (&gt;2 log) is interpreted as evidence of antiviral activity.<br>
A person suffering from chrome hepatitis C infection may exhibit one or more of the following signs or symptoms (a) elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), (b) positive test tor anti-HCV antibodies, (c) presence of HCV as demonstrated by a positive test for HCV-RNA, (d) cluneal stigmata of chronic liver disease, (e) hepatocellular damage. Such criteria may not only be used to diagnose hepatitis C, but can be used to evaluate a patient's response to drug treatment<br>
Elevated alanine; ammohansferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are known to occur m uncontrolled hepatitis C, and a complete response to treatment is generally defined as the nonnalization of these serum enzymes, particularly ALT  See. Davis et al., 1989, New Eng. J. Med. 321:1501-1506. ALT is an enzyme released when liver cells are destroyed and is symptomatic of HCV infection  Interferon causes synthesis of the enzyme 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (2'5'OAS), which in turn, results in the degradation of the viral mRNA. See Houglum, 1983, Clinical Pharmacology 2 20-28   Increases in serum levels of the 2'5'OAS coincide with decrease in ALT levels.<br>
Histological examination of liver biopsy samples may be used as a second criteria for evaluation. See. e,g,, Knodell et al„ 1981,Hepatology 1-431-435, whose Histological Activity Index (portal inflammation, piecemeal or bridging necrosis, lobular injury, and fibrosis) provides a scoring method for disease activity.<br>
Safety and tolerabihty or treatment may be determined by clinical evaluations and measure ot white blood cell and neutrophil counts   This may be assessed through periodic monitoring of hematological parameters e g, white blood cell, neutrophil, platelet, and red blood cell counts).<br>
Various other extended- or sustained-release formulations can be prepared using conventional methods well known in the art.<br>
Many modifications and variations of this invention can be made without departing from its spirit and scope, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The specific embodiments described herein are offered by way of example only, and the invention is to be limited only by the terms of the appended claims, along with the full scope of equivalents to which such claims are entitled All patents and publications cited herein are incorporated by reference<br>

The PEGylated IFN-ß-1 a was subjected to extensive characterization, including analysis by SDS-PAGE, size exclusion chromatography (SEC), peptide mapping, and assessment of activity m an in vitro antiviral assay   The purity of the product, as measured by SDS-PAGE and SEC, was greater than 90%   In the PEGylated sample there was no evidence of aggregates. Residual levels of unmodified IFN-µ-la in the product were below the limit of quantitation, but appear to represent about 1% of the product The specific activity of the PEGylated IFN-ß-la in the antiviral activity assay was reduced approximately 2-fold compared to the unmodified IFN-ß-1 a (EC50 = 32 pg/mL for 20 kDa mPEG-O-2-methylpropionaldehyde-modifiedTFN-ß-la versus EC50= 14 pg/mL for unmodified IFN-ß-1 a). The PEGylated IFN-ß-la bulk was formulated at 30 µg/mL in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) pH 7 3, containing 14 rag/mL human serum albumin (HSA), similar to the formulation used for AVONEX® (Biogen, Cambridge. MA) which has been subjected to extensive characterization- The material was supplied as a frozen liquid which was stored at -70 °C<br>

1   Preparation of 20 kDa mPEG-O-ß-pherjvlacetaldehvde-modilied IFN-ß-la  20 mL of nonformulated AVONEX$ (EFN-ß-1 a bulk intermediate, a clinical batch of bulk drug that passed all tests tor use m humans, at 250 Hg/mL in 100 mM sodium phosphate pH 7 2,200 mM NaCl) was diluted with 24 mL of 165 mM MES pH 5 0,100 u.L of 5 N HC1, and 24 mL water. The sample was loaded onto a 600 uL SP-Sephamse FF column (Pharmacia). The column was washed with 2 x 900 uL of 5 mM sodium phosphate pH 5.5, 75 mM NaCl, and the protein was eluted with 5 mM sodium phosphate pH 5 5, 600 mM NaCl. Elution fractions were analyzed for then absurbance at 280 ran and the concentration of IFN-ß-la in the samples was estimated using an extinction coefficient of 1.5.1 for a 1 mg/mL solution  The peak fractions were pooled tu give an IFN-ß-la concentration of 2 3 mg/mL. To 1.2 mL of the IFN-p-1 a from the SP-Sepharosc eluate pool, 0.5 M sodium phosphate pH 6.0 was added to 50 mM, sodium cyanoborohydride f Aldrich) was added to 5 mM, and 20 kDa mPKG-O-ß-phenylacetaldehyde, was added to 10 mg/mL. The sample was incubated at room temperature for 18 h in the dark  The PEGylated IFN-ß-1 a was purified from the reaction mixture on a 0 75 mL SP-Sepharose FF column as follows: 1.5 mL of reaction mixture was diluted with 7 5 mL of 20 mM MES pH 5.0, 7.5 mL water, and 5 pL 5 N HO, and loaded onto the SP-Sepharosc column   The column was washed with sodium phosphate pH 5,5, 75 mM NaCl and then the PEGylated IFN-ß-la was eluted from the column with 20 mM MES pH 6 0, 600 mM NaCl. The PEGylated IFN-ß-1 a was further purified on a Superose 6 HR 10/30 FPLC sizing column with 5 mM sodium phosphate pH 5 5, 150 mM NaCl as the mobile phase  The sizing column (25 mL) vvas run at 20 mL/h and 0 5 mL fiactions were collected   The elution<br>
fractions were analyzed for protein content by absorbance at 280 nm, pooled, and the protein concentration of the pool determined. The PEGylnted IFN-ß-la concentration is reported in IFN equivalents after adjusting for the contribution of the PEG (20 kDa mPEG-O-p-phenylacetaldehyde has an extinction coefficient at 2SO nm of 0.5 for a 1 mg/mL solution) to the absorbance at 280 nm usmg an extinction coefficient of 2 for a 1 mg/mL solution of the PEGylated IFN-ß-la   Samples of the pool were removed for analysis, and the remainder was diluted to 30 µg/mL with HSA-con taming formulation buffer, aliquoted at 0.25 mL/vial, and stored at -70 °C<br>
2 UV spectrum of purified 20 kDa rnPEG-O-ß-phenvlacetaldehvde-modified IFN-3-la. The UV spectrum (240-340 nm) of 20 kDa mPECi-O-ß-phenylacetaldehyde-modified IFN-ß-la was obtained using the pre-HSA-fommlated bulk sample   The PEGylated sample exhibited an absorbance maximum at 278-279 nm and an absorbance minimum at 249-250 nm, consistent with that observed for the unmodified LFN-ß-1 a bulk intermediate   The protein concentration of the PEGylated product was estimated from the spectrum using an extinction coefficient of B2so° ^ = 2.0. The protein concentration of the PEGylated bulk was 0 10 mg/mL  No tufbidity w as present in the sample as evident by the lack of absorbance at 320 nm<br>
3. Characterization of 20 kDa mPEG-Q-ß-phenvlacetaldefryde-modified IFN-O-la by SDS-PAGE    2.5 fig of unmodified and 20 kDa inPEG-O-_p-phenylacetaldehyde-modified IFN-ß-la were subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions on a 10-20% gradient gel The gel was stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R-250, and is shown in Figure 4 (Lane A. 20 kDa mPEG-O-ß-phenylacetaldehydc-modified IFN-ß-ia, Lane B: unmodified IFN-ß-la; Lane C: molecular weight markers (from top to bottom, 100 kDa, 68 kDa, 45 kDa, 27 kDa, and 18 kDa, respectively)). SDS-PAGE analysis of 20 kDa mPEG-O-^-plienylacetaldehyde-modifled IFN-ß-1 a revealed a single major band with an apparent mass of 5 5 kDa consistent with modification by a single PEG  No higher mass forms resulting from the presence of additional PEG groups were detected. In the purified PEGylated product unmodified IFN-ß-la was detected; however, the amount is below the limit of quantitation. It is estimated that the level of unmodified IFN-ß-la in the preparation accounts for only about 1% of the total protein.<br>
4	Characterization of 20 kDa mPEG-O-ß-phenylacetaldehyde-modified IFN-B-la by size exclusion chromatography. 20 kDa mPEG-O-ß-phenylacetaldehyde-modified IFN-ß-la was subjected to SEC on an analytical Superose 6 HP10/30 FPLC sizing column using PBS pH 7 2 as the mobile phase  The column was run at 20 mL/h and the eluent was monitored for absorbance at 280 run, as shown in FigUTe 5 Panel A molecular weight standards (670 kDa, thyroglobulin, 158 kDa, gamma globulin; 44 kDa, ovalbumin, 17 kDa, myoglobin; 1 3 kDa, vitamin B12); Panel B 20 kDa mPEG-O/7-phenylacctaldehyde-modificd IFN-ß-la. The PEGy fated IFN-ß-la eluted as a single sharp peak with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 200 kDa consistent with the large hydrodynamic volume of the PEG  No evidence of aggregates was observed  Unmodified IFN-ß-la in the preparation was detected but was below the limit of quantitation   Based on the size of the peak, the unmodified IFN-B-la accounts for 1% or less of the product, consistent with that observed using SDS-PAGE<br>
5	Analysis of 20 kDa mPEG-Q-ß-phenvlacetaldehyde-modificd IFN-B-la by peptide mapping   The specificity of the PEGylation reaction was evaluated by peptide mapping Unmodified and 20 kDa mPEG-O-ß-phenylacctaldehyde-modified IFN-ß-1 a were digested with cndoproteinase Lys-C from Achromobacter (Wako Biopraducts) and the resulting cleavage pnnlucts were fractionated by reverse-phase HPLC on a Vydac C4 column using a 30 mm gradient from 0 to 70% acetomrnle, raO 1% TFA   The column elueni was monitored for absorbance at 214 run<br>
All of the predicted peptides from the endoproteinase Lys-C digest of IFN-ß-la have been identified previously by N-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometry (Pepinsky et al., (2001) J Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics 297-1059), and, of these, only the peptide that contains the N-teiminus of IFN-ß-la was altered by modification with 20 kDa mPEG-O-jD-phcnylacetaldehyde; as evident by its disappearance from the map. The mapping data therefore indicate that the PEG moiety is specifically attached to this peptide  The data further indicate that the PEG modification is targeted at the N-terminus of the protein since only the N-terminal modification would result in the specific loss of this peptide.<br>
6	Stability of 20 kDa mPEG-O-ß-phenylacelalderryde-modified IFN-B-la. To test the<br>
stability of 20 kDa mPEG-ß-phenylacetaldehyde-modified IFN-ß-la, samples were diluted<br>
to 0,1 pg/rnL with 100 mM Tns-HCl buffer, pH 7 4, and were then incubated at 37 CC for up to<br>
7 days. 20 |iL of sample (2 fig) was removed at days 0, 2, 5, and 7, and analyzed by SDS-<br>
PAGR under reducing conditions, as shown in Figure 6 Lane A molecular weight markers<br>
 (from top to bottom, 100 kDa, 68 kDa, 45 kDa, 27 kDa, 18 kDa, and 15 kDa, respectively); Lanes B, C, D, and E mPEG-O-p-phenylacetaldehyde-modified IFN-ß-la removed at day C, 2, 5, and 7, respectively. No evidence of aggregation or degradation of PEGylated lFN-O-la was observed even after 7 days at 37 °C<br>
EXAMPLE 3. Specific activity of PEGylated human IFN-ß-la in an in vitro antiviral assay<br>
The specific antiviral activity of PEGylated IFN-ß-la samples was tested on human lung carcinoma cells (A549 cells) that had been exposed to encepbalomyocarditis (EMC) virus&gt;, and using the metabolic dye 2,^-bis[2-Methoxy-4-nitro-5-s&gt;ulfo-phenyl]-2II-tetrazolium-5-carboxyanilide (MTT; M-5655, Sigma. St Louis, MO) as a measure of metabolically-active cells remaining after exposure to the virus. Briefly, A549 cells were pretieated for 24 h with either unmodified or PEGylated IFN-ß-la (starting at 66 7 pg&gt;mL and diluting serially 1.5-fold to 0 8 pg/rnL) prior to challenge wilh virus. The cells were then challenged for 2 days with EMC virus at a dilution that resulted in complete cell killing in the absence of iFN  Plates were then developed with MTT. A stock solution of MTT was prepared at 5 mg/mL in PBS and sterile-filtered, and 50 pL of this solution was diluted into cell cultures (100 pJL per well) Following incubation at room temperature for 30-60 nun, the MTT/media solution was discarded, cells were washed with 100 \iL PBS, and finally the metabolized dye was solubilized with 100 fiL 1.2 N HCl in lbopropanol. Viable cells (as determined by the presence of the dye) were quantified by absorbance at 450 ran   Data were analyzed by plotting absorbance agjmbt the concentration of IFN-(V la, and the activity of IFN-ß-la was defined as the concentration at which 50% of the cells wrere killed ; e   the 50% cytopathic effect (ECso") or 50% maximum OD^so   The assay was performed eight times for unmodified IFN-ß-la and three to four times with the various PEGylated IFN-ß-la samples  For each assay, duplicate data points for each protein concentration were obtained. Representative plols of cell viability versus the concentration of unmodified or PEGylated IFN-ß-1 a are shown in Figures 7A and<br>

EXAMPLE 4. Pharmacokinetics of intravenously-administered unmodified and PEGylated IFNs-ß-la in rats<br>
Canulated female Lewis rats were injected intravenously with either SO p-gftg of unmodified IFN-ß-la or 24 ^g/kg of the following PEGylated IFNs-ß-la; 20 kDa mPEG-O-2-methylpropionaldehyde-modrfied IFN-ß-la, 20 kDa mPEG-O-/;-methylphenyl-()-2-methylpropionaldehyde-modiHed IFN-ß-la, 20 kDa mPEG-O-/NphenylacetaJdehyde-inodified IFN-ß-la. 20 kDa mPEG-O-yj-phenylpropionaldehyde-modifiedIFN-ß-la. 20kDa mPEG-O-/»-phenylacetaldehyde-modified IFN-ß-la, and 20 kDa mPEG-O-m-methylphenyl-O-2-methylpropionaldehyde-modified IFN-ß-la. Both tlie unmodified and PEGylated proteins were formulated tn the presence of 14-15 mg/raL HSA as a earner. For the unmodified<br>
protein, blood (0.2 ml_) was obtained via the canula at different time points; immediately prior to administration, and at 0.083, 0 25,0.5,1 25.3, and 5 hours post-administration  For the PEGylated proteins, blood (0 2 mL) was obtained via the canula immediately prior to administration, and at 0.083, 025, 0.5,1 25,3, 24, 48, and 72 hpost-administration  Whole blood was collected into serum separator tubes (Beckton Dickinson No. 365956) and incubated at room temperature for 60 mm to allow for clotting. The clotted blood was centriluged for 10 min at 4 °C, and the serum removed and stored at -70 °C until the time of assay<br>
The serum samples were then thawed and tested in antiviral assays. The serum samples were diluted 1 50 into serum-containing medium (Dulbecco's Modified Eagles Medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 U each of penicillin and streptomycin, and 2 mM L-glutnmine) and tested in antiviral assays   Samples were titrated into designated wells of a 96 well tissue culture plate containing human lung carcinoma cells (A549, #CCL-185, ATCC, Rockville, MD). Dilutions of a standard (66 7.44 4, 29.6. 19 8, 13.2, 3 8, 5 9, 3 9, 2 6, 1 7, 1 2, and 0.8 pg/mL of the same form of IFN-ß-la administered to the rat) and of three serum samples were assayed on each plate  The A549 cells were pietreated with diluted scrum samples for 24 h prior to challenge with encephalomyelocarditis (EMC) virus. Following a 2 day incubation with virus, viable cells were stained with a solution of MTT (at 5 mg/mL in phosphate buffer) for 1 h, washed with phosphate buffer, and solubilized with 1.2 N HC1 in isopropanol. The wells were then read at 450 nm   Standard curves of the unmodified or PEGylated IFN-(3-l a were generated for each plate and used to determine the amount of unmodified or PEGylated IFN-ß-la in each test sample  Pharmacokinetic parameters were then calculated using non-compartmental analysis with WinNonLm version 3.0 or 3 3 software,<br>
Figure 8A shows the concentration versus time plots for unmodified IFN-ß-la (upper panel) and IFN-ß-la modified with 20 kDa mPEG-O-2-methylpropionaldehyde (lower panel), and Figure 8B shows the concentration versus time plots for IFN-ß-la modified with 20 kDa mPEG-O-^'methylphenyl-O-2-methylpropionaldehyde (upper panel) and 20 kDa mPEG-O-ß-phenylacetaldehydc (lower panel). Data points are averages from measurements from 3 rats.<br>
Table 5 shows the pharmacokinetic parameters Croax (maximal observed concentration), ti/z (elimination half-life) AUC (area under the curve), Vss (distribution volume at steady state), clearance rate, and MRT (mean residence time) for unmodified IFN-ß-la and these forms of PEGylated fFN-ß-1 a. The data shown in Figures SA and 8B and in Table 5 were obtained m the same study.<br>
Figure 9A shows the cnncentTdiion versus time plots for unmodi ried IFN-ß-la (upper panel) and IFN-3-1 a modified with 20 kDa mPEG-O-ß-phenylpropionaluehyde (lower panel). Data points arc averages from measurements from 2 rats Figure 9B shows the concentration versus time plots for IFN-ß-la modified with 20 kDa mPEG-O/n-phenylacetaldchyde (upper panel) and 20 kDa mPEG-O-w-memylphenyl-O-2-methylpropionaldehyde (lower panel). Data pomts are averages from measurements from 3 rats<br>
Table 6 shows the pharmacokinetic parameters for unmodified IFN-ß-la and these forms of PEGylated IFN-ß-la The data shown in Figures 9A and 9B and in Table 6 were obtained in the same study; independent from the data shown m Figures 8 \ and 8B, and in Table 5<br>
As is clear from the data shown in Figures 8 A, SB, 9A, and 9B, and in Tables 5 and 6, PEGylation of IFN-ß-la with the PEG molecules of the invention improves the pharmacokinetic properties of IFN-ß-la. In all cases, the PEGylated proteins were cleared less rapidly than unmodified IFN-ß-la, resulting in clearance rates of 3.9-8.3 mL/h/kgas compared to 160-170 mL/h/kg for the unmodified protein. As a consequence of the reduced clearance rates, the mean residence time (MRT) increased from approximately 1 h for the unmodified protein to 4.S-7 6 h for the PEGylated proteins. Similarly, the elimination half-life (t^) increased from approximately 1 h for the unmodified protein to 5.2-13 h for the PEGylated proteins. The area under the curve (AUC) values were also significantly increased upon PEGylation of IFN-[3-la  For unmodified IFN-fi la, the AUC was approximately 0.5 u.g»h/mL while for the PEGylated proteins the AUC values ranged from approximately 3 to 6 p.g*h/mL, despite the fact that the PEGylated proteins were dosed at a level 3.3-fold lower than the unmodified protein. For the maximal observed concentration (C^), the values were generally higher for unmodified IFN-ß-la than for the PEGylated proteins, reflecting the lower dose of the modified proteins administered. For the volume of distribution at steady state (Vss), the values for all the PEGylated proteins were lower than for unmodified TFN-ß-la, indicating a restnbtion in their ability to exit the central blood compartment<br>

EXAMPLE 5: Comparative pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of unmodified and PEGylated human IFN-B-la in non-human primates<br>
Single and Tepeat dose comparative studies are conducted with unmodified and PEGylated IFN-ß-la to determine their relative stability and activity m non-human primates. In these studies, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the PEGylated IFN-ß-la conjugates is compared to that of unmodified TFN-ß-la and leasonable inferences can he extended to humans<br>
Animals and Methods<br>
Study 1 (repeat dose)<br>
This 15 a parallel group, repeat dose study to evaluate the comparative pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of unmodified and PEGylated IFN-ß-la. Healthy primates (e.g., rhesus monkeys) are used for this study. Prior to dosing, JII animals are evaluated for signs of ill healtli by a laboratory animal vetenninan on two occasions within 14 days prior to te.st article administration; one evaluation must be within 24 h prior to the first test article administration. Only healthy animals receive the test article. Evaluations include a general physical examination and pre-dose blood draws for baseline clinical pathology and baseline antibody level to IFN-J5-1 J. All animals are weighed and body temperatures are recorded within 24 h prior to test article administrations  Twelve subjects aie enrolled and assigned to groups of three to receive 1 x 106 U/kg of unmodified or PEGylated IFN-B-la, but otherwise identical IFN-f5-1 a  Administration is by either the subcutaneous (SC) or intravenous (TV) routes. Six male animals receive test article by the IV route (3 per treatment) and another 6 male animals receive test article by the SC route (3 per treatment), All animals must be naive to IFN-P treatment Each animal is dosed on two occasions, the doses are separated by four weeks  The dose volume is 1 0 mL/kg  Blood is drawn for pharmacokinetic testing at 0, 0 083, 0 25, 0 5,1,1 5,2,4,6, S, 12,24,48, 72, and at 96 hours following each injection  Blood samples for measurement of the IFN-induced biological response marker, serum neoptenn, are drawn at 0,24,48,72,96,168,336, and at 504 h following administration of study drug, Evaluations during the studypenod include clinical observations performed 30 min and 1 h post-dose for signs of toxicity.

Assay Methods<br>
Levels of LFN-ß-1 a m serum are quantitated using a cytopathic effect (CPE) bioassay. The CPE assay measures levels of IFN-mediated antiviral activity  The level of antiviral activity m a sample reflects the number of molecules of active IFN contained in that sample al the time the blood is drawn. This approach has been the standard method to assess the pharmacokinetics of IFN-p. The CPE assay detects the ability of IFN-p to protect human lung carcinoma cells (A549, #CCL-185, ATCC, Rockville, MD) from cytotoxicity due to encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus   The cells are preincubatcd for ] 5-20 h with serum samples to allow the induction and synthesis of IFN-inducible proteins that are responsible for the antiviral response   EMC virus is then added and incubated for a further 30 h before<br>
assessment of cytotoxicity is made using a crystal violet stain. An internal IFN-ß standard as well as a PEGylated LFN-ß-la internal standard is tested concurrently with samples on each assay plate   This standard is calibrated against a natural human fibroblast IFN reference standard (WHO Second International Standard for Interferon, Human Fibroblast, Gb-23-902-53)   Each assay plate also includes cell growth control wells containing neither IFN-(i of any kind nor EMC, and virus control wells that contain cells and EMC but no IFN-|3. Control plates containing the standard and samples are also prepared to determine the effect, if any, of the samples on cell growth. These plates are stained without the addition of virus   Samples and standards are tested in duplicate on each of two replicate assay plates, yielding four data points per sample. The geometric mean concentration of the four replicates is reported. The limit of detection in this assay is 10 U/mL. Serum concentrations of neoptenn are determined at the clinical pharmacology unit using commercially-available assays. Serum concentrations of 2'-5'-OAS are determined at a contract laboratory using a validated cominercialty-available assay<br>
Pharmacokinetic and Statistical Methods<br>
Rstrip™ software (MicroMath, Inc , Salt Lake City. UT) is used to lit data to pharmacokinetic models   Geometric mean concentrations are plotted by time for each group Since assay results are expressed in dilutions, geometric means are considered more appropriate than arithmetic means   Serum IFN levels arc adjusted for baseline values and non-detectable serum concentrations are set to 5 U/mL, which represent"? one-half the lower limit of detection   For IV infusion data, a two compartment IV infusion model is lit to the detectable serum concentrations for each subject, and the SC data are fit to a two compartment injection model.<br>

EXAMPLE 6: Anti-angiogenk effects of PEGylated human IFN-ß-la: the ability of PEGylattd IFN-ß-la to inhibit endothelial cell proliferation in vitro<br>
Human venous endothelial cells (Cell Systems, Cat # 2V0-P75) and human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (Cell Systems, Cat # 2M1-C25) are maintained in culture with CS-C Medium Kit (Cell Systems, Cat. # 4Z0-500). 24 h pnoi to the experiment, cells are trypsinized, and resuspended in assay medium, 90% Ml99 and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and are adjusted to desired cell density. Cells are then plated onto gelatin-coated 24 or 96 well plates, either at 12, 500 cellb/well or 2, 000 cells/well, respectively. Alter overnight incubation, the assay medium is replaced with fresh medium containing 20 ng/mL of human recombinant basic Fibroblast Growth Factor (bFGF) (Becton Dickinson, Cat # 40060) and various concentrations of unmodified or PEGylated IFN-ß-la of the invention or positive control (endostatin can be used as a positive control, as could an antibody to bFGF) are added. The final volume is adjusted to 0 5 mL in the 24 well plate or 0.2 mL in the 96 well plate. After 72 h, cells are trypsinized for Coulter counting, frozen tor CyQuant fluorescence reading, or labeled with [3H]-thymidine  This in vitro assay tests the PEGylated human IFN-fi-la molecules of the invention for effects on endothelial cell proliferation which may be indicative of anh-angiogenic effects m vivo.

Mice were sacrificed on day 10 (Avertm, 0 5 mL mtrapentoneally) and the tumor inoculation sile assessed for neovascularization, measured by an observer blind as to treatment group. Vessels were counted under fixed magnification under a dissecting microscope. Every radially-oncnted vessel entenng the penphery of the tumor was scored as a single vessel  Each group consisted of three mice<br>
As shown in Figure 10, a single administration of ] MU of 20 kDa mPEG-O-2-methylpropiuruldehyde-modified IFN-ß-la (group O was as effective at reducing the number of neovesscis as daily administration of 1 MU of unmodified IFN-ß-la (group B)   However, the effect of the 20 kDa mPEG-O-2-methylpropionaldehyde-modified IFN-ß-la is more pronounced when considering that daily administration of the vehicle alone had some inhibitory effect (compare group A, vehicle given once, with group D, vehicle given daily).<br>
A vancty of otheT models have also been developed which can be used to test the anti-angiogenic and anti-neovasculanzation effects of the PEGylated molecules of the invention Some of these models have been described in United States Patents 5,733,876 (Mar 31,1998. "Method of inhibiting angiogenesis") and 5,135,919 (Aug 4, 1992: "Method and a pharmaceutical composition for the inhibition of angiogenesis")   Other assays include the shell-less chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay of Taylor and Folkman, Nature 297.307 (1982) andCnimetal .Science 230.1375 (1985), the mouse dorsal air sac method anti-angiogencsis model of Folkman et al, J. Exp Med 133 275 (1971), and the rat corneal micropocket ashay of Grmbrone, Jr. etal., J. Natl. Cancer Inst 52'413 (1974) in which corneal vascularization is induced in adult male rats of the Sprague-Dawley strain (Charles RiveT.<br>
Japan) by implanting 500 ng of bFGF (bovine, R&amp;D Systems, Inc.), impregnated in ethylene-vmyl acetate copolymer pellets, m each cornea. In addition, a model exists m which angiogencsis is induced in NTH-Swiss or athymk nude (iw/nu) mice after implantation of MCF-7 breast carcinoma or NIII-OVCAR-3 ovanan carcinoma cells as described by Lindner and Borden, Int. J. Cancer 71 456 (1997)  Additional tumor cell lines including (but not limited to) SK-MEL-1 human malignant melanoma cells may also be used to induce angiogeiiesis as described above. Vanous doses, with vanous dosing frequencies, and lor vanous duration can be tested for both the unmodified and PEGylated IFN-ß-la proteins of the invention<br>
Other methods for testing PEGylated murine and rat TFN-p for anb-angiogenic effects in an anirrul model include (but are not limited to) protocols for screening new potential unticancei agents as described in the onginal Cancer Chemotherapy Reports, Part 3, Vol 3, No 2, September 1972 and the supplement In Vivo Cancer Models, 1976-1982, NIH Publication No 84-2635, February 1984. Because of the species specificity of Type 1 interferons, to assess the ana-angiogemc activity of PEGylated IFN-P in rodent models, PEGylated rodent IFN-p preparations (e g., munne and rat) are generated. Such screening methods are exemplified by a protocol to test for the anti-angiogenic effects of PEGylated munne IFN-P on subcutaneously-implanted Lewis Lung Carcinoma:<br>

An in vivo mouse model is available to test the effect of unmodified and PEGylated munne IFN-p on the levels of human Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) in HBV-transgcmc SCID mice Larkin et al, Nature Medicine 5'907 (1999). In this model, transgenic SCID mice carrying a head-to-tail drmer of the human HBV genome have detectable levels of HBV rephcative forms and pre-gcnomic RNA in the liver, and HBV virus m the berum. Hepatocytes from the transgenic mice are also positive for the HBsAg, HBcAg, and HbxAg proteins, indicative of viral replication  An example of a protocol for comparing unmodified and PEGylated murine IFN-P in thib model is given below.<br>
30 mice (5 groups of 5 plus 5 spare) with comparable viral titer arc titered at two independent time points (at least 1 week apart) to establish a baseline titer and to ensure that their titers remain constant prior to dosing with munne IFN-ß- Groups of 5 mice are dosed 3 times per week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) subcutaneously with the following samples, as shown in Table 7<br>
Table 7<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
Viral titers are determined weekly during dosing and weekly to br-weeldy for 6 months Mowing dosing Plots of viral tiler against time are constructed for a comparison of vehicle and IFN-ß-treated animals with respect to the clearance and re-establishment of viral titer. A second study is then performed with the appropriate doses of unmodified and PEGylated murine IFN-ß with 10-20 mice per group for a total of 30-60 mice (10-20 for control, 10-20 for unmodified murine IFN-p, and 10-20 for PEGylated murine IFN-p), Viral titers are assessed as above, and at sacrifice, serum is analyzed for viral titer as well as for HbsAg by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting Livers are also Temoved, frozen or fixed as necessary, and stained for the presence of HbsAg, HbcAg, and HbxAg. Other appropriate histological, histoehemical, or biochemical tests familiar to those in the art may also be performed on serum and tissue samples<br>
An in vivo mouse model is also available to test the el feet of unmodified and PEGylated human IFN-ß-la on the levels of human Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) in mice carrying chimaenc human livers, Mercer et al., Nature Medicine 7*927 (2001). In this model, normal human hepatocytes are grafted into SCID mice carrying a plasminogen acrivaxor transgene (Aib-uPA) and the mice inoculated with serum from humans infected with the different gentoypes of HCV. The engrafted human liver cells become mfected by the viras and the virus replicates. Levels of HCV RNA in the serum can be quantified by PCK, as well as the levels of positive and negative (rephcative form) RNA in the liver cells. An appropriate study protocol similar to (but not limited to) that described above for unmodified and PEGylated murine IFN-p in transgenic HBV SCID mice is performed to assess the efficacy of unmodified and PEGylated human IFN-ß-1 a in this model i.e. to determine the effect of treatment on HCV titer, liver histology, serum ALT levels, and the presence of HCV rephcative forms in the engrafted human liver tissue Other appropriate histological, histochemical, or biochemical tests familiar to those in (he art may also be performed on serum and tissue samples<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
