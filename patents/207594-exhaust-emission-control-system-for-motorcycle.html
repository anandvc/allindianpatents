PROVISIONAL/COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"EXHAUST EMISSION CONTROL SYSTEM FOR MOTORCYCLE"<br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, having a place of business at 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan<br>
The   following   specification   particularly   describes   the   nature   of  the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br>
429/MUM/2000GRANTED<br><br>
-9-MAY 2000    15-6-2005<br><br>
[Detailed Description of the Invention]<br>
[Technical Field to Which the Invention Pertains] The present invention relates to an exhaust<br>
emission control system for a motorcycle including an<br>
exhaust system of an engine which constitutes a power unit in co-operation with a continuously variable transmission and is swingably supported by a body frame, and a secondary air cleaner for cleaning secondary air to be fed to the exhaust system, wherein the secondary air cleaner is connected to the exhaust system via a check valve. <br>
[Prior Art]<br>
The control system of this type has been known, for example, from Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Hei 5-131969<br>
[Problem to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
The above - described prior art control system, however, has the following problem; namely, since a<br><br><br><br><br>
secondary air cleaner is mounted on a body frame, a connection work of the air cleaner to an exhaust system of an engine must be performed in a state in which a power unit and the secondary air cleaner are assembled on the body frame.  As a result, the connection work of the air cleaner becomes complicated.<br>
To solve such a problem, there may be adopted an assembling procedure of previously mounting the secondary air cleaner to the power unit and connecting the secondary air cleaner to the exhaust system of the engine, and then mounting the power unit to the body frame.  The mounting of the secondary air cleaner to the power unit, however, has a problem that since it is impossible for the power unit to have a space being large enough to mount the secondary air cleaner, the capacity of the<br>
secondary air cleaner must be minimized.  As a result, for<br>
the secondary air cleaner of a type in which an inlet<br>
opened outwardly is provided in a cleaner case of the secondary air cleaner, not only suction sound becomes<br>
large, but also the arrangement range of the inlet is      <br>
limited and the inlet is susceptible to water and mud<br>
splashed by a rear wheel.<br>
[0005]<br><br><br><br><br><br>
In view of the foregoing, the present invention has been made, and an object of the present invention is to provide an exhaust emission control system for a motorcycle, which is capable of facilitating the connection work of a secondary air cleaner to an exhaust<br>
system of an engine, reducing suction sound caused in the secondary air cleaner, and preventing the secondary air<br><br><br><br>
cleaner from being affected by water and mud.<br>
[Means for Solving the Problem]<br>
To achieve the above object, according to an invention  there is provided an<br><br>
exhaust emission control system for a motorcycle including an exhaust system of an engine which constitutes a power unit in co-operation with a continuously variable transmission and is swingably supported by a body frame, and a secondary air cleaner for cleaning secondary air to be fed to the exhaust system, wherein the secondary air cleaner is connected to the exhaust system via a check valve, characterized in that an inlet tube with its one end connected to the secondary air cleaner mounted on the power unit extends from the secondary air cleaner. <br><br><br>
With this configuration, since the secondary air cleaner is mounted to the power unit, it can be connected to the exhaust system of the engine before being assembled to the body frame.  Accordingly, it is possible to facilitate the connection work of the secondary air cleaner to the exhaust system.  Also, it is possible to increase the substantial capacity of the secondary cir cleaner by provision of the inlet tube, and further, it is possible to prevent the secondary air cleaner from being affected by water and mud by extending the inlet tube up to a suitable position. <br>
According to an invention addition to the configuration of the invention described<br><br>
easlier the inlet tube extends up to the lower side of a step floor of a body cover for covering the body frame by way of the vicinity of a shaft for swingably supporting the engine on the body frame.  With this configuration, it is possible to suitably lay out the inlet tube while preventing the inlet tube from being applied with an external bending force or the like caused by swing motion of the power unit as much as possible.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
According to an invention:<br><br><br><br><br><br>
addition to the configuration of the invention <br>
              a box-like compartnent opened upwardly is<br>
disposed under the step floor, and the other end of the inlet tube is opened in the compartment., With this configuration, it is possible to more, effectively reduce occurrence of suction sound, and to more effectively prevent the secondary air cleaner from being effecte.d by water and mud.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to An exhaust emission control system for a motorcycle comprising an exhaust system of an engine (E) which constitutes a power unit (P) in co-operation with a continuously variable transmission (M) and is swingably supported by a body frame (F), and a secondary air cleaner (83) for cleaning secondary air to be fed to said exhaust system, wherein said secondary air cleaner (83) is connected to said exhaust system via a check valve (117) characterized in that an inlet tube (121) with its one end connected to said secondary air cleaner (83) mounted on said power unit (P) extends from said secondary air cleaner (83).<br><br><br>

constitutes the	other half of the crank case 29.<br>
A cylinder head 34 is connected to the front end of the first engine block 32, and a cylinder head 35 is connected to the front end of the cylinder head 34.  A generator cover 36 is connected to the right side surfaces of the first and second engine blocks 32 and 33. <br>
The continuously variable transmission M includes a right casing 37 and a left casing 38 connected to each other.  The right side surface of a front portion of the right casing 37 is connected to the left side surfaces of the first and second engine blocks 32 and 33.  A reducer casing 39 is connected to the right side surface of a rear portion of the right casing 37.<br>
A piston 42 slidably fitted in a cylinder 41 of the first engine block 32 is connected to a crank shaft 31<br><br><br>
via a connecting rod 43 and a crank pin 28.  A cam shaft<br>
44	is rotatably supported by the cylinder head 34, and intake and exhaust valves (not shown) provided in the cylinder head 34 are opened/closed by the cam shaft 44.  A timing chain 45 is contained in a chain passage 40 provided in the first engine block 32.  The timing chain<br>
45	is wound around a drive sprocket 46 provided on the crank shaft 31 and a driven sprocket 47 provided on the cam shaft 44.  The cam shaft 44 makes one revolution per two revolutions of the crank shaft 31.<br><br>
A drive pulley 54 is provided on the left end, projecting in the right casing 37 and the left casing 38, of the crank shaft 31.  The drive pulley 54 includes a fixed pulley half 55 fixed to the crank shaft 31, and a movable pulley half 56 moved close to or apart from the fixed pulley half 55.  The movable pulley half 56 is biased to be moved close to the fixed pulley half 55 by a centrifugal weight 57 which is moved radially outwardly along with an increase in rotational speed of the crank shaft 31.<br>
A driven pulley 59 provided on an output shaft 58 supported between the rear portion of the right casing 37<br><br>
and the reducer casing 39 includes a fixed pulley half 60 relatively rotatably supported by the output shaft 58, and a movable pulley half 61 moved close to or apart from the fixed pulley half 60.

A rear wheel WR is provided on the right end, passing through the reducer casing 39 and projecting rightwardly therefrom, of the axle 66.<br><br>
In such a continuously variable transmission M, the rotational power of the crank shaft 31 is transmitted to the drive pulley 54, and is then transmitted from the drive pulley 54 to the rear wheel WR via the V-belt 64, driven pulley 59, starting clutch 63, and reduction gear<br><br>
train 67 . <br>
Upon rotation of the engine E at a low speed, since the centrifugal force applied to the centrifugal weight 57 of the drive pulley 54 is small, the width of the groove between the fixed pulley half 60 and movable pulley half 61 is reduced by the biasing force of the spring 62 of the driven pulley 59, with a result that a speed varying ratio becomes the "LOW" speed mode.  As the rotational speed of the crank shaft 31 is increased in such a "LOW" speed mode, the centrifugal force applied to the centrifugal weight 57 is increased and thereby the width of the groove between the fixed pulley half 55 and the movable pulley half 56 of the drive pulley 54 is reduced and correspondingly the width of the groove between the fixed pulley half 60 and the movable pulley half 61 of the driven pulley 59 is increased, with a result that the speed varying ratio is continuously varied from the "Low" speed mode to a "TOP" speed mode.<br>
An AC generator 68 provided on the right side of the crank shaft 31 is covered with the generator cover 36, and a radiator 69 is provided on the right side of the generator cover 36.  A cooling fan 70 for supplying<br><br><br>

An air introduction pipe 120 for introducing air from the outside into the second non-cleaning chamber 111 of the secondary air cleaner 83 is provided integrally with the small case portion 86b of the second case member 86 in such a manner as to pass through the cleaner • element 109 with its inner end opened in the second non-cleaning chamber 111.  An inlet tube 121 with its one end connected to the air introduction pipe 120 extends forwardly of the vehicular body by way of the vicinity of a shaft 131 for swingably supporting the engine E on the body frame F.<br>
The engine E is supported on the rear frame 12 of the body frame F via the vibration-proof link 22.  The<br><br><br>
structure of such a vibration-proof link 22 will be<br>
described with reference to Figs. 8 and 9.<br><br>
The vibration-proof link 22 includes a pair of left and right engine side brackets 1231 and 1232 provided on the engine E; a pair of left and right links 1241 and 1242 having lower ends swingably connected to the engine side brackets 123x and 1232 and the upper ends swingably connected to the rear frame 12; a cross-member 125 for connecting the links 1241 and 1242 to each other; and a pair of stopper rubbers 126 and 127 provided on one link 124 in such a manner as to be in contact with the rear frame 12. <br>

In such a vibration-proof link 22, a load applied from the engine E of the power unit P to the swingably supporting shaft 131 is absorbed by elastic deformation of the rubber bushes 129, elastic deformation of the stopper rubber 126 and 127 pressed to the contact surface 136 and 138, and elastic deformation of the rubber bushes 133 . <br>
The inlet tube 121 extends forwardly of the vehicular body by way of the vicinity of the swingably supporting shaft 131 of the vibration-proof link 22.<br>
The body frame F is covered with a synthetic resin made body cover 141.  The body cover 141 includes a leg shield 141a for covering the front side of driver's legs; a step floor 141b connected to a lower portion of the lee shield 141a for allowing driver's feet to be rested thereon; an under cover 141c, connected to the leg shielc<br><br><br>
141a and step floor 141b, for covering the lower side of the step floor 141b; and a side cover 141d, connected to the step floor 141b and under cover 141c, for covering both sides of the rear portion of the vehicular body.<br>
Most of the luggage box 80 supported on the rear frame 12 and the fuel tank 81 supported on the sub-frame 13 are covered with the side cover 141d.  A seat 142 capable of covering the luggage box 80 is openably/closably mounted on the upper portion of the side cover 141d in such a manner as to be located over the engine E.  An oiling cap 81a of the fuel tank 81 projects upwardly from the upper portion of the side cover 141d.<br>
Referring particularly to Fig. 3, a box-shaped compartment 143 opened upwardly is fixedly disposed under the step floor 141b at a position between both the floor supporting frames 16 of the front frame 11.  A battery 145 is contained in a front portion of the compartment 143 in a state being fixed by means of a rubber band 144 .  The compartment 143 also contains relays 146, 147 and 148 disposed on the left side of the battery 145, fuses 149 and 150 disposed on the back side of the battery 145, a<br><br><br>
regulator 151 disposed on the back side of the fuses 149 and 150, and a radiator reserve tank 147 disposed on the back side of the battery 145 and on the right side of the regulator 151.<br>
The inlet tube 121 extends forwardly from the secondary air cleaner 83 with its one end connected to the secondary air cleaner 83.  The other end of the inlet tube 121 extends to the lower side of the step floor 141b, and is opened in the compartment 143.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, in the motorcycle according to this embodiment, the radiator 69 is disposed on the right side of the engine E.  To guard the radiator 69 when such a motorcycle is tilted on the right side for maintenance or the like, the radiator 69 and the cover 74 for covering the radiator 69 are disposed inwardly from the right side outer surface of the under cover 141c.<br>
A plurality (for example, three) of reinforcing ribs 154 are integrally provided on the inner surface of the right side rear portion of the under cover 141c in such a manner as to be able to be brought into contact with the right side surface of the rear frame 12 of the<br><br>
body frame F.  The projecting amount of each reinforcing rib 154 on the rear frame 12 side is set such that in the usual state of the motorcycle, the reinforcing rib 154 is not required to be brought into contact with the right side surface of the rear frame 12; but in the tilting state of the motorcycle on the right side, the reinforcing rib 154 is brought into contact with the right side surface of the rear frame 12 by deflection of the under cover 141c due to contact of the outer right surface of the under cover 141c with the ground, and thereby the cover 74 is not brought into contact with the ground.<br>
The function of this embodiment will be described below.  Since the secondary air cleaner 83 for cleaning secondary air to be fed to the exhaust system of the engine E (exhaust port of the cylinder head 34 in this embodiment) is mounted on the power unit P, it is possible to connect the secondary air cleaner 83 to the exhaust system of the engine E before the assembly of the power unit P to the body frame F, and hence to facilitate the connection work for the secondary air cleaner 83.<br>
The capacity of the secondary air cleaner 83 must<br><br>
be minimized because the secondary air cleaner 83 is mounted to the power unit P; however, since the inlet tube 121 for introducing air from the outside into the secondary air cleaner 83 extends from the secondary air cleaner 83, it is possible to increase the substantial capacity of the secondary air cleaner 83 by the inlet tube 121, and hence to reduce the suction sound of air.<br>
Since the inlet tube 121 extends up to the step floor 141b by way of the vicinity of the shaft 131 for swingably supporting the engine E to the body frame F, the inlet tube 121 can be suitably laid out at a position less affected by water or mud splashed by the rear wheel WR while being prevented from being applied with an external bending force or the like caused by swing motion of the power unit P as much as possible. [0050]<br>
The compartment 143 opened upwardly, which contains the electric equipment such as the battery 145, relays 146, 147 and 148, fuses 149 and 150, and regulator 151, and also contains the radiator reserve tank 147, is disposed under the step floor 141b, and the inlet tube 121 is opened in the compartment 143.  Accordingly, it is possible to more effectively prevent occurrence of<br><br><br>
suction sound of air in the secondary air cleaner 83, and to more effectively prevent the secondary air cleaner 83 from being affected by water or mud.<br>
In this motorcycle, the radiator 69 and the cover 74 for covering the radiator 69 are disposed on the right side of the engine E.  To be more specific, the reinforcing ribs 154, which can be brought into contact with the rear frame 12 of the body frame F, project from the inner surface of the under cover 141c on the side on which the radiator 69 is disposed, that is, on the right side inner surface of the under cover 141c, and the radiator 69 and the cover 74 are disposed inwardly from the right side outer surface of the under cover 141c.<br>
Accordingly, when the motorcycle is tilted for maintenance or the like, the right side outer surface of the under cover 141c is brought into contact with the ground earlier than the radiator 69 and cover 74, so that the rigidity of the right side of the under cover 141c can be ensured by contact of the reinforcing ribs 154 with the rear frame 12.  Accordingly, it is possible to prevent the radiator 69 and cover 74 from being brought into contact with the ground.<br><br>
As a result, it is possible to eliminate the need of using part of the body frame F as the guard for the radiator 69 and the cover 74, and hence to reduce the cost by avoiding an increase in weight of the body frame F.  Also, since the width of the body frame F is not extended, it is possible to prevent the lowering of the resting characteristic of the driver's feet.  Further, since the body frame F can be applied to another kind of the motorcycle only by modifying part of under cover 141c it is possible to enhance the general-purpose properties, <br>
The inlet duct 93 for introducing air from the outside into the air cleaner 82 whose cleaner case 84 is mounted to the power unit P includes the small-diameter pipe 94 having the upper end communicated to the first non-cleaning chamber 91 in the cleaner case 84 and the large-diameter pipe 95 having the diameter larger than that of the small-diameter pipe 94 and having the upper end communicated to the lower end of the small - diameter pipe 94.  The distance L1 between the opening end of the rear portion of the large-diameter pipe 94 and the opening end of the lower portion of the small - diameter pipe 94 is set to be shorter than the distance L2 between<br><br>
the opening end of the lower portion, excluding the above rear portion, of the large-diameter pipe 94 and the opening end of the lower portion of the small - diameter pipe 94.<br>
With this inlet duct 93, it is possible to generate a negative pressure at a position behind the front wall of the large-diameter pipe 95 of the inlet duct 93 upon running of the motorcycle, and hence to effectively introduce outside air into the first non-cleaning chamber 91 via the inlet duct 93 by making use of the negative pressure.  In other words, the suction direction of the outside air into the inlet duct 93 can be specified onto the rear side of the inlet duct 93.  Accordingly, even if dust is deposited on the rear portion of the power unit P by suction of wind due to the negative pressure caused on the rear side of the body cover 141 upon running of the motorcycle, it is possible to avoid the suction of dust into the air cleaner 82 as much as possible.  Further, the feature of generating the negative pressure on the rear side of the large-diameter pipe 95 of the inlet duct 93 can be simply obtained only by providing the notch 96 in part of the large - diameter pipe 95, that is, without increasing the manufacturing cost.<br><br><br>
While the embodiment of the present invention has been described in detail, the present invention is not limited thereto, and it is to be understood that many changes in design may be made without departing from the scope of the claims.<br>
[Effect of the Invention]<br>
