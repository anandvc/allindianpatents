METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR PROVIDING A HIGH SPEED MULTI-STREAM MPEG PROCESSOR<br>
CROSS-REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]	The present application claims the benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. ยง 119<br>
firom U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/486,030, filed July 9,2003, entitled "METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR PROVIDING A fflGH SPEED MULTI-STREAM MPEG DECODER", by WeiMin Zhang, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes as if set forth in full herein.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	The present invention generally relates to a chip architecture for a multi-<br>
stream video processor and more specifically to a high speed multi-stream MPEG decoder.<br>
[0003]	A video stream is traditionally compressed into certain types of MPEG<br>
streams to facilitate transmission. The name MPEG is an acronym for Moving Picture Experts Group. The MPEG standards cover the coding of video data, such as moving pictures or images, and the associated audio data and their synchronization, including multiple and interleaved video sequences. For example, most of the set top boxes today utilize the MPEG-2 video format. MPEG video is highly compressed compared with analog video format, such as NTSC or PAL.<br>
[0004]	MPEG-2 video sequences are made up of three different types of picture<br>
frames, namely, I-fi:ame, P-fi:ame and B-fi:ame. FIG. 1 is a simplified schematic diagram showing a typical MPEG-2 code frame sequence, I-frames are intra-coded frames which are coded independently without reference to other frames. I-frames provide access points to the coded video sequence at which decoding can begin. I-frames, however, are only moderately compressed. The other two frame types, P-frame and B-frame, are inter- or non-intra coded. P-frames are predictively coded frames, meaning that such frames are coded using motion compensation with reference to previous I- or P-frames. P-frmes are coded more efficiently than I-frames. B-frames are bi-directional predictively coded frames. B-frames are coded using motion compensation with reference to past and future I-or P-frames in the video sequence and are highly compressed.<br><br>
[0005]	Traditionally, an MPEG decoder is used to decode the MPEG-2 video frame<br>
sequences. The decoded sequences are then forwarded directly to an analog encoder. The analog encoder then provides the compatible signals to allow an analog display device, such as, a television to display the corresponding video and audio data. An analog display device typically generates video images by reproducing scanned lines within a field in an alternate manner. In other words, the even numbered lines are reproduced first and the odd numbered lines second, or vice versa. The results are then interlaced to produce the video images.<br>
[0006]	If the MPEG-2 video frame sequences are processed in a sequential manner<br>
and there is a relatively limited number of incoming data streams, memory requirements do not present too much of a problem in the foregoing arrangement However, as the number of incoming data streams increases, the amount of memory that is needed to facilitate processing of the MPEG-2 video frame sequences becomes a SERIOUS bottleneck thereby adversely affecting the efficiency of a system.<br>
[0007]	Hence, it would be desirable to provide an improved MPEG decoder that is<br>
capable of handling video processing in a more efficient manner.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0008]	An MPEG processor is provided. According to one aspect of the processor,<br>
multiple MPEG data streams for corresponding channels are individually stored in an off-chip memory. Corresponding data for a channel is then retrieved from the off-chip memory for processing. The retrieved data is then decoded. The decoded results and associated information are stored on the off-chip memory. Some or all of the associated information that can be used for decoding subsequent data is stored in an on-chip memory. When video images need to be displayed, the corresponding data that is needed for that purpose is then retrieved from the off-chip memory and provided to an analog encoder for encoding in a format that is compatible with an analog display device.<br>
[0009]	In one embodiment, the R4PEG processor includes a video transport engine<br>
configured to receive MPEG data from a number of channels and forward the MPEG data to an off-chip memory for storage; an on-chip memory; control logic configured to retrieve data for a channel from the off-chip memory; a decoder configured to decode the retrieved data and generate decoded data and associated information; control logic configured to forward the decoded data and associated information to the off-chip memory and store some or all of the associated infonnation in the on-chip memory; and control logic configured to retrieve<br><br>
the some or all of the associated information stored in the on-chip memory and forward the some or all of the associated information to the decoder for use in subsequent decoding. The MPEG processor further includes control logic configured to retrieve the decoded data and associated information from the off-chip memory; and an encoder configured to generate encoded results using the decoded data and associated information retrieved from the off-chip memory; wherein the encoded results are suitable for use by an analog display device.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0015]	The present invention in the form of one or more exemplary embodiments will<br>
now be decribed. According to one exemplary embodiment of the present invention, an improved chip architecture is provided for KlPEG-2video decoding of multi-stream video data. FIG. 2 is a simplified schematic block diagram illustrating a first exemplary embodiment of a system in accordance with the present invention. In this exemplary embodiment, the system 10 is made up of a number of components including a processing module 12 and an off-chip memory 26. The processing module 12 further includes a video transport engine 14, an on-chip memory 16, a digital video/audio decoder 18, a number of direct access memories 20a-d, a memory interface 22, an analog encoder 24 and control logic<br><br>
controlling operations amongst the various components. In one implementation, the processing module 12 are built on an integrated circuit chip. Based on the disclosure and teachings provided herein, a person of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate other ways and/or methods to implement the present invention.<br>
[0016]	The system 10 processes multiple MPEG-2 data streams from various<br>
channels in the following exemplary manner. The multiple data streams are received by the video transport engine 14. The video transport engine 14 processes the multiple data streams by first storing the corresponding data stream(s) for each channel into the direct access memory 20a. It should be understood that each channel may be associated with one or more data streams. For example, a channel may have one video stream with corresponding audio stream(s) and/or other related stream(s). Data from the direct access memory 20a is then offloaded onto the off-chip memory 26 for storage via the memory interface 22. When sufficient data has been stored for a channel for further processing, the corresponding data for that charmel is read out from the off-chip memory 26. Data from the off-chip memory 26 is stored in the direct access memory 20b for subsequent processing by the digital video/audio decoder 18, The decoder 18 processes data one channel at a time, as will be further described below. In one embodiment, the decoder 18 is able to process data for a charmel in parallel.<br>
[0017]	FIG. 4 is a simplified schematic block diagram illustrating an embodiment of<br>
the video transport engine 14. Referring to FIG, 4, the video transport engine 14 includes a packet ID (PID) filter 30, a conditional access module 32, a transport stream processor 34 and an elementary stream pre-processor 36.<br>
[0018]	The PID filter 30 receives multiple data streams corresponding to different<br>
channels or programs. In one embodiment, a data stream is made up of packets. Each packet is 188x8 bits and has a packet ID. Where the size of a macro-block is relatively large, (e.g., exceeding the siz;e of a packet), a number of packets may make up a macro-block; where the size of a macro-block is relatively small, a packet may include multiple macro-blocks. The PID filter 30 reads the packet ID of each packet and provides the correct memory address in the off-chip memory 26 for that packet<br>
[0019]	The packets and their associated memory addresses are then forwarded to the<br>
conditional access module 32. The conditional access module 32 is able to receive and process packets from multiple data streams and controls access conditions with respect to the<br><br>
packets. For example, packets that are not to be processed due to certain access conditions are removed by the conditional access module 32.<br>
[0020]	Output from the conditional access module 32 is then forwarded to the<br>
transport stream processor 34. The transport stream processor 34 is able to handle and process packets belonging to different data streams. One of the functions of the transport stream processor 34 is to remove transport stream headers and other system information from the packets.<br>
[0021]	Output from the transport stream processor 34 is then provided to the<br>
elementary stream processor 36. The elementary stream preprocessor 36 is able to handle and process packets belonging to either a single data stream or multiple data streams. The elementary stream pre-processor 36 is further able to process packets or macro-blocks in parallel. One of the functions of the elementary stream pre-processor 36 is to identify all the headers in the packets including, for example, macro-block header, frame header and slice header, etc., before the packets are written onto the off-chip memory 26. By identifying these headers, multiple macro-blocks and/or slices can be processed at the same time by the decoder 18.<br>
[0022]	MPEG-2 video frames are generally organized in groups of PBB frames<br>
delimited by I-frames. There are two ways to decode the MPEG-2 video frames. One way to decode the MPEG-2 video frames is as follows. For an I-frame, since no reference frame is needed, the I-frame is processed by the decoder 18. The results generated by the decoder 18 include decoded data and associated information which includes information that can be subsequently used for decoding other frames. The decoded data and associated information are stored in the off-chip memory 26 and some or all of the associated information is stored in the on-chip memory 16 to allow easy access and expedite the decoding process. In other words, data stored in the on-chip memory 16 is used to facilitate decoding of other frames and data stored in the off-chip memory 26 is used subsequently for display purposes.<br>
[0023]	For a P-frame, a previous P-frame or an I-frame is needed as a reference<br>
frame. The on-chip memory 16 is checked to determine whether the information related to the associated reference frame is available. If such information is not available from the on-chip memory 16, it is retrieved from the off-chip memory 26. The retrieved information is then stored into the on-chip memory 16 for subsequent use. The P-frame is then processed by the decoder 18 using information related to the associated reference frame. Similarly, the<br><br>
results generated by the decoder 18 include decoded data and associated information for the P-frame. The decoded data and associated information for the P-frame are stored in the off-chip memory 26 and some or ail of the associated information related to the P-frame is also stored into the on-chip memory 16 for subsequent P- or B-frame decoding.<br>
[00241	After one or more I-frames and/or P-frames are processed, all associated B-<br>
frames are then processed by the decoder 18 using that the one or more I-frames and/or P-frames as references. As previously described, information related to the one or more I-frames and/or P-frames is stored in the on-chip memory 16 and such information is readily accessible to the decoder 18. The results are then written to the off-chip memory 26 for use in connection with future display.<br>
[0025]	After each group of PBB frames is processed, data for the next channel is<br>
retrieved from the off-chip memory 26 for processing (assuming that there is sufficient data for processing). The foregoing process is then repeated for all the channels.<br>
[0026]	A second way to decode the MPEG-2 video frames is to process a fixed<br>
number, 7z, of frames before a channel is switched, regardless of whether the last processed frame is an I-frame, a P-frame, or a B-frame. n could be 2, 3, 4 or any other integer. Before the decoding process begins, information related to a reference frame that has been previously stored is first retrieved from the off-chip memory 26 for the channel to be processed and loaded into the on-chip memory 16. The reference frame information is then subsequently used during the decoding process for decoding frames. Other associated reference frames are recovered using the retrieved reference frame, if necessary. The I-, P-, and B-frames are then processed the same way as described above. Before switching channel, a reference frame is chosen and stored in the off-chip memory 14 to be used as a reference point ne::t time the same channel is to be processed. By using the off-chip memory 26 to store infonnation related to the reference frames, data throughput of the processing module 12 is improved.<br>
[0027]	When video images are needed for display, the corresponding data is then<br>
retrieved from the off-chip memory 26 and passed to the analog encoder 24 for encoding in a format that is compatible with an analog display device. Output from the analog encoder 24 is then passed to a digital-to-analogy converter (not shown) for conversion to analog signals that are suitable for use with the analog display device.<br><br>
[0028]	FIG. 3 is a simplified schematic block diagram illustrating a second<br>
embodiment of the system in accordance with the present invention. In this embodiment, the data needed for subsequent display is forwarded to the analog encoder 24 for processing. Output from the analog encoder 24 is then stored in the off-chip memory 26. When video images are needed for display, the corresponding analog encoder output is retrieved from the off-chip memory 26 and passed to a digital-to-analogy converter (not shown) for conversion to analog signals that are suitable for use with an analog display device. In this embodiment, by storing output from the analog encoder 24 in the off-chip memory 26, memory throughput of the processing module 12 is improved.<br>
[0029]	As described above, the off-chip memory 26 can be used for various purposes<br>
including, for example, as a buffer for MPEG data streams and a buffer for processed frames.<br>
[0030]	In one exemplary application, the present invention is deployed in a set top<br>
box or signal gateway configured to receive signals from a cable head end. Based on the disclosure and teachings provided herein, a person of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate other ways and/or methods to deploy the present invention.<br>
[0031]	It should be understood that while the foregoing description is provided in<br>
terms of the MPEG standards, the present invention can similarly be applied to other video standards as well, such as, MPEG2, MPEG4, H.264 and Window Media, Based on the disclosure and teachings provided herein, a person of ordinary skill in the art will know of other ways and/or methods to apply the present invention.<br>
[0032]	It should also be understood that the present invention can be implemented<br>
using software, hardware or a combination of both. Based on the disclosure and teachings provided herein, a person of ordinary skill m the art will know of other ways and/or methods to implement the present invention.<br>
[0033]	It is understood that the examples and embodiments described herein are for<br>
illustrative purposes only and that various modifications or changes in light thereof will be suggested to persons skilled in the art and are to be included within the spirit and purview of this application and scope of the appended claims.
