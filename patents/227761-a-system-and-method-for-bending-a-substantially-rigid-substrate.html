				<td>A SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR BENDING<br>
A SUBSTANTIALLY RIGID SUBSTRATE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention in general relates to bending substantially rigid substrates<br>
for electronic control units and, more particularly, to a method and apparatus for<br>
bending a substrate through localized heating by different mechanisms.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Engine mounted electronic control units for vehicular engines are subject<br>
to a high level of heat and vibration and generally disposed in a confined space.<br>
In these applications, electronic components and circuits may be formed on a<br>
relatively thin substrate that is enclosed within a rigid housing. In order to<br>
enhance thermal performance protection against engine vibration, the thin<br>
substrate is affixed to a rigidizer that may be bent to produce a reduced size<br>
module and that also functions as a heat spreader.<br>
For example, one type of direct engine mount application uses a<br>
Polybent™ printed circuit board. This is a printed circuit board that has a flexible<br>
circuit board that is mounted to an aluminum rigidizer. The rigidizer provides<br>
mechanical support for the printed circuit board and assists in the dissipation of<br>
heat generated by components on the printed circuit board, which heat is<br>
conductively transferred from the components to the underlying rigidizer. One<br>
reference that describes an electronic control unit using a Polybent™ printed<br>
circuit board is U.S. Patent No. 5,998,738,<br><br>
which is owned by the assignees of the present invention and hereby incorporated by<br>
reference herein in its entirety.<br>
As the functionality of electronic control units has increased over time, the<br>
corresponding circuitry has become increasingly dense and complex. As a result,<br>
electronic control units have been migrating from the use of two-layer printed circuit<br>
boards to the use of four-layer printed circuit boards. One result of four-layer printed<br>
circuit boards is increased thickness. Thicker flexible circuit boards are known to<br>
crack or split when bent, resulting in a control unit that must be discarded. Discarded<br>
control units results in excessive manufacturing costs and waste, especially since the<br>
printed circuit board must be populated with components before being folded.<br>
Moreover, the type of material used for the substrate will affect the degree of<br>
flexibility of the board. For example, a material that is well known in the construction<br>
of circuit boards is a type of epoxy glass known as FR4. FR4 has a glass weave<br>
impregnated with epoxy resin and is generally known to be relatively stiff. Although<br>
FR4 and other more rigid substrates are substantially less expensive than very flexible<br>
substrates, the use of more rigid substrates presents the added problem of cracking<br>
and splitting when trying to bend the substrate to a confined space.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,292,370, owned by the assignees of the present invention<br>
and hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, describes that cracking and<br>
other damage may be avoided by heating the substrate to within about 10. C of the<br>
glass transition temperature of the FR4 material. The reference recites that this may<br>
be accomplished by passing the circuit substrate through an oven.<br>
A need exists, however, for improved devices and methods for increasing the<br>
flexibility of more rigid substrates to reduce splitting and cracking. For instance, a<br><br>
need exists to reduce the cost in the energy expended in passing the circuit<br>
substrate through an oven and to reduce the risk of damage to components on<br>
the substrate. There is also a need to reduce the time needed to heat up the<br>
substrate over the known method of passing the circuit substrate through an<br>
oven. It is, therefore, desirable to provide an improved device and method of<br>
heating a substrate to overcome most, if not all, of the preceding problems.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
What is described is a device and method for bending a circuit board through<br>
localized heating. For purposes of illustration, an example of the device and method<br>
will be described in the context of an electronic control unit for a vehicle. However,<br>
the present invention is not limited to units for vehicles but may also apply to other<br>
housings or devices where flexibility of a circuit board is needed.<br>
To this end, generally, in one embodiment there is a system for bending a<br>
substantially rigid substrate. The substantially rigid substrate has a first portion and a<br>
second portion interconnected by a bend region. The system comprises a first heated<br>
die member and a second heated die member. The first heated die member has a<br>
longitudinal body portion and an outer edge portion. The outer edge portion extends<br>
along the longitudinal body portion and is substantially rounded. The first heated die<br>
member is configured to contact a first side of the bend region of the substrate. The<br>
second heated die member has a longitudinal body portion and a groove. The groove<br><br>
extends along the longitudinal body portion. The second heated die member is<br>
configured to contact a second side of the bend region of the substrate. The first<br>
heated die member and the second heated die member are capable of bending the<br>
substrate in the bend region when the outer edge portion of the first heated die<br>
member slides into the groove of the second heated die member.<br>
The first portion of the substrate may be attached to a first rigidizer portion<br>
and the second portion of the substrate may be attached to a second rigidizer portion.<br>
The first heated die member may be attached to a transfer mechanism wherein the<br>
transfer mechanism has arms that holds the first rigidizer portion and the second<br>
rigidizer portion. The second heated die member may be attached to a workstation<br>
wherein the workstation includes at least a frame, a first surface, and a second surface.<br>
In this case, the first surface and the second surface may be slidably attached to the<br>
frame and the second heated die member positioned between the first surface and the<br>
second surface. Moreover, the first surface and the second surface may also be<br>
rotatably attached to a base.<br>
In another embodiment, there is a system for bending a substantially rigid<br>
substrate that has a first portion and a second portion interconnected by a bend region.<br>
The first portion of the substrate is attached to a first rigidizer portion and the second<br>
portion of the substrate is attached to a second rigidizer portion. The system<br>
comprises a first mechanism and a second mechanism. The first mechanism has a<br>
first die member. The first die member has a longitudinal body portionand an outer<br>
edge portion. The outer edge portion extends along the longitudinal body portion and<br>
is substantially rounded. The second mechanism has a second die member, a first<br>
surface, and a second surface. The second die member is positioned between the first<br><br>
surface and the second surface. The second die member has a longitudinal body<br>
portion and a groove. The groove extends along the longitudinal body portion of the<br>
second die member. The first die member and the second die member are capable of<br>
bending the substrate in the bend region when the outer edge portion of the first die<br>
member slides into the groove of the second die member.<br>
There is also a method for bending a substantially rigid substrate having a first<br>
portion and a second portion interconnected by a bend region. The method comprises<br>
the steps of: providing a first heated die member having a longitudinal body portion<br>
and an outer edge portion, the outer edge portion extending along the longitudinal<br>
body portion and being substantially rounded; contacting the first heated die member<br>
to a first side of the bend region of the substrate; providing a second heating die<br>
member having a longitudinal body portion and a groove, the groove extending along<br>
the longitudinal body portion; contacting the second heated die member to a second<br>
side of the bend region of the substrate; and sliding the outer edge portion of the first<br>
heated die member into the groove of the second heated die member such that at least<br>
a portion of the bend region of the substrate extends into groove of the second heated<br>
die member.<br>
The method may further comprise a step of waiting for a predetermined dwell<br>
time after the steps of contacting the first heated die member and the second heated<br>
die member to the substrate. The method may also comprise a step of sliding the first<br>
portion of the substrate and the second portion of the substrate toward the second<br>
heated die member during the step of sliding the first heated die member into the<br>
second heated die member. The method may further comprise a step of rotating the<br><br>
first portion of the substrate relative to the second portion of the substrate after the<br>
step of sliding the first heated die member into the second heated die member.<br>
There is also a method for assembling an electronic control unit comprising<br>
the steps of: providing a substantially rigid substrate having a first portion and a<br>
second portion interconnected by a bend region; attaching the first portion of the<br>
substrate to a first rigidizer portion; attaching the second portion of the substrate to a<br>
second rigidizer portion; providing a first heated die member having a longitudinal<br>
body portion and an outer edge portion, the outer edge portion extending along the<br>
longitudinal body portion and being substantially rounded; contacting the first heated<br>
die member to a first side of the bend region of the substrate; providing a second<br>
heated die member having a longitudinal body portion and a groove, the groove<br>
extending along the longitudinal body portion; contacting the second heated die<br>
member to a second side of the bend region of the substrate; sliding the outer edge<br>
portion of the first heated die member into the groove of the second heated die<br>
member such that at least a portion of the bend region of the substrate extends into the<br>
groove of the second heated die member, folding the first portion of the substrate<br>
relative to the second portion of the substrate to form at least one bend in the bend<br>
region; and attaching a sidewall rigidizer to the first rigidizer portion and the second<br>
rigidizer portion.<br>
Now, turning to the drawings, an example use of a device and method will be<br>
explained in the context of an electronic control unit for a vehicle. FIGS. 1 and 2<br>
show opposite sides of an example circuit board 20 that may reside within an<br>
electronic control unit. In one embodiment, generally, the circuit board 20 has a<br>
substantially rigid substrate 22, a first rigidizer portion 24, and a second rigidizer<br><br>
portion 26. The substantially rigid substrate 22 has a first portion 28 and a second<br>
portion 30 that is interconnected by a bend region 32. The substantially rigid<br>
substrate 22 may be made of FR4 or other more rigid organic based substrates. FR4<br>
is a material having at least one layer of glass weaves impregnated with epoxy resin.<br>
Other types of epoxy glass and polyimides are also commercially available. The<br>
substantially rigid substrate 22 may also be made of multiple layers of a substrate<br>
material laminated together that make the substrate more stiff or brittle. Although not<br>
critical to this invention, at least one of the rigidizer portions 24, 26 may have a<br>
plurality of holes 34 to fit a connector (not shown). In this embodiment, the first<br>
portion 28 of the substrate 22 is attached to the first rigidizer portion 24. The second<br>
portion 30 of the substrate 22 is attached to the second rigidizer portion 26.<br>
FIG. 2 shows the opposite side of the substrate 22. On the opposite side of the<br>
substrate 22, a plurality of conductive traces 36 are formed on, or within, the first<br>
portion 28 and second portion 30 of the substrate 22. The conductive traces 36<br>
interconnect a plurality of electronic components 38 mounted on the substrate 22. The<br>
electronic components 38 may be any electronic component or device that can be<br>
mounted to a printed circuit board such as, for example, a battery, a capacitor, a<br>
resistor, a semiconductor chip, a diode, an inductor, and a coil. The conductive traces<br>
36 are also electrically attached to the connector holes 34 for attachment to external<br>
connector pins (not shown). It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art,<br>
with the benefit of this disclosure, that the exact layout of the conductive traces 36<br>
and the number of components 38 is not critical, but that the present invention can be<br>
used for many types of electrical circuits without departing from the broad scope of<br>
the present invention.<br><br>
In the bend region 32 of the substrate 22, a series of connecting traces 40 are<br>
formed to interconnect the conductive traces 36 formed on the first portion 28 and<br>
second portion 30 of the substrate 22. Advantageously, the conductive traces 36 and<br>
the connecting traces 40 may, in one embodiment, be formed and covered with a rigid<br>
solder mask. That is, solder mask having an elongation of less than 10 percent.<br>
Typically, flexible circuits require the use of flexible solder mask, i.e. solder mask<br>
having an elongation of up to 30 percent to account for tensile stress introduced in<br>
flexing the circuit board. Flexible solder mask, however, is substantially more<br>
expensive than rigid solder mask.<br>
In one embodiment, the bend region 32 has a first side 42 (FIG. 1) and a<br>
second side 44 (FIG. 2). If the substrate 22 is made of FR4 material, the substrate 22<br>
will have at least one layer of glass weave impregnated with resin. On each side of<br>
the layer in the bend region, there should be a layer of epoxy. This epoxy layer may<br>
be resin-coated copper (RCC) that is commercially available with FR4 substrate<br>
material. Formed on, or within, the second side 44 of the bend region 32 are<br>
connecting traces 40. The connecting traces 40 may be electrically connected to the<br>
conductive traces 36 of the first portion 28 and the second portion 30 of the substrate<br>
22 by vias 46.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 3-6, an exemplary system for bending a circuit board<br>
20 is shown. FIG. 3 is a perspective view of a first mechanism 50 in accordance with<br>
an embodiment of the present invention: FIG. 4 is a perspective view of a first die<br>
member 60 of the first mechanism 50 in one embodiment. FIG. 5 is a perspective<br>
view of a second mechanism 70 in accordance with an embodiment of the present<br><br>
invention. FIG. 6 is a perspective view of a second die member 80 of the second<br>
mechanism 70 in one embodiment.<br>
As will be explained below, the first die member 60 and the second die<br>
member 80 will be used together to bend the substantially rigid substrate 22 in the<br>
bend region 32. The first mechanism 50 and the second mechanism 70 are further<br>
used to hold and assist in the bending of the substantially rigid substrate 22.<br>
Referring initially to FIG. 3, in one embodiment, there is a first mechanism 50<br>
having a first die member 60, a support frame 52, a plurality of arms 54, a first heater<br>
56, and a first temperature sensor 58. The first mechanism 50 may be configured to<br>
act as a pick and place machine for the transfer of circuit boards 20 from one<br>
workstation to another workstation. This is particularly beneficial in high volume<br>
production applications. The support frame 52 may be a variety of configurations but<br>
is used to support the first die member 60, the plurality of arms 54, and other<br>
components. The first die member 60 and the plurality arms 54 may be configured to<br>
move in relation to the support frame 52 and activated by electric servos or by<br>
pneumatic valves. The plurality of arms 54 may be used for holding and transferring<br>
the first rigidizer portion 24 and the second rigidizer portion 26 of the circuit board<br>
20.<br>
In one embodiment, referring to FIG. 4, the first die member 60 has a<br>
longitudinal body portion 62 and an outer edge portion 64. The outer edge portion 64<br>
may extend along the longitudinal body portion 62 and be substantially rounded. The<br>
first die member 60 is preferably a heated die member. To provide a heated die<br>
member, the first die member 60 may have an aperture 66 that extends along a<br>
substantial portion of its longitudinal body portion 62. The first heater 56 may be an<br><br>
electric heater that extends within the aperture 66 of the first die member 60. To<br>
provide control for heating the first die member 60, the first temperature sensor 58<br>
may also be inserted on, or within, the first die member 60. FIG. 4 shows another<br>
aperture 68 that extends along the longitudinal body portion 62 that is capable of<br>
receiving the first temperature sensor 58. The electrical output of the first temperature<br>
sensor 58 and the power to the first heater 56 may be connected to a controller (not<br>
shown) for close loop control of the temperature of the first die member 60. One of<br>
the substantial benefits of the present invention is that the heating process described<br>
herein is localized and the process may be automated and controlled.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, in one embodiment, there is a second mechanism 70<br>
having a second die member 80, a support frame 72, a first surface 74, a second<br>
surface 76, and a base 78. The second mechanism 70 may be configured to act as a<br>
workstation to hold circuit boards 20 received from the first mechanism 50. This is<br>
particularly beneficial in high volume production applications.<br>
The support frame 72 may be a variety of configurations but is used to support<br>
the first surface 74 and the second surface 76. In one embodiment, the support frame<br>
72 include linear slides 75. The linear slides 75 allow the first surface 74 and the<br>
second surface 76 to be slidably attached to the support frame 72. The second die<br>
member 80 may be positioned between the first surface 74 and the second surface 76.<br>
The first surface 74 and the second surface are capable of being attached to the circuit<br>
board 20.- The attachment may be accomplished by different methods but, in one<br>
embodiment, the circuit board 20 is pneumatically clamped on its sides at the first<br>
rigidizer portion 24 and the second rigidizer portion 26.<br><br>
The base 78 may be used to hold the support frame 72 and the second die<br>
member 80. In one embodiment, as shown in FIG. 5 and further explained below, the<br>
support frame 72 is rotatably attached to the base 78. In particular, the attachment<br>
allows the first surface 74 on the support frame 72 to be rotated relative to the second<br>
surface 76 on the support frame 72.<br>
In one embodiment, referring to FIG. 6, the second die member 80 has a<br>
longitudinal body portion 82 and a groove 84. The groove 84 may extend along the<br>
longitudinal body portion 82 and have a bottom surface that is substantially rounded.<br>
The second die member 80 is preferably a heated die member. To provide a heated<br>
die member, the second die member 80 may have an aperture 86 that extends along a<br>
substantial portion of its longitudinal body portion 82. The aperture 86 is configured<br>
to receive a second heater (not shown). The second heater may be an electric heater<br>
that extends within the aperture 86 of the second die member 80. To provide control<br>
for heating the second die member 80, a temperature sensor may also be inserted on,<br>
or within, the second die member 80. FIG. 6 shows another aperture 88 that extends<br>
along the longitudinal body portion 82 that is capable of receiving the temperature<br>
sensor. The electrical output of the temperature sensor and the power to the heater<br>
may be connected to a controller (not shown) that is capable of controlling the<br>
temperature of the second die member 80 to a desired temperature.<br>
FIGS. 7A-7D and FIG. 8 illustrate a suitable method for bending a circuit<br>
board 20 using the first mechanism 50 and the second mechanism 70 as described<br>
above. FIGS. 7A-D are graphic representations of the bending of the circuit board 20<br>
during various stages of the manufacturing process. FIG. 8 is a process flow diagram<br><br>
the further illustrates how the bending of the circuit board 20 may fit into the<br>
manufacture of an electronic control unit.<br>
For purposes of illustration, the method for bending a circuit board 20 will be<br>
described in the context of an electronic control unit for a vehicle. In block 102, the<br>
process includes providing a substantially rigid substrate 22 having a first portion 28<br>
and a second portion 30 interconnected by a bend region 32. There is also provided a<br>
first rigidizer portion 24 and a second rigidizer portion 26.<br>
In block 104, the process includes attaching the first portion 28 of the substrate<br>
22 to the first rigidizer portion 24 and attaching the second portion 30 of the substrate<br>
22 to the Second rigidizer portion 26. In one embodiment, the attachment may be<br>
secured by an adhesive such as a pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA) tape or film. In<br>
another embodiment, the adhesive may be a heat curable, liquid adhesive that is<br>
screen printed on the first rigidizer portion 24 and the second rigidizer portion 26.<br>
Those who are of ordinary skill in the art, having the benefit of this disclosure, will<br>
realize that there are many techniques for securing the substrate to the rigidizer, such<br>
as mechanical fasteners like screws or other adhesive laminates that may be placed on<br>
the rigidizer, that may be used herein without departing from the broad scope of the<br>
present invention.<br>
In block 106, the process also includes providing a first heated die member 60<br>
and a second heated die member 80. The first heated die member 60 and the second<br>
heated die member 80 is preferably made of a material that conducts and retains heat<br>
such as aluminum. The first heated die member 60 has a longitudinal body portion 62<br>
and an outer edge portion 64. The outer edge portion 64 extends along the<br>
longitudinal body portion 62 and is substantially rounded. The second heated die<br><br>
member 80 as a longitudinal body portion 82 and a groove 84. The groove 84 extends<br>
along the longitudinal body portion 82. This is further shown in FIG. 7A.<br>
In block 108, the process further includes contacting the first heated die<br>
member 60 to a first side 42 of the bend region 32 of the substrate 22 and contacting<br>
the second heated die member 80 to a second side 44 of the bend region 32. This is<br>
further shown in FIG. 7B. At this point, as indicated in block 110, the process may<br>
further include waiting a first time period. The first time period should represent a<br>
predetermined dwell time. In one application for FR4 material, a suitable dwell time<br>
was selected to be around 10 seconds.<br>
In block 112, the process includes sliding the outer edge portion 64 of the first<br>
heated die member 60 into the groove 84 of the second heated die member 80 such<br>
that at least a portion of the bend region 32 of the substrate 22 extends into the groove<br>
84 of the second heated die member 80. This is further illustrated in FIG. 7C. During<br>
this step, as indicated in block 114, it is preferred that the first portion 28 of the<br>
substrate 22 and the second portion 30 of the substrate 22 slide toward the second<br>
heated die member 80, also illustrated in FIG. 7C. At this point, as indicated in block<br>
116, the process may further include waiting a second time period. The second time<br>
period should represent a further predetermined dwell time to form the bend. In one<br>
application for FR4 material, a suitable second dwell time was selected to be around<br>
10 seconds.<br>
Thereafter, in block 118, the method may further comprise of the step of<br>
rotating the first portion 28 of the substrate 22 relative to the second portion 30 of the<br>
substrate 22. Although the degree of rotation may be implementation specific, in one<br>
embodiment for FR4 material in forming a W-shaped bend, each of the first portion<br><br>
28 and the second portion 30 were rotated about 45 degrees. This is illustrated in<br>
FIG. 7D. In block 120, the process may then include a step of sliding the outer edge<br>
portion 64 of the first heated die member 60 out of the groove 84 of the second heated<br>
die member 80.<br>
In block 122, the process may also include folding the first portion 28 of the<br>
substrate 22 relative to the second portion 30 of the substrate 22 to form at least one<br>
bend in the bend region 32. Additionally, in block 124, the process of making an<br>
electronic control unit may further include attaching a sidewall rigidizer portion to the<br>
first rigidizer portion 24 and the second rigidizer portion 26. These steps are further<br>
illustrated and discussed below in relation to FIGS. 9-10.<br>
FIG. 9 shows an exploded perspective view of an electronic control unit 90.<br>
The rigidizer portions 24, 26 described above are designed to shield the substrate 22<br>
and electronic components 38 from electrical charge that can damage the substrate<br>
and components. The rigidizer portions 24,26 are used in connection with a sidewall<br>
portion 92, 94 to further interconnect the first rigidizer portion 24 and the second<br>
rigidizer portion 26. The sidewall portion 92, 94 may be attached to the first rigidizer<br>
portion 24 and the second rigidizer portion 26 by a solder or weld. The attachment<br>
may also be secured through mechanical fasteners such as screws or an adhesive. The<br>
rigidizer portions may also provide mechanical support and conductively dissipate<br>
heat for the substrate 22.<br>
Preferably, the rigidizer portions 24,26, 92,94 are manufactured from<br>
materials that are rigid enough to provide a rigid mechanical support for the substrate<br>
22. In automobile applications, the rigidizer portions 24,26, 92, 94 should also be<br>
designed to shield the electronic components 38 from heat, water, chemicals, and<br><br>
electrostatic charge.' Suitable materials for the rigidizer portions are aluminum, steel,<br>
engineering grade plastic, magnesium, and zinc or any material that is resistant to<br>
chemicals and elements commonly found in an automobile. Preferably, the rigidizer<br>
portions are further manufactured from thermally conductive materials and<br>
conductively transfers heat by components 38 during operation of the electronic<br>
control unit 90. However, those of ordinary skill in the art will realize that electronic<br>
control unit 90 may be used in low power operations where thermal issues, and the<br>
thermal conductivity of rigidizer may be of minor importance.<br>
Referring to FIG. 10, as explained above, substrate 22 is preferably made from<br>
a relatively rigid material such as FR4 or a multi-layer polyimide material. The first<br>
die member 60 and the second die member 80 described above are used at the bend<br>
region 32 of the substrate 22. This will allow the first portion 28 of the substrate 22 to<br>
be folded relative to the second portion 30 of the substrate 22.<br>
It will be appreciated that the present invention provides the significant<br>
advantage of locally heating the bend region 32 of the substrate 22. It limits the<br>
heating to only the part of the substrate that needs to be bent. It uses a first die<br>
member 60 and a second die member 80 that requires reduced amounts of energy to<br>
heat the bend region 32, thereby reducing manufacturing costs. Additionally, the time<br>
constant for heating is very short compared to baking the entire board in an oven.<br>
Little soak time is needed to heat the bend region 32 because the thermal mass is<br>
much smaller.<br>
It also has been found by the inventor that localized heating permits bending at<br>
a much lower temperature than that required in previous methods. For instance, an<br>
FR4 material may have a glass transition temperature of about 150"C. It has been<br><br>
known to heat the entire board in an oven to within 10°C of the glass transition prior<br>
to bending the substrate. However, it has been found, through the present invention,<br>
that a local heating of bend region 32 of FR4 material would permit suitable bending<br>
at temperatures of 120°C. Accordingly, less energy is used to permit bending of the<br>
substrate 22. In fact, in tests, it has been discovered that heating of the substrate 22<br>
may not even be required depending on the application and the desired result on<br>
manufacturing yields.<br>
After using the first die member 60 and the second die member 80, and the<br>
substrate 22 is folded at the bend region 32, the actual bend formed at the bend region<br>
32 may take a variety of shapes. For example, in FIGS. 9 and 10, there is a bend that<br>
is in a W-shape. The W-shape permits very compact folding that can be of particular<br>
importance for automotive and other industrial applications.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 11 and 12, another type of bend is shown in the bend<br>
region 32 of the substrate 22. FIG. 11 is an exploded perspective view of an<br>
electronic control unit 190 in accordance with another embodiment of the present<br>
invention. FIG. 12 is a side view of a portion of the electronic control unit 190. The<br>
electronic control unit 190 has a substrate 22, a first rigidizer portion 24 and a second<br>
rigidizer portion 26. Here, however, the sidewall rigidizer portion 194 has a<br>
depression 196. If the rigidizer is made of sheet aluminum, the depression 196 may<br>
be formed in the sidewall rigidizer portion 194 by a stamping process.<br>
The presence of the depression 196 permits the bend in the bend region 32 of<br>
the substrate 22 to be U-shaped. The depression 196 is used for housing at least a<br>
portion of the bend in the bend region 32 of the substrate 22. This U-shape also<br>
permits very compact folding that can be of particular importance for automotive and<br><br>
other industrial applications. The U-shape bend may be formed during the assembly<br>
process by flipping the circuit board 20 on its opposite side and going through steps<br>
similar to that shown in FIGS. 7A-7C. In the step shown in FIG. 7D, instead of<br>
rotating the ends of the circuit board 20 downward, the ends of the circuit board 20<br>
should be rotated upward to form the U-shaped bend. The bend region 32 of the<br>
substrate 22 need not be physically attached to the sidewall rigidizer portion 194 or<br>
the depression 196. When the first portion 28 of the substrate 22 is folded relative to<br>
the second portion 30 of the substrate 22, this will form the U-shape bend as shown in<br>
FIGS. 11 and 12.<br>
What has been described is a device and method for increasing the flexibility<br>
of a circuit board through localized heating. The device and method permits<br>
relatively small radii bends so that the circuit board may be more compactly folded<br>
than what could otherwise be accomplished using FR4 or similar relatively brittle<br>
materials. The alternative is to use single layer polyimide or similar flexible materials<br>
at a substantial cost penalty. The present invention also permits localized heating of<br>
only the area that requires the bend. This reduces the amount of energy needed for<br>
assembly costs that can be of particular interest in high volume production.<br>
The above description of the present invention is intended to be exemplary<br>
only and is not intended to limit the scope of any patent issuing from this application.<br>
For example, the present discussion used an electronic control unit to illustrate the<br>
device and method of the present invention. The present invention is also applicable<br>
to other applications that use flexible circuits that need to be confined to a small area.<br>
The present invention is intended to be limited only by the broad scope of the<br>
following claims.<br>
