				<td>This invention in general relates to Textile Machinery and accessories and in particular relates to an instrument intended to quantify length related parameter of Cotton Fibre.<br>
Quality of Cotton plays an important role in ensuring quality of yarn and eventually the fabric itseE Ascertaining the quality of cotton and property classifying it, are of primary importance. Farmers, Ginners, Merchants, Spinners and Researchers in allied areas require all such quality related information to be made available to them.<br>
Cotton fibre being natural product it has different properties. -   fibre length<br>
-	fibre length uniformity<br>
-	fibre strength<br>
-	fibre fineness (Micronaire)<br>
-	fibre colour<br>
are the characteristics which determines the ultimate use of the particular variety of cotton.<br>
Of these, fibre length, fibre length uniformity are prime quality factors.<br>
Various methods are available and classify this property, staple diagrams and fibrogram are the two important way of indicating.<br>
It is more or less standard to use fibrogram these days, because the methodology of obtaining it is more efficient and fast.<br>
Instruments are available to carry out the tests and obtain the above parameters especially the length-related parameters. However, these are bulky, costly and not easily accessible to customers dispersed in the country.<br>
There is a clear need for a low cost instrument to quantify the length-related parameters. The present invention refers to such an instrument.<br>
the primary object of the invention is to invent a method and Instrument to measure and monitor and to quantify the length related parameter.<br>
It is another object of the invention to invent an instrument which will display values of parameters to do initial calibrations and self diagnostics.<br>
It is another object of the invention to invent an instrument which is highly accurate and almost error free.<br>
It is another object of the invention to contrive an instrument which is handy, easily accessible and relatively cheap.<br>
Takerrafl the objects of the invention into consideration, the present invention comprises a fibre beard with associated sensor system, the said instrument having<br><br>
H chamber containing a slot and a clamp, for insertion of beard and keeping it in position, a uniform light source having a finely defined L.E.D. array with Optical Filter in front. A detector at the other end to receive whole of the rays falling on the detector meaner converting the analogs of the signal obtained in the detector to digital form and a MicroÂ¬computer to process the Signal to give the required information and a ball-screw with a servo motor guide actuator arrangement for diving the beard from one end to the other end in a steady manner.<br>
The invention will now be described in detail, with reference to drawings accompanying the specifications wherein<br>
Fig. 1 which shows in elevation the exploded view of beard with associated sensor.<br>
Fig.2 shows in isometric view guide actuator.<br>
Fig. 3 shows in block diagram and schematic diagram of the instrument.<br>
The fibre to be tested is to be conditioned if necessary and then prepared in the form of a beard. The beard is inserted in the equipment in the slot provided for the purpose. It is clamped in position.<br>
The instrument has a chamber to hold the said beard and to keep it clamped in the defined position. A finery defined linear LED array with an optical filter in front forms a uniform tight source. It is in the form of a narrow beam whose width covers that of the board. In the normal working position the beard is held above the beam. That Part of the beam which pierces through the beard is received by a detector.<br>
Close the clamp of the Beard al the fibres are present. When the led array and the detector combine is close to this, maximum radiation blockage take place. The amount of radiation emanating through the beard and falling on the detector is minimum. As the Beard is withdrawn, the shorter fibre ends go out first and to that extent the radiation falling on the detector increases. As the Beard movement continues, the number of fibres interrupting the radiation reduces, in turn increasing the amount of radiation falling on the detector. Thus in any position of the Beard, the total radiation falling on the detector is an indirect measure of the number of fibres at the corresponding point of the Beard. Carrying out this exercise from one end of the Beard to the other, one can get the nature of variation of radiation received on the detector and from that derive the nature of length variations.<br>
The analog signal is converted into equivalent digital form. A Micro-Computer is built into the instrument. It processes the digital signal and extracts all the information related to the length.<br>
A ball screw and servomotor arrangement (Collectively called Guide Actuator) (FIG.2) can drive the beard from one end to the other in a steady manner. At each position the detector output is measured, sampled and processed. In this manner length number of fibres of each length relationship is obtained. After completion of measurement, all the necessary information related to the length and its distribution is extracted.<br><br>
The technology for the linear motion system, which has been perfected has led to the creation of this actuator system of an ultimate configuration. The Guide of linear motion and the driving ball screw are integrated so as to respond to demands for space-saving; high rigidity and high accuracy.<br>
The system comprises 5 main parts, namely,<br>
1.	Inner Bloc; Either Short or Long type.<br>
2.	Screw Lead: 6,10 and 20.<br>
3.	Motor Bracket.<br>
4.	Cover<br>
5.	Sensor Rail<br>
The inner block forms the platform on which the Beard is supported and moved in a precisely controlled manner. The Block is supported and guided between the guides on the outer rails. The leadscrew passing through the inner block brings about its positioning and motion as desired. The leadscrew is coupled to the motor so that the motor position and motion are reflected on the corresponding position and motion of inner block and the beard. The relative position of the inner block is sensed by the sensor rail.<br>
In figure 3 it is shown a ball screw and beard fix is held between a sensor and a detector and sensed values are converted into a digital signals and compared with standard information stored in the Micro-Computer and the said information which displayed in the monitor as and when the information is call for.<br>
The Ball screw in Fig.2 is attached to the Beard. The Ballscrew is driven by the servomotor. The supply to the servomotor is provided by the motor controller. The motor controller gives out precisely timed and co-ordinated sequences of pulses to the motor. By controlling the number and the sequence of pulses from the motor controller, one can control the final shaft position of the Ballscrew.<br>
The motor controller is under the command of the Micro-computer. The digital Signal processor processes the data received and complements the role of the Microcomputer. The display provides outputs in desired formats, during setting, programming, testing as well as after the test The keyboard is to feed commands and parameters to the instrument.<br>
1.	The instrument has the provision of a precise actuator (FIG.2) with no backlash, comprising of a ballscrew assembly. This is driven by a servomotor. The whole combination provides preciseh/ positioned motion for the beard (of cotton) enabling measurement o the fibre at very closely and precisely defined intervals.<br>
2.	The linear optical source is built up of a series of well matched LEDs and a filter in front. The LED matching is in terms of their individual intensities, intensity distribution and uniformly spaced distribution. The filter ensures a more homogenous distribution of the beams and at the same time eliminates radiation in all the neighbouring beards. This in turn minimizes error due to any ambient light and other radiation effects.<br><br>
Suitable focusing of the radiation coming through the beard ensures that all the radiation coming through is collected and accounted for.<br>
Graded movement of the beard assembly and linking of the same to the radiation seeping through the beard.<br>
Based on the Data obtained from photo-detector, processing its distribution and translating the same into the corresponding length related information.<br>
Extracting the information regarding<br>
2.5% Span length<br>
50% Span length<br>
Short fibre index is one of the salient features of the invention.<br>
Calibration procedure whereby the signal output is made independent of the number of fibres held or variations in it. A metal or other opaque strip of suitable length is used in place of the beard to decide a fixed reference level and the readings with the beard are normalized with respect to this reference level.<br><br><br>
We Claim,<br>
1.   An instrument intended to quantify length related parameter of Cotton or similar Fibre, comprising a beard with associated sensor system, the said instrument having a chamber containing a slot and a clamp, for insertion of beard and keeping it in a position, a uniform light source having a finely defined LED array  with Optical Filter in front, a detector at the other end to receive whole of the rays falling on the detector, meant for converting the analogs of the Signal obtained in   \ the detector to digital form and a Microcomputer to process the Signal to give the required information and a ballscrew with a servomotor arrangement for driving the beard from one end to the other end in a steady manner.<br><br></td>
