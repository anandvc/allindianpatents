This   invention  concerns   a   device   for  mixing  particu¬late  material   and   liquid,   for  instance   for  mixing  water and   absorbent  material   which  is   reactive  with  gaseous pollutants   in   flue  gases   and  which,   during  cleaning   of the  flue  gases,   is  to  be  introduced  into  these  gases   in moistened  state  in  order  to  convert  the  gaseous  pollu¬tants   to  separable  dust,   said  device  comprising   a  con¬tainer    an   inlet   for  the   introduction  of  particulate material   into  the  container,   a  spraying  means   for   spray¬ing  liquid  over  the  particulate  material   in  the  con¬tainer    an  agitator  arranged   in   the  container,   and   an outlet   for  discharging  material  mixed  with  liquid  from the  container.<br>
When  gaseous  pollutants,   such  as  sulphur  dioxide, are  to  be  separated  from  flue  gases,   the  gases   are  con¬ducted  through  a  contact  reactor  in  which  particulate absorbent  material  reactive  with  the  gaseous  pollutants is,   in  moistened  state,   introduced  into  the   flue  gases in  order  to  convert  the  gaseous  pollutants  to  separable dust.   The   flue  gases  are  then  conducted  through  a  dust separator,   in  which  dust  is  separated   from  the  flue  gases and   from  which  the  thus-cleaned   flue  gases   are  drawn  off. Part  of  the  dust  separated  in  the  dust   separator  is   con¬ducted  to   a  mixer,   where   it   is  mixed  and  moistened  with water,   whereupon  it   is   recycled   as   absorbent  material   by being   introduced   into   the   flue  gases   along  with  an  addi¬tion  of   fresh  absorbent.   As   fresh  absorbent,   use   is  gene¬rally  made  of   slaked  lime   (calcium  hydroxide).<br>
Devices   of   the  type  mentioned  by  way  of   introduction are  used  as  mixers   in  order  to  perform  the  above  mixing operation  involving  absorbent  material   and  water.    In these  prior-art  devices,   the  agitator  consists  of  one  or more   shafts,   on  which  are  mounted   agitating  means   in  the form  of  helical   flanges,   blades,   paddles  or  the  like. However,   these prior-art  devices   are  not  always  capable<br><br>
of  producing  a  homogeneous  mixture  in  which  the  water  is evenly  distributed  in  the  particulate  material.   As   a result,   moist   lumps  of  material  may  form,   especially  when the  particulate  material  contains  a  large  proportion  of hydrophobic  particles,   as   is   the  case  with   fly  ash.<br>
In  order  that   the   flue   gases   should  be   efficiently cleaned,   it  is,   of  course,   essential  that   the  absorbent material   is   supplied  to  the   flue  gases   in  the   form  of  a homogeneous  mixture  in  which  the  moisture  is   evenly  dis¬tributed.<br>
A  special   object   of   this   invention   is,   therefore,   to provide  a  device  which  is  especially  adapted   to  be  used for  mixing  absorbent  material   and  water  in  the  flue-gas-cleaning  method  described  above  and  which  then  results   in a  homogeneous  mixture.<br>
A  more  general  object  of  the  invention  is  to  pro¬vide  a  device  which  not  only  results   in  a  homogeneous mixture  of  particulate  material   and  liquid,   but  which also   has   a   lower  energy  consumption  than  equivalent prior-art  devices.<br>
According  to  the  invention,   these  objects   are achieved  by  a  device  which  is  of  the  type  mentioned  by way  of   introduction  and  which  is   characterised   in  that there   is   provided  a   fluidization  means   adapted   to   fluidise  the  particulate  material   in  the  container   during   the mixing  operation.<br>
In  a  preferred  embodiment,   the  container   has   an upper  bottom  and  a   lower  bottom,   which  between  them define  a  chamber  and  of  which  the  upper  bottom  is  air-permeable,   and   there   is   provided  an   air-supply  means adapted  to  supply  air  to  the  chamber  with  a  view  to fluidising  the  particulate  material   in  the  container.<br>
Preferably,   the  agitator  consists  of  at   least  one rotary  shaft  which  extends  along  the  container  and  on which  a  plurality  of  discs,   through  the  centres   of  which extends  the  shaft,   are  mounted  in  inclined  state  at  an axial  distance  from  one  another.   Conveniently,   these<br><br>
discs have an elliptic shape and are, about their minor axes, so inclined in relation to the shaft as to have a circular axial projection. In a preferred embodiment, the discs are inclined at an angle of 45-80", preferably about<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a device for mixing particulate material and Quid comprising; a container, an inlet through which gas containing particulate material is introduced into the container, a sprayer for spraying liquid over the particulate material in the container; an agitator arranged in the container, an outlet for discharging material mixed with liquid from the container and a fluidization arrangement for fluidizing the particulate material in the container.<br><br>
The   invention  will   now   be  described   in  more  detail v/ith   reference   to   the   accompanying   driving,    in  which<br>
Fig.    1   is   a   side  view  which   schematically   illu¬strates   a   device   according   to   the   invention,   but   in which  certain  parts   of   the   device   have   been   broken    <br>
Fig.   2   is   a   top  view  of   the   device   in   Fig.    1;   and<br>
Fig.   3   is   a   cross-section   taken   along   line   III-III in   Fig.    2.<br>
The   mixing   device   illustrated   comprises   a   contai¬ner   1,   which  essentially   is   in   the   shape   of   an  elongate, parallelepidal   box.   The  container   1   has   vertical   side walls   2   and   3,    a   vertical   rear   end       4,    a   vertical front   end   wall   5,   a   horizontal   upper   bottom   5,    a   hori¬zontal   lower   bottom   7   and   a   horizontal   top  or   lid   8.<br>
At   the   rear   end,    rhea   container   1   has   an-  inlet   9, through   which  particulate   material   is   supplied   from   above (the   arrow   PI   in   Fig.    1).   At   the   front   end,   the   container 1   has   an   outlet   10,    through  which   is   discharged   a   homo¬geneous   mixture   of   particulate  material   and   water   (the arrives   P2   in  Figs   2   and  3 ) .<br>
In   the   example   shown   the  drawing,    the   front   end   of the   container   1   is   inserted   in   a   vertical   flue-gas channel   11   through  which   flue  gases   containing   gaseous pollutants,   such  as   sulphur  dioxide,   are  conducted upwards   {the  arrows  P3   in  Figs   1   and  3)   in  order   to  be cleaned   in  known   fashion.   In  this  application,   the  outlet 10   is   an  overflow   formed   as   a  •  exult   of   the   side   walls   2 and  3   being   lower  in  the  container  part   inserted   in  the channel   11   than   in   the  container   part   located   outside the   channel   11.   As   appears   from   Figs   1   and   2,    the   top. 8 extends   from  the  inlet   9   to  the  outlet   10,   i.e.   up  to  the flue-gas  channel   11.<br><br>
Between  them,   the  two  bottoms   6   and   7  define  a  cham¬ber  12  which,   in  the  lateral  direction,   is  delimited  by the  two  side  walls  2   and  3  and,   in  the  longitudinal direction,   is  delimited  by  the  two  end  walls   4   and   5.   The ceiling  of   the  chamber   12,   i.e.   the  upper  bottom   6,   con¬sists   of   an  air-permeable   fluidisation  cloth  of   polyester mounted   in  stretched  state  in  the  container  1.   An  air-supply  means,   which  here  consists   of   two   air   inlets   13 and   14,    is   arranged  to   supply  air  to  the  chamber   12   (the arrows   P4   in  Figs   1   and   2),   so   as   to   fluidise   the  parti¬culate  material   in  the  container   1.<br>
A  water-supply  line   15,   which   is   disposed   above  the container   1,   is  connected  to   a  plurality  of  nozzles   16 arranged  in  the  upper  part  of  the  container  1   to   spray water   in   finely-divided   form  over  the  particulate  mate¬rial   in  the  container.   The  nozzles   16,   of  which  but   a   few are  shown  in  the  drawing,   are  arranged  in  two  parallel rows   extending  along  the  container   1.<br>
Two  juxtaposed,   horizontal   shafts   17,   17'   extend along  the  entire  container  1   and  are  rotatably  mounted in  the  two  end  walls  4  and  5  with  the  aid  of  bearings   18, 18'   and  19,   19',   respectively.   A  motor  20   is  arranged  to rotate   the   shafts   17,    17'   via   a   transmission  unit   21.<br>
Each  shaft   17,   17'   supports   a  plurality  of  elliptic discs   22,   22'   which,   about   their  minor   axes,   are  mounted in   inclined   state  on  the  shaft   17,    17'   at   an  axial   dis¬tance   from  one  another.   The  shafts   17,   17'   extend  through the  centres  of  the  respective  discs   22,   22'.   In  the  exam¬ple  illustrated,   each  disc  22,   22'   is   so  inclined  in relation  to  the  shaft   17,   17'   that  the  angle  a  between the  major  axis  of  the  disc  and  the  shaft   17,   17'   is   about 60°   (see  Fig.   1).   This  angle  a  may  vary  between  45°   and 80°.   The   discs   22,   22'    are   so   inclined   in  relation  to  the respective   shafts   17,    17'   and  have  such  an  elliptic   shape as   to   have  a   circular  axial  projection,   as   illustrated in  Fig.   3.   The  discs   22,   22'   are   so  positioned  on  the respective   shafts   17,    17'   that   the  discs   of   the  one   shaft<br><br>
project   into  the  spaces  between  the  discs  of  the  other shaft.<br>
Each  of  the  discs  22,   22'   arranged  and  designed  in the  manner  indicated  above  performs,   during  the  rotation of   the   shafts   17,    17',   a   throwing  movement  conducive   to thorough  mixing  of  particulate  material.<br>
The   flue-gas   channel   11   illustrated   forms   part   of   a system   for   cleaning   flue   gases   containing   gaseous   pollu¬tants,   such  as   sulphur  dioxide.   The   flue   gases   (P3)   are passed  through  the   flue-gas   channel   11,   in  which  particu¬late  absorbent  material  reactive  with  the  gaseous  pollu¬tants   is,   in  moistened   state,   introduced   into   the   flue gases  in  order  to  convert  the  gaseous  pollutants   to  sepa¬rable  dust.   The  flue  gases  are  then  passed  through  a  dust separator   (not   shown),   in  which  dust  is   separated   from the   flue  gases  and  from  which  the  thus-cleaned  flue  gases are  discharged  into  the  surrounding  atmosphere.   Part  of the  dust   separated  in  the  dust  separator  is,   along  with an  addition  of   fresh  absorbent,   e.g.   in  the   form  of particles  of  burnt   lime,   supplied  as  particulate  material (PI)   to  the   inlet   9  of  the  container  1,   so  as   to  be,   in the  container,   mixed  with  water  sprayed  over  the  particu¬late  material   in  the  container  through  the  nozzles   16. The  particulate  material   in  the  container   1   is  maintained in   fluidised   state  by  means  of   air   (P4)   which,   via   the air   inlets   13   and   14,   the  chamber   12   and   the   fluidisation cloth   6,    is   introduced   into  the  container.   As   a   result  of this   fluidisation  as  well   as   the  rotation  of   the   shafts 17,   17',   one  obtains  a  homogeneously  moistened,   homoge¬neous   mixture  of   the  particulate  material,    this  mixture being,   via  the  overflow  10,   supplied  to  the  flue-gas channel   11   as  absorbent  material   (P2).<br>
By  a  partition  23   in  the   front   part  of   the  container 1,    the  chamber   12   is   divided   into   a   front   part   chamber 12a,   which  is   situated   in  the   flue-gas   channel   11,   and a  rear  part  chamber  12b.   As  appears   from  Fig.   1,   the  air inlet   13   opens  into  the  rear  part  chamber   12b,   while  the<br><br>
air inlet 14 opens into the front part chamber 12a. With this division of the chamber 12, it is possible to achieve different fluidisation conditions in the two part chambers 12a and 12b, especially with a view to so adapt¬ing the air supply to the front part chamber 12a that one there obtains a suitable fluidisation state for the mate¬rial  discharge.<br>
In  a  test  aiming  to  illuminate  the  effect  of  the fluidisation  on  the  power  consumption,   the  container  1 was   filled  with  particulate  material.   In  this   test,   the container   1   had  a  volume  of   0.3   m\   The   shafts   17,    17' were  rotated  at  a  speed  of  200  rpm.   The  flow  rate  of  par¬ticulate  material  passing  through  the  container  was 8   m /h,   and   the   flow  rate  of   the  water  was   240   1/h.    In the  fluidisation  of  the  particulate  material,   the  power consumption,   including  the  power  consumption  of   the supply  of   fluidisation  air   (0.08  m  /s),   was   found  to  be 2.2  kw.   With  no   fluidisation  but  otherwise  under  the  same conditions,   the  power  consumption  was   3   kW.<br>
In  the  illustrated  mixing  device  described  above, the   front   end  of   the  container   1   is   inserted   in  a  channel 11.   However,    the  mixing  device  may  also  be  used   for  dis¬charging   a  homogeneously  moistened,   homogeneous   mixture of   particulate  material   into   two   separate   channels,   in which  case  the   front  end  of  the  container   1   extends   into these   two  channels   in   such  a  manner   that   the  mixture   is discharged   into   the  one  channel   via   the  overflow   10   in the  side  wall  2   and  discharged  into  the  other  channel  via the  overflow  10   in  the  side  wall   3.   The  relationship between  the   flows  of  material  to  the  two  channels  may  be set  by  choosing  suitable  levels   for  the  overflow  10  at the  respective  sides,   i.e.   by  a  suitable  choice  of  height for  the  respective  side  walls  2,   3   in  the  container  part inserted   in  the   channels.<br><br>
