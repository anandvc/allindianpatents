				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of tiles/bricks useful for building construction. The tiles/bricks prepared by the process of the present invention are useful for building construction, Daneling on the walls, and also for decorative architecture in view of the black colour.<br>
Leather processing is one of the major industrial activity in India and many other countries of the world. Annual export realization for the leather sector at the moment is above 1.3 billion US$. There are about 1000 small scale and 75 medium scale tanneries in India. There are a variety of waste products coming out of the tannery which includes solution and solid forms. However, the solid wastes come to about 150,000 tonnes per year in India which is usually named as tannery sludge. The industry finds it very difficult to store them or to dispose them in bulk in any appropriate way.<br>
Another major factor which calls for concern in this industry is the use of<br>
chromium in tanning. Approximately 38,000 tonnes of basic chromium sulphate<br>
equivalent to 6500 tonnes of chromium is used by the industry in India every<br>
year. Assuming a reasonable estimate of 60% of chromium being absorbed in<br>
leather, about 2600 tonnes of chromium is emitted via waste water and tannery<br>
sludge	every	year.	A typical Indian tannery sludge contains<br>
approxdimately 2-3% chromium and therefore the industry should be     producing 125,000 tonnes      of     chrome       bearing       sludge     every<br>
vear and most often this exceeds 6-7%. The Indian Pollution Control and Environmental Regulations demand that chrome content in industrial waste stream should be less than 0.2-3.0 ppm. The generally accepted environmental rules restrict the chrome content   to   be   less   than   50   ppm.<br>
Various options for effective disposal of the tannery sludge have been looked at earlier. The sludge can be filled in low lying areas after spreading on polyethylene sheets (land fill). Attempts to use sludge as fuel have also been made earlier, but the combustibility is poor. Further the nauseating smell of burning protein has restricted this attempt. Hence most of the attempts for the disposal of the sludge in bulk have met with less success. One of the earlier studies reported on the utilisation of tannery sludge is to use it as additive to clays for making bricks. An attempt in this direction by Italian researchers appears to have failed, due to the fact that the chromium   in   the   fired  bricks  were   easily   leachable.<br>
A feasible way of fixing chromium and chromium containing mineral tailings is by incorporating in high temperature refractories where the temperatures are above 1400°C. The chromium reacts with silica and iron to form high temperature compounds and become immobilised. However, since tannery sludge contains considerable organics and other impurities such as calcium and sodium, such applications are not feasible. Further the high temperature ceramics which ought to be high density bodies,   will   end  up   in   porous   ones.<br>
In    the    attempt    to    understand    the    behaviour    of    the leachability    of    chromium    in    tannery     sludge,     a    detailed<br>
information   on   the   chromium   chemistry   becomes    important.    The common    form   of    chromium    in    chrome    sludge    is    expected    to    be chromic   hydroxide   in   some  polymerised   form.   The   chromic   hydroxide on   thermal   treatment   gets   converted   to   chrome'  (III)    sesquioxide and  chrome   (VI)   trioxide.   The   former   is   leachable   and  the   latter, unleachable.   However,   the   high   temperature   form   is   always   chrome (VI)    in   oxidising  atmosphere.   But   on   applying  reducing  atmosphere chrome    (VI)    gets   reduced   to   Cr(III)    and   remains   as   Cr(III)    upto about    400°C    before    getting    reconverted    to    Cr(VI)     in    oxidising atmosphere.    This   principle   has   been   used   to   convert   Cr(III)    to Cr(Vl)   and  back.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of value added products such as tiles/bricks employing the waste sludge resulting from tanneries,   and   also   to   achieve   efficient   chrome   management.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of tiles/bricks employing the tannery waste sludge by incorporating the sludge in building ceramic materials.<br>
The present invention is based on the finding that the incorporation of the tannery sludge to clays and shaping the resulting mixture to bricks/tiles, drying the resulting bricks/tiles to the desired moisture and firing by heating the tiles/bricks and cooling to room temperature under reducing atmosphere results in bricks/tiles which are useful as building materials.<br>
Accordingly,   the  present   invention  provides  a  process   for  the   preparation  of<br>
tiles bricks useful for building construction which comprises .<br>
(i)	mixing tannery sludge to clays in an amount ranging from 5-25% wt and 75-95%<br>
wt and grinding them together to get a homogeneous mass,<br>
(ii)        shaping the resulting mixture to bricks/tiles,<br>
( iii)       drying the resulting tiles/bricks to the desired moisture.<br>
( iv)       firing by heating the tiles/bricks and,<br>
(v)        cooling to room temperature under reduced atmosphere at 9000-1000 C to obtain tiles/bricks.<br>
Then amount of the clay and the tannery sludge may preferably range from 75-95%, and 5.25% respectively. The clay employed for the mixing may be selected from paddy fields, backwaters or secondary clay deposits having particle size 5-03 um and high plasticity along with mouldability and brick red fired colour. Generally the clays now in the and brick manufacture can be used for this process also. The drying mav be effected either by sunlight in the open or in a temperature controlled heating oven. The moisture content of the resultant bricks/tiles may range from 20% to 30% depending on the conditions of the extrusion mixture. The firing may preferably be effected by oxidative firing by using coal, oil or wood as fuel. The cooling may be effected by employing oxidative tiring and reductive cooling (OFRC) by passing reducing gases so as to reduce Cr(Vl) present in the sludge to Cr(III) and thenfixing chromium as non leachable component.<br>
The reductants such as a mixture of kerosene/water can be employed. Other possibilities are mixture of alcohols/water and coal gas/steam or any hydrocarbon/steam mixtures. The size of the bricks/tiles may be of standard size such as 22cm x 11cm x 9cm or also 20cm x 10cm x 10cm, and 50mm x 50mm x 50mm.<br>
The      invention     is	illustrated        by	the      following        examples<br>
which   should   not   be   construed   to    limit   the   scope   of    the   present<br>
invention.<br>
Example   I<br>
160 gm of red burning clay (tile clay) was powdered and mixed well with 16 gms of powdered tannery sludge in a laboratory mixer for 10 hrs. This mixture was pressed to tiles of size 50mm x 50mm x 10mm at a pressure of 100 MPa, dried in the electric oven at 105°C, fired at 900°C. The tile was cooled after switching off the furnace. The leachability of chromium was found out by analysis. The clay had 60% silica, 15% alumina and 2.5% iron   oxide   are  the   tannery   sludge   had   40%   loss   on   ignition.<br>
Example   II<br>
85 gms of the red burning clay containing 65% silica, 8% iron oxide and 18% aluminium oxide was mixed with 15 gm of powdered tannery sludge containing 30% loss on ignition, 2.5% silica and 2% fibres and pressed to tiles of 50mm x 50mm x 10mm size, fired at 900°C for two hrs. The leachability of chromium was found out. Air was allowed to flow in the furnace during firing  and  cooling.<br>
Example   III<br>
360 gm of the brick clay powder was mixed with 36 gm of the tannery sludge powder intimately with water content of 12%. The   powder   mixture   was   pressed   to   tiles    of    size   50mm   x   50mm   x 1.0 mm   and   fired   at   950°C   with   a    soaking   period   of    2    hrs.    During rooling,   which  was   at   the   average   rate   of   5°C   per  minute,   under   a<br>
flow   of   CO2   gas.<br>
Example   IV<br>
750   gm  of   dry   clay  powder   having   an   alumina   content   of about   16.5%   and   silica   content   67.8%   were   taken   and   mixed   with ground  tannery   sludge   containing   loss   on   ignition   of   60%   (150   g) intimately   using   a   mixer   with   moisture   in   the   range   10-12%.   The mixture   was   pressed   to   blocks   of    size    50mm   x   50mm   x   50mm   at   a pressure   of    100   MPa.    These   blocks   were   fired   in   an   electrically heated   furnace   at   a   heating   rate   of    10°C   per   minute   upto   950°C. The   cooling   was    low   at   a   rate   of    2°C   per   minute   upto    500°C    and then   at   faster   rates.   During   cooling,   nitrogen  gas   was   allowed  to flow   through   the   tube    till    the    temperature    reached    300°C.    The ieachability   of   the   chromium    (VI)    form   was   estimated   and   result is   presented   in  Table   1.<br>
Example   V<br>
150 gm of the tile/brick clay (red burning clay* used for bricks) having reasonable plasticity was mixed with 20 gm of the tannery sludge, ground in semi dry condition (20% moisture) and plastically moulded to blocks of size 50mm x 50mm x 25mm, dried in oven at 95°C for 24 hrs, fired at 1000°C. The cooling was done at 5°C/minute under constant flow of vapour of a mixture of alcohol and water in the ratio (2% alcohol/98% water) . The Diock   after   firing   and   cooling   was   black   in   colour   and   was   very<br>
well    sintered   with    strength   above    120    Kg/cm   .    The   chromium    (VI) leachable   form   was   less   than   5   mg/kg   (Table   I).<br>
Example  VI<br>
About    150    gm    of    clay    as    mentioned    in    example    IV    was mixed   with    15gm    of   powdered   and   dried    tannery    sludge   uniformly and   dry   pressed   in   a   die   at   200   MPa   pressure   to   block   of   50mm   x 50mm   x   20mm.    A   dozen   of   the   similar   blocks   were   made   and   were fired   at   900°C   and   cooled   under   a   reducing   atmosphere.    This reducing  atmosphere  was   made  by  passing  a   mixture   of   10%  kerosene and   90%   water    through   a   hot    tube   outside    the    furnace,    the   open end  of   the   tube   being   introduced   inside   the   furnace.   All  possible outlets   of    the    furnace   were   closed   to    avoid   any    leakage   of   the vapours   to   outside   or   entry   of   air   from   outside   to   inside   of   the furnace.   Majority   of   the   blocks   were   strong   and   black   in   colour, a    few    being    under    transition    from    dark    grey    to    black.     The chromium   leachability   was   determined   and   were   below   10   mg/kg (Table   I).<br>
Example  VII<br>
Another experiment was conducted with a bulk clay powder, average particle size lower than 0.5 microns and iron content 4.5-5%, and alumina 20.05% and silica 52% and iron oxide, 5.8%, high plastic material. A batch of 10 blocks of size 50mm x 50mm x 50mm were made by extrusion after homogenising the mixture containing   16-20%  moisture.    Such   blocks   were   dried   for   36   hrs   at 95°C, fired in an electric kiln with a soaking of 5-6 hrs. The cooling was done at a very slow rate under flowing reducing gases produced from a mixture of 2 % kerosene and water from a preheater. The cooling from 950°C to 800°C was done at 2°C/min. and then later, at 5°C/min. But the cooling was continued under reducing atmosphere till the temperature reached to 200°C. The leachability of Cr(VI) in this case from the fired blocks were in the range less than 20 mg/kg and the colour was varying between grey   and  black.<br>
Example  VIII<br>
About   3000   kg/of   red   burning   clay   containing   about   10% of   moisture   and  having   silica   65.5%,   alumina   16.7%   and   iron   oxide 3.25%   as   major   contituents   was   mixed   with   300   Kg   of   powdered tannery    sludge    intimately    in    a    pan    mill     for    reaching    to    a homogeneous   mass.   The   net   water   content   was   about   15%.   This   mass was    extruded    in   a   pug   mill    and   was    wire    cut    to   bricks    of    size 20cm  x   10cm  x   10cm   and  dired   in   air   at   30°C   for   two  days   followed by   drying   in   oven   to  moisture   content   as   low   as   3-4%   such   blocks were    fired   in   a   kiln   having    facility    for    closed    firing.    The initial    firing   was    done    in    oxidising   atmosphere    at    about    900°C with   a   soaking   at   the   high   temperature   for   2-3   hrs.    The   cooling was   done   in   presence   of    flowing   reducing   gas   mixture   containing carbon  dioxide  and  steam  generated  from  a  mixture   of   kerosene  and water,   kerosene   content   varying   from   10%   to   2%   during   cooling.   A cooling   rate   of   2 - 5 ° C   per   minute   was    maintained   till    the temperature   reached   200°C.   The   furnace   was   cooled   by   natural   air to room temperature and the bricks were taken out. More than 800 of the bricks were fully black in colour with chromium leacha-bility levels less than 5 mg/kg. However, a few bricks were grey to red at the door side of the kiln which had leachability ranging from 50-100 mg/kg. This has happened due to reoxidation during  cooling.<br>
Example  IX<br>
3 blocks of size 50mm x 50mm x 50mm were made by pressing a mixture of 15% tannery sludge (containing 1.8% chromium) and clay. These blocks were fired in an electric furnace at 900°C and cooled in a reducing atmosphere containing vapours of kerosene and water. The leachable Cr (VI) was estimated.<br>
Example  X<br>
About 1 Kg of the red burning clay was powdered and mixed with tannery sludge (containing 3.5% chromium) having a total organic matter to the extent of 75%, 150 gms and further ground to a homogeneous mass. This was pressed to blocks of 50mm x 50mm x 50mm, dried and fired in the range 850-950°C with a soaking at the peak temperature for 2 hrs. The cooling was done under flowing reducing gases containing vapours of kerosene and water.   The   Ieachable  chromium  was   estimated.<br>
Example  XI<br>
About    650    gms    of    clay   powder    and    100    gms    of    tannery sludge   was   mixed   intimately   and   moulded   to   blocks   of   size   50mm   x<br>
40mm x 50mm. The tannery sludge contained very high chromium levels of above 6.5%. The sludge-clay blocks were fired at 900°C and cooled in a mixture of vapours rich in kerosene and steam (10% kerosene) upto 200°C. The black blocks thus obtained were tested   for   leachable   chromium  content.<br>
All the results of the leachability tests on the examples where the firing was done at varying conditions are provided   in  Table   I   and   II.<br>

The inference from the above table is that irrespective of the initial chrome content, the OFRC process can effectively control the chromium leachability and thus find an effective method of environment   friendly  disposal.<br>
The   advantages   of   the  present   process:<br>
(1)      The      process   can   utilize   bulk    (&gt;15%)    of   the   tannery   sludge from    the    leather    industry.     No    existing    processess    can utilise   so   effectively   the   pollution   creating   sludge. {2)      Complete   conversion   of   Cr(VI)    to   Cr(III)   non   leachable   form can  be   achieved.   It  becomes   very  difficult   to  convert   Cr(VI) to  Cr(III)   at  usual  processing  conditions.   While  heating  the bricks   in   oxidising   atmosphere   is   a   must   to   impart   strength to   the   bricks,   Cr(III)    also   automatically   gets   converted   to Cr(VI)    which   always    leaches    out    into    the    streams    or environment.   A  reduction  during  cooling   is   the   only  solution to  this   problem.<br><br>
Usually the clays are available in nearby tanneries and hence transportation of tannery sludge would not pose any problem.<br>
Usually tannery sludge contains 10-15% water which is actually used in the preparation of the sludge-clay mixtures. Hence predrying of the sludge is not required, thus   saving  considerably  on  energy.<br>
The tannery sludge contains more than 60% of organic volatiles which decompose during heating. This provides energy in the form of heat, thus tannery sludge acts as an internal fuel. This has been found true in the present finding that more than 15% fuel is saved in the firing of sludge clay bricks compared to ordinary clay bricks under similar   experimental   conditions.<br><br>
These bricks are about 20% lighter and hence save energy in transportation since more number of bricks can be transported with same fuel requirements compared to ordinary clay bricks.<br>
This    finding    has    sufficient     implication    in    technology related   to   clay  building  materials   since   the   addition   of tannery   sludge   results   in  upto   15%   saving   in  clay   (top   soil) and  hence   contributes   to   environmental   protection   of   fertile top  soil   in  agricultural   lands.<br>
(8)	Usually tannery sludge is a relatively difficult material to<br>
reduce to size by grinding. The sludge-clay mixture can be<br>
homogenised by grinding in a pan mill because the silica in<br>
clay  acts   as   a   grinding  medium.<br><br><br><br>
We claim :<br>
1	A process for the preparation of tiles/bricks useful for building construction<br>
which comprises :<br>
(i)        mixing tannery sludge to clays in an amount ranging from 5-25% wt<br>
and 75-95% wt and grinding them together to get a homogeneous<br>
mass, (ii)       shaping the resulting mixture to bricks/tiles, (iii)      drying the resulting tiles/bricks to the desired moisture, (iv)      firing by heating the tiles/bricks and,. (v)      cooling to room temperature under reduced atmosphere to obtain<br>
tiles/bricks.<br>
2.	A process as claimed in claim 1 wherein the clay employed is selected from paddy field, backwaters or secondary clay reserves usually employed in making building bricks/tiles.<br>
3.	A process as claimed in claims 1-2 wherein the moisture content of the resultant bricks/tiles produced range from 20-30%.<br>
4.	A process as claimed in claims 1-3 wherein the firing preferably be<br>
effected by oxidative firing by fuels such as wood, coal or oil.<br>
5.	A   process   for  the   preparation   of  tiles/bricks   useful   for   building<br>
construction substantially as herein described with reference to the examples.<br></td>
