				<td>PROCEDURE FOR SUBSEQUENT INSERTION OF A BOLTED ASSEMBLY IN CONCRETE SLEEPERS<br>
The invention is with regard to a procedure for subsequent insertion of a bolted assembly in hardened concrete sleepers, whereby the same is drilled through from both sides to create a stepped bore.<br>
Bolted assemblies serve to anchor elements that are to be mounted on the surface of the concrete sleeper, particularly of track-bearing points in the case of shunting switch sleepers.<br>
By normal shunting switch sleepers one understands sleepers that can be manufactured in the factory according to the switch blueprint with the corresponding length and above all with bolted assemblies that are accurately positioned. The following deals with sleepers that have individual measurements that are dependent on switch geometry. These shunting switch sleepers are usually constructed in long pre-stressing beds. So-called stencil sheet plates are, thereby, inserted at the underside of the sheathing which is provided with holes in which bolted assemblies can be affixed before the concreting procedure. The holes are drilled exactly according to the specification of the switch coordinates. The measurements for shrinkage and creeping of sleepers are taken into account in the borehole co-ordinates.<br>
Manufacture of sleepers with in-built bolted assemblies has been tried and tested in practice but is not practicable any more in its entirety in some cases. Subsequent insertion of bolted assemblies could therefore be useful especially at building sites or places of installation that lie far away from the manufacturing factory. It is not difficult to conceive that shipping of substitute sleepers that have to be re-manufactured to replace sleepers that have been delivered, abroad<br><br>
especially, from the manufacturing factory and that have incurred transport damages, is no longer practicable from the point of view of time as well as economics.<br>
The task of the invention is therefore to create a procedure which will, in a simple manner, allow a subsequent insertion of bolted assemblies in already hardened concrete sleepers, i.e. in concrete sleepers that are delivered "raw1 to installation sites and that will ensure the same accurate positioning of the bolted assemblies as in the case of factory-made production.<br>
The solution, in accordance with the invention, is that, before drilling, the sleeper's surface is superimposed with a marking that projects over the bore for a precisely tailored erection of a stencil plate with a pass hole that is aligned to the bore's axis in order to hold the bolted assembly that is affixed to the stencil plate exactly in the bore's axis until the filling compound that has been subsequently inserted from the underside has hardened.<br>
Before positioning the bore, whereby a thinner bore is inserted from the upper side whose diameter is a little larger than the outer diameter of the bolted assembly i.e. the synthetic bush that surrounds the actual screw and a blind hole that is larger in diameter and that is inserted from the lower side and forms the receiving space for the clamping nut of the bolted assembly, a marking is raised in the simplest case, on the sleeper that comprises of a line that has two additional markings on both sides of the marking to indicate the bore's centre for the edges of the stencil sheet plate. After inserting the stepped bore, the marking for the bore's centre is lost, so these additional markings enable a corresponding setting-up of the stencil sheet plate that in a further development of the invention illustrates a preferred quadratic steel stencil sheet plate with marking indents that form a cross-hairs, whereby the bore of the stencil sheet plate should equal the diameter of the bolted assembly's screw thread's head<br><br>
and the sprue bush that surrounds it for aligning on the lower side of the stencil sheet place can rise up. If the stencil sheet plate is affixed to the sleeper by means of a clamping jaw and the bolted assembly is pushed through from below, then the same can be screwed tightly with the help of a nut. The stencil sheet plate is thereby aligned parallel to the bore's axis due to the bush rising up at the lower side of the stencil plate and also lies exactly in the bore's axis since, due to the meshing of the screw thread part with the stencil plate recess and its precise alignment by means of the sleeper markings, this overlay can be achieved in the simplest manner.<br>
After this advance alignment of the bolted assembly in the stepped bore that is subsequently inserted into the concrete sleeper, naturally with sufficient air on both sides for moulding with the help of a filling compound, the sleeper is inverted and casting takes place from the lower side. After the grouting has hardened, the nut that only serves temporary fastening can be removed again. Preferred clamping of the stencil plate to the sleeper that takes place by means of a clamping jaw can then also be released afterwards and the stencil plate lifted upwards. In this case, one then has a bolted assembly that corresponds exactly to the marked positioning in the sleeper and whose assembly precision does not deviate in any manner from the precision with which such bolted assemblies are usually inserted in the manufacturing factory when producing sleepers.<br>
It thereby, ultimately, is also within the scope of the invention that a "raw" concrete/shunting switch sleeper that is manufactured with an oversize is shortened to the required length at the installation site before installing the bolted assembly. Especially in the case of shunting switch sleepers that have a multiplicity of varying lengths, it is advisable not to hold a blank in stock as substitute sleepers for every shunting switch sleeper length in order to be able to subsequently insert the bolted assembly in the case of possible damage to the corresponding shunting switch sleeper but instead to take, if required, only one<br><br>
viz., the longest shunting switch sleeper as a blank and shorten this blank, if necessary, to the size of the required shunting switch sleeper at the installation site.<br>
Other advantages, features and details of the invention emanate from the following description of an exemplary embodiment as well as by means of the drawings.<br>
Figure 1	is a top view of a "raw" sleeper with corresponding minimum<br>
distances and markings for subsequent bolted assemblies;<br>
Figure 2        is an enlarged view of the "raw" sleeper with precise reproduction of the marking for a bolted assembly;<br>
Figure 3        shows a section of an inverted sleeper with a subsequently inserted stepped bore;<br>
Figure 4        is a view of the bolted assembly;<br>
Figure 5        is a top view of the upper side of the sleeper with a stencil plate that has been fixed on to it by means of screw clamps;<br>
Figure 6        is a perspective partial view of the sleeper with a bolted assembly that has been passed through it and aligned to it and bolted onto it;<br>
Figure 7        is a bottom view of the sleeper after inserting and aligning the bolted assembly by means of a stencil plate and<br>
Figure 8        is a section through the sleeper with a completely fused bolted assembly before removal of the stencil plate.<br><br>
Figure 1 illustrates a top view of a "raw" sleeper with corresponding minimum distances and markings 2 for bolted assemblies to be inserted subsequently. These markings are illustrated individually in Figure 2 which, thereby, concerns the exact position of the axis of the bolted assembly indicated by a cross with a circle 3 as well as a horizontal line 4 emanating from this which has additional markings 5 specified on both sides that correspond to the position of the side flanges 6 of the stencil plate that is addressed in detail below. A stepped bore 7 is first inserted into the sleeper and in fact by first inserting a thinner, piercing bore 10 for acceptance of the front pole section 8 of the bolted assembly 9 and in fact from the upper side of the sleeper whereupon, after turning the sleeper, a blind hole 11 is inserted from the bottom that is larger in diameter, that accepts the head of the bolted assembly 9 that is surrounded by a synthetic bush 12. After the residues, if applicable, that remain in the transition zone when inserting the blind hole11, have been knocked out, a stencil plate 13 is affixed on the upper side 15 of the sleeper by means of a screw clamp 14, whereby the alignment takes place by means of the already addressed markings as well as the marking indents 16 and 17 located on the quadratic stencil plate 13 that form a cross-hairs. Only those indents are required for aligning that run parallel to the marking line 4. The corresponding marking indent 16 is aligned exactly to this line and the stencil applied in such a manner that it lies exactly between the additional markings 5 with its outer edges. In this aligned position, the centre point of the recess clearance 18 of the stencil plate is located exactly at that position at which the marking 3 was originally placed for the axis of the bolted assembly. The diameter of the recess clearance 18 corresponds to the diameter of the forepart of the nut pertaining to the bolted assembly that can be inserted from the bottom side after alignment of the stencil plate that was previously described, whereupon the remaining part of the nut is firmly screwed in by means of a fastening nut 19. Thereby, as can be seen especially in Figure 8, the synthetic sprue bush 21 that surrounds the actual metallic pole 20 of the bolted<br><br>
assembly appears at the bottom side of the stencil plate 13 so that by tightly screwing the nut 19, the bolted assembly is located very precisely with its axis in the required original axial position according to marking 3 and the exact perpendicular position is given simultaneously i.e. the parallelism of the bolted assembly to the bore's axis of the stepped bore 7. After affixing the bolted assembly with multiple-part grouting bush that surrounds the actual pole-affixing part with the clamping nut 22, whereby another bush 23 is next to the bush 21 already mentioned and seals the latter while overlapping it and is subsequently also provided with a sleeve 12, already mentioned, that has ribs 24, the sleeper is positioned with its upper side down and the clearance 25 between the bolted assembly 9 and the stepped bore 7, comprising of bore sections 10 and 11, is lined with grouting mortar. The assembling nut 19 is released as soon as this has hardened, after which the screw clamps 14 too are removed from the stencil plate 13. One then has a bolted assembly that is inserted with a precision that is in no manner inferior to that achieved when inserting such bolted assemblies during production of sleepers in a factory.<br><br><br>
