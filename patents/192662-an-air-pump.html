				<td>This invention relates to an air pump.<br>
An object of this invention is to propose an air pump which can work as an air compressor.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose an air pump which can also work as a vacuum pump.<br>
The term "air" in this specification includes gases as well. So also the term "water" in this specification includes other liquids as well.<br>
One of the advantages of this invention is that, during operation, the working zone is cooled by water circulation. Optionally, air cooling also takes place.<br>
Another advantage of this invention is that, during operation, the working stroke, whether the compression stroke as in the case of the air compressor or the suction stroke as in the case of the vacuum pump, is loaded by a weight or spring which renders such stroke more effective, since the force of such weight or spring acts in the direction  of the working stroke.  The  said  load<br><br>
may be made to act on the prime move , ono prim mover drive components, the piston executing the working stroke, as long as the effect is felt in the direction of the working stroke.<br>
Various other features of the air pump proposed herein will be apparent from the following further description thereof.<br>
The air pump, according to this invention, comprises first and second cylinders respectively accommodating first and second pistons, driven by a prime mover, the second piston dividing the second cylinder into two independent compartments; a water jacket, open to atmosphere, surrounding the cylinders, the water in the jacket communicating with the first cylinder and with one of the compartments of the second cylinder, whereby during reciprocation of the pistons water is pumped out of, and fresh water from the water jacket pumped into, the cylinders, while suction/compression working strokes are executed by the second piston, in the other compartment of the second cylinder, drawing in and pumping out air, cyclically; and a weight or spring acting  on<br><br>
the second piston, rendering the working stroke more effective.<br>
The air pump will now be described in greater detail by referring to the accompanying drawings, Figs 1 and 2 in which respectively illustrate by way of example, one of various possible embodiments of this invention with the pistons at the lowermost position and the pistons in the uppermost position.<br>
First and second cylinders C1 and C2 respectively accommodate first and second pistons P1 and P2 driven by a prime mover, such as, the electric motor M.<br>
The second piston P2 divides the second cylinder into two independent compartments Dl and D2, which are created as the said piston reciprocates within the cylinder C2 .<br>
A  water jacket W open to  atmosphere,  surrounds the   cylinders,   the  water   in   the   jacket communicating  with  the first cylinder  and  also with  one  of  the  compartments   of  the  second<br><br>
cylinder.<br>
While the pistons are driven by the motor M, water is pumped out of, and fresh water from the water jacket is pumped into, the cylinder C1 and one of the compartments 01 of the cylinder C2, thus cooling them.<br>
Simultaneously, air is sucked, from atmosphere, into the other compartment D2 of the cylinder C2 through one way inlet valve V1 and pumped out under pressure through one way outlet valve V2 to the point of delivery, to serve as an air compressor Fig.l). While pumping the air out (the working or compression stroke) the load which is in the form of a spring or weight WT (as illustrated) acting on the piston P2 renders the working stroke more effective, because, in addition to the force exerted by the motor M, the said load acts in the direction of such force to render compression more effective. The air pump now acts as an air compressor.<br>
If the position of the compartments Dl and D2 is reversed  (fig.2),  the  weight  W  acts  in   the<br><br>
direotion of themotor M to exvcut the working stroKe which is the suction strcke in this case. In other words, as the piston P2 moves downwards, it oreates a suction prassura abova it (Pig.2).  Consaquantly, if tha ona way inlat valva V1 is connaotad to a ohaabar froa which air is to ba avaouatad, such air is drawn into tha ocapartaant (dasignatad Dl in Fig.l) and oraatad as tha piston P2 aovas downwards in tha suction stroka. Naxt, as tha piston P2 aovas upwards, tha air so drawn in is disohargan through tha ona way outlat valva V2. Tha prooass rapaats, tha air puap now working as a vacuua puap. Incidantally, as alraady statad, tha waight V acts in tha diraotion of tha suction stroka to randar it aora affactive.<br>
An air coluan A is disposad abova tha watar ocluan in tha watar Jaofcat opan to ataosphara. During tha puaping out of watar fron tha oylindars into tha watar Jackat and puaping in of watar froa tha watar Jackat into tha oylindars, air in tha air ooluan A ax its to ataosphara and ra-antars pariodioally through tha opaning 0 thus adding to tha cooling affaot.  Tha air coluan, howavar, is an optional faatura.<br>
Tha taras and axpraasions inn this spacification ara of daseription and not of liaitation, thara balng no intan<br><br>
tlon in the use of suoh teras and expressiont of exeluding any â€¢quivalants of the features illustratsd and dasoribad, but it is undarstood that various othar embodiaants of tha air punp proposad harain ara poasibia without daparting from tha soopa and aabit of this invantion.<br><br><br><br>
I claim:<br>
1.An air pump comprising first and second cylinders respectively accommodating first and second pistons, driven by a prime mover, the second piston dividing the second cylinder into two independent compartments; a water jacket, open to atmosphere, surrounding the cylinders, the water in the jacket communicating with the first cylinder and with one of the compartments of the second cylinder, whereby during reciprocation of the pistons water is pumped out of, and fresh water from the water jacket pumped into, the cylinders, while suction/compression working strokes are executed by the second piston, in the other compartment of the second cylinder, drawing in and pumping out air, cyclically; and a weight or spring acting on the second piston, rendering the working stroke more effective.<br>
2.An air pump as claimed in Claim 1 wherein the compartment of the second cylinder in which the working stroke is executed, has one way inlet  and<br><br>
outlet valve means for the entry and egress of air .<br>
3.An  air  pump  as  claimed in  any  one	of  the<br>
preceding Claims wherein an air column is	disposed<br>
over the water level in the water jacket,	said air<br>
column being open to atmosphere.<br>
4.An air pump substantially as herein described with reference to, and as illustrated in, the accompanying drawings.<br>
