20     Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
[0045] The real time operations support provided in one embodiment<br>
comprises a portal-based decision support process, knowledge management<br>
and asset performance monitoring system for the effective operations and<br>
maintenance of an asset. The system facilitates a line of sight through an<br>
25     organization, from the asset performance goals to the actions that deliver them<br>
at various levels and across various functions within the organization.   It is<br>
desirable that the levels and  functions are  substantially  or essentially<br>
comprehensive.  The  system  provides   for  the  analysis   and  display   of<br><br>
WO 2004/070526<br>
performance metrics and supporting actions by personn access profile, thereby providing the production process readily viewed and managed.<br>
[0046] In one embodiment, the system comprise<br>
 5 	operation and maintenance management process, which time" through an access portal technology medium. N of an access portal medium can include: a "web" portal, the Internet or an intranet; wired or wireless telecommu public, private or personal communication systems; z<br>
10 present application the term "web portal" will mean an within the invention and is not limited to only an Interne unless specified.<br>
[0047] An "asset" includes any production, process manufacturing   facility   in   the   industries   selected   1<br>
15 petrochemical and refining; power utilities; pulp and p£ specialty chemicals; and the like. The asset has sources o effectively describe the performance of the asset in term uptime, energy efficiency, product quality, operational cc A non-limiting list of sources of data can include control<br>
20    parameter   readings /manual,   electronic,   pneumatic, associated with enterprise management systems. In the sources were invariably used independently and not brouj system or grouping of systems in order to view, monito; performance of the assets, as well as the functional gro<br>
25     assets.<br>
[0048] In one embodiment the present invention operations support analysis algorithms and data extrat leverage the reservoir of data that exists in production<br><br>
WO 2004/070526	PCT/US2004/001534<br>
21<br>
control systems and client enterprise management systems. These applications can extract key performance information, including production loss or deferment, and loss causation information, as well as equipment uptime performance. The extraction and presentation of these performance metrics <br>
5 	facilitates improved decision-making within operations and maintenance support teams. Real time asset performance information gathered from control systems and other information sources can be brought together in the line of sight management system, which can be designed to be the operations and maintenance  support control  panel  or  dashboard.      The  access portal<br>
10 	technology enables a real time access medium for production and maintenance management information. The benefits that the present invention provides to a support organization include the capability for focusing support team efforts on value-based decisions and the measurement of their alignment with asset goals.   Asset performance can be viewed from any authorized<br>
15 	workstation with access, thereby enabling subject matter experts to support operations, regardless of their physical location.<br>
[0049] The present invention can provide significant value to an operation, especially with the engagement of local operations and maintenance teams associated with the asset Embodiments of the present<br>
20 	invention can provide, in some cases, as much as 30 percent in cost reductions through reduced operating and maintenance staff needs as well as reduced equipment repair expenses. Uptime improvements o£ for example, 3 to 8 percent can be acTheved, depending on the reliability of the operation.<br>
[0050] Another aspect of the invention includes a "clear line of sight" of<br>
25 	operating performance in terms of uptime, availability and cost on a real time basis throughout the organization from senior management to workfront levels and across various functions. Within the present application the term "clear line of sight' shall mean the ability of various personnel within an<br><br>
WO 2004/070526	PCT/US2004/001534<br>
22<br>
organization to view, with proper access and authorization, operations and maintenance data, status reports and other information relating to an asset Significant value can be realized by each function in the support organization that can observe and measure their performance on a real time basis. The<br>
5 	alignment and clear line of sight through an organization provided by the invention can deliver a reduction in the level of resources required to provide the support function and at the same time can improve the work product A fully aligned organization is one that applies the right resource, at the right time to the point of need for an operation, and has high efficiency.<br>
10	[0051] The present invention can provide the distinct benefits of showing<br>
the relationship between cross-functions that support an asset and building a clear picture of how the organization can align actions to goals. The line of sight model enables each support function group to measure its performance to suit the overall business goals and introduces significant rigor to the<br>
15     process.<br>
[0052] The present invention provides the ability to significantly improve the performance of an operating facility by having access to performance information that drives effective facility improvements. The system can push information to the user, as opposed to an information pull by the user, so that<br>
20 	time is not wasted t searching for the information needed for decisions. Effective asset optimization can be facilitated from a presentation format that is not traditionally available.<br>
[0053] With the present invention, the capture of knowledge of asset operation from operating and maintenance staff can facilitate the retention of<br>
25 	enterprise operating knowledge. The value this can deliver is multifold and may include the opportunity to reduce the number of operating staff because the operations and maintenance knowledge base is accessible to personnel and systems throughout the organization, such as, an expert in a particular field or<br><br>
WO 2004/070526	PCT/US2004/W1534<br>
23<br>
an embedded "expert" built within the operating system. Another value is the matching of an understanding of the failure potential with the delivery of mitigation measures to prevent recurrences. This is particularly the case in maintenance and operating related knowledge that might be held in memory <br>
5 	by enterprise or operations personnel in the prior art methodologies, but is not more permanently captured for future use.<br>
[0054] The present invention can provide more consistent operations through the use of expert systems that employ captured knowledge and technical experts embedded in control systems. By capturing knowledge from <br>
10 	mature operators and facility personnel and then combining it with process technical knowledge, the present invention facilitates retention of operational and asset process knowledge and consistent application over the life of the asset<br>
[0055] The present invention provides defect-elimination processes and <br>
15 	tools to reduce corrective maintenance work activity and associated costs. The preventative maintenance decisions facilitated by the present invention can focus both technical and operating resources to reduce production losses and deferments. These can be reflected in the revenues from improved production volumes. Cost improvements can also be realized through improved <br>
20 	equipment life and lower maintenance needs. Use of real time loss and cost information can often justify asset improvements more effectively and enhance performance.<br>
[0056] The present invention can optimize maintenance activity for proactive and planned maintenance. The expert systems provide intelligence <br>
25 	on equipment and system condition to generate maintenance activity by condition, in addition to any strictly calendar-based maintenance activity. The use of condition-based mechanical integrity analysis can reduce equipment inspection costs, equipment failure incidents, and the associated business and<br><br>

PCT/US2004/001534<br><br>
personnel risks.<br>
[0057] The present invention facilitates the following implementation<br>
mechanisms and returns: (1) it can be differentiated from other asset<br>
management systems for large engineering and maintenance support projects<br>
   5    	that are based on long term asset performance; (2) significant front end<br>
activity and conceptual studies associated with projects for improving asset<br>
and enterprise operations can be enhanced by the use of supervisory control<br>
systems information; (3) it can deliver focused business improvement for<br>
support functions in enterprise operations; (4) it provides a system that can be<br>
10    	serviced and improved by maintenance experts; (5) it provides the ability to<br>
feed equipment reliability and performance knowledge into new facility .and<br>
process designs to deliver more reliable projects; (6) it can be included as part<br>
of an engineering, procurement and construction project for a new asset, or as<br>
a retrofit for existing assets; and (7) it can provide a benchmarking database<br>
15     of equipment performance knowledge for use in requests for proposals,<br>
project bids, or for use by a third party.<br>
[0058] A significant reservoir of data exists for operating assets and facilities across industries including for example, oil and gas, petrochemical and refining, power generation and utilities, pulp and paper, commercial and <br>
20 	specialty chemicals, and the like. These industries are hereinafter referred to as "process industries" or "production process industries," and the operating assets and facilities as "process assets" or "production process assets." The key objectives and focuses of one embodiment of the invention include the knowledge-based extraction of information from several disparate sources and<br>
25 	the transformation into actionable information across functional groups that support an asset process, or manufacturing plant or facility, as shown in Fig. 1.<br>
[0059] Typical sources of days that are available within an operation and<br><br>
WO 2004/070526	PCT/US2004/001534<br>
25<br>
the potential use of that data information delivery according to an embodiment of the invention are shown in Fig. 2. Data information comes in various types with different values and applications for each type of data. The needs necessary to make each decision regarding a piece of data also vary. <br>
  5 	Real time operations also vary depending upon the type of data and its value and application.<br>
[0060] The basic elements and framework for an embodiment of the system architecture of the invention are outlined in Fig. 3. The main elements for delivering a solution for an abnormal operating event, e.g. from a pump<br>
10 	failure to a process or equipment parameter deviation, can include: performance monitoring and diagnostic systems module, including expert systems, for example; a decision support module, including expert systems; an intelligent scheduling and work management/task allocation module; a supply chain management module; an information exchange module; and a<br>
15 	supervisory rule set manager. This gives an overview of the main elements at a very high level. Implementation of each element can require several methods and software tools depending on the particular systems an operation uses to manage various aspects of the asset or enterprise. However, the information necessary to manage an event through to a solution can be made<br>
20 	available through access portal technology for functional work groups that support and manage the particular asset The access portal technology implementation language can include, but is not limited to, JAVA, C/C++, PERL, XML, HTML, HTMLS, Flash ASP, and other internet-based languages. The access portal may also be done as a hardware implementation<br>
25     or by other access means.<br>
[0061] Information about an asset can exist in multiple sources and systems, including process control systems, enterprise management systems, computerized maintenance management   systems (CMMS), technical  and<br><br>
WO 2004/070526	PCT/US2004/001534<br>
engineering document management systems, vendor data including both<br>
procurement and technical vendor data, equipment monitoring systems,<br>
logistics tracking systems, individual staff applications, and so on.   This<br>
information can be relative to timeframes that are very short to time frames of<br>
  5    	a year or more in duration.  Illustrative examples are: less than a second for<br>
some online vibration monitoring equipment; months for engine oil analysis<br>
data, one year for infrared surveys of electrical systems; and 5 years or more<br>
for internal inspection of a vessel during a facility maintenance turnaround.<br>
These various timeframes,  and the time involved to compile, analyze,<br>
10    	manipulate and act on the information can be considered "real time" within<br>
the context of the present invention. In the prior art, the information in these<br>
disparate sources are not brought into one location and presented to the<br>
organization in a manner that shows the overall picture and cross-functional<br>
relationships, and as such the prior art methodology can create silos of<br>
15     	inefficiency in an organization that put roadblocks in the path of improving<br>
organizational performance and understanding of the asset management<br>
processes.<br>
[0062] According to an embodiment of the present invention, the real time support process and system facilitates the coordination and alignment of <br>
20     	cross-functional support, such as through web technology, and delivers a consistent way of performing asset management processes and measuring their effectiveness on a real time scale. One such process, that is an important part of an operation, is the maintenance process known as defect elimination. which addresses how the maintenance and technical groups systematically <br>
25     	eliminate equipment problems in a process plant or manufacturing asset. The purpose of defect elimination is to introduce and create sustainable reliability of equipment and deliver the maximum product and process uptune in the manufacturing asset to ensure maximum revenue. This is simply an example<br><br>
WO 2004/070526	PCT/US2004/001S34<br>
of one asset management process in an operation within the maintenance function of the organization, provided for the purpose of illustration and not intended to limit the scope of the invention to other asset management functions.<br>
5	[0063] Fig. 4 outlines a part of the process in eliminating defects and<br>
improving uptime performance of an asset in one embodiment of the invention. It illustrates the initial planning and strategic definition that can be used to successfully conduct reliability performance improvements. By taking information from a field or plant and transforming that information into<br>
10 	meaningful charts and graphs, defect elimination teams have a better understanding of what problems have occurred, root cause failure analysis reviews can be performed, control system optimization procedures audits can be performed, and the design out of failure can be performed In the prior art, most of these steps are manual.  In contrast, the real time operations support<br>
15 	of the present invention can deliver consistent performance reporting in the decision process, extracted on a real time basis from multiple data sources. The present invention provides the information that is required to make the decisions in such a way so as to shorten the time between the abnormal event and the solution delivery. The present invention can also facilitate the uniform<br>
20 	delivery of the right amount of information provided across several different operations to make consistent, quality decisions and analysis of the abnormal event.<br>
[0064] The schematic of Fig. 4 shows an example of a reliability analysis at the front-end of the process determining the priorities associated with<br>
25 	critical plant components and systems. These priorities can determine the relative impact that the components and systems have on delivery of a product and are used to focus the elimination of equipment defects to impact production. The ability to measure real time product loss (sometimes called<br><br>
WO 2004/070526		PCT/US2004/001534	<br>
28<br>
"deferment") and downtime accelerates and improves the effectiveness of the defect elimination process undertaken by the maintenance group. The process of analyzing data to determine areas of focus can now be performed in real time and the results presented for action.<br>
5	[0065] Traditionally, the analysis of operational data to deliver uptime<br>
and loss causation information is a manual process, however, real time operations support in this embodiment of the invention provides the analysis from the appropriate data sources on a real time basis. It also allows the standardization of the analysis process to give a consistent approach over<br>
10 	several operations and a basis for benchmarking equipment and system performance.<br>
[0066] The definition of "real time" is important in the description of the present invention because the type of decision support system used depends on the nature of, and the speed required to make the decisions regarding the<br>
15 	system supports. Certain operational decisions fall into broad and generalized timeframes depending on the nature of the decision and the particular function the decision supports. Relevant timeframes can be less than one second in length for certain aspects of an operation, such as for example, the rotational speed (rpm) of an operating motor or turbine. Timeframes of hours, days, or<br>
20 	months can be relevant for other aspects of an operation, for example weekly spot measurements or monthly corrosion monitoring. Timeframes of up to a year or more can be relevant for inspections that require entering a piece of equipment, which might only be possible during a complete facility shutdown. Each of these timeframes can be considered "real time" in context<br>
25 	with the present invention. People experts and/or machine experts can be used to translate the data to actionable information and make the appropriate decisions. The time involved to gather, compile, analyze, manipulate and respond to the data can ah1 be considered to be within a "reaj time" process<br><br>
WO 2004/070526	PCT/US2004/001534<br>
within the scope of the present invention.<br>
[0067] In the present invention, production-related decisions can be made on a real time basis. True real time decision-making in producing operations are typically associated with production control related decisions. These can <br>
5 	be made either by the supervisory process control system or by operators that use the information presented by the control systems. The decisions on a level over and above regulatory and automated control can be determined by the operator and to a large extent are dependent upon operator competence and plant process stability. Decisions can be made ranging from seconds to as<br>
10 	much as 24 hours or more, in response to a process parameter excursion, or to an abnormal situation when a process upset occurs. The focus of the present real time operations support in this context is to improve the quality and integrity of production decisions by the use of so-called machine experts or expert systems. The use of expert system technology is well known in the art<br>
15 	and has been applied to the process industries, as well as more diverse applications in, for example, the medical sector. However, one embodiment of the present invention provides a knowledge capture process that engages technical support and maintenance staff as well as operating staff. This process  enables the structured  capture of process  facility, systems  and<br>
20 	equipment abnormal trends and potential failure mechanisms for use in expert systems that make use of process control systems. Fig. 5 shows an exemplary display for the knowledge capture process, which includes choices for the user to select a combination of which systems, manufacturers, sub-systems, and defects are to be captured This process also allows for a user to quickly<br>
25     and efficiently search for data regarding a particular asset.<br>
[0068] Fig. 6 is one example of the knowledge capture display according to one embodiment of the invention. The display is made up of three main components: an overview, symptoms of defect, and other or miscellaneous<br><br>
WO 2004/070526	PCT/US2004/001S34<br>
30	<br>
human intervention.<br>
[0071] According to embodiments of the present invention, operations support related decisions can also be made with real time decision-based information.     The vast majority of decisions made in operations and<br>
5 	maintenance support in the prior art are done by people in the plant operations maintenance team and by operational technical support staff The decisions are usually associated with actions that need to be taken in response to an equipment failure or an aspect of equipment underperformance. These decisions are generally made on a real time basis in connection with facility<br>
10 	operations in a relevant time frame of less than a second to one or more days, maintenance operations in a time frame on the order of from 1 to 90 days, whereas real time engineering decisions generally occur in 3 to 6 months, and reservoir decisions in the case of petroleum production assets in from 6 months to 1 year or more. The emphasis here is on the provision of real time<br>
15 	information that promotes the right decisions and value-based actions of corresponding functional support teams. The present invention provides, in one embodiment, a real time, line of sight management process that coordinates the operating support functions and creates alignment across the support functions.<br>
20	[0072] An   example  of an   operations  decision  support  portal  that<br>
integrates operations support functions and processes is shown in Fig. 7. In this example, available shutdown incident reports are filtered by downtime range, loss category, cause category, independent service contractor loss, who the issue was raised by, the responsible asset, the shutdown incident report<br>

information. The overview component shows which system is involved, who<br>
the manufacturer of the asset is, the work breakdown structure (or type of<br>
asset), the objective of the asset, and the cause of a recorded defect The<br>
symptoms of defect component shows the symptom the asset is presenting,<br>
 5 	the severity of the defect, the consequence of the defect, and the detection<br>
mechanism utilized to find the defect The miscellaneous information<br>
component shows the defect occurrence frequency, the frequency of the logic<br>
rule application, the logic rule applied, what action to take, the recipient of the<br>
defect report or alarm, and miscellaneous comments.<br>
10		[0069] Since the response of the plant process under small excursions and<br>
abnormal conditions is usually predictable, it is possible to use the control and logic capability of an expert system to replace the human intervention of the operator. The machine expert also has the ability to respond more consistently to abnormal conditions where the response typically has heretofore relied on<br>
15 	the operator competence and ability. There are also the limits an operator will place on the process performance, based on the level of confidence the operator has in managing the process under certain process conditions. The supervisory control system also has the ability to control and manage multiple process variables, but more consistently and at wider technical limits than the<br>
20     	human operator, to allow optimal process system performance.<br>
[0070] The benefits of allowing the machine expert to replace certain operator functions include: (1) Improved operational integrity by ensuring consistent decision making under abnormal conditions and optimization of the response to process excursions and upsets; (2) Operation of the process at <br>
25 	levels closer to the technical limits of the plant process and the associated production increases and energy efficiency; and (3) Improved process stability from the use of multi-variable control technology to manage production processes that are very dynamic in nature and difficult to optimize with<br><br>

be represented in the line of sight portal and visible to the whole organization in the asset management model. Presented in this fashion, it demonstrates to an organization that several functional groups are required to support the operation and each have defined roles to play in its performance. Each <br>
5 	function has a line of sight management process to guide the impact and delivery contribution of the function to the operation. This is described in the line of sight model for the maintenance function as a typical example. It is however, important to recognize that each support function can have differing and unique line of sight model implementations due to the nature of their asset<br>
10    	management processes.<br>
[0074] Typical functions that support an operating plant or asset include facility engineering and construction; maintenance; planning and scheduling; health, safety and environmental services; human resources; production operations; manufacturing; supply chain services, e.g. procurement, materials,<br>
15 	logistics and so on; field or site operations; operations leadership; subsurface operations and engineering; and the like. Some functions can be specific to an industry and can make the management model differ cross-industry.<br>
[0075] As mentioned, one embodiment of the invention is a line of sight (LOS) model. The portal illustrated in Fig. 8 provides a window to the plant <br>
20 	operation and access point to display the real time performance information about each of the support group functions, e.g. maintenance, operations, supply chain, and so on. The plan, real time performance results, and actions to support these are incorporated in a line of sight management model for clear alignment of the support teams. It is different from prior art management <br>
25 	models, which usually focus on a continuous improvement cycle of planning, execution, measurement and monitoring.<br>
[0076] For each LOS model a facilitated process can be used to develop the appropriate LOS content or the associated functional group. This can be<br><br>
WO 2004/070526	PCT/US2004/001534<br>
an important part of the overall process of this embodiment of the invention as it dictates the quality and focus of the function. It is at this point mat the effectiveness of the LOS for the business functional group is determined, Clear goals are stated for the asset or plant and the functional group is<br>
5    challenged to identify the clear performance measures that can be made to track the acThevement of the goals of each of the applicable functions.<br>
[0077] In the example of Fig 8, the maintenance group LOS is depicted. It has three main elements, the plan, the actions and the results, labeled in each column.     The plan element includes the strategy and tactics the<br>
10 	maintenance group has adopted to manage the maintenance of equipment and the performance of the plant systems. It may include any criticality analysis of equipment and systems, the strategy for maintenance, the annual budget requirements, reliability simulation studies and other relevant staff work that describes   the   approach;   philosophy   and   plan   to   manage   equipment<br>
15     performance.<br>
[0078] The   actions   element   includes   the   specific   actions  by  the<br>
maintenance function in applying corrective steps to improve the performance against the real time results acTheved. If there is a variance from target in cost or planned maintenance compliance, or any other of the maintenance metrics,<br>
20      there should be one or more specific actions to bring the metric in line with<br>
targeted results.<br>
[0079] The results element forms the last leg of the LOS and link to real time  <br>
information that  measures  the  performance  associated   with  the maintenance<br>
function. Typical real time performance information includes<br>
25     uptime  and  availability  of equipment maintenance support costs  and maintenance metrics such as ratio of corrective to preventive maintenance. These are all standard metrics in maintenance and express the outcome of a consistent and appropriate maintenance strategy and philosophy applied to the<br><br>
WO 2004/070526	PCT/US2004/001534<br>
asset The way in which results are displayed can be a part of the asset<br>
management process and can be important in setting the business measures on<br>
the performance of the maintenance teams, as well as the cost of the<br>
associated equipment and systems.<br>
 5	[0080] Displayed  in this way,  there  is a clear LOS through the<br>
maintenance function to the business goals. The asset or plant manager,<br>
maintenance manager and other authorized staff can see a clear connection<br>
between business^ associated functional goals and the actual real time results.<br>
"This creates a high level of visibility across the business and demonstrates<br>
10    	clear actions to improve performance.<br>
[0081] The  system  of the  present  invention  also   includes  in  one embodiment a real time production efficiency model.     The production efficiency model is one example of metrics for plant performance. The example seen in Fig. 9 is the model applied to an upstream oil and gas asset in<br>
15     	which real time information from the process control system is used to construct the production efficiency model. The potential performance and actual real time performance are displayed for the key aspects of the asset; the reservoir, the producing wells, the process plant, the export pipeline and the product sales point This can be provided real time for all producing fields in a<br>
20    	complex asset infrastructure, and gives the teams involved in the support of the operation a clear picture and understanding of where value is lost as the product passes through key elements in the production process or value chain.<br>
[0082] The chokes or pinch points in the production process can be measured and a value for the loss or production deferment provided real time.<br>
25     	The overall product loss or production deferment value gives the support teams clear information on the value that is being lost and where the loss is occurring. The importance of this is fundamental to the defect elimination process in implementing the maintenance process as well  as in guiding<br><br>
WO 2004/070526	PCT/US2004/001S34<br>
35<br>
resources and efforts in other asset support groups. "Loss" in this context is defined as the amount of product lost (or sometimes, deferred) over time and can be expressed as a volume and/or revenue equivalent In one embodiment of die invention, a choke model tool provides visual and/or data output that<br>
5 	shows what the status of the "choke" points in the system are, as seen in Fig. 10. The choke points can, for example, be displayed in green, which indicates that the point is junctional and working fine, or in red, which indicates a problem. Examples of reasons for a red choke point can include process or emergency shutdown, unit conditions that restrict production throughput, or<br>
10 	not all of the production facilities are available. The choke model tool can show various areas in the process or facilities simultaneously, allowing for an overall view of the production process and identification of problems that have occurred at choke points.<br>
[0083] Once the overall plant loss is known, the next most important<br>
15 	piece of decision-making information that is required to take relevant action in the LOS model is the determination of the cause of loss. The cause of loss may have the root cause stem from various plant systems and equipment or a combination thereof. This information can be arrived at from two or more alternative paths, such as for example: manual logs of shutdown incidents and<br>
20 	the reason for loss recorded by the operator or maintenance staff; or from the control system real time. Each method can have validity in use and can be complimentary sources of loss causation information.<br>
[0084] The present invention also provides in one embodiment a web enabled loss causation evaluation process.   The recording of loss causation<br>
25 	can be made possible through a shutdown incident reporting process, which is performed manually through a web-enabled system as illustrated for one example in Fig.11 The shutdown incident reporting (SIR) process can have several functions: administration. which allows the shutdown incident report<br><br>
WO 2004/070526	PCT/US2004/001534<br>
template to be altered; new SIR, which allows for the creation of a new SIR entry, root cause analysis; maintenance strategy update, which allows for an enterprise to change its strategies based upon knowledge captured; preventative   maintenance   amendment;   technical   change;   and   report<br>
5 	generation. Fig. 11 also shows that one can filter SIRs by a variety of means and the SIRs and their respective data can be displayed to a user in a reader friendly format such as a table.<br>
[0085] Operations staff typically records each incident that results in a loss of production from the asset to capture the time, duration, reason for<br>
10 	shutdown, location, product lost, revenue lost and other pertinent information. This library of shutdown incidents is then analyzed and presented in several forms to support actions made by the operations and maintenance staff in eliminating future causes of loss. Any significant losses may require specific root cause failure investigations and actions taken to resolve the problems.<br>
15 	These are linked to the LOS model for the maintenance function to demonstrate the management of defect elimination. The shutdown incident register provides details, including but not limited to, the date the shutdown incident was raised, the loss category attributable, the name of the people who were sent the shutdown incident report, the source location of the asset, the<br>
20	time the asset is down, the time when the asset came back online, the production lost, the cost, a cause category, whether or not it is an independent service contractor loss, which asset is responsible and to what complex the loss is to be attributed, an explanation of the problem including factors that may have  contributed to the problem, what department is functionally<br>
25 	responsible for the asset, the fault found after a root cause analysis, the corrective action taken, the name of the asset focal point any outstanding action that needs to be taken, review status, close out status, and so on.<br>
[0086] In this way, key steps in the maintenance management process and<br><br>
WO 2004/070526,	PCT/US2004/001S34<br>
the facilities engineering processes are linked back to the cause of product loss. The processes linked to the source of loss incident include the root cause failure analysis (RCFA), maintenance strategy revisions as a result of maintenance changes to prevent future loss, maintenance task changes and <br>
5 	technical engineering changes to the physical plant design. The overall process provides the organization with a complete management-of-change process that is fully auditable.<br>
[0087] The operations support teams can also increase their level of understanding in the magnitude, source and nature of production losses and <br>
10    	thereby improve the effectiveness of the organization in managing the business performance.<br>
[0088] To compliment the loss causation process, similar information can be generated from the data in the plant process control systems as shown in Fig. 12. This figure shows a graph of downtime contributors for a user-<br>
15 	defined period of time and the corresponding production losses. Real time data can be extracted and processed through specific algorithms to deliver loss causation and plant downtime information automatically.<br>
[0089] The present invention, in one embodiment, provides real time<br>
equipment performance analysis. A further level in the process of real time I<br>
20     performance monitoring is done at equipment level. This is based on an<br>
understanding of the criticality of key items of equipment or systems in the<br>
delivery of uptime performance, such as gas compression in the case of an oil<br>
and gas production asset  In the example shown in Fig. 13, the engineering<br>
knowledge of the design and operating envelopes of a gas compression<br>
25     system is married with real time process data to deliver a real time depiction<br>
of compression performance.   The representative graph shows the relation<br>
between suction pressure and gas flow for a specific compressor that is<br>
chosen by a user through the interface provided.   The raw data behind the<br><br>
WO 2004/070526<br><br>
38<br><br>
PCT/US2004/00I534<br><br>
compressor efficiency are also shown. Any excursion from normal operation or from the point of optimal performance can be registered in the production efficiency model as a loss in product The importance of this monitoring process is in identifying the relative impact of performance deviations on <br>
 5    	production loss and associated revenue.<br>
[0090] The present invention also provides in  one  embodiment an<br>
integrated management process.     A facet of real time  operations and<br>
maintenance support is the ability to link the business support processes and<br>
associated decision-making information into an integrated business model,<br>
10    	which acts as a guidance system for response to operational problems and<br>
variances  from normal  operation.  For  example,  a  link  is  made  from<br>
identification of product loss at facility or plant level to the cause or source of<br>
the product loss through to the follow-up actions required to solve the<br>
problem and determine the root cause failure mechanism. The integration of<br>
15      	business processes can be made both in process and information/action links<br>
as well as in integration of support function staff located in geographically<br>
remote places.  Fig. 14 shows an overview display screen demonstrating the<br>
linkage of business processes and real time performance analysis tools to the<br>
asset infrastructure.    A user can select an infrastructure from within the<br>
20     	process and view it with this tool.  In this representation the assets of an oil<br>
field are displayed. Each asset can then be selected to see further data.<br>
[0091] An illustrative example is provided to show an application of the present invention. In an oil or gas asset, such as shown in Fig. 14, the production from one of the producing wells can experience an increase in <br>
25 	water production, thereby increasing the water and salt content of fluids entering the overall system. Various devices such as wellbore probes or surface water treatment vessels may indicate the increase in water production. Salt contained in the produced fluid can precipitate in the processing vessels<br><br>
WO 2004/070526	PCT/US2004/001534<br>
and production lines. Salt deposits can interfere with readings such as flow measurement or liquid level indicators in vessels. Entrained salt can be carried over with the gas stream to the gas gathering pipelines, gas processing equipment that may service multiple producing wells such as compressors,<br>
5 	dryers and gas treating systems, into the gas sales line and to the distributions system or end user, such as a power generating plant<br>
[0092] In this example, a reservoir engineer assessing the situation in the traditional manner would determine whether the water production could damage the formation or reduce ultimate hydrocarbon recovery.    If no<br>
10 	production damage is expected, the reservoir engineer may see no need for corrective action. An operator on the production platform may notice an increase in water, but if the facility can handle the additional fluid, he may likewise see no problem. A technician may notice that the salinity of die produced fluids has increased and may take local action to avoid the salting<br>
15 	up of instruments, or may question the validity of readings such as the increased liquid level in a water knockout vessel. An increased liquid level can increase the amount of salt and liquid carryover with the produced gas stream, which can collect in the pipeline between the production platform and one of the common compression/treating platforms.  A production engineer<br>
20 	may notice that a gas compressor on the compression/treating platform is operating at reduced RPM and under higher load than expected, but since still within acceptable ranges, may dismiss it An operator overseeing the gas sales line may notice that throughput is less than expected, but is within his alarm limits so he is not concerned. Wanting to minimize operating expenses,<br>
25 	the gas sales line operator may not add any additional compression. The end user may receive the minimum volume of gas for his facility, and might complain within his organization, but cannot seem to acTheve greater flow from the gas sales line, and only hopes that he can make it through his shift<br><br>
WO 2004/070526	PCT/US2004/001534<br>
40<br>
without any disturbances.<br>
[0093] The occurrences in this example are the result of increased water<br>
production from a single well that is being carried over and collecting in the<br>
pipeline    between    the    production    platform    and    the     common<br>
5    	compression/treating platform.     However, the increased salt content is<br>
unknowingly coating the internals of the compressor. Either fee slugging of<br>
water from the pipeline between the production platform and the common<br>
compression/treating platform, or the salt buildup within the compressor, or a<br>
combination of both, could lead to the shut down and/or equipment failure on<br>
10       the    common    compression/treating    platform.	The    loss    of   the<br>
compression/treating platform can lead to flow surges and possible shut down<br>
of the sales pipeline and also of the end user facility, possibly leading to<br>
further equipment failure.   Due to the restricted throughput on the system,<br>
producing wells, compression/treating platforms and other assets would need<br>
15    	to be curtailed or shut down. Equipment failures and production interruptions<br>
such as these can result in significant economic loss and to an increase in<br>
safety related incidents.<br>
[0094] The present invention as applied to this example could have pulled the various seemingly unrelated issues into a common system overseeing the <br>
20    	overall process.  The* data such as increased water and salinity, higher liquid levels and reduced compressor efficiency could be analyzed together rather than separately. Historical data and logic rules could be considered and may have warned of a possible salt buildup within the compressor, due to its altered operating conditions, resulting in a relatively minor maintenance <br>
25    action such as water washing the compressor internals. The present invention, through aspects such as choke point analysis and analysis involving multiple variables, could have alerted users of the potential domino effect that was possible and warned of potential operational disruptions from one or more<br><br>

single point failures.<br>
[0095] One example of real time process asset management is shown schematically in Fig. 15. Using data gathered from assets such as devices in the plant or production process and interpreting historical data with an expert <br>
5 	system, alerts can be sent to persons in the enterprise that are responsible for those assets. The expert system is made up of rule sets that are based upon knowledge gained either by those working within the enterprise or from outside sources such as vendors. With this system, those responsible for assets are notified of problems or potential problems and can take corrective<br>
10    or preventative action.<br>
[0096] One example of real time asset management is shown schematically in Fig. 16. This example monitors and controls the production process, using data gathered from assets such as devices in the plant or production process, and interpreting historical data with an expert system, to<br>
15     generate and send reports to persons in the enterprise who are responsible for<br>
those assets. _ The expert system is made up of rule sets that are based upon<br>
knowledge such as equipment and system performance curves, operation loss<br>
data, and reservoir and plant capacities, gained either by those working within the enterprise or from outside sources such as vendors.   With this system, <br>
20    those responsible for assets are notified of problems or potential problems and<br>
can take corrective or preventative action.<br>
[0097] One   example   of   real   time   asset   optimization   is   shown<br>
schematically in Fig. 17. This example of optimization of a plant process uses<br>
data gathered from assets such as devices in the plant or production process<br>
25    and interprets historical data with an expert system to generate and send<br>
reports to persons in the enterprise who are responsible for those assets.  The<br>
expert system is made up of rule sets that are based upon knowledge such as<br>
process simulation mode] data (dynamic or steady state), process engineering<br><br>
WO 2004/070526	PCT/US2004/001534<br>
model data, and the like, gained either by those working within the enterprise or from outside sources such as vendors. With this system, those responsible for assets are notified of production variances and production optimization opportunities. Once notified of a deviation, proper optimization action can be<br>
5     taken.<br>
[0098] One example of real time asset optimization is shown schematically in Fig. 18. This example monitors performance using data gathered from assets such as people, work processes, costs, and the like and interpreting data with an expert system, to generate and send reports to<br>
10 	persons in the enterprise who are responsible for those assets. The expert system is made up of rule sets that are based upon knowledge such as enterprise system databases which are updated by group functions, functional system databases on group software applications, and functional group performance models and plans, gained either by those working within the<br>
15 enterprise or from outside sources such as vendors. With this system, those responsible for assets are notified of performance variances, trends, status and the like. Once notified, proper performance resolution action can be taken.<br>
[0099] An exemplary traffic light system definition is shown in Fig. 19. Each traffic light color (red, yellow, and green) can be customized to meet the<br>
20 	particular needs of a»plant. In this figure the availability and efficiency from the start of a gas day is defined. The real time operations process can include a guidance or navigation capability that highlights where product loss or product variance due to equipment efficiency problem has occurred. The process can include a traffic light indication of plant status where green<br>
25 	indicates normal operation, yellow indicates a drop in facility or equipment performance and red indicates a severe drop in performance and/or shutdown of the facility or equipment This allows the authorized operations support staff, particularly the technical teams and leadership, to focus on the important<br><br>
WO 2004/070526	PCT/US 2004/0015J4<br>
plant performance issues as they occur. Information of this nature is normally available only to operations staff through the plant process control system and not accessible to the organization as a whole. An important purpose of the traffic light process is to raise the awareness of the organization, other than<br>
5  	front line operations staff of the plant downtime and efficiency problems to<br>
generate the right response and effort of support<br>
[0100] Where decisions are made and where support is accessed are important features of the present invention. An important function of real time operations and maintenance support is the ability to deliver technical and<br>
10 	commercial solutions to operational issues and abnormal events from anywhere in the world on a continuous 24 hours/day and 7 days/week basis. It is desirable to have the ability to use finite specialist and subject matter expertise in specific locations for asset support to any location worldwide in the most economic way. The best use of enterprise resources can thus be<br>
15 	brought to any operating problem without the need to mobilize or transport scarce personnel.<br>
[0101] An exemplary overall process to support an operation according to one embodiment is shown in Fig. 20. It covers the implementation of the maintenance and operations business plans at system and equipment level, the<br>
20 	work management and planning, and the technical and operational support resource experts involvement, as well as the plant performance monitoring and decision support information feedback loop. In real time, data from assets such as pipelines, compressors, etc. can be received by a technical support center and remote locations via an access portal, such as for example,<br>
25 	an Internet link. Data from the remote locations can also be seen by the technical support center and other locations allowing for a complete line of sight throughout an organization.<br>
[0102] In one embodiment, a real time operations interactive schematic<br><br>
WO 2004/070526	PCT/US2004/001334<br>
environment is provided for use with the portal. This comprises a software program that allows user to interactively create a process schematic via drag and drop smart graphical objects. The program can be easy to use, menu/wizard driven, and require minimal amount of training to create a<br>
5     schematic.<br>
[0103] A process schematic representing a plant or a facility can be developed by selecting smart graphical icons (SGI) from a template and dropping them on to a drawing such as, for example, Microsoft Visio. When an SGI is dragged and dropped on a drawing, the user is prompted to link the <br>
10 	SGI to a database that contains information about the particular object Once this link is established, the program can dynamically retrieve the information from the database and display it, such as via a simple mouse move over and/or a mouse click on the drawing object. The template desirably has a number of pre-defined smart graphical icons such as pumps, vessels, compressors, <br>
15     	columns, pipelines, buildings, and so on.<br>
[0104] Each SGI has a series of connection points that can be connected via a pipeline object to other objects. These pipeline objects show the connectivity between objects and indicate direction of flow. The pipeline object can also be linked to a database object There are desirably several <br>
20 	special SGIs in the template that enable the user to link the object to a specific or desired attribute in the database such as flow, temperature, or pressure and display the attribute on the drawing.<br>
[0105] Once a drawing is created, it can be saved and retrieved at a later date. The drawing can also be saved in an accessible means, such as in a web<br>
25 	enabled format and published on a web server. The drawing then can be viewed via a web browser, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer. This allows other users to view the drawing and dynamically visualize the real time information from a database.    In this example a web-enabled system is<br><br>

discussed, the present invention is not limited to this type of access system and can be linked by other means, such as hard wired, wireless, microwave, satellite, or other communications systems can be used.<br>
[0106] In one embodiment of the invention the end-user has a designated<br>
5 	starting web portal screen or home page that allows the user to quickly access the various functions of the system, including but not limited to, asset performance metrics, leadership team, maintenance, supply chain management, planning, well operation, human resources, emergency response, field team, facilities, engineering and construction, and so on, as<br>
10     seen in Fig. 21. In this example a representative oil field is displayed in the center of the display. Each asset of the field can be further explored<br>
