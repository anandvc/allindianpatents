METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR ALLOCATING SUBCARRIERS IN A<br>
BROADBAND WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM USING<br>
MULTIPLE CARRIERS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to a method of allocating<br>
communication resources in a broadband wireless communication system, and in<br>
particular, to a method and apparatus for allocating subcarriers in a broadband<br>
wireless communication system using multiple carriers.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
The first MCM (Multi-Carrier Modulation) systems appeared in the late<br>
1950's for military high frequency radio communication. OFDM (Orthogonal<br>
Frequency Division Multiplexing), a special case of MCM with overlapping<br>
orthogonal subcarriers, was initially developed in the 1970's. With OFDM, a<br>
serial symbol sequence is converted to parallel symbol sequences and modulated<br>
to mutually orthogonal subcarriers before transmission. Because of difficulty in<br>
orthogonal modulation between multiple carriers, OFDM has limited practical<br>
application to communication systems.<br>
However, in 1971, Weinstein, et. al. proposed an OFDM scheme that<br>
applies DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform) to parallel data transmission as an<br>
efficient modulation/demodulation process, thereby creating a driving force for<br>
OFDM development. In addition, the introduction of a guard interval further<br>
reduced adverse effects of multi-path propagation and delay spread in<br>
communication systems. Although complex hardware created an obstacle to the<br>
widespread use of OFDM, recent advances in digital signal processing technology<br>
including  FFT   (Fast   Fourier   Transform)   and   IFFT   (Inverse   Fast   Fourier<br>
Transform) have enabled practical OFDM implementation.<br>
OFDM can be implemented for digital data communications such as DAB (Digital Audio Broadcasting), digital TV broadcasting, WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network), and W-ATM (Wireless Asynchronous Transfer Mode). OFDM also exhibits high frequency use efficiency, reduces effects of ISI (Inter-Symbol Interference) by guard intervals, and is robust against multi-path fading. Therefore, OFDM provides optimum transmission efficiency for high-speed data transmission.<br>
OFDM-based multiple access techniques are divided into OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access) and FH (Frequency Hopping)-OFDM. FH-OFDM is a combination of FH and OFDM. Both OFDMA and FH-OFDM commonly seek to achieve frequency diversity gain by distributing data tones across the total frequency band. OFDMA is a scheme of transmitting each OFDM symbol across a plurality of subcarriers that form one subchannel.<br>
OFDMA applications for broadband wireless communication systems include systems defined in the IEEE 802.16a and IEEE 802.16e standards. Such OFDMA systems adopt a 2048-point FFT, for examplethat divides 1702 tones into 166 pilot tones and 1536 data tones. The 1536 data tones are further divided into 32 subchannels for allocation to users, each subchannel including 48 data tones. OFDMA is a multiple access technique where the frequency domain is divided into subchannels, each having a plurality of subcarriers. The time domain is divided into a plurality of time slots, and the subchannels are allocated to users.<br>
The IEEE 802.16a or IEEE 802.16e system divides a broad frequency band of 10-MHz into subchannels on the frequency domain only. About 1600 to 1700 subcarriers are allocated to one OFDM symbol using 2048 points FFT.<br><br>
Thus, the number of cells can be increased depending on subcarrier allocation. Yet, only about 40 cells are identifiable when subchannels are formed by subcarrier allocation in the prior art, considering collision between channels in a multi-cell environment. To facilitate deployment of a broadband wireless network, the number of identifiable cells should be about 100. In this context, a conventional subchannel/subcarrier allocation method in an OFDMA scheme is limited in the number of cells it can service.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a method and apparatus for allocating subcarriers to increase cells in number in a broadband wireless communication system using multiple carriers.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described herein below with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following description, well-known functions or constructions are not described in detail since they would obscure the invention in unnecessary detail.<br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a transmitter in an OFDMA communication system according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 1, the transmitter includes a CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) inserter 101 for generating CRC bits by which transmission errors are checked, an encoder 103 for encoding data bits, a symbol mapper 105 for carrying out symbol modulation in a predetermined modulation scheme, and a subchannel allocator 107 for allocating subchannels to users using cell identification sequences and subchannel sequences in a manner that maximizes the number of identifiable cells, described later in detail.<br>
The transmitter further includes a serial-to-parallel converter (SPC) 109 for converting serial modulated symbols to parallel signals, a pilot symbol inserter 111, an IFFT 113 for IFFT-processing the parallel modulated signals of the subchannels, a parallel-to-serial converter (PSC) 115 for converting the parallel modulated signals to a serial symbol sequence, a guard interval inserter 117 for inserting a guard interval into the serial symbol sequence, a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) 119, and an RF (Radio Frequency) processor 121.<br>
In operation, upon generation of user data bits and control data bits (hereinafter, collectively referred to as information data bits) for transmission, the CRC inserter 101 inserts CRC bits into the information data bits and the encoder<br><br>
103 encodes the output of the CRC inserter 101 according to a predetermined coding method which may include turbo coding or convolutional coding with a predetermined code rate.<br>
The symbol mapper 105 modulates the coded bits into symbols according to the predetermined modulation scheme, such as QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying) or 16QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation). The subchannel allocator 107 then allocates a subchannel to the modulated symbols.<br>
Subchannel allocation is performed using a cell identification sequence and a subchannel sequence according to an embodiment of the present invention, as described later in detail. The SPC 109 parallelizes the serial modulated symbols to which the subchannel and its corresponding frequency band have been allocated. The pilot inserter 111 then inserts pilot symbols into the parallel modulation symbols.<br>
Next, the IFFT 113 performs an N-point IFFT on the output signal of the pilot symbol inserter 111. The PSC 115 then converts the IFFT signals into a serial signal. The guard interval inserter 117 inserts a predetermined guard interval into the serial signal. The guard interval is used to eliminate interference between the previous OFDM symbol transmitted in the previous OFDM symbol time and the current OFDM symbol transmitted in the current OFDM symbol time when transmitting an OFDM symbol sequence.<br>
The DAC 119 converts the output of the guard interval inserter 117 to an analog signal. The RF processor 121, including a filter and a front end unit, processes the analog signal to an RF signal transmittable over the air and transmits the RF signal to a radio network via a transmit (Tx) antenna 123<br>
Subchannel allocation according to an embodiment of the present invention takes place in the subchannel allocator 107 that increases the number of<br><br>
identifiable cells by use of the subchannel allocator 107.<br>
Before describing the subchannel allocating method of the present invention, a channel structure for the OFDMA communication system to which the present invention is applied will be described briefly.<br>
The OFDMA communication system transmits parallel transmission data across a plurality of mutually orthogonal subcarriers. The subcarriers include data subcarriers for delivering data and pilot subcarriers for channel estimation. One subchannel includes a plurality of subcarriers. The subchannel is a basic unit of serving one subscriber, and each subscriber transmits/receives data on at least one subchannel.<br>
Therefore, in the case where one subscriber occupies one subchannel, the OFDMA communication system can accommodate as many subscribers as available subchannels. Each subcarrier is labeled with an index or subcarrier index indicating the logical position of the subcarrier. With this channel structure, the number of cells defined within each base station and inter-cell interference can be controlled by allocating subcarriers to subchannels appropriately in terms of subcarrier position.<br>
In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, subcarriers are indexed using an error correction code called a Reed-Solomon Sequence (RS Seq), and then allocated in relation to their logical positions so as to minimize collision between subchannels. The RS Seq is a coding method that allows multiple error correction in high-speed data transmission. The basic principle of the RS Seq is well known and thus its description is not provided herein.<br>
FIG. 2 is a block diagram of a subcarrier allocating apparatus in a broadband wireless communication system using multiple carriers according to an<br><br>
embodiment of the present invention. The subcarrier allocating apparatus is implemented as the subchannel allocator 107 of FIG. 1 including a subcarrier group generator 107a, a cell separator 107b, and a subcarrier allocator 107c.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, the subcarrier group generator 107a groups subcarriers of a cell into a plurality of subcarrier groups, each of the plurality including at least one successive subcarrier.The subcarrier grouping will be described later with reference to FIG. 3. The cell separator 107b generates a sequence for cell identification using cell identification information and a plurality of Reed-Solomon sequences. The subcarrier allocator 107c allocates a plurality of the subcarriers into a subchannel using the sequence for cell identification and information related with the subcarrier groups.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the cell identification sequences are so designed that given Q successive subcarriers in each subcarrier group, Q2 cells can be identified. In addition, subchannel sequences are designed to allocate up to Q subchannels in a cell.<br>
Therefore, the numbers of identifiable cells and subchannels available to the entire cells can be raised to the second power of those available with conventional technology.<br>
Hereinafter, the subcarrier allocation method, the cell identification sequences, and the subchannel sequences according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates the subcarrier allocation method in the broadband wireless communication system using multiple carriers according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, total subcarriers 210 allocated to one cell are grouped<br><br>
into (Q-1) subcarrier groups 220, each group including Q successive subcarriers 210. An RS Seq indicating the logical positions of subcarriers is defined over a Galois Field, GF(Q). GF(Q) is closed for certain operations and has Q elements {0, 1, 2, . . ., Q-1}. If GF(Q) is closed for a specific operation, the result of the operation falls within the same GF(Q).<br>
When Q is a prime number, addition and multiplication over GF(Q) are defined by Equation (1):<br><br>
and Equation (2):<br><br>
where the operator "mod" represents modulation.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, GF(Q) is closed for the addition and multiplication defined as Equation (1) and Equation (2). A cell identification sequence Sm (m is a cell number) defined over GF(Q) is a sequence determined by the specific cell number, for use in determining the logical positions of subcarriers 210 for each subchannel. In accordance with the preferred embodiment, a subchannel sequence Sm,β is generated using the cell identification sequence and a parameter β for each subchannel to determine the subcarriers positions for each subchannel. (Q-l) subcarriers 210 selected from the different subcarrier groups 220 preferably form one subchannel (Q=7 in FIG. 3). It should be noted that the number of the subcarriers 210 per subchannel may increase or decrease.<br><br>
According to an embodiment of the present invention, a subcarrier index is determined by Equation (3):<br><br>
where Subcarrier(i) is the subcarrier index, i is the index or group index of a subcarrier group 220, and S(i) is an (i+l)th element of the subchannel sequence Sm,β, representing a subcarrier 210 in the subcarrier group 220. The group index i=0, 1,.. ., Q-2. Once Sm,β is defined, a subchannel is defined for a cell.<br>
For example, if a total of 42 subcarriers 210 labeled with subcarrier indexes {0, 1, 2, . . ., 41} are grouped into six subcarrier groups 220, as illustrated in FIG. 3, six subcarriers 210 for one of subchannel #0 to subchannel #6 can be determined using a subchannel sequence Sm,β of length 6. GivenSm,β={3, 2, 6, 4, 5, 1}, {7*0+3, 7*1+2, . . ., 7*5+1} are computed for subcarrier index i=0, 1, . . ., 5 in each subchannel, by Eq. (3). Thus, the subchannel is made up of subcarriers with indexes {3, 9, 20, 25, 33, 36}.<br>
Hereinbelow, the cell identification sequence Sm and the subchannel sequence Sm,β will be described in detail.<br>
The present invention preferably defines the cell identification sequence Sm using cell identification information and a plurality of sequences. The cell identification information can be a cell ID for example, and the plurality of sequences are base sequences S0 and S1 defined in the present invention. While more base sequences can be defined, the following description is made with two base sequences.<br>
The base sequences S0 and S1 are defined in Equation (4) as:<br><br><br>
where a is a primitive element of GF(Q). For Q=7, a6 mod 7=1 and thus a=3, an element of GF(Q). Thus,<br><br>
The elements of these base sequences can be cyclically shifted.<br>
The cell identification sequence Sm for an mth cell is given in Equation (5) as:<br><br>
where it can be defined that m=c0+Qc1. The quotient and remainder of m mod Q are c1 and c0, respectively. Here, m denotes the cell identification information, that is, the cell number (cell ID). c0 and c1 are cell identification factor and can substitute into each other.<br>
For example, when Q=7, c0 and c1 each range from 0 to 6. The number of all possible combinations of c0 and c1 is Q2 since Q values are available for each of c0 and c1 hence, for Q=7, 49 cells can be separated. Hence, according to Eq. (5), Q2 cells can be separated<br>
The subchannel sequence Sm,β used to set subchannels for the wth cell is computed by adding a predetermined offset β, as shown in Equation (6):<br><br><br>
where β ranges from 0 to (Q-1). Hence, up to Q subchannels can be allocated to one cell.<br>
According to the above-described method, up to Q2 cells can be identified using the cell identification sequence Sm defined as Equation (5) and up to Q subchannels can be allocated to one cell using the subchannel sequence Sm,β defined as Equation (6). Consequently, the total number of subchannels available to the entire cells is up to Q3.<br>
The thus-derived cell identification sequence performs so well that at most two collisions may occur between adjacent cells. If c1=0 for every cell in Equation (5) (i.e. the number of cells is kept at the conventional level), Sm becomes a typical RS Seq. In this case, at most one collision occurs between adjacent cells.<br><br><br>
Table 2 illustrates cell identification sequences for a plurality of base stations on the assumption that over GF(7), a=3, S0={3, 2, 6, 4, 5, 1} and S1={2, 4,1,2,4,1}.<br><br>
While for Q=7, up to 49 (Q2) cells S0 to S48 can be identifiable, Table 2 illustrates only a part of them for the sake of simplicity.<br>
Table 1 illustrates the subchannel sequences for base station #1 (m=1). A comparison between the subchannel sequences of Table 1 and subchannel sequences #0 of other cells illustrated in Table 2 reveals that, at most, one collision occurs when c1=0 in the cells For example, between S0 to S6 of Table 2 and the subchannel sequences of Table 1. At most, two collisions occur, for example between S7 to S13 of Table 2 and the subchannel sequences of Table 1.<br>
While Equation (5) and Equation (6) are used as the cell identification sequence and the subchannel sequence, respectively, they can be modified to achieve cell identification sequence and subchannel sequence in a different manner. To do so, the cell identification sequence and the subchannel sequence are computed by Equation (7):<br><br><br>
where S' serves as the cell identification sequence and S" serves as the subchannel sequence. In this case, there may be no difference in the number of collisions between subchannels, compared to the above original method. It should be noted that other methods are also available. In another embodiment of the present invention defined by Equation(7), a subcarrier index is determined by Equation(3) or following Equation(9).<br>
While (Q-l) subcarriers are allocated to each subchannel in the above embodiment, the number of subcarriers per subchannel is not limited to the value. If the number of subcarriers per subchannel is less than (Q-l), associated sequences are truncated to be as short as needed. For example, if the number of subcarriers per subchannel is set to (Q-M), the base sequences S0 and S1 are modified as shown by Equation (8):<br><br>
The first (Q-M) subcarriers of the original sequences are used. In the same manner, if the number of subcarriers per subchannel is set to be larger than (Q-1), as many subcarriers as desired can be achieved by repeating the base sequences. If each subchannel includes 2x(Q-1) subcarriers, the base sequences S0 and S1 occur twice by repetition.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates allocation of 42 subchannels to 7 subchannels over GF(7). Referring to FIG. 3, two collisions occur between subchannels of cell 2<br><br>
and cell 3, indicated by a dotted square. Subchannels collide, at most, once between cell 1 and cell 2.<br>
The maximum number of identifiable cells needs to be increased to facilitate base station installation in a wireless communication system with a frequency reuse rate of 1. To do so, subcarriers can be allocated, not for one OFDM symbol, but for a plurality of OFDM symbols. However, this method limits the frame structure by the number of OFDM symbols used for subcarrier allocation.<br>
The present invention can increase the number of symbols as a basic subcarrier allocation unit up to the second power of that possible by conventional methods, when needed.<br>
Given Q(Q-1) subcarriers, if N subcarrier groups are defined using QxN subcarriers in each OFDM symbol and (Q-1)/N OFDM symbols are used, the subcarrier indexes are computed by Equation (9):<br><br>
In Eq. (9), when Q=7 and N=2, the group index i of a subcarrier group 220 ranges from 0 to 5 (i.e. from 0 to Q-2) and the symbol index n is 0 or 1. Here, i/N represents a maximum integer less than or equal to i/N. The subcarrier index of subchannel #0 for base station #1 is 11 for n=0 and i=3, 13 for n=1 and i=1, and 10 for n=2 and i=0.<br>
FIGs. 4A and 4B illustrate a method of allocating subcarriers to subchannels according to Eq. (9) when Q=7 and N=2 and 3, respectively.<br><br>
Subcarrier allocation is performed to carry two symbols in FIG. 4A and three symbols in FIG. 4B. As described earlier, the subcarrier allocation illustrated in FIG. 3 leads to, at most, two subcarrier collisions between different subchannels of different cells. Subchannel indexing based on Eq. (9), when using sequences defined over GF(Q), results in no more than one subcarrier collision between subchannels in every Q cells #0 to #(Q-1), #Q to #(2Q-1), and #2Q to #(3Q-1).<br>
In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the number of identifiable cells is increased to the second power compared to conventional methods using limited subcarrier resources in an OFDMA communication system. In addition, when as the maximum number of conventionally identifiable cells are kept, cell numbering of the present invention limits the number of inter-subchannel collision occurrences to up to 1 without structural modifications.<br>
