A.     In vitro TEST SYSTEM: (Cell free assay)<br>
The assay determines the binding of soluble human ICAM-1 to immobilized human LFA-1.<br>
LFA-1 is purified from JY cells, a human lymphoblastoid B cell-line, by immunoaffinity<br>
chromatography analogously as described by Dustin et a/., J. Immunol. 148, 2654-2663,<br>
1992. ICAM-1 mouse CK fusion protein (ICAM-1) is produced using the baculovirus system<br>
as described by Weitz-Schmidt et a/., Anal. Biochem. 238,184-190,1996.<br>
Purified LFA-1 is diluted 1:20 in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 2 mM MgCI2, pH<br>
7.4 and coated onto microtiter plates (Nunc) at 37° for 3 hours. Plates are blocked with 1%<br>
heat-treated bovine serum albumin in PBS for 2 hours at 37° followed by a washing step<br>
using PBS, 2 mM MgCI2,1% fetal calf serum, pH 7.4 (assay buffer). Compounds of the<br>
present invention (10 mM solution in DMSO) are diluted in assay buffer and added to the<br><br>
plates. Biotinylated recombinant ICAM-1 in assay buffer (6 jog/ml) is added and allowed to bind at 37° for one hour. After incubation, wells are washed with assay buffer. Streptavidin-peroxidase diluted 1:5000 in assay buffer is added and incubated for 45 min at 37°. Plates are washed with assay buffer and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt substrate solution is added to each well. The reaction is stopped after 20 minutes and bound ICAM-1 is determined by measuring the optical density at 405 nm in a microplate reader.<br>
In this assay the compounds of the present invention exhibit activity, e.g. the compounds of the present invention inhibit adhesion of LFA-1 to ICAM-1 with an IC50 £ 50 p,M, preferably 0.05 to 50 ^M. The compounds of examples 13 and 14 are preferred compounds of the present invention and show IC50 values of 0.43 or 0.09 ^iM, respectively, in this assay. We have surprisingly found that compounds of formula I, wherein R3 is substituted phenyl show higher IC50 values in such LFA-1 in vitro TEST SYSTEM than compounds of formula I, wherein R3 is unsubstituted phenyl.<br>
B.     In vivo TEST SYSTEM: Allergic Contact Dermatitis (ACD)<br>
Groups of 8 female NMRI mice are sensitized on the shaved abdomen with 50 ^l of oxazolone (2% in acetone) and challenged with 10 \i\ of 0.2% oxazolone on the inner surface of the right ear 7 days later. The unchallenged left ears serve as normal controls and dermatitis is evaluated from the individual differences in auricular weights, which are taken as a measure of inflammatory swelling 24 hours after the challenge. Dermatitis is evaluated in test- and control groups. The test groups are treated with the test compounds orally (2 hours after challenge), the controls are treated similarly with the vehicles alone. For oral administration the compounds are administered in an oil in H20 emulsion. The data of the test- and the vehicle-treated control groups are statistically analysed by ANOVA followed by Dunnet T-test (normal distribution or data) or by H and U-test, respectively. When administered p.o. at a dose of from 0.03 to 30 mg/kg, the compounds of the present invention inhibit the elicitation phase of allergic contact dermatitis. For example, compound of Example 14 has an inhibiting effect in this assay of &gt;30% when administered p.o. at a dose of 0.03 mg/kg.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are therefore expected to be useful in the treatment of diseases or disorders mediated by interactions of LFA-1 with its ligands involved in cell adhesion, migration and activation. The compounds may be preferably useful for treatment<br><br>
of inflammatory conditions, allergic diseases or autoimmune diseases.

Examples of allergic conditions are allergic contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis or asthma. Rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, (systemic) lupus erythematosus, Sjogren' syndrome, alopecia areata, uveitis, lichen planus, pemphigus, bullous pemphigoid, epidermolysis bullosa or myasthenia gravis are examples of auto-immune mediated conditions.<br>
The compound of the present invention may also be used for prevention of acute and chronic rejection of alio- or xenografts, transplantation, host vs. graft or graft vs. host diseases, for the treatment of neoplastic diseases including metastasis of neoplastic or cancerous growth or cancer, AIDS and infectious diseases.

TEST Example<br>
Inhibition of allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) in vivo<br>
a. Method:<br>
Groups of 8 female mice are sensitized epicutaneously with 50 pi of 2% oxazolone on the shaved ventral abdomen (day 1) and challenged with 10 pi of 0.2% oxazolone on the inner surface of the right ear (day 8). The unchallenged left ears serve as normal controls and dermatitis is evaluated from the difference in pinnal weight which is taken as a measure of inflammatory swelling (day 9). In addition, activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO) serving as a measure of leukocyte influx in ear homogenates are determined as described by Bradley et al., J.lnvest.Dermatol; 78:206-209 (1982). The animals are treated orally 2 hours after challenge with the test compound of example 10. Activity is calculated as the percentage of inhibition of inflammatory auricular swelling and of MPO activity relative to animals treated with the vehicle alone. For comparison mice are treated intraperitoneally with 100 pi monoclonal anti-mouse LFA-1 antibody 1 hour before challenge and evaluated as described. b) Results<br>
Oral treatment with a single dose of 0.01-10.0 mg/kg of a compound of example 10 results in an inhibition of the inflammatory response by 40-50%. Inhibition of swelling compared with inhibition of MPO activity is observed. Treatment with 50-200 pg/mouse anti-LFA-1 antibody results in an inhibition by 34-56%.<br><br><br><br>
