				<td>ROTARY POWER UNIT<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is in the field of rotary power units and in particular it<br>
is concerned with a radial, positive displacement power unit suitable for use as a<br>
fluid displacing device, namely a pump or a compressor, or as an engine.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION AND PRIOR ART<br>
The term "power unit" as used herein in the specification and claims is used<br>
to collectively refer to pumps, compressors and engines.<br>
Radial power units have long been known. The general configuration with<br>
radial power units is a common shaft and one or more radially displaceabie pistons<br>
adapted for performing pumping or compressing work or for generating work in<br>
case of an engine.<br>
Among the advantages of radial power units is the essentially high volume<br>
stroke of the pistons within a relatively compact space. Furthermore, radial power<br>
units typically generate low noise level and require less maintenance than otherwise<br>
configured power units.<br>
Many of the heretofore known rotary power units, in particular pumps and<br>
compressors, comprise an eccentric shaft engageablc with one or more radially<br>
displaceabie pistons. A drawback of this arrangement is that the development of<br>
undesired forces in the system, resulting in low performance of the power unit.<br>
Even more so, where eccentric assemblies are used, there is need to provide some<br>
balancing means in order to reduce forces developing in the system, which apart<br>
from increasing wear of the system, they might eventually lead to rupture of<br>
essential components of the unit.<br><br>
Furthermore, prior art power units are typically of complex structure<br>
rendering them both non compact in size, heavy and being complex in their<br>
assembly. In addition, frequent maintenance is required owing to high wear of<br>
components and to lubrication requirements.<br>
Still a disadvantage of prior art is the necessity of providing some speed<br>
reducing means intermediate a pump or compressor and an engine supplying rotary<br>
motion thereto. This arrangement obviously requires more space, is heavier and<br>
requires more maintenance.<br>
A considerable disadvantage of prior art is low efficiency wherein<br>
essentially high rotational speed is required for delivering sufficient power or<br>
pumping/compressing volume, this owing mainly to a small ratio of piston diameter<br>
versus stroke.<br>
Another disadvantage of prior art power units is the necessity to provide<br>
lubrication which in itself requires special circulation means, frequent servicing and<br>
there is always a possibility of lubricant entering the fluid being pumped or<br>
compressed. Power units in which lubrication is required, are typically not suitable<br>
for supplying gasses for critical applications such as supply of compressed gasses,<br>
e.g. oxygen for medical purposes, or other gasses, e.g. for diving or welding or for<br>
other industrial purposes.<br>
Typically, a power unit is designed for a particular purpose such as a pump,<br>
a compressor or an engine and converting it from one function to another function<br>
is either practically impossible or, requires redesigning and changing of most of the<br>
essential components of the power unit, rendering it not cost effective. Even more<br>
so, a power unit is pre-designed to operate with fixed parameters such as fixed<br>
speed, diameter to stroke ratio, etc. These parameters are particularly fixed and are<br>
not variable, unless with some considerable modifications in the power unit.<br>
At times, it is desired to increase a working capacity of a power unit, i.e. to<br>
increase its volume of fluid displacement in case of a pump or compressor, or to<br>
incorporate several power units to operate in conjunction with one another. Prior art<br><br>
power units are not designed to allow stacking of similar such units to one another<br>
with complete modularity.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 2.345.125 discloses a high pressure hydraulic pump in<br>
which a central shaft rotates an eccentric octagonal thrust block made of hardened<br>
steel, against which a plurality of bronze plunger heads are in sliding contact for<br>
displacing of a piston member within a cylinder.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,541,781 discloses a rotary fluid pump comprising rotating<br>
rollers running along a circular track for successively depressing a plurality of lever<br>
arms which in turn operate pistons in a like number of pumps. In this patent the<br>
centrifugal forces developing in the system are used to depress the rollers against<br>
the lever arms.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,547,348 discloses a rotor fitted with a primary eccentric<br>
rotatable with a shaft and a secondary eccentric adjustable in position relative to the<br>
primary eccentric and a plurality of radial piston cartridges are radially disposed<br>
around the shaft This patent discloses stacking of such units however, transferring<br>
rotary motion between the stacked units is by a common shaft<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,634,777 discloses a radial piston machine wherein a rotor<br>
is formed with a primary eccentric rotatable around an axis and a secondary<br>
eccentric adjustable in position relative to the primary eccentric and a plurality of<br>
piston cartridges radially disposed around the axis. In this patent sliding friction<br>
shoes are provided for contacting the revolving eccentric.<br>
Other prior art patents are 2,789,515, 3,407,707, 3,490,683, 3,871,793,<br>
4,017,220, 5,035,221, 5,281,104,5,383,770 and 5,547,348.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved power unit<br>
which, on the one hand, significantly reduces or overcomes the drawbacks of prior<br>
art power units and, on the other hand, improves the overall performances of the<br>
power unit.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention there is provided a rotary power<br>
unit, comprising:<br>
a housing having an circular opening and a plurality of bores, each<br>
extending along a radial axis from a center of said opening;<br>
a nodular rotor mounted within the opening of the housing and coaxially<br>
rotatable within the opening; said nodular rotor comprising a plurality of nodes<br>
equally distributed along the bounding circle thereof, the number of nodes being an<br>
odd integer less than the number of bores in the housing;<br>
a plurality of replaceable cylinder modules, each fixedly receivable within a<br>
respective bore within the housing;<br>
each cylinder module comprising a piston slidable within a cylinder, a piston 1<br>
actuating member associated with each piston and a work unit associated with a<br>
cylinder head at a distal end the cylinder; each piston being displaceable along the<br>
radial axis between a Top Dead Center (TDC) and a Bottom Dead Center (BDC),<br>
the pistons being biased into said BDC;<br>
and wherein the nodular rotor is fitted with a radial thrust reducing<br>
arrangement for engagement with respective piston actuating members.<br>
The term "work unit" as used in the specification denotes a unit competent<br>
of performing work, e.g. a pumping unit, a compressing unit or a combustion<br>
chamber of an engine.<br>
As it will become apparent hereinafter, the rotary power unit in accordance<br>
with the present invention significantly reduces wear of its components and<br>
consequently reduces maintenance requirements of the components. The power<br>
unit provides improved overall efficiency and uses an essentially short stroke<br>
versus a large diameter piston with low revolutionary speed on the one hand and,<br>
on the other hand, an essentially low linear speed of the pistons with respect to the<br>
cylinder wall.<br>
The bottom surface of the piston actuators may be either flat, concave or<br>
convex, or may be of a complex shape comprising a combination of flat and arcuate<br><br>
segments. This arrangement is suitable for defining the up-stroke and down-stroke<br>
(these terms denote compression/suction displacement of the pistons in case of a<br>
pump or compressor or, discharge/intake displacement of the piston in case of an<br>
engine). This also permits control of the dwell time at the TDC of the piston which<br>
is an important parameter. In accordance with the present invention, within a single<br>
power unit, different piston actuators may be used wherein their bottom surfaces<br>
are either flat, concave, convex or a complex shape as above.<br>
The dwell angle d of the piston at the BDC, measured ir degrees of rotor<br>
rotation, is calculated by the formula:<br>
d&gt;(360°/n)*0.125<br>
where:<br>
d is the dwell angle measured in degrees and<br>
n is the number of nodes.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the piston is at the TDC when a<br>
corresponding node of the nodular rotor extends along the respective radial axis;<br>
and the piston is at its BDC when the respective node is angularly displaced by<br>
(180 o/n)-d/2 from said radial axis;<br>
wherein:<br>
n- is the number of nodes of the nodular rotor, and<br>
d- is the dwell angle between neighboring cylinders (measured in degrees)<br>
In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, the nodular<br>
rotor is associated with a shaft extending from the center of and perpendicular to'<br>
the plane of the nodular rotor and adapted for receiving or imparting rotary motion<br>
to or from the nodular rotor, alternatively. However, the nodular rotor may be<br>
driven by a shaft extending into the housing or, in case of several housings stacked<br>
on top of one another, the nodular rotor may be rotated by coupling means adapted<br>
for simultaneous rotation of the nodular rotors.<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the invention, the work unit is an assembly<br>
comprising one or more inlet valves and one or more outlet valves, and wherein<br><br>
rotary motion is imparted to the nodular rotor entailing radial displacement of the<br>
piston, thereby establishing a pump or compressor.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention the work unit is<br>
as assembly comprising a fuel supply nozzle, ignition and ignition timing<br>
arrangements, and gas exchange passages; wherein radial displacement of the<br>
pistons imparts rotary motion to the nodular rotor, thereby establishing a radial<br>
engine.<br>
There may also be a combined version of the above aspects, wherein the<br>
work unit of some of the cylinder modules is an assembly comprising one or more<br>
inlet valves and one or more outlet valves; and the work unit of the remaining<br>
cylinder modules is an assembly comprising a fuel supply nozzle, an ignition<br>
member and gas exchange passages.<br>
In accordance with a most preferred embodiment, the nodular rotor is<br>
associated with a speed reducing assembly. In accordance with one application, the<br>
speed reducing assembly is a planetary gear train, said planetary gear train<br>
comprising a sun gear fixed to the shaft, at least one planet gear rotatably supported<br>
by the housing, and a ring gear associated with the nodular rotor. In accordance<br>
with a different application, the speed reducing assembly is a planetary gear train,<br>
said planetary gear train comprising a sun gear fixed to the shaft, at least one planet<br>
gear rotatably fixed to the nodular rotor, and a ring gear fixed to the housing.<br>
The piston actuating member may be integral with or rigidly fixed to the<br>
piston, with a bottom surface of the piston actuating member adapted for<br>
engagement with the nodes of the nodular rotor. The radial distance between the<br>
piston and the piston actuator is preferable adjustable, thereby entailing adjusting<br>
the clearance of the piston within the cylinder.<br>
In order to reduce wear of mechanical components, to ensure smooth, quiet<br>
and efficient performance of the power unit, there is provided a radial thrust<br>
reducing arangement which in accordance with one embodiment is a roller fitted at<br>
each node, each roller being rotatable about an axle parallel to an axis of rotation of<br>
the nodular rotor.<br><br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment, the radial thrust reducing<br>
arrangement is a roller having a geared portion fitted on each node for engagement<br>
with a geared ring fixed within the opening of the housing, thus imparting the<br>
rollers positive rotation about their longitudinal axis. In accordance with this<br>
embodiment, the rollers are continuously rotated about their axis and thus as they<br>
engage the bottom surface of the piston actuating member, they continue rolling,<br>
eliminating radial thrust.<br>
For improved efficieency of the power unit, the cylinder modules are<br>
rotationally restrained within their bores. Furthermore, sealing rings are provided<br>
on the pistons and still preferably, rider rings are provided on the actuating member<br>
slidable within the cylinder module.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment, there is provided a multiple power unit<br>
wherein the opening within the housing comprises a plurality of bores arranged in<br>
two or more parallel planes; each bore extending along a radial axis from said<br>
opening.<br>
Alternatively, two or more housings are coaxially stacked on top of one<br>
another in parallel planes, whereby rotary motion is transferred between nodular<br>
rotors of neighboring housings.<br>
Where the rotary power unit comprises more man two planes of cylinders,<br>
men it is desired that the centers of bores in one plane are angularly offset with<br>
respect to centers of bores in a neighboring plane by α°, wherein a is derived out of<br>
the formula:<br>
α°=(360/N)/p<br>
wherein:<br>
α is measured in degrees<br>
N is the number of cylinders in each plane; and<br>
P is the number of planes.<br>
When the bores are angularly offset, as above, then continuous, sequential<br>
pumping or compressing effect is obtained.<br><br>
In accordance with a different arrangement, one or more planes of a multi-<br>
stage rotary power unit are dedicated to establishing a pump or compressor, and<br>
one or more other planes are dedicated to establish a radial engine. However, there<br>
may also be provided an arrangement wherein some of the bores comprise one or<br>
more inlet valves and one or more outlet valves, and remaining bores are fitted with<br>
a fuel supply nozzle, ignition and ignition timing arrangements, and gas exchange<br>
passages, whereby a combined radial engine and a pump or compressor is<br>
established.<br>
An important character of the power unit in accordance with the present<br>
invention is that the nodular rotor is adapted for both clockwise and counter-<br>
clockwise rotation and no particular adapting procedure is required. Accordingly, at<br>
any stage the nodular rotor may be reversed in direction or rotation.<br>
In accordance with some preferred configurations, the curvature ratio<br>
between the diameter of the opening in the housing and a theoretical spherical<br>
diameter of the convex or the concave surface is in the order of about 1:1 to about<br>
1:4. Still preferably the piston has a diameter to stroke ratio being greater than or<br>
equal to about 5:1 and where the nodular rotor is rotated at about 300 RPM, or less.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRA WINGS<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Attention is first directed to Fig. 1 of the drawings in which the power unit<br>
generally designated 20 is illustrated. In the present example, power unit 20 is a<br>
compressor or pump. However, as will become apparent hereinafter, it may be<br>
easily converted into an engine or, in accordance with an embodiment of the<br>
invention may be a hybrid engine and pump/compressor.<br>
Power unit 20 has a generally cylundrical housing 22 formed with a central,<br>
circular opening 24 and a plurality of bores 28, radially extending between;<br>
opening 24 to an external surface 30 of the housing 22, the bores penetrating into<br>
the circular opening 24.<br>
In the present example, housing 20 is formed with eight bores. However, a<br>
different number of bores may be elected as well. Preferably, the number of bores is<br>
art even number.<br>
Extending into opening 24 there is a shaft 36 associated with a planetary<br>
speed reducing gear train generally designated 3.8 and consisting of a sun gear 40<br>
fixed to shaft 36, three planet gears 42 rotatably supported to wall 46 of opening 24<br><br>
by means of shafts 48. Ring gear 50 constitutes an integral portion of a nodular<br>
rotor generally designated 52.<br>
The artisan will appreciate that whilst in the present embodiment the planet<br>
gears are rotatably supported to the housing, there may be a different embodiment<br>
in which the planet gears are rotatably fixed to the gearing of the nodular rotor 52<br>
and the ring gear is fixed to the housing.<br>
Nodular rotor 52 is a heptahedron shaped member coaxially mounted within<br>
opening 24 and comprising seven nodes 58. Each node 58 rotatably supports a<br>
roller 60 adapted for rotating within the opening 24 about a circular path generated<br>
by a bounding circle of the bores 28. The arrangement is such that when a roller 60<br>
is radially aligned with a longitudinal axis of a respective bore (bore 28a in Fig. 1)<br>
it penetrates to a maximum into that, specific bore, entailing maximum<br>
displacement of the associated piston as will become apparent hereinafter. On the<br>
other hand, when the roller 60 is not in the vicinity of a bore (see bore 28e in Fig. 1)<br>
then the piston is in its lowermost, non- displaced position, as will be explained<br>
hereinafter.<br>
Each of the bores 28 accommodates a cylinder module generally<br>
designated 70 which in the present example is a pump/compressor module.<br>
With further reference being made also to Figs. 2A and 2B, the cylinder<br>
module 70 comprises a piston 72 slidably received within a cylinder sleeve<br>
insert 74 with suitable sealing rings 76 provided on the piston, as known per se.<br>
However, it should be noted mat by other embodiments, cylinder sleeves are<br>
omitted.<br>
A piston actuating member 78 is rigidly fixed or integrally formed with<br>
piston 72 and comprises a bottom surface 80, adapted for engagement with the<br>
ncdes of the nodular rotor, as will hereinafter be explained. In order to provide<br>
smooth operation and to retain the piston and piston actuator aligned within the<br>
bore 28, the piston actuator 78 is fitted with rider rings 84. By a different<br>
embodiment (not illustrated) the linear distance between the piston and the<br>
associated piston actuating member may be altered for controlling the clearance of<br><br>
the piston from the piston head. This might be accomplished, for example, by<br>
providing screw-coupling engagements between the two members or by other<br>
means.<br>
In the present example, sealing rings 76 are self-lubricant rings made of<br>
PTFE comprising about 15% graphite, whereby no liquid lubrication is required.<br>
However, other lubrication means are possible too.<br>
Piston module 70 further comprises a coiled spring 86 bearing at one end<br>
thereof against a recessed shoulder 87 integrally formed within the wall of the<br>
piston module and at an opposed end thereof spring 86 bears against the piston<br>
actuator 78, thus biasing the piston and piston actuating member into a BDC<br>
position, i.e. the position in which the piston is radially inwardly biased (see Fig.<br>
2A). The piston module 70 is easily insertable and fixed within a bore of the<br>
housing, with suitable fixing means provided (not shown), for fixingly securing the<br>
module within the housing.<br>
Piston module 70 is Anther fitted with an inlet valve 90 and an outlet<br>
valve 92. Fig. 2A illustrates a pumping stroke and Fig. 2B illustrates a compression<br>
stroke. It is noted that in these figures the bottom surface of the piston actuating<br>
member is convex.<br>
Further attention is now directed to Figs. 1 and 3 for understanding the<br>
sequential operation of a power unit in accordance with the present invention. In<br>
Fig. 1, the piston module seen in bore 28a is in a top dead center (TDC) whilst the<br>
piston module in bore 28e is in the bottom dead center (BDC). Considering that the<br>
nodular rotor 52 is now rotating in a clockwise direction represented by arrow 90,<br>
thus the pistons received within bores 28b, 28c and 28d are in consecutive inlet<br>
displacements, i.e. towards their BDC position. However the piston modules<br>
received within bores 28f, 28g and 28h are represented in consecutive<br>
displacements towards their top dead center, i.e. an outlet stroke.<br>
In Fig. 3 the nodular rotor 52 is illustrated after rotating by 22.5°, wherein<br>
the piton module within bore 28a is now in its bottom dead center position whereas<br>
the piston module in bore 28e is in its top dead center. The piston modules received<br><br>
within bores 28b - 28d are now illustrated in displacement towards a top dead<br>
center whereas piston modules received within bores 28f - 28h are in displacement<br>
towards bottom dead center.<br>
The arrangement in the present embodiment is such that the centers of bores<br>
are offset from other by 45° whereas the seven nodes are spaced from one another<br>
by about 51.4°. However, by changing the number of bores and the number of<br>
nodes, performances of the power unit are changed.<br>
In the embodiments shown in the preceding figures, the piston actuator<br>
members 78 are illustrated with essentially flat bottom surfaces 80. However, it will<br>
be appreciated that these surfaces may also be concave or convex (as illustrated in<br>
Figs. 2) or may have a complex surface shape comprising a combination of flat and<br>
arcuate segments. In this way, it is possible to displace the piston towards the BDC<br>
at one speed pattern and towards the TDC in another speed pattern, and to extend<br>
or shorten the dwell time, depending on viscosity of a fluid being pumped or<br>
compressed, as may be the case.<br>
It will also be appreciated that while the piston modules described in the<br>
figures refer only to pumping/compressing modules, the power unit may also<br>
constitute an engine. For mis purpose the piston modules are fitted with a fuel<br>
supply system, fuel ignition and timing means, gas exchange valves, etc., as known<br>
in the art.<br>
If desired, a hybrid engine and pump/compressor may be engineered,<br>
wherein one housing accommodates several engine piston modules and several<br>
pump/compressor piston modules. However, owing to the simplicity of the device<br>
according to the invention, and to the extreme modularity, each of the piston<br>
modules may be replaced at any time to either a pumping piston module, a<br>
compression piston module or an engine piston module. In this manner, any<br>
combination of piston modules is acceptable and if required, some piston modules<br>
may also be eliminated altogether.<br>
In accordance with modifications of the invention, the speed reducing<br>
planetary train may be an independent unit not associated within the housing. In<br><br>
this way the weight of the unit is reduced. Other speed reducing arrangements are<br>
also possible, as known.<br>
An important feature of the power unit in accordance with the present<br>
invention is the radial thrust reducing arrangement which in the embodiment of<br>
Figs. 1 and 3 was obtained by rollers 60. Further attention is now directed to Fig. 4<br>
of the drawings, illustrating a different embodiment. In accordance with this<br>
embodiment, the power unit generally designated 100 comprises an internally<br>
geared ring 102 secured within a suitable recess 104 in housing 106 and the nodular<br>
rotor, generally designated 108 comprises a plurality of cylindrical rollers 110<br>
axially and rotatably supported between two plates 112 and 114. Each roller 110 is<br>
formed with a geared portion 116 which is either integral with or fixedly attached<br>
thereto.<br>
In the assembled position, which may be configured out of the upper<br>
segment in Fig. 5, geared portions 116 of rollers 110 are engaged within the geared<br>
ring 102.<br>
A speed reducing planetary gear train 120 is fitted into the housing and<br>
comprises a sun gear 122, three planetary gears 124, a gear ring 126, a top support<br>
plate 128 formed with apertures 129 and a bottom plate 130 fitted with axles 132<br>
for mounting thereon the planetary gears 124.<br>
A shaft 134 extends through the bottom plate 130 and engages with the sun<br>
gear 122. Shaft 134 is supported by a bearing 136.<br>
Housing 106 is formed with a plurality of bores 140 each fitted with a<br>
cylinder module generally designated 142 which, as explained hereinabove, may<br>
either be a pumping/compressing module.<br>
In the assembled position, rotary motion is imparted via shaft 134 and speed<br>
is reduced by the speed reducing assembly 120. Top plate 128 is coupled with<br>
bottom plate 114 of the nodular rotor 108 by means of pins (not seen) extending<br>
into holes 129 of plate 128.<br><br>
Rotation of plate 114 entails also rotation of plate 112 and also rotation of<br>
rollers 110. However, the engagement of rollers 110 within gearing 102 generates<br>
rotary motion of the rollers 110 also about their supporting axis.<br>
This arrangement ensures that as the rollers engage with the bottom surface<br>
of the piston actuating member, radial thrust forces are eliminated or essentially<br>
reduced as well as friction forces.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 5 of the drawings there is illustrated a double-stacked<br>
power unit in accordance with the present invention comprising two housings 150<br>
and 152 coaxially mounted on top one another. Each, of the housings 150 and 152 is.<br>
principally similar to the embodiment shown in the exploded view of Fig. 4.<br>
However, it will be appreciated that housing 150 is devoid of speed reducing<br>
assembly 120. Pins (not seen) projecting from the plate 114 of the top housing 150<br>
project into plate 112 of housing 152 whereby rotary motion is transferred between<br>
the associated housings.<br>
In this embodiment, the shaft 134 seen in Fig. 4 may be eliminated wherein<br>
one housing, for example housing 152, may be designed as an engine whereas<br>
housing 150 may be designed as a pump/compressor, the entire power unit being<br>
self contained, with rotary displacement between housings beine transferred by the<br>
nodular rotor assemblies.<br>
Fig. 6 is a schematic top view of the embodiment seen in Fig. 5, wherein it<br>
is shown that the angular set-off between pistons 154 of housing 150 and<br>
pistons 156 of housing 152 is calculated by the formula<br>
αo =(360/N)/p<br>
wherein:<br>
α is measured in degrees;<br>
N is the number of cylinders in each plane; and<br>
P is the number of planes!<br>
In the present example, N = 8 and P = 2 and the angle α is thus = to 22.5°.<br><br><br>
In the embodiment of Fig. 7 there is illustrated a triple-stacked power unit<br>
comprising three housings 160, 162 and 164, each fitted with a plurality of piston<br>
modules 166, 168 and 170, respectively.<br>
The arrangement in this embodiment is essentially similar to the<br>
embodiment of Fig. 5 as far as transferring rotational motion and with respect to the<br>
offset of the centers of the pistons in the three layers.<br>
This arrangement is suitable in particular, but not limited thereto, to<br>
pumping/compressing power units wherein successive displacement of the pistons<br>
is obtained, ensuring smooth operation and continuous compression or suction<br>
force. Alternatively, the housings may be arranged so as to operate in tandem.<br>
Fig. 8 illustrates the radial offset position of the centers of the piston<br>
modules which based on the formula referred to in connection with Fig. 6, yields a<br>
different angle α = 15°.<br>
In the embodiment of Fig. 7, each of the housings may accommodate<br>
different piston modules. By one example, the stacked power unit may be designed<br>
so that one housing is an engine, a second housing is a compressor and a third<br>
housing is a pump. However, a variety of other combinations are also possible.<br>
Having provided the above description, some further clarifications and<br>
highlighting are to be added. For example, it is pointed out that the nodular rotor in<br>
accordance with any of the above embodiments is rotational in both directions<br>
without having to perform any changes in the assembly prior to changing direction<br>
of rotation. Obviously, this is an advantage also as far as flexibility in connecting<br>
the pump/compressor to an output of an engine.<br>
Furthermore, as noted, no particular lubricating means are provided apart<br>
from the use of PTFE piston rings for friction reducing. This fact in itself, avails<br>
the pump/compressor for use in particular, but not restricted thereto, with different<br>
gasses, e.g. oxygen for medical supply, different gasses for scuba diving, and gasses<br>
for industrial processes. Typically, in such instances, the compressed gasses are<br>
required at high degrees of purification. It will, however, be noted that a variety of<br><br>
other lubricating composites may be used as well as other lubricating means, such<br>
as liquid oil lubrication, as known in the art.<br>
While in the embodiments described hereinabove, a planetary speed<br>
reducing gear was integrally provided within the power unit, it is to be understood<br>
that such a speed reducing mechanism may be eliminated or may be incorporated as<br>
an independent assembly linked between the power unit and an engine providing<br>
rotary motion. It will also be appreciated that such speed reducing means may be of<br>
any particular design and are not necessarily restricted to planetary gears although,<br>
it will be understood that planetary speed reducing gears have the significant<br>
advantage of being compact and thus suitable for incorporation within the housing<br>
of the power unit of the present invention.<br>
As already mentioned above, the cylinder modules are entirely modular and<br>
interchangeable. This is considered as a significant advantage providing flexibility<br>
wherein a single plane power unit may be designed with some cylinder modules<br>
adapted to perform pumping or compressing and other cylinder modules adapted to<br>
generate rotary motion, whereby the power unit is self contained.<br>
It is also appreciated mat the pump/compressor in accordance with the<br>
present invention is suitable for simultaneously pumping or compressing different<br>
media wherein some of the cylinder modules may be used to pump or compress a<br>
first type of fluid and other piston modules may serve for pumping or compressing<br>
another media of fluid. Such fluids may be either liquids or gasses, as the artisan<br>
will no doubt realize.<br>
As illustrated and described above, the power units may be designed for<br>
stacking on top of one another with integral means provided for transferring rotary<br>
motion between levels of the power units. This again, is an advantage as far as<br>
modularity is concerned, wherein each plane may be designed to perform a<br>
different type of work, i.e., pumping, compressing or generate work (serve as an<br>
engine). Alternatively, it is appreciated that rather than stacking several housings on<br>
top of one another, there may be a single housing provided with several planes of<br>
bores, each plane serving as a different functional unit.<br><br>
It is further appreciated that failing of one or more cylinder modules or<br>
removal of a cylinder module does not influence the functional operation of the<br>
remaining cylinder modules, each one of which being independently operable.<br>
It is further desired to emphasize that the structure of the power unit in<br>
accordance with any of the above described embodiments is designed to have a<br>
rotational speed of approximately 300 RPM. This is considered as a great<br>
advantage over prior art power units which typically operate at a significantly<br>
higher rotational speed in order to deliver the same work, thus significantly<br>
improving the overall efficiency of the power unit.<br>
By utilizing an extreme ratio piston diameter to stroke, typically in the order<br>
of greater than about 5:1, the power unit in accordance with the present invention<br>
achieves reducing of linear speed of the piston within the cylinder. This is a<br>
significant advantage resulting in reduction of friction, ring wear, cylinder wall<br>
wear, less heat generation and reduced load on the drive train, as well as a quieter<br>
operation.<br>
These improved qualities permit the usage of such materials which<br>
otherwise could not be used in such power units. Such materials are, for example,<br>
composite plastics, light metals, etc. The advantage of using such materials resides<br>
in reducing fractional losses between piston rings and cylinder walls and the<br>
elimination of the stick/slip phenomena, which is inherent in metal contact<br>
surfaces. This arrangement also allows the short stroke compressor to operate<br>
without liquid lubrication (oil-free) and thus significantly reducing the overall size<br>
and weight of the unit.<br>
Whilst some preferred embodiments have been shown and described in the<br>
specification, it will be understood by an artisan that it is not intended thereby to<br>
delimit the disclosure of the invention, but rather it is intended to cover all<br>
modifications and arrangements falling within the scope and the spirit of the<br>
present invention as defined in the appended claims, mutatis mutandis.<br><br>

In accordance with the present invention there is provided a rotary power<br>

consequently reduces maintenance requirements of the components. The power<br>
unit provides improved overall efficiency and uses an essentially short stroke<br>
versus a large diameter piston with low revolutionary speed on the one hand and,<br>
on the other hand, an essentially low linear speed of the pistons with respect to the<br>
cylinder wall.<br>
The bottom surface of the piston actuators may be either flat, concave or<br>
convex, or may be of a complex shape comprising a combination of flat and arcuate<br><br>
segments. This arrangement is suitable for defining the up-stroke and down-stroke<br>
(these terms denote compression/suction displacement of the pistons in case of a<br>
pump or compressor or, discharge/intake displacement of the piston in case of an<br>
engine). This also permits control of the dwell time at the TDC of the piston which<br>
is an important parameter. In accordance with the present invention, within a single<br>
power unit, different piston actuators may be used wherein their bottom surfaces<br>
are either flat, concave, convex or a complex shape as above.</td>
