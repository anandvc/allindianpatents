The present invention is to be assigned to the field of. counter technology.  It relates to a unidirectional counter which, with a potentially bidirectional rotational direction drive, has a display having a unidirectional rotational direction.<br>
Background Information<br>
Unidirectional counters are implemented in such a way that they add up and display the amount and/or consumption of water, gas, or electrical energy, for example. The use of unidirectional counters is particularly advantageous in electricity meters, especially in Ferraris meters in this field.  In the following, the present invention focuses on the use of unidirectional counters in Ferraris meters, without excluding the application of these counters in other fields, such as the gas economy or the water economy, for example.<br>
In Ferraris meters which are known per se, a rotor disk arrangement is driven, due to an electrical network voltage and an electrical consumer current, which then drives a counter.   Meters of this type may include known numbered rollers or numbered disks or have pointers which rotate in front of fixed numbered dials.  If the rotor disk arrangement and therefore also the drive of the counter incorrectly rotates opposite to the proper rotational<br>
direction, this incorrect rotational direction is transformed between the rotor<br>
disk arrangement and the display by conventional unidirectional meters into<br>
]<br>
the correct rotational direction for the continuous summation for this display.<br>
Pawl systems are used in a known way, as is shown in US 4,352,979, for example, for a transformation of this type of a bidirectional rotational direction of a rotor disk arrangement into a unidirectional rotational direction for a numbered roller arrangement, for example.   In this publication, a<br><br>
2<br>
unidirectional counter is described in which a pawl arrangement is rotated via a gearwheel drive.   Depending on the rotational direction of the pawl arrangement, either a first or a second intermediate gearwheel, having ratchet teeth, is driven, this first or second intermediate gearwheel then providing the correct, summing rotational direction drive of the display via further gearwheels.<br>
The number of different components for the counter may be considered<br>
disadvantageous in an arrangement of this type from the related art.  In<br>
addition, this counter requires a two-sided mounting between a front wall<br>
and a rear wall, positioned parallel thereto, of a housing arrangement, since<br>
on one single rotating axle, four components which rotate in the same or<br>
opposite directions are positioned next to one another, namely the drive<br>
gearwheel, the pawi arrangement, and the first and second intermediate<br>
gearwheels, which have ratchet teeth.  Mounting the axle on one side is not<br>
conceivable due to a correspondingly large static torque influence on this<br>
axle.<br>
In addition, a static torque acts on the counter itself, without an external drive, even if the pawl arrangement is rotated out of its labile or stable equilibrium.   Described in positions of a clock hand, this means that a static torque arises even without an external drive as soon as the pawl arrangement leaves the 12 o'clock and/or 6 o'clock position. This unbalanced pawl arrangement, in the event of a - definitely unacceptable - periodically alternating rotational direction reversal, may therefore have a certain influence on the changeover speed, so that a detectably incorrect display of the consumption would be possible.<br>
Furthermore, with identical drive power on a rotor disk arrangement of a Ferraris meter, i.e., with identical instantaneous consumption of the consumed medium to be detected, the speed of the correct forward running and the manipulated backward running are known to deviate detectably from<br><br>
3<br>
one another.  This is because rotor disk arrangements of this type are designed and optimized for the correct forward running.  Therefore, at identical drive power, a lower speed may typically be detected on a rotor disk arrangement for the manipulated backward running than for the correct forward running.<br>
Description of the Invention<br>
It is therefore the object of the present invention to refine a unidirectional counter of the above-mentioned type which, in comparison to the related art<br>
described, ensures precise detection and correct adding up of consumed<br>
products not only for correct forward running, but also for manipulated<br>
backward running.   It is also of great significance in this case that quasi-immediate detection of a fraudulently manipulated rotational direction reversal is made possible.<br>
In addition, it is the object of the present invention to provide a counterbalanced counter, which is free of static torques and is therefore more precise, with a comparatively low number of different components and with a lower mounting cost.   In addition to the known two-sided mounting between a front wall and a rear wall, positioned parallel to this front wall, of a housing arrangement, this counter is preferably also to be mountable on only one side, i.e., it is to be mountable either on the front wall or on the rear wall.   Furthermore, the counter according to the present invention is to be comparatively more compact and is to be able to compensate for electromagnetic speed deviations of a driven rotor disk arrangement when the rotational direction is reversed.<br>
The object of the present invention is achieved by the features<br>
described herein after along with further advantageous embodiments<br><br>
of the present invention.<br><br>
4<br>
The core of the present invention is that in a unidirectional counter, two<br>
ratchet-pawl systems, which are connected to one another via a worm wheel<br>
and a numbered display and/or an intermediate wheel are positioned next<br>
one another in a counter, the two ratchet-pawl systems differing in that,<br>
considered per se, they are quasi-spontaneously engaged in only one<br>
rotational direction - i.e., either right running or left running and/or forward<br>
running or backward running.  It is essential in this case that the gear ratio<br>
between the ratchet-pawl systems and the numbered display and/or the<br>
intermediate wheel differ for forward running and backward running.<br>
Therefore, a speed error in the event of manipulated backward running,<br>
which originally arises from a rotor disk arrangement designed and optimized<br>
for forward running, is compensated for in the unidirectional counter.   For<br>
identical consumption to be detected, in this way the unidirectional counter<br>
displays a nearly identical number of units consumed per time unit both for<br>
forward running and for backward running, so that the consumption display<br>
sums up and shows precisely in the same way, completely independently of<br>
the rotational direction of a rotor disk arrangement which is designed and<br>
optimized per se for forward running.  In short, the unidirectional counter<br>
according to the present invention compensates for the speed errors of the<br>
rotor disk arrangement, which are based in its electromagnetically optimized<br>
design, in the event of a manipulated rotational direction change of the rotor<br>
disk arrangement.<br>
It is especially advantageous that this speed compensation according to the present invention may be implemented through simple embodiment of tooth count ratios in the unidirectional counter. Since both ratchet-pawl systems are directly operatively connected to one another between a worm wheel and an inversion wheel, suitable compensation may be set easily here through the selection of an appropriate tooth count ratio which is larger or smaller than 1.  In addition, the ratchet-pawl systems are operatively connected to one another via a first and a second system wheel, so that in this case as well, simple adaptation of the gear ratios is provided using selection of a<br><br>
5<br>
suitable tooth count ratio larger or smaller than 1.   Furthermore, adaptation using a combination of both setting possibilities between the worm wheel and inversion wheel and/or the two system wheels is conceivable according to the present invention for suitable multiplication. This combined adaptation variation is especially advantageous due to the possibility of setting the gear ratios finely.<br>
In addition, in the interplay between a pawl pair and the associated ratchet teeth of a ratchet-pawl system, the counter according to the present invention allows comparatively more rapid changeover than the related art if a drive unit, such as a rotor disk arrangement of a Ferraris meter, has its rotational direction changed incorrectly.  Even unpermitted manipulated, periodic rotational direction changeovers thus lead to quasi-direct changeover from the ratchet-pawl system which is engaged to the further ratchet-pawl system, so that the counter display is further driven to add up unidirectionally nearly without interruption.<br>
In this case, the expression "ratchet-pawl system" is to be understood as an arrangement in which the pawls on a component rotating in one direction either engage on ratchet teeth of a further rotating component or, due to the opposite rotational direction, do not engage and therefore idle.<br>
As described above, a worm wheel is a link of the counter to a drive worm, as is sufficiently known in connection with a rotor disk arrangement in a Ferraris meter, for example. The direct drive of the numbered rollers is thus caused by the intermediate wheel referred to in this way.   It is to be noted in this case that this intermediate wheel does not have any character which is essential to the present invention.  One skilled in the art in the field of counter technology is also obviously capable of eliminating this intermediate wheel without an inventive step.<br><br>
6<br>
It is essential according to the present invention that in both ratchet-pawl systems, at least one pawl at a time is in an engagement position in the direction toward a ratchet tooth or is in direct engagement with a ratchet tooth. The decisive advantage which comes to bear in this case is in the quasi-spontaneous engagement ability of the ratchet-pawl system which is not engaged at this instant, if the rotational direction of the driving worm  changes.  For those ratchet-pawl systems which are not engaged in a period of time, but rather are idling, the pawls act, in relation to one another in connection with the diametrically opposite ratchet teeth, like rockers, which mutually push one another into the engagement position with these ratchet<br>
teeth, so that at least one of these two pawls is always in this engagement<br><br>
position.<br>
It is especially advantageous if the two pawl pairs on the two system wheels<br>
are positioned in phase opposition to one another and therefore rotate in<br>
counter phase. This means that the first pawl pair of the first system wheel<br>
is in the 12 o'clock position when the second pawl pair of the second system<br>
wheel is in the 6 o'clock position.  When both system wheels - which are<br>
coupled to one another via the intermediate wheel - rotate, the torques of<br>
the two system wheels, having the pawls, acting on this intermediate wheel<br>
completely compensate for one another. This counterbalanced arrangement<br>
is thus free in any position of those torques which may be exclusively<br>
attributed to the arrangement per se and therefore act when the counter is<br>
at a standstill, i.e., even statically.<br>
The counter according to the present invention has the further advantage of a very compact arrangement, since the worm wheel and the first system wheel and/or the inversion wheel and the second system wheel are each mounted coaxially to one another on an axle.  In this way, even if the axles are mounted on only one side, slight bending moments between these axles disappear.   Mounting of this type may also be performed simply and cost-effectively.<br><br>
7<br>
Furthermore, in comparison to the related art described, fewer different components are used for the counter, which also has a favorable effect on<br>
the cost.<br>

present invention having a numbered roller as a display and a driving worm;<br>

Detailed Descriptions of the Embodiments<br>
Figure 1 shows a unidirectional counter in a cutaway, uncoiled illustration. An uncoiled illustration is to be understood to mean that all counter axles are shown in one plane, although they are not actually arranged in one such plane.  In order to nonetheless make it clear which gearwheels of the counter mesh directly with one another, i.e., drive one another, two operative<br>
connection arrows 22 and 23 are shown.<br><br>
The counter shown in Figure 1 is a roller counter, for the sake of simplicity, only one single numbered roller 3 being symbolically shown as a display for<br><br>
8<br>
multiple numbered rollers positioned coaxially next to one another.  In principle, the counter is suitable for adding up and displaying when buying or delivering energy units in the electricity economy, the gas economy, or the water economy.  In the following, however, the focus is placed on adding up and displaying electrical energy, and the purchase of energy units of this type is especially elucidated in this case.  In no case is the present invention to be reduced to the embodiments shown and described, since any other use of the counter is conceivable without leaving the core upon which the present invention is based. This premise also includes representation using numbered rollers; without leaving the idea of the present invention, numbered disks or pointers in front of a numbered dial are also conceivable<br>
as displays instead of numbered rollers.<br><br>
The counter according to the present invention is driven via a drive worm 20, which is coaxially connected to a known rotor disk arrangement(not shown here).  In connection with Figure 1, Figure 2 clarifies the arrangement of the drive worm 20 with the counter.   For this purpose, a sectional illustration along the section line B-B' in Figure 1 is shown in Figure 2. The drive worm 20 drives a worm wheel 1 counterclockwise on first spur teeth 2.  Coaxially to first spur teeth 2, this worm wheel 1 has a cylinder projection 5. The inside of the cylinder projection 5 is provided with a number of ratchet teeth 6, while the outside of the cylinder projection 5 supports further, second spur teeth 9 of the worm wheel 1.<br>
An inversion wheel 10 is rotated clockwise via these second spur-teeth 9, the drive occurring via spur teeth 18 of the inversion wheel 10.  These spur teeth 18 are positioned on the outside of a cylinder projection 11 of the inversion wheel 10, ratchet teeth 12 being located on the inside of this cylinder projection 11.  One of these ratchet teeth 12 is engaged with a pawl 13b, which is pivotably mounted on a system wheel 14.  A further pawl 13a is also pivotably attached to the system wheel 14, both pawls 13a and 13b being positioned in an operative connection to one another.<br><br>
9<br>
In this way, because the one pawl 13b is engaged with a ratchet tooth 12, the system wheel 14 also rotates clockwise.  An intermediate wheel 4, which in turn directly drives a numbered roller 3, is connected via spur teeth 16 to system wheel 14.  The intermediate wheel 4 is driven counterclockwise and the numbered roller 3 is driven clockwise in this case.<br>
As long as the worm wheel 1 rotates counterclockwise, the ratchet teeth 6 on<br>
the inside of the cylinder projection 5 brush past a pawl pair 7a, 7b of a<br>
further system wheel 8, in such a way that these pawls 7a, 7b, which are<br>
positioned in mutual operative connection to one another, are each, in<br>
connection with the ratchet teeth 6 of the worm wheel 1, alternately pivoted<br>
into the engagement position to one of these ratchet teeth 6.  The further<br>
system wheel 8 is connected via spur teeth 15 positioned thereon to the<br>
intermediate wheel 4, which is rotating counterclockwise, and therefore<br>
rotates clockwise.<br>
The ratchet-pawl system 6, 7a, 7b between the worm wheel 1 and the system wheel 8 is in a potential engagement position when the worm wheel 1 rotates counterclockwise, so that if the rotational direction of the worm wheel 1 reverses to the clockwise direction (not shown), at least one pawl 7a, 7b may immediately engage with a ratchet tooth 6.  In this case, worm wheel 1 and system wheel 8 would rotate clockwise. Therefore, intermediate wheel 4 would in turn rotate counterclockwise and the numbered roller 3 would rotate clockwise. At this time, the inversion wheel 10 then rotates counterclockwise, so that the pawls 13a, 13b of the system wheel 8 are merely brushed by the ratchet teeth 12 and alternately "pivoted into the engagement position.<br>
It is essential according to the present invention that only one of the two<br>
ratchet-pawl systems 6, 7a, 7b, 12, 13a, 13b is engaged, while the other is<br>
permanently located in a potential engagement position. This arrangement<br><br>
10<br>
of two ratchet-pawl systems 6, 7a, 7b, 12, 13a, 13b in a counter allows quasi-spontaneous changeover in a simple way upon any rotational direction change of the worm wheel 1, so that high-precision summation and display of energy consumption is provided.<br>
The present invention is distinguished in that in the simplest way, in the event of rotational direction reversal and consumption absolute value which remains constant, the speed of the counter is different upon a change from<br>
forward operation to backward operation. The present invention specifically<br>
i<br>
teaches that rotor disk arrangements have a set, calibrated speed in a<br>
rotational direction for correct operation, and in contrast, they may have a<br>
speed deviating from the correct operating case in the event of manipulated<br>
rotational direction change and consumption absolute value which remains<br>
constant.  The speed of the rotor disk arrangement is typically slower for<br>
backward operation than for forward operation. The present invention<br>
provides compensating for these "speed errors" using simple adaptations of<br>
tooth number ratios in the unidirectional counter.<br>
According to the present invention, this problem may be counteracted very simply, in that the tooth count ratio of forward to backward gearwheels is appropriately adaptable, which is, however, not explicitly shown in the figures for the sake of simplicity.   For this purpose, adjusting the tooth count ratio between the spur teeth 9 of the gearwheel 1 and the spur teeth 18 of the inversion wheel 10, which the gearwheel may drive, from the ratio one to the ratio not equal to one, and/or adjusting the tooth count ratio between the spur teeth 15 of the first system wheel 8 and spur teeth 16 of the second system wheel 14 from the ratio one to the ratio not equal to one are suitable.<br>
If, for example, a tooth count of 41 on the gearwheel 1 and 40 on the<br><br>
inversion wheel 10 are selected, a multiplication of 1.025:1 results.  This means that in the event of manipulated backward rotation, a counter display which is greater by 2.5% results than in the event of correct forward rotation.  This elevated speed of the counter thus compensates in a simple<br><br>
11<br>
way for the comparatively slower speed of a rotor disk arrangement in the backward direction.   Using this adaptation of the tooth count ratios, which is essential according to the present invention, between the gearwheel 1 and the inversion wheel 10 and/or between the first and second system wheels 8, 14, any speed adaptation is settable, the tooth count ratios merely requiring a skilled embodiment.<br>
If, for example, a rotor disk arrangement should rotate faster in the incorrect rotational direction than in the correct rotational direction, a corresponding adaptation of the tooth count ratios according to the present invention is also conceivable, since one of the tooth count ratios described above may also be set to a ratio smaller than one in a simple way. Of course, elevating the number of pawls for a ratchet-pawl system which are operatively connected to one another to three or more pawls is also conceivable, the number of engagement possibilities to the ratchet teeth thus being elevated.  Refining of the engagement possibilities in the event of an incorrect rotational<br>
direction change consequently results from this according to the present<br>
invention.<br>
In addition, the counter is constructed from a smaller number of different components than in the related art, which allows cost-effective manufacturing and mounting.  In addition, it is also a simplification that the entire counter is installed on only one single side of a housing wall for this counter, which makes the mounting easier and rapid to perform.<br>
A complete rotation of the worm wheel 1 in the correct rotational direction counterclockwise is shown by Figure 2 and Figure 3 together.  Starting with<br>
i!<br>
Figure 2, the first ratchet-pawl system 6, 7a, 7b is located between the worm wheel l and the first system wheel 8 in the 6 o'clock position and the second ratchet-pawl system 12, 13a, 13b is located between the inversion wheel 10 and the second system wheel 14 in the 12 o'clock position.  If the worm wheel is now rotated counterclockwise in the correct rotational direction, the<br><br>
12<br>
first ratchet-pawl system 6, 7a, 7b is displaced into the 9 o'clock position, while the second ratchet-pawl system 12, 13a, 13b goes into the 3 o'clock position, as shown in Figure 3a.  It is clear in this case that a leading pawl 7a is pivoted into the engagement position by the neighboring, lagging pawl 7b as a result of the brushing of a ratchet tooth 6 and immediately thereafter, the leading pawl 7a would pivot the lagging pawl 7b into the engagement position as a result of brushing another ratchet tooth 6, which is not shown here, however, for reasons of simplicity.<br>
Figure 3b and Figure 3c show, in a quasi-self-explanatory way, how the first ratchet-pawl system 6, 7a, 7b is rotated via the 12 o'clock position into the 3 o'clock position, and/or how the second ratchet-pawl system 12, 13a, 13b is rotated via the 6 o'clock position into the 9 o'clock position.  It is especially to be noted when observing the sequence of the illustrations in Figure 2 and Figure 3 that the first ratchet-pawl system 6, 7a, 7b is positioned in counter phase to the second ratchet-pawl system 12, 13a, 13b.  This means that the two ratchet-pawl systems 6, 7a, 7b,, 12, 13a, 13b pass through all positions of a rotation in phase opposition to one another. The decisive advantage in this case is that no static torque, i.e., a torque based solely on the geometric arrangement, acts on the intermediate wheel which connects the two ratchet-pawl systems 6, 7a, 7b, 12, 13a, 13b.<br><br>

as a function of the rotational direction of the worm wheel (1), either the first ratchet-pawl system (6,7a, b) or the second ratchet-pawl system (12, 13a, b) is engaged,<br>
using spur teeth (9,18), the worm wheel (1) and the inversion wheel (10) engage in one another at a multiplication ratio of these spur teeth (9,18) not equal to 1, and/or<br>
 a tooth count ratio between spur teeth (15) of the first system wheel (8) and spur teeth (16) of the second system wheel (14) is not equal to 1.<br>
2.	The unidirectional counter according to claim 1, wherein the first ratchet-pawl system<br>
(6, 7a, b) includes at least one first pawl pair (7a, b) having two identically acting pawls (7a,<br>
b), which are operatively connected to one another.<br>
i<br>
3.	The unidirectional counter according to claim 2, wherein the second ratchet-pawl<br>
system (12,13a,b) includes at least one second pawl pair (13a, b), having two identically<br>
i acting pawls (13a, b), which are operatively connected to one another, and at least one pawl<br>
(7a, b, 13a, b) at a time of the first and second ratchet-pawl systems (6,7a, b; 12,13a, b) is<br>
located in the engagement position in the direction toward a ratchet tooth (6,12) and/or is<br>
i<br>
directly engaged with a ratchet tooth (6,12).<br>
4.	The unidirectional counter according to one of preceding claims 1 to 3, wherein a<br>
number of ratchet teeth (6) are positioned on a first cylinder projection (5) of the worm wheel<br>
(1), and at least one first pawl pair (7a, b) is positioned on the first system wheel (8).<br>
14<br><br>
5.	The unidirectional counter according to one of preceding claims 1 to 4, wherein a number of ratchet teeth (12) are positioned on a second cylinder projection (11) of the inversion wheel (10), and at least the one second pawl pair (13a, b) is positioned on the second system wheel (14).<br>
6.	The unidirectional counter according to one of preceding claims 1 to 5, wherein the first system wheel (8) and the second system wheel (14) are connected via an intermediate wheel (4), the first pawl pair (7a, b) being positioned in phase opposition to the second pawl pair (13a, b).<br>
7.	The unidirectional counter according to one of preceding claims 4 to 6, wherein on the worm wheel (1), the number of ratchet teeth (6) is positioned on the inside (17) of the first cylinder projection (5).<br>
8.	The unidirectional counter according to one of preceding claims 5 to 7, wherein the number of ratchet teeth (12) of the inversion wheel (10) are positioned on the inside (19) of the second cylinder projection (11).<br>
9.	The unidirectional counter according to one of preceding claims 1 to 8, wherein the worm wheel (1) and the first system wheel (8) are positioned coaxially.<br>
10.	The unidirectional counter according to one of preceding claims 1 to 9, wherein the inversion wheel (10) and the second system wheel (14) are positioned coaxially.<br>
11.	The unidirectional counter according to one of preceding claims 1 to 10, wherein the worm wheel (1) and the inversion wheel (10) are positioned parallel to one another.<br>
In a unidirectional counter having a drivable worm wheel (1) and at least one numbered display (3), which is drivable by the rotation of the worm wheel<br>
(1), the worm wheel (1) is operatively connected via a first ratchet-pawl system (6, 7a, b) to a first system wheel (8).  In this case, this first ratchet-pawl system (6, 7a, b) includes at least one first pawl pair (7a, b) having two identically acting pawls (7a, b), which are operatively connected to one another.  In addition, an inversion wheel (10) is drivable using the worm wheel (1), this inversion wheel (10) being operatively connected via a second ratchet-pawl system (12, 13a, b) to a second system wheel (14). This second ratchet-pawl system (12, 13a, b) includes a second pawl pair (13a, b), also having two identically acting pawls (13a, b) which are operatively connected to one another.   For summing and displaying consumed energy units as exactly as possible - even in the event of a change in rotational direction - it is provided according to the present invention that the multiplication ratio between the worm wheel (1) and the inversion wheel (10) and/or between the first and second system wheels (8, 14) is not equal to 1, a slower backward speed of a rotor disk arrangement in the unidirectional counter, which is inherent to the system, being compensated for.<br></td>
