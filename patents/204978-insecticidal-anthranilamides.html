COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"INSECTICIDAL ANTHRANILAMIDES"<br><br><br>
E.I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware, of 1007 Market Street, Wilmington, Delaware 19898, United States of America,<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
WO 01/70671	PCT7US01/09338<br>
TITLE<br>
INSECTICIDAL ANTHRANILAMIDES BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to certain anthranilamides, their iV-oxides, agriculturally 5     suitable salts and compositions, and methods of their use as arthropodicides in both agronomic and nonagronomic environments.<br>
The control of arthropod pests is extremely important in achieving high crop<br>
efficiency. Arthropod damage to growing and stored agronomic crops can cause significant<br>
reduction in productivity and thereby result in increased costs to the consumer. The control<br>
10     of arthropod pests in forestry, greenhouse crops, ornamentals, nursery crops, stored food and<br>
fiber products, livestock, household, and public and animal health is also important. Many<br>
products are commercially available for these purposes, but the need continues for new<br>
compounds that are more effective, less costly, less toxic, environmentally safer or have<br>
different modes of action.<br>

	DETAILS OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the above recitations, the term "alkyl", used either alone or in compound words such as "alkylthio" or "haloalkyl" includes straight-chain or branched alkyl, such as, methyl, ethyl, K-propyl, z-propyl, or the different butyl, pentyl or hexyl isomers. The term "1-2 5     alkyl" indicates that one or two of the available positions for that substituent may be alkyl. "Alkenyl" includes straight-chain or branched alkenes such as 1-propenyl, 2-propenyl, and the different butenyl, pentenyl and hexenyl isomers. "Alkenyl" also includes polyenes such as 1,2-propadienyl and 2,4-hexadienyl. "Alkynyl" includes straight-chain or branched alkynes such as 1-propynyl, 2-propynyl and the different butynyl, pentynyl and hexynyl<br>
10     isomers. "Alkynyl" can also include moieties comprised of multiple triple bonds such as 2,5-hexadiynyl "Alkoxy" includes, for example, methoxy, ethoxy, rc-propyloxy, isopropyloxy and the different butoxy, pentoxy and hexyloxy isomers. "Alkoxyalkyl" denotes alkoxy substitution on alkyl. Examples of "alkoxyalkyl" include CH3OCH2, CH3OCH2CH2, CH3CH2OCH2, CH3CH2CH2CH2OCH2 and CH3CH2OCH2CH2.<br>
15     "Alkylthio" includes branched or straight-chain alkylthio moieties such as methylthio, ethylthio, and the different propylthio, butyltbio, pentylthio and hexylthio isomers. "Cycloalkyl" includes, for example, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl.<br>
The term^'heterocycHc ring" or heterocyclic ring system" denotes rings or ring systems in which at least one ring atom is not carbon and comprises 1 to 4 heteroatoms<br>
20     independently selected from the group consisting of nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur, provided that each heterocyclic ring contains no more than 4 nitrogens, no more than 2 oxygens and no more than 2 sulfurs. The heterocyclic ring can be attached through any available carbon or nitrogen by replacement of hydrogen on said carbon or nitrogen. The term "aromatic ring system" denotes fully unsaturated carbocycles and heterocycles in which the polycyclic ring<br>
25     system is aromatic (where aromatic indicates that the Hiickel rule is satisfied for the ring system). The term "heteroaromatic ring" denotes fully aromatic rings in which at least one ring atom is not carbon and comprises 1 to 4 heteroatoms independently selected from the group consisting of nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur, provided that each heterocyclic ring contains no more than 4 nitrogens, no more than 2 oxygens and no more than 2 sulfurs<br>
30      (where aromatic indicates that the Htickel rule is satisfied). The heterocyclic ring can be attached through any available carbon or nitrogen by replacement of hydrogen on said carbon or nitrogen. The term "aromatic heterocyclic ring system" includes fully aromatic heterocycles and heterocycles in which at least one ring of a polycyclic ring system is aromatic (where aromatic indicates that the Hiickel rule is satisfied). The term "fused<br>
35     heterobicyclic ring system" includes a ring system comprised of two fused rings in which at<br><br>
 one ring atom is not carbon and can be aromatic or non aromatic, as defined above. The term "halogen", either alone or in compound words such as "haloalkyl", includes when used in cnm-nound words such as<br><br>
WO 01/70671	PCT/US01/09338<br>
"haloalkyl", said alkyl may be partially or fully substituted with halogen atoms which may be the same'or different. Examples of "haloalkyl" include F3C, CICH2, CF3CH2 and CF3CC12. The terms "haloalkenyl", "haloalkynyl", "haloalkoxy", and the like, are defined analogously to the term "haloalkyl". Examples of "haloalkenyl" include (C1)20=CHCH2 5     and CF3 CH2CH=CHCH2. Examples of "haloalkynyl" include HCsCCHCL CF3OC, CCI3OC and FCH2OCCH2. Examples of "haloalkoxy" include CF30, CC13CH20, HCF2CH2CH20 and CF3CH20.<br>
The total number of carbon atoms in a substituent group is indicated by the "Ci-Cj" prefix where i and j are numbers from 1 to 6. For example, CyC^ alkylsulfonyl designates<br>
10     methylsulfonyl through propylsulfonyl; C2 alkoxyalkyl designates CH3OCH2; C3<br>
alkoxyalkyl designates, for example, CH3CH(OCH3), CH3OCH2CH2 or CH3CH2OCH2; and C4 alkoxyalkyl designates the various isomers of an alkyl group substituted with an alkoxy group containing a total of four carbon atoms, examples including CH3CH2CH2OCH2 and CH3CH2OCH2CH2. In the above recitations, when a compound of<br>
15     Formula 1 contains a heterocyclic ring, all substituents are attached to this ring through any available carbon or nitrogen by replacement of a hydrogen on said carbon or nitrogen.<br>
When a group contains a substituent which can be hydrogen, for example R3, then, when this substituent is taken as hydrogen, it is recognized that this is equivalent to said group being unsubstituted.<br>
20 -	• Compounds of this invention can exist as one or more stereoisomers. The various<br>
stereoisomers include enantiomers, diastereomers, atropisomers and geometric isomers. One skilled in the art will appreciate that one stereoisomer may be more active and/or may exhibit beneficial effects when enriched relative to the other stereoisomer(s) or when separated from the other stereoisomer(s). Additionally, the skilled artisan knows how to<br>
25      separate, enrich, and/or to selectively prepare said stereoisomers. Accordingly, the compounds of the invention may be present as a mixture of stereoisomers, individual stereoisomers, or as an optically active form.<br>
The present invention comprises compounds selected from Formula 1, JV-oxides and agriculturally suitable salts thereof. One skilled in the art will appreciate that not all nitrogen<br>
30     containing heterocycles can form iV-oxides since the nitrogen requires an available lone pair for oxidation to the oxide; one skilled in the art will recognize those nitrogen containing heterocycles which can form TV-oxides. One skilled in the art will also recognize that tertiary amines can form N-oxides. Synthetic methods for the preparation of iV-oxides of heterocycles and tertiary amines are very well known by one skilled in the art including the<br>
35     oxidation of heterocycles and tertiary amines with peroxy acids such as peracetic and ffz-chloroperbenzoic acid (MCPB A), hydrogen peroxide, alkyl hydroperoxides such as f-butyl hydroperoxide, sodium perborate, and dioxiranes such as dimethydioxirane. These methods fnr the nrp.nnration nf W-nviHp.5 havp been extensivelv described and reviewed in the<br>

One or more of the following methods and variations as described in Schemes 1-17 can be used to prepare the compounds of Formula 1. The definitions of A, B, J, R1, R2, R3,<br>
25 R4, R5, R6, R7, m and n in the compounds of Formulae 1-34 below are as defined above in the Summary of the Invention. Compounds of Formulae la-c, 2a-b, 4a-g, 5a-b are various subsets of the compounds of Formula 1,2,4 and 5.<br>
Compounds of Formula 1 can be prepared by procedures outlined in Schemes 1-17. A typical procedure is detailed in Scheme 1 and involves coupling of an anthranilic amide of   .<br>
30     Formula 2 with an acid chloride of Formula 3 in the presence of an acid scavenger to provide the compound of Formula la. Typical acid scavengers include amine bases such as triethylarnine, diisopropylemylarnine and pyridine; other scavengers include hydroxides such as sodium and potassium hydroxide and carbonates such as sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate. In certain instances it is useful to use polymer-supported acid scavengers such as<br>
35     polymer-bound diisopropylemylarnine and polymer-bound dimethylammopyridine. In a<br>
subsequent step, amides of Formula la can be converted to thioamides of Formula lb using a variety of standard thip transfer reagents including phosphorus.pentasulfide and Lawesson's reagent<br>
WO 01/70671	PCT/US01/09338<br><br>
An alternate procedure for the preparation of compounds of Formula la involves coupling of an anthranilic amide of Formula 2 with an acid of Formula 4 in the presence of a 5     dehydrating agent such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC). Polymer supported reagents are again useful here, such as polymer-bound cyclohexylcarbodiimide. Synthetic procedures of Schemes 1 and 2 are only representative examples of useful methods for the preparation . of Formula 1 compounds as-the synthetic literature is extensive for this type of reaction.<br>
10 <br>
One skilled in the art will also realize that acid chlorides of Formula 3 may be prepared from acids of Formula 4 by numerous well-known methods.<br>
Anthranilic amides of Formula 2a are typically available from the corresponding<br>
15     2-Ditrobenzamides of Formula 5 via catalytic hydrogenation of the nitro group. Typical procedures involve reduction with hydrogen in the presence of a metal catalyst such as palladium on carbon or platinum oxide and in hydroxylic solvents such as ethanol and isopropanol. These procedures are well documented in the chemical literature. R1 substituents such as alkyl, substituted alkyl and the like can generally be introduced at this<br>
20     stage through known procedures including either direct alkylation or through the generally preferred method of reductive alkylation of the amine. A commonly employed procedure is to combine the aniline 2a with an aldehyde in the presence of a reducing agent such as sodium cyanoborohydride to produce the Formula 2b compounds where R1 is alkyl, alkenyl, aSk^nyl ox substituted derivatives thereof.<br>
WO 01/70671	PCTYUS01/09338<br><br>
The intermediate amides of Formula 5a are readily prepared from commercially 5     available 2-nitrobenzoic acids. Typical methods for amide formation can be applied here. These include direct dehydrative coupling of acids of Formula 6 with amines of Formula 7 using for example DCC, and conversion of the acids to an activated form such as the acid chlorides or anhydrides and subsequent coupling with amines to form amides of Formula 5a. We have found ethylchloroformate to be an especially useful reagent for this type of reaction 10     involving activation of the acid. The chemical literature is extensive on this type of reaction. Amides of Formula 5a are readily converted to thioamides of Formula 5b by using commercially available thio transfer reagents such as phosphorus pentasulfide and Lawesson's reagent.<br>

Benzoic acids of Formula 4 (J is optionally substituted phenyl) are generally well known in the art as are procedures for their preparation. One particularly useful subset of benzoic acids of this invention are 2-methyl-4-perfluoroalkyl benzoic acids of Formula 4a (R5 equals e.g. CF3, C2F5, C3F7). The synthesis for these compounds is outlined in 20     Schemes 5-9. Benzoic acids of Formula 4a may be prepared from the benzonitriles of Formula 8 by hydrolysis. The conditions used may involve the use of a base such as an alkaline metal hydroxide or alkoxide (e.g. potassium or sodium hydroxide) in a solvent such as water, ethanol or ethylene glycol (e.g. J. Chem. Soc. 1948,1025). Alternatively, the<br><br>
WO 01/70671	PCT/US01/09338<br>
V.<br>
hydrolysis may be carried out using an acid such, as sulfuric acid or phosphoric acid in a<br>
suitable solvent such as water (e.g. Org. S^mth. 1955, Coll vol. 3, 557). The choice of the<br>
conditions is contingent on the stability of R5 to the reaction conditions and elevated<br>
. temperatures are usually employed to achieve this transformation.<br><br>
5	Nitriles of Formula 8 may be prepared from anilines of Formula 9 by the classical<br>
sequence involving diazotization and treatment of the intermediate diazonium salt with a copper cyanide salt (e.g. J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 1902,24,1035).<br>
Scheme 6<br><br>
Anilines of Formula 9 may be prepared from compounds of Formula 10. This 10     transformation may be achieved by a well-known procedure that employs Raney Nickel (Org. Synth. Coll. Vol VI, 581). Alternatively, the same transformation may be effected by the use of a suitable catalyst such as palladium in the presence of hydrogen. The reaction is visually conducted at pressures of 102 to 105 kPa in a suitable organic solvent such as, but not limited to, toluene. Elevated temperatures of 80-110°C are usually required to achieve 15     the transformation. As one skilled in the art will realize, numerous chemical modifications of the thioether moiety are possible, and may be employed when necessary to facilitate this transformation.<br><br>
WO 01/70671	PCT/US01/09338<br><br>
Compounds of Formula 10 may be prepared from immosuliuranes of Formula 11. The transformation may be achieved in a protic solvent such as methanol or water, in a non-protic solvent such as dichloromethane or toluene in the presence of a suitable base such as triethylamine (e.g. Org. Synth. Coll. Vol. VI, 581) or sodium methoxide, or in a 5...  /combination of a protic solvent, a protic solvent and a base. The temperature at which the reaction is conducted is usually in the range 40-110°C. As one skilled in the art will realize, suitable salts of compounds of Formula 11 such as, but not limited to a hydrochloride, a sulfate or a bisulfate may also be employed, provided that the appropriate amount of base is first used to generate the free base 11. This may be done as a separate step or as an integral 10     part of the step involving the transformation of compounds of Formula 11 to compounds of Formula 10. <br>
Compounds of Formula 11 may be prepared from anilines of Formula 12 by reaction with dimethyl sulfide and a suitable chlorinating agent such as, but not limited to<br>
15   ' iV-cHorosuccinirtude (e.g. Org. Synth. Coll. Vol. VI, 581), chlorine or<br>
iV-chlorobenzotriazole. Alternatively, anilines of Formula 12 may be treated with dimethyl sulfoxide which has been "activated" by treatment with an agent such as acetic anhydride, trifluoroacetic, anhydride, trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride, cyclohexylcarbodiimide, sulfur trioxide, or phosphorus pentoxide. The reaction is conducted in a.suitable organic<br>
20     solvent such as dichloromethane or dimethyl sulfoxide. The reaction is conducted at a temperature of-70°C to 25°C and is dependent on the solvent and reagent used.<br><br>
WO 01/70671	PCT/US01/09338<br><br>
Intermediate anthranilic amides of Formula 2a and 2b may also be prepared from isatoic anhydrides of Formula 13 and 14 (Scheme 10). Typical procedures involve combination of equimolar amounts of the amine 7 with the isatoic anhydride in polar aprotic 5     solvents such as pyridine and dimethylformamide at temperatures ranging from room<br>
temperature to 100° C. R1 substituents such as alkyl and substituted alkyl may be introduced by the base catalyzed alkylation of isatoic anhydride 13 with known alkylating reagents RJ-Lg (wherein Lg is a leaving group such as halogen, alkyl or aryl suphonates or alkyl sulfates) to provide the alkyl substituted intermediates 14. Isatoic anhydrides of Formula 13 10     may be made by methods described in Coppola, Synthesis 505-36 (1980).<br><br>
An alternate procedure for the preparation of specific compounds of Formula 1 (where A is Q, B is O and RJ is H) involves reaction of an amine 7 with a benzoxaainone of Formula 15. Typical procedures involve combination of the amine with the benzoxazinone 15     in solvents such as tetrahydrofuran or pyridine at temperatures ranging from room<br>
WO 01/70671	PCT/US01/09338<br>
temperature to the reflux temperature of the solvent. Benzoxazinones are well documented in the chemical literature and are available via known methods that involve the coupling of either an anthranilic acid or an isatoic anhydride with an acid chloride. For references to the synthesis and chemistry of Benzoxazinones see Jakobsen et al, Biorgarde and Medicinal 5      Chemistry, 2000, 8, 2095-2103 and references cited within.

The synthesis of representative pyrazole acids (4d-4g) is depicted in Schemes 14-17. Pyrazoles 4d are described in Scheme 14. The synthesis of Scheme 14 involves as the keyWO 01/70671	PCT7US01/09338<br>
step introduction of the R7(b) substituent via alkylation of the pyrazole. The alkylating agent R7(b)-Lg (wherein Lg is a leaving group such as CI, Br, I, sulfonates such as p-toluenesulfonate or methanesulfonate or sulfates such as -S02OR7(b)) includes R7(b) groups such as CrC6 alkyl, C2-C6 alkenyl, CyCs alkynyl, C3-C6 cycloalkyl, CrC6 haloalkyl, C2-5     C6 haloalkenyl, C2-C6 haloalkynyl, C3-Cg halocycloalkyl, C2-C6 alkylcarbonyl, C2-C6 alkoxycarbonyl, C3-Cg dialkylaminocarbonyl, C3-C6 trialkylsilyl; or phenyl, beazyl, benzoyl, 5- or 6-membered heteroaromatic ring or an aromatic 8-, 9- or 10-membered fused heterobicyclic ring system, each ring or ring system optionally substituted.

Pyrazoles acids of Formula 4g are described in Scheme 17. These can be prepared via 3+2 cycloaddition of an appropriately substituted nitrilimine with either substituted propiolates (33) or acrylates (36). Cycloaddition with acrylates requires additional oxidation 5     of the intermediate pyrazoline to the pyrazole. Hydrolysis of the ester affords the pyrazole acids 4g. Preferred irninohalides for this reaction include the trifiuorornethyl irninochloride (38) and the irninodibromide (39). Compounds such as 38 are known (J. Heterocycl Chem. 1985,22(2), 565-8).

Formulation/Utility<br>
Compounds of this invention will generally be used as a formulation or composition with an agriculturally suitable carrier comprising at least one of a liquid diluent, a solid diluent or a surfactant. The formulation or composition ingredients are selected to be , •  5     consistent with the physical properties of the active ingredient, mode of application and environmental factors such, as soil type, moisture and temperature. Useful formulations include liquids such as solutions (including emulsifiable concentrates), suspensions, emulsions (including microemulsions and/or suspoemulsions) and the like which optionally can be thickened into gels. Useful formulations further include solids such as dusts, 10     powders, granules, pellets, tablets, films, and the like which can be water-dispersible<br>
("wettable") or water-soluble. Active ingredient can be (micro)encapsulated and further formed into a suspension or solid formulation; alternatively the entire formulation of active ingredient can be encapsulated (or "overcoated"). Encapsulation can control or delay release of the active ingredient. Sprayable formulations can be extended in suitable media and used 15     at spray volumes from about one to several hundred liters per hectare. High-strength compositions are primarily used as intermediates for further formulation.<br>
The formulations will typically-contain effective amounts of active ingredient, diluent and surfactant within the following approximate ranges that add up to 100 percent by weight.<br>

Arthropod pests are controlled and protection of agronomic, horticultural and<br>
20     specialty crops, animal and human health is achieved by applying one or more of the . compounds of this invention, in an effective amount, to the environment of the pests including the agronomic and/or nonagronomic locus of infestation, to the area to be protected, or directly on the pests to be controlled. Thus, the present invention further comprises a method for the control of foliar and soil inhabiting arthropods and nematode<br>
25     pests and protection of agronomic and/or nonagronomic crops, comprising applying one or more of the compounds of the invention, or compositions containing at least one such compound, in an effective amount, to the environment of the pests including the agronomic and/or nonagronomic locus of infestation, to the area to be protected, or directly on the pests to be controlled. A preferred method of application is by spraying. Alternatively, granular<br>
30     formulations of these compounds can be applied to the plant foliage or the soil. Other methods of application include direct and residual sprays, aerial sprays, seed coats, microencapsulations, systemic uptake, baits, eartags, boluses, foggers, fumigauts, aerosols, dusts and many others. The compounds can be incorporated into baits that are consumed by-the arthropods or in devices such as traps and the like.<br>
3 5	The compounds of this invention can be applied in their pure state, but most often<br>
application will be of a formulation comprising one or more compounds with suitable carriers, diluents, and surfactants and possibly in combination with a food depending on the contemplated end use. A preferred method of application involves spraying a water<br>
WO 01/70671	PCI7US01/09338<br>
dispersion or refined oil solution of the compounds. Combinations with spray oils, spray oil<br>
concentrations, spreader stickers, adjuvants, other solvents, and synergists such as piperonyl<br>
butoxide often enhance compound efficacy.	
The rate of application required for effective control will depend on such factors as 5     the species of arthropod to be controlled, the pest's life cycle, life stage, its size, location, time of year, host crop or animal, feeding behavior, mating behavior, ambient moisture, temperature, and the like. Under normal circumstances, application rates of about 0.01 to 2 kg of active ingredient per hectare are sufficient to control pests in agronomic ecosystems, but as little as 0.001 kg/hectare may be sufficient or as much as 8 kg/hectare may be<br>
10     required. For nonagronomic applications, effective use rates will range from about 1.0 to 50 mg/square meter but as little as 0.1 mg/square meter may be sufficient or as much as 150 mg/square meter may be required.<br>
The following TEST demonstrates the control efficacy of compounds of tins invention on specific pests. "Control efficacy" represents inhibition of arthropod<br>
15     development (including mortality) that causes significantly reduced feeding. The pest<br>
control protection afforded by the compounds is not limited, however, to these species. See Index Tables A through Q for compound descriptions.

BIOLOGICAL EXAMPLES OF THE INVENTION<br>
TEST Application: Compounds are formulated in a 10% acetone, 90% water and 300 ppm X-77 surfactant solution, unless otherwise indicated. The formulated compounds are applied 5     with a SUJ2 atomizer nozzle with 1/8 JJ custom body (Spraying Systems) positioned Vi' above the top of each test unit There are 6 of these nozzles that make up the spray boom and this is fixed in a belt sprayer. A rack (or carrier) of 6 different insect test units is placed on the conveyor belt and stops so that each unit is centered under a nozzle. Once the rack is centered, 1 mL of liquid is sprayed into each test unit; the rack then continues down the belt 10     to the end of the sprayer to be off-loaded. All experimental compounds in this screen are sprayed at 250 ppm and replicated three times.<br>
Diamondback Moth (DBM) - Plutella Xylostella: The test unit consists of a small self-contained unit with a 12-14 day old radish plant inside. These are pre-infested (using a core sampler) with 10-15 neonate larvae on apiece of insect diet. Once 1 mL of formulated 15     compound has been sprayed into each test unit, the test units are allowed to dry for 1 hour before a black, screened cap-is placed on the top of the cylinder.
