Synergistically acting herbicidal mixtures<br>
The present invention relates to a synergistic herbicidal mixture comprising<br>
A)	picolinafen (I)<br><br>
or one of its environmentally compatible salts; and<br>
B)	a synergistically effective amount of at least a triazolopyrimidine herbicide<br>
selected from the triazolopyrimidine sulfonamides and penoxsulam;<br>
or one of its environmentally compatible salts or esters;<br>
and, if desired,<br>
C)	at least a safener selected from the group of dichlormid, benoxacor,<br>
LAB 145 138, MG-191, furilazole, cyometrinil, oxabetrinil, fluxofenim, flurazole, naphthalic acid anhydride, fenclorim, fenchlorazole-ethyl, mefenpyr, isoxadifen, cloquintocet, 1-ethyl-4-hydroxy-3(1 H-tetrazol-5-yl)-1 H-quinolin-2-one, 4-carboxy-methyl-chroman-4-carboxylic acid, N-(2-methoxybenzyl)-4-(3-methylureido)-benzenesulfon-amide and (3-oxo-isothiochroman-4-ylidenmethoxy)acetic acid methyl ester;<br>
or one of its environmentally compatible salts, esters or amides;<br>
The invention furthermore relates to herbicidal compositions comprising a herbicidally active amount of a synergistic herbicidal mixture as defined above and at least one liquid and/or solid carrier and, if desired, at least one surfactant.<br>
Moreover, the invention relates to processes for the preparation of these compositions and to a method of controlling undesirable vegetation.<br><br>
WO 94/07368 and WO 01/26466 disclose mixtures of picolinafen with special further herbicides. However, in crop protection products, it is always desirable to increase the specific activity of an active ingredient and the reliability of action. It is an object of the present invention to increase the activity and/or selectivity of picolinafen against undesirable harmful plants.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by the mixtures defined at the outset. We have furthermore found herbicidal compositions which comprise these mixtures, processes for their preparation, and methods of controlling undesirable vegetation. In the last-mentioned cases, it is irrelevant whether the herbicidally active compounds of group A), B) and, if desired, C) are formulated and applied jointly or separately and in which sequence they are applied in the case of separate application.<br>
The mixtures according to the invention show a synergistic effect; the compatibility of the herbicidally active compounds of group A), B) and, if desired C) for certain crop plants is generally retained.<br>
Suitable triazolopyrimidine sulfonamides are for example optionally substituted (1,2,4)triazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidine sulfonamides and optionally substituted (1,2,4)triazolo-[1,5-a]pyrimidine sulfonamides.<br>
When any compounds are designated as being optionally substituted, the substituent groups which are optionally present may be any of those customarily employed in the modification and/or development of pesticidal compounds and are especially substituents that maintain or enhance the herbicidal activity associated with the compounds of the present invention, or influence persistence of action, soil or plant penetration, or any other desirable property of such herbicidal compounds. There may be one or more of the same or different substituents present in each part of the molecule.<br>

The compound "carfenstrole (CH-900)" is mentioned in EP-A 332 133, and the compound N-[[[4-methoxy-6-(trifluoro-methyl)-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl]amino]-carbonyl]-2-(trifluoromethyl-benzenesulfonamide) is described in PCT/EP 96/03996.<br>
The assignment of the active ingredients to the respective mechanisms of action is based on current knowledge. If several mechanisms of action apply to one active ingredient, this substance was only assigned to one mode of action.<br>
The present invention also extends to herbicidal compositions which comprise a herbicidally active amount of a synergistic herbicidal mixture (comprising a compound of group A), a compound of group B), if desired, a compound of group C) and, if desired, a compound of group D) as described above), at least one liquid and/or solid carrier and, if desired, at least one surfactant.<br>
The herbicidal compositions and synergistic herbicidal mixtures according to the invention can effect very good control of broad-leaved weeds and grass weeds in crops such as maize, cereals, rice and soya without damaging the crop plants, an effect observed especially even at low rates of application.<br>
Taking into consideration the variety of application method in question, the herbicidal compositions and synergistic herbicidal mixtures according to the invention can additionally be employed in a further number of crop plants for eliminating undesirable plants. Examples of suitable crops are the following:<br>
Allium cepa, Ananas comosus, Arachis hypogaea, Asparagus officinalis, Beta vulgaris ssp. altissima, Beta vulgaris ssp. rapa, Brassica napus var. napus, Brassica napus var. napobrassica, Brassica rapa var. silvestris, Camellia sinensis, Carthamus tinctorius, Carya illinoinensis, Citrus limon, Citrus sinensis, Coffea arabica (Coffea canephora, Coffea liberica), Cucumis sativus, Cynodon dactylon, Daucus carota, Elaeis guineensis, Fragaria vesca, Glycine max, Gossypium hirsutum, (Gossypium arboreum, Gossypium herbaceum, Gossypium vitifolium), Helianthus annuus, Hevea brasiliensis,<br><br>
Hordeum vulgare, Humulus lupulus, Ipomoea batatas, Jugians regia, Lens culinaris, Linum usitatissimum, Lycopersicon lycopersicum, Malus spp., Manihot esculenta, Medicago sativa, Musa spp., Nicotiana tabacum (N.rustica), Olea europaea, Oryza sativa, Phaseolus lunatus, Phaseolus vulgaris, Picea abies, Pinus spp., Pisum sativum, Prunus avium, Prunus persica, Pyrus communis, Ribes sylvestre, Ricinus communis, Saccharum officinarum, Secale cereale, Solanum tuberosum, Sorghum bicolor (s. vulgare), Theobroma cacao, Trifolium pratense, Triticum aestivum, Triticum durum, Vicia faba, Vitis vinifera und Zea mays.<br>
Moreover, the herbicidal compositions and synergistic herbicidal mixtures according to the invention may also be employed for controlling harmful plants in modified crops. These modified crops are obtained by genetic engineering methods or by breeding, and - as a rule - they are distinguished by particular, advantageous properties, for example by resistance to certain crop protection agents, resistance to plant diseases or pathogens causing plant diseases such as particular insects or microorganism such as fungi, bacteria or viruses. Other particular properties relate, for example, to the harvested material in terms of quality, storing properties, composition and specific constitutions.<br>
The mixtures according to the invention, or the herbicidal compositions comprising them, can be employed, for example, in the form of directly sprayable aqueous solutions, powders, suspensions, also highly-concentrated aqueous, oily or other suspensions or dispersions, emulsions, oil dispersions, pastes, dusts, materials for spreading or granules, by means of spraying, atomizing, dusting, spreading or pouring.<br>
The use forms depend on the intended purposes; in any case, they should guarantee the finest possible distribution of the active ingredients according to the invention.<br>
Suitable inert auxiliaries are mineral oil fractions of medium to high boiling point such as kerosene and diesel oil, furthermore coal tar oils and oils of vegetable or animal origin, aliphatic, cyclic and aromatic hydrocarbons, e.g. paraffins, tetrahydronaph-thalene, alkylated naphthalenes and their derivatives, alkylated benzenes and their derivatives, alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol and cyclohexanol, ketones such as cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents, such as N-methylpyrrolidone and water.<br>
Aqueous use forms can be prepared from emulsion concentrates, suspensions, pastes, wettable powders or water-dispersible granules by adding water. To prepare emulsions, pastes or oil dispersions, the substances, as such or dissolved in an oil or solvent, can be homogenized in water by means of wetting agent, tackifier, dispersant<br><br>
or emulsifier. However, it is also possible to prepare concentrates composed of active substance, wetting agent, tackifier, dispersant or emulsifier and, if appropriate, solvent or oil, and these concentrates are suitable for dilution with water.<br>
Suitable surfactants are the alkali metal, alkaline earth metal and ammonium salts of aromatic sulfonic acids, e.g. ligno-, phenol-, naphthalene- and dibutylnaphthalene-sulfonic acid, and of fatty acids, of alkyl- and alkylaryl sulfonates, of alkyl sulfates, lauryl ether sulfates and fatty alcohol sulfates, and salts of sulfated hexa-, hepta- and octadecanols, and of fatty alcohol glycol ether, condensates of sulfonated naphthalene and its derivatives with formaldehyde, condensates of naphthalene, or of the naphthalenesulfonic acids, with phenol and formaldehyde, polyoxyethylene octylphenyl ether, ethoxylated isooctyl-, octyl- or nonylphenol, alkylphenyl and tributylphenyl polyglycol ether, alkylaryl polyether alcohols, isotridecyl alcohol, fatty alcohol/ethylene oxide condensates, ethoxylated castor oil, polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers or polyoxypropylene alkyl ethers, lauryl alcohol polyglycol ether acetate, sorbitol esters, lignin-sulfite waste liquors or methylcellulose.<br>
Powders, materials for spreading and dusts can be prepared by mixing or concomitantly grinding the synergistic herbicidal mixture or the individual active ingredients with a solid carrier.<br>
Granules, e.g. coated granules, impregnated granules and homogeneous granules, can be prepared by binding the active ingredients to solid carriers. Solid carriers are mineral earths such as silicas, silica gels, silicates, talc, kaolin, limestone, lime, chalk, bole, loess, clay, dolomite, diatomaceous earth, calcium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, magnesium oxide, ground synthetic material, fertilizers such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium phosphate, ammonium nitrate, ureas and products of vegetable origin such as cereal meal, tree bark meal, wood meal and nutshell meal, cellulose powders or other solid carriers.<br>
The concentrations of the mixtures according to the invention in the ready-to-use products can be varied within wide ranges. In general, the formulations comprise from 0.01 to 95% by weight, preferably 0.5 to 90% by weight, of the mixture according to the invention.<br>
The compounds of the groups A) and B), if desired, C) and, if desired D), can be formulated jointly, but also separately, and/or applied to the plants, their environment and/or seeds jointly or separately.<br><br>
In case a compound of group C) is present in the mixture according to the invention it can be used for penetrating the seed of a crop plant (seed dresing), or be incorporated into the seed furrows prior to sowing. The other compounds of the groups A), B) and, if desired, D) are applied then separatly from the compound of group C).<br>
It is preferable to apply the active ingredients simultaneously. However, it is also possible to apply them separately.<br>
Moreover, it may be advantageous to apply the herbicidal compositions and synergistic herbicidal mixtures according to the invention, jointly or separately, with additional other crop protection agents, for example with pesticides or agents for controlling phytopathogenic fungi or bacteria. Also of interest is the miscibility with mineral salt solutions which are employed for treating nutritional and trace element deficiencies. Non-phytotoxic oils and oil concentrates can also be added.<br>
The mixtures according to the invention and the herbicidal compositions can be applied pre- or post-emergence. If the active ingredients are less well tolerated by certain crop plants, application techniques may be used in which the herbicidal compositions are sprayed, with the aid of the spray apparatus, in such a way that they come into as little contact, if any, with the leaves of the sensitive crop plants while reaching the leaves of undesirable plants which grow underneath, or the bare soil (post-directed, lay-by).<br>
In the case of a post-emergence treatment of the plants, the herbicidal compositions according to the invention are preferably applied by foliar application. Application may be effected, for example, by usual spraying techniques with water as the carrier, using amounts of spray mixture of approx. 100 to 1000 l/ha. The compositions may also be applied by the so-called "low-volume" and "ultra-low-volume" methods, or in the form of so-called granules.<br>
As a rule, the synergistic herbicidal mixtures comprise the compounds of the groups A) and B) if desired, C) and, if desired, D) in such weight ratios that the synergistic effect takes place.<br>
The ratios of the compounds of the groups A) and B) in the mixture preferably range from 1:0.0002 to 1:50, preferably from 1:0.005 to 1:7.5, particularly preferably from 1:0.01 to 1:4.<br>

Use examples<br>
The mixtures according to the invention were applied pre- or post-emergence (foliar treatment). The herbicidal compounds of groups A) and B) and, if desired, C) and, if desired, D) were applied in the formulation in which they are present as commercially available product.<br>
The herbicidally active compounds of the groups A), B) and, if desired, C) and, if desired, D) were applied in succession or jointly, in the latter case in some cases as a tank mix and in some cases as a readymix, in the form of emulsions, aqueous solutions or suspensions, the vehicle being water (300 - 400 l/ha). In the case of the field trials, application was effected with the aid of a mobile plot sprayer.<br>
The test period extended over 3 to 8 weeks, and the stands were also observed at later points in time.<br>
Damage by the herbicidal compositions was evaluated with reference to a scale of 0% to 100% in comparison with untreated control plots. 0 means no damage and 100 means complete destruction of the plants.<br>
The following examples will demonstrate the action of the herbicidal compositions which can be used according to the invention, without excluding the possibility of other uses.<br>
In these examples, the value E at which only an additive effect of the individual active ingredients is to be expected was calculated by the method of S. R. Colby (Calculating synergistic and antagonistic responses of herbicide combinations, Weeds 15, 20 pp (1967)).<br><br>
This was done using the formula<br>
XY<br>
E  = X  +  Y  -   	<br>
100<br>
where<br>
X =    Percentage of the herbicidal action of the compound of group A) at an application rate of a;<br>
Y =    Percentage of the herbicidal action of the compound of group B) at an application rate of b;<br>
E =  expected herbicidal action of the compounds of the groups A) + B) at rates of application a + b (in %).<br>
If the value observed exceeds the value E calculated in accordance with Colby's formula, then synergism is present.<br>
The herbicidal mixtures according to the invention, like mixtures of picolinafen with florasulam or picolinafen with metosulam at appropriate application rates under post emergence conditions, exert a greater herbicidal action than would have been expected according to Colby on the basis of the observed effects of the individual components when used alone.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
