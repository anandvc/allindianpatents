b)  at least one insecticide selected from insecticides of the formulae II to XI<br><br><br><br><br><br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide mixtures which, on the one hand, have good fungicidal activity, in particular against fungal diseases in rice and, on the other hand, good insecticidal activity. Since in the climatic regions in which rice is cultivated, harmful insects are usually also encountered in great numbers, a combination of fungicidal and insecticidal activity is desirable.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by the mixtures claimed in claim 1.<br>
The compounds of the formula I and their preparation are known per se and described in the literature (WO 97/15,552\.  The insecticides of the formulae II to IX I sic] are also known and described in the literature. Additionally, they are commercially available under the trade names mentioned,below in brackets:<br>

Owing to their C=C and C=N double bonds, the preparation of the compounds I may yield E/Z isomer mixtures which can be separated into the individual compounds in a customary manner, for example by crystallization or chromatography.<br>
However, if the synthesis yields isomer mixtures, a separation is generally not necessarily required since in some cases the individual isomers can be converted into one another during the preparation for use or upon use (for example under the action of light, acids or bases). Similar conversions may also occur after use, for example in the treatment of plants in the treated plant or in the harmful fungus or animal pest to be controlled.<br>
With regard to the C=X double bond, preference is given to the E isomers of the compounds I (configuration based on the -OCH3 or the -CH3 group in relation to the -COaR1 group) with respect to their activity.<br>
With regard to the -C(R3)=NOCH2- double bond, preference is given to the cis isomers of the compounds I (configuration based on the radical R1 in relation to the -OCH2- group) with respect to their activity.<br><br>
In the definitions of the compounds I given at the outset, collective terms were used which generally represent the following groups:<br>
Halogen: fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine;<br>

An efficacy of 0 means that the infection level of the treated plants corresponds to that of the untreated control plants; an efficacy of 100 means that the treated plants were not infected.<br>
The expected efficacies of the mixtures of the active ingredients were determined using Colby's formula [R.S. Colby, Weeds 15. 20-22 (1967)] and compared with the observed efficacies,<br>
Colby's formula: E = x + y – x,y/100<br>

Use Example 1 - Activity against Pyricularia oryzae (protective)<br>
Leaves of potted rice seedlings c.v. "Tai-Nong 67" were sprayed to runoff point with an aqueous preparation of active ingredient which had been prepared from a stock solution comprising 10% of active ingredient, 63% of cyclohexanone and 27% of emulsifier. The following day, the plants were innoculated with an aqueous spore suspension of Pyricularia oryzae. The test plants were subsequently placed in climatized chambers at 22-24oc and 95-99% relative atmospheric humidity for 6 days. The extent of the development of the disease on the leaves was then determined visually.<br>
The visually determined values for the percentage of diseased leaf area were converted into efficacies as percent of the untreated control. An efficacy of 0 means the same disease level as in the untreated control, an efficacy of 100 means 0% disease-The expected efficacies for active ingredient combinations were determined using Colby's formula (Colby, S. R.: "Calculating synergistic and antagonistic responses of herbicide combinations". Weeds 15, pp. 20-22, 1967) and compared with the observed efficacies.<br>
As component a), use was made of the following compound I':<br><br><br>
The test results show that for all mixing ratios, the observed efficacy is higher than the efficacy which had been calculated beforehand using Colby's formula.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
