The present invention relates to a herbal broad spectrum antimicrobial dermatological composition and the process for manufacturing this herbal broad spectrum antimicrobial dermatological composition.<br>
Nature has a bounty of plants and natural agents, which show promising anti-microbial activity. Synthetic anti-microbial agents are often active only against a narrow spectrum of bacteria/fungi and in cases where stronger doses are necessitated, the synthetic agents generally express side effects . More over, the phenomenon of development of resistance by microbes is very common. Natural agents are generally safe and since the chemistry of the molecules are very complex compared to their synthetic counterparts, it becomes all the more difficult for the microbes to develop resistance.<br>
Wound infections are mainly caused by Gram negative bacteria like Psuedomonas aeroginosa (other species oiPsuedomonas also) and Gram positive bacteria like Staphylococcus aureus. Fungal species of the genus Microsporum, Trichophyton and Epidermophyton are normally responsible for causing skin diseases.<br>
The present invention serves as a muUipurpose dermatological cream which is effective against a broad range of bacteria and flingi, and also possesses antinflammatory and wound-healing properties. To arrive at this invention, a large number of Indian medicinal plants were screened using 'well-bore' technique as well as checked using isobologram. Finally, only those ingredients exhibiting synergistic effect with each other were selected. The novehy of this invention, therefore lies not only in its composition, but also in the way its ingredients are processed and blended with each other, so that their synergistic potential is expressed maximally.<br>
Majority of the antimicrobial ointments/creams available in the market are synthetic in origin and contain antibiotic compounds. These compounds generally have specific and narrow spectrum of antimicrobial activity. Moreover, they pose a risk of the microbes developing resistance to them, thus making the formulation ineffective. The present herbal broad spectrum antimicrobial dermatological composition contains natural ingredients having a broad spectrum activity against a range of microbes and are therefore preferable. Being natural substances, the chemistry is quite complex and risks of microbes developing resistance to these comoounds is neplioihlp<br><br>
ine neroai composition consists of plant derivatives derived from members of Labiatae, Poaceae and the like,<br>
Ocimum sanctum is an aromatic herb belonging to the family Labiatae, and is found to occur throughout India. It contains an essential oil which is known to have potent antimicrobial activity and contains a phenyl propanoid compound called eugenol. The chemical structure is given below in figure 1 (enclosed in drawing sheet)<br>
Cymbopogon citratus commonly called as Lemon grass is known for its aromatic oil. The oil contains a substance called Citral which is responsible for its characteristic. Cymbopogon citratus is a grass belonging to the family Poaceae. The chemical structure is given below in figure 2 (enclosed in drawing sheet)<br>
According to the present invention, a process for the preparation of a herbal board spectrum anti microbial, dermatological composition comprising,<br>
(a)	the mixutre - A (consisting of two essential oils)taken in the range of 1 - 5% w/w, which are mixed and stirred,<br>
(b)	the base material (consisting of a plurality of wares) taken in the range of 12-16% by w/w, and melting the said base materials over moist heat to obtain a soft paste,<br>
(c)	adding a fixed oil to the above said soft paste in the range of 8 -12% w/w, and stirring the said mixture of base and oil continuously,<br>
(d)	adding an anti-oxidant in the range of 0.20 - 0.07 w/w to the above said mixture (obtained in<br>
step c),<br>
(e)	adding solubuliser in the range of 3 - 5% w/w to the said mixure,<br>
(f)	heating the said mixture (which is obtained in step-e) to the temperature of 50 - 70°C under a moist temperature to obtain a homogenous Mixture - B,<br>
(g)	adding the said Mixture - A to the Mixture - B under stirring and cooling the said mixture to 40 - 45°C,<br>
(h) adding the preservative solution under stirring in the range of 0.5 to 2% w/w, and finally adding the water under stirring at 40 - 45°C temperature to make the composition 100% w/w, cooling the said composition to room temperature to obtain homogenous cream.<br><br>
The essential oils to obtain the mixture A are minimum two, preferably Cymbopogon citratus and Ocimum sanctum, mixed in the ratio of 1:2.<br>
The base material consists of plurality of waxes such as:<br>
1.	Cetyl alcohol	2 to 5% w/w.<br>
2.	Stearic acid	3.5 to 5.5% w/w.<br>
3.	Glyceryl monostearate	2 to 5% w/w.<br>
4.	Ethylene glycol monostearate	0.1 to 2.5% w/w.<br>
