				<td>Title: A method of Virus-induced Gene Silencing in rice using a vector derived from a DNA virus.<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to the development of a Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) vector using Rice tungro bacilliform virus (RTBV) for inducing transient gene silencing rice. The present invention relates to the use of this vector as a means to "knock down" or silence the expression of rice genes. This method can be useful in determining the function of any gene in rice plant by studying the phenotype in the silenced plants.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
VIGS is a technology that exploits RNA interference (RNAi)-based antiviral defence mechanism in plants as a tool for plant reverse genetics. In plants, the RNAi pathway is triggered as a natural defence response against invading viruses. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) produced as replication intermediates of RNA viruses or highly structured regions of viral transcripts produced during viral infections are efficient inducers for RNAi (Szittya et al.r 2002, Moissiard and Voinnet, 2006). In VIGS, recombinant viruses carrying plant cDNA fragments trigger the silencing of homologous host transcripts by RNAi, enabling this powerful tool to be applied for the analysis<br>
of plant gene function (reviewed by Purkayastha and Dasgupta, 2009). In the last decade it has become an extremely popular tool to create transient "gene knockdowns" in plants, in which there is a transient silencing of the expression of a target gene. Such experiments are a great help in deciphering the functions of a gene and contribute towards functional genomics.<br>
Several viral genomes have been modified for use as VIGS vectors in the last 10 years, most of them for use in dicot species (reviewed by Purkayastha and Dasgupta, 2009). Two VIGS vectors have been reported for use in monocot species, a Barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV)-based vector for use in barley and wheat (Holzberg et al., 2002, Hein et al.r 2005; Scofield et al., 2005) and a Brome mosaic virus (BMV)-based vector for barley, rice and maize (Ding et al., 2006). Both the above vectors are based on the genomes of RNA viruses and their inoculation procedure involves in vitro transcription, which is a cumbersome and expensive procedure. RTBV is a rice virus containing DNA as its genomic material. Such a DNA-based VIGS vector for rice would be very useful for the study of the functions of rice genes and has great potential in discovering new genes which can contribute towards increasing rice production.<br>
Rice is arguably the world's single most important crop being the staple food for over a third of the world's population. Furthermore, the entire genome of rice has been<br>
sequenced and the crop is truly poised for research,on gene functions. The process for the analysis of genes functions in rice needs to be amenable to high-throughput processes, such that a large number of genes can be analyzed in a short period. With that background, the present invention was developed.<br>
We have developed an RTBV-based VIGS vector for creating transient loss-of-function systems in rice. The vector has been used to silence an endogenous marker gene, encoding rice phytoene desaturase (pds). PDS is an enzyme involved in protecting chlorophyll from photo-bleaching. Silencing of pds leads to bleaching of the leaf lamina in dicots and the appearance of white streaks in leaves of monocots. It is widely used as a marker gene to test the efficacy of VIGS vectors in a wide range of plant systems.<br>
The present invention provides a binary plasmid-based VIGS vector derived from RTBV DNA. The vector includes two of the four Open reading frames (ORFs) of the Indian isolate of RTBV. The vascular bundle-specific RTBV promoter (Mathur and Dasgupta, 2007) has been replaced with the constitutive and highly expressed constitutive maize ubiquitin promoter (MUP) in the VIGS vector. Because of the above change in the promoter sequences, a tRNA-binding site has been included in the primer designed to amplify the relevant viral DNA fragments, such that the site is placed immediately after the promoter sequences. This is because<br>
replication of pararetroviruses such as RTBV pass through a reverse transcription phase, during which, reverse transcription primed by a tRNA on the RTBV promoter region is used as the starting step of the negative-strand DNA synthesis. A multiple cloning site has been included at the 3' end of the vector to allow easy cloning of target genes to be silenced.<br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION:<br>
An object of the present invention is to develop a VIGS vector based on RTBV (pRTBV-MVIGS) for gene silencing in rice.<br>

Yet another embodiment of the present invention relates to the providing a method of assay for the accumulation of<br>
transcripts specific for the target gene to be silenced using Real-time PCR after inoculating pRTBV-MVIGS containing the cloned gene of interest.<br>
The construction of pRTBV-MVIGS was confirmed by plasmid isolation and restriction digestion with several enzymes. Before proceeding to use pRTBV-MVIGS as a VIGS vector, the capability of the vector to replicate and accumulate in plants was tested. Rice plants of the variety TN-1, which were 12-15 days old were agroinoculated with pRTBV-MVIGS by injecting 100 µl of a suspension of Agrobacterial cells containing the plasmid in the meristematic region of the plant. The process of agroinoculation is described in Example II. Total DNA was isolated from the plant leaves at 14 dpi and slot -blot analysis was performed. It was seen that more than 80% of all plants inoculated with pRTBV-MVIGS showed clear accumulation of the vector molecule. None of the uninoculated plants showed any " cross-hybridizing signal. The signal intensities shown by the above plants were similar to the infected plants containing RTBV, used as positive control (Fig. 1).<br>
Having ascertained that pRTBV-MVIGS was capable of independently replicating and accumulating in agroinoculated rice plants, a partial cDNA fragment of rice pds was cloned into the Mlul and Pad site of the MCS of pRTBV-MVIGS in antisense orientation. Details of this process are described in Example 1. The pRTBV-MVIGS-pds was confirmed by restriction digestion with Mlul and Pad which led to the release of the pds  insert.<br>
Typical photobleaching phenotype associated with silencing of pds in monocot plants was observed in most plants agroinoculated with pRTBV-MVIGS-pds at 3-5 weeks post-inoculation (Fig. 2, Table I). The phenotype was observed in all emerging leaves for the subsequent 8-10 weeks, after which the emerging leaves remained green in color. The experiment was performed at 27°C and at 30°C to determine whether there was any effect of temperature. It was observed that pds silencing occurred only at 27°C. Repeated attempts to induce pds silencing at 30°C were not successful.<br>

To determine whether there was a change in the levels of accumulation of the pds transcript, total RNA was isolated from plants showing photobleaching phenotype and Real-Time PCR analysis was performed, targeting the pds transcript. The analysis revealed that there was 60-90% decrease in the<br>
levels of accumulation of pds transcript in agroinoculated plants injected with pRTBV-MVTGS-pds as compared to plants inoculated with pRTBV-MVIGS (Fig. 3) .<br>

EXAMPLES:<br>
The examples given are merely illustrative of the uses, processes and products claimed in this invention, and the practice of the invention itself is not restricted to or by the examples described.<br>
Example 1: Construction of RTBV-derived VIGS vector (pRTBV-MVIGS).<br>
The DNA of the Indian isolate of RTBV (Nath et al.t 2003) was used as the starting material for the construction of the VIGS vector. A cassette consisting of MUP, a multiple cloning site and Nos terminator was digested out of the<br>
binary vector pB4NU (Ph.D. thesis, Saurabh Raghuvanshi, University of Delhi, 2001) by digestion with EcoRI and Hindlll and cloned into the promoterless binary vector pCAMBIA2300 to obtain the first intermediate vector pINTl. Only the MUP fragment was digested out of pB4NU by digestion with PstI and cloned into pBSK. The orientation of the MUP fragment in pBSK was determined by digestion with Sail and XbaI. MUP fragment was obtained by digestion with Kpnl and BamHI from the clone in the sense orientation and inserted into pINTl to obtain the second intermediary vector, pINT2, containing two MUP in a direct repeat orientation. Primers were designed to amplify RTBV ORF III and ORF IV from pRTBV204 (Nath et al., 2002) corresponding to nucleotide position 999 to 7183 of RTBV DNA.<br>
The restriction sites for BamHI, SalI and tRNA binding site (to enable the essential tRNA-mediated initiation of reverse transcription to take place, Hay et al., 1991) and Kozak sequence (to ensure translation of ORF III amd ORF IV products, Kozak, 1987) were introduced into the 5' end of the primer in the order mentioned in MVIGS-FP as shown in SEQ ID NO. l(Fig. 4). To insert the Kozak sequence the nucleotides ACC were introduced after the tRNA binding site and a single A nucleotide at position 1003 in the RTBV genome was replaced with G. The concensus Kozak sequence ACCATGG was thus introduced. The revevrse primer fragment, MVIGS-RP containing the recognition sites of ApaI, PacI, AatII, MluI and BamHI shown as SEQ ID No. 2 was introduced into the 3' end of the primer for ease in cloning a test<br>
gene. The primer pair MVIGS-FP/MVIGS-RP was used to PCR amplify approximately 6.1 kb fragment from a pRTBV204 (Nath et al., 2002) using Phusion polymerase (Finnzymes) and the product was cloned into TOPO cloning vector (Invitrogen, USA). The cloned fragment was subsequently released from the TOPO vector using BamHI. The 6.1 kb amplification product was inserted in pINT2, digested with BamHI, and ligated to obtain pRTBV-MVIGS, which was checked for the correctness and orientation of the insert by digestion with restriction enzymes. The vector was named pRTBV-MVIGS (Fig.5).<br>
It has been reported that gene silencing by VIGS is best achieved if the gene to be silenced is inserted in the antisense orientation in the VIGS vector. To construct pRTBV-MVIGS with pds cDNA in antisense orientation, total RNA  was  isolated  from  rice  using  Trizol  reagent<br>
(Invitrogen) to amplify a cDNA corresponding to the pds. A 529 bp cDNA fragment of pds corresponding to nt 211-740 of the rice pds cDNA sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO.  9<br>
(AF049356) was amplified from the cDNA pool of rice using oligonucleotide primer pds-FP and pds-RP shown in SEQ ID No. 3 and SEQ ID No. 4. The primers were designed to include a PacI and Mlul restriction site at the 5' and 3' end of the pds-FP and pds-RP respectively. The cDNA fragments thus obtained was cloned into T/A vector (InsTA cloning Kit, Fermentas), digested with MluI and PacI and cloned in a reverse orientation into the MluI-PacI sites of MCS of pTRBV-MVIGS to give rise to pRTBV-MVIGS-pds.<br>
Example 2: Agroinoculation of plants.<br>
For agroinoculation, all vectors were transformed into Agrobacterium tumefecians strain EHA105 by heat-shock method. Approximately lµg of plasmid DNA for each contract was added to competent cells of Agrobacterium and plunged in liquid nitrogen for two minutes. The tubes were then incubated at 37°C water bath for 5 minutes, followed by on ice for 10 minutes. One ml LB broth was added to each tube and was incubated at 28°C overnight and shaken constantly at 200 rpm. Out of the 1 ml, 200ul was spread on LB plate supplemented with appropriate antibiotics. The transformed colonies obtained were screened by colony PCR methods.<br>
A primary culture was initiated from a single transformed Agrobacterium colony in LB medium supplemented with appropriate antibiotics and grown at 30°C in a shaker overnight. A secondary culture was grown to an OD600. of 0.6-0.8 using similar growing conditions, the cells were harvested and resuspended in l0mM 2-[N-morpholino] ethanesulfonic acid (MES), l0mM MgCl2, 200µM acetosyringone to an OD600 of 20. Approximately 15 day-old rice plants grown in Yoshida's medium (Yoshida et al., 1976) were used for agroinoculation. About 50ul of the bacterial suspension was injected into the meristematic region and the plants were then transferred onto sterile Whatman No. 1 filter paper immersed in Yoshida's medium placed on a solid support with its ends dipped into a reservoir containing the medium. The plants were covered with moist tissue paper<br>
and transferred to tubes containing Yoshida's medium 24 hours post-inoculation and were maintained under conditions mentioned in Example 6.<br>
Example 3: Assay for the accumulation of viral vectors in inoculated plants<br>
DNA slot-blot analysis was performed to measure the accumulation of pRTBV-MVIGS in rice leaves. Total genomic. DNA was isolated from agroinoculated plants 15 days post-inoculation (dpi) using the Purgene method described below. About 15 cm of rice leaf was ground using liquid nitrogen in a mortar-pestle. About 1.5 ml of extraction buffer [10mM Tris-HCL (pH-8.0), lmM EDTA (pH-8.0), 1% SDS] was added to the finely ground tissue and transferred to a fresh microcentrifuge tube. The contents were mixed by vortexing the tube for several seconds. The tubes were incubated at 65°C for 20 minutes followed by cooling on ice for 5 minutes. About 500 µl of 6 M ammonium acetate was added to each of the tubes and the contents were mixed thoroughly. The samples were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 13, 000 rpm at 4°C and the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and centrifuged again under similar conditions to remove any residual debris. The clear supernatant was transferred to two fresh microcentrifuge tubes and to each of the tube 750 µl of isopropanol was added. The tubes were incubated at -20°C for 30 minutes to precipitate the DNA. The samples were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 13, 000 rpm at 4°C to pellet the DNA. The supernatant was discarded and the DNA<br>
pellet thus obtained was washed with 75% ethanol for 10 minutes at 13, 000 rpm at 4°C. The pellet was air-dried and resuspended in 20 µl of buffer (10mM Tris-HCL, pH-8.0; 1mM EDTA, pH-8.0). For DNA slot-blot analysis 2 ug of DNA was spotted for each of the inoculated, mock inoculated and uninoculated sample. As a positive control 200 ng of total genomic DNA from RTBV infected plants and 10ng of pRTBV-MVIGS DNA were also spotted onto the membrane. The probe for hybridization was derived from a 900 bp MP fragment of RTBV corresponding to nucleotide 999 - 1898 on RTBV, WB genome. Megaprime DNA labeling System (Amersham) was used for hybridization of the blots.<br>
Example 4: RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis<br>
Total RNA was isolated from plants inoculated with pRTBV-MVIGS-pds or controls with pRTBV-MVIGS at 28 dpi, using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and treated with RNase-free DNasel (Fermentas, USA) prior to cDNA synthesis following the manufacturer's recommendations. The DNasel treated RNA was cleaned using RNeasy Kit (Quiagen). The first strand cDNA was generated by using high capacity cDNA archive kit (Applied Biosystems, USA).<br>
Example 5: Real time (RT-) PCR analysis<br>
For RT-PCR analysis, primers that anneal outside the region of the pds cDNA cloned into pRTBV-MVIGS were used to ensure that only the endogenous pds  mRNA is reverse-transcribed.<br>
Rice ubiquitin 5 (UBQ5) cDNA was used as an internal constitutively expressed control. Real-time RT-PCR analysis was carried out with a Real time PCR detection system (Applied Biosystems, USA). Primers were designed using Primer Express software. For SYBR Real-time RT-PCR experiments, primers RTpds-FP and RTpds-RP as shown in SEQ ID. NO. 5 and SEQ ID NO. 6 respectively were used for detection of pds transcripts while primers RTubq5-FP and RTubq5-RP as shown in SEQ ID. NO. 7 and 8 respectively were used for UBQ5 as the internal control.<br>
Example 6: Plant Material and growth conditions<br>
TN1 variety of indica rice was used in this study. Plants were grown either in tubes in Yoshida's medium at 27°C and a 16 hours light and 8 hours dark cycle using artificial lighting with 70% humidity at 30°C, the other parameters remaining the same.<br>
