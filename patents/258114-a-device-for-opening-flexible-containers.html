A DEVICE FOR OPENING FLEXIBLE CONTAINERS.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD AND BACKGROUND ART.<br>
The present invention relates to a device for opening flexible containers, of the type<br>
described in the preamble to claim 1.<br>
It is well known that drinks for human consumption, in particular fruit juices and<br>
dietary complements, are ever more frequently sold and preserved inside flexible<br>
containers, commonly called "pouches".<br>
Specifically,   such  containers   comprise   a  flexible  pouch,   generally  made   of<br>
polyethylene, and a spout, able to allow the outflow of the product preserved within<br>
the container.<br>
The outflow of the product is made particularly convenient by the possibility of<br>
exerting an adequate pressure on the drink, squeezing the pouch.<br>
Flexible containers, or pouches, are obtained from a pair of polyethylene sheets<br>
peripherally sealed to each other and having an inlet adapted to allow the filling of the<br>
container with the desired drink.<br>
In correspondence with the aforesaid inlet is inserted and secured, by sealing, a portion<br>
of the spout. In particular, said sealing operation involves the edges of said inlet and is<br>
performed by heating means which cause a partial melting of the edges themselves,<br>
causing them to adhere to the portion of the spout inserted into the pouch.<br>
The insertion of the spout into said inlet takes place before the container is filled.<br>
A particularly acute problem in the pouch filling sector concerns the opening of the<br>
pouches, to allow the insertion of the spout.<br>
The opening of the flexible containers is particularly difficult because the polyethylene<br>
sheets tend to adhere to each other, by effect of their reduced thickness and of<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2005/100164	PCT/IT2004/000210<br>
electrostatic attraction.<br>
This problem has been confronted and partially solved by the apparatus disclosed in<br>
the document US 4,182,094, in which a plurality of suction cups are used to open a<br>
flexible container.<br>
Specifically, three suction cups are located on a movable head, whilst a pair of suction<br>
cops is positioned and buried within a support plane.<br>
The flexible container is interposed between the suction cups installed on the movable<br>
head and the suction cups buried within the support plane.<br>
The suction cups present on the movable head are set side by side and mutually<br>
aligned, so that two lateral suction cups and a central suction cups can be identified. In<br>
particular, the central suction cup is of the bellows type and its grip plane can thus move rearwards relative to the grip plane defined by the remaining pair of suction cups, allowing a flexion of the container which favours the entry of air into the container, thereby facilitating its opening.<br>
The apparatus summarily described above has the important drawback that it does not operate continuously, but it is an apparatus in which the containers to be treated are fed at successive time intervals. Moreover, the arrangement of the suction cups shown in said apparatus is absolutely not adaptable to an apparatus with continuous feeding of the containers, especially to an apparatus in which the containers to be treated are positioned on a rotary carrousel.<br>
Secondly, the flexion of the pouches during the opening phase is strongly conditioned by the efficiency of the bellows suction cup. If said suction cup does not effectively adhere to the pouch, the latter is not able to flex to such an extent as to allow the entry of a sufficient quantity of air to allow its opening. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION.<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2005/100164	PCT/IT2004/000210<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a device for opening flexible pouches<br>
which can be installed on a rotary carrousel with continuous feeding of flexible<br>
pouches.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose a device for opening flexible<br>
containers, which is able to assure the opening of the pouches themselves.<br>
A. further object of the present invention is to propose a device for opening flexible<br>
containers, which is simple to build and reliable.<br>
Said objects are fully achieved by the decide for opening flexible containers of the<br>
present invention, which are characterised by the content of the appended claims.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION.<br>
These and other features shall become more readily apparent from the following<br>
description of a preferred embodiment illustrated, purely by way of non limiting<br>
example, in the accompanying drawing tables, in which:<br>
-	Figure 1 shows a partially sectioned plan view of a device for opening flexible<br>
containers in accordance with the invention, in a first operative configuration;<br>
-	Figure 2 shows a partially sectioned plan view of the device shown in Figure 1, in a<br>
second operative configuration;<br>
-	Figure 3 shows a partially sectioned plan view of the device shown in Figure 1, in a<br>
resting configuration;<br>
-	Figure 4 shows a diagram of the operation of the device shown in Figures 1, 2 and 3;<br>
-	Figure 5 shows a front view of a flexible container.<br>
With reference to the figures, the device for opening flexible containers in accordance with the invention is globally designated by the reference number 1. Tlie device 1 is installed on a rotary carrousel (not shown) by means of a support structure 2.<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2005/100164	PCT/IT2004/000210<br>
The device 1 comprises a pair of suction cups 3, 4 fastened to the support structure 2<br>
and active on a first external lateral face of a flexible container, preferably in<br>
correspondence with an inlet thereof. In the illustrated example, said pair of suction<br>
cups 3, 4 defines first grip means of the device 1.<br>
With particular reference to Figure 5, the flexible container is globally designated by<br>
the number 70 and comprises external lateral faxes 71 (only one of which is visible)<br>
and a spout 72.<br>
The device 1 comprises a third suction cup 5 active on a second external lateral face of<br>
a flexible container, preferably in correspondence with the inlet thereof. In particular,<br>
said second lateral face is substantially opposite to said first lateral face of the<br>
container.<br>
In the illustrated example, the third suction cup 5 defines second grip means of the<br>
device 1 and, in operative configuration (Figures 1 and 2), it substantially faces the<br>
pair of suction cups 3, 4.<br>
With particular reference to Figures 1 and 2, when the device 1 is in operative<br>
configuration, the container is interposed between the pair of suction cups 3, 4 and the<br>
third suction cup 5.<br>
The suction cups 3, 4 co-operate with the third suction cup 5, to move the lateral faces<br>
of the container away from each other, allowing their opening.<br>
In absolutely new and original fashion, the second grip means, defined by the third<br>
suction cups 5, are movable between an operative configuration in which the container<br>
is interposed between said first and said second grip means and a resting configuration<br>
in which the container is not interposed between said first and said second grip means.<br>
Specifically, the second grip means are pivotally connected to the support structure 2,<br>
in order to be able to rotate between said operative configuration and said resting<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2005/100164	PCT/IT2004/000210<br>
configuration.<br>
In the illustrated example, the device 1 comprises a guide 6 hinged to the support<br>
structure 2 and a cursor 7, slidably movable within the guide itself. In particular, the<br>
cursor 7 divides the guide 6 into a first and a second chamber 27, 37, each of which<br>
has a volume that is variable according to the position assumed by the cursor 7 within<br>
the guide itself.<br>
To the cursor 7 is integrally connected a rod-like element 8, at one end 8a whereof is<br>
fastened the third suction cup 5.<br>
In the chamber 27 of the guide 6 is housed a spring 30, operatively active on the cursor<br>
7 to maintain it in an initial resting position.<br>
The device 1 also comprises means to rotate the guide 6 about a hinge axis 100.<br>
With reference to the figures, the means for rotating the guide 6 comprise a rod 9<br>
having a first end 9a integrally connected to the guide 6 and a second end 9b, whereon<br>
is mounted a roller 10 which slides on a fixed cam, not illustrated herein. Said means<br>
further comprise a spring 11 having a first end lla connected to the guide 6 and a<br>
second end 1 lb connected to said support structure.<br>
The device 1 comprises means for creating a pre-set degree of vacuum in said<br>
chambers 27, 37 defined within the guide 6, to actuate a sliding motion of the cursor 7<br>
within the guide itself. In the preferred embodiment, said means for creating vacuum<br>
comprise at least a pump 40.<br>
The operation of the invention is as follows.<br>
A rotary carrousel whereon is installed a pre-set number of opening devices in<br>
accordance with the invention bears each of said devices in correspondence with a<br>
station for feeding the flexible containers.<br>
The device 1 is readied to receive the container by moving the third suction cup 5,<br>
5<br><br>
WO 2005/100164	PCT/IT2004/000210<br>
from the operative configuration shown in Figures 1 and 2 to the resting configuration<br>
shown in Figure 3.<br>
The movement of the third suction cup 5 takes place by the rotation of the guide 6<br>
about the hinge axis 100, by means of the rod 9 actuated by the roller 10.<br>
The latter, during the rotation of the carrousel, comes in contact with a cam (not<br>
shown), appropriately shaped and fixed, to synchronise the movement of the third<br>
suction cup 5 with the rotation of the carrousel.<br>
The flexible container is received and held by aspiration by a fourth gripping suction<br>
cup 12, whilst the third suction cup 5 is repositioned in front of the pair of suction cups<br>
3, 4, by effect of the advancement of the carrousel and of the interaction between the<br>
roller 10 and the fixed cam.<br>
In the  illustrated  example,  the  gripping plane  of the  suction  cups   3,  4  is<br>
advantageously inclined relative to the gripping plane of the suction cup 12.<br>
Subsequently, the means for creating a vacuum start aspirating air within an open<br>
pneumatic circuit (Figure 4), which branches off in such a way as to reach the using<br>
devices, i.e. the pair of suction cups 3, 4, the third suction cup 5, the fourth gripping<br>
suction cup 12 and the chambers 27, 37 present inside the guide 6.<br>
In particular, aspirating air from the chamber 27 of the guide 6, the force of the spring<br>
30 is overcome and the cursor 7 can thus move within the guide, dragging the rod-like<br>
element 8 with it, thus approaching the third suction cup 5 to the second external<br>
lateral wall of the container. Since the aspiration also involves the third suction cup 5,<br>
the latter adheres to said second external lateral face of the container.<br>
The third suction  cup 5, after adhering to the second external lateral face of the<br>
container, thrusts the container against the suction cups 3,4.<br>
The container is thereby forced to flex and to assume a curvature proportioned to the<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2005/100164	PCT/IT2004/000210<br>
inclination of the grip plane of the suction cups 3, 4, which adhere to the first external<br>
lateral face by effect of the aspiration performed within said pneumatic circuit.<br>
Continuing the aspiration, a pre-set degree of vacuum is created within the second<br>
chamber 37 of the guide 6 as well. In this way, the air pressure in the two chambers is<br>
equalised and the spring 30 is allowed to return the third suction cup 5 to the initial<br>
position, thereby opening the container.<br>
The pneumatic circuit is dimensioned in such a way that there are preferential<br>
aspiration paths.<br>
In particular, this result is obtained by means of appropriate calibrated holes obtained<br>
in correspondence with each user device.<br>
With particular reference to Figure 4, the effects of the aspiration of the pump 40 will<br>
manifest themselves, in cascade fashion, in the first chamber 27 of the guide 6, on the<br>
third suction cup 5 and in the second chamber 37 of the guide 6.<br>
In this way, if the third suction cup 5 is detached from the outer face of the container<br>
during the separation from the suction cups 3, 4, air would be aspirated through the<br>
suction cup 5 itself and not by the second chamber 37. Since aspiration in the first<br>
chamber 27 of the guide 6 is not interrupted, this allows to re-approach the third<br>
suction cup 5 to the suction cups 3, 4 and automatically to retry opening the container.<br>
The invention achieves important advantages.<br>
First of all, an opening device according to the invention can be installed on a rotary<br>
carrousel with continuous feeding of the pouches. The possibility of moving the third<br>
suction cup 5 away from the pair of suction cups 3, 4 enables the device 1 to receive<br>
the pouches directly from a feeding station, to open them and transfer them to a<br>
subsequent treatment or collection station.<br>
Secondly, an opening device according to the invention is able to guarantee the<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2005/100164	PCT/IT2004/000210<br>
opening of the containers, since the conformation of the pneumatic circuit allows<br>
automatically to re-attempt the opening operation, if the third suction cup 5 becomes<br>
detached from the second outer lateral face of the container.<br>
Another advantage is given by the inclination of the suction cups 3, 4, which force the<br>
container to flex, assuming a curvature that is proportioned to the inclination of the<br>
grip plane of the suction cups. This considerably facilitates the opening of the<br>
container, since it favours the entry of air into the container, making it easier to<br>
separate the sheets which constitute it.<br>
Advantageously, such a device for opening flexible containers is extremely reliable.<br>
