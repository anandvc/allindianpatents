				<td>The present invention relates to a fuel injector for<br>
injecting fuel into a combustion chamber of a spark<br>
ignition engine.<br>
The present invention relates to a fuel injector spraying fuel into the combustion chamber of an engine. More specifically, it relates to an injector comprising a head which has a free outer face and which is provided with at least one main orifice designed to spray a fuel jet in a "main" direction and at least one secondary orifice designed to spray a fuel jet in a "secondary" direction, said main and secondary orifices opening into the outer face and communicating directly with a coinmon injection chamber which is selectively placed in communication with a supply chamber.<br>
In the case of controlled-ignition engines with direct injection of the fuel into the combustion chamber, it is necessary to rapidly obtain well controlled spraying of the fuel jet. Specifically, the spraying must exhibit a certain directionality and a penetration rate sufficient to obtain a richness around the spark plug at the moment of ignition that enables the mixture to be ignited. However, the depth of the sprayed jet, which increases with the. injection pressure, must not be excessive so as, in particular, not to spray fuel against the walls of the combustion chamber.<br>
To this end, use has been made of swirl injectors in which the fuel is guided with a swirling motion in the injector before being sprayed. These injectors make it possible to obtain good atomization but, in addition to their high cost, they have the disadvantage of creating a high internal pressure drop in the supply pressure and consequently make it essential to apply a high force in order to actuate the control needle of these injectors. In practice, it is difficult to use these injectors with a fuel supply pressure above 150 bar. Moreover, these injectors create a poorly directional<br><br>
jet with a relatively low rate of penetration into the chamber, which makes it more difficult in some cases to obtain a stratified mixture, that is to say a gas mixture whose richness in fuel is greater in certain defined parts of the combustion chamber.<br>
In the case of these engines, it is also known practice to use multi-hole injectors comprising a plurality of orifices which spray fuel jets in divergent directions. These injectors make it possible to obtain a higher penetration rate and very good directionality of all the fuel jets. Moreover, they create fewer internal pressure drops and are less difficult to manufacture than injectors provided with a swirl atomizer. On the other hand, the fuel is sprayed with less efficiency since the contact area with the gases is smaller and the fuel jet is less turbulent than with the swirl injectors. Consequently, the degree of mixing of the fuel with the combustion chamber gases is less able to be controlled in certain situations, which has harmful consequences in terms of the engine efficiency and the emission of pollutants.<br>
The object of the present invention is to overcome these disadvantages by providing an injector which allows high-pressure direct injection into the combustion chamber with high-efficiency spraying and a certain directionality, without however consequently increasing the depth of penetration of the atomized fuel jet and the cost of the injector.<br>
To this end, the subject of the invention is a fuel injector of the aforementioned type, characterized in that said secondary direction forms an angle a between 10° and 80°, preferably between 15° and 45°, more preferably still equal to approximately 25°, with said main direction so that the secondary jet intercepts the main jet in a "burst" zone which starts at a distance d,<br>
measured in the main direction from the outer face of the head, of between 1 and 15 mm, preferably between 1 and 5 mm, and in that the flow rate of the secondary jet is between 80% and 100% of the flow rate of the main jet.<br>
By virtue of this arrangement, starting from the burst zone which begins a small distance away from the injector, the main jet is driven with a considerable radial speed component with respect to the main direction. Better atomization of the main jet and of the secondary jet is thus obtained starting from this burst zone, without however completely losing the directional power and the penetration rate of the main jet. Moreover, this injector, the orifices of which may be formed by simple cylindrical holes passing through a metal component, such as a metal sheet, does not result in a high excess manufacturing cost.<br>
In preferred embodiments  of the  invention,  use  is<br>
additionally  made  of  one  and/or  other  of  the<br>
arrangements below:<br>
the outer face of the head comprises at least one<br>
portion having an outwardly oriented concavity into<br>
which opens a main orifice and at least one secondary<br>
orifice;<br>
the main orifice and the secondary orifice opening out perpendicularly are cut by electrical discharge machining.<br>
Statement of Invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a fuel injector for injecting fuel into a combustion chamber (5) of a spark ignition engine, comprising a head (13) which has a free outer face (20) and which is provided with at least one main orifice (21; 21a; 21b) designed to spray a fuel jet in a direction (P; Pa, Pb) , called main direction, and at least one secondary orifice (25; 25a, 25b) designed to spray a fuel jet in a direction (S; Sa, Sb), called secondary direction, said main and secondary orifices opening into the outer face and communicating directly with a common injection chamber (24) internal with said injector, which is selectively placed in communication with a supply chamber (27), characterized in that said secondary direction forms an angle a between 10° and 80° with said main direction so that the secondary jet (26) intercepts the main jet (22) in a zone (30), called burst zone, which starts at a distance d, measured in the main direction (P; Pa, Pb) from the outer face (20) of the head, of between 1 and 15 mm, and in that the flow rate of the secondary jet is between 80% and 100% of the flow rate of the main jet.<br>
meeting at a vertex 6a which intersects the longitudinal axis X-X of the cylinder 2.<br>
When the engine in question is a controlled-ignition engine, the cylinder head 7 includes a spark plug 10 provided with electrodes 11 arranged in the region of the vertex 6a of the cylinder head. Although particularly intended for this type of engine, it is conceivable for the present invention to be applied to a diesel-type compression-ignition engine.<br>
The cavity 6 in the cylinder head 7 comprises an intake opening 14 at the downstream end of an intake port 15 and an exhaust opening 17 at the upstream end of an exhaust port 19. The intake 14 and exhaust 17 openings are respectively closed by an intake valve 16 and an exhaust valve 18 which are opened and closed by any known means, such as a camshaft, for example. Of course, the shape of the combustion chamber 5 and the number of valves (16, 18) may be different without departing from the scope of the present invention.<br>
The cylinder head 7 also comprises an injector 12 provided with an injection head 13, which extends along an axis Y-Y. The head 13 of the injector has an outer face 20 arranged in the combustion chamber 5.<br>
The injector 12 is connected to a fuel supply hose (not shown). The supply hose contains fuel under high pressure, that is to say a pressure which at least instantaneously reaches a value above 100 bar and which corresponds substantially to the pressure at which the fuel is injected into the combustion chamber. In the case of a hose supplying a number of injectors under high pressure, the latter is generally referred to as a "common rail". It will be noted, however, that the head of the injector produced according to the invention may be used in an injector/pump-type injection system in<br>
which the injector is combined with a high-pressure pump.<br>
As appears more clearly in figure 2, the outer face 20 of the head 13 of the injector is provided with a main orifice 21 designed to spray a fuel jet, represented schematically by the contour 22, coming from an injection chamber 24. The jet 22 from the main orifice 21 is oriented in a direction P, called the main direction, determined by the shape of the orifice 21 and corresponding to the axis of symmetry of the base of the jet 22.<br>
The outer face 20 is also provided with a secondary orifice 25 designed to spray a fuel jet 26 in a direction S, called the secondary direction. The outer face 20, and more precisely the portion thereof into which the orifices open, is free of any obstacle which could mask one and/or other of the orifices. The secondary orifice 25 also communicates directly with the injection chamber 24, which is thus common to the main and secondary orifices, so that the spraying through the two types of orifice is simultaneous.<br>
In order to control the injection of fuel, the injection chamber 24 is selectively placed in communication with a supply chamber 27 containing fuel under pressure. Communication between the injection chamber 24 and the supply chamber 27 is obtained by lifting a needle 28 from a seat 29 formed in the head 13 of the injector. The needle 28 can be lifted by mechanical, electromagnetic or piezoelectric means synchronized with the rotation of the crankshaft.<br>
It will be noted that the end 28a of the needle has a geometry which complements the inner face of the head 13 so as to minimize the volume of the injection<br>
chamber 24 in order to prevent fuel flowing into the combustion chamber 5 at an unwanted moment.<br>
The secondary direction S of the secondary jet 26 is oriented towards the main direction P of the main jet 22 so that the secondary jet 26 intercepts the main jet 22 in a zone called the burst zone represented schematically by the contour 30, and the flow rate of the secondary jet 26 is at most equal to the flow rate of the main jet 22.<br>
By virtue of this arrangement, a total or partial collision between the secondary jet 26 and the main jet 22 is obtained, which makes it possible, starting from the burst zone 30, to create a speed component in the main jet 22 which is radial with respect to the main direction P of this jet. This allows better atomization of the fuel injected into the combustion chamber 5 and consequently makes it possible to increase the degree of mixing of the fuel with the gases contained in the combustion chamber.<br>
It will be noted that, in order to obtain a high degree of bursting of the main jet 22, tests show that the flow rate of the secondary jet must be at least equal to 80% of the flow rate of the main jet in order that the quantity of movement of the secondary jet reduces the penetration of the main jet by 30% to 40%.<br>
In the embodiment represented in figure 2, the main direction P and the secondary direction S between them form an angle of about 25°. However, it is possible to vary this angle as a function of the ratio between the flow rates of the main jet and of the secondary jet and as a function of the degree of bursting of the main jet that one wishes to obtain. The angle a may be between 10° and 80°, but it is preferable for the angle a to remain between 15° and 45°.<br>
The burst zone 30 starts at a distance d measured in the main direction P from the outer face 20 of the injector head 13. This distance d is between 1 and 15 mm to obtain a good compromise between the directionality and bursting of the main jet 22, but is preferably less than 5 mm to obtain early bursting and a relatively limited depth of penetration.<br>
Since the flow rate of the jet 22 sprayed through the main orifice 21 is greater than or equal to the flow rate of the secondary jet 26, the directionality and the penetration rate necessary for the fuel injected into the combustion chamber are obtained, particularly by adjusting the distance between the orifices and the angle a. Furthermore, the atomized fuel jet forms a solid cone and not a hollow cone such as that obtained with a swirl injector.<br>
It is not absolutely necessary for the secondary direction S to intersect the main direction P exactly. Effectively, given the diameters and the flow rates of the main fuel jet and the secondary jet, it is possible to obtain sufficient interception of the fuel jets with a secondary direction S slightly offset with respect to the main direction P, which limits the depth of penetration.<br>
As can be seen in figure 2, the main orifice 21 and the secondary orifice 25 are cylindrical holes opening out perpendicularly to the outer face 20 of the head. These cylindrical holes opening out perpendicularly to the outer face 20 are advantageously produced by electrical discharge machining. However, it is possible to produce them by other known techniques, such as punching.<br>
However, the orifices (21, 25) could have a different shape, particularly in the case of an injector intended<br>
for a diesel engine. Specifically, for this type of engine, the fuel injection pressure is significantly higher, above 1,000 bar, and the wall of the injector head 13 is thicker, which makes it possible for the orifices to be produced with a frustoconical shape.<br>
It will be noted that the orifices (21, 25) open directly into the injection chamber 24, thereby limiting the pressure drops in the injector head, unlike swirl injectors which require a device upstream of the orifice to impart a circular motion to the fuel.<br>
The outer face 20 of the head 13 comprises a portion 32 having an outwardly oriented concavity into which the main orifice 21 and the secondary orifice 25 open perpendicularly such that the secondary direction S is oriented towards the main direction P.<br>
The concave portion 32 has a continuous curvature which may be obtained by stamping an initially flat portion of sheet metal.<br>
As can be seen in figure 3, which represents a second embodiment of a fuel injector according to the invention, it is possible to multiply the number of main orifices and the number of secondary orifices.<br>
The head 13 of the injector 12 comprises, in this second embodiment, two main orifices (21a, 21b) which respectively spray fuel jets (not shown) in a main direction Pa and a main direction Pb.<br>
In order to obtain spraying across a wider angle in the combustion chamber, the main directions Pa and Pb are divergent and between them form an angle P of about 15°. Depending on the fuel-spraying characteristics which are imposed by the geometry of the combustion chamber and the flow of the gases, it may be<br>
advantageous to vary the angle P between the main directions Pa and Pb from 5 to 45°.<br>
The outer face 20 of this second embodiment comprises two main orifices (21a, 21b) which are respectively assigned two secondary orifices (25a; 25b) .<br>
The secondary orifices 25a are situated diametrically opposite one another with respect to the main orifice 21a, which makes it possible to retain a certain degree of symmetry of the main fuel jet starting from the burst zone. It will be noted that it is possible to retain this symmetry by arranging around the main orifice 21a more than two secondary orifices distributed in a uniform angular manner.<br>
The secondary directions Sa of the jets sprayed through the secondary orifices 25a are arranged so that the secondary jets intercept the main jet of the orifice 21a at the same longitudinal position of the main direction Pa.<br>
The two main orifices (21a, 21b) and the four secondary orifices (25a, 25b) are contained in the same plane, but it is conceivable for the two main orifices 21a, 21b to be arranged in a first longitudinal plane of the injector head 13 and for the secondary orifices (25a, 25b) to be arranged in two planes which are perpendicular to the first longitudinal plane.<br>
The outer face 20 comprises a first concave portion 32a into which the orifices 21a and 25a open and a second concave portion 32b into which the orifices 21b and 25b open. Each concave portion (32a; 32b) comprises three facets, a central facet into which the main orifice opens perpendicularly and two lateral facets into which the secondary orifices open perpendicularly.<br>
The wall of the injector comprising the facets is relatively thin when the pressure in the supply chamber 27 does not exceed 500 bar. For the purpose of limiting the manufacturing cost, this portion of the outer face comprising the concavities (32a; 32b) is thus formed by stamping, that is to say by deforming an initially flat portion rather than machining or molding it.<br>
As represented in figure I, the injector produced according to the invention is arranged in a controlled-ignition engine so that petrol can be sprayed directly into the combustion chamber. The injector according to the invention makes it possible to adjust very precisely the characteristics of the sprayed jet, and particularly the direction, the rate and depth of penetration, and also the atomization of the fuel, this being particularly advantageous for this type of engine. Specifically, a controlled-ignition engine requires very precise spraying, in particular in order to have a sufficient richness in the region of the ignition means at the moment when ignition is initiated.<br>
The main direction P of the main orifice, or of the main orifices, is arranged with consideration to the geometry of the combustion chamber, such as, for example, the presence of a hollow 33 and of a rim 34 formed on the end face 9 of the piston, and to the flow of the gases within the combustion chamber so as to obtain a richness between 0.7 and 1.2 in the vicinity of the electrodes 11 of the spark plug 10 at the moment when a spark is created between the electrodes.<br>
It will be noted that, in order to obtain a correctly arranged spraying direction for the main orifice, it is possible for the main direction P to form a greater or lesser angle with the longitudinal axis Y-Y of the injector 12 or, in the case of a number of main<br>
orifices, for the main directions (Pa, Pb) not to be arranged symmetrically with respect to the longitudinal axis (Y-Y) of the injector.<br>
The head 13 of the injector produced according to the invention creates little internal pressure drop and conseguently the injector 12 may be supplied by a common rail containing fuel under high pressure. In the case of an injector for a controlled-ignition engine, the pressure at which petrol is supplied to the injector 12 preferably reaches a peak value of between 150 bar and 500 bar.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
