Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a radiation sensitive refraciive index changing composition, a refractive index changing method, a method of forming a refractive index pattern, a refractive index pattern and an optical material. More specifically, it relates to a novel radiation sensitive refractive index changing composition which is used in photoelectronic and display fields, a method of forming a refractive index pattern, a refractive index pattern and an optical material.<br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
In the current society called "multi-media society", refractive index distribution type optically molded products each consisting of different refractive index regions are in great demand. The products include not only optical fibers for transmiting information but also optical diffraction gratings having a periodical change in refraciive index, optical memories in which information is written at sites having different refractive indices, optically coupled elements such as optical IC's having a fine refractive index pattern, optical control elements, optical modulation elements and optical transmission elements.<br>
US 5763514 discloses a process for producing optical resin materials with distributed refractive index. US 3816160 discloses a method of makinu a plastic optical element and FR 863142 discloses various non-polymerizable substances.<br>
The refractive index distribution type optically molded products are divided into two types: one having a continuous refractive index distribution, such as (il type optical fibers in the molded products (to be referred to as "GRIN optically molded products" hereinafter) and the other having a discontinuous refractive index distribution, such as optical diffraction gratings and SI type optical waveguides.<br>
The GRIN optically molded products are attracting much attention as the next-generation optically molded products.<br><br>
For example, a GI type optical fiber whose refractive index is reduced from the center axis of the core of the optical fiber to the periphery in a parabolic form can transmit a great volume of information. A GRIN lens whose refractive index continuously changes therein is used as a reading lens for use in copiers, spherical lens for connecting fibers, or micro-lens, making use of its characteristic features that it has refractive power even on a flat surface and that it is free from spherical aberration,<br>
A large number of methods of producing the above GRIN optically molded products have been proposed up till now. For example, JP-A 9-133813, JP-A 8-336911, JP-A 8-337609, JP-A 3-192310, JP-A 5-60931 (the term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined published Japanese patent application" ), WO93/19505 and WO94/04949 disclose a method of obtaining a GI type optical fiber by dispersing a low-molecular weight compound or a monomer into a polymer and continuously distributing its concentration.  JP-A 62-25705 discloses that a rod-like GI type optically molded product or optical fiber is obtained by photo-copolymerizing two or more vinyl monomers having different refractive indices and reactivity ratios. Further, JP-A 7-56026 discloses a method of obtaining a refractive index distribution by forming a polymer A having a photo-reactive functional group, dispersing a compound B having a lower refractive index than the polymer A into the polymer A to form the concentration distribution of the compound B and photo-reacting the polymer A with the compound B.<br>
Some methods of producing GRIN optically molded products of an inorganic material have also been proposed. One of them is, for example, a method of producing a GI type rod by adding high refractive index thallium to rod-like glass essentially composed of silicon or lead, immersing the glass in a molten solution containing low refractive index<br><br>
potassium, and forming a potassium concentration distribution through ion exchange.<br>
A GRIN lens can be obtained likewise by applying the above method to a short rod, that is, a lens-like optically molded product. Alternatively, the GI type rod produced by the above method may be sliced.<br>
As one of the above methods of producing optically molded products having a fine refractive index pattern, such as an optical diffraction grating and optical IC, there is known a technology for obtaining a change in refractive index by causing a photochemical reaction in a molded product through exposure to light. For instance, in the case of an inorganic material, glass doped with germanium is exposed to light to change its refractive index so as to produce an optical diffraction grating. In the case of an organic material, the above technology is known as a photochromic reaction or photobleaching. JP-A 7-92313 discloses a technology for obtaining an optical diffraction grating by causing a change in the refractive index of a material containing a low-molecular weight compound having photochemical reactivity dispersed in a polymer through exposure to a laser beam. Further, JP-A 9-178901 has recently proposed the application of this technology to the production of a GRIN optically molded product.  This method provides a continuous refractive index distribution in a depth direction with respect to irradiation, making use of the fact that light projected onto a molded product is absorbed and weakened in intensity.<br>
However, in the refractive index distributions obtained with the above conventional materials, the maximum refractive index difference is only about 0.001 to 0.02 and it is difficult to provide a wider refractive index distribution for the purpose of preventing an optical loss and suppressing the malfunction of a circuit.<br><br>
When the above conventional materials are used under the condition that light having a wavelength close to the wavelength used for changing the refractive index passes therethrough after a refractive index distribution is formed, it is impossible to prevent a phenomenon that a gradual change in refractive index occurs, thereby deteriorating the materials. Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention has been made in view of the above situation of the prior art.<br>
That is, it is an object of the present invention to provide a radiation sensitive refractive index changing composition whose refractive index of a material is changed by a simple method, whose changed refractive index difference is sufficiently large, and which can provide a stable refractive index pattern and a stable optical material regardless of their use conditions.<br>

In the present invention, a refractive index pattern can be formed from the above refractive index changing composition as follows, for example.<br>
First, the refractive index changing composition is dissolved or dispersed in a solvent to prepare a composition having a solid content of 5 to 70 wt%. The composition may be filtered with a filter having a pore diameter of about 0,1 to 10 p before use, as required.<br>
Thereafter, this composition is applied to the surface of a substrate such as a silicon wafer and prebaked to remove the solvent so as to form the coating film of the refractive index changing composition.

The refractive index changing composition used in the present invention is formed into various shapes in consideration of application purpose before exposure to radiation. For example, it is formed like a rod, fiber, long board, sphere, film or lens and the present invention is not limited to these. A commonly used molding technique may be used, as exemplified by injection molding, compression molding, blow molding, extrusion, in-case frame polymerization, shaving, drawing, heating/cooling, CVD deposition, sintering and scanning. Spin coating, slitting, bar coating, solvent casting, LB, spraying, roll coating, relief-printing or screen printing may also be used according to the application purpose of an optically molded product.<br>
In this molding process, heating (to be referred to as "prebaking" hereinafter) is preferably carried out. The heating condition which changes according to the composition of the material of the present invention and the type of each additive is preferably 30 to 200° C, more preferably 40 to 150° C. A hot plate or oven, or infrared radiation may be used for heating.<br>
The radiation used for exposure is an i-line having a wavelength of 365 nm, h-line having a wavelength of 404 nm, g-line having a wavelength of 436 nm, ultraviolet radiation from a wide-range wavelength light source such as a xenon lamp, far ultraviolet radiation such as KrF excimer laser<br><br>
beam having a wavelength of 2 48 nm or ArF exclmer laser beam having a wavelength of 193 nm, X-radiation such as synchrotron radiation, charged corpuscular beam such as electron beam, visible radiation or a mixture thereof. Out of these, ultraviolet radiation and visible radiation are preferred. The illuminance which depends on the wavelength of the radiation is preferably 0.1 to 100 mW/cm2 because the highest reaction efficiency is obtained. The projection of the radiation through a pattern mask makes possible the patterning of the radiation sensitive refractive index changing material. As for patterning accuracy which is affected by a light source used, an optical part having a refractive index variation distribution with a resolution of about 0.2 p can be produced.<br>
In the present invention, heating (post-exposure baking (PEB)) is preferably carried out after exposure. A similar device to the above prebaking device may be used for PEB and PEB conditions may be arbitrary. The heating temperature is preferably 30 to 150° C, more preferably 30 to 130° C. If the component (A) of the unexposed portion is not dissipated completely by heating under normal pressure, heating under reduced pressure may be carried out. A refractive index pattern can be thereby formed effectively. Re-exposure may be further carried out to decompose the residual component (C) existent in the unexposed portion and further improve the stability of the material.<br>
The re-exposure may be carried out, for example, by projecting radiation having the same wavelength as that of the radiation used to change the refractive index onto the entire surface of the pattern in the same amount.<br>
Optionally, the stability of the material may be further improved by heating. A similar device to the prebaking device used at the time of molding the material may be used for heating and the heating conditions may be<br><br>
arbitrary.<br>
According to the present invention, the refractive index pattern forming method of the present invention may also be carried out by exposing a refractive index changing composition comprising the above components (A), (B) and (C) to radiation through a pattern mask and treating it with a developer.<br>
As for the type of the above developer, a developer which dissolves the component (A) and an optionally added catalyst and does not dissolve a polymer formed from the component (A) and the component (B) is preferred. When this developer is selected, the surface of the obtained refractive index pattern is not roughened.<br>

Out of these, water, alcohols, glycol ethers and ethylene glycol alkyl ether acetates are preferably used. The development time is generally 30 to 180 seconds, and puddle development or dipping development may be used. After development, the coating film is rinsed with running water for 30 to 90 seconds and dried with compressed air or compressed nitrogen to remove water on the substrate, thereby forming a refractive index pattern.<br>
Further, re-exposure may be carried out to decompose<br><br>
the residual component (C) existent in the unexposed portion and further improve the stability of the material.<br>
As for what is not described of the refractive index pattern forming method including the above stabilization, it should be understood that the above description of the refractive index pattern forming method is applied directly or with modifications obvious to people having ordinary skill in the art.<br>
The residual polymerizable compound (A) existent in the unexposed portion is removed by the above heating to preferably form pores.<br>
In the refractive index pattern of the present invention formed by any one of the above various methods, the refractive index of the exposed portion (first region) is preferably larger than that of the unexposed portion (second region). This difference can be adjusted to a desired value by controlling the types and contents of the components (A) and (B) in the refractive index changing composition used in the present invention. For example, the largest value of refractive index difference can be set to a value larger than 0.02.<br>

When the unexposed portion has pores, its porosity is preferably 10 to 99.9 %, more preferably 15 to 99.9 %, particularly preferably 20 to 99.9 %.<br>
Since the refractive index pattern of the present invention does not deteriorate without a change in refractive index even when it is used under the condition that light having a wavelength close to the wavelength used to change the refractive index passes therethrough as described above, it is extremely useful as an optical material for use in optoelectronic and display fields.<br>
As the refractive index pattern of the present<br><br>
