(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein,<br>
R1 and R2 independently represent the following groups R1 = R2 = H, OH, -OC„H2n+1 (n = 1 to 8), NH2, and/or CF3 R1 and R2 together represents -O(CH2)mO- where m = 2 to 4.<br>
Background and Prior art References<br>
Substituted ß-benzyl-γ-butyrolactones are known for their biological properties such as anticancer activities, and they are also the key intermediates in the synthesis of butyrolactone   lignans   as   well   as   other   natural   products.   Due   to   various pharmacological and medicinal properties associated with butyrolactones and related lignans, the chemical synthesis of the intermediate butyrolactones has been the major target of several synthetic schemes. One of the more common synthetic strategies utilizes Stobbes condensation of an aromatic aldehyde with alkyl succinates followed by selective reduction (Banerji, J., Biswanath, D.
