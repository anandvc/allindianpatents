				<td>Method for producing peroxodisulfates in aqueous<br>
solution<br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to a process for preparing or<br>
regenerating peroxodisulfuric acid and its salts by<br>
electrolysis of an aqueous solution containing sulfuric<br>
acid and/or metal sulfates. As used herein, the term<br>
"metal sulfates" encompasses both sulfates of metals<br>
such as zinc, nickel or iron and sulfates of alkali<br>
metals and alkaline earth metals and also ammonium<br>
sulfate. Thus, it is possible to use, for example,<br>
alkali metal sulfates or alkaline earth metal sulfates,<br>
preferably alkali metal sulfates or ammonium sulfate,<br>
as metal sulfates. It is also possible to use mixtures<br>
of various metal sulfates, for example magnesium<br>
sulfate, zinc sulfate or else nickel or iron sulfate,<br>
preferably in the regeneration of etching and pickling<br>
solutions.<br>
It is known from the prior art that diamond-coated<br>
electrodes composed of valve metals, preferably<br>
niobium, or ceramic materials, preferably silicon, can<br>
be used for the preparation of peroxodisulfates of the<br>
alkali metals and of ammonium [DE 199 48 184.9, DE 100<br>
19 683]. The diamond layer is made conductive by doping<br>
with a trivalent or pentavalent element, preferably<br>
boron. These have advantages over the smooth platinum<br>
anodes which have hitherto been exclusively used in<br>
peroxodisulfate production in that, as a result of the<br>
high potential which can be achieved on the diamond<br>
surface, it is not necessary to add potential-<br>
increasing additives to the electrolyte in order to<br>
achieve sufficiently high current yields, as is<br>
unavoidable in the case of platinum anodes. The<br>
preferred use of thiocyanates as polarizers results in<br>
anode gases which contain cyanide and make complicated<br>
gas purification measures necessary. When diamond-<br><br>
coated anodes are used, these can be dispensed with.<br>
A further advantage of diamond-coated anodes in<br>
peroxodisulfate production is that, even at a low <br>
sulfate content in the anolyte, significantly higher <br>
current yields can be achieved than when using platinum <br>
anodes.	<br>
However, despite the good stability of, in particular,<br>
diamond-coated silicon electrodes, their use is<br>
associated with a number of disadvantages. Thus, there<br>
is the problem of suitable supply of electric current.<br>
Owing to the relatively low electrical conductivity of<br>
the silicon base body, a contact has to be provided<br>
over the entire area of the reverse side of the<br>
electrode, so that current needs to flow only from the<br>
contacted rear side through the small thickness of the<br>
silicon electrode of about 1-2 mm to the diamond<br>
coating. Although this problem could in principle be<br>
solved by adhesive bonding of the preferably metallized<br>
rear sides of the silicon plates to a metallic<br>
substrate having a good conductivity by means of an<br>
electrically conductive adhesive, this is relatively<br>
complicated.<br>
A further disadvantage of the diamond-coated silicon<br>
electrodes of the prior art is their limited dimensions<br>
of at present not more than 200 x 250 mm. In order to<br>
nevertheless be able to provide large-area anodes for<br>
use in industrial electrolysis cells, EP 1 229 149<br>
proposed adhesively bonding a relatively large number<br>
of such silicon-diamond electrodes by means of an<br>
electrically conductive adhesive to a metal base plate,<br>
e.g. composed of a valve metal, and sealing the edges<br>
by means of a corrosion-resistant resin, e.g. epoxy<br>
resin. However, the difficulties involved, for example<br>
in the provision of the conductive adhesive, e.g. an<br>
adhesive composed of epoxy resin containing silver<br>
particles, and in the complete elimination of the oxide<br><br>
layers on the areas to be joined, are very great. In<br>
addition, such an electrode construction has been found<br>
to be insufficiently corrosion resistant for the<br>
preparation of peroxodisulfate, so that only short<br>
operation lives of usually less than one year can be<br>
achieved in this way.<br>
Another possible way disclosed in the prior art for<br>
constructing electrolysis cells having a sufficiently<br>
large current capacity is to connect a relatively large<br>
number of bipolar silicon-diamond electrodes in series.<br>
FR 2790268 B1 discloses such a bipolar electrolysis<br>
cell in which the bipolar electrodes comprise a ceramic<br>
substrate which is completely enveloped by a diamond<br>
film. However, this cell is not proposed specifically<br>
for the preparation of peroxodisulfates but for uses in<br>
the degradation of pollutants or for disinfection of<br>
water.<br>
DE 200 05 681 describes the use of bipolar electrodes<br>
coated on both sides with diamond layers.<br>
EP 1 254 972 proposes an electrolysis cell construction<br>
which is suitable for various applications and can be<br>
configured as a monopolar or bipolar, undivided or<br>
divided cell. In the bipolar design, silicon disk<br>
electrodes coated on both sides with a diamond layer<br>
are once again exclusively used. In the preparation of<br>
peroxodisulfates, these cells having silicon electrodes<br>
coated on both sides with a diamond layer and the<br>
relatively complicated cell construction can be used<br>
effectively only for small persulfate throughputs. If<br>
an attempt is made to increase the throughput to<br>
industrially relevant ranges by means of a relatively<br>
large number of individual bipolar cells, this<br>
construction results in reduced yields due to the loss<br>
currents in the power supply leads and power outlet<br>
leads which increase greatly with the total voltage.<br><br>
It was therefore an object of the present invention to<br>
provide a process for preparing or regenerating<br>
peroxodisulfuric acid and/or its salts, in which the<br>
above-described disadvantages of previous processes and<br>
electrolysis cells are at least partly avoided. It has<br>
been found that peroxodisulfates can advantageously be<br>
prepared in undivided or divided electrolysis cells in<br>
a simple manner by using bipolar silicon electrodes<br>
which have been coated on one side with doped diamond,<br>
with the uncoated silicon rear sides acting directly as<br>
cathodes.<br>
According to the invention, the coating on the silicon<br>
electrode has a thickness of from about 1 to about<br>
2 0 µm, preferably about 5 µm.<br>
It was highly surprising that only the coating on the<br>
anode side of the bipolar electrode is necessary in<br>
order to achieve satisfactory results with the uncoated<br>
silicon rear side which then functions as cathode. In<br>
the case of an undivided bipolar cell, it was also<br>
surprisingly found that lower persulfate losses occur<br>
as a result of cathodic reduction when using a silicon<br>
cathode according to the invention compared to the<br>
metal cathodes which are usually used in the prior art<br>
in persulfate production.<br>
Furthermore, it has been found that it is not only<br>
possible to achieve high persulfate formation rates<br>
when using the bipolar electrodes according to the<br>
invention but this can be achieved even at very low<br>
cell voltages and thus low specific electric energy<br>
consumptions. This is based firstly on the recognition<br>
that the silicon cathode surfaces are freed of the<br>
poorly conductive oxide layers which are initially<br>
present by means of the cathodic reaction and are also<br>
kept completely free during the course of the<br>
electrolysis. For example, it was found in a long-term<br>
experiment (cf. example 1) that the cell voltage is<br><br>
even reduced further with increasing time of operation,<br>
while in the case of the diamond-coated silicon<br>
electrodes adhesively bonded to a metal substrate<br>
according to the prior art, an opposite tendency is<br>
observed as a result of increasing corrosion.<br>
The process of the invention thus advantageously makes<br>
it possible to prepare peroxodisulfuric acid and/or its<br>
salts at a genuine bipolar electrode with a high<br>
current yield and a low electric energy consumption<br>
even though only the slightly conductive silicon is<br>
used as cathode. In addition, no costs for a cathode<br>
coating are incurred.<br>
A further advantage of the inventive bipolar silicon<br>
electrodes coated on one side with diamond is the lower<br>
catalytic activity of the silicon rear side compared to<br>
a metallized electrode rear side, e.g. composed of<br>
platinum or stainless steel. It has been found that<br>
reduction losses of peroxodisulfate are therefore lower<br>
when electrolysis is carried out in an undivided<br>
electrolysis cell. This leads, in the case of undivided<br>
cells, to the increase in the peroxodisulfate<br>
concentration with electrolysis time being somewhat<br>
steeper and the achievable final concentration being<br>
higher than when a metallized cathode is used under<br>
otherwise identical electrolysis conditions.<br>
Compared to the bipolar electrodes of the prior art<br>
which are coated with doped diamond on both sides, cost<br>
savings are advantageously achieved both for the<br>
electrodes themselves and for the electrolysis cells<br>
equipped therewith and also as a result of the lower<br>
electric energy consumptions which can be achieved.<br>
The process of the invention for preparing<br>
peroxodisulfuric acid and/or its salts can be carried<br>
out both in undivided electrolysis cells and in<br>
electrolysis cells which are divided, for example by<br><br>
means of ion-exchange membranes or porous diaphragms.<br>
The bipolar silicon electrodes according to the<br>
invention which are coated on one side with diamond are<br>
particularly useful for undivided electrolysis cells<br>
having a relatively simple construction, as are<br>
described, for example, in DE G 200 05 681.6 for the<br>
disinfection of water. It is advantageous in terms of<br>
the current input for the monopolar boundary anodes to<br>
comprise a diamond-coated valve metal. The term "valve<br>
metal" refers to a metal which when connected as an<br>
anode becomes coated with an oxide layer which becomes<br>
nonconductive even at high voltages. Connected as<br>
anode, the metal blocks. Connected as cathode, the<br>
oxide layer is dissolved and current flows in a fairly<br>
uninhibited fashion. Thus, valve metals behave like a<br>
rectifier when different polarities are applied.<br>
Examples of suitable valve metals are tantalum,<br>
titanium, niobium and zirconium. For the purposes of<br>
the present invention, preference is given to using<br>
niobium.<br>
The monopolar boundary cathodes preferably comprise a<br>
suitable material having a good conductivity, e.g.<br>
stainless steel, Hastelloy, platinum and impregnated<br>
graphite. For the purposes of the present invention,<br>
preference is given to using high-alloy stainless<br>
steels or Hastelloy. A silicon boundary cathode having<br>
a metallized rear side and with a current supply plate<br>
composed of a material having a good conductivity, e.g.<br>
copper, as contact can also be used due to the good<br>
long-term stability in undivided cells. Particularly<br>
when using boundary electrodes composed of metallic<br>
materials, optimal current input can be achieved in a<br>
simple manner and without large voltage drops because<br>
of the good conductivity.<br>
It is also possible for a plurality of electrode stacks<br>
comprising bipolar electrodes and boundary electrodes<br><br>
with power supply lead to be connected electrically in<br>
parallel in an electrolysis cell. If necessary, the<br>
spacing between the bipolar electrodes can be set or<br>
fixed by means of spacers. Such electrode stacks<br>
connected in parallel make it possible to accommodate<br>
relatively large power capacities in an electrolysis<br>
cell without an unjustifiably high total voltage being<br>
necessary. The voltage can thus also be optimally<br>
matched to the available rectifier voltage. In<br>
addition, the short circuit currents in the common feed<br>
and discharge lines for the electrolyte solutions can<br>
be minimized further as a result, which can<br>
additionally be aided in a known manner by installation<br>
of additional resistance sections in these lines.<br>
Undivided bipolar cells having the structure provided<br>
by the invention can be used particularly<br>
advantageously when the peroxodisulfate concentration<br>
does not have to be very high for the application in<br>
question, for example for the oxidative degradation of<br>
pollutants in process solutions and wastewater. As can<br>
be seen from example 2, sodium peroxodisulfate reaction<br>
solutions having a content of from 50 to 100 g/1 can be<br>
prepared very effectively in batch operation in an<br>
undivided cell provided with the bipolar electrodes<br>
according to the invention at current yields of from 7 5<br>
to 50% and specific electric energy consumptions of<br>
from 1.3 to 1.9 kWh/kg.<br>
Even better current yields or the same yields at higher<br>
final peroxodisulfate concentrations can be achieved by<br>
shielding of the cathode by means of suitable materials<br>
which inhibit mass transfer to the cathode surface, as<br>
can be seen from example 3. Materials suitable for<br>
these purposes are, for example, PVC gauzes. The<br>
process of the invention thus makes it possible to<br>
obtain sodium peroxodisulfate concentrations from 150<br>
to 200 g/1 with justifiable current yields of about 50%<br>
in undivided cells, albeit at relatively high cell<br><br>
voltages.<br>
If higher final concentrations of peroxodisulfates,<br>
e.g. in the range from 200 to 400 g/1 of sodium<br>
peroxodi sulfate, are desired, the use of divided<br>
electrolysis cells provided with the bipolar silicon<br>
electrodes according to the invention is preferred. As<br>
can be seen from example 4, current yields of from<br>
about 75 to 85% can be achieved in this way, albeit<br>
with a more complicated cell construction and higher<br>
cell voltages of from about 5.5 to 6 V. However,<br>
comparatively very good specific electric energy<br>
consumptions of less than 2.0 kWh/kg can still be<br>
achieved in this way.<br>
A further surprising effect of the process of the<br>
invention are the very low corrosion rates at the<br>
silicon cathodes which are found in undivided<br>
electrolysis cells in a long-term experiment using an<br>
acidic persulfate-containing electrolyte. Thus,<br>
surprisingly low corrosion rates of only 2-3 µm were<br>
found in an undivided cell at a steady-state sodium<br>
peroxodisulfate content of about 150 g/1 in a long-term<br>
experiment over about 7 months (cf. example 1). This<br>
was particularly surprising because 10-100 times<br>
greater corrosion was observed even on platinum<br>
cathodes of the prior art under these very highly<br>
corrosive conditions. Even cathodes made of graphite or<br>
high-alloy stainless steels were found to be unsuitable<br>
in such peroxodisulfate-containing sulfuric acid<br>
electrolyte solutions because they were insufficiently<br>
corrosion-resistant.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1:<br>
An undivided bipolar electrolysis cell having a<br>
construction analogous to that in DE G 200 05 681.6<br><br>
contained 9 bipolar silicon electrodes coated on one<br>
side with about 3 µm of boron-doped diamond (average<br>
about 3 000 ppm of boron). A niobium electrode coated on<br>
one side with diamond and provided with a power supply<br>
lead served as boundary anode. The boundary cathode<br>
with power supply lead comprised Hastelloy. The bipolar<br>
electrodes had a dimension of 100 x 33 mm (33 cm2) . The<br>
mean spacing of the about 1 mm thick bipolar electrodes<br>
was set to about 2 mm by means of spacers. The<br>
electrolysis current was regulated at a constant<br>
16.5 A, corresponding to an anodic and cathodic current<br>
density of 0.5 A/cm2. The total current capacity of the<br>
electrolysis cell was thus 10 x 16.5 = 165 A. 2 1 of an<br>
aqueous solution containing 300 g/1 of sodium sulfate<br>
and 200 g/1 of sulfuric acid served as electrolyte. It<br>
was circulated at a rate of about 600 1/h from a<br>
circulation reservoir via a heat exchanger and through<br>
the cell by pumping (batch operation). Electrolysis<br>
operation was maintained for 5 000 hours, with only the<br>
water which had evaporated or been decomposed being<br>
replaced. In steady-state operation, a concentration of<br>
170-190 g/1 of sodium peroxodisulfate was established<br>
at a steady-state temperature of about 35°C. The total<br>
voltage on start-up was 50 V. The mean cell voltage<br>
changed as follows over the course of continuous<br>
operation:<br><br>
After 5000 hours of operation, the electrodes were<br>
removed and the weight loss was determined. The mean<br>
decrease in the silicon electrode thickness was<br>
calculated therefrom as an average of 3 µm. The<br>
thickness of the silicon cathode thus decreases by only<br>
about 10 µm per year.<br>
Example 2:<br><br>
The dependence of the current yield on the final<br>
concentration of sodium peroxodisulfate (NaPS) achieved<br>
was determined by means of the undivided electrolysis<br>
cell from example 1 under the same electrolysis<br>
conditions (current density, temperature, batch<br>
operation, electrolyte composition). The following<br>
results were obtained:<br><br>
At the favorable cell voltage of about 4.2 V<br>
established after a prolonged period of operation, the<br>
specific electric energy consumption was 1.23 kWh/kg<br>
for a final concentration of 50 g/1; for a final<br>
concentration of 100 g/1 of NaPS, it was still<br>
1.89 kWh/kg despite the fact that the current yield had<br>
dropped to 50%.<br>
Example 3:<br>
The same undivided electrolysis cell as in examples 1<br>
and 2 was equipped with a PVC gauze resting on the<br>
cathodes of the bipolar electrode plates and the<br>
boundary cathode; this gauze could be pressed onto the<br>
surface by means of a plastic spacer. Electrolysis was<br>
again carried out under the same electrolysis<br>
conditions as in example 2. The following current<br>
yields, based on the final NaPS concentration achieved,<br>
were obtained.<br><br>
Even in the concentration range from 100 to 200 g/1,<br><br>
relatively favorable current yields were obtained and<br>
these were an average of about 20% higher than without<br>
shielding of the cathode surfaces. However, the cell<br>
voltages were about 0.8 V higher due to the additional<br>
resistance of the gauze shielding. Nevertheless, a very<br>
favorable specific electric energy consumption of about<br>
1.85 kWh/kg was still obtained at, for example, a final<br>
NaPS concentration of 150 g/1.<br>
Example 4:<br>
The nine bipolar electrodes and the two monopolar<br>
boundary electrodes of the undivided electrolysis cell<br>
used in examples 1 to 3 were used in a divided bipolar<br>
cell. Cation-exchange membranes which were fixed on<br>
both sides by means of anode and cathode spacers made<br>
of plastic were used for separating anolyte and<br>
catholyte. The anode and cathode spaces bounded by<br>
sealing frames had a thickness of 2-3 mm each. Anolyte<br>
and catholyte were circulated in separate circuits<br>
through a heat exchanger. 500 g/1 of sulfuric acid<br>
served as catholyte. The anolyte once again consisted<br>
of an aqueous solution containing 200 g/1 of sulfuric<br>
acid and 300 g/1 of sodium sulfate. To avoid an<br>
excessively large decrease in the sodium sulfate<br>
concentration due to both consumption to form<br>
peroxodisulfate and the transport of Na+ ions through<br>
the cation-exchange membrane into the catholyte at the<br>
desired high final NaPS concentrations, a further<br>
100 g/1 of sodium sulfate were dissolved in the anolyte<br>
during the electrolysis (i.e. a total of 400 g/1 of<br>
sodium sulfate). The anodic and cathodic current<br>
densities were each set to 0.5 A/cm2.<br>
Under otherwise comparable electrolysis conditions, the<br>
following current yields were obtained for various<br>
final NaPS concentrations:<br>
at a final NaPS concentration of 2 00 g/1, a current<br><br>
yield of 86%<br>
at a final NaPS concentration of 300 g/1, a current<br>
yield of 82%<br>
at a final NaPS concentration of 400 g/1, a current<br>
yield of 74%<br>
The mean cell voltages were in the range from 5.5 to<br>
6 V. At the final concentration of 400 g/1, a still<br>
very low specific electric energy consumption of about<br>
1.8 kWh/kg could thus be achieved.<br><br>
