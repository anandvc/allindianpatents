				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention is related to a welded  matrix for carrying a catalyst   and especially to such a welding structure designed for welding plain plates on corrugated plates used in the carrier. <br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
There is a technique presently for constructing a catalyst carrier in the form of a honeycomb in the art, the technique discloses that the plain plates and the corrugated plates in the catalyst carrier for covering the catalyst are made in the form of a net with net holes all over the plates, this may render areas on the net holes for storing and connecting solder too few to get sufficient welding strength, the carrier thereby may even be subjected to loosening by vibration to render a converter for the catalyst to reduce its life of use.<br>
Accordingly, the inventor of studied on the above stated problem and   developed   the   present   invention   based   on   his   professional experience of years in studying, developing and manufacturing same kind of products and after hard study and improvement. <br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The   purpose   of   the   present   invention   is  to   provide   a   welding structure for a catalyst carrier in the form of a honeycomb capable of<br>
elongating the life of use of a catalyst converter.<br>
To get the abovementioned object, the present invention adopts the following technical measure:<br>
1.	The plain plates for making the carrier are provided with a lot of aeration areas full of net holes; and a lot of welding areas without a net hole are provided among the aeration areas.<br>
2.	The corrugated plates for making the carrier have a lot of wave peaks forming welding areas; solder is applied on these welding areas.<br>
3.	The solder applied on these welding areas on the corrugated plates can be welded together with the welding areas on the plain plates; the plates then are wound to form the catalyst carrier in the form of a honeycomb.<br>
As stated above, the welding areas on the plain  plates and the<br>
corrugated plates wound can be increased, and the welding strength as<br>
well   as the  life  of   use  of   the  catalyst  carrier  in  the  form   of   a<br>
 	honeycomb can also be increased. <br>
                              Accordingly the present invention provides for a w elded matrix for carrying a <br>
                              catalyst comprising of a housing, a plurality of plates in said housing, said <br>
                              plates being integrally welded together one attacked and wound in <br>
                                the form of a honly coub characterised in that the said puts comprised<br>
                                of attest one corrugated plate and one plain plate at least one of the said plates<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Referring firstly to Fig. 2 which shows a sectional view of the main embodiment of the welding structure for a catalyst carrier in the form of a honeycomb of the present invention, it can be seen that a plurality of plates are welded in a cylindrical housing 1, the cylindrical housing 1 is provided in pursuance of the environment for constructing, and can be in the shape of a round cylinder, a conical barrel, an elliptical barrel, a rectangular barrel or a polygonal barrel etc.; the plates at least include a corrugated plate 3 and a plain plate 2 (as shown in Fig. 1). Wherein:<br>
the plain plate 2 is provided with a plurality of aeration areas 21 full of net holes 211 (as shown in Fig. 1); and a lot of welding areas 22 without a net hole are provided among the aeration areas 21;<br>
the corrugated plate 3 is provided with a plurality of welding areas 33 (as shown in Fig. 1) which are located at the wave peaks 31 of the corrugated plate 3, and solder 4 is applied on these welding areas 33; the solder 4 applied on these welding areas 33 of the corrugated plate 3 is welded together with the welding areas 22 of the plain plate 2 and then are wound to form the catalyst carrier in the form of a honeycomb (as shown in Fig. 2).<br>
As stated above, the welding areas on the plain plate 2 and the corrugated plate 3 wound can be increased, and the strength as well as the life of use of the catalyst carrier can also be increased.<br>
When waste gas 5 enters the catalyst carrier in the form of a honeycomb, the waste gas 5 will generate turbulent flow by mutual communication among the net holes 211 of the aeration areas 21 on the plain plate 2 (referring to Figs. 13 and 14), thereby, the stay time of the waste gas 5 in the catalyst carrier in the form of a honeycomb is increased, and the waste gas 5 can thereby adequately react with the catalyst in the carrier to increase the efficiency of the catalyst in purifying the waste gas 5.<br>
By the fact that the welding areas 22 of the plain plate 2 and the welding areas 33 of the corrugated plate 3 in the present invention are not provided with net holes (as shown in Figs. 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11), they can effectively increase the welding areas between the plates, and the welding strength as well as the life of use of the catalyst carrier can also be increased.<br>
In practicing the present invention, the arrangement that the aeration areas 21 are full of net holes 211 and the welding areas 22 are formed on the plain plate 2 can be changed to get another style of arrangement on the plain plate 2 and the corrugated plate 3 (referring to Figs. 3 and 4); that is, the corrugated plate 3 can be provided with a plurality of aeration areas 32 full of net holes 321 and a plurality of welding areas 33, while the plain plate 2 can be left a blank plate.<br>
And further in practicing the present invention, the plain plate 2 and the corrugated plate 3 are both provided with aeration areas 21 and 32 full of net holes 211 and 321 as well as welding areas 22, and<br>
33 (referring to Figs. 5 and 6) to form a further style of arrangement.<br>
The above stated additional arrangements for practicing both can increase the welding strength as well as the life of use of the plates in the catalyst carrier.<br>
And more, the welding structure for a catalyst carrier in the form of a honeycomb of the present invention mainly has the welding areas 22, 33 on the plain plate 2 and the corrugated plate 3 welded together and wound to form a shape, under the same condition, the solder 4 can be applied by a manufacturer on the welding areas 22, 33 of the plain plate 2 and the corrugated plate 3 according to the requirement of the manufacturer (as shown in Figs. 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11); it will be no trouble in forming a catalyst carrier in the form of a honeycomb welded together and wound from a plurality of plain plates 2 and corrugated plates 3 with different welding areas 22 and 33 on the plain plate 2 and the corrugated plate 3 (as shown in Figs. 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12).<br>
In conclusion, the welding structure for a catalyst carrier in the form of a honeycomb of the present invention can effectively increase the welding strength as well as the life of use of the plates in the honeycomb shaped catalyst carrier formed by welding the plain plates and the corrugated plates.<br>
Having thus described the technical structure of my invention with industrial value, the structure has never existed in the markets, therefore, what I claim as new and desire to be secured by Letters Patent of India are:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
