THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED<br>
ORIGINAL<br>
650/MUMNP/2003<br><br>
The invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions in the form of tablets which contain Cefixime and for a process of making the same.<br>
In particular, this invention relates to a drug delivery system for delivering Cefixime.<br>
Cefixime is hygroscopic, slightly soluble in water; sparingly soluble in dehydrated alcohol; practically insoluble in ethyl acetate; freely soluble in methyl alcohol. A 5% suspension in water has a pH of 2.6 to 4.1.<br>
Cefixime is a cephalosporin antibiotic, which can be administered orally and resembles, in respect of its structure, the spectrum of organisms and the beta-lactamase stability, the 3rd generation cephalosporins of the Cefotaxime type, which can be administered parent rally the introduction of an acid substituent into the 7.beta.-side chain of aminothiazolyl-cephalosporins, as, for example, in Cefixime, leads to a compound, which can be absorbed enterally.<br>
Like all representatives of this class of substances, it has a bactericidal action. The mechanism of action of Cefixime is based on inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis. The acute toxicity of Cefixime is negligibly low. Cefixime is stable to hydrolysis by many beta-lactamases. It has a mode of action and spectrum of activity similar to that of the third-generation cephalosporin Cefotaxime but some Enterobacteriaceae are less susceptible to Cefixime. Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are sensitive, including penicillinase-producing strains. Of the Gram-positive bacteria, streptococci are sensitive to Cefixime but most strains of staphylococci, enterococci, and Listeria spp. are not.<br><br>
Only 40 to 50% of an oral dose of Cefixime is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, whether taken before or after meals, although the rate of absorption may be decreased in the presence of food. Conventionally, Cefixime is better absorbed from oral suspension than from tablets. Absorption is fairly slow. Peak plasma concentrations of 2 to 3 micrograms per ml and 3.7 to 4.6 micrograms per ml have been reported between 2 and 6 hours after single doses of 200 and 400 mg, respectively. The plasma half-life is usually about 3 to 4 hours and may be prolonged when there is renal impairment. About 65% of Cefixime in the circulation is bound to plasma proteins. Information on the distribution of Cefixime in body tissues and fluids is limited. It crosses the placenta. Relatively high concentrations may be achieved in bile and urine. About 20% of an oral dose (or 50% of an absorbed dose) is excreted unchanged in the urine within 24 hours. Up to 60% may be eliminated by non-renal mechanisms; there is no evidence of metabolism but some is probably excreted into the faeces from bile. It is not substantially removed by dialysis.<br>
Cefixime is suitable for the treatment of acute and chronic infections of varying severity caused by Cefixime-sensitive pathogens and amenable to oral therapy.<br>
Cefixime has bactericidal effects and is effective, for example, for the following pathogens: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae; Hamophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter sp., Pasteurella multocida, Providencia sp., Salmonella sp., Shigella sp., Citrobacter amalonaticus, Citrobacter diversus, Serratia marcescens.<br>
Cefixime-containing compositions are used only in the form of solid dosage forms such as tablets, capsules, granules or powders.<br><br>
Particularly, this invention relates to extended-release oral drug delivery system comprising as active ingredient Cefixime Trihydrate.<br>
This invention relates to a novel delivery system for Cefixime. Cefixime is generally available in 200 mg strength and 2 to 3 tablets are recommended. The prior dosage has been done keeping in mind that the daily dose is maintained to a maximum of 400 mg only.<br>
An efficient delivery system for a drug depends upon its pharmacokinetic properties such as absorption characteristics, protein binding and clearance, and pharmacodynamic parameters such as the concentration-effect relationship.<br>
When dealing with anti-microbial agents such as Cefixime the selection of a drug delivery system depends mainly on the immune system of the host. Unlike aminoglycosides, in the case of beta lactam antibiotics its antimicrobial activity is not dependent on its concentration. Again, unlike aminoglycosides, the kinetics of the bactericidal effect is slow and requires maintenance of drug effective concentration for a certain lag time to the onset of effect.<br>
The biological half-life of Cefixime is considerably short and therefore in the prior art 2 daily administrations are recommended. A minimum plasma concentration is necessary for a bactericidal activity. However, it is established that increasing the drug concentration above this base value does not correspondingly increase bactericidal activity although continuous infusion is preferable to periodic administration. In fact, high concentrations are counter productive and associated with reduced potency. There is no correlation between drug penetration and serum concentration.<br><br>
Therefore, an oral sustained-release preparation that can maintain low but effective concentrations for a prolonged period will be a suitable mode of administration.<br>
According to this invention there is provided a pharmaceutical extended-release oral drug delivery system for the active ingredient Cefixime trihydrate comprising combining Cefixime trihydrate with a hydrophilic matrix system, and optionally adding therein additional pharmaceutically acceptable constituents, wherein at least 20% up to but not more than 40% of Cefixime trihydrate is released from said matrix within 1 hour from oral administration and the remainder of the active ingredient is released at a sustained rate.<br>
The novel feature of the invention is to provide a once a day dosage of Cefixime fixed at Cefixime U.S.P. 400 mg and there is no fear of exceeding the recommended daily dose.<br>
The hydrophilic polymer selected from the group consisting of hydrophilic cellulose derivatives.<br>
Typically, the hydrophilic polymer selected from the group consisting of hydrophilic cellulose derivatives methyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose and hydroxyethyl methyl cellulose, hydrophilic polyacrylamide derivatives, proteins, alginates, arabinogalactane, chitosan and hydrophilic methacrylic acid derivatives.<br>
The drug delivery system of the invention may further comprise a flavonoid to improve the absorption of the drug.<br><br><br>
The hydrophilic matrix may comprise a hydrophilic polymer and a hydroxy propyl methylcellulose film coating material for protection.<br>
The drug delivery system of the invention may be in any suitable dosage unit form.<br>
A typical process for making the Cefixime composition in accordance with this invention involves<br>
In step 1: the sifting using typically a vibrating sifter Cefixime trihydrate powder, lactose, starch powders to obtain individual homogenous non lump containing free flowing particulate matter.<br>
In step 2: granulation: Transferring. Cefixime Trihydrate, Lactose &amp;. Starch (Maize) to a Planetary Mixer and mixing it for 10 minutes at slow speed. Adding slowly polyvinyl pyrrolidone (K-30) solution to contents of Planetary mixer at slow speed mixing, mixing the contents till uniform granular dough mass is formed. If necessary, additional wetting can be imparted with Isopropyl Alcohol. Transferring wet granules in Stainless Steel Trays of tray drier and drying at around 45.degree. C. for about 5 hours. Drying further till the loss on drying comes within limit. Typically the granules are raked occasionally during drying. Sift the dried granules through 16 # sieve using Vibrosifter &amp; the retained granules are passed through 1.5 mm screen using Multi mill at slow speed.<br>
Step 3 lubrication of dry granules: The dry granules are transferred to a double cone blender. Sifted Methocel K-15M [HPMC], talcum and magnesium stearate are added to the cone blender and the mass in the blender are mixed for about 5 minutes.<br><br><br>
Step 4 Slugging: the lubricated granules are transferred to a compression cubicle having an internal environment of temperature between 15 to 30°C and relative humidity below 55 per cent. The lubricated granules are slugged by compression in the cubicle to obtain slugs of hardness 4 to 5 kg/sq cm.<br>
Step 5 Deslugging the slugs are passed through 2.0 mm screen using multi mill at medium speed the deslugged granules are sifted through 16 mesh. The retained granules are passed through 1.5 mm screen using multi mill of slow speed.<br>
Step 6 slug lubrication: the deslugged granules are transferred to a double cone blender. Cefixime Trihydrate powder, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Colloidal Silicon Dioxide (Aerosil--200), Talcum and Magnesium Stearate are sifted using a vibrating sifter. Cefixime Trihydrate powder, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Colloidal Silicon Dioxide (Aerosil--200), Talcum are added to the double cone blender. And the blender is operated for 10 minutes. The magnesium stearate is then added and blending is further continued for three minutes.<br>
Step 7 core tablet compression: the lubricated deslugged granules are transferred to a compression cubicle having an internal environment of temperature between 15 to 30°C and relative humidity below 55 per cent. The lubricated granules are tableted by compression in the cubicle to obtain tablets of hardness not less than 3 kg/sq cms, average weight of around 640 mg, thickness of 4.4 to 4.8 mm and friability of not more than 1%.<br>
Step 8 film coating of tablet cores: A coating pan is selected having an environment of: temperature between 20 to 30°C and relative humidity below 55% A homogenous solution of Methylene Chloride, Isopropyl Alcohol and HPMC and a plasticizer and titanium dioxide which collectively act as a coloring agent<br><br>
transferred to a sprayer placed near the pan the tablet cores are transferred into the coating pan and the tablet pan is heated by inching process using hot air blower. The initial temperature should not exceed 40°C. Once the tablet bed attains 40°C, it is ready for spray coating. The exhaust is started, and the tablets in the pan are sprayed with coating solution taking the following precautions.<br>
1.	Compressor pressure should not fall below 3 Kg/cm2<br>
2.	Spraying should be stopped immediately, if the air pressure falls below 3 Kg/cm2<br>
3.	Temperature of the tablet bed should be maintained at 40°C<br>
4.	Continuous spraying from start to end would be preferred.<br>
5.	Avoid even slight over wetting.<br>
6.	Avoid dropping of coating solution directly into the coating pan.<br>
7.	Avoid spraying of the solution into blower, exhaust or to the uncovered part of the Coating pan since this will generate coating particles, which may stick to the tablet resulting in rough surfaces.<br>
8.	Powerful exhaust should be provided since it is dangerous to inhale the vapor of Methylene Chloride and IPA over a long period of time.<br>
After the last coat of HPMC coloring agent solution is applied, drying of the tablet is continued for 15-20 minutes. Thereafter talcum is applied to the tablet bed to get the required gloss. The film-coated tablets are rolled for 5 minutes and then transferred to trays. In the trays the tablets are fried in tray drier at 50°C for one to two hours to obtain dry film coated tablets in accordance with this invention.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention the hydrophilic polymer matrix comprises hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose together with flavonoids typically quercetin, genistein, naringin, diosmin, acacetin and chrysin<br><br><br>
which are added QS at step 2 during granulation. The flavonoids enhance the absorption of the drug in the GI tract.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the invention the drug delivery system includes the additive selected from salts, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, colloidal silicon dioxide, sodium lauryl sulfate, magnesium stearate, lactose &amp; starch.<br>
A drug delivery system according to this invention is in dosage unit form, typically, in the form of film coated extended release tablet, which may be coated with a pharmaceutically acceptable coating which in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention is of hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents.<br>
An important object of this mvention is to improve patient compliance by minimizing the frequency of drug administration to once a day.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a drug delivery system that will supply an immediate dose of cefixime trihydrate followed by sustained subsequent doses and which is 100% safe in the gastric system and is stable and not influenced by pH at any point.<br>
A feature of the invention is that the drug delivery system is in the form of micro pulverized material, which is used to facilitate absorption, and at the same time the Matrix is inert. Yet another feature of the invention is that the delivery system is in a film coated tablet form, which facilitates:<br>
•	Easy swallowing<br>
•	Provides taste masking<br><br>
•	Supreme stability<br>
•	Excellent aesthetic looks<br>
The principal feature of the process of this invention involves imbedding granules/particles or other bioactive cefixime material in an inert hydrophilic polymeric or cellulosic matrix system such as in hydroxy propyl methylcellulose. A water sensitive molecule is used to make the tablet totally non aqueous.<br>
The process of this invention involves granulation of the USP grade Cefixime particulate material; along with excipients, starch and lactose to obtain granules of 16 to 20 mesh size. The granules are added to the polymer matrix base and slugged to imbed the active material in the matrix and deslugged through a sieve to achieve fragmented granules of 16 to 20-mesh size containing Cefixime imbedded in the polymer matrix. These granules are compressed conventionally in a tablet compression machine at pressures ranging from 4 to 6 kg/sq cm to obtain the tablets of this invention which are film coated with a polymer such as HPMC to obtain a film coated tablet. Film coating further improves its Stability and Palatability.<br>
The polymer matrix helps to regulate the release of Cefixime in the systemic circulation such that the Minimum Effective Concentration is maintained for 24 hours. The initial 200 mg dose is made available in the first hour in the normal course.<br>
