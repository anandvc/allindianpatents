The present invention relates to novel chemical compounds" which stimulate soluble guanylate cyclase also via a novel mechanism of action which proceeds without participation of the haem group of the enzyme, to their preparation and to their use as medicaments, in particular as medicaments for treating cardiovascular disorders.<br>
One of the most important cellular transmission systems in mammalian cells is cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Together with nitrogen monoxide (NO), which is released from the endothelium and transmits hormonal and mechanical signals, it forms the NO/cGMP system. Guanylate cyclases catalyse the biosynthesis of cGMP -from guanosine triphosphate (GTP). The known representatives of this family can be classified both according to structural features and according to the type of ligands into two groups: the particular guanylate cyclases, which can be stimulated by natriuretic peptides, and the soluble guanylate cyclases, which can be stimulated by NO. The soluble guanylate cyclases consist of two subunits and, most likely, contain one haem per heterodimer, which is part of the regulatory centre. It is of central importance for the activation mechanism. NO can bind to the iron atom of the haem and thus increase the activity of the enzyme considerably. In contrast, haem-free preparations cannot be stimulated by NO. CO, too, is capable of attacking the central iron atom of haem, but the stimulation by CO is considerably lower than that by NO.<br>
By binding cGMP, and owing to the resulting regulation of phosphodiesterases, ion channels and protein kinases, gualfryTate cyclase~plays an important rdle in various physiological processes, in particular in the relaxation and proliferation of smooth muscle cells, in platelet aggregation and platelet adhesion and in neuronal signal transmission, and also in disorders which are based on a disturbance of the abovementioned processes. Under pathophysiological conditions, the NO/cGMP system can be suppressed, which may lead, for example, to hypertension, platelet activation, increased cell proliferation, endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis, angina pectoris, cardiac insufficiency, thromboses, stroke and myocardial infarct.<br>
Owing to the expected high efficiency and few side effects, a treatment of such disorders which targets the influence of the cGMP signal path in organisms and is NO-independent is a promising approach.<br>
Hitherto, for the therapeutic stimulation of soluble guanylate cyclase use has exclusively been made of compounds such as organic nitrates whose effect is based<br><br>
on NO. This is formed by biocon version and activates soluble guanylate cyclase by attack at the central iron atom of haem. In addition to the side effects, the development of tolerance is one of the decisive disadvantages of this treatment.<br>
Within the last few years, some substances have been described, which stimulate soluble guanylate cyclase directly, i.e. without prior release of NO, such as, for example, 3-(5'-hydroxymethyI-2'-furyl)-l-benzylindazoIe (YC-1, Wu et al., Blood 84 (1994), 4226; Miilsch_et al BrJ Pharmacol. 120 (1997), W)7"fatty acids (Goldberg et al, J. Biol. Chem. 252 (1977), 1279), diphenyliodonium hexafluorophosphate (Pettibone" et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol. 116 (1985), 307), isoliquiritigenin (Yu et al., Brit. J. Pharmacol. 114 (1995), 1587), and various substituted pyrazole derivatives (WO 98/16223, WO 98/16507 and WO 98/23619).<br>
The known stimulators of soluble guanylate cyclases stimulate the enzyme either<br>
directly via the haem group (carbon monoxide, nitrogen monoxide or<br>
diphenyliodoniumhexafluorophosphate) by interaction with the iron centre of the<br>
haem group and a resulting change in conformation which leads to an increase in<br>
enzyme activity (Gerzer et al., FEBS Lett. 132(1981), 71), or via a haem-dependent<br>
mechanism which is independent of NO but leads to a potentiation of the stimulating<br>
effect of NO or CO (for example YC-1, Hoenicka et al., J. Mo!. Med (1999) 14; or<br>
the pyrazole derivatives described in WO 98/16223, WO 98/16507 and<br>
WO 98/23619).	<c_ ...._-></c_>
The stimulating effect, asserted in the literature, of isoliquiritigenin and of fatty acids, such as, for example, arachidonic acid, prostaglandin endoperoxides and fatty acid hydroperoxides, on soluble guanylate cyclase could not be confirmed (cf., for example, Hoenicka et al., J. Mol. Med. 77 (1999), 14).<br>
If the haem group of soluble guanylate cyclase is removed, the enzyme still shows a detectable catalytic basal activity, i.e. as before, cGMP is formed. The remaining catalytic basal activity of the haem-free enzyme cannot be stimulated by any of the abovementioned known stimulators.<br>
Stimulation of haem-free soluble guanylate cyclase by protoporphyrin DC has been described (Ignarro et al., Adv. Pharmacol. 26 (1994), 35). However, protoporphyrin IX can be considered to be a mimic of the NO-haem adduct, owing to which the addition of protoporphyrin IX to soluble guanylate cyclase should result in the<br><br><br>
formation of an enzyme structure which corresponds to the haem-containing soluble<br>
guanylate cyclase which is stimulated by NO. This is also confirmed by the fact that<br>
the stimulating effect of protoporphyrin IX is increased by the NO-independent, but<br>
haem-dependent, stimulator YC-1 described above (Miilsch et al., Naunyn<br>
Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 355, R47 ).	<br>
Thus, hitherto no compounds have been described which are capable of stimulating soluble guanylate cyclase independently of the haem group present in the enzyme.<br>
It was an object of the present invention to develop medicaments for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders or other disorders which can be treated by influencing the cGMP signal path in organisms.<br>
The abovementioned object is achieved by using, for the preparation of medicaments, compounds which are capable of stimulating soluble guanylate cyclase also independently of NO and the haem group present in the enzyme.<br>
Surprisingly, it has been found that there are compounds which are capable of stimulating soluble guanylate cyclase also independently of the haem group present in the enzyme. The biological activity of these stimulators is based on an entirely novel mechanism for stimulating soluble guanylate cyclase. In contrast to the above-described compounds which are known from the prior art as stimulators of soluble guanylate cyclase,  the compounds  according to the invention are capable of stimulating both the haem-containing and the haem-free form of soluble guanylate cyclase. In the case of these novel stimulators, the stimulation of the enzyme is therefore effected via a haem-independent route, which is also confirmed by the fact that, on the one hand, the novel stimulators do not show any synergistic action with NO at the haem-containing enzyme and, on the other hand, the action of these novel stimulators cannot be blocked by the haem-dependent inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase, lH-l,2,4-oxadiazol-(4,3a)-quinoxalin-l-one (ODQ).<br>
This is a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders and other disorders which can be treated by influencing the cGMP signal path in organisms.<br>
EP-A-0 345 068 describes, inter alia, the aminoalkanecarboxylic acid (1) as an intermediate in the synthesis of GAB A antagonists:<br><br><br><br>
WO 93/00359 describes the aminoalkanecarboxylic acid (2) as an intermediate in<br>
*ip*^sÂ»TÂ«ar"iniÂ»',^,^.,Â»'<br><br><br>
peptide synthesis and its use as an active compound for treating disorders of the central nervous system:<br><br>
However, neither of these two publications mentions that such aminoalkanecarboxylic acids can have a stimulating effect on soluble guanylate cyclase which is independent of the haem group present in the enzyme.<br>

The reaction can generally be carried out in a temperature range of from -20Â°C to +90Â°C, preferably from 0Â°C to +70Â°C. The reaction can be carried out at atmospheric pressure, elevated or reduced pressure (for example in a range of from 0.5 to 5 bar). In general, the reaction is carried out at atmospheric pressure.<br>
In the processes A to C according to the invention, a compound of the formula (I) is prepared by nucleophilic substitution of a leaving group E in one of the compounds of the formula (EI), (V) or (VII) by the amine function of one of the compounds of the formula (II), (IV) or (VI).

carbonate, potassium carbonate, Et3N, DABCO, K2C03, KOH, NaOH or NaH. The reaction can generally be carried out in a temperature range of from -20Â°C to +90Â°C, preferably from 0Â°C to +90Â°C.

Suitable leaving groups E are, for example: halogen, tosylate, mesylate, or a hydroxyl function which is activated by reagents such as diisopropyl azodicarboxylate/PPh3 (Mitsonobu reaction).<br>
In the process E according to the invention, a compound of the formula (I), where R1 and R each represent a free carboxyl function, is obtained by converting ester and/or nitrile functions of the compound (X) into the corresponding free carboxyl functions. This reaction can be carried out, for example, by adding aqueous solutions of strong acids, such as, for example, HC1 or H2SO4, or strong bases, such as, for example, NaOH, KOH or LiOH. The reaction can be carried out in one of the abovementioned organic solvents, in water or in mixtures of organic solvents or in mixtures of organic solvents with water. Preference according to the invention is given, for example, to carrying out the reaction in a mixture of water and methanol or dioxane. The reaction can generally be carried out in a temperature range of from -20Â°C to +90Â°C, preferably from 0Â°C to +90Â°C. The reaction can be carried out at atmospheric pressure, elevated or reduced pressure (for example in a range of from 0.5 to 5 bar).

Formally, the reaction is a reductive coupling of the compounds of the formulae (XI) and (XII), as described, for example, in L.S. Hegedus, Organometallics in Synthesis, M. Schlosser, Ed., Wiley &amp; Sons, 1994.<br><br>
In the compounds of the formula (XT), the substitutable group L can, for example, be a halogen radical, such as Br or I, or a customary leaving group, such as, for example, a triflate radical.<br>
The compounds of the formula (XII) contain a reactive group Z which can be selected from the group consisting of-B(OH)2, -CH^CH, -CH=CH2 or-Sn(nBu)3.<br>

If required, it is possible to add additionally a reducing agent, such as, for example, triphenylphosphine, or other additives, such as, for example, Cu(I)Br, NBU4NQ, LiCl or Ag3PC&gt;4, to the reaction mixture (cf. T. Jeffery, Tetrahedron Lett. 1985, 26, 2667-2670; T. Jeffery, J. Chem. Soc, Chem. Comrnun. 1984, 1287-1289; S. Erase, A. deMejiere in "Metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions", Ed. F. Diederich, P. J. Stang, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim 1998, 99-166).<br>
The reaction is carried out in the presence of a customary base, such as, for example, Na2C03, NaOH or triethylamine. Suitable solvents are the organic solvents mentioned above, and particular preference is given to ethers, such as, for example, dimethoxyethane. The reaction can, in general, be carried out in a temperature range of from -20Â°C to +90Â°C, preferably from 0Â°C to +90Â°C.

Thus, the first step of the process G proceeds analogously to the process D, but instead of the compounds of the formula (IX), compounds of the formula (XIH) are reacted here with the alcohols or thiols of the formula (XTO). This gives the unsaturated compounds of the formula (XIV), which can be converted by customary hydrogenation processes into the compounds of the formula (I).<br><br>
Preference according to the invention is given to the hydrogenation of compounds of the formula (XTV) with hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst, such as, for example, Pd/carbonorPtO.<br>
The process G can be carried out in one of the abovementioned organic solvents. Preference is given here to ethyl acetate. In general, the reaction can be carried out in a temperature range of from -20Â°C to +90Â°C, preferably from 0Â°C to +90Â°C. The reaction can be carried out at atmospheric pressure, elevated or reduced pressure (for example in a range of from 0.5 to 5 bar). In general, the reaction is carried out at atmospheric pressure.<br>
The amines of the formulae II, IV and VI are novel and also form part of the subject-matter of the invention.<br>
The novel compounds of the formulae II, IV and VI can be obtained in a generally<br>
known manner by the following methods:	v<br>
a)'by reacting amines of the formulae (XV), (XVI) and (XVII)<br><br><br>
where the radicals R1, R2, R3, m, V, Q, U, W, X, Y and A are as defined above;<br>
with carbonyl compounds of the formulae (XVIII), (XIX), (XX)<br>
/<br><br><br>
where<br>
Ua, Wa and Xa	have the meanings of U, W and X, respectively, but are<br>
one carbon unit shorter, and<br>
T	represents hydrogen or a Ci-C4-alkyI function, which<br>
can also be attached to Ua or Xa to form a cycle, and the other radicals are as defined above,<br>
initially to give a Schiff base which is then reduced with customary reducing agents, such as, for example, NaBKt, H2/Pd/C, etc., or converted directly under the conditions of a reductive alkylation in the presence of a reducing agent, such as, for example, H2/Pd/C, NaCNBH3, NaH(OAc)3 (cf. Patai, Ed., The Chemistry of the Carbon-Nitrogen Double Bond, pp. 276-293 and literature cited therein);<br>
m<br>
b) by reacting amines of the formulae (XV), (XVI) and (XVH) with compounds of the formulae (III), (V), (VII) (cf., for example, J. March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, fourth Edition, Wiley, 1992, page 411 and the literature cited therein).<br>
Amines of the formula (Ha) and compounds of the formula (VIII),<br><br><br>
where Va represents O or S<br>
can be obtained in a generally known manner by the following reaction scheme:<br><br><br><br>
In the above scheme, PGo represents a customary phenol or thiophenol protective group, such as, for example, CH3, CH2Ph, CH2CH=CH2, CH2OCH3, CH20CH2SiMe3, SiMe3, PGn represents an amine protective group, such as, for example, tBuOCO, T represents hydrogen or a Ci-C4-alkyl function which can also be attached to Ua to form a cycle, and Ua has the meaning of U but is one CH2 group shorter. The other radicals are as defined above.<br><br><br><br>
(lib) is obtained, for example, by initially reacting (XVa) with (XVIII) to give a Schiff base which is then reduced with customary reducing agents, such as, for example, NaBH4, H2/Pd/C, etc., or directly reacted under the conditions of a reductive alkylation in the presence of a reducing agent, such as, for example,<br><br>
H2/Pd/C, NaCNBH3 or NaH(OAc)3. The compound (lib) can be converted by reaction with a compound of the formula (IE) in the presence of a base into a compound of the formula (XXI) (cf. process A).<br>
  An 0- or S-protective group in (Eb) or (XXI) can be eliminated using a suitable reagent (cf. T.W. Greene, P.G.M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, second edition, New York, 1991). If, for example, in formula (lib) or (XXI) -Va-PGo represents -O-CH3, the methyl group can be eliminated with formation of the phenol using boron tribromide in methylene chloride at from -70 to 20Â°C, using trimethylsilyl iodide in chloroform at 25-50Â°C or using sodium ethylthiolate in DMF atl50Â°C.<br>
From the resulting compound of the formula (He), a compound of the formula (XXET) can be obtained by protecting the amino function (cf. T.W. Greene, P.G.M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, second edition, New York, 1991) and subsequent reaction of the resulting amine-protected compound of the formula (XXII) with a compound of the formula (DC) (cf. process D).<br>
An N-protective group such as in (XXII) can be introduced and removed again by customary methods (cf. T.W. Greene, P.G.M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, second edition, New York, 1991). If PGn in the formula (XXH) represents, for example, tBuOCO, the protective group can be introduced by reacting the amine with tert-butyl pyrocarbonate in polar or nonpolar solvents at from 0Â°C to 25 Â°C. Removal of the protective group to (Ha) can be carried out with numerous acids, such as, for example, HC1, H2S04 or CF3COOH, at from 0Â° to 25Â°C (cf. the literature cited above).<br>

If E in the formulae (III), (V), (VII) and (DC) represents halogen, the compounds can also be prepared by generally known processes, for example by reaction of an alcohol with a chlorinating agent, such as, for example, thionyl chloride or sulphuryl chloride, (cf., for example, J.

Vasal relaxant action in vitro<br>
Rabbits are anaesthetized by intravenous injection of thiopental sodium or killed (about 50 mg/kg) and exsanguinated. The arteria saphena is removed and divided into 3 mm wide rings. The rings are individually mounted on in each case one triangular pair of hooks, open at the end, made of 0.3 mm strong special wire (RemaniumÂ®). Under a pretension, each ring is transferred into 5 ml organ baths containing a warm, carbogen-aerated Krebs-Henseieit solution at 37Â°C having the following composition (mM): NaCl: 119; KC1: 4.8; CaCl2 x 2 H20: 1; MgS04 x 7 H20: 1.4; KH2P04: 1.2; NaHC03: 25; glucose: 10; bovine serum albumin: 0.001%. The contractility is detected using Statham UC2 cells, amplified and digitalized by means of A/D converters (DAS-1802 HC, Keithley Instruments Munich), and recorded in parallel on linear recorders. Contractions are induced by addition of phenylephrin.<br>
After several (in general 4) control cycles, the substance to be investigated is added in each further passage in increasing dosage, and the height of the contraction acheived under the influence of the test substance is compared with the height of the contraction achieved in the last preliminary passage. From this, the concentration which is necessary in order to reduce the contraction achieved in the preliminary control by 50% ((IC50) is calculated. The standard administration volume is 5 /xl. The proportion of DMSO in the bath solution corresponds to 0.1 %.<br>
The results are shown in Table 1:<br><br>

Stimulation of recombinant soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) in vitro<br>
The investigations on the stimulation of recombinant soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) and the compounds according to the invention with and without sodium nitroprusside and with and without the haem-dependent sGC inhibitor 1/7-1,2,4-oxadiazole-(4,3a)-quinoxalin-l-one (ODQ) were carried out by the method described in detail in the following literature reference: M. Hoenicka, E.M. Becker, H. Apeler, T. Sirichoke, H. Schroeder, R. Gerzer and J.-P. Stasch: Purified soluble guanylyl cyclase expressed in a baculovirus/Sf9 system: stimulation t&gt;y YC-1, nitric oxide, and carbon oxide. J. Mol. Med. 77 (1999): 14-23.<br>
Haem-free guanylate cyclase was obtained by adding Tween 20 to the sample buffer (final concentration 0.5%).<br>
Activation of sGC by a test substance is stated as n-fold stimulation of basal activity.<br><br>
The results are shown in Table 2.<br>

It can be seen from Table 2 that stimulation both of the haem-containing and of the haem-free enzyme is achieved. Furthermore, a combination of sGC stimulator and sodium nitroprusside (SNP), an NO donor, does not show any synergistic effect, i.e. the effect of'SNP is not potentiated, as would be expected for an sGC stimulator acting via a haem-dependent mechanism. In addition, the effect of the sGC stimulator according to the invention is not blocked by the haem-dependent inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase, ODQ. Thus, the results in Table 2 demonstrate the novel mechanism of action of the stimulators according to the invention of soluble guanylate cyclase.<br>
