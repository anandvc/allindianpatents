The present innovation is concerned with a shifting device for horizontal shifting of heavy load, e.g., derailed rail cars or the like, according to the introductory part of claim 1.<br>
In shifting devices of this type that have become known thus far, the locking tie rod supports the shifting device against the support contrary to the shifting direction. Once the shifting cylinder has attained its maximum shifting path, however, the shifting cylinder including the tie-rod casing is pulled along, with the locking tie rod being thereby automatically unlocked and the locking position is effected in the next following recesses in this direction. These known shifting devices were thus provided only for shifting heavy loads in one direction. If, however, a movement in the opposite direction had to be effected with shifting devices of this kind, it was necessary to apply an additional device to the load, and it was per force necessary that operators had to go under the load.<br>
It is the task of this innovation to improve the shifting device of this type in such a manner that an exact and secure shift can be effected in both directions to the support<br>
This task has been solved in that in the tie-rod casing, the locking tie rod can be brought vertically from a rest position to a locking position and vice versa, that the locking in the locking position is effective in both directions towards the support and the shifting cylinder can be acted on by force in both directions. The innovation ensures operation in both directions without the operating personnel having to go below the load in order to see to reversing the shifting device.<br><br>
According to claim 2, the locking tie rod is constantly tensioned by an elastic element, particularly a spring. Retraction of the locking tie rod is advantageously effected faydraulicalty.<br>
The design according to claim 4 ensures an exact positioning of the tie-rod casing in the opposite direction to the support, whereby it is ensured that the locking tie rod dips into the respective recess without malfunctions occuring.<br>
The recesses are advantageously dimensioned in such a way that by virtue of its own weight or its initial tension, the locking tie rod will move into the recess without problems during the shifting along the support.<br>
The objects of claims 7-10 concern advantageous developments of the shifting device, using an optical control, as to whether the shifting device is situated (completely) in the unlocking or locking position.<br>
The upwardly tapered form of the end of the locking tie rod dipping into the respective recess ensures a self-locking effect of the shifting device.<br>
The use of a doubly acting shifting cylinder, e.g. a telescopic shifting cylinder, offers increased shifting capacities.<br>
The use of a control platform which by way of control lines is connected with the connections of the shifting cylinder and/or the lifting cylinder, respectively, makes possible operation at a safe distance from the load.<br>
The use of a guide plate between the lifting cylinder and the base for the lifting cylinder makes possible the balancing of transverse forces occuring during shifting and thereby prevents dangerous instabilities of the load that is to shifted.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a shifting device for horizontal shifting of heavy loads, such as derailed rail cars or the like, with at least one lifting cylinder to raise the load, a support such as rerailing bridge, as well as preferably a hydraulically actuated shifting mechanism, wherein the shifting mechanism has at least one horizontally arranged shifting cylinder which by means of a locking tie rod is mechanically lockable to the support in different positions on the latter's surface, and which engages in the range of the lifting cylinder or its support and effects a horizontal shifting of it relative to the support, characterized in that in the tie-rod casing the locking tie rod can be brought vertically from a rest position to a locking position and vice versa, that the locking in the locking position is effective in both directions to the support and the shifting cylinder can be acted on by force in both directions.<br>
The advantageous development of the present innovation is described below in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings in which<br>
Fig. 1 shows a perspective representation of a shifting device of the type according to the innovation situated on a rerailing bridge;<br>
Fig.   2 shows a cross-sectional view of the shifting cylinder including the tie rod as well as the tie rod casing of the shifting device according to Fig. 1, and<br>
Fig. 3 shows a further development of the shifting cylinder including tie rod and tie-rod casing in a partial cross-sectional view.<br>
Reference symbol 1 in Fig. 1 designates the shifting device 1 of the innovation in its entirety. In the representation according to Fig. 1 it is situated on the upper side of a support 3, for example a rerailing bridge placed on the upper side of the rails, which is shown only in part.<br><br>
. _B shifting device 1 includes a lifting cylinder 2 for raising the load to be shifted. The lifting cylinder 2 is connected with two hydraulic pressure lines by means 01 two connections 13, 20. Between the supports and the lifting cylinder 2 there is a base 4, at the bottom side of which inserts (not shown) are advantageously provided to increase the gliding ability of base 4 along support 5.<br>
Arranged between the lifting cylinder 2 and its base 4 is a so-called guide plate 22, which by way of a holding boss (not shown) is connected on its bottom side to the base 4 for the lifting cylinder 2. The holding boss engages a corresponding recess (not shown) in the base 4 in this manner and it is dimensioned so that a lateral movement of the guide plate 22 is made possible, particularly in the cross direction to the moving direction of the base 4.<br>
The horizontal shifting of lifting cylinder 2 including its base 4 is effected by way of a shifting cylinder 3 extending horizontally along the support 5, one end of which exhibits a tie-rod casing 7 and the other end of which engages the base 4 of lifting cylinder 2 by way of a piston rod 8.<br>
It can furthermore be gathered from Fig. 1 that arranged at determined distances from each other, recesses 16 are provided along the support 5, into which engages a tie-rod, not visible in Fig 1, which is accommodated in the tie-rod casing 7, to lock the shifting cylinder 3 in both directions to the support 5.<br>
The tie-rod casing 7 displays additionally guide plates 11 which are shaped in such a manner that they embrace bosses (6) arranged laterally at the support 5 and in this way ensure an exact positioning of the tie-rod casing 7, i.e., the tie rod in cross direction to support 5, without however detiimentally affecting the possibility of longitudinal movement.<br><br>
The individual connections 12,13 and 14 of the shifting cylinder 3 or of the tie-rod casing 7, respectively, as well as the connections 15, 20 of the double-acting lifting cylinder 2 are connected by way of suitable connections to a control panel (not shown), so that the operation of the shifting device can be effected at a safe distance from the load.<br>
As becomes clear from Fig. 1 and 2, the tie-rod casing 7 is shaped in such a manner that the tie-rod 9, with the firmly connected tie-rod head 19, is visible at the upper side of tie-rod casing 7. In addition, the locking tie rod 9 is pre-tensioned in Fig. 2 by a spring 10 in the locking position, wherein, according to Fig. 2, the top side of tie-rod head 19 ends flush with the upper side of the tie-rod casing 7. The movement of the locking tie rod from the locking position, i.e., the initially tensioned position, to the unlocking position is effected hydraulically, whereby, in the unlocked position of the locking tie rod, the tie-rod bead 19 simultaneously protrudes from the upper side of the locking casing 7 and makes possible an optical control of the condition of the shifting device 1.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a slightly modified version of the shifting cylinder 3, including the tie-rod casing 7 and the locking tie rod 9. The difference with respect to the preceding development is that herein a separate control pin 17 is provided, which in the unloaded state is held in the boring by a spring 21. However, when the locking tie-rod 9 moves over to an unlocking position, the confrol pin 17 is pushed out of its boring by the movement of locking tie rod 9 and therefore represents an optical control element to check the respective operating status of the shifting device 1.<br>
It is furthermore well distinguishable from Fig. 3 that the side of locking tie rod 9 facing the respective recess 16 is shaped tapering upward, which in the case of a horizontal load of the locking tie rod 9 ensures a self-locking frinction in the locking condition.<br><br>
It is clear from Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 that the form of the locking tie rod 9 is intended to ensure a locking function which acts in both directions.<br>
At the upper side of the shifting cylinder 3, a handle 18 is arranged by which the shifting device 1 can be transported or set up in a simple manner.<br>
A connection of the piston rod 8 to the base 4 of lifting cylinder 2 is provided at the left side of the piston rod 8 of the shifting cylinder 3.<br>
Operation of the shifting device 1 according to the innovation takes place in such a way that the shifting device 1 is set up at the upper side of the support or rerailing bridge 3. The load is raised subsequently. To shift the load, the shifting cylinder 3 is actuated, whereby the latter is braced by the locking tie rod 9, which is in . the locking position, i.e. it is engaged in one of the recesses 16 provided at the upper side of supports, and effects a shifting of the load along support 5. If the shifting path of shifting cylinder 3 is exhausted, the locking tie rod 9 is raised hydraulically inside the locking casing 7, whereby the shifting cylinder 3 can be shifted further or into another direction.<br>
The innovation is in a position, in contrast to the previously known shifting devices 1, to make possible a bilateral shifting of the load without additional measures to be taken from below the load. The shifting device 1 represents a very considerable technical contribution in the respective field of the rerailing technology.<br><br><br>
