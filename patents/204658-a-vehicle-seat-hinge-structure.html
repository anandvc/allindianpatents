THE PATENTS RULES, 2003 COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"A VEHICLE SEAT HINGE STRUCTURE"<br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, having a place of business at 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan,<br>
The  following  specification  particularly  describes  the  invention  and  the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
[Detailed Description of Invention] <br>
[Technical Field of the Invention] The present invention relates to a vehicle seat hinge structure which normally operates a seat switch to detect a driver's sitting in a seat, and further, preferably reduces the manufacturing cost.<br>
[Prior Art] As a seat hinge structure of vehicle such as a motorcycle, for example, a structure disclosed in Japanese Published Unexamined Utility-Model Application No. Hei 2-44591 "Motorcycle Seat Switch Apparatus" is known.<br><br>
Fig. 3 of the above-mentioned publication shows a seat switch apparatus where stays 35, 35 are extended from a front wall 29 of a container box 12 and vertical long holes 36, 36 are formed in the stays 35, 35, a bracket 34 is attached to a seat frame 31 of a seat 5, and a hinge pin 30 is inserted through the long holes 36, 36 of the stays 35, 35 and both ends of the hinge pin 30 is integrally attached to the bracket 34, thereby the seat 5 is openably/closably and upward-downward movably attached to the container box 12. A plate spring 38 is attached to the respective container box 12 and the hinge pin 30, and a seat switch 23 to detect downward movement of the seat 5 by the driver's sitting in the seat 5 via the plate spring 38 is attached to an attachment tongue 29a provided in the contained box 12.<br>
[Problems to Be Solved by the Invention]<br>
In the art of the above publication, as parts to determine the position of the seat switch 23 to turn on/off the seat switch 23 and to influence the stroke amount of the detection portion of the seat switch 23, the container box 12 (and the attachment tongue 29a) , the plate spring 38, the hinge pin 30, the bracket 34 and the seat frame 31 are given.<br>
For example, if manufacturing errors in the above respective parts are accumulated, the distance between the plate spring 38 and the seat switch 23 may be out of a predetermined range.  If the distance is excessively longer than the predetermined range, the stroke amount of the<br><br>
detection portion of the seat switch 23 is small, and the seat switch 23 cannot be turned on.<br>
Further, if the distance is excessively shorter than the predetermined range, the distance between the plate spring 38 and the seat switch 23 is short, and the detection portion of the seat switch 23 is pushed in and the switch remains on.<br>
In this manner, the distance between the plate spring 38 and the seat switch 23 is easily varied, and as a result, the seat switch 23 may not normally operate.<br>
Otherwise, if dimensional tolerances of the above respective parts are set to be small in order to maintain the distance between the plate spring 38 and the seat switch 23 within the predetermined range, the manufacturing costs of the respective parts will increase. <br>
Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a vehicle seat hinge structure which normally operates a seat switch to detect a driver1 s sitting in a seat, and further, reduces the manufacturing cost.<br>
[Means to Solve the Problems]<br>
To attain the foregoing object, claim 1 is characterized in that in a vehicle seat hinge structure where a seat can be opened/closed with respect to a vehicle body side by providing a first hinge member on the vehicle body side, attaching a second hinge member to the seat side, and connecting the second hinge member to the first hinge member by a hinge pin, wherein switch<br><br><br>
means for detecting sitting in the seat is attached to the first hinge member, and wherein a detection portion of the switch means is faced with the second hinge member to be brought in a non-detection/detection state in correspondence with an open/close status of the second hinge member.<br>
Conventionally, the container box, the attachment tongue, the plate spring, the hinge pin, the bracket, and the seat frame are required to turn on/off the seat switch.  On the other hand, in the present invention, only the first hinge member, the container box, the second hinge member and the bottom plate are required to turn on/off the switch means. <br>
Accordingly, in the present invention, the number of parts to turn on/off the switch means can be reduced, and when these parts are assembled, the integration of difference between actual sizes of the respective parts and median values of dimensional tolerances of the respective parts can be reduced. Thus the distance between the second hinge member and the switch means can be easily maintained within a predetermined range, and the switch means can be normally actuated..<br><br>
Further, since it is not necessary to increase processing precision and assembly precision of the respective parts to manage the distance between the second hinge member and the switch means, i.e., the dimensions, the manufacturing cost of the seat hinge can be reduced.<br><br><br>
[Working  Example]<br>
A working example of the present invention will be described with reference to the attached drawings. Note that the figures are to be viewed along directions of reference numerals.<br>
The present invention relates to a vehicle seat hinge structure where a seat can be opened/closed with respect to a vehicle body side by providing a first hinge member on the vehicle body side, attaching a second hinge member to the seat side, and connecting the second hinge member to the first hinge member by a hinge pin, wherein switch means for detecting sitting in the seat is attached to said first hinge member, and wherein a detection portion of the switch means is faced with said second hinge member to be brought in a non-detection/detection state in correspondence with an open/close status of the second hinge member.<br><br><br>

A scooter vehicle 10 is a vehicle where a container box 12 on the vehicle body side is attached to the rear part of a vehicle body frame 11, an upper opening of the container box 12 is covered with a seat 13, and the seat 13 is openably/closably attached to the container box 12 by a seat hinge 14. Note that numeral 15 denotes a bottom plate attached to a bottom part of the seat 13; 16, a body cover; 17, a power unit; and 18, a rear wheel.<br>
Fig. 2 is an enlarged side view showing the seat hinge structure according to the present invention. A first hinge member 21 is attached to a front part of the container box 12 by a bolt 22, a second hinge member 23 is attached to the bottom plate 15 of the seat 13 (See Fig. 1) by a nut 24, and the second hinge member 23 is swingably attached to the first hinge member 21 via a hinge pin 25, further, a seat switch 28 as the switch means is attached to the first hinge member 21 by a screw 26 and a nut 27. Note that numeral 31 denotes a plate spring to push up the hinge pin 25 by an elastic force. <br><br>
In a vehicle having specifications to automatically raise a stand by e.g. depression of switch, the seat switch 28 is used for detecting the driver's sitting in the seat 13 (See Fig. 1) to prevent the stand from rising even by depression of switch in a status where a driver is sitting in the seat 15 and to control engine drive.<br>
Fig. 3 is an expanded perspective view showing the seat hinge structure according to the present invention.  The first hinge member 21 has long holes 33, 33 along up-and-down directions for insertion of the hinge pin 25, an attachment member 34 to be attached to the container box 12 (See Fig. 1) , attachment holes 35 to 38 opened in the attachment member 34, an L-shaped bracket 41 fixed to the attachment member 34, and a seat switch attachment hole 42 opened in the L-shaped bracket 41. Note that numerals 43, 43 denote stoppers to regulate horizontal swings of the second hinge member 23 when the seat is opened.<br>
The attachment holes 37, 38 are long holes lengthened in a direction where the hinge pin 25 extends.<br>
The second hinge member 23 has pin insertion holes 45, 45 in which the hinge pin 25 is inserted, a nut (not shown) adjacent to a side portion of the rear side pin insertion hole 45 into which a male screw 46 formed at an end of the hinge pin 25 is screwed in, an attachment member 47 to be attached to the bottom plate 15 (See Fig. 2) of the seat 13 (See Fig. 1) , attachment holes 48, 48, 51 opened in the attachment member<br><br><br>
47, and a downward projection 52 projected downward from the attachment member 47.<br>
The attachment hole 51 is a long hole lengthened in the direction where the hinge pin 25 extends.<br>
The hinge pin 25 is provided with a flange 54 at one end.<br>
The seat switch 28 has a switch main body 56, a cover member 57 which covers an opening of the switch main body 56, a detection portion 58 proj ectable/withdrawable from an upper part of the switch main body 56, an attachment member 61 to attach the seat switch 28 to the L-shaped bracket 41 of the first hinge member 21, and a first terminal 62 and a second terminal 63 to take out an on/off signal. Note that numeral 64 denotes an attachment hole.<br>
When the second hinge member 23 does not move downward, the detection portion 58 is projected and in a state where the first and second terminals 62 and 63 are electrically separated from each other (i.e., off state).<br>
Further, when the second hinge member 2 3 moves downward, the detection portion 58 is inserted in the switch main body 56 and in a state where the first and second terminals 62 and 63 are electrically connected to each other (i.e., on state).<br>
The plate spring 31 has attachment holes 66 to 69 to be attached, with the first hinge member 21, to the container box 12 (See Fig. 1), and projection pieces 72, 72 to be pressed against a lower part of the hinge pin 25.<br><br>
Next, the operation of the seat hinge structure as described above will be explained.<br>
Fig. 4 is a first operational diagram explaining the operation of the seat hinge structure according to the present invention.<br>
When the seat is opened, the second hinge member 23 attached to the bottom plate 15 swings on the hinge pin 25 as the center, as indicated by the arrow.<br>
At this time, as shown in the figure, the hinge pin 25 is pressed against an upper inner surface 33a of the long hole 33 provided in the first hinge member 21 by an elastic force of the plate spring 31.<br>
Fig. 5 is a second operational diagram explaining the operation of the seat hinge structure according to the present invention.<br>
When the driver is sitting in the seat, by the driver's weight acting on the seat, the bottom plate 15 of the seat lower part, and the hinge pin 25 via the second hinge member 23, both move downward against the elastic force of the plate spring 31, and the hinge pin 25 moves downward in the long hole 33 of the first hinge member 21, then the hinge pin 25 abuts against a lower inner surface 33b of the long hole 33, and the movement of the hinge pin 25 stops. (All the amount of movement of the hinge pin 25 at this time is ds. The phantom line is in the position before the downward movement of the bottom plate 15) . <br><br><br>
By this structure, the downward projection 52 of the second hinge member 23 pushes down the detection portion 58 of the seat switch 28, as indicated by the blank arrow, and the seat switch 28 is turned from off to on by the predetermined stroke amount of the detection portion 58. <br>
Further, when the driver has dismounted from the seat, the seat, the bottom plate 15, the second hinge member 23 and the hinge pin 25 move upward until the hinge pin 25 abuts against the upper inner surface 33a of the long hole 33 by the upward elastic force of the plate spring 31.<br>
As described above, the present invention is characterized in that in the seat hinge structure of the scooter vehicle 10 (See Fig. 1) , the first hinge member 21 is provided in the container box 12, the second hinge member 23 is attached on the seat 13 (See Fig. 1) side, and the second hinge member 23 is connected to the first hinge member 21 by the hinge pin 25, thereby the seat 13 can be opened/closed with respect to the container box 12.  The seat switch 28 to detect sitting in the seat 13 is attached to the first hinge member 21, the detection portion 58 of the seat switch 28 is faced with the second hinge member 23, to be brought in the non-detection/detection state in correspondence with the open/close status of the second hinge member 23. <br>
Conventionally, the container box, the attachment tongue, the plate spring, the hinge pin, the bracket and the seat frame<br><br><br>
are required to turn on/off the seat switch. On the other hand, in the present invention, only the first hinge member 21, the container box 12, the second hinge member 23 and the bottom plate 15 are required to turn on/off the seat switch 28.<br>
Accordingly, in the present invention, the number of parts to turn on/off the seat switch 28 can be reduced, and when these parts are assembled, the integration of manufacturing errors of the respective parts, i.e., the integration of difference between actual sizes of the respective parts and median values of dimensional tolerances of the respective parts can be reduced.  Thus the distance between the second hinge member 23 and the seat switch 28 can be easily maintained within a predetermined range.<br>
By this structure, the seat switch 28 can be normally actuated.<br>
Further, since it is not necessary to increase processing precision and assembly precision of the respective parts to manage the distance between the second hinge member 23 and the seat switch 28, i.e., the dimensions, the manufacturing cost of the seat hinge 14 can be reduced, and by extension, the manufacturing cost of the scooter vehicle 10 can be reduced. <br>
Note that in the present invention, the detection portion of the switch means is faced with the second hinge member, however, the invention is not limited to this arrangement.  It may be arranged such that the detection portion is faced with<br><br><br>
or pressed against a part of the seat (including the bottom plate) or the hinge pin to detect the downward movement of the seat.<br>
Further, the switch means is not limited to a touch switch but may be a non-contact switch (including a displacement sensor).<br>
[Effects of the Invention]<br>
The present invention exerts the following effects by the above-described structure.<br>
In the vehicle seat hinge structure in claim 1, as the switch means for detecting sitting in the seat is attached to the first hinge member, the detection portion of the switch means is faced with the second hinge member to be brought in the non-detection/detection state in correspondence with the open/close status of the second hinge member, the number of parts to turn on/off the switch means can be reduced, and when these parts are assembled, the integration of difference between actual sizes of the respective parts and median values of dimensional tolerances of the respective parts can be reduced.  Thus the distance between the second hinge member and the switch means can be easily maintained within a predetermined range, and the switch means can be normally actuated.  Further, since it is not necessary to increase processing precision and assembly precision of the respective parts to manage the distance between the second hinge member and the switch means, i.e., the dimensions, the manufacturing cost of the seat hinge can be reduced, and by extension, the<br><br>
manufacturing cost of the scooter vehicle can be reduced.<br>
