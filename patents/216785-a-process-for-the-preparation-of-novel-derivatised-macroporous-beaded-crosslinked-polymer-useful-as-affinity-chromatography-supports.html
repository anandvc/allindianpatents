				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a process for the preparation novejjmacroporous beaded crosslinked polymers useful as affinity chromatography supports. The invention more particularly relates to a process for the derivatisation of macroporous beaded crosslinked copolymers useful as affinity chromatography supports for purification of penicillin G acylase.<br>
Penicillin G acylase hydrolyses the linear amide bond present in the penicillins to form beta-lactam nucleus 6-amino penicillanic acid (6-APA) and corresponding side chain acid. The enzyme does not hydrolyse the cyclic amide bond, which forms the beta-lactam moiety. This property enables the use of penicillin G acylase in the production of 6-APA, which is an indespensible raw material for the preparation of semisynthetic penicillins such as ampicillin, amoxycillin, cloxacillin etc. Penicillin G acylase, therefore, is a biocatalyst of commercial importance.<br>
The enzyme is produced by fermentation and purified prior to immobilization. The substrates, side chain acid amides or their analogues are used as ligands for purification of penicillin G acylase. Either affinity or hydrophobic supports prepared by derivatisation of gels particularly agarose gels are used in purification of penicillin G acylase. Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology vol. 9, p. 421, 1984 describes a two step protocol involving hydrophobic chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose and ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. Purification of penicillion G acylase on Sepharose(agarose) activated with cyanogen bromide and derivatised with ampicillin, amoxycillin, phenylglycine, norleucine, octylamine, aniline, benzyl amine, phenylethyl amine, leucine, m-hydroxy aniline, p-hydroxy aniline, 2,4-dinitro aniline, tyrosine and<br><br>
tryptophan is dercribed in Hindustan Antibiotics Bulletin, vol. 31, p. 25, 1989; Biotechnology Letters, vol. 9, p. 539, 1987 and Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology vol. 9, p. 421, 1984.<br>
The use of aforesaid supports for purification of penicillin G acylase suffers from one or more of the following disadvantages: activation by using toxic chemicals like cyanogen bromide, bed compression, lower flow rates and attrition if used in batch mode.<br>
In our copending application No. 307/00 we have described and claimed a process for the preparation of macroporous beaded crosslinked copolymers. The copolymers have the following properties that are desired for a support for use in affinity chromatography such as:<br>
Presence of built-in glycidyl functional groups for binding of ligand molecules;<br>
Stable bed volume at varying conditions of pH and ionic strength;<br>
Uniform bead size and<br>
Resistance to attrition.<br>
Thus, the macroporous beaded crosslinked copolymers described and claimed in our copending application No. 307/00 can be derivatised and used as a support in affinity chromatography.<br>
Butylamine, hexylamine, octylamine, dodecylamine, phenylethylamine and benzylamine are either analogues of side chain of penicillin or are structures that possess degree of hydrophobicity in the range equivalent to the hydrophobicity of side chain moiety of penicillins. Primary amino group present in these molecules can react with the<br><br>
glycidyl functional group on the macroporous beaded crosslinked copolymers to form affinity supports.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of novel macroporous beaded copolymers.<br>
Another object is to provide a process for the preparation of affinity chromatography supports useful for the purification of penicillin G acylase wherein toxic chemicals are not used.<br>
Yet another object is to provide a process for the preparation of affinity chromatography supports useful for the purification of penicillin G acylase.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of novel derivatised macroporous beaded copolymer useful as affinity chromatography supports which comprises suspending macroporous beaded copolymers in a solution containing a ligand selected from amine in an organic solvent, shaking the suspension at an rpm in the range of 75 to 200, at a temperature in the range of 20 to 30°C for a period ranging upto 48 hours, isolating the beads from the reaction mixture by conventional methods, washing with water and drying the beads under vacuum.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the macroporous beaded crosslinked allyl glycidyl ether copolymers were prepared as described and claimed in our copending application No.NF-307/00.<br>
In	another embodiment of the invention, the ligand<br>
may	be	selected	from	butylamine,	hexylamine,<br>
octylamine, dodecylamine, phenylethylamine, benzylamine	and<br><br>
the ratio of the copolymer and the ligand may be in the range of 1:1 to 1:20.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the solvent for dissolution of the ligand may be selected from methanol, ethanol, isopropanol.<br>
The process of the present invention is described with reference to the following Examples, which are by way of illustration only and should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention, in any manner.<br>
