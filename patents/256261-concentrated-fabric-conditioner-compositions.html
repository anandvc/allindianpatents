CONCENTRATED FABRIC CONDITIONER COMPOSITIONS<br>
HINDUSTAN UNILEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br><br>
WO 2007/076909	PCT/EP2006/011474<br>
1<br>
Concentrated Fabric Conditioner Compositions Field of the Invention<br>
5  The present invention relates to concentrated fabric<br>
conditioner compositions and in particular to concentrated fabric conditioner composition which have desirable viscosity over a range of temperatures.<br>
0  Background of the Invention<br>
It is well known to provide liquid fabric conditioning compositions which soften in the rinse cycle.<br>
5  Such compositions comprise less than 7.5% by weight of<br>
softening active, in which case the composition is defined as "dilute", from 8% to about 30% by weight of active in which case the compositions are defined as "concentrated" or more than about 30% by weight of active, in which case the<br>
0  composition is defined as "super concentrated".<br>
Concentrated and super concentrated compositions are desirable since these require less packaging and are therefore environmentally more compatible than dilute or semi-dilute 5  compositions.<br>
A problem frequently associated with concentrated and super concentrated compositions,   as defined above, is that the product is not stable, especially when stored at high 0  temperatures.  Instability can manifest itself as a thickening of the product upon storage, even to the point that the product is no longer pourable.<br><br>
WO 2007/076909<br><br>
2<br><br>
PCTYEP2006/011474<br><br>
The problem of thickening upon storage is particularly apparent in concentrated and super concentrated fabric softening compositions comprising an ester-linked quaternary 5  ammonium fabric softening material having one or more fully saturate alkyl chains.<br>
A further problem known to affect concentrated and super concentrated and super concentrated fabric softening<br>
10  compositions comprising an ester-linked quaternary ammonium fabric softening material having one or more fully saturated alkyl chains is that the initial viscosity of a fully formulated, composition can be very high, up to a point that the composition is substantially unpourable.<br>
15<br>
However, it is desirable to use ester-linked compounds due to their inherent biodegradability and to use substantially fully saturated quaternary ammonium fabric softening compounds due to their excellent softening capabilities and because they are<br>
20  more stable to oxidative degradation (which can lead to malodour generation) than partially saturated or fully unsaturated quaternary ammonium softening compounds.<br>
Of the types of ester-linked quaternary ammonium materials 25  known, it is desirable to use those based on triethanolamone which produce at least some mono-ester linked component and at least some tri-ester linked component since the raw material has a low melting temperature which enables the manufacturing process of the composition to occur at low temperatures.  This 30  reduces difficulties associated With high temperature<br>
handling, transport and processing of the raw materials and compositions produced therefrom.<br><br>
WO 2007/076909<br><br>
3<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/011474<br><br>
The problem of high initial viscosity and visco-stability upon storage has previously been addressed in various ways.<br>
5  Typical approaches to achieving stable concentrate products with good viscostability usually involve the use of non-ionic co-surfactants or electrolyte.  Both approaches lead to thinning of the product which enables higher active level products to be manufactured. However, both can be problematic<br>
10  in that if excess salt or non-ionic is used, the long term<br>
stability of the product can be poor.  Salt acts to screen the repulsive electrostatic charges between the bilayers and between the particles.  Low levels of salt can be beneficial but high levels can lead to particle flocculation and<br>
15  thickening over time.  Furthermore, even the use of low levels can be restrictive in terms of processing since it prohibits high shear milling beneath the phase transition temperature and in terms of including other benefit ingredients since the effects of the salt and the benefit ingredient on flocculation<br>
20  can be additive.  Non-ionic surfactant is typically used to<br>
reduce the phase volume through changes to the microstructure. It changes the predominant form from micron sized liposomes to sub-micron discs or fragments.  However, excess non-ionic surfactant can lead to the formation of significant levels of<br>
25  free micelles in the continuous phase.  These micelles are believed to consist of non-ionic surfactant and solubilised components of the quaternary actives, giving the micelles and overall cationic charge.  Such microstructures are then thought to cause thickening via a depletion type interaction.<br>
30  Excess noni-ionic surfactant can also lead to thin undesirable products that are prone to separation on storage.<br><br>
WO 2007/076909<br><br>
4<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/011474<br><br>
Furthermore two other aspects are especially desirable to successful manufacture of such concentrated fabric conditioners.  First, the formulations must be robust to the typical range and levels of perfume components normally used 5  in fabric conditioner formulations.  Typical hardened tallow quaternary based fabric conditioners have limits to their perfume levels before instabilities begin to occur.  Not only that, but historically there are also a number of perfume components that have had to be removed from perfume<br>
10  compositions because they impact the behaviour of certain non-ionic formulation aids (see for example the effect that eugenol and linalool have on the cloud point of ethoxylated non-ionics; Tokuoka et al, J. Coll. and Int. Sci, Vo; . 152 (No. 2) p 402-409 (1992)..<br>
15<br>
Secondly, there needs to be a robust means of controlling product viscosity through conventional processing techniques such as milling.  One of the most desirable routes by which product viscosity is controlled is via high shear milling<br>
20  either towards the end or at the end of the process as it allows the operator more freedom to meet product specifications.  This in turn reduces the amount of out-of-specification product that has o be reworked.  Typically this approach has not been possible with concentrate products that<br>
25  do not contain non-ionic surfactant.  This is believed to be because low temperature milling in the absence of non-ionic surfactant is  though to cause the formation of highly viscous continuous lamellar phases.<br>
30  Hence it is desirable to have robust formulations that:<br>
i)   can accommodate a wide range of perfume materials<br><br>
WO 2007/076909<br><br>
5<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/011474<br><br>
ii)  do not need either salt or non-ionic to achieve the required liquid properties and<br>
iii)     meet the specification requirements simply 5  through a combination of formulation and processing.<br>
Furthermore, it is also desirable to use fully saturated ester quaternary ammonium actives because:<br>
i)   they are biodegradable and<br>
10	ii)  they do not oxidise and hence do not discolour,<br>
suffer from oxidative malodours or need antioxidants.<br>
It is known to employ fatty acids and/or fatty alcohols in fabric conditioner compositions comprising ester-linked 15  quaternary ammonium compounds (hereinafter called ester quats).<br>
US 4844823 discloses quat : fatty alcohol levels in the range of 6.5 : 1 to 2.8 : 1.<br>
20<br>
WO2003/22972 discloses a method of preparing concentrated and dilute formulations based on ester quat fatty alcohol with a ratio of monoester quat (MEQ) to fatty complexing agent of 1 : 5 to 5 : 1 by including the perfume on or above the phase<br>
25  transition temperature to give better stability. The<br>
compositions preferably contain non-ionic surfactant and all of the Examples contain non-ionic surfactant.<br>
WO2003/22970 discloses concentrated fabric conditioner 3 0  compositions based on ester quats in combination with fatty complexing agent and non-ionic surfactant.  The ratio of MEQ to fatty complexing agent is 5 : 1 to 1 : 5.<br><br>

WO2003/22971 discloses dilutes (less than 7.5%) compositions based on ester quats in combination with fatty complexing agent' for improved softening performance.  The ratio of MEQ to 5  fatty complexing agent is 5 : 1 to 1 : 5.<br>
WO2003/22967 discloses a method of thinning concentrated fabric conditioner compositions based on ester quats via the addition of a fatty complexing agent in the ratio of 2.93 : 1 10  to 1 : 5 (MEQ to fatty complexing agent).<br>
WO3003/057400 and WO2004/61066 disclose compositions comprising ester quats with polymer thickening agents.  All of -- the compositions disclosed used unsaturated ester quats which 15  can be manipulated more easily in concentrated formulations by use of an electrolyte.<br>
It has now been found that concentrated fabric conditioner compositions which are robust to high shear 20  processing/packaging, different perfume types and levels and possess desirable viscosity over a range of temperatures may be prepared from specific ingredients by mixing under high shear or by milling.<br>

Calculation of Mono-ester Linked Component of the Quaternary Ammonium Material<br>
The quantitative analysis of mono-ester linked component ot 5  the quaternary ammonium material is carried out through the use of Quantitative 13C NMR spectroscopy with inverse gated 1H decoupling scheme.<br>
The sample of known mass of the quaternary ammonium raw 10  material is first dissolved in a known volume of CDC13 along<br>
with a known amount of an assay material such as naphthalene.<br>
A 13C NMR spectrum of this solution is then recorded using both<br>
an inverse gated decoupling scheme and a relaxation agent.<br>
The inverse gated decoupling scheme is used to ensure that any 15  Overhauser effects are suppressed whilst the relaxation agent<br>
is used to ensure that the negative consequences of the long t1<br>
relaxation times are overcome (i.e. adequate signal-to-noise<br>
can be achieved in a reasonable timescale).<br>
2	0  The signal intensities of characteristic peaks of both the<br>
carbon atoms in the quaternary ammonium material and the naphthalene are used to calculate the concentration of the mono-ester linked component of the quaternary ammonium material.  In the quaternary ammonium material, the signal 25  represents the carbon of the nitrogen-methyl group on the quaternary ammonium head group.  The chemical shift of the nitrogen-methyl group varies slightly due to the different degree of esterification; characteristic chemical shifts for the mono-, di- and tri-ester links are 48.28, 47.97 and 47.76<br>
3	0  ppm respectively-  Any of the peaks due to the napthalene<br>
carbons that are free of interference from other components<br><br>
WO 2007/076909<br><br>
13<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/011474<br><br>
can. then be used to calculate the mass of mono-ester linked component present in the sample as follows:-<br>
5 <br>
where MassMQ = mass mono-ester linked quaternary ammonium material in mg/ml, massNaph = mass naphthalene in mg/ml, I = peak intensity, N = number of contributing nuclei and M = relative molecular mass.  The relative molecular mass of 10  naphthalene used is 128.17 and the relative molecular mass of the mono-ester-linked component of the quaternary ammonium material is taken as 526.<br>
The weight percentage of mono-ester linked quaternary ammonium 15  material in the raw material can thus be calculated:<br>
% of mono-ester linked quaternary ammonium material in the raw material = (massMQ / mass HT-TEA) X 100<br>
20  where mass HT-TEA = mass of the quaternary ammonium material and both mass MQ and mass HT-TEA are expressed as mg/ml.<br>

PCT/EP2006/011474<br><br>
It is also possible, though less desirable, for the compositions of the present invention to be used in industrial laundry operations, e.g. as a finishing agent for softening 5  new clothes prior to sale to consumers.<br>
Preparation<br>
The compositions of the invention may be prepared according to 10  any suitable method.<br>
In a first preferred method, the quaternary ammonium material, fatty complexing agent, and optionally the perfume are heated together until a co-melt is formed.  Water is then heated and<br>
15  the co-melt is added to water with stirring and the composition subjected to high shear e.g. melting. Alternatively, the perfume can be added hot after the active ingredients have been added or can be added at different stages of cooling after active addition.<br>

5)   Stenol 16-18L (ex. Cognis) and is hardened linear C16-C18 alcohol and is 100% active<br>
All samples were prepared in a 3Kg Vessel with recirculation 5  loop.  The process was as follows:<br>
Water is heated in the vessel to 70°C.  A molten premix of quaternary active and fatty alcohol was added over 3 minutes and stirred continuously for 4 minutes.  Jacket cooling to<br>
10  45°C and then the perfume was added.  Cooling to 31°C<br>
(ambient) .  A portion of each sample was removed from the vessel without any milling.  The remainder of the sample was milled.  The equivalent of one batch volume or sample was milled via a Janke &amp; Kunkel mill in the -recirculation loop.<br>
5<br>
The short term viscosity stability of the samples is reported in the following Tables 2 and 3 which show the ambient temperature stability of samples (all viscosities are measured at a shear rate of 10 6s"1 on a Haake RT20 Viscoscometer).<br>

The results from the unmilled samples clearly shows the benefits of HTTEAQ in that the base viscosities prior to 5  milling are much lower than those of any other quaternary (in<br><br>
WO 2007/076909<br><br>

fact Example C was too thick to measure).  Furthermore, unlike those of Example A they stay stable over the next 18 days of the test.<br>

Example C was still too thick to measure demonstrating that<br>
milling is unable to reduce the initial viscosity of the 10  product.  For Examples A', B and 1 the viscosities are reduced<br>
as a function of milling.  However, it is clear that Example A<br>
is unstable as the viscosity begins to rise again.<br>
Conversely, Example 1 in accordance with the invention remains<br>
stable for the duration of the test. 15<br>

As can be seen from Table 5 cold milling reduces the viscosity of all the Examples as expected.  There is no subsequent rising of viscosity after any length of time up to and beyond 6 months storage. 5<br>
Examples of the invention exhibit lower final viscosities and hence require less milling and thus shorter batch times to achieve target viscosity.<br>
10  The results show that stability of the formulations ±3  not dependent in any way of the level of perfume<br>

12.35% HTTEAQ<br>
1.5% Fatty Alcohol 20<br>
0.93% Perfume<br>
Minors preservative, dye, antifoam<br>
25  Water to 100%<br>
The HTTEAQ and fatty alcohol were as in the previous Examples. The formulation was prepared as in Example 1  and cold milled. Samples were taken off after 0, IBV/ 2B\, and 2 5BV cold 30  mi11ing.<br><br>
