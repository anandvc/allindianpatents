METHODS AND APPARATUS FOR PERFORMING FAST MODE DECISIONS IN VIDEO CODECS<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Claim of Priority under 35 U.S.C. ยง119<br>
[0001]	The present Application for Patent claims priority to Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/552,156 entitled Low-Complexity Intra/lnter Mode Decision<br>
for Video Coding filed March 11, 2004, and assigned to the assignee hereof and<br>
hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein<br>
FIELD	<br>
[0002]	This invention  relates generally to the field of digital image<br>
processing, and more specifically, to the field of video encoding and decoding.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003]	The transmission of video over communication channels, either<br>
wireless or wired, has become possible with developments that improve the<br>
data capacity of communication channels. Moreover, Various standards have<br>
been established to facilitate the transmission and reception of video using<br>
electronic devices with digital storage media, such as mobile telephones,<br>
personal computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and other electronic<br>
devices. Examples of some video standards that enable the transmission of<br>
video images over communication channels are Moving Pictures Expert Group-<br>
1 (MPEG-1), MPEG-2, and MPEG-4, International Telecommunications Union<br>
(ITU) H.263, H.264, which were promulgated by the International Organization<br>
for Standardization (ISO). Another standards-forming body of note is the Audio<br>
Video Coding Standard Working Group of China (AVS).<br>
[0004]	In order to provide such video services, the original images must<br>
be compressed in a manner that will not exceed the data capacity of a communication channel. For example, in circuit-switched landline telephone systems, the communication channel is physically limited to 64 kbits/second. However, this bit rate is inadequate for the purpose of transmitting a video stream in its raw format with acceptable perceptual quality.    However, the<br><br>
WO 2005/088975	PCT/US2005/008044<br>
3<br>
manner in which the compression is performed should  not sacrifice the perceptual quality of images at a receiver.<br>
[0005]	In order to balance these two competing requirements,  many<br>
video encoders use a transform coding technique combined with a motion<br>
compensation technique to compress the original video sequence.     The<br>
transform coding technique is used to remove spatial redundancy while the<br>
motion compensation technique is used to remove temporal redundancy.<br>
[0006]	It is widely acknowledged  by those of skill  in the art that<br>
compression of original images using transform coding and motion compensation techniques is computationally intensive. The number of instructions needed to perform the compression, as measured in MIPS (million instructions per second), is substantial and may consume hardware resources that could otherwise be allocated to other applications. Since the compression is often expected to be performed within small, portable electronic devices, hardware resources to perform these compression techniques may be limited. Hence, there is a present need to reduce the MIPS or hardware requirements of video encoders without unduly degrading the perceived quality of the video image.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0007]	Methods and apparatus are presented herein to address the<br>
above stated needs. In one aspect, a method is presented for making a coding mode decision for a current macroblock, the method comprising: evaluating a plurality of coding modes, each associated with a neighboring macroblock; and 		selecting the coding mode for the current macroblock based upon the evaluation of the plurality of coding modes.<br>
[0008]	In another aspect, apparatus is presented in a video codec for<br>
performing a mode decision for a current macroblock, the apparatus comprising: at least one memory element; and at least one processing element communicatively coupled to the at least memory! element and configured to implement a set of instructions stored on the at least one memory element, the set of instructions for: evaluating a plurality of coding modes, each associated<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0016]	The newer generation of video compression standards exploits a<br>
phenomenon of video in order to reduce the encoding complexity. Video is merely a series of still images, called frames, which run quickly and successively in time. It may be observed that some frames of video exhibit spatial similarity and correlation while some frames of video also exhibit temporal similarity with neighboring frames. Hence, most video compression standards perform different coding techniques for  "Intra-coded frames," which are frames whose spatial redundancy is explored, and "Inter-coded frames," whose temporal redundancy is explored. Predictive coding is typically used for frames that contain either spatial or temporal redundancy. For illustrative ease, Intra-coded frames will be referred to herein as l-frames and Inter-coded frames will be referred to herein as P-frames. In order to encode l-frames and P-frames, a typical video codec will work upon macroblocks of an image frame, rather than the image frame in its entirety. Using standard size measurements<br><br>
WO 2005/088975<br><br>
5<br><br>
PCT/US2005/008044<br><br>
from the Quarter Common Intermediate Format (QCIF), a block comprises an<br>
8x8 group of pixels and a macroblock comprises a 16x16 group of pixels.  A QCIF frame of 176x144 pixels has 99 macroblocks.  For illustrative ease, the <br>
Intra-coded macroblocks will be referred to herein as "Intra-MB" and the macroblocks coded using motion compensation and temporal prediction will be referred to herein as "Inter-MB."<br>
[0017]	FIG. 1A is a flowchart illustrating Intra-coding.   At step 100, the<br>
pixels within an Intra-MB undergo a transform coding. At step 110, the coefficients of the transform are then quantized. At step 120, the quantized coefficients are then losslessly encoded for transmission. Since the transform coding technique standardized in MPEG-4 is the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), the embodiments are described herein using the DCT. However, one of skill in the art would recognize that the embodiments are not limited to DCT, but can be utilized in video encoders using other transform coding techniques. The DCT is frequently chosen as the transform code for video coding standards since a high amount of energy can be packed in a relatively small number of coefficients.<br>
[0018]	The decoding of Intra-MBs involves a reversal of the process in<br>
FIG. 1A, in that received information is losslessly decoded, de-quantized, and then transformed using an inverse of the transform used at step 100.<br><br>
[0019]<br><br>
The encoding process for Intra-MBs<br><br>
is relatively straightforward<br><br>
and not computationally intensive. Coding Intra-MBs requires a large number of<br><br>
memory and transmission<br>
bits, which requires a large amount of storage<br>
bandwidth.    Hence, this encoding process consumes memory, rather than<br>
processor cycles.   To encode the entire stream of video according to the<br>
method illustrated in FIG. 1A would be inefficient, since the transmission<br>
channel would be unable to carry the total number of bits required to convey<br>
multiple frames per second.<br>
[0020]	In contrast to l-frames, P-frames further explore and reduce<br>
temporal redundancy from frame to frame, which can be used along with spatial<br>
redundancy reduction to predictively reduce the number of bits that needs to be<br>
stored in memory.  In a video recording of low motion activity, the difference in<br>
pixels between one frame and the next is small if the motion between the two<br>
frames is compensated.    Since there is little or no motion after motion <br>
WO 2005/088975<br><br>
6<br><br>
PCT/US2005/008044<br><br>
compensation, it is possible to use information about a previous and/or future<br>
frame to predict what the current frame will show.   Rather than encode and<br>
transmit all the bits of the current frame, the residual of a prediction of what the<br>
current frame may contain is encoded and transmitted, which reduces the<br>
number of bits that need to be stored or transmitted.  However, the encoding of<br>
P-frames is computationally expensive due to the number of estimation<br>
calculations that are needed to estimate the motion.<br>
[0021]	FIG. 1B is a flowchart illustrating the encoding of Inter-MBs.   At<br>
step 140, the translational motion between blocks of pixels within a P-frame is <br>
determined  using  motion  estimation techniques. The motion is usually represented by a motion vector.  Groups of blocks, i.e., macroblocks, may be <br>
compared in order to determine a plurality of motion vectors for each P-frame.<br>
Note that the search for motion vectors is computationally expensive since a<br>
search for an optimum motion vector is performed for each block. At step 150,<br>
the motion vectors are used to predict a motion compensated macroblock. At<br>
step 160, the motion compensated macroblock is substracted from a current <br>
macroblock to form a  residual  macroblock.  At step 170, the  macroblock undergoes a transformation, the coefficients of the transformed residual macroblock are quantized, and then losslessly encoded.   Since the<br>
residual macroblock carries less information than the macroblocks of the<br>
original P-frame, there is a reduction in the amount of bits that need to be<br>
transmitted to a receiving party.<br>
[0022]	Typically, a video codec will select every Nth frame to encode as<br>
an l-frame and the rest to be encoded as P-frames. This duration between I-<br>
frames is referred to as an "Intra-period." The presence of an l-frame acts as a<br>
reference to refresh the P-frames. Within the designated P-frames, the video<br>
codec will also occasionally select certain macroblocks to be Infra-coded, which<br>
are not encoded using temporal prediction.<br>
[0023]	FIG. 2 is a block diagram of the encoding performed by a  conventional video codec in an electronic device. The signal path through the <br>
codec depends upon whether the input image signal is an l-frame or a P-frame,<br>
or alternatively, whether a macroblock within a P-frame is an Intra-MB or an<br>
Inter-MB.   For illustrative ease, the encoding of |a P-frame will be described<br>
hereafter using the terminology of Intra-MBs and Inter-MBs.  If the input image<br><br>
WO 2005/088975<br><br>
PCT/US2005/008044<br><br>
7 <br>
signal is an Intra-MB, then a switch 200 establishes  a signal path through the DCT block 202, the quantizer block 204, and then the lossless coding block <br>
206.    The signal leaves the video codec for further processing within the<br>
electronic device.    An example of further processing is the coding at the<br>
bitstream encoding block 208, which encodes the signal in an appropriate <br>
transmission format for the transmission medium.<br>
[0024]	Although the Intra-MB coding is finished at block 204, the Intra-MB  needs to be used as a reference MB for the Inter-MB coding. Hence, the quantization values that exit the quantizer block 204 also enter a decoding portion 210 of the video codec. The decoding portion 210 comprises a de-quantizer block 212 and an inverse-DCT block 213. The quantization values pass through the de-quantizer block 212 and then the inverse-DCT block 213 to reconstruct the Intra-MB, which is used to refresh the buffer 222 that is accessed by the motion compensation block 230 and the motion estimation block 232. The path through the DCT block 202, the quantizer block 204, and then the lossless coding block 206 is also applicable for encoding the residual MBs generated by the Inter-MB encoding.<br>
[0025]	If the input image signal is an Inter-MB, then the switch 200<br>
establishes a new signal path, which includes the motion compensation block 230 and the motion estimation block 232. The motion estimation block 232 receives the current Inter-MB and a set of stored reference MBs from the buffer 222 and performs a search through a plurality of motion vectors for the motion vector that best describes the motion between the current Inter-MB and the reference MB. Note that the reference MB is the stored reconstructed pixels of previous or future MBs that were output from the decoding portion 210 of the video codec. The motion vector is then input into the motion compensation block 230.<br>
[0026]	The motion compensation block 230 receives the motion vector<br>
from the motion compensation block 230 and the reference MB from the buffer 222 in order to generate a new predictive MB from the reference MB, i.e., a predictive version of the current Inter-MB. When Inter-MB coding takes place, the reference MB should be updated. Hence, the switch 240 is "on," so that the predictive MB is added by summing element 220 to the decoded residual MB<br><br>
WO 2005/088975<br><br>
8<br><br>
PCT/US2005/008044<br><br>
that is output from the decoding portion 210. The Result is stored as a new reference MB in buffer 222.<br>
[0027]	The predictive MB from the motion compensation block 230 is<br>
subtracted from the current Inter-MB by subtraction element 224 in order to form a residual MB. The residual MB is then processed as described above for Intra-MB encoding. The quantized, transformed residual MB is further passed through the decoding portion 210 so that the residual MB may be used by the video codec to update the reference MB stored in the buffer 222, which in turn may be accessed by the motion compensation block 230 and motion estimation block 232 for encoding MBs of future or past frames. Note that predictive coding techniques may be bi-directional, in that past information may be used to predict the current frame or future information may be used to predict the current frame.<br>
[0028]	The encoding of the Intra-MBs may also use spatial prediction.<br>
The encoding of the Inter-MBs employs temporal prediction. The problem with<br><br>
the conventional video codec design of FIG. 2 is<br><br>
that non predictive coding<br><br>
consumes too many memory resources and predictive coding consumes too<br>
many processing resources. If one of skill in the art decided that lowering the<br>
MIPS requirement is needed to perform other tasks, then increasing the number<br>
of l-frames or Intra-MBs is a possible solution, which is implemented by<br>
decreasing the intra-period value N. However, this solution is flawed because<br>
the demand for memory resources would correspondingly increase. Moreover,<br>
the overall transmission rate of the video images over a communication channel<br>
would increase since more bits are needed to convey spatial information as<br>
compared to predictive information. For wireless applications, such as video<br>
streaming over cellular phones, the increased transmission bits could result in a<br>
degraded synthesized image signal if the wireless or landline communication<br>
channel cannot accommodate the increased transmission bit rate.<br>
[0029]	Conversely,  if one of skill  in the art decided that memory<br>
resources were limited, then one solution is to perform more temporally predictive encoding, which is implemented by increasing the intra-period value N. However, temporally predictive encoding requires more cycles from the processing elements which, if loaded past a maximum threshold, will drop frame processing tasks for tasks with higher priorities.   Dropped frames would then<br><br>
WO 2005/088975<br><br>
9<br><br>
PCT/US2005/008044<br><br>
degrade the quality of the synthesized image. In addition, the quality of the<br>
synthesized signal would also degrade whenever high speed activities occur<br>
within the images because the use of too many predictively encoded frames<br>
could cause a failure in the motion estimation ability of the video codec.<br>
[0030]	Hence, an important consideration  in operation of video codecs is the design for determining whether a P-frame MB should be coded as <br>
an Intra-MB or an Inter-MB, in addition to making a best prdiction mode determination between macroblock size choices.   In H.264, for example, nine <br>
coding modes for the 4x4 block size and four coding modes for the 16x16MB<br>
exist for Intra-coding.    For Inter-MBs, an important consideration in some<br>
advanced codecs, such as H.264, is also to make a best prediction mode<br>
determination between MB size choices.   H.264, for example, supports four<br>
coding types, including block sizes of 16x16,16x8, 8x16, and 8x8 for Inter-MBs.<br>
[0031]	Traditionally, video codecs made coding mode decisions based<br>
upon measurements that are performed upon each MB. Predictive coding involving motion estimation and spatial estimation is very computationally intensive in video codecs because they employ exhaustive searches through multiple coding modes before an optimal mode is selected that achieves the best compression efficiency.<br>
[0032]	FIG. 3 is an example of a coding mode decision algorithm. At step<br>
300, extensive computations are performed to determine a distortion metric or quality measure for each permissible coding mode for each macro-block within a frame by a Motion Estimation/Spatial Estimation (ME/SE) engine. At step 310, the best coding mode is selected for the MB based on the distortion metrics/quality measures of the permissible coding modes. One such quality measure is the Sum of Absolute Difference (SAD) value, which is a distortion metric based upon the absolute difference between a current MB and a MB in a previous frame. Another measure can be the number of bits spent on coding motion vectors and residuals in order to find the coding mode that yields minimum cost.<br>
[0033]	If the MB is an Intra-MB, then the program flow proceeds to step<br>
320. In H. 264, for example, there are nine coding modes for a 4x4 Intra-MB and four coding modes for a 16x16 Intra-MB. For a 4x4 Intra-MB, the nine coding modes are vertical prediction, horizontal prediction, DC prediction,<br><br>
WO 2005/088975<br><br>
10<br><br>
PCT/US2005/008044<br><br>
diagonal-down-left prediction, diagonal-down-right prediction, vertical-right<br>
prediction, horizontal-down prediction, vertical-left prediction, and horizontal-up<br>
prediction. For a 16x16 Intra-MB, the four coding modes are vertical prediction,<br>
horizontal prediction, DC prediction, and plane prediction.<br>
[0034]	If the MB is determined to be an Inter-MB at step 310, then the <br>
encoded MB is losslessly<br>
program flow proceeds to step 330, whereupon the Inter-MB is predictively<br>
encoded. In H.264, there are four coding types associated with block sizes of<br>
16x16,16x8, 8x16, and 8x8.<br>
[0035]	After either step 320 or step 330, the<br>
decision is made after the<br>
encoded in a format appropriate for transmission.<br>
[0036]	Note that at step 310, the coding mode<br>
motion estimation (ME) and/or the spatial estimation (SE) searches. This<br>
coding mode decision is implemented by searching through all the possible<br>
coding modes exhaustively, and a selection is made after all searches. For this<br>
reason, the decision algorithm is categorized as a "post-mode" decision<br>
algorithm. Since the post-mode decision algorithm requires ME and/or the SE<br>
searches, there is a significant amount of hardware or Digital Signal Processor<br>
(DSP) resources that must be consumed in order to perform the algorithm.<br>
[0037]	The embodiments that are presented herein are for reducing the<br>
computational complexity for performing a coding mode decision by reducing<br>
the dependence of the coding mode decision on exhaustive SE and ME<br>
searches. In one embodiment, a method and apparatus for pre-determining the<br>
prediction modes for a proportion of the MBs is presented. This embodiment<br>
may be referred to as the pre-mode decision algorithm. In one aspect of this<br>
embodiment, past and/or currently available prediction modes are analyzed to<br>
determine a prediction mode for a current MB. In another embodiment, the<br>
method and apparatus for pre-determining the prediction modes are combined<br>
with a post-mode decision to create a hybrid mode decision algorithm.<br>
[0038]	The underlying basis for spatial estimation and motion estimation<br>
is the strong spatial correlation within a particular frame and the strong temporal and spatial correlation between successive frames. The embodiments herein are based on the premise that the best prediction mode for a current MB, as determined by the aforementioned post-mode decision algorithm, will also be strongly correlated to the best prediction modes of other MBs.  For example, a<br><br>
WO 2005/088975<br><br>
PCT/US2005/008044<br><br>
11 <br>
relatively flat area in a frame may cause a post-mode decision algorithm to<br>
designate a group of MBs as Inter-MBs of dimension 16x16, another group of<br>
MBs to be designated as Inter-MBs of dimension 8x8, and another group of<br>
MBs to be designated at Intra-MBs of dimension 4x4.   Hence, a MB tends to<br>
attract   the   same   coding   mode   designation   as   other   MBs   that   are<br>
spatially/temporally close.<br>
[0039]	FIG. 4A is a block diagram illustrating an embodiment of a pre-<br>
mode decision algorithm.    At step 400, the video codec evaluates the coding<br>
modes of a selection of spatially and/or temporally close MBs, i.e., neighboring<br>
MBs, from either a past and/or current frame.  At step 410, the codec uses a<br>
decision criteria to determine the coding mode of the current MB.<br>
[0040]	FIG. 4B is a block diagram of a simple decision criteria that may<br>
be implemented in an embodiment of the pre-mode decision algorithm.   The<br>
already formulated mode decisions 420a, 420b, . . , 420n for neighboring MBs,<br>
from either a past and/or current frame, are input to a logic that performs a<br>
simple majority vote selection 430.   The mode decision for the current MB is<br>
based upon the outcome of the majority vote of the already formulated mode<br>
decisions 420a, 420b,.... 420n.<br>
[0041]	In one aspect of the embodiment, the selection of the already<br>
formulated mode decisions 420a, 420b, ... , 420n may be performed using an<br>
interlaced pattern, so that mode decisions from a past frame may be used with<br>
mode decisions from the current frame as candidates for the majority vote<br>
selection logic 430.   In other words, as an illustrative example, if the MB is<br>
located at position (x,y) in a frame T, then mode decisions of MBs at positions<br>
(x-1, y), (x+1, y), (x, y-1), and (x, y+1) from frame T, and mode decisions of MBs<br>
at positions (x-1, y-1), (x+1, y-1), (x-1, y+1), and (x+1, y+1) from frame T-1<br>
could be selected as input into the majority vote selection logic.<br>
[0042]	In another aspect of the embodiment, an adaptive interlaced<br>
pattern, rather than a fixed interlaced pattern may be used to select candidate<br>
MBs.   Moreover, different interlacing patterns may be used whenever certain <br>
criteria are met.  For example, only MBs that meet certain confidence level or <br>
exceed certain threshold(s) are used for the pre-mode decision. Such MBs are<br>
not necessarily located in a fixed pattern.<br><br>
WO 2005/088975<br><br>
12<br><br>
PCT/US2005/008044<br><br>
[0043]	In another aspect, the majority vote selection logic may take the<br>
modes from all candidate MBs as input and weight each mode according to a weighting factor. For example, the inverse of the spatial and/or temporal distance of a candidate MB from the current MB may be used as a weighting factor to weigh a mode in the majority vote selection.<br>
[0044]	The pre-mode decision embodiment described above may be<br>
improved upon in order to prevent inaccurate mode decision from propagating.<br>
The pre-mode decision algorithm may be combined with a post-mode decision<br>
algorithm to create a hybrid-mode decision embodiment.<br>
[0045]	FIG. 5A is a block diagram illustrating an embodiment of a hybrid-<br>
mode decision algorithm.<br>
[0046]	At step 500, a pre-mode decision is performed for select MBs.<br>
The pre-mode decision process is described above for FIGS. 4A and 4B. The<br>
methodology for selecting which MBs undergo the pre-mode decision process is<br>
described further in relation to FIG. 5B.    At step 510, the ME/SE engine is <br>
performs both exhaustive ME and SE searches for MBs for which pre-mode <br>
decisions were not made. At step 520, the best coding mode is selected for the<br>
MBs that underwent the motion and spatial estimation searches.<br>
[0047]	If the MB is an Intra-MB, then the program flow proceeds to step<br>
530.<br>
[0048]	If the MB is determined to be an Inter-MB, then the program flow<br>
proceeds to step 540, whereupon the Inter-MB is predictively encoded.<br>
[0049]	After either step 530 or step 540, the encoded MB is losslessly<br>
encoded at step 550 in a format appropriate for trans transmission.<br>
[0050]	FIG. 5B is a diagram that shows how an interlaced pattern may be<br>
applied to the hybrid mode decision embodiment of FIG. 5A to determine<br>
whether the coding mode of a MB will be determined using a pre-mode decision <br>
process or a post-mode decision process.<br>
[0051]	FIG. 5B is an example of an interlaced pattern where the current <br>
MB (marked with a dotted X) is in a position where a pre-mode decision  process will be made.  The pre-mode decision will be based on the mode decisions already made for the MBs on the shaded positions.  In this instance, the pre-mode decision will be based on three candidates that were determined using the post mode decision process for the current frame T and a previous frame T- <br>
WO 2005/088975<br><br>
13<br><br>
PCT/US2005/008044<br><br>
1. Hence, interlaced patterns may be used to determine whether a pre-mode or<br>
a post-mode decision will be made, and the patterns may also be used to<br>
determine which candidates to use in the pre-mode decision process.<br>
[0052]	The interlaced pattern specifically illustrated in FIG. 5B is only one<br>
example of the interlaced patterns that may be used in the hybrid mode decision embodiment. The interlaced patterns discussed under the pre-mode decision embodiment may be applied for this embodiment. An adaptive or a fixed interlaced pattern may be used to select MBs to undergo pre-mode decisions rather than post-mode decisions. Moreover, different interlacing patterns may be used whenever certain criteria are met. Note that the use of interlaced patterns of any sort allows the codec to control the number of pre-mode decisions made as opposed to the number of post-mode decisions. If the processing resources are low, for example, when running on the electronic device housing the codec, reduce the number of post-mode decisions, which correspondingly reduces the number of exhaustive computational searches for the best coding modes. The use of an interlacing pattern that requires fewer post-mode decisions would be useful in this instance.<br>
[0053]	In another aspect of the hybrid mode embodiment, the decision as<br>
to whether a MB undergoes a pre-mode or post-mode decision may be based<br>
upon input from a Feature Extraction Unit (Block Network Feedback (Block 570 of FIG. 5A) or upon FIG. 5A). For example, the embodiments may be implemented to accommodate video streams with differing image sizes, bit rates and/or frame rates. In yet another aspect, the embodiments may be implemented to accommodate variable transmission channels that are prone to channel errors. In yet another aspect, the embodiments may be implemented to accommodate a user-defined quality measure. In yet another aspect, the embodiments may be implemented to accommodate a lack of hardware resources. As indicated herein, the embodiments may be used to accommodate many different needs that may originate from different portions of the electronic device that houses the video codec. Configuration signals may originate at any portion of the electronic device or alternatively, the configuration signals may originate from a network that is accessed by the electronic device.<br><br>

PCT/US2005/008044<br><br><br><br>
[0054]<br><br>
Different embodiments are possible wherein the hybrid  mode<br><br><br><br>
decision may occur at different levels of the encoding<br><br>
process. In particular, the.<br><br>
pre-mode decision may be performed at three different levels. In one embodiment, the pre-mode decision only determines whether a MB should be either intra- or inter- coded, and then leave the submode decision to further searches by the ME/SE engine and the post-mode decision process. In H.264, a submode may refer to one of the nine 4x4 Intra-coding modes, or of the four 16x16 Intra-coding modes, or of the 16x16, 16x8, 8x16, 8x8 Inter-coding modes. In another embodiment, the pre-mode decision first determines one of<br>
the following modes for the current MB:   intra-4x4 , intra โ 16x 16, inter โ 16x16, inter-16x8, inter-8x16, and inter-8x8, so that the post-mode decision process is only implemented upon the possible submodes of the selected mode. In another embodiment, the pre-mode decision first determines a particular submode, such as, for example, intra-4x4 vertical prediction, so that further SE or ME searches need only to be performed for one particular mode that is already pre-determined.<br>
[0055]	The embodiments that are described herein are for reducing the<br>
computational complexity of the coding process for P-frames and/or l-frames and/or bi-directional frames (B-frames). Reducing the number of exhaustive SE and/or ME searches by exploiting the correlation between coding mode decisions will allow a reduction in the computational complexity (DSP MIPS or hardware power) requirements for the video coding without unduly degrading the perceived quality of the video.<br>
[0056]	Hardware, such as a digital signal processor or other processing<br>
element and memory elements may be configured to execute instructions for performing the method steps described above. Such hardware may be easily implemented in any of the currently existing video codecs compliant to the standards of MPEG, ITU-T H.26x, or AVS.<br>
