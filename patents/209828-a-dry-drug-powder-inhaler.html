Shivani Kishore Motiram, Kopran Limited, Parijat House, 1076 Dr E Moses Road, Worli, Mumbai 400 018, Maharashtra, India, an Indian National<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention  and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br><br>
2 OCT 2004<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a dry drug powder inhaler.<br>
Dry drug powder inhaler delivers a single dose of a drug  or combination of drugs contained in a capsule at a time in the treatment and/or control of lung disorders or diseases like asthma  or reversible obstructive airway disease (ROAD), bronchiectasis, chronic obstructive disease (COPD) or emphysema.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
One of the dry drug powder inhalers is food grade plastic moulded and consists of an aspiration chamber consisting of a hollow cylindrical base provided with a hollow cylindrical closure. The base is provided with a tubular capsule holder and an arc shaped slot at the bottom at opposite sides thereof. The slot is long and extends through half the bottom of the base. The base is also provided with a collar at the edge of its mouth corresponding to the side where the slot is provided at the bottom thereof. The closure consists of a meshed portion provided across it at an intermediate position thereof. The lower part of the closure is adapted to detachably rotatably push or slide fit into the base and is provided with a<br><br><br>
cutter rib internally along its length. The upper part of the closure defines a step at the bottom thereof adapted to abut the collar at the edge of the mouth of the base. A stopper protruding down from the step at the bottom of the upper part of the closure abuts the collar at the edge of the mouth of the base and restricts the rotational movement of the closure in the base. The tip of the closure is formed into a mouthpiece. During rotation of the closure in the base a capsule containing drug powder inserted in the capsule holder is cut by the cutter rib to release the drug powder which is inhaled through the mouth piece. In such an inhaler the capsule holder is exposed and, therefore, for reasons of damage or contamination of the capsule, it is not advisable to carry the inhaler with a capsule inserted in the capsule holder. This is very disadvantageous especially in an emergency when a capsule has to be first found and inserted in the capsule holder and then cut to release the drug powder for inhalation. Valuable time elapses in the exercise which may lead to complications. Also there is a possibility of one forgetting to carry or misplacing or losing the container containing the capsules while moving from place to place. Such a situation can be all the more dangerous in an emergency. The meshed portion is not detachable or easily accessible. Therefore, cleaning of the meshed portion is not easy. Cleaning of the meshed portion is very important in that clogging of the meshed portion not<br><br><br>
only makes inhalation ineffective but also effortful. Contamination of the meshed portion with germs or foreign particles may also lead to aggravation of the medical condition or other ailments. In case of any damage to the meshed portion the whole inhaler will have to be discarded. Due to the slot at the bottom of the base being long, there is also possibility of large number of drug particles coming in contact with the slot and falling out therethrough under the weight thereof. This not only results in wastage of the valuable drug but also insufficient dosage being inhaled and the medical condition being improperly treated or controlled.<br>
Another dry drug powder inhaler is food grade transparent plastic moulded and consists of an aspiration chamber consisting of a cup shaped base provided with a cup shaped closure. The base is provided with a skirt depending down from the bottom thereof defining a step externally against the bottom and a cutter rib along the inner side wall. The closure is detachably rotatably push or slide fitted over the base with the edge of the closure abutting against the step externally at the bottom of the base. The closure consists of a meshed portion surrounded by a mouth piece at the top thereof.    The  closure  also consists  of a tubular capsule holder and air<br><br><br>
inlets outside the mouthpiece at the top thereof. Due to the capsule holder of this inhaler is also exposed, it suffers from the drawbacks discussed earlier. The meshed portion is not easily accessible for cleaning and in case of any damage to the meshed portion the entire inhaler will have to be discarded. Besides inflow of air into the aspiration chamber through the air inlets and inhalation of drug powder with the air in the aspiration chamber are in opposite directions. Therefore, great effort is required to suck in the drug powder during inhalation and inhalation is effortful. Inhalation may be all the more  difficult in an acute state of the medical condition.<br>
There is described in our Indian Patent Application No 966/MUM/2000 a food grade transparent plastic moulded dry drug powder inhaler. It comprises an aspiration chamber comprising a cup shaped base provided with a cup shaped closure. The base is provided with a skirt depending down from the bottom thereof and defining a step externally against the bottom and a cutter rib along the inner sidewall thereof. The closure is detachably rotatably slide or push fitted over the base with the edge of the mouth thereof abutting against the step externally. The closure is provided with a meshed portion surrounded by a mouthpiece at the top thereof. The closure is also provided with a tubular capsule holder and air<br><br><br>
inlets outside the mouthpiece at the top thereof. The inhaler includes a capsule canister detachably fitted to the skirt and a detachable protective cap fitted to the mouthpiece. Besides the inhaler includes gripping knurls provided thereon. The meshed portion is circular and the mouthpiece defines a tapered circular profile. The cutter rib extends above the edge of the base into the closure and the tubular capsule holder is provided with a tapered circular hole. In the case of this inhaler one of the main advantages is that it is possible to store capsules conveniently in the canister and use them as and when required. The capsule holder is, however, exposed and it is not advisable to carry the inhaler with a capsule inserted in the capsule holder for reasons of damage or contamination of the capsule. Besides, in case of any damage to the meshed member the entire inhaler will have to be thrown out.<br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
An object of the invention is to provide a dry drug powder inhaler whose capsule holder is fully covered so as to facilitate carrying of a capsule containing drug inserted in the capsule holder thereof.<br><br><br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a dry drug powder inhaler whose meshed portion is detachable but fully covered so as to facilitate cleaning and maintenance of the meshed portion and easy replacement thereof and to prevent foreign bodies and germs entering the meshed portion.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a dry drug powder inhaler which reduces inhalation effort and makes inhalation easy and convenient.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
According to the invention there is provided a dry drug powder inhaler which is food grade transparent plastic moulded and consists of a cup shaped base provided with a plurality of spaced air inlet holes at the bottom thereof, the inner peripheries of the air inlet holes being formed with externally tapered tubular projections, the base being further provided with a cutter rib internally along the length thereof and a step externally adjacent the mouth thereof a ring member provided     with   knurls   externally and   a   meshed portion     internally<br><br><br>
across it at an intermediate position thereof and having formed therein a tubular capsule holder, one part of the ring member being detachably rotatably push or slide fitted over the mouth of the base and abutting the step provided externally adjacent the mouth of the base and a dish shaped closure provided with a step externally adjacent the mouth thereof, the closure being detachably rotatably push or slide fitted in the other part of the ring member with the step externally adjacent the mouth of the closure abutting the edge of the other part of the ring member, the tip of the closure being formed into a mouth piece.<br>
The   following is a   detailed description     of  the invention with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which<br>
Fig 1 is elevation of a dry drug powder inhaler according to an embodiment of the invention;<br>
Fig 2 is section at A-A in  Fig 1;<br><br><br>
Fig 3   is crosssection   of the cup shaped base of the inhaler of Fig.l;<br>
Fig 4 is enlarged view at X in  Fig 3;<br>
Fig 5 is bottom view of the cup shaped base of the inhaler of Fig<br><br>
Fig 6 is crosssection of the ring member  of the inhaler  of Fig 1;<br>
Fig 7   is top view  of the ring member of the inhaler   of Fig 1;<br>
Fig 8 is top view of the dish shaped closure of the inhaler of Fig 1; and<br>
Fig 9   is section at B-B in Fig 8.<br>
As illustrated in figures 1 to 9 of the accompanying drawings the dry drug powder inhaler 1 consist of a cup shaped base 2 provided with a plurality of   spaced air inlet   holes 3 at the bottom thereof.   The inner<br><br><br>
peripheries of the air inlet holes are formed with externally tapered tubular projections 4 (Figs 3 and 4). The base is further provided with a cutter rib 5 internally along the length thereof and a step 6 externally adjacent the mouth thereof (Figs 3 and 5). 7 is a ring member provided with knurls 8 externally and a meshed portion 9 internally across it at an intermediate position thereof (Figs 1, 6 and 7). Perforations in the meshed portion are marked 9a. The meshed portion is having formed therein a tubular capsule holder 10. One part of the ring member is marked 11 and is detachably rotatably push or slide fitted over the mouth of the base and is abutting the step 6 provided externally adjacent the mouth of the base. 12 is a dish shaped closure provided with a step 13 externally adjacent the mouth thereof (Figs 1, 2, 8 and 9). The closure is detachably rotatably push or slide fitted in the other part 14 of the ring member with the step 13 externally adjacent the mouth of the closure abutting the edge of the other part of the ring member. The tip of the closure is formed into a mouth piece marked 15. The inhaler is moulded of food grade transparent plastic such as  polycarbonate.<br>
On rotating the ring member along with the closure in the base after inserting a capsule in the capsule holder the capsule gets cut by the cutter rib<br><br><br>
and releases the dry drug powder therein into the base. The drug particles are inhaled through the mouth piece. The knurls on the ring member provide a firm finger grip for holding the inhaler. The spaced air inlet holes at the bottom of the base are very narrow as compared to the long slot at the bottom of the base in the conventional inhaler. Due to the narrow air inlet holes, drug particles coming into contact with the air inlet holes will be very few and light and do not fall out through the air inlet holes and get lost. Instead, such drug particles will slide down along the tapered tubular projections at the inner peripheries of the air inlet holes into the bottom of the base. Wastage of the drug particles is thus prevented and full dosage of the drug is available for inhalation. Because the direction of inhalation and the direction of flow of air into the base are the same, effort to inhale the drug particles is reduced and inhalation is rendered easy and convenient. This is all the more desirable in an acute state of the medical condition. The capsule holder is always covered by the closure. Therefore, it is always possible to carry the inhaler with a capsule inserted in the capsule holder. This is very advantageous especially in an emergency when the capsule can be simply broken to release the drug for inhalation. This helps the patient to get immediate relief to the medical condition without any time delay. The meshed portion<br><br><br>
is also always covered by the closure. Therefore, chances of its getting contaminated with germs or foreign particles are eliminated. Due to the ring member being detachable the meshed portion is easily accessible and in case it requires any cleaning it is easy and convenient to do so. Thus the meshed portion remains and can be maintained clean and hygienic at all times. In case of any damage to the meshed portion only the ring member needs to be replaced and the inhaler can be reused. The inhaler of the invention is also user friendly for the reasons stated earlier.<br>
The steps externally adjacent the mouth of the base and externally adjacent the mouth of the closure may be internal in which case both the parts of the ring member may be adapted to detachably rotatably push or slide fit into the base and closure respectively. Alternatively the ring member may be provided with the steps and the base and the closure may be adapted to detachability rotatably push or slide fit into or over the base and closure. The geometries / profiles of the base and closure may be different. Such variations of the invention are to be construed and understood to be within the scope of the invention.<br><br><br>
