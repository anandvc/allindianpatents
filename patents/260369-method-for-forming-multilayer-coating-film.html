DESCRIPTION<br>
Method for Forming Multilayer Coating Film<br>
Technical field<br>
This invention relates to a method for forming multilayer coating film having excellent appearance, by 3-coat-1-bake system comprising successively applying onto a coating object, water-based first coloring paint, water-based second coloring paint and clear paint, and heat-curing the resulting 3-layered multilayer coating film simultaneously.<br>
Background art<br>
As coating methods of car bodies, generally those for forming multilayer coating film by 3-coat-2-bake (3C2B) system comprising, after applying an electrocoating paint on the coating object, application of intermediate paint ―&gt; curing by baking ―&gt; application of water-based base coating paint ―&gt; preheating (preliminary heating) ―&gt; application of clear paint ―&gt; curing by baking, have been widely adopted. Whereas, for energy-saving, attempts are made in recent years to omit the bake-curing step after application of intermediate paint and adopt 3-coat-1-bake (3C1B) system comprising, after applying an electrocoating paint on the coating object, application of water-based intermediate paint ―&gt; preheating (preliminary hearing) ―&gt; application of water-based base coating paint ―&gt; preheating (preliminary heating) ―&gt; application of clear paint ―&gt; curing by baking (e.g., see JP 2002-282773A).<br>
However, because the intermediate paint, base coating paint and clear paint are applied one on another in uncured condition in the above 3-coat-1-bake system, layer mixing is apt to take place between adjacent coating films, which occasionally impairs smoothness or distinctness of image of resulting coating film.<br>
As a countermeasure to the trouble, JP-2004-275966A discloses a method for forming laminar coating film excelling in finished appearance and chipping resistance, by carrying out the bake-curing step in multi-stage of low temperature-heating stage and high temperature-heating stage, each under specific temperature-time conditions. This coating film-forming method, however, is subject to problems that sufficient smoothness and distinctness of<br>
image may not be obtained when water-based paints are used as the intermediate paint and base coating paint.<br>
Disclosure of the invention<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a method for forming multilayer coating film excelling in smoothness and distinctness of image by 3-coat-1-bake system using water-based intermediate paint and water-based base coating paint.<br>
We have engaged in concentrative studies for accomplishing the above object and now discovered that multilayer coating film excelling in smoothness and distinctness of image could be formed by applying a specific water-based base coating paint on an intermediate coating film which has been adjusted to have a specific solid content, adjusting the solid content of the base coating film to a specific value, then applying a specific clear paint, and curing the intermediate coating film, base coating film and clear coating film simultaneously under specific heating conditions, in the coating steps of multilayer coating film by 3-coat-1-bake system using a water-based intermediate paint and water-based base coating paint. The present invention is thus completed.<br>
Accordingly, therefore, the invention provides a method for forming multilayer coating film on a coating object, which is characterized by successively carrying out the following steps (1-6):<br>
(1)	  a step of applying a water-based intermediate paint (X) to form an intermediate coating film,<br>
(2)	  a step of adjusting the solid content of the intermediate coating film which is formed in the step (1) to 70 - 100 mass%,<br>
(3)	  a step of forming a base coating film by applying onto the intermediate coating film as obtained in the step (2) a water-based base coating paint (Y) containing 30 - 55 mass parts, per 100 mass parts of the solid resin content of the paint, of an alcoholic solvent having a boiling point of 170 - 250°C,<br>
(4)	  a step of adjusting the solid content of the base coating film which is formed in the step (3) to 70 - 100 mass%,<br>
(5)	  a step of forming a clear coating film by applying onto the base coating film as obtained in the step (4) a clear paint (Z) containing 40 - 60 mass parts of carboxyl-containing compound and 60 - 40 mass parts of polyepoxide, per 100 mass parts of the solid resin content of the paint, and<br>
(6) a step of curing the intermediate coating film, base coating film and clear coating film, which are formed in the steps (1) - (5), simultaneously, by heating them at 100 - 120°C for 3 - 10 minutes and thereafter further heating them at 130 - 160°C for 10 - 30 minutes.<br>
According to the multilayer coating film-forming method of the present invention, multilayer coating film excelling in smoothness and distinctness of image can be formed on coating objects by 3-coat-1-bake system.<br>
Hereinafter the multilayer coating film-forming method of the invention is explained in further details, by the order of each of the above steps.<br>

The use rate of the basic compound can be normally within a range of 0.1 - 1.5 equivalent, preferably 0.2 - 1.2 equivalent, to the acid groups in the base resin (A).<br>
As the amino resin (B1), on the other hand, for example, partially or wholly methylolated amino resins, which are obtained by reaction of amino component such as melamine, urea, benzoguanamine, acetoguanamine, steroguanamine, spiroguanamine, dicyandiamide and the like, with aldehyde, can be used. Examples of the aldehyde include formaldehyde, paraformaldehyde, acetaldehyde, benzaldehyde and the like. Also these partially or wholly methylolated amino resins may further be partially or wholly etherified with alcohol. Examples of the alcohol useful for the etherification include methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, n-propyl alcohol,<br>
1-	propyl	alcohol, n-butyl alcohol, i-butyl alcohol, 2-ethylbutanol,<br>
2-	ethylhexanol	and the like.<br>
As the amino resin (B1), melamine resin is preferred. In particular, alkyl-etherified melamine resins such as methyl-etherified melamine resin obtained by partially or wholly etherifying with methyl alcohol the methylol groups in partially or wholly methylolated melamine resin, butyl-etherified melamine resin formed by partially or wholly etherifying the methylol groups with butyl alcohol, or methyl-butyl mixed etherified melamine resin formed by partially or wholly etherifying the methylol groups with methyl alcohol and butyl alcohol (preferably the methyl/butyl molar ratio therein ranging 9/1 - 3/7) are preferred.<br>
The melamine resin preferably has an weight-average molecular weight normally within a range of 500 - 5,000, in particular, 600 - 4,000, inter alia, 700 - 3,000.<br>
Where the melamine resin is used as the crosslinking agent (B), sulfonic acid such as paratoluenesulfonic acid, dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid, dinonylnaphthalenesulfonic acid or the like, or salts of these acids with amines can be used as catalyst.<br>

Step (2):<br>
The coating film of the water-based intermediate paint (X) (which hereafter may be referred to as intermediate coating film) as formed in the step (1) is adjusted of its solid content to 70 - 100 mass%, in particular, 75 - 99 mass%, inter alia, 80 - 98 mass%, before a water-based base coating paint (Y) is applied thereon.<br>
Here the solid content of the intermediate coating film can be measured by the following method:<br>
first, simultaneously with coating a water-based intermediate paint (X) onto a coating object, the same water-based intermediate paint (X) is applied also onto an aluminum foil whose mass (W1) was measured in advance. Subsequently, the aluminum foil which is subjected to a preheating or the like similarly to the coating film of the water-based intermediate paint (X) is recovered immediately before application of a water-based base coating paint (Y), and its mass (W2) is measured. Next, the recovered aluminum foil is dried at 110°C for 60 minutes and allowed to cool off to room temperature in a desiccator. Measuring the mass (W3) of the aluminum foil, the solid content is determined according to the following equation.<br>
Solid content of intermediate coating film (mass%) = {(W3 - W1) / (W2 - W1)} x 100.<br>
Adjustment of the solid content of intermediate coating film can be carried out by such means as preheating, air blowing or the like. Such preheating can be conducted normally by directly or indirectly heating the coated object in a drying over, at about 30 - about 100°C, preferably at about 40 - about 90°C, inter alia, at about 60 - about 80°C, for 30 seconds - 15 minutes, preferably 1 - 10 minutes, inter alia, 3 - 5 minutes. Also the air blowing can normally be conducted by blowing an ambient temperature air or air heated to about 25°C - about 80°C against the coated surface of the coating object.<br>
Step (3):<br>
Onto the intermediate coating film whose solid content is adjusted in the step (2), then a water-based base coating paint (Y) is coated. Water-based base coating paint (Y)<br>
The water-based base coating paint (Y) in the present invention includes water-based liquid paint comprising thermosetting resin component and water, and further comprising alcoholic solvent having a boiling point of 170 - 250°C, preferably 180 - 240°C, within a range of 30 - 55 mass parts, preferably 35 - 55 mass parts, per 100 mass parts of the solid resin content of the paint.<br>

Of those, 1-octanol, 2-octanol, 2-ethyl-1-hexanol and ethylene glycol mono-2-ethylhexyl ether can be favorably used.<br>
Also as thermosetting resin component, resin compositions for paint which are known per se, composed of base resin (A) such as polyester resin, acrylic resin, vinyl resin, alkyd resin, urethane resin or the like which contain crosslinkable functional groups such as hydroxyl group and hydrophilic functional groups such as carboxyl group; and crosslinking agent (B) such as melamine resin, optionally blocked polyisocyanate compound and the like, as explained concerning the water-based intermediate paint (X) can be used.<br>

In particular, it is preferable for the water-based base coating paint (Y) to contain, as at least a part of its pigment component, an effect pigment, so as to be able to form an elaborate metallic tone or pearl tone coating film.<br>
The water-based base coating paint (Y) can be coated by the means known per se, for example, air spray, airless spray, rotary atomizing coater or the like. Static electricity may be impressed at the coating time. The coating film thickness can be within a range of normally 5 - 40 µm, preferably 10 - 30 µm, in terms of cured film thickness.<br>
Step (4):<br>
The coating film of the water-based base coating paint (Y) (which hereafter may be referred to as base coating film) as formed in the step (3) is adjusted of its solid content to 70 - 100 mass%, in particular, 75 - 99 mass%, inter alia, 80 - 98 mass%, before a clear paint (Z) is applied thereon.<br>
Here the solid content of the base coating film can be measured by the following method:<br>
first, simultaneously with coating a water-based base coating paint (Y) onto the intermediate coating film, the same water-based base coating paint (Y) is applied also onto an aluminum foil whose mass (W4) was measured in advance. Subsequently, the aluminum foil which is subjected to a preheating or the like similarly to the coating film of the water-based base coating paint (Y) is recovered immediately before application of a clear paint (Z), and its mass (W5) is measured. Next, the recovered aluminum foil is dried at 110°C for 60 minutes and allowed to cool off to room temperature in a desiccator. Measuring the mass (W6) of the aluminum foil, the solid content is determined according to the following equation.<br>
Solid content of base coating film (mass%) = {(W6 - W4) / (W5 - W4)} x 100.<br>
Adjustment of the solid content of base coating film can be carried out by such means as preheating, air blowing or the like. Such preheating temperature can be about 30 - about 100°C, preferably about 40 - about 90°C, inter alia, about 60 - about 80°C, and the preheating time can be 30 seconds - 15 minutes, preferably 1 - 10 minutes, inter alia, 3 - 5 minutes. Also the air blowing can normally be conducted by blowing an ambient temperature air or air heated to about 25°C - about 80°C against the coated surface of the coating object.<br>
Step (5):<br>
Onto the base coating film whose solid content is adjusted in the step (4), further a clear paint (Z) is coated.<br>
As the clear paint (Z), for example, a clear paint containing, based on 100 mass parts of solid resin component in the paint, 40 - 60 mass parts, preferably 45 - 55 mass parts, of carboxyl-containing compound and 60 - 40 mass parts, preferably 55 - 45 mass parts, of polyepoxide can be used.<br>
Such carboxyl-containing compound is a compound having carboxyl group in its molecule, which can have an acid value within a range of normally 50 - 500 mgKOH/g, preferably 80 - 300 mgKOH/g.<br>
As the carboxyl-containing compound, for example, the following polymers (1) - (3) and compound (4) can be named. Polymer (1): polymers having half-esterified acid anhydride group in their molecules<br>
Here the group formed by half-esterification of acid anhydride group signifies a group formed of carboxyl group and carbonic acid ester group which is obtained by adding aliphatic monoalcohol to acid anhydride group to cause the latter's ring-opening (i.e., half-esterification). Hereafter the group may be referred to simply as half-ester group.<br>
The polymer (1) can be easily obtained by, for example, copolymerizing unsaturated monomer having half-ester group with other polymerizable unsaturated monomer by conventional means, or by carrying out similar copolymerization using unsaturated monomer having acid anhydride group instead of the half-ester group-containing unsaturated monomer and thereafter half-esterifying the acid anhydride group.<br>

Copolymerization of such unsaturated monomer having half-ester group or acid anhydride group with other copolymerizable unsaturated monomer can be carried out by general polymerization methods of unsaturated monomers, while solution type radical polymerization method in organic solvent is the most suitable in consideration of wider use and cost. For example, by carrying out the copolymerization reaction in a solvent such as aromatic solvent, e.g., xylene, toluene; ketone solvent, e.g., methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone; ester solvent, e.g., ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, isobutyl acetate, 3-methoxybutyl acetate; or alcoholic solvent, e.g., n-butanol, isopropyl alcohol; in the presence of a polymerization initiator such as azo catalyst, peroxide catalyst or the like, at temperatures ranging around 60-150°C, the object polymer can be easily obtained. <br>
Normally adequate copolymerization ratio of each of the half-ester group- or acid anhydride group-containing unsaturated monomer and other polymerizable unsaturated monomer is as follows, based on the combined mass of all the monomers: the half-ester group- or acid anhydride group-containing unsaturated monomer, within a range of generally 5-40 mass% , in particular, 10-30 mass %, from the viewpoints of curability and storage stability; and other polymerizable unsaturated monomer, within a range of generally 60-95 mass % , in particular, 70-90 mass%. Furthermore, it is adequate that the use amount of styrene among the other polymerizable unsaturated monomers is kept to no more than about 20 mass%, from the viewpoint of weatherability of cured coating film.<br>
The polymer (1) is preferably an acrylic resin having a number-average molecular weight normally within a range of 1,000-20,000, in particular, 1,500 - 15,000. When number-average molecular weight of the polymer is less than 1,000, weatherability of cured coating film may be reduced. Whereas, when it exceeds 20,000, its compatibility with polyepoxide tends to drop.<br>
Polymer (2): polymers having carboxyl group in their molecules<br>
Polymer (2) can be readily obtained by copolymerizing carboxyl-containing unsaturated monomer with other polymerizable unsaturated monomer by the method similar to the case of polymer (1).<br>

terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, phthalic anhydride, hexahydrophthalic anhydride. For example, the carboxyl-containing polyester polymer is obtainable by single stage reaction under the conditions in excess of carboxyl groups of the polyvalent carboxylic acid. Conversely, first a hydroxyl-terminated polyester polymer may be synthesized under the conditions in excess of hydroxyl groups of the polyhydric alcohol, to which an acid anhydride group-containing compound such as phthalic anhydride, hexahydrophthalic anhydride, succinic anhydride or the like is post-added to provide a carboxyl-containing polyester polymer.<br>
The carboxyl-containing polyester polymer (3) adequately has a number-average molecular weight normally within a range of 500 - 20,000, in particular, 800 - 10,000.<br>
Compound (4): half-esters formed through reaction of polyol with 1,2-acid anhydride<br>
The half-ester can be obtained through reaction of polyol with 1,2-acid anhydride under the conditions inducing ring-opening reaction of the acid anhydride but inducing substantially no polyesterification reaction. The reaction product generally has a low molecular weight and a narrow molecular weight distribution. The reaction product also shows a low content of volatile organic matter in the paint composition and furthermore imparts to the formed coating film excellent acid resistance and the like..<br>
The half-ester is obtainable by, for example, reacting polyol with 1,2-acid anhydride in an inert atmosphere, e.g., in nitrogen atmosphere, in the presence of a solvent. Suitable solvents include, for example, ketones such as methyl amyl ketone, diisobutyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone; aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene, xylene; and other organic solvents such as dimethylformamide, N-methylpyrrolidone and the like.<br>
Low reaction temperatures such as not higher than about 150°C are preferred. Specifically, normally about 70 - about 150°C, in particular, about 90 - about 120°C, are preferred. The reaction time basically varies more or less depending on the reaction temperature, which can be normally around 10 minutes - 24 hours.<br>
The reaction ratio of acid anhydride/polyol can be within a range of 0.8/1 - 1.2/1 in terms of equivalent ratio calculating the acid anhydride as being monofunctional, whereby the maximum of desired half-ester can be<br>
obtained.<br>
The acid anhydrides useful for preparation of the desired half-esters are those containing 2 - 30, in particular, 5 - 20, carbon atoms, excepting the carbon atoms in the acid moiety. Examples of such acid anhydride include aliphatic acid anhydrides, cycloaliphatic acid anhydrides, olefinic acid anhydrides, cycloolefinic acid anhydrides and aromatic acid anhydrides. These acid anhydrides may have substituents, with the proviso that they have no detrimental effect on reactivity of the acid anhydrides or characteristic properties of resulting half-esters.

The half-ester can have a number-average molecular weight within a range of normally 400 - 1,000, in particular, 500 - 900. As it has high reactivity with epoxy group, it is useful for formulating high solid paint.<br>
Polyepoxide which is used in combination with so far described carboxyl-containing compound is a compound having epoxy groups in its molecule. Those having an epoxy group content within a range of normally 0.8 - 15 millimols/g, in particular, 1,2 - 10 millimols/g are preferred.<br>

Of these, epoxy-containing acrylic polymers or alicyclic epoxy-containing acrylic polymers having a number-average molecular weight within a range of generally 1,000 - 20,000, in particular, 1,500 - 15,000 are preferably used.<br>
Such epoxy-containing acrylic polymers or alicyclic epoxy-containing acrylic polymers can be easily obtained by copolymerizing epoxy-containing unsaturated monomers or alicyclic epoxy-containing unsaturated monomers and other polymerizable unsaturated monomers by the methods similar to the case of the polymer (1).<br>
As the epoxy-containing unsaturated monomer, for example, glycidyl (meth)acrylate, allyl glycidyl ether and the like can be named, and as the alicyclic epoxy group-containing unsaturated monomer, for example, 3,4-epoxycyclohexylmethyl (meth)acrylate and the like can be named.<br>
Examples of the other polymerizable unsaturated monomers include those exemplified as to the polymer (1), i.e., hydroxyl-containing unsaturated monomers, (meth)acrylic acid esters, vinyl ethers or allyl ethers, olefin compounds and diene compounds, hydrocarbon ring-containing unsaturated monomers, nitrogen-containing unsaturated monomers, hydrolyzable alkoxysilyl group-containing acrylic monomers and the like.<br>
Preferred blend ratio of the carboxyl-containing compound and polyepoxide in the clear paint (Z) can be, in terms of the equivalent ratio between the carboxyl groups in the carboxyl-containing compound and the epoxy groups in the polyepoxide, within a range of generally 1/0.5 - 0.5/1, in<br>
particular, 1/0.7 - 0.7/1, inter alia, 1/0.8 - 0.8/1, from the viewpoint of curability of the coating film.<br>
Where necessary, curing catalyst may be blended in the clear paint (Z). Examples of useful curing catalyst include, as those catalysts effective for the ring-opening esterification reaction between the carboxyl groups in the carboxyl-containing compound and the epoxy groups in the polyepoxide, quaternary salt catalysts such as tetraethylammonium bromide, tetrabutylammonium bromide, tetraethylammonium chloride, tetrabutylphosphonium bromide, triphenylbenzylphosphonium chloride and the like; and amine compounds such as triethylamine, tributylamine and the like. Of these, quaternary salt catalysts are preferred. Furthermore, quaternary salt which is blended with approximately equivalent acidic phosphoric acid compound such as dibutylphosphoric acid is favorable in that it can improve storage stability of the paint and prevent deterioration in spray-coatability of the paint due to decrease in its electric resistance, without impairing the catalytic action.<br>
Where the curing catalyst is blended, its suitable blend ratio is normally about 0.01 - 5 mass parts, per 100 mass parts of total solid content of the carboxyl-containing compound and polyepoxide.<br>
The clear paint (Z) may also contain, where necessary, coloring pigment, effect pigment, dye and the like to an extent not impairing transparency, and may further suitably contain extender, UV absorber, defoamer, thickener, rust-preventive agent, surface regulating agent, organic solvent and the like.<br>
The clear paint (Z) can be applied onto the coated film surface of the water-based base coating paint (Y) by a method known per se, such as airless spray, air spray, rotary atomizing coater or the like. Static electricity may be impressed during the coating time. The coating film thickness can be made within a range of normally 10 - 60 µm, preferably 25 - 50 µm, in terms of cured film thickness.<br>
Step (6):<br>
The multilayer coating film formed of the three layers of the intermediate coating film, base coating film and clear coating film as formed in the above-described steps (1) - (5) is baked and cured simultaneously, by<br>
heating at about 100 - about 120°C for about 3 - 10 minutes, and then further heated at about 130 - about 160°C for about 10 - 30 minutes.<br>
The heating can be carried out by ordinary baking means of coating film, such as hot air heating, infrared heating, high frequency heating and the like. Specifically, for example, a method comprising placing a coating object, onto which the water-based intermediate paint (X), water-based base coating paint (Y) and clear paint (Z) have been successively applied, in a drying oven whose temperature is adjusted to about 100 - about 120°C, keeping the object in the oven for 3 - 10 minutes, thereafter adjusting the temperature of the drying oven to about 130 - about 160°C, and keeping the object therein to heat the same for 10 - 30 minutes; a method comprising preparing a tunnel dryer having an entrance and exit at its respective ends, through which an object is transferred by a belt conveyor to be dried, dividing inside of the tunnel into a low temperature zone and a high temperature zone, the temperature setting being about 100 - about 120°C at the low temperature zone and at about 130 - about 160°C at the high temperature zone, first passing the object through the low temperature zone consuming 3 - 10 minutes, and thereafter passing it through the high temperature zone consuming 10 - 30 minutes; a method comprising preparing a first drying oven whose temperature is adjusted to about 100 - about 120°C and a second drying oven whose temperature is adjusted to about 130 - about 160°C, keeping the coating object onto which the water-based intermediate paint (X), water-based base coating paint (Y) and clear paint (Z) have been successively applied, in the first drying oven for 3 - 10 minutes, and subsequently keeping the same object in the second drying oven for 10 - 30 minutes; and the like methods can be used.<br>
The reason why the application of the coating film-forming method of the present invention in the occasion of coating a water-based intermediate paint and water-based base coating paint by 3-coat-1-bake system enables formation of multilayer coating film excelling in smoothness and distinctness of image is not necessarily clear. It is inferred that the clear paint can uniformly spread in wet condition over the base coating film, as the clear paint comprising the carboxyl-containing compound and polyepoxide is applied onto the base coating film, under the conditions that the intermediate coating film and base coating film have relatively high solid contents and the volatile component remaining in the base coating film contains a large amount of alcoholic solvent having relatively high boiling point; and further by the two-stage heating, the solvent in the paint such as the alcoholic solvent is gently volatilized to form a multilayer coating film excelling in smoothness and distinctness of image.<br>
