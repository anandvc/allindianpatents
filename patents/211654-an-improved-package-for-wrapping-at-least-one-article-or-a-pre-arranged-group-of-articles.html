AN IMPROVED PACKAGE FOR WRAPPING AT LEAST ONE ARTICLE OR A GROUP OF ARTICLES<br>
PARLE PRODUCTS PVT. LTD.<br>
of North Level Crossing, Vile Parle (East), Mumbai 400 057,<br>
Maharashtra, India, <br>
an Indian Company<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE NATURE OF THIS INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED:-<br><br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to packages for wrapping articles or groups of articles.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention generally relates to a method of packing an article or a group of articles with a flexible packaging material.<br>
Typically, the flexible packaging material may be a single film or a laminate of one or more materials and having cold or hot sealing properties.<br>
This invention also relates to package for wrapping articles or groups of articles in an orderly manner.<br>
Particularly this invention relates to packages of flexible sheet element which are formed in automatic packaging machines with the help of article wrapping devices/apparatus.<br>
The relative terms length, breadth and height in respect of packages of this nature for packing articles or group of articles to be packed in an orderly manner are defined for the purpose of this specification as follows as illustrated in figures 1 and 2 and figures 3a to 3e of the accompanying drawings:<br><br>
2<br><br>
In figures 1 and 2 of the accompanying drawings, packages are defined primarily by length dimension L, height dimension H and breadth dimension B. Length dimension L is the longest dimension of the articles or groups of articles arranged in an orderly manner, which are required to be packed.<br>
Breadth dimension B is the shorter side of articles or groups of articles in an orderly manner which are required to be packed; and<br>
Height H is the relative third dimension besides the width and length of articles or groups of articles arranged in an orderly manner to be packed. The height dimension H generally lies in a plane perpendicular to the length dimension L and is typically shorter than the length dimension.<br>
The term longitudinal axis LA is the axis defined along the length dimension L. The sides of the packages, typically a rectangular package are designated as S and the ends by E. The shorter axis parallel to the breadth dimension of the package is designated C representing the cross axis. For packages of different cross sections, the respective terms height and length are shown in figures 3a to 3e.<br>
Figures 4a to 4e illustrate some examples of what is meant to mean an article or a group of article placed in an orderly manner. It is envisaged that what is not shown but what can be easily understood to one skilled in the art is that the articles and particularly the group of articles arranged in an orderly manner<br><br>
3 <br>
may be so arranged in a tray although such a tray is not particularly shown or illustrated. For instance, figure 4b illustrates rectangular shaped articles standing on edge and arranged in a single group, whereas figure 4d shows the same rectangular articles arranged in piles. As can be easily understood both groups of articles are arranged in an orderly manner albeit slightly differently. Similarly, figures 4f and 4g illustrate two different methods of placing circular disc shaped articles either in a linear group or in piles.<br>
This invention is also directed to packages where the shorter dimension is more than one fifth of the length and the length is not less than one third of the shorter dimension. Thus packages depicted in figures 14 or 15 which are relatively flat or pillow shaped are not within the purview of this invention.<br>
The prior art package is shown in a perspective view in figure 5 of the accompanying drawings in which, there is shown a perspective view illustrating a longitudinal tube 12 made of flexible wrapping material 10, and a flexible package 20 formed fi-om the longitudinal tube 12. The package 20 is formed from a web of scalable sheet material 10 moving along a generally linear approximately horizontal path although in the case of some machines the path can be inclined or vertical. The edges of a cut sheet of the flexible wrapping material 10 are sealed by a fin seal 14 which runs longitudinally parallelly along the longitudinal axis LA of the tube 12. A fin seal 14, is formed, is formed in the longitudinal tube 12 either by a hot or a cold<br><br>
4 <br>
process. In a hot process for example the heat seal is formed by a heat roller or a hot seal material, or the like, applied to either side of the opposed edges of the flexible material 10 which are joined to form the wrapping material into the shape of the longitudinal tube 12. In the cold process the ends may be sealed by, for example, pressure sensitive adhesive or other bonding material and pressure applied by a roller without the heat. The longitudinal tube 12 has end seals on the face E also called cross seals 27 and 28 which extend along the axis C perpendicular to the longitudinal axis LA of the tube 12 and therefore perpendicular to the fin seal 14. A section of the longitudinal tube 12 formed by a first end cut 26, a first end/cross seal 27, a second end/cross seal 28, and a second end cut 29. The second end cut 29 of the flexible package 20 also defines a first end cut 16 in the longitudinal tube 12 for a subsequent flexible package 20a to be formed in the longitudinal tube 12. Also, a first end seal 17 is formed in the longitudinal tube 12 in the same process in which the second end seal 28 was formed in the package 20, for forming the subsequent flexible package 20a from the longitudinal tube 12.<br>
Depending upon the shape of the article or groups of articles to be wrapped, the longitudinal package formed may define a typical cross section such as square, rectangular, round or<br>
elliptical or oval or other geometrical shapes such as a triangle<br>
or pentagon, hexagon, octagon and so on.<br><br><br><br>
5 <br>
The packages in accordance with the prior art are formed in the forming section of horizontal or vertical wrapping machines which are well known in the packaging/material handling art and typically comprise a forming section structure through which an elongated sheet of flexible wrapping material is drawn from a roll. The forming section is operative to continuously form from the sheet a forwardly moving tube having a rearwardly disposed open inlet end, and a laterally projecting "fin" defined by drawn-together side edge portions of the sheet. An article in-feed system is used to insert articles to be wrapped into the open tube inlet end. The inserted articles, in a longitudinally spaced group, are then carried within the wrapping material linearly to as it forwardly exits the forming section. The individual articles, or associated groups of articles, as may be the case, forwardly transported within the tube are spaced apart by spaced longitudinal sections of the tube.<br>
As the article-containing tube exits the forming section, the fin portion of the tube is drawn between, and sealed by, an opposed pair of counter rotating sealing elements. The sealed fin is then passed through a foldover station, which operates to fold the sealed fin over onto an adjacent portion of the tube. The tube, with its sealed and folded over fin, is then passed through a cutting and sealing station which operates to compress, heat seal, and transversely cut the longitudinal tube sections between longitudinally adjacent article pairs, or sets, to form individual, article-containing packages with sealed opposite ends and a<br>
6 <br>
weakened tearable portion between adjacent packages.<br>
In conventional wrapping machines, this final sealing and cutting process is typically performed by passing the tube through cutting elements such as a pair of opposed, cutting and sealing bar structures, or jaws, which intermittently mesh at radially outer ends thereof to simultaneously compress, heat seal, and cut each longitudinal cut tube section as it passes through the cutting and sealing station. To effect this process, one of the jaws is provided with a cutting knife interposed between first and second corrugated or other wise heat or cold sealing sections, while the other jaw is provided with an anvil portion interposed between first and second corrugated or otherwise sealing sections which can typically be mirror images of the corresponding corrugations on the knife-carrying jaw in case the edges have corrugations. The edges of the seals may also be flat.<br>
As a given longitudinal tube section passes between the rotating jaws, the outer jaw ends cooperate to sequentially mesh their first corrugated sections to form a corrugated heat seal along a lead portion of the tube section, force the cutting knife through the tube section and against the anvil to cut away the heat sealed tube section from the balance of the tube section, and then mesh the second corrugated sections of the jaws to form a corrugated heat seal along the balance of the longitudinal tube<br>
7 <br>
section.<br>
The speed of the tube section, and subsequent rate of end sealed individual packages produced by the horizontal wrapping machine is dependent upon the rate at which the tube moves linearly through the forming section. Therefore the length of the fin seal is critical to the speed at which the packages are formed end to end.<br>
Further as occasionally happens, particularly when groups of articles such as biscuits or cookies are packed, displacement of the articles may cause leading or the first article to fall from its vertical position and therefore be trapped between the end seals of two packages, i.e. between the front end seal of one pack and the rear seal of the adjacent pack. This causes wastage of two packs as the frapped article leaves both packs unsealed.<br>
Typical packages produced in accordance with the prior art process are shown in figures 6a and 6b and figures 7a and 7b which show a prior art rectangular package and a prior art cylindrical package respectively.<br>
As can be seen in the figures 6a and 6b and 7a and 7b, end/cross seals 27 and 28 are formed on the ends of the packs and are perpendicular to the longer side , length or longitudinal axis of the packs whereas the fin/longitudinal seal 14 is parallel to the longitudinal axis, the longer side and the length of the pack.<br><br>
8 <br>
Another drawback, therefore, of the package formed currently in the art as seen in the figures is that the end seals distort the ends of the formed package. Because of the projecting flaps of the end seals these surfaces are not available as display media for the product. In space restricted retail counters often such longitudinal packs are conveniently placed with their ends facing the customer in a stack of competing products. The flaps of the end seals distort the brands or logos provided on the ends of the pack and often the customer has to draw out the pack from the stack to scrutinize the pack.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
One object of this invention, is therefore to eliminate the drawbacks of the prior art packages and provide an improved package, and associated methods, for producing packages with no end seals on individual flexible packages discharged from horizontal wrapping machines, and the like, at an increased rate with a minimum fm seal. It is accordingly an object of the present invention to provide such an improved package and methods of making thereof<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a package which can be produced at high speeds, with less wastage of packing material and content and with less manpower per pack.<br>
9 <br>
Still another object of this invention is to provide a pack and a method of forming a pack in which the end faces of the pack are not distorted and are completely available for display.<br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided an improved package for wrapping at least one article or a group of articles arranged on an orderly manner , said package being defined by a formed longitudinal tube body of flexible wrapping sheet material having a length dimension, and at least one relatively shorter dimension being greater than one fifth of the length dimension, the said length dimension being at least three times the shorter dimension, a fin seal and two longitudinal cross seals and no end seals, characterized in that the fin seal is formed along the shorter dimension of the package perpendicular to the length dimension and the longitudinal cross seals are formed along the length dimension , the longitudinal cross seals being generally perpendicular to the fin seal, the ends of the package being seal-free.<br>
The articles in the package may be supported in a tray.<br>
The longitudinal cross seals may be flattened against the body of the package.<br>
Typically, the longitudinal tube body has a generally rectangular cross section. However, the longitudinal tube can<br>
10<br><br>
alternatively have a circular or oval cross-section or other geometric cross section.<br>
A feature of this invention is that the package formed in accordance with this invention has a fin seal which runs perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the package and therefore along the shorter dimension of the package and longitudinal cross seals, which replace the end seals of the prior art, are provided on the sides of the tube which longitudinal cross seals are parallel to the longitudinal axis of the package and perpendicular to the fin seal.<br>
Thus the fin seal is formed along the breadth [shorter side of<br>
the pack in the case of a rectangular pack] as opposed to along the length as in the conventional pack seen in figures 6a and 6b and 7a and 7b. Instead of end seals, longitudinal cross seals<br>
are formed along the length of the pack [longer side] instead of at the ends as in the conventional pack.<br>
The ends of the package in accordance with this invention, are not distorted by any sealing formations and are therefore available for display.<br>
The article or group of articles arranged in an orderly manner are fed within the tube sideways or laterally or width-wise instead of length wise and in the fin sealing station the flexible wrapping sheet is wrapped around the length of the article or the group of articles unlike in the conventional feeding system where the articles or group of articles are fed along their length<br>
11<br><br>
and the flexible wrapping sheets are wrapped around the width of the article or group of articles. Therefore both ends of the article or group of articles are unsupported. The longitudinal cross seals are now formed longitudinally with respect to the tube.<br>
The group of packages may be joined to each other along their longitudinal cross seals and are separated by tearing along the sides.<br>
Further since the speed of packaging is dependent upon the length of the fm seal, and since the fin seal is parallel to the shorter dimension, the speed of packaging is more than doubled in relation to the speed of packaging of the prior art.<br>
Therefore, an object of this invention is to increase the rate of a wrapping machine by using a flexible wrapping material which facilitates forming fin seals with a minimum time and temperature application, and with longitudinal cross seals instead of end cross seals.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS OF THIS INVENTION.<br>
The drawings and description relating thereto are merely illustrative of the features of this invention and do not in any way limit the nature and scope of this invention.<br>
Referring to the drawings, the packages shown in figures 6a and 6b and 7a and 7b are manufactured typically by a process seen in figures 17 and 18 of the drawings.<br>
What is shown in figures 17 and 18 are the forming section of a wrapping machine which is well known in the packaging/material handling art and typically comprises a forming section structure through which an elongated sheet of flexible wrapping material is drawn from a roll. The forming section is operative to continuously form from the sheet a forwardly moving tube 12 having a rearwardly disposed open inlet end 32, and a laterally projecting "fin" seal 14 defined by drawn-together side edge portions of the sheet. An article in-feed system is used to insert articles or groups or groups of articles 30 to be wrapped into the open tube inlet end 32. The inserted articles, in a longitudinally spaced group as seen in figure 17 and 18, are then carried within the wrapping material<br>
14<br><br>
tube 12 linearly to as it forwardly exits the forming section. The individual articles, or associated groups of articles, as may be the case, forwardly transported within the tube are spaced apart by spaced longitudinal sections 34 of the tube 12. In the subsequent sealing station [not shown], seals are applied in the intervening spaces 34 and a cut applied between the seals to form the package. As seen in figures 17 and 18 both ends of the article or group of articles 30 are unsupported. It is therefore possible for the leading article to fall within the intervening space 34 before entering the sealing station in which the end seals are applied.<br>
As seen in figures 19 and 20 the article or group of articles 30 are fed within the tube 36 sideways or laterally or width-wise instead of length wise and in the fin sealing station the flexible wrapping sheet is wrapped around the length of the article or the group of articles unlike in the conventional feeding system where the articles or group of articles are fed along their length and the flexible wrapping sheets are wrapped around the width of the article or group of articles. The fin seal 38 is formed across the articles or group of articles as seen in figure . The speed of formation of the packages is therefore considerably increased as in the same length in the forming station many more article or article groups are wrapped in the in the same time. Trials have shown that using the package in accordance with this invention it is possible to produce at least 20 per cent more packages in a given unit of time.<br>
15<br><br>
It is not possible for an article to be displaced within the tube 36 during formation as the wrapped sheet element holds the article or group of articles at both ends and itself acts as a guide which align the articles, particularly articles like biscuits or cookies which are packed when on edge and therefore there is no wastage in the formation of the packages in accordance with this invention on account of the leading biscuit or other article falling as in the conventional package.<br>
It is thus believed that the operation and construction of the present invention will be apparent from the foregoing description of a preferred embodiment. While the device and methods shown are described as being preferred, it will be obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art that various changes and modifications may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
