BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method for removing embedding media from biological samples on automated instruments prior to immunohistochemical (IHC), in situ<br>
20 hybridization (ISH) or other histochemical or cytochemical manipulations. The present invention also relates to a method for conditioning cells or tissues so as to increase the accessibility of various molecules to their respective targets and generally to improve tissue and cell readability.<br>
25     Summary of the Related Art<br>
Diagnosis of disease based on interpretation of tissue or cell samples taken from a diseased organism has expanded dramatically over the past few years. In addition to traditional histological staining techniques and immunohistochemical assays, in situ techniques such as in situ hybridization and in situ polymerase chain reaction are now used 30 to help diagnose disease states in humans. Thus, there are a variety of techniques that can assess not only cell morphology, but also the presence of specific macromolecules within cells and tissues.   Each of these techniques requires the preparation of sample cells or<br><br>
WO 00/14507<br><br>
PCT/US99/20353<br><br>
-2-tissues which may include fixing the sample with chemicals such as an aldehyde (such as formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde), formalin substitutes, alcohol (such as ethanol, methanol, isopropanol) or embedding the sample in inert materials such as paraffin, celloidin, agars, polymers, resins, cryogenic media or a variety of plastic embedding media (such as epoxy 5 resins and acrylics). Other sample tissue or cell preparations require physical manipulation such as freezing (frozen tissue section) or aspiration through a fine needle (fine needle aspiration (FNA)). Regardless of the tissue or cell sample or its method of preparation or preservation, the goal of the technologist is to obtain accurate, readable and reproducible results that permit the accurate interpretation of the data.   One way to provide accurate,<br>
10 readable and reproducible data is to prepare the tissue or cells in a fashion that optimizes the results of the test regardless of the technique employed. In the case of immunohistochemistry and in situ techniques this means increasing the amount of signal obtained from the specific probe (antibody, DNA, RNA). In the case of histochemical staining it may mean increasing the intensity of the stain or increasing staining contrast.<br>
15	Without preservation, tissue samples rapidly deteriorate such that their use in<br>
diagnostics is compromised shortly after removal from their host. In 1893, Ferdinand Blum discovered that formaldehyde could be used to preserve or fix tissue so that this tissue could be used in histochemical procedures. The exact mechanisms by which formaldehyde acts in fixing tissues are not fully established, but they involve cross-linking of reactive sites<br>
20 within the same protein and between different proteins via methylene bridges (Fox et al., J. Histochem. Cytochem. 33: 845-853 (1985)). Recent evidence suggests that calcium ions also play a role (Morgan et al., J. Path. 11 A: 301-307 (1994)). These links cause changes in the quaternary and tertiary structures of proteins, but the primary and secondary structures appear to be preserved (Mason et al., J. Histochem. Cytochem. 39: 225-229 (1991)).  The<br>
25 extent to which the cross-linking reaction occurs depends on conditions such as the concentration of formalin, pH, temperature and length of fixation (Fox et al., J, Histochem. Cytochem. 33: 845-853 (1985)). Some antigens, such as gastrin, somatostatin and a-1-antitrypsin, may be detected after formalin fixation, but for many antigens, such as intermediate filaments and leukocyte markers, immunodetection after formalin treatment is<br>
30 lost or markedly reduced (McNicol &amp; Richmond, Histopathology 32: 97-103 (1998)). Loss of antigen immunoreactivity is most noticeable at antigen epitopes that are discontinuous,<br><br>
WO 00/14507<br><br>
PCT/US99/20353<br><br>
-3-i.e. amino acid sequences where the formation of the epitope depends on the confluence of portions of the protein sequence that are not contiguous.<br>
Antigen Retrieval™ is a term that describes the attempt to "undo" the structural changes that treatment of tissue with a cross-linking agent induces in the antigens resident 5 within that tissue. Although there are several theories that attempt to describe the mechanism of Antigen Retrieval™ such as loosening or breaking of crosslinkages formed by formalin fixation, it is clear that modification of protein structure by formalin is reversible under conditions such as high-temperature heating. It is clear that several factors affect Antigen Retrieval™; heating, pH, molarity and metal ions in solution (Shi et al., J. 10     Histochem. Cytochem. 45: 327-343 (1997)).<br>
Microwave heating appears to be the most important factor for retrieval of antigens masked by formalin fixation. Microwave heating (100°±5°C) generally yields better results in Antigen Retrieval™ immunohistochemistry (AR-IHC).<br>
Different heating methods have been described for antigen retrieval in IHC such as 15 autoclaving (Pons et al, Appl. Immunohistochem. 3: 265-267 (1995); Bankfalvi et al., J. Path. 174: 223-228 (1994)), pressure cooking (Miller &amp; Estran ,Appl. Immunohistochem. 3: 190-193 (1995); Norton et al., J. Path. 173: 371-379 (1994)); water bath (Kawai et al., Path. Int. 44: 759-764 (1994)), microwaving plus plastic pressure cooking (U.S. Patent No.; Taylor et al. (1995); Pertschuk et al, J. Cell Biochem. 19(suppl.): 134-137 (1994)), and 20 steam heating (Pasha et al., Lab. Invest. 72: 167A (1995); Taylor et al., CAP Today 9: 16-22 (1995)).<br>
Although some antigens yield satisfactory results when microwaving is performed in distilled water, many antigens require the use of buffers during the heating process. Some antigens have particular pH requirements such that adequate results will only be 25 achieved in a narrow pH range. Presently, most Antigen Retrieval™ solutions are used at a pH of approximately 6-8, but there is some indication that slightly more basic solutions may provide marginally superior results (Shi, et al., J. Histochem. Cytochem. 45: 327-343 (1997)).<br>
Although the chemical components of the Antigen Retrieval™ solution, including 30     metal ions, may play a role as a possible co-factor in the microwaving procedure, thus far,<br><br>
WO 00/14507<br><br>
PCT/US99/20353<br><br>
-4-no single chemical has been identified that is both essential and best for Antigen Retrieval™.<br>
Many solutions and methods are used routinely for staining enhancements. These<br>
may include but are not limited to distilled water, EDTA, urea, Tris, glycine, saline and<br>
5     citrate buffer.  Solutions containing a variety of detergents (ionic or non-ionic surfactants)<br>
may also facilitate staining enhancement under a wide range of temperatures (from ambient<br>
to in excess of 100°C).<br>
In addition to cell surface molecules that may be present on the exterior portion of the cell, other molecules of interest in IHC, ISH and other histochemical and cytochemical<br>
10 manipulations are located within the cell, often on the nuclear envelope. Some of these molecules undergo molecular transformation when exposed to a fixative (coagulative or precipitive) such as formalin. Thus with respect to these molecules it is desirable to not only overcome the effects of fixation but also to increase the permeability of the cell in order to facilitate the interaction of organic and inorganic compounds with the cell.<br>
15	Other tissue samples may not have been subjected to cross-linking agents prior to<br>
testing, but improved results with respect to these tissues is also important. There are a variety of non-formalin methods for preserving and preparing cytological and histological samples. Examples of these methods include but are not limited to a) hematology smears, cytospins™, ThinPreps™, touch preps, cell lines, Ficoll separations for lymphocytes and<br>
20 buffy coats etc. are routinely preserved in a many ways which include but are not limited to air-drying, alcoholic fixation, spray fixatives and storage mediums such as sucrose/glycerin storage medium, b) tissues and cells (either fixed or unfixed) may be frozen and subsequently subjected to various stabilizing techniques such preservation, fixation and desiccation, c) tissues and cells may be stabilized in a number of non-cross-linking<br>
25 aldehyde fixatives, non- aldehyde containing fixatives, alcoholic fixatives, oxidizing agents, heavy metal fixatives, organic acids and transport media.<br>
One way to improve testing results is to increase the signal obtained from a given sample. In a general sense, increased signal can be obtained by increasing the accessibility of a given molecule for its target. As in the case for antigens found within the cell, targets<br>
30 within the cell can be made more accessible by increasing the permeability of the cell thereby permitting a greater number of molecules entry into the cell, thereby increasing the<br><br>
WO 00/14507<br><br>
PCT/US99/20353<br><br>
-5-probability that the molecule will "find" its target.    Such increased permeability is especially important for techniques such as ISH, in situ PCR, IHC, histochemistry and cytochemistry.<br>
Tissues and cells are also embedded in a variety of inert media (paraffin, celloidin, 5 OCT™, agar, plastics or acrylics etc.) to help preserve them for future analysis. Many of these inert materials are hydrophobic and the reagents used for histological and cytological applications are predominantly hydrophilic, therefor the inert medium may need to be removed from the biological sample prior to testing. For example, paraffin embedded tissues sections are prepared for subsequent testing by removal of the paraffin from the<br>
10     tissue section by passing the slide through various organic solvents such as toluene, xylene, limonene or other suitable solvents. Traditional deparaffinization uses organic solvents, which generally requires that the process be performed in ventilated hoods. Furthermore use and disposal of these solvents increases the cost of analysis and exposure risk associated with each tissue sample tested.<br>
15	Presently, there is no available technique for removing inert media from sample<br>
tissue by directly heating the slide in an automated fashion. Neither is it currently possible to remove inert media from sample tissue while conditioning the sample tissue or cell in a one-step automated staining process.<br>
The methods of the present invention permit a) automated removal of embedding<br>
20     media without the use of organic solvents, thus exposing the cells for staining and thereby reducing time, cost and safety hazards b) automated cell conditioning without automated removal of embedding media from the sample cell or tissue, c) a multi-step automated process that exposes the cells, performs cell conditioning and increases permeability of the cytological or histological specimens, thereby increasing sample readability and improving<br>
25    interpretation of test data. The methods of the present invention can be used for improving the stainability and readability of most histological and cytological samples used in conjunction with cytological and histological staining techniques.<br><br>

-6-SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an automated method for exposing biological samples for use in histological or cytological testing procedures by removing the 5      embedding media without the use of organic solvents.<br>

The present invention also relates to an automated method for the simultaneous exposing and cell conditioning of biological samples for histochemical and cytochemical 10     applications.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
One embodiment of the present invention relates to the exposing of biological<br>
15 samples by removal of the inert materials in which biological samples have been embedded for preservation and support. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, paraffin or other inert materials are removed from biological samples by heating one side of the biological sample. This may be accomplished by contact heating of the microscope slide on which the embedded biological samples have been placed. Other inert materials that can<br>
20 be removed from embedded biological samples include but are not limited to agars and cryogenic media. This process of removal of inert embedding media or etching of embedding media is referred to herein as exposing.<br>
In a preferred method of the present invention, the paraffin-embedded biological sample laying on the glass slide is first heated by a heating element.   The heating<br>
25 element exposes heat on one side of the biological sample (such as the thermal platforms disclosed in U.S. patent application 09/259,240, herein incorporated by reference) within an automated staining instrument (U.S. patent application Serial No. 08/995,052 filed on December 19, 1997 and U.S. provisional patent application Serial No. 60/076,198 filed on February 27, 1998, both of which are herein incorporated by<br>
30 reference) such that the sample slide is dried and the paraffin is melted. Typically, the biological sample is placed on a top surface of a slide (such as a glass slide). The slide<br><br>
WO 00/14507<br><br>
PCT7US99/20353<br><br>
-7-is then placed on top of the thermal platform, so that the bottom surface of the slide is in contact with the thermal platform. The thermal platform, via conduction, heats the bottom portion of the slide. After the heating of the biological sample, the inert material may be removed from the slide by a fluid (as a gas or liquid). For example, the inert 5     material may be rinsed with DI water and a surfactant.<br>
In another method of the present invention, a paraffin embedded biological sample is placed on a glass microscope slide and the microscope slide is placed on a heating element. A reagent is placed on the biological sample slide, the biological sample slide is then exposed to elevated temperatures that will permit the melting of the<br>
10 inert material, and after which the inert material may be removed from the slide by a fluid (as a gas or liquid).<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, reagents are used in conjunction with heating the embedded biological samples. Suitable reagents may include, but are not limited to, de-ionized water, citrate buffer (pH 6.0-8.0), Tris-HCl<br>
15     buffer (pH 6-10), phosphate buffer (pH 6.0-8.0), SSC buffer, APK Wash™, acidic buffers or solutions (pH 1-6.9), basic buffers or solutions (pH 7.1-14), mineral oil, Norpar, canola oil, and PAG oil. Each of these reagents may also contain ionic or non-ionic surfactants such as Triton X-100, Tween, Brij, saponin and sodium dodecylsulfate. In a method of the present invention, the temperature of the heating element is<br>
20 raised to a temperature in excess of the melting point of the inert material. For example, the melting point of pure paraffin is listed as 50-57° C in the Merck index. Thus, in the method of the present invention, the temperature is in excess of the melting point of the paraffin in which the biological sample is embedded. In a preferred method of the present invention, the temperature is raised in excess of 50° C to about 130° C.<br>
25	In a method of the present invention, the duration of time required to melt the<br>
inert material will vary according to the temperature used and the embedding material. Typically, in an automated system, a processor, such as a microprocessor, is used in conjunction with a memory. The amount of time and the temperature required to melt the paraffin is contained within a table contained in the memory.<br>
30	The paraffin embedded biological sample is subjected to elevated temperatures<br>
ranging from 5 minutes to 60 minutes. The heating element used in the method of the<br><br>
WO 00/14507<br><br>
PCT/US99/20353<br><br>
-8-present invention requires that sufficient contact be maintained between the surface on which the biological sample is placed and the heating element.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention relates to the exposing of biological samples without removal of the inert materials in which biological samples 5 have been embedded for preservation and support. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, biological samples are readied for testing by contact heating of the microscope slide on which the embedded biological samples have been placed. Other inert materials that are not removed from embedded biological samples include but are not limited to plastic or celloidin embedding media and/or other polymers and resins.<br>
10	In a preferred method of the present invention, the embedded biological sample<br>
laying on the glass slide is first heated by the heating element. The heating element exposes heat on one side of the biological sample, such as by using the thermal platforms disclosed in U.S. patent application 09/259,240 within an automated staining instrument (U.S. patent applications 08/995,052 and 60/076,198) such that the sample<br>
15     slide is dried.<br>
In another method of the present invention, an embedded biological sample is placed on a glass microscope slide and the microscope slide is heated on one side (e.g., by placing the slide on a thermal platform). A reagent is then placed on the biological sample slide and the biological sample slide, with the reagent, is then heated to a<br>
20 specified temperature (ranging from ambient to greater than 100°C) and for a specified amount of time (ranging from 2 minutes to 12 hours). This will cause etching of the surface of the inert embedding material, and after which the etching reagent may be removed from the slide by a fluid (as a gas or liquid). As discussed previously, the amount of time and the specified temperature may be stored in memory.<br>
25	In the preferred method of the present invention,  reagents  are used in<br>
conjunction with or without heating the embedded biological samples. Suitable reagents may include, but are not limited to, de-ionized water, citrate buffer (pH 6.0-8.0), Tris-HC1 buffer (pH 6-10), phosphate buffer (pH 6.0-8.0), SSC buffer, APK Wash™, acidic buffers or solutions (pH 1-6.9), basic buffers or solutions (pH7.1-14) mineral oil,<br>
30 Norpar, canola oil, and PAG oil. Each of these reagents may also contain ionic or non-ionic surfactants such as Triton X-100, Tween, Brij, saponin and sodium dodecylsulfate.<br><br>
WO 00/14507<br><br>
PCT/US99/20353<br><br>
-9-<br>
In the method of the present invention, the temperature of the heating element is<br>
set to an appropriate level for the drying or the etching of the embedded biological<br>
sample. For example, etching may be carried out with a basic solution of methanol<br>
sodium hydroxide (sodium methoxide) at temperatures ranging from ambient to 37°C.<br>
5	In the method of the present invention, the duration of time required to etch the<br>
inert material will vary according to the temperature used and the embedding material (plastic or celloidin embedding media and/or other polymers and resins etc.). In a preferred method of the present invention the embedded biological sample is subjected to appropriate temperatures ranging from 2 minutes to 12 hours. The heating element<br>
10 used in the method of the present invention requires that sufficient contact be maintained between the surface on which the biological sample is placed and the heating element.<br>
A preferred embodiment present invention also comprises an automated method of cell conditioning, either concurrent with, subsequent to or independent of removal or<br>
15 etching of the inert embedding material from the biological sample. Heating the biological sample in an appropriate (organic or inorganic) reagent has been found to improve the accessibility of the reagent to the target molecule in the cell (protein, nucleic acid, carbohydrate, lipid, pigment or other small molecule). This process of improving accessibility of the reagent (organic or inorganic) to the molecular target is<br>
20     referred to herein as cell conditioning.<br>
In one method of the present invention, cell conditioning is accomplished while the biological sample is being exposed as described above. In this method of the present invention, a biological sample is placed on a glass microscope slide and the microscope slide is heated on one side (e.g., by placing the slide on a thermal platform) within an<br>
25 automated staining instrument (U.S. patent applications 08/995,052 and 60/076,198). A reagent is placed on the biological sample and the temperature of the heating element may or may not be increased. The biological sample is exposed to the appropriate temperature for an appropriate duration of time that will permit the melting or etching of the inert material and permit cell conditioning of the biological sample to be<br>
30     subsequently stained using histological or cytological techniques.<br><br>
WO 00/14507<br><br>
PCT/US99/20353<br><br>
-10-The reagents used for cell conditioning can be the same as those for exposing the embedded biological sample. For example, for DNA targets, a cell conditioning solution may be a solution of EDTA; a common temperature setting may be 95°C for a duration ranging from 6-60 minutes. For protein targets, a cell conditioning solution 5 may be a solution of boric acid buffer; a common temperature setting may be in excess of 100°C for a duration ranging from 6-60 minutes. For RNA targets, a cell conditioning solution may be a solution of SSC; a common temperature setting may be 75°C for a duration ranging from 6-60 minutes. For histochemical reactions, such as a Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) stain, a cell conditioning solution may be treated de-<br>
10 ionized water; a common temperature may range from 60-80°C for a duration of 6-30 minutes. A partial list of possible reagents appears in Analytical Morphology, Gu, ed., Eaton Publishing Co. (1997) at pp. 1-40. The solutions should generally be of known molarity, pH, and composition. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), ethylene glycol is preferably added to the conditioning solution. In addition, metal ions or other materials<br>
15     may be added to these reagents to increase effectiveness of the cell conditioning.<br>
In another method of the present invention, cell conditioning is accomplished subsequent to the biological sample being exposed as described above. In this method of the present invention a biological sample is placed on a glass microscope slide and the microscope slide is heated on one side {e.g., by placing the slide on a thermal<br>
20 platform) within an automated staining instrument (U.S. patent applications 08/995,052 and 60/076,198). In this method, the embedded biological sample laying on the glass slide is first heated by the heating element within an automated staining instrument such that the sample slide is dried and the embedding material is melted or etched and removed by the application of a fluid. Subsequent to exposing the biological sample, an<br>
25 appropriate reagent is applied in order to permit cell conditioning of the biological sample to be subsequently stained using histological or cytological techniques.<br>
The reagents used for cell conditioning can be the same as those for exposing the embedded biological sample. For example, for DNA targets, a cell conditioning solution may be a solution of SSC; a common temperature setting may be 95°C for a<br>
30 duration ranging from 6-60 minutes. For protein targets, a cell conditioning solution may be a solution of Phosphate buffer; a common temperature setting may be in excess<br><br>
WO 00/14507	PCT/US99/20353<br>
-11-of 100°C for a duration ranging from 6-60 minutes. For RNA targets, a cell conditioning solution may be a solution of SSC; a common temperature setting may be 75°C for a duration ranging from 6-60 minutes. For histochemical reactions, such as a Trichrome stain, a cell conditioning solution may be Bouins; a common temperature 5     may range from 60-80°C for a duration of 6-30 minutes.<br>
In yet another method of the present invention, cell conditioning is accomplished without the biological sample being exposed. In this method of the present invention, a biological sample is placed on a glass microscope slide and the microscope slide placed on a heating element within an automated staining instrument.<br>
10      A reagent is placed on the biological sample and the temperature of the heating element may or may not be increased. Cell conditioning of the biological sample may be performed prior to being stained using histological or cytological techniques.<br>
The reagents used for cell conditioning can be the same as those for exposing the embedded biological sample. For example, for DNA targets, a cell conditioning<br>
15     solution may be a solution of Sodium Citrate; a common temperature setting may be 90°C for a duration ranging from 6-60 minutes. For protein targets, a cell conditioning solution may be a solution of urea; a common temperature setting may be in excess of 100°C for a duration ranging from 6-60 minutes. For whole cells, a cell conditioning solution may be a solution of methanol; a common temperature setting may be ambient<br>
20      for a duration ranging from 4-10 minutes. For histochemical reactions, such as an Acid Fast Bacilli (AFB) stain, a cell conditioning solution may be peanut oil; a common temperature may range from 60-70°C for a duration of 30-60 minutes.<br>
The present invention also comprises cell conditioning of cytological preps, such as fine needle aspirations (FNA) smears, touch preps, Ficoll, Cytospins®, Thins<br>
25     Preps®, cervical-vaginal pap smears, blood or body fluid films, etc., that are neither fixed with an aldehyde nor embedded in a matrix, such as paraffin. Many are fixed in an alcohol, such as methanol or ethanol, others will be sprayed with hair spray or other aerosol fixative and dried, and still others will be placed in cytological fixatives, which may include carbowax and Saccomanno"s (organic or inorganic) reagent among others.<br>
30      The cells are either centrifuged or filtered to a slide or directly touched to a glass slide and smeared in some cases (PAP"s) or applied directly against the slide (touch preps).<br><br>
