				<td>Method, System and Apparatus of Realizing Indicating Resource of Multicast and Broadcast Service (MBS)<br>
Field of the Technology<br>
The present invention generally relates to physical resource indicating technique in MBS, more particularly to a method, a system and apparatus of realizing indicating resource of Multicast and Broadcast Service (MBS).<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
With the rapid development of Internet technology, large amounts of multimedia services have emerged, among them some application services requiring that multiple users receive the same data at the same time, namely multicasting the data, and such application services include video on demand, television broadcasting, video conference, online education, interactive games and so on.<br>
Multicast service is the technique that can transfer the data from a data source to multiple destinations, including multicast and broadcast. As to broadcast service, in traditional mobile networks, Cell Broadcast Service (CBS) only allows transferring low speed data to all users through the shared broadcast channel of the cell, which belongs to message services. As to multicast service, there has been IP multicast technique in terms of existing IP network, but the mobile network has special network structure, function entities and wireless interfaces, which are different from those of IP network, so current IP multicast techniques are only applicable for cable IP networks while not applicable for mobile networks. In addition, compared with common services, mobile multimedia services have the characteristics such as large quantity of data, long time of duration, sensitive time delay and so on. Therefore, transmission techniques of current broadcast services and multicast services are not applicable for data transmission of mobile multimedia services.<br>
In order to utilize mobile network resources effectively, on one hand, a Wide Code Division Multiple Access/Global System for Mobile Communications (WCDMA/GSM) global standardization organization, the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), put forward Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS), and Multicast and Broadcast Service (MBS) is introduced into the latest protocol IEEE802.16e/D5 by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers<br><br>
(IEEE) 802.16. MBMS and MBS provide the specifications of transferring the data from one data source to multiple users in the mobile network, so that the mobile network can provide point to multipoint service of transferring the data from one data source to multiple users, thereby network resources can be shared, utilization ratio of network resources is increased, and especially utilization ratio of idle interface resources is increased too. The newly provided MBMS and MBS cannot only implement multicast and broadcast of low speed messages such as plain text, but also that of high speed multimedia services, and this is obviously in trend of future mobile data development.<br>
The network structure of MBS put forward by IEEE802.16 protocol is as shown in figure 1. In figure 1, MBS server, a mobile network function entity, is added to support MBS, MBS server acts as the entry to content providers on one hand, and on the other hand, MBS server manages multicast data transmission of underlying Base Stations (BS) as well as distributes the multicast data to the underlying BS. In addition, the function entities, such as Mobile Station (MS), BS and so on, need to be enhanced by adding service functions associated with MBS service.<br>
MBS operations mainly include the following parts: obtaining the list information of MBS, authenticating MBS and obtaining the encryption key of MBS, and receiving the MBS normally. Specifically speaking, before normally receiving MBS service, MS acquires information like MBS content list etc. from MBS server firstly, and then requests BS to authenticate the receiving of MBS content; if the authentication is passed, BS transmits information including MBS downlink service parameters and so on to MS, and then MS requests BS to return the key of MBS; upon receiving the downlink service parameters and the key of MBS, MS can receive related Media Access Control Protocol Data Unit (MAC PDU) and receive the MBS service normally.<br>
The procedure of normally receiving MBS service mainly refers to receiving the MBS service content by using the received MBS downlink service parameters. In current standard draft, MBS downlink service parameters mainly include MBS ZONE identifier and Multicast Connection ID (Multicast CID). After the MBS downlink service parameters are obtained, physical resource indication has to be performed for MS during the service reception of MBS so as to implement the reception of MBS content.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
message is indexed, because the practical physical channel resource occupied by the MBS-MAP message cannot be determined only by the information of the OFDMA symbol offset in which the MBS zone starts, thus the physical channel resource occupied by MBS cannot be determined, and then the service reception of MBS cannot be implemented.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
In view of above, the present invention is to provide a method, a system and apparatus of realizing indicating resource of MBS, so as to normally receive the MBS service by initially positioning the physical channel resource occupied by the MBS-MAP message.<br>
And the present invention is to provide a method, a system and apparatus of realizing indicating resource of MBS, wherein less system message resource is needed for normally receiving the MBS.<br>

The present invention provides multiple selections for positioning the MBS-MAP message.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic diagram illustrating the network structure of MBS service put forward in current IEEE802.16 protocol.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The scheme of the present invention will be illustrated in detail hereinafter with reference to specific embodiments.<br>
The first embodiment of the present invention is mainly to add a field describing the specific physical channel resource occupied by the MBS-MAP message to the MBS-MAPJE 0 in DL-MAP message, and the structure of the MBS-MAPJE () with an added field is as shown in figure 3.<br><br><br><br>
Compared with the original MBS-MAPJE (), the MBS-MAPJE () shown in figure 3 mainly adds Subchannel offset, Boosting, No. of OFDMA Symbols, No. of Subchannels and DIUC, wherein these pieces of information together with OFDMA Symbol offset can uniquely determine position of the physical channel resource occupied by the MBS-MAP message as well as the used modulation and coding mode. When MS detects that Multicast CID and MBS ZONE identifier in the MBS-MAPJE 0 of DL-MAP message are identical to the ones which the MS expects to receive, MS can directly obtain the position of corresponding MBS-MAP message, and then obtain the physical channel resource allocated for corresponding "Multicast CID" from the MBS-MAP message, thereby the multicast messages can be normally received.<br>
Therein Multicast CID and/or MBS ZONE identifier are service information associated with MBS; MBS-MAP message includes the service information associated with MBS.<br>
Therefore, in the described embodiment, position of the physical channel resource occupied by the MBS-MAP message can be determined by using the MBS-MAPJE () and then MBS service can be normally received.<br>
Besides, the described first embodiment can be further improved to acquire the<br><br>
second embodiment of the present invention by deleting the Multicast CID field in the MBS-MAPJE (). As MBS MAP message and MBS ZONE are corresponding to each other, if MS detects that the MBS ZONE identifier in the MBS-MAPJE () is identical to the one that the MS expects to receive, MS can determine that the relevant position information in the MBS-MAP message of this IE is the needed position information.<br>
Since MBS-MAP message can carry multiple Multicast CIDs, DL-MAP message needs to carry multiple MBS-MAP_IE () accordingly, but the Multicast CID field is deleted in the second embodiment of the present invention, so the Multicast CID in the same MBS ZONE can share one MBS-MAPJE (), so that the load of DL-MAP message is decreased.<br>
The third embodiment is implemented mainly based on the corresponding relation between MBS ZONE and MBS-MAP message. At present, positioning the MBS ZONE can be implemented through the MBS-MAPJE () in the DL-MAP message, but MBA-MAP message and MBS ZONE are corresponding to each other, therefore, this embodiment firstly specifies the subchannel defining manner (Permutation and IDCELL) used in MBS ZONE, the relative position of the specific physical channel resource occupied by the MBS-MAP message in MBS ZONE as well as the used modulation and coding mode. Wherein, this physical channel resource specifically includes subchannels and OFDMA symbols. For instance, it can be specified that the first to the fourth OFDM symbol in MBS ZONE as well as the first to the third subchannel are used to transfer the MBS-MAP messages after the defining mode of a subchannel is specified.<br>
With respect to the above setting, MS determines the position information of the MBS ZONE according to the OFDMA Symbol offset in the MBS- MAPJE () at first after receiving the DL-MAP message, and then determines the physical channel resource according to the relative position of this physical channel resource occupied by the MBS-MAP message in the MBS ZONE. Wherein, the relative position information of the physical channel resource in the MBS ZONE includes: OFDMA Symbol offset, subchannel offset, No. of the OFDMA symbols and No. of the subchannels.<br>
The fourth embodiment of the preset invention is to send the MBS-MAP message through Broadcast CID, of course, the launching position of the MBS-MAP<br><br>
message should be specified in the relevant IE in the DL-MAP message beforehand, so that BS can send the MBS-MAP message through this launching position, wherein the relevant IE of the DL-MAP message can be DL-MAP IE (DL-MAPJE ()). Since MS receives the information carried by all Broadcast CIDs, if detecting the type of a message is identical to that of MBS-MAP message, MS will determine this message as an MBS-MAP message, and the MS receiving the MBS-MAP message can certainly determine the position of the MBS-MAP message.<br>
The above are just the preferred embodiments of the present invention, and should not be used to confine the protection scope of the present invention, as detailed by the claim hereinafter.<br><br><br>
