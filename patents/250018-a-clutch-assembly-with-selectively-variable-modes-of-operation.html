ROCKER CLUTCH ASSEMBLY<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	This invention relates to rocker clutches having selectively variable modes<br>
of operation.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	The prior art includes one-way clutches that are configured to prevent<br>
rotation of a first member relative to a second member in one direction, and to permit<br>
rotation of the first member relative to the second member in another direction.<br>
Vehicle powertrains may employ one-way clutches. For example, a one-way clutch<br>
may be implemented to transfer torque from an engine to the transmission, and to<br>
interrupt the transfer of reverse torque from the transmission to the engine. Prior art<br>
one-way clutches include roller-type clutches and sprag-type clutches.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]	A clutch assembly includes a first race defining a plurality of pockets, a<br>
second race being selectively rotatable with respect to the first race about an axis and<br>
defining a plurality of teeth, a plurality of springs, and a plurality rockers. Each of the<br>
rockers is at least partially positioned within a respective pocket, and is biased by one<br>
of the springs into engagement with the teeth.<br>
[0004]	A selector member is selectively axially translatable between a first<br>
position and a second position. In the first position, the selector member permits<br>
engagement of at least one of the rockers with the teeth. In the second position, the<br>
selector member prevents engagement of the at least one of die rockers with the teeth.<br>
Accordingly, the ability of the first rocker to transmit torque between the first and<br>
second races is controllable by moving the selector member.<br>
[0005]	The clutch assembly provided herein enables high packaging efficiency<br>
since the selectively variable torque carrying capacity is accomplished with a single pair<br><br>
GP-308908-PTT-DLT<br>
2<br>
of races. Furthermore, the axial translation of the selector member facilitates<br>
implementation of the clutch assembly into existing systems that may already have an<br>
axial actuator in place, such as a clutch piston.<br>
[0006]	The above features and advantages and other features and advantages of<br>
the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the<br>
best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0017]	Referring to Figure 1, a rocker clutch assembly 10 is schematically<br>
depicted. The rocker clutch assembly 10 may be used, for example, to control the torque<br>
transfer in an automatic transmission, a manual transmission, a hybrid vehicle, a dual<br>
clutch transmission, a transfer case, or an engine accessory drive. The rocker clutch<br>
assembly 10 includes a generally annular inner race 12 and a generally annular outer race<br>
14. The inner race 12 and the outer race 14 are coaxially positioned about an axis (shown<br>
at 16 in Figure 2a). A bushing 18 is preferably provided to pilot the outer race 14 as it<br>
rotates relative to the inner race 12. A selector member, such as selector ring 20, is<br>
positioned radially between the inner race 12 and the outer race 14. The rocker clutch<br>
assembly 10 also includes an apply plate 22 that is selectively translatable in an axial<br>
direction in order to cause axial translation of the selector ring 20.<br>
[0018]	The inner race 12 defines an inner surface 24 that is preferably splined to<br>
facilitate attachment to a shaft member (not shown). The outer surface 26 of the inner<br>
race 12 defines a plurality of pockets 28. The clutch assemly 10 also includes a first<br>
plurality of rockers 30A and a second plurality of rockers 30B. Rockers 30A, 30B are<br>
identical to each other except for their orientation. Each pocket 28 includes a respective<br>
recess (shown at 32 in Figure 2a) configured to retain a respective spring (shown at 34 in<br>
Figure 2a).<br>
[0019]	The outer race 14 defines an outer surface 36 that is preferably splined to<br>
facilitate attachment to a shaft member (not shown). The inner surface 38 of the outer<br>
race 14 defines a plurality of teeth 40. The teeth 40 define notches 41 therebetween.<br>
[0020]	The selector ring 20 defines a plurality of rectangular windows 42 and a<br>
plurality of L-shaped windows 44. Each of the windows 44 includes a narrow portion 46<br>
and a wide portion 48. More specifically, the narrow portions 46 have a smaller axial<br>
dimension than the wide portions 48. The selector ring 20 is characterized by portions<br><br>
GP-308908-PTT-DLT<br>
4<br>
50. Each of portions 50 partially define a respective narrow portion 46 and a respective<br>
wide portion 58.<br>
[0021]	The apply plate 22 has a radially outer surface 52 defining a plurality of<br>
teeth 54. The teeth 54 are configured to engage a complementary feature on an external<br>
member (not shown) such that the apply plate 22 is prevented from rotating about the<br>
axis. The apply plate 22 is operatively connected to the selector ring 20 such that axial<br>
movement of the plate 22 results in axial movement of the ring 20.<br>
[0022]	Referring to Figure 2a, wherein like reference numbers refer to like<br>
components from Figure 1, the outer race 14 is disposed concentrically around the inner<br>
race 12, such that the outer surface 26 of the inner race 12 is in juxtaposition with the<br>
inner surface 38 of the outer race 14, and such that the pockets 28 are open in the<br>
direction of the teeth 40. Each of the first plurality of rockers 30A and each of the second<br>
plurality of rockers 30B is partially disposed within a respective one of the pockets 28,<br>
and is biased by a respective spring 34 into engagement with the teeth 40. The outer race<br>
14 is selectively rotatable with respect to the inner race 12 about axis 16.<br>
[0023]	Referring to Figures 2a and 2b, the selector ring 20 is disposed radially<br>
between the inner race 12 and the outer race 14, and is depicted in a first position in<br>
which each window 42 is positioned such that a respective one of the first plurality of<br>
rockers 30A is extendable radially therethrough. When the ring 20 is in the first position,<br>
each wide portion 48 of windows 44 is positioned such that a respective one of the first<br>
plurality of rockers 30A is extendable radially therethrough. When the ring 20 is in the<br>
first position, each narrow portion 46 of the windows 44 is positioned such that a<br>
respective one of the second plurality of rockers 30B is extendable radially therethrough.<br>
Each of the first plurality of rockers 30A is extendable through one of the windows 42 or<br>
one of the wide portions 48. Each of the second plurality of rockers 30B is extendable<br>
through one of the narrow portions 46.<br>
[0024]	Referring to Figure 2c, wherein like reference numbers refer to like<br>
components from Figures 1 and 2a-b, a rocker 30A is depicted interacting with the inner<br>
race 12 and the outer race 14; the rocker 30A depicted in Figure 2c is representative of all<br>
of the first plurality of rockers 30A. Rocker 30A includes a body portion 70 and an<br><br>
GP-308908-PTT-DLT<br>
5<br>
engagement arm or pawl 72 protruding from the body portion 70. According to the<br>
preferred embodiment, the engagement arm 72 defines generally opposing first and<br>
second surfaces 76, 78, and a terminal end surface 80. Each pocket 28 includes a recess<br>
32 adapted to retain a spring 34. Each spring 34 extends from a respective recess 32 and<br>
engages a respective one of rockers 30A such that a portion of the rocker is biased into<br>
engagement with the teeth 40 of the outer race 14.<br>
[0025]	More specifically, spring 34 contacts surface 78, urging the engagement<br>
arm 72 radially outward toward the outer race 14 so that the engagement arm 72 engages<br>
the teeth 40. In the context of the present application, an engagement arm 72, or a rocker<br>
30A, 30B, engages teeth when a portion of the rocker or engagement arm is at a radial<br>
distance from the axis (shown at 16 in Figure 2a) sufficient to contact one of the teeth 40.<br>
In the embodiment depicted, spring 34 biases the engagement arm 72 sufficiently radially<br>
outward such that, absent a counteracting force, the engagement arm 72 extends into one<br>
of the notches 41 defined between the teeth 40.<br>
[0026]	Each rocker 30A is configured to permit rotation of the outer race 14 with<br>
respect to the inner race 12 about the axis 16 in a first direction and to prevent rotation of<br>
the outer race 14 with respect to the inner race 12 about the axis 16 in a second direction<br>
when the rocker 30A engages the teeth 40 of the outer race 14. In other words, rockers<br>
30A are configured not to transmit torque between the inner and outer races 12, 14 in the<br>
first direction, and to transmit torque between the races 12, 14 in the second direction.<br>
[0027]	More specifically, the rocker 30A is configured such that, if the outer race<br>
14 rotates counterclockwise relative to the inner race 12, one of the teeth 40 contacts<br>
surface 76 of the rocker 30A. The orientation of the surface 76, and the angle at which<br>
the tooth 40 contacts the surface 76, is such that the tooth 40 applies a force on the<br>
surface 76 that rotates the engagement arm 72 of the rocker 30A about a pivot axis 74<br>
away from the outer race 14, compressing the spring 34. The rotation of the engagement<br>
arm 72 permits the tooth 40 to slide across surface 76 during relative rotation of the outer<br>
race with respect to the inner race in the counterclockwise direction, and therefore<br>
rockers 30A do not prevent rotation of the outer race with respect to the inner race in the<br>
counterclockwise direction. Pivot axis 74 is parallel to axis 16.<br><br>
GP-308908-PTT-DLT<br>
6<br>
[0028]	Referring to Figure 2d, wherein like reference numbers refer to like<br>
components from Figures l-2c, rocker 30A is depicted with the engagement arm 72<br>
extending radially outward into notch 41. If the outer race 14 rotates clockwise with<br>
respect to the inner race 12, a tooth 40 contacts surface 80 of the engagement arm 72.<br>
The orientation of the surface 80, and the angle at which the tooth 40 contacts the surface<br>
80, is such that the tooth 40 applies a force on the surface 80, and surface 80 transmits a<br>
corresponding reaction force on the tooth, that prevents the outer race 14 from rotating<br>
with respect to the inner race 12 in the clockwise direction.<br>
[0029]	According to the preferred embodiment, the body portion 70 of each<br>
rocker 30A defines surfaces 90, 92 and 94. Surfaces 90 and 92 are both circular<br>
cylindrical surfaces whose arcs are concentric with the pivot center 74. The surfaces 90.<br>
92 are configured to guide rotation or pivoting of the rocker 30A about the pivot center<br>
74 and limit that pivoting to one degree of freedom.<br>
[0030]	When surface 80 is in contact with a tooth 40, as shown in Figure 2d, a<br>
reaction force is applied to surface 92 from the inner race 12, and there is preferably no<br>
reaction force applied to surface 90. Because the center of surface 92 is preferably<br>
located at the pivot center 74, this reaction force is distributed along surface 92 and<br>
produces no torque tending to pivot the rocker 30A about the pivot center 74. The<br>
surface 94 is configured to limit the rotation or pivoting of the rocker 30A in either the<br>
clockwise or counter clockwise direction. A center of mass 96 of the rocker 30A can be<br>
located in relation to the pivot center 74 such that centrifugal force tends either to engage<br>
or to disengage the rocker 30A, depending on whether the rocker 30A is mounted to the<br>
inner race 12 or the outer race 14.<br>
[0031]	Referring to Figure 2e, wherein like reference numbers refer to like<br>
components from Figures 1 -2d, rockers 30B are substantially identical to rockers 30A<br>
except for their orientation with respect to the inner and outer races 12, 14. More<br>
specifically, rockers 30B are oriented such that each rocker 30B permits rotation of the<br>
outer race 14 with respect to the inner race 12 in the second direction and prevents<br>
rotation of the outer race 14 with respect to the inner race 12 in the first direction when<br>
the rocker 30B engages the teeth 40 of the outer race 14. In other words, rockers 30B are<br><br>
GP-308908-PTT-DLT<br>
7<br>
configured not to transmit torque between the inner and outer races 12, 14 in the first<br>
direction, and to transmit torque between the races 12, 14 in the second direction when<br>
the rockers 30B are engaged with the teeth 40.<br>
[0032]	Spring 34 biases the engagement arm 72 of rocker 30B into engagement<br>
with the teeth 40 and into notch 41. If the outer race 14 rotates counterclockwise with<br>
respect to the inner race 12, one of the teeth 40 contacts surface 80 of the rocker 30B, and<br>
rotation of the outer race 14 in the counterclockwise direction with respect to the inner<br>
race 12 is prevented in the same manner that rockers 30A prevent rotation of the outer<br>
race 14 in the clockwise direction. If the outer race 14 rotates clockwise with respect to<br>
the inner race 12, the teeth 40 will contact surface 76 of the rocker 30B such that the<br>
rocker 30B pivots and permits the teeth 40 to slide acress surface 76, thereby permitting<br>
rotation of the outer race 14 in the clockwise direction with respect to the inner race 12.<br>
[0033]	Referring to Figures 3a and 3b, wherein like reference numbers refer to<br>
like components from Figures l-2e, the selector ring 20 is selectively translatable in the<br>
axial direction from the first position (shown in Figures 2a and 2b) to a second position<br>
shown in Figures 3a and 3b. Windows 42 and wide portions 48 are sufficiently wide in<br>
the axial direction such that rockers 30A extend therethrough when the ring 20 is in the<br>
second position. Accordingly, the selector ring 20 permits rockers 30A to engage the<br>
teeth 40 of the outer ring 14 in both the first and second positions, and therefore the<br>
function of the rockers 30A is identical when the ring is in the first and second positions.<br>
However, when the ring is in the second position, portions 50 of the ring 20 are<br>
positioned radially between each of rockers 30B and the outer race 14 to prevent<br>
engagement of the rockers 30B with the teeth 40 of the outer race 14.<br>
[0034]	More specifically, and with reference to Figure 3c, movement of the ring<br>
20 from the first to the second position causes portion 50 to contact surface 76 and<br>
counteract the bias of spring 34, thereby to pivot the rocker 30B out of engagement with<br>
the teeth 40 of the outer race 14. In other words, the ring 20 in the second position<br>
retains the rockers 30B in a retracted position in which no part of the rockers 30B extends<br>
sufficiently radially to contact or otherwise interact with the teeth 40 or the notches 41.<br><br>
GP-308908-PTT-DLT<br>
8<br>
[0035]	Accordingly, with the selector ring 20 in the second position, the rockers<br>
30A prevent the rotation of the outer race 14 in the clockwise direction, and rockers<br>
30B do not engage the teeth, thereby allowing the outer race to rotate in the<br>
counterclockwise direction relative to the inner race 12. The ability of the clutch<br>
assembly to convey torque between the first and second races in one direction is<br>
selectively variable by translating the selector member. Movement of the selector<br>
member 20 from the first position to the second position causes the torque carrying<br>
ability of the clutch assembly 10 to change from dual-directional to single-directional.<br>
[0036]	Other selector ring configurations may be employed within the scope of<br>
the claimed invention to vary the engagement of rockers 30A, 30B. For example, the<br>
windows of the selector ring may be configured such that axial translation of the ring<br>
between various positions results causes the clutch assembly 10 to lock-up in either<br>
direction (i.e., clockwise or counter clockwise), lock-up in both directions, or over-run in<br>
both directions within the scope of the claimed invention.<br>
[0037]	The illustrations and descriptions have demonstrated the rocker elements<br>
30A, 30B retained by and located at least partially within the inner race 12.<br>
Alternatively, and within the scope of the claimed invention, the rocker elements 30A,<br>
30B may be retained in pockets formed by the outer race 14 and engage teeth defined by<br>
the inner race 12.<br>
[0038]	Referring to Figure 4, wherein like reference numbers refer to like<br>
components from Figures 1-3, the clutch assembly 10 is schematically depicted installed<br>
in a vehicle 102 as part of a powertrain component 106, which may, for example, be a<br>
dual clutch transmission (DCT), hybrid powertrain, manual transmission, automatic<br>
transmission, engine accessory drive, etc. The inner race 12 is mounted with respect to a<br>
stationary member 112, such as a transmission housing, chassis frame, or vehicle body, to<br>
prevent rotation of the inner race 12 with respect to the stationary member 112. The<br>
outer race 14 is mounted with respect to a rotatable member for rotation therewith. In the<br>
embodiment depicted, the rotatable member is a member of a planetary gearset 1 16.<br>
[0039]	An actuator 124, such as a hydraulically-actuated piston, solenoid, etc., is<br>
mounted with respect to the stationary member 112 and is configured to selectively<br><br>
GP-308908-PTT-DLT<br>
9<br>
translate the selector ring 20 relative to the stationary member 112 in the axial direction<br>
between the first and second positions. The actuator 124 is operatively connected to the<br>
ring 20 via the apply plate (shown at 22 in Figure 1). A spring 128 operatively<br>
interconnects the stationary member 112 and the selector ring 20 to bias the selector ring<br>
in the first position. The ring 20 is prevented from rotating with respect to the stationary<br>
member 112, and therefore with respect to the inner race 12, such as by its connection to<br>
the apply plate (not shown in Figure 4), so that the windows of the ring 20 maintain their<br>
alignment with a respective rocker. The apply plate is mounted with respect to the<br>
stationary member, such as via the teeth (shown at 54 in Figure 1) so that the apply plate<br>
is axially translatable, but not rotatable with respect to the stationary member 112 and the<br>
inner race 12.<br>
[0040]	It should be noted that, if the actuator 124 is characterized by insufficient<br>
linear travel to move the selector ring 20 between the first and second positions, various<br>
linear travel amplifiers may be employed. In an exemplary embodiment, radially-<br>
oriented levers may interconnect the actuator and the ring. Alternatively, in place of a<br>
lever, a single slotted disk may be employed. The disk may also serve as a piston return<br>
spring if formed of an elastic material.<br>
[0041]	While the best modes for carrying out the invention have been described<br>
in detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will recognize various<br>
alternative designs and embodiments for practicing the invention within the scope of the<br>
appended claims.<br><br>

15. A clutch assembly comprising:<br>
an inner race; an outer race being concentrically disposed around the inner<br>
race and being selectively rotatable with respect to the inner race about an axis of<br>
rotation; one of said inner race and said outer race defining a plurality of pockets and the<br>
other of said inner race and said outer race defining a plurality of teeth;<br>
a plurality of springs;<br>
a first plurality of rockers, each of said first plurality of rockers being at<br>
least partially positioned within a respective one of said pockets, and each of said first<br>
plurality of rockers being biased by a respective one of said springs into engagement with<br>
said teeth to prevent rotation of the outer race with respect to the inner race in a first<br>
direction and permit rotation of the outer race with respect to the inner race in second<br>
direction;<br>
a second plurality of rockers, each of said second plurality of rockers<br>
being at least partially positioned within a respective one of said pockets, and each of said<br>
