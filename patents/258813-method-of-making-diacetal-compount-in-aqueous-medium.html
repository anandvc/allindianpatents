Applicant: RELIANCE INDUSTRIES LIMITED<br>
an Indian Company of 3rd Floor, Maker Chamber-IV, 222, Nariman Point, Mumbai 400 021,<br>

THE    FOLLOWING    SPECIFICATION    PARTICULARLY    DESCRIBES    THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
This invention relates to a method of producing alditol acetals in an aqueous ionic fluid.<br>
BACKGROUD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The acetal compound is the reaction product of an alditol and benzaldehyde. Alditol acetals, such as l,3:2,4-bis (4-methylbenzylidene) sorbitol (MDBS) and l,3:2,4-bis (3,4-dimethylbenzylidene) sorbitol (DMDBS) derivative compounds are known compounds which find their utility as an additive in polypropylene. Acetals of substituted and unsubstituted aldehydes are also known to be useful as nucleating agents, gelling agents, processing aids, and strength modifiers in polyolefin resins, polyester resins, deodorant, and antiperspirant compositions; hydrocarbon fuels and paints.<br>
Acetal alditols are typically prepared by the condensation reaction of an aromatic aldehyde with an alditol containing 6 carbon atoms like sorbitol. For MDBS and DMDBS structures, such reactions involve two moles of the aldehyde and one mole of an alditol.<br>
Several methods for the preparation of acetal alditols have been reported in US 4,267,110, US 3,721,682, US 4,429,140; US 4,562,265; US 4,902,807; US 5,023,354; US 5,731,474 and US 6,500,964.<br><br>
The hitherto reported methods suffer from several shortcomings. Majority of the earlier known processes employ various organic solvents which necessitates high temperature for carrying out the reaction thereby increasing the cost component. Furthermore, most of solvents are very expensive and they too render the process un-economical.<br>
Attempts have been made in the past to overcome the above mentioned shortcomings by employing the acidic catalyst for improving the yield and the versatility (ability to employs variety of substituted aldehydes) the process.<br>
The presently known processes for the preparation of acetals which employ acidic catalysts still suffer from several limitations. Though mineral acids serve as good catalysts for the acetalization process, they are very corrosive in nature. Furthermore, the final product resulting from such processes needs to be purified by neutralizing the residual free acid. Though the yields offered by all teachings are acceptable for the practical purposes, all the methods are not effective from the perspective of versatility, environmentally friendliness, energy efficient, reliability, cost-effective, and safe production.<br>
Ionic systems, which are examples of viscous molten salts, have a number of interesting and useful properties, and have utility, for example, as highly polar solvents, and catalyst in synthetic chemistry. They also have been found to be useful in applications in various fields such as electrochemistry, synthesis of chemical compounds, dyes,<br><br>
batteries, fuel cells, photovoltaic devices, electro-deposition processes, semi conductor cleaning, pyrolysis, gasification, in applications involving cellulose dissolution, for the electroplating of metals as described, for example in US Patent No. 6573405, US Patent No. 7183433, US Patent No. 7196221, US Patent Appl. No. 2005/0147889, US Patent No. 6527977, US Patent Appl. No.2008/0307703, US Patent Appl. No. 2006/0183654, US Patent Appl. No. 2009/0247432.<br>
Ionic compounds / liquids prepared from quaternary ammonium salt as one of the ions have been reported in US 5,892,124, US 5104840, US 6573405, US 7183433 and US 7196221. Ionic compounds / liquids made from choline chloride and metal salts in particular are also known.<br>
Ionic liquids exhibit very low or no vapour pressure and thus, in contrast to many conventional molecular solvents produce virtually no vapours. They are therefore advantageous from a health, safety and environmental point of view.<br>
Processes for preparation of acetals and di-acetals other than MDBS and DMDBS structures using ionic liquids as catalysts and/or reaction medium have been reported. For example, CN 101440025 discloses a method for preparation of ethylidene ether or ketal which employs N-methyl glyoxaline bisulphate ionic liquid catalyst. Other patents which disclose the use of ionic liquids  as catalyst for preparation of acetals other than<br><br>
MDBS and DMDBS structures include CN 101723852, CN 101544628 and CN 1858048.<br>
None of the hitherto reported processes for preparation of MDBS and DMDBS have employed ionic compounds / liquids as catalysts and/or reaction medium. There exists a need for process for preparation of MDBS and DMDBS which uses ionic compounds / liquids as the catalyst and or reaction medium. There also remains a need for a process for preparation of acetals, particularly MDBS and DMDBS which does not employ any expensive solvents and corrosive mineral acids.<br>

DESCRIPTION:<br>
In order to overcome the shortcomings of the hitherto reported processes which employ expensive solvents and corrosive mineral acid catalysts for the preparation of acetals, the inventors of the present invention have chosen the specific ionic fluids for the preparation of the acetals, particularly DMDBS and MDBS.<br>
Accordingly, in a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a process for preparation of acetal derivatives particularly, DMDBS and MDBS by dehydrocondensation reaction between an aldehyde and alditol using an aqueous ionic fluid which serves the dual role of a reaction catalyst and a reaction medium, comprising the following steps: -    preparing an aqueous ionic fluid;<br><br>
-	carrying out the dehydrocondensation reaction by adding an aldehyde and an alditol in a mole ratio of 2:1 in the ionic fluid under continuous stirring to form a reaction mixture;<br>
-	stirring the resultant reaction mixture to maintain the contents in a suspension form; and<br>
-	discontinuing the stirring of the reaction mixture to allow the mass formed in the reaction mixture to settle;<br>
-	isolating and purifying the mass by filtering, washing and drying to obtain an acetal derivative without any free acid residue present therein.<br>
The aqueous ionic fluid comprises an ionic compound formed from the hydrogen bonding between a hydrogen donor and a counter ion which catalyses the dehydrocondensation. Besides, it also serves as a reaction medium for carrying out the reaction. Typically, the method step of preparing an ionic fluid comprises adding a hydrogen donor and a counter ion providing compound independently in equimolar quantities to water leading to the in-situ formation of an ionic compound in water.<br>
Typically, the hydrogen donor is selected from the group consisting of at least one acid selected from the group consisting of methanesulfonic acid (MSA), para toluenesulfonic acid (PTSA), oxalic acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, maleic acid and tartaric acid. Typically, the counter ion providing compound is at least one selected from the group consisting of a quaternary ammonium salt and a metal salt. Typically, the quaternary<br><br>
ammonium salt is choline chloride. Typically, the metal salt is at least one selected from the group consisting of zinc chloride and sodium chloride.<br>
The counter ion providing compounds provide counter ion that are capable of forming a hydrogen bond in aqueous medium or aqueous-solvent mixture. The ionic compound formation by result of cations and anions connection by hydrogen bond were reported to have supramolecular structural organization (Olivier-Bourbigou, H., et al., Applied Catalysis A: General, 373, 1-56, 2010; Deetlefs, M., et al., J. Physical Chemistry B. 110, 12055-12061, 2006; Canongia Lopez, J. N. and Padua, A. A. H., J. Physical Chemistry B. 110, 3330-3335, 2006). The continuous microdomains structure formed due to the network of hydrogen bond seem to be favorable for catalytic reactions since acid is not available in free form and this will not impart any residual acidity to the final product.<br>
The aldehyde employed in the process of the present invention is at least one selected<br>
from the group consisting of unsubstituted benzaldehyde, and substituted aldehydes<br>
including benzaldehyde, 4-methylbenzaldehyde, 3-methylbenzaldehyde, 4-<br>
propylbenzaldehyde,        p-ethylbenzaldehyde        ,        4-butylbenzaldehyde,	4-<br>
lsopropylbenzaldehyde, 4-isobutylbenzaldehyde, 2,4-dimethylbenzaldehyde, 3,4-dimethylbenzaldehyde, 3,5-dimethylbenzaldehyde, 3-methyl-4-methoxybenzaldehyde, 2,4,5-trimethylbenzaldehyde, 3-hex-l-ynylbenzaldehyde, piperonal, 3-hydroxy-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2-naphthaldehyde,    3    -Methoxy-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2-naphthaldehyde,    3-<br><br>
Hydroxy-8-isopropy] -5 -methyl -2 -naphthal dehyde,	2 -naphthaldehy de,	3 -<br>
methoxybenzaldehyde, 4-methoxybenzaldehyde, 3,4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde, 3-<br>
ethoxybenzaldehyde, 4-ethoxybenzaldebyde, 3,4-diethoxybenzaldehyde, 4-<br>
allyloxybenzaldehyde, 4 - propoxybenzaldehyde, 4-carboxybenzaldehyde, 3-<br>
bromobenzaldehyde,       4-bromobenzaldehyde,	2-chlorobenzaldehyde,       3-<br>
chlorobenzaldehyde,        4-chlorobenzaldehyde,	3-fluorobenzaldehyde,        4-<br>
fluorobenzaldehyde, 3,4-dichlorobenzaldehyde, 3,5-dichlorobenzaldehyde, 3,5-<br>
dibromobenzaldehyde, 3,5-difluorobenzaldehyde, 4-chloro-3-fluorobenzaldehyde, 3-<br>
bromo-4-fluorobenzaldehyde	,	4-fluoro-3-methyl-,	5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2-<br>
naphthaldehyde, 4-fluoro-3,5-dimethylbenzaldehyde, 4-(trifluoromethyl)benzaldehyde, 3-bromo-4-ethoxybenzaldehyde and mixtures thereof.<br>
Typically, the alditol used in accordance with the process of the present invention is selected from the group consisting of sorbitol (100%), and iso-propyl sorbitol. Alternatively, an aqueous solution of sorbitol with a concentration in the range of about 40 % to about 99% is used as the alditol.<br>
One notable problem that is frequently encountered in the preparation of the acetals is solubility of the aldehyde component in water. According to the present invention, a quaternary ammonium salt which is capable of forming an ionic compound also serves as cationic surfactant/emulsifier to improve the solubility of reactant (aldehyde) in aqueous medium. Optionally, a surface active agent is added to the reaction mixture during the dehydrocondensation reaction. Typically, choline chloride is used as the<br><br>
surface active agent. Typically, the dehydrocondensatfon reaction is carried out at a temperature with a range of about 25 °C to about 50  C.<br>
Typically, the method step of stirring is carried out for a period in the range of about 6 to 10 hours.<br>
The inventors of the present invention have surprisingly found out that the product obtained by the process of the present invention was completely free of any residual free acid. The residual free acid in the product is highly undesirable since it promotes the hydrolysis of the end product at high temperature, especially during the drying process.<br>
The process of the present invention is therefore particularly advantageous since it obviates the need for neutralizing residual free acid in the end product thereby reducing the cost and complexity of the process. This demonstrates the utility of the ionic fluids as a catalyst and reaction medium to carry out the acid based dehydrocondensation reactions.<br>
The following examples further illustrate the present invention but are not to be construed as limiting the invention as defined in the clainis appended hereto.<br>
Example: 1<br>
Toluene-4-sulphonic acid monohydrate (PTSA), a hydrogen donor (1.9 gms) was mixed<br><br>
with choline chloride (1.4 gms) in equal mole ratio and water was added to the salt mixture and stirred well to prepare ionic fluid.<br>
3,4 dimethyl benzaldehyde and sorbitol in 2:1 mole ratio were added to the ionic compound and stirred to initiate the reaction. The solid mass formed within few minutes of starting the reaction. The stirring speed was increased to keep the mass in suspension condition and reaction was continued for 8 hrs. The solid product was filtered and washed with 100 ml methanol. The white solid product was dried in oven at 95°C for 2 hrs followed by air dried for 4 hrs for measuring the yield. The yield was found to be 60%.<br>
Example: 2-6<br>
The procedure of example 1 was followed for different hydrogen donor compounds as<br>
given in Table 1 with choline chloride.<br>
Example: 7-18<br>
The procedure of example 1 is followed for different hydrogen donors as given in Table<br>
2 and Table 3 with zinc chloride and sodium chloride respectively.<br>
Example: 19-21<br>
The procedure of example 1 was followed except, additional 0.01 moles of choline<br><br>
chloride was added to the water. The yield was found to be 69%. Similarly for PTSA -sodium and zinc chloride systems, the addition of 0.01 moles of choline chloride improved the yields.<br>
