				<td>TITLE: PHOSPHONIUM SALTS AND METHODS OF THEIR PREPARATION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to phosphonium salts<br>
and their methods of preparation.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Phosphonium salts may be used in a wide range of<br>
applications, including: as surfactants; as a component in<br>
spinning finish agents for aromatic polyamide fibers<br>
(JP11172577 A2, published June 29, 1999); as antimicrobial<br>
agents (Kanazawa et al. (1994) Antimicrobial Agents and<br>
Chemotherapy, vol. 38(5), p. 945-952 ); and as polar<br>
solvents known as "ionic liquids" (for a recent review, see<br>
Thomas Welton (Chem. Rev. 1999, 99, 2071-2083)).<br>
For many purposes, a phosphonium salt having a<br>
non-halide anion is desirable. Phosphonium non-halide salts<br>
can be prepared by a conventional two-step process,<br>
comprising the steps of (a) reacting a tertiary phosphine<br>
with an alkylhalide to obtain a quaternary phosphonium<br>
halide salt, and (b) exchanging the halide anion with a<br>
suitable anion (by ion exchange or metathesis) to generate a<br>
quaternary phosphonium salt having a non-halide anion.<br>
However, this two-step process has several<br>
drawbacks. For example, the alkylhalides used to quaternize<br>
the tertiary phosphine are expensive and some are corrosive<br>
and difficult to prepare and use. Also, the tertiary<br>
phosphine may be expensive or difficult to make, the<br>
preparation thereof sometimes involving several steps and<br>
starting materials that are expensive and pyrophoric (see<br>
for example Kanazawa et al., supra, and Hugh R. Hays,<br>
Org. Chem. Vol. 31, pp. 3871-3820, which describe methods<br>
for preparing trimethylalkylphosphonium halides) .<br>
In addition, the two-step process generates large<br>
amounts of waste, as salt or acid by-products are usually<br>
removed by washing with water. Thus, the two-step process<br>
is inconvenient on an industrial scale.<br>
Further, the end-product of the two-step process<br>
can be contaminated with residual halide ion, which may<br>
interfere with the intended utility of the phosphonium salt.<br>
For instance, halide ions such as chloride ions coordinate<br>
with group VII metals such as palladium and platinum and as<br>
a result, the presence of chloride ion can interfere with<br>
the activity of group VII metal catalysts. If a phosphonium<br>
salt is to be used in an environment where halide ions are<br>
unacceptable, even at low levels, halide salts should not be<br>
used in the starting materials or a further process must be<br>
used which ensures removal of halide ions from the<br>
phosphonium salt.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
In one aspect, the present invention provides a<br>
method of preparing a phosphonium salt, the method<br>
comprising reacting a compound of formula I:<br><br>
wherein R1 is hydrogen, R2 is hydrogen or hydrocarbyl, and R3<br>
is hydrocarbyl,<br>
with an ester compound defined by one of the following<br>
formulae:<br>
wherein each of R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9, and R10 is<br>
independently hydrocarbyl,<br>
to form a phosphonium salt of formula VII:<br>
wherein RQ is selected from R4 and R2 when R2 is hydrocarbyl,<br>
Rx is selected from R4 and R3, each of RY and Rz is<br>
independently R4, and X- is<br>
Some of the compounds of formula VII that can be<br>
prepared by the foregoing process are novel. Thus, in<br>
another aspect, the invention provides a compound of<br>
formula VII:<br>
wherein each of RQ, Rx, RY, and Rz is independently<br>
hydrocarbyl; and X- is<br>
wherein each of R7, R8, and R9 is defined as above,<br>
with the provisos that:<br>
(i) when X- is a phosphonate anion, then RQ, RX, RY,<br>
and RZ each has three or more carbon atoms;<br>
(ii) when X- is a sulfate then the sum of carbon<br>
atoms in RQ, RX, RY, and RZ is greater than 4; and<br>
(iii) when X- is methylsulfate, and one of RQ, Rx,<br>
RY, and Rz is methyl, the other of RQ, Rx, RY, and Rz cannot<br>
all be 2-cyanoethyl.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS:<br>
Figure 1 is a 1H-NMR (proton nuclear magnetic<br>
resonance) spectrum of a mixture of<br>
cyclohexyltrimethylphosphoniurn dimethylphosphate and<br>
dimethylphosphoric acid.<br>
Figure 2 is a 31P-NMR of a mixture of<br>
cyclohexyltrimethylphosphonium dimethylphosphate and<br>
dimethylphosphoric acid.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:<br>
In general, a phosphonium salt of formula VII can<br>
be prepared by reacting a phosphine of formula I<br>
(hereinafter referred to as the "starting phosphine") with<br>
an ester compound selected from the group consisting of: a<br>
phosphate triester of formula II; a phosphonate diester of<br>
formula III; a sulfate diester of formula IV; and a<br>
sulfonate ester of formula V. The overall reaction<br>
generates a quaternary phosphonium salt of formula VII and<br>
an acid counterpart of the ester (i.e. phosphoric acid,<br>
phosphonic acid/ sulfuric acid, or sulfonic acid,<br>
respectively).<br>
In one embodiment, the current method may be used<br>
for preparing a phosphonium of formula VII that has one or<br>
more methyl groups (i.e. one, two, three, or four methyl<br>
groups) attached to the phosphorus atom.<br>
The current method may be especially suitable for<br>
preparing" compounds of formula VII that are substantially<br>
free of halide ions.<br>
In general, when the starting phosphine is a<br>
primary phosphine or a secondary phosphine, the ester is<br>
present in about three-fold or two-fold molar excess,<br>
respectively, relative to the starting phosphine, so as to<br>
provide roughly stoichiometric amounts of reagents.<br>
Specifically, when the starting phosphine is a primary<br>
phosphine (i.e. has a one hydrocarbyl group and two<br>
hydrogens attached to the phosphorus atom), the ester is<br>
present in about 3-fold molar excess of ester relative to<br>
starting phosphine. When the starting phosphine is a<br>
secondary phosphine (i.e. has two hydrocarbyl groups and<br>
one hydrogen attached to the phosphorus atom), the ester is<br>
present in about 2-fold molar excess of ester relative to<br>
starting phosphine. However in some cases, yields may be<br>
improved by using an excess of ester, for example in the<br>
range of about 1.05 to about 3.0 fold excess relative to the<br>
stoichiometry of the overall reaction and preferably about<br>
1.1 to about 1.2 fold excess relative to the stoichiometric<br>
amount.<br>
The temperature of the reaction is not critical<br>
and may range from about room temperature to about 2 60°C or<br>
higher, although lower temperatures will result in longer<br>
reaction times. In general, the reaction proceeds readily<br>
at elevated temperature, say between about 80°C to about<br>
220°C, preferably in the range of 100-190°C, and is often<br>
complete in 8 hours at these temperatures.<br>
However, as R4 groups on the ester increase in size<br>
(i.e. steric bulk), the reaction may become less efficient<br>
and higher temperatures or longer reaction times may be<br>
necessary to increase yield. Therefore, suitable values for<br>
R4 include but are not limited to: methyl, ethyl, n-propyl,<br>
isopropyl, n-butyl, iso-butyl, and tert-butyl. Certain<br>
esters, such as dimethyl-sulfate, are very active alkylating<br>
reagents and may be used for reactions carried out at<br>
moderate temperatures.<br>
Also, the properties of the starting phosphine may<br>
affect the overall rate of the reaction. Secondary<br>
phosphines tend to be more reactive than primary phosphines.<br>
Thus, in general, reactions involving primary phosphine are<br>
carried out at higher temperatures or for longer times or<br>
both than are counterpart reactions involving secondary<br>
phosphines.<br>
The starting phosphine can be added directly to an<br>
ester (a phosphate triester, a phosphonate diester, a<br>
sulfate diester, or a sulfonate ester), with stirring.<br>
However, the overall reaction is exothermic. Therefore, in<br>
order to control the temperature of the reaction mixture, it<br>
may be desirable to control the rate of addition in some<br>
cases and perhaps also to apply external coolirig during the<br>
addition step. In addition, since alkylphosphines may be<br>
pyrophoric, it may be desirable to control the rate of<br>
addition of mono- or di-alkylphosphine so as to avoid having<br>
a large amount of unreacted mono- or di-alkylphosphine<br>
present in the reaction mixture, especially when the<br>
reaction is being carried out at elevated temperatures, for<br>
example over 100°C.<br>
When the starting phosphine is a liquid at the<br>
temperature to be used for carrying out the reaction, the<br>
pressure of the reaction is not critical, and the reaction<br>
may be conveniently carried out at atmospheric pressure,<br>
under an inert atmosphere, such as nitrogen. Some primary<br>
and secondary phosphines that have short chain alkyl groups<br>
(such as dimethylphosphine) have low boiling points and may<br>
be gaseous and the temperature to be used for carrying out<br>
the reaction. When the starting phosphine is a gas at the<br>
temperature to be used for carrying out the reaction, the<br>
reaction is suitably carried out under pressure (e.g. in an<br>
autoclave) under an inert atmosphere, such as nitrogen.<br>
The reaction can be carried out in the absence of<br>
solvent, in order to avoid a further step of purifying<br>
product away from solvent. However, the reaction may also<br>
be carried out in the presence of a solvent. In some cases,<br>
the presence of a solvent may be preferred as the solvent<br>
may enhance the rate at which the reaction proceeds.<br>
If desired, any unreacted starting materials may<br>
be removed, for example, by evaporating under vacuum.<br>
The method of the invention produces a mixture of<br>
phosphonium salt and acid which may be used directly, for<br>
example as a solvent for chemical reactions. Alternatively,<br>
the mixture of phosphonium salt and acid may be subjected to<br>
purification steps to isolate the phosphonium salt. For<br>
example, dimethylphosphoric acid and methyl hydrogen sulfate<br>
can be removed from the reaction mixture by evaporation, for<br>
example under vacuum at elevated temperatures<br>
(dimethylphosphoric acid decomposes at 172-176°C, and methyl<br>
hydrogen sulfate decomposes at 130-140°C; see Handbook of<br>
Chemistry and Physics, 57th Edition, CRC Press, Inc.,<br>
copyright 1976, pages C-435 and C-508). Alternatively, the<br>
acid product can be removed by neutralizing the acid with a<br>
hydroxide of a Group II metal (i.e. an alkaline earth metal<br>
hydroxide, such as calcium hydroxide or barium hydroxide) to<br>
form a precipitate and recovering the precipitate by<br>
suitable means, such as filtration. Of note, calcium<br>
dimethylphosphate, a chemical that finds utility in<br>
polyester fibre processing (JP2001164461), can be prepared<br>
by the foregoing process. If the phosphonium salt forms a<br>
two-phase system when mixed with water, it may be possible<br>
to remove acid by washing the phosphonium salt with water.<br>
Other purification processes known in the art, such as<br>
chromatography, can also be used to purify the phosphonium<br>
salt from the reaction mixture.<br>
Suitable hydrocarbyl groups for RQ, Rx, RY, Rz, R2,<br>
R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9, and R10 include: substituted or<br>
unsubstituted C1-C30 alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted C3-C8<br>
cycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted C2-C30 alkenyl,<br>
substituted or unsubstituted C2-C30 alkynyl, substituted or<br>
unsubstituted C6-C18 aryl, or substituted or unsubstituted<br>
C7-C35 aralkyl, although hydrocarbyl groups with not more<br>
than 20 carbon atoms are preferred. R2 and R3 together with<br>
the phosphorus atom to which R2 and R3 are bonded can form a<br>
five- to eight-membered heterocycle or a heterobicycle, such<br>
as 9-phosphabicyclo [3.3.1]nonane. It is noted that R2 and R3<br>
can be perfluoroalkyl. It is possible for the R groups (RQ,<br>
Rx, Ry, Rz, R2 and R3 when not perfluoroalkyl and R4 to R10) to<br>
bear substituents, or to include heteroatoms, provided that<br>
the substituents or heteroatoms do not interfere with the<br>
preparation of the compounds of the invention, and do not<br>
adversely affect the desired properties of the compound.<br>
Acceptable substituents may include alkoxy, halo, carboxy,<br>
and acetyl, and heteroatoms that may be acceptable include<br>
nitrogen, oxygen and sulphur. Substituents are likely to<br>
increase the cost of the compounds of the invention and as<br>
the compounds are often used in industrial applications (as<br>
solvents, surfactants, etc.)/ they are used in such volume<br>
that cost is a significant factor. Hence, it is<br>
contemplated that, for the most part, substituents will not<br>
be present, except for compounds in which one or more of R2<br>
and R3 is perfluoroalkyl. If necessary, one of skill in the<br>
art can readily determine whether substituents or heteratoms<br>
of the hydrocarbyl groups interfere with preparation or<br>
desired properties of the compounds by routine<br>
experimentation that does not involve the exercise of any<br>
inventive faculty.<br>
In many cases, RQ, Rx, RY, Rz, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7,<br>
R8, R9, and R10 will be substituted or unsubstituted alkyl<br>
groups of 1 to 20 carbon atoms. Thus, specific examples of<br>
values for R°, Rx, Ry, Rz, R2, R3, r4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9, and<br>
R10 include: methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl,<br>
iso-butyl, tert-butyl, n-pentyl, cyclopentyl, isb-pentyl,<br>
n-hexyl, cyclohexyl, norbornyl, 3-methylphenyl<br>
(2, 4, 4'-trimethyl)pentyl, cyclooctyl, tetradecyl, etc. R2 and<br>
R3 can also be trifluoromethyl.<br>
Mention is made of the following examples of<br>
values for R2 and R3: methyl, trifluoromethyl, ethyl,<br>
n-propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, iso-butyl, tert-butyl,<br>
cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, and norbornyl, and the case where R2<br>
and R3 together with the phosphorus atom to R2 and R3 are<br>
bonded form 9-phosphabicyclo[3.3-1]nonyl.<br>
Mention is made of the following examples of<br>
values for R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9, and R10: methyl, ethyl,<br>
n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, iso-butyl, and tert-butyl. It<br>
is noted that R10 can also be p-toluenyl. Examples of<br>
suitable esters for use in the inventive method include but<br>
are not limited to: trimethylphosphate, dimethylsulfate,<br>
dimethylmethanephosphonate, and methyltosylate.<br>
Phosphonium cations in which RQ, Rx, RY, and Rz are<br>
not identical are referred to as "asymmetric". In some<br>
cases, it is desired that RQ, Rx, RY, and Rz shall not be<br>
identical and in particular, that at least one of RQ, Rx, RY,<br>
and Rz shall contain a significantly higher number of carbon<br>
atoms (for example 14 to 20 carbon atoms) than the others of<br>
RQ, Rx, RY, and Rz.<br>
For some applications, it is desired that at least<br>
one of RQ, Rx, RY, and Rz shall contain a low number of carbon<br>
atoms (for example 1 to 3 carbon atoms, more preferably 2<br>
carbon atoms, and even more preferably one carbon atom).<br>
For example, one, two, three or all of RQ, Rx, RY, and Rz can<br>
be methyl. Phosphonium salts with a low carbon content, say<br>
between 5 to 12 carbon atoms, may find utility as ionic<br>
liquids or electrolytes in cases where a high ratio of<br>
charge to molecular weight is required.<br>
Phosphonium salts that may be used as surfactants<br>
include those in which three of RQ, RX, RY, and Rz are each<br>
independently methyl or ethyl, preferably methyl, and the<br>
other is a saturated hydrocarbyl having an unbranched chain<br>
of a higher number of carbon atoms, say 12 to 30 carbon<br>
atoms, more preferably 12 to 20 carbon atoms. By a<br>
4<br>
"surfactant" we mean a surface-active agent that reduces<br>
surface tension when dissolved in water or water solutions,<br>
or that reduces interfacial tension between two liquids, or<br>
between a liquid and a solid. Surfactants include<br>
detergents, wetting agents, and emulsifiers. Surfactants<br>
may form micelles. The hydrocarbyl chain on the phosphonium<br>
may bear substituents that do interfere with intended<br>
utility of the compound as a surfactant, including but not<br>
limited to fluoro.<br>
In some cases, it is preferred that at least one<br>
of RQ, Rx, RY, Rz or R5 to R10 contains a higher number of<br>
carbon atoms, for example 14 or more. For example, the<br>
presence of one or more long alkyl chains may increase the<br>
ability of a phosphonium salt to dissolve nonpolar organic<br>
compounds. In addition, the presence of one or more long<br>
alkyl chains may render the phosphonium salt "water<br>
immiscible".<br>
Compounds according to formula VII that are<br>
hydrophobic or "water immiscible" are preferred for some<br>
purposes. The term "water immiscible" is intended to<br>
describe compounds that form a two phase system when mixed<br>
with water but does not exclude compounds that dissolve in<br>
water nor compounds that will dissolve water, provided that<br>
the two phase system forms. Water immiscibility is a<br>
desirable feature of a phosphonium salt not only because it<br>
renders the compound useful as a solvent for biphasic<br>
reactions with an aqueous phase, but also because it<br>
facilitates purification and isolation of the phosphonium<br>
salt when prepared according to certain methods. By way of<br>
illustration, when the method of the invention produces a<br>
water-immiscible phosphonium salt and an acid, the acid can<br>
be removed from the reaction products by washing the<br>
phosphonium salt with water. Compounds of formula VII that<br>
have a large total number of carbons, say equal to or<br>
greater than 20 and in particular greater than 25 or 26, or<br>
have at least one aryl group are more hydrophobic. There is<br>
no critical upper limit on the total number of carbon atoms<br>
that may be present in a compound of formula VII. However,<br>
it is unlikely that the total will exceed 50.<br>
If the compound of formula VII is intended for use<br>
as a solvent, then in general, it is preferred that the<br>
compound is a liquid below 100°C, more preferably below 50°C,<br>
and most preferably at or below room temperature. Values<br>
for RQ, Rx, Ry, Rz, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9, and R10 can<br>
be selected to yield compounds that are liquid at room<br>
temperature. Increasing the total number of carbon atoms<br>
present in the hydrocarbyl groups RQ, Rx, RY, Rz, and R2 to R10<br>
will tend to increase the melting point, although this<br>
effect can be counteracted somewhat by asymmetry, branching<br>
of the hydrocarbyl groups RQ, Rx, RY, Rz, and R2 to R10, and<br>
the tendency of sterically bulky ions to coordinate poorly.<br>
Specifically, the melting point tends to decrease as the<br>
degree of asymmetry around the phosphorus atom increases.<br>
Also, the melting point of the salt will tend to decrease as<br>
the degree of branching of the hydrocarbyl groups RQ, Rx, RY,<br>
Rz, and R2 to R10 increases. Branching can occur at the alpha<br>
or omega carbon or at any intermediate point. In addition,<br>
the melting point of the salt will tend to decrease as<br>
steric bulk increases around either or both of the<br>
phosphorus atom of the cation and the central atom of the<br>
anion (the sulfur atom or phosphorus atom or carbon atom);<br>
for this reason, it may be preferred for one or more of R<br>
groups on either or both of the cation and anion (i.e. RQ,<br>
Rx, RY, Rz, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9, and R10) to have three or more<br>
carbon atoms.<br>
Thus, the current invention contemplates compounds<br>
of formula VII where properties may be modified by varying<br>
the values of the R groups present on either the anion or<br>
the cation. Selection of particular values for RQ, Rx, RY,<br>
Rz, and R2 to R10 to achieve particular melting points,<br>
degrees of water immiscibility, or surfactant properties is<br>
within the competence of a person skilled in the art,<br>
although it may require some routine experimentation.<br>
Compounds according to formula VII that have<br>
chirality provide a chiral environment for chemical<br>
reactions and may be especially suitable for certain<br>
purposes, such as a reaction having an asymmetric or chiral<br>
transition state that can be stabilized by interaction with<br>
a suitable solvent. Examples of chiral compounds of formula<br>
VII include compounds containing a phosphonium cation<br>
wherein RQ, Rx, RY, and Rz, are all different or wherein one<br>
of RQ, Rx, RY, and Rz, is an enantiomer, such as<br>
2,4,4'-trimethylpentyl, which group has one chiral atom.<br>
Mention is made of the following examples of<br>
compounds of formula VII:<br>
cyclohexyltrimethylphosphonium dimethylphosphate;<br>
dibutyldimethylphosphonium dimethylphosphate;<br>
dicyclohexyldimethylphosphonium dimethylphosphate;<br>
and<br>
diisobutyldimethylphosphonium dimethylphosphate.<br>
Phosphonium salts described herein may find<br>
utility in a wide range of applications. For example,<br>
phosphonium salts in which three of RQ, Rx, RY, and Rz are<br>
methyl and the other is a saturated or unsaturated<br>
hydrocarbyl having an unbranched chain of a higher number of<br>
carbon atoms, say 12 to 30 carbon atoms, may find utility as<br>
antimicrobial agents (Kanazawa, supra) or surfactants.<br>
Phosphonium phosphates may find utility as a component of<br>
spinning finish (JP11172577). The phosphonium salts of the<br>
current invention may also be used as polar solvents known<br>
as "ionic liquids" for chemical reactions such as Michael<br>
additions, aryl coupling, Diels-Alder, alkylation, biphasic<br>
catalysis, Heck reactions, hydrogenation, or for enzymatic<br>
reactions, for example lipase reactions (for a recent review<br>
of ionic liquids, see Thomas Welton (Chem. Rev. 1999, 99,<br>
2071-2083)).<br>
EXAMPLES:<br>
In the following examples, starting material<br>
phosphines are made by Cytec Canada, Inc. and their purity<br>
determined by gas chromatography (GC). The remaining<br>
starting materials were purchased from Aldrich and used as<br>
they were purchased. Structures were confirmed by NMR<br>
(nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry) and by FAB MS<br>
(Fast Atom Bombardment mass spectrometry), as indicated.<br>
Example 1:<br>
Preparation of cyclohexyltrimethylphosphonium<br>
dime thylphosphate<br>
Cyclohexylphosphine (14.5 g, 98%, 0.1255 mole) was<br>
added by dripping through an addition funnel over a period<br>
of 10 minutes to a flask containing trimethylphosphate<br>
(95 g, 97%, 0.6578 mole, b.p. 197°C) preheated to 140°C under<br>
nitrogen, with stirring. There was no sudden change in<br>
temperature associated with addition. The mixture was<br>
heated to reflux (about 165°C) .<br>
As the reaction proceeded, the temperature of the<br>
mixture gradually increased to 210°C and was maintained at<br>
this temperature with stirring for 15 minutes. The total<br>
reaction time was about 8 hours.<br>
The reaction mixture was then cooled and decanted<br>
into a flask. Excess trimethylphosphate was removed from<br>
the reaction mixture by heating to 180°C under vacuum 5mm Hg.<br>
The product was a glassy, colourless liquid with a<br>
pH of about 2-3 pH units. The presence of<br>
cyclohexyltrimethylphosphonium dimethylphosphate and<br>
dimethylphosphoric acid was confirmed by 1H (see Figure 1),<br>
13C, and 31P (see Figure 2) NMR and FAB MS analysis. 1H-NMR<br>
(CDCl3, 300.13HZ, 5) signals for the characteristic methyl<br>
groups are: 1.96 (d, J=14.2 Hz, P-CH3), 3.62 (d, J=10.8 Hz,<br>
O=P-O-CH3) ; 31P-NMR (CDCl3, 81.015 Hz, 5): 30.60 (P4) , 1.63<br>
(O=P-O-CH3) -<br>
Example 2:<br>
Preparation of dibutyldimethylphosphonium dimethylphosphate<br>
A 500 ml 2 neck round-bottomed flask fitted with a<br>
condenser was charged with 108.0 g (0.77 mole)<br>
trimethylphosphate and heated to 135°C under nitrogen with<br>
stirring. Di-n-butylphosphine (93.2 g, 0.64 mole) was added<br>
to the flask over a period of 8 hours. The temperature of<br>
the contents of the flask increased to 155°C during the<br>
addition of a first 6.6 g of the total 93.2 g of<br>
di-n-butylphosphine. The reaction was maintained at 150°C<br>
for 2 hours.<br>
Following the incubation period, unreacted<br>
trimethylphosphate was removed by evaporation for 6 hours at<br>
100°C under reduced pressure (20 mmHg).<br>
A colourless and viscous liquid (180.7 g) was<br>
obtained. 31P, 13C and 1H NMR and FAB MS confirmed the<br>
presence of dibutylphosphonium dimethylphosphate and<br>
dimethylphosphoric acid. 2H-NMR (CDCl3, 300.13 Hz, 6)<br>
signals for the characteristic methyl groups are: 1.65 (d,<br>
J=13.8 Hz, P-CH3), 3.20 (d, J=10.6 Hz, O=P-O-CH3) ; 31P-NMR<br>
(CDCl3, 81.015 Hz, 8): 30.36 (P+) , 2.06 (O=P-O-CH3).<br>
Example 3:<br>
Preparation of dicyclohexyldimethylphosphonium<br>
domethylphosphate<br>
A round-bottomed flask fitted with a condenser was<br>
charged with 280.3 g (1.9 mole) trirnethylphosphate and<br>
heated to 100°C under nitrogen with stirring.<br>
Dicyclohexylphosphine (277.-2 g, 1.4 mol) was gradually added<br>
to the flask over a period of 7.5 hour. The reaction was<br>
exothermic, with the temperature of the contents of the<br>
flask rising rapidly to 150-160°C during the addition of<br>
dicyclohexylphosphine. The reaction mixture was maintained<br>
at a temperature of 150-160°C for 2 hours, then cooled to<br>
room temperature.<br>
Upon cooling to room temperature, the product<br>
crystallized into a clear, colourless solid. Unreacted<br>
trimethylphosphate was removed by evaporation under reduced<br>
pressure (5 mmHg) at 170°C for 12 hour.<br>
Analysis by 31P and 3H NMR and MS confirmed the<br>
presence of dicyclohexyldimethylphosphonium<br>
dimethylphosphat-e and dimethylphosphoric acid. 1H-NMR<br>
(CDCl3, 300.13 Hz, 5) signals for the characteristic methyl<br>
groups are: 1.76 (d, J=13. Hz, P-CH3) , 3.39 (d, J=10.6 Hz,<br>
O=P-0-CH3); 31P-NMR (CDCl3, 81.015 Hz, 5): 34.48 (P+) , 2.28<br>
(O=P-O-CH3).<br>
Example 4:<br>
Preparation of diisobutyldimethylphosphonium<br>
dimethylphosphate<br>
A round-bottomed flask was charged with 136.0 g<br>
(0.96 mole) trimethylphosphate and heated to 140°C under<br>
nitrogen with stirring. While stirring vigorously, a<br>
solution of 70.3 g (0.48 mol) diisobutylphosphonium and<br>
11.0 g of dimethylcarbonate were added to the flask over a<br>
period of 2.5 hours at 135°C. The reaction was exothermic<br>
during the addition of the phosphine. The reaction mixture<br>
was maintained at 135°C for a total of 8 hours, then cooled<br>
room temperature. 31P, 1H, and 13C NMR analyses confirmed the<br>
presence of the diisobutyldimethylphosphonium<br>
dimethylphosphate and dimethylphosphoric acid.<br>
