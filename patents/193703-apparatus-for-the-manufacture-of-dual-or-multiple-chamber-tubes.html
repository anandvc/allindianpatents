The invention relates to an apparatus for manufacturing dual- or multiple-chamber tubes.<br>
Various apparatus for the manufacture of single-chamber tubes are known using mandrels adapted to be assigned to a plurality of working stations, a tube body being slid onto the mandrels in at least one working station, and being connected in fixed relationship to a prefabricated or moulded tube head in further stations.<br>
A need exists to provide two-chamber tubes or multiple-chamber tubes utilizing prefabricated tube bodies partitioning the tube body in the tube, interior into two or more longitudinal chambers, parallel to one another, by means of one or a plurality of partitions.<br>
No apparatus for the manufacture of multiple-chamber tubes are known at present utilizing a prefabricated tube body comprising one partition or a plurality of partitions.<br>
A need has been recognized to provide a means for the manufacture of dual-chamber tubes or multiple-chamber tubes by means of a prefabricated tube body.<br>
The present invention provides an apparatus for the manufacture of dual- or multiple-chamber tubes from tube bodies, provided with a tube head with a closeable discharge aperture and with a mandrel disposed in the tube body longitudinally characterized in that : the mandrel is divided into sectional mandrels with a gap therebetween for at least one partition deflectably fixed to the tube inner wall, said sectional mandrels correspond to the number of chambers provided and have a cross section that correspond to the chamber cavity ; at least one auxiliary mandrel coaxially positioned in relation to one of said sectional<br><br>
-3-<br>
mandrels for receiving a tube body, wherein said auxiliary mandrel comprises at least one axially oriented rebate opened towards the periphery ; and a device for moving at least one section of the deflectable partition into said rebate and for pushing the tube body from said auxiliary mandrel onto said at least one mandrel.<br>
Preferably, at least one auxiliary mandrel is a solid body having a cross-section corresponding to the cross-section of one of the chambers of the multiple chamber tubes and said rebate corresponds to the remaining cross-sections of the multiple chamber tube The device for moving one section of the partition into the rebate comprises a vacuum source capable of being turned off. Each gap, taken at right angles to its longitudinal extension, has a rectilinear, curved or an S-shaped cross-section Preferably, at least one sectional mandrel in relation to the other sectional mandrels is so disposed as to be displaceable axially and parallel in relation to one another The sectional mandrel is provided in a stationary manner on a support means The support means is preferably pivotally mounted The sectional mandrel, in at least one plane comprises projections reducing the cross-section of the gap between them and directed in opposition to one another. Preferably, at least one sectional mandrel comprises a duct system provided with discharge apertures directed towards the gap and the periphery, the duct system being connected to a vacuum source, capable of being turned off. In an embodiment, at least one auxiliary mandrel comprises a system of ducts linked to discharge apertures terminating in the rebate.<br>
The use of individual sectional mandrels, leaving a gap between one another, the respective sectional mandrels having a cross-section which in each case corresponds to the cross-section of the cavity on an individual chamber of the desired dual-chamber or multiple-chamber tube, makes it possible to apply the prefabricated tube bodies with partitions onto the mandrels comprising<br><br>
-4-<br>
sectional mandrels, the appropriate partition(s) being introduced into the gap(s). The tube body with a partition positioned in this manner is then provided with a tube head in one or more working steps This is performed preferably by press moulding or transfer moulding or even by injection moulding, partition webs in the heads and connections of the partition webs to the partitions being simultaneously likewise produced during the moulding process<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The invention is further elucidated in the following by way of working examples with reference to the accompanying drawings There are shown in<br>
Figure 1	a mandrel consisting of two sectional mandrels,<br>
Figure 2	a section along line ll-ll of Figure 1,<br>
Figure 3	an auxiliary mandrel with a tube body in a schematic illustration,<br>
Figure 4a : a cross-section along line IV-IV of Figure 3, the partition being<br>
flush with the periphery of the tube body,<br>
Figure 4b the same as in Figure 4a, the partition, however, being flush with<br>
the rebate in the auxiliary mandrel,<br>
Figure 5	the cross-section of a mandrel consisting of three identical<br>
sectional mandrels for a three-compartment tube comprising chambers of .<br>
equal sizes,<br>
Figure 6	the cross-section of a mandrel consisting of three sectional<br>
mandrels for a three-chamber tube comprising one larger and two smaller<br>
chambers<br>
In the embodiment shown in Figure 1, a mandrel consisting of two sectional mandrels 3, 4 is provided by means of a support means 2 on a transport means 1 which may e g be a revolving plate, a rotary drum, a turntable, a transport chain or the like, the said mandrel with its outer contour<br><br>
-5-<br>
corresponding to the inner contour of a dual-chamber tube, including head region, to be manufactured A gap 5 is provided between both sectional mandrels 3, 4 serving to accommodate a partition 7 to be provided inside the tube body 6. The gap 5 may be of curved cross-section, for example S-shaped as illustrated in Figure-2, or it may be rectilinear (see Figure-6), or rectilinear sections in angular relationship (see Figure-5) or it may be optionally designed in rectilinear and curved sections (not shown)<br>
Preferably, a sectional mandrel 4 is provided on the support means 2 in fixed relationship while the other sectional mandrel 3 is provided movably parallel to the sectional mandrel 4, the said support means in turn being preferably pivotably mounted, e g for further operations, and optionally being adapted to be driven. The sectional mandrels 3, 4 comprise projections 8, preferably directed in opposition to one another serving to reduce the passing-through cross-section of the gap 5 in a cross-sectional plane. If both partial mandrels 3 and 4 abut against the support means 2, that is to say not displaced relative to one another, the projections 8 are in one plane. Preferably, the projections are rounded at their tips and have a cross-section similar to a bell curve facilitating the sliding-in of a partition 7 when being inserted into the gap 5 At least one sectional mandrel 3 or 4 comprises ducts 9 terminating by way of discharge apertures 1-0 at the outer circumference of the appropriate sectional mandrel 3 or 4 and/or towards the gap 5 (both not shown). The ducts 9 may also be provided in all existing sectional mandrels 3 and 4, 17a-c, 21a,b and are adapted to be connected to a vacuum source, not shown, adapted to be switched off. The duct system serves to hold the positioned tube body 6 in position at its periphery and/or in relation to its partition during shifting with the movable sectional mandrel 3 or in its final position on the mandrel, in particular during transport and/or further processing steps<br><br>
-6-<br>
If the tube bodies 6 are provided with a relatively rigid, free-standing partition 7, the tube body 6, by means of an appropriate means, preferably likewise comprising a rotation means, may be aligned coaxially in relation to the sectional mandrels 3, 4 in such a manner that the dividing wall 7 fixed to the tube body 6 comes to rest opposite the gap 5 between the sectional mandrels 3,,4 By means of a slider 11, schematically illustrated in Figure-3, the aligned tube body 6 can then be pushed onto the sectional mandrels 3, 4, the partition 7 thereby entering the gap 5.<br>
If a relatively rigid partition material is employed, the two sectional mandrels 3, 4 may remain in their original position at the support means 2, i e they may both also be provided in fixed relationship on the support means 2 The entry into the gap 5 may then preferably also be designed slightly funnel-like or conically (not illustrated), for an easier insertion of the partition 7.<br>
In the case of relatively thin to very thin partitions 7, it is advantageous to design at least one sectional mandrel 3, as described above, movable to and fro axially and parallel to the other sectional mandrel 4. In the case of more than two sectional mandrels, a plurality of sectional mandrels, extendable preferably to various distances, may be provided. In a position of the sectional mandrels 3, 4 are displaced in relation to one another, as shown in Figure-1, the projections 8 are likewise displaced in relation to one another, thereby enlarging there in each case the available cross-section of the gap 5 as compared with their position directly opposite to one another so that the partition 7 in conjunction with the rounded-off sections of the projections 8 can be inserted into the gap 5 more easily. If the sectional mandrel 3 of Figure-1 is then shifted back to the right into its one terminal position, the projections 8 of both sectional mandrels 3, 4 are in one plane thereby forming a guidance and also a support for the partition 7 where it adjoins the head region.<br><br>
-7-<br>
If a partition web or, where applicable, a plurality of partition webs (not shown) is/are to be manufactured separately or simultaneously with the actual tube head (not shown) by its/their connection to the partition 7 or partitions 18, 19 Figure-5 , 20 Figure-6 by molten synthetic resin, the entry region of the gap_5, preferably up to the projections 8, may have a greater open cross-section than the gap 5 behind the projections 8. This also permits the adaptation of the thickness of the partition web/webs in the head and its or their connection to the partition 7 or a plurality of partitions in the tube body 6 within a wide range. In the condition where the two projections 8 are directly opposite to one another, the cross-section of each gap 5 between the projections 8 is preferably so calculated that the spaced apart relationship of the projections 8 exceeds the thickness of the partition 7 of the tube body, 6 only slightly so that the projections 8 define the mould cavity for the partition web to be moulded-on during manufacture of the partition webs.<br>
If a provided partition 7 is very soft and/or very thin and thus also very flexible, an auxiliary mandrel 12 (see Figures 3 and 4) is preferably assigned to the apparatus for receiving a tubular body 6 having a partition 7. Each auxiliary mandrel 12 has a cross-section corresponding to the configuration of one of the chambers, preferably the largest chamber in the case of differently sized chambers, of a dual-chamber tube or a multiple-chamber tube Each auxiliary mandrel 12 comprises a rebate 13 extending over its entire length, corresponding in cross-section to the cross-section of the respective other chamber or all further chambers. The auxiliary mandrel is preferably designed as a solid body in which a system of ducts 14 is provided which may comprise different passage cross-sections over its length, distributed preferably over the cross-section, provided with bored passages 15, distributed both over the cross-section and the length, all terminating in the rebate 13. The ducts 14 and therefore also the bored passages 15 are adapted to be connected to a vacuum source (not shown), in which case a<br><br>
-8-<br>
vacuum may be brought about in the rebate 13 in order to suck the partition 7 (see Figure-4a) abutting against the tube wall 6 in the original state, into the rebate 13, the partition 7 in the final state bearing directly against the auxiliary mandrel 12 (see Figure-4b) In the case of thin partitions electro-static attraction may be applied instead of the vacuum<br>
The above described aligned application of the tubular body 6 onto the auxiliary mandrel 12 must ensure that the partition 7, or at least a desired portion thereof, may move freely into the rebate 13 in contact therewith.<br>
The auxiliary mandrel 12, including the sucked on partition 7, or the sucked on partition portion respectively, is already or will be so aligned in relation to the sectional mandrels 3, 4 that the partition 7, position fixed in the rebate 13, comes to rest opposite the gap 5 between the sectional mandrels 3, 4. The tube body 6 is then pushed onto the sectional mandrels 3, 4 by the slider 11 While being pushed on, the sectional mandrels 3, 4 assume the position, displaced to one another, as shown in Figure-1 so that the thin partition 7 may readily enter the gap 5 past the projections 8. If the tube body 6 with its front end abuts against a stop 16 (Figure-2) on the movable sectional mandrel 3, the advancing of the slider 11 (Figure-2) is stopped and, if applicable, the duct system of the sectional mandrel 3 is connected to a vacuum source thus fixing the tubular body 6 to the sectional mandrel 3 The sectional mandrel 3 is then moved into its final position abutting against the support means 2. A positional fixation may then also be performed via the sectional mandrel 4 if the latter is likewise connected to a vacuum source. In the positionally-fixed position the tube body 6 is passed to one or more further working stations where the manufacture of partition webs takes place separately or simultaneously with the head as well as the connection takes place of the partition web to the partition, the partition webs to the partitions as the case may be as well as to the optionally prefabricated head including the optionally<br><br>
-9-<br>
prefabricated partition webs and the tube body - optionally also in a plurality of individual or partial step.<br>
In Figure-5 three sectional mandrels 17a, b, c are illustrated, the tube body 6 comprising a partition 18, provided at an angle, both ends of the said partition 18 fixed to the tube body 6' and comprising a connecting partition 19, fixed on the one hand in the apex of the partition 18, provided at an angle, and to the tube body 6' on the other hand. In the embodiment according to Figure-5 three sectional mandrels of the same size and therefore also compartments are illustrated.<br>
In the embodiment according to Figure-6 two partitions 20 are designed as secants to the round cross-section of a tube body 6" fixed at a common point to the tube body 6" The sectional mandrels 21a, b in turn have cross-sections corresponding to the intended compartment cross-sections.<br>
In such multi-compartment tubes the tube body 6', 6" becomes relatively dimensionally stable due to the disposition of the partitions 18,19,20 in th latter, so that the auxiliary mandrel may possibly be dispensed with. In as far as an auxiliary mandrel is used, its cross-section should preferably correspond to the cross-section of the largest chamber<br>
The apparatus may also be used for the purpose of initially disposing prefabricated separate partitions in a gap, or, where applicable, in a plurality of provided gaps, for which purpose the gaps may for example be as illustrated and/or described above. The partitions in that case comprise sidewings (not shown) projecting from the mandrels, preferably deflected at the location where they exit from the mandrel or comprise a flange there so that they lie as flush as possible against the outer wall of the mandrel. This may also be performed by a separate pressing on or moulding on means<br><br>
-10-<br>
Onto such a mandrel provided with separately manufactured partitions a separate tube body - without partition or partitions is then pushed on in such a manner that the wings abut closely to the inner tube wall.<br>
The connection to a head and to partition webs is carried out in the above described manner If the wings are sufficiently wide, in particular if the individual components to be accommodated in the chambers cannot be mixed or can only be mixed with difficulty and/or if their separation from one another is not absolutely necessary, a connection of the wings to the tube wall in fixed relationship, separating the chambers from one another in sealing relationship, may be dispersed with. Appropriate connection means may, however, also be provided in the sectional mandrels, for example for welding the wings to the tube body by supplying contact heat, e g. by means of appropriate metal parts heated by HF and provided in the sectional mandrels opposite the wings.<br>
The tube bodies may be manufactured from any suitable material from one or more synthetic resins, from laminated material, also with blocking layers of metal or synthetic material by an overlap seam or by extrusion There is also no restriction regarding the material for the partitions.<br>
The vacuum may also be so controlled, in particular in the auxiliary mandrels 12, that a successive suction and thus also a successive entering into contact of the partition 7 takes place over the cross-section of the rebate 13.<br>
The claims which follow are to be considered an integral part of the present disclosure. Reference numbers (directed to the drawings) shown in the claims serve to facilitate the correlation of integers of the claims with illustrated features of the preferred embodiment(s), but are not intended to restrict in any way the language of the claims to what is shown in the drawings, unless the contrary is clearly apparent from the context<br><br>
