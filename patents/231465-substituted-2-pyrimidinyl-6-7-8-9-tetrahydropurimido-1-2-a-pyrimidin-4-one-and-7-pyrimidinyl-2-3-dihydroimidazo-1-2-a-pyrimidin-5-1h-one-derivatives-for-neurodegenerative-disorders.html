SPECIFICATION<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to compounds that are useful as an active<br>
ingredient of a medicament for preventive and/or therapeutic treatment of<br>
neurodegenerative diseases caused by abnormal activities of GSK3β alone or by<br>
the combined effects of GSK3β and cdk5/p25.<br>
Background Art<br>
GSK3β (glycogen synthase kinase 3β) is a proline directed serine,<br>
threonine kinase that plays an important role in the control of metabolism,<br>
differentiation and survival. It was initially identified as an enzyme able to<br>
phosphorylate and hence inhibit glycogen synthase. It was later recognised that<br>
GSK3β was identical to tau protein kinase 1 (TPK1), an enzyme that<br>
phosphorylates tau protein in epitopes that are also found to be<br>
hyperphosphorylated in Alzheimer's disease and in several tauopathies.<br>
Interestingly, protein kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation of GSK3β results in a loss of<br>
its kinase activity, and it has been hypothesised that this inhibition may mediate<br>
some of the effects of neurotrophic factors. Moreover, phosphorylation by GSK3β<br>
of β-catenin, a protein involved in cell survival, results in its degradation by an<br>
ubiquitinilation dependent proteasome pathway.<br>
Thus, it appears that inhibition 01 GSK3β activity may result in neurotrophic<br>
activity. Indeed there is evidence that lithium, an non-competitive inhibitor of<br>
GSK3β, enhances neuritogenesis in some models and also increases neuronal<br>
survival, through the induction ot survival factors such as Bcl-2 and the inhibition<br>
of the expression of proapoptotic factors such as P53 and Bax.<br>
Recent studies have demonstrated that β-amyloid increases the GSK3β activity<br><br>
and tau protein phosphorylation. Moreover, this hyperphosphorylation as well as<br>
the neurotoxic effects of p-am/loid are blocked by lithium chloride and by a<br>
GSK3β antisense mRNA. These observations strongly suggest that GSK3β may<br>
be the link between the two major pathological processes in Alzheimer's disease:<br>
abnormal APP (Amyloid Precursor Protein) processing and tau protein<br>
hyperphosphorylation.<br>
Although tau hyperphosphorylation results in a destabilization of the neuronal<br>
cytoskeleton, the pathological consequences of abnormal GSK3P activity are,<br>
most likely, not only due to a pathological phosphorylation of tau protein because,<br>
as mentioned above, an excessive activity of this kinase may affect survival<br>
through the modulation of the expression of apoptotic and antiapoptotic factors.<br>
Moreover, it has been shown that p-amyloid-induced increase in GSK3β activity<br>
results in the phosphorylation and, hence the inhibition of pyruvate<br>
dehydrogenase, a pivotal enzyme in energy production and acetylcholine<br>
synthesis.<br>
Cdk5/p25, also known an tau protein kinase 2 (TPK2), is a proline<br>
directed, Ser/Thr kinase essential for central nervous system development and in<br>
particular for neuronal migration and neurite outgrowth. Cdk5 is a homologue of<br>
cyclin-dependent kinases and rather ubiquitously expressed. Its activator p35 (a<br>
305 aa protein) or a truncated form p25 (208 aa, missing an N-terminal proline-<br>
rich domain not required for activity) are selectively expressed in neurons, limiting<br>
cdk5 kinase activity essentially to the CNS. Cdk5 is completely inactive in the<br>
absence of p35 or p25. The term cdk5/p25 will be used here for the active<br>
enzyme since evidence exists suggesting that p25 and less so p35 may be<br>
involved in pathological processes.<br>
Physiological substrates of cdk5/p25 include DARPP-32, Munc-18, PAK1,<br>
synapsin 1 and perhaps some otners. In addition, it is now well established that<br>
cdk5/p25 phosphorylates tau protein epitopes which are hyperphosphorylated in<br>
Alzheimer's disease. More recently, elevated cdk5/p25 activity, mislocalization of<br>
cdk5 and an increase in p25 activator has been found in the brain of Alzheimer<br>
patients. Interestingly, prephosprorylation of tau protein by cdk5/p25 considerably<br>
enhances phosphorylation of tau by GSK3β on other epitopes, also found<br><br>
hyperphosphorylated in Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, neurofibrillary tangly<br>
hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, are labelled with antisera for GSK3β and cdk5,<br>
but not GSK3α and MAP kinase, also, GSK3β and cdk5 are associated with<br>
microtubules and both, more than PKA and CK, contribute to the AD-like<br>
phosphorylation of tau protein. These results taken together suggest that mixed<br>
inhibitors of GSK3β and cdk5/p25 should efficient in protecting tau protein from<br>
hyperphosphorylation. Therefore, they would be useful in the treatment of any<br>
pathological disorder associated with the abnormal phosphorylation of tau protein,<br>
in particular Alzheimer's disease, but also other tauopathies (e.g.<br>
frontotemporoparietal dementia, corticobasal degeneration, Pick's disease,<br>
progressive supranuclear palsy).<br>
Cdk5/p25 has been linked to apoptosis and neurodegeneration in more<br>
general terms. Its overexpression induces apoptosis in cultured neurons, in brain<br>
tissue apoptotic cells show strong immunoreactivity for cdk5. Neurotoxic agents,<br>
incl. Ap(1-42), neuronal injury, ischemia or growth factor withdrawal lead to<br>
activation and mislocalization of cdk5/p25, abnormal phosphorylation of cdk5<br>
substrates, cytoskeletal disruption and cell death. Moreover, phosphorylation by<br>
cdk5/p25 transforms DARPP-32 into an inhibitor of protein kinase A, reducing<br>
signal transduction in the striatum with obvious implications for Parkinson's<br>
disease. A role for cdk5 in ALS has also been proposed based on its ability to<br>
phosphorylate neurofilaments. More recently, deregulation of cdk5 was detected<br>
in a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.<br>
Altogether, these experimental observations indicate that GSK3β inhibitors may<br>
find application in the treatment of the neuropathological consequences and the<br>
cognitive and attention deficits associated with Alzheimer's disease, as well as<br>
other acute and chronic neurodegenerative diseases. These include, in a non-<br>
limiting manner, Parkinson's disease, tauopathies (e.g. frontotemporoparietal<br>
dementia, corticobasal degeneration, Pick's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy) and other dementia including vascular dementia; acute stroke and others<br>
traumatic injuries; cerebrovascular accidents (e.g. age related macular<br>
degeneration); brain and spinal cord trauma; peripheral neuropathies;<br>
retinopathies and glaucoma.<br><br>
In addition GSK3β inhibition may find application in the treatment of other<br>
diseases such as:<br>
Non-insulin dependent diabetes (such as diabetes type II ) and obesity; manic<br>
depressive illness; schizophrenia; alopecia; cancers such as breast cancer, non-<br>
small cell lung carcinoma, thyroid cancer, T or B-cell leukemia and several virus-<br>
induced tumors.<br>
Since it appears that both, GSK3β and cdk5/p25 play a major role in the induction<br>
of apoptosis in neuronal cells, combined inhibition of these two enzymes may find<br>
application in the treatment of not only Alzheimer's disease and the other above-<br>
mentioned tauopathies, but also in a number of other neurodegenerative<br>
disorders, in particular Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis;<br>
other dementias including vascular dementia; acute stroke and other traumatic<br>
injuries; cerebrovascular accidents (e.g. age related macular degeneration); brain<br>
and spinal cord trauma; peripheral neuropathies; retinopathies and glaucoma.<br>
In addition mixed TPK1/TPK2 innibitors may find their applications in the<br>
treatment of other diseases such as : smoking cessation and other withdrawal<br>
syndromes, epilepsy.<br><br>

As a further object, the present invention concerns also methods for preparing the<br>
compounds represented by the aforementioned formula (I).<br>
These compounds can be prepared, for example, according to methods explained<br>
below.<br><br>
Preparation method<br>
Pyrimidone compounds represented by the aforementioned formula (I)<br>
may be prepared according to scheme 1.<br><br>
The pyrimidin-5(1H)-one derivative represented by the above formula (III),<br>
wherein R1 is as defined for compound of formula (I), is allowed to react with a<br>
base such as sodium hydride, sodium carbonate or potassium carbonate in a<br>
solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide, N-methylpyrrolidine, N,N-<br>
dimethylacetamide or chloroform at a suitable temperature ranging from 0 to<br>
130°C under ordinary air, then with a compound of formula (II), wherein R2, X, Y<br>
and n are as defined for compound of formula (I) and L represents a leaving group<br>
preferably bromide or mesyloxy group, is added to obtain the compound of the<br>
aforementioned formula (I).<br>
Compound of formula (II) are commercially available or may be<br>
synthesised according to wel-known methods of one skilled in the art. The<br>
compound of formula (III) may be prepared according to the method defined in<br>
scheme 2.<br><br><br>
(In the above scheme the definition of R1, R3, R4, R5, p and m are the<br>
same as already described.)<br>
According to this method, the 3-ketoester of formula (IV) is allowed to react with a<br>
compound of formula (V). The reaction may be carried out in the presence of<br>
potassium carbonate, in an alcoholic solvent such as methanol, ethanol and the<br>
like or without, at a suitable temperature ranging from 25°-140°C under ordinary<br>
air.<br>
Alternatively, compounds, of formula (III) wherein R5 represents a hydrogen<br>
atom may be halogenated in order to give compounds of formula (III) wherein R5<br>
is a halogen atom such as a bromine atom or a chlorine atom.<br>
The reaction may be carried out in an acidic medium such as acetic acid or<br>
propionic acid, in presence of bromosuccinimide or chlorosuccinimide, or bromine.<br>
In addition, compounds of formula (III) wherein R5 represents a fluorine<br>
atom may be obtained by analcgy to the method described in Tetrahedron<br>
Letters, Vol.30,N°45,pp6113-6116, 1989.<br>
Compounds of formula (V) or (IV) are commercially available or may be<br>
synthesised according to well-Known methods of one skilled in the art.<br>
For example compounds of formula (IV), wherein R1 represent a pyrimidine ring<br>
optionally substituted by a C1-4 alkyl group, C1-4 alkoxy group or a halogen atom,<br>
can be prepared by reacting a pyrimidine-4-carboxylic acid optionally substituted<br>
by a C1-4 alkyl group, C1-4 alkoxy group or a halogen, with a malonic acid<br><br>
monoester. The reaction can be carried out using methods well known to one<br>
skilled in the art, such as for example in presence of a coupling agent such as<br>
1,1'-carbonylbis-1H-imidazole in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran at a<br>
temperature ranging from 20 to 70°C.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) may also be obtained starting from another<br>
compound of formula (I) using well-known methods of one skilled in the art.<br>
In the above reactions protection or deprotection of a functional group<br>
may sometimes be necessary. A suitable protecting group Pg can be chosen<br>
depending on the type of the functional group, and a method described in the<br>
literature may be applied. Exanples of protecting groups, of protection and<br>
deprotection methods are given for example in Protective groups in Organic<br>
Synthesis Greene et al., 2nd Ed. (John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York).<br>
The compounds of the present invention have inhibitory activity against<br>
GSK3β or GSK3β and cdk5/p25. Accordingly, the compounds of the present<br>
invention are useful as an active ingredient for the preparation of a medicament,<br>
which enables preventive and/or therapeutic treatment of a disease caused by<br>
abnormal GSK3β or GSK3β and cdk5/p25 activity and more particularly of<br>
neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. In addition, the<br>
compounds of the present invention are also useful as an active ingredient for the<br>
preparation of a medicament for preventive and/or therapeutic treatment of<br>
neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral<br>
sclerosis, tauopathies (e.g. frontotemporoparietal dementia, corticobasal<br>
degeneration, Pick's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy) and other dementia<br>
including vascular dementia; acute stroke and others traumatic injuries;<br>
cerebrovascular accidents (e.g. age related macular degeneration); brain and<br>
spinal cord trauma; peripheral neuropathies; retinopathies and glaucoma; and<br>
other diseases such as non-insulin dependent diabetes (such as diabetes type II)<br>
and obesity; manic depressive illness; schizophrenia; alopecia; smoking cessation<br>
and other withdrawal syndromes, epilepsy; cancers such as breast cancer, non-<br>
small cell lung carcinoma, thyroid cancer, T or B-cell leukemia and several virus-<br><br>
induced tumors.<br>
The present invention further relates to a method for treating<br>
neurodegenerative diseases caused by abnormal activity of GSK3β or GSK3β and<br>
cdk5/p25 and of the aforementioned diseases which comprises administering to a<br>
mammalian organism in need thereof an effective amount of a compound of the<br>
formula (I).<br>
As the active ingredient of the medicament of the present invention, a<br>
substance may be used which is selected from the group consisting of the<br>
compound represented by the aforementioned formula (I) and pharmacologically<br>
acceptable salts thereof, and solvates thereof and hydrates thereof. The<br>
substance, per se, may be administered as the medicament of the present<br>
invention, however, it is desirable to administer the medicament in a form of a<br>
pharmaceutical composition which comprises the aforementioned substance as.<br>
an active ingredient and one or more pharmaceutical additives. As the active<br>
ingredient of the medicament of the present invention, two or more of the<br>
aforementioned substances nray be used in combination. The above<br>
pharmaceutical composition may be supplemented with an active ingredient of<br>
another medicament for the treatment of the above mentioned diseases. The type<br>
of pharmaceutical composition is not particularly limited, and the composition may<br>
be provided as any formulation for oral or parenteral administration. For example,<br>
the pharmaceutical composition may be formulated, for example, in the form of<br>
pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration such as granules, fine<br>
granules, powders, hard capsules, soft capsules, syrups, emulsions, suspensions,<br>
solutions and the like, or in the form of pharmaceutical compositions for parenteral<br>
administrations such as injections for intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous<br>
administration, drip infusions, transdermal preparations, transmucosal<br>
preparations, nasal drops, inhalants, suppositories and the like. Injections or drip<br>
infusions may be prepared as powdery preparations such as in the form of<br>
lyophilised preparations, and may be used by dissolving just before use in an<br>
appropriate aqueous medium such as physiological saline. Sustained-release<br><br>
preparations such as those coated with a polymer may be directly administered<br>
intracerebrally.<br>
Types of pharmaceutical additives used for the manufacture of the<br>
pharmaceutical composition, content ratios of the pharmaceutical additives<br>
relative to the active ingredient, and methods for preparing the pharmaceutical<br>
composition may be appropriately chosen by those skilled in the art. Inorganic or<br>
organic substances, or solid or liquid substances may be used as pharmaceutical<br>
additives. Generally, the pharmaceutical additives may be incorporated in a ratio<br>
ranging from 1 % by weight to 90% by weight based on the weight of an active<br>
ingredient.<br>
Examples of excipients used for the preparation of solid pharmaceutical<br>
compositions include, for example, lactose, sucrose, starch, talc, cellulose,<br>
dextrin, kaolin, calcium carbonate and the like. For the preparation of liquid<br>
compositions for oral administration, a conventional inert diluent such as water or<br>
a vegetable oil may be used. The liquid composition may contain, in addition to<br>
the inert diluent, auxiliaries such as moistening agents, suspension aids,<br>
sweeteners, aromatics, colorants, and preservatives. The liquid composition may<br>
be filled in capsules made of an absorbable material such as gelatin. Examples of<br>
solvents or suspension mediums used for the preparation of compositions for<br>
parenteral administration, e.g. injections, suppositories, include water, propylene<br>
glycol, polyethylene glycol, benzyl alcohol, ethyl oleate, lecithin and the like.<br>
Examples of base materials used for suppositories include, for example, cacao<br>
butter, emulsified cacao butter, lauric lipid, witepsol.<br>
The dose and frequency of administration of the medicament of the<br>
present invention are not particularly limited, and they may be appropriately<br>
chosen depending on conditions such as a purpose of preventive and/or<br>
therapeutic treatment, a type of a disease, the body weight or age of a patient,<br>
severity of a disease and the like. Generally, a daily dose for oral administration<br>
to an adult may be 0.01 to 1,000 mg (the weight of an active ingredient), and the<br>
dose may be administered once a day or several times a day as divided portions,<br>
or once in several days. When the medicament is used as an injection,<br><br>
administrations may preferably be performed continuously or intermittently in a<br>
daily dose of 0.001 to 100 mg (the weight of an active ingredient) to an adult.<br>
