				<td>The present invention relates to a process for optical resolution of racemic 1-<br>
arylethyl acetates using soil bacteria strain Pseudomonas fluorescens RRLJ 134 in<br>
presence of surfactant.<br>
The fluorescent Pseudomonads are well known as bacterial biocontrol agent and<br>
have been utilized for a diverse range of soil borne diseases. The Pseudomonas<br>
fluorescens RRLJ 134 is an organism isolated from the top soil of a tea plantation in<br>
north-east India and identified through various morphological, physiological and<br>
biochemical tests. The strain showed in vitro antibiosis (fungal pathogen control) against<br>
Fusarium and Fomes spp (B S Dileep Kumar. I Berggren and A M Martensson. Plant<br>
and Soil. 2001. 229. 25). In addition P. fluorescens RRLJ 134 organism showed growth<br>
promoting activity by enhancing shoot length, root length, seed germination and yield of<br>
the crop (B S Dileep Kumar and B Bezbantah, Indian J Microbiology. 1996. 36, 45).<br>
Further, it exhibited bio-control of plant diseases by controlling the fusarial wilt of pea.<br>
However the fluorescent Pseudomonads, despite their enormous potential have received<br>
scant attention in bio-transformation reactions.<br>
Reference may be made to M Torimura, H Yoshida, K Kano, T Ikeda, T<br>

Still another reference may be made to H Idogaki, N Kasa, M Tekeuchi, M Hatada, &amp; T Suzuki, Tetrahedron: Asymmetry, 2001, 12, 369, wherein the hydrolytic activity of Pseudomonas sp DS-K-19 was increased 20 folds compared to additive free medium by addition of 0.2% v/v 4-chloro-3-acetoxybutyronitrile.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to employ Pseudomonas fluorescens RRLJ 134 strain for optical resolution of racemic 1-aryl ethylacetate.<br>
Another objective  of the  present  invention  is  to  study the  effect of surfactant in enantioselective resolution compared to surfactant free medium, by addition of surfactant.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the optical resolution of racemic 1-aryl ethylacetate into an enantiomerically pure S-(-)-l-arylethylacetates in presence of surfactant Tween-80 [polyoxyethylene(20) sorbitan monooleate],<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein Ar is Ph or p-tolyl; which comprises : a bio-organic transformation reaction of R/S-1-arylethyl acetate characterized in that with indigenous soil microbe Pseudomonas fluorescens RRLJ 134 in succinate media in presence of surfactant Tween-80 in shaking incubation for 36 h at 28-30°C to afford S(-)-l-arylethyl acetate and R(+)-1-arylethanol in high enantiomeric excess.<br>
The process involves the use of Pseudomonas florescens RRLJ 134 strain, grown in King's B medium broth, to inoculate in succinate media containing substrate and biosurfactant and then keeping it in a shaking incubator at an ambient temperature at a constant rotation. The starin is obtained from the top soil of a tea plantation in Doars region of West Bengal, India. The biological material is deposited at MTCC Division of IMT, Chandigarh on 29-11-2005.<br>
In the first step of the resolution process, Pseudomonas fluorescens RRLJ 134 strain, maintained in nutrient agar slants (Plant Pathologist's Book, 1968, Commonwealth Mycological Institute, Surrey, KEW, England, p-267) was grown in King's B medium broth (E.O. King, M K Wood &amp; D E Raney. J Lab Clin Med, 1954, 44, 301). In 15 sets of 250 ml conical flask, 100 ml of succinate media (J M Meyer &amp; M A Abdallah, J Gen Microbiol, 1978,107,319) was taken in each flask to which 2 ml (0.7 mmol) melhanolic solution of (RS) -phenylethyl acetate and 0.5 ml of 18h old inoculum of Pseudomonas  fluorescens    RRU 134    strain grown in King's B medium, were added.<br>
The reaction was<br>
kept in shaking incubation temperature (28-30°C) for 36 hr. The reaction broth were<br>
extracted with ethyl acetate, washed with water, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate to<br>
obtain the products which were isolated by preparative silica gel TLC and identified as<br>
S(-)phenylethyl acetate and R(+)phenyl ethanol. The optical rotation and enantiomeric<br>
excess (ee) of the products showed for R(+)phenylethyl acetate [a]D<br>
2s +10° and ee 30 %<br>
and S(-)phenylethanol [cc]D<br>
25 -8° and ee 20 %.<br>
In the second step, the resolution process of (RS)-phenylethylacetate was carried<br>
in presence of 10 rag of surfactant Tween-80. In 15 sets of 250 ml conical flask, 100 ml<br>
of succinate media was taken in each flask to which 2 ml (0.7 mmol) methanolic solution<br>
phenylethyl acetate, 10 mg of Tween-80 and 0.5 ml of the of 18h old inoculum of<br>
Pseudomonas fluorescens RRLJ 134 strain grown in King's B medium, were added. The<br>
reaction was kept in shaking incubation temperature (28-30°C) for 36 hr. The reaction<br>
broth were extracted with ethyl acetate, washed with water, dried over anhydrous sodium<br>
sulfate and solvent removed to obtain the products which were isolated by preparative<br>
silica gel TLC and identified as S(-)phenylethyl acetate and R(+)phenyl ethanol. The<br>
optical rotation and enantiomeric excess (ee) of the products showed for S(-)phenylethyl<br>
acetate [a]D2s -86° and ee 92% and R(+)phenylethanol [a]D<br>
25 +19° and ee 77%.<br>
In the third step, the resolution process of (RS)-phenylethylacetate was carried in<br>
presence of 20 mg of surfectant Tween-80. In 15 sets of 250 ml conical flask, 100 ml of<br>
succinate media was taken in each flask to which 2 ml (0.7 mmol) methanolic solution<br>
phenylethyl acetate, 20 mg of Tween-80 and 0.5 ml of the 18 h old strain grown in King's<br>
B medium, were added. The reaction was kept in shaking incubation temperature (28-<br>
30°C) for 36 hr. The reaction broth were extracted with ethyl acetate, washed with water,<br>
dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and solvent removed to obtain the products which<br>
were isolated by preparative silica gel TLC and identified as S(-) phenylethyl acetate and<br>
R(+)phenyl ethanoL The optical rotation and enantiomeric excess (ee) of the products<br>
showed for S(-)phenylethyl acetate [a]D<br>
25 -64° and ee 80% and R(+) phenylethanol [a]D<br>
25<br>

5. The enantiomeric excess of the R(+)-arylethyl alcohol could also be achieved in<br>
optimum resolution.<br>
6. Protic solvents like methanol and ethanol can be employed for the preparation of<br>
substrate solution.<br><br><br><br>
We claim:<br>
1.	A  process  for the preparation of enantiomerically pure S-(-)-l-arylethylacetates<br>
which comprises : a bio-organic transformation reaction of R/S-1-arylethyl acetate characterized in that with indigenous soil microbe Pseudomonasfluorescens RRLJ 134 in succinate media in presence of surfactant Tween-80 (polyoxyethylene(20) sorbitan monooleate), incubating for 36 hour at 28-30°C to obtain S(-)-l-arylethyl acetate.<br>
2.	A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein succinate media composition per litre at Ph 7<br>
contains, succinic acid 4.0 gm, ammonium sulfate 1.0 gram„potassium dihydrogen phosphate<br>
3.0 gram, potassium monohydrogen phosphate 0.1 gram, ammagnesium sulfate heptahydrate<br>
02 gram.<br>
3.	A process for the preparation of enantiomerically pure S-(-)-l-arylethylacetates<br>
substantially as herein described with reference to examples accompanying this<br>
specification.<br></td>
