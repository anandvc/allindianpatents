				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a process for preparation of polymeric adsorberris, by precipitation polymerization, more particularly it relates to the process for the preparation of adsorbents selective for phenolic compounds.<br>
Phenolic compounds such as phenol, p- nitrophenol, 2,4 and 2,6-dinitrophenol, isomers of bisphenol A etc. are many a time present in aromatic compounds as trace impurities (e.g. phenol in anisole or nitrophenols in nitrober.zene, o,p- bisphenol in bisphenol-A). These impurities lead to problems in down stream processing of these chemicals. Aromatics containing phenolic impurities when undergo catalytic oxidation / reduction reactions, phenols if present can form tarry products, which poison / deactivate the catalyst. Hence for enhancing the catalyst life as well as for better economics of the process it is necessary to remove phenolic impurities from aromatics. Another necessity for removal of phenol arises from the improvement in quality that is desirable for any product.<br>
Phenolic impurities can be removed from aqueous streams using a variety of methods such as adsorption, distillation, and solvent extraction. These methods are commonly used on industrial scale as well and have been discussed in the literature.<br>
Various kinds of adsorbents are used to achieve the same goal. The adsorbents used for removal of phenolic compounds can be either inorganic or organic in nature. The inorganic adsorbents used for such applications are silicas and zeolites where as commonly used organic adsorbents are polymeric in nature.<br>
There are two kinds of polymeric adsorbents in common use for removal of phenolic compounds. These are crosslinked styrene - divinylbenzene resins (Amberlite XAD - 2, 4) marketed by Rohm and Haas or their equivalents and<br><br>
crosslinked aery late / methacrylate resins (Amberlite XAD - 7, 8) or their equivalents. These are suitable for removal of phenols from aqueous phase.<br>
Though these adsorbents are suitable for removal of phenolic compounds from aqueous phase, they do not have any structural feature that can distinguish between various phenols and hence they are not selective for a particular phenol. These adsorbents are able to remove phenols from aqueous streams as well as non-polar organic streams mainly based on the polarity difference between the solute and the solvent.<br>
In literature there are references for preparation of polymers, which are selective to a particular substrate such as drugs (theophyllin, phenobarbital, creatanine), steroids (cholesterol, corticosteroids), nucleic acid bases, carbohydrates. The technique of preparation of such polymers is known as molecular imprinting ( Wulff, G., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed Eng., 34 (1995), 1812 -1832, Mosbach, K. and Ramstrom, O., Biotechnolog)&gt;, 14 (1996), 163 - 173, Steinke, J., Sherrington, D. C. and Dunkin, I. R., Advances in polymer science Vol. 123 (1995), 81 -125). The polymers prepared by this technique are known as molecularly imprinted polymers or more commonly and herein after referred as MIPs. (MIPs)<br>
The MIPs are prepared by polymerization of monomers around a template molecule in the presence of a large excess of crosslinker. During' synthesis, the template is either covalently or non-covalently linked to the monomers. After polymerization, the template is removed from the polymer leaving behind a cavity on the surface. These cavities have shape and size similar to the template molecule used during polymerization and hence are selective to those particular substrates.<br><br>
There are no reports in the literature for the preparation of polymeric adsorbents selective for phenolic compounds using molecular imprinting technique by precipitation polymerization.<br>
The object of the present invention is therefore to provide a process for the preparation of polymeric adsorbents by precipitation polymerization.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for preparation of polymeric adsorbents by precipitation polymerization which comprises<br>
(a)	mixing requisite amount of a template monomer such as herein described, with<br>
a crosslinker as described herein, along with a porogen selected from cyclo<br>
hexanol or aromatic solvent such as defined herein and a polymerization<br>
initiator, typically a radical initiator as defined herein , degassing the obtained<br>
mixture by evacuator or by passage of inert gas,<br>
(b)	polymerizing the monomer solution obtained in step (a) by    conventional<br>
method as herein described, at a temperature ranging 60° - 90°C, for a period<br>
of 24 h,<br>
(c)	crushing and sieving the polymer formed to get particle having size 250u -<br>
100u and washing it with a solvent as defined herein, to remove the unreacted<br>
monomers as well as the porogen,<br>
(d)	hydrolyzing the polymer by acid or alkali treatment such as herein described,<br>
for a period ranging from 6-10 hours followed by washing with solvent and<br>
drying at a temperature ranging 50° to 60°C, to get the desired polymeric<br>
adsorbent.<br>
In an embodiment the template monomer may be either a carbonate ester or carboxylate ester having one or more vinylic / allylic / styrenic unsaturations as exemplified by phenyl methacrylate, 2 - (methacryloyl), ethyl, phenyl carbonate,<br><br>
phenyl, 4 - vinyl benzoate, phenyl, 4 - vinyl phenyl carbonate, allyl phenyl carbonaze, phenyl acrylate, 2 -(acryloyl), ethyl, phenyl carbonate, 2,4- DHB (2.4- dihydrcxy benzophenone) methacrylate, allyl, 2,4- DHB carbonate, p- nitrophenyl methacrylare, p- nitrophenyl acrylate, allyl, p- nitrophenyl carbonate, allyl bisphenyl carbonare, bisphenyl methacrylate, p- cumyl phenyl methacrylate, 2,4- dinitrophenyl acrylate, 2,4- dinitrophenyl methacrylate, p- methoxy phenyl methacrylate, aJlyl, o- methoxy phenyl carbonate, o- methoxy phenyl methacrylate, allyl, p- methoxy phenyl carbonate, o- methoxy phenyl acrylate, p- methoxy phenyl acrylate.<br>
In another embodiment the crosslinker used for polymerization may be acrylic or methacrylic or styrenic in nature with two or more unsaturations as exemplified by methylene bis acrylamide, trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, divinyl benzene, ethylene glycol diacrylate, trimethylol propane triacrylate.<br>
In another embodiment the porogen used during the polymerization process may be either alcoholic in nature such as cyclohexanol or an aromatic solvent such as benzene, toluene, xylene.<br>
In yet another embodiment the initiator used for the thermal polymerization may be chosen from a class of compounds such as azo, peroxides, hydroperoxices, persulphates, more preferably from azo initiators.<br>
In yet another embodiment the degassing of the monomer solution may be carried out by evacuation of the solution or by passage of an inert gas such as nitrogen, argon, helium.<br><br>
In yet another embodiment the polymerization of the template monomer may be carried out thermally between 60° - 90° C and more preferably between 70° - 80° C.<br>
In yet another embodiment, after polymerization, the imprinted polymer may be crushed to a particle size 
In yet another embodiment the hydrolysis of the template monomer may be carried out using preferably alkali solution viz. NaOH or KOH of a strength between 0.1 to 2.0 N and more preferably between 0.5 to 1.5 N for a period ranging frcm 6 to 10 hours.<br>
In yet another embodiment the solvent used for washing of the polymer may be selected from ethanol, methanol, acetone, chloroform.<br>
In a feature of the present invention is provided a process for preparation of polymeric adsorbents, by the process of precipitation polymerization in presence of a porogen (Wulff, G. and Vesper, W. J. Chromatogr., 167 (1978), 171-186; Selkrgren, B., Ekherg, B. and Mosbach, K., J. Chromatogr., 347 (1985), 1-10; Shea, K. J. and Sasaki, D. Y., J. Am. Chem. Soc., Ill (1989), 3442-3444; Whitcomhe, M., Rodriguez, M. E., Villar, P. andVulfson, £, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 117(1995), 7105-7111; Cheong, S., Mcniven, S., Rachkov, A., Levi, K., Yano, K. and Kanibe, I., Macromolecuks, 30 (1997), 1317-1322). The porogen used in the process is such that it is a good solvent for the monomers but a poor solvent for the polymer. Due to this the polymer phase separates as it is formed entrapping the solvent in it. This leads to a highly porous structure with a large surface area.<br>
These polymers can also be prepared by any other conventional methods of polymerization such as suspension   polymerization (Mayes, A. and Mosbach, K.,<br><br>
Anal.   Chem.   68,   (1996),   3769-3774),   emulsion   polymerization,   bi   continuous emulsion polymerization etc.<br>
Because of their shape and size selectivity, MIPs have found applications in areas such as racemic resolution, as sensor materials or as shape selective catalysts.<br>
