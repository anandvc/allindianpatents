Oporafeing methods for a medical imaging system and for a computing<br>
device, and deviced corresponding thereto<br>
The present invention relates to an operating method for a medical<br>
imaging system, in particular an x-ray system, having at least a<br>
signal source, a detector, and a control device for the signal<br>
source and detector.<br>
The present invention further relates to an operating method for a<br>
computing device not assigned to a medical imaging system, in<br>
particular not to an x-ray system.<br>
The present invention furthermore relates to data media having<br>
computer programs stored thereon for implementing operating methods<br>
of this type.<br>
The present invention also relates to a control device for a medical<br>
imaging system, in particular an x-ray system, and a computing<br>
device for implementing operating methods of this type.<br>
The present invention finally relates to a medical imaging system,<br>
in particular an x-ray system.<br>
Medical imaging systems, in particular x-ray systems, and their<br>
control devices are generally known. The following steps are<br>
performed by the control device in said systems:<br>
-	Said control device drives the signal source and detector so that<br>
the detector registers an object's raw data,<br>
-	it accepts the registered raw data and, by means thereof,<br>
determines an end data record by which at least one end image of<br>
the object is defined, and<br>
-	via a viewing device it feeds out to a user of the medical imaging<br>
system at least one two-dimensional end image defined by the end<br>
data record.<br><br>
Data editing is therefore located close to the system in the prior<br>
art, for which reason the control device must always be able to<br>
realize the full functionality of data editing locally.<br>
Being highly complex, the data-editing software is expensive. It<br>
will consequently not be cost-effective to procure said software<br>
unless a commensurate amount of use is made of the system. If an<br>
incommensurate amount of use is made thereof it will take a long<br>
time to recover the procurement costs, or said costs will not be<br>
recovered at all. A further disadvantage of the prior art is that<br>
the software is also very demanding in terms of computing power.<br>
This means that the control device must also be very efficient. The<br>
procurement of this is therefore likewise very costly.<br>
The above-cited problems become even more apparent when the medical<br>
imaging system can be operated in different modes and separate data-<br>
editing software is required for each mode.<br>
As is generally known, software is subject to being further<br>
developed. Above and beyond the above-cited disadvantages, it is<br>
very cumbersome to distribute a new software version among all the<br>
medical imaging systems affected and to install it there.<br>
An administration method for images produced by means of medical<br>
imaging systems is known from US-A-2002/0019751. With this method,<br>
after being produced the images are conveyed via a computer-to-<br>
computer link to a computing device not assigned to the medical<br>
imaging system and stored there centrally. They are disseminated by<br>
the computing device to other computers with no further image<br>
processing.<br>
The object of the present invention is to avoid these disadvantages<br>
of the prior art cited at the beginning.<br>
Said object is achieved for an operating method for a medical<br>
imaging system, in particular an x-ray system, in that<br><br>
-	the control device drives the signal source and detector so that<br>
the detector registers an object's raw data,<br>
-	the control device accepts the registered raw data and conveys<br>
send data of said object corresponding to said registered raw data<br>
via a computer-to-computer link to a computing device not assigned<br>
to the medical imaging system, and in that<br>
-	via the computer-to-computer link the control device accepts an<br>
end data record from the computing device determined by said<br>
device by means of the send data and feeds out at least one two-<br>
dimensional end image defined by the end data record to a user of<br>
the medical imaging system via a viewing device.<br>
The object for the operating method for a computing device not<br>
assigned to a medical imaging system, in particular not to an x-ray<br>
system, is correspondingly achieved in that<br>
-	the computing device accepts an object's send data from a control<br>
device for the medical imaging system via a computer-to-computer<br>
link,<br>
-	by means of the send data conveyed to it the computing device<br>
determines an end data record by which at least one two-<br>
dimensional end image of the object is defined, and in that<br>
-	the computing device conveys the end data record determined by it<br>
to the control device via the computer-to-computer link.<br>
There is thus a spatial separation of data registration and image<br>
representation on the one hand and data editing on the other. It is<br>
therefore in particular possible for the data-editing software to be<br>
used for evaluating send data originating from different medical<br>
imaging systems. Software sharing is thus possible. The advantage is<br>
that "payment" is only required for the software's actual use.<br>
"Expensive" software can, in particular, consequently also be used<br>
even if seldom required. Moreover, the control device can be<br>
embodied more cost-effectively without the user's having to tolerate<br>
a reduction in performance.<br>
In the case of larger facilities such as hospitals, for instance,<br>
the computing device may be the property of the facility concerned.<br><br>
Said device is, however, frequently made available by a provider<br>
only for use in return for a charge.<br>
The method according to the invention further also allows the data-<br>
editing software to be updated more easily because only the software<br>
located centrally in the computing device has to be updated.<br>
In the simplest case the raw data corresponds only to a single raw<br>
data record. A raw data record can be, for instance, the raw image<br>
of a two-dimensional x-ray detector or several raw images of a one-<br>
dimensional x-ray detector which are assembled into a single two-<br>
dimensional raw image. The term "raw image" is therefore used to<br>
refer to an at least one-dimensional but generally two-dimensional<br>
raw data record.<br>
The raw data generally contains several raw data records, however.<br>
For example it contains raw images taken from different angles.<br>
The method according to the invention will display its advantages<br>
particularly prominently if the end data record has been determined<br>
by means of a 3D reconstruction of the object. This is because<br>
calculating the 3D reconstruction is very demanding in terms of<br>
computing power. A typical total of 40 to 400 raw data records (=<br>
two-dimensional raw images) is required for this.<br>
In a 3D reconstruction the end image is in most cases a section<br>
through the 3D reconstruction or a parallel or perspective<br>
projection of said reconstruction. Defining the end image by means<br>
of the already existing 3D reconstruction is, however, far simpler<br>
than determining the 3D reconstruction. It is hence readily possible<br>
for the end image to be determined by the control device. It is,<br>
however, in principle also conceivable for this to be done by the<br>
computing device.<br>
The end image has imaging parameters. Said imaging parameters are<br>
pre-specified to the control device preferably by the user<br><br>
interactively. This is because evaluating the 3D reconstruction will<br>
then be especially user-friendly.<br>
As an alternative to determining a 3D reconstruction it is also<br>
possible, for example, for the end data record - despite the<br>
registration of several raw data records - to correspond to at least<br>
one end image. Several raw data records can, for example, be<br>
registered successively section-by-section in the case of a larger<br>
object and the images determined by means of the raw data records<br>
can be assembled by the computing device into a common image. In<br>
this case the number of raw images will be relatively small, being<br>
between two and eight, for instance.<br>
It is possible for the send data to be identical to the raw data.<br>
The raw data must, however, be corrected, especially in the case of<br>
x-ray systems, to take account of correction data for the medical<br>
imaging system, said data being dependent on the system and/or<br>
operating status. It will otherwise not be possible to process the<br>
data in a meaningful manner using customary image-processing<br>
software.<br>
There are two possibilities for enabling it to be processed using<br>
customary image-processing software:<br>
-	On the one hand the send data can include the raw data and<br>
correction data. In this case the computing device will be able to<br>
determine intermediate data independent of the system and<br>
operating status by means of the raw data and correction data, and<br>
then determine the end data record by means of said intermediate<br>
data.<br>
-	On the other hand the control device can also determine the<br>
intermediate data and convey said intermediate data to the<br>
computing device as send data. This is possible because the<br>
intermediate data is substantially determined by means of simple<br>
offset subtraction requiring little computing power.<br><br>
The control device preferably archives at least the end data record<br>
and/or send data in a bulk storage facility. This is because this<br>
data will then also be available in the future. It is alternatively<br>
or additionally also possible for the computing device to archive<br>
the end data record and/or send data in a bulk storage facility.<br>
Further advantages and details will emerge from the following<br>
description of an exemplary embodiment in conjunction with the<br>
accompanying drawings shown in schematic form:<br>
FIG 1	a medical imaging system and its control device as<br>
well as a computing device, and<br>
FIG 2 to 10 flowcharts.<br>
A medical imaging system is embodied by way of example in FIG 1 as<br>
an x-ray system. It could, however, also be embodied as another type<br>
of medical imaging system, for example a magnetic resonance imaging<br>
system, an ultrasound tomography system or a conventional ultrasound<br>
imaging system.<br>
The x-ray system shown in FIG 1 has an x-ray source 1 and an x-ray<br>
detector 2. The x-ray source 1 and x-ray detector 2 are located on<br>
what is termed a C arc 3.<br>
The x-ray system further has a control device 4. Said control device<br>
4 controls the operation of the x-ray system, in particular that of<br>
the x-ray source 1 and the x-ray detector 2. For example it swivels<br>
the x-ray source 1 and the x-ray detector 2 by moving the C arc 3<br>
relative to an object being examined 5. This is indicated in FIG 1<br>
by a double arrow A.<br>
The object being examined 5 is generally a human patient 5<br>
positioned on an examination table 6 for the purpose of taking x-ray<br>
images. The examination table 6 can also be capable of being moved<br>
by the control device 4. This is indicated in FIG 1 by a double<br>
arrow B.<br><br>
The control device 4 has a bulk storage facility 7, for example a<br>
hard disk 7. A computer program 8 is stored in the bulk storage<br>
facility 7. The computer program 8 has previously been routed to the<br>
control device 4 via, for example, a data medium 9 (a CD-ROM 9, for<br>
instance) on which the computer program 8 is stored in (exclusively)<br>
machine-readable form. On the basis of being programmed with the<br>
computer program 8, the control device 4 operates the x-ray system<br>
in a manner which will later be explained in more detail in<br>
conjunction with FIG 2 to 10.<br>
The control device 4 is further connected via a computer-to-computer<br>
link 10 to a computing device 11. The computer-to-computer link 10<br>
can be embodied in any way, for example as a local area network<br>
(LAN), an internet connection or a telephone connection. The<br>
computer-to-computer link 10 can also be embodied optionally as a<br>
wired or wireless link.<br>
The computing device 11 is generally highly efficient in terms of<br>
performance. Examples of computing devices 11 of this type are PCs,<br>
workstations, and mainframes. The computing device 11 is not,<br>
however, permanently assigned to the x-ray system. It can in<br>
individual cases even be embodied as the control and evaluation<br>
equipment of a medical imaging system different from that shown in<br>
FIG 1. It is, however, generally embodied as a pure computing device<br>
11.<br>
The computing device 11 likewise has a bulk storage facility 12, for<br>
example also a hard disk 12. Stored on the bulk storage facility 12<br>
is a computer program 13 determining the operation of the computing<br>
device 11. The computer program 13 has likewise been previously<br>
routed to the computing device 11 via a data medium 14 (for example<br>
via a CD-ROM 14 in this case, also) on which the computer program 13<br>
is stored in (exclusively) machine-readable form.<br>
The control device 4 and computing device 11 interoperate as<br>
described below in conjunction with FIGS 2 and 3 owing to<br>
programming by means of the computer programs 8, 13. FIG 2 here<br><br>
relates to the operating method executed by the control device 4,<br>
and FIG 3 relates to the operating method executed by the computing<br>
device 11.<br>
According to a step S1 the control device 4 initially only drives<br>
the x-ray detector 2 so that the latter registers correction data;<br>
it then accepts said correction data. The correction data is here<br>
specific to the detector (hence the system) and/or operating status.<br>
It in particular represents the offset amount by which x-ray images<br>
registered later must be corrected.<br>
In a step S2 the control device 4 then drives the x-ray source 1 and<br>
the x-ray detector 2 so that the x-ray detector 2 records raw data<br>
of the object being examined 5; it then accepts said raw data. The<br>
raw data registered in step S2 here corresponds to one two-<br>
dimensional raw image of the object 5, thus forming one raw data<br>
record.<br>
In a step S3 the control device 4 checks whether a further raw data<br>
record is to be registered. If so, a return is made to step S2<br>
(possibly also to step S1 as indicated in FIG 2 by means of a dashed<br>
line). A step S4 will otherwise be carried out.<br>
In step S4 the control device 4 determines intermediate data by<br>
means of the registered raw data and correction data. The<br>
intermediate data is here independent of the system and operating<br>
status. In a step S5 the control device 4 archives the intermediate<br>
data determined by it in the bulk storage facility 7.<br>
The control device 4 then conveys the intermediate data to the<br>
computing device 11 in a step S6 as send data. This is of course<br>
done using the computer-to-computer link 10.<br>
According to FIG 3, in a step S7 the computing device 11 accepts the<br>
send data of the object 5 conveyed to it and archives said data in a<br>
step S8. In a step S9 said device then determines an end data record<br>
of the object 5 by means of the send data. The end data record can<br><br>
correspond to, for example, a 3D reconstruction of the object 5.<br>
Said device archives the determined end data record in a step S10,<br>
likewise in the bulk storage facility 12. Said device finally<br>
conveys the determined end data record in a step Sll back to the<br>
control device 4. This is, of course, also done using the computer-<br>
to-computer link 10.<br>
According to FIG 2, in a step S12 the control device 4 accepts the<br>
end data record conveyed to it and archives it in the bulk storage<br>
facility 7 in a step S13.<br>
In a step S14 the control device 4 requests a user 15 to indicate<br>
whether a section, a perspective projection or a parallel projection<br>
of the end data record is to be shown via a viewing device 16. The<br>
viewing device 16 can be, for instance, a standard monitor or a flat<br>
display, for example what is termed a TFT display.<br>
In a step S15 said device then requests imaging parameters of the<br>
end image from the user 15 such as, for example, a line of sight or<br>
a launch angle in the case of a perspective projection. The<br>
requested entries are fed in by the user 15 by means of a standard<br>
input device 17, for example a keyboard and/or mouse.<br>
In accordance with the user specifications supplied in steps S14 and<br>
S15, in a step S16 the control device 4 then uses the end data<br>
record to determine the required end image. In a step S17 the end<br>
image is fed out by the control device 4 to the user 15 via the<br>
viewing device 16.<br>
The control device 4 checks in a step S18 whether a further end<br>
image is to be fed out. If so, a return is made to step S14. The<br>
user 15 is thus able to specify the imaging parameters<br>
interactively. The method will otherwise have been concluded.<br>
The above-described correction taking account of correction data<br>
dependent on the system and/or operating status is necessary in<br>
particular in the case of x-ray detectors 2. It is, however, also<br><br>
conceivable, as shown in FIG 4, for registering of correction data<br>
not to take place. In this case the raw data will be conveyed to the<br>
computing device 11 in a step S19 (which will take the place of step<br>
S6 in FIG 2) instead of the intermediate data. In this case the send<br>
data will therefore be identical to the raw data. However, as the<br>
computing device 11 cannot know whether the raw data or intermediate<br>
data has been conveyed to it as send data during implementation of<br>
the method described in conjunction with FIG 3, evaluation on the<br>
part of the computing device 11 will remain unchanged. It should<br>
additionally be mentioned here that the raw data will in this case<br>
of course be archived.<br>
An alternative possibility is, as described below in conjunction<br>
with FIG 5, for the control device 4 to convey the correction data<br>
to the computing device 11 in a step S20 in addition to the raw<br>
data. In this case the send data will therefore comprise both the<br>
raw data and the correction data. This will enable the computing<br>
device 11 according to FIG 6 to, in a step S21, determine the<br>
intermediate data which is independent of the system and operating<br>
status by means of the raw data and the correction data. The end<br>
data record will then of course be determined by means of the<br>
intermediate data. Step S9 in FIG 3 can therefore be retained in<br>
unaltered form.<br>
The end data record corresponds to the 3D reconstruction itself<br>
according to the above-described method. The end images to be shown<br>
are determined by the control device 4. It is, however, also<br>
possible for the control device 4 to request the user 15 in advance<br>
to specify the imaging parameters for one or more end<br>
representations and to convey said parameters to the computing<br>
device 11. In this case, although the computing device 11 will<br>
likewise determine the 3D reconstruction of the object 5, said 3D<br>
reconstruction of the object 5 will not yet correspond to the end<br>
data record. Rather it will be the case that the computing device 11<br>
in this case determines a single end image or a sequence of end<br>
images by means of the 3D reconstruction of the object 5 and conveys<br>
said end image or sequence to the control device 4. In this case the<br><br>
control device 4 will serve solely to archive the end data record<br>
and to present it. Projection parameters cannot, however, in this<br>
case be interactively changed.<br>
The procedure described above in conjunction with a volume<br>
reconstruction can in principle also be applied in cases where only<br>
one end image can be produced, when the end data record is hence for<br>
method-related reasons identical to the end image. For this it is<br>
possible for example according to FIG 7 for the control device 4 to<br>
register raw data for a single image, for instance a single raw<br>
image, in a step S22. Said device will then convey corresponding<br>
send data to the computing device 11 in a step S23. Said send data<br>
can alternatively be the raw data, the raw data augmented by<br>
correction data, or intermediate data determined by means of the raw<br>
data and correction data.<br>
The control device 4 will in this case accept the end image in a<br>
step S24 and feed it out to the user 15 in a step S25.<br>
The computing device 11 will correspondingly accept the send data in<br>
a step S26. Said device will, where applicable, determine the<br>
intermediate data in a step S27. Said device will determine the end<br>
image in a step S28 by means of the send or intermediate data and<br>
convey said image in a step S29 back to the control device 4.<br>
It is also possible to determine only a single end image in cases<br>
where several raw data records are required for determining the end<br>
image. This will be explained in more detail below in conjunction<br>
with FIGS 9 and 10.<br>
According to FIG 9 the control device 4 drives the signal source 1<br>
and the detector 2, for example in a step S30, so that the detector<br>
2 registers a raw image of the object 5.<br>
The control device 4 accepts the registered raw data likewise in<br>
step S30.<br><br>
In step S31 the control device 4 drives the examination table 6 so<br>
that the object being examined 5 is moved slightly. In a step S32<br>
the control device 4 then checks whether an image sequence has now<br>
been completed or whether further images need to be taken. If<br>
further images need to be taken the control device 4 will return to<br>
step S30. It will otherwise proceed to a step S33 in which it<br>
conveys the corresponding send data of all registered raw data<br>
records to the computing device 11.<br>
According to FIG 10, the computing device 11 accepts the conveyed<br>
send data records in a step S34. In a step S35, said device<br>
determines an end image consisting of, for example, an assemblage of<br>
