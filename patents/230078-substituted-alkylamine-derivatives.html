SUBSTITUTED ALKYLAMINE DERIVATIVES AND METHODS OF USE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is in the field of pharmaceutical agents and specifically relates to,, compounds, compositions, uses and methods for treating cancer and angiogenesis-related disorders.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Protein kinases represent a large family of proteins which play a central role in the regulation of a wide variety of cellular processes, maintaining control over cellular function. A partial list of such kinases includes abl, Atk, bcr-abl, Elk, Brk, Btk, c-kit, c-met, c-src, CDKl, CDK2, CDK3, CDK4, CDK5, CDK6, CDK7, CDK8, CDK9, CDKIO, cRafl, CSFIR, CSK,   EG?R, ErbB2, ErbB3, Erb34, Erk, Fak, fes, FGFRl, FGFR2, FGFR3, FGFR4, FGFR5, Fgr, flt-1, Fps, Frk, Fyn, Hck, IGF-IR, INS-R, Jak, KDR, Lck, Lyn, MEK, p38, PDGFR, PIK, PKC, PYK2, ros, tie, tie2, TRK, Yes, and Zap70.  Inhibition of such kinases has become an important therapeutic target.<br>
Certain diseases are known to be associated with deregulated angiogenesis, for excimple ocular neovascularization, such as retinopathies (including diabetic retinopathy), age-related macular degeneration, psoriasis, hemangioblastoma, hemangioma, arteriosclerosis, inflammatory disease, such as a rheumatoid or rheumatic inflammatory disease, especially arthritis (including rheumatoid arthritis), or other chronic inflammatory disorders, such as chronic asthma, arterial or post-transplantational atherosclerosis, endometriosis, and neoplastic diseases, for example so-called solid tumors and liquid tumors (such as leukemias).<br><br>
At the center of the network regulating the growth and differentiation of the vascular system and its components, both during embryonic development and normal growth, and in a wide number of pathological anomalies and diseases, lies the angiogenic factor known as Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-(VEGF; originally termed 'Vascular Permeability Factor-, VPF), along with its cellular receptors (see G. Breier et al.. Trends in Cell Biology, 6, 454-6 (1996)).<br>
VEGF is a dimeric, disulfide-linked 46-kDa glycoprotein related to -Platelet-Derived Growth Faccor-(PDGF); it is produced by normal cell lines and tumor cell lines; is an endothelial cell-specific mitogen; shows angiogenic activity in in vivo  test systems (e.g. rabbit cornea); is chemotactic for endothelial cells and monocytes; and induces plasminogen activators in endothelial cells, which are involved in the proteolytic degradation of extracellular matrix during the formation of capillaries. A number of isoforms of VEGF are known, which show comparable biological activity, but differ in the type of cells that secrete them and in their heparin-binding capacity. In addition, there are other members of the VEGF family, such as -Placenta Growth Factor-(PlGF) and VEGF-C.<br>
VEGF receptors (VEGFR) are transmembranous receptor tyrosine kinases. They are characterized by an extracellular domain with seven immunoglobulin-like domains and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. Various types of VEGF receptor are known, e.g. VEGFR-1 (also known as flt-1), VEGFR-2 (also known as KDR), and VEGFR-3.<br>
A large number of human tumors, especially gliomas and carcinomas, express high levels of VEGF and its receptors. This has led to the hypothesis that the VEGF released by tumor cells stimulates the growth of blood capillaries and the proliferation of tumor endothelium in a paracrine manner and through the improved blood supply, accelerate tumor<br><br>
growth. Increased VEGF expression could explain the occurrence of cerebral edema in patients with glioma. Direct evidence of the role of VEGF as a tumor angiogenesis factor in vivo  is shown in studies in which VEGF expression or VEGF activity was inhibited. This was achieved with anti-VEGF antibodies, with dominant-negative VEGFR-2 mutants which inhibited signal transduction, and with antisense-VEGF RNA techniques. All approaches led to a reduction in the growth of glioma cell lines or other tumor cell lines in  vivo  as a result of inhibited tumor angiogenesis.<br>
Angiogenesis is regarded as an absolute prerequisite for tumors which grow beyond a diameter of about 1-2 mm; up to this limit, oxygen and nutrients may be supplied to the tumor cells by diffusion. Every tumor, regardless of its origin and its cause, is thus dependent on angiogenesis for its growth after it has reached a certain size-Three principal mechanisms play an important part in the activity of angiogenesis inhibitors against tumors: 1) Inhibition of the growth of vessels, especially capillaries, into avascular resting tumors, with the result that there is no net tumor growth owing to the balance that is achieved between cell death and proliferation; 2) Prevention of the migration of tumor cells owing to the absence of blood flow to and from tumors; and 3) Inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation, thus avoiding the paracrine growth-stimulating effect exerted on the surrounding tissue by the endothelial cells which normally line the vessels. See R. Connell and J. Beebe, Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents, 11, 77-114 (2001).<br>
VEGF's are unique in that they are the only angiogenic growth factors known to contribute to vascular hyperpermeability and the formation of edema. Indeed, vascular hyperpermeability and edema that is associated with<br><br>
the expression or administration of many other growth factors appears to be mediated via VEGF production.<br>
Inflammatory cytokines stimulate VEGF production. Hypoxia results in a marked upregulation of VEGF in numerous tissues, hence situations involving infarct, occlusion, ischemia, anemia, or circulatory impairment typically invoke VEGF/VPF-mediated responses. Vascular hyperpermeability, associated edema, altered transendothelial exchange and macromolecular extravasation, which is often accompanied by diapedesis, can result in excessive matrix deposition, aberrant stromal proliferation, fibrosis, etc. Hence, VEGF-mediated hyperpermeability can significantly contribute to disorders with these etiologic features. As such, regulators of angiogenesis have become an important therapeutic target.<br>

GENERAL SYNTHETIC PROCEDURES<br>
The compounds of the invention can be synthesized according to the following procedures of Schemes 1-48, wherein the substituents are as defined for Formulas I-XII, above, except where further noted.<br><br><br>
Cyclic amides can be prepared according to the method set out in Scheme 1.  The amino group of compound 1 (where R° is alkyl, aryl, and the like) is protected, such as with Boc anhydride, followed by treatment, to remove the ester, such as with base, forming the protected amine/free acid 2. Alternatively, other amino protecting groups known in the art can be used.  Substituted amines are coupled with the free acid, such as with EDC, to form the protected amine/amide 3.  The protected amine moiety is deprotected, such as with acid, and reacted via one step reductive alkylation with carbonyl-containing compounds (where R' is H, halo, cyano, -NHR6 and C1+6 alkyl) to form the'l-amido-2-substituted amino-compounds 4. Preferably the aminationis in an alcohol, such as MeOH, EtOH or propanol, and at a temperature between about 0-50°C, such as RT. Aldehydes or<br><br>
ketones are preferred carbonyl-containing compounds. Alternative carbonyl-containing compounds are, for example; bisulfite adducts or hemiacetals, acetals, hemiketals or ketals of compounds with alcohols, for example lower hydroxyalkyl compounds; or thioacetals or thioketals of compounds with mercaptans, for example lower alkylthio compounds. The reductive alkylation is preferably carried out with hydrogenation in the presence of a catalyst, such as platinum or especially palladium, which is preferably bonded to a carrier material, such as carbon, or a heavy metal catalyst, such as Raney nickel, at normal pressure or at pressures of from 0.1 to 10 MegaPascal (MPa), or with reduction by means of complex hydrides, such as borohydrides, especially alkali metal cyanoborohydrides, for example sodium cyanoborohydride, in the presence of a suitable acid, preferably relatively weak acids, such as lower alkylcarboxylic acids, especially acetic acid, or a sulfonic acid, such as p-toluenesulfonic acid; in customary solvents, for example alcohols, such as MeOH or EtOH, or ethers, for example cyclic ethers, such as THF, in the presence or absence of water.<br><br><br>
Alternatively, compounds 4 can be prepared  from mixed acid/amines 5 as shown in Scheme 2. Substituted amines are coupled with the mixed acid/cunines 5 such as with a coupling reagent, for example EDC, to form the mixed amine/amide 6, Substituted carbonyl compounds, such as acid halides, anhydrides, carboxylic acids, esters, ketones, aldehydes and the like, are added to the mixed amine/amide 6 followed with reduction to give the substituted amide/substituted amine compounds 4,<br><br><br>
Substituted cyclic carboxamides can be prepared from the corresponding imino analogs by the process outlined in Scheme 4. Treatment of the imino compound 7 with a reducing agent yields compound 4. Reagents which can be used to add hydrogen to an imine double bond include borane in THF, LiAlH;, NaBH4, sodium in EtOH and hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst, and others.<br><br><br>
Substituted carboxamides 4 can be prepared from the corresponding halo analogs 8 by the process outlined in Scheme 5. Substituted amino acids 9 are prepared from the corresponding chloro compounds 8 such as by reacting with an<br>
amine at a suitable temperature, such as about 80°C.  The acid 9 is coupled with an amine, preferably in the presence of a coupling agent such as EDC, to form the corresponding amide 4.<br>
The amination process can be carried out as an Ullmann type reaction using a copper catalyst, such as copperfO] or a copper[I] compound such as copper[I]oxide, copper[I]bromide or copper[I]iodide in the presence of a suitable base (such as a metal carbonate, for example K2CO3) to neutralize the acid generated in the reaction.  This reaction is reviewed in Houben-Weyl -Methoden der Organischen Chemie-, Band 11/1, page 32 -33, 1958, in Organic Reactions, 14, page 19-24, 1965 and by J. Lindley<br><br>
(1984) in Tetrahedron, 40, page 1433-1456. The amount cf catalyst is typically in the range of 1 to 20 mole percent. The reaction is carried out in an inert, aprotic solvent such as an ether (for example dimethoxyethane or dioxane) or an amide (for example dimethylformamide or N-methylpyrrolidone) , under an inert atmosphere in the temperature range of 60-180°C.<br>
An alternative amination process involves using a Group VIII element, where the metal core of the catalyst should be a zero-valent transition metal, such as palladium or nickel, which has the ability to undergo oxidative addition to the aryl-halogen bond. The zero valent state of the metal may be generated in situ from the M[II] state. The catalyst complexes may include chelating ligands, such as alkyl, aryl or heteroaryl derivatives of phosphines or biphosphines, imines or arsines. Preferred catalysts contain palladium or nickel. Examples of such catalysts include palladium[II]chloride, palladium[II]acetate, tetrakis (triphenyl-phosphine)palladium[0] and nickel[II]acetylacetonate, The metal catalyst is typically in the range of 0.1 to 10 mole percent. The chelating ligands may be either monodentate, as in the case for example of trialkyphosphines, such as tributylphosphine, triarylphosphines, such as tri-(ortho-tolyl)phosphine, and triheteroaryl phosphines, such as tri-2-furylphosphine; or they may be bidentate such as in the case of 2,2-bis (diphenylphosphino) - 1,1'binaphthyl, 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane, 1,1'-<br>
bis (diphenylphosphino) ferrocene and 1-(N,N-dimethyl-amino)-1' - (dicyclohexylphosphino)biphenyl. The supporting ligand may be complexed to the metal center in the form of a metal complex prior to being added to the reaction mixture or may be added to the reaction mixture as a separate compound. The supporting ligand is typically present in the range 0.01 to<br><br>
20 mole percent. It is often necessary to add a suitable base to the reaction mixture, such as a trialkylamine (for example DIEA or 1,5-diazabicyclo[5,4,0]undec-5-ene), a Group I alkali metal alkoxide (for example potassium tert-butoxide) or carbonate (for example cesium carbonate) or potassium phosphate. The reaction is typically carried out in an inert aprotic solvent such as an ether (for example dimethoxyethane or dioxane) or an amide (for example, DMF or N-methylpyrrolidone) , under an inert atmosphere in the temperature range of 60-180°C.<br>
The amination is preferably carried out in an inert, aprotic, preferably anhydrous, solvent or solvent mixture, for example in a carboxylic acid amide, for example DM? or dimethylacetamide, a cyclic ether, for exam.ple THF or dioxane, or a nitrile, for example CH3CN, or in a mixture thereof, at an appropriate tem.perature, for example in a temperature range of from about 40°C to about 180°C, and if necessary under an inert gas atmosphere, for example a nitrogen or argon atmosphere.<br><br><br>

Coupling of the amine 131, such as with 2-chloronicotinic acid and DIEA, HOBt andEDC, in a solvent such as CH2CI2 at a temperature of about RT provides the protected carboxamide 132, which upon deprotection and alkylation yields other compounds of the invention, 133 and 134, respectively.  Alternatively, amine 131 is reacted with 2-fluoronicotinoyl chloride to form a 2-fluoronicotinainide, which can be alkylated, such as in Scheme 10.<br><br><br>
to a solution of strong base such as LiHMDS, in a solvent such as THE, at a temperature below RT, preferably lower than about -50°C, more preferably at about -78°C.  TfsNPh is reacted with the enolate at a temperature of about RT, to give l-methyl-4-(1,2,5,6-tetrahydro)pyridyl-(trifluoromethyl)sulfonate.  A mixture of the triflate intermediate, bis(pinacolato)diboron, potassium acetate, PdCladppf, and dppf in a solvent such as dioxane is heated at a temperature above RT, preferably at a temperature above about 50°C, and more preferably at a temperature at about 80°C to give 4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-2-(l-methyl(4-1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridyl))-1,3,2-dioxaborolane 136.  The substituted aniline 137 is formed from the 1,3,2-dioxaborolane 136 such as with treatment with an amine in the presence of 1,1 '-bis(diphenyphosphino)ferrocene-palladium dichloride and base, such as K2C03, in a solvent such as DMF at a temperature above RT, preferably at a temperature above about 50°C, and more preferably at a temperature at about 80°C.<br><br><br>
Substituted anilines can be prepared by the process outlined in Scheme 42.  4-Cyano-4-phenylpiperidine hydrochloride 138 is treated with base, such as KOH, at a temperature above RT, preferably at a temperature above about 100°C, and more preferably at a temperature at about 160°C, to provide the phenyl piperidine 139.  Alkylation of the phenyl piperidine 139, such as with formaldehyde and NaCNBH3 in a solvent such as CHCN, with sufficient acid to maintain the reaction pH near 7, to provide the alkylated piperidine 140.  Nitration of the phenylpiperidine 140, such as with H2SO4 and fuming HNO3 at a temperature below RT, and preferably at about O°C, gives the nitro intermediate 141. Hydrogenation of the nitro intermediate 141, such as with an H2 atmosphere in the presence of a catalyst, such as Pd/C, in the presence of a solvent, such as an alcohol, preferably MeOH, to give the amino intermediate 142.<br><br><br><br>
Substituted benzylamines can be prepared by the process outlined in Scheme 44.  A substituted brcmobenzylamine 145 where R1a is a substituent described for R1 is protected such as with B0C2O in the presence of base, such as TEA in an appropriate solvent such as CH2CI2. The protected bromobenzylamine 146 is alkylated, such as with l-dimethylamino-2-propyne in the presence of catalyst, such as PdCl2{PPh3)2, and Cul, in the presence of base, such as TEA, at a temperature above RT, preferably at a temperature above about 50°C, and more preferably at a temperature at about 100°C, such as in a sealed tube, to form the propynylbenzylamine 147.  The propynylbenzylamine is hydrogenated such as with H2 in the presence of Pd(0H)2 and MeOH to provide the propylbenzylamine 148. Deprotection, such as with strong acid, such as TFA, for removal of a Boc protecting group, yields the propylbenzylamine 149.<br><br><br>
Substituted benzylamines can he prepared by the process outlined in Scheme 45.  The protected bromobenzylcunine 146 is alkylated, such as with propargyl alcohol in the presence of catalyst, such as PdCl2(pPh3), and Cul, in the presence of base, such as TEA, at a temperature above RT, preferably at a temperature above about 50°C, and more preferably at a temperature at about 100°C, such as in a sealed tube, to form the protected hydroxypropynylbenzylamine 150.  The protected hydroxypropynylbenzylamine is treated with N-methylmorpholine oxide in the presence of a catalyst, such as tetrapropylammonium perruthenate, to form the aldehyde intermediate.  Reductive amination, such as with the addition of morpholine and NaBH{0Ac)3 provides the morpholinyl derivative. Deprotection, such as with strong acid, such as TFA, for removal of a Boc protecting group, yields the propylbenzylamine 151.<br><br><br>
Substituted aminomethyl compounds are prepared such as by the procedure described in Scheme 46.  A halo compound 152, is reacted with an alkyne in the presence of PdCl2(PPh3)2 and Cul, with base is heated at a temperature above about 50°C,   and preferably at about 100°C, such as in a sealed container, to provide the substituted alkyne 153,<br><br><br>
IS IpOH or CH2CI2, to form the amide 158, then coupled with in amine 155 to yield the 2-substituted amino-nicotinamide 157.  V/here A is a pi-electron rich heterocycle, the addition of KF, such as 40% KF on alumina in IpOH, at a teinperature over about 100°C, preferably about 160°C, can be ised in the formation of 157 from 158.<br><br>

pyridinium compounds 161 which are reduced such as with NaBH4 to form the tetrahydro-pyridines 162. Palladium catalyzed intramolecular Heck coupling followed by hydrogenation forms the hexahydro-fluorenes 164.<br>
The starting compounds defined in Schemes 1-48 may also be present with functional groups in protected form if necessary and/or in the form of salts, provided a salt-forming group is present and the reaction in salt form is possible-  If so desired, one compound of formulas I-XII can be converted into another compound of formulas I-XII or a N-oxide thereof; a compound of formulas I-XII can be converted into a salt; a salt of a compound of formulas I-XII can be converted into the free compound or another salt; and/or a mixture of isomeric compounds of formulas I-XII can be separated into the individual isomers.<br>
N-Oxides can be obtained in a known matter by reacting a compound of formulas I-XII with hydrogen peroxide or a peracid, e.g. 3-chloroperoxy-benzoic acid, in an inert solvent, e.g. dichloromethane, at a temperature between about -10-35°C, such as about O°C - RT.<br>
If one or more other functional groups, for example carboxy, hydroxy, amino, or mercapto, are or need to be protected in a compound of formulas I-XII or in the synthesis of a compound of formulas I-XII, because they should not take part in the reaction, these are such groups as are usually used in the synthesis of peptide compounds, and also of cephalosporins and penicillins, as well as nucleic acid derivatives and sugars.<br>
The protecting groups may already be present in precursors and should protect the functional groups concerned against unwanted secondary reactions, such as acylations, etherifications, esterifications, oxidations, solvolysis, and similar reactions. It is a characteristic of<br><br>
protecting groups that they lend themselves readily, i.e. without undesired secondary reactions, to removal, typically by solvolysis, reduction, photolysis or also by enzyme activity, for example under conditions analogous to physiological conditions, and that they are not present in the end-products. The specialist knows, or can easily establish, which protecting groups are suitable with the reactions mentioned above and hereinafter.<br>
The protection of such functional groups by such protecting groups, the protecting groups themselves, and their removal reactions are described for example in standard reference works, such as J. F. W. McOmie, -Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry-, Plenum Press, London and New York 1973, in T. W. Greene, -Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis-, Wiley, New York 1981, in -The Peptides-; Volume 3 (editors: E. Gross and J. Meienhofer), Academic Press, London cind New York 1981, in -Methoden der organischen Chemie- {Methods of organic chemistry), Houben Weyl, 4th edition. Volume 15/1, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart 1974, in H.-D. Jakubke and H. Jescheit, -Aminosauren, Peptide, Proteine- {Amino acids, peptides, proteins), Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Deerfield Beach, and Basel 1982, and in Jochen Lehmann, -Chemie der Kohlenhydrate: Monosaccharide und Derivate- (Chemistry of carbohydrates: monosaccharides and derivatives), Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart 1974.<br>
In the additional process steps, carried out as desired, functional groups of the starting compounds which should not take part in the reaction may be present in unprotected form or may be protected for excimple by one or more of the protecting groups mentioned above under -protecting groups-. The protecting groups are then wholly or partly removed according to one of the methods described there.<br><br>
Salts of a compound of formulas I-XII with a salt-forming group may be prepared in a manner known per se.   Acid addition salts of compounds of formulas I-XII may thus be obtained by treatment with an  acid or with a suitable anion exchange reagent. A salt with two acid molecules (for example a dihalogenide of a compound of formulas I-XII) may also be converted into a salt with one acid molecule per compound (for example a monohalogenide); this may be done by heating to a melt, or for example by heating as a solid under a high vacuum at elevated temperature, for example from about 130°C to about 170°C, one molecule of the acid being expelled per molecule of a compound of formulas I-XII.<br>
Salts can usually be converted to free compounds, e.g. by treating with suitable basic agents, for example with alkali metal carbonates, alkali metal hydrogen carbonates, or alkali metal hydroxides, typically potassium carbonate or sodium hydroxide.<br>
A compound of formulas I-XII, wherein Z  is oxygen, can be converted into the respective compound wherein Z is sulfur, for exam.ple, by using an appropriate sulfur compound, e, g. using reaction with Lawesson's reagent (2,4-bis-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,3-dithia-2,4-diphosphetane-2,4-disulfide) in a halogenated hydrocarbon, such as CH2CI2. or an aprotic solvent, such as toluene or xylene, at temperatures from about 3 0°C to reflux.<br>
A.11 process steps described here can be carried out under known reaction conditions, preferably under those specifically mentioned, in the absence of or usually in the presence of solvents or diluents, preferably such as are inert to the reagents used and able to dissolve these, in the absence or presence of catalysts, condensing agents or neutralizing agents, for example ion exchangers, typically cation exchangers, for example in the H+ form, depending on the type of reaction and/or reactants at reduced, normal, or<br><br>
elevated temperature, for example in the range from about -100°C to about 190°C, preferably from about -80°C to about 150°C, for example at about -80 to about 60°C, at RT, at about -20 to about 40°C or at the boiling point of the solvent used, under atmospheric pressure or in a closed vessel, where appropriate under pressure, and/or in an inert atmosphere, for example under argon or nitrogen.<br>
Salts may be present in all starting compounds and transients, if these contain salt-forming groups. Salts may also be present during the reaction of such compounds, provided the reaction is not thereby disturbed.<br>
In certain cases, typically in hydrogenation processes, it is possible to achieve stereoselective reactions, allowing for example easier recovery of individual isomers,<br>
The solvents from which those can be selected which are suitable for the reaction in question include for example water, esters, typically lower alkyl-lower alkanoates. e.g., ethyl acetate, ethers, typically aliphatic ethers, e.g., diethylether, or cyclic ethers, e.g., TKF, liquid aromatic hydrocarbons, typically benzene or toluene, alcohols, typically MeOH, EtOH or 1-propanol, IPOH, nitriles, typically CH3CN, halogenated hydrocarbons, typically CH2CI2, acid amides, typically DMF, bases, typically heterocyclic nitrogen bases, e.g. pyridine, carboxylic acids, typically lower alkanecarboxylic acids, e.g., AcOH, carboxylic acid anhydrides, typically lower alkane acid anhydrides, e.g., acetic anhydride, cyclic, linear, or branched hydrocarbons, typically cyclohexane, hexane, or isopentane, or mixtures of these solvents, e.g., aqueous solutions, unless otherwise stated in the description of the process. Such solvent mixtures may also be used in processing, for example in chromatography.<br><br>
The invention relates also to those forms of the process in which one starts from a compound obtainable at any stage as a transient and carries out the missing steps, or breaks off the process at any stage, or forms a starting material under the reaction conditions, or uses said starting material in the form of a reactive derivative or salt, or produces a compound obtainable by means of the process according to the invention and processes the said compound in situ.   In the preferred embodiment, one starts from those starting materials which lead to the compounds described above as preferred.<br>
The compounds of formulas I-XII, including their salts, are also obtainable in the form of hydrates, or their crystals can include for example the solvent used for crystallization {present as solvates).<br>
New starting materials and/or intermediates, as v;ell as processes for the preparation thereof, are likewise the subject of this invention. In the preferred embodiment, such starting materials are used and reaction conditior,s so selected as to enable the preferred compounds to be obtained.<br>
Starting materials of the invention, are known, are comnercially available, or can be synthesized in analogy to or according to methods that are known in the art.<br>
For example, amine 1 can be prepared by reduction of the corresponding nitro. The reduction preferably takes place in the presence of a suitable reducing agent, such as tin{ID chloride or hydrogen in the presence of an appropriate catalyst, such as Raney nickel (then preferably the hydrogen is used under pressure, e.g. between 2 and 20 bar) or PtO2, in an appropriate solvent, e.g. an alcohol, such as MeOH. The reaction temperature is preferably between about 0°C and about 80°C, especially about 15°C to about 30°C.<br><br>
It would also be possible to reduce the nitro compound after forming the amide compound under reaction conditions analogous to those for the reduction of nitro compounds described above. This would eliminate the need to protect the free amino group as described in Scheme 1.<br>
In the preparation of starting materials, existing functional groups which do not participate in the reaction should, if necessary, be protected.  Preferred protecting groups, their introduction and their removal are described above or in the examples.<br>
All remaining starting materials are known, capable of being prepared according to known processes, or commercially obtainable; in particular, they can be prepared using processes as described in the examples.<br>
Compounds of the present invention can possess, in general, one or more asymmetric carbon atoms and are thus capable of existing in the form of optical isomers as well as in the form of racemic or non-racemic mixtures thereof. The optical isomers can be obtained by resolution of the racemic mixtures according to conventional processes, e.g., by formation of diastereoisomeric salts, by treatment with an optically active acid or base.  Examples of appropriate acids are tartaric, diacetyltartaric, dibenzoyltartaric, ditoluoyltartaric, and camphorsulfonic acid and then separation of the mixture of diastereoisomers by crystallization followed by liberation of the optically active bases from these salts.  A different process for separation of optical isomers involves the use of a chiral chromatography column optimally chosen to maximize the separation of the enantiomers.  Still another available method involves synthesis of covalent diastereoisomeric molecules by reacting compounds of the invention with an optically pure acid in an activated form or an optically pure isocyanate.  The synthesized diastereoisomers can be<br><br>
separated by conventional means such as chromatography, distillation, crystallization or sublimation, and then hydrolyzed to deliver the enantiomerically pure compound. The optically active compounds of the invention can likewise be obtained by using optically active starting materials.  These isomers may be in the form of a free acid, a free base, an ester or a salt.<br>
The compounds of this invention may contain one or more asymmetric centers and thus occur as racemates and racemic mixtures, scalemic mixtures, single enantiomers, individual diastereomers and diastereomeric mixtures.  All such isomeric forms of these compounds are expressly included in the present invention.<br>
The compounds of this invention may also be represented in multiple tautomeric forms, for example, as illustrated below:<br><br><br>
be attached at any available atom that is not already substituted by an atom other than H (hydrogen).<br>
The compounds of this invention may contain heterocyclic ring systems attached to another ring system. Such heterocyclic ring systems may be attached through a carbon atom or a heteroatom in the ring system.<br>
Alternatively, a compound of any of the formulas delineated herein may be synthesized according to any of the processes delineated herein. In the processes delineated herein, the steps may be performed in an alternate order and may be preceded, or followed, by additional protection/deprotection steps as necesssary.  The processes may further comprise use of appropriate reaction conditions, including inert solvents, additional reagents, such as bases (e.g., LDA, DIEA, pyridine, K2CO3, and the like), catalysts, and salt forms of the above.  The interm.ediates may be isolated or carried on in  situ, with or without purification.  Purification methods are known in the art and include, for example, crystallization, chromatography (liquid and gas phase, simulated moving bed (-SMB-)), extraction, distillation, trituration, reverse phase HPLC and the like. Reactions conditions such as temperature, duration, pressure, and atmosphere (inert gas, ambient) are known in the art and may be adjusted as appropriate for the reaction.<br>
As can be appreciated by the skilled artisan, the above synthetic schemes are not intended to comprise a comprehensive list of all means by which the compounds described and claimed in this application may be synthesized. Further methods will be evident to those of ordinary skill in the art. Additionally, the various synthetic steps described above may be performed in an alternate sequence or order to give the desired compounds. Synthetic chemistry transformations and protecting group<br><br>
methodologies (protection and deprotection) useful in synthesizing the inhibitor compounds described herein are known in the art and include, for example, those such as described in R.

The compounds of this invention may be modified by appending appropriate functionalities to enhance selective biological properties. Such modifications are known in the art and include those which increase biological penetration into a given biological compartment (e.g., blood, lymphatic system, central nervous system), increase oral availability, increase solubility to allow administration by injection, alter metabolism and alter rate of excretion.<br>

These detailed descriptions are presented for illustrative purposes only and are not intended as a restriction on the scope of the invention.<br>

l-Boc-4-(3-nitro-5-trifluoromethyl-phenoxy)-piperidine (470 mg) was dissolved in MeOH (12 ml) and Pd/C (10 mg) was added.  After sparging briefly with H2, the mixture was stirred under H2 for 6 H.

BIOLOGICAL EVALUATION EUVEC Proliferation Assay<br>
Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial cells are purchased from Clonetics. Inc., as cryopreserved cells harvested from a pool of donors.  These cells, at passage 1, are thawed and expanded in EBM-2 complete medium, until passage 2 or 3. The cells are trypsinized, washed in DMEM  + 10% FBS + antibiotics, and spun at 1000 rpm for 10 min.  Prior to centrifugation of the cells, a small amount is collected for a cell count.  After centrifugation, the medium is discarded, and the cells are resuspended in the appropriate volume of DMEM + 10% FBS + antibiotics to achieve a concentration of 3x105 cells/mL.  Another cell count is performed to confirm the cell concentration.  The cells are diluted to 3x104 cells/mL in DMEM + 10% FBS + antibiotics, and 100 µL of cells are added to a 96-well plate.  The cells are incubated at 37°C for 22 h.<br><br>
Prior to the completion of the incubation period, compound dilutions are prepared.  Five-point, five-fold serial dilutions are prepared in DMSO, at concentrations 400-fold greater than the final concentrations desired.  2.5 µL  of each compound dilution are diluted further in a total of 1 mL DMEM + 10% FBS + antibiotics {400x dilution), Medium containing 0.25% DMSO is also prepared for the 0 µM compound sample.  At the 22-hour timepoint, the medium is removed from the cells, and 100 µL  of each compound dilution is added.  The cells are incubated at 37°C for 2-3 h.<br>
During the compound pre-incubation period, the growth factors are diluted to the appropriate concentrations. Solutions of DMEM + 10% FBS + antibiotics, containing either VEGF or bFGF at the following concentrations: 50, 10, 2, 0.4, 0.08, and 0 ng/mL are prepared.  For the compound-treated cells, solutions of VEGF at 550 ng/mL or bFGF at 220 ng/mL for 50 ng/mL or 20 ng/mL final concentrations, respectively, are prepared since 10 µL of each will be added to the cells (110 µL final volume) .  At the appropriate time after adding the compounds, the growth factors are added, VEGF is added to one set of plates, while bFGF is added to another set of plates.  For the growth factor control curves, the media on wells B4-G6 of plates 1 and 2 are replaced with media containing VEGF or bFGF at the varying concentrations (50 - 0 ng/mL).  The cells are incubated at 37°C for an additional 72 h.<br>
At the completion of the 72 h incubation period, the<br>
medium is removed, and the cells are washed twice with PBS.<br>
» After the second wash with PBS, the plates are tapped gently<br>
to remove excess PBS, and the cells are placed at -70°C for<br>
at least 3 0 min.  The cells are thawed and analyzed using<br>
the CyQuant fluorescent dye (Molecular Probes C-7026),<br>
following the manufacturer's recommendations.  The plates<br>
are read on a Victor/Wallac 1420 workstation at 485-nm/530<br><br>
run (excitation/emission) .  Raw data are collected and analyzed using a 4-parameter fit equation in XLFit.  IC50 values are then determined.<br>
Examples 4, 1,   20-21, 25-26, 28, 33, 67, 72(f-i, n-o) . 78, 82, 84, 86, 94-95, 97-100, 105, 111-112, 115-118, 130, 133, 138, 140, 151, 154-156, 158-159, 165, 167, 169, 817, 826-829, 831-838, 840-844, 845, 847-851, 853, 855-860, 862, 864, 873, 900, 904-905, 916-917, 922-924, 942-944, 946, 951-952, 954-955, 963-964, 973, 977-978, 982, 985, 991, 995, 1000 and 1008 inhibited VEGF-stimulated HUVEC proliferation at a level below 50 nm.<br>
Angiogenesls Model<br>
To determine the effects of the present compounds on angiogenesis in  vivo,   selective compounds are tested in the rat corneal neovascularization micropocket model or the angiogenesis assay of Passaniti, Lab. Invest., 67, 519-28 (1992).<br>
Rat Corneal Neovascularization Micropocket Model<br>
In Life Aspects: Female Sprague Dawley rats weighing approximately 250 g were randomized into one of five treatment groups.  Pretreatment with the vehicle or compound was administered orally, 24 h prior to surgery and continued once a day for seven additional days.  On the day of surgery, the rats were temporarily anesthetized in an Isofluorane gas chamber (delivering 2.5 liters/min oxygen + 5% Isofluorane).  An othoscope was then placed inside the mouth of the animal to visualize the vocal cords.  A tip-bliznted wire was advanced in between the vocal cords and used as a guide for the placement of an endotracheal Teflon tube (Small Parts Inc. TFE-standard Wall R-SWTT-18).  A volume-controlled ventilator (Harvard Apparatus, Inc. Model<br><br>
683) was connected to the endotracheal tube to deliver a mixture of oxygen and 3% Isofluorane.  Upon achieving deep anesthesia, the whiskers were cut short and the eye areas and eyes gently washed with Betadine soap and rinsed with sterile saline.  The corneas were irrigated with one to two drops of Proparacaine HCl ophthalmic topical anesthetic solution (0.5%) (Bausch and Lomb Pharmaceuticals, Tampa FL) , The rat was then positioned under the dissecting microscope and the corneal surface brought into focus.  A vertical incision was made on  the midline of the cornea using a diamond blade knife.  A pocket was created by using fine scissors to separate the connective tissue layers of the stroma, tunneling towards the limbus of the eye.  The distance between the apex of the pocket and the limbus was approximately 1.5 mm.  After the pocket had been made, the soaked nitrocellulose disk filter (Gelman Sciences, Ann Arbor MI.) was inserted under the lip of the pocket.  This surgical procedure was performed on both eyes.  rHu-bFGF soaked disks were placed into the right eye, and the rHu-VEGF  soaked disks were placed into the left eye.  Vehicle soaked disks were placed in both eyes.  The disk was pushed into position at the desired distance from the limbal vessels. Ophthalmic antibiotic ointment was applied to the eye to prevent drying and infection.  After seven days, the rats were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation, and the eyes enucleated. The retinal hemisphere of the eye was windowed to facilitate fixation, and the eye placed into formalin overnight.<br>
Post Mortem Aspects: After twenty-four hours in fixative, the corneal region of interest was dissected out from the eye, using fine forceps and a razorblade. The retinal hemisphere was trimmed off and the lens extracted and discarded. The corneal dome was bisected and the superfluous cornea trimmed off.  The iris, conjunctiva and<br><br>
associated limbal glands were then carefully teased away. Final cuts were made to generate a square 3x3mm containing the disk, the linbus, and the entire zone of neovascularization.<br>
Gross Image Recording: The corneal specimens were digitally photographed using a Sony CatsEye DKC5000 camera (A.G. Heinz, Irvine CA) mounted on a Nikon SMZ-U stereo microscope (A.G. Heinz).  The corneas were submerged in distilled water and photographed via trans-illumination at approximately 5.0 diameters magnification.<br>
Image analysis: Numerical endpoints were generated using digital micrographs collected from the whole mount corneas after trimming and were used for image analysis on the Metamorph image analysis system (Universal Imaging Corporation, West Chester PA) . Three measurements were taken: Disk placement distance from the limbus, number of vessels intersecting a 2.0mm perpendicular line at the midpoint of the disk placement distance, and percent blood vessel area of the diffusion determined by thresholding.<br>
General Formulations: O.l% BSA in PBS vehicle: 0.025 g of BSA was added to 25.0 ml of sterile IX phosphate buffered saline, gently shaken until fully dissolved, and filtered at 0.2 µm. Individual 1.0 ml Scimples were aliquoted into 25 single use vials, and stored at -20°C until use. For the rKu-bFGF disks, a vial of this 0.1% BSA solution was allowed to thaw at room temperature. Once thawed, 10 µ1 of a 100 mM stock solution of DTT was added to the 1 ml BSA vial to yield a final concentration of 1 mM DTT in 0.1% BSA. rHu-VEGF Dilutions:<br>
Prior to the disk implant surgery, 23.8 µ1  of the 0.1% BSA vehicle above was added to a 10 µg  rKu-VEGF lyophilized vial yielding a final concentration of 10 µM. rHu-bFGF: Stock concentration of 180 ng/ptl:<br><br>
R£D rHu- bFGF: Added 139 µ1  of the appropriate vehicle above to the 25 µg vial lyophilized vial. 13.3 µ1 of the [180 ng/µl] stock vial and added 26.6 µl of vehicle to yield a final concentration of 3.75 ^M concentration. Nitro-cellulose disk preparation: The tip of a 20-gauge needle was cut off square and beveled with emery paper to create a punch.  This tip was then used to cut out =0,5mm diameter disks from a nitrocellulose filter paper sheet (Gelman Sciences). Prepared disks were then placed into Eppendorf microfuge tubes containing solutions of either 0.1% BSA in PBS vehicle, 10 µM rHu-VEGF (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), or 3.75 µM rHu-bFGF {R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and allowed to soak for 45-60 min before use.  Each nifrocellulose filter disk absorbs approximately<br>
0,1 µ1 of solution.<br>
In the rat micropocket assay, compounds of the present invention will inhibit angiogenesis at a dose of less than 50 mg/kg/day.<br>
Tumor model<br>
A431 cells (ATCC) are expanded in culture, harvested and injected subcutaneously into 5-8 week old female nude mice (GDI nu/nu, Charles River Labs) (n=5-15).  Subsequent administration of compound by oral gavage (10 - 200 mpk/dose) begins anywhere from day 0 to day 29 post tumor cell challenge and generally continues either once or twice a day for the duration of the experiment.  Progression of tumor growth is followed by three dimensional caliper measurements and recorded as a function of time.  Initial statistical analysis is done by repeated measures analysis of variance (RMANOVA), followed by Scheffe post hoc testing for multiple comparisons. Vehicle alone (Ora-Plus, pH 2.0) is the negative control.  Compounds of the present invention are active at doses less than 150 mpk.<br><br>
Rat Adjuvant Arthritis Model;<br>
The rat adjuvant archritis model (Pearson, Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. 91, S5-101 (1956)) is used to test the anti-arthritic activity of compounds of the formula I, or salts thereof.  Adjuvant Arthritis can be treated using two different dosing schedules: either (i) starting time of immunization with adjuvant (prophylactic dosing); or from day 15 when the arthritic response is already established (therapeutic dosing). Preferably a therapeutic dosing schedule is used.<br>
Rat Carrageenan-lnduced Analgesia Test<br>
The rat carrageenan analgesia test was performed with materials, reagents and procedures essentially as described by Kargreaves, et al., (Pain, 32, 77 (1988)). Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated as previously described for the Carrageenan Foot Pad Edema test. Three hours after the injection of the carrageenan, the rats were placed in a special plexiglass container with a transparent floor having a high intensity lamp as a radian heat source, positionable under the floor. After an initial twenty minute period, thermal stimulation was begun on either the injected foot or on the contralateral uninjected foot, A photoelectric cell turned off the lamp and timer when light was interrupted by paw withdrawal. The time until the rat withdraws its foot was then measured. The withdrawal latency in seconds was determined for the control and drug-treated groups, and percent inhibition of the hyperalgesic foot withdrawal determined.<br><br>
Formulations<br>
Also embraced within this invention is a class of pharmaceutical compositions comprising the active compounds of Formula I in association with one or more non-toxic, pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers and/or diluents and/or adjuvants (collectively referred to herein as -carrier-materials) and, if desired, other active ingredients. The active compounds of the present invention may be administered by any suitable route, preferably in the form of a pharmaceutical composition adapted to such a route, and in a dose effective for the treatment intended. The compounds and compositions of the present invention may, for example, be administered orally, mucosally, topically, rectally, pulmonarily such as by inhalation spray, or parentally including intravascularly, intravenously, intraperitoneally, subcutaneously, intramuscularly intrasternally and infusion techniques, in dosage unit formulations containing conventional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants, and vehicles.<br>
The pharmaceutically active compounds of this invention can be processed in accordance with conventional methods of pharmacy to produce medicinal agents for administration to patients, including humans and other mammals.<br>
For oral administration, the pharmaceutical composition may be in the form of, for example, a tablet, capsule, suspension or liquid. The pharmaceutical composition is preferably made in the form of a dosage unit containing a particular amount of the active ingredient. Examples of such dosage units are tablets or capsules. For example, these may contain an amount of active ingredient from about 1 to 2000 mg, preferably from about 1 to 500 mg or 5 to 1000 mg.  A suitable daily dose for a human or other mammal may vary widely depending on the condition of<br><br>
the patient and other factors, but, once again, can be determined using routine methods.<br>
The amount of compounds which are administered and the dosage regimen for treating a disease condition with the compounds and/or compositions of this invention depends on a variety of factors, including the age, weight, sex and medical condition of the subject, the type of disease, the severity of the disease, the route and frequency of administration, and the particular compound employed. Thus, the dosage regimen may vary widely, but can be determined routinely using standard methods.  A daily dose of about 0,01 to 500 mg/kg, preferably between about 0.1 and about 50 mg/kg, and more preferably about 0.1 and about 20 mg/kg body weight may be appropriate. The daily dose can be administered in one to four doses per day.<br>
For therapeutic purposes, the active compounds of this invention are ordinarily combined with one or more adjuvants appropriate to the indicated route of administration. If administered per os, the compounds may be admixed with lactose, sucrose, starch powder, cellulose esters of alkanoic acids, cellulose alkyl esters, talc, stearic acid, magnesium stearate, magnesium oxide, sodium and calcium salts of phosphoric and sulfuric acids, gelatin, acacia gum, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and/or polyvinyl alcohol, and then tableted or encapsulated for convenient administration. Such capsules or tablets may contain a controlled-release formulation as may be provided in a dispersion of active compound in hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose.<br>
In the case of psoriasis and other skin conditions, it may be preferable to apply a topical preparation of compounds of this invention to the affected area two to four times a day.<br><br>
Formulations suitable for topical administration include liquid or semi-liquid preparations suitable for penetration through the skin (e.g., liniments, lotions, ointments, creams, or pastes) and drops suitable for administration to the eye, ear, or nose.  A suitable topical dose of active ingredient of a compound of the invention is 0.1 mg to 150 mg administered one to four, preferably one or two times daily.  For topical administration, the active ingredient may comprise from 0.001% to 10% w/w, e.g., from 1% to 2% by weight of the formulation, although it may comprise as much as 10% w/w, but preferably not more than 5% w/w, and more preferably from 0.1% to 1% of the formulation.<br>
When formulated in an ointment, the active ingredients may be employed with either paraffinic or a water-miscible ointment base. Alternatively, the active ingredients may be formulated in a cream with an oil-in-water cream base. If desired, the aqueous phase of the cream base may include, for example at least 30% w/w of a polyhydric alcohol such as propylene glycol, butane-1,3-diol, mannitol, sorbitol, glycerol, polyethylene glycol and mixtures thereof. The topical formulation may desirably include a compound which enhances absorption or penetration of the active ingredient through the skin or other affected areas. Examples of such dermal penetration enhancers include dimethylsulfoxide and related analogs.<br>
The compounds of this invention can also be administered by a transdermal device. Preferably transdermal administration will be accomplished using a patch either of the reservoir and porous membrane type or of a solid matrix variety. In either case, the active agent is delivered continuously from the reservoir or microcapsules through a membrane into the active agent permeable adhesive, which is in contact with the skin or mucosa of the recipient. If the<br><br>
active agent is absorbed through the skin, a controlled and predetermined flow of the active agent is administered to the recipient. In the case of microcapsules, the encapsulating agent may also function as the membrane.<br>
The oily phase of the emulsions of this invention may be constituted from known ingredients in a known manner. While the phase may comprise merely an emulsifier, it may comprise a mixture of at least one emulsifier with a fat or an oil or with both a fat and an oil. Preferably, a hydrophilic emulsifier is included together with a lipophilic emulsifier which acts as a stabilizer. It is also preferred to include both an oil and a fat. Together, the emulsifier(s) with or without stabilizer(s) make-up the so-called emulsifying wax, and the wax together with the oil and fat make up the so-called emulsifying ointment base which forms the oily dispersed phase of the cream formulations. Emulsifiers and emulsion stabilizers suitable for use in the formulation of the present invention include Tween 60, Span 80, cetostearyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, glyceryl monostearate, sodium lauryl sulfate, glyceryl distearate alone or with a wax, or other materials well known in the art.<br>
The choice of suitable oils or fats for the formulation is based on achieving the desired cosmetic properties, since the solubility of the active compound in most oils likely to be used in pharmaceutical emulsion formulations is very low. Thus, the cream should preferably be a non-greasy, non-staining and washable product with suitable consistency to avoid leakage from tubes or other containers. Straight or branched chain, mono- or dibasic alkyl esters such as di-isoadipate, isocetyl stearate, propylene glycol diester of coconut fatty acids, isopropyl myristate, decyl oleate, isopropyl palmitate, butyl stearate, 2-ethylhexyl palmitate or a blend of branched<br><br>
chain esters may be used. These may be used alone or in combination depending on the properties required. Alternatively, high melting point lipids such as white soft paraffin and/or liquid paraffin or other mineral oils can be used.<br>
Formulations suitable for topical administration to the eye also include eye drops wherein the active ingredients are dissolved or suspended in suitable carrier, especially an aqueous solvent for the active ingredients. The active ingredients are preferably present in such formulations in a concentration of 0.5 to 20%, advantageously 0.5 to 10% and particularly about 1.5% w/w.<br>
Formulations for parenteral administration may be in the form of aqueous or non-aqueous isotonic sterile injection solutions or suspensions. These solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders or granules using one or more of the carriers or diluents mentioned for use in the formulations for oral administration or by using other suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The compounds may be dissolved in water, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, ethanol, corn oil, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, sesame oil, benzyl alcohol, sodium chloride, tragacanth gum, and/or various buffers. Other adjuvants and modes of administration are well and widely known in the pharmaceutical art. The active ingredient may also be administered by injection as a composition with suitable carriers including saline, dextrose, or water, or with cyclodextrin (ie. Captisol), cosolvent solubilization (ie. propylene glycol) or micellar solubilization (ie. Tween 80) .<br>
The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butanediol.  Among the acceptable vehicles<br><br>
and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, and isotonic sodium chloride solution.  In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium.  For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed, including synthetic mono- or diglycerides.  In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.<br>
For pulmonary administration, the pharmaceutical composition may be administered in the form of an aerosol or with an inhaler including dry powder aerosol.<br>
Suppositories for rectal administration of the drug can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient such as cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols that are solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum and release the drug.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions may be subjected to conventional pharmaceutical operations such as sterilization and/or may contain conventional adjuvants, such as preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, buffers etc. Tablets and  pills can additionally be prepared with enteric coatings.  Such compositions may also comprise adjuvants, such as wetting, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents.<br>
The foregoing is merely illustrative of the invention and is not intended to limit the invention to the disclosed compounds.  Variations and changes which are obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be within the scope and nature of the invention which are defined in the appended claims.<br>
