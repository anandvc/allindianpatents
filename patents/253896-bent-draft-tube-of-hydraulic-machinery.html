				<td>TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
BENT DRAFT TUBE OF HYDRAULIC MACHINERY<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]<br>
This application is based upon and claims the<br>
benefit of priority from the prior Japanese Patent<br>
Application No. 2006-117659, filed on April 21, 2006;<br>
the entire contents of which are incorporated herein<br>
by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0002]<br>
The present invention relates to a bent draft<br>
tube of a hydraulic machinery.<br>
Description of the Background<br>
[0003]<br>
A bent draft tube of a hydraulic machinery has<br>
functions for leading flowing water from a runner exit<br>
to a tailrace and effectively utilizing a position<br>
energy of the flowing water at the runner exit, for<br>
simultaneously commutating the flow by enlarging<br>
slowly the flowing water path and reducing the flow<br>
speed, and thereby for efficiently converting a speed<br>
energy at the runner exit to a pressure energy.<br>
[0004]<br>
Fig. 9 is a conceptual diagram of a bent draft<br>
tube of a general Francis pump-turbine. As shown in<br>
Fig. 9, the flowing water from runner 11 passes<br>
through an upper draft 12 and a bent portion inlet<br>
section 13, and the flowing direction of the water is<br>
changed by a bent portion 14, and then the flowing<br>
water is decelerated by an enlarging portion 15, and<br>
thus the pressure is recovered. The enlarging portion<br>
15 is formed to incline at a swing-up angle y to the<br>
side of a center line X of the hydraulic machinery<br>
from a lowest point 16 in the flow path of the draft<br>
tube in the horizontal direction so as to increase the<br>
sectional area toward the downstream side.<br>
Hereinafter, a section obtained by cutting a part of<br>
the draft tube along the surface perpendicular to a<br>
direction of an axial line (a center line S) of a tube<br>
path of the draft tube will be referred to as a<br>
"section" at the part. In Fig. 9, Y indicates a line<br>
of a rotary shaft of the hydraulic machinery and F<br>
indicates a depth of the draft tube.<br>
[0005]<br>
When the sectional area of the flow path of the<br>
enlarging portion 15 is wide, there is a case that a<br>
center pear for dividing the flow from the<br>
neighborhood of the enlarging portion 15 is installed,<br>
and the component in the rotational direction of the<br>
flow of flowing water from the runner is canceled<br>
effectively, and a flow commutation effect due to the<br>
prevention of a sudden increase in the sectional area<br>
is added, and thus the pressure may be recovered<br>
efficiently.<br>
[0006]<br>
There is a bent draft tube available such that<br>
the area of the section in the vertical direction<br>
within at least a predetermined range on the upstream<br>
side from the boundary of the bent portion among the<br>
upper parts of the draft tube increases as the<br>
distance from the runner exit gets longer, and a width<br>
in a longitudinal direction of the section in the<br>
vertical direction within the predetermined range is<br>
kept constant, and in the bent portion of the draft<br>
tube, a width in a horizontal direction of the section<br>
in the vertical direction is made wider than a width<br>
in the longitudinal direction thereof, and the loss in<br>
the bent portion is reduced, and the earth excavating<br>
amount is reduced (for example, refer to Patent<br>
Document 1).<br>
[0007]<br>
Here, assuming that a part of the draft tube is<br>
cut in a direction vertical to the axial line of the<br>
tube path of the draft tube, a section thus obtained<br>
is called "a section in the vertical direction" at the<br>
part of the draft tube. Further, assuming that a<br>
straight line is obtained which is a cross line of a<br>
plane including the section in the vertical direction<br>
of the draft tube and a plane including the axial line<br>
of the draft tube, a direction of the straight line is<br>
called as "a longitudinal direction" of the section in<br>
the vertical direction, and a direction perpendicular<br>
to the longitudinal direction is called as "a<br>
horizontal direction" of the section in the vertical<br>
direction.<br>
[0008]<br>
Generally, the draft tube is laid under the<br>
ground, so that it is necessary to excavate the ground<br>
according to the shape of the draft tube. In the bent<br>
draft tube of the hydraulic machinery with the<br>
enlarging portion 15 having a swing-up angle y on the<br>
side of the center line X of the hydraulic machinery,<br>
the earth excavating amount may be small. Further,<br>
the draft tube depth F is designed to be shallow, and<br>
thus the earth excavating amount may be reduced.<br>
Further there is a bent draft tube available such that<br>
the operation space and the excavating amount between<br>
a draft tube liner and a foundation concrete floor<br>
portion are reduced and in accordance with shortening<br>
of the construction work period, the construction cost<br>
is suppressed low (for example, refer to Patent<br>
Document 2).<br>
Patent Document 1: Japanese Patent Disclosure<br>
(Kokai) 2001-140741<br>
Patent Document 2: Japanese Patent Disclosure<br>
(Kokai) 2002-168171<br>
[0009]<br>
However, in the bent draft tube of the hydraulic<br>
machinery, aiming at a high performance, the draft<br>
tube is often designed to be deep, though at this time,<br>
the earth excavating amount is increased. When the<br>
bent draft tube is designed to be shallow, the<br>
pressure recovery by the bent draft tube cannot be<br>
realized efficiently, and the performance by the bent<br>
draft tube is reduced.<br>
[0010]<br>
Fig. 10 is a schematic diagram showing a flow<br>
mechanism in the bent draft tube. As shown in Fig. 10,<br>
when the bent draft tube is made shallow, a water<br>
flowing direction indicated by arrows 17 is changed<br>
suddenly in the neighborhood of the bent portion 14<br>
exit, so that in the neighborhood of the top of the<br>
bent portion 14 exit and the top of the enlarging<br>
portion 15, a flow separation 18 is caused. Therefore,<br>
the speed energy cannot be collected efficiently at<br>
the runner exit, and as a result, a reduction in the<br>
performance of the bent draft tube is caused. This<br>
bad influence causes a remarkable reduction in the<br>
performance at a time of an overload operation at a<br>
high flow rate, compared with at a time of a partial<br>
load operation at a low flow rate.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0011]<br>
The present invention is developed to solve the<br>
problem aforementioned, and is intended to provide a<br>
bent draft tube of a hydraulic machinery capable of<br>
suppressing a reduction in the performance at a time<br>
of an overload operation of a hydraulic machinery.<br>
[0012]<br>
According to an aspect of the present invention,<br>
there is provided a bent draft tube of a hydraulic<br>
machinery, the bent draft tube connecting runner of<br>
the hydraulic machinery for converting a position<br>
energy of flowing water to a rotation energy and a<br>
downstream tailrace. The bent draft tube includes a<br>
bent portion connected to an exit of the runner, and<br>
an enlarging portion directed horizontally and<br>
connected to the bent portion, with a sectional area<br>
increasing toward a downstream side. A lowest point<br>
of an inner side of the bent portion of the bent draft<br>
tube among lowest points in a flow path of the bent<br>
draft tube is positioned on the enlarging portion side<br>
from a section including a closest point to a line of<br>
a rotary shaft of the hydraulic machinery.<br>
[0013]<br>
According to the present invention, the lowest<br>
point of an inner side of the bent portion of the bent<br>
draft tube is defined as positioned on the enlarging<br>
portion side from the lowest point inside the flow<br>
path of the draft tube, and accordingly the draft tube<br>
is structured such that the curvature of an inner side<br>
of the bent portion further extends toward the<br>
enlarging portion. Therefore, the flow separation<br>
easily caused on the top of the draft tube can be<br>
suppressed, and the reduction in the performance at<br>
the time of the overload operation can be suppressed.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0015]<br>
Referring now to the drawings, wherein like<br>
reference numerals designate identical or<br>
corresponding parts throughout the several views, the<br>
embodiments of this invention will be described below.<br>
[0016]<br>
(First embodiment)<br>
Fig. 1 is a conceptual diagram of a bent draft<br>
tube of a hydraulic machinery according to a first<br>
embodiment of the present invention. In Fig. 1, an<br>
illustration of a hydraulic machiner*y which is a water<br>
turbine or a pump-turbine is omitted. The upper draft<br>
12 is constructed so that the sectional area thereof<br>
increases as the distance from the runner exit gets<br>
longer. Further, the enlarging portion 15 is<br>
constructed so that the lowest point 16 in the flow<br>
path of the draft tube is flat in the horizontal<br>
direction. Namely, among the lowest points 16 in the<br>
flow path of the draft tube, a closest point 16a to<br>
the line Y of the rotary shaft of the hydraulic<br>
machinery and subsequent points 16 (on the downstream<br>
side) are flat in the horizontal direction.<br>
[0017]<br>
On the other hand, the inner side of the bent<br>
portion 14 of the draft tube is expanded in the<br>
downstream side direction with predetermined swing-up<br>
angle toward the central line X of the hydraulic<br>
machinery. And it is constructed so that a lowest<br>
point 19 of the inner side of the bent portion 14 of<br>
the draft tube is located on the side of the enlarging<br>
portion 15 from the section including a lowest point<br>
16a in the flow path of the draft tube which is<br>
closest to the line Y of the rotary shaft of the<br>
hydraulic machinery.<br>
[0018]<br>
Now, assuming that the distance from the line Y<br>
of the rotary shaft of the hydraulic machinery to the<br>
lowest point 16a inside the flow path of the draft<br>
tube as Le, and the distance from the line Y of the<br>
rotary shaft line Y of the hydraulic machinery to the<br>
lowest point 19 of the inner side of the bent portion<br>
of the draft tube as Lemin, the characteristic shown<br>
in Fig. 2 is obtained as a relationship between a loss<br>
of the bent draft tube and (Lemin-Le)/Le.<br>
 [0019]<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, it is found that the loss of<br>
the bent draft tube of the hydraulic machinery is<br>
small within the range of (Lemin-Le)/Le from 0.10 to<br>
0.85. Therefore, the position of the lowest point 19<br>
of the inner side of the bent portion of the draft<br>
tube is decided so that 0.10 
is held.<br>
[0020]<br>
According to the first embodiment, the lowest<br>
point 19 of the inner side of the bent portion of the<br>
draft tube is positioned on the side of the enlarging<br>
portion 15 from the lowest point 16a inside the flow<br>
path of the draft tube. Accordingly, the bent draft<br>
tube is constructed so that the curvature of the inner<br>
side of the bent portion 14 further extends toward the<br>
enlarging portion 15. Therefore, the flow separation<br>
easily caused on the top of the inside of the draft<br>
tube can be suppressed, and the reduction in the<br>
performance at the time of the overload operation can<br>
be suppressed.<br>
[0021]<br>
(Second embodiment)<br>
Fig. 3 is a conceptual diagram of a bent draft<br>
tube of a hydraulic machinery according to a second<br>
embodiment of the present invention. In Fig. 3, the<br>
illustration of the hydraulic machinery which is a<br>
water turbine or a pump-turbine is omitted. The<br>
second embodiment is characterized in that the bent<br>
draft tube has a straight line portion 20 defined by<br>
an extension line of the side of the upper draft 12<br>
portion in the shape of the inner side of the bent<br>
portion 14 in the first embodiment shown in Fig. 1.<br>
[0022]<br>
In Fig. 3, the upper draft 12 is constructed so<br>
that the sectional area thereof increases as the<br>
distance from the runner exit gets longer. Further,<br>
the enlarging portion 15 is constructed so that the<br>
lowest point 16 in the flow path of the draft tube is<br>
flat in the horizontal direction. Further, the inner<br>
side of the bent portion of the draft tube is expanded<br>
in the downstream side direction with a predetermined<br>
swing-up angle toward the central line X of the<br>
hydraulic machinery. And it is constructed so that<br>
the lowest point 19 of the inner side of the bent<br>
portion of the draft tube is located on the side of<br>
the enlarging portion 15 from the section including<br>
the lowest point 16a in the flow path of the draft<br>
tube which is closest to the line Y of the rotary<br>
shaft of the hydraulic machinery.<br>
[0023]<br>
In such an inside shape of the bent portion 14,<br>
when taking a coordinate system in which the inlet<br>
section 13 of the bent portion 14 is taken as 0° and<br>
the section including the closest point 16a to the<br>
rotary shaft Y of the hydraulic machinery among the<br>
lowest points in the flow path of the draft tube forms<br>
an angle of 90°, the bent portion 14 is composed of<br>
with the shape having a straight line portion 20<br>
defined as an extension line of the side of the upper<br>
draft 12 portion up to the section from 40° to 50°<br>
along the section of the bent portion 14 of the draft<br>
tube. The reason is that the water flowing through<br>
the bent portion 14 slowly expands the sectional area<br>
thereof in the flow direction, and thus the pressure<br>
is recovered, though the flow path is bent, and thus<br>
the flowing direction is changed and a loss is caused,<br>
so that the loss is intended to be reduced.<br>
[0024]<br>
Fig. 3A is a diagram showing the loss inside the<br>
bent draft tube of the second embodiment of the<br>
present invention. In Fig. 3A, the upper draft 12 is<br>
of so-called a truncated cone shape and is constructed<br>
so that the sectional area thereof increases as the<br>
distance from the runner exit gets longer. The<br>
section of the enlarging portion 15 is of rectangular<br>
shape, and the sectional area thereof increases toward<br>
a downstream side. The bent portion 14 is a portion<br>
onverting the shape from the truncated cone shape<br>
section of the upper draft 12 to rectangular shape<br>
section of the enlarging portion 15. In Fig. 3A,<br>
references R, Y and G shows that the loss inside the<br>
draft tube are large, intermediate and low,<br>
respectively.<br>
[0025]<br>
Fig. 4 is a characteristic diagram showing the<br>
loss of the bent draft tube of the hydraulic machinery<br>
when the section from the 0° position of the bent<br>
portion 14 to the lowest point 19 of the inner side of<br>
the bent portion 14 of the draft tube is formed in a<br>
straight line shape. As shown in Fig. 4, it is found<br>
that when within the range from the 40° position of<br>
the bent portion 14 to the 50° position thereof, the<br>
inside of the bent portion 14 is formed in a straight<br>
line shape, and thus the separation of the flow at<br>
this portion is suppressed and the loss can be reduced<br>
Further, in the draft tube with a shape having the<br>
straight line portion up to a position beyond the 50°<br>
position of the bent portion 14, the curvature of the<br>
inner side of the bent portion becomes excessively<br>
large, so that in the straight line portion and<br>
subsequent portion, the separation of the flow is<br>
caused easily.<br>
[0026]<br>
On the other hand, at each part of the draft tube<br>
from the inlet section 13 of the bent portion 14,<br>
assuming an angle formed between the straight line<br>
portion 20 of the inner side of the bent portion 14<br>
and a perpendicular line to the central line X of the<br>
hydraulic machinery as a , an angle formed between a<br>
straight line connecting between the inlet section 13<br>
of the bent portion 14 and the section at an angle of<br>
5° with the inlet section 13 of the bent portion 14<br>
with respect to a central line S (described below) of<br>
the draft tube and the perpendicular line to the<br>
central line X of the hydraulic machinery as /3 , the<br>
draft tube shape is decided as a. &gt; /3 . Here, the<br>
central line S of the draft tube is obtained by<br>
connecting the center points of gravity of the<br>
sections obtained by cutting along the face<br>
perpendicular to the direction of the axial line<br>
(central line S) of the tube path of the bent draft<br>
tube. By doing this, the flowing direction not only<br>
on the inner peripheral side of the bent portion 14<br>
but also on the outer peripheral side thereof is<br>
changed slowly. Therefore, the collision loss on the<br>
outer peripheral side of the bent portion 14 can be<br>
reduced, and the reduction in the performance at the<br>
time of the overload operation can be suppressed.<br>
[0027]<br>
According to the second embodiment, the portion<br>
of the inner side of the bent portion 14 within the<br>
predetermined range is formed in a straight line shape,<br>
and the separation is suppressed, and thereby the loss<br>
is reduced. So that the flow separation at the time<br>
of the overload operation can be suppressed, and the<br>
reduction in the performance at time of the overload<br>
operation of the bent draft tube of the hydraulic<br>
machinery can be suppressed. Further, the flowing<br>
direction not only on the inner peripheral side of the<br>
bent portion 14 but also on the outer peripheral side<br>
thereof is changed slowly. Thus the collision loss on<br>
the outer peripheral side of the bent portion 14 can<br>
be reduced, and the reduction in the hydraulic<br>
performance at the time of the overload operation can<br>
be suppressed.<br>
[0028]<br>
(Third embodiment)<br>
Fig. 5 is a conceptual diagram of a bent draft<br>
tube of a hydraulic machinery according to a third<br>
embodiment of the present invention. In Fig. 5, the<br>
illustration of the hydraulic machinery which is a<br>
water turbine or a pump-turbine is omitted. The third<br>
embodiment is characterized in that an inner side<br>
curvature p i of the bent portion 14, -an outer side<br>
curvature p o of the bent portion 14 and a flow path<br>
height He of the section of the bent portion 14 are<br>
kept in a predetermined relationship, the flowing<br>
direction of the water on the outer peripheral side of<br>
the bent portion 14 is slowly converted, and thereby<br>
the collision loss is reduced on the outer peripheral<br>
side of the bent portion 14 in the first embodiment or<br>
the second embodiment shown in Fig. 1. or Fig. 3.<br>
[0029]<br>
In Fig. 5, it is assumed that the inner side<br>
curvature of the bent portion 14 is p i, the outer<br>
side curvature of the bent portion 14 is p o, and the<br>
flow path height of the section of the bent portion 14<br>
is He. Fig. 6 is a characteristic diagram showing the<br>
relationship between the loss of the bent draft tube<br>
of the hydraulic machinery and (I/(pi. + He) } / (I/p o) .<br>
As shown in Fig. 6, it is found that the loss of the<br>
bent draft tube of the hydraulic machinery is small<br>
within the range of {l/(pi + He)}/(l/po) from 1.5 to<br>
2.4. Further, when the loss is beyond the range, if<br>
the value is smaller than the lower limit, the<br>
collision loss increases and if the value is larger<br>
than the upper limit, the pressure recovery rate is<br>
degraded, so that in either case, the loss is great.<br>
[0030]<br>
Therefore, so that 1.5 ^ {l/(pi + He)}/(l/po) ^<br>
2.4 is held, the shape of the bent portion 14 of the<br>
bent draft tube is decided. By doing this, the inner<br>
side shape of the bent portion is in a shape inclined<br>
toward the outer peripheral side in each section of<br>
the straight portion and subsequent portion.<br>
[0031]<br>
According to the third embodiment, the flowing<br>
direction on the outer peripheral side is converted<br>
slowly, so that the collision loss on the outer<br>
peripheral side of the bent portion can be reduced.<br>
Therefore, the reduction in the hydraulic performance<br>
at the time of the overload operation can be<br>
suppressed.<br>
[0032]<br>
(Fourth embodiment)<br>
Fig. 7 is a conceptual diagram of a bent draft<br>
tube of a hydraulic machinery according to a fourth<br>
embodiment of the present invention. In Fig. 7, the<br>
illustration of the hydraulic machinery which is a<br>
water turbine or a pump-turbine is omitted. The fourth<br>
embodiment is characterized in that, a flow path<br>
height Heo of the bent draft tube at the 90° position<br>
of the bent portion 14 is specified to be set within a<br>
predetermined range in any of the first to third<br>
embodiments.<br>
[0033]<br>
Assuming that the draft tube depth is F and the<br>
flow path height of the draft tube at the 90° position<br>
of the bent portion 14 (that is the closest point 16a<br>
to the rotary shaft Y of the hydraulic machinery among<br>
the lowest points in the flow path of the draft tube)<br>
is Heo, the height Heo of the flow path of the draft<br>
tube is decided so as to set Heo/F within a<br>
predetermined range.<br>
[0034]<br>
Fig. 8 is a characteristic diagram showing the<br>
relationship between the loss of the bent draft tube<br>
of the hydraulic machinery and Heo/F. As shown in Fig,<br>
8, it is found that the loss of the bent draft tube of<br>
the hydraulic machinery is small within the range of<br>
Heo/F from 0.2 to 0.3.<br>
[0035]<br>
According to the fourth embodiment, the height<br>
Heo of the flow path of the draft tube at the position<br>
of the closest point 16a (the 90° position of the bent<br>
portion 14) to the rotary shaft Y of the hydraulic<br>
machinery among the lowest points in the flow path of<br>
the draft tube is specified within the predetermined<br>
range, so that the loss of the bent draft tube of the<br>
hydraulic machinery can be reduced.<br>
[0036]<br>
Obviously, numerous modifications and variations<br>
of the present invention are possible in light of the<br>
above teachings. It is therefore to be understood<br>
that within the scope of the appended claims, the<br>
invention may be practiced otherwise than as<br>
