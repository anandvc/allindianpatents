				<td>Field of Invention:<br>
Present Invention relates to a substituted benzimidazole compound with antihypertensive activity, wherein 5th position is substituted by an electron releasing group and 2nd position is substituted by an alkyl group. More particularly the present invention relates to substituted benzimidazole based compounds with optimized substitutions at 5th and 2nd positions wherein optimization is done with respect to substituted or unsubstituted alklysulfamoyl or Nitro group at 5th position and any one of ethyl, n-propyl, n-butyl and ethoxymethyl froup at 2nd position. The Benzimidazole derived angiotensin II receptor antagonists of the present invention are more potent than commercially available drugs like candesartan and losartan.<br>
Background and Prior art:<br>
The Renin-Angiotensin system (RAS) is a hormone system that helps regulate blood pressure and blood volume in the body. The system can be activated when there is a loss of blood volume or a drop in blood pressure. The Renin-Angiotensin system is involved in homeostasis to control systemic blood pressure, body fluid volume, and electrolyte balance and aldosetrone system. Angiotensin II is the effecter hormone which mediates all these controls by acting on ATI receptors. Angiotensin II converting enzyme inhibitors such as captopril, enalapril, etc., are the first kind of drug used in treatment of hypertension controlled by RAS. However due to side effects associated with use of these<br>
agents like dry cough and angioedema search for compounds acting at the receptor level was undertaken .Sarlesin and sarmesin are the first such compounds derived by modifying native Ang II. But due to their metabolic instability, poor oral bioavailability and partial agonist activity owing to their peptidic nature various research groups searched for non-peptide Ang II receptor antagonists. Furukawa et al disclosed the first of its kind compounds (S-8305 and S-8306). This development revolutionized the development of more potent such nonpeptide compounds. Losartan is the protypical Ang II receptor antagonist which was further taken up as lead by various research groups. A large number of such compounds have been reported in literature prepared by replacing the imidazole nucleus of losartan with various kinds of appropriately substituted heterocyclic heads appended to biphenyl system containing acidic function. Kubo et al reported a new series of Ang II receptor antagonists prepared by replacing imidazole nucleus of losartan with benzimidazole. Various substitutions have been carried out in benzo ring of the benzimidazole nucleus. 7-carboxylic acid derivatives (e.g., Candesartan) and 6-substituted derivatives (e.g., BIBR 277) emerged as the compound more potent than losartan. 4-position in benzo ring has not been found to be conducive to binding as any substituent at this position block the interaction of imidazole ring nitrogen with receptor site. Although much work has been carried out at 6-position and 7-position but on the basis of very limited data set it has been reported that 5-substituted benzimidazole derivatives are less potent than the corresponding 6-substituted ones. Taking 5-position as a potential site for modification we initially synthesized 5-nitro benzimidazole derivatives which displayed activity greater than the reference compounds, candesartan and losartan. The higher activity of this 5-nitro derivative as<br>
Ang II receptor antagonist may be due to interaction with a receptor pocket which may be filled up with appropriate electron withdrawing groups (such as nitro group) and remained unexploited by other research groups. On the basis of this data, present invention proposes a new binding site in the drug receptor interaction model.<br>

The novel compounds disclosed in the invention by formula (I) can be prepared using the<br>
reactions and techniques described (Scheme I) in this section. Briefly, substituted<br>
benzimidazole (2) is coupled with compound (5) in the presence of a base to produce a<br>
compound (6). Subsequently, the resulting 6 is subjected to chlorosulfonation followed<br>
by addition of alkyl amine to obtain compound 1 of the present invention.<br>
Starting material 2 is obtained by simple condensation of o-phenylene diamine with<br>
valeric acid.<br>
Condensation reaction is performed without the aid of any solvent as valeric acid itself<br>
provides a liquid medium for the reaction. Refluxing of the reactants followed by<br>
basification of the cooled reaction mixture provided 2.<br>
The bases employed in the recovery of compound 2 include sodium hydroxide or<br>
ammonia solution.<br>
Starting material 5 is obtained from 9H-flourenone through a three step process.<br>
In the first step 9H-flourenone is subjected to potash fusion at a temperature of 180-200<br>
C to provide an intermediate 3. This reaction is carried out as reported in literature.<br>
The second step involves acetamidomethylation of 3 to produce intermediate 4.<br>
The third step involves aliphatic substitution reaction in which acetamido group is<br>
replaced by chloro group to provide starting material 5.<br>
The invention is further elaborated with the help of following examples. However, these examples should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
