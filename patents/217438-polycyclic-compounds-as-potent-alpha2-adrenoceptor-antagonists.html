				<td>POLYCYCLIC COMPOUNDS AS POTENT ALPHA2-ADRENOCEPTOR<br>
ANTAGONISTS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to pharmacologically active arylquinolizine<br>
derivatives and related compounds and to their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and<br>
esters thereof, as well as to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to<br>
 their use as alpha2 antagonists.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Some compounds exhibiting alpha adrenergic activity are well known in the<br>
art. It is also generally known and accepted in the art that those compounds may be<br>
used for the treatment of a wide variety of diseases and conditions of the peripheric<br>
system and the central nervous system (CNS).<br>
The alpha adrenergic receptors can be divided on a pharmacological basis<br>
into alphal- and alpha2-adrenoceptors, which can both be further divided into<br>
subtypes. Three genetically encoded subtypes, namely alpha2A-, alpha2B- and<br>
alpha2C-adrenoceptors, have been discovered in human. Accordingly, ajpha2-<br>
adrenoceptors in humans have been subdivided into three pharmacological subtypes<br>
known as alpha2A-, alpha2B- and alpha2C-adrenoceptors. A fourth,<br>
pharmacologically defined subtype, alpha2D, is known in rodents and in some other<br>
mammals, and it corresponds to the genetically defined alpha2A-adrenoceptors.<br>
The alpha2-adrenoceptor subtypes have distinct tissue distributions and<br>
functional roles. For instance, while alpha2A-adrenoceptors are widely expressed in<br>
various tissues, alpha2C-adrenoceptors are concentrated in the CNS, and they appear<br>
to play a role in the modulation of specific CNS-mediated behavioural and<br>
physiological responses.                 <br>
Compounds that are non-specific to any of the above-mentioned alpha2<br>
subtypes, and compounds that are specific to certain alpha2 subtypes, are already<br>
known. For example, atipamezole is a non-specific alpha2 antagonist. Atipamezole<br>
has been described in, for example, EP-A-183 492 (cf. p. 13, compound XV) and<br>
Haapalinna, A. et al., Naunyn-Schmiedeberg"s Arch. Pharmacol. 356 (1997) 570-<br>
582. U.S. Patent No. 5,902,807 describes compounds that are selective antagonists<br>
for the alpha2C subtype and may be used in the treatment of mental illness, e.g.<br>
mental disturbance induced by stress. Such compounds include, for example, MK-<br>
912 and BAM-1303. Furthermore, WO-A-99 28300 discloses substituted imidazole<br>
derivatives having agonist-like activity for alpha2B- or 2B/2C-adrenoceptors. In<br>
addition, WO 01/64645 relates to derivatives of quinoline useful as alpha2<br>
antagonists, as well as to selective alpha2C antagonist agents. The disclosures of all<br>
documents cited above in this paragraph are incorporated by reference herein.<br>
Several arylquinolizine derivatives and related compounds have been<br>
described in the literature, some of which possess valuable pharmaceutical effects.<br>
For example, U.S.patents No. 4,806,545 and 4,044,012describe 1,1-disubstituted<br>
indolo[2,3-a]quinolizidines useful as vasodilators and antihypoxic agents. Further,<br>
substituted arylquinolizine derivatives, described for example in U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,686,226 possessing alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonistic activity are useful for<br>
example as antidepressant, antihypertensive, or antidiabetic agents or platelet<br>
aggregation inhibitors. In addition, U.S. Patent No. 3,492,303 relates to indolo[2,3-<br>
a]quinolizidines useful as central nervous system depressants. Molecular modelling<br>
of targets for synthesis of alphalA and alpha2 selective ligands is discussed in<br>
Griffith, R. et al., J. Comput.-AidedMol. Design 13 (1999) 69-78.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide further antagonists of alpha2-<br>
adrenoceptors that can be used for the treatment of diseases or conditions of the<br>
peripheric or central nervous system where alpha2-antagonists are indicated to be<br>
useful. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide further<br>
compounds to be used as alpha2 antagonist agents in the treatment of mammals,<br>
including humans and animals.<br>
The invention also provides compounds useful as selective alpha2C<br>
antagonist agents for the treatment of various disorders or conditions of the central<br>
i     nervous system where alpha2C antagonists are indicated to be useful.<br>
ACCOMPANYING<br>
o               BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Figures la and b show the results from two separate locomotor activity tests<br>
where the locomotor activity of mice was tested after injections of vehicle or<br>
amphetamine (amph) (4 micromol/kg). The mice were pre-treated (20 min before<br>
amphetamine) either with vehicle, the subtype non-selective alpha2-antagonist<br>
atipamezole (1 micromol/kg) or the alpha2C-antagonists, compound K (3<br>
micromol/kg)(Fig a) or compound L (3 micromol/kg)(Fig b). * p
and *** p
Figure 2 shows alpha2-agonist-induced sedation (measured as locomotor<br>
inhibition) in mice. The non-selective alpha2-antagonist atipamezole (Ati)<br>
antagonised the sedative effects of the alpha2-subtype non-selective agonist,<br>
dexmedetomidine (Dex; 50 nmol/kg s.c), while the alpha2C-selective antagonists<br>
did not have significant effects, (veh = vehicle). (***p
vehicle)<br>
Figure 3 shows the effect of the alpha2C-selective antagonists compound K<br>
(3 micromol/kg) and compound L (3 micromol/kg), the non-selective antagonist<br>
atipamezole (10 micromol/kg) and the reference antidepressants desipramine (10<br>
micromol/kg) and fluoxetine (10 micromol/kg) in the forced swimming test in rats.<br>
AH compounds, except atipamezole, increased activity (***p
vehicle).<br>
Figures 4a and 4b show the effect of compounds K and L on the startle reflex<br>
and its prepulse inhibition in rats. (Veh = vehicle). Asterisks as in Figure 1;<br>
comparisons were performed between PCP (phencyclidine) + vehicle and PCP +<br>
compounds K and L.<br><br>
Figures 5a and 5b show the effect of the non-selective antagonist atipamezole<br>
(ati) on the startle reflex and its prepulse inhibition in rats in the prescence of<br>
phencyclidine (PCP); (veh = vehicle). Asterisks as in Figure 1, compared to the<br>
vehicle + PCP -group.<br>

The compounds of formula I and IA, IB, IC, ID and IE, as well as the<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters thereof, are referred to below as the<br>
compounds of the invention, unless otherwise indicated.<br>
The invention includes within its scope all the possible stereoisomers of the<br>
compounds, including geometric isomers, e.g. Z and E isomers (cis and trans<br>
isomers), and optical isomers, e.g. diastereomers and enantiomers. Furthemore, the<br>
invention includes in its scope both the individual isomers and any mixtures thereof,<br>
e.g. racemic mixtures. The individual isomers may be obtained using the<br>
corresponding isomeric forms of the starting material or they may be separated after<br>
the preparation of the end compound according to conventional separation methods.<br>
For the separation of optical isomers, e.g. enantiomers, from the mixture thereof the<br>
conventional resolution methods, e.g. fractional crystallisation, may be used.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts, e.g. acid addition salts with both organic<br>
and inorganic acids are well known in the field of Pharmaceuticals. Non-limiting<br>
examples of these salts include chlorides, bromides, sulfates, nitrates, phosphates,<br>
sulfonates, formates, tartrates, maleates, citrates, benzoates, salicylates and<br>
ascorbates. Pharmaceutically acceptable esters, when applicable, may be prepared by<br>
known methods using pharmaceutically acceptable acids that are conventional in the<br>
field of Pharmaceuticals and that retain the pharmacological properties of the free<br>
form. Non-limiting examples of those esters include esters of aliphatic or aromatic<br>
alcohols, e.g. methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl and tert-butyl<br>
esters.<br>
The compounds of the invention can be prepared analogously or according to<br>
the methods known in the literature using suitable starting materials. The starting<br>
materials of formulae II, HI and IV are commercially available or can be prepared via<br>
a variety of known synthetic routes known in the literature.<br>
For example, the starting materials used are arylalkylamines of formula (II)<br>
wherein R1 is as defined above and X is NH, O, CH2 or S.<br>
When X is O, the amines of formula (II) can be prepared, for example,<br>
according to the process disclosed in the U.S. Patent Specification No. 4,710,504.<br>
When X is CH2, the compounds of formula (II) can be prepared as described in J.<br>
Med. Chem. 10 (1967) 856-859. When X is S, the compounds of formula (II) can be<br>
prepared by decarboxylation of the corresponding 3-(thianaphten-3-yl)-L-alanine.<br>
Other starting materials used are compounds of formula (III)<br>
wherein R3 is as defined above and R11 is OH or halogen.<br>
Furthermore, the starting materials used are compounds of formula (IV)<br>
wherein R3-R7 and Z are as defined above and Y is O or NH. Compounds of<br>
formula (IV) can be prepared according to the methods described in Tetrahedron 33<br>
(1977) 1803-1808. Analogously, the corresponding acid chlorides can be used<br>
instead of lactones (Y=O). When R3 and R5 form a ring, compounds of formula (IV)<br>
are obtained by the partial reduction of their corresponding anhydrides.<br>
In general, the compounds of formula (I), wherein X is NH, O or S, can be<br>
prepared e.g. analogously or according to the following reaction scheme 1 :<br>
Scheme 1<br>
wherein R1, R3-R7 and Z are as defined above.<br>
According to the reaction route of scheme I, alkylation of amines (II) with<br>
compounds of formula (III) gives amides (V) which are converted into enamines<br>
(VII) via beta carbolines (V) by Bischler-Napieralski reaction followed by ring D<br>
formation by allowing compounds of formula (VI) to react with 1,3-dihaloalkanes<br>
under basic conditions as described in Gazz. Chim. Jtal. Ill (1981) 257-267. In the<br>
last step, compounds of formula (I) are obtained<br>
1) by oxidation of enamines (VQ) using potassium iodide, iodide and air or<br>
2) by reaction of enamines (VII) with formaldehyde in presence of H?nig<br>
base at 60°C.<br>
Another route for preparing compounds of formula (I), wherein X is NR2, O,<br>
CH2 or S, is illustrated in scheme 2<br>
Scheme 2<br>
wherein X is NR2, O, CH2 or S, R1-R7 and Z are as defined above.<br>
In scheme 2 arylalkylamines of formula (II), wherein X is NH, O, CH2, or S,<br>
are reacted with compounds of formula (IV), or the corresponding acid chloride, to<br>
give amides (VIII) as described in Tetrahedron 33 (1977) 1803-1808. The Bischler-<br>
Napieralski cyclization of the intermediates (VIII) leads to enamines (IX) which are<br>
converted into compounds of formula (I).<br>
The compounds of formula (I), wherein X is NH, can be alkylated with<br>
alkylhalides in the presence of a suitable base at room temperature (Heterocycles 27<br>
(1988) 1179-1190) according to following scheme 3:<br>
wherein R1-R7 and Z are as defined above.<br>
A further method for preparing compounds of formula (I) is illustrated in<br>
scheme 4:<br>
Scheme 4<br>
wherein R2 is BOC and R1, R5 and R6 are as defined above.<br>
In scheme 4 pyridine is alkylated with tryptophyl bromides (X) to give<br>
pyridinium salts (XI) whose partial reduction gives compounds of formula (XII).<br>
Protection of compounds of formula (XII) using di-t-butyl dicarbonate under basic<br>
conditions gives compounds of formula (XIII). The Polonovski-Potier reaction of the<br>
obtained intermediates and their cyclisation using MeOH/HCl yield the compounds<br>
of formula (I).<br>
A further process for the preparation of compounds of formula (I), wherein X<br>
is O, S or NH, R1 and R3-R8 are as defined above, is shown in the following scheme<br>
5:<br>
Scheme 5<br>
In scheme 5 oxidative cyclization of derivative (XIV) with mercuric acetate<br>
according to the method described in Heterocycles 32 (1991) 489-497 gives enamine<br>
(XV). This intermediate can be oxidized or treated with formaldehyde as in scheme 1<br>
or reduced with sodium borohydride to give compounds of formula (I).<br>
A further method for preparing compounds of formula (I), wherein R6 and R7<br>
form a bond, is illustrated in scheme 6:<br>
wherein X is NH and R3 is lower alkyl.<br>
Applying the method described in J. Org. Chem. 52 (1987) 353-356, the<br>
hetero-Diels-Alder reaction of 3,4-dihydro-b-carboline (XVI) with diene ester<br>
(XVII), prepared by the Wittig reaction as described in Can. J. Chem. 65 (1987) 670-<br>
682, gives compounds of formula (XVHI), which are then reduced to alcohols of<br>
formula (I).<br>
A further method for preparing compounds of formula (I) is illustrated in<br>
scheme 7.<br>
Scheme 7<br>
wherein X, R1, R3, R7 and z are as defined above. R12 can be H or OCH3 and<br>
R13 can be an alkyl or aryl group.<br>
In scheme 7, compounds of formula (XIX), when R12 is H, are prepared as<br>
described in J. Chem. Soc, Chem. Commun. (1995) 2317-2318, and compounds of<br>
formula (XDC), when R12 is OCH3, are prepared as described in J. Chem. Soc. (C)<br>
(1971) 736-743. Compounds of formula (XIX) are reacted with Grignard reagents to<br>
give compounds of formula (I). When R12 in formula (XIX) is H, the other R13 group<br>
in formula (I) is also H.<br>
A new method to prepare certain compounds of formula (I) is shown in<br>
scheme 8.<br>

material or intermediate can be protected, if necessary, in manner well known in the<br>
chemical field. Any protected functionality is subsequently deprotected in a usual<br>
manner.<br>
It should be noted that the above described synthetic routes are meant to<br>
illustrate the preparation of the compounds of the invention and the preparation is by<br>
no means limited thereto, i.e. other synthetic methods which are within the general<br>
knowledge of a skilled person are also possible.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be converted, if desired, into their<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester form using methods well known in the art.<br>

EXPERIMENT II: In vitro antagonism on the alpha2-adrenoceptors<br>
The functional activities of two compounds (K and L) displaying alpha2C-<br>
selectivity in binding experiments were determined as the abilities of the compounds<br>
to inhibit the epinephrine-stimulated binding of 35S-GTPyS to G proteins (Jasper,<br>
J.R. et al., Biochem. Pharmacol. 55(7) (1998) 1035-44) in membranes of CHO cells<br>
stably transfected with the human alpha2-adrenoceptor subtypes. The antagonist<br>
potencies of compound K and compound L are presented in the Table 2. The results<br>
show that these compounds are selective antagonists for the alpha2C-subtypes.<br>
In vivo effects of alpha2C-selective compounds<br>
It is currently not well-known in the art what effects in vivo could be<br>
attributed to a selective alpha2C-antagonism. Based on available knowledge and our<br>
previous experience, we have selected two different behavioral models, namely d-<br>
amphetamine -stimulated locomotor activity model and the forced swimming test, in<br>
order to demonstrate specific alpha2C-antagonistic effects in the CNS of mice and<br>
rats in vivo. The selection of these methods is essentially based on published<br>
hypotheses on theoretical effects of alpha2C-antagonists; in the lack of suitable<br>
ligands, these hypotheses were based on studies employing mice with genetically<br>
altered alpha2C-adrenoceptor expression (Scheinin, M. et al., Life Sci 68(19-20)<br>
(2001) 2277-85).<br>
EXPERIMENT HI: D-amphetamine stimulated locomotor activity test<br>
Genetically modified mice having non-functional alpha2C-adrenoceptors<br>
(alpha2C-"knockout"; alpha 2C-KO) are more sensitive to the locomotor-enhancing<br>
effects of the psychostimulant d-amphetamine and, on the other-hand, over-<br>
expression of the alpha2C-adrenoceptor in mice (alpha2C-OE) leads to an opposite<br>
effect, i.e. to attenuation of the stimulant effect (Scheinin, M. et al., Life Sci 68(19-<br>
20) (2001) 2277-85). Thus, it could be hypothesized that alpha2C-antagonist would<br>
potentiate the locomotor effects of d-amphetamine.<br>
The above assumption was tested by administering groups of mice (n= 10-<br>
12/dose group) amphetamine (4 micromol/kg s.c.) either alone or together with the<br>
alpha2C-antagonists (3 micromol/kg s.c.) of this invention or with the alpha2-<br>
subtype non-selective potent alpha2-antagonist (1 micromol/kg s.c.) (Haapalinna, A.<br>
et al., Naunyn-Schmiedeberg"s Arch. Pharmacol 356 (1997) 570-582), and by<br>
subsequently measuring the locomotor activity of mice with an automated infrared<br>
photobeam system designed for activity studies (PAS CageRack, SanDiego<br>
Instruments, San Diego, CA., USA). As expected, both of the tested alpha2C-<br>
selective antagonists increased the activity of mice (Figure la+b), as was expected<br>
for alpha2C-antagonist. The subtype non-selective alpha2-antagonist also potentiated<br>
the d-amphetamine effect. The tested compounds did not affect the baseline<br>
locomotor activity of mice (at doses between 0.1 — 10 mg/kg s.c).<br>
EXPERIMENT IV: Antagonism of alpha2-agonist -induced sedation<br>
One of the prominent effects of non-selective alpha2-agonists in rodents is<br>
their ability to cause profound sedation. This effect, measured as locomotor<br>
inhibition by the alpha2-agonist dexmedetomidine was not modified in mice with<br>
genetically altered alpha2C-expression (Scheinin, M. et al., Life Sci 68(19-20) (2001)<br>
2277-85). On the other hand, alpha2-agonist did not have sedative effect in mice<br>
with genetically disrupted alpha2A-adrenoceptor (Hunter, J.C. et al., British Journal<br>
of Pharmacology 122(7) (1997) 1339-44). Therefore, since the sedative effect of<br>
alpha2-agonists is generally attributed to the alpha2A-adrenoceptor, it is expected<br>
that alpha2C-antagonists would not modulate significantly the alpha2-agonist-<br>
induced sedation. This assumption was tested in experiment, where<br>
dexmedetomidine was administered to mice pre-treated with the alpha2C-antagonists<br>
compound K or compound L, or the subtype non-selective antagonist atipamezole<br>
(Haapalinna, A. et al., Naunyn-Schmiedeberg"s Arch. Pharmacol. 356 (1997) 570-<br>
582). As expected, the alpha2C-antagonists did not have clear effects, whereas<br>
atipamezole effectively antagonised the effect of dexmedetomidine. This result<br>
demonstrates the lack of alpha2 A-antagonism of the alpha2C-selecti ve compounds<br>
of the present invention (Figure 2).<br>
EXPERIMENT V: Forced swimming test<br>
Forced swimming test (FST, i.e. Porsolt"s test) is generally used in the<br>
pharmacological screening of new antidepressants. In this test, antidepressants<br>
increase the animals" activity compared to non-treated controls. Alpha2C-KO mice<br>
appeared to be more active, and alpha2C-OE mice were less active in FST (U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,902,807 and Scheinin, M. et al., Life Sci 68(19-20) (2001) 2277-85).<br>
Therefore, it was tested, whether a selective alfa2C-antagonist would have<br>
antidepressant-like activity (e.g. activity-increasing property) in the FST. The figure<br>
3 shows how both of the alpha2C-compounds increased activity in this test as was<br>
expected based on studies on transgenic mice (Scheinin, M. et al., Life Sci 68(19-20)<br>
(2001) 2277-85) and as reported with recently developed alpha2C-antagonist (WO<br>
01/64645). Also the positive control substances desipramine and fluoxetine<br>
(clinically effective antidepressant agents) were active. The subtype non-selective<br>
alpha2-antagonist atipamezole did not possess antidepressant-like effect, as expected<br>
(WO 01/64645).<br>
EXPERIMENT VI: Prepulse inhibition of the startle reflex<br>
Prepulse-inhibition (PPI) of a startle response refers to the reduction in the<br>
startle response caused by a low intensity non-startling stimulus (the prepulse) which<br>
is presented shortly before the startle stimulus. PPI can be used as an operational<br>
measure of sensorimotor gating and appears to be present in all mammals, including<br>
rats and humans (Swerdlow, N.R. et al., The archives of general psychiatry 51<br>
(1994) 139-154). Normally functioning PPI can be disrupted by psychostimulants,<br>
such as d-amphetamine or phencyclidine (PCP), and reversed by clinically effective<br>
antipsychotics.<br>
In a previous study, alpha2C-KO mutation was associated with weakened PPI<br>
whereas alpha2C-OE demonstrated increased PPI. In other words, the genetically<br>
altered alpha2C-expression in mice was associated with changes in PPI in a way<br>
suggesting that an alpha2C-antagonist would decrease PPI (Scheinin, M. et al., Life<br>
Sci 68(19-20) (2001) 2277-85). This hypothesis was tested with compounds K and L<br>
alone and against PCP -disruption of the PPL<br>
Groups of rats (n -10/group) were administered the alpha2C-antagonists 20<br>
min before, and PCP or vehicle 10 min before measurement of the acoustic startle<br>
reactivity and PPI in a test system designed for startle studies (SR-LAB, San Diego<br>
Instruments, CA, USA). It was found that the alpha2C-antagonists were able to<br>
attenuate the PPI disruption caused by PCP (Figure 3). This was unexpected and<br>
opposite to the hypothesis based on transgenic studies. The non-selective alpha2-<br>
antagonist atipamezole produced different effects than was observed with the<br>
selective alpha2C-antagonists: atipamezole did not enhance PPI, but it increased the<br>
startle reflex per se (i.e. startle without prepulses)(Figure 4).<br>
In conclusion, the results presented in this chapter show that those antagonists<br>
which are classified as alpha2C-selective according to in vitro experiments, appeared<br>
to function as alpha2C-selective antagonists also in vivo in a manner that was<br>
predicted based on the available knowledge on alpha2C-antagonism. However, the<br>
finding that the alpha2C-antagonists did not decrease PPI, as predicted, but on the<br>
contrary, increased PPI, could be considered unexpected and this adds the novelty<br>
value of the now proposed usefulness of the compounds of the present invention.<br>
The compounds according to the invention may be used to treat any disease or<br>
condition wherein alpha-2 antagonists are indicated to be effective. The compounds<br>
can also be used to reverse effects induced by alpha-2 agonists. Accordingly, the<br>
compounds of the invention may be useful in the treatment of various disorders of<br>
the central nervous system (CNS), i.e. different neurological, psychiatric and<br>
cognition disorders (such as depression, anxiety disorders, post traumatic stress<br>
disorder, schizophrenia, Parkinson"s disease and other movement disorders).<br>
Furthermore, they may be used in the treatment of various peripheral disorders, e.g.<br>
diabetes, orthostatic hypotension, lipolytic disorders (such as obesity), Raynaud"s<br>
disease or both male and female sexual dysfunctions.<br>
The selective alpha-2C antagonists of the present invention may be used for<br>
the treatment of various disorders or conditions of CNS-system where alpha-2C<br>
antagonists are indicated to be beneficial, for example, to alleviate the symptoms of<br>
various mental disorders propagated by stress, Parkinson"s disease, depression,<br>
negative symptoms of schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, post-<br>
traumatic stress-disorder, and anxiety disorders.<br>
In addition, due to the novel and previously unpublished findings of the<br>
      effects of the present alpha2C-antagonists on the PCP -disrupted PPI, the alpha2C-<br>
selective compounds can also be used to treat disorders and conditions associated<br>
with sensorimotor gating deficits, particularly disorders and conditions wherein the<br>
sensorimotor gating deficits results in sensory flooding and cognitive fragmentation<br>
causing dysfunction in attention and perception. Such disorders and conditions<br>
I      include, but are not limited to, schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder,<br>
Tourette"s syndrome, blepharospasm and other focal dystonias, temporal lobe<br>
epilepsy with psychosis, drug-induced psychosis (for example, psychosis caused by<br>
chronic use of dopaminergic agents) (Braff, D.L. et al., Psychopharmacology (Berl)<br>
156(2-3) (2001) 234-258), Huntingdon"s disease, Parkinson"s disease, disorders<br>
caused by fluctuation of the levels of sex hormones (such as premenstrual<br>
syndrome), and panic disorder.<br>
Further, the symptoms which are usually associated with above-mentioned<br>
disorders or conditions include, but are not limited to, hallucination, delusion,<br>
parathymia, agitation, psychotic cognitive impairment (including deficits in thinking<br>
and speech), social withdrawal and withdrawal symptoms (including delirium)<br>
associated with cessation of cigarette smoking or alcohol or drug abuse. These<br>
symptoms may also be seen in animals in exceptional circumstances, for example,<br>
during withdrawal from masters or during transportation.<br>
Due to their selectivity of action, the alpha-2C antagonists of the invention<br>
have less or no undesirable side-effects attributed to non-selective alpha2-<br>
antagonism, such as increases in blood pressure, heart rate, salival secretions,<br>
gastrointestinal secretion, anxiety, and startle reactivity per se (RufFolo, R.RJ. et al.,<br>
Annu Rev Pharmacol Toxicol 32 (1993) 243-279).<br>
The compound of the invention can be administered for example enterally,<br>
topically or parenterally by means of any pharmaceutical formulation useful for said<br>
administration, and containing at least one active compound of formula I in<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable and effective amounts together with pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable diluents, carriers, and/or excipients known in the art. The manufacture of<br>
such pharmaceutical formulations is well known in the art.<br>
The therapeutic dose to be given to a patient in need of treatment will vary<br>
depending on the compound being administered, the species, age and the sex of the<br>
subject being treated, the particular condition being treated, as well as the route and<br>
method of administration, and are easily determined by person skilled in the art.<br>
Accordingly, the typical dosage for oral administration is from 5 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg<br>
per day and that for parenteral administration from 0.5 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg for an<br>
adult mammal.<br>
The present invention further provides a compound of the invention or an<br>
ester or salt thereof for use as alpha-2 antagonist. Furthermore, a method for the<br>
treatment of diseases or conditions where alpha-2 antagonists, e.g. alpha-2C<br>
antagonists, are indicated to be useful, e.g. a method for the treatment of diseases or<br>
conditions of the central nervous system, is provided. In such a method a<br>
therapeutical ly effective amount of a compound of the invention is administered to a<br>
subject in need of such treatment. The use of the compounds of the invention for the<br>
manufacture of a medicament to be used for the above indications is also provided.<br>
Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the embodiments described in this<br>
application could be modified without departing from the broad inventive concept.<br>
Those skilled in the art also understand that the invention is not limited to the<br>
