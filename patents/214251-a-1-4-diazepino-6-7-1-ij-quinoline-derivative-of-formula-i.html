				<td>"A [1,4] DIAZEPINO [6,7,1-11] QUINOLINE DERIVATIVE OF FORMULA I"<br>
This invention relates to [1,4]diazepino[6,7,1-ij]quinoiine derivatives useful as<br>
antipsychotic and antiobesity agents, to processes for their preparation, to<br>
pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to methods of using them.<br>
Schizophrenia affects approximately 5 million people. At present, the most<br>
widespread treatments for schizophrenia are the "atypical1 antipsychotics, which<br>
combine dopamine (D2) receptor antagonism with serotonin (5-HT2a) receptor<br>
antagonism. Despite the reported advances in efficacy and side-effect liability of<br>
atypical antipsychotics over typical antipsychotics, these compounds do not<br>
adequately treat all of the symptoms of schizophrenia and are accompanied by<br>
problematic side effects including weight gain (Allison, D. B., et. al., Am. J.<br>
Psychiatry, 156: 1686-1696, 1999; Masand, P. S., Exp. Opin. Pharmacother. I: 377-<br>
389, 2000; Whitaker, R., Spectrum Life Sciences. Decision Resources. 2:1-9, 2000).<br>
Novel antipsychotics which are effective in treating the mood disorders or the<br>
cognitive impairments in schizophrenia without producing weight gain would<br>
represent a significant advance in the treatment of schizophrenia.<br>
5-HT2c agonists and partial agonists represent a novel therapeutic approach<br>
toward the treatment of schizophrenia. Several lines of evidence support a role for<br>
5-HT2c receptor agonism as a treatment for schizophrenia. Studies with 5-HT2c<br>
antagonists suggest that these compounds increase synaptic levels of dopamine<br>
and may be effective in animal models of Parkinson"s disease (Di Matteo, V., et. al.,<br>
Neuropharmacology 37: 265-272, 1998; Fox, S. H., et. al., Experimental Neurology<br>
151: 35-49, 1998). Since the positive symptoms of schizophrenia are associated<br>
with increased levels of dopamine, compounds with actions opposite those of 5-HT2C<br>
antagonists such as 5-HT2C agonists and partial agonists should reduce levels of<br>
synaptic dopamine. Recent studies have demonstrated that 5-HT2c agonists<br>
decrease levels of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens (Millan,<br>
M. J., et. al., Neuropharmacology 37: 953-955, 1998; Di Matteo, V., et. al.,<br>
Neuropharmacology 38: 1195-1205, 1999; Di Giovanni, G., et. al., Synapse 35: 53-<br>
61, 2000), brain regions that are thought to mediate critical antipsychotic effects of<br>
drugs like clozapine. In contrast, 5-HT2c agonists do not decrease dopamine levels<br>
in the striatum, the brain region most closely associated with extrapyramidal side<br>
effects. In addition, a recent study demonstrates that 5-HT2c agonists decrease<br>
firing in the ventral tegmentai area (VTA), but not in substantia nigra. The differential<br>
effects of 5-HT2C agonists in the mesolimbic pathway relative to the nigrostriatal<br>
pathway suggests that 5-HT2c agonists will have limbic selectivity and will be less<br>
likely to produce extrapyramidai side effects associated with typical antipsychotics.<br>
Atypical antipsychotics bind with high affinity to 5-HT2c receptors and function<br>
as 5-HT2C receptor antagonists or inverse agonists. Weight gain is a problematic<br>
side effect associated with atypical antipsychotics such as ciozapine and olanzapine<br>
and it has been suggested that 5-HT2c antagonism is responsible for the increased<br>
weight gain. Conversely, stimulation of the 5-HT2C receptor is known to result in<br>
decreased food intake and body weight (Walsh et. al., Psyche-pharmacology 124:<br>
57-73, 1996; Cowen, P. J., et. al., Human Psychopharmacology 10: 385-391, 1995;<br>
Rosenzweig-Lipson, S., et. al., ASPET abstract, 2000). As a result, 5-HT2C agonists<br>
and partial agonists will be less likely to produce the body weight increases<br>
associated with current atypical antipsychotics. Indeed, 5-HT2C agonists and partial<br>
agonists are of great interest for the treatment of obesity, a medical disorder<br>
characterized by an excess of body fat or adipose tissue and associated with such<br>
comorbidities as Type 11 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension,<br>
hyperlipidemia, stroke, osteoarthritis, sleep apnea, gall bladder disease, gout, some<br>
cancers, some infertility, and early mortality.<br>

or<br>
(e) hydrolysing a compound of formula I as defined herein wherein R1 is alkanoyl<br>

or<br>

Conveniently the compounds of this invention can be prepared according to<br>
the following schemes from commercially available starting materials or starting<br>
materials which can be prepared using literature procedures.. Variables used are as<br>
defined for Formula I, unless otherwise noted.<br>
In Scheme I, a substituted or unsubstituted benzodiazepinedione is reduced<br>
with a reducing agent, such as lithium aluminum hydride or a borane-tetrahydrofuran<br>
complex, to give a substituted or unsubstituted benzodiazepine. The baste nitrogen<br>
of the benzodiazepine is acylated with an acylating reagent , such as an acid<br>
anhydride or a chloroformate, in the presence of a base, such as triethylamine or<br>
hunigs base, in an organic solvent, such as ether or methylene chloride, to give<br>
intermediate I. Intermediate I is allowed to react with a formaldehyde equivalent,<br>
such as a solution of aqueous formaldehyde or dimethoxymethane, in the presence<br>
of a Lewis acid such as boron trifluoride, and a dienophile such as cydopentene or<br>
an alkyne to give the cycloadduct II. The cycloadduct is then treated under basic<br>
conditions, such as KOH in polar solvents like water and ethanol, to give III.<br>
Alternatively, II can be subjected to catalytic hydrogenolysis, such as palladium on<br>
charcoal to yield III. Compounds II, when the double bond is absent, are racemic<br>
mixtures which can be resolved using chiral HPLC to give separated enantiomers<br>
which can then be treated with an inorganic base, such as KOH in a polar solvent,<br>
such as water or methano! at elevated temperatures, such as 50-100 °C, to remove<br>
the acyl group giving enantiomers IV and V, which are products of this invention.<br>
Enantiomers IV and V can also be obtained by chiral salt resolution of racemic III<br>
using a resolving agent, such as benzoyltartaric acid, in an organic solvent, such as<br>
an alcohol.<br>
Compounds of the present invention where n is 2 can be prepared according<br>
to Scheme I above, except that the starting compound in Scheme I is replaced by<br>
compound XXI below and is subject to the same chemistry.<br>
This starting compound for where n is 2 in formula I can be prepared<br>
according to the following reaction Scheme la:<br>
In Scheme 1a, the appropriately substituted nitrotoluene XIV is treated with<br>
paraformaldehyde in the presence of a suitable base such a potassium hydroxide in<br>
a solvent such as DMSO-ethanol to give the phenylethanol XV, which is converted to<br>
the bromide XVI using standard procedures, such as treatment with carbon<br>
tetrabromide and triphenylphosphine in methylene chloride. The bromide is<br>
converted to the phenethylamine XVII by treatment with ammonia (R6 is hydrogen) at<br>
elevated temperature in a high pressure vessel and the phenethylamine alkylated<br>
with ethyl bromoacetate in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate in a<br>
suitable solvent such as acetonitrile or dimethylformamide. The resulting amino<br>
ester XVIII is hydrolyzed to the acid by treatment with hydrobromic acid to give the<br>
amino acid XIX. Following reduction of the aromatic nitro group with hydrogen in the<br>
presence of a suitable catalyst such as platinum on sulfided carbon or palladium on<br>
carbon, cyclization to 3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-1H-benzo[e][1,4]diazocin-2-one XXI is<br>
effected by treatment with a coupling reagent such as dicydohexylcarbodiimide in a<br>
solvent such as pyridine.<br>
Alternatively, the compounds of the present invention can also be prepared<br>
using the synthetic route shown in Scheme H.<br>
Anilines or appropriately N-substituted anilines such as N-benzyl aniline can<br>
be reacted with a formaldehyde equivalent, such as a solution of aqueous<br>
formaldehyde or dimethoxymethane, in the presence of a Lewis acid such as boron<br>
trifluoride, and a dienophile such as cyclopentene to give the cycloadduct. Wherever<br>
applicable, the R group on the nitrogen is subsequently deprotected to give<br>
intermediates VI. Intermediate VI can subsequently be alkylated, for instance with 2-<br>
chloroethyl amine under phase transfer conditions to yield VII. Alternatively, the side<br>
chain can also be installed via a two step procedure of alkylation with 2-chloro-<br>
acetamide followed by reduction. VH is then subject to a pictet-spengler cydization<br>
conditions with formaldehyde and a protic acid such as trifluoroacetic acid to yield<br>
VIII.<br>
VIII can be resolved subsequently into its pure enantiomers by a chiral<br>
resolution to give compounds IX and X. Alternatively, VIII can be derivatised<br>
appropriately to give XI which can be separated by chiral chromatography and then<br>
subject to cleavage to give IX and X. These compounds can then be derivatised, for<br>
example, by alkylation, to give compounds XII and Xlll, where R1 is a d to C6 aikyl.<br>
The compounds of this invention are agonists and partial agonists at the 2c<br>
subtype of brain serotonin receptors and are thus of interest for the treatment of<br>
mental disorders, including psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia including<br>
paranoid type, disorganized type, catatonic type, and undifferentiated type,<br>
schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, substance-<br>
induced psychotic disorder, and psychotic disorder not otherwise specified; L-DOPA-<br>
induced psychosis; psychosis associated with Alzheimer"s dementia; psychosis<br>
associated with Parkinson"s disease; psychosis associated with Lewy body disease;<br>
bipolar disorders such as bipolar I disorder, bipolar II disorder, and cyclothymic<br>
disorder; depressive disorders such as major depressive disorder, dysthymic<br>
disorder, substance-induced mood disorder, and depressive disorder not otherwise<br>
specified; mood episodes such as major depressive episode, manic episode, mixed<br>
episode, and hypomanic episode; anxiety disorders such as panic attack,<br>
agoraphobia, panic disorder, specific phobia, social phobia, obsessive compulsive<br>
disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, acute stress disorder, generalized anxiety<br>
disorder, separation anxiety disorder, substance-induced anxiety disorder, and<br>
anxiety disorder not otherwise specified; adjustment disorders such as adjustment<br>
disorders with anxiety and/or depressed mood; intellectual deficit disorders such as<br>
dementia, Alzheimer"s disease, and memory deficit; eating disorders (e.g.,<br>
hyperphagia, bulimia or anorexia nervosa) and combinations of these mental<br>
disorders that may be present in a mammal. For example, mood disorders such as<br>
depressive disorders or bipolar disorders often accompany psychotic disorders such<br>
as schizophrenia. A more complete description of the aforementioned mental<br>
disorders can be found in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,<br>
4th edition, Washington, DC, American Psychiatric Association (1994).<br>
The compounds of the present invention are also of interest for the treatment<br>
of epilepsy; migraines; sexual dysfunction; sleep disorders; gastrointestinal<br>
disorders, such as malfunction of gastrointestinal motility; and obesity, with Us<br>
consequent comorbidities including Type II diabetes, cardiovascular disease,<br>
hypertension, hyperiipidemia, stroke, osteoarthritis, sleep apnea, gall bladder<br>
disease, gout, some cancers, some infertility, and early mortality. The compounds<br>
of the present invention can also be used to treat central nervous system<br>
deficiencies associated, for example, with trauma, stroke, and spinal cord injuries.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can therefore be used to improve or inhibit<br>
further degradation of central nervous system activity during or following the malady<br>
or trauma in question. Included in these improvements are maintenance or<br>
improvement in motor and motility skills, control, coordination and strength.<br>
The ability of the compounds of this invention to act as 5HT2C agonists and<br>
partial agonists was established using several standard pharmacological test<br>
procedures; the procedures used and results obtained are provided below. In the<br>
test procedures, 5-HT stands for 5-hydroxytryptamine, mCPP stands for meta-<br>
chlorophenylpiperazine, and DOI stands for 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-<br>
isopropylamine.<br>
5HT2c. Receptor Binding Test Procedures<br>
To evaluate high affinity for the 5HT2C receptor, a CHO (Chinese Hamster<br>
Ovary) ceil line transfected with the cDNA expressing the human 5-<br>
hydroxytryptamine2C (h5HT2C) receptor was maintained in DMEM (Dulbecco"s<br>
Modified Eagle Media) supplied with fetal calf serum, glutamine, and the markers:<br>
guaninephosphoribosyl transferase (GTP) and hypoxanthinethymidine (HT). The<br>
cells were allowed to grow to confluence in large culture dishes with intermediate<br>
changes of media and splitting. Upon reaching confluence, the cells were harvested<br>
by scraping. The harvested cells were suspended in half volume of fresh<br>
physiological phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution and centrifuged at low speed<br>
(900 x g). This operation was repeated once more. The collected cells were then<br>
homogenized with a polytron at setting #7 for 15 sec in ten volumes of 50 mM<br>
Tris.HCI, pH 7.4 and 0.5 mM EDTA. The homogenate was centrifuged at 900 x g for<br>
15 min to remove nuclear particles and other cell debris. The pellet was discarded<br>
and the supernatant fluid recentrifuged at 40,000 x g for 30 min. The resulting pettet<br>
was resuspended in a small volume of Tris.HCI buffer and the tissue protein content<br>
was determined in aliquots of 10-25 microliter (|il) volumes. Bovine Serum Albumin<br>
(BSA) was used as the standard in the protein determination by the method of<br>
(Lowry et al, J. Biol. Chem., 193: 265, 1951). The volume of the suspended cell<br>
membranes was adjusted with 50 mM Tris.HCI buffer containing: 0.1% ascorbic<br>
acid, 10 mM pargyline and 4 mM CaCI2 to give a tissue protein concentration of 1-2<br>
mg per ml of suspension. The preparation membrane suspension (many times<br>
concentrated) was aliquoted in 1 ml volumes and stored at -70 C until used in<br>
subsequent binding experiments.<br>
Binding measurements were performed in a 96 well microtiter plate format, in<br>
a total volume of 200 uJ. To each well was added: 60 u.l of incubation buffer made<br>
in 50 mM Tris.HCI buffer, pH 7.4 and containing 4 mM CaCI2; 20 µl of [1Z5I] DOI<br>
(S.A., 2200 Ci/mmoi, NEN Life Science).<br>
The dissociation constant, KD of [125i] DOI at the human serotonin 5HT2C<br>
receptor was 0.4 nM by saturation binding with increasing concentrations of [125I]<br>
DOI. The reaction was initiated by the final addition of 100.0 uJ of tissue suspension<br>
containing 50 µg of receptor protein. Nonspecific binding is measured in the<br>
presence of 1 µM unlabeled DOI added in 20.0 µl volume. Test compounds were<br>
added in 20.0 ml. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 60 min. The<br>
incubation was stopped by rapid filtration. The bound Hgand-receptor complex was<br>
filtered off on a 96 well unifilter with a Packard ® Filtermate 196 Harvester. The<br>
bound complex caught on the filter disk was dried in a vacuum oven heated to 60° C<br>
and the radioactivity measured by liquid scintillation with 40 µl Microscint-20<br>
scintillant in a Packard TopCount® equipped with six (6) photomultiplier detectors.<br>
Specific binding is defined as the total radioactivity bound less the amount<br>
bound in the presence of 1 µM unlabeled DOI. Binding in the presence of varying<br>
concentrations of test drugs is expressed as percent of specific binding in the<br>
absence of drug. These results are then plotted as log % bound vs log<br>
concentration of test drug. Non linear regression analysis of data points yields both<br>
the IC50 and the Ki values of test compounds with 95% confidence limits.<br>
Alternatively, a linear regression line of decline of data points is plotted, from which<br>
the IC50 value can be read off the curve and the Ki value determined by solving the<br>
following equation:<br>
where L is the concentration of the radioactive ligand used and the KD is the<br>
dissociation constant of the ligand for the receptor, both expressed in nM.<br>
The following Kj"s (95% confidence interval) are provided for various<br>
reference compounds:<br>
Calcium Mobilization in Response to 5-HT2c .Receptor Agonists<br>
CHO cells stably expressing the human 5-HT2C receptor were cultured in<br>
Dulbecco"s modified Eagle"s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine<br>
serum and non-essential amino acids. Cells were plated at a density of 40K<br>
celts/well in 96-well clear-bottom black-wall plates 24 hr prior to the evaluation of 5-<br>
HT2C receptor stimulated calcium mobilization. For calcium studies cells were loaded<br>
with the calcium indicator dye Fluo-3-AM in Hank"s buffered saline (HBS) for 60<br>
minutes at 37°C. Cells were washed with HBS at room temperature and transferred<br>
to the fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPR, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA)<br>
for acquisition of calcium images. Excitation at 488 nm was achieved with an Argon<br>
ion laser and a 510-560 nm emission filter was used. Fluorescence "images and<br>
relative intensities were captured at 1 second intervals and cells were stimulated by<br>
addition of agonist after 10 baseline measurements using the internal fluidics module<br>
of the FLIPR. An increase in fluorescence counts corresponds to an increase in<br>
intracellular calcium.<br>
For the evaluation of agonist pharmacology the calcium changes in response<br>
to different concentrations of agonist were determined using a maximum minus<br>
minimum calculation of the raw fluorescence count data. Calcium changes were then<br>
expressed as a percentage of the response observed with a maximally effective<br>
concentration of 5-HT and EC50 values were estimated by non-linear regression<br>
analysis of the log-concentration % maximum 5-HT response curves using the 4-<br>
parameter logistic function.<br>
The following EC50"s and IC50"s are provided for various reference compounds:<br>
The results of tha standard experimental test procedures described in the<br>
preceding paragraphs were as follows:<br>
The compounds of this invention thus have affinity for and agonist or partial<br>
agonist activity at brain serotonin receptors. They are therefore of interest for the<br>

combinations of these mental disorders that may be present in a mammal. For<br>
example, mood disorders or episodes, such as depressive disorders or episodes<br>
often accompany psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia. A more complete<br>
description of the aforementioned mental disorders can be found in the Diagnostic<br>
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, Washington, DC, American<br>
Psychiatric Association (1994).<br>
The compounds of the present invention are also of interest for the treatment<br>
of epilepsy; migraines; sexual dysfunction; sleep disorders; gastrointestinal<br>
disorders, such as malfunction of gastrointestinal motility; and obesity, with its<br>
consequent comorbidities including Type H diabetes, cardiovascular disease,<br>
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, stroke, osteoarthritis, sleep apnea, gall bladder<br>
disease, gout, some cancers, some infertility, and early mortality. The compounds<br>
of the present invention can also be used to treat central nervous system<br>
deficiencies associated, for example, with trauma, stroke, spinal cord injuries. The<br>
compounds of the present invention can therefore be used to improve or inhibit<br>
further degradation of central nervous system activity during or following the malady<br>
or trauma in question. Included in these improvements are maintenance or<br>
improvement in motor and motility skills, control, coordination and strength.<br>
Thus the present invention provides methods of treating each of the maladies<br>
listed above in a mammal, preferably in a human, the methods comprising providing<br>
a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of this invention to the mammal <br><br>
need thereof. By "treating", as used herein, it is meant partially or completely<br>
alleviating, inhibiting, preventing, ameliorating and/or relieving the disorder. For<br>
example, "treating" as used herein includes partially or completely alleviating,<br>
inhibiting or relieving the condition in question. "Mammals" as used herein refers to<br>
warm blooded vertebrate animals, such as humans. "Provide", as used herein,<br>
means either directly administering a compound or composition of the present<br>
invention, or administering a prodrug derivative or analog which will form an<br>
equivalent amount of the active compound or substance within the body.<br>
Also encompassed by the present invention are pharmaceutical compositions<br>
for treating or controlling disease states or conditions of the central nervous system<br>
comprising at least one compound of Formula I, mixtures thereof, and or<br>
pharmaceutical salts thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefore.<br>
Such compositions are prepared in accordance with acceptable pharmaceutical<br>
procedures, such as described in Remingtons Pharmaceutical Sciences, 17th<br>
edition, ed. Alfonoso R. Gennaro, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, PA (1985).<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are those that are compatible with the other<br>
ingredients in the formulation and biologically acceptable.<br>
The compounds of this invention may be administered orally or parenterally,<br>
neat or in combination with conventional pharmaceutical carriers, the proportion of<br>
which is determined by the solubility and chemical nature of the compound, chosen<br>
route of administration and standard pharmacological practice. The pharmaceutical<br>
carrier may be solid or liquid.<br>
Applicable solid carriers can include one or more substances which may also<br>
act as flavoring agents, lubricants, solubilizers, suspending agents, fillers, glidants,"<br>
compression aids, binders or tablet-disintegrating agents or an encapsulating<br>
material. In powders, the carrier is a finely divided solid which is in admixture with<br>
the finely divided active ingredient. In tablets, the active ingredient is mixed with a<br>
carrier having the necessary compression properties in suitable proportions and<br>
compacted in the shape and size desired. The powders and tablets preferably<br>
contain up to 99% of the active ingredient. Suitable solid carriers include, for<br>
example, calcium phosphate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugars, lactose, dextrin,<br>
starch, gelatin, cellulose, methyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose,<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidine, low melting waxes and ion exchange resins.<br>
Liquid carriers may be used in preparing solutions, suspensions, emulsions,<br>
syrups and elixirs. The active ingredient of this invention can be dissolved or<br>
suspended in a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid carrier such as water, an organic<br>
solvent, a mixture of both or pharmaceutically acceptable oils or fat. The liquid<br>
carrier can contain other suitable pharmaceutical additives such as solubilizers,<br>
emulsifiers, buffers, preservatives, sweeteners, flavoring agents, suspending agents,<br>
thickening agents, colors, viscosity regulators, stabilizers or osmo-regulators.<br>
Suitable examples of liquid carriers for oral and parenteral administration include<br>
water (particularly containing additives as above, e.g. cellulose derivatives,<br>
preferably sodium carboxymethyl cellulose solution), alcohols (including monohydric<br>
alcohols and polyhydric alcohols e.g. glycols) and their derivatives, and oils (e.g.<br>
fractionated coconut oil and arachis oil). For parenteral administration the carrier<br>
can also be an oily ester such as ethyl oleate and isopropyl myristate. Sterile liquid<br>
carriers are used in sterile liquid form compositions for parenteral administration.<br>
The liquid carrier for pressurized compositions can be halogenated hydrocarbon or<br>
other pharmaceutically acceptable propellant.<br>
Liquid pharmaceutical compositions which are sterile solutions or<br>
suspensions can be administered by, for example, intramuscular, intraperitoneal or<br>
subcutaneous injection. Sterile solutions can also be administered intravenously.<br>
Oral administration may be either liquid or solid composition form.<br>
The compounds of this invention may be administered rectally or vaginally in<br>
the form of a conventional suppository. For administration by intranasal or<br>
intrabronchial inhalation or insufflation, the compounds of this invention may be<br>
formulated into an aqueous or partially aqueous solution, which can then be utilized<br>
in the form of an aerosol. The compounds of this invention may also be<br>
administered transdermally through the use of a transderma! patch containing the<br>
active compound and a carrier that is inert to the active compound, is non toxic to<br>
the skin, and allows delivery of the agent for systemic absorption into the blood<br>
stream via the skin. The carrier may take any number of forms such as creams and<br>
ointments, pastes, gels, and occlusive devices. The creams and ointments may be<br>
viscous liquid or semisolid emulsions of either the oil-in-water or water-in-otl type.<br>
Pastes comprised of absorptive powders dispersed in petroleum or hydrophilic<br>
petroleum containing the active ingredient may also be suitable. A variety of<br>
occlusive devices may be used to release the active ingredient into the blood stream<br>
such as a semipermeable membrane covering a reservoir containing the active<br>
ingredient with or without a carrier, or a matrix containing the active ingredient.<br>
Other occlusive devices are known in the literature.<br>
Preferably the pharmaceutical composition is in unit dosage form, e.g. as<br>
tablets, capsules, powders, solutions, suspensions, emulsions, granules, or<br>
suppositories. In such form, the composition is sub-divided in unit dose<br>
containing appropriate quantities of the active ingredient; the unit dosage forms<br>
can be packaged compositions, for example packeted powders, vials, ampoules,<br>
prefilled syringes or sachets containing liquids. The unit dosage form can be, for<br>
example, a capsule or tablet itself, or it can be the appropriate number of any<br>
such compositions in package form.<br>
The dosage requirements vary with the particular compositions employed,<br>
the route of administration, the severity of the symptoms presented and the<br>
particular subject being treated. Based on the results obtained in the standard<br>
pharmacological test procedures, projected daily dosages of active compound<br>
would be 0.02 µg/kg - 750 µg/kg. Treatment will generally be initiated with small<br>
dosages less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter the dosage is<br>
increased until the optimum effect under the circumstances is reached; precise<br>
dosages for oral, parenteral, nasal, or intrabronchial administration will be<br>
determined by the administering physician based on experience with the<br>
individual subject treated.<br>
The present invention includes prodrugs of compounds of Formula I.<br>
Prodrug, as used herein, means a compound which is convertible in vivo by<br>
metabolic means (e.g. by hydrolysis) to a compound of Formula I. Various forms<br>
of prodrugs are known in the art, for example, as discussed in Bundgaard, (ed.),<br>

This comDound was isolated as the hvdrochloride salt.<br>
2,3,4,5-Tetrahydro-1H benzo[e][1,4]diazepine (5g, 33.7mmol) was dissolved in<br>
THF (168.5mL and cooled to 0 °C with an ice bath. Hunig"s base (8.81 mL,<br>
50.6mmol) and benzyl chloroformate (5.30mL, 37.1 mmol) was added dropwise with<br>
stirring. After 7 hours stirring, THF was removed, and water and ethyl ether were<br>
added to the flask. The reaction mixture was extracted with diethyl ether (4x), and<br>
the combined organic extracts were washed with aqueous sodium bicarbonate (1x)<br>
and brine (1x). The organic extracts were then dried with magnesium suifate, filtered<br>
and concentrated to give a yellow oil. Further purification (25:75 ethyl acetate/<br>
hexane, then 30:70 ethyl acetate/ hexane) yielded 7.9g of desired product (83%).<br>
Intermediate 1 (5g, 17.7mmol) was dissolved in methylene chloride (90mL).<br>
Dimethoxymethane (4.7mL, 53.1 mmol) and cyclohexene (3.6mL, 35.4mmol) were<br>
added at room temperature. The reaction flask was then cooled to 0°C. Boron<br>
trifluoride diethyl etherate (2.5mL, 19.5mmol) was added drop wise over 5 minutes.<br>
The reaction was warmed to room temperature gradually overnight. After 20 hours,<br>
the reaction was heated to 40° C. At 36 hours, another portion of boron trifluoride<br>
diethyl etherate, dimethoxymethane and cyclohexene (9.74mmol, 20.6mmol and<br>
17.7mmol respectively) were added. After a total of 62 hours, the reaction was<br>
cooled to room temperature. 1N NaOH was added to the flask and stirred for 30<br>
minutes. The pH was checked to make sure it was basic, then the contents of the<br>
flask were transferred to a separatory funnel and extracted with methylene chloride<br>
(3x). The combined extracts were washed with brine (1x), dried with magnesium<br>
suifate, filtered and concentrated to give a golden oil. Further purification (10% ethyl<br>
The compound from Example 5 (0.200g, 0.53mmol) was dissolved in<br>
methylene chloride (0.5mL). Trifluoromethane sulfonic acid (0.0.329mL, 3.72mmol)<br>
and anisole (0.115mL, 1.06mmoi) were added at 0°C. After 2 hours, another portion<br>
of trifluoromethane sulfonic acid (2 eq.) was added. After a total of 4 hours, the<br>
reaction was completed. 1N NaOH was added to quench the reaction (pH=9-10).<br>
The contents of the flask were transferred to a separatory funnel with methylene<br>
chloride and water, and extracted with methylene chloride (3x). The combined<br>
organic extracts were dried with magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated to give<br>
a brown oil, crude desired product. Further purification (10% ammonia in 2M<br>
solution of methanol/ethyl acetate) yielded 0.067g of desired product (52%). The<br>
free amine product (0.0605g, 0.249mmol) was then dissolved in diethyl ether, and a<br>
2M solution of hydrogen chloride (0.137mL, 0.274mmol) was added. After 40<br>
minutes, the yellow precipitate was filtered off to give the desired product.<br>
To a round bottom flask was added dimethoxymethane (0.700mL,<br>
7.89mmol), which then was cooled to 0°C. Boron trifluoride diethyl etherate<br>
(0.366mL, 2.89mrnol) was then added and stirred for 30 minutes. A solution of<br>
benzodiazpene (0.5g, 2.63mmol) and methylene chloride (26.2mL) was added over<br>
ten minutes. When the addition was complete, cycloheptene (0.613mL, 5.25mmol)<br>
was added. After 20 hours, more boron trifluoride diethyi etherate and<br>
dimethoxymethane (0.33mL and 0.232mL respectively) was added. After a total of<br>
about 60 hours, 1N NaOH was added and allowed to stir for 15 minutes. After<br>
