FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an arrangement of plurality of tuyeres at the<br>
bottom of top-and-bottom-blown converter vessel used for steelmaking in steel<br>
works. More particularly, the present invention relates to a device for introducing<br>
stirring gas into a top-and-bottom blown converter to achieve a desired mixing<br>
during the process of steel making.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A top-and-bottom blown converter vessel (henceforth referred as vessel) is used<br>
for steelmaking. A reactive gas is injected into the molten metal bath (henceforth<br>
referred as bath) through a top lance to refine the metal into steel. An inert gas,<br>
for example, nitrogen or argon in blown into the bath to agitate the bath from a<br>
plurality of tuyeres arranged at the vessel bottom. The injected gas thus provides<br>
mixing in the bath to bring about homogenization of temperature and<br>
concentration. A good and fast mixing dictates the refining efficiency of the<br>
process. It has been known through several studies that the arrangement of<br>
bottom tuyeres affects mixing in the bath.<br><br>
3<br>
According to prior art, a number of tuyeres are generally placed on a circle<br>
perimeter placed equidistantly from adjacent tuyeres. More number of tuyers is<br>
required for good mixing as the capacity of the vessel increases. Placing more<br>
number of tuyeres on a circle reduces the distance between two adjacent<br>
tuyeres, in turn; increase the possibility of undesired plume interaction. Placing<br>
the tuyeres on a single circle, ignores the rest of the area available thus result in<br>
poorer mixing.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to propose a device for introducing<br>
stirring gas into a top-and-bottom blown converter to achieve a during the<br>
process of steel making.<br>
Another object of the invention is to propose a device for introducing stirring gas<br>
into a top-and-bottom converter, which achieves improved and faster mixing in a<br>
process of steekmaking.<br>
A still another object of the invention is to propose a device for introducing<br>
stirring gas into a top-and-bottom converter, which is capable of achieving<br>
optimum distribution of energy in the converter.<br><br>
4<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention proposes a device for introducing stirring gas<br>
into a top-and-bottom blown converter to achieve a desired mixing during the<br>
process of steel making.<br>
In the present arrangement, bottom tuyeres are placed on two imaginary circles<br>
concentric with the vessel bottom. Four tuyeres are placed on one circle and<br>
another four tuyeres on other circle in a manner such that the angles between<br>
the adjacent lines joining each tuyeres to a center of the vessel bottom are<br>
equal. Such an arrangement of tuyeres ensures good distribution of energy<br>
within the bath that consequently gives better mixing. An equal or unequal<br>
amount of the stirring gas flows through the each tuyere.<br>
The stirring gas can be an inert gas, such as nitrogen or argon, or an argon<br>
mixture, i.e. argon containing a little oxygen and containing no other gas except<br>
as traces.<br>
According to a particular characteristic of the invention, the angle between the<br>
adjacent lines joining each tuyere to the center of the vessel bottom may change<br>
alternately like 60°-30° or 65°-25° so that the cumulative angle is 90°. Such an<br>
arrangement of tuyers brings asymmetry into the stirring system and thus adds<br>
towards the better mixing.<br><br>
5<br>
According to another characteristic of the invention, the flow rate of stirring gas<br>
through the tuyeres placed on two circles is different. Hence a differential flow<br>
pattern is followed i.e. the tuyeres on one circle have different stirring gas flow<br>
rate as compared to the tuyeres on the other circle. The examples of a ratio of<br>
flow through tuyeres placed on one circle to the tuyeres placed on the other<br>
circle can be 2:3 or 3:7.<br>
The inventive concept is to distribute the tuyeres on multiple circles; here two<br>
conconcentric circles has been proposed. As the capacity of the vessel increases,<br>
the diameter is also expected to increase, consequently the vessel bottom area<br>
available also increases, and as a result more area is available at the vessel<br>
bottom.<br>
Accordingly, a device has been proposed which provide improved and faster<br>
mixing than that of the conventional arrangement of plurality of tuyeres placed<br>
on a single circle concentric with the vessel bottom.<br>
The concept behind proposing such a configuration is to cover more bath area<br>
for energy input i.e. a better distribution of energy into the bath. The diameter of<br>
each of the two circles can have any value less than that of the vessel bottom.<br>
Taking as an example here, an arrangement can be made with two circles having<br>
diameter of 50% and 60% of vessel bottom diameter.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF<br>
THE INVENTION<br>
As shown in Fig 1, the angle between the adjacent lines is equal. Plurality of<br>
tuyeres are placed on vessel bottom (1). Here eight tuyeres (T1, T2) are shown<br>
distributed on two circles (2,3). The angle (A1) between adjacent lines (AL1)<br>
each tuyere (T1, T2) to the center (4) of the vessel (v) is equal, each 45°.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, the angle between the adjacent lines (AL2) changes<br>
alternatively. Plurality of tuyeres (T1, T2) are placed on vessel bottom (1). Here<br>
eight tuyeres are shown distributed on two circles (2, 3). The angle (A2)<br>
between the adjacent lines (AL2) joining each tuyere (T1, T2) and the center (4)<br>
of the vessel (V) is changing alternately to a° and 90-a°, where a° is less<br>
than 90°.<br><br>
8<br>
In the present invention, eight tuyers are placed over two concentric circles (2,3)<br>
having same center (4) as that of the vessel bottom (1). The details of the<br>
bottom arrangement are shown in Figs. 1 &amp; 2. Basically 8 tuyeres (T1,T2 )are<br>
rearranged on two imaginary circles for example, circle (2) and circle (3) having<br>
different diameters, with four tuyeres (T1 or T2) placed on each. Four tuyeres<br>
(T1) are placed on the circle (2) in a manner such that the distance between any<br>
two adjacent tuyeres (T1) is equal. Similarly four other tuyers (T2) are placed on<br>
another circle (3). If imaginary lines can be joined from each tuyere (T1, T2) to<br>
the vessel bottom center (4), the angle (A1 or A2) between adjacent lines (AL1 or<br>
AL2) can be equal or change alternately between two angles (A1 or A2) summing<br>
to 90°.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, the tuyeres are placed on two circle (2,3) having diameter of<br>
50% and 66% of diameter of the vessel bottom (1). An equal flow is injected<br>
through each tuyere (T1, T2). The flow rate shown in the graph is the total flow<br>
rate injected through all the tuyeres (T1, T2). Mixing time for the each specified<br>
bottom flow rate is shown. (which Figure is being discussed.)<br>
An equal flow is injected through each tuyere (T1, T2). The flow rate shown in<br>
the graph is the total flow rate injected through all the tuyere (T1,/ T2). Mixing<br>
time for the each specified bottom flow rate is shown, (which Figure is being<br>
discussed.)<br><br>
9<br>
As further shown in Fig - 2, the tuyeres are placed on two circles (2,3) having<br>
diameter of 50% and 58% of diameter of the vessel bottom (1). Two different<br>
bottom gas flow rate is injected from the tuyeres (T1, T2) placed on the two<br>
circles (2,3). One bottom gas flow rate is injected through the tuyeres (T1)<br>
placed on one circle (2) and another bottom gas flow rate through the tuyeres<br>
(T2) placed on another circle (3). Ratio of the gas flow rate in circle (2) to circle<br>
(3) is 3:7. The flow rate shown in the graph is the total flow rate injected<br>
through all the tuyeres. Mixing time for the each specified bottom flow rate is<br>
shown. . (which Figure is being discussed.)<br>
The dimension of the tuyeres can be suitably designed as per the flow rate<br>
required through tuyeres depending upon the converter capacity.<br>
The stirring gas delivery into the bath can of two type. The flow rate through<br>
each tuyere can be equal or unequal.<br>
To enable the invention to be fully understood, the bottom tuyere configuration<br>
and there use will be described herein after by way of non-limiting examples.<br>
Water modeling of the mixing in the actual converter is presented here as an<br>
example to described the invention.<br><br>
10<br>
Simulation of mixing in actual converter can be done in a 1/6th scaled-down<br>
water model. Mixing in the vessel depends upon the fluid flow. To bring similarly<br>
in the fluid flow the dynamic and kinematic forces can be scaled down properly.<br>
The model is equipped with top and bottom blowing arrangements as in case of<br>
actual converter. The model has bottom of size of 724 millimeters diameter. The<br>
two circles are placed at 50% and 66% of the bottom diameter i.e. have<br>
diameter of 362 millimeters and 478 millimeters respectively. The eight tuyere of<br>
size of 1 millimeter are paced on the two circles as shown in Fig. 1. Water is<br>
filled upto the level generally used in the steel converter. Gas is blown onto the<br>
bath at an appropriately scaled-down flow rate from top lance as in the actual<br>
converter. From bottom of the vessel through tuyeres gas is blown into the bath<br>
at an appropriately scaled-down flow rate. From bottom a range of stirring gas<br>
flow rate is used like 20, 30, and 50 liters/minute. Mixing time is evaluated by a<br>
reliable method for each set of experiments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of<br>
the present invention, the total flow rate is distributed equally through all the<br>
tuyeres. Fig. 3 compares the mixing time of the present invention with the earlier<br>
used bottom tuyeres configuration of using one circle at 58% of bottom vessel.<br>
As per another characteristic where tuyeres are separated by alternate angles of<br>
65° and 25° on two circles. Here again equal flow is distributed among all the<br>
tuyeres. Fig. 4 compares the mixing time of the present configuration with the<br>
one that uses bottom tuyeres placed on one circle of diameter of 58% of bottom<br>
vessel.<br><br>
11<br>
A differential flow is applied on the two circles. Here total flow was divided into<br>
ratio 3:7. Here more flow i.e. 7x was kept at outer circle while lesser flow of 3x<br>
was kept at inner circle. Though it can be otherwise also i.e. 7x on inner circle<br>
and 3x on outer circle. 7x floe rate was distributed equally among all the tuyeres<br>
placed on the inner circle. Fig. 5 compares the mixing time of the present<br>
configuration with the one that uses bottom tuyeres placed on one placed on<br>
one circle of diameter of 58% of bottom vessel.<br>
It will be understood that the type of bottom blowing through the device in<br>
accordance with present invention has many advantages, some of which it<br>
shares with other type of arrangement presently used in the steel works, and<br>
others which are special to the present invention.<br>
1.	The arrangement of bottom tuyeres in accordance with present invention<br>
ensures greater volume of molten metal is affected by stirring through<br>
bottom gas ensuring efficient mixing in the bath.<br>
2.	Interaction of the adjacent plumes is reduced in comparison with if<br>
tuyeres are placed on single circle. Consequently, the tuyere wear is also<br>
expected to come down.<br>
3.	Another advantage of this invention is an improvement in the life of the<br>
bottom tuyeres wherein the two different flow rates are used through the<br>
two circles. If a total flow rate of 10Nm3/min is to be introduced through<br>
tuyeres, it is divided in a ratio of 3:7 with one part introduced through the<br><br>
12<br>
tuyeres placed on one circle and other part through the tuyeres placed on<br>
other circle. Then the flow through circle (2) will be 3 Nm3/min and<br>
through circle (3) will be 7 Nm3/min or vice-versa.<br>
4. Another advantage of the invention is saving in amount of the blowing<br>
gas. Lesser amount of the blowing gas will be required for the same<br>
degree of mixing efficiency as in case of all the tuyeres placed on a single<br>
circle than that of the tuyeres arrangement as per the present invention.<br><br>
