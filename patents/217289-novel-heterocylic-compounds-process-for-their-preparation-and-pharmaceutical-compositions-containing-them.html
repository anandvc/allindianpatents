This invention also relates to novel intermediates, processes for preparing the intermediates and processes for using the intermediates.<br><br>
This invention also relates to novel intermediates, processes for preparing the fntemiodlatas and processes for using intermediates.<br>
The azolidinediones of the general formulae (I) and (!") defined above of the present invention are useiul for the treatment and / or prophylaxis of hyperlipidemia. hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia, osteoporosis, obesity, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance and also diseases or conditions in which insulin resistance is the underlying pathophysiological mechanism. Examples of these diseases and conditions are type 11 diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance, dyslipidaemia, hypertension, coronary heart disease and other cardiovascular disorders including atherosclerosis. The azolidinediones of the formulae (I) and (!") are useful for the treatment of insulin resistance associated with obesity and psoriasis. The azolidinediones of the formulae (I) and (I") can also be used to treat diabetic complications and can be used for treatment and / or prophylaxis of other diseases and conditions such as polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), certain renal diseases including diabetic nephropathy, glomerulonephritis, glomerular sclerosis, nephrotic syndrome, hypertensive nephrosclerosis, end-stage renal diseases and microalbuminuria as well as certain eating disorders, as aldose reductase inhibitors and for improving cognitive functions in dementia.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Insulin resistance Is the diminished ability of insulin to exert its biological action across a broad range of concentrations. In insulin resistance, the body secretes abnormally high amounts of insulin to compensate for this defect; failing which, the plasma glucose concentration inevitably rises and develops into diabetes. Among the developed countries, diabetes mellitus is a common problem and is associated with a variety of abnormalities including obesity, hypertension, hyperiipidemia (J. Clin. Invest., (1985) 75 : 809 - 817; N. Engl. J. Med. (1987) 317: 350-357; J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab., (1988) 66 : 580-583; J. Clin. Invest, (1975) 68 : 957 - 969) and other renal complications (See Patent Application No. WO 95/21608). It is now increasingly being recognized that insulin resistance and relative hyperinsulincmia have a contributory role in obesity, hypertension, atherosclerosis and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The association of insulin resistance with obesity, hypertension and angina has b(xn described as a syndrome having insulin resistance as the central pathogenic link-Syndrome-X. In addition, polycystic  ovarian  syndrome  (Patent  Application  No.   WO  95/07697),  psoriasis  (Patent<br><br>
Apphcation No. WO 95/351 OS), dementia (Behavioral Brain Research (1996) 75 : 1 - I I) etc. may also have insulin resistance as a central pathogenic feature. Recently, it has also been rqwrted that insulin sensitizers improve the bone mineral density and thus may be useful for the treatment of osteoporosis (EP-783888).<br>
A number of molecular defects have been associated with insulin resistance. These include reduced expression of insulin receptors on the ptasma membrane of insulin responsive cells and alterations in the signal transduction pathways that become activ&amp;ted after insulin binds to its receptor including glucose transport and glycogen synthesis.<br>
Since defective insulin action is thought to be more important than failure of insulin secretion in the development of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and other related complications, this raises doubts about the intrinsic suitability of antidiabetic treatment that is based entirely upon stimulation of insulin release. Recently, Takeda his developed a new class of compounds which are the derivatives of 5-(4-alkoxybenzyl)-2,4-thiazolidinediones of the formula (II) (Ref Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1982, 30, 3580-3600). In the formula (II), V represents subsdluted or unsubstituted divalent aromatic group B represents a sulfur atom or an oxygen atom and U represents various groups which have been r^Jorted in various patent documents.<br>

Mutation in colonies of laboratory animals and different sensitivities to dietary regimens have made the development of animal models with non-insultn dependent diabetes associated with obesity and insulin resistance possible.   Genetic models such as db/db and ob/ob (See Diabetes, (1982) 31(1) :  1- 6) in mice and fa/fa and zucker rats have been developed by the various laboratories for understanding the pathophysiology of disease and testing the eflicacy of new antidiabetic compounds (Diabetes. (1983) 32: 830-838 ; Annu. Rep. Sankyo Res. Lab. (1994)   46 : 1-57).  The homozygous animals, C57 BL/KsJ-db/db mice developed by Jackson Laboratory, US, are obese, hyperglycemic, hypcrinsulinemic and insulin resistant (J. Clin. Invest., (1990) 85 ; 962-967), whereas heterozygous are lean and normoglycemic.   In db/db model, mouse progressively develops insulinopenia with age, a feature commonly observed in late stages of human type II diabetes when blood sugar levels are insufficiently controlled. The state of pancreas and its course vary according to the models.   Since this model resembles that of type II diabetes mellitus, the compounds of the present invention were tested for blood sugar and triglycerides lowering acttvrties.<br>
The compounds of the present Invention showed blood sugar and triglycerides lowering activities through-improved insulin resistance. This was demonstrated by the following in vivo experiments.<br>
Male C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice of 8 to 14 weeks age, having body weight range of 35 to 60 grams, procured from the Jackson Laboraotory, USA, were used in the experiment. The mice were provided with standard feed (National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, India) and acidified water, ad libitum. The anirnals having more than 3(X) mg / dl blood sugar were used for testing. The number of animals in each ^x&gt;up was 4.<br>
The random blood sugar and triglyceride levels were measured by collecting blood (100 (il) through orbital sinus, using heparinised capillary in tubes containing EDTA which was centrifiiged to obtain plasma. The plasma glucose and triglycerides levels were measured spectrometrically, by<br>
glucose oxidase and gJycerD(-3-P04 oxidase/peroxidase enzyme (Dr. Reddy"s Lab. Diagnostic Division Kits, Hyderabad, India) methods respectively. On 6th day the blood samples were collected one hour after administration of test compounds / vehicle for assessing the biological activity.<br><br>
Test compounds were suspended on 0.25 % carboxymelhyl cellulose and administered to (est group at a dose of 1 mg to 100 mg / kg through oral gavage daily for 6 days. The control group received vehicle (dose 10 ml / kg). Troglttazone (100 mg / kg, daily dose) was used as a standard drug which showed 28 % reduction in random blood sugar level on 6(h day.<br>
The blood sugar and triglycerides lowering activities of the test compound was calculated according to the formula :<br>
Bloodsugar Mriglycerideslowering activity (%) = 1 - DT/DC   x 100<br>
TCVZC<br>
ZC = Zero day control group value<br>
DC = Zero day treated group value<br>
TC = Control group value on test day<br>
DT = Treated group value on the test day<br>
No adverse effects were observed for any of the mentioned compounds of invention in the above test.<br>
The compounds of the present invention also showed cholesterol lowering activity in the expoimental animali used.<br><br>

The experimental results from the db/db mice suggest that the novel compounds of the present invention also possess therapeutic utility as a prophylactic or regular treatment for obesity, cardiovascular disordere such as hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and other diseases; as it is known irom the literature that such diseases are interrelated to each other.<br><br><br>
