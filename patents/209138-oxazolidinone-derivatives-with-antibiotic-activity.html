COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10, Rule 13]<br>
"OXAZOLIDINONE DERIVATIVES WITH ANTIBIOTIC ACTIVITY"<br>
ASTRAZENECA AB, a Swedish company of S-151 85 Sodertalje, Sweden,<br><br><br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br><br><br>
The present invention relates to antibiotic compounds and in particular to antibiotic compounds containing a substituted oxazolidmone ring. This invention further relates to processes for their preparation, to intermediates useful in their preparation, to their use as therapeutic agents and to pharmaceutical compositions containing them.<br>
The international microbiological community continues to express serious concern that the evolution of antibiotic resistance could result in strains against which currently available antibacterial agents will be ineffective. In general, bacterial pathogens may be classified as either Gram-positive or Gram-negative pathogens. Antibiotic compounds with effective activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens are generally regarded as having a broad spectrum of activity. The compounds of the present invention are regarded primarily as effective against Gram-positive pathogens because of their particularly good activity against such pathogens, but are also regarded as effective against certain Gram-negative pathogens.<br>
Gram-positive pathogens, for example Staphylococci, Enterococci, Streptococci and mycobacteria, are particularly important because of the development of resistant strains which are both difficult to treat and difficult to eradicate from the hospital environment once established. Examples of such strains are methicillin resistant staphylococcus (MRS A), methicillin resistant coagulase negative staphylococci (MRCNS), penicillin resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and multiply resistant Enterococcus faecium.<br>
The major clinically effective antibiotic for treatment of such resistant Gram-positive pathogens is vancomycin. Vancomycin is a glycopeptide and is associated with nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. Furthermore, and most importantly, antibacterial resistance to vancomycin and other glycopeptides is also appearing. This resistance is increasing at a steady rate rendering these agents less and less effective in the treatment of Gram-positive pathogens. There is also now increasing resistance appearing towards agents such as p -lactams, quinolones and macrolides used for the treatment of certain Gram negative strains responsible for upper respiratory tract infections. These strains include H.influenzae and M.catarrhalis.<br>
Certain antibacterial compounds containing an oxazolidinone ring have been described<br><br>
in the art (for example, Walter A. Gregory et al in J.Med.Chem. 1990, 33,2569-2578 and 1989, 32(8), 1673-81; Chung-Ho Park et al in J.Med.Chem. 1992, 35, 1156-1165). Such antibacterial oxazolidinone compounds with a 5-methylacetamide sidechain may be subject to mammalian peptidase metabolism. Furthermore, bacterial resistance to known antibacterial agents may develop, for example, by (i) the evolution of active binding sites in the bacteria rendering a previously active pharmacophore less effective or redundant, and/or (ii) the evolution of means to chemically deactivate a given pharmacophore. Therefore, there remains an ongoing need to find new antibacterial agents with a favourable pharmacological profile, in particular for compounds containing new pharmacophores.<br>
We have discovered a class of antibiotic compounds containing a new class of substituted oxazolidinone ring which has useful activity against Gram-positive pathogens including MRSA and MR.CNS and, in particular, against various strains exhibiting resistance to vancomycin and against E. faecium strains resistant to both aminoglycosides and clinically used pMactams, but also to fastidious Gram negative strains such as H.influenzae and Mxatarrhalis.<br>

charged functions and the valency of the cations or anions. A preferred pharmaceutically-acceptable salt is the sodium salt.<br>
However, to facilitate isolation of the salt during preparation, salts which are less soluble in the chosen solvent may be preferred whether pharmaceutically-acceptable or not.<br>
The compounds of the formula (I) may be administered in title form of a pro-drug which is broken down in the human or animal body to give a compound of the formula (I). A prodrug may be used to alter or improve the physical and/or pharmacokinetic profile of the parent compound and can be formed when the parent compound contains a suitable group or substituent which can be derivatised to form a prodrug. Examples of pro-drugs include in-vivo hydrolysable esters of a compound of the formula (J) or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof.<br>
Various forms of prodrugs are known in the art, for examples see:<br>

An in-vivo hydrolysable ester of a compound of the formula (I) or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof containing carboxy or hydroxy group is, for example, a pharmaceutically-acceptable ester which is hydrolysed in the human or animal body to produce the parent acid or alcohol. Suitable pharmaceutically-acceptable esters for carboxy include (l-6C)alkoxymethyl esters for example methoxymethyl, (l-6C)allcanoyloxymethyl esters for example pivaloyloxymethyl, phthalidyl esters, (3-8C)cycloalkoxycarbonyloxy(l-6C)alkyl esters for example 1-cyclohexylcarbonyloxyethyl; l,3-dioxolan-2-onylmethyl esters for example 5-methyl-l,3-dioxolan-2-ylmethyl; and (l-6C)alkoxycarbonyloxyethyl esters for example 1-methoxycarbonyloxyethyl and may be formed at any carboxy group in the compounds of this invention.<br><br>
An in-vivo iiydrolysable ester of a compound of the formula (I) or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof containing a hydroxy group or groups includes inorganic esters such as phosphate esters (including phosphoramidic cyclic esters) and a-acyloxyalkyl ethers and related compounds which as a result of the in-vivo hydrolysis of the ester breakdown to give the parent hydroxy group/s. Examples of a-acyloxyalkyl ethers include acetoxymethoxy and 2,2-dimethylpropionyloxymethoxy. A selection of in-vivo hydrolysable ester forming groups for hydroxy include (l-10C)alkanoyl, benzoyl, phenylacetyl and substituted benzoyl and phenylacetyl, (l-lOC)alkoxycafhonyl (to give alkyl carbonate esters), di-(l-4C)alkylcarbamoyl andH-(di-(K4C)aUcylan3inoethyl)-H-(l-4C)alkylcarbamoyl (to give carbamates), di-(l-4C)alkylamin0acetyl and carboxyacetyl. Examples of ring substituents on phenylacetyl and benzoyl include chloroniethyl or aminomethyl, (l-4C)alkylaminomethyl and di-((l-4C)alkyl)aminomethyl, and morpholino or piperazino linked from a ring nitrogen atom via a methylene linking group to the 3- or 4-position of the benzoyl ring.<br>
Certain suitable in-vivo hydrolysable esters of a compound of the formula (T) are described within the definitions listed in this specification, for example esters described by the definition (Rc2d), and some groups within (Rc2c). Suitable in-vivo hydrolysable esters of a compound of the formula (T) are described as follows. For example, a 1,2-diol may be cyclised to form a cyclic ester of formula (PD1) or a pyrophosphate of formula (PD2) :<br><br>
(fcDl)	(PP2)<br>
Particularly interesting ar^ such cyclised pro-drugs when the 1,2-diol is on a (1-4C)alkyl chain linked to a carbonyl group in a substituent of formula Re borne by a nitrogen atom in (TC4). Esters of compounds of formula (T) wherein the HO- function/s in (PD1) and (F&amp;2) are protected? by (l~4C)allkyl) phenyl ar benzyl are useM intermediates for &amp;e preparation of such pro-drugs.<br>
Further in-vivo hydrolysable esters include phosphoramidic esters, and also compounds of formula (T) in which any free hydroxy group independently forms aphosphoryl<br><br>
(npd is 1) or phosphiryl (npd is 0) ester of the formula (PD3):<br><br>
Useful intermediates for the preparation of such esters include compounds containing a group/s of formula (PD3) in which either or both of the -OH groups in (PD3) is independently protected by (l-4C)alkyl (such compounds also being interesting compounds in their own right), phenyl or phenyl-(l-4C)alkyl (such phenyl groups being optionally substituted by 1 or 2 groups independently selected from (l-4C)alkyl, nitro, halo and (1-4C)alkoxy).<br>
Thus, prodrugs containing groups such as (PD1), (PD2) and (PD3) may be prepared by reaction of a compound of formula (I) containing suitable hydroxy group/s with a suitably protected phosphorylating agent (for example, containing a chloro or dialtylamino leaving group), followed by oxidation (if necessary) and deprotection.<br>
When a compound of formula (I) contains a number of free hydroxy group, those groups not being converted into a prodrug functionality may be protected (for example, using a t-butyl-dimethylsilyl group), and later deprotected. Also, enzymatic methods may be used to selectively phosphorylate or dephosphorylate alcohol functionalities.<br>
Other interesting in-vivo hydrolysable esters include, for example, those in which Re is defined by, for example, R14C(0)0(l-6C)alkyI-CO- (wherein RI4is for example, benzyloxy-(l-4C)alkyl, or phenyl). Suitable substituents on a phenyl group in such esters include, for example, 4-(l-4C)piperazino-(l-4C)alkyl, piperazino-(l-4C)alkyl and morpholino-(l-4C)alkyl.<br>
Where pharrnaceutically-acceptable salts of an in-vivo hydrolysable ester may be formed this is achieved by conventional techniques. Thus, for example, compounds containing a group of formula (PD1), (PD2) and/or (PD3) may ionise (partially or fully) to form salts with an appropriate number of counter-ions. Thus, by way of example, if an in-vivo hydrolysable ester prodrug of a compound of formula (I) contains two (PD3) groups, there are four HO-P- functionalities present in the overall molecule, each of which may form an<br><br>
appropriate salt (i.e. the overall molecule may form, for example, a mono-, di-, tri- or tetra-sodium salt).<br>
The compounds of the present invention have a chiral centre at the C-5 position of the oxazolidinone ring. The pharmaceutically active enantiomer is of the formula (IA):<br><br>
The present invention includes the pure enantiomer depicted above or mixtures of the 5R and 5S enantiomers, for example a racemic mixture. If a mixture of enantiomers is used, a larger amount (depending upon the ratio of the enantiomers) will be required to achieve the same effect as the same weight of the pharmaceutically active enantiomer. For the avoidance of doubt the enantiomer depicted above is generally the 5(R) enantiomer, although certain compounds (such as HET as pyrid-2-one) are the 5(S) enantiomer. Examples of 5(S) compounds are illustrated in the accompanying non-limiting Examples.<br>
Furthermore, some compounds of the formula (I) may have other chiral centres. It is to be understood that the invention encompasses all such optical and diastereo-isomers, and racemic mixtures, that possess antibacterial activity. It is well known in the art how to prepare optically-active forms (for example by resolution of the racemic form by recrystallisation techniques, by chiral synthesis, by enzymatic resolution, by biotransformation or by chromatographic separation) and how to determine antibacterial activity as described hereinafter.<br>
The invention relates to all tautomeric forms of the compounds of the formula (I) that possess antibacterial activity.<br>
It is also to be understood that certain compounds of the formula (I) can exist in solvated as well as unsolvated forms such as, for example, hydrated forms. It is to be understood that the invention encompasses all such solvated forms which possess antibacterial<br><br>
activity.<br>
It is also to be understood that certain compounds of the formula (I) may exhibit polymorphism, and that the invention encompasses all such forms which possess antibacterial activity.<br>
As stated before, we have discovered a range of compounds that have good activity against a broad range of Gram-positive pathogens including organisms known to be resistant to most commonly used antibiotics.

Particularly preferred salts are the sodium salts. In-vivo hydrolysable esters, or pharmaceutically-acceptable salts thereof, of Examples with hydroxy groups are also preferred, especially phosphoryl esters.<br><br>
In a further aspect the present invention provides a process for preparing a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt or an in-vivo hydrolysable ester thereof. It will be appreciated that during certain of the following processes certain substituents may require protection to prevent their undesired reaction. The skilled chemist will appreciate when such protection is required, and how such protecting groups may be put in place, and later removed.<br>
For examples of protecting groups see one of the many general texts on the subject, for example, 'Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis' by Theodora Green (publisher: John Wiley<br>
»<br>
&amp; Sons). Protecting groups may be removed by any convenient method as described in the literature or known to the skilled chemist as appropriate for the removal of the protecting group in question, such methods being chosen so as to effect removal of the protecting group with minimum disturbance of groups elsewhere in the molecule.<br>
Thus, if reactants include, for example, groups such as amino, carboxy or hydroxy it may be desirable to protect the group in some of the reactions mentioned herein.<br>
A suitable protecting group for an amino or alkylamino group is, for example, an acyl group, for example an alkanoyl group such as acetyl, an alkoxycarbonyl group, for example a methoxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl or /-butoxycarbonyl group, an aiylmethoxycarbonyl group, for example benzyloxycarbonyl, or an aroyl group, for example benzoyl. The deprotection conditions for the above protecting groups necessarily vary with the choice of protecting group. Thus, for example, an acyl group such as an alkanoyl or alkoxycarbonyl group or an aroyl group may be removed for example, by hydrolysis with a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example lithium or sodium hydroxide. Alternatively an acyl group such as a f-butoxycarbonyl group may be removed, for example, by treatment with a suitable acid as hydrochloric, sulfuric or phosphoric acid or trifluoroacetic acid and an arylmethoxycarbonyl group such as a benzyloxycarbonyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon, or by treatment with a Lewis acid for example boron tris(rrifluoroacetate). A suitable alternative protecting group for a primary amino group is, for example, a phthaloyl group which may be removed by treatment with an alkylamine, for example dimemylammopropylamine, or with hydrazine.<br><br>
A suitable protecting group for a hydroxy group is, for example, an acyl group, for example an alkanoyl group such as acetyl, an aroyl group, for example benzoyl, or an arylmethyl group, for example benzyl. The deprotection conditions for the above protecting groups will necessarily vary with the choice of protecting group. Thus, for example, an acyl group such as an alkanoyl or an aroyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrolysis with a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example Hthium or sodium hydroxide. Alternatively an arylmethyl group such as a benzyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon.<br>
A suitable protecting group for a carboxy group is, for example, an esterifying group, for example a methyl or an ethyl group which may be removed, for example, by hydrolysis with a base such as sodium hydroxide, or for example a f-butyl group which may be removed, for example, by treatment with an acid, for example an organic acid such as trifiuoroacetic acid, or for example a benzyl group which may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon.<br>
Resins may also be used as a protecting group.<br>
The protecting groups may be removed at any convenient stage in the synthesis using conventional techniques well known in the chemical art.<br>

Thus, the present invention also provides that the compounds of the formulae (!) and pharmaceutically-acceptable salts and in vivo hydrolysable esters thereof, can be prepared by a<br><br>
process (a) to (d) as follows (wherein the variables are as defined above unless otherwise<br>
stated):<br>
(wherein the variables are as defined above unless otherwise stated) :<br>
(a)	by modifying a substituent in or introducing a substituent into another compound of formula (E);<br>
(b)	by reaction of a compound of formula (IT):<br><br>
wherein Y is a displaceable group (which may be preformed, such as chloro or mesylate, or generated in-situ, for example under Mitsunobu conditions) with a compound of the formula (TO) :<br>
HET<br>
OH) wherein HET is HET-H free-base form or HET- anion formed from the free base form; or .<br>

The main synthetic routes are illustrated in the Scheme below (with Q as phenyl, and X, R and A defined with reference to analogous substituents defined elsewhere herein). The<br><br>
compounds of the invention maybe prepared by analogous chemistry adapted from this Scheme. The Scheme also shows the preparation of 1,2,3-triazoles via the azide (prepared from the relevant hydroxy compound).<br><br>
Deprotection, salt formation or in-vivo hydrolysable ester formation may each be provided as a specific final process step.<br>
The N-linked hetereocycle can of course be prepared early in the overall synthesis, and then other functional groups changed.<br><br>
Where Y is a displaceable group, suitable values for Y are for example, a halogeno or sulfonyloxy group, for example a chloro, bromo, methanesulfonyloxy or toluene-4-. sulfonyloxy group.<br>
General guidance on reaction conditions and reagents may be obtained in Advanced Organic Chemistry, 4th Edition, Jerry March (publisher : J.Wiley &amp; Sons), 1992. Necessary starting materials may be obtained by standard procedures of organic chemistry, such as described in this process section, in the Examples section or by analogous procedures within the ordinary skill of an organic chemist. Certain references are also provided which describe the preparation of certain suitable starting materials, for example International Patent Application Publication No. WO 97/37980, the contents of which are incorporated here by reference. Processes analogous to those described in the references may also be used by the ordinary organic chemist to obtain necessary starting materials.<br>
(a)      Methods for converting substituents into other substituents are known in the art. For example an alkylthio group may be oxidised to an alkylsulfinyl or alkysulfonyl group, a cyano group reduced to an amino group, a nitro group reduced to an amino group, a hydroxy group alkylated to a methoxy group, a hydroxy group thiomethylated to an arylthiomethyl or a heteroarylthiomethyl group (see, for example, TetXett., 585,1972), a carbonyl group converted to a thiocarbonyl group (eg. using Lawsson's reagent) or a bromo group converted to an alkylthio group. It is also possible to convert one Re group into another Re group as a final step in the preparation of a compound of the formula (I), for example, acylation of a group of formula (TC5) wherein Re is hydrogen.<br>
(b)( i) Reaction (b)(i) (in which Y is initially hydroxy) is performed under Mitsunobu conditions, for example, in the presence of tri-n-butylphosphine and diethyl azodicarboxylate (DEAD) in an organic solvent such as THF, and in the temperature range 0°C - 60°C, but preferably at ambient temperature. Details of Mitsunobu reactions are contained in Tet. Letts., 21,699, (1990); The Mitsunobu Reaction, D.L.Hughes, Organic Reactions, 1992, Vol.42, 335-656 and Progress in the Mitsunobu Reaction, D.L.Hughes, Organic Preparations and Procedures International, 1996, Vol.28,127-164.<br>
Compounds of the formula (H) wherein Y is hydroxy may be obtained as described in the references cited herein (particularly in the section proceeding the discussion of protecting<br><br>
groups), for example, by reacting a compound ef the formula (VI) with a compound of formula (VII):<br><br><br>
wherein R21 is (l-6C)alkyl or benzyl and R22 is (l-4C)aIkyl or -S(0)„(l-4C)alkyl where n is 0, 1 or 2. Preferably R22 is (l-4C)alkyI.<br>
In particular, compounds of the formula (IT), (VI) and (VII)  may be prepared by the skilled man, for example as described in International Patent Application Publication Nos. WO95/07271, W097/27188, WO 97/30995, WO 98/01446 and WO 98/01446, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference, and by analogous processes.<br>
If not commercially available, compounds of the formula (IE) may be prepared by procedures which are selected from standard chemical techniques, techniques which are analogous to the synthesis of known, structurally similar compounds, or techniques which are analogous to the procedures described in the Examples. For example, standard chemical techniques are as described in Houben Weyl, Methoden der Organische Chemie, E8a, Pt.I (1993), 45-225, B.J.Wakefield.<br>
(b)( ii) Reactions (b)(ii) are performed conveniently in the presence of a suitable base such as, for example, an alkali or alkaline earth metal carbonate, alkoxide or hydroxide, for example sodium carbonate or potassium carbonate, or, for example, an organic amine base such as, for example, pyridine, 2,6-lutidine, collidine, 4-dimethylarninopyridine, Memylamine, morpholine or diazabicyclo-[5.4.0]undec-7-ene, the reaction is also preferably carried out in a suitable inert solvent or diluent, for example methylene chloride, acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran,<br><br>
1,2-dimethoxyethane, N N-dmiethylfomamLde, N,N-dtrnethylacetamide, N-methylpyrrolidin-2-one or dhnethylsulfoxide at and at a temperature in the range 25-60°C.<br>
When Y is chloro, the compound of the formula (II) may be formed by reacting a compound of the formula (11) wherein Y is hydroxy (hydroxy compound) with a chlorinating agent. For example, by reacting the hydroxy compound with thionyl chloride, in a temperature range of ambient temperature to reflux, optionally in a chlorinated solvent such as dichloromethane or by reacting the hydroxy compound with carbon tetrachloride/triphenyl phosphine in dichloromethane, in a temperature range of 0°C to ambient temperature. A compound of the formula (II) wherein Y is chloro or iodo may also be prepared from a compound of the formula (II) wherein Y is mesylate or tosylate, by reacting the latter compound with lithium chloride or hthium iodide and crown ether, in a suitable organic solvent such as THF, in a temperature range of ambient temperature to reflux<br>
When Y is (l-4C)alkanesulfonyloxy or tosylate the compound (H) may be prepared by reacting the hydroxy compound with (l-4C)alkanesulfonyl chloride or tosyl chloride in the presence of a mild base such as triemylamine or pyridine.<br>
When Y is a phosphoryl ester (such as Ph02-P(0)-0-) or Pb2-P(0)-0- the compound (II) may be prepared from the hydroxy compound under standard conditions. (c)      Reaction (c) is performed under conditions analogous to those described in the following references which disclose how suitable and analogous starting materials may be obtained.<br>
Reaction (c) is especially suitable for compounds in which HET is an electron deficient heteroaryl (such as, for example, thiadiazole or triazine).<br>
Compounds of the formula Q-Z wherein Z is an isocyanate may be prepared by the skilled chemist, for example by analogous processes to those described in Walter A. Gregory et al in J. Med. Chem. 1990, 33,2569-2578 and Chung-Ho Park et al in J. Med. Chem. 1992, 35,1156-1165. Compounds of the formula Q-Z wherein Z is a urethane may be prepared by the skilled chemist, for example by analogous processes to those described in International Patent Application Publication Nos. WO 97/30995 and WO 97/37980.,<br>
A similar reaction to reaction (c) may be performed in which Q-Z wherein Z is a amine group is reacted with the epoxide (optionally in the presence of an organic base), and the product is reacted with, for example, phosgene to form the oxazolidinone ring. Such<br><br>
reactions and the preparation of starting materials in within the skill of the ordinary chemist with reference to the above-cited documents disclosing analogous reactions and preparations.<br>
Epoxides of the formula (V) may be prepared from the corresponding compound of formula (VIH):<br><br>
Certain such epoxide and alkene intennediates are novel and are provided as a further feature of the invention. Asymmetric epoxidation may be used to give the desired optical isomer.<br>
(d)      The cycloaddition reaction to form 1,2,3 triazoles from the corresponding azide is performed under conventional conditions.<br>
Compounds of the formula (II) wherein Y is azide may be obtained as described in the references cited herein (particularly in the section proceeding the discussion of protecting groups), for example from the corresponding compounds in which Y is hydroxy or mesylate. The removal of any protecting groups, the formation of apharmaceutically-acceptable salt and/or the formation of an in vivo hydrolysable ester are within the skill of an ordinary organic chemist using standard techniques. Furthermore, details on the these steps, for example the preparation of in-vivo hydrolysable ester prodrugs has been provided in the section above on such esters, and in certain of the following non-limiting Examples.<br>
When an optically active form of a compound of the formula (T) is required, it may be obtained by carrying out one of the above procedures using an optically active starting material (formed, for example, by asymmetric induction of a suitable reaction step), or by resolution of a racemic form of the compound or intermediate using a standard procedure, or by chromatographic separation of diastereoisomers (when produced). Enzymatic techniques may also be useful for the preparation of optically active compounds and/or intermediates. Similarly, when a pure regioisomer of a compound of the formula (I) is required, it may be obtained by carrying out one of the above procedures using a pure regioisomer as a starting material, or by resolution of a mixture of the regioisomers or intermediates using a. standard procedure.<br><br>
