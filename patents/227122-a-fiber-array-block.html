				<td>Inventors :-<br>
The present invention is by Sheel Aditya, Professor, and Shwetank Kumar and Puneet Gupta, students of B.Techv; all of Department ,of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (IITD), Hauz Khasr-New Delhi - 110016, India, all Indian Nationals.<br>
Field of the Invention :-<br>
The present invention relates to the mothod of manufacturing a fiber array block and products thereof, particularly this invention relates to the method of manufacturing an optical fiber array block and products thereof, more particularly this invention relates to the method of manufacturing an optical fiber array block for optical integrated circuits (OICs) and products thereof, even more particularly this invention relates to the method of manufacturing an optical fiber array block for optical integrated circuits (OICs) which in-turn are fabricated on glass or LiNbO3 substrates, and products thereof.<br>
Background of the Invention :-<br>
The optical integrated circuits, herein after referred to as OICs are circuits consisting of optical waveguides fabricated on planar substrates. The applications of OICs have expanded rapidly, particularly in the area of optical devices such as switches, splitters, wave division multiplexes etc. The OICs are primarily used in such optical deices due to their capability to integrate a number of functions and to obtain devices requiring precise component configurations. The another reason for their such a wide application is their compact size and higher reliability and durability. The practical utilisation of OICs requires a key technology known as pigtailing. Pigtailing refers to connecting standard single-mode optical fibre/fibres to the waveguide port/ports on the OIC. The formation of connection between standard single-mode optical fiber/fibers and the waveguide port/ports on the OIC requires considerable precision since the cross-section dimensions of waveguide and fibre-core are only a few microns. For the purpose of pigtailing, the fibre/fibres should themselves be incorporated in a<br>
stable assembly to permit alignment and attachment with the OIC. Such an assembly is called a Fiber Array Block, herein after referred to as FAB. The FAB is an important component for practical utilisation of OICs.<br>
The FAB for OIC application, as known in the prior art, generally comprises of V-grooved member and a non-grooved or plane member. The V-grooved member consists of one or more V-grooves, one or all such V-grooves recieve an optical fiber. The non-grooved member is fixed onto this V-grooved member with the help of adhesive layer alone or combination of adhesive and compliant layers. Such an arrangement will have optical fibre/fibres sandwitched in-between the V-grooved member and non-grooved member. Such V-grooved members are manufactured from non-grooved members by photolithography, mechanical scribing or selective deposition methods as known in the prior art.<br>
The another type of FAB for OIC application, as known in the prior art, comprises of both members as V-grooved members with fiber/fibers sandwitched in-between.<br>
Still another type of FAB for  OIC application, as known in the prior art, comprises of both members as non-grooved members with fiber/fibers sandwitched in-between.<br>
The FABs for OIC application comprising of one V-grooved member and one non-grooved or plane member with optical fiber/fibers sandwitched in-between, as known in the prior art, consists of a V-grooved member with one or more V-grooves each recieving an optical fiber and fixed onto the fixing member, herein above referred to as non-grooved or plane member. Such an arrangement of FAB is known to have two guide grooves, one on each side of the set of V-grooves. Such known arrangement of known FAB has the drawback that such guide grooves are formed only by precisely matching half guide groove of V-grooved member and half guide groove of non-grooved member. The another drawback of such known FAB having one V-grooved member and one plane member with optical fiber/fibers sandwitched in-between and one guide groove on either side is that the fixing of such FAB onto the element mount substrate calls for precise adjustment of position of optical fiber/fibers with reference to the surface of element mount substrate and hence the alignment of optical<br>
axes of the optical fibers and of optical axes of the optical element is difficult to be controlled/worked out due to complicated structure.<br>
The another type of known FAB having one V-grooved member and one plane member with optical fiber/fibers sandwitched in-between and one guide groove on either side to overcome the drawbacks of the FAB, as described in above paragraph further comprises of guide pins, which are placed inside the said guide grooves. The major drawback of such known FAB having optical fibers sandwitched inbetween one V-grooved member and one non grooved member, and one guide groove on either side of V-grooves with said guide pin resting in said guide groove is that this arrangement requires precise control of line contact of guide pin with the element mount substrate, which in-turn will call for precise control of uniform diameter of guide pins throughout their lengths and also the said diameter of both the guide pins being exactly the same. Further drawback of such an arrangement is that it also calls for precise matching of half guide groove of V-grooved member with half guide groove of non-grooved member, which has its own limitation and in-turn complicates the construction of the FAB for OIC applications. Still further drawback of such known FAB is that a gap is necessarily maintained between the fixing member, referred as plane member and the element mount member for line contact between guide pin and element mount member, which in-turn calls for precise control of thickness of edges of V-grooved member with reference to the centre part, having V-grooves, of the V-grooved member. Yet another drawback of such known FAB is that such an arrangement requires even precise control of adhesive layer towards edges of V-grooved member.<br>
Still another type of known FABihaving one V-grooved member and one plane member with optical fiber/fibers sandwitched in-between are known to have compliant layer in addition to the adhesive layer. Generally such compliant layer is formed towards the non-grooved memebr and the adhesive layer is formed towards the V-grooved member and a contact is generated between the compliant layer and adhesive layer. The limitation of such an arrangement is that the compliant layer is preferably required to be UV (ultra-violet) transparent and the contact between the compliant layer and the adhesive layer is required to<br>
be precisely controlledi further, the thickness of the compliant layer is also required to be controlled precisely.<br>
The another type of FAB for O(IC application, as known in the prior art and stated herein above, comprises of both members as V-grooved members with fiber/fibers sandwitched in-between. The major drawback of such an arrangement is that alignment of V-grooves of one member with the V-grooves of another member is very difficult, which in-turn may result in poor performance of the FAB when put to use in OIC.<br>
Still another type of FAB for OIC application, as known in the prior art and stated herein above, comprises of both non-grooved members with fiber/fibers sandwitched in-between. The major drawback of such an arrangement is that the optical fibers under such an arrangement may not remain fixed in their position as decided before the construction of the FAB and may not remain at equidistant when the fixing has been done. Further, the optical fibers may be subjected to stress and their optical axes may not remain precisely aligned, which is the main requirement of any FAB for OIC applications. Such poor alignment of optical fibers with respect to each other may result in poor performance of the FAB when put to use in OIC. In order to have aligned spacing between the optical fibers, some of such known FABs are constructed using a V-grooved member as alignment member. The limitation of use of such an alignment member is that it requires application of mold release substance onto the grooves of the alignment members. Further, such application of mold release substance may affect the alignment of optical fibers as such and hence may partly defeat the very purpose of the alignment member.<br>
Yet another drawback of some of the known FABs, as described herein above is that an additional fabrication step of precise stepping of the grooved and non-grooved members or both grooved members or both non-grooved members at an end to recieve the unstripped optical fibers is required for better mechanical strength, that is, to prevent breakage of the stripped optical fibers. The construction of such a precise stepping is difficult as the dimensions required to be controlled are of a few microns.<br>
Still further a drawback of some of the known FABs, as described herein above, is that, their method of manufacturing does not describe how to avoid the contact of surface of the optical fiber and adhesive in the V-groove region.<br>
Yet another limitation of some of the known FABs, as described herein above is that their use is limited to the plurality of unstripped optical fibers, which in-turn results in difficulty of handling each optical fibre individually. Such known FABs do not describe the use of ribboned fibres.<br>
This is yet another limitation of some of the known FABs, as described herein above, that they do not have adequate mechanical strength, as the optical fibers are sandwitched only in between the grooved members or non-grooved members or grooved and non-grooved members, as described herein above.<br>
Need of the Invention :-<br>
Therefore, there is a need to have a fiber array block and method of manufacturing thereof, particularly to have an optical fiber array block and method of manufacturing thereof, more particularly to have an optical fiber array block for optical integrated circuits (OICs) and method of manufacturing thereof, even more particularly to have an optical fiber array block for optical integrated circuits (OICs) which in-turn are fabricated on glass substrates, and method of manufacturing thereof, which can overcome the disadvantages of the prior art as described and stated herein above.<br>

Still another an object of this invention is to provide an optical fiber array block and of method of manufacturing thereof, as described herein above, which has better mechanical strength as the optical fibers are not sandwitched in between the grooved members or non-grooved members or grooved and non-grooved members only, as described herein above.<br>

This is further an object of this invention to provide an optical fiber array block and of method of manufacturing thereof, as described herein above, which does not require construction of steps in the grooved and/or non-grooved members to hold the unstripped optical fibers.<br>
This is still further an object of the present invention to provide an optical fiber array block and of method of manufacturing thereof, as described herein above, wherein the<br>
method of manufacturing thereof describes how to avoid the contact of surface of the optical fiber and adhesive in the V-groove region and hence how to achieve the optical fiber array block having better performance when put to use in OIC.<br>

Detailed Description and Preferred Embodiments of the Invention :-<br>
Accordingly, the present invention makes a complete disclosure of a fiber array block, particularly of an optical fiber array block, more particularly of an optical fiber array block for optical integrated circuits (OICs), even more particularly of an optical fiber array block for optical integrated circuits (OICs) which are fabricated on glass substrates, and of a method for manufacturing thereof, as stated herein above and described herein after, wherein the optical fiber array block comprises of an upper layer, herein after referred to as an upper plate; a<br><br>
lower layer, herein after referred to as lower plate; a middle layer sandwitched in between the upper and lower plates, a ribbon fiber enclosed in jacket, a grooved member, a non-grooved<br>
member and a set of support members, particularly the presently disclosed optical fiber array<br>
block for OIC application comprises of an upper plate, a lower plate, a middle layer<br>
sandwitched in between the upper plate and said the lower plate, and the middle layer consists of a grooved member and a non-grooved member on one end, and of a ribbon fiber, with enclosed optical fiber/fibers and supported by a bottom support member from bottom and by set of side support members from both sides, on the another end, and the grooved member, the non-grooved member, the ribbon fiber, the bottom support member and the side support members are embeded in an adhesive layer.<br>
Now referring to the accompanying figures, particularly figure 1, the optical fiber array block 1, in accordance to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, comprises of an upper layer 2, herein after referred to as an upper plate 2; a lower layer 3, herein after referred to as lower plate 3; a middle layer 4 sandwitched in between the upper 2 and lower plates 3, a ribbon fiber 5 enclosed in jacket 6, a grooved member 7, a non-grooved member 8 and a set of support members (shown in figures 3, 4, 6 and 7 by numerals 17 and 18).<br>
In accordance to the preferred embodiment of the present invention the middle layer 4 consists of a grooved member 7 and a non-grooved member 8 on one end 9 and of a ribbon fiber 5 enclosed in a jacket 6 on the another end 9a. Now referring to figure 2, which shows the croos-sectional view of the presently disclosed fiber array block 1 across the line A-A', as shown in figure 1, the grooved member 7 consists of one or more of grooves 10, which accommodate optical fiber/fibers 11, which are obtained from the ribbon fiber 5, as described herein below. In accordance to one of the preferred embodiments of the present invention the optical fiber/fibers 11 is/are made to sit in the groove/grooves 10 in such a way that they (11) essentially have direct contact with sides 10a of the groove/grooves 10 made in the grooved member 7. Such contact of the optical fiber/fibers 11 with the said sides 10a of said groove/grooves 10 is/are preferably line contact, that is the contact through-out the length of the said groove/grooves 10. This arrangement ensures that the optical fiber/fibers 11 acquire the same spacing and alignment/orientation as that of the groove/grooves 10, hence avoiding<br>
additional efforts of adjustment of spacing and of alignment of the optical fiber/fibers 11, as required in the known fiber array blocks. Further, the optical fiber/fibers 11 make a contact 13 with the face, facing the optical fiber/fibers 11, of the non-grooved member 8. Such a contact 13 is also preferably a line contact for better orientation of the fiber/fibers 11 and better performance of the fiber array block 1. In accordance to the preferred embodiment of the present invention the gap 12 between the optical fiber 11 and the groove 10 is not filled with adhesive layer 4a.<br>
In accordance to one of the preferred embodiments of the present invention the grooved memebr 7 and non-grooved member 8 have preferably same thickness 14. Similarly the upper plate 2 and lower plate 3 preferably have same thickness 15. The widths 14a of the grooved member 7 and of non-grooved member 8 is preferably same and less than the widths 15a of the upper plate 2 and of lower plate 3, which in-turn have preferably same widths 15a. However the present invention is not restricted by relationship of thickness 14 of both the members 7 and 8, and of thickness 15 of both the plates 2 and 3. The controlling factor is the height 16 of the upper face 16a of the non-grooved member 8 from the upper surface 16b of the lower plate 3, which should match the height 16 as shown in figure 3 or 4 and described herein below. The groove/grooves 10 are preferably of V-shape. However, the present invention is not restricted by the shape of the groove/grooves 10.<br>
Now referring to figures 3 and 4, which show the croos-sectional view of the presently disclosed fiber array block 1 across the line B-B', as shown in figure 1, in accordance to two different preferred embodiments of the present invention, the ribbon fiber 5 after it is exposed from the jacket 6 and consisting of optical fiber/fibers 11, is made to sit preferably in the centre of the middle layer 4 and is supported by.set of support members 17 and 18 from three sides. The support member 17 supports the ribbon fiber 5 from the bottom and is referred to as bottom support 17 herein after, and the support members 18a, 18b, 18c and 18d support the ribbon fiber 5 from the sides and are therefore referred to as side support members 18a, 18b, 18c and 18d. From the top, the ribbon fiber 5 is covered/protected by the upper plate 2. In accordance to one of the preferred embodiments of the present invention the bottom support member 17 is one in number, but the side support members 18a and 18c may be one (as<br>
shown in figure 4) or more (as shown in figure 3) in numbers. Similarly the other side support members 18 b and 18d may also be one (as shown in figure 4) or more (as shown in figure 3) in numbers. However, the controlling factor is the height 16 as indicated in figures 3 and 4, which should be equal to the height 16 as indicated in figure 2 and described herein above.<br>
In accordance to one of the preferred embodiments of the present invention the thickness of set of side support members 18a and 18b is essentially equal to each other. Similarly the thickness of other set of side support members 18c and 18d is essentially equal to each other. However, the width of such sets of support members, that is 18a and 18b, and 18c and 18d may or may not be same, but the width of side support members 18a and 18c is preferably same, and of 18b and 18d is also preferably same.<br>
Now referring to figure 5, which shows the croos-sectional view of the presently disclosed fiber array block 1 across the line C-C', as shown in figure 1, in accordance to one of the preferred embodiments of the present invention, the exposed optical fiber/fibers 11 are made to sit in the centre of the middle layer 4. However, in accordance to one of the preferred embodiments of the present invention the distance over which the exposed optical fiber/fibers 11 sit without any support in the middle layer is short, so that the exposed optical fiber/fibers 11 are not subjected to any stress or strain, which may cause any damage or breakage to the exposed optical fiber/fibers 11. In accordance to the preferred embodiment of the present invention the ribbon fiber 5 is stripped-off to expose the optical fiber/fibers 11 just before the grooved member 7. The optical fiber/fibers 11 are made to sit in the grooves 10 made in the grooved member 7 and then covered with the non-grooved member 8, as described herein above with the help of figures 2 and 3/4.<br>
Figure-6 showing the top view of the optical fiber array block 1 of the present invention without the upper plate 2, in accordance to one of preferred embodiments of this invention indicates how the ribbon fiber 5 is made to sit in between the side support members 18a/18c and 18b/18d and above the bottom support member 17, and the exposed optical fiber/fibers 11 coming out of the ribbon fiber 5 approach towards the grooved member 7 and are covered by non-grooved member 8. The lengths 7a and 8a of grooved member 7 and of non-grooved<br>
ctively, appear to be different in figure 6, but in accordance to one of the liment of the present invention, the length 7a of grooved member 7 is as that of the length 8a of the non-grooved member 8, and the side faces of 7 and 8 are essentially in the same plane towards the end 9. Similarly, the 1 members 18 (not indicated in figure) are preferably same.
