[See Section 10]<br>
" A METHOD OF PROVIDING AN INDICATION SIGNAL"<br>
DIALOGIC CORPORATION, a corporation incorporated in the State of New Jersey of 1515 Route Ten, Parsippany, New Jersey 07054, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
The present invention relates to a method of providing an indication signal.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART It is known in the prior art to determine the interface class of a telephony network by reading reference material corresponding to a device connected to the network.  For example, a model number of a telephone is discovered by looking at the telephone, and then an owner's manual corresponding to the telephone is referenced.  If the owner's manual lists the interface class used by the telephone, one can assume the<br><br><br>
interface class of the telephone is the interface class for the network. . Alternatively, the vendor of the  telephone may be contacted and asked to provide the  interface class.  These current methods of determining the interface class of a communication pathway, such as a telephony network, are time consuming.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide a method and device for determining the interface class of a communication pathway.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention includes a method of providing an indication signal.  First, a communication pathway carrying signals is provided, and an interface device is connected to the communication pathway.  The interface device has conductors for carrying the signals provided by the communication pathway.  Next, the signals carried by the conductors are analyzed to determine which of the conductors are active conductors.  Then information about the active conductors or information about the signals carried by the active conductors . is compared to information corresponding to a known interface class.  If the active conductor information is similar to the interface class information, then a first type of. indication signal is<br><br>
sent to indicate the similarity.  However, if the active conductor information is not similar to the interface class information, then a second type of indication signal is sent to indicate the lack of similarity.<br>
The present invention also includes devices for executing the method.  One such device has a switch interface device connected to a computer, having software running thereon.  Another device is a computer readable storage medium having encoded instructions capable of instructing a computer to execute the method of the present invention.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Figures 1 and 2 illustrate a method according to the present invention.  The depicted method results in<br><br>
 providing an indication signal. In one embodiment of<br>
the present invention, the indication signal is a first<br><br>
type if a possible interface class has been discovered,<br>
and is a second type if an interface class has been<br>
considered and found not to be a possible interface<br><br>
class.  In the method, a communication pathway is provided and connected to an interface device having conductors (step 10).  The communication pathway carries<br><br>
signals, and the conductors are capable of carrying the signals.  In a telephony network, the conductors are commonly referred to as "pins."<br>
Next, the signals carried by the conductors are<br>
analyzed to determine which of the conductors are active<br><br>
{conductors (step 13), and active conductor information is provided (step 16) .  For example, the active conductor information may include a list of the active conductors. In a preferred embodiment of the method, the signals analyzed are restricted, for example by using an attenuator, to a desired voltage range.  In one embodiment of the invention, the voltage range is restricted to between +5 volts and -5 volts.<br>
In the method, interface class information is provided (step 19) and compared to the list of active conductor information.  The interface class information preferably includes information about the active<br><br>
conductors for a known interface class.  Then, a determination is made as to whether the interface class information is similar to the active conductor information (step 22) .  If the interface class information is determined to be similar to the active conductor information, then the first type of indication signal is provided (step 25) .  Alternatively, if the interface class information is determined not to be similar to the active conductor information, then the second type of indication signal is provided (step 25). Analyzing the conductors to determine which of the conductors are active conductors (step 13) preferably includes selecting a conductor and analyzing the signal carried by the selected conductor to determine whether a voltage of the signal alternates.  If the voltage of the signal carried by the selected conductor alternates, then the selected conductor may be considered a possible active conductor.  Further analysis of the signal carried by a possible active conductor may be required to confirm a possible active conductor is in fact an active conductor.<br>
The information about the active conductors for a known interface class may be considered to be similar to the active conductor information (step 22)   if the information about the active conductors for the known<br><br>
interface class is among the active conductor information.  For example, if it is determined conductors 1 through 6 are active, and a first interface class uses conductors 1 through 4 while a second interface class uses conductors 3 through 6, then both the first and second interface classes might be considered possible interface classes.  In the example, further analysis of the signals carried by conductors 1 through 6 would be necessary to determine which interface class is the interface class used on the communication pathway.  However, if a third interface class used conductor 7 or conductor 8, then the third interface class could be excluded from the possible interface classes that could be in use on the communication pathway.<br>
It may be beneficial to determine which conductors are active conductors (step 13) by excluding inactive conductors from consideration.  To do so, a preferred embodiment of the present invention determines which conductors carry a signal having an alternating voltage, and then determines an average amplitude voltage value for each of those conductors.  Next, a reference amplitude voltage is determined, and a determination is made as to which of those conductors carrying an alternating voltage have an average amplitude voltage<br><br><br>
value less than the reference amplitude voltage.  The reference amplitude voltage value may be determined by  selecting the highest average amplitude voltage value of all conductors, and setting the reference amplitude voltage to some fraction of the highest average amplitude voltage value.  For example, the fraction may be one-half.<br>
In this embodiment of the method, determining the average amplitude voltage value for one of the conductors carrying a signal having an alternating voltage may include measuring the voltage amplitude of the signal carried by one of the conductors during a first period of time and during a second period of time. Then the maximum measured voltage amplitude during the first period of time is selected, and the maximum measured voltage amplitude during the second period of time is selected. , The average of the selected maximum measured voltage amplitudes is determined to be the average amplitude voltage value.<br>
Measuring the voltage amplitudes during the first and second periods of time is preferably done at a plurality of discrete times during each time period. The plurality of measurements corresponding to the plurality of discrete times during a time period can be considered an array of measurements for the time period.<br><br>
If further analysis is required to determine the interface class corresponding to signals carried by the communication pathway, the conductors may be analyzed to determine which conductors are related to each other (step 28).  Interface classes  can be distinguished from each other by considering which conductors are grouped together.  Customarily, two conductors will together provide a signal carried on a telephony network.  From time to time herein the signal provided by more than one conductor is referred to as a "group signal."  For example, one interface class might group conductors 1 and 2, and might also group conductors 3 and 6.  A second interface class might group conductors 1 and 4 and might also group conductors 3 and 6.  By determining which conductors corresponding to a communication pathway are grouped, it would be possible to determine whether the first or the second interface class was being used on the communication pathway.<br>
Figure 2 shows a method according to the present invention, wherein the grouping (sometimes referred to as "pairing") of conductors (step 28). may be determined by analyzing the signals carried by the conductors to determine which of the conductors are active conductors, and then grouping the active conductors into groups of active conductors. For example, in a telephony system,<br><br><br>
known interface classes pair the conductors, and so the groups of active conductors will each have two active conductors.<br>
Then, primary interface class information, including information about the pairing of conductors for a known interface class, is provided (step 19) and compared (step 34) to the information about the groups of active conductors.  If the pairing of conductors for the known interface class is similar to the group information, then a first type of a first indication ,signal is provided to indicate the known interface class is similar to the interface class used on the communication pathway.  Alternatively, if the pairing of conductors for the known interface class is not similar to the group information, then a second type of the first indication signal is provided to indicate the known interface class is not similar to the interface class used on the communication pathway.<br>
Grouping the active conductors (step 28) may be done by determining possible pairs of active conductors, and determining an auto correlation value corresponding to each possible pair of active conductors (the "pair auto correlation value").  As used herein, the term "auto correlation" refers to manipulation of data primarily corresponding to a single conductor.  A<br><br>
threshold value is set and compared to the pair auto correlation value. Those possible pairs of active conductors having a pair auto correlation value below the threshold value are eliminated from further consideration.<br>
The pair auto correlation value corresponding  to a possible pair of active conductors may be determined by measuring a voltage amplitude of the signal carried by a first one of the active conductors at a plurality of discrete times during a first time period to provide a first array of voltage amplitudes.  Next, each of the voltage amplitudes in the first array is squared.  Then the squared voltage amplitudes are added together to provide a first sum of squares value.  A second sum of squares value is determined for the first active conductor corresponding to a second time period in a manner similar to that used to provide the first sum of squares value.  Next, third and fourth sum of squares values are determined for the second conductor corresponding to the first and second time periods in a manner similar to that used for the first and second sum of squares values respectively.<br>
Then, a first auto correlation value is determined by adding the first sum of squares value to the second sum of squares value.  Similarly, a second auto<br><br>
correlation value  is  determined by adding the third sum of squares  value  to  the   fourth  sum of  squares  value. The auto  correlation  value  corresponding to  the possible pair of active conductors   is  the  average of the first auto correlation value  and the  second auto  correlation value.<br>
After  determining  a  pair auto  correlation value  for each possible pair  of  active  conductors,   the  threshold value may be  set  equal  to   a multiple  of the  lowest pair auto correlation value.      For  example,   the threshold value may be set  at   four  times  the  lowest pair auto correlation value.<br>
Another method  for  grouping the  active   conductors, that may be used in  lieu   of or in addition to that described above,   utilizes   a  cross  correlation value.     As used herein,   the  term "cross  correlation"  refers to manipulation of data, primarily corresponding to at  least two  conductors.     In  this  method,   a  first  active conductor and a  second active conductor are  selected to provide  a possible pair  of  active  conductors   for analysis.     A cross  correlation value corresponding to the possible pair  of  active  conductors   (the "pair cross correlation value" )   is  determined and compared to a hreshold value.     If the  cross  correlation value  is  less<br><br><br>
 than the threshold value, the possible pair of active conductors is eliminated from further consideration.<br>
In this method, a preferred threshold value is set equal to a fraction, for example one-half, of an auto correlation value corresponding to the possible pair of active conductors.  The auto correlation value may be determined as described above.<br>
The cross correlation value corresponding to a possible pair of active conductors may be determined by using the arrays of measurements used to determine the pair auto correlation values.  Each measured voltage amplitude for one of the active conductors is multiplied by the corresponding measured voltage amplitude of the other conductor.  It should be noted that measured voltage amplitudes multiplied together to arrive at the cross correlation value preferably are taken at about the same discrete time, i.e. "corresponding" measured voltage amplitudes referenced in the immediately prior sentence are those measured voltage amplitudes taken at the same discrete time.  The multiplied measured voltage amplitudes are summed together to provide the cross correlation value corresponding to the possible pair of<br>
conductors.<br>
After determining the groups of active conductors and comparing the groups to information corresponding to<br><br>
a  known  interface  class,   a  determination   is  made  as  to whether the  information  corresponding  to  the  known interface  class  is  similar to the  groups   of  active conductors   (step 22).     A preferred criteria  for making this  determination is  to deem an  interface  class  similar<br>
■t<br>
if each pair of conductors in the interface class is the same as a pair of conductors in a group. .<br>
For example, it may be determined the groups of active conductors on the communication, pathway include a group comprised of conductors 1 and 3.  If a first interface class pairs conductors 1 and 3 while a second interface class pairs conductors 1 and 4, then the first interface class is a candidate for being the interface class used on the communication pathway, but the second interface class is not.<br>
After grouping the active conductors, and comparing the groups to known interface classes, more than one known interface class may be a candidate for the interface class used on the communication pathway.  One method for determining which known interface class is the interface class used, involves analyzing the signals carried by the groups of conductors.<br>
Interface classes of different encoding schemes may have different fourth moments. So, comparing the fourth moment of a known interface class to the fourth moment<br><br><br>
of a  signal   carried by the communication pathway can assist  in  determining which interface  class  corresponds to  the  signals  carried by the   communication pathway.<br>
For example,   the  fourth moment  of the  group  signal may be  compared to  information  about  the  fourth moment of a  signal   carried by a  corresponding pair of conductors  of a  known interface   class.      If  the comparison results  in a  determination that  the  fourth moments  are  similar,   then  the   interface  class  is selected as  a possible  interface  class.     Similarly,   if the  comparison results  in  a determination  that  the fourth moments are not  similar,  then the  interface class is  eliminated as a possible interface class. Preferably,   similarity between  the  fourth moments   is present  if the  fourth moment  of  the  signal   corresponding to  the  known  interface  class  is  within  about   35%  of the fourth moment  of the  group  signal.     If  similarity between  fourth moments  is  found,   a  first  type of indication signal is provided,   and if similarity between fourth moments is not found,   a  second type  of  indication signal  is provided.<br>
The  fourth moment measures  the  relative  peakedness or flatness  of a distribution.     The  fourth moment  for an array   of voltage amplitudes  is determined by determining the  average voltage amplitude  and the  standard deviation<br><br>
of the voltage amplitudes.  Next, the difference between each voltage amplitude measurement and the average amplitude is determined and divided by the standard deviation to produce a dividend corresponding to each measured voltage amplitude.  Each dividend is then raised to the fourth power (hence the term "fourth moment") to provide a result corresponding to each measured voltage amplitude.  The average of the results is the "fourth moment" referred to herein.<br>
After comparing the groups of active conductors to information about all known interface classes, as described above, more than one known interface class may be similar, and further analysis may be needed to determine which known interface class is the most probable interface class being used on the communication pathway.  One method of determining which known interface class is the most probable interface class is to analyze the spectral density corresponding to the signals sent via the communication pathway, and compare that spectral density to the spectral density of known interface classes.  If the spectral densities are similar, then a first type of indication signal is provided, and if the spectral densities are not similar, then a second type of indication signal is provided.<br><br><br>
It is known that the spectral density is dependent on the bit rate and encoding scheme used.  Therefore,<br>
t<br>
analyzing and comparing spectral densities may enable one to differentiate between possible' interface classes used on the communication pathway.<br>
One means of analyzing the spectral density is to use fast fourier transforms.  A fast fourier transform is determined for each group signal (the "group FFT"), and information corresponding to each determined fast fourier transform (the "group FFT information") is compared to fast fourier transform information corresponding to signals carried by pairs of conductors for known interface classes (the "IC FFT information"). The group FFT information and the IC FFT information may be comprised of data points generated by the respective fast fourier transforms wherein frequency, is the independent variable and voltage amplitude is the dependent variable.  For example, these data points may be the product of the real and imaginary components of the fast fourier transform.<br>
In one method, the group FFT information is normalized so the maximum data point of the group FFT information for one of the time periods is the same as the maximum data point of the IC FFT information.  Then, a comparison is made between the normalized group FFT<br><br>
information and the IC FFT information to determine the similarity between the two sets of FFT information.  The interface class resulting in the greatest similarity is selected as the most probable interface class being used on the communication pathway.<br>
As an example, the similarity may be determined by subtracting the data points corresponding to the group FFT information from the corresponding data points for the Ic FFT information to provide differential data points.  In this context, the word "corresponding" in the immediately preceding sentence may refer, for example, to data points related to the same frequency. Then each of the resulting differential data points is squared and the sum of the squared data points is provided.  The sum of the squared data points is referred to herein as the  "squared error."  The interface class corresponding to the lowest of the squared errors exhibits the greatest similarity, and is selected as the most probable interface class being used by the communication pathway.<br>
It has been found that a preferred method of determining the similarity includes determining a normalized set of data points corresponding to the group FFT information, and a corresponding set of data points corresponding to the IC FFT information.  Both data sets<br><br><br>
are smoothed, for example with a Savitzky-Golay filter, and then normalized.  The squared error is determined from the smoothed and normalized information.<br>
A Savitzky-Golay filter can be considered a weighted moving average.  It replaces each data point, f1 with a linear combination g1 of itself and some number of nearby neighbors according to the following equation:<br><br>
In the equation, NL is the number of data points used to the left of the filtered data point and NR is the number to the right, or in the example given above, the number of data points used that are lesser in frequency and greater in frequency, respectively.  Savitzky-Golay is a method of computing the coefficients, cn.  Chapter 14 of Numerical  Recipes In  C, second edition, written by William Press, Saul Teukolsky, William Vetterling and Brian Flannery, published by the Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge in 1992, has more information about the Savitzky-Golay method. Numerical Recipes In C,   is hereby incorporated by this reference.<br>
The smoothing filter coefficients are computed via the Savitzky-Golay method, as described in Numerical Recipes in C.  The coefficients are then used to smooth the data sets corresponding to the group FFT information<br><br>
and the.IC FFT information.  In one embodiment of the present invention, NL and NR were both equal to 128 and an order of 3 was used.  The Savitzky-Golay method is preferably also applied to the interface class FFT information.  Since the Savitzky-Golay method can widen main lobes and fill in nulls, the choice of coefficients used to smooth the data sets is preferably made to preserve the main lobe and the first null.<br>
It should be noted at this point that the fourth moment of some interface classes is a function of the loop length.  The measured fourth moment can be used to generate an estimate of the loop length.  The loop length estimate can then be used to enhance the process of comparing spectral density taking the effects of loop length into consideration when determining the group FFT information.<br>
The similarity between group signals and interface classes can be determined by comparing bit rate and encoding scheme information.  The spectral density described above is one method of using these characteristics.  Another method of determining bit rates uses a phase-lock-loop circuit ("PLL").  The PLL is applied against the incoming bit stream and indicates a lock when it identifies the bit rate.  To do so, the PLL may need a broad dynamic range in order to meet the<br><br>
wide range of bit rates characteristic of communication pathways, such as those communication pathways supporting telephony switches.<br>
Yet another method of determining the bit rate involves detecting zero crossings of the incoming bit stream.  It should be noted the alternating signals that are characteristic of the communication pathway cross a zero (average) voltage level as they alternate between maximum and minimum voltage values.  Zero (average) crossing timing is an indicator of the bit rate, as well as the bit rate precision that is characteristic of a particular interface class.<br>
When the corresponding measured voltage amplitudes are taken at the same discrete time, the resulting correlation value (auto correlation or cross correlation) is referred to herein as a "zero lag correlation value."  It should be noted that corresponding measured voltage amplitudes need not be taken at the same time.  In some situations it may be beneficial to have corresponding measured voltage amplitudes that are taken at different times.  For example, a time lag of 125 micro seconds, 250 micro seconds or 500 micro seconds has been found useful in determining which known interface class is used on a communication pathway.  When the corresponding measured<br><br><br>
voltage amplitudes are taken at different times, the resulting correlation value is referred to by the time lag, for example a "125 micro second lag correlation value."  The value in applying a lag to the correlation is to determine whether a signal exhibits any periodicity.  Periodicity is another factor that may be used to distinguish an interface class.  Some interface classes divide the signal into frame periods for conveying information, and may hence-exhibit a periodic signal that can be determined through the use of a non-zero lag correlation.<br>
Throughout the disclosure so far, various measurements have been described.  It should be noted additional measurements may be made to provide more representative information.  For example, it was stated the voltage amplitude of a signal is measured during a first time period and during a second time period.  As is well known, two measurements often give less representative information than would, for example, ten measurements.  The number of time periods and the number of discrete times within a time period should be selected to suit the particular situation.  For example, in most telephony networks', sampling the voltage amplitude of a signal during ten time periods of 800<br><br>
microseconds each, at a rate of 10 mega hertz, will produce sufficiently representative arrays.<br>
A device 100 for carrying out the methods described above is shown in Figures 3 and 4.  The device 100 includes a first connector 103 having a first set of conductors, a conductor selection device 106 and a second connector 109, which may include British Naval Connectors ("BNCs").  The first connector 103 is capable of connecting to a communication pathway 112 and carrying signals from the communication pathway 112 via the conductors.  For example, the first connector 103 may be an RJ-45 jack.  The conductor selection device 106 is connected to the first connector 103 and the second connector 109.  Preferably, the conductor selection device is capable of selecting between the conductors, and connecting some of the conductors to the second connector 109.<br>
A computer 115 is connected to the second connector 109 and has software running thereon.  An analog-digital converter 118 may be necessary for the computer 115 to interface with the second connector 109.  In an embodiment of the present invention, the analog-digital converter 118 provides two channels of data acquisition with a maximum sampling rate of 10 million samples per second at 12 bit precision.  A device driver for the<br><br>
computer 115 is advisable to provide a high level interface between the computer and the analog-digital converter 118.<br>
The software is capable of instructing the computer 115 to determine which of the conductors are active.
