				<td>METHODS AND DEVICES FOR<br>
AUTOMATIC DISPLAY OF PREPAY INFORMATION<br>
FIELD<br>
[0001] Disclosed are a mobile communication device, methods of a mobile<br>
communication device, and a network of a service provider for automatic display of<br>
prepay balance information, and more particularly transmitting a balance query to the<br>
server and receiving from the server a balance response, and providing an indication<br>
of the balance amount and expiration date to the user of the mobile device.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] A purchaser of a mobile communication device has many options as to<br>
how to pay for air time. One manner in which to pay for time is to sign up for a<br>
calling plan. In particular, a purchaser can choose a calling plan with a service<br>
provider that gives the user an allotment of minutes per month for a certain price.<br>
Any overages are billed to the customer. To purchase such plans, a service provider<br>
may run a credit check on the purchaser, or require their possession of a valid credit<br>
card and/or require income proof in some markets.<br>
[0003] Instead of purchasing a plan, an airtime customer may prefer to purchase a<br>
prepaid block of airtime. Accordingly, the customer will have a finite amount of time<br>
or calling value in a prepaid block of airtime. Once the prepaid block is consumed,<br>
the customer must purchase a new block of airtime.<br>
 <br>
[0004] As the prepaid airtime subscriber uses the communication device during<br>
active mode, the balance of remaining available airtime diminishes from the initial<br>
prepaid subscription. Unless the user has kept track of the minutes used, and knows<br>
the tariff or roaming charges, the user must rely on the service provider to inform him<br>
of the remaining balance. To learn the remaining balance of a prepaid subscription, a<br>
balance query is typically initiated by the user while the mobile communication<br>
device is in idle mode.<br>
[0005] Mobile communication devices may each have more than one service<br>
provider. The telephone number and characters to input for balance information and<br>
the formats of the balance information query and balance information message may<br>
be different for each service provider. The service provider's prepay server telephone<br>
number may be five digits that must be input on the mobile device's key pad.<br>
Additional steps may be required as well. The steps provided to the user are most<br>
often written in a user's manual relating to the service provider's services. If the<br>
communications device is made for only one service provider then the steps for<br>
obtaining balance information may be automated, but prepaid airtime subscribers<br>
generally want the flexibility to but prepaid airtime from different service providers.<br>
Furthermore device manufacturers may find it logistically difficult to provide<br>
different models for each service provider.<br>
[0006] Prepay users may have incentive to change service providers based on<br>
promotional offers and other circumstances. For some users, it can be difficult to<br>
follow and carry out the steps necessary to learn their remaining balance. Moreover,<br>
if a prepaid balance message in response to a query is in a format such as SMS, a user<br>
 <br>
may have difficulty interpreting the message to determine the remaining prepaid<br>
balance. It would be beneficial if the user could learn the remaining prepaid balance<br>
without manually entering the service provider's balance information telephone<br>
number and without following certain other steps. It would also be beneficial if the<br>
prepaid balance and a subscription expiration data were presented to a user in an easy<br>
to interpret manner. Subscription expiration data may also be referred to as validity<br>
information. It would be further beneficial were prepay uses able to view their<br>
balance amount and validity/ expiration date information in a consistent manner<br>
regardless of which service provider they were using at a particular time.<br>

significant effort and many design choices motivated by, for example, available time,<br>
current technology, and economic considerations, when guided by the concepts and<br>
principles disclosed herein will be readily capable of generating such software<br>
instructions and programs and ICs with minimal experimentation. Therefore, in the<br>
interest of brevity and minimization of any risk of obscuring the principles and<br>
concepts according to the present invention, further discussion of such software and<br>
ICs, if any, will be limited to the essentials with respect to the principles and concepts<br>
within the preferred embodiments.<br>
[0017] FIG. 1 depicts a mobile communication device 102 for a wireless<br>
communication system. The mobile device 102 may be implemented as a cellular<br>
telephone (also called a mobile phone). The mobile communication device 102<br>
represents a wide variety of devices that have been developed for use within various<br>
networks. Such handheld communication devices include, for example, cellular<br>
telephones, messaging devices, personal digital assistants (PDAs), notebook or laptop<br>
computers incorporating communication modems, mobile data terminals, application<br>
specific gaming devices, video gaming devices incorporating wireless modems, and<br>
the like. Any of these portable devices may be referred to as a mobile station or user<br>
equipment. Herein, wireless communication technologies may include, for example,<br>
voice communication, the capability of transferring digital data, SMS messaging,<br>
Internet access, multi-media content access and/or voice over internet protocol (VoIP)<br>
over a plurality of communication channels.<br>
 <br>
[0018] The wireless communication device can include at least one wireless<br>
transceiver 104, a controller 106, a memory 108 and modules 110, including for<br>
example, an obtaining module 112, a query format determining module 114, reading<br>
module 116, a transmission module 118, a receiving module 120, message format<br>
determining module 122, a comparing data module 124, an extraction module 126, a<br>
writing module 128, and a displaying module 130. The modules can carry out certain<br>
processes of the methods as described herein. The modules can be implemented in<br>
software, such as in the form of one or more sets of prestored instructions, and/or<br>
hardware, which can facilitate the operation of the mobile station or electronic device<br>
as discussed below. The modules may be installed at the factory or can be installed<br>
after distribution by, for example, a downloading operation. The operations in<br>
accordance with the modules will be discussed in more detail below.<br>
[0019] The local memory 108 can be configured to store format information<br>
including, for example, a format of a balance information query, a validity<br>
information query, a balance information message from a service provider to a<br>
balance information query, and an expiry date information message and/or a time<br>
remaining information message from a service provider. In addition to local memory<br>
or as an alternative to local memory 108, a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) can be<br>
configured to store format information as well as applications for extraction of the<br>
balance data from messages received in response to queries to the service provider.<br>
[0020] FIG. 2 illustrates a SIM seen from the back side of a mobile<br>
communication device 202. The back side can include a battery holder 240. Often<br>
below a battery holder in a mobile communication device 202 is an easily accessed<br>
 <br>
SIM card holder 242. The SIM card typically holds identification information for<br>
user validation and authentication purposes, for example including a service<br>
provider's identification, but may also provide memory for additional data storage. In<br>
addition to local memory or as an alternative to local memory 108, a SIM can be<br>
configured to store format information including a format of a balance information<br>
message from a service provider to a balance information query. It is understood that<br>
a SIM may be in any type of configuration, and can be made accessible in any<br>
suitable manner. It is further understood that there may be additional memory<br>
provided that is not a SIM, but accessible and/or removable from the device in a<br>
similar manner to that of a SIM. It is understood that by the term SIM, any additional<br>
memory card is within the scope of this discussion.<br>
[0021] FIG. 3 depicts an overall system view including a mobile communication<br>
device 302, a base station 344 and a prepay server 346. The mobile communication<br>
device 302 can be in communication 348 and 350 with a prepay server 346 via a base<br>
station 344. While FIG. 3 depicts a typical network arrangement, it is understood that<br>
any type of network is within the scope of this discussion. The mobile<br>
communication device 302 may be, for example, in communication in a WIFI<br>
network, an ad hoc network or via mobile-to-mobile.<br>
[0022] The server 346 is depicted as a remote server within a wireless<br>
communication network 344. The network 346 of course may be any type of wireless<br>
network including an ad hoc or wireless personal area network, a WiFi or wireless<br>
local area network, and a cellular, wireless wide area network and mobile-to-mobile.<br>
Likewise, the server 346 may be of any suitable configuration. The server 346 may be<br>
 <br>
implemented as a single server or as a plurality of servers in communication in any<br>
arrangement. The operations of the server 346 may be distributed among different<br>
servers or devices that may communicate in any manner. It is understood that the<br>
depiction in FIG. 3 is for illustrative purposes.<br>
[0023] The prepay server 346 may be affiliated with a service provider or<br>
otherwise. The term "prepay server" can mean any entity that can receive from a<br>
mobile communication device 302, directly or indirectly, a balance information query<br>
sent while the mobile communication device is engaged in active mode wireless<br>
communication or inactive mode. Moreover, the entity, affiliated entity or otherwise<br>
can respond to the balance information query of the mobile communication device by<br>
transmitting a response including a balance information message that is substantially<br>
current when the response is transmitted.<br>
[0024] The prepay server or wireless communication network of a service<br>
provider may include a controller 352, a memory 354 coupled to the controller 352<br>
where the memory can be configured to store a balance information message format.<br>
The balance information message format can be particular to the service provider.<br>
[0025] A transceiver 356 can be coupled to the controller 352. The transceiver<br>
352 can be configured to receive a balance information query directly or indirectly<br>
from a mobile communication device. The controller can be configured to retrieve<br>
the balance information message format, process the request, and generate a balance<br>
information message to transmit. The service provider may receive a balance<br>
information query via a communication channel particular to the service provider and<br>
 <br>
can transmit a balance information message via the communication channel particular<br>
to the service provider or via another channel. If the mobile communication device<br>
302 is in active wireless communication mode, the query and message in response can<br>
be sent on a channel different from the channel of the active mode. In active mode,<br>
the channel for voice communication of preference may be GSM. The query and<br>
message in response to the query may be sent on another channel such as USSD,<br>
SMS, IVR and Internet which can be different from the voice communication<br>
channel. If the communication is data communications such as downloads and<br>
Internet communication, then a different channel or set of channels may be required<br>
for the balance information query and message in response. It is understood that the<br>
channel for the query and the message in response to the query may be information<br>
stored in the memory 354 of the prepay server and in the memory of the device either<br>
or both the memory 108 (see FIG. 1) and the SIM 242 (see FIG. 2).<br>
[0026] Returning to FIG. 1, the mobile communication device 102 can further<br>
include a display device 132 that can display balance information, both of a prepaid<br>
amount 134 and an expiry date 135 together or separately, and any other suitable<br>
information. The announcement or annunciation of display balance and/or one or<br>
more expiry dates may be provided in any manner, such as by an audio (and/ or<br>
visual) signal. As will be discussed in detail below, the display of the balance<br>
information and/or the expiry date can be on a dedicated portion of the display screen.<br>
For example, indicia may be displayed in an always-on manner, that is, while the<br>
device is in active and inactive mode. Moreover, since the data can be extracted from<br>
a recognized format of a balance information message sent in response to a query<br>
 <br>
from the device, it can be represented in a consistent manner from many or all service<br>
providers. One or more service providers may operate in a plurality of regions or<br>
areas, each may have a particular format for their balance information messages.<br>
Therefore, the process of extraction of the data when an incoming message conforms<br>
to the format of a balance information method can provide for a consistent display of<br>
the data on a display device regardless of the service provider's format.<br>
[0027] Still referring to FIG. 1, the controller 106 can be coupled to the<br>
transceiver 104 and the memory 108, and can be configured to generate a<br>
communication which may be a balance information query to the service provider,<br>
and can receive an incoming message from the service provider. The communication<br>
may be automatically generated or manually generated. Automatic generation may<br>
be, for example, periodic or random. The frequency of queries may depend upon the<br>
rate at which the prepaid balance is decreasing. The controller may monitor the<br>
prepaid balance and compare successive balances to determine if there is a fast<br>
decrease in the balance which may reflect a high tariff. Tariffs may differ, for<br>
example, depending upon the time of day of a communication and/or roaming<br>
charges. User preferences may provide user options for the frequency of queries. It<br>
may be that there is a charge for query responses, and the user may wish to limit the<br>
queries to a certain number per day, or a frequency such as once every five minutes<br>
during a communication. A service provider may also have prepaid plans where<br>
rental and administration fees are decremented on a daily or otherwise basis.<br>
Therefore, even if a user does not use his device for communication every day, the<br>
prepaid balance may be reduced. Accordingly, the application for a query and<br>
 <br>
message may be activated, for example, every twelve hours, to update the balance<br>
even in idle mode.<br>
[002S] In one embodiment, the balance information is displayed continuously on<br>
the display. The queries and responses may occur in rapid succession to maintain<br>
current balance on the display. In the alternative, one or more applications running on<br>
the device may extrapolate the current balance between incoming messages based on<br>
previous balances, tariffs and time elapsed. In some networks the balance information<br>
is automatically sent without there having been a query. In these situations automatic<br>
queries may be cancelled in order to eliminate unnecessary network traffic. It is<br>
understood that the frequency and conditions under at which automatic queries are<br>
made may depend on many variables and circumstances.<br>
[0029] For manual transmission of a query, the wireless transceiver 104 that may<br>
receive user input via the keypad 136 or any other input mechanism. The device 102<br>
can also include a keypad 136 having a dedicated query input key 137 of the key pad<br>
for inputting a signal to the controller 106 to generate and transmit the balance<br>
information query to the service provider (346, see FIG. 3). Manual transmission of<br>
a query may be during active or inactive mode.<br>
[0030] As mentioned above, the local memory 108 and/or the SIM 242 (see FIG.<br>
2) can be configured to store format information including, for example, a format of a<br>
balance information query, a validity information query, and a balance information<br>
message from a service provider as a response to a balance information query. For<br>
the device 102 to generate a balance information query, the service provider<br>
 <br>
identification and the format of the balance information query can be accessed from<br>
memory 108 and/or 242 by the controller 106. The service provider may provide both<br>
the balance information and expiry date information together in the balance<br>
information message in response to the balance information query. On the other<br>
hand, a query for the balance information and a query for the expiry date information,<br>
such also being a form of a balance information query, can be made separately and<br>
responded to separately by the prepaid server and/or other entity.<br>
[0031] The format of the balance information query can include the service<br>
provider identification. A service provider may operate in a plurality of regions and<br>
therefore the region or the area of a wireless communication may also be included<br>
with the format data. The requirements of the service provider may differ from region<br>
to region and area to area. A prepay service may be operated by an entity different<br>
from the service provider so requirements for query and message formats may be<br>
particular to the region or area.<br>
[0032] In addition to the service provider identification, a channel type particular<br>
to the service provider as described above may be provided with the format data. The<br>
service provider contact information may include data such as the numbers and/or<br>
characters transmitted to contact the prepay server, and any other query data. As<br>
mentioned above, the channel for query and message communication may be<br>
dependent upon whether the device is in active or inactive mode, and if in active<br>
mode, the type of communication during active mode, such as voice, data and<br>
Internet.<br>
 <br>
[0033] The format of the balance information message can be an expected<br>
response from the service provider. The expected response can be compared against<br>
an incoming message received from the service provider via a channel particular to<br>
the service provider. If the incoming message conforms to the expected response,<br>
balance information and/or expiry data information may be extracted from the balance<br>
information response. As discussed above, the format of the balance information<br>
message can provide service provider identification. It may also include a balance<br>
field identifier, such as a currency symbol. The format may also include an expiry<br>
date format provided in any of the many manners in which to write a date. The<br>
format may also include unique identifier such as "$$" at beginning of balance<br>
information message and additionally or optionally, the format may also include<br>
numeric information field location such as that the first numeric information is the<br>
remaining prepaid balance and such as that the second numeric information is the<br>
expiry date. The format of the balance information message may include a unique<br>
identifier of the message and/or the sentence comprising the balance amount and<br>
expiration date information.<br>
[0034] The service provider identification, the formats for the balance information<br>
query and the balance information message, the channel type and any other pertinent<br>
information may be stored in a data table. The query and message data may be stored<br>
in memory of the device for users from two or more countries, regions or areas. The<br>
mobile communication device may also store information including the data table,<br>
data relating to the service providers, their service provider identifications, their<br>
different currencies, their different date formats, their different communication<br>
 <br>
channels, and data relating to their different written and spoken languages. However,<br>
if the service provider information, the formats for the balance information query and<br>
the balance information message, the channel type or any other pertinent information<br>
is stored in the SIM then there may be no need for a table of formats.<br>
[0035| FIG. 4 is a flow chart illustrating an embodiment of a method 460 as<br>
described herein. As mentioned above, a balance information query may be generated<br>
and transmitted in active or inactive mode. The channel chosen for the transmission<br>
may depend upon the mode of the device. To generate a balance information query,<br>
the device can optionally obtain a service provider identity from a SIM 462. An<br>
obtaining module 112 (see FIG. 1) of the device 102 can be configured, for example,<br>
to obtain the service provider identity from a SIM. In one embodiment, the format<br>
data of the query and the message in response to the query may be accessible in idle<br>
mode. In this manner an always-on display can be updated. In another embodiment,<br>
the format data can be stored in, for example, a cache and accessed and used during<br>
active mode so that the display can be updated during communication.<br>
[0036] A format of a balance information query particular to the service provider<br>
may be determined 464 by reading a query format stored in local memory 108, the<br>
SIM 242 or another data storage device. The query format determining module 114<br>
can be configured to form a determined balance information query format based upon<br>
the reading module 116 reading the format data from a data table that is either stored<br>
in the SIM or local memory during manufacture and/or distribution, or downloaded at<br>
any time before or after distribution of the device and/or the SIM.<br>
 <br>
[0037] Reading format data for a balance information query from any of the<br>
memory units of the device may be provided by the reading module 116.<br>
Additionally, the reading module 116 can be configured to read the data of any of the<br>
memory units of the device in determining the format of the balance information<br>
message that can be provided in response to the balance information query.<br>
[0038] Upon determining the balance information query, a query can be<br>
transmitted to the service provider according to the determined balance information<br>
query format 468. The transmission module 118 can access the channel for<br>
transmission as described above. The receiving module 120 can be configured to<br>
receive an incoming message 470. The incoming message may be a response by the<br>
service provider to the balance information query.<br>
[0039] The format of the balance information message can be a determined or<br>
expected format. The data stored regarding the format may be provided by the<br>
service provider to the manufacturers or distributors of the device 102 or the SIM 242.<br>
As discussed above, the data stored in local memory and/or the SIM relating to the<br>
format of a balance information message can be accessed by the controller 106 of the<br>
device 102 to determine the format of the balance information message 472. It is<br>
understood, that instead of or in addition to accessing a data table, any process for<br>
determining a format of a balance information message particular to the service<br>
provider is within the scope of this discussion.<br>
[0040| A message format determining module 122 (see FIG. 1) of the device 102<br>
can be configured, for example, to determine a format of a balance information<br>
 <br>
message form data stored in the SIM 242 and/or local memory 108, or to determine a<br>
format of a balance information message in another mariner. For example, the service<br>
provider may download the format for the balance information message in a<br>
preceding or the same message. The entire or a portion of the format of the balance<br>
information message can be sent by the service provider in response to the query as a<br>
header and then stored in a cache for example, so it also can be used in an extraction<br>
application. The data may be stored in short term memory such as a cache and then<br>
may be written to a data table stored in long term memory. In the alternative, the<br>
service provider may fashion the format based on the information balance query in a<br>
manner that requires less or no access to data stored in a memory of the device for the<br>
format of the balance information message. The device can therefore identify a<br>
balance information message from the service provider according to the determined or<br>
expected format of the balance information message.<br>
[0041] Upon determining the format of the balance information message, the<br>
device 102 can compare the incoming message with the determined format of the<br>
balance information message 474. A comparing module 124 can be configured to<br>
determine whether the incoming message conforms to the determined format of the<br>
balance information message. If it is found that there is no conformity, the process<br>
may end 476. If it found that there is conformity to any suitable degree, the extraction<br>
module 126 can extract balance information from the balance information message<br>
according to the format of the balance information message to form extracted balance<br>
information 478. The balance information can include a remaining prepaid balance<br>
and/or can include an expiry date. As mentioned above, the remaining prepaid<br>
 <br>
balance and the expiry data may be combined in a balance information message, or<br>
they may be delivered separately and they may be queried separately as well. Expiry<br>
date data may be requested and extracted from the response in the same, similar or<br>
different formats to that of a prepaid balance query.<br>
[0042] Depending upon the service provider, the format of the message either<br>
may need interpretation by an application of the device or of the SIM, or may be<br>
provided in a format that may be directly displayed. In one embodiment, upon<br>
determining whether the incoming message substantially conforms to a format of a<br>
balance information message stored in a memory of the mobile communication<br>
device, the balance of the information balance message can be extracted and<br>
displayed on a display or otherwise annunciated by the device. In another<br>
embodiment, an incoming message can be written 480 to a memory of the mobile<br>
communication device if a part or the entire incoming message conforms to the<br>
format of a balance information message 478. Writing the incoming message to a<br>
memory of the mobile communication device can include writing the incoming<br>
message to an SMS file of a SIM 242 (see FIG. 2) of the mobile communication<br>
device. A SIM application or SIM Tool Kit (STK) functionality may convert the<br>
message to a form that can be displayed on the display device 132 (see FIG. 1). After<br>
the SMS file is retrieved by a SIM application 482, a part of the message or the entire<br>
message can be displayed on the display device 484. In this manner, the most<br>
pertinent information such as the remaining balance information and/or the expiry<br>
date can be displayed in an easy to understand display format on, for example, a<br>
dedicated display screen or portion of a display screen 132 (FIG. 1). A SIM<br>
 <br>
application, STK or other application can be updated by downloading new data from a<br>
service provider to the device or SIM as updates are available. Alternatively, certain<br>
portions of a message string may be downloaded and/or overwritten. The frequency<br>
of downloads can depend upon the service provider. For example, the service<br>
provider may transmit downloads during the device and network hand shaking<br>
process when the device is powered up. Application updates or downloads may<br>
include new balance query and response formats.<br>
[0043] As mentioned, the format of the message may also include numeric<br>
information field location such as that the first numeric information is the remaining<br>
prepaid balance and such as that the second numeric information is the expiry date.<br>
Additionally, different criteria for determining a balance information message format<br>
may be processed. For example, to determine if a message is conforming to a<br>
determined balance information message, the application may analyze the incoming<br>
message for a currency symbol immediately preceding or succeeding a numeric<br>
character. The extraction application may also process a message as a balance<br>
information message if a currency symbol is the first word of the message or the first<br>
word of a string. In another embodiment, the phrase "balance is" may precede a<br>
currency symbol and a numeric symbol. In another embodiment, the word "balance"<br>
may precede a currency symbol and a numeric symbol. In yet another embodiment,<br>
"is" may precede a currency symbol preceding a numeric character. In another<br>
embodiment the balance information message may begin with a unique identifier such<br>
as $$ followed by sentence comprising first numeric data corresponding to prepaid<br>
balance amount and second numeric information in any of the date formats<br>
 <br>
corresponding to the expiration date. Moreover, a handset application and/or SIM<br>
application (STK.) may process different variations for currency symbols, misspellings<br>
and colloquial terminology.<br>
[0044] As with the prepaid balance message format, an incoming message that<br>
may be expiry date message may be similarly analyzed to determine if it conforms to<br>
an expected expiry date message format. As mentioned, the format of the message<br>
may also include numeric information field location such as that the first numeric<br>
information is the remaining prepaid balance and such as that the second numeric<br>
information is the expiry date. If the validity query number is unique and a date is the<br>
first item in the response message, then the data may be an expiry date and can<br>
therefore be extracted and displayed. Alternatively, the message may include one or<br>
more numeric characters preceded or succeeded by words, for example expiry,<br>
expiration, validity, valid till, and valid until, the value for the expiry date may be<br>
extracted by the SIM or STK application, or other application of the device. While<br>
formats for balance information queries and messages may be accessed from one or<br>
more memories of a device, other information may be accessed as well.<br>
[0045] Certain service provides may automatically transmit a new balance after a<br>
communication. Such a feature may be activated or not during the SIM<br>
personalization, depending upon the user's or service provider's needs. Under such<br>
circumstances, the application may de-activate, in whole or in part, its automatic<br>
query application if the service provider automatically transmits balance information<br>
messages. Depending upon the circumstances, the SIM may have no role in managing<br>
display of automatic messages sent by service provider on handset. The automatic<br>
 <br>
transmission can be by the network and handset can display the incoming message if<br>
handset is configured to display the message. Moreover, the query process can be<br>
managed by the handset and the same intelligence at which junctures to query the<br>
service provider network or not can be built into the handset.<br>
[0046] As briefly mentioned above, the formats of the query and message may be<br>
stored in memory upon manufacture of the device or distribution of the device and/or<br>
the SIM. Alternatively, the formats may be provided by the service provider at a<br>
different time. For example, the service provider may transmit and the device may<br>
download the formats to memory initially or at a later time. The controller 106 (see<br>
FIG. 1) of the device can be also configured to overwrite format information that is<br>
stored in the memory based on the data downloaded from the service provider. For<br>
example, the service provider may update the format initially provided to the device.<br>
In that event, the device can download a revised format for a query or a message in<br>
response to a query.<br>
[0047J For prepay customers there may be incentive to change service providers<br>
based on promotional offers and other circumstances. In that event, having available<br>
and/or accessible query and message format data for a plurality of service providers in<br>
a particular region or area, and an application for extracting their balance information<br>
messages in response to queries in a consistent manner may be beneficial to the user<br>
of the device. As discussed in detail above, when the device receives a message in<br>
response to the query and extracts the balance information and/or expiry date based<br>
on the format data, the pertinent information can be display or otherwise annunciated<br>
in a consistent manner, regardless of which service provider the user may use at a<br>
 <br>
particular time. In this manner, a user need not follow difficult to understand steps<br>
specific to a service provider that would be necessary to learn their remaining balance.<br>
