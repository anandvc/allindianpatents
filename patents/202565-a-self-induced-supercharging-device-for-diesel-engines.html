				<td>FIELD OF APPLICATION<br>
The present invention relates to a supercharging device for diesel engines. More specifically, the invention relates to a self induced supercharging device for diesel engines.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In diesel engines at the beginning of a compression stroke the engine cylinder can be charged with air at a pressure higher than the atmospheric pressure. This will cause more oxygen to be present, thus allowing more fuel to be burned more efficiently, thereby increasing the mean effective pressure and power output from the engine. This process of charging the engine cylinders with an increased amount of air at a pressure higher than the atmospheric pressure is known as supercharging.<br>
Larger diesel engines are usually provided with arrangement for supercharging. For supercharging a conventional marine engine, the compressed air can be supplied by a rotary blower driven by an exhaust gas turbine fitted in the exhaust manifold. The cylinders are generally supercharged to a pressure of about 5 lbs per sq.in. over the atmospheric pressure. The rotary blower for supercharging can also be driven by chains from the engines.<br>
GB Patent 693 688 describes an air compressor which receives air under pressure from an auxiliary air compressor and delivers compressed air through a cooler. The auxiliary air compressor can be driven by a driving means which can also be independent of the engine.<br>
-2-<br><br>
One of the main purpose of supercharging of engine cylinders is to provide additional supply of air for combustion to obtain a higher power output from the engine without increasing the cylinder size thereby increasing the size and weight of the engine. This is achieved by making available an increased weight of air for combustion which would allow any increased amount of fuel to be burnt efficiently, thereby increasing the power developed per cycle.<br>
Since the power output from an internal combustion engine is also dependent on the quantity of air available for combustion, one advantage of supercharging is that for a given power output from the engine, the size and weight of the engine, and hence its initial cost will be greatly reduced.<br>
When the pressure of air in the cylinders of a diesel engine at the beginning of a compression stroke is equal to the atmospheric pressure, the mean indicated pressure of the engine is usually 100 lbs per square inch- If the cylinder pressure is raised by 50% by supercharging, i.e. to about 7.35 lbs.per square inch gauge, then the weight of air available will be 50% higher and 50% more fuel could be burnt per cyle. This would raise the mean indicated pressure to 150 lbs per square inch, thereby increasing the power output by 50%.<br>
In automobile engines, an added advantage of supercharging can be more efficient burning of fuel due to greater availability of air thus reducing air pollution.<br>
-3-<br><br>
In automobile enginese however, the constraint of space does not permit the use of a blower for supercharging.<br>
One major disadvantage in the conventional supercharging system is the use of additional equipment in the form of a rotary blower driven by an exhaust gas turbine- Such equipment are very complicated, needs regular maintenance and involves high  capital<br>
cost.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
In the present invention, supercharging by the conventional blower has been done away with by using a much simpler arrangement  at  practically no extra cost as will  be  described<br>
below.<br>
Thus one object of the present invention is to supercharge engine cylinders at the beginning of a compression stroke without using any additional equipment like an air blower.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to eliminate any maintenance cost on supercharging arrangement.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to introduce supercharging in smaller engines like automobile engines where conventional blowers cannot be used because of space constraints.<br>
-4-<br><br>
A sti11 further object of the present invention is to use supercharging in automobile engines and thereby reducing road pollution.<br>
In the present invention supercharging is achieved by inserting the exhaust pipe into an extended open ended inlet manifold at a point closer to its extended open end.<br>
When the engine is operated, the exhaust gas from the exhaust pipe will create a partial vacuum by induction. This will cause a greater in rush of air from the other open end of the inlet manifold, thereby increasing the air pressure into the inlet manifold which is greater than the atmospheric pressure. This increased air pressure in the inlet manifold will cause supercharging in the engine cylinders in the same manner as caused by a blower.<br>
Thus the present invention is a self induced supercharging arrangement for a diesel engine comprising an open ended inlet manifold and an exhaust manifold wherein the open end of said exhaust manifold is introduced into an extended open ended inlet manifold at a point closer to the extended open end of said inlet manifold, thereby causing supercharging.<br>
In the case of heavy duty diesel engines like marine engines and engines for earth moving machinery etc. the exhaust  manifold<br>
-5-<br><br>
may be introduced into the vertical portion of the inlet manifold, keeping this end of the inlet manifold also open through which the exhaust gases can pass.<br>
By increasing the height of the vertical portion of the inlet manifold, the natural draught created can be used with advantage for further increasing the pressure of supercharging air over the atmospheric pressure.<br>
In the case of smaller engines like automobile engines, generators etc- the inlet and exhaust manifolds may run parallel to each other or one above the other.<br>
The two manifolds can be supported in the usual manner and the device can be introduced at practically no extra cost.<br>
Supercharging in automobile engines, as already explained, will  also  result  in a reduction in air  pollution  by  exhaust<br>
gases.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Fig. 1 shows the turbine and blower arrangement of supercharging in a conventional diesel engine.<br>
Fig- 2 shows the cylinder head of diesel engine of Fig. 1 fitted  with  a supercharging device in accordance  with  present<br>
invention<br>
-6-<br><br>
Fig. 3 shows another embodiment of the present invention which can be used in smaller engines like automobile engines.<br>
Fig. 1 shows the supercharging arrangement for a conventional diesel engine where the exhaust manifold 3 is connected to the exhaust ports 6 of the engine cylinder head 1. At the end of the exhaust manifold 3 is fitted an exhaust gas turbine 4 which drives the rotary air blower 5 fitted in the vertical portion of the inlet manifold 2 supplying supercharged air to the engine cylinders through the inlet ports 7,.<br>
This  gas  turbine/air blower arrangement has been  done  away with in the present invention, as shown in Fig, 2.<br>
The open end of the exhaust manifold 3 is introduced inside the vertical portion of the inlet manifold 2- The exhaust gas coming out of exhaust manifold 3 creates a partial vacuum by induction in the inlet manifold as shown by the arrows in Fig- 2 and results in a greater on rush of air through the other open end 8 of the open ended inlet manifold 2, thereby causing supercharging at the engine cylinders.<br>
The arrangement of Fig. 3 shows in a smaller manner the application of the present invention of self induced supercharging which can be used in smaller engines like autontobile engines .<br>
