				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
ELECTRON BEAM RECORDING APPARATUS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an<br>
electron beam recording apparatus that records<br>
information by irradiating an electron beam onto<br>
a predetermined position, and particularly<br>
relates to an electron beam recording apparatus<br>
used for producing a master of optical disks by<br>
printing a pattern with an electron beam.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In recent years, there has been a<br>
growing demand for accuracy improvement of<br>
microfabrication technology such as exposure<br>
technology for master optical disks and<br>
semiconductor technology. For example, optical<br>
disks are fabricated through a master disk<br>
production process for producing a stamper from<br>
a glass plate and a disk production process for<br>
producing optical disks with use of an injection<br>
mold with the stamper mounted thereon.<br>
In a typical master disk production<br><br>
process, a master disk production machine emits<br>
a visible light, an ultraviolet laser light, or<br>
the like from the light source in an ambient<br>
atmosphere and focuses the light to have a spot<br>
diameter of the level of wavelength by a high<br>
power objective lens. With this light, a pit<br>
pattern latent image corresponding to<br>
information signals or the like to be recorded<br>
is formed on a glass plate having a photoresist<br>
layer on a principal surface thereof. After<br>
cutting the photoresist layer, the glass plate<br>
goes through a development process or an<br>
electroforming process so as to be a stamper.<br>
While cutting the master disk, the<br>
master disk production machine rotates the<br>
master disk so as to relatively move the<br>
irradiation position of the visible light or the<br>
ultraviolet light in the radial direction of the<br>
master disk. A problem with such a master disk<br>
cutting process using a visible light or an<br>
ultraviolet laser light is that the recording<br>
resolution of information signals to be recorded<br>
is limited due to limitations of a light spot<br>
diameter, resulting in preventing high density<br>
recording.<br><br>
Cutting by electron beams is able to<br>
form finer patterns compared with cutting by<br>
laser beams.<br>
In a typical master disk production<br>
machine using an electron beam, however, the<br>
electron beam is deflected by magnetic field<br>
fluctuations inside and outside of the machine,<br>
which leads to a variation of a spot position of<br>
the electron beam focused by a focusing unit.<br>
This lowers accuracy of the track pitch of<br>
master disks or causes reproduction jitter.<br>
The causes of the magnetic field<br>
fluctuations inside and outside the machine<br>
include variation of earth magnetism due to<br>
movement of vehicles, elevators, or the like,<br>
electromagnetic waves emitted from power supply<br>
systems such as cabinet panels, and magnetism<br>
generated by a rotating mechanism or a disk<br>
transport mechanism of the master disk<br>
production machine.<br>
Especially, the magnetism generated by<br>
the rotating mechanism, the disk transport<br>
mechanism, or the like causes a significant<br>
variation of the electron beam irradiation<br>
position. There are therefore proposed various<br><br>
methods for reducing influence of the magnetism<br>
generated by the rotating mechanism or the disk<br>
transport mechanism, or the like (see Patent<br>
Documents 1 - 3).<br>
Patent Document 1 discloses, as a<br>
method of removing noise, a magnetic shield<br>
device that blocks magnetic noise attempting to<br>
enter a box-shaped magnetic shield room having a<br>
wall made of a high permeability member.<br>
The magnetic shield device disclosed in<br>
Patent Document 1 includes a detection coil<br>
passing through through holes of a wall and<br>
wound around the wall for outputting an induced<br>
voltage corresponding to variation of magnetic<br>
noise as a detection signal, a cancel coil<br>
receiving an external current so as to generate<br>
a magnetic field for compensating for the<br>
magnetic noise detected by the detection coil,<br>
and a controller for controlling a current to be<br>
supplied to the cancel coil based on the output<br>
of the detection coil. A pair of Helmholtz coil<br>
is used as the cancel coil that generates a<br>
magnetic field in the same direction as magnetic<br>
flux detected by the detection coil.<br>
Patent Document 2 discloses an<br><br>
information recorder that includes a rotating<br>
unit for rotating a master of information<br>
recording media, an irradiating unit for<br>
irradiating an information recording electron<br>
beam onto a recording surface of the master, a<br>
transport unit for relatively moving the master<br>
and the irradiating unit in a direction parallel<br>
to the recording surface, and a vacuum<br>
atmosphere forming unit for accommodating the<br>
rotating unit and the irradiating unit in a<br>
vacuum atmosphere.<br>
According to Patent Document 2, the<br>
rotating unit of the information recorder<br>
includes a turntable on which the master is<br>
placed, a spindle shaft for supporting the<br>
turntable, an electromagnetic motor for rotating<br>
the spindle shaft, and a magnetic shield unit<br>
for shielding against magnetism generated in the<br>
electromagnetic motor.<br>
In the information recorder of Patent<br>
Document 2, in order to reduce magnetic noise<br>
from the electromagnetic motor, the entire<br>
electromagnetic motor is surrounded by a<br>
magnetic casing (high permeability material) for<br>
blocking the magnetism, thereby preventing an<br><br>
electron beam from being influenced by an<br>
electromagnetic field generated by the<br>
electromagnetic motor.<br>
Patent Document 3 discloses an electron<br>
beam irradiation device and a method for<br>
eliminating influence of magnetism generated<br>
from a rotating mechanism or a master transport<br>
mechanism and magnetism in the vicinity of an<br>
electron gun. The electron beam irradiation<br>
device of Patent Document 3 drives an electron<br>
beam deflection electrode according to outputs<br>
of plural magnetic detectors disposed in the<br>
vicinity of an electron beam generator or in a<br>
vacuum chamber, deflects an electron beam in a<br>
direction for canceling deflection of the<br>
electron beam due to variation of magnetic field,<br>
and thus corrects displacement of an electron<br>
beam focus spot on a master due to the variation<br>
of magnetic field.<br><patent document> Japanese Patent<br>
Application Publication No. 2003-124683<br><patent document> Japanese Patent<br>
Application Publication No. 6-131706<br><patent document> Japanese Patent<br>
Application Publication No. 2002-217086<br><br>
Referring back to the magnetic shield device<br>
disclosed in Patent Document 1, although the<br>
cancel coil needs to be highly accurately<br>
mounted, it is difficult to accurately mount the<br>
Helmholtz coil because of its relatively large<br>
size. If the Helmholtz coil is not formed in an<br>
ideal shape, the magnetic field generated by the<br>
Helmholtz coil is not uniform, resulting in<br>
lowering of device accuracy. Moreover, a<br>
facility using the magnetic shield device of<br>
Patent Document 1 is large and expensive.<br>
Referring to the information recorder<br>
of Patent document 2, the electromagnetic motor<br>
includes a rotating part, and hence it is<br>
difficult to completely shield magnetism of the<br>
entire electromagnetic motor by surrounding the<br>
entire electromagnetic motor with the magnetic<br>
casing (high permeability material).<br>
Another problem with the information<br>
recorder disclosed in Patent Document 2 is that,<br>
if a large amount of high permeability material<br>
is used, the weight of the rotating unit is<br>
increased.<br>
Still another problem with the<br>
information recorder of Patent Document 2 is<br><br>
that, if a magnetic shield for the entire device<br>
is also provided, a magnetic field is generated<br>
in the direction of the electron beam<br>
irradiation axis in a magnetic shield opening of<br>
the irradiating unit and an opening of the<br>
magnetic casing of the rotating unit. The<br>
generated magnetic field affects the electron<br>
beam, which prevents accurate correction of a<br>
focal point and results in lowering of exposure<br>
quality.<br>
Referring to the electron beam<br>
irradiation device of Patent Document 3,<br>
according to the method of correcting the<br>
displacement of the electron beam focus spot on<br>
the master due to the variation of magnetic<br>
field and adjusting a focal point of the<br>
electron beam relative to a target object, as<br>
the plural magnetic detectors estimate a<br>
magnetic field in the vicinity of an irradiation<br>
point of the electron beam, a disturbance<br>
magnetic field of an electron beam injecting<br>
part cannot be accurately calculated.<br>
Accordingly, the electron beam irradiation<br>
device of Patent Document 3 cannot accurately<br>
correct the focal point, and therefore exposure<br><br>
quality is lowered.<br>
Further, according to Patent Document 3,<br>
for reasons of device configuration, the entire<br>
electron beam irradiation device needs to be<br>
magnetically shielded for eliminating influence<br>
of earth magnetism. However, since there are<br>
many constraints on workability and structure<br>
such as ventilation and air conditioning<br>
facility, this configuration is not so effective<br>
for variation of a magnetic field generated<br>
inside the shielded device. Furthermore, since<br>
the entire device is magnetically shielded, the<br>
electron beam irradiation device is large and<br>
expensive.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention aims to provide<br>
an electron beam recording apparatus capable of<br>
recording information by irradiating an electron<br>
beam onto a predetermined position of a sample<br>
with high positional accuracy.<br>
In one embodiment of the present<br>
invention, there is provided an electron beam<br>
recording apparatus that records information<br>
onto the surface of a sample by using an<br><br>
electron beam. The electron beam recording<br>
apparatus comprises an electron source that<br>
irradiates the electron beam, a magnetic<br>
detector that is configured to move onto and out<br>
of an irradiation axis and acquires magnetic<br>
information on the irradiation axis, a<br>
convergence position control part that<br>
calculates a convergence position correction<br>
amount for correcting a convergence position of<br>
the electron beam with respect to the surface of<br>
the sample based on the magnetic information<br>
acquired by the magnetic detector, and a<br>
convergence position adjusting part that adjusts<br>
the convergence position of the electron beam<br>
with respect to the surface of the sample. The<br>
convergence position control part causes the<br>
convergence position adjusting part to adjust<br>
the convergence position of the electron beam<br>
with respect to the surface of the sample based<br>
on the convergence position correction amount.<br>
According to an aspect of the present<br>
invention, the electron beam recording apparatus<br>
can perform the convergence position control of<br>
the electron beam with high accuracy by<br>
calculating a displacement of the convergence<br><br>
position of the electron beam with respect to<br>
the sample due to the magnetic field on the<br>
irradiation axis. Therefore, the electron beam<br>
is irradiated onto a predetermined position of<br>
the sample with high positional accuracy for<br>
recording the information. Moreover, since the<br>
electron beam is irradiated onto a predetermined<br>
position of the sample with high positional<br>
accuracy, printing on the surface of the sample<br>
can be performed with high shape accuracy.<br>
According to another aspect of the<br>
present invention, in the electron beam<br>
recording apparatus, since focal position<br>
displacement of the electron beam with respect<br>
to the sample due to the magnetic field on the<br>
irradiation axis is experimentally calculated<br>
based on focal position adjustment information<br>
obtained when a focal position is adjusted with<br>
respect to particles on the surface of a test<br>
substrate, focal position control of the<br>
electron beam can be performed with high<br>
accuracy. Therefore, the electron beam is<br>
irradiated onto a predetermined position of the<br>
sample with high positional accuracy for<br>
recording the information. Moreover, since the<br><br>
electron beam is irradiated onto a predetermined<br>
position of the sample with high positional<br>
accuracy, printing on the surface of the sample<br>
can be performed with high shape accuracy.<br>
Furthermore, since the displacement of the<br>
convergence position is experimentally computed<br>
using the test substrate with the particle on<br>
the surface, the electron beam recording<br>
apparatus is simple and inexpensive.<br>
According to still another aspect of<br>
the present invention, in the electron beam<br>
recording apparatus, since an irradiation<br>
position displacement of the electron beam with<br>
respect to the sample due to the magnetic field<br>
on the irradiation axis is experimentally<br>
calculated based on irradiation position<br>
adjustment information obtained when an<br>
irradiation position is adjusted with respect to<br>
particles on the surface of a test substrate,<br>
irradiation position control of the electron<br>
beam can be performed with high accuracy in<br>
addition to the focal position control of the<br>
electron beam. Therefore, the electron beam is<br>
irradiated onto a predetermined position of the<br>
sample with higher positional accuracy for<br><br>
recording the information. Moreover, since the<br>
electron beam is irradiated onto a predetermined<br>
position of the sample with higher positional<br>
accuracy, printing on the surface of the sample<br>
can be performed with higher shape accuracy.<br>
According to a further aspect of the<br>
present invention, since the convergence<br>
position adjusting part includes an<br>
electrostatic lens, the electron beam recording<br>
apparatus can perform convergence position<br>
adjustment (focal position) adjustment with high<br>
responsivity and can perform printing<br>
(recording) with high shape accuracy even when<br>
driven at high speed.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
In the following, an electron beam<br>
recording apparatus according to the present<br>
invention is described with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings. FIG. 1 is a schematic<br>
diagram showing an electron beam recording<br>
apparatus 10 according to a first embodiment of<br>
the present invention.<br>
The electron beam recording apparatus<br>
10 is used, for example, for producing an<br>
optical disk master by printing a pattern on a<br>
glass substrate.<br>
The electron beam recording apparatus<br>
10 includes a printing part 12, an electron beam<br>
generator 14, a host controller 20, a focal<br>
position control part 21, a feed control part 22,<br>
a position detecting part 23, a rotation control<br>
part 24, and a rotational angle detecting part<br>
25 .<br>
The host controller 20 is connected to<br>
and controls the focal position control part<br>
(convergence position control part) 21, the feed<br>
control part 22, and the rotation control part<br><br>
24.<br>
The host controller 20 is also<br>
connected to and controls, for example, an<br>
electron source 62 described below.<br>
The printing part 12 is disposed, for<br>
example, below the electron beam generator 14<br>
(the electron source 62), and is provided with,<br>
inside a vacuum chamber 30, a feed mechanism<br>
unit 32, a rotating mechanism unit 34, a<br>
magnetic detector 36, and a height sensor 38.<br>
The vacuum chamber 30 is arranged, for example,<br>
on a vibration isolation mechanism part (not<br>
shown) such as an air pressure servo mounter.<br>
The vacuum chamber 30 has an opening<br>
part 30a at the upper side thereof, to which the<br>
electron beam generator 14 (a tip end portion<br>
60a of a lens barrel 60) is connected.<br>
A magnetic shield plate 40 is disposed<br>
on the entire inner surface of the vacuum<br>
chamber 30. The magnetic shield plate 40 is made<br>
of a material of a high magnetic permeability<br>
such as permalloy so as to reduce disturbance<br>
due to such as the earth's magnetism.<br>
The feed mechanism unit 32 includes a<br>
drive motor 42, a base 43, a platform 44, a<br><br>
mobile body 45, a feed screw 46, and a position<br>
sensor 47.<br>
The base 43 is disposed on a bottom<br>
part 30b of the vacuum chamber 30 with the<br>
magnetic shield plate 40 interposed therebetween<br>
The platform 44 is arranged on the base 43. The<br>
mobile body 45 is disposed on the platform 44<br>
with, e.g., a rolling bearing (not shown) such<br>
as a sphere or a cylindrical roller arranged in<br>
the feed direction, interposed therebetween.<br>
A guide 47a is provided under the<br>
mobile body 45. A detector 47b is also provided,<br>
which constitutes the position sensor 47<br>
together with the guide 47a. While the guide 47a<br>
is provided on the mobile body 45, the detector<br>
47b is provided on the platform 44. The position<br>
sensor 47 is, e.g., a linear scale such as a<br>
laser scale.<br>
The position sensor 47 is connected to<br>
a position detecting part 23 so that the<br>
position sensor 47 outputs a detection signal<br>
representing the position of the mobile body 45<br>
(a sample S) to the position detecting part 23.<br>
The position detecting part 23 outputs a<br>
detection signal (position information of the<br><br>
sample S) to the focal position control part 21.<br>
The mobile body 45 has a receiving<br>
screw portion (not shown), into which the feed<br>
screw 46 is threaded. An end of the feed screw<br>
46 projecting outside the vacuum chamber 30 is<br>
connected to the drive motor 42 mounted outside<br>
the vacuum chamber 30. The feed screw 46<br>
includes a ball screw, for example.<br>
The drive motor 42 is connected to the<br>
feed control part 22. The feed control part 22<br>
controls rotation of the drive motor 42.<br>
The mobile body 45 is moved in the X<br>
direction by the rotation of the drive motor 42<br>
controlled by the feed control part 22. In the<br>
feed mechanism unit 32, the position sensor 47<br>
outputs the detection signal to the position<br>
detecting part 23 to provide current position<br>
information of the mobile body 45, and then the<br>
position detecting part 23 outputs the current<br>
position information of the mobile body 45 to<br>
the feed control part 22. The rotation of the<br>
drive motor 42 is controlled according to an<br>
output signal of the feed control part 22<br>
provided based on the current position<br>
information, so that the mobile body 45 is moved<br><br>
in the X direction. The feed mechanism unit 32<br>
is provided with the rotating mechanism unit 34.<br>
The rotating mechanism unit 34 includes<br>
an air spindle 50, an optical rotary encoder 51,<br>
a rotary drive motor 52, a turntable 53, and a<br>
magnetic fluid seal 54. The rotating mechanism<br>
unit 34 is moved together with the mobile body<br>
45 in the X direction. The sample S is placed on<br>
and rotated by the turntable 53.<br>
In the rotating mechanism unit 34, the<br>
air spindle 50 is fixed to the mobile body 45.<br>
The air spindle 50 is hydrostatically floated in<br>
the radial direction and the thrust direction by<br>
compressed air. The compressed air for the air<br>
spindle 50 is supplied from the outside of the<br>
vacuum chamber 30.<br>
The turntable 53 is provided over the<br>
air spindle 50. The rotary drive motor 52 is<br>
provided below the air spindle 50. The rotary<br>
drive motor 52 is connected to the rotation<br>
control part 24, by which rotation of the rotary<br>
drive motor 52 is controlled. The rotation<br>
control part 24 is connected to and controlled<br>
by the host controller 20.<br>
The optical rotary encoder 51 is fixed<br><br>
to the lower part of the rotary drive motor 52.<br>
The optical rotary encoder 51 generally outputs<br>
thousands of A phase pulses and B phase pulses<br>
per one turn and one Z phase pulse per one turn.<br>
The optical rotary encoder 51 is<br>
connected to the rotational angle detecting part<br>
25, which detects a rotational, angular position<br>
based on an output signal of the optical rotary<br>
encoder 51 and acquires rotational speed<br>
information. The rotational angle detecting part<br>
25 is connected to the rotation control part 24.<br>
The rotation control part 24 controls rotation<br>
of the rotary drive motor 52 based on the<br>
rotational speed information acquired by the<br>
rotational angle detecting part 25. Rotation of<br>
the rotary drive motor 52 causes rotation of the<br>
turntable 53. The turntable 53, together with<br>
the mobile body 45, is moved also in the X<br>
direction (in-plane) orthogonal to an<br>
irradiation axis C by the feed mechanism unit 32<br>
The irradiation axis C is a vertical<br>
line extending downward from the electron source<br>
62.<br>
The inside of the vacuum chamber 30 is<br>
evacuated to a vacuum. When the air spindle 50<br><br>
is provided in vacuum as described above, it is<br>
common to provide the magnetic fluid seal 54 on<br>
the outer periphery of the air spindle 50 for<br>
the purpose of vacuum seal. In addition to the<br>
magnetic fluid seal 54, a seal mechanism such as<br>
differential evacuation is generally provided on<br>
the outer periphery of the air spindle 50.<br>
The magnetic detector 36 is provided in<br>
the vacuum chamber 30. The magnetic detector 36<br>
can move onto and out of the irradiation axis C<br>
and acquire magnetic information on the<br>
irradiation axis C.<br>
The magnetic detector 36 is connected<br>
to a tip end of an arm 48b of a rotary shaft 48a<br>
extending in the vertical direction of a rotator<br>
48 provided on an upper face portion 30c of the<br>
vacuum chamber 30.<br>
The rotary shaft 48a of the rotator 48<br>
can be moved by air pressure. The magnetic<br>
detector 36 moves onto the irradiation axis C of<br>
an electron beam b only when performing<br>
measurement of magnetic fields and otherwise<br>
stays out of the irradiation axis C.<br>
The magnetic detector 36 is connected<br>
to the focal position control part 21, and<br><br>
outputs information of measured magnetic flux<br>
density (magnetic information) of each position<br>
of the mobile body 45 to the focal position<br>
control part 21.<br>
The magnetic detector 36 is able to<br>
acquire the magnetic flux density information<br>
(magnetic information) of three directions, i.e.,<br>
a focus direction in which a focal position is<br>
adjusted (hereinafter referred to as the Z<br>
direction), the X direction that is orthogonal<br>
to the Z direction and is the moving direction<br>
of the mobile body 45, and the Y direction<br>
orthogonal to the Z direction and the X<br>
direction. The magnetic detector 36 is not<br>
limited to specific sensors and may be any<br>
sensor well known in the art.<br>
The magnetic detector 36 is not limited<br>
to the one capable of measuring magnetic flux<br>
density in three directions (the X, Y, and Z<br>
directions). In this embodiment, as described<br>
below, the magnetic detector 36 is for<br>
controlling the focal position of the electron<br>
beam b in the Z direction, and may be any<br>
detector capable of acquiring magnetic flux<br>
density information (magnetic information) at<br><br>
least in the Z direction.<br>
The height sensor 38 is provided on the<br>
upper face portion 30c of the vacuum chamber 30.<br>
The height sensor 38 detects the surface height<br>
of the sample S or the height displacement of<br>
the sample S when the sample S is rotated or<br>
moved, and is based on laser triangulation.<br>
The surface height of the sample S<br>
indicates, e.g., a distance from the surface of<br>
the turntable 53 as a datum plane in the Z<br>
direction. The height displacement of the sample<br>
S indicates, e.g., a displacement amount from<br>
the surface of the turntable 53 as a datum plane<br>
in the Z direction.<br>
The height sensor 38 includes a light<br>
emitting part 38a and a light receiving part 38b<br>
The light emitting part 38a emits, e.g.,<br>
a semiconductor laser beam (not shown). The<br>
light receiving part 38b receives a reflection<br>
light of the laser beam emitted by the light<br>
emitting part 38a and reflected by the surface<br>
of the sample S, and calculates the height of<br>
the sample S (height displacement of the sample<br>
S) based on the position where the reflection<br>
light is received. The light receiving part 38b<br><br>
includes a position sensitive detector (PSD)<br>
(not shown) and an arithmetic part (not shown).<br>
The light receiving part 38b is<br>
connected to the focal position control part 21<br>
so as to output the height calculated by the<br>
height sensor 38 as an output signal (height<br>
information) to the focal position control part<br>
21.<br>
The following describes the electron<br>
beam generator 14.<br>
The electron beam generator 14<br>
irradiates an electron beam b onto the surface<br>
of the sample S so as to record information on<br>
the surface of the sample S.<br>
The electron beam generator 14 includes<br>
various component parts in the lens barrel 60.<br>
The lens barrel 60 includes the conically-shaped<br>
tip end portion 60a having an open tip end. The<br>
lens barrel 60 also includes a closed rear end<br>
portion 60b.<br>
In the electron beam generator 14, the<br>
lens barrel 60 accommodates therein the electron<br>
source 62, a blanking electrode 64, an axis<br>
alignment coil 66, a focusing lens 68, a<br>
selector aperture 70, an astigmatism correction<br><br>
coil 72, an electrostatic deflection electrode<br>
(convergence position adjusting part) 74, an<br>
objective lens 76, and an electrostatic lens<br>
(convergence position adjusting part) 78, in<br>
this order from the rear end portion 60b. The<br>
tip end portion 60a of the lens barrel 60 is<br>
connected to the opening part 30a of the vacuum<br>
chamber 30.<br>
A magnetic shield plate 41 is disposed<br>
on the outer periphery of the tip end portion<br>
60a of the lens barrel 60 in order to reduce<br>
disturbance due to such as the earth's magnetism,<br>
The magnetic shield plate 41 is made of a<br>
material of a high magnetic permeability such as<br>
permalloy.<br>
In the electron beam generator 14, the<br>
electron source (electron gun) 62 is of a<br>
thermal field irradiation type, and is arranged<br>
in an ultrahigh vacuum. The electron source 62<br>
irradiates the electron beam b toward the<br>
turntable 53.<br>
The irradiation of the electron beam b<br>
by the electron source 62 is controlled by the<br>
host controller 20.<br>
The electron beam b irradiated by the<br><br>
thermal field irradiation type electron source<br>
62 has a small diameter of about 20 through 50<br>
nm. Therefore, in terms of obtaining the<br>
electron beam b with a small diameter, there is<br>
no need to reduce the diameter of the electron<br>
beam b focused on the surface of the sample S at<br>
a high reduction ratio relative to the diameter<br>
of the electron beam b irradiated by the<br>
electron source 62.<br>
The blanking electrode 64 is used for<br>
controlling irradiation (ON/OFF) of the electron<br>
beam b onto the sample S in synchronization with<br>
scanning of the electron beam b when forming a<br>
printing pattern. More specifically, when the<br>
electron beam b is not deflected by the blanking<br>
electrode 64, the electron beam b is irradiated<br>
onto the surface of the sample S (ON). On the<br>
other hand, when the electron beam b is<br>
deflected by the blanking electrode 64, the<br>
electron beam b is not irradiated onto the<br>
surface of the sample S (OFF).<br>
The blanking electrode 64 is connected<br>
to a blanking drive circuit 26. The blanking<br>
drive circuit 26 receives a printing blanking<br>
signal corresponding to the printing pattern to<br><br>
be printed on the surface of the sample S from<br>
the host controller 20, and outputs a control<br>
signal so as to control the irradiation of the<br>
electron beam b to the sample S.<br>
The axis alignment coil 66 is disposed<br>
under the blanking electrode 64. The axis<br>
alignment coil 66 corrects an axial displacement<br>
of the electron beam b to be incident on the<br>
focusing lens 68.<br>
The focusing lens 68 is a magnetic lens<br>
(electromagnetic lens) that focuses the electron<br>
beam b, of which axial displacement is corrected<br>
by the axis alignment coil 66, onto a crossover<br>
point CP. The objective lens 76 is a magnetic<br>
lens that focuses the electron beam b, which is<br>
focused on the crossover point CP by the<br>
focusing lens 68, onto the surface of the sample<br>
S. The focusing lens 68 and the objective lens<br>
76 are arranged under the axis alignment coil 66<br>
in this order.<br>
The selector aperture 70 controls ON<br>
(writing)/OFF (stop writing) of the electron<br>
beam b based on information to be written during<br>
information writing process. More specifically,<br>
when the electron beam b is not deflected by the<br><br>
blanking electrode 64, the electron beam b<br>
passes through an opening 70a of the selector<br>
aperture 70 so as to be incident on the surface<br>
of the sample S (ON). On the other hand, when<br>
the electron beam b is deflected by the blanking<br>
electrode 64, the electron beam b is shielded by<br>
the selector aperture 70 (OFF).<br>
The astigmatism correction coil 72<br>
corrects astigmatism of the electron beam b and<br>
is arranged under the selector aperture 70.<br>
The electrostatic deflection electrode<br>
74 adjusts the irradiation position of the<br>
electron beam b in at least one of two<br>
directions (the X direction and the Y direction)<br>
orthogonal to a direction (the Z direction) in<br>
which the irradiation axis C extends. The<br>
electrostatic deflection electrode 74 is able to<br>
adjust the convergence position, especially the<br>
irradiation position.<br>
The electrostatic deflection electrode<br>
74 deflects the electron beam based on the<br>
information to be written during an information<br>
writing process so as to control the irradiation<br>
(spot) position of the electron beam b on the<br>
surface of the sample S. The electrostatic<br><br>
deflection electrode 74 is interposed between<br>
the astigmatism correction coil 72 and the<br>
objective lens 76.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, the electrostatic<br>
deflection electrode 74 includes a pair of first<br>
deflection electrode plates 74a facing each<br>
other in the X direction and a pair of second<br>
deflection electrode plates 74b facing each<br>
other in the Y direction. Each of the pair of<br>
the first deflection electrode plates 74a and<br>
the pair of the second deflection electrode<br>
plates 74b is connected to the host controller<br>
20.<br>
In this embodiment, for deflecting the<br>
electron beam b in the X direction, the host<br>
controller 20 applies a voltage corresponding to<br>
the amount of deflection to the pair of the<br>
first deflection electrode plates 74a. Thus the<br>
position of the electron beam b to be irradiated<br>
onto the sample S in the X direction is adjusted<br>
For deflecting the electron beam b in the Y<br>
direction, the host controller 20 applies a<br>
voltage corresponding to the amount of<br>
deflection to the pair of the second deflection<br>
electrode plates 74b. Thus the position of the<br><br>
electron beam b to be irradiated onto the sample<br>
S in the X direction is adjusted. In this way,<br>
the host controller 20 controls the deflection<br>
direction and deflection amount of the electron<br>
beam b.<br>
The electrostatic lens (convergence<br>
position adjusting part) 78 adjusts the<br>
convergence position, especially adjusts the<br>
focal position of the electron beam b to meet<br>
the surface of the sample S. The electrostatic<br>
lens 78 is provided with a focus control part<br>
(not shown) for changing a focal length. The<br>
focus control part is capable of changing the<br>
focal length of the electrostatic lens 78 as<br>
desired.<br>
The focus control part is connected to<br>
the focal position control part 21. The focal<br>
length of the electrostatic lens 78 is<br>
controlled by an output signal from (a voltage<br>
applied from) the focal position control part 21,<br>
so that the focal position of the electron beam<br>
b relative to the surface of the sample S is<br>
adjusted.<br>
As the electrostatic lens 78 converges<br>
the electron beam b by electric field force, the<br><br>
responsiveness of the electrostatic lens 78 is<br>
higher than that of a magnetic lens that<br>
converges the electron beam b by magnetic field<br>
force.<br>
In the electron beam generator 14 of<br>
this embodiment, the electron source 62 emits<br>
the electron beam b. After the axis alignment<br>
coil 66 corrects the axial displacement of the<br>
electron beam b, the focusing lens 68 focuses<br>
the electron beam b onto the crossover point CP.<br>
Then, the electron beam b passes through the<br>
opening 70a of the selector aperture 70. After<br>
that, the astigmatism correction coil 72<br>
corrects astigmatism, and the objective lens 76<br>
and the electrostatic lens 78 corrects the focal<br>
point. Thus the electron beam b is focused onto<br>
the surface of the sample S.<br>
In the electron beam generator 14 of<br>
this embodiment, when writing information, the<br>
electron beam b irradiated from the electron<br>
source 62 is controlled ON and OFF by the<br>
blanking electrode 64 and the selector aperture<br>
70 through the blanking drive circuit 26. The<br>
electron beam b that has passed through the<br>
opening 70a of the selector aperture 70 to be<br><br>
incident on the objective lens 76 is deflected<br>
by the electrostatic deflection electrode 74 in<br>
the X direction or the Y direction according to<br>
the information to be written. Thus, the spot<br>
position on the surface of the sample S is<br>
controlled. That is, the electron beam b scans<br>
on the surface (the X-Y plane) of the sample S<br>
to write information on predetermined positions<br>
of the surface of the sample S.<br>
The following describes the<br>
configuration of the focal position control part<br>
21. The focal position control part 21<br>
calculates a correction voltage (correction<br>
amount) for controlling the focal position of<br>
the electron beam b according to the position of<br>
the mobile body 45 (turntable 53) detected by<br>
the position sensor 47 and the magnetic flux<br>
density information (magnetic information) on<br>
each position of the mobile body 45 acquired by<br>
the magnetic detector 36. Based on this<br>
correction voltage, the focal position control<br>
part 21 causes the electrostatic lens 78 to<br>
adjust the focal position of the electron beam b<br>
to an appropriate position.<br>
FIG. 3 is a block diagram showing a<br><br>
structure of the focal position control part 21<br>
according to the present embodiment.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, the focal position<br>
control part 21 includes a CPU 80, a ROM 81 with<br>
a program written therein for computing a<br>
convergence position characteristic arithmetic<br>
expression, a RAM 82, a magnetic flux density<br>
measuring circuit 83, a D/A converter circuit 85,<br>
an adder 86, an amplifier 87, and a drive<br>
circuit 88.<br>
The CPU 80 is connected through a bus<br>
to the ROM 81, the RAM 82, the magnetic flux<br>
density measuring circuit 83, the D/A converter<br>
circuit 85, the host controller 20, and the<br>
position detecting part 23 (position sensor 47).<br>
The CPU 80 reads out the computation<br>
program for a convergence position<br>
characteristic arithmetic expression from the<br>
ROM 81, and computes a convergence position<br>
characteristic arithmetic expression according<br>
to the output signal of the position detecting<br>
part 23 (position sensor 47) and the magnetic<br>
flux density information of each position of the<br>
mobile body 45 by using the computation program<br>
for a convergence position characteristic<br><br>
arithmetic expression. The convergence position<br>
characteristic arithmetic expression is a high-<br>
order polynomial such as, e.g., a quintic<br>
function. The CPU 80 calculates coefficients of<br>
the high-order polynomial.<br>
The magnetic flux density measuring<br>
circuit 83 measures the magnetic flux density in,<br>
e.g., the Z direction based on the output signal<br>
of the magnetic detector 36.<br>
The RAM 82 holds the coefficients of<br>
the convergence position characteristic<br>
arithmetic expression (high-order polynomial)<br>
calculated by the CPU 80.<br>
The D/A converter circuit 85 converts<br>
digital applied voltage data for the<br>
electrostatic lens 78, which is calculated by<br>
the CPU 80, into analog voltage data.<br>
In the focal position control part 21,<br>
the D/A converter circuit 85 is connected to the<br>
adder 86. The adder 86 is connected to the<br>
amplifier 87, and the amplifier 87 is connected<br>
to the drive circuit 88.<br>
The adder 86 adds the analog voltage<br>
data (output signal) of the D/A converter<br>
circuit 85 to the output signal of the height<br><br>
sensor 38 representing the surface height of the<br>
sample S, and outputs an addition signal.<br>
The amplifier 87 amplifies, with a<br>
predetermined amplification factor, the addition<br>
signal of the adder 86 to the level necessary<br>
for the electrostatic lens 78. The drive circuit<br>
88 is connected to the electrostatic lens 78.<br>
The focal length of the electrostatic lens 78 is<br>
changed by an output signal (correction voltage)<br>
of the drive circuit 88, so that the focal point<br>
of the electrostatic lens 7 8 is adjusted to<br>
focus the electron beam b onto the surface of<br>
the sample S.<br>
The following describes a method of<br>
controlling the focal point of the electron beam<br>
b in the electron beam generator 14. First, with<br>
reference to FIG. 4, the focal position of the<br>
electron beam b affected by a magnetic field Bz<br>
is described.<br>
FIG. 4 shows an electron beam flow of a<br>
convergence half angle 9 relative to a Z axis<br>
representing the focus direction (the Z<br>
direction). An electron e with a velocity of V<br>
starts rotating about the Z axis in response to<br>
Lorentz force due to a velocity component VR and<br><br>
a magnetic field Bz. As the velocity component<br>
VR is proportional to the convergence half angle<br>
9 (9
distance r from the Z axis. The rotating<br>
electron e receives a force in a direction<br>
perpendicular to the Z axis due to the magnetic<br>
field Bz, so that a 50 orbital is bent. The 56<br>
is proportional to the electron beam diameter R<br>
and converges onto a convergence point Zc. A<br>
convergence point ZD of the entire electron beam<br>
flow is uniformly displaced by a displacement<br>
amount 5Z in the focus direction (the Z<br>
direction).<br>
Accordingly, if the magnitude of the<br>
electric field, i.e., the magnetic flux density<br>
is known, the displace amount 5Z in each<br>
position can be calculated by integrating in the<br>
radial direction and the Z direction.<br>
The following describes correction of<br>
the displacement amount of the convergence point<br>
of the electron beam b.<br>
FIG. 5 is a graph showing a<br>
characteristic curve of magnetic flux density in<br>
the Z direction with respect to mobile body<br>
position, where the vertical axis represents the<br><br>
magnetic flux density in the Z direction and the<br>
horizontal axis represents the mobile body<br>
position. The curve shown in FIG. 5 representing<br>
the Z-direction magnetic flux density in each<br>
position of the mobile body 45 is referred to as<br>
a characteristic curve.<br>
The mobile body position indicates the<br>
position of the turntable 5 3 in the X direction<br>
with reference to the position of the rotational<br>
center of the turntable 53 (rotating mechanism<br>
unit 34) on which the electron beam b is<br>
irradiated when not affected by a magnetic field<br>
(i.e., X=0 mm).<br>
In this embodiment, the magnetic flux<br>
density of the characteristic curve shown in FIG<br>
5 is integrated in the radial direction and the<br>
Z direction, thereby calculating the correction<br>
voltage to the electrostatic lens 78 for each<br>
position of the mobile body 45 as shown in FIG.<br>
6. This correction voltage is to be applied from<br>
the drive circuit 88 to the electrostatic lens<br>
78 .<br>
It is to be noted that, in this<br>
embodiment, for calculation of the correction<br>
voltage (voltage to be applied to the<br><br>
electrostatic lens 78) by the focal position<br>
control part 21, height detection sensitivity of<br>
the height sensor 38 shown in FIG. 7 and<br>
sensitivity of the electrostatic lens 78 shown<br>
in FIG. 8 are measured in advance.<br>
Further, in this embodiment, because<br>
the influence of the magnetic field varies<br>
depending on the position of the mobile body 45,<br>
the correction voltage needs to be changed<br>
depending on the position of the mobile body 45.<br>
Therefore, the focal position control part 21<br>
successively calculates the correction voltage<br>
based on the mobile body position information.<br>
For example, the RAM 82 holds<br>
coefficients of polynomial approximation (a<br>
function of the mobile body position) by which<br>
the characteristic shown in FIG. 6 is<br>
approximated. With the polynomial approximation,<br>
a correction voltage corresponding to the<br>
present mobile position information is<br>
calculated. The calculation of the correction<br>
voltage is performed by the CPU 80 by reading<br>
out coefficient data of the coefficients from<br>
the RAM 82 according to the calculation program<br>
read out from the ROM 81 and using output data<br><br>
of the position detecting part 23. The<br>
calculation result is output to the D/A<br>
converter circuit 85. If the amplification<br>
factor of the amplifier 87 is 1, the correction<br>
voltage shown in FIG. 6 is output from the D/A<br>
converter circuit 85 to the amplifier 87. If the<br>
amplification factor of the amplifier 87 is 10,<br>
1/10 of the correction voltage shown in FIG. 6<br>
is output from the D/A converter circuit 85 to<br>
the amplifier 87.<br>
In the electron beam generator 14 of<br>
the electron beam recording apparatus 10 of this<br>
embodiment, when the amount of a current of the<br>
electron source 62 required for recording into<br>
(printing onto) the sample S is determined, the<br>
magnetic detector 36 is moved to the vicinity of<br>
a work distance position on the irradiation axis<br>
C of the electron beam b before recording is<br>
performed. Thus, the magnetic detector 36<br>
measures magnetic flux density in the Z<br>
direction of each mobile body position so as to<br>
compute the convergence position characteristic<br>
(see FIG. 6).<br>
When recording (printing) is performed,<br>
the adder 86 adds the output signal<br><br>
corresponding to the amount of focal position<br>
displacement due to the magnetic field to the<br>
output signal of the height sensor 38, and a<br>
voltage is applied through the amplifier 87 and<br>
the drive circuit 88 to the electrostatic lens<br>
78. Thus the electrostatic lens 78 controls the<br>
focal point of the electron beam b. In this<br>
focal control of the electron beam b, since<br>
influence of the magnetic field is reduced, the<br>
electric beam b can be irradiated onto a<br>
predetermined position of the sample S with high<br>
focal position accuracy so as to record<br>
information. Moreover, due to high focal<br>
position accuracy of the electron beam b, the<br>
printing pattern can be recorded on the sample S<br>
with high shape accuracy.<br>
A second embodiment of the present<br>
invention is described below.<br>
FIG. 9 is a schematic diagram showing<br>
an electron beam recording apparatus 10a<br>
according to the second embodiment of the<br>
present invention. FIG. 10 is a block diagram<br>
showing a structure of an irradiation position<br>
control part 100 of the electron beam recording<br>
apparatus 10a according to the second embodiment<br><br>
of the present invention. FIG. 11 is a schematic<br>
diagram showing a structure of an electrostatic<br>
deflection electrode 74 of the electron beam<br>
recording apparatus according to the second<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Component<br>
parts of the electron beam recording apparatus<br>
10a identical to those of the electron beam<br>
recording apparatus 10 of the first embodiment<br>
of the present invention shown in FIGS. 1<br>
through 8 are denoted by the same reference<br>
numerals and are not described in detail.<br>
The electron beam recording apparatus<br>
10a of the second embodiment is different from<br>
the electron beam recording apparatus 10 (see<br>
FIG. 1) of the first embodiment in being able to<br>
adjust the irradiation position (convergence<br>
position) of the electron beam b in the X<br>
direction and the Y direction in addition to<br>
being able to adjust the focal position<br>
(convergence position) of the electron beam b.<br>
The electron beam recording apparatus<br>
10a of this embodiment has a function of<br>
adjusting displacement of the irradiation<br>
position in the X direction and the Y direction<br>
in addition to the function of the electron beam<br><br>
recording apparatus 10 of the first embodiment<br>
of correcting the displacement of the focal<br>
position (defocus).<br>
The inventor of this invention has<br>
found that the focal position displacement and<br>
the irradiation position displacement in the X<br>
direction and the Y direction occur<br>
independently from each other, and that the<br>
focal position displacement and the irradiation<br>
position displacement can be corrected without<br>
being affected by each other even if the<br>
corrections are separately conducted.<br>
Accordingly, correction of the focal position<br>
displacement and correction of the irradiation<br>
position displacement may be performed in any<br>
order.<br>
Referring to FIG. 9, the electron beam<br>
recording apparatus 10a of the second embodiment<br>
is different from the electron beam recording<br>
apparatus 10 (see FIG. 1) of the first<br>
embodiment also in having a secondary electron<br>
detector 49 in the vacuum chamber 30, an image<br>
retrieving part 27 for forming an image based on<br>
a signal output from the secondary electron<br>
detector 49 when the electron beam b scans on<br><br>
the X-Y plane, an image processing part 28 for<br>
processing the image formed by the image<br>
retrieving part 27, a display part for<br>
displaying an image, and the irradiation<br>
position control part (convergence position<br>
control part) 100 for controlling the<br>
irradiation position of the electron beam b.<br>
Except for these differences, the configuration<br>
of the electron beam recording apparatus 10a is<br>
the same as the configuration of the electron<br>
beam recording apparatus 10 (see FIG. 1) of the<br>
first embodiment, and is not described in detail<br>
The irradiation position control part<br>
100 of the electron beam recording apparatus 10a<br>
of this embodiment calculates a correction<br>
amount for correcting the irradiation position<br>
of the electron beam b in at least one of the X<br>
direction and the Y direction that are<br>
orthogonal to each other, calculates a<br>
correction voltage (correction amount) for<br>
controlling the irradiation position of at least<br>
one of the X direction and the Y direction, and<br>
adjusting the irradiation position of the<br>
electron beam b on the surface of the sample S<br>
using the electrostatic deflection electrode 74<br><br>
in at least one of the X direction and the Y<br>
direction.<br>
The irradiation control part 100 is<br>
able to correct the irradiation position when<br>
the host controller 20 performs scanning of the<br>
electron beam b on the surface of the sample S<br>
in the X-Y plane.<br>
The secondary electron detector 49<br>
detects secondary electrons generated when the<br>
electron beam b scans on the surface of the<br>
sample S in the X-Y plane.<br>
The image retrieving part 27 forms a<br>
secondary electron reflection image based on the<br>
detection result of the secondary electrons by<br>
the secondary electron detector 49.<br>
In the electron beam recording<br>
apparatus 10a of this embodiment, the host<br>
controller 20 scans the electron beam b on the<br>
surface of the sample S in the X-Y plane. The<br>
secondary electron detector 49 detects the<br>
secondary electrons generated when the scanning<br>
is performed. The image retrieving part 27 forms<br>
the secondary electron reflection image. Then,<br>
the display part 29 displays the secondary<br>
electron reflection image.<br><br>
The image processing part 28 has a<br>
length measuring function of measuring the<br>
distance of a subject of the secondary electron<br>
reflection image displayed on the display part<br>
29 .<br>
The image processing part 28 executes<br>
image processing and calculates, as described<br>
below, a displacement amount of the convergence<br>
point and a displacement amount of the<br>
irradiation position in the X direction and the<br>
Y direction. Image processing results (the<br>
displacement amount of the convergence point and<br>
the displacement amount of the irradiation<br>
position in the X and Y directions) of the image<br>
processing part 28 can be output to the display<br>
part 29 so as to be displayed thereon.<br>
The image processing result (the<br>
displacement amount of the convergence point) of<br>
the image processing part 28 is output to the<br>
focal position control part 21, as described<br>
below, so that a correction amount is calculated<br>
so as to relocate the focal position for<br>
achieving accurate focus.<br>
The image processing result (the<br>
irradiation position displacement amount) of the<br><br>
image processing part 28 is output to the<br>
irradiation position control part 100, as<br>
described below, so that a correction amount is<br>
calculated so as to locate the irradiation<br>
position to an appropriate position.<br>
The irradiation position control part<br>
100 calculates a correction voltage for<br>
controlling the irradiation position of the<br>
electron beam b according to the position of the<br>
mobile body 45 (turntable 53) detected by the<br>
position sensor 47 and the X-direction magnetic<br>
flux density information (magnetic information)<br>
and the Y-direction magnetic flux density<br>
information (magnetic information) on each<br>
position of the mobile body 45 acquired by the<br>
magnetic detector 36. The irradiation position<br>
control part 100 adds this correction voltage to<br>
a voltage to be applied for deflection from the<br>
host controller 20 so as to adjust the<br>
irradiation position of the electron beam b to<br>
an appropriate position.<br>
Referring to FIG. 10, the irradiation<br>
position control part 100 is different from the<br>
focal position control part 21 (see FIG. 3) in<br>
not being connected to the height sensor 38, not<br><br>
having the adder 86, and having a ROM 81a with a<br>
program written thereon for computing an<br>
irradiation position characteristic arithmetic<br>
expression. Except for these differences, the<br>
configuration of the irradiation position<br>
control part 100 is generally the same as the<br>
configuration of the focal position control part<br>
21 .<br>
In the irradiation position control<br>
part 100, as in the focal position control part<br>
21, a CPU 80a is connected through a bus to the<br>
ROM 81a, a RAM 82a, a magnetic flux density<br>
measuring circuit 83a, a D/A converter circuit<br>
85a, the position detecting part 23 (position<br>
sensor 47), and the image processing part 28.<br>
The CPU 80a reads out the computation<br>
program for an irradiation position<br>
characteristic arithmetic expression from the<br>
ROM 81a, and computes an irradiation position<br>
characteristic arithmetic expression according<br>
to the output signal of the position detecting<br>
part 23 (position sensor 47) and the magnetic<br>
flux density information of each position of the<br>
mobile body 45 in the X direction and the Y<br>
direction by using the computation program for<br><br>
an irradiation position characteristic<br>
arithmetic expression. The irradiation position<br>
characteristic arithmetic expression is a high-<br>
order polynomial such as, e.g., a quintic<br>
function. The CPU 80a calculates coefficients of<br>
the high-order polynomial.<br>
The magnetic flux density measuring<br>
circuit 83a measures, e.g., magnetic flux<br>
density in the Z direction and magnetic flux<br>
density in the Y direction based on the output<br>
signal of the magnetic detector 36.<br>
The RAM 82a holds the coefficients of<br>
the irradiation position characteristic<br>
arithmetic expression (high-order polynomial)<br>
calculated by the CPU 80a.<br>
Further, a correction digital voltage<br>
to be applied to the electrostatic deflection<br>
electrode 74 (a pair of first deflection<br>
electrode plates 74a and a pair of second<br>
deflection electrode plates 74b) necessary for<br>
correcting the irradiation position calculated<br>
by the CPU 80a is converted to a predetermined<br>
analog correction voltage by the D/A converter<br>
circuit 8 5a.<br>
In the irradiation position control<br><br>
part 100, the D/A converter circuit 85a is<br>
connected to the amplifier 87a. The amplifier<br>
87a is connected to a drive circuit 88a.<br>
The amplifier 87a amplifies, with a<br>
predetermined amplification factor, the<br>
correction voltage (analog voltage) to the level<br>
required by the electrostatic deflection<br>
electrode 7 4.<br>
The drive circuit 88a is connected to<br>
the electrostatic deflection electrode 74. An<br>
output signal (correction voltage) of the drive<br>
circuit 88a changes the irradiation position of<br>
the electron beam b of the electrostatic<br>
deflection electrode 74, so that the irradiation<br>
position of the electron beam b is adjusted.<br>
Thus the electron beam b is focused onto a<br>
predetermined irradiation position on the<br>
surface of the sample S if not affected by a<br>
magnetic field.<br>
In the electron beam recording<br>
apparatus 10a of this embodiment, when the host<br>
controller 20 deflects the electron beam b, the<br>
irradiation position control part 100 corrects<br>
the irradiation position. As for the focal<br>
position, the focal position control part 21<br><br>
controls the focal position so as to focus the<br>
electron beam b onto the surface of the sample S<br>
as in the first embodiment.<br>
The following describes a focal<br>
position controlling method of the electron beam<br>
recording apparatus 10a of this embodiment.<br>
The focal position controlling method<br>
of the electron beam recording apparatus 10a of<br>
this embodiment is different from that of the<br>
electron beam recording apparatus 10 of the<br>
first embodiment only in inspecting for focal<br>
position displacement using naked eyes and is<br>
not described in detail.<br>
FIG. 12A is a side elevational view<br>
schematically showing a test substrate 90, and<br>
the FIG. 12B is a plan view schematically<br>
showing the test substrate 90 of FIG. 12A. FIG.<br>
13 is a graph showing a convergence position<br>
characteristic of the electron beam b with<br>
respect to the position of the mobile body 45,<br>
where the vertical axis represents the<br>
convergence position and the horizontal axis<br>
represents the mobile body position.<br>
With reference to FIGS. 12A and 12B,<br>
according to the focal position controlling<br><br>
method of the electron beam recording apparatus<br>
10a of this embodiment, the test substrate 90<br>
that is used has a tabular base 92 on which<br>
particles 94, such as e.g., gold particles and<br>
latex spheres, with diameters of about tens of<br>
nanometers thorough hundreds of nanometers are<br>
supplied.<br>
According to the focal position<br>
controlling method of the electron beam<br>
recording apparatus 10a of this embodiment, the<br>
host controller 20 scans the electron beam b on<br>
the surface of the test substrate 90 in the X-Y<br>
plane by using the electrostatic deflection<br>
electrode 74. The secondary electron detector 49<br>
detects the secondary electrons generated when<br>
the scanning is performed. The image retrieving<br>
part 27 forms a secondary electron reflection<br>
image based on the detection result of the<br>
secondary electron detector 49. Then, the<br>
display part 29 displays the secondary electron<br>
reflection image. The focal position<br>
displacement (defocus) due to the magnetic field<br>
on each position of the turntable 53 (the<br>
rotating mechanism unit 34) is inspected with<br>
naked eyes using the secondary electron<br><br>
reflection image displayed on the display part<br>
29, and the focal position is adjusted for<br>
achieving accurate focus by manually applying a<br>
voltage to the electrostatic lens 78. The<br>
voltage applied for achieving accurate focus is<br>
obtained as focal position adjustment<br>
information (defocus amount). Then, a<br>
convergence position characteristic of the<br>
electron beam b shown in FIG. 13 is computed.<br>
The focal position control part 21 calculates a<br>
correction voltage based on the convergence<br>
position characteristic of the electron beam b.<br>
Based on the correction voltage, the focal<br>
length of the electrostatic lens 78 is adjusted,<br>
so that the focal position of the electron beam<br>
b relative to the surface of the sample S is<br>
adjusted. Thus, the focal position of the<br>
electron beam b is relocated to an appropriate<br>
pos ition.<br>
In the electron beam recording<br>
apparatus 10a of this embodiment, the turntable<br>
5 3 is moved to a position of X=0 mm, and the<br>
focus of the electron beam b is adjusted to the<br>
part icles 9 4.<br>
Then, a convergence position, i.e., a<br><br>
defocus amount (the voltage applied for<br>
achieving accurate focus) of each particle 94 on<br>
the surface of the base 92 is calculated. An<br>
approximate expression is computed using the<br>
calculated defocus amounts and then written into<br>
the ROM 81 as a program.<br>
According to the electron beam<br>
recording apparatus 10a of this embodiment, it<br>
is preferable that the ROM 81 of the focal<br>
position control part 21 be a flash ROM or the<br>
like so that coefficient data of the convergence<br>
position characteristic computed by calculating<br>
the defocus amount be written at the time of,<br>
for example, recording (exposure) onto the<br>
sample S. The focal position control part 21 may<br>
have an input part so that the coefficients of<br>
the approximate expression are input by the<br>
input part .<br>
The following describes a method of<br>
controlling the irradiation position of the<br>
electron beam b in the electron beam irradiation<br>
device 14 of the electron beam recording<br>
apparatus 10a of this embodiment.<br>
First, with reference to FIG. 14,<br>
displacement of the irradiation position of the<br><br>
electron beam b affected by a magnetic field B<br>
i s described.<br>
Referring to FIG. 14, an electron e<br>
with a mass m accelerated at an accelerating<br>
voltage Va passes through a deflection magnetic<br>
field area with a magnetic flux density B. In<br>
this case, the expression R=(2m•Va/e)1/2x1/B is<br>
satisfied, where R represents cyclotron radius.<br>
The electron e is deviated from the Z<br>
axis by a displacement amount 5S when moved a<br>
distance δZ1 from a position Zo to a position Zp<br>
The relationship between the distance<br>
δZ1 and the displacement amount 5S is<br>
represented by the following expression<br>
according to a geometric relationship:<br>
5S=(δZ1)2/2R.<br>
Based on the cyclotron radius R and the<br>
relationship between δZ1 and the displacement<br>
amount 5S, the displacement amount 6S is<br>
represented by the following expression:<br>
δS=((δZ1) 2xB)/(2.(2m.Va/e)1/2).<br>
Accordingly, if the magnetic flux<br>
density distribution is known, the displacement<br>
amount 5S of the irradiation position of the<br>
electron beam b is determined by integrating in<br><br>
the Z direction.<br>
The following describes correction of<br>
the displacement amount of the irradiation<br>
position of the electron beam b.<br>
FIG. 15 is a graph showing a<br>
characteristic curve of magnetic flux density in<br>
the X direction and the Y direction with respect<br>
to mobile body position, where the vertical axis<br>
represents the magnetic flux density in the X<br>
direction and the Y direction and the horizontal<br>
axis represents the mobile body position. In FIG<br>
15, a curve representing the X-direction<br>
magnetic flux density on each position of the<br>
mobile body 45 is referred to as a<br>
characteristic curve D1, and a curve<br>
representing the Y-direction magnetic flux<br>
density is referred to as a characteristic curve<br>
D2.<br>
The mobile body position indicates the<br>
position of the turntable 53 in the X direction<br>
with reference to the position of the rotational<br>
center of the turntable 5 3 (rotating mechanism<br>
unit 34) on which the electron beam b is<br>
irradiated (i.e., X=0 mm).<br>
In this embodiment, the magnetic flux<br><br>
densities of the characteristic curves D1 and D2<br>
shown in FIG. 15 are integrated in the Z<br>
direction, thereby calculating the correction<br>
voltage to the electrostatic deflection<br>
electrode 74 for each position of the mobile<br>
body 45 as shown in FIG. 16. This correction<br>
voltage is to be applied from the drive circuit<br>
88a to the electrostatic deflection electrode 74<br>
It is to be noted that the turntable 53 is<br>
stopped when calculating the correction voltage<br>
for the irradiation position.<br>
In this embodiment, for calculation of<br>
the correction voltage (the voltage to be<br>
applied to the electrostatic deflection<br>
electrode 74 (the first deflection electrode<br>
plates 74a and the second deflection electrode<br>
plates 74b)) by the irradiation position control<br>
part 100, sensitivity of the electrostatic<br>
deflection electrode 74 (the first deflection<br>
electrode plates 74a and the second deflection<br>
electrode plates 74b) is measured in advance. In<br>
this embodiment, the sensitivity of the<br>
electrostatic deflection electrode 74 (the first<br>
deflection electrode plates 74a and the second<br>
deflection electrode plates 74b) is, e.g., in a<br><br>
range of 1 through 5 um/V.<br>
Further, in this embodiment, because<br>
the influence of the magnetic field on the<br>
displacement of the irradiation position varies<br>
depending on the position of the mobile body 45,<br>
the correction voltage for the electrostatic<br>
deflection electrode 74 (the first deflection<br>
electrode plates 74a and the second deflection<br>
electrode plates 74b) needs to be changed<br>
depending on the position of the mobile body 45.<br>
Therefore, the focal position control part 21<br>
successively calculates the correction voltage<br>
for the electrostatic deflection electrode 74<br>
(the first deflection electrode plates 74a and<br>
the second deflection electrode plates 74b)<br>
based on the mobile body position information.<br>
For example, the RAM 82a holds coefficients of<br>
polynomial approximation (a function of the<br>
mobile body position) by which the<br>
characteristic shown in FIG. 16 is approximated.<br>
With the polynomial approximation, an<br>
irradiation position correction voltage<br>
corresponding to the present mobile position<br>
information is calculated. The calculation of<br>
the irradiation position correction voltage is<br><br>
performed by the CPU 80a by reading out<br>
coefficient data of the coefficients from the<br>
RAM 82a according to the calculation program<br>
read out from the ROM 81a and using output data<br>
of the position detecting part 23. The<br>
calculation result is output to the D/A<br>
converter circuit 85a. If the amplification<br>
factor of the amplifier 87a is 1, the correction<br>
voltage shown in FIG. 16 is output from the D/A<br>
converter circuit 85a to the amplifier 87a. If<br>
the amplification factor of the amplifier 87a is<br>
10, 1/10 of the correction voltage shown in FIG.<br>
16 is output from the D/A converter circuit 85a<br>
to the amplifier 87a. Thus the displacement of<br>
the irradiation position of the electron beam b<br>
is corrected.<br>
With the irradiation position<br>
controlling method of the electron beam<br>
recording apparatus 10a of this embodiment, the<br>
irradiation position of the electron beam b can<br>
be corrected not only in the above described<br>
manner but also by using the secondary electron<br>
reflection image displayed on the display part<br>
29 .<br>
For correction using the secondary<br><br>
electron reflection image, a fixed stage (not<br>
shown) is hung from an opening of the tip end<br>
portion 60a of the lens barrel 60, and the test<br>
substrate 90 is placed on the fixed stage.<br>
Then, the host controller 20 scans the<br>
electron beam b on the surface of the test<br>
substrate 90 in the X-Y plane by using the<br>
electrostatic deflection electrode 74. The<br>
secondary electron detector 49 detects a<br>
secondary electron when the scanning is<br>
performed. The image retrieving part 27 forms a<br>
secondary electron reflection image. Then, the<br>
display part 29 displays the secondary electron<br>
reflection image.<br>
The positions of the particles 94 of<br>
the test substrate 90 are estimated in advance.<br>
The positions of the particles 94 of the test<br>
substrate 90 and the position of the particles<br>
in the secondary electron reflection image<br>
displayed on the display part 29 are compared so<br>
as to measure positional shifts of the particles<br>
94 using the length measuring function of the<br>
image processing part 28.<br>
Irradiation position displacement due<br>
to the magnetic field on each position of the<br><br>
turntable 53 (the rotating mechanism unit 34) is<br>
inspected with naked eyes using the length<br>
measuring function of the image processing part<br>
28. Then, a voltage is manually applied to the<br>
electrostatic deflection electrode 74. The<br>
irradiation position is adjusted to an<br>
appropriate position such that the particles<br>
appear in the secondary electron reflection<br>
image if there is no influence of the magnetic<br>
field. It is to be noted that the turntable 53<br>
is stopped when calculating the correction<br>
voltage for the irradiation position.<br>
The voltage applied for adjusting the<br>
irradiation position to the appropriate position<br>
is obtained as irradiation position adjustment<br>
information. Then, a travel distance<br>
characteristic of the electron beam b shown in<br>
FIG. 17 is computed. Based on the travel<br>
distance characteristic of the electron beam b,<br>
a correction voltage is computed in the<br>
irradiation position control part 100, so that<br>
the irradiation position of the electron beam b<br>
is adjusted to the appropriate irradiation<br>
pos ition.<br>
In the electron beam recording<br><br>
apparatus 10a of this embodiment, the turntable<br>
53 is moved to a position of X=0 mm, and a<br>
secondary electron image is obtained.<br>
Then, positional shifts of the<br>
particles 94, i.e., an irradiation position<br>
displacement amount (the voltage applied for<br>
adjusting to the appropriate irradiation<br>
position) of each particle 94 on the surface of<br>
the base 92 is calculated using the length<br>
measuring function.<br>
The irradiation position displacement<br>
amount (the voltage applied for adjusting to the<br>
appropriate irradiation position) is<br>
successively calculated while changing the<br>
position of the turntable 53. An approximate<br>
expression is computed using the calculated<br>
irradiation position displacement amounts and<br>
then written into the ROM 81a as a program.<br>
According to the electron beam<br>
recording apparatus 10a of this embodiment, it<br>
is preferable that the ROM 81a of the<br>
irradiation position control part 100 be a flash<br>
ROM or the like so that coefficient data of the<br>
irradiation position characteristic computed by<br>
calculating the irradiation position<br><br>
displacement amount be written at the time of,<br>
for example, recording (exposure) onto the<br>
sample S. The irradiation position control part<br>
100 may have an input part so that the<br>
coefficients of the approximate expression are<br>
input by the input part.<br>
Although the fixed stage (not shown)<br>
for the test substrate 90 hung from the opening<br>
of the tip end portion 60a is provided, the<br>
configuration is not limited thereto. For<br>
example, in an alternative embodiment, the<br>
magnetic detector 36 is used as a fixed stage.<br>
In this alternative embodiment, particles such<br>
as e.g., gold particles and latex spheres, with<br>
diameters of about tens of nanometers thorough<br>
hundreds of nanometers are supplied on the<br>
surface of the magnetic detector 36 onto which<br>
the electron beam b is to be irradiated, and a<br>
secondary electron image is observed. In another<br>
alternative embodiment, particles such as e.g.,<br>
gold particles and latex spheres, with a<br>
diameter of about tens of nanometers thorough<br>
hundreds of nanometers are applied to the<br>
surface of the turntable 53 in the form of, e.g.,<br>
a cross or a sguare, and a secondary electron<br><br>
image on the surface of the turntable 53 is<br>
observed.<br>
In the second embodiment, even when the<br>
convergence position characteristic is<br>
calculated in the above described way, the same<br>
advantages as in the first embodiment are<br>
obtained. Moreover, the irradiation position in<br>
the X direction and the Y direction is corrected<br>
Therefore, compared with the first embodiment,<br>
the electron beam b is irradiated onto a<br>
predetermined position of the sample S with high<br>
focal position accuracy and high irradiation<br>
position accuracy for recording information.<br>
Similarly, printing patterns are also recorded<br>
on the sample S at high quality. In this<br>
embodiment, since the displacement of the<br>
convergence position is experimentally computed<br>
using the test substrate 90 with the particles<br>
94 on the surface, the electron beam recording<br>
apparatus 10 is simple and inexpensive.<br>
As described above, according to the<br>
present invention, the convergence position<br>
displacement due to the magnetic field under the<br>
point from which the laser beam b is irradiated<br>
to the sample S is calculated or experimentally<br><br>
calculated, so that the focal position of the<br>
electron beam b is controlled with high accuracy<br>
Moreover, the irradiation position displacement<br>
due to the magnetic field under a point from<br>
which the laser beam b is irradiated onto the<br>
sample S is calculated or experimentally<br>
calculated, so that the irradiation position of<br>
the electron beam b is controlled with high<br>
accuracy. That is, the electron beam b is<br>
irradiated to a predetermined position of the<br>
sample S with high focal position accuracy and<br>
high irradiation position accuracy for recording<br>
information.<br>
The focal position controlling method<br>
and the irradiation position controlling method<br>
of the electron beam recording apparatus 10a of<br>
this embodiment are not limited to the method of<br>
inspection using naked eyes. For example, the<br>
focal position controlling method and the<br>
irradiation position controlling method of the<br>
electron beam recording apparatus 10a of this<br>
embodiment may be automated by using the image<br>
processing part 28.<br>
The following describes a second method<br>
of controlling the focus of the electron beam b<br><br>
in the electron beam irradiation device 14 of<br>
the electron beam recording apparatus 10a of<br>
this embodiment.<br>
The second method of controlling the<br>
focus in the electron beam recording apparatus<br>
10a is the same as the above-described focal<br>
position controlling method of the electron beam<br>
recording apparatus 10a except correcting focal<br>
position displacement by image processing. The<br>
second focus controlling method is therefore not<br>
described in detail.<br>
According to the second focus<br>
controlling method, a fixed stage (not shown) is<br>
hung from an opening of the tip end portion 60a<br>
of the lens barrel 60, and a test substrate 90<br>
is placed on the fixed stage. The test substrate<br>
90 may be the one shown in FIG. 12A and FIG. 12B<br>
Then, the host controller 20 scans the<br>
electron beam b on the surface of the sample<br>
substrate 90 in the X-Y plane. The secondary<br>
electron detector 49 detects the secondary<br>
electron generated when the scanning is<br>
performed. The image retrieving part 27 forms a<br>
secondary electron reflection image based on the<br>
detection result of the secondary electro<br><br>
detector 49. Then, the image processing part 28<br>
analyzes the secondary electron reflection image<br>
The image processing part 28 computes<br>
the size of the particles 94 in the secondary<br>
electron reflection image, and compares the<br>
computed size of the particles 94 with the size<br>
of the particles 94 measured in advance so as to<br>
calculate a focal position displacement amount<br>
(defocus amount).<br>
Then, the size of the particles 94 in<br>
the secondary electron reflection image is<br>
calculated for each position of the turntable 53<br>
so as to calculate a focal position displacement<br>
(defocus amount) on each position due to a<br>
magnetic field.<br>
A voltage applied for achieving<br>
accurate focus and calculated for each position<br>
of the turntable 53 is obtained as focal<br>
position adjustment information (defocus amount)<br>
Thus the convergence position characteristic of<br>
the electron beam b is obtained. Based on the<br>
convergence position characteristic of the<br>
electron beam b, a correction voltage is<br>
computed in the focal position control part 21,<br>
so that the focal position of the electron beam<br><br>
b is adjusted to beat the appropriate focal<br>
position.<br>
In the electron beam recording<br>
apparatus 10a of this embodiment, the turntable<br>
53 is moved to a position of X=0 mm, and the<br>
focus of the electron beam b is adjusted to the<br>
particles 94 .<br>
Then, a convergence position, i.e., a<br>
defocus amount (the voltage applied for<br>
achieving accurate focus) of each particle 94 on<br>
the surface of the base 92 is calculated. An<br>
approximate expression is computed using the<br>
calculated defocus amounts and then written into<br>
the ROM 81 as a program.<br>
The following describes a second method<br>
of controlling the irradiation position of the<br>
electron beam b in the electron beam irradiation<br>
device 14 of the electron beam recording<br>
apparatus 10a of this embodiment.<br>
The second method of controlling the<br>
irradiation position in the electron beam<br>
recording apparatus 10a is the same as the<br>
above-described irradiation position controlling<br>
method of the electron beam recording apparatus<br>
10a except correcting irradiation position<br><br>
displacement by image processing. Therefore, the<br>
second irradiation position controlling method<br>
is not described in detail.<br>
According to the second focal position<br>
controlling method, a fixed stage (not shown) is<br>
hung from an opening of the tip end portion 60a<br>
of the lens barrel 60, and a test substrate 90<br>
is placed on the fixed stage.<br>
Then, the host controller 20 scans the<br>
electron beam b on the surface of the test<br>
substrate 90 in the X-Y plane. The secondary<br>
electron detector 49 detects secondary electrons<br>
when the scanning is performed. The image<br>
retrieving part 27 forms a secondary electron<br>
reflection image and outputs the image to the<br>
display part 28.<br>
The size and position of the particles<br>
94 of the test substrate 90 are measured in<br>
advance, and the measured size and position of<br>
the particles 94 are stored in the image<br>
processing part 28.<br>
The image processing part 28 compares<br>
the stored size and position of the particles 94<br>
with the position of the particles 94 in the<br>
secondary electron reflection image so as to<br><br>
calculate a positional shift of the particles 94<br>
Then, a voltage to be applied to the<br>
electrostatic deflection electrode 74 for<br>
relocating the particles 94 to the original<br>
position based on the positional shift of the<br>
particles 94, thereby calculating a correction<br>
voltage for each position. It is to be noted<br>
that the turntable 53 is stopped when<br>
calculating the correction voltage for the<br>
irradiation position.<br>
Thus a travel distance characteristic<br>
of the electron beam b is computed. Based on the<br>
travel distance characteristic of the electron<br>
beam b, a correction voltage is computed in the<br>
irradiation position control part 100, so that<br>
the irradiation position of the electron beam b<br>
is adjusted to beat the appropriate irradiation<br>
position.<br>
In the electron beam recording<br>
apparatus 10a of this embodiment, the turntable<br>
53 is moved to a position of X=0 mm, and a<br>
secondary electron image is obtained.<br>
Then, the image processing part 28<br>
calculates a positional shift of the particles<br>
94, i.e., an irradiation position displacement<br><br>
amount (the voltage applied for adjusting to the<br>
appropriate irradiation position) of each<br>
particle 94 on the surface of the base 92.<br>
The irradiation position displacement<br>
amount (the voltage applied for adjusting to the<br>
appropriate irradiation position) is<br>
successively calculated while changing the<br>
position of the turntable 53. An approximate<br>
expression is computed using the calculated<br>
irradiation position displacement amounts and<br>
then written into the ROM 81a as a program.<br>
The second focal position control<br>
method and the second irradiation position<br>
control method of the electron beam recording<br>
apparatus 10a of this embodiment described above<br>
achieve the same advantages as the first<br>
described methods.<br>
While the electron beam recording<br>
apparatus of the present invention has been<br>
described in terms of preferred embodiments, it<br>
will be apparent to those skilled in the art<br>
that the present invention is not limited to the<br>
preferred embodiments illustrated herein, and<br>
variations and modifications may be made without<br>
departing from the scope of the invention.<br><br>
The present application is based on<br>
