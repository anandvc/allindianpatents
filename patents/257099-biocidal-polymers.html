				<td>Biocidal polymers<br>
The invention relates to biocidal polymers which are based on monounsaturated bicyclic  or quadricyclic monomers having nitrogen functionalities or phosphorus functionalities, to processes for preparing them, and to their use.<br>
There are a multiplicity of microorganisms which colonize on surfaces and propagate to form biofilms. Such colonization may be unwanted for a large number of reasons, such as, for example, hygiene concerns in the case of medical articles or transport materials and packaging materials for foodstuffs and comestibles, or economic considerations in the case of boat hulls.<br>
One way of avoiding colonization by microorganisms is the regular treatment of at-risk surfaces with disinfectants for external application. Disadvantages of a procedure of this kind include the need for frequent repetition of the treatment, the difficulty of estimating the amounts required, and the often unhealthy qualities of the disinfectants.<br>
Another, way of avoiding colonization by microorganisms is to use materials whose surfaces are biocidally active. Such materials can be produced, for instance, by incorporating biocidally active substances into a base material. Organometallic compounds, metal salts, of tin, silver or copper, for example, or specific organic compounds are known to act as biocides. When such compounds are admixed to a plastic or to a surface coating, a decay-inhibiting or biocidal activity is obtained. According to US 4532269, for example, a terpolymer of butyl methacrylate, tributyltin methacrylate, and tert-butylaminoethyl methacrylate can be used as an antimicrobial marine coating. Disadvantages of such materials reside in the decrease in their biocidal activity over time, since the concentration of the biocidal substances in the base material<br>
diseappears continuously through diffusion and leaching, and in the environmental pollution associated with this release of the biocidal substances.<br>
Moreover, polymer materials having biocidal properties can be obtained by using monomers substituted with biocidally active groups to produce said materials. In this case the biocidal activity is long-lasting and is not reduced by gradual leaching and diffusion.<br>
Accordingly, EP0862858 describes a copolymer of tert-butylaminoethyl methacrylate and aliphatically unsaturated monomers. WO0118077 discloses a homopolymer of acryloyloxy-alkylamines or methacryloyloxyalkylamines. Ilker et al., Macromolecules 2004,. 37, 694-700, disclose antibacterial polymers of cyclic anhydrides or imides based on norbornene.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to develop further biocidally active polymers whose presence leads to the destruction of microorganisms and which prevent colonization of microorganisms on surfaces.<br>
Unexpectedly it has been found that, by polymerization of certain norbornene derivatives, polymers having excellent biocidal activity can be obtained.<br>
The application accordingly provides biocidal polymers comprising structural repeating units according to at least one of the formulae 1 and 2<br>

This bicycle containing the ring member X2 carries the substituents SI, S2, S3, S4.<br>
In formula 2 the ring containing the ring member XI is part of a 7-membered norbornene ring, a norbornene derivative or, if X2 is -CH2-CH2-, part of an 8-membered bicycle. For n=0 the ring containing the ring member X1 carries the substituents S1, S2, S3, S4.

norbornene derivative or, if X2 is -CH2-CH2-, an 8-membered bicycle. This bicycle containing the ring member X2 carries the substituents S1, S2, S3, S4.<br>
The term norbornene derivative also embraces 7-membered carbon bicycles, having two 2-membered bridges and one 1-membered bridge, in which the 1-membered bridge is formed by a heteroatom.<br>

The length, nature, and substitution pattern of the spacer may vary within a wide range. Variation is likewise possible in the substitution pattern of the terminal functional group. As a result the substituents S1,<br>
52,	S3, S4 can be custom-tailored to different end applications. In order to optimize the structure of S1, S2,<br>
53,	S4 for a certain application, for example, with a given structure of the spacer, it is possible to use a secondary or tertiary terminal amino group having long-chain or short-chain substituents. Likewise, depending on the nature<br>

Biocidal polymers may also take the form of salts of mineral acids such as HC1 or HBr, for example, or the form of salts of organic acids such as CF3COOH, for example.<br>
The saturated derivatives of the biocidal polymers can be obtained by aftertreating the double bonds in the polymer chain, such as by hydrogenation, by addition reactions such as epoxidation, chlorination, addition of ammonia, crosslinking copolymerization with vinyl monomers (e.g., styrene, acrylonitrile) or with olefins (e.g., butene)<br>
or with acrylates and methacrylates (e.g., butyl acrylate and methyl methacrylate) , hydrosilylation, thiol-ene addition reaction, for example.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention the term polymer also embraces oligomers having more than 3 repeating units.<br>

The formula 3 embraces all of the stereoisomeric forms of the structure shown.<br>
In formula 3 the ring containing the ring member X1 is part of a 7-membered norbornene ring, a norbornene derivative or, if X2 is -CH2-CH2-, part of an 8-membered bicycle.

For n=l, X1 and X2 can be identical or different, and fused onto the bicycle carrying the ring member X1 is either a 7-membered norbornene ring, a norbornene derivative or, if X2 is -CH2-CH2-, an 8-membered bicycle. This bicycle containing the ring member X2 carries the substituents S1, S2, S3, S4.<br>
The term norbornene derivative also embraces 7-membered carbon bicycles, having two 2-membered bridges and one 1-membered bridge, in which the 1-membered bridge is formed by a heteroatom.<br>
For formula 3, n=0 is preferred. If n=l, then in formula 3 preferably X1 = X2.<br>

The length, nature, and substitution pattern of the spacer may vary within a wide range. Variation is likewise possible in the substitution pattern of the terminal functional group. As a result the substituents S1, S2, S3, S4 can be custom-tailored to different end applications. In order to optimize the structure of S1, S2, S3, S4 for a certain application, for example, with a given structure of the spacer, it is possible to use a secondary or tertiary terminal amino group having long-chain or short-chain substituents.

In the 3-7-membered unsaturated rings formed with the N of the group -N(R4)R5, and also in the 5-8-membered unsaturated rings formed with the N of the group -N(R4)R5 and also a further heteroatom, the nitrogen may form a double bond to one of the substituents R4, R5 and may therefore be quaternized in the group -N(R4)R5, such as in a pyridinium ring, for example.<br>
By the 3-7-membered saturated or unsaturated heterocycles formed with the N of the group -N(R4)R5 are preferably meant the azirine, aziridine, azete, dihydroazete, azetidine, pyrrole, pyrrolidine, pyridine, piperidine, azepine, azepan ring.<br>

All of the heterocycles stated in the three preceding paragraphs may carry further substituents on the heteroatoms or on the ring carbon atoms, examples being C1-C4 alkyls such as ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl. One example of such a compound is the 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidine-4-oxyl radical.<br>

The desired substituents S1, S2, S3, S4 in the general formulae 1, 2, and 3 either are introduced during the actual synthesis of the parent bicyclic substructures, through the choice of corresponding reactants, or are obtained in the completed bicyclic substructures or in the polymer by modification of substituents present.<br>
The compounds of the general formula 3 of claims 3 to 6 serve for preparing biocidal polymers of claim 1. By a biocidal activity is meant in this context the destruction or the inhibition of growth of microorganisms such as bacteria, algae, fungi, and yeasts, for example. The biocidal polymers are thermally stable.<br>
The biocidal polymers may be not only homopolymers but also copolymers. The copolymers may take the form of random copolymers, alternating copolymers, block copolymers or grafted copolymers (graft copolymers).<br>
In the copolymers there may be different structural units of formula 1 linked to one another; there may also be structural units of formula 1 linked to other kinds of structural units. Such other kinds of structural units may be introduced, for example, by copolymerization with unsubstituted norbornene or substituted norbornene derivatives.<br>
Additionally in the copolymers there may be different structural units of formula 2 linked to one another; additionally, structural units of formula 2 may also<br>
Toe linked to other kinds of structural units. Such other kinds of structural units may be introduced, for example, by copolymerization with ethylene, propylene, butylene, unsubstituted norbornene, substituted norbornene derivatives, vinyl monomers such as, for example, styrene and acrylonitrile, acrylates or methacrylates.<br>
For preparing graft copolymers it is possible to proceed by the method of "grafting from" or "grafting to". In the case of "grafting from" the polymerization of the monomer in question begins on an existing substrate polymer B, this substrate polymer B being in solution or in solid form. In the case of "grafting to", an existing polymer A is coupled to a substrate polymer B, and a covalent bond is formed. The substrate polymer B can in this case be in solution or in solid form.<br>
In one particular embodiment of "grafting from" the surface of the substrate polymer B must be activated beforehand (for example, by means of ionizing radiation, UV light, attachment of an initiator or a catalyst) and then the polymerization of the monomer in question must be started on this activated surface.<br>
In this way it is possible to couple biocidal polymers to another surface, thereby giving that surface a biocidal quality.<br>
In a further embodiment ("grafting from") a polymer surface which contains C=C double bonds is provided with a catalyst, which in a further step polymerizes monomers of formula 3 of claim 5 onto this surface. In this case as well a modified surface having biocidal qualities is obtained. For example, norbornene derivatives can be subjected to ring-opening grafting, using ruthenium-carbene complexes, onto surfaces of EPDM rubber (terpolymer containing ethylene, propylene, and a diene monomer).<br>
Both these embodiments give graft copolymers according to claim 7.<br>
In this way the surfaces of plastics and other materials<br>
are modified in such a way that these surfaces obtain biocidal qualities, without any need for the materials themselves to be modified in their entirety.<br>
Biocidal polymers may also take the form of blends, composed of two or more biocidal polymers of claim 1 or of one or more biocidal polymers of claim 1 and one or more further polymers.<br>
Examples of further polymers which can be used include polyurethanes, polyolefins, polyethylenes, polypropylenes, polysiloxanes, polystyrenes, poly(alpha-methylstyrenes) , polyacrylates, polymethyl methacrylates, PVC, polyamides or polyterephthalates. Particular preference is given to polyethylenes, polypropylenes, and PVC.<br>
The biocidal polymers and polymer blends of the invention may also comprise additives such as, for example, stabilizers, processing assistants, antistats, plasticizers, nucleating agents, dyes and pigments, flame retardants, and antioxidants, and also fillers and reinforcing agents such as nanoparticles, inorganic fibers such as glass fibers or carbon fibers, and organic fibers such as flax, for example (composites).<br>
In order to ensure that a polymer blend has a sufficient biocidal activity, the fraction of biocidal polymer in the blend is 0.2-90% by weight, preferably 1-35% by weight, more preferably 3-10% by weight, based on the total mass of the blend. In specific embodiments of the invention the minimum amount of biocidal polymer may also be 1.5% by weight, preferably 5% by weight, more preferably 7% by weight. The upper limit on the proportion of biocidal polymer may also adopt values up to 40% by weight, more preferably up to 60% by weight, and very preferably up to 80% by weight.<br>
The biocidal polymers are prepared from compounds of the general formula 3 of claim 5 or 6 using a ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP), an addition polymerization via the C=C double bond, with retention of the ring structure, or else a free radical or cationic polymerization.<br>
Examples of catalysts used for metathesis polymerizations include homogeneous catalysts based on ruthenium-carbene complexes and molybdenum-carbene complexes (Love et al., Angew.   Chem.,   2002, 114(21), 4207-4209).<br>
In order to avoid leaching of the biocidal polymers from the products manufactured from them, polymer structures are used which are extremely insoluble in aqueous systems. For applications where solubility of the polymers in aqueous systems is desired, it is also possible to choose a polymer structure which is soluble in aqueous systems.<br>
The invention further provides for the use of biocidal polymers comprising structural repeating units according to at least one of the formulae 1 and 2<br>

The biocidally active products may be manufactured from the biocidal polymers or polymer blends themselves, or from polymer mixtures which comprise the biocidal polymers or polymer blends.<br>
They may be, for example, components of systems for storing and conducting drinking water and industrial water, films, fibers, woven fabrics, nonwovens, components of food processing machinery, components of air-conditioning units, components of air-introduction and air-removal systems, components of vehicle interior trim, bathroom and toiletry articles, kitchen articles, components of sanitary installations, components in water systems, toys, food packaging, roofing systems, animal cages, touch panels of instruments, medical articles such as catheters, tubes, films, gloves, caps, patches, blood bags or surgical instruments, hygiene articles such as toothbrushes, toilet seats or combs, and contact lenses.<br>

Where products to be made biocidal have been manufactured from other materials, they may be given the desired biocidal properties by coatings of the biocidal polymers or polymer blends.

The areas of application for biocidal coatings and biocidal products to a very large extent correspond to one another.<br>
The biocidal polymers and polymer blends can additionally be added as additives to cosmetic or medical formulations in order, for example, to give pastes or ointments with biocidal activity.<br>
Added in dispersed form or in solution, the biocidal polymers and polymer blends may be used for disinfecting, sterilizing, and preventing biofouling in closed or open industrial-water systems and cooling-water systems. The dispersed polymers and polymer blends can be removed from the systems by filtration.<br>

exo,endo-Bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2-carboxylic acid 2-(tert-<br>
butylamino)ethyl ester.<br>
0.160 mol of acryloyl chloride (from Lancaster) was introduced as an initial charge in dilution in 30 ml of dichloromethane. 0.320 mol of freshly cracked cyclopentadiene (bp=41°C) was added slowly dropwise with stirring in an ice bath. When dropwise addition was complete, the reaction solution was stirred at room temperature for 14 h. The resulting reaction solution of exo,endo-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2-carbonyl chloride was admixed slowly dropwise, with stirring and in an ice bath, with a solution of 0.144 mol of 2-tert-butylaminoethanol (from Aldrich) in 30 ml of dichloromethane. When dropwise addition was complete, the reaction solution was stirred at room temperature for 24 h. The solvent was stripped off under reduced pressure. The pale yellow residue was reprecipitated from chloroform/n-heptane. Recrystallization from acetone gave a white solid (hydrochloride). This intermediate was dissolved in 300 ml of chloroform, 0.144 mol of Na2CO3=H20 was added, and the suspension was stirred at room temeprature for 3 h. Thereafter it was extracted with 150 ml of distilled water. The pH of the aqueous phase was 8. The organic phase was dried over Na2S04 and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. This gave the product as an oily liquid in a yield of 52%.<br>

Catalytic grafting of monomers 1, 2, 3, and 4 onto EPDM<br>
rubber by means of ROMP<br>
In preparation the base polymer EPDM rubber (Dutral TER 404 9; EPDM terpolymer of 55% ethylene, 40% propylene, and 5% ethylidenenorbornene) is dissolved in toluene and reprecipitated from methanol with 0.1 percent by weight of 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxytoluene as stabilizer.<br>
0.2 g of purified EPDM and 0.004 g of 2-hydroxy-2-methyl-l-phenyl-1-propanone (photoinitiator from Ciba) are dissolved in 10 ml of toluene. This solution is applied by means of rotational coating to a CaF2 plaque (Spincoater RC5 from Karl Suess, rotational speed 1000 rpm, rotation time 45 s, rotational acceleration 1000 rpm/s) and irradiated using a mercury vapor lamp under a nitrogen atmosphere for 15 minutes. All further reaction steps take place under an inert gas atmosphere. The specimen obtained is introduced into a round-bottomed flask containing 3 ml of a 0.0015 molar solution of the catalyst "Bispyridine Complex 6" (Love et al., Angew.   Chem.,   2002, 114(21),   4207-4209) in absolute acetone. After 2 h at 40°C, the specimen is removed and washed with absolute acetone. The specimen is then transferred to a round-bottomed flask containing 3 ml of a 0.375 molar solution of one of the monomers 1-4 in absolute acetone. After 24 h of reaction at 40°C (absence of oxygen and moisture) the reaction is halted by addition of 5 drops of ethyl vinyl ether, and the specimens are removed, washed repeatedly with acetone, and dried at 80°C.<br>

Characterization of the surfaces of polymers 1, 2, 3, 4 and<br>
of graft copolymers 1, 2, 3, 4<br>
The glass transition temperatures (Tg) of polymers 1, 2, 3 and 4 were determined using a Pyris Diamond DSC (Perkin Elmer) DSC calorimeter (5 mg sample in each case; 2 heating runs from -50°C to +150°C; heating rate of 20°C/min; cooling rate 10°C/min). The glass transition temperatures (Tg) were determined in the 1st cooling run and in the 2nd heating run; the value reported in each case is the midpoint figure (see Table 3).<br>
The thermal stability of the polymers was tested using a thermogravimetry unit (STA 625 from Rheometrics Ltd.) (5 mg sample in each case; nitrogen atmosphere with 35 ml/min nitrogen flow rate; heating rate 10°C/min; samples heated from room temperature to 500°C). The onset of thermal degradation of the polymers was determined from the change in weight with temperature, and was reported in °C (see Table 3) .<br>
Table 3 (Table Removed)<br>
Films of the polymers 1, 2, 3, and 4 were produced on glass surfaces by rotation coating from chloroform solution. The contact angle (test liquids: water and a-bromonaphthalene) was determined by the sessile drop method using a drop shape analysis system DSA100 (Kruss) (testing at 20-25°C; drop<br>
volume: ~20 jxl; reading after 1 s) . The contact angle data<br>
were used to calculate the surface energies (ys, ysd and ysp, in mJ/m2) by the method of Owens and Wendt (J. Appl. Polymer Sex.,   1969, 13, 1741 ff.).<br>
The isoelectric point of the polymers (in the form of films on glass plates) was determined by means of measurements of streaming potential (Anton Paar electrokinetic analyzer EKA; clamping cell with PMMA counterplate; 0.001 molar KC1 electrolyte solution); the data were evaluated by the method of Fairbrother and Mastin (J.

Determination of the antimicrobial activity of polymers 1, 2,<br>
For the microbiological testing, 1% strength solutions of polymers 1, 2, 3, and 4 in chloroform were prepared. From these solutions, polymer films were applied to glass plaques measuring 40 x 40 mm (rotational coating). On these plaques the antimicrobial activity of polymers 1, 2, 3, and 4 was tested in accordance with Japanese industry standard JIS Z 2801:2000, using the test organisms Staphylococcus aureus (DSM 346) and Escherichia coli (DSM 787). As samples for comparison, plaques of LLDPE (Dowlex 2388; linear low density polyethylene (containing 1-octene)) were tested.<br>
The living microbe counts CFU/ml (colony-forming units per milliliter) were determined directly after inoculation (start) and after 24 hours of incubation for the polymers 1, 2, 3, and 4 and for the LLDPE comparison sample (see Table 6).<br>

Determination of the antimicrobial activity of graft copolymer 3<br>
For the microbiological testing of graft copolymer 3, a 40 x 40 mm glass plaque was coated with EPDM rubber (Dutral TER 4049; EPDM terpolymer of 55% ethylene, 40% propylene, and 5% ethylidenenorbornene). The EPDM film was crosslinked by UV radiation with 2-hydroxy-2-methyl-l-phenyl-l-propanone (photoinitiator from Ciba), as described in Example 6. This specimen was placed in 80 ml of a 0.0015 solution of the catalyst "Bispyridine Complex 6" in absolute acetone, and the tightly sealed reaction batch was heated at 40°C for 2<br>
h under an inert gas atmosphere. After that time the specimen was removed and washed with acetone to remove unattached initiator, under a nitrogen atmosphere. The specimen treated in this way was transferred to a laboratory autoclave containing 80 ml of a 0.37 5 molar solution of monomer 3 in absolute acetone. The sealed reaction vessel was heated at 40°C for 24 h (absence of oxygen and moisture). Then the reaction was halted by addition of about 1 ml of ethyl vinyl ether, and the specimen was removed, washed repeatedly with acetone to remove residual monomer and homopolymer, and dried at 80°C. The product was characterized by means of NMR, FTIR, UV.<br>
On the specimens thus treated the antimicrobial activity of graft copolymer 3 was tested in accordance with Japanese industry standard JIS Z 2801:2000, using the test organisms Staphylococcus aureus (DSM 346) and Escherichia coli (DSM 787). As samples for comparison, plaques of LLDPE (Dowlex 2388; linear low density polyethylene (containing 1-octene)) were tested.<br>
The living microbe counts CFU/ml (colony-forming units per milliliter) were determined directly after inoculation (start) and after 24 hours of incubation for the graft copolymer 3 and for the LLDPE comparison sample (see Table 7).<br>

In the next reaction step the procedure is as follows: 4.5 minol of 2-dimethylaminoethanol are dissolved under an inert gas atmosphere in 10 milliliters of absolute (anhydrous) dimethylformamide. Then at room temperature 7.2 mmol of sodium hydride (in the form of a 60% dispersion in mineral oil) are added with stirring. After 30 min 5 mmol of the intermediate 4-(exo,endo-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-2-yl)benzyl chloride, in solution in 10 milliliters of dimethylformamide, are added dropwise over a period of 10 min under an inert gas atmosphere. Subsequently the reaction mixture is heated at 60°C for 12 hours with stirring. After the end of the reaction, 50 milliliters of water are added, and then 2 g of sodium hydrogen carbonate (in powder form) are added. This mixture is extracted with 100 milliliters of dichloromethane. The dichloromethane extract is washed with aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution (2 g in 50 milliliters of water) and then dried over sodium sulfate. The solvent is then stripped off under reduced pressure at a temperature of 80°C. The residue which remains is taken up in 20 milliliters of n-heptane and freed from insolubles by filtration. Gaseous hydrogen chloride is introduced into the heptane solution, leading to the formation of a white precipitate. This precipitate represents the hydrochloride of 4-(exo,endo-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-2-yl)benzyl 2-(dimethyl-amino)ethyl ether. This precipitate is separated off by filtration, washed with 20 milliliters of n-heptane, and dried under reduced pressure at 40°C. The dried product is introduced into a solution of 2 g of sodium hydrogen carbonate in 50 milliliters of water and is extracted with 100 milliliters of dichloromethane. The dichloromethane extract is washed with aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution (2 g in 50 milliliters of water) and then dried over sodium sulfate. The solvent is then stripped off under reduced pressure at a temperature of 40°C. This gives 3.8 mmol of 4- (exo,endo-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-2-yl)benzyl<br>

0.37 mmol of 4-(exo,endo-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-2-yl)benzyl 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl ether is dissolved under an inert gas atmosphere in 5 milliliters of absolute (anhydrous) dichloromethane which has been freed from dissolved oxygen. Then 0.0012 mmol of "Bispyridine Complex 6" catalyst (Love et al., Angew.   Chem.,   2002, 114(21), 4207-4209), in solution in 3 ml of absolute dichloromethane, is added with stirring. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 24 h in the absence of moisture and oxygen. Then the reaction is terminated by addition of 5 drops of ethyl vinyl ether. The reaction solution is concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting polymer is precipitated from n-pentane, then reprecipitated from dichloromethane/n-pentane and dried to constant weight under reduced pressure at 40°C.<br>
This gives 81 mg of poly{4-(bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-2-yl)benzyl 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl ether}, also referred to as poly{[2-(4-{bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-2-yl}benzyloxy)ethyl]-dimethylamine}, in the form of a pale yellow solid.
