				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to novel compounds which are useful for treating a variety of cell proliferative disorders such as cancer. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A wide range of growth factors coordinate cell proliferation and differentiation. Malignant cells arise as a result of a stepwise progression of events that include the unregulated expression of growth factors or components of their signaling pathways. Tyrosine phosphorylation events initiated by receptor, cytoplasmic and nuclear kinases and regulated by phosphatases are central to these processes. Mutation, hyper-activation, translocation and overexpression of protein tyrosine kinases are all associated with tumorigenesis. In addition to increasing proliferative rates and immortalizing cells, overexpression of tyrosine kinases can lead to morphological transformation and cause anchorage independence, contributing to the promotion of migratory ability and possibly the induction of metastases.<br>
Certain compounds with structures based upon mimicry of ATP or phosphotyrosine have been shown to be effective kinase inhibitors. Those based upon phosphotyrosine have been demonstrated to be the more specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Because of their ability to inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation, these compounds may alter cell responses to growth factors or other process driven by tyrosine kinase activity, including unregulated growth as the result of tyrosine kinase overexpression, mutation, or translocation. inhibition of tyrosine kinases occupying a central role in proliferative signaling pathways, or in pathways regulating cell cytoskeletal structure, even temporary or incomplete inhibition, may be sufficient to switch a cancerous cell from a proliferative cycle into programmed cell death, or apoptosis. Death by apoptosis is most often observed upon effective treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.<br><br>
Selective inhibition of specific tyrosine kinases offers a- method of targeting cancerous cell growth with a high degree of specificity and minimal toxicity to normally growing cells and tissues. Thus, specific inhibitors of tyrosine kinases have great potential as clinical anti-cancer treatments. A number of small molecules which act as tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been identified. For example, certain phenyi acrylonitrile compounds have been described as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, effective to inhibit cell proliferation (see for example, US 5,891,917, US 5,217,999, US 5,773,476, US 5,935,993, US 5,656,655, US 5,677,329 and US 5,789,427).<br>
Inhibition of tyrosine kinases offers one mechanism by which cell proliferation can be inhibited. One of skill in the art will appreciate that other mechanisms of inhibition may also be involved.<br>
There is a need in the art to identify compounds that inhibit cell proliferation. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A number of novel compounds have now been identified that inhibit abnormal cell proliferation, for example cancer cell growth. The compounds do not inhibit the growth of normal cells.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention includes compounds of Formula I and salts, solvates and hydrates thereof<br>

The present invention includes within its scope, prodrugs of the compounds of the invention. In general, such prodrugs will be functional derivatives of a compound of the invention which are readily convertible in vivo into the compound from which it is notionally derived. Conventional procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable prodrugs are<br><br>
described, for example, in "Design of Prodrugs" ed. H. Bundgaard, Elsevier, 1985.<br>
Some of the compounds of the invention may have at least one asymmetric center. Where the compounds according to the invention have one asymmetric center, the may exist as enantiomers. Where the compounds of the invention possess two or more asymmetric centers, they<br>
t<br>
may additionally exist as diastereomers. It is to be understood that all such isomers and mixtures thereof in any proportion are encompassed within the scope of the present invention.<br>
The present invention includes radiolabeled forms of compounds of the invention, for example, compounds of the invention labeled by incorporation within the structure 3H or 14C or a radioactive halogen such as 125I.<br>
The compounds of the invention may, for example, be derived from an activated cinnamyl compound and an activated cyano-substituted methylene compound. A person skilled in the art, therefore, may wish to provide a generic name for the compounds of the invention based on the cinnamyl moiety. However, generic nomenclature based on the formed acylonitriie moiety, for example, styryl acrylonitrile, would be more proper. III. Methods of Preparing Compounds of the Invention<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, the compounds of the invention can be prepared by processes analogous to those established in the art. Therefore, compounds of this invention may be prepared by the reaction sequence shown in Scheme 1:<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
Compounds of the general Formulae I, II and/or III useful in the practice of this invention can be prepared by Knoevenagei condensation of<br><br>
a,p-unsaturated aldehydes, such as cinnamaldehyde or its various aryl-substituted homologues (IV), with a compound having active a-methylene group (V). Similar Knoevenagel condensations using ylidenemalononitriles as active a-methylene group components were described in a review (F. Freeman. Chem. Rev. 1980, V. 80, P. 329-350). For example, these condensations may be carried out in a polar solvent, such as ethanol, in the presence of catalytic amounts of a weak base, such as 0-alanine. Reaction temperatures may be in the range of 20 to 100°C, depending on the stability of the materials used in the condensation.<br>
Compounds of Formulae IV and/or V may be commercially available, such as cinnamaldehyde, and its 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxy derivative. Other compounds of Formulae IV and/or V may be prepared using straightforward procedures. For example, various R1, R2, R3-hydroxy substituted cinnamaldehydes can be prepared from the corresponding commercially available aryl substituted cinnamic acids. Scheme 2 gives an example of the preparation of protected 3,4-dihydroxycinnamaldehyde (IVa) starting from 3,4-dihydroxycinnamic acid (VI). At the end of the reaction sequence, the protection groups can be removed using standard methods well known to those having skill in the art.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
R1, R2, R3 substituents may be also converted from one functional group to another, for example by known reduction of nitro groups into amino groups and the further transformation into dialkylamino groups, or by known conversion of hydroxy groups to halo groups.<br><br>
a-Cyano amides with a reactive methylene group (Va) may be obtained, for example, as described in A. Gazitet.al. J. Med. Chem., 1991, V. 34, P. 1896-1907. For example, by heating methyl cyanoacetate (VII) and an appropriate commercially available amine (VIII) up to 100°C without presence of a solvent for 12-15 h followed by vacuum distillation directly from the mixture (for example using a Kugelrohr apparatus), the desired products may be obtained (Scheme 3).<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
In some cases the chemistries outlined above may have to be modified, for instance by use of protective groups, to prevent side reactions due to reactive groups, such as reactive groups attached as subst'rtuents. This may be achieved by means of conventional protecting groups, for example as described in "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry" McOmie, J.F.W. Ed., Plenum Press, 1973 and in Greene, T.W. and Wuts, P.G.M., "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1991.<br>
The formation of a desired compound salt is achieved using standard techniques. For example, the neutral compound is treated with an acid or base in a suitable solvent and the formed salt is isolated by filtration, extraction or any other suitable method.<br>
The formation of solvates of the compounds of the invention will vary depending on the compound and the solvate. In general, solvates are formed by dissolving the compound in the appropriate solvent and isolating the solvate by cooling or using an antisolvent. The soivate is typically dried or azeotroped under ambient conditions.<br>
Prodrugs of the compounds of the invention may be conventional esters formed with available hydroxy, amino or carboxyl group. For example, when R1, R2 or R3 is OH in a compound of Formulae I, II and/or 111, it may be acylated using an activated acid in the presence of a base, and optionally, in<br><br>
inert solvent (e.g. an acid chloride in pyridine). Some common esters which have been utilized as prod rugs are phenyl esters, aliphatic (C8-C24) esters, acyloxymethyl esters, carbamates and amino acid esters.<br>
A radiolabeled compound of the invention may be prepared using standard methods known in the art. For example, tritium may be incorporated into a compound of the invention using standard techniques, for example by hydrogenation of a suitable precursor to a compound of the invention using tritium gas and a catalyst. Alternatively, a compound of the invention containing radioactive iodo may be prepared from the corresponding trialkyltin (suitably trimethyltin) derivative using standard iodination conditions, such as [125I] sodium iodide in the presence of chloramine-T in a suitable solvent, such as dimethylformamide. The trialkyltin compound may be prepared from the corresponding non-radioactive halo, suitably iodo, compound using standard palladium-catalyzed stannylation conditions, for example hexamethylditin in the presence of tetrakis(triphenylphosphine) palladium (0) in an inert solvent, such as dioxane, and at elevated temperatures, suitably 50-100°C. IV. Uses<br>

One skilled in the art can determine which compounds of the invention would have therapeutic utility, for example, in inhibiting cell proliferation in any type of cancer or cell proliferative disorder. Compounds may be examined for their efficacy in inhibiting cell growth in cell proliferation assays such as those described herein in Examples 35-56. Accordingly, the methods, uses and compositions of the invention are meant to include only those compounds having the desired effect.<br>
The ability of the compounds of the invention to inhibit the growth of cancer cells, in particular hematopoetic cell malignancies, in vitro and in vivo was examined. Several of the compounds tested were found to eliminate cancerous cell growth in culture at sub-micro-molar doses, in particular, CR4, CR11 and CR19 were found to be highly effective against a variety of cell types, such as Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, Philadelphia positive Leukemia and Acute Myeloid Leukemia. Low nanomolar doses of both CR4 and CR19 were highly toxic to cancer cells, while normal cell growth and differentiation were unaffected. These effects were obtained by long term exposure to low levels of the compounds. Accordingly, in one aspect, this invention provides a method of inhibiting the proliferation of a hematopoietic cancer cell by administering an effective amount of a compound of the invention, preferably, CR4 or CR11 or CR19, to a cell or animal in need thereof.<br>
It has been determined that the compound CR4 is capable of effectively killing human Philadelphia positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells in vivo, using a murine model. CR4 efficiently reduced tumor load and infiltration of the organs by the ALL cells. The doses required to eliminate cancer cell growth do not result in detectable non-specific damage to the animal.<br><br>
It has also been determined that the compounds of the invention, such as CR4 and CR11, are effective as ex vivo purging agents. For ex vivo administration, bone marrow cells may be removed from a patient with cancer and purged ex vivo with a compound of the invention. Such a purging will kill the tumor cells while leaving the normal bone marrow cells intact. After purging, the cells can be washed and reintroduced into the patient.<br>
During ex vivo purging assays the cells were exposed to relatively high doses of the compounds (50jj,M-100nM) for short (1-24 hours) periods of time, resulting in the elimination of cancer cell growth, while normal bone marrow cells exposed to the same doses over the same period of time were relatively unaffected. Cancer cell death was effected by the induction of apoptosis. Accordingly, in another aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for killing cancer cells by ex vivo treatment of bone marrow from a patient with cancer with a compound of the invention, preferably CR4 and CR11 and then re-introducing the treated (or purged) bone marrow into the patient.<br>
In addition to cancer, the compounds of the invention are useful in treating other conditions involving aberrant or abnormal cell proliferation. Other cell proliferative disorders that may be treated by the present invention include inflammatory diseases, allergies, autoimmune disease, graft rejection psoriasis, restenosis, atherosclerosis, and any other disorder wherein it is desirable to inhibit, prevent or suppress cell growth. Compounds of the invention may be tested for their efficacy in a particular cell proliferation disorder using assays and techniques known to those of skill in the art. For example, the following references provide assays for various conditions.

The compounds of the invention are tyrosine kinase modulators and are useful in modulating tyrosine kinase activity, including the inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity, for the treatment of various conditions such as all proliferative disorders as mentioned above. Accordingly, the invention provides a method of modulating tyrosine kinase activity by administering an effective amount of a compound of the invention to a cell or animal in need thereof. In a further aspect, the invention provides a method of inhibiting tyrosine kinase activity by administering an effective amount of a compound of the invention to a cell or animal in need thereof.<br>
While the compounds of the invention may act by inhibiting tyrosine kinase activity, one of skill in the art will appreciate that other modes or mechanisms of action for the compounds of the invention are possible.<br>
The compounds of the invention are preferably formulated into pharmaceutical compositions for administration to human subjects in a biologically compatible form suitable for administration in vivo. Accordingly, in another aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the invention in admixture with a suitable diluent or carrier.<br>
The compositions containing the compounds of the invention can be prepared by known methods for the preparation of pharmaceutically acceptable compositions which can be administered to subjects, such that an effective quantity of the active substance is combined in a mixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle. Suitable vehicles are described, for example, in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., USA 1985). On this basis, the compositions include, albeit not exclusively, solutions of the substances in association with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles or diluents, and contained in buffered solutions with a suitable pH and iso-osmotic with the physiological fluids.<br><br>
The compounds of this invention may be used in the form of the free base, in the form of salts, soivates and as hydrates. All forms are within the scope of the invention. Acid addition salts may be formed and provide a more convenient form for use; in practice, use of the salt form inherently amounts to use of the base form. The acids which can be used to prepare the acid addition salts include preferably those which produce, when combined with the free base, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, that is, salts whose anions are non-toxic to the animal organism in pharmaceutical doses of the salts, so that the beneficial properties inherent in the free base are not vitiated by side effects ascribable to the anions. Although pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the basic compounds are preferred, all acid addition salts are useful as sources of the free base form even if the particular salt per se is desired only as an intermediate product as, for example, when the salt is formed only for the purposes of purification and identification, or when it is used as an intermediate in preparing a pharmaceutically acceptable salt by ion exchange procedures.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts within the scope of the invention include those derived from the following acids; mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid and sulfamic acid; and organic acids such as acetic acid, citric acid, lactic acid, tartaric acid, malonic acid, methanesuffonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, cyclohexylsulfamic acid, quinic acid, and the like.<br>
In accordance with the methods of the invention, the described compounds or salts or soivates thereof may be administered to a patient in a variety of forms depending on the selected route of administration, as will be understood by those skilled in the art. The compositions of the invention may be administered orally or parenterally. Parenteral administration includes intravenous, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, intramuscular, transepithelial, nasal, intrapulmonary, intrathecal, rectal and topical modes of administration. Parenteral administration may be by continuous infusion over a selected period of time.<br><br>
A compound of the inv/ention or a salt or solvate thereof may be orally administered, for example, with an inert diluent or with an assimilable edible carder, or it may be enclosed in hard or soft shell gelatin capsules, or it may be compressed into tablets, or it may be incorporated directly with the food of the diet. For oral therapeutic administration, the compound of the invention may be incorporated with excipient and used in the form of ingestible tablets, buccal tablets, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, and the like.<br>
A compound of the invention may also be administered parenterally or intraperitoneally. Solutions of a compound of the invention as a free base or pharmacologically acceptable salt or solvate can be prepared in water suitably mixed with a surfactant such as hydroxypropylcellulose. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, DM SO and mixtures thereof with or without alcohol, and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms. A person skilled in the art would know how to prepare suitable formulations. Conventional procedures and ingredients for the selection and preparation of suitable formulations are described, for example, in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (1990 - 18th edition) and in The United States Pharmacopeia: The National Formulary (USP 24 NF19) published in 1999.<br>
The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersion and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that easy syringabil'rty exists.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be administered to an animal alone or in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, as noted above, the proportion of which is determined by the solubility and chemical nature of the compound, chosen route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice.<br>
The dosage of the compounds and/or compositions of the invention can vary depending on many factors such as the pharmacodynamic properties of<br><br>
the compound, the mode of administration, the age, health and weight of the recipient, the nature and extent of the symptoms, the frequency of the treatment and the type of concurrent treatment, if any, and the clearance rate of the compound in the animal to be treated. One of skill in the art can determine the appropriate dosage based on the above factors. The compounds of the invention may be administered initially in a suitable dosage that may be adjusted as required, depending on the clinical response. As an example, the compounds of the invention can be administered in a range from about 1 nanomolarto about 100 micromolar, preferably 50 nanomolarto 50 micromolar. For ex vivo treatment of cells over a short period, for example for 30 minutes to 1 hour or longer, higher doses of compound may be used than for long term in vivo therapy; for example, concentrations of 50p,M or higher may be used.<br>
The present invention also includes a use of a compound or composition of the invention in order to inhibit cell proliferation, preferably cancer cell proliferation. The present invention further includes a use of a compound or a composition of the invention to prepare a medicament to inhibit cell proliferation, preferably cancer cell proliferation.<br>
The compounds of the invention can be used alone or in combination with other agents that modulate tyrosine kinase activity or in combination with other types of treatment (which may or may not modulate tyrosine kinase activity) for cell proliferative disorders. Agents known in the art that inhibit tyrosine kinase activity include, but are not limited to, antisense nucleic acid and ribozymes targeted to nucleic acid encoding a receptor tyrosine kinase, antibodies able to modulate tyrosine kinase activity and other small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as those described in US 5,891,917, US 5,217,999, US 5,773,476, US 5,935,993, US 5,656,655, US 5,677,329 and US 5,789,427. There are various examples of other types of treatment for cell proliferative disorders currently used to treat different types of cancers. The general treatments are based on the cancer type and do not specifically target tyrosine kinase activity, in a particular aspect of the present invention, the<br><br>
compounds of the invention may be used in combination with other therapies and therapeutics to treat leukemia.<br>
In addition to the above-mentioned therapeutic uses, the compounds of the invention are also useful in diagnostic assays, screening assays and as research tools.<br>
In diagnostic assays the compounds of the invention may be useful in identifying or detecting a cell proliferative disorder. In such an embodiment, the compounds of the invention may be radiolabelled (as hereinbefore described) and contacted with a population of cells. The presence of the radiolabelled on the cells may indicate a cell proliferative disorder. In a specific embodiment, the radiolabelled compounds of the invention may be used to detect the presence of cells expressing a bcr-abl fusion protein.<br>
In screening assays, the compounds of the invention may be used to identify other compounds that modulate cell proliferation or tyrosine kinase activity. As research tools, the compounds of the invention may be used in receptor binding assays and assays to study the localization of tyrosine kinases. In such assays, the compounds may also be radiolabelled.<br>

Example 35: Effect of CR4 Upon Normal Bone Marrow Differentiation in Culture<br>
The CFU-GEMM assay was performed according to Fauser and Messner (1978, Blood, 52(6) 143-8) and Messner and Fausser (1980, Blut, 41(5) 327-33) with some variations. In brief, heparinized bone marrow cells were layered over Percoll (1.077 gm/ml) (Pharmacia Fine Chemical, Piscataway NJ) and centrifuged at 400g at 4°C for 10 minutes to remove neutrophils and RBCs. The fractionated BM cells at 2x105 cells/ml were cultured in IMDM (OCI, Toronto) containing 0.9% (vol/vol) methylcellulose supplementd with 30% FCS (Cansera Rexdale, ON.) or normal human plasma, a cocktail of cytokines containing G-CSF (10 ng/ml, Amgen), IL-3 (40<br><br>
U/ml, Immunex), MGF (50 hg/ml, Immunex), Erythropoietin (2u/ml, Epprex) or TPO (10 ng/ml, Amgen), 5x10'5M 0-2-mercaptoethanol and the specified concentration of CR4. The culture mixture was plated in 1 ml volumes into 35 mm petri dishes and incubated at 37°C, 5% CC&gt;2 in a humidified atmosphere. All cultures were evaluated at 14 days for the number of BFU-E colonies (defined as aggregates of more than 500 hemoglobinized cells or, 3 or more erythroid subcolonies), CFU-GM colonies (defined as granulocyte or monocyte-macrophage cells or both), CFU-Meg colonies (comprising 4 or more megakaryocytes) and CFU-GEMM colonies (a mixed population comprising of all elements).<br>
The results shown in Figure 1 demonstrate that CR4 displayed negligible toxicity upon normal bone marrow at doses up to 5 p,M. At 10 u.M CR4 began to cause some inhibition of BFU-E colony formation, but at the same time significantly stimulated CFU-GM colony numbers.<br>
Example 36: Killing of Philadelphia positive Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia by low-dose CR4 in culture.<br>
Ph+ ALL cells were plated in 1 ml volumes, in the absence of exogenous growth factors, into 35 mm petri dishes (Nunc, Gibco) containing alpha MEM (Gibco) plus 10% FCS (Cansera Rexdale, ON.) in 0.9% (vol/vol) methylcellulose (Fluka, Switzerland) with the indicated concentrations of CR4. Cultures were set at 37°C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. Colonies consisting of more than 20 cells were counted at 12 days or earlier using an inverted microscope.<br>
The results shown in Figure 2 demonstrate that CR4 effected a significant inhibition of Ph+ ALL cell proliferation and survival at low nanomolar doses (35-100). CR4 has no effect upon normal cells at equivalent concentrations.<br>

Cell cultures were incubated in a humidified atmosphere at 37°C with 5% CO2. Colonies containing more than 20 cells were scored, using an inverted microscope, at 5-6 days.<br>
- The results shown in Figure 4 demonstrate that CR4 effected a complete inhibition of AML-3 cell proliferation and survival at nanomoiar concentrations (300-600nM). CR4 has no effect upon normal cell survival at equivalent concentrations.<br>
Example 39: Killing of Ly-MN Lymphoma cells by low-dose CR4 in culture.<br>
Ly-MN cells were plated in 1 ml volumes, in the absence of exogenous growth factors, into 35 mm petri dishes (Nunc, Gibco) containing IMDM (OCI, Toronto) plus 20% human cord blood plasma in 0.9% (vol/vol) methylcellulose (Fluka, Switzerland) and the indicated concentrations of CR4. Cultures were<br><br>
set at 37°C, 5% CC&gt;2 in a humidified atmosphere. Colonies consisting of more than 20 ceils were counted at 5 days or earlier using an inverted microscope.<br>
The results shown in Figure 5 demonstrate that CR4 significantly inhibited cell proliferation and survival at nanomolar doses, and effected a inhibition by 2.5 jiM. CR4 has no effect upon normal cells at equivalent concentrations.<br>
Example 40:   Killing of Primary Juvenile Myelo-Monocytic Leukemia Cells by CR4 in Culture.<br>
Heparinized bone marrow cells from a JMML patient were layered over Percoll (1.077 gm/ml) (Pharmacia Fine Chemical, Piscataway NJ) and centrifuged at 400g at 4°C for 10 minutes to remove neutrophils and RBCs. Cells were further fractionated and purified on Miltenyi MS columns (Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, Germany) to acquire an early progenitor population of CD34* cells. The fractionated BM CD34* cells at a density of 1 x 104 cells/ml were cultured in IMDM (OCI, Toronto) containing 0.9% (vol/vol) methylcellulose supplemented with 30% FCS (Cansera Rexdale, ON.) with the indicated concentration of CR4. The culture mixture was plated in 1 ml volumes into 35 mm petri dishes and incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. Colonies consisting of more than 20 cells were counted at 12 days or earlier using an inverted microscope.<br>
The results shown in Figure 6 demonstrate that CR4 displayed moderate killing ability with primary JMML cells, with 80-90 percent inhibition achieved by 5 jiM concentrations.<br>
Example 41:   Killing of OCI-LY2 Lymphoma Cells by low-dose CR4 in culture.<br>
OCI-LY2 cells were plated in 1 ml volumes, in the absence of exogenous growth factors, into 35 mm petri dishes (Nunc, Gibco) containing IMDM (OCI, Toronto) plus 20% human cord blood plasma in 0.9% (vol/vol) methylcellulose (Fluka, Switzerland) and the indicated doses of CR4. Cultures were set at 37°C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. Colonies consisting of<br><br>
more than 20 cells were counted at 5 days or earlier using an inverted microscope.<br>
The results shown in Figure 7 demonstrate that CR4 significantly inhibited cell proliferation and survival at high nanomolar to low micromolar doses (90% at 2.5 j-iM). CR4 has no effect upon normal cells at equivalent concentrations.<br>
Example 42:   Killing of Philadelphia positive ALL Cells by CR17 and CR21 in culture.<br>
ALL cells were plated in 1 ml volumes, in the absence of exogenous growth factors, into 35 mm petri dishes (Nunc, Gibco) containing alpha MEM (Gibco) plus 20% PCS (Cansera Rexdale, ON.) in 0.9% (vol/vol) methylcellulose (Fiuka, Switzerland) and the indicated concentrations of compound. Cultures were set at 37°C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. Colonies consisting of more than 20 cells were counted at 12 days or earlier using an inverted microscope.<br>
The results shown in Figure 8 demonstrate that CR17 displayed significant inhibition of cell growth at 1-2.5 u.M concentrations. CR21 inhibited cell growth at 5 jiM.<br>
Example 43: Killing of Philadelphia positive ALL Cells by CR17 and CR21 in culture.<br>
ALL cells were plated in 1 ml volumes, in the absence of exogenous growth factors, into 35 mm petri dishes (Nunc, Gibco) containing alpha MEM (Gibco) plus 20% FCS (Cansera Rexdale, ON.) in 0.9% (vol/vol) methylcellulose (Fluka, Switzerland) and the indicated concentrations of compound. Cultures were set at 37°C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. Colonies consisting of more than 20 cells were counted at 12 days or earlier using an inverted microscope.<br>
The results shown in Figure 9 demonstrate that CR17 and CR21 both displayed significant inhibition of cell growth at 1-2.5 uM concentrations.<br><br>
Example 44:   Killing of Philadelphia positive ALL Cells by CR24 in culture.<br>
ALL cells were plated in 1 ml volumes, in the absence of exogenous growth factors, into 35 mm petri dishes (Nunc, Gibco) containing alpha MEM (Gibco) plus 20% PCS (Cansera Rexdale, ON.) in 0.9% (vol/vol) methylcellulose (Fluka, Switzerland) and the indicated concentrations of CR24. Cultures were set at 37°C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. Colonies consisting of more than 20 cells were counted at 9 days or earlier using an inverted microscope.<br>
The results shown in Figure 10 demonstrate that CR24 was effective against Ph+ ALL cells at concentrations as low as 0.5 u.M, demonstrating a virtually complete inhibition of cell growth between 2.5 and 5 u.M.<br>
Example 45:   Killing of Philadelphia positive ALL Cells by CR19 in culture.<br>
ALL cells were plated in 1 ml volumes, in the absence of exogenous growth factors, into 35 mm petri dishes (Nunc, Gibco) containing alpha MEM (Gibco) plus 20% PCS (Cansera Rexdale, ON.) in 0.9% (vol/vol) methylcellulose (Fiuka, Switzerland) and the indicated concentrations of CR19. Cultures were set at 37°C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. Colonies consisting of more than 20 cells were counted at 9 days or earlier using an inverted microscope.<br>
The results shown in Figure 11 demonstrate that CR19 was highly effective against Ph+ ALL ceils at nanomolar concentrations between 250 and 500nM.<br>
Example 46:  Effect of CR19 on Normal Bone Marrow Differentiation in Culture.<br>
The CFU-GEMM assay was performed according to Fauser and Messner (1978, Blood, 52(6) 1243-8) and Messner and Fausser (1980, Blut, 41(5) 327-33) with some variations. In brief, heparinized bone marrow cells were layered over Percoll (1.077 gm/ml) (Pharmacia Fine Chemical,<br><br>
Piscataway NJ) and centrifuged at 400g at 4°C for 10 minutes to remove neutrophils and RBCs. The fractionated BM cells at 2x105 cells/ml were cultured in IMDM (OCI, Toronto) containing 0.9% (vol/vol) methylcellulose supplementd with 30% PCS (Cansera Rexdale, ON.) or normal human plasma, a cocktail of cytokines containing G-CSF (10 ng/ml, Amgen), IL-3 (40 U/ml, Immunex), MGF (50 ng/ml, Immunex), Erythropoietin (2u/ml, Epprex) or TPO (10 ng/ml, Amgen), 5x10"5M (3-2-mercaptoethanol and the specified concentrations of CR19. The culture mixture was plated in 1 ml volumes into 35 mm petri dishes and incubated at 37°C, 5% CC&gt;2 in a humidified atmosphere. All cultures were evaluated at 14 days for the number of BFU-E colonies (defined as aggregates of more than 500 hemaglobinized cells or, 3 or more erythroid subcolonies) and CFU-C colonies (defined as granulocyte or monocyte-macrophage cells or both).<br>
The results shown in Figure 12 demonstrate that CR19 displayed significant inhibition of the development of BFU-E colonies at 2.5 jiM, although at this concentration it also boosted CFU-C colony formation. At 5 JAM the stimulatory effect disappeared and BFU-E colonies were virtually absent.<br>
Example 47: Effect of CR24, CR17 and CR21 on Normal Bone Marrow Differentiation.<br>
The CFU-GEMM assay was performed according to Fauser and Messner (1978, Blood, 52(6) 1243-8) and Messner and Fausser (1980, Blut, 41(5) 327-33) with some variations (British Journal of Haematoiogy, 1992, 80, p40-48). In brief, heparinized bone marrow cells were layered over Percoll (1.077 gm/ml) (Pharmacia Fine Chemical, Piscataway NJ) and centrifuged at 400g at 4°C for 10 minutes to remove neutrophils and RBCs. The fractionated BM cells at 2x105 cells/ml were cultured in IMDM (OCI, Toronto) containing 0.9% (vol/vol) methylcellulose supplementd with 30% PCS (Cansera Rexdale, ON.) or normal human plasma, a cocktail of cytokines containing G-CSF (10 ng/ml, Amgen), IL-3 (40 U/ml, Immunex), MGF (50 ng/ml, Immunex), Erythropoietin (2u/ml, Epprex) or TPO (10 ng/ml, Amgen), 5x10"5M 0-2-<br><br>
mercaptoethanol and the specified concentration of test compound. The culture mixture was plated in 1 ml volumes into 35 mm petri dishes and incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2, in a humidified atmosphere. All cultures were evaluated at 14 days for the number of BFU-E colonies (defined as aggregates of more than 500 hemoglobinized cells or, 3 or more erythroid subcolonies) and CFU-C colonies (defined as granulocyte or monocyte-macrophage cells or both).<br>
The results shown in Figure 13 demonstrate that CR24 displayed minimal inhibition of bone marrow colony formation at either 10 or 20 jiM concentrations, whereas both CR17 and CR21 caused inhibition of BFU-E colony formation at the higher 20 p,M dose.<br>
Example 48: In vitro Purging of Normal Bone Marrow with CR4.<br>
Heparinized bone marrow cells were layered over Percoll (1.077 gm/mi) (Pharmacia Fine Chemical, Piscataway NJ) and centrifuged at 400g at 4°C for 10 minutes to remove neutrophils and RBCs.<br>
For the purging process, the cells were resuspended at 1x106/ml in complete medium with or without 50 u.M CR4. The cells were incubated with the CR4 for two and a half hours at 37°C, 5% CO2. At the end of this period the cells were thoroughly washed in medium to remove CR4 and then cultured at 2x105 cells/ml in IMDM (OCI, Toronto) containing 0.9% (vol/vol) methylcellulose supplemented with 30% PCS (Cansera Rexdale, ON.) or normal human plasma, a cocktail of cytokines containing G-CSF (10 ng/ml, Amgen), IL-3 (40 U/ml, Immunex), MGF (50 ng/ml, Immunex), Erythropoietin (2u/ml, Epprex) or TPO (10 ng/ml, Amgen) and 5x10'5M b-2-mercaptoethanol. The culture mixture was plated in 1 ml volumes into 35 mm petri dishes and incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. All cultures were evaluated at 14 days for the number of BFU-E colonies (defined as aggregates of more than 500 hemaglobinized cells or, 3 or more erythroid subcolonies), CFU-C colonies (defined as granulocyte or monocyte-macrophage cells or both) and CFU-GEMM colonies (a mixed population comprising of all elements).<br><br>
The results shown in Figure 14 demonstrate that two and a half hours exposure to 50 M-M CR4 did not result in significant inhibition of colony formation. While a slight drop in BFU-E colonies occurred, CFU-C colony numbers actually increased significantly.<br>
Example 49: In Vitro Purging of Z119 Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia with CR4.<br>
For the purging assay, the cells were resuspended in complete medium with or without CR4 as indicated and incubated at 37°C, 5%CC&gt;2 for 0-5 hours. Cells were then washed thoroughly with medium to remove the CR4, resuspended and plated in 1 ml volumes, in the absence of exogenous growth factors, into 35 mm petri dishes (Nunc, Gibco) containing alpha MEM (Gibco) plus 20% FCS (Cansera Rexdale, ON.) in 0.9% (vol/vol) methylcellulose (Fluka, Switzerland). Cultures were set at 37°C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. Colonies consisting of more than 20 cells were counted at 9 days or earlier using an inverted microscope.<br>
The results shown in Figure 15 demonstrate that CR4 demonstrated rapid killing of Z119 cells at the concentrations examined. 50 jiM CR4 displayed a complete inhibition after only 2.5 hours exposure, while 85% killing could be achieved with 25 \iM CR4 over the same time period. A longer five hour exposure of the cells to 25 u.M CR4 resulted in a complete ablation of subsequent cell growth.<br>
Example 50: In vitro Purging of OCI-l_y2 Lymphoma cells with CR4.<br>
For the purging assay, the cells were resuspended in complete medium with or without CR4 as indicated and incubated at 37°C, 5%CO2 for 0-5 hours. Cells were then washed thoroughly with medium to remove CR4, resuspended and plated in 1 ml volumes at 5x103 cellls/ml, in the absence of exogenous growth factors, into 35 mm petri dishes (Nunc, Gibco) containing IMDM (OCI, Toronto) plus 20% human cord blood plasma in 0.9% (vol/vol) methylcellulose (Fluka, Switzerland). Cultures were set at 37°C, 5% CO2 in a<br><br>
humidified atmosphere. Colonies consisting of more than 20 cells were counted at 5 days or earlier using an inverted microscope.<br>
The results shown in Figure 16 demonstrate that CR4 demonstrated significant killing (90%) of OCI-Ly2 cells at 25-50 \M after only 5 hours exposure. The lower 12.5 p,M dose tested also achieved significant killing in the same time period.<br>
Example 51:   In vitro Purging of OCI-AML-3 Acute Meyloid Leukemia Cells with CR4.<br>
For the purging assay, the cells were resuspended in complete medium with or without CR4 as indicated and incubated at 37°C, 5%CO2 for 0-5 hours. Cells were then washed thoroughly with medium to remove CR4, resuspended and plated in 1 ml volumes at 5x103 cells/ml, in the absence of exogenous growth factors, into 35 mm petri dishes (Nunc, Gibco) containing alpha MEM (Gibco) plus 10% PCS (Cansera Rexdale, ON.) in 0.9% (vol/vol) methylcellulose (Fluka, Switzerland). Cultures were set at 37°C, 5% COa in a humidified atmosphere. Colonies consisting of more than 20 cells were counted at 5 days or earlier using an inverted microscope.<br>
The results shown in Figure 17 demonstrate that CR4 demonstrated significant killing of OCI-AML-3 cells at 50 pM after only 2.5-5 hours exposure. The lower 25 jiM dose tested also achieved significant killing in the same time period.<br>
Example 52: In vitro Purging of Ramos B Cell Burkitt's Lymphoma Cells with CR4.<br>
For the purging assay, the cells were resuspended in complete medium with or without CR4 as indicated and incubated at 37°C, 5%COa for 0-5 hours. Cells were then washed thoroughly with medium to remove the CR4, resuspended and plated in 1 ml volumes, in the absence of exogenous growth factors, into 35 mm petri dishes (Nunc, Gibco) containing RPM11640 (Gibco) plus 10% FCS (Cansera Rexdale, ON.) in 0.9% (vol/vol) methylcellulose (Fluka, Switzerland). Cultures were set at 37°C, 5% CO2 in a<br><br>
humidified atmosphere. Colonies consisting of more than 20 cells were counted at 12 days or earlier using an inverted microscope.<br>
The results shown in Figure 18 demonstrate that CR4 demonstrated significant killing (70%) of Ramos cells at 50 uM after 5 hours exposure.<br>
Example 53: Killing of HuNS1 multiple myeloma by CR4.<br>
HuNS1 cells were plated in 35mm petri dishes (Nunc, Gibco) in 1ml volumes at a density of 1x104 cells/ml, in the absence of exogenous growth factors, containing alpha MEM plus 20% PCS (Cansera, Rexdale Ont), and 0.9% (vol/vol) methylcellulose (Fluka, Switzerland) and the indicated concentrations of CR4. Cell cultures were incubated in a humidified atmosphere at 37eC with 5% CO2. Colonies containing more than 20 cells were scored, using an inverted microscope, at 5-6 days.<br>
The results shown in Figure 19 demonstrate that CR4 significantly inhibited cell proliferation and survival at high nanomolar to low micromolar doses (&gt;90% at 2.5jiM). CR4 has no effect upon normal cells at equivalent concentrations.<br>
Example 54:   In  Vivo Treatment of Philadelphia  positive Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in NOD-SCID mice.<br>
NOD-SCID mice were irradiated (350 rads) and injected with 5x106 Philadelphia positive Z119 Acute lymphoblastic leukemia ceils. After 24 hours Alzet micro-osmotic pumps (Alza Corp. Paolo Alto, CA) were implanted subcuntaneously, containing either 20 mM solution of CR4 in 50% DMSO/medium or 50% DMSO/medium alone. Alzet 2001 pumps were utilized, holding a total volume of 200uJ and releasing 1fil per hour over 7-10 days. Pumps were replaced after 7 days. Each mouse received a daily dose of0.154mgofCR4.<br>
After 14 (Fig.20A) and 21 (Fig.20B) days mice were sacrificed and bone marrow extracted from the fore and hind limbs. Single cell suspensions were prepared, red blood cells lysed and the samples stained with PE-labelled isotype, anti-human CD19 and anti-human HLA-DR antibodies to<br><br>
detect the presence of Z119 cells! These antibodies do not cross react with murine cells.<br>
At d14, bone marrow cell cultures were also performed to assess the presence of Z119 cells. 5x104 BM cells were cultured in IMDM (OCI, Toronto) containing 0.9% (vol/vol) methylcellulose supplemented with 30% serum consisting of a 1:1 mixture of PCS (Cansera Rexdale, ON.) and normal human plasma. No cytokines are added. Under these conditions there is no growth of murine cells. The culture mixture was plated in 1 ml volumes into 35 mm petri dishes and incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. All cultures were evaluated at 9 days for the number of ALL colonies.<br>
The results shown in Figures 20A and 20B demonstrate that at both day 14 and 21 sacrifices, a significant reduction in ALL infiltration of the bone marrow was observed in all the mice treated with CR4 relative to the DMSO treated control mice.<br>
In control animals, massive infiltration of the spleen, liver and kidney was observed, as well as the presence of ALL cells in the peripheral blood. In addition to a 90% reduction in the infiltration of ALL cells into the bone marrow, treatment with CR4 reduced ALL infiltration of the organs and blood to below detectable levels.<br>
Thus, CR4 was highly effective against a variety of cancer cells, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Philadelphia positive ALL, acute myeloid leukemia, myeloma and B-lineage lymphoma, at concentrations ranging from 50nM to 5\iM. At the same time, minimal toxicity was seen when normal cells were incubated in the presence of CR4 until concentrations of 10-20jiM or greater were achieved. CR4 was particularly active against bcr-abl transformed Philadelphia positive cells, achieving &gt;90% wipeout at concentrations as low as 40nM. CR4 was also highly effective in high dose (25-5CVM) in vitro purging assays against Philadelphia positive ALL, AML and lymphoma, causing &gt;90% inhibition of growth with a 2.5 to 5 hour exposure time. Over identical doses and times normal bone marrow growth and differentiation were unaffected. CR4 showed a combination of high level toxicity to cancer cells with minimal non-specific cytotoxic damage.<br><br>
CR4 was also highly effective in a whole animal model (Example 54). The compound demonstrated good retention characteristics, still being detectable in the blood 30 minutes after I.V. injection. In a murine model of human Ph+ ALL, CR4 caused a greater than 90 percent reduction in /* '. infiltration of bone marrow within a two week period, reducing the presen jf infiltrating ALL cells in liver, kidney, spleen and peripheral blood below detection level. In contrast, control mice treated with vehicle alone demonstrated massive infiltration of all these organs. No evidence of nonspecific toxicity was observed.<br>
Example 55: In vitro Purging of Normal Bone Marrow with CR11.<br>
Heparinized bone marrow cells were layered over Percoll (1.077 gm/ml) (Pharmacia Fine Chemical, Piscataway NJ) and centrifuged at 400g at 4°C for 10 minutes to remove neutrophils and RBCs.<br>
For the purging process, the cells were resuspended at 1x106/ml in complete medium with or without 50u,M CR11. The cells were incubated with the tryrphostin for seven hours at 37°C, 5% CO2. At the end of this period the cells were thoroughly washed in medium to remove CR11 and then cultured at 2x106 cells/ml in IMDM (OCI, Toronto) containing 0.9% (vol/vol) methylcellulose supplementd with 30% FCS (Cansera Rexdale, ON.) or normal human plasma, a cocktail of cytokines containing G-CSF (10 ng/ml, Amgen), IL-3 (40 U/ml, Immunex), MGF (50 ng/ml, Immunex), Erythropoietin (2u/ml, Epprex) or TPO (10 ng/ml, Amgen) and 5x10"5M p-2-mercaptoethanol. The culture mixture was plated in 1 ml volumes into 35 mm petri dishes and incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. All cultures were evaluated at 14 days for the number of BFU-E colonies (defined as aggregates of more than 500 hemoglobinized cells or, 3 or more erythrotd subcolonies), CFU-C colonies (defined as granulocyte or monocyte-macrophage cells or both) and CFU-GEMM colonies (a mixed population comprising of all elements).<br><br>
The results shown in Figure 21 demonstrate that seven hours exposure to 50u.M CR11 did not result in any significant inhibition of colony formation. BFU-E, CFU-GEMM and CFU-C colonies were all normal.<br>
Example 56:      In  Vitro  Purging  of Philadelphia  positive Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia with CR11.<br>
For the purging assay, the ceils were resuspended in complete medium with or without CR11 as indicated and incubated at 37°C, 5%CO2 for 0-7 hours. Cells were then washed thoroughly with medium to remove the CR11, resuspended and plated in 1 ml volumes, in the absence of exogenous growth factors, into 35 mm petri dishes (Nunc, Gibco) containing alpha MEM (Gibco) plus 20% FCS (Cansera Rexdale, ON.) in 0.9% (vol/vol) methylcellulose (FlUka, Switzerland). Cultures were set at 37°C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. Colonies consisting of more than 20 cells were counted at 9 days or earlier using an inverted microscope.<br>
The results shown in Figure 22 demonstrate that CR11 demonstrated complete killing of Ph+ ALL cells at 50uM after 7 hours exposure.<br>
Example 57: Philadelphia (Ph+) ALL lines Z119 and Z181  (5x106 cells/point) were lysed and immunoprecipitated with Bcr-Abl antibody.<br>
The precipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer and once with kinase assay buffer, and resuspended in same buffer containing varying concentrations of CR4. The precipitates were incubated with the drug for 10 min at room temperature, followed by addition of 10u,Ci 33PyATP. The reaction was stopped after 20 min by the addition of SDS-PAGE -reducing sample buffer and separated on an 8-16% SDS-PAGE gel. The products were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane and visualized by autoradiography.<br>
The results shown in Figure 23 demonstrate that Bcr-Abl kinase activity is effectively blocked at concentrations of 1 to 10 uM of the CR4 compound in both Z199 and Z181 ALL cell lines.<br><br>
Example 58: Philadelphia (Ph+) ALL line Z119 (5x106 cells/point) was preincubated for 5 hours with different concentrations of CR4 and immunoprecipitated with Jak2 antibody.<br>
The cells were lysed in lysis buffer and immunoprecipitated with Jak2 antibody. The precipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer and once with kinase assay buffer, followed by addition of 10p.Ci ^PyATP. The reaction was stopped after 20 min by the addition of SDS-PAGE reducing sample buffer and separated on an 8-16% SDS-PAGE gel. The products were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane and visualized by autoradiography.<br>
The results shown in Figure 24 demonstrate that Jak2 kinase activity was dramatically inhibited at a concentration of 6*iM and further blocked at higher concentrations.<br>
