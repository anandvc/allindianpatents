3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br>
This application claims the benefit of priority of U.S. Serial No. 60/896,416, filed March 22, 2007, and U.S. Serial No. 60/915,672, filed May 2, 2007. The entire contents and disclosures of the preceding applications are incorporated by reference into this application.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to uses of monoclonal antibody 8H9 or derivates thereof in treating cancer patients.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Tumor-restricted surface antigens may be targets for diagnosis and immune-based therapies. An ideal tumor antigen for targeted immunotherapy should be absent on normal tissues and abundantly expressed on tumor cell surface. Moreover, a "generic" tumor-specific antigen expressed on tumor cells of varying lineage recognized by monoclonal antibodies may have broader utility in antibody-based strategies. A novel 58 kD surface tumor-associated antigen recognized by a murine monoclonal antibody 8H9 has been reported previously {see e.g. U.S. patent application publication US 2005/0169932). The antigen recognized by 8H9 was expressed on cell membranes of a broad spectrum of tumors of neuroectodermal, mesenchymal and epithelial origin, with restricted distribution on normal tissues. This novel antibody-antigen system is very promising for tumor targeting and immunotherapy.<br>
Monoclonal antibody 8H9 can be used for tumor targeting and imaging, and purging of tumor cells. The 8H9 antigen is also a potential target for antibody-based immunotherapy against a broad spectrum of human cancers, including neuroblastoma, brain tumors, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, osteosarcoma, Ewings sarcoma, PNET, melanoma, sarcoma, wilm's tumor, hepatoblastoma, and carcinomas of various tissue origins. Construction of 8H9 single chain antibody and antibody-fusion constructs have also been described {see e.g. U.S. patent application publication US 2005/0169932).<br>
The present disclosure provides further data on using monoclonal antibody 8H9 to improve the prognosis and/or prolong the survival of a subject bearing tumor cells.<br>
Throughout this application, various references are cited. Disclosures of these publications in<br><br>
their entireties are hereby incorporated by reference into this application to more fully describe the state of the art to which this invention pertains.<br>

EXAMPLE 1<br>
Improved Outcome With Combined Modality Including 131-Iodine-8H9 Radioimmuno therapy Delivered Through The Cerebrospinal Fluid<br>
Background: Primary brain tumors and cancers metastatic to the CNS (brain parenchyma or leptomeninges [LM]) are difficult to control. Antibody-based targeted therapies administered through the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compartment have therapeutic potentials. Monoclonal antibody 8H9 is a murine IgGl antibody reactive with a wide spectrum of human solid tumors. 131-Iodine-8H9 administered through the Ommaya has favorable pharmacokinetics in non-human primates with minimal toxicities.<br>
Methods: In a phase I study, 15 patients (pts, ages 2-34 years) (1 melanoma, 3 recurrent ependymoma, 8 relapsed CNS neuroblastoma [NB], 3 recurrent medulloblastoma) received 2 mCi intra-Ommaya 131I-8H9 for dosimetry followed 1 week later by an intra-Ommaya treatment dose of 10 (n=3 pts), 20 (n=3), 30 (n=6), or 40 (n=3) mCi. Serial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood were sampled for dosimetry calculations. Nuclear scans were performed at 24 hours post to study 131I-8H9 localization. The 131-Iodine-8H9 dosimetry and treatment doses were repeated after 1 month if the pt had no PD.<br><br>
Results; Side effects included grade 1 or 2 fever, headache or vomiting; one had a transient grade 3 ALT elevation on first injection (30 mCi). Calculated mean radiation dose to the CSF was 35.7 (range 15-79) cGy/mCi; mean blood dose was 2.4 cGy/mCi. Of the 15 pt, 8 (group #1) had primary diagnosis of neuroblastoma. When they developed CNS metastasis (at median age of 3.8 years) they were treated with a salvage regimen which included 131-Iodine-8H9. All 8 pts remain alive progression-free (3+, 10+, 16+, 16+, 18+, 18+, 20+, 30+ months since 131-Iodine-8H9, and 5-43+ months since CNS/LM relapse); in one pt, 131-Iodine-8H9 achieved CR of LM disease. In contrast, median time to death from the onset of CNS/LM NB was 5.4 months for 27 historical controls. Acute side effects were self-limited; at 40 mCi dose no DLT was seen.<br>
Conclusion: Similar to CNS metastases in most other solid tumors, conventional therapies have been ineffective for NB-CNS. Intra-Ommaya 131-Iodine-8H9 (1) is safe, (2) has favorable dosimetry to CSF and marrow, and (3) may have clinical utility when added to salvage therapy using conventional modalities in the treatment of 8H9-positive LM/CNS cancers.<br>
EXAMPLE 2 Improved Resolution and Contrast Imaging of CNS Tumors Using 124-Iodine-<br>
8H9 in PET/CT Scans<br>
Background: As stated in Example 1, antibody-based targeted therapies administered through the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compartment have therapeutic potential, and radiolabeled 131-Iodine-8H9 can be used to treat metastatic disease. A patient's prognosis will be improved not only with improved treatment but also with improved detection of the metastatic disease and improved dosimetry. The following example describes an improved means of detection of neuroblastoma.<br>
Methods: Five patients were injected intrathecally with 124-Iodine-8H9 and serial PET/CT imaging and CSF sample was performed. Patients had CNS tumors (choroid plexus carcinoma, metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma, and metastatic neuroblastoma. 1.7-2 mCi 124-Iodine-8H9 was administered through an Ommaya reservoir. PET/CT scans were obtained at approximately 4, 24, and 48 hours post-injection. Serial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples through 48 hours were obtained. Images were analyzed by placing regions of interest on the<br>
9<br><br>
spinal column at all three time points. PET images provided direct activity measurements within the CSF compartment.<br>
Results: 124-Iodine-8H9 PET scans provided high resolution images of the antibody distribution with targeting of disease in the 2 patients with structural lesions on MRI. At 24 hours, most of the antibody had cleared from the ventricles and had distribution through the thecal sac and around the cerebral convexities. The distribution corresponded well with pre-treatment H1In-DTPA cisternography. Systemic activity in liver, spleen and bladder was seen at 24 and 48 hours. The biological Tl/2 clearance ranged from 8.9 hours to 64.6 hours with corresponding doses of 14.1 ti 92.9 cGy/mCi to CSF.<br>
Conclusion: 124-Iodine-8H9 PCT/CT provides higher resolution and contrast images than SPECT with 131-Iodine-8H9 for distribution, targeting and dosimetry.<br>
EXAMPLE 3 8H9 Antibody Recognizes The 4Ig Domain Isoform of The Human B7-Homolog 3,4Ig-<br>
B7H3<br>
The following example describes biochemical characterization of the antigen recognized by the 8H9 antibody. The identity of the antigen is the 4Ig domain isoform of the human B7-homolog3,4Ig-B7H3.<br>
Cell Culture. The human neuroblastoma cell line LAN-1 was provided by Dr. Robert Seeger (Children's Hospital of Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA). Human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line HTB82, osteosarcoma cell line U20S, and Burkitt's lymphoma cell line Daudi were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Bethesda, MD). All cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum, 2mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 ug/ml streptomycin at 37°C in a 5% C02 incubator.<br>
Monoclonal Antibodies. Both 8H9 and control MoAb 5F9 are murine IgGl and were produced against human neuroblastoma. They were purified by protein A (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) affinity chromatography before use.<br><br>
Whole Cell Lysates and Western Blot. 8H9-positive cell lines (LAN-1, HTB82 and U20S) and 8H9-negative cell line (Daudi) were grown to ~ 80% confluence. Cells were harvested using 2 mM EDTA and washed with ice-cold PBS.<br>
Native PAGE was performed using NativePAGE Novex Bis-Tris Gel System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were lysed on ice (20 min) in NativePAGE IX Sample Buffer plus 1% detergent (either Triton-XlOO or n-dodecyl-P-D-maltoside (DDM)) and protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche Applied Science, Germany). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4°C. 50 ng whole cell lysates were analyzed by NativePAGE Novex 4-16% Bis-Tris Gels.<br>
SDS-PAGE under nonreducing or reducing conditions was performed using Tris-Glycine Ready Gel System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Briefly, cells were lysed on ice (20 min) in Triton Lysis Buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 50 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor cocktail tablets). The lysates were clarified as above. 25 ~ 50 |^g whole cell lysates were analyzed by 4-15% Tris-HCl Gels.<br>
After electrophoresis in either PAGE, samples were transferred onto Immun-Blot PVDF Membrane (Bio-Rad), blocked for one hour at room temperature (RT) with 10% dry milk in TBST, and incubated with primary antibodies (8H9 at 10-20 ug/ml, 5F9 at 20 ug/ml) for 3 hrs at RT. The membrane was then washed with TBST, and incubated with secondary Peroxidase-conjugated AffiniPure Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (H+L) (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Bands were detected with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (PIERCE, Rockford, IL).<br>
Subcellular Fractionation. For crude membrane preparation, LAN-1 cells were pipetted off the tissue culture dish, washed with ice-cold PBS, and lysed on ice in sucrose buffer (0.25 M sucrose, 5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, and protease inhibitor cocktail tablets) with a Dounce homogenizer (Kontes, Vineland, NJ). Centrifugation for 10 min at 1000 g pelleted all nuclei, as judged microscopically. The 1000 g supernatant was ultracentrifuged at 100,000 g for 30 min in a Beckman L-70K (25,000 rpm, SW41Ti rotor) to give membrane particulate (PI00) and cytosolic (SI00) fractions. Cytosolic fraction was adjusted to 1% Triton, while crude nuclear and membrane fractions were resuspended in Triton Lysis Buffer and clarified before use.<br><br>
8H9 Antigen Affinity Purification. 8H9 antigen was purified from LAN-1 cell extracts by immuno-affinity chromatography using MoAb 8H9. The 8H9 affinity column was prepared using Pierce's Protein G IgG Plus Orientation Kit (PIERCE, Rockford, IL) according to the manufacturer's instructions.<br>
Four mg of LAN-1 whole cell lysates or equivalent membrane fraction prepared as above were incubated overnight at 4°C with 20 ul 8H9-protein G Sepharose (covalently crosslinked with disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS), 3 mg bound 8H9/ml beads). After extensive washing with Triton Lysis Buffer, the column was eluted sequentially with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2 containing 1M NaCl, 0.1 M Glycine-HCl, pH 2.8 and pH 2.0, SDS Sample Buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.005% Bromophenol blue), and SDS Sample Buffer plus boiling in water for 5 min. A small aliquot of eluates was monitored for the presence of 8H9 antigen by Western Blot analysis under nonreducing conditions using 8H9 antibody. One-fourth of the eluates was also analyzed by silver staining (SilverQuest Silver Staining Kit, Invitrogen). Finally, one-half of the 8H9 antigen-positive eluate (0.1 M Glycine-HCl, pH 2.0 eluted fraction) was analyzed by colloidal Coomassie blue staining (GelCode Blue Stain Reagent, PIERCE), and the 8H9 antigen-positive band was sent for mass spectrometric identification by MSKCC Microchemistry and Proteomics Core Facility.<br>
Results<br>
Western Blot Detection of 8H9 Antigen. 8H9 antigen was first detected by 8H9 MoAb under native conditions using NativePAGE Novex Bis-Tris Gel system. A single band was detected in all 8H9-positve cell lines (LAN-1, HTB82 and U20S) but not 8H9-negative cell line (Daudi), as defined by flow cytometry analysis, using 1% nonionic detergent (either Triton-XlOO or DDM) (data not shown). The detection was specific since 5F9, a control MoAb against Ku70 protein, detected a band with a different size (data not shown).<br>
Later, 8H9 antigen was also detected by 8H9 MoAb under nonreducing conditions using Tris-Glycine Ready Gel SDS-PAGE system. Just like under native conditions, a single band (~ 85 KD using Invitrogen SeeBlue Plus2 Pre-Stained Standard as protein molecular weight marker) was detected in all 8H9-positve cell lines (LAN-1, HTB82 and U20S) but not 8H9-negative cell line (Daudi), using 1% Triton Lysis Buffer (Fig. 3, and data not shown). The detection was specific, since 5F9 (an IgGl specific for Ku70) did not detect a band at the<br><br>
same size (data not shown). The size of 8H9 antigen detected is consistent with previous data using 8H9 radio-immunoprecipitation. We were unable to detect 8H9 antigen by Western Blot analysis under reducing conditions (data not shown), suggesting 8H9 recognize a conformational sensitive epitope.<br>
After subcellular fractionation, 8H9 antigen was detected predominantly in membrane fraction (Fig. 3), which is consistent with previous data that 8H9 antigen is a cell surface antigen. Enrichment of 8H9 antigen in the membrane fraction was then undertaken using affinity purification.<br>
Affinity Purification of the 8H9 Antigen. LAN-1 cell line was selected for antigen purification because its relatively high level expression of 8H9 antigen and ability of growing rapidly in tissue culture. 8H9 affinity column was prepared by covalently conjugating Fc portion of 8H9 to protein G of the gel matrix in a defined orientation, allowing exposure of a higher number of free antibody binding sites for antigen binding. Utilizing the NHS-ester DSS in place of the traditional imidoester DMP for crosslinking also significantly prevents the leaching of antibody from the support.<br>
After incubating either LAN-1 (and Daudi as negative control) whole cell lysates or LAN-1 membrane fraction with 8H9-protein G Sepharose overnight, a significant portion (&gt; 50%) of 8H9 antigen was bound to the Sepharose (Fig. 4, and data not shown). 8H9 antigen was eluted specifically and predominantly in 0.1 M Glycine-HCl, pH 2.0 as monitored by Western Blot analysis (Fig. 4, and data not shown), suggesting a very strong interaction between 8H9 antibody and its antigen. After silver staining the same eluate, a clear band was detected accordingly only in LAN-1 cell extracts but not in Daudi cell extracts (Fig. 5). The eluate was also clean enough in the 85 KD vicinity for mass spec analysis. Finally, enough quantity of 8H9 antigen in the band (~ 10 ng, visible with colloidal Coomassie staining, data not shown) was collected and sent for mass spectrometric identification.<br>
Mass spectrometric identification Tryptic digests were subjected to a micro-clean-up procedure using 2 uL bed-volume of Poros 50 R2 (PerSeptive) reversed-phase beads, packed in an Eppendorf gel-loading tip. Mass spectrometry (MALDI-ReTOF) was performed on peptide pools (16 &amp; 30% MeCN) recovered from the RP-microtip column using a Bruker Ultraflex  TOF/TOF   instrument   with   delayed   extraction.      For  mass   fingerprinting,<br><br>
experimental masses (m/z) combined from both MALDI-ReTOF experiments were used to search a non-redundant human protein database (NR; -192,489 entries; NCBI; Bethesda, MD), using the PeptideSearch (Matthias Mann, Max-Planck Institute for Biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany) algorithm. A molecular weight range twice the predicted weight was covered, with a mass accuracy restriction better than 50 ppm, and maximum one missed cleavage site allowed per peptide. Mass spectrometric sequencing (MALDI-TOF-MS/MS) of selected peptides from partially fractionated pools was done on a Bruker Ultraflex TOF/TOF instrument in 'LIFT mode, and the fragment ion spectra taken to search human databases using the MASCOT MS/MS Ion Search program (Matrix Science). Two peptide sequences from the peptide digest were identified: NPVLQQDAHSSVTITPQR (SEQ ID NO. 13), and SPTGAVEVQVPEDPVVALVGTDATLR (SEQ ID NO. 14).<br>
These yielded an unequivocal identification of the antigen as 4Ig-B7H3, the 4Ig domain isoform of the human B7-homolog 3, also named CD276, accession number of NMJ)01024736.1, which codes for a peptide of 534 amino acids, of 57235 kD molecular weight. The gene is located on chromosome 15q24.1. The amino acid sequence of the mature human protein is as follows (with the potential N-glycosylation sites underlined):<br>

To date, the new B7s include B7H1, B7DC, B7H2, B7H3, and B7H4 (see Table 2). Athough their mRNAs are fairly ubiquitously, these protein molecules may be differentially regulated at the post-transcriptional level. B7H3 was first cloned by Chapoval et al5 as a member of the B7 costimulatory family of proteins. Later it was determined to exist as a type I membrane protein with four instead of two Ig-like domains, and hence given the new name of 4Ig-B7H3 (see Table 2).6 In vitro 4Ig-B7H3 was more inhibitory than costimulatory for T-cell activation.6 B7H3 protein expression has been detected in gastric, NSCLC, neuroblasotma and many human tumor cell lines.5'7,8 Human neuroblastoma tumors and cell lines expressing 4Ig-B7H3 may inhibit an NK-mediated immune response.7 B7H3 was found to be expressed on 59% of gastric carcinoma and 100% of gastric adenoma samples,9 and appears to correlate with better survival. In murine models10'11 and human melanoma,12 B7H3 appears to evince anti-tumor response. Murine B7H3 promotes acute and chronic allograft rejection.13 B7H3 probably plays a role in potentiating tumor immunosurveillance while the 4Ig-B7H3 exerts an inhibitory effect.4 It is of interest that 4Ig-B7H3 is the major isoform in most issues except brain and placenta.14 In the placenta B7H3 is a HOkd double band and a 60kd single band by western blot.15 It was most prominent on the exrravillous trophoblast throughout gestation. B7H3 is also thought to play a role in bone formation.16<br>
The identification of 4Ig-B7H3 as the antigen for 8H9 suggests that this glycoprotein is highly expressed among human solid tumors. The epitope that 8H9 recognizes appears to be restricted to tumors versus normal tissues. Based on the mRNA work published to date, one would have inevitably concluded that this antigen is ubiquitous and unsuitable to be a tumor target. We, however, found otherwise. We postulate that antibody directed at 4Ig-B7H3 can<br><br>
be safely administered without major side effects as was seen recently with anti-CD28 antibodies or with anti-CTLA4 where T-cell are targeted. We believe that 4Ig-B7H3 is an immune coinhibitory molecule, and antibodies like 8H9 can modulate its function and potentiate host anti-tumor immune response across a spectrum of human cancers.<br>
EXAMPLE 4 Isolation and Identification of B7H3 Receptors on Activated NK/T Cells Using 8H9<br>
Monoclonal Antibodies<br>
Monoclonal antibody 8H9 recognizes the 4Ig domain isoform of the human B7-homolog 3, 4Ig-B7H3. Human B7-homolog 3 (B7H3), which is also known as CD276, is a molecule which is believed to provide negative signals to the immune system, in particular providing negative signals to NK/T cells, allowing tumor cells to escape immune response. The identified antigen 4Ig-B7H3 targeted by monoclonal antibody 8H9 is the dominant variant form of B7H3 (CD276). 4Ig-B7H3 is a dominantly expressed form of human B7H3 containing a splice variation that duplicates the V-like and C-like Ig domain.14,6<br>
As an immune modulator, both positive and negative immunologic functions of B7H3 have been reported. Reports describing the 2Ig-B7H3 variant demonstrated that the role of B7H3 was to promote T cell activation and IFN-y production by binding to a putative receptor on activated T cells.5 Antitumor response was enhanced by B7H3 expression in murine tumor models.11 In patients, B7H3 positivity in gastric carcinoma was correlated with increased survival.9 Conversely, the coinhibitory role of B7H3 was supported by reports that both 2Ig-B7H3 and 4Ig-B7H3 inhibited T cell proliferation and cytokine production6, that B7H3 preferentially downregulated THl-mediated immune response in B7H3-deficient mice17, and that 4Ig-B7H3 inhibited NK-mediated lysis of neuroblastoma cells by interacting with a putative inhibitory receptor in the surface of NK cells7. The contradictory findings were possibly explained by the antagonistic B7H3 receptors.<br>
The following example describes how B7H3 receptors on activated NK/T cells may be identified and isolated. This experiment has not yet been performed.<br>
B7H3 receptors on NK/T cells are purified by affinity chromatography using both 2Ig-B7H3-Fc and 4Ig-B7H3-Fc as the baits. A B7H3-Fc fusion protein is created in the following<br><br>
manner: 2Ig-B7H3-Fc is purchased from R&amp;D Systems while the cDNA sequence encoding the extracellular domain of human 4Ig-B7H3 is fused to the Fc region of mouse IgG2a using the pFUSE-mlg-G2a-Fc2 expression vector. The fusion protein is expressed in the CG44-CHO cell line and purified by affinity chromatography using protein A Sepharose. Purity and functionality of the fusion protein are evaluated by coomassie blue staining and anti-B7H3 Western blot.<br>
NK/T cells positive for the B7H3 receptor are selected for. The established NK/T cell lines NK92, NKL, NK3.3, YT, TALL-104, as well as activated NK/T cells enriched from fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) are incubated with B7H3-Fc with subsequent staining with fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibody, and analyzed by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). The positive cells are further confirmed by B7H3-Fc Western blot.<br>
The NK/T cells selected as being positive for B7H3 receptors are used for affinity purification. A B7H3-Fc affinity column is prepared by covalently conjugating the Fc portion of B7H3-Fc to protein G on the gel matrix using Protein G IgG Plus Orientation Kit (Pierce Biotechnology). Cell extracts from B7H3 receptor-positive cells are incubated with the Sepharose beads on the column. The column is washed extensively and eluted. The presence and purity of B7H3 receptor is monitored by B7H3-Fc Western blot and silver staining. B7H3 receptor-positive bands of over 20 ng are sent for mass spectrometric identification.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Use of the 8H9 Monoclonal Antibody For Blockage of Inhibitory B7H3 (CD276) and Subsequent Enhanced NK/T Cell-Mediated Cytolysis of Tumor Cells<br>
Immune responses to tumors have been found to be enhanced by blocking inhibitory receptors on T cells with monoclonal antibodies specific to said inhibitory receptors. A known example of this phenomenon is the enhancement of immune response through the blockade of CTLA-4 inhibitory receptor on T cells using anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies. The following example describes how a blockade of B7H3 receptor on NK/T cells with 8H9 antibody sensitizes tumor cells to NK/T cell-mediated toxicity. This experiment has not yet been performed.<br>
17<br><br>
Cell-Mediated Cytolysis (Chromium release) Assay: For the NK cell-mediated cytolysis assay, human CML cell line K562 is chosen for the target cells. As demonstrated by FACS analysis, K562 has low expression of HLA-1 and B7H3 proteins. Rhabdomyosarcoma HTB82 cells are used as a control. In a standard 4 hour 51Cr-release assay, while only less than 10% of rhabdomyosarcoma HTB82 cells were lysed by NK92 cells, up to 60% of K562 cells were effectively killed by NK92 effector cells. One group of the target cell population of K562 is transfected with nucleic acids encoding for the splice forms 4Ig-B7H3 in order that B7H3 be overexpressed in this cell population. The K562 target cells are radiolabeled with 100 uCi slCr/106 cells for 1 hour at 37°C. The monoclonal antibody 8H9 is incubated with the transfected target cells while controls are incubated with HLA-1 mAb HB95, and cytolysis assays are performed using effector cells positive for the coinhibitory B7H3 receptor. NK92 effector cells are incubated in 96-well plates with target cells in 250 ul for 4 hours at 37°C. Cytolytic activity of NK92 effector cells against B7H3 transfected K562 will be decreased vis-a-vis non-transfected K562. Restored cytolytic activities will be observed after blocking of the coinhibitory B7H3.<br>
