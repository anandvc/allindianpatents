				<td>Actuator control method Background of the invention<br>
The invention relates to the field of wireless, radio frequency remote control of actuators driving a moving device of the building of closure (door, gate or window) , solar protection, multimedia projection screen, or ventilation door type.<br>
More specifically, the invention relates to a synchronized control method for actuators driving a moving device of the building of closure (door, gate or window), solar protection, multimedia projection screen, or ventilation flap type, a control correction method, a programming method and an installation for controlling such actuators.<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a faster and more uniform reaction of the actuators, including in situations of radio environments disturbed by stray signals or by a range limit distance.<br>
The invention applies in particular to the case of remote control transmitters and receivers for which pressing a control key on the transmitter provokes the repeated sending of a signal containing, in a frame, a number of information<br>
items including that of the control activated. The sending duration conditions an action performed by the remote control receiver. The other information items contained in the frame are, for example, an identifier enabling the remote control receiver to recognize the transmitter, and therefore to interpret and/or execute the command if it is an authorized transmitter. It can also be a rolling code.<br>
Description of the prior art<br>
An example of operation by prolonged pressing on a radio remote control key is given in US patent 6,359,399, column 5, lines 33-48: the activation of the actuator by the receiver takes place when the latter receives a signal, and for its part, the transmitter transmits said signal as long as the user is pressing on a control button.<br>
However, one problem associated with radio transmission is the possibility of interference resulting in poor reception of a signal sent. It appears that patent application JP 2002-97879 (Sanwa) describes a similar issue.<br>
Furthermore, and without it being an interference issue, there is also the problem in such installations of a transmitter intended for overall control of a number of receivers. Some of these remote receivers can be at the range limit, and the likelihood of failure to receive certain repeated frames becomes high.<br>
The most significant consequences of poor reception are then particularly apparent in the case of operation of a set of products: for example, all the actuators do not start simultaneously if those connected to receivers remote from<br>
the transmitter do not correctly receive the first frame or frames. Similarly, probably the same products risk being switched off prematurely if the last frames are not received correctly. Whereas the problem is virtually imperceptible in the case of a unitary control, it is clearly revealed by the differences in positioning between moving products in a general control situation. The result is a source of visual dissatisfaction for users, and even more so for architects, with their keen desire for facade harmony.<br>
US patent 5,469,152 discloses a control device of an audio system in which a press on a control key is interpreted differently according to whether it is pressed for less than two seconds or longer than two seconds.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
By remedying the abovementioned drawbacks, the invention also presents the advantage of enabling the installation to be programmed more quickly, when a professional installer has a dedicated programming tool.<br>
The control method comprises:<br>
a  step  for  inserting  into  the  frame  sent  a  time<br>
information item representative of the control generation<br>
duration,<br>
a step for extracting this time information item,<br>
a  step  for  computing  the  application  start  and/or<br>
application end instant of the control, using the time<br>
information item.<br>
The time information item can be a frame number or a number representative of the control generation duration.<br>
The step for computing the application start and/or application end instant of a control using the time information item can include a step for computing the theoretical control generation start instant and the control application start instant can be determined by applying a predetermined time offset to this instant.<br>
The step for inserting into the frame sent a time information item representative of the control generation duration can also include the insertion of a control generation end indication and the step for computing the application start and/or application end instant of a control using the time information item can comprise:<br>
a step for activating the actuator according to the control received and for measuring the activation duration,<br>
a step for receiving a control generation end indication, a step for extracting data for determining the control generation duration until the end of control generation, - a step for comparing the control generation duration up to the end of the control generation with the activation duration.<br>
Depending on the result of the comparison step:<br>
a step for extending the control application duration can be undertaken when the activation duration is less than the control generation duration, or<br>
a correction step can terminate application of the current control and provokes the temporary application of a reverse effect control.<br>
The duration of the extension step or the duration of the correction step is equal to the absolute difference of the quantities compared in the comparison step.<br>
The method of programming for a unit for programming actuators driving a moving device of the building of closure (door, gate or window) , solar protection, multimedia projection screen, or ventilation flap type includes the steps of the control method according to the invention, and the time information item contained in the initial frame presents a particular value.<br>
In the programming method, the particular value can correspond to at least the duration of generation of a control needed to validate the reception of a programming control.<br>
The installation comprises a radio frequency remote control transmitter, a radio frequency remote control receiver connected to an actuator driving a moving device of the building of closure (door, gate or window), solar protection, multimedia projection screen, or ventilation flap type, in which the prolonged press on a control key of the transmitter provokes the repeated sending of a frame containing the code of the control key pressed and in which the reception of said frames provokes an action of the receiver on the actuator related to the frame reception duration, wherein the transmitter includes a program inserting a time information item relating to the press duration in each frame relating to one and the same press on a control key of the transmitter and wherein the receiver includes a program extracting this time information item and using it to create the control to<br>
be applied to the actuator according to the method of the invention.<br>

Description of the preferred embodiments<br>
An INS installation in which the method according to the invention is used is first described with reference to figure 1.<br>
The handheld remote control transmitter constitutes a transmission unit TRU comprising a control keypad KBU, a microcontroller CPU and a radio frequency transmitter RFU, provided with a sending antenna ANT. The keypad KBU has three control keys such as an up key UP, a stop key ST and a down key DN, acting, for example, on electrical contacts that are not shown. The keypad is connected to the microcontroller CPU by a first bus BUS1. The microcontroller is connected to the transmitter RFU by a second bus BUS2. The handheld remote control transmitter is powered by a battery BAT, the negative pole of which is connected to the electrical ground GND of the transmission unit TRU.<br>
The keypad KBU is also connected, via the first bus BUS1, to a wake-up control unit WCU, the purpose of which is to activate the processing means formed by the microcontroller CPU and by the radio frequency transmitter RFU when a key of the keypad is pressed. In the assembly of figure 1, this unit provokes the closure of a switch SW linking the positive pole of the battery BAT to the positive power supply wire VDD of the processing means. Thus, the positive pole of the battery BAT is therefore connected permanently only to the positive power supply wire VCC of the keypad and of the wake-up control unit WCU.<br>
In variants of the embodiment, known to those skilled in the art, the control unit is included in the same integrated circuit as the microcontroller or even acts on a microcontroller wake-up signal and/or of the transmitter rather than on their power supply. The transmitter can also be woken up in a second step by the microcontroller.<br>
The signal sent by the antenna ANT constitutes a radio wave or signal RFW, which is sensed and interpreted by a reception unit RCU, which pilots an actuator ACT which drives a moving element of the building MOB. The reception unit is linked to the 230 V 50 Hz alternating current mains supply or to an electrical power source that is not shown.<br>
The reception unit RCU comprises a radio frequency receiver RFR, a clock CK for computing time delays, various computation means CALC1 and CALC2 activated respectively at the start of reception and at the end of reception.<br>
One and the same reception unit RCU can be controlled by different transmission units TRU and, conversely, one and the same transmission unit TRU can control a number of reception units RCU, in particular remote units, which raises the problems stated above.<br>
Certain parameters of a reception unit can be adjusted from the transmission unit. For example, it is possible to enter into a particular programming mode by a particular press on the keys of the keypad. Thus, simultaneously pressing the up and down keys UP and DN provokes the repeated sending of a particular programming control PROG. When the reception unit RCU receives this control PROG for a duration longer than a given threshold (for example, 10 seconds), it enters into a<br>
programming mode. The programming mode relates, for example, to the memorizing of specific positions of the actuator ACT, such as the end-of-travel positions. The duration threshold is explained by the need to exclude any unwanted control (keying error, unit being played with by a child, etc.) .<br>
It is advantageous to be able to enter into a programming mode by using a standard transmission unit, such as TRU, that has few keys and is inexpensive to buy.  It is, however, possible for the professional installer to have a more sophisticated  programming  unit,  including,  for  example, dedicated programming keys. Thus, pressing just one of these keys sends the control PROG, via a radio signal. However, since it is the receiver,  and not the transmitter, that checks that the duration of the control PROG is longer than the  fixed threshold,  there  is no  time  saving  for the installer. In the installation according to the invention, the installer has a programming unit PRU sending a radio signal RFP to overcome this drawback.<br>
There is at least one operating mode of the installation in which the activation of the actuator is normally continued only as long as a control key is pressed and the signal corresponding to this control is sent, in a continuously repeated fashion.<br>
Figure 2 gives the example of such an action and diagrammatically represents the signal sent or received.<br>
The control action of the user (pressing the UP key) begins at the instant CAT11 and ends at the instant CAT12 (releasing the UP key). The difference between these two instants represents the press duration CAT. During this duration, a<br><br>
frame containing the code of the up control UPC is sent repeatedly, for example every 140 milliseconds. The frame contains other binary information, such as an identification number ID of the transmission unit.<br>
In figure 2, eight frames have been sent by the transmission unit TRU while the up control key UP is pressed. However, not all these frames are received by the reception unit RCU, if the latter is remote or if the transmission is affected by interference. The frames sent and not received are represented by broken lines. Such is the case with the frames 5 and 6 in the figure. Thus, at the instant TO, the reception unit notes that it is no longer receiving the signal, and initiates a time delay of duration DLN, in order to check that the signal has actually disappeared. The duration of this time delay can span a number of frames. In the case represented, the time delay DLN therefore makes it possible to avoid the effects of the break in transmission and obtain a reception duration very close to the actual press duration. Obviously, if no signal is received during the time delay DLN, then it is possible to apply a reverse direction operation corresponding to this duration that would then have wrongly extended the preceding operation. However, if the frames numbered 7 and 8 are not received, and not the frames numbered 5 and 6, then the method represented in figure 2 will deduce at best that the sending is completed on the sixth frame.<br>
The invention makes it possible to remedy this type of drawback of the installation by appropriate methods and means for the insertion, recognition and operation of a time indication in the frame sent. This time information item is a<br>
frame number and/or a number representative of the press duration.<br>
In itself, the technique of numbering frames for sending is known in the state of the art. US patent 5,090,029 uses such a numbering in a communication method sharing one and the same network resource with time slots allocated to the different participants, which is the specific feature of the so-called CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) systems. The latter get their bearings from the frame number. As for US patent application 2002/0164029, it uses the frame number for encrypting or decrypting information, or quite simply to correctly reconstruct a complete message when it is divided into packets on transmission via different channels.<br>
Also known from the state of the art is to provide a time indication (sending time or "time stamp") in a frame, in particular in packet-mode telecommunication cases. US patent 6,449,290 combines frame counting with time-oriented content. US patent 4,894,823, cited in the above patent, describes a network in which each packet of frames contains a start frame containing a time indication of entry into the node of the network and updated when forwarded by the network node.<br>
Figure 3 represents a stream of frames in the case of an installation according to the invention, the frames this time being provided with a time indication as will be seen in figure 4, described below. As in the case of figure 2, the press on the up control key UP begins at the instant CAP21 and ends at the instant CAP22. Eight frames are sent during this action on the part of the user in the example represented. However, there is poor reception for both the first two frames and the eighth frame.<br>
According to a first embodiment, the invention is first used to enable good synchronization of all the actuators on startup. To overcome a possible transmission failure, the designer has provided for the startup of any actuator to take place at the end of the fourth frame sent (for a frame of 140 ms, this amounts to supporting a delay of around half a second). A time delay DLY is associated with this value.<br>
At the instant Tl, the receiver has therefore received its first frame. Based on the time indication contained in this frame, it computes the theoretical instant of the start of sending TSTART, close to the actual instant CAT21 of pressing on the control key. From the value of the time delay duration DLY, it computes the time remaining before activating the control UPC to be applied to the actuator. The durations can be expressed as a number of frames: for example, the duration DLY corresponds to an integer number NSTART of frame periods, in this case NSTART = 4, but it is also possible to take a non-integer value. In practice, the time delay corresponds to a counter, the initial content of which is fixed not by the theoretical value of DLY but by this value minus the time already elapsed between TSTART and the instant Tl of processing of the first frame received.<br>
Figure 5 describes the control method according to the first embodiment of the invention in block diagram form. A first action on the part of the user UA1 (at the instant CAT11 or CAT21) consists in pressing on a control key of the keypad of the transmission unit TRU. The effect of this action is to power the processing means if it is a handheld unit and/or to wake up the microcontroller, in the step 501. In the step 502, a frame number FN is inserted into the content of the<br>
The frame also contains an end of press frame number FN*. The number FN* can be set to 1, but it can also be equal to the frame number FN, counted from the start of sending. The end of press frame can also contain the press duration information item CAT.<br>
In the step 505, the preceding step is repeated one or more times, with the end frame number FN* incremented. The press duration information item no longer changes in these repeated sendings. After a predetermined number M of sendings, the transmission unit goes to the step 506, which terminates the sending.<br>
The invention, in its first embodiment, therefore favors the sending of one and preferably several frames after the control key has been released. This sending appears in figure 3 in the form of the frame UPC. An end of press frame is distinguished from a control frame.<br>
Figure 4A represents a control frame Fll corresponding to the stream of frames sent while the up control key UP is pressed. The frame contains the code of the up control UPC, an identifier ID or other binary information necessary for authentication, and a frame number FN. Figure 4A also represents a specific control frame F12 corresponding to the stream of frames sent while the up control key UP is released. The frame contains the code of the complementary control X of the up control UPC, and an end frame number FN*. The content of the end frame number is initialized with the control X or increments the last number FN of the control UPC.<br>
Figure 4B represents a control frame F21 corresponding to the stream of frames sent while the up control key UP is pressed. The frame contains the code of the up control UPC, an identifier ID or other binary information necessary for authentication, and a press duration information item CAT, zero if it is the first frame. Figure 4B also represents a specific control frame F22 corresponding to the stream of frames sent while the up control key UP is released. The frame contains the code of the complementary control X of the up control UPC, and the press duration information item (in this case constant) CAT.<br>
Figure 4C differs from figure 4A in that the code of the control UPC contained in a control frame F31 is maintained in an end of press frame F32. However, the frame contains an indicator SB in the high state when there is a press, and in the low state when the press is released.<br>
Figure 4D differs in the same way from figure 4B.<br>
Figure 6 describes the synchronization method represented in figure 3, starting with the reception RF1 of a first frame received. This method is executed by each unit similar to the reception unit RCU and for which the transmission unit TRU is an authorized unit. To simplify, the authentication steps are not represented.<br>
In a step 601, the control contained in this first frame is extracted, decoded and interpreted. However, it is not immediately executed.<br>
In the next step 602, the reception unit RCU extracts from the frame the time information formed either by the frame number FN or the press duration information CAT.<br>
The step 603 activates the computation of the theoretical sending start instant TSTART described previously. The reception unit then knows what duration must be measured between the current instant and the control activation instant.<br>
In the step 604, the reception unit waits for the above duration to elapse. If necessary, other frames received during this time delay confirm or correct the duration.<br>
In the step 605, the delay being reached, the actuator ACT is activated, in the direction corresponding to the control received. All the actuators connected to different units therefore start roughly at the same instant, even for remote units not having received several frames.<br>
In the step 606, the activation is maintained as long as the signal is received.<br>
The next two steps correspond to the case where the method behaves as represented in figure 2, when the transmission is corrupted while the control is already activated.<br>
The non-radio reception of the signal is represented by the arrow RF2.<br>
This non-reception initiates the step 607 in which a time delay DLN is activated.<br>
The step 608 tests the reception of a signal during this time delay. The non-reception of a new frame during this duration will be considered as an effective stop of sending at the start of the time delay DLN. Also, the reception unit then stops activating the actuator.<br>
Preferably, the duration DLN is chosen to be equal to the duration DLY: thus, the delay taken for starting is automatically compensated.<br>
However, the situation can also be differentiated according to whether the signal received originates from a transmission unit TRU controlled by a logic control system or controlled by a human user.<br>
In the former case, it is preferable to compensate the time delay duration DLY with the time delay duration DLN. In the second case, the user stops pressing on the control key when in the required situation. The delay taken on starting is unimportant with regard to the current situation. It is then preferable simply to compensate DLN, if necessary, with a reverse movement of the same duration.<br>
The step 609 is initiated if, during the time delay DLN, a new valid signal is sensed. The step includes a validity test regarding whether the signal belongs to the preceding stream of frames. This test is applied not only to the code of the control sent, but also, and above all, to the time indication contained in the frame. Based on this time indication (frame number and/or press duration) and the time elapsed in the time delay DLN, the reception unit RCU determines whether the new frame received indeed belongs to the preceding stream of frames, interrupted by poor conditions, or if it is a new<br>
control. If it is still the continuation of the same control, the step 606 is repeated. Otherwise, it is a new control, which is processed as such, with, if necessary, the actuator being stopped.<br>
Figure 7 represents a synchronization method according to a second embodiment of the invention, in which there is no desire to obtain synchronized operation of actuators obeying one and the same general command, but in which it is desired for the moving elements MOB driven by these actuators to be subject to an identical displacement, or at least a very similar displacement, after a control. The displacements are then matched by correction at end of movement.<br>
This correction incorporates both the effects of poor reception at the start of sending and of poor reception at the end of sending.<br>
In figure 7, the time information item consists of the control frame number FN and the control end frame number FN*.<br>
In the step 701, the control received is interpreted, as in the step 601.<br>
In the step 702, the frame number is extracted for use in the step 703 to determine the theoretical sending start instant TSTART.<br>
Unlike the method of figure 6, this time the actuator is activated directly in the step 704 according to the control received. In this step 704, the reception unit also activates a measurement of the actuator activation duration AAT, using<br>
the clock CK. The order of the steps 703 and 704 can be swapped.<br>
In the step 705, a signal interpreted as forming a control end frame (of type F12 or F32) is received. The control end frame number FN* is extracted in the step 706, and used to compute the theoretical end of sending instant TSTOP.<br>
The different phases described above are also represented in the right-hand part of figure 3, in which the first control end frame UPC* is received correctly. The interpretation takes place at the instant T3 from which the instant TSTOP is identified and at which the actuator activation duration AAT is measured.<br>
In the step 707 of the correction method, the reception unit RCU computes the theoretical control duration TCT (difference between the theoretical sending end and sending start instants TSTOP and TSTART) and compares it with the actuator activation duration AAT.<br>
The step 709 is executed if the theoretical control duration is greater than the activation duration. It is then necessary to extend the latter by a value equal to the difference.<br>
The step 710 is executed if the theoretical control duration is less than the activation duration. It is then necessary to stop the current operation and undertake a reverse operation of the actuator of a duration equal to the difference.<br>
Figure 8 represents a variant of the synchronization method described above. In this variant, the time information item used is the indication of the duration of the press on the<br>
control key CAT. The variant therefore applies to frames as shown in figure 4B or figure 4D.<br>
After a step 801 for interpretation of the control received in a first frame correctly received, the actuator is directly activated according to the control received, during the next step 802. As in the step 705, this activation of the actuator is accompanied by that of a clock measuring the activation duration AAT.<br>
In the step 803, a new frame is received, this time containing an end of control indication, like the frames F22 or F42 of figure 4. The reception unit then switches to the step 805 in which the time information item CAT contained in this end of control frame is extracted. It then has the actual press duration, which is compared to the activation duration AAT during the step 805. In the step 806, if the key press duration CAT is greater than the actuator activation duration AAT, then the current control is extended by a duration equal to the difference.<br>
In the step 807, if the key press duration CAT is less than the actuator activation duration AAT, then the current control is stopped. The reception unit then activates a reverse direction control of a duration equal to the difference. The steps 806 and 807 therefore include the computation of the instant at which application of the control applied in the step 802 ends.<br>
Figure 9 now represents a method of programming according to a third embodiment of the invention. The method applies to the programming unit PRU, and more particularly to the programming controls that can be sent from this unit while<br><br>
being compatible with programming controls sent from transmission units TRU. The press on a particular PRU key provokes the sending of the control PROG. The programming method differs from the sending method of figure 5 solely by the content of the step 502. In figure 9, the corresponding step 902 is the only one shown, the steps 901 and 903-906 being like the steps 501 and 503-506 of figure 5.<br>
In the step 902, the time indication introduced into the frame is deliberately offset by a quantity equivalent to the press time needed for confirmation of the control PROG by the receiver. For example, the initial press duration information item is introduced as being equal to 10 seconds, although the press has only just begun. Alternatively, the number of frames is set to the initial value 100 (for frames of 100 ms duration) . In the subsequent steps, it is this initial value different from the normal initial value that is incremented.<br>
Thus, the reception unit RCU receiving such a signal and provided  with  the  means  and  methods  described  above, considers that the press duration satisfies the required criteria and immediately accepts the programming control PROG.<br><br><br><br>
Claims<br>
1.	A method of controlling actuators driving a moving device<br>
of the building of closure (door, gate or window) , solar<br>
protection, multimedia projection screen, or ventilation flap<br>
type, comprising the generation of a control to be executed,<br>
the sending of a signal repeating a frame including the code<br>
of the control to be executed and the reception of this<br>
signal for application of the control to the actuator as long<br>
as the generation of the control lasts, which comprises:<br>
a  step  for  inserting  into  the  frame  sent  a  time<br>
information item representative of the control generation<br>
duration,<br>
a step for extracting this time information item,<br>
a  step  for  computing  the  application  start  and/or<br>
application end instant of the control, using the time<br>
information item.<br>
2.	The control method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the time<br>
information item is a frame number.<br>
3.	The control method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the time<br>
information item is a number representative of the control<br>
generation duration.<br>
4.	A method of synchronizing actuator control as claimed in<br>
one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the step<br>
for computing the application start and/or application end<br>
instant of a control using the time information item includes<br>
a step for computing the theoretical control generation start<br>
instant  and  the  control  application  start  instant  is<br>
determined by applying a predetermined time offset to this<br>
instant.<br><br>
5. The actuator control synchronization method as claimed in the preceding claim, wherein the step for inserting into the frame sent a time information item representative of the control generation duration also includes the insertion of a control generation end indication (504, 505) and the step for computing the application start and/or application end instant of a control using the time information item comprises:<br>
a step (704, 802) for activating the actuator according to the control received and for measuring the activation duration,<br>
a step (705, 803) for receiving a control generation end indication,<br>
- a step (706, 804) for extracting data (FN*, CAT) for determining the control generation duration until the end of control generation (TCT, CAT),<br>
a step (708,  805)  for comparing the control generation duration up to the end of the control generation (TCT, CAT) with the activation duration (AAT).<br>
6. The actuator control synchronization method as claimed in the preceding claim, wherein, depending on the result of the comparison step (708, 805):<br>
a step (709, 806) for extending the control application duration is undertaken when the activation duration is less than the control generation duration, or a correction step (710, 807) terminates application of the current control and provokes the temporary application of a reverse effect control.<br>
7.	The actuator control synchronization method as claimed in<br>
the preceding claim, wherein the duration of the extension<br>
step or the duration of the correction step is equal to the<br>
absolute  difference  of  the  quantities  compared  in  the<br>
comparison step.<br>
8.	A method of  programming  for  a unit  for programming<br>
actuators driving a moving device of the building of closure<br>
(door,  gate  or  window),  solar  protection,  multimedia<br>
projection screen, or ventilation flap type, which includes the steps of the method of claim 1, and wherein the time information item contained in the initial frame presents a particular value.<br>
9.	The programming method as claimed in the preceding claim,<br>
wherein the particular value corresponds to at least the<br>
duration of generation of a control needed to validate the<br>
reception of a programming control.<br>
10.	An  installation  comprising  a  radio  frequency remote<br>
control  transmitter,  a  radio  frequency  remote  control<br>
receiver connected to an actuator driving a moving device of<br>
the building of  closure  (door,  gate  or window),  solar<br>
protection, multimedia projection screen, or ventilation flap<br>
type, in which the prolonged press on a control key of the<br>
transmitter  provokes  the  repeated  sending  of  a  frame<br>
containing the code of the control key pressed and in which<br>
the reception of said frames provokes an action of the<br>
receiver on the actuator related to the frame reception<br>
duration,<br>
wherein the transmitter includes a program inserting a time information item relating to the press duration in each frame relating to one and the same press on a control key of the<br>
transmitter and wherein the receiver includes a program extracting this time information item and using it to create the control to be applied to the actuator according to one of the methods of claims 1 to 9.</td>
