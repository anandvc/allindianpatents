				<td>The present invention relates to a 2-azetidinone compound of formula (I) and process for preparing the same.<br>
This invention relates to 2-azetidinone derivatives, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, solvates of such salts and prodrugs thereof. These 2-azetidinones possess cholesterol absorption inhibitory activity and are accordingly of value in the treatment of disease states associated with hyperlipidaemic conditions. They are therefore useful in methods of treatment of a warm-blooded animal, such as man. The invention also relates to processes for the manufacture of said 2-azetidinone derivatives, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to their use in the manufacture of medicaments to inhibit cholesterol absorption in a warm-blooded animal, such as man. A further aspect of this invention relates to the use of the compounds of the invention in the treatment of dyslipidemic conditions.<br>
Atherosclerotic coronary artery disease is a major cause of death and morbidity in the western world as well as a significant drain on healthcare resources. It is well-known that hyperlipidaemic conditions associated with elevated concentrations of total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol are major risk factors for cardiovascular atherosclerotic disease (for instance "Coronary Heart Disease: Reducing the Risk; a Worldwide View" Assman G., CarmenaR. Cullen P. et al; Circulation 1999,100, 1930-1938 and "Diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease: A Statement for Healthcare Professionals from the American Heart Association" Grundy S, Benjamin I., Burke G., et al; Circulation, 1999, 100, 1134-46).<br>
The concentration of plasma cholesterol depends on the integrated balance of endogenous and exogenous pathways of cholesterol metabolism. In the endogenous pathway, cholesterol is synthesized by the liver and extra hepatic tissues and enters the circulation as lipoproteins or is secreted into bile. In the exogenous pathway cholesterol from dietary and biliary sources is absorbed in the intestine and enters the circulation as component of chylomicrons. Alteration of either pathway will affect the plasma concentration of cholesterol.<br>
The precise mechanism by which cholesterol is absorbed from the intestine is however not clear. The original hypothesis has been that cholesterol is crossing the intestine by unspecific diffusion. But more recent studies are suggesting that there are specific transporters involved in the intestinal cholesterol absorption. (See for instance New molecular targets for cholesterol-lowering therapy Izzat, N.N., Deshazer, M.E. and Loose-Mitchell D.S. JPET 293:315-320,2000.)<br><br>
A clear association between reduction of total cholesterol and (LDL) cholesterol and decreased instance of coronary artery disease has been established, and several classes of pharmaceutical agents are used to control serum cholesterol. There major options to regulate plasma cholesterol include (i) blocking the synthesis of cholesterol by agents such as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, for example statins such as simvastatin and fluvastatin, which also by up-regulation of LDL-receptors will promote the cholesterol removal from the plasma; (ii) blocking the bile acid reabsorption by specific agents resulting in increased bile acid excretion and synthesis of bile acids from cholesterol with agents such as bile acid binders, such as resms e.g. cholestyramine and cholestipol; and (iii) by blocking the intestinal uptake of cholesterol by selective cholesterol absorption inhibitors. High density lipoprotein (HDL) elevating agents such as fibrates and nicotinic acid analogues have also been employed.<br>
Even with the current diverse range of therapeutic agents, a significant proportion of the hypercholesterolaemic population is unable to reach target cholesterol levels, or drug interactions or drug safety preclude the long term use needed to reach the target levels. Therefore there is still a need to develop additional agents that are more efficacious and are better tolerated.<br>
Compounds possessing such cholesterol absorption inhibitory activity have been described, see for instance the compounds described in WO 93/02048, WO 94/17038, WO 95/08532, WO 95/26334, WO 95/35277, WO 96/16037, WO 96/19450, WO 97/16455, WO 02/50027, WO 02/50060, WO 02/50068, WO 02/50090, WO 02/66464, US 5756470, US 5767115 and US RE37721.<br>
The present invention is based on the discovery that certain benzotniazepine and benzothiadiazepine compounds surprisingly inhibit cholesterol absorption. Such properties are expected to be of value in the treatment of disease states associated with hyperlipidaemic conditions. The compounds of the present invention are not disclosed in any of the above applications and we have surprisingly found that these compound possess beneficial efficacious, metabolic and toxicological profiles that make them particularly suitable for in vivo administration to a warm blooded animal, such as man. In particular certain compounds of the present invention have a low degree of absorption compared to the compounds of the prior art whilst retaining their ability to inhibit cholesterol absorption. Accordingly there is provided a compound of formula (I):<br>

In this specification the term "alkyl" includes both straight and branched chain alkyl groups but references to individual alkyl groups such as "propyl" are specific for the straight chain version only. For example, "Cj-ioalkyl", "Ci.galkyl" and "Chalky!" include propyl, isopropyl and f-butyl. However, references to individual alkyl groups such as 'propyl1 are specific for the straight chained version only and references to individual branched chain alkyl groups such as 'isopropyl' are specific for the branched chain version only. A similar convention applies to other radicals, for example "phenylCi-galkyl" would include benzyl, 1-phenylethyl and 2-phenylethyl. The term "halo" refers to fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo.<br>
Where optional substituents are chosen from "one or more" groups it is to be understood that this definition includes all substituents being chosen from one of the specified groups or the substituents being chosen from two or more of the specified groups.<br>
A "heterocyclyl" is a saturated, partially saturated or unsaturated, mono or bicyclic ring containing 3-12 atoms of which at least one atom is chosen from nitrogen, sulphur or oxygen, which may, unless otherwise specified, be carbon or nitrogen linked, wherein a -CH^-roup can optionally be replaced by a -C(O)- or a ring sulphur atom may be optionally uxidised to form the S-oxides. Particularly a "heterocyclyl" is a saturated, partially saturated or unsaturated, mono or bicyclic ring containing 5 or 6 atoms of which at least one atom is chosen from nitrogen, sulphur or oxygen, which may, unless otherwise specified, be carbon or nitrogen linked, wherein a -CEfe- group can optionally be replaced by a -C(O)- or a ring sulphur atom may be optionally oxidised to form S-oxide(s).

It will be appreciated that certain of the various ring substituents in the compounds of the present invention may be introduced by standard aromatic substitution reactions or generated by conventional functional group modifications either prior to or immediately following the processes mentioned above, and as such are included in the process aspect of the invention. Such reactions and modifications include, for example, introduction of a substituent by means of an aromatic substitution reaction, reduction of substituents, alkylation of substituents and oxidation of substituents. The reagents and reaction conditions for such procedures are well known in the chemical art. Particular examples of aromatic substitution reactions include the introduction of a nitro group using concentrated nitric acid, the introduction of an acyl group using, for example, an acyl halide and Lewis acid (such as aluminium trichloride) under Friedel Crafts conditions; the introduction of an alkyl group using an alky] halide and Lewis acid (such as aluminium trichloride) under Friedel Crafts conditions; and the introduction of a halogeno group. Particular examples of modifications include the reduction of a nitro group to an amino group by for example, catalytic<br>
â€¢ 31-<br>
hydrogenation with a nickel catalyst or treatment with iron in the presence of hydrochloric acid with healing; oxidation of alkylthio to alkylsulphinyl or aQcylsulphonyl.<br>
It will also be appreciated that in some of the reactions mentioned herein it may be necessary/desirable to protect any sensitive groups in the compounds. The instances where protection is necessary or desirable and suitable methods for protection are known to those skilled in the art. Conventional protecting groups may be used in accordance with standard practice (for illustration see T.W. Green, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley and Sons, 1999). Thus, if reactants include groups such as amino, carboxy or hydroxy it may be desirable to protect the group in some of the reactions mentioned herein.<br>
A suitable protecting group for an amino or alkylamino group is, for example, an acyl group, for example an alkanoyl group such as acetyl, an alkoxycarbonyl group, for example a methoxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl or r-butoxycarbonyl group, an arylmethoxycarbonyl group, for example benzyloxycarbonyl, or an aroyl group, for example benzoyl. The deprotection conditions for the above protecting groups necessarily vary with the choice of protecting group. Thus, for example, an acyl group such as an alkanoyl or alkoxycarbonyl group or an aroyl group may be removed for example, by hydrolysis with a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example lithium or sodium hydroxide. Alternatively an acyl group such as a f-butoxycarbonyi group may be removed, for example, by treatment with a suitable acid as hydrochloric, sulphuric or phosphoric acid or trifluoroacetic acid and an arylmethoxycarbonyl group such as a benzyloxycarbonyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon, or by treatment with a Lewis acid for example boron tris(trifluoroacetate). A suitable alternative protecting group for a primary amino group is, for example, a phthaloyl group which may be removed by treatment with an alkylamine, for example dimethylaminopropylamine, or with hydrazine. A suitable protecting group for a hydroxy group is, for example, an acyl group, for example an alkanoy] group such as acetyl, an aroyl group, for example benzoyl, or an arylmethyl group, for example benzyl. The deprotection conditions for the above protecting groups will necessarily vary with the choice of protecting group. Thus, for example, an acyl group such as an alkanoyl or an aroyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrolysis with a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example lithium or sodium hydroxide. Alternatively an arylmethyl group such as a benzyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon.<br>
-32-<br>
A suitable protecting group for a carboxy group is, for example, an esterifying group, for example a methyl or an ethyl group which may be removed, for example, by hydrolysis with a base such as sodium hydroxide, or for example a f-butyl group which may be removed, for example, by treatment with an acid, for example an organic acid such as trifluoroacetic acid, or for example a benzyl group which may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon.<br>
The protecting groups may be removed at any convenient stage in the synthesis using conventional techniques well known in the chemical art.<br>
As stated hereinbefore the compounds defined in the present invention possess cholesterol absorption inhibitory activity. These properties may be assessed, using the following biological test. In vivo testing of cholesterol absorption inhibitors<br>
C57BL/6 female mice were maintained on regular chow diet and housed in individual cages to collect faeces. Mice were fasted for 3 hours and then gavaged with vehicle or compound. Half an hour later the mice were gavaged with radiolabelled cholesterol. Two or six hours after the H C-cholesterol gavage blood samples were taken via the tail and plasma prepared to determine how much cholesterol were absorbed. 24 hours after the gavage of 14 C-cholesterol the mice were bled to death and plasma were prepared for analysis. Faeces were collected for 24 hours to assess absorption efficiency. References<br>
