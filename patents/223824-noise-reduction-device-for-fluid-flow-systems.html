				<td>NOISE REDUCTION DEVICE FOR FLUID FLOW SYSTEMS<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO EARLIER APPLICATIONS<br>
This patent application claims priority from United States Patent<br>
Application No. 10/104,447, filed on March 22, 2002, entitled "Noise<br>
Reduction Device for Fluid Flow Systems".<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Technical Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to noise reduction devices in fluid flow systems<br>
and more particularly to a differential velocity device for use downstream of a<br>
valve in a fluid flow system.<br>
Description of Related Art<br>
Control valves are used in process industries to control flow of fluids,<br>
both liquids and compressible fluids. Aerodynamically generated noise is<br>
inherent in the throttling process of gases and vapors. Throttling occurs by<br>
opening or closing a selected valve in a fluid flow system.<br>
It is generally accepted that exposure to high levels of noise can<br>
damage the hearing of individuals working near fluid flow systems. In the<br>
United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)<br>
limits noise levels of worker exposure for the purpose of hearing conservation.<br>
For example, presently noise levels are limited to 90 decibels on the A<br>
weighted scale (dBA) for eight hour exposure. Some other countries limit<br>
exposure to 85 dBA.<br>
Since noise generation is inherent in the throttling process, many<br>
control valves require some method of noise reduction. Often globe type<br>
valves are supplied with low noise trim using cages with a multiplicity of small<br>
drilled holes.<br>
A more cost effective solution is desirable for moderate service conditions. Specifically some<br>
form of noise reduction that can be obtained at moderate cost is desirable for rotary control valves.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a noise reduction device for fluid flow systems, the device<br>
comprising :<br>
an inner section with a plurality of apertures on an upstream side and a plurality of apertures<br>
on a downstream side ; and<br>
an outer section with a plurality of apertures on an upstream side and a plurality of apertures<br>
on a downstream side, the total cross-sectional area of the downstream apertures of the outer section<br>
being less than the total cross-sectional area of the downstream apertures of the inner section, said<br>
upstream apertures of the outer section being offset from said downstream apertures of the outer<br>
section,<br>
characterised in that said upstream apertures of the outer section are smaller than said<br>
downstream apertures of the outer section.<br>
Thus a noise reduction device comprising a central section and an outer annular section is<br>
provided. The outer section is designed to reduce the velocity of fluid flow through the device and<br>
create an annular fluid flow that has a reduced velocity when compared to the core fluid flow of the<br>
system. The preferred method for reducing the velocity of the annular flow is a staged pressure<br>
reduction wherein the fluid flow passes through an upstream aperture into a pressure reduction<br>
chamber and then through an offset downstream aperture of larger cross sectional area than the<br>
upstream aperture. The core flow of the system passes through a plurality of apertures in a central<br>
section of the noise reduction device to increase the frequency of the noise in the core flow. The<br>
device creates a flow regime with an annular flow surrounding a core flow, the annular flow having a<br>
reduced velocity compared to the core flow.<br>
The present invention is intended to provide noise reduction of 15-20 decibels over a wide<br>
range of operating conditions. The one piece device is readily machined from wrought material such<br>
as austenitic stainless steel. In spite of the drilled holes the thick sections provide an extremely high<br>
natural frequency to prevent failure due to flow induced vibration.<br>
Prior art noise control devices in fluid flow systems are disclosed in US 5,480,123, US 6 244<br>
297, US 5 988 586, US 5 904 334, EP 0101323 and WO 0 131 242. The present invention is<br>
distinguished from them by the fact that the velocity of the flow through the outer section is reduced<br>
relative to that through the inner section, and the total cross-sectional area of the outer section is less<br>
than the total cross-sectional area of the inner section. Further, in the present invention, the upstream<br>
apertures of the outer section are smaller than the downstream apertures of the outer section. These<br>
distinguishing features of the present invention over the prior art provide a more cost-effective<br>
solution for noise reduction in fluid flow systems, than in the prior art.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS OF THE<br>
INVENTION<br>
Reference is now made to the Drawings wherein like reference<br>
numerals denote like or similar parts throughout the Figures.<br>
Referring now to Figs. 1, 2, and 3, the noise reduction device 10<br>
comprises a circular disc having a central section 12 and an outer annular<br>
section 14. The central section 12 contains a plurality of central apertures 16<br>
extending through the disk. The outer annular section 14 has upstream<br>
apertures 18 communicating with a pressure reduction chamber 20 which<br>
communicates with downstream apertures 22. The noise reduction device 10<br>
has an outer circumferential surface 24 into which a groove 26 is cut around<br>
its entire circumference. Groove 26 forms pressure reduction chamber 20<br>
when the device is placed within a fluid flow system, as is illustrated in Fig. 7.<br>
Central section 12 in the embodiment shown in Fig. 1 further includes an<br>
upstream recess 28 and a downstream recess 30. Outer annular section 14<br>
may have a downstream fin 32 and an annular recess 34. Annular recess 34<br>
communicates with downstream apertures 22 and is separated from<br>
downstream recess 30 by downstream fin 32. Recesses 28, 30 and 32 in<br>
conjunction with downstream fin 32 enhance the separation between a core<br>
fluid flow through the central section 12 and an annular fluid flow through the<br>
annular section 14.<br>
Each upstream aperture 18 has an axis 36 which extends generally<br>
parallel to the flow direction. Each downstream aperture 22 has an axis 38<br>
which extends generally parallel to the flow direction. In the preferred<br>
embodiment shown in Figs. 1, 2, and 3, upstream axes 36 are offset from<br>
downstream axes 38 by 5 degrees. The offset between upstream axes and<br>
downstream axes enhances the pressure reduction in chamber 20 and is<br>
shown in each of the figures. In Fig. 3 aperture 22 is shown while aperture 18<br>
is in shadow, offset from aperture 22 by 5 degrees of rotation. In Fig. 2<br>
aperture 18 is shown while aperture 22 is in shadow, offset from aperture 18<br>
by 5 degrees of rotation. Fig. 1 show aperture 22 as a part of the main<br>
cutaway, but aperture 18 is shown as a part of a partial cutaway, indicating<br>
that it is not in the same plane as aperture 22. The partial cutaway is used to<br>
show the. passage of fluid in the annular section 14 first through aperture 18<br>
into chamber 20 and then out of chamber 20 through aperture 22. Figures 4,<br>
5, &amp; 6 are drawn in similar fashion to show the same offset.<br>
Referring now to Figs. 4, 5 and 6, a second embodiment is shown of<br>
the invention. Noise reduction device 40 is similar to noise reduction device<br>
10. Noise reduction device 40 has a central section 42 and an outer annular<br>
section 44. Central section 42 has central apertures 46. Outer annular<br>
section 44 has upstream apertures 48 which communicate with pressure<br>
reduction chamber 50 which communicates with downstream apertures 52.<br>
Noise reduction device 40 has an outer circumferential surface 54 into which<br>
a groove 56 has been cut to form noise reduction chamber 50.<br>
Noise reduction device 40 does not have an upstream recess,<br>
downstream recess, downstream fin, or annular recess as shown in noise<br>
reduction device 10. Noise reduction device 40 relies on the pressure<br>
differential created between the outer section 44 and central section 42 for<br>
separation and velocity reduction. Upstream apertures 48 have upstream<br>
axes 66 and downstream apertures 52 have downstream axes 68. Upstream<br>
axes 66 are off set from downstream axes 68 by 5 degrees as shown in Figs.<br>
5 and 6.<br>
Noise reduction devices 10 and 40 illustrate two embodiments of the<br>
invention. Other embodiments may include selected features of each. For<br>
example, a third embodiment may be similar to device 10, but without annular<br>
recess 34 and downstream fin 32. Such a third embodiment may be<br>
described as similar to device 40, but adding upstream recess 28 and<br>
downstream recess 30 from device 10. As will be appreciated by one skilled<br>
in the art, many other embodiments are within the scope of this invention.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 7, a valve system 70 is shown with an upstream<br>
inlet 72 and a cylindrical downstream outlet 74. The noise reduction device<br>
10 of the present invention is shown as inserted into downstream outlet 74.<br>
Downstream outlet 74 may be threaded with outlet threads 76 and noise<br>
reduction device 10 may have mating threads 78 on outer surface 24.<br>
Threads 78 engage outlet threads 76 to restrain noise reduction device 10 in<br>
downstream outlet 74. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that<br>
other methods of securing noise reduction device 10 in the outlet may be<br>
used.<br>
Noise reduction device 10 and noise reduction device 40 are both<br>
designed to separate the flow in a fluid flow system into an inner core fluid<br>
flow and an outer annular fluid flow. Devices 10 and 40 and other<br>
embodiments thereof reduce the pressure in the outer annular fluid flow in a<br>
staged manner and thereby reduce the velocity of outer annular flow relative<br>
to inner core flow.<br>
Noise reduction device 10 or 40 achieves a reduction in the noise<br>
transmitted to the air surrounding the exterior of a piping system by three<br>
identifiable mechanisms. The first mechanism is reduced noise generation in<br>
the fluid. The difference in velocity between the annular flow and the core<br>
flow reduces aerodynamically generated noise as compared to a device that<br>
produces a singular flow field. In subsonic flow, the noise reduction is due to<br>
the reduced strength of turbulent eddies that create noise. In sonic flow<br>
conditions, the noise reduction is due to the reduced interaction of turbulent<br>
flow with shock cells. Through these fluid mechanisms the fluid generated<br>
noise is reduced.<br>
The second mechanism is through the generation of high frequency<br>
noise. Flow through small apertures, such as apertures 16, produces high<br>
frequency noise. Pipe wall transmission loss is dependent upon the driving<br>
frequency. The minimum transmission loss for a particular pipe-size and wall<br>
thickness, and with a given fluid, is at the lowest coincidence frequency. The<br>
lowest region of transmission loss falls between the lowest coincidence<br>
frequency and the ring frequency. Flow through small apertures, such as<br>
central apertures 16 or 46, produces high frequency noise that is intended to<br>
be well above the coincidence and ring frequencies of the downstream piping.<br>
The resulting increased transmission loss is very beneficial toward reduction<br>
of the perceived noise in the air surrounding the exterior of a piping system.<br>
The third mechanism is the effect of downstream velocity adjacent to<br>
the pipe wall. Normally the perceived noise outside the piping increases with<br>
increased downstream velocity even with the same internal noise level. The<br>
annular flow velocity along the downstream pipe wall is lowered by pressure<br>
staging in the noise reduction device 10 or 40. Lower velocity along the<br>
downstream pipe wall reduces the downstream velocity effect thereby<br>
reducing the perceived noise level.<br>
While the invention has been described and illustrated in at least two<br>
embodiments there are modifications that can be made to these embodiments<br>
while still remaining within the scope of the attached claims. It will be<br>
appreciated by one skilled in the art that all of the apertures in the preferred<br>
embodiments are circular, this reflects the easiest known method of<br>
manufacturing the preferred embodiments, which is a drilling procedure. The<br>
device would work equally well with other shapes of apertures such<br>
rectangular apertures, square apertures, oval apertures, hexagonal apertures,<br>
etc. It is also noted that the apertures in the central section of the device are<br>
arranged hexagonally to create even spacing between apertures. This<br>
hexagonal spacing is the preferred method for achieving even spacing<br>
between the apertures although other spacings would also work. A further<br>
modification within the scope of this invention would be to further adjust the<br>
offset between the upstream apertures and the downstream apertures. While<br>
the methods, apparatus and system shown and described have been<br>
characterized as being preferred embodiments, it will be readily apparent that<br>
various changes and modifications can be made therein without departing<br>
from the scope of the invention as defined in the following claims.<br>
