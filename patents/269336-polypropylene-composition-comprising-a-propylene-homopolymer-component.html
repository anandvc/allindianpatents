				<td>The present invention concerns a polypropylene composition, comprising at least one propylene homopolymer component, a method for preparing same, a catalyst, suitable for the preparation of the polypropylene composition and the use of the polypropylene composition for the formation of polymeric articles, preferably films and thermoformed as well as molded articles.<br>
Description of prior art<br>
Polypropylene compositions are known in the art. Polypropylene compositions comprising a propylene homopolymer component are in particular used for film applications. Such applications require a high degree of transparency of the polypropylene composition, in particular when the polypropylene composition in the form of a film is used for packaging application etc. In the art, it is well known in this respect to improve the optical properties of a polypropylene composition by adding nucleating agents, also designated clarifiers. The European patent application EP 1 514 893 A1, for example, discloses polypropylene blown films comprising nucleating agents, selected for example from phosphoric acid ester metal salts as well as polymeric nucleating agents, for example vinyl cycloalkane polymers. Similar nucleating agents are also disclosed in the international applications WO 99/24478 and WO 99/24479. The European patent application EP 0 316 187 A2 discloses a crystalline polypropylene homopolymer incorporated therein a polymer of a vinyl cycloalkane. The international application WO 2004/055101 discloses a heterophasic propylene copolymer, containing nucleating agents, selected from phosphate-derived nucleating agents, sorbitol-derived nucleating agents, metal salts of aromatic or aliphatic carboxylic acids as nucleating agents, polymeric nucleating agents, such as polyvinyl cyclohexane and inorganic nucleating agents, such as talc.<br>
The US patent 4,551,501 finally discloses a crystallince propylene polymer composition comprising a blend of a crystalline polypropylene with a polymer of a vinyl cycloalkane. This US patent discloses that the polymer of the vinyl cycloalkane is introduced into the polymer composition using master batch technology.<br>
In WO 2005026240 is disclosed a polypropylene based blown film which contains a clarifier containing phosphate-based alpha-nucleating agent and/pr polymeric alpha-nucleating agents. However, no example of the use of polymeric nucleating is disclosed.<br>
A drawback of the prior art compositions, however, is the fact that a sufficient transparency often cannot be obtained, in particular with polymeric nucleating agents. Approaches using the master batch technology often suffer from the drawback that it is very troublesome to incorporate by mechanical blending high amounts of nucleating agents with a satisfactory degree of evenness of the distribution into a polymer composition. On the other hand low molecular weight nucleating agents, such as sorbitol-derived nucleating agents, are relatively costly which is unfavourable, since high amounts thereof are often needed. Furthermore, such low molecular weight components may give rise to further problems during the lifetime of a manufactured product, such as migration, blooming etc., resulting in a deterioration of the product quality, with respect to the optical properties such as haze and transparency as well as with respect to physical properties.<br>
Object of the present invention<br>
Accordingly it is the object of the present invention to provide a further polypropylene composition overcoming the drawback associated with the prior art. In particular, the present invention aims at providing an advantageous polypropylene composition comprising at least one propylene homopolymer component, wherein satisfactory optical properties, in particular haze values and transparency can be obtained in a simple and reliable manner. In this respect, the present invention also aims at providing a suitable process for preparing a polypropylene composition satisfying the requirements as outlined above and suitable catalyst therefor.<br>

As identified in claims 1 and 2 the polypropylene composition in accordance with the present invention is characterized by the common feature that a specific combination of MFR2 and haze is provided, which may be expressed either by defining specific MFR2 values of 8g/10min or less in combination with a haze value of below 55% when determined according to ASTMD 1003 with 2mm thick injection molded plaque samples, as in claim 2, or by defining limits for the MFR2 value of from 1 to 50g/10 min and a haze definition by means of an inequality including the parameters MFR2l and amount of polymeric nucleating agent, as done in claim 1. The following specification describes further embodiments which are valid for the polypropylene composition according to claim 1 as well as, independently, for the polypropylene composition according to claim 2. Claims 1 and 2 are accordingly alternatives which describe novel and improved polypropylene compositions.<br>
However, the present invention also contemplates and claims polypropylene compositions being defined by specific MFR2 values of 8g/10min or less in combination with a haze value of below 55% when determined according to ASTMD 1003 with 2mm thick injection molded plaque samples, as in claim 2, and by defining a lower limit for the MFR2 value of 1g/10 min and a haze definition by means of an inequality including the parameters MFR2, and amount of polymeric nucleating agent, as done in claim 1. Accordingly the present invention is also directed to a polypropylene composition being defined by a combination of claims 1 and 2, and the following description also concerns preferred embodiments individually for the subject-matter of claim 2 and for the subject-matter of claim 1, as well as for the combination of subject-matter of claims 1 and 2.<br>
Further, for the present invention a polypropylene composition, comprising<br>

A)	at least one propylene homopolymer component, and<br>
B)	a polymeric nucleating agent,<br>

Haze(%)
with<br>
N = amount of polymeric nucleating agent in the propylene homopolymer in ppm<br>
(weight)<br>
MFR2 = MFR2 of the mixture of A) and B) (ISO 1133, 230°C, 2.16 kg load).<br>
is a preferred embodiment of the polypropylene composition as defined in claim 2.<br>
The polypropylene composition in accordance with the present invention comprises at least one propylene homopolymer component.<br>
The modality with respect to molecular weight distribution and thus with respect to melt flow ratio is not critical. Thus the polypropylene composition in accordance with the present invention may be unimodal or multimodal including bimodal with respect to molecular weight distribution. In preferred embodiments of the present invention at least two propylene homopolymer components are present.<br>
The mixture of A) and B) as defined in claim 1 has a MFR2 of from 0.1 to 50 g/10 min (determined using ISO 1133, at230°C, 2.16 kg load), preferably the MFR2 is 
homopolymer component, the MFR2 may be in the range of. from 7.5 to 12 g/10 min, preferably from 8 to 11 g/10 min, while with bimodal propylene homopolymer components the MFR2 in some embodiments of the present invention is in the range of from 2 to 10 g/10 min.<br>
The polypropylene composition in accordance with the present invention is preferably multimodal, at least bimodal with respect to the molecular weight distribution concerning the propylene homopolymer components. In accordance with the present invention, this embodiment can be realized by including two different propylene homopolymer components, differing at least with respect to the MFR2.<br>
Such an embodiment is one preferred embodiment of the present invention. Such an embodiment may be exemplified by a mixture of a lower molecular weight component with a higher molecular weight component The lower molecular weight (LMW) component has a higher MFR2 than the higher molecular weight (HMW) component. The amount of the LMW component is typically between 30 to 70 wt%, preferably 40 to 60 wt% of the total amount of propylene homopolymer. The amount of the HMW component is typically between 30 to 70 wt%, preferably 40 to 60 wt% of the total amount of propylene homopolymer.<br>
In multimodal e.g. bimodal, embodiments, the ratio between the MFR2 of LMW component and MFR2 of HMW component is typically from 1 up to 400, preferably at least 20, more preferably at least 30, such as at least 40. The upper limit of said ratio may be preferably up to 200. Other embodiments wi!h lower ratios are, however, also envisaged by the present invention.<br>
The at least one propylene homopolymer component preferably has a shear thinning index SHIo/so of &gt; 4, with the upper limit being about 50, preferably ≥ 8, A suitable range is in particular from 8 to 30.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, it is furthermore preferred when the polypropylene composition has a tensile modulus of below 2500 MPa, for example, suitably from 1500 to 2500 MPa.<br>
The polypropylene composition in accordance with the present invention shows preferably a polydispersity index (PI) of &gt; 2.5, preferably ≥ 4. A suitable upper limit for the polydispersity index is about 10, so that a suitable range in accordance with the present invention is, for example, from 4 to 8.<br>
The polypropylene composition in accordance with the present invention furthermore, in embodiments, comprises a xylene soluble fraction of below 3 wt%, based on the polymeric components of the polypropylene composition.<br>
Furthermore, preferably the polypropylene composition in accordance with the present invention has a molecular weight distribution, MWD, as calculated from MW/Mn values obtained from the size exclusion chromatography (SEC, also known as GPC) of preferably up to 20, in particular ≥ 3, for example 5 to 20 and in embodiments from 7 to 18orfrom10to15.<br>
The polypropylene composition in accordance with the present invention is furthermore characterized in that it comprises a polymeric nucleating agent. Any known polymeric nucleating agent may be employed including polymers of vinyl alkanes and vinyl cycloalkanes. A preferred example of such a polymeric nucleating agent is a vinyl polymer, such as a vinyl polymer derived from monomers of the formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein Ri and R2, together with the carbon atom they are attached to, form an optionally substituted saturated or unsaturated or aromatic ring or a fused ring system, wherein the ring or fused ring moiety contains four to 20 carbon atoms, preferably 5 to 12 membered saturated or unsaturated or aromatic ring or a fused ring system or independently represent a linear or branched C4-C30alkane, C4-C20cycloalkane or C4-C20aromatic ring. Preferably R1 and R2, together with the C-atom wherein they are attached to, form a five- or six-membered saturated or unsaturated or aromatic ring or independently represent a lower alkyl group comprising from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Preferred vinyl compounds for the preparation of a polymeric nucleating agent to be used in accordance with the present invention are in particular vinyl cycloalkanes, in particular vinyl cyclohexane (VCH), vinyl cyclopentane, and vinyl-2-methyl cyclohexane, 3-methyl-<br>
1 -butene, 3-ethyl-1 -hexene, 3-methyM-pentene, 4-methyl-1-pentene or mixtures thereof. VCH is a particularly preferred monomer.<br>
The polymeric nucleating agent usually is present in the final product in an amount of from more than 20 ppm, typically more than 45 ppm, (based on the weight of the polypropylene composition). Preferably this agent is present in the polypropylene composition in a range of from 50 to 1000 ppm, more preferably more than 100 ppm, such as 200 to 800 ppm.<br>
The use of the polymeric nucleating agent in accordance with the present invention enables the preparation of polypropylene compositions having highly satisfactory optical properties and satisfactory mechanical properties, so that it is not required for the compositions in accordance with the present invention to contain low molecular weight nucleating agents, in particular costly sorbitol-derived nucleating agents. Accordingly, the present invention provides an alternative. means for improving the transparency of propylene copolymer compositions, especially in end applications wherein the use of low molecular weight nucleating agents as clarifiers is not desirable, such as in many medical and food applications with strict purity requirements and regulations.<br>
Moreover, the present invention achieves highly advantageous haze values of the polypropylene composition as defined herein using relatively low amounts of polymeric nucleating agents. The low molecular weight nucleating agents require usually higher amounts to obtain comparable results in transparency.<br>
As defined in claim 1 of the present application, the polypropylene composition in accordance with the present invention comprising the essential components as defined above, i.e. the at least one propylene homopolymer component A) and the polymeric nucleating agent B), enables the preparation of polypropylene compositions giving rise to compositions having a haze, measured in the form of an injection molded test piece having a thickness of 2 mm (test method identified below) satisfying the following relation:<br>
Haze(%) 
N = amount of polymeric nucleating agent in the propylene homopolymer in ppm (weight) MFR2 = MFR2 of the mixture of A) and B), determined as defined in claim 1.<br>
Preferably N is from 45 to 1000. Preferably MFR2 is from 1 to 50 g/10 min. For each of the two ranges illustrated above the further preferred embodiments as derivable from the present specification likewise apply.<br>
The polymeric nucleating agent preferably is PVCH.<br>
The polypropylene composition in accordance with the present invention may be prepared by any suitable process, including in particular blending processes such as mechanical blending including mixing and melt blending processes and any combinations thereof as well as in-situ blending during the polymerisation process of the propylene polymer component(s). These can be carried out by methods known to the skilled person, including batch processes and continuous processes.<br>
It is also possible to prepare the polypropylene composition in accordance with the present invention by sequential polymerization processes, wherein the single components of the polypropylene composition are prepared, one after the other, in the presence of the already prepared components. Such a process for preparing the polypropylene composition is preferred and yields a reactor blend or reactor made polymer composition, which means herein the reaction product obtained from a polymerization reaction wherein, for example, the propylene homopolymer component is polymerized in the presence of the polymeric nucleating agent.<br>
The reactor made polymer composition (in-situ blend) defines a different embodiment compared to a mechanical blend of a polymer with a nucleating agent, wherein thepolymer is first produced in the absence of a polymeric nucleating agent and is then blended mechanically with the polymeric nucleating agent or with a small amount of nucleated polymer (so-called master batch technology) in order to introduce the polymeric nucleating agent into the polymer mixture. The preparation of a reactor made polymer composition ensures the preparation of a homogenous mixture of the components, for example a homogenously distributed polymeric nucleating agent in the polypropylene composition, even at high concentrations of polymer nucleating agent. As<br>
outlined above, the reactor made polymer composition is a preferred embodiment of the present invention, although also mechanical blends prepared, for example, by using master batch technology are envisaged by the present invention.<br>
Similar considerations also apply with respect to the preparation of multimodal including bimodal polypropylene compositions, in particular the compositions comprising two different propylene homopolymer components with differing MFR2 values. While such multimodal or bimodal components may also be prepared by mechanical blending processes, it is preferred in accordance with the present invention to provide such multimodal or bimodal compositions in the form of a reactor made compositions, meaning that the second (or any further) component is prepared in the presence of the first component (or any preceding components).<br>
A suitable process for preparing reactor made compositions is outlined below.<br>
The propylene homopolymer component to be employed in accordance with the present invention in principle can be prepared by any polymerization method, including solution, slurry and gas phase polymerization. Slurry polymerization preferably designates a bulk polymerization. Bulk polymerization defines a polymerization in a reaction medium comprising at least 60 wt% monomer.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the polypropylene composition comprises two different propylene homopolymer components, preferably differing in particular with respect to MFR2. Such a mixture of two propylene homopolymer components preferably may be produced in accordance with the present invention in a multistage process using one or more polymerization reactors, which may be the same or different, for example, at least slurry-slurry, gas phase-gas phase or any combination of slurry and gas phase polymerization. Each stage may be effected in parallel or sequentially using same or different polymerization methods. Advantageously, the above-mentioned mixture of the two different propylene homopolymer components is prepared in a sequence comprising at least one slurry polymerization and at least one gas phase polymerization. Suitably, the slurry polymerization is the first polymerization step, followed by a gas phase polymerization. This order, however, may also be reversed. In the case of such a sequential polymerization reaction, each component may<br>
be produced in any order by carrying out the polymerization in each step, except the first step, in the presence of the polymer component formed in the preceding step. Preferably, the catalyst used in the preceding step is also present in the subsequent polymerization step. Alternatively, it is also possible to add additional quantities of the identical catalyst or of a different catalyst in a subsequent polymerization step.<br>
A suitable possibility of forming a multimodal propylene homopolymer component is a polymerization sequence comprising a first polymerization step in a slurry reactor, preferably a loop reactor, followed by a polymerization step in a gas phase reactor, wherein the second propylene homopolymer component is prepared in the presence of the already prepared first propylene homopolymer component (prepared in the slurry reactor).<br>
A preferred multistage process is the above-identified slurry-gas phase process, such as developed by Borealis and known as the Borstar® technology. In this respect, reference is made to the European applications EP 0 887 379 A1 and EP 517 868 A1, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In the case of multimodal compositions, at least with respect to the molecular weight distribution or MFR, the composition comprises a low molecular weight component (LMW) and a higher molecular weight component (HMW). The LMW component and the HMW component are made in different steps in any order. Preferably, typically when a Ziegler-Natta catalyst is used, the HMW fraction is produced in the first step and the LMW fraction is produced in the subsequent step, in the presence of the HMW fraction.<br>
In case of the unimodal polypropylene homo polymer the homo polymer is unimodal with respect to MWD, whereby the polymer can be polymerised e.g. in a single stage batch or preferably continuous process. The process can be a slurry or gas phase, preferably a slurry, such as loop, process. Alternatively, the unimodal polymer may be produced in a multistage process using at each stage process conditions which result in similar polymer properties.<br>
Optionally, the unimodal or multimodal processes can further comprise a prepolymerisation step preceding the polymerization of above mentioned propylene polymer component(s) in a manner known in the field.<br>
One example of a suitable sequential polymerization method for preparing multimodal, including bimodal compositions as exemplified above, is a process employing first a slurry reactor, for example a loop reactor, followed by a second polymerization in a gas phase reactor. Such a reaction sequence provides a reactor blend of different propylene homopolymers for which the MFR2 values can be adjusted as, in principle, known to the skilled person during the sequential polymerization steps. It is of course possible and also envisaged by the present invention to carry out the first reaction in a gas phase reactor while the second polymerization is carried out in a slurry reactor, for example a loop reactor. The process as discussed above, comprising at least two polymerization steps, is advantageous in view of the fact that it provides easily controllable reaction steps enabling the preparation of a desired reactor blend of propylene homopolymers. The polymerization steps may be adjusted, for example, by appropriately selecting monomer feed, hydrogen feed, temperature, pressure, type and amount of catalyst, in order to suitably adjust the properties of the polymerization products obtained.<br>
Such a process can be carried out using any suitable catalyst for the preparation of propylene monomers, including single site catalyst, including metallocenes and non-metallocenes, and Ziegler-Natta. Preferably, the process as discussed above is carried out using a Ziegler-Natta catalyst, in particular a high yield Ziegler-Natta catalyst (so called fourth and fifth generation type to differentiate from low yield, so called second generation Ziegler-Natta catalysts). A suitable Ziegler-Natta catalyst to be employed in accordance with the present invention comprises a catalyst component, a co-catalyst component and at least one electron donor (internal and/or external electron donor, preferably at least one external donor). Preferably, the catalyst component is a Ti-Mg-based catalyst component and typically the co-catalyst is an Al-alkyl based compound. Suitable catalysts are in particular disclosed in US 5,234,879, WO 92/19653, WO 92/19658 and WO 99/33843, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Preferred external donors are the known silane-based donors, preferably dicyclopentyl dimethoxy silane or cyclohexyl methyldimethoxy silane.<br>
An alternative to such multistage, multi-reactor processes is the preparation of a multimodal polymer component in one reactor as known to the skilled person. In order to produce a multimodal polymer composition, the skilled person in particular can control<br>
the reaction by changing polymerization conditions, using different types of catalyst and using different hydrogen feeds.<br>
With respect to the above-mentioned preferred slurry-gas phase process, the following general information can be provided with respect to the process conditions.<br>
Temperature of from 40°C to 110°C, preferably between 60 °C and 100QC, in particular between 70°C and 90°C, with a pressure in the range of from 20 to 80 bar, preferably 30 to 60 bar, with the option of adding hydrogen in order to control the molecular weight. The reaction product of the slurry polymerization, which preferably is carried out in a loop reactor, is then transferred to the subsequent gas phase reactor, wherein the temperature preferably is within the range of from 50°C to 130°C, more preferably 60°C to 100°C, at a pressure in the range of from 5 to 50 bar, preferably 15 to 35 bar, again with the option of adding hydrogen in order to control the molecular weight.<br>
The residence time can vary in the reactor zones identified above. In embodiments, the residence time in the slurry reaction, for example the loop reactor, is in the range of from 0.5 to 5 hours, for example 0.5 to 2 hours, while the residence time in the gas phase reactor generally will be from 1 to 8 hours.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the present invention, the polymeric nucleating agent is introduced into the polypropylene composition by means of a suitably modified catalyst, i.e. the catalyst to be used in catalysing the polymerisation of the propylene homopolymer is subjected to a polymerisation of a suitable monomer for the polymeric nucleating agent to produce first said polymeric nucleating agent. The catalyst is then introduced together with the obtained polymeric nucleating agent to the actual polymerisation step of the propylene homopolymer component(s).<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, the propylene homopolymer is prepared in the presence of such a modified catalyst to obtain said reactor made popypropylene composition. With such modified catalyst, it is also possible to carry out the above-identified preferred polymerization sequence for the preparation of in-situ blended multimodal, including bimodal, propylene homopolymers.<br>

A preferred polypropylene composition in accordance with the present invention accordingly is obtainable by preparing a propylene homopolymer in the presence of a modified catalyst, wherein the modified catalyst is obtainable by polymerizing a vinyl compound having the formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R1 and R2 are as defined previously herein, at a weight ratio of the vinyl compound to polymerization catalyst of two or more, in the presence of said catalyst, until the concentration of unreacted vinyl compound is less than about 0.5 wt%, preferably less than 0.1 wt%.<br>
Concerning the modification of catalyst reference is made to the international applications WO 99/24478, WO 99/24479 and particularly WO 00/68315, incorporated herein by reference with respect to the reaction conditions concerning the modification of the catalyst as well as with respect to the polymerization reaction.<br>
In this respect, the present invention furthermore provides a catalyst, suitable for the preparation of polypropylene compositions, wherein the polymerization catalyst is obtainable by polymerizing a vinyl compound of the formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>

Examples 6 to 8 and Comparative Example 3 (TF)<br>
The examples 6 to 8 and Comparative Example 3 were prepared in a continuous multistage process in pilot scale comprising a loop reactor and a fluidised bed gas phase reactor as follows:<br>
The catalyst used was a highly active, stereospecific transesterified MgCI2-supported Ziegler-Natta catalyst prepared analogously to Example 1. The catalysts are further characterized in Table 2. The catalyst was modified with VCH as disclosed in Example 1,<br><br>
except that the weight ratio of VCH:catalyst was 10:1 and the modification was carried out in pentane. The catalyst for Comparative Example 3 and 4 was modified with VCH as disclosed in Example 1, except that the weight ratio of VCH:catalyst was 1:1. Triethyl aluminium was used as a cocatalyst with Al/Ti molar ratio of 200. The catalyst was prepolymerised in a known manner in the presence of propylene and the co-catalyst in a separate prepolymerisation step. Then propylene, and hydrogen were fed together with the prepolymerised catalyst into the loop reactor which operated as a bulk reactor at conditions given in Table 2 (production of loop fraction). Then the polymer slurry stream was fed from the loop reactor into the gas phase reactor and more propylene and hydrogen were fed in the gas phase reactor (production of the gas phase reactor fraction in the presence of the loop-fraction to obtain the matrix component). The polymerisation conditions therein are given in Table 2. These examples are representative for TF applications.<br><br>
