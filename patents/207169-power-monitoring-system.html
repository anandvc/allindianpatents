				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present Invention relates to a power monitoring system whereby It Is possible to detect abnormal conditions of use of electric power in a wide region supplied with electric power, and to ensure cotrect billing.<br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
Electric power to generated by a power station, supplied through power-transmission lines to a certain region, and consumed by factories, buldings, general households, and various other facilities within the region. Consumed electric power Is separately checked by reading meters, and use re of electric power are charged according to the amount of electric energy consumed.<br>
For example, r the user Is a general household, electric power travelhg through a power-transmission line is supplied to an integrating wattmeter having at least a power-measuring function, and then distributed to televisions, air-conditioners, lighting equipment, and other electric appliances through a breaker connected to the Integrating wattmeter.<br>
Electric energy consumed by each general household is then read by checking the meter, and the reeding is sent to a bid collection system or a billing system belonging to an electric power company. At a later date, an electricly fee is charged to each general household.<br>
Payment of electricity fees is made In various ways, such as by bank or postal transfer and cash payment through a convenience store. Thus,eachuser of electric power can select a preferred method of payment.<br>
Even factories, buildings and other faclities that own equipment and machines larger in scale than those of general households also pay electricity fees through such a financial institution as a bank to an etectric power company with which it has a contract, according to the amount of power consumed.<br>
-1-<br><br>
However, Integrating wattmeters Instated In general households, factories, biddings, and other facltttes to measure power consumption may become abnormal, or some users may manipulate the mechanism or the Integrating wattmeter so that the meter does not work normaly. These problems make it impossible fo measure the power consumption precisely.<br>
There has been another problem that if electric power is used by an electric device Instated and wired by bypassing a power line from a power-transmission line with the integrating wattmeter left as is, then the amount of power consumed may no longer be precisely measured win the integrating wattmeter<br>
If an electric power provider is unable to precisely know how electric power is used, as discussed above I becomes difficult to, for example, plan the electric power suppry and the schedule of maintaining and inspecting equipment and machines for electric power supply- Another problem is that the electric power provider cannot carry out correct billing or bill collection according to the amount of power consumed.<br>
The present invention has been made to solve the aforementioned prob ferns.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWING:<br>
FIG. 1 is a conceptual block diagram representing the power monttorhg system according to the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
An example of the power monloring system according to the present invention is shown in FIG. 1.<br>
In FIG. 1, the entire range of a region supplied with electric power from an electric power provider is divided into several areas and these areas are<br>
-4-<br><br>
referenced as A1,A2, A3 and A4. Each of these areas A1,A2, A3 and A4 is a unlary block to which electric power Is supplied.<br>
Each of the areas A 1,A2, A3 and A4 Is, for example, a general multiple dwellng housing unit or condominium comprising a plurality of households, or factory, bulding, plant or any other facility. The area A1 is further subdivided into, for example, sub are as at, a2 and a3. The sub are as a1, a2 and a3 are such units as to make It easy to monitor how electric power Is used, and are Included In the range for which an area is segmented Into multiple blocks.<br>
If the area A1 is assumed to be a factory, then any single floor or building (hereof corresponds to a srtarea. Likewise, if the area At is assumed to be a residential quarter, then each of the subareas a1, a2 and a3 corresponds to a single, or two to three houses.<br>
One of the features provided by the present invention is that integrating wattmeters ml, m2 and m3, each having at least a power consumption measuring function, are Installed on the respective electric power Inlets of the subareas a1,a2,a3,so as to support their respective subareas a1,a2 and a3.<br>
These integrating wattmeters m1, m2 and m3 are baskaty designed to measure electric energy (W-h) used in the subareas a1, a2 and a3. However, the meters are also capable of measuring and calculating the instananeous values of electric current, voltage and power factor, for example, as data Items related to power consumption. Furthermore, the meters have addition el functions, such as data logging and trend data recording.<br>
In addlion, an integrating wattmeter mO having the same functions as those of the integrating wattmeters ml, m2 and m3 is Installed In order to measure electric power consumed within the entire range of the area A1.<br>
In other words, the integrating wattmeters ml, m2 and m3 are Instruments for locaUy measuring electric power consumed in the subareas a1,<br>
-5-<br><br>
a2 and a3 whore the maters are installed, while the Integrating wattmeter mO is m Instrument that measures and calculates electric energy actually consumed h the area A1.<br>
More specifically, if there are about 300 units of integrating wattmeters ml, m2, m3,... in total installed in the areas A1, A2, A3 end A4, then about 50 unis are allocated to one area, and one Integrating wattmeter mO is allocated to that area.<br>
Area-wide power consumption data acquired by the Integrating wattmeter mO and the sum of power consumption date output from the integrating wattmeters m1,m2 and m3 are input to the control unite.<br>
The control unit C Is equipment composed of, for example, a programmable logic controller PLC containing a microprocessor, and is connected through a router r or the like to a communications circuit L, such as the Internet, by means of a built-in interface module d.<br>
The communications circuit L is provided wth a billtig system SI serving as a transaction computer system for processing power consumption and other data according to electric power consumed In the areas A1, A2, A3 and A4 end billing to the areas or stf&gt;areas, and with a public server system S2 for receiving date transmitted from control units C and making the data open through communications circul L.<br>
Now, the system configured according to the present invention as explained above wHIbe described.<br>
First, the instantaneous values of current, voltage, power factor and the like are measured by the tategratlng wattmeters ml, m2 and m3 as data on electric energy consumed in the subareas at, a2 and a3, and sent to a computation processing module c2 wtthh the control unit C by means of, for example, an RS485 communications line.<br>
-6-<br><br>
In the computation processing module c2, data on the power consumption transmitted from the integrating wattmeters ml, m2 and m3 ore submitted to a summing process, In order to calculate the total amount Mt of electric energy consumed fn aH of the sub are as m 1, m2 and m3.<br>
On the other hand, (he amount Ms of electric energy actually consumed In the area A1 Is transmitted from the Integrating wattmeter mO to the computation processing module c2.<br>
The computation processing module c2 performs the process of comparing between the actual power consumption Ms in the area transmitted from integrating wattmeter mO and the Integrated power consumption Mt provided by the integrathg wattmeters m1,m2 and m3, as well as the process of loggfrig and trend-record hg various parameters, Including voltage, current and power factor, transmitted from each Integrating wattmeter, and other processes.<br>
tf Ms = Mt as the result of performing the comparison process, electric power Is regarded as being used In a normal way. Consequently, as data on the use of electric power In each of the subareas a1, a2 and a3, the power co nsum ptton Mt is t mnsm itte d to the b Mling system S1 th ro ugh the communications circui L by means of the interface module d, dial-up router r, and the lice, of the control unit C.<br>
The blHng system 81 charges fees to the area A1 by bIHng each of the subareas a1, a2 and a3, according to the amount of power consumed. This billing may be performed by means of regular mail containing biUs from the billing system SI, or by means of online billing through the communications circuit L.<br>
If Ms does not equal Mt (the two values are Ms &gt; Mt or Ms 
-7-<br><br>
the area At. A tauft alarm is issued through the communications circuit I to the blfflng system S1 and to a public server system 32 as discussed later In this section.<br>
This fault alarm may bo, for example, a regular status signal or an a fee ironic mart sen* out from the control unit C to the communications circuit L.<br>
As discussed earlier, the control unit C periodlcaly acquires various parameters, Including volage, current and power factor, from the Integrating wattmeters ml, m2 and m3 In the subareas a1, a2 and "3 in order to submit them lo logging and trend-recording processes. The system may then be configured so that f there is any sudden change in the trend or trans lion of those data Herns, tor example, a sudden Increase or decrease therein, then such a change Is recognized as a fault prediction signal.<br>
This fault prediction signal may be a regular alarm signal, or an electronic malt sent out from the controtunitC to the communications circuit L.<br>
A transaction computer system such as the biting system S1, on the side of the communications circuit L sends back an electronic mal to the control unit C in response to the fault prediction signal.<br>
Upon receipt of the electronic reply mail notifying a fauff alarm, the control unit C, which has been acquiring data on the use of electric power from the integrating wattmeters ml, m2 and u?3 at an interval of, Tor example, 60 minutes, shortens the data acquisition interval to, for example, 30 minutes, in order to verify whether or not a fault is actually occurring and, to that effect, scrutinies trends in the data provided by the integrating wattmeters m 1, m2 and m3.<br>
If there is still no fault recognized even when data acquisition is continued at 30-minute intervals, the data acquisition interval is further shortened step by step to, for example, 15 minutes.<br>
-8-<br><br>
If, as discussed earlier, (power consumption Ms)  (total sum Mt of power consumptions provided by integrating wattmeters ml, m2 and m3)hokls true, the faul prediction signal is changed to a fauK alarm.<br>
Upon receipt of the fault alarm, the billing system 81 or public server system 82 sends an electronic mal to a control unit C m the area with the fault (area A1, In this example), or to a computer system Installed for the area A1, In order to inform that a fauff" present in that area.<br>
In this way, it is possible forthe biting system S1 or pubic server system S2 to recognfee that a fault Is present In an area or subarea, as well as exchange Information on the presence of the fault with the area containing the fault.<br>
In addition, it is possible to narrow down the list of areas to the one containing the fault by mounting Integrating wattmeters onto power lines In such an area as noted above. It fs also possible for service personnel to visl the area containing the fault and to make orvthe-spot investigations. In that case, the service personnel can iake small clamp-on integrating wattmeters to examine on-stte switchboards, power facilities, electric equipment and other facilities Installed hi each subarea of an area. Thus, it is possible for the service personnel to immediately localize the cause of any anomaly, such as an equipment fauttt distribution line faHure, or surreptitious use of electricity.<br>
In the foregoing descnption, connection between the Integrating wattmeters mO, m1,m2 and m3 and the control unit CJs achieved by means of, for example, an R8485 communications Ine. ABemnirvery, wireless means may be employed to interconnect the meters and the unit. In addition, wireless means may also be used to Interconnect between the control unl C and the communications circuit L.<br>
-9-<br><br>
By employing wireless means in this way, it is posstole to eliminate the need for the dial up router r, as well as the need for distribution lines and work of Installing the lines, thereby greatly reducing the time and cost involved.<br>
Next, the public server system 82 b described. As discussed earlier, the public server system S2 is configured so (hat like the blling system SI, electric energy consumed in each of the areas A1, A2, A3 and A4 and various data items related to the use of electric power are transmitted to the public server system 82 from the control unit C.<br>
Then, data on electric energy being consumed in the area in question is made open to a computer system instated in each area or subarea, wlh due care given to security.<br>
At this point, it is possible to inform the amount of power consumption in real time, monthly, weekly, daily or hourly using the public server system 82, if a prepaid system (payment in advance of tees for the previously contracted amount of electric energy) is employed as the system of paying electricity fees.<br>
In other words, the payment system is such that a user of electric power purchases a prepaid card from, for example, an electric power company, makes the card read by a card reader installed in a personal computer or the Ike that supports a given subarea, and uses as much electric power as the value of the preset monetary am ount of the card.<br>
It such a prepaid system as explained above is employed, M is possible to inform the user of how electric power is used, in real time, using the public server system S2. It is also possible to inform, by means of, for example, electronic mail, how much time is left in terms of expenses before the period of use of electric power expires ff the current condition of use continues as is.<br>
-10-<br><br>
This means that the user can know the time when the contracted amount of electric energy will be reached, the length of time before the amount is reached, and other information. Thus, it is posstole for the user to use electric power deliberately, avoid unnecessary expenses, and save on electric power.<br>
Furthermore, regular personal computers may be installed near the integrating wattmeters ml, m2 and m3,so that certain details of a credit card are entered Into the computer from such Input means as a keyboard and sent to, for example,the billing system 81. Consequently, it is possible to moke payment by bank transfer or implement the same functions as those of the aforementioned prepaid card, by using an already owned credit card rather than purchasing a prepaid card.<br>
in that case, as explained above, it is also possible to inform the user of how electric power is used, in real time, using the public server system 82, and the user can know the time when the contracted amount of electric energy will be reached, the length of time before the amount Is reached, and other information. Thus, it Is possible for the user to use electric power deliberately, avoid unnecessary expenses, and save on electric power.<br>
As described heretofore, the following advantages are provided by the power monitoring system according to the present invention.<br>
In one aspect of the present invention, the power montoring system is configured in such a manner that a region supplied with electric power is divided into several areas and each area is further subdivided into several sub areas; an integrating wattmeter and a control unit are instated in each of the subareas; the sum of data on the use of electric power provided by the subarea-by-subarea integrating wattmeters and the value of data on the use of electric power provided by an integrating wattmeter installed in the relevant area are compared with each other; and any difference between the sum and value is regarded as a fault. Consequently, t is possible to determine whether or not electric power is<br>
used abnormally in that area.<br>
-11 -<br><br>
In another aspect of the present Invention, an alarm Tor any detected fault Is transmitted through a communications circuit or network to another computer system by means of, for example, an electronic malt. Consequently, It Is possible to detect (he alarm even in a remote place.<br>
In yet another aspect of the present invention, an electronic reply mail or the Ike can be sent from a remote place to a computer system installed in an ana or a subarea thereof from where an alarm Is being raised, In order to wam that a fault is present in that area.<br>
In yet another aspect of the present invention, data on the use of electric energy In an area is monitored, and a fault prediction signal is issued and the data acquisition interval Is shortened step by step before any fault Is detected. Consequently, fault detection can be performed correctly without fad.<br>
In yet another aspect of the present invention, the power monitoring system Is provided wlh a public server system. Consequently, even In cases where electricity fees are settled by advance payment or deferred payment using a prepaid system ora credit card system,It Is possible to recognize the condition of use of electric power in real time and In a variety of ways on the subarea side, by sending various data items to a computer system installed in a subarea and serving as a client to the public server system, thus enablng users to use electric power rationally.<br>
Accordingly, it is possible to obtain information on, for example, whether or not the amount of electric power used is about to reach the given fan it or when the limit is reached. Consequently, it Is possible to save on electric energy, prevent any additional cost from arising due to overuse of electric power, and thereby reduce costs Jnvotved.<br>
In yet another aspect of the present Invention, connection between each Integrating wattmeter and control unit and between the control unit and communications circuit Is achieved by using wireless means, whereby it Is possfcte to eliminate the need for any cabling work in an area or subarea and for any expense involved tlwreirUhus achieving further cost reductions.<br>

comparison between the sum of data on the use of each electric power obtained<br>
from each of the subarea-by-subarea integrating wattmeter (m1,m2m3,..) and<br>
the value of data on the use of electric power obtained from the area-by-area<br>
integrating wattmeter; and<br>
a transaction computer system (S1, S2) that is connected via a communicated<br>
line (L) to each control unit installed in each area, and designed to receive data<br>
on the electric power amount of each subarea and the fault signal from each<br>
control unit; wherein<br>
the transaction computer system charges expenses of each subarea on the basts<br>
of the data on each electric power amount<br>
Sent from each control unit, and specifies the area (A1, A2, A3, ..) that has a<br>
fault on the basis of the fault signal.<br></td>
