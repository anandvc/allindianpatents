COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See section 10; rule 13]<br>
"PROCESS FOR PREPARATION OF BICALUTAMIDE'<br>
(a)	CIPLALTD.<br>
(b)	289, Bellasis Road, Mumbai Central, Mumbai -400 008, Maharashtra, India<br>
(c)	Indian Company incorporated under the Companies Act 1956<br>
The following specification describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
10-02-2006<br><br>
Field of Invention<br>
This invention relates to a process for the manufacture of (+)-N-[4 Cyano-3(trifiuoromethyl)phenyl]-3[(4 fluoro phenyl)sulfonyl]-2 hydroxy-2 methyl propanamide (I) which is also known as bicalutamide and which is useful in the treatment of prostrate cancer.<br><br>
Background of the invention<br>
Preparation of Bicalutamide is mentioned in the patent No. US 4,636,505, its brief process is as shown in Scheme 1 :<br>
2<br><br><br>
SCHEME 1<br>
The process disclosed in US 4636505 makes use of column chromatography in almost all stages of manufacture of bicalutamide, uses highly flammable solvents like Diethyl ether for isolation of bicalutamide and its intermediates. It also makes use of reagents like sodium hydride, which is highly hazardous on industrial scale.<br>
Use of column chromatography for bulk manufacture requires large amounts of solvents and the stationary phase is discarded after use, thus is disadvantageous in production cost. In addition, the used solvent is evaporated in large amounts into atmosphere and therefore, the column chromatography is preferably not used if possible from the viewpoint of working environment or environmental protection.<br>
Furthermore, patents US 6,479,692, US 2002/0165406AI, WO 02/088070 disclose processes that make use of n-Butylithium for the condensation step (c) of scheme 1 which is extremely reactive and a fire hazard making it disadvantageous to operate on large scale.<br>
3<br><br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The present invention discloses a process that was developed by making improvements in the reaction conditions and isolation procedures, also the use of hazardous reagents like Sodium hydride; n-Butylithium is avoided, making the process safe and operable for large-scale commercial manufacture. The invention also discloses a process that gives a product having high purity levels essentially free of the 2-cyano isomer impurity (V) and low levels of side reaction products and precursors. The product manufactured by the process of the present invention has a better intrinsic dissolution profile when compared to the product prepared from the prior art patent process.<br><br>
The process involves 4 steps. In the first step, 2-Cyano-5-amino benzotrifluoride is reacted with Methacryloyl chloride in N,N-Dimethyl acetamide as solvent. The product is then isolated after quenching the reaction mass in water. In the second step, N-(4-Cyano-3-trifluoromethylphenyl)-2-methyl prop-3-ene amide is reacted with m-chloro perbenzoic acid in chloroform to get N-(4-Cyano-3-trifluoromethylphenyl)-2 methyl 2,3-epoxy propionamide. In the third step, N-(4-Cyano-3-trifluoromethylphenyl) - 2-methyl-2,3-epoxy propionamide is reacted with 4-fluoro thiophenol in toluene and THF to get N-[4-Cyano-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-3-[(4-fluoro phenyl) thio] - 2- hydroxy-2- methyl propionamide.<br>
In the final step N-[4-Cyano-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-3-[(4 fluoro phenyl)thio]-2 hydroxy-2-methyl propionamide is oxidized using Peracetic acid in methylene chloride<br>
4<br><br>
as solvent to get N-[4 Cyano-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-3 [(4 fluoro phenyl) sulfonyl]-2 hydroxy-2 methyl propionamide. Peracetic acid solution can be conveniently prepared by methods known in the art, for example by slow addition of hydrogen peroxide to acetic acid under stirring with a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid.<br>
The product is purified using acetone and hexane to give bicalutamide having uniform particle size, free-flowing powder characteristics and markedly higher intrinsic dissolution.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention discloses a process for the manufacture of bicalutamide of a very high purity and having a dissolution profile better than that produced by processes known in the art.<br>
In a preferred aspect of the invention, a process for producing N-(4-Cyano-3-trifluoromethylphenyl)-2-methyl prop-3-ene amide (II) by the reaction of 2-cyano-5- -trifluoromethyl aniline with methacryloyl chloride is disclosed. The reaction is preferably performed in a polar aprotic solvent selected from dimethyl formamide, dimethyl acetamide or N-methyl pyrrolidone. The most preferred solvent is dimethyl acetamide and the preferred temperature for addition of methacryloyl chloride is -10 to 10°C. The improvement in the reaction is in the quenching of the reaction mass in water, preferably done slowly over a period of few hours. Depending on the scale of operation the time period required for quenching could vary from 2 hours to 15 hours. More preferably the quenching time is between 6 to 12 hours. The slow quenching of the reaction in water produces the compound (II) directly as a solid in a pure form without having to undertake cumbersome column_ purification, thus avoiding solvents such as diethyl ether and petroleum ether.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, the compound (II) is oxidized to compound of formula (III) by m-chloro perbenzoic acid. The compound (III) is initially obtained as oil. The<br>
5<br><br>
improvement consists of elimination of impurities by stirring with chilled isopropanol, for a sufficient period of time to dissolve the impurities and their removal by filtration, thus avoiding purification by column chromatography.<br>
In yet another aspect of the invention, compound (III) is reacted with 4-fluoro thiophenol in presence of a base such as an alkali metal alkoxide or hydroxide in a mixture of an ether and a hydrocarbon solvent to obtain compound (IV). The base could be selected from sodium or potassium hydroxides or t-butoxides. Preferably, sodium t-butoxide is used along with tetrahydrofuran and toluene as solvents. The compound (IV) is isolated initially as oil from which impurities are eliminated by stirring a mixture of ethyl acetate and n-hexane for a sufficient period of time to dissolve the impurities, thus avoiding purification by column chromatography.<br>
In yet another aspect of the invention, compound (IV) is oxidized to compound (I) by means of peracetic acid solution in a solvent such as dichloromethane. Peracetic acid is prepared by methods known in the art, for example, by slow addition of a 50% solution of hydrogen peroxide into a vessel containing acetic acid with a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid under stirring. The content of peracetic acid in this solution is usually between 8 to 20%, more preferably between 12 to 16%. It is surprisingly found that use of peracetic acid reduces the amount of impurity such as sulfoxide formed to very negligible extent and the reaction proceeds^ to completion, hence the content of unreacted sulfide in the product is negligible. Thus the product (I) is of sufficient purity to be obtained directly as a solid without column purification. This compares very favourably with prior art processes that yield a product having considerable amounts of the sulfide (IV) and sulfoxide (VI) impurities.<br>
Generally, in a process for making an active pharmaceutical ingredient, there are associated impurities that contaminate the product. These arise from impurities present in the starting material, or competing reactions resulting in by-products, or impurities resulting from incomplete reactions or overreacted products. Other sources are the<br>
6<br><br>
solvents used in the process that tend to get embedded in the crystal lattice and it is difficult to remove the traces of these solvents.<br>
The starting material for bicalutamide, viz., 2-cyano-5-amino benzotrifluoride is usually contaminated with the isomeric 2-cyano-3 -amino benzotrifluoride (VII).<br><br><br><br>
This impurity undergoes the same reactions and is present in the final product as the 2-cyano isomer (V). Till date the only method available was column purification at various stages to successively reduce the impurity, or repeated crystallizations of the final product. It has been surprisingly found that stirring intermediate (III) with chilled isopropanol and intermediate (IV) with a mixture of ethyl acetate and hexane effectively removes the corresponding isomers at those stages to acceptable limits. Thus there is<br>
provided by the process of the present invention, bicalutamide having purity by HPLC of 99.5%, more preferablyJ99.8%, having contents of the compounds of formulae VI each less than 0.1%.<br><br><br><br>
In yet another aspect, the invention provides a process for producing a non-hygroscopic, free-flowing, anhydrous bicalutamide produced by crystallization from acetone and hexane.<br>
The process of the present invention is illustrated by the following examples.<br>
