				<td>BACKGROUND<br>
Ozonolysis reactions have been traditionally performed by bubbling O3 through either an aqueous phase or an organic liquid phase containing a substrate to be chemically modified, such as molecules containing carbon-carbon double bonds (i.e., C=C). The conventional methods, however, have several drawbacks. Firstly, since O3 is highly reactive, the reaction temperatures employed are typically sub-ambient (often around 0°C), wherein the O3 solubility in the liquid phase is low albeit typically greater than the solubility of dioxygen. For example, the O3 solubility in water is 0.105x10" g/mL at 0°C and 1.013bar pressure. Secondly, the O3 reacts with many traditional organic solvents, which not only decreases O3 availability for oxidizing the substrate, but also results in the formation of undesired products (e.g., waste) arising from solvent oxidation and increased solvent usage. Thirdly, the O3 solubility in the liquid phase is not sensitively tunable with pressure, which often limits the ability to control reaction rate and product selectivity.<br>
Thus, it would be beneficial to have a process and reaction conditions for performing ozonolysis with increased O3 solubility in the solvent. Additionally, it would be beneficial to have a process and reaction conditions for performing ozonolysis in a solvent that is substantially inert with respect to O3 so as to limit the number and amount of unfavorable side products. Further, it would be beneficial to have a process and reaction conditions for performing ozonolysis where the O3 solubility in the liquid phase is tunable with pressure so as to provide the ability to control reaction rate and product selectivity.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof. In the drawings, similar symbols typically identify similar components, unless context dictates otherwise. The illustrative embodiments described in the detailed description, drawings, and claims are not meant to be limiting. Other embodiments may be utilized, and other changes may be made, without departing from the spirit or scope of the subject matter presented here.<br>
I.	Introduction<br>
Generally, the present invention includes novel processes for increasing ozone concentrations in liquids and for performing ozonolysis reactions. Ozone has a critical temperature (Tc) of -12.15 °C (261 K), a critical pressure (Pc) of 55.73 bar, and a critical<br>
density ( ρc) of 540 kg/m3. In the ozonolysis process, the substrate (e.g., molecule containing C=C) is either dissolved or emulsified in liquid carbon dioxide or carbon dioxide-expanded solvents. In order to increase ozone concentrations in liquids, ozone (O3) containing gas stream, produced using either air or oxygen in an ozone generator, is added to the liquid phase (e.g., liquid carbon or carbon dioxide-expanded solvents) at temperatures preferably between about 1-1.2 times the critical temperature of O3 (expressed in K). The ozone is compressed to pressures preferably between about 0.5-2 times the critical pressure of O3. Solubility of O3 in liquid CO2 has been determined to increase by nearly an order of magnitude when the pressure is increased from approximately 51 to 65 bar. Under these conditions, it has been shown that the O3 is stable when mixed with liquid CO2, and the O3 can cleave carbon-carbon double bonds in substrates, especially such as those in the context of the bio-refinery, producing building blocks for synthesis of a variety of industrial chemicals. The reaction proceeds via intermediates that are meta-stable, but further oxidation or reduction subsequent to the primary ozone oxidation produces molecules of lower mass, which are commonly suitable as building blocks for chemical synthesis. As an example, it has now been shown that ozonolysis of methyl oleate, CH3(CH2)7CH=CH(CH2)7C(=O)OCH3, in liquid CO2 and C02-expanded liquids, produces carboxylic acids, dicarboxylic acids, and aldehydes.<br>
The ozonolysis process of the present invention may be employed to cleave carbon-carbon double bonds in substrates, especially such as those in the context of the bio-refinery, producing building blocks for synthesis of a variety of industrial chemicals. The reaction proceeds via intermediates that are meta-stable, but further oxidation or reduction subsequent to the primary ozone oxidation produces molecules of lower mass, suitable as building blocks for chemical synthesis. In liquid CO2, ozone density increases significantly close to its critical point, which allows for increasing the solubility of ozone and the capability of tuning the ozone concentration in the liquid phase for a particular purpose. Also, ozone preferentially oxidizes many olefinic substrates in CO2 and CXL. For methyl oleate ozonation, the solvent system produces the following: In CO2, nonanal, nonanoic acid, and nonanedoic acid are produced; In CO2 expanded hexane, nonanol, nonanoic acid, nonanedoic acid are produced; and in CO2 expanded methanol, nonanedoic acid and nonanoic acid are produced.<br>
The significant characteristics of the new process are as follows: (i) The O3 is stable in the preferred solvent due to its non-reactivity at preferred reaction conditions; (ii) At the preferred reaction temperatures, the O3 solubility in the solvent may be increased by about an order of magnitude with relatively small changes in pressure. This tunability provides an ability to control reaction rates and product selectivity; (iii) Reduced flammability hazards; (iv) Low toxicity of solvent; (v) Facile product separation.<br>
Because of its high oxidation potential (E° = 2.075 V in acid and 1.246 V in base), ozone has been investigated as a powerful and environmentally benign oxidant in that it eventually decomposes to atmospheric oxygen. For example, ozonolysis of methyl oleate, CH3(CH2)7CH=CH(CH2)7C(=O)OCH3, followed by catalytic reduction in water gives yields of aldehydes approaching 90%. Detailed study of the meta-stable initial oxidation products has shown that 90% of the methyl oleate is transformed to 1,2,4-trioxolane, and 10% yield to peroxide oligomers (Figure 1A). The latter should be accompanied by an equivalent molar amount of an aldehyde. The 1,2,4 trioxolane is formed by rearrangement of the initial product of 1,3 addition of ozone to the double bond, the 1,2,3-trioxolane. That rearrangement is understood to occur via a reversible dissociative process into an aldehyde and a zwitterionic peroxide. Figure IB shows the reaction scheme, which is expanded to display the complexity of intermediates that this dissociative process generates.<br>
Despite the likelihood of seven or so intermediates (not counting geometric isomers), only a pair of products is formed, the aldehyde and the carboxy ester aldehyde. Significantly, if the ozonolysis reaction is followed by completion of the oxidation process, the products are a carboxylic acid and a dicarboxylic acid (Figure 1C).<br>
II.       Ozonolysis<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention provides improved processes and reaction conditions for performing ozonolysis with increased O3 solubility in the liquid solvent (i.e., liquid medium). The processes and reaction conditions for performing ozonolysis can include the use of a liquid solvent that is substantially inert with respect to O3 so as to limit the number and amount of unfavorable side products. The ozonolysis process can be performed where the O3 solubility in the liquid phase is tunable with pressure so as to provide the ability to control reaction rate and product selectivity. Such processes and reactions can be achieved through the use of liquid CO2 (Pc, CO2 = 73.76 bar; Tc, CO2 = 31.1 °C or 304.25 K) or C02-expanded liquids as the solvent medium.<br>
In one embodiment, the ozonolysis can be performed with liquid CO2 and various CO2 expanded solvent liquids, such as natural unsaturated acids (e.g., oleic acid) or methyl esters thereof. The reaction rate for ozonolysis is most likely limited by the low solubility of ozone in the liquid phase. The use of CO2 and CO2-expanded liquids (CXLs) as reaction media can improve 03 solubility as well as provide an inert environment for ozonolysis. In addition, non-flammable CO2 is also miscible with low polarity solvents such as n-hexane. The ozonolysis followed by an appropriate hydrolytic, reductive or oxidative step can produce carboxylic acids, dicarboxylic acids, terminal carboxy alcohols or carboxy aldehydes. Significantly, similar results can be expected with other fatty acids having two or three carbon-carbon double bonds.<br>
In one embodiment, ozonolysis can be performed in liquid CO2. It is shown herein that O3 is stable in liquid CO2 and does not substantially react with CO2. The solubility of O3 in liquid CO2 can be tuned continuously (e.g., increasing solubility up to about an order of magnitude) with relatively small changes in pressure around the critical pressure of ozone. For example, the solubility of O3 in liquid CO2 at -0.7 °C (272.45 K) (e.g., 1.044 Tc, O3) was experimentally determined to be approximately 0.006 absorbance unit at 52.4 bar (0.94 Pc, 03) and 0.06 absorbance unit at 65.5 bar (1.18 Pc, 03). Thus, the sensitive tunability of O3 solubility in liquid CO2 is related to the extreme compressibility of O3 in the vicinity of its critical point.<br>
O3 is in the vicinity of its critical temperature (i.e., between 1 and 1.25 Tc, O3) at -0.7 °C (272.45 K). Hence, ozone compressibility (and therefore its density) will increase sharply as the pressure is isothermally increased beyond its critical pressure (e.g., above about 55.6 bar). On the other hand, air and O2, which are the background gases in the O3 stream at -0.7 °C (272.45 K) are sufficiently far removed from their respective critical temperatures, and hence behave like ideal gases in the 50.6-66.9 bar pressure range, without displaying any sharp increase in compressibility. As such, even though the O3 is present in dilute concentrations, such as on the order of a few mole percentage either in the air stream or in the O2 stream, its compressibility, and therefore its density, increases sharply in the vicinity of its critical pressure, causing it to selectively dissolve in liquid CO2. This phenomenon is akin to the increased dissolution of near-critical CO2 in organic solvents as the pressure is increased beyond its critical pressure. Other advantages of increasing ozone concentration in CO2 or C02-expanded liquids as the solvent medium are as follows: (i) reduced flammability hazards due to the presence of dense CO2, which is a flame retardant, in the gas phase; (ii) CO2 is less toxic than most<br>
organic solvents; (iii) use of CO2 is considered environmentally benign if it is derived from existing, non-sequestered sources; and (iv) products can be easily separated from CO2 solvent by pressure reduction.<br>
The ozonolysis medium for the first step can be any liquid CO2 at a variety of temperatures that are close to the critical temperature of ozone. The temperature of the ozone in liquid CO2 can be between 0.75 and 1.5 Tc of ozone, more preferably from about 0.9 to about 1.35 Tc of ozone, and most preferably from about 0.95 to about 1.25 Tc of ozone. Preferred temperatures of ozone in liquid CO2 can be about 1, about 1.1, and about 1.15 Tc of ozone. The temperature as a function of the Tc is expressed in absolute units (Kelvin or Rankine); however, the temperature and temperature ranges can be converted to other units.<br>
The ozonolysis medium for the first step can be any liquid CO2 at a temperature close to the critical temperature of ozone and a suitable pressure close to the critical pressure. The pressure of the ozone in liquid CO2 can be between 0.75 and 1.5 Pc of ozone, more preferably from about 0.9 to about 1.35 Pc of ozone, and most preferably from about 0.95 to about 1.25 Pc of ozone. Preferred pressures of ozone in liquid CO2 can be about 1, about 1.1, and about 1.15 Pc of ozone. Stated differently, the pressure of the ozone in liquid CO2 can be above about 40.5 bar, between about 45.6 bar and 76 bar, more preferably from about 50.7 bar to about 65.9 bar, and most preferably from about 54.7 bar to about 60.8 bar. Preferred pressures of ozone in liquid CO2 can be about 52.7 bar, about 5517 bar, and about 59.8 bar. The pressure as a function of Pc can be expressed in atmospheres (atm) or bar, and appropriate unit changes can be made for other pressure units.<br>
The ozonolysis medium for the first step can be any liquid CO2 having a variety of ozone densities that are close to and preferably above the critical density of ozone. The density of ozone can be between 0.75 and 1000 ρc, more preferably from about 0.9 to about 100 ρc, and most preferably from about 0.95 to about 10 ρc of ozone.<br>
The ozonolysis reaction is exothermic and the solvent can moderate the reaction rate, and therefore the rate of heat generation. Solvents, either inert or more inert compared to the substrate, act as a heat sink to absorb the heat of reaction. However, there are instances where a substrate can also be the solvent when provided in an amount sufficient to function as the solvent as well as provide sufficient substrate for the ozonolysis reaction.<br>
Ozonolysis can be conducted in liquid solvents such as organic acids, alcohols, methylene chloride, ethyl acetate, THF, and even water; however, they can produce an array of intermediate peroxides. Water is desirable, but such reactions for higher molecular weight acids and esters can require the use of biphasic liquid systems. Alcohols are attractive because of good solubility relationships and in part because the solvent can reflect the alkyl group of the ester. The disadvantage of alcohols as solvents for ozonolysis is their susceptibility to oxidation, a factor that can present a hazard. In the present invention a solvent system such as a carbon dioxide expanded liquid (CXL), generated with low molecular weight alcohols, methanol and ethanol, can be used.<br>
The effectiveness of the liquid solvents that are CXLs and other CXLs in catalytic oxidations can be increased using pure molecular oxygen. Their advantages include the high solubility of O2 (e.g., as much as 100 fold over the organic solvent) and the safety benefit of a medium that is non-combustible and that will dominate the vapor phase in equilibrium with the reaction medium. In addition to process intensification based on increased oxidant solubility, molecular transport in CXLs is high compared to most media. Further, CXLs based on polar alcohols display that polarity in increased reaction rates compared to nonpolar media such as supercritical CO2, or hydrocarbons.<br>
Methanol-based CXLs can be used as a liquid medium for the oxidative cleavage of the methyl ester of oleic acid and those of higher unsaturated acids. Fatty acids such as palmitic acid exhibit limited solubility in either methanol or supercritical CO2. The solubility of palmitic acid in supercritical CO2 is on the order of 10-4 mole fraction even at pressures up to 150 bar. For example, soybean oil can also be used as a liquid medium for ozonolysis. The emulsion disappears and the methanol/soybean oil interface reappears when the CO2 is released. This observation indicates the possibility of performing ozonolysis of fatty acid substrates dispersed as emulsion in CO2-expanded methanol. Thus, carbon dioxide expanded methanol appears to be extremely well suited to ozone oxidation of the methyl esters of unsaturated acids to produce difunctional molecules of lower molecular weight and of significance as products of the bio-refinery. However, our results show that O3 may attack methanol especially if the concentration of methanol is substantially higher than the substrate.<br>
Some examples of solvents for a CXL that can be used for ozonolysis include: light hydrocarbon (C4 or lower) liquids, methanol, ethanol, lower alcohols (e.g., C4-C10), higher alcohols (e.g., C10-C20) hexane, SF6, xenon, water, aqueous solutions, fluorocarbon solvents, highly oxygenated molecules, highly fluorinated molecules, CF3CO2H, ionic<br>
liquids, strong liquid acids, H2SO4, HSO3F, HSO3CF3, organic acids, saturated hydrocarbons, liquid substrates for ozonolysis, combinations thereof, and the like. The solubility of ozone in any of the aforementioned solvents can be increased by preparing a CXL as described herein.<br>
In some instances, it can be preferable for the solvent in a CXL to be inert. Some examples of possible inert solvents for a CXL that can be used for ozonolysis can include: SF6, xenon, water, aqueous solutions, fluorocarbon solvents, highly oxygenated molecules, highly fluorinated molecules, CF3C02H, H2S04, HSO3F, and HSO3CF3.<br>
Experiments have shown that some non-inert solvents may be used if the O3 selectively attacks the substrate over the solvent (such is the case when using methanol as a solvent additive). That is, a liquid substrate can be used as a solvent in instances where the substrate desired to be reacted is more reactive with ozonolysis. This allows ozone to react more with the desired substrate rather then the solvent (e.g., possible substrate when used in inert or more inert solvents). For example, some substrate candidates, such as vegetable oils including soybean oil, which are known to be reactive with ozone can be used as solvents when the desired substrate is more reactive in comparison. In this context, the solvent is the more inert component of a solvent-substrate system. Thus, the solvent is the liquid that is either totally or substantially inert to ozone attack, or is less preferentially attacked by ozone in the presence of a more reactive substrate.<br>
Some examples of possible non-inert solvents for a CXL that can be used for ozonolysis can include: methanol, ethanol, lower alcohols (e.g., C4-C10), higher alcohols (e.g., C10-C20) hexane, ionic liquids, liquid acids, organic acids, and saturated hydrocarbons.<br>
In one embodiment, the ozonolysis process of the present invention can be used for oxidative cleavage of oils and fats, such as unsaturated fatty acids. The double bonds in unsaturated fatty acids provide reactive sites for performing a variety of transformations. Accordingly, oxidative scission of olefins can be obtained with ozonolysis. As shown in Figure 2A, this highly selective reaction initially forms an ozonide, which can go on yield either aldehydes or carboxylic acids, with reductive or oxidative workup, respectively. This method is particularly attractive for producing carboxylic acids containing an odd number of carbon atoms in the polymethylene backbone. For example, industrially, azelaic acid is produced from oleic acid via ozonolysis, and is used in the manufacture of plasticizers, lubricants, hydraulic oils and cosmetics. It also is used as an anti-bacterial in acne treatments. Potential substrates for<br>
this ozonolysis reaction are extensive, and include fatty acids, their esters, and other sources of oil and fats.<br>
In one embodiment, the ozonolysis process can be used for preparing ingredients and reagents for perfume and fragrance chemistry. For example, ozonation of terpenes can be used to preparing ingredients and reagents. Oxygenated compounds form the bulk of most odiferous chemistry, so it is not surprising that the ozonolytic fission of alkenes is used extensively in the perfume and fragrance industries. There is an extensive chemistry associated with the production of various fragrant molecules from the terpenes, and the majority of synthetic routes begin with the ozonolytic cleavage of an allylic moiety within the terpene molecule. For example, ozonolysis of the terpene, (+)-p-menth-l-ene can form, by reductive workup, (-)-3-isopropyl-6-oxoheptanal. This molecule can then undergo a variety of reactions to form several fragrant molecules (e.g., new mown hay, minty note, lily of the valley, bergamot-like, rose/orange blossom, and the like) as shown in Figure 2B.<br>
In one embodiment, the ozonolysis process can be used for preparing active agents for pharmaceutical products or reagents for making pharmaceutical products. Ozonolysis of suitable substrates, such as natural products or bioactive agents, can be used to prepare new bioactive agents or derivatives of various biological active molecules. For example, oxandrolone is an anabolic steroid used to promote weight gain in patients who have experienced surgery, chronic infection or severe trauma. It also relieves bone pain associated with osteoporosis. It was originally developed by G.D. Searle Company and was synthesized from methylandrostanolone via a multistep route involving the use of highly toxic OSO4 and Pb(OAc)4. An alternative route for multi kilogram quantities of USP Oxandrolone has been developed by Cedarburg Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which utilizes an ozonolysis reaction to produce a key intermediate acid in good yields while avoiding the use of highly toxic, persistent reagents and the associated problems with the accumulation of hazardous waste. As shown in Figure 2C, the ozonolysis process of the present invention can be used to prepare oxandrolone in a safer, more economical process.<br>
In another example, the ozonolysis process of the present invention can be used to prepare antibiotics, such as cefaclor and ceftibuten, from suitable substrates. Cefaclor and ceftibuten are compounds belonging to a class of medications called cephalosporin antibiotics. They are effective against a wide range of infections and were discovered by Shionogi and Co. Ltd., Osaka, Japan. Originally they were produced synthetically from<br>
penicillin sulfoxides, but attempts to reduce the cost of production by scientists at the Schering Plough Research Institute have resulted in synthetic routes from cephalosporin C broths. A key step in this route is an ozonolysis step which converts the 3-exomethylene cephalosporin (1) into 3 -hydroxycephem (2). As shown in Figure 2D, the ozonolysis process of the present invention can be used to prepare 3-hydroxycephem (2) in a safer, more economical process.<br>
In another example, the ozonolysis process of the present invention can be used to prepare 2-Hydroxyindan-2-carboxaldehyde. Pfizer previously developed a multi-kilogram scale synthesis for the 2-indanone derived aldehyde, 2-hydroxyindan-2-carboxaldehyde, which is used in a reductive animation reaction. 2-Indanone undergoes a Grignard addition with vinylmagnesium bromide to yield a tertiary allylic alcohol. This undergoes ozonolysis in methanol, and subsequently the solvent traps the carbonyl oxide intermediate to form the methoxy-hydroperoxide. The hydroperoxide is the reduced with sodium bisulfite to form a stable bisulfite adduct which is used in the reductive amination in preference to the aldehyde. As shown in Figure 2E, the ozonolysis process of the present invention can be used to prepare 2-hydroxyindan-2-carboxaldehyde in a safer, more economical process.<br>
In one embodiment, the ozonolysis process of the present invention can be useful for non-olefin oxidation reactions. For example, the non-olefin oxidation reactions can be the oxidation of benzylic substrates and the like via ozonolysis. Accordingly, the chemistry of ozonolysis of organics substrates is not limited to the selective cleavage of double bonds. It has been shown that ozone can efficiently oxidize substituted benzylic compounds to their corresponding benzaldehydes and benzoic acids using a transition metal catalyst. As such, solvent and reaction conditions described herein and using manganese(II) acetate as the catalyst, the oxidation of toluene derivatives can be directed to either the aldehyde or the carboxylic acid products. The only off-gas produced is oxygen. The ozonolysis process of the present invention can be used to prepare benzaldehydes and benzoic acids in a safer, more economical process.<br>
In one embodiment, the ozonolysis process of the present invention can be used for the production of singlet oxygen. The production of singlet oxygen from ozone has received some attention recently. Conventional methods for production involve irradiating oxygen gas with ultraviolet light in the presence of a sensitizer, such as tetraphenylporphyrin. The presence of large quantities of dioxygen, organic solvents and light, in addition to the costs of special gas /liquid photoreactors, have discouraged<br>
industrial application and limited the industrial use to small scale applications in flavor<br>
and perfume production. Consequently, dark methods of producing 1O2 have been<br>
extensively investigated, with the catalytic conversion of hydrogen peroxide by<br>
molybdate being the most attractive. Ozone can also be used to produce 1O2 and it has<br>
been shown that l,l'-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene promotes splitting of ozone to<br>
give     1O2.	Accordingly,     the     ozone     in     CO2     or     CXL     along     with<br>
l,l'-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene can be used to produce 1O2. Also, by reductive recycling of (e.g., hydrogenating) the oxidized form of the ferrocene catalyst, a continuous process can be conducted to produce 1O2.<br>
In one embodiment, the ozonolysis process of the present invention can be used for the oxidation of methane. The enhanced ozone solubility in CO2 or CXL can be used for the oxidation of methane via ozonolysis. Previously, oxidation of methane has been reported to transform methane to protonated formaldehyde in super acid media. In such powerful acid solutions, methane has also been reported to be oxidized, along with oligomerization, to protonated acetone or to the related alkyl carbenium ion. Now, such transformations can be performed with ozone in CO2 or CXL.<br>

Examples of fats and oils are selected from the group consisting of animal fat, beef tallow, borneo tallow, butterfat, camelina oil, candlefish oil, canola oil, castor oil, cocoa butter, cocoa butter substitutes, coconut oil, cod-liver oil, coriander oil, corn oil, cottonseed oil, flax oil, hazelnut oil, hempseed oil, herring oil, illipe fat, jatropha oil, kokum butter, lanolin, lard, linseed oil, mango kernel oil, marine oils, meadowfoam oil, menhaden oil, milk fat, mowrah fat, mustard oil, mutton tallow, neat's foot oil, olive oil, orange roughy oil, palm oil, palm kernel oil, palm kernel olein, palm kernel stearin, palm olein, palm stearin, peanut oil, phulwara butter, pile herd oil, rapeseed oil, rice bran oil, safflower oil, sal fat, sardine oil, sasanqua oil, shea fat, shea butter, soybean oil, sunflower seed oil, tall oil, tallow, tsubaki oil, tung oil, vegetable oil, whale oil, triacylglycerols, diacylglycerols, monoacylglycerols, triolein, triglycerides of medium chain fatty acids, and derivatives, conjugated derivatives, genetically-modified derivatives and mixtures thereof. Other sources of suitable fatty acids include used cooking oils, float grease from wastewater treatment plants, animal fats such as beef tallow and pork lard, crude oils, "yellow grease," i.e., animal or vegetable oils and fats that have been used or generated as a result of the preparation of food by a restaurant or other food establishment that prepares or cooks food for human consumption with a free fatty acid content of less than 15%, and white grease, i.e., rendered fat derived primarily from pork, and/or other animal fats.<br>
In one embodiment, the substrate for ozonolysis can be soluble or substantially soluble or suspendable in liquid CO2. Some examples can include propylene, 1-butene, cyclopentene, cyclohexene, cycloheptene, cyclooctene, cis-stilbene, trans-stilbene, and similar types of compounds.<br>
However, some of the substrates that may be desired to be reacted through ozonolysis may not be soluble in either carbon dioxide or carbon dioxide-expanded liquids. Such immiscible liquid phases are not uncommon in industrial processes. In such cases, the interfacial surface area can be increased to overcome the mass transfer limitations, and thereby enhance the reaction rate. The interfacial surface area can be increased by intense agitation either with a mechanical stirrer or an ultrasonic mixing device, either of which creates an emulsion or dispersion of the substrate in the solvent phase. Other means for intense agitation can also be used to increase the interfacial surface.  Thus, the present invention can be used in reactions where the substrate is not<br>
completely soluble in the solvent. This is particularly true of important substrates from biomass including many components of bio-oils of the many kinds described herein.<br>
III.      Catalysis<br>
As shown in Figures 1A and IB, the reaction with the substrate to obtain a desired product may occur in two steps. The first step is ozonolysis in CO2 or CO2 expanded liquids (i.e., CXL), as described herein. The second step in the overall process may be catalytic or stoichiometric depending on the specific case under development. For example, it is reported that hydrolysis of the trioxolane will produce the corresponding dicarboxylic acids, and that hydrolysis in the presence of a mild reductant will produce the aldehydes. Examination of the balanced equations reveals that simple use of the states of oxidation in the trioxolane will produce one mole of ketone/aldehyde and one mole of carboxylic acid. In fact, gentle reduction during cleavage of the trioxolane will convert both emerging moieties to aldehydes while oxidative cleavage will produce two moles of carboxylic acid. Strong reduction will yield two moles of alcohol. Thus, new catalytic processes can be used for the second step in ozonolysis or ozone-based conversion of unsaturated acids and their esters into useful, lower molecular weight products.<br>
In one embodiment, the first and/or second step of the ozonolysis process can be performed with a catalytic system. Known catalytic systems are not effective at accelerating the use of the full oxidizing power of ozone in reactions in general and in the cleavage of carbon-carbon double bonds in particular. Catalysis of the initial oxidation process by a transition metal catalyst can moderate the oxidative power of the ozone. Catalysts generally moderate ozone in two ways; by elimination of the mechanistic pathways available to the ozone molecule, and, because of the apparent conversion of ozone into hydroxyl radical plus less reactive products, the selectivity of the oxidant is lost and the yields of desired products are diminished. In the absence of catalysts, ozone converts carbon-carbon double bond groups into meta-stable intermediates, 1,2,4-trioxolanes, that are well-suited to efficient second steps (solvolysis, oxidation, reduction) that may lead to a readily selected array of desirable products. However, the desirability of catalysis in the second step, the transformation of the 1,2,4-ozonide to desirable products, can be improved by catalysis, whether it be oxidation or reduction. Accordingly, catalysts can be used with the ozonolysis of substrates in CO2 and CXLs as described herein. Examples of some catalysis can include, with a view toward using transition metal ions as catalysts, iron(III) oxide, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, manganese,<br>
chromium, manganese (e.g., Mn(III) not Mn(VII)), osmium, ruthenium and rhenium, manganese porphyrins, manganese centered polyoxometallates, titanium, TiO2 combinations thereof, oxides thereof, and the like.<br>
IV.      Ozone Purification<br>
Additionally, the present invention provides process and reaction conditions for preparing ozone or increasing ozone purity. Ozone can be present in a gas, such as air or oxygen, or can be separated therefrom. Ozone generation is well known in the art. The ozone is often accompanied by the gas from which it was generated. Now, the ozone can be selectively purified from the original gas.<br>
In one embodiment, the ozone can be separated from oxygen or air in the presence of CO2 or CXL by increasing the pressure of the system at a temperature close to the Tc of ozone. That is, the same conditions for increasing ozone concentration in CO2 or CXL can be used for purifying ozone from the gas. As such, the CO2 or CXL compositions in the presence of ozone can be modulated by increasing pressure at a temperature close to the Tc without a substrate. The lack of a substrate allows the O3 to be separated from either an O2+O3 or an 03+air stream by being concentrated in the CO2 or CXL without reacting and degrading the ozone. The separation process can be performed by cooling the O2/air+O3 mixtures just below the critical temperature of O3 (e.g., -12°C or 261.15 K) in order to condense out the O3 by simply increasing the system pressure (e.g., a few tens of bars close to the critical pressure of O3). This method can be cheaper and easier than refrigeration techniques to separate O3.<br>
After the concentration of ozone is increased in CO2 or CXL, all of the gas not in the liquid can be removed. The ozone gas in the liquid can then be separated from the liquid so as to obtain purified ozone.<br>

In one embodiment, the liquid is a carbon dioxide expanded liquid comprised of light hydrocarbons (C4 or lower), methanol, ethanol, alcohols, hexane, SF6, xenon, water, fluorocarbon solvents, highly oxygenated molecules, highly fluorinated molecules, CF3CO2H, ionic liquids, strong liquid acids, H2SO4, HSO3F, HSO3CF3, organic acids, saturated hydrocarbons, or combinations thereof.<br>
EXPERIMENTAL 1.<br>
The ozone concentration measurements and the ozonolysis experiments were performed using a 10 cm3 titanium high pressure view cell. A schematic representation of the reactor system 10 is shown in Figure 3. The reactor system 10 is shown to include a high pressure reaction cell 12 that is cylindrical in shape, but can be in any other shape. The cell 12 is fitted with view window 14, such as sapphire windows at both ends, which are sealed with PEEK O-rings and screw caps (not shown). A spectrophotometer (not shown) (e.g., Ocean Optics fiber optic UV/Visible spectrophotometer) is used to measure UV/Visible spectra via the sapphire windows 14. The body of the cell 12 is fitted with a port for ozone input 16, a port for CO2 and/or CXL input 18, a port for a thermocouple 22 input 20, a port for a pressure transducer 26 input 24, and a port 28 for a safety rupture disk 30. The ozone input 16 can be fitted with a titanium frit (not shown) to ensure good mixing of the ozone with the contents of the cell 12. Samples can be withdrawn from<br>
either the liquid or gas phase via any of the ports. Mixing is performed using a magnetic stirrer bar (not shown) and temperature adjustments made using a circulating fluid thermal jacket (not shown) in contact with the cell 12. Temperature was monitored with the thermocouple 22, and controlled and recorded using a computer controlled data acquisition system 32 (Dasylab, measX GmbH &amp; Co.KG). Pressure was monitored with the pressure transducer 26, and controlled and recorded using the computer controlled data acquisition system 32.<br>
Ozone is generated by an ozone generator 34 (e.g., Praxair-Trailgaz Unizone™ Lo corona discharge ozone generator) from either a compressed air or oxygen source. The ozone containing gas stream 36 is then led to a pump 38 (e.g., Teledyne ISCO 500D syringe pump) where the ozone-containing stream fills the feed reservoir 40. The reservoir 40 contents are compressed to a pressure suitable for introduction into the reaction cell 12. Excess ozone is destroyed by passing the exiting gas stream over a magnesium oxide catalyst packed tube 42 followed by bubbling through an aqueous sodium hydroxide solution 44. The bottom left input port 18 is used to introduce carbon dioxide from a carbon dioxide source 46 and/or nitrogen from a nitrogen source 48 into the reaction cell 12, and also to remove products at the end of a reaction cycle. Products are collected by bubbling the product stream through a chilled solvent 50. The top port 28 houses a rupture disk 30 and can also be used for product collection.<br>

To guide the experiments in C02-expanded solvents, the miscibility and volumetric expansion of the following mixtures in dense CO2 can be determined in a Jurgeson® view cell at typical operating temperatures (10-25°C or 282.15-298.15 K). Description of the Jurgeson® view cell and the experimental procedure for measuring the volumetric expansion are given elsewhere (Ghezai Musie, Ming Wei, Bala Subramaniam, and Daryle H. Busch, "Catalytic Oxidations in Carbon Dioxide-based Reaction Media, including novel C02-expanded phases," Coord. Chem. Revs., 219-221, 789-820 (2001); Ming Wei, Ghezai T. Musie, Daryle H. Busch and Bala Subramaniam,"C02-expanded Solvents: Unique and Versatile Media for Performing Homogeneous Catalytic Oxidations," J. Am. Chem. Soc, 124, 2513-17 (2002)).<br>
3.<br>
Experiments were performed to determine liquid-phase O3 concentrations. In a typical experiment to determine ozone concentration in liquid CO2, a quantity of CO2 is introduced into the cell (maintained at a desired temperature) via one of the ports to a<br>
pressure at which CO2 forms a liquid phase and the cell pressure noted. The liquid level in the cell reaches above the windows allowing a complete path for a UV/Visible light spectrum through the liquid phase. The gas output (O2/O3 mixture) from the ozone generator is compressed using the ISCO syringe pump to a pressure above the cell pressure. The ozone containing mixture is then allowed to enter the cell through an inlet port and allowed to equilibriate before a UV/Visible spectrum of the liquid phase CO2 is measured. More ozone is added repeatedly and a UV/Visible spectrum measured after each addition, following equilibration, until the maximum desired pressure is reached.<br>
Ozone has two absorption bands in the UV/Visible region; a strong band with λmax = 253.7 nm and a weaker band with two maxima at 577 nm and 603 nm (Figure 4A and 4B, respectively). The intensity of the light absorbed by ozone at these wavelengths is directly proportional to the concentration of the ozone, and therefore absorption values can be used as a measure of the ozone concentration. The Chappuis band in the visible region was chosen because its intensity gave suitable absorption values at the ozone concentrations studied.<br>
The absorbance at 580 nm was measured for a solution of ozone in liquid carbon dioxide (T = 5.0 ± 0.2°C or 277.15 ± 0.2 K, P = 63.4 ± 1.4 bar). A known volume (0.52 mL) of this solution was then sampled in a stainless steel tube (Figure 3). This sample was allowed to expand slowly to room temperature and pressure (R.T.P.) and the escaping gas was bubbled through an aqueous solution of potassium iodide. The tubing was then flushed with compressed air, which was also bubbled through a KI solution. The KI solution was titrated with 4 × 10-4 mol dm-3 Na2S2O3 to determine the iodine concentration. The slight drop in cell pressure was compensated for by pumping in more O3/O2 gas mixture and the procedure was repeated three times. Values of E are shown in Table 1.<br>

When the gaseous output of the ozone generator is compressed into the reaction cell using the syringe pump, the concentration of ozone increases linearly with the total pressure (assuming ideal gas behavior at the ISCO pump conditions). Since the mole fraction of ozone in the output stream is constant, PO3 should increase proportionally with<br>
the total pressure. This behavior is confirmed in Figures 5 and 6 for both O2 and air as source gases for ozone production.<br>
5.<br>
When measuring the concentration of ozone dissolved in liquid carbon dioxide at -0.7°C (or 272.45 K), such linear behavior is not observed (Figures 7 and 8). A volume of liquid CO2 is introduced into the cell so that the gas/liquid interface is sufficiently high in the cell and the light path of the spectrophotometer is in the liquid phase throughout the experiments. The gas output from the ozone generator is then compressed using the syringe pump and the ozone mixture is pumped into the liquid carbon dioxide through a titanium frit to ensure good mixing. The ozone concentration in the liquid CO2 is then measured spectrophotometrically after allowing a period of time for equilibrium to be reached. As the critical pressure of ozone is approached (808 psi, 55.7 bar), there is a significant increase in the quantity of ozone dissolved in the liquid carbon dioxide. At 53.1 bar, the ozone concentration in the liquid phase is approximately 0.005 unit. At 62.1 bar however, the O3 concentration in the liquid phase is 0.05 unit, dramatically enhanced by more than order of magnitude. Similar behavior is observed over a range of temperatures.<br>

The use of CXLs has many advantages over the use of conventional neat solvents. By replacing a significant fraction of conventional organic solvents with carbon dioxide,<br>
the CXL mixtures enhance mass transfer and reaction rates, reduce waste, and make reactors inherently safer. Additionally, many classes of substrates have higher solubility in CXLs than in pure liquid or supercritical carbon dioxide. A CXL is created by expanding a conventional solvent with pressurized carbon dioxide to create a single phase mixture in which a measurable fraction of the liquid volume is attributable to the compressed carbon dioxide. The photograph data (not shown) indicate that the expansion of methanol to form a CXL. The meniscus shows that the total volume has increased by approximately 120% under these conditions (52.7 bar of carbon dioxide).<br>
7.<br>
The effect of temperature on CO2 expansion of a methanol/soybean oil binary composition was studied. The CO2 was used to expand a 6:1 methanol soybean binary composition at 296.15 K, 323.15 K and 338.15 K.. As shown in Figure 9, the temperature at 296 K had a more significant change in V/Vo as the pressure was increased. The miscibility of CO2 with the methanol+soybean binary mixture provides the opportunity to seek enhanced ozone solubility and safe selective biomass oxidation in this CXL system, as indicated above.<br>
8.<br>
Utilizing the advantages of CXLs for ozonolysis reactions is an attractive goal. However, studies have demonstrated that the choice of solvent to be expanded with carbon dioxide is important, since the reactivity of ozone is such that it will rapidly oxidize many organic solvents at the elevated pressures required to form the CXL. When ozone is added to CO2 expanded methanol the characteristic ozone bands in the UV/Visible spectra are not observed (Figure 10). The same observation is made when ozone is added to a hexane CXL (Figure 11). It has been widely reported, however, that ozonolysis reactions can be conducted in organic solvents, particularly methanol. Our attempts to measure ozone concentrations in neat methanol at 1.013 bar and -4°C (268.15 K) show no measurable concentration of dissolved ozone in the solvent (Figure 12; T = 276.15 K, P = 1.013 bar, 1500 mL ozone solution 50%, 1.0 A; O2 source @ 200 cfm, ozone bubbled through solvent). Furthermore, addition of the substrate methyl oleate to a sample of methanol through which ozone had been bubbled, showed no evidence of reaction (Figure 13). However, the UV/Visible spectra (Figure 14; T = 276.15 K, P = 1.013 bar, 0.5 mL methyl oleate in 9 mL methanol) taken following the addition of ozone to a methanolic solution of methyl oleate, indicate the formation of a product with a<br>
strong absorption band in the UV region (λmax = 284 nm). These observations indicate that ozone readily oxidizes methanol, but, kinetically, the reaction with methyl oleate is preferred. This can provide an indication that the substrate that is the solvent can be the target of ozone oxidation (e.g., methyl oleate as the substrate and solvent).<br>
9.<br>
Ozonolysis experiments were conducted on various substrates. In a typical substrate ozonolysis experiment, the substrate is introduced into the reaction cell maintained at ambient pressure and the desired reaction temperature, following which CO2 is added to create a liquid phase. Using the ISCO pump, the ozone containing gas is then pumped into the reaction cell to a predetermined pressure above that of the CCVsubstrate mixture. The ozone concentration is followed spectrophotometrically during the reaction. At the end of the batch reaction, samples are withdrawn from the CO2 liquid phase by depressurizing the effluent to a cold trap (maintained at -78°C or 195.15 K) in which the samples are collected and subsequently analyzed using GC/MS.<br>
10.<br>
The concentration of ozone dissolved in water was measured using UV/Visible spectrophotometry as increasing pressures of a gaseous mixture of O2 and O3 were applied. The intensity of the light absorbed by ozone at 580 nm is directly proportional to the concentration of the ozone and therefore absorption values can be used as a measure of the ozone concentration. In a typical measurement, water was introduced into the view cell so that the gas liquid interface was well above the light path of the Ocean Optics Fiber Optic spectrophotometer. The cell was then sealed and the temperature allowed to equilibrate. Temperature was controlled using a refrigerated bath circulating a heat transfer fluid through an aluminum jacket in thermal contact with the view cell. The gaseous output of the ozone generator was then compressed and pumped into the view cell using the ISCO syringe pump. Spectrophotometric measurements were taken as the pressure was increased. After each increase in pressure, the cell contents were thoroughly stirred, using a magnetic stirrer bar, for at least two minutes before a spectrophotometric measurement was taken.<br>
The spectra recorded at a series of pressures and temperatures (Figures 15, 16, and 17) clearly show that the concentration of ozone dissolved in water increases linearly as a function of pressure. There is no sharp enhancement of ozone concentration in water, as<br>
there is in liquid carbon dioxide, as the pressure increases through the critical pressure of ozone (808 psi, 55.7 bar). 11.<br>
In a typical experiment, a known quantity of the olefinic substrate was placed in a high pressure reaction cell and carbon dioxide was added to a pressure of 44.8 bar. The solution was cooled to the reaction temperature and then a gaseous mixture of ozone and oxygen was added to the reaction cell using an ISCO syringe pump until at least a twofold excess of ozone had been added. The mixture was left to react, with stirring, for several hours. Product collection was performed by slowly venting the liquid CO2 portion of the mixture through a cold (0°C or 273.15 K) trap consisting of methanol, hexane or dichloromethane. The cell was then re-pressurized with CO2 and vented through the trap a second time. The cell was then washed twice with the collection solvent. Product analysis was performed by GC/MS with relevant internal standards. Major products for each substrate studied are shown in Table 2.<br>

As shown in Figure 18, a high pressure reaction system 60 was constructed. The high pressure reaction system 60 can include many of the features shown in Figure 3. The high pressure reaction system 60 additionally includes a high pressure titanium reaction cell 62, incorporating an ultrasonic probe 64 (Figure 18). The ultrasonic probe 64 extends into the reaction cell 62 and is coupled thereto with a retaining plate 66. The retaining plate is further coupled to an ultrasonic transducer 68 that receives high frequency input from a signal generator 70 for the ultrasonic probe 64.<br>
The reaction system 60 was used to create emulsions of insoluble substrate in liquid CO2 in order to enhance the interphase mass transfer area for reaction between the substrate and O2. The stability of ozone, when ozone-containing solutions were subjected to ultrasonic mixing, was also investigated.<br>
In water, ultrasonic agitation was shown to increase the rate of ozone decomposition by at least two orders of magnitude as shown in Figure 19 (Kang, J-W., Lee, K-H., Koh, C-L, Nam, S-N., Korean Journal of Chemical Engineering 18 336 (2001)). Our research has shown that there is no such effect using dense phase carbon dioxide (Figure 20), probably due to the absence of the free radical propagation steps typical of the mechanism of ozone decomposition in water.<br>
