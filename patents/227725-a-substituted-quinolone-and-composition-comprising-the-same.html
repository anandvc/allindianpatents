Related Application<br>
This application claims priority to U.S. provisional application serial number 60/380,641, filed on May 14,2002.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention is in the field of medicinal chemistry. In particular, the invention relates to substituted quinolone carboxylic acids and their derivatives, which modulate, via a unique site, the effect of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) on the GABAA receptor complex in a therapeutically relevant fashion and may be used to ameliorate CNS disorders amenable to modulation of the GABAA receptor complex.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
GABA is the most abundant inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain. GABA controls brain excitability by exerting inhibitory functions on neuronal membranes by altering their permeability to specific ions. Binding of GABA to the GABAA-type (GABAA) receptor increases the permeability of neuronal membranes to chloride ions (C1-). In most neurons the relative C1- ion concentration is greater outside than the inside the membrane. Thus, selective permeability to CI- initiated by GABA binding allows C1- to flow down its electrochemical gradient into the cell. The majority of fast inhibitory synaptic transmission is a result of GABA binding to the GABAA receptors. GABAA receptors are ubiquitously expressed throughout the CNS with almost all neurons staining for their presence. The GABAA receptor is a hetero-pentameric protein structure of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor superfamily. Native GABAA receptors are formed from at least 19 related subunits. The subunits are grouped into α,β,δ,ε, ,and p families. The most prevalent combination of GABAA receptors is a<br>
stoichiometnc combination of the 2 x a, 2 x P, and 1 x y subunits, with the remaining<br>
subunits relegated to substituting for the j subunit during specific development<br>
expression or in highly specific brain region localization. The adult brain predominately<br>
express the alp2v2 subunit combination (60%) with the o2p3v2 and a3pny2 subunits<br>
comprising the majority (35%) of the remaining receptors. The relative effects of GAB A<br>
are influenced by the GABAA receptor subunit expressed in a specific brain region or<br>
neuronal circuit.<br>
The neurophysiological effects of GAB A result from a conformational change<br>
that occurs when GABA binds to the GABAA receptor. The GABAA receptor and the<br>
associated ion channel complex (GRC) is a h'gand-gated ion channel which recognizes<br>
many compounds that allosterically modulate the ability of GABA to bind to the GABAA<br>
receptor. The allosteric modulators have distinct sites on the GRC. These sites are<br>
separate and unique from the site that recognizes GABA. The most widely studied and<br>
characterized class of allosteric modulator of the GRC is that which interact with the<br>
benzodiazepine (BZ)-site.<br>
Alternative sites for modulating the GRC have been described. For example,<br>
neuroactive steroids are non-hormonal steroids that bind and functionally modulate the<br>
GRC. The current role of neuroactive steroids in GABAA receptor pharmacology is<br>
supported by overwhelming evidence. Electrophysiological and biochemical techniques<br>
have confirmed the capacity of neuroactive steroids to allosterically modulate the GRC<br>
through a unique site of action. Experimentally neuroactive steroids exhibit a<br>
pharmacological'profile similar, but not identical, to the benzodiazepines. Neuroactive<br>
steroids produce anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, and sedative-hypnotic properties.<br>
Certain antibacterial fluoroquinolone antibiotics have been implicated in clinical<br>
reports as the cause of convulsions in humans (Ball P (1986) Journal of Antimicrobial<br>
Chemotherapy. 18 SupplD 187-193; Simpson KJ, BrodieMJ( 1985) Lancet ii: 161,<br>
1985; Hori S, et al. (1987) Program and Abstracts of the Twenty-Seventh Interscience<br>
Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, New York 1987. Abstract 30,<br>
pg 101). Experimentally, fluoroquinolones have been demonstrated to produce<br>
convulsions and death in mice. Additionally, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs<br>
(NSAIDs) and their by-products have been reported to clinically and experimentally<br>
potentiate the convulsive effects of the fluoroquinolones. Concerns about the convulsant<br>
side-effects of fluoroquinolone antibacterial agents have led to an interest in the<br>
interaction of fluoroquinolones with the GABAA receptor. Convincing evidence has<br>
accumulated that suggests that they interact with the GRC to inhibit GABA action.<br>
Fluoroquinolones antagonize [3H]muscimol and [3H]GABA binding to the GRC with<br>
high micromolar potency. Electrophysiological studies have demonstrated that<br>
fluoroquinoiones alone weakly reduce GABA-evoked currents. As well, radioligand<br>
binding assays have shown that fluoroquinolones, in combination with NSAIDs, induce a<br>
conformational change in the GABAA receptor-chloride channel complex that is<br>
indicative of a pharmacologically relevant response consistent with functional<br>
antagonism of GABA.<br>
It is well-documented that modulation of the GRC can ameliorate anxiety, seizure<br>
activity, and insomnia. Thus, GABA and drugs that act like GABA or facilitate the<br>
effects of GABA (e.g., the therapeutically useful barbiturates and benzodiazepines (BZs)<br>
such as Valium) produce their therapeutically useful effects by interacting with specific<br>
modulatory sites on the GRC. None of the known drugs, however, are selectively potent<br>
at the a-2 subunit of the GABA receptor. Thus, they exhibit undesirable side effects of<br>
sedation, and in the case of fluoroquinolones, convulsions. There is presently a need for<br>
GRC modulators that are active without side effects.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to molecules that modulate the GRC with selective<br>
potency at the a-2 subunit of GABA to produce therapeutically useful effects without<br>
side effects. The present invention further relates to substituted quinolones represented<br>
by Formula I that act as enhancers of GABA-facilitated Cl'flux mediated through the<br>
GABAA receptor complex (GRC).<br>
The invention also relates to methods of treating disorders responsive to<br>
enhancement of GABA action on GABA receptors in a mammal by administering an<br>
effective amount of a compound of Formula I and by activation of the novel site which<br>
mediates the action of a compound of Formula I as described herein. The novel site is<br>
defined by exclusion criteria where a compound of Formula I does not act on known<br>
sites of the GRC which include the sites for GABA, benzodiazepines, neuroactive<br>
steroids, t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate/picrotoxin, barbiturates, 4'-chlorodiazepam,<br>
antibacterial quinolones, ivermectin, loreclezole/mefanamic acid, furosemide and<br>
propofol (E.R. Korpi, G. Grunder, H. Luddens, Progress Neurobiology 67:113-159,<br>
2002).<br>
The compounds of the present invention, being ligands for a unique site on the<br>
GRC, are therefore of use in the treatment and/or prevention of a variety of disorders of<br>
the central nervous system. Such disorders include anxiety disorders, such as panic<br>
disorder with or without agoraphobia, agoraphobia without history of panic disorder,<br>
animal and other phobias including social phobias, obsessive-compulsive disorder, stress<br>
disorders including post-traumatic and acute stress disorder, and generalized or<br>
substance-induced anxiety disorder, neuroses; convulsions; acute and chronic pain;<br>
cognitive disorders; insomnia; migraine; and depressive or bipolar disorders, for example<br>
single-episode or recurrent major depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder, bipolar I and<br>
bipolar II manic disorders, and cyclothymic disorder.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention is directed to the use of the site that<br>
mediates the activity of compounds of Formula I as enhancers or inhibitors of GAB Afacilitated<br>
Cl" conductance mediated through the GABAA receptor complex.<br>
Enhancement of GABA-rnediated chloride conductance is useful for the treatment and<br>
prevention of such disorders as anxiety and stress related disorders, depression and other<br>
affective disorders, epilepsy and other seizure disorders, insomnia and related sleep<br>
disorders, and acute and chronic pain. Inhibition of GABA-mediated chloride<br>
conductance is useful for the treatment and prevention of disorders related to learning<br>
and memory such as mild cognitive impairment, age related cognitive decline, senile<br>
dementia, Alzhiemer's disease, sleep disorders involving reduced wakefulness such as<br>
narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia.<br>
Also, an aspect of the present invention is to provide a pharmaceutical<br>
composition useful for treating disorders responsive to the enhancement GABAfacilitated<br>
Cl" flux mediated through the GRC, containing an effective amount of a<br>
compound of Formula I in a mixture with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carriers or diluents.<br>
Compounds useful in the present invention have not been heretofore reported.<br>
Thus, the present invention is also directed to novel substituted quinolones having the<br>
structure of Formula I.<br>
Further, the present invention is directed to 3H, 35S, 36C1,125I, 131I and 14C<br>
radiolabeled compounds of Formula I and their use as a radioligand for their binding site<br>
on the GRC.<br>
Additional embodiments and advantages of the invention will be set forth in part<br>
in the description that follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or may<br>
be learned by practice of the invention. The embodiments and advantages of the<br>
invention will be realized and attained by means of the elements and combinations<br>
particularly pointed out in the appended claims.<br>
It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the<br>
following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive<br>
of the invention, as claimed.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
Fig. 1 depicts the potentiating effect of 7-chloro-l-ethyl-6-(l,2,3,4-<br>
tetrahydronaphthyl-l-amino)-4-oxo-l,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (C3, S^M)<br>
on GABA (G, 10 ^M) induced chloride currents in embryonic rat hippocampal neurons.<br>
These data demonstrate that C3 is a positive efficacy modulator of GAB A-gated chloride<br>
channels.<br>
Fig. 2 depicts receptor subunit selectivity and dose-dependent positive efficacy of<br>
7-chloro-l-ethyl-6-(l,2,3,4-tetrahydro-naphthyl-l-amino)-4-oxo-l,4-dihydroquinoline-3-<br>
carboxylic acid (compound 3, CMP 3) versus diazepam (DZP) on GABA induced<br>
currents (loABA)in expressed human GABAA receptors containing CL^2f2 versus o^pVh<br>
subunits.<br>
Fig. 3 depicts a comparison of 7-chloro-l-ethyl-6-(l,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthyl-] -<br>
amino)-4-oxo-l,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (compound 3) and Diazepam<br>
(DZP) on time spent in the dark in the Mouse Light-Dark Transition Model of Anxiety.<br>
These data demonstrate that the anti-anxiety effects, as shown by the increase in the rime<br>
spent in the dark, of compound 3 are comparable to that of DZP.<br>
Fig. 4 depicts a comparison of 7-chloro-l-ethyl-6-(l,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthyl-lamino)-<br>
4-oxo-l,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (CMP 3) and Diazepam (DZP) on<br>
punished responding as measured by the number of licks during a 3 minute period in the<br>
Vogel Model of Anxiety using 24 hour thirsted rats. These data demonstrate that the<br>
anti-anxiety effects, as shown by increased punished licking, of compound 3 are<br>
comparable to that of DZP.<br>
Fig. 5 depicts an effect of 7-chloro-l-ethyl-6-(l,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthyl-lamino)-<br>
4-oxo-l14-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (compound 3) on 2 nM [ S]TBPS<br>
binding to rat cortex in the absence (open circles) or presence or of 3 uM (closed circle)<br>
and 10 nM (closed square) of the GABAA receptor antagonist (+)-bicuculline. These<br>
data demonstrate the absolute dependence of compound 3 on GAB A for efficacy and that<br>
compound 3 is allosterically coupled to and does not act directly on the [ 5S]TBPS site.<br>
Fig. 6 depicts an effect of 7-chloro-l-ethyl-6-(l,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthyl-lamino)-<br>
4-oxo-l,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (compound 3, closed circle),<br>
clonazepam (open circle) and 5ct-pregnan-3a-ol-20-one (3a,5a-P, open square) on 0.2<br>
nM [3H}flunitrazepam binding to BZ receptors in rat cortex. These data demonstrate<br>
that compound 3 is allosterically coupled to and does not act directly on the BZ receptor.<br>
Fig. 7 depicts an effect of 7-chloro-l-ethyl-6-(l,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthyl-lamino)-<br>
4-oxo-l,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (compound 3, closed circle) and<br>
GABA (open circle) on 5 nM [3H]muscimol binding to the GABAA receptor in rat<br>
cortex. These data demonstrate that compound 3 does not act directly on the GABAA<br>
receptor.<br>
Fig. 8 depicts an effect of 10 (aM 7-chloro-l-ethyl-6-( 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthyll-<br>
amino)-4-oxo-l,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (compound 3, closed circle) or<br>
100 nM 3a,5a-P (open square) on 5a-pregnan-3a,20a-diol (5a,20a-diol, open circle)<br>
inhibition of 2 nM [33S]TBPS binding to rat cortex. As predicted, increasing<br>
concentrations of 5a,20oc-diol (a partial agonist) antagonize the effect of 3a,5cc-P (a full<br>
agonist). The inability of 5a,20a-diol to antagonize the effect of compound 3<br>
demonstrates that compound 3 does not act directly on the neurosteroid site of the GRC.<br>
Fig. 9 depicts the effect of 7-chloro-l-ethyl-6-(l,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthyl-lamino)-<br>
4-oxo-l,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (compound 3) on 2 nM [35S]TBPS<br>
binding to rat cortex in the absence (open circle) or presence of 30 nM norfloxacin<br>
(closed circle) and 100 |o.M norfloxacin (closed square). The inability of norfloxacin to<br>
produce a dose-dependent rightward parallel shift of the compound 3 dose-response<br>
demonstrates that compound 3 does not act directly at the same site as the antibacterial<br>
quinolone norfloxacin.<br>
Fig 10 depicts the dissociation of 2 nM [3SS]TBPS binding from rat cortex<br>
initiated by 10 joM 7-chloro-l-ethyl-6-(l,2,3,4-terrahydronaphthyl-l-amino)-4-oxo-l,4-<br>
dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (compound 3) in the absence (closed square) or<br>
presence (closed triangle) of 30 uM pentobarbital. The ability of pentobarbital to<br>
accelerate the dissociation of [35S]TBPS binding indicates that compound 3 and the<br>
barbiturate pentobarbital do not share a common site of action.<br>
Fig, 11 depicts the effect of 7-chloro-l-ethyl-6-(l&gt;2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthyl-lamino)-<br>
4-oxo-l,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (compound 3) on 2 nM [35S]TBPS<br>
binding to rat cortex in the absence (open circle) or presence of 0.3 )aM (closed circle), 1<br>
jiM (closed square) and 30 uM Ro5-4864 (4'-chlorodiazepam, closed triangle). The<br>
inability of 4'-chlorodiazepam to produce a dose-dependent rightward parallel shift of<br>
the compound 3/[35S] TBPS dose-response curve demonstrates that compound 3 does not<br>
act directly at the same site as 4'-chlorodiazepam.<br>
Fig 12 depicts the dissociation of 2 nM [35S]TBPS binding from mouse forebrain<br>
initiated by 10 p.M 7-chloro-l-ethyl-6-(l,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthyl-l-amino)-4-oxo-l,4-<br>
dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (compound 3) in the absence (open circle) or<br>
presence (closed square) of 10 |iM ivermectin. The ability of ivermectin to accelerate<br>
the dissociation of [35S]TBPS binding indicates that compound 3 and ivermectin do not<br>
share a common site of action.<br>
Fig 13 depicts the dissociation of 2 nM [35S]TBPS binding from mouse forebrain<br>
initiated by 10 p.M 7-chloro-l-ethyl-6-(l,2)3,4-tetrahydronaphthyl-l-amino)-4-oxo-l,4-<br>
dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (compound 3) in the absence (open circle) or<br>
presence (closed square) of 10 jaM mefenamic acid. The ability of mefenamic acid to<br>
accelerate the dissociation of [3SS]TBPS binding indicates that compound 3 and<br>
mefenamic acid do not share a common site of action.<br>
Fig. 14 depicts the effect of 7-chloro-l-ethyl-6-(l,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthyl-lamino)-<br>
4-oxo-l,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (compound 3) on 2 nM [35S]TBPS<br>
binding to rat cerebellum in the absence (open circle) or presence of 30 joM furosemide<br>
(closed circle). The inability of furosemide to produce a dose-dependent rightward<br>
parallel shift of the compound 3 dose-response demonstrates that compound 3 does not<br>
act directly at the same site on the GRC as the loop-diuretic ftrrosemide.<br>

In Vitro Binding Assay 1<br>
^SJTBPS binding assay. The cortex from male Sprague-Dawley rats (weighing 160-<br>
200g) was removed immediately after decapitation and dissected over ice. A Pa<br>
homogenate was prepared for binding assay as previously described (Gee KW<br>
Phenylquinolines PK 8165 and PK 9084 allosterically modulate [35S]tbutylbicyclophosphorothionate<br>
binding to a chloride ionophore in rat brain via a novel<br>
Ro5 4864 site. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 240:747-753, 1987). The tissue was<br>
homogenized in 0.32M sucrose (J. T. Baker Chemical Co., Phillipsburg, NJ, USA) with<br>
a Teflon-coated pestle, followed by centrifugation at l.OOOX g for 10 min. The<br>
supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 9.000X g for 20 min. The resultant Pa pellet<br>
was resuspended in ice-cold 50mM sodium potassium phosphate (J.T. Baker) buffer (pH<br>
7.4) containing 200mM NaCl (J.T. Baker) and used immediately in binding assays. A<br>
2nM concentration of [35S]TBPS (86 Ci/mmol; New England Nuclear, Boston, MA,<br>
USA) was incubated with 100 jal of tissue homogenate (10% w/v) in the presence or<br>
absence of 5 ^M GABA (Sigma Chem. Co., St. Louis, MO) and 5 (J.1 aliquots of test drug<br>
dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma Chem. Co.) (
assays). At the concentration (
[35S]TBPS binding. All assays were brought to a final volume of 1 ml with 50 mM<br>
sodium potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 200 mM NaCl. Non-specific<br>
binding was defined as binding in the presence of 2p.M TBPS (NEN, Boston, MA) and<br>
accounted for ~30% of the total binding. Assays were terminated after a 90-min steadystate<br>
incubation at 25°C by rapid filtration through glass fiber filters (no. 32; Schleicher<br>
&amp; Schuell, Keene, N.H.). The dissociation kinetics of [35S]TBPS binding were<br>
measured by initiating dissociation by the addition of a saturating concentration of a<br>
known inhibitor of [35S]TBPS binding or a test compound to tissue homogenates preequilibrated<br>
with 2 nM [3SS]TBPS followed by filtration at various time points after the<br>
addition of the known inhibitor or test compound. Allosteric modulators of the known<br>
inhibitor or test compound will modify the rate of dissociation under these conditions<br>
whereas agents acting at common site will not affect the rate. Filter-bound radioactivity<br>
was quantified by liquid scintillation spectrophotometry. The data were evaluated by<br>
nonlinear regression (GraphPad, Inc., San Diego, CA) to obtain ICso (concentration at<br>
which half-maximal inhibition of radioligand occurs) values.<br>
In Vitro Binding Assay 2<br>
[3H]Flunitraiepam binding: assays were carried out under identical conditions, using an<br>
identical tissue preparation, as those used in the [35S]TBPS binding assays with the<br>
exception that 1 |iM GABA was added to all samples instead of 5 uM GABA.<br>
[;!H]Flunitrazepam, 0.2 nM (75 Ci/mmol, New England Nuclear, Boston, MA) was used<br>
to label BZ sites. Non-specific binding is defined as binding in the presence of 1 //M<br>
clonazepam. The data were evaluated by nonlinear regression to obtain ICso and ECjo<br>
values.<br>
In Vitro Binding Assay 3<br>
[3H]Muscimol binding assay: The cortex from male Sprague-Dawley rats (160-200g)<br>
was removed immediately after euthanizing and dissected over ice. The tissue was<br>
homogenized in 15 vol of 0.32M sucrose followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 1000<br>
X g. The supernatant was transferred to a 38 mL polycarbonate tube (Beckrnan<br>
Instruments, Palo Alto CA) and centrifuged at 20,000 X g for 20 min. The membrane<br>
pellet was resuspended in 10 vol of dHjO and centrifuged at 8,000 X g for 20 min. The<br>
resulting pellet was washed with dHbO once and with Na+-free assay buffer (40mM<br>
KH2PC&gt;4, lOOmM KC1, pH 7.4). The pellet was resuspended in 35 mL of Na+-free assay<br>
buffer, incubated at 37°C for thirty minutes and then centrifuged 31,000 X g for twenty<br>
minutes. The final pellet was resuspended in 10 vol of Na+-free assay buffer. Protein<br>
concentration of membrane preparations was ~1 mg/mL by BCA reagent protein assay.<br>
Aliquots of membrane suspension (100 /^L) were incubated in Na+-free assay buffer with<br>
5 nM [3H]muscimol (25 Ci/mmol, New England Nuclear, Boston, MA) and 5 /jL of<br>
dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) or drug dissolved in DMSO. The final volume of the<br>
incubation medium was 1 mL. Non-specific binding was defined as binding in the<br>
presence of 1 mM GABA. After addition of membranes, tubes were briefly vortexed<br>
and incubated at 4°C in the dark. The incubation was terminated after 60 min by rapid<br>
filtration through glass fiber filters followed by three washes with ice-cold assay buffer.<br>
Filter-bound radioactivity was quantified by LSC after an overnight extraction. The data<br>
were evaluated by nonlinear regression to obtain ICso and ECso values.<br>
Electrophysiological Assay 1.<br>
Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats, incubating embryos of 17-19 days gestation, were<br>
killed by cervical dislocation. The embryos were removed under aseptic conditions and<br>
the brains quickly excised and placed in Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS, Gibco) at<br>
ambient room temperature (18-22°C). The hippocampi were dissected out and chopped<br>
into fragments (~ 2mm3) and transferred into an enzyme solution containing (in mM):<br>
NaCl 116, KC1 5.4,NaHC0326,NaH2P04 1, CaCl2 1.5, MgSO4 1, EDTA 0.5, glucose<br>
25, cysteine 1, and papain 20 U/ml (Sigma) and incubated at 37°C, 5% CCh, 100%<br>
relative humidity for 1 hr. Tissue fragments were washed in HBSS containing 1 mg/ml<br>
of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 1 mg/ml of ovomucoid (both Sigma). Tissue was<br>
transferred into a farther 3-4 ml of this solution and gently triturated into a single cell<br>
suspension using a fire-polished Pasteur pipette. The single cell suspension was layered<br>
on to 5 ml HBSS containing 10 mg/ml of BSA and 10 mg/ml of ovomucoid and<br>
centrifuged at 100 X g for 10 min. The supernatent was discarded and the cells<br>
resuspended in 3-4 ml of glutamine-free minimal essential media (MEM, Gibco)<br>
supplemented with heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (5% v/v Gibco), heat-inactivated<br>
horse serum (5% v/v Gibco), streptomycin and penicillin (50 fig/ml and 5000 i.u./ml,<br>
respectively), glutamine and glucose (final concentrations 2mM and 20mM [Gibco and<br>
BDH] respectively). Approximately 1-2 x 105 cells were plated out on to each 35 mm<br>
(Falcon "Primaria") tissue culture dish which contained ~ 1 ml of the sera-enriched<br>
MEM. The plates were maintained at 37°C, in 5% COi, and 100% relative humidity<br>
until used in electrophysiological studies. Background proliferation of non-neuronal<br>
elements was suppressed with cytosine arabinoside (10 jiM, Sigma) for 48 hr 7 days after<br>
initial dissociation.<br>
Agonist evoked membrane currents were recorded from hippocampal neurons<br>
using the whole cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique. Neurons were voltaged<br>
clamped at -60 mV using a List electronics L/M EPC-7 converter head stage and<br>
amplifier. Cells were perfused with an external (bath) recording solution containing (in<br>
mM): NaCl 140, KC1 2.8, MgCh 2, CaCh 1 and HEPES-NaOH 10 (pH 7.2).<br>
Tetrodotoxin (TTX, 0.3 uM) was included in the recording solution to suppress synaptic<br>
activity. The external solution was delivered (at ~2 ml/min) by a Watson-Marlow flow<br>
pump via non-sterile tubing, which was connected to a plastic cannula (tip dia 1 mm).<br>
The input cannula was mounted on a Prior® micromanipulator and was positioned in<br>
close (
dish via a 19G needle connected by flexible tubing to an aquarium suction pump. The<br>
recording electrode was filled with an internal solution composed of (in mM): CsCl or<br>
KC1 140, MgCl2 2, CaCl2 0.1, EGTA 1.1 (free Ca2+ ~ 10"8 M), HEPES-NaOH 10, and<br>
ATP-Mg2+ 2. The recording electrodes were fabricated from glass hematocrit tubes<br>
(Kimble sodalime tubes 73811) on a Narishige PB7 two stage electrode puller.<br>
Electrodes were coated within 100 p.m of the tip with "Sylgard" (Dow Coming) and fire<br>
polished just before use. Agonists were applied locally to the soma of a voltage-clamped<br>
neuron by pressure ejection (1.4 Kpa, 10-80 msec, 0.1-0.033 Hz) from the tip of a<br>
modified recording pipette using a Picospritzer II device (General Valve Corporation).<br>
The agonist-containing pipette was positioned within 0.1 mm of the cell using a Leitz<br>
micromanipulator. The microscope and micromanipulators were all mounted on a<br>
vibration-free isolation air table (Wentworth) placed inside a Faraday cage. Agonistevoked<br>
whole cell currents were monitored on a storage oscilloscope (Tektronix 2212),<br>
recorded, after digital pulse code modulation (frequency response 14 kHz, Sony PCM<br>
701), and displayed on Multitrace (Electromed) pen chart recorder (frequency response<br>
0.5 kHz). All drugs, other than the agonists, were applied to cells via the superfusion<br>
system. Agonist-evoked whole cell currents were measured at their peak. Responses in<br>
the presence of drugs expressed as the arithmetic mean ± SEM of responses in the<br>
absence (control) or drugs.<br>

GABAA subunit transfected HEK cells are grown to -70% confluency on slide.<br>
Cells are transferred to a bath that is continuously perfused with extracellular saline. The<br>
extracellular medium contained 145 mM NaCI, 3 mM KC1, 1.5 mM CaCh, 1 mM<br>
MgCl2) 5.5 mM d-glucose, and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4 at an osmolarity of 320-330<br>
mosM- Recordings are performed at room temperature using the whole cell patch clamp<br>
technique. The patch pipette solution contained 147 mM W-methyl-D-glucamine<br>
hydrochloride, 5 mM CsCl, 5 mM K2ATP, 5 mM HEPES, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM CaCl2,<br>
and 1.1 mM EGTA, pH 7.2, at an osmolarity of 315 mosM. Pipette-to-bath resistance is<br>
typically 3-5 Mohms. Cells are voltage clamped at -60 mV, and the chloride<br>
equilibrium potential was approximately 0 mV. Drugs are dissolved in extracellular<br>
medium and rapidly applied to the cell by local perfusion. A motor driven multi-channel<br>
switching system exchanged solutions in approximately 20 ms.<br>
In vivo Pharmacology<br>
Vogel conflict<br>
Adult male rats are randomly divided into groups of 6 rats/group. Animals were<br>
deprived of water overnight (24 hr). Food was freely available at time of thirsting.<br>
Thirty minutes after injection (i.p.) of test drug, positive control drug (diazepam,<br>
Img/kg), or vehicle control rats are placed in a square Plexiglas box containing a<br>
stainless steel bottom connected to one side of a drinkometer circuit. At the other side of<br>
the drinkometer circuit a water bottle, placed so the drink tube extends into the Plexiglas<br>
box, is connected. When a subject drinks from the bottle the circuit is closed and an<br>
electric shock is delivered at the tube after seven licks are recorded. The number of licks<br>
in a 3 min session is recorded. Anti-anxiety agents will increase the number of shocks<br>
the animal is willing to endure to acquire water.<br>
Light-dark transition<br>
Male NSA mice (25-30g) are used. The apparatus consists of an open-topped<br>
box divided into small and large area by a partition that has a hole at floor level. The<br>
small compartment is painted black and the large compartment white. The white<br>
compartment was illuminated with light and the black compartment with red light. The<br>
time spent in the light versus dark compartments and the number of transitions between<br>
compartments is recorded during a 5 min test session. Vehicle or test compounds are<br>
administered 30 min prior to the test. Diazepam is administered (i.p.) at 2 mg/kg as the<br>
positive control. Anti-anxiety agents will reduce the time the animals will spend in the<br>
dark compartment and increase the number of transitions between the two compartments.<br>
Carriers<br>
In addition to administering the compound as a raw chemical, the compounds of<br>
the invention may be administered as part of a pharmaceutical preparation containing<br>
suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers comprising excipients and auxiliaries,<br>
which facilitate processing of the compounds into preparations, which can be used<br>
pharmaceutically. Preferably, the preparations, particularly those preparations which can<br>
be administered orally and which can be used for the preferred type of administration,<br>
such as tablets, dragees, and capsules, and also preparations which can be administered<br>
rectally, such as suppositories, as well as suitable solutions for administration by<br>
injection or orally, contain from about 0.01 to 99 percent, preferably from about 0.25 to<br>
75 percent of active compound(s), together with the excipient.<br>
Suitable excipients are, in particular, fillers such as saccharides, for example<br>
lactose or sucrose, mannitol or sorbitol, cellulose preparations and/or calcium<br>
phosphates, for example tricalcium phosphate or calcium hydrogen phosphate, as well as<br>
binders such as starch paste, using, for example, maize starch, wheat starch, rice starch,<br>
potato starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose,<br>
sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and/or polyvinyl pyrrolidone. If desired, disintegrating<br>
agents may be added such as the above-mentioned starches and also carboxymethylstarch,<br>
cross-linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, agar, or alginic acid or a salt thereof, such as<br>
sodium alginate. Auxiliaries are, above all, flow-regulating agents and lubricants, for<br>
example, silica, talc, stearic acid or salts thereof, such as magnesium stearate or calcium<br>
stearate, and/or polyethylene glycol. Dragee cores are provided with suitable coatings<br>
that, if desired, are resistant to gastric juices. For .this purpose, concentrated saccharide<br>
solutions may be used, which may optionally contain gum arabic, talc, polyvinyl<br>
pyrrolidone, polyethylene glycol and/or titanium dioxide, lacquer solutions and suitable<br>
organic solvents or solvent mixtures. In order to produce coatings resistant to gastric<br>
juices, solutions of suitable cellulose preparations such as acetylcellulose phthalate or<br>
hydroxypropymethyl-cellulose phthalate, are used. Dye stuffs or pigments may be added<br>
to the tablets or dragee coatings, for example, for identification or in order to characterize<br>
combinations of active compound doses.<br>
Other pharmaceutical preparations, which can be used orally, include push-fit<br>
capsules made of gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a<br>
plasticizer such as glycerol or sorbitol. The push-fit capsules can contain the active<br>
compounds in the form of granules, which may be mixed with fillers such as lactose,<br>
binders such as starches, and/or lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate and,<br>
optionally, stabilizers. In soft capsules, the active compounds are preferably dissolved or<br>
suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, or liquid paraffin. In addition, stabilizers<br>
may be added.<br>
Possible pharmaceutical preparations, which can be used rectally, include, for<br>
example, suppositories, which consist of a combination of one or more of the active<br>
compounds with a suppository base. Suitable suppository bases are, for example, natural<br>
or synthetic triglycerides, or paraffin hydrocarbons. In addition, it is also possible to use<br>
gelatin rectal capsules, which consist of a combination of the active compounds with a<br>
base. Possible base materials include, for example, liquid triglycerides, polyethylene<br>
glycols, or paraffin hydrocarbons.<br>
Suitable formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions of<br>
the active compounds in water-soluble form, for example, water-soluble salts and<br>
alkaline solutions. In addition, suspensions of the active compounds as appropriate oily<br>
injection suspensions may be administered. Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles<br>
include fatty oils, for example, sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid esters, for example,<br>
ethyl oleate or triglycerides or polyethylene glycol-400 (the compounds are soluble in<br>
PEG-400). Aqueous injection suspensions may contain substances, which increase the<br>
viscosity of the suspension, and include, for example, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose,<br>
sorbitol, and/or dextran. Optionally, the suspension may also contain stabilizers.<br>
