This application claims priority from Japanese Patent<br>
Application No. 2007-015572 filed on January 25, 2007.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a technology for<br>
supporting an engine unit by a body frame in a unit swing system<br>
straddle-type vehicle.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
According to a unit swing system straddle-type vehicle<br>
(such as a motor scooter) , an axle of a rear wheel is supported<br>
by the rear end of an engine unit which contains a transmission<br>
and an engine, and the engine unit is so constructed as to swing<br>
with the rear wheel with the fulcrum located at a pivot shaft<br>
suspended by the body frame (for example, see JP-A-2003-312578 ) .<br>
According to a straddle-type vehicle disclosed in<br>
JP-A-2003-312578, the area around the intermediate portion of<br>
the engine unit in the front-rear direction is attached to the<br>
pivot shaft such that the area around the intermediate portion<br>
of the engine unit can be supported by the body frame. In this<br>
structure, the portion of the engine unit near the center of<br>
gravity is supported by the body frame, and thus stable support<br>
of the engine unit can be achieved.<br>
1<br><br>
According to the straddle-type vehicle disclosed in<br>
JP-A-2003-312578, the pivot shaft as the fulcrum for the swing<br>
of the engine unit is attached to the intermediate portion of<br>
the engine unit. Thus, the distance between the fulcrum and<br>
the axle of the rear wheel during the swing is short. In this<br>
case, the rotation angle of the engine unit around the fulcrum<br>
becomes large, and the wheelbase (distance between axles of<br>
front wheel and rear wheel) easily varies. Accordingly, the<br>
wheelbase changes according to the weight of the rider or the<br>
road condition, for example, and thus preferable running<br>
stability cannot be obtained in some cases.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention has been developed to solve these problems.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a straddle-type<br>
vehicle capable of obtaining preferable running stability by<br>
reducing fluctuation in wheelbase.<br>
In order to achieve the above object, a straddle-type<br>
vehicle according to the invention includes: a body frame; a<br>
pivot shaft supported by the body frame; a rear wheel disposed<br>
in a rear part of a vehicle body; and an engine unit which<br>
contains an engine having a crank shaft and a transmission<br>
mechanism for transmitting rotational force of the crank shaft<br>
to the rear wheel, and is capable of swinging upward and<br>
downward with the rear wheel with a fulcrum located at the pivot<br>
2<br><br>
shaft. The crank shaft is disposed in a front part of the engine<br>
unit. The engine unit has a supported member disposed before<br>
the crank shaft and attached to the pivot shaft, and extends<br>
toward the rear from the supported member. An axle of the rear<br>
wheel is supported by the rear part of the engine unit.<br>
According to the straddle-type vehicle of the invention,<br>
the supported member attached to the pivot shaft is disposed<br>
before the crank shaft, the distance between the pivot shaft<br>
and the axle is larger than that in the structure where the<br>
central portion and its vicinity of the engine unit are attached<br>
to the pivot shaft. Thus, fluctuation in wheelbase can be<br>
reduced, and running stability can be enhanced. The<br>
straddle-type vehicle herein is a vehicle such as a motorcycle<br>
(including scooter), a four-wheel buggy, and a snow mobile.<br>
According to an example of the invention, the supported<br>
member is positioned at the front end of the engine unit. In<br>
this case, fluctuation in wheelbase can be further reduced,<br>
and running stability can be improved.<br>
In another example of the invention, the supported member<br>
attached to the pivot shaft is disposed at a level sufficient<br>
for swinging upward and downward from a horizontal surface<br>
containing the axle at the time of running of the vehicle. In<br>
this case, driving force generated by the rotation of the rear<br>
wheel can be transmitted from the supported member to the body<br>
frame via the pivot shaft more easily than in the structure<br>
3<br><br>
where the supported member is disposed considerably away from<br>
the axle of the rear wheel in the up-down direction.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention, the straddle-type<br>
vehicle of the invention further includes a shock absorbing<br>
unit which reduces vibration of the engine unit. In addition,<br>
the shock absorbing unit is disposed in such a position as to<br>
expand and contract in the circumferential direction of a<br>
circle defined around the pivot shaft. In this case, force<br>
in directions other than the expanding and contracting<br>
direction of the shock absorbing unit does not easily act on<br>
the shock absorbing unit. Thus, the durability of the shock<br>
absorbing unit can be increased.<br>

As illustrated in Fig. 3 or 4, the engine unit 20 has<br>
an engine 30, a transmission mechanism 40 for transmitting<br>
driving force outputted from the engine 30 to the rear wheel<br>
3, and a rear arm 21. The engine unit 20 further has a pair<br>
of left and right supported members 22, 22 to be attached to<br>
the pivot shaft 109, and a shock absorbing unit attachment<br>
member 23 to which the shock absorbing unit 50 is attached.<br>
As mentioned above, the motorcycle 1 is a unit swing type<br>
vehicle. Thus, the axle 4 of the rear wheel 3 is supported<br>
on the rear part of the engine unit 20 which can swing upward<br>
and downward with the rear wheel 3 with the fulcrum located<br>
at the pivot shaft 109.<br>
9<br><br>
As illustrated in Fig. 4, the engine 30 includes a<br>
cylinder block 30a containing a cylinder 31, a cylinder head<br>
30b covering the upper part of the cylinder block 30a, a crank<br>
mechanism 32, a balancer mechanism 36, and a crank case 30c.<br>
The crank mechanism 32 has a piston 33, a crank shaft 34, and<br>
a connecting rod 35 connecting the crank shaft 34 and the piston<br>
33.<br>
The cylinder block 30a and the cylinder head 30b are<br>
positioned such that the axial direction of the cylinder 31<br>
(direction indicated by an arrow C in Fig. 4) extends in the<br>
up-down direction of the vehicle body. As illustrated in Fig.<br>
1, the storage case 11 is disposed before the cylinder block<br>
30a and the cylinder head 30b. According to the example shown<br>
in Fig. 4, the cylinder 31 is slightly inclined toward the rear<br>
of the vehicle body. The crank case 30c is disposed before<br>
the engine unit 20, and accommodates the crank shaft 34<br>
extending in the vehicle width direction (see Fig. 3). The<br>
piston 33 reciprocates within the cylinder 31 by the combustion<br>
of fuel supplied from an injector (not shown). The crank<br>
mechanism 32 converts the reciprocating movement of the piston<br>
33 into rotational movement of the crank shaft 34.<br>
The transmission mechanism 40 reduces the rotation speed<br>
of the crank shaft and transmits the resultant rotation to the<br>
axle 4 of the rear wheel 3. In this embodiment, the<br>
transmission mechanism 40 includes a continuously variable<br>
10<br><br>
transmission 41, a driven shaft 45, and an intermediate shaft<br>
46, and these components are accommodated in a transmission<br>
case 47 disposed on the left side of the rear wheel 3. A front<br>
part 47a of the transmission case 47 is attached to the side<br>
of the crank case 30c (see Fig. 3), and the transmission case<br>
47 extends toward the rear of the vehicle body from the front<br>
part 47a.<br>
The continuously variable transmission 41 includes a<br>
driving pulley 42, a driven pulley 43, and a V-belt 44 wound<br>
around the driving pulley 42 and the driven pulley 43. The<br>
driving pulley 42 is accommodated in the front part 47a of the<br>
transmission case 47. The driving pulley 42 is attached to<br>
an end of the crank shaft 34 and rotates with the crank shaft<br>
34. The driven shaft 45 is disposed behind the transmission<br>
case 47 at a position away from the axle 4 of the rear wheel<br>
3. The driven pulley 43 engages with the driven shaft 45 in<br>
an idling condition for the driven shaft 45. The rotation force<br>
of the crank shaft 34 is transmitted to the driven pulley 43<br>
via the driving pulley 42 and the V-belt 44. The radii of the<br>
portion of the V-belt 44 wound around the driving pulley 42<br>
and the driven pulley 43 vary according to the revolutions of<br>
the crank shaft 34, thereby continuously varying the speed<br>
reduction ratio.<br>
The transmission mechanism 40 has a centrifugal clutch<br>
(not shown) coaxially with the driven shaft 45. The rotation<br>
11<br><br>
force transmitted to the driven pulley 43 is further<br>
transmitted to the driven shaft 45 via the centrifugal clutch<br>
under the condition connected with the driven shaft 45. A gear<br>
45a engages with the driven shaft 45 in such a manner as to<br>
interlock with the driven shaft 45. The rotation force<br>
transmitted to the drive shaft 45 is further transmitted to<br>
the intermediate shaft 46 via a large-diameter gear 46a<br>
provided to engage with the gear 45a and interlock with the<br>
intermediate shaft 46. The large-diameter gear 46a and a<br>
small-diameter gear 4 6b having a diameter smaller than that<br>
of the large-diameter gear 46a engage with the intermediate<br>
shaft 46. The rotation force transmitted to the intermediate<br>
shaft 46 is further transmitted to the axle 4 via the<br>
small-diameter gear 46b and a gear 4a engaging with the<br>
small-diameter gear 46b and interlocking with the axle 4.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 2, the rear arm 21 is a<br>
substantially triangular component disposed on the right side<br>
of the rear wheel 3, and the front part of the rear arm 21 is<br>
attached to the crank case 30c. The rear arm 21 extends toward<br>
the rear from its attachment position to the crank case 30c,<br>
and the axle 4 is supported by the rear end of the rear arm<br>
21.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 3 or 4, the supported members 22,<br>
22 are disposed at the front end of the engine unit 20 before<br>
the crankshaft 34. In this embodiment, the supported members<br>
12<br><br>
22, 22 are so constructed as to project toward the front from<br>
a front wall 30d of the crank case 30c (see Fig. 4) . The engine<br>
unit 20 extends from the supported members 22, 22 toward the<br>
rear, and the rear part of the transmission case 47 and the<br>
rear end of the rear arm 21 support the axle 4 of the rear wheel<br>
3 such that the axle 4 can rotate. Fig. 5 illustrates the pivot<br>
support members 108, 108 and the support plate members 118 as<br>
viewed from the rear. An insertion hole 22a extending in the<br>
vehicle width direction is formed on each of the supported<br>
members 22, and the pivot shaft 109 is inserted into the<br>
insertion holes 22a. By this structure, the supported members<br>
22 rotate relative to the pivot shaft 109 in accordance with<br>
the concaves and convexes of the road surface, allowing swing<br>
of the engine unit 20 with the fulcrum located at the pivot<br>
shaft 109.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 1, a virtual plane P containing<br>
the axle 4 and the pivot shaft 109 to which the supported members<br>
22 are attached is substantially parallel with the road surface.<br>
The height of the supported members 22 is determined such that<br>
the supported members 22 can swing upward and downward from<br>
a horizontal plane (plane in parallel with road surface)<br>
containing the axle 4 at the time of running of the vehicle.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 5, an insertion hole extending<br>
in the vehicle width direction is formed on each of the pivot<br>
support members 108, and the pivot shaft 109 is inserted into<br>
13<br><br>
these insertion holes. A cylindrical bushing 108a having an<br>
inside diameter corresponding to the outside diameter of the<br>
pivot shaft 109 is provided inside each of the insertion holes.<br>
The pivot shaft 109 is inserted into the interiors of the<br>
bushings 108a, and the pivot support members 108 support the<br>
pivot shaft 109 via the bushings 108a.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 4, the shock absorbing unit<br>
attachment member 23 is provided behind the shock absorbing<br>
unit attachment members 119 of the body frame 10 in such a manner<br>
as to project downward from a lower wall 30e of the crank case<br>
30c. The rear end of the shock absorbing unit 50 is attached<br>
to the shock absorbing unit attachment member 23.<br>
As discussed above, the engine 30 has the balancer<br>
mechanism 36. The balancer mechanism 36 is a mechanism for<br>
reducing vibrations of the engine unit 20 caused by the<br>
reciprocating movement of the piston 3.3. As illustrated in<br>
Fig. 4, the balancer mechanism 36 has a balancer shaft 37, a<br>
gear 37c rotating with the balancer shaft 37, and a balancer<br>
weight 37w rotating with the balancer shaft 37. The gear 37c<br>
engages with a gear (not shown) rotating with the crank shaft<br>
34, and the balancer shaft 37 rotates in the direction opposite<br>
to the rotation of the crank shaft 34 at a speed equivalent<br>
to the rotation speed of the crank shaft 34. In this embodiment,<br>
the position of the balancer shaft 37 and the position of the<br>
balancer weight 37w in the circumferential direction of the<br>
14<br><br>
balancer shaft 37 are determined such that the vibration of<br>
the engine unit 20 is not transmitted from the supported members<br>
22 to the pivot shaft 109 by reducing the vibration of the<br>
supported members 22. The details of the balancer mechanism<br>
36 will be described later.<br>
The shock absorbing unit 50 expands and contracts in<br>
accordance with the concaves and convexes of the road surface<br>
to reduce rapid swing of the engine unit 20 and the rear wheel<br>
3. As illustrated in Fig. 4, the shock absorbing unit 50<br>
extends between the shock absorbing unit attachment members<br>
119 of the body frame 10 and the shock absorbing unit attachment<br>
member 23 formed on the crank case 30c. The shock absorbing<br>
unit 50 has a dumper 52, an engine side attachment member 55,<br>
and a frame side attachment member 56. The dumper 52 has a<br>
case 53 and a rod 54.<br>
A cylinder 53a is provided inside the case 53, and oil<br>
or gas is sealed into the cylinder 53a. Apiston 53bis attached<br>
to the front end of the rod 54. The piston 53b is accommodated<br>
in the cylinder 53a. The rod 54 pulls or pushes the piston<br>
53b according to the swing of the engine unit 20. In this<br>
embodiment, a coil spring 51 is provided inside the cylinder<br>
53a. The coil spring 51 pushes the piston 53b so as to contract<br>
(shorten) the dumper 52.<br>
The engine side attachment member 55 extends toward the<br>
rear from the dumper 52. The rear end of the engine side<br>
15<br><br>
attachment member 55 is attached to the shock absorbing unit<br>
attachment member 2 3 of the engine unit 20 by a bolt 27 in such<br>
a manner as to be rotatable relative to the shock absorbing<br>
unit attachment member 23.<br>
The frame side attachment member 56 extends toward the<br>
front from the dumper 52, and the front end of the frame side<br>
attachment member 56 is attached to the shock absorbing unit<br>
attachment member 119 of the body frame 10 by a bolt 28.<br>
The shock absorbing unit 50 is provided below the pivot<br>
shaft 109 in a direction substantially parallel with the road<br>
surface. The frame side attachment member 56 is positioned<br>
before the pivot shaft 109, and the engine side attachment<br>
member 55 is positioned behind the pivot shaft 109. Thus, the<br>
expanding and contracting direction of the shock absorbing unit<br>
50 (direction indicated by an arrow S in Fig. 4) extends in<br>
the circumferential direction of a circle around the pivot<br>
shaft 109. That is, the direction S is substantially<br>
perpendicular to a line T passing the center of the pivot shaft<br>
109 and extending in its radial direction.<br>
The crank mechanism 32 and the balancer mechanism 36<br>
contained in the engine 30 are now explained. Figs. 6 and 7<br>
show the positional relationship between the crank mechanism<br>
32 and the balancer mechanism 36. As discussed above, the<br>
balancer mechanism 36 has the balancer shaft 37 and the balancer<br>
weight 37w. The crank mechanism 32 has the piston 33, the crank<br>
16<br><br>
shaft 34 and the connecting rod 35. The crank shaft 34 has<br>
a counter weight 34wl provided on the side opposite to a crank<br>
pin 34p with the crank shaft 34 interposed therebetween and<br>
rotatable with the crank shaft 34 . Also, a weight 34w2 disposed<br>
at a position different from the position of the counter weight<br>
34wl in the circumferential direction of the crank shaft 34<br>
and rotatable with the crank shaft 34. In Figs. 6 and 7, the<br>
counter weight 34wl and the weight 34w2 are black circular marks<br>
for simplifying the explanation. Similarly, the balancer<br>
weight 37w is a black circular mark in Fig. 7. In this<br>
embodiment, it is assumed that the counter weight 34wl, the<br>
weight 34w2, and the crank pin 34p are disposed at equal<br>
distances from an axial center Co of the crank shaft 34 (at<br>
a distance r in Fig. 6) for simplifying the explanation.<br>
In this embodiment, the position of the balancer shaft<br>
37, the. position of the balancer weight 37w in the<br>
circumferential direction of the balancer shaft 37, the<br>
position of the crank shaft 34, and the position of the weight<br>
34w2 in the circumferential direction of the crank shaft 34<br>
are determined such that vibration to be transmitted to the<br>
pivot shaft 109 via the supported members 22 can be reduced.<br>
Initially, the position of the weight 34w2 in the<br>
circumferential direction of the crank shaft 34 is explained.<br>
Centrifugal force generated by the rotations of the counter<br>
weight 34wl, the weight 34w2, the crank pin 34p, and the<br>
17<br><br>
large-end side of the connecting rod 35 (crank shaft 34 side)<br>
around the axial center Co of the crank shaft 34 acts on the<br>
crank mechanism 32. The centrifugal force produced by<br>
combining the centrifugal forces generated by these components<br>
is indicated by f1 in Fig. 6. The direction of the centrifugal<br>
force f 1 rotates in accordance with the phase of the crank shaft<br>
34. In Fig. 6, the locus produced by the vector of the<br>
centrifugal force f1 is indicated by a circle S1. Also, inertia<br>
force generated by the reciprocating movements of the piston<br>
33 and the small-end side (piston 33 side) of the connecting<br>
rod 35 within the cylinder 31 acts on the crank mechanism 32<br>
in an axial direction Y of the cylinder 31. A primary inertia<br>
force f2 of this inertia force varies in accordance with the<br>
phase of the crank shaft 34. Thus, a resultant force<br>
(hereinafter referred to as inertia force Fl) of the primary<br>
inertia force f2 and the centrifugal force f1 acts on the crank<br>
mechanism 32. The direction of the inertia force Fl rotates<br>
with the rotation of the crank shaft 34. In Fig. 6, the locus<br>
produced by the vector of the inertia force Fl is indicated<br>
by an ellipse S2.<br>
According to this embodiment, the mass of the counter<br>
weight 34wl is equivalent to the mass of the rotating portions<br>
such as the crank pin 34p and the large-end side of the<br>
connecting rod 35. In this case, the direction of the major<br>
axis of the ellipse S2 (direction indicated by an arrow X in<br>
18<br><br>
Fig. 6) is determined according to a ratio k of a mass Mp of<br>
the reciprocating portion such as the piston 33 and the<br>
small-end of the connecting rod 35 to a mass Mc of the weight<br>
34w2 (hereinafter referred to as mass ratio (k=Mc/Mp) and the<br>
position of the weight 34w2 in the circumferential direction<br>
of the crank shaft 34. That is, assuming that an angle formed<br>
by the axial direction Y of the cylinder 31 and the direction<br>
X is χ and that an angle formed by the position of the weight<br>
34w2 and the position of the crank pin 34p is Φ, the angle χ<br>
is expressed by the following eguation as shown in Kikai Sekkei,<br>
volume 8, No. 9, pp. 43-44, published by Nikkan Kogyo Shinbun:<br>
χ={tan-1 (2kxsinΦ) / (1 + 2kxcosΦ) /2 ... (1)<br>
In this embodiment, the mass Mc of the weight 34w2 and the<br>
position of the weight 34w2 (angle Φ in Fig. 6) are determined<br>
such that the direction X of the major axis of the ellipse S2<br>
extends in parallel with a straight line LI connecting a center<br>
of gravity G of the engine unit 20 and an axial center Po of<br>
the pivot shaft 109. While the weight 34w2 and the counter<br>
weight 34wl for controlling the direction of the ellipse S2<br>
are separate components in this embodiment, these components<br>
may be formed integrally with each other.<br>
The details of the balancer mechanism 36 are now<br>
described. As illustrated in Fig. 7, the balancer shaft 37<br>
is positioned such that a line L2 connecting an axial center<br>
Bo of the balancer shaft 37 and the axial center Co of the crank<br>
19<br><br>
shaft 34 extends in parallel with the line LI discussed above.<br>
As mentioned above, the balancer weight 37w rotating with the<br>
balancer shaft 37 is provided on the balancer shaft 37. Thus,<br>
centrifugal force F2 generated by the rotations of the balancer<br>
shaft 37 and the balancer weight 37w acts on the balancer<br>
mechanism 36. In Fig. 7, the locus produced by the vector of<br>
the centrifugal force F2 is indicated by a circle S3. The<br>
balancer weight 37w is provided in such a manner as to rotate<br>
around the axial center Bo of the balancer shaft 37 in the same<br>
direction as that of the inertia force Fl. The position of<br>
the balancer weight 37w in the circumferential direction of<br>
the balancer shaft 37 is determined such that the direction<br>
of the centrifugal force F2 is the direction opposite to the<br>
direction of the inertia force Fl corresponding to the<br>
direction of the major axis and the minor axis of the ellipse<br>
S2 discussed above.<br>
The positional relationship between the crank shaft 34<br>
and the balancer shaft 37, and the mass of the balancer weight<br>
37w are now explained.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 7, the balancer shaft 37 is<br>
disposed away from the crank shaft 34. Thus, moment of the<br>
centrifugal force F2 and the inertia force Fl act on the engine<br>
unit 20. The engine unit 20 vibrates by this moment, and<br>
acceleration is given to the pivot shaft 109. Also,<br>
acceleration generated by the resultant force of the<br>
20<br><br>
centrifugal force F2 and the inertia force F1 is given to the<br>
pivot shaft 109.<br>
According to this example shown herein, the mass of the<br>
balancer weight 37w and the positional relationship between<br>
the balancer shaft 37 and the crank shaft 34 are determined<br>
such that the acceleration generated by the resultant force<br>
can be reduced by the acceleration generated by the moment of<br>
the centrifugal force F2 and the inertia force F1. More<br>
specifically, the mass of the balancer weight 37w is<br>
established such that the centrifugal force F2 of the balancer<br>
mechanism 36 becomes equivalent to the maximum of the inertia<br>
force Fl of the crank mechanism 32. Thus, the radius of the<br>
circle S3 is equivalent to the major axis of the ellipse S2<br>
in Fig. 7.<br>
The positional relationship between the crank shaft 34<br>
and the balancer shaft 37 is specifically determined, in the<br>
following manner. As illustrated in Fig. 7, it is assumed that<br>
a distance from the line L1 connecting the center of gravity<br>
G of the engine unit 20 and an axial center Po of the pivot<br>
shaft 109 to the line L2 connecting the axial center Co of the<br>
crank shaft 34 and the axial center Bo of the balancer shaft<br>
37 is L. It is also assumed that a distance from the center<br>
of gravity G of the engine unit 20 to the axial center Po of<br>
the pivot shaft 109 is Lp. It is further assumed that a distance<br>
from a line L3 passing through the center of gravity G and<br>
21<br><br>
extending in parallel with a direction VD (direction<br>
perpendicular to the lines L1 and L2) to the axial center Bo<br>
of the balancer shaft 34 . It is further assumed that a distance<br>
from the line L3 to the axial center Co of the crank shaft 34<br>
is Lc. In this case, the positions of the crank shaft 34 and<br>
the balancer shaft 37 are determined such that the respective<br>
distances discussed above satisfy the following equation (2) :<br>
Ax{MxLp(Lb+Lc)+21}=MxLpxLc+I .... (2)<br>
In the equation (2), M is the mass of the engine unit 20, and<br>
I is the moment of inertia of the engine unit 20 with respect<br>
to a line passing the center of gravity G and extending in<br>
parallel with the vehicle width direction. The value A is a<br>
ratio of the major axis to the minor axis of the ellipse S2<br>
produced by the vector of the inertia force F1 of the crank<br>
mechanism 32 (major axis: minor axis = A:(1-A)). The value<br>
A is expressed by the following equation (3) using, the angle<br>
χ formed by the major axis direction X of the ellipse S2<br>
discussed above and the axial direction S of the cylinder 31,<br>
the angle Φ formed by the weight 34w2 and the crank pin 34p,<br>
and the mass ratio k, as shown in Kikai Sekkei, volume 8, No.<br>
9, pp. 43-44, published by Nikkan Kogyo Shinbun, for example.<br>
A=kxsin (Φ-χ)/sinχ ... (3)<br>
The details of the equation (2) are now explained.<br>
Initially, a component F2v in a direction VD and a<br>
component F2p in a direction PD (direction in parallel with<br>
22<br><br>
line L2) contained in the centrifugal force F2 of the balancer<br>
mechanism 36, and a component F1v in the direction VD and a<br>
component F1p in the direction PD contained in the inertia force<br>
F1 of the crank mechanism 32 are calculated.<br>
When the maximum of the primary inertial force acting<br>
on the reciprocating portion (mass m) in the crank mechanism<br>
32 such as the piston 33 is F (F=mrω2, r=distance from axial<br>
center Co of crank shaft 34 to crank pin 34p, ω=angular speed<br>
of crank shaft 34) , the radius of the major axis of the ellipse<br>
S2 (maximum of inertia force Fl of crank mechanism 32) is AxF<br>
as shown in Kikai Sekkei, volume 8, No. 9, pp. 43-44, published<br>
byNikkan Kogyo Shinbun, for example. In this case, the radius<br>
of the minor axis (minimum of inertia force Fl) is (l-A)xF.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 7, when the angle of the inertia force<br>
Fl of the crank mechanism 32 to the line L2 is θ, the angle<br>
of the centrifugal force F2 of the balancer mechanism 36 is<br>
π+θ. Thus, the component Flv in the direction VD contained<br>
in the inertia force Fl of the crank shaft 34 is (1-A)xFsinθ.<br>
The component Flp in the direction PD contained in the inertia<br>
force F1 of the crank shaft 34 is AxFcosθ. The mass of the<br>
balancer weight 37w is established such that the centrifugal<br>
force F2 of the balancer mechanism 36 is equivalent to the<br>
maximum of the inertia force Fl of the crank mechanism 32 . Thus,<br>
the component F2v in the direction VD contained in the<br>
centrifugal force F2 of the balancer mechanism 36 is<br>
23<br><br>
AxFsin (π+θ) , and the component F2p in the direction PD is<br>
AxFcos (π+θ) .<br>
Then, a component in the direction VD (a1 in Fig. 7)<br>
contained in the acceleration of the pivot shaft 109 generated<br>
by the moment of the centrifugal force F2 and the inertia force<br>
F1 is calculated. A moment N of the inertia force Fl and the<br>
centrifugal force F2 around the center of gravity G is expressed<br>
by the following eguation (4):<br>
N=F1pxL+F2pxL+F1vxLc+F2vxLb<br>
=AxFcosθxL+AxFcos (π+θ) xL+ (1-A) xFsinθxLc+AxFsin (π+θ)xLb ....<br>
(4)<br>
Since cos (π+Θ) =-COSΘ and sin (π+θ) =-sinθ, the equation<br>
(4) can be expressed by the following equation (5):<br>
N=(1-A)xFsinθxLc-AxFsinθxLb .... (5)<br>
When the angular acceleration generated by the moment<br>
N around the center of gravity G is β and the acceleration at<br>
the axial center Po in the direction VD generated by the moment<br>
N is a1, the acceleration al in the direction VD and the angular<br>
acceleration β are expressed by the following equations (6)<br>
and (7) :<br>
a1=Lpxβ .... (6)<br>
β=N/I .... (7)<br>
where I is the moment of inertia of the engine unit 20 with<br>
respect to the line passing through the center of gravity G<br>
and extending in parallel with the vehicle width direction as<br>
24<br><br>
discussed above.<br>
Based on the equation (5), the equation (7) can be<br>
expressed by the following equation (8):<br>
β={(1-A)xFsinθxLc-AxFsinθxLb}/I .. (8)<br>
Based on the equations (6) and (8), the acceleration a1 can<br>
be expressed by the following equation (9):<br>
al=Lpx{(1-A)xFsinθxLc-AxFsinθxLb}/I ... (9)<br>
An acceleration a2 at the axial center Po in the direction<br>
VD generated by the resultant force of the inertia force Fl<br>
and the centrifugal force F2 is expressed by the following<br>
equation (10):<br>
a2=(F1v+F2v)/M<br>
= { (1-A)xFsinθ+AxFsin(π+θ) }/M<br>
={(l-A)xFsinθ-AxFsinθ}/M<br>
=(l-2A)xFsinθ/M .... (10)<br>
where M is the mass of the engine unit 20 as discussed above.<br>
When the acceleration al at the axial center Po in the<br>
direction VD generated by the moment N and the acceleration<br>
a2 at the axial center Po in the direction VD generated by the<br>
resultant force of the inertia force Fl and the centrifugal<br>
force F2 cancel each other, that is, when al+a2=0, the axial<br>
center Po of the pivot shaft 109 becomes a momentary rotation<br>
center of the engine unit 20, thereby reducing the vibration<br>
of the pivot shaft 109 in the direction VD. The sum of the<br>
acceleration al and the acceleration a2 is expressed by the<br>
25<br><br>
following equation based on the equations (9) and (10):<br>
a1+a2=Lpx{(1-A)xFsinθxLc-AxFsinθxLb}/I+(1-2A)xFsinθ/M=O<br>
This equation can be arranged in the following manner:<br>
Fsinθ[Lpx{(1-A)xLc-AxLb}/I+(l-2A)/M]=0<br>
Since F≠0, the following equation can be obtained:<br>
sinθ[Lpx{(1-A)xLc-AxLb}/I+(1-2A)/M]=0<br>
In this case, the following (11) holds when sinG^O (0^0, in<br>
case of n) :<br>
Lpx{(1-A)xLc-AxLb}/I+(1-2A)/M=0 .. (11)<br>
By arranging the equation (11), the relationship between the<br>
ratio A of the major axis to the minor axis of the ellipse S2<br>
produced by the vector of the inertia force F1 acting on the<br>
crank mechanism 32 and the distances Lp, Lc and Lb can be<br>
expressed by the following equation equivalent to the equation<br>
(2) shown above:<br>
Ax{MxLp(Lb+Lc)+2I}=MxLpxLc+I<br>
When sinθ=0 (θ=0, in case of π) , each of the accelerators<br>
a1 and a2 is zero based on the equations (9) and (10). Thus,<br>
the equation a1+a2=0 is satisfied. This is the explanation<br>
of the equation (2) which determines the positional<br>
relationship between the crank shaft 34, the balancer shaft<br>
37, and the center of gravity G.<br>
The acceleration at the axial center Po in the direction<br>
PD is zero. That is, since the lines L1 and L2 are parallel<br>
with each other, an acceleration a3 at the axial center Po in<br>
26<br><br>
the direction PD generated by the moment N is zero.<br>
An acceleration a4 at the axial center Po in the direction<br>
PD generated by the resultant force of the inertia force Fl<br>
and the centrifugal force F2 can be expressed by the following<br>
equation (13):<br>
a4=(F1p+F2p)/M<br>
= {AxFcosθ+AxFcos (π+θ) }/M<br>
={AxFcosθ-AxFcosθ}/M<br>
=0 .... (13)<br>
As a result, the equation a3+a4=0 is satisfied. Since<br>
the acceleration at the axial center Po generated in the<br>
direction PD is zero, the vibration at the axial center Po of<br>
the pivot shaft 109 in the direction PD is reduced.<br>
According to the motorcycle 1 described above, the<br>
supported members 22 supported by the pivot shaft 109 project<br>
toward the front from the front wall 30d of the crank case 30c<br>
and is disposed at the front end portion of the engine unit<br>
20. In this case, the distance from the pivot shaft 109 to<br>
the axle 4 of the rear wheel 3 increases. Thus, fluctuation<br>
in the wheelbase is reduced, and the running stability of the<br>
motorcycle is enhanced.<br>
According to a typical unit swing type motorcycle, an<br>
engine unit is supported by a body frame via a<br>
vibration-preventing suspension member which prevents<br>
transmission of vibration generated by the engine unit to the<br>
27<br><br>
body frame. In this structure, the suspension member needs<br>
to be extended toward the rear when the engine unit is disposed<br>
at a backward position with respect to the body frame to<br>
increase the wheelbase without changing the size of the body<br>
frame or the like, and this structure is complicated.<br>
According to the motorcycle 1 described above, however, the<br>
supported members 22 of the engine unit 20 are attached to the<br>
pivot shaft 109 without interposing such a suspension member<br>
therebetween. Thus, the position of the engine unit 20 with<br>
respect to the body frame 10 can be easily controlled and the<br>
wheelbase can be appropriately determined by increasing the<br>
projection of the supported members 22 toward the front, for<br>
example. When the engine unit is supported by the body frame<br>
via the vibration-preventing suspension member, the engine<br>
unit does not necessarily move with the body frame as one body.<br>
In this case,- the rider feels that acceleration of the vehicle<br>
starts with delay from the increase in the rotation speed of<br>
the rear wheel, and thus cannot sometimes obtain preferable<br>
operation feeling. According to the motorcycle 1, however,<br>
the engine unit 20 is attached to the pivot shaft 109 without<br>
interposing the suspension member therebetween. Thus, the<br>
rider can feel the start of acceleration of the vehicle without<br>
delay from the increase in the rotation speed of the rear wheel<br>
3, which improves operation feeling of the rider.<br>
Moreover, the cylinder block 30a and the cylinder head<br>
28<br><br>
30b are positioned such that the axial direction of the cylinder<br>
31 extends in the up-down direction, and the shock absorbing<br>
unit 50 is disposed below the engine unit 20. This structure<br>
allows effective use of the space below the seat 9. For example,<br>
the storage case 11 can be provided below the seat 9 as discussed<br>
above. Furthermore, the engine 30 has the balancer mechanism<br>
36. Thus, vibration generated by reciprocating movement of<br>
the piston 33 within the cylinder 31 in the up-down direction<br>
is not transmitted to the body frame 10 via the supported<br>
members 22 and the pivot shaft 109.<br>
The invention is not limited to the example of the<br>
motorcycle 1 described above, but may be practiced otherwise<br>
with various modifications . For example, while the motorcycle<br>
1 has the engine 30 driven by combustion of fuel as a power<br>
source of the vehicle. However, the power source is not limited<br>
to such an engine and may be a hybrid engine which combines<br>
an electric motor driven by supply of electric power and an<br>
engine.<br>
While the cylinder block 30a and the cylinder head 30b<br>
are disposed such that the axial direction of the cylinder 31<br>
extends in the up-down direction in the motorcycle 1 described<br>
above, the cylinder block and the cylinder head may be<br>
positioned such that the axial direction of the cylinder<br>
extends in the front-rear direction of the vehicle body. Fig.<br>
8 is a side view illustrating a body frame 10A and an engine<br>
29<br><br>
unit 20A included in a motorcycle 1A in this example. In this<br>
figure, the same reference numbers are given to the same parts<br>
included in the motorcycle 1, and explanation of those is not<br>
repeated.<br>
As illustrated in the figure, the motorcycle 1A includes<br>
a shock absorbing unit 50A as well as the engine unit 20A. The<br>
engine unit 20A has an engine 30A, a transmission mechanism<br>
40A, and a rear arm 21A. The engine 30A has a cylinder block<br>
300a, a cylinder head 300b, and a crank case 300c. The cylinder<br>
block 300a contains the cylinder 31. The cylinder block 300a<br>
is inclined toward the front such that the axial direction of<br>
the cylinder 31 extends substantially in the front-rear<br>
direction of the vehicle. The cylinder 31 contains the piston<br>
33.<br>
The crank case 300c is disposed behind the cylinder block<br>
300a. The crank case 300c has supported members 22A projecting<br>
toward the front from the lower wall of the crank case 300c.<br>
Each end of the supported members 22A is positioned below the<br>
cylinder block 300a, and attached to the pivot shaft 109<br>
supported by the pivot support member 108.<br>
The crank case 300c contains the crank shaft 34 extending<br>
in the vehicle width direction. Similarly to the above example,<br>
the supported members 22A are disposed before the crank shaft<br>
34 in the motorcycle 1A.<br>
A shock absorbing member 23A is provided at the upper<br>
30<br><br>
end of the front part of the rear arm 21A. An engine side<br>
attachment member 55A provided on the shock absorbing unit 50A<br>
is attached to the shock absorbing attachment member 23A such<br>
that the engine side attachment member 55A can rotate relative<br>
to the shock absorbing unit attachment member 23A. The shock<br>
absorbing unit 50A is disposed above the cylinder block 300a<br>
and the crank case 300c. The shock absorbing unit 50A is<br>
disposed such that its expanding and contracting direction<br>
(direction indicated by S in the figure) extends substantially<br>
in the front-rear direction of the vehicle and in the<br>
circumferential direction of the pivot shaft 109. That is,<br>
an expanding direction S of the shock absorbing unit 50A is<br>
perpendicular to a line T passing the axial center of the pivot<br>
shaft 109 and extending in the radial direction.<br>
According to the motorcycle 1A, a shock absorbing unit<br>
support member 112A extends between the left.and right inclined,<br>
frame portions 104b, and a pair of plate-shaped shock absorbing<br>
unit attachment members 119A contact the shock absorbing unit<br>
support member 112A. A frame side attachment member 56A of<br>
the shock absorbing unit 50A is attached to the shock absorbing<br>
unit attachment members 119A. The frame side attachment<br>
member 56A is positioned before the pivot shaft 109 with respect<br>
to the vehicle body, and the engine side attachment member 55A<br>
is positioned behind the pivot shaft 109 with respect to the<br>
vehicle body. The shock absorbing unit 50A has a coil spring<br>
31<br><br>
5LA which generates force in the direction for expanding the<br>
distance between the frame side attachment member 56A and the<br>
engine side attachment member 55A.<br>
Similarly to the above example, the supported members<br>
22A are positioned before the crank shaft 34 in the motorcycle<br>
1A. This structure allows the distance between the pivot shaft<br>
109 and the axle 4 of the rear wheel 3 to be enlarged compared<br>
with the structure where a central area and its vicinity near<br>
the center of gravity of the engine unit 20A are suspended by<br>
the body frame 10. Moreover, since the cylinder block 300a<br>
and the cylinder head 300c are disposed such that the axial<br>
direction of the cylinder 31 extends in the front-rear<br>
direction of the vehicle body, the space above the engine unit<br>
20A can be effectively utilized.<br>
32<br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1.	A straddle-type vehicle comprising:<br>
a body frame;<br>
a pivot shaft supported by the body frame;<br>
a rear wheel disposed in a rear part of a vehicle body;<br>
and<br>
an engine unit which contains an engine having a crank<br>
shaft and a transmission mechanism for transmitting rotational<br>
force of the crank shaft to the rear wheel, and is capable of<br>
swinging upward and downward with the rear wheel with a fulcrum<br>
located at the pivot shaft,<br>
wherein:<br>
the crank shaft is disposed in a front part of the engine<br>
unit; and<br>
the engine unit has a supported member disposed before<br>
the crank-shaft and attached to the pivot shaft, and extends<br>
toward the rear from the supported member, and an axle of the<br>
rear wheel is supported by the rear part of the engine unit.<br>
2.	The straddle-type vehicle as claimed in claim 1,<br>
wherein the supported member is positioned at the front end<br>
of the engine unit.<br>
3.	The straddle-type vehicle as claimed in claim 1,<br>
wherein the supported member attached to the pivot shaft is<br>
33<br><br>
disposed at a level sufficient for swinging upward and downward<br>
from a horizontal surface containing the axle at the time of<br>
running of the vehicle.<br>
4. The straddle-type vehicle as claimed in claim 1,<br>
further comprising:<br>
a shock absorbing unit which reduces vibration of the<br>
engine unit,<br>
wherein the shock absorbing unit is disposed in such a<br>
position as to expand and contract in a circumferential<br>
direction of a circle defined around the pivot shaft.<br>
Dated this 2nd day of JANUARY 2008<br>
34<br><br>
A motorcycle includes a pivot shaft supported by a body<br>
frame, and an engine unit which swings upward and downward with<br>
a rear wheel with the fulcrum located at the pivot shaft. A<br>
crank shaft is disposed before the engine unit. The engine<br>
unit has supported members disposed before the crank shaft and<br>
attached to the pivot shaft. The rear part of the engine unit<br>
supports an axle of the rear wheel.</td>
