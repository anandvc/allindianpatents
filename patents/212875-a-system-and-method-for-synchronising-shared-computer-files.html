BACKGROUND<br>
I.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to maintaining a synchronized multi-user collaborative environment, and more particularly to methods and systems of maintaining synchronization in a multi-user collaborative environment through the use of standard internet-formatted electronic mail.<br>
II.        Related Art<br>
In collaborative multi-user environments, often referred to as workgroup environments, a number of users or workgroup members operating in their individual or local workspaces have access to a single computer file simultaneously. The ability to access the file in this maimer typically includes the ability of each member to alter the file at any time as well. Thus, the larger the number of members in the workgroup the more critical it becomes that the individual workspaces of each member be synchronized to ensure that all users in the workgroup have access to the same version of a file.<br>
Various methods and systems for maintaining a synchronized workgroup environment are known in the art. Many such systems involve the use of a centralized workspace wherein synchronized files are maintained in a single location but can be accessed remotely by workgroup members from their local workspaces. Software residing in the centralized workspace performs the task of synchronizing any files that have been accessed and revised simultaneously by various workgroup members in their local workspaces.<br>
One example of such a system utilizes the internet as the means of accessing the centralized workspace. Workgroup members access files installed on a central server using internet browsers installed in their local workspaces. As the workgroup members revise copies of a shared file in their local workspaces, a software plug-in installed on their internet browser communicates those revision to the central server via the internet.   Software residing on the<br><br>
central sewer then synchronizes the file residing on the central server with the revised file located in the individual-workspace. The software on the central server will also send electronic mail. In the standard configuration, a local workspace for a workgroup member must be connected to the internet while the workgroup member is working on a shared file in his local workspace. If a workgroup member wants the ability to work on a shared file while off-line from the internet, he must install additional proprietary software on the computer in his local workspace.<br>
Another method for maintaining a synchronization in an asynchronous distributed workgroup environment involves a rudimentary use of electronic mail to communicate revisions to workgroup members. In its simplest form, a workgroup member will create in their local workspace a file to be shared with the other members of the workgroup. The workgroup member will then send copies of the shared file to the other workgroup members as an electronic mail file attachment, along with written comments or instructions regarding what has been done or is to be done with the copy of the shared file. As each member in the workgroup revises their copy of the shared document in their local workspace, they must then send a copy of their revised copy or version of the shared file to every other member of the workgroup. It is then up to the other workgroup members to notice that a revised copy of the shared file has arrived in their local workspace, and overwrite their copy of the shared file with the revised copy of the shared file or create a new version of the shared file which they will recognize as the latest version of the shared file in their local workspace. In other words, it is up to each individual workgroup member to synchronize his local workspace.<br>
The limitations of the foregoing method are obvious, and become increasingly more limiting as the number of workgroup members increases. Particularly troubling is the scenario involving multiple workgroup members revising their copies of the shared file simultaneously. Rather than simply overwriting their copy of the shared file with the revised copy of the shared file that has arrived in their local workspace, each workgroup member must then choose which revised copy of the shared file to use as the synchronized shared file residing in their local workspace, abandoning the revisions in the other revised copies of the shared file, or create several new versions of the shared file<br><br>
which they will recognize as the latest versions of the shared file in their local workspace.<br>
These problems and deficiencies are recognized and solved by the present invention in the manner described below,<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to a method and system that allows one to maintain synchronization among shared computer files in asynchronous distributed workgroup environments without the need for a centralized workspace or centralized server, homogeneous computers in the local workspaces of workgroup members, proprietary communication protocols or dedicated network connections between members of a workgroup. A system having features of the present invention comprises a number of electronic mail servers, a number of computers capable of sending and receiving standard internet formatted electronic mail, and electronic mail user agents installed on each of the computers. Whenever one of the computers in the system receives an electronic mail message and the user agent resident on that computer detects a synchronization command embedded in the multipurpose internet mail extensions of the internet formatted message, the user agent will synchronize the shared files residing on the computer in the local workspace of that workgroup member. Some types of synchronization commands are accompanied by file attachments or additional MIME parts in the electronic mail message.<br>
A system having features of the present invention may also generate and send to the other members of the workgroup electronic mail messages containing embedded synchronization commands whenever a workgroup member revises a shared computer file in his local workspace. A system having features of the present invention may also utilize embedded mailing list management commands to add and remove computers from the system.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention utilizes commands embedded in standard internet formatted electronic mail to achieve various functions in workgroup environments. Specifically, preferred embodiments of the present invention utilize commands embedded in the multipurpose internet mail extensions (MIME) of standard internet formatted electronic mail to synchronize files shared by members of a workgroup, add new members to a workgroup, and remove existing members from a workgroup. A preferred embodiment of the present invention synchronizes files shared by members of a workgroup automatically and in the background. Preferred embodiments of the present invention also address the situation where two or three workgroup members revise a local workgroup file simultaneously.<br>
Referring now to Figures 1 and lA, there is shown a flow diagram of a computer-implemented method for automatically synchronizing computer files shared by members of a distributed asynchronous workgroup according to one embodiment of the present invention. One skilled in the art will note however that the present invention is neither limited to the particular embodiments disclosed nor distributed asynchronous networks, and may be utilized with, by way of example only, synchronous networks, non-distributed networks, and various combinations thereof.<br><br>
Each member of the workgroup has local copies of the shared files residing on their computer, as well as a workgroup mailing list containing the e-mail addresses of each member in the workgroup. The local copies of the files shared by the members of the workgroup are the only copies of the shared files necessary for the method. There is no need for a centralized workspace wherem the shared files reside and are accessed remotely by members, wherein copies of the shared files reside and are synchronized in that central location, or wherein a master workgroup mailing list would be maintained. Any particular member of the workgroup may also be a member of other workgroups, in which case he will have local copies of shared files and a workgroup mailing list for each of the workgroups of which he is a member. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, each workgroup member has a local workgroup folder, directory, or similar storage location, for each workgroup of which they are a member and wherein their local copies of the shared workgroup files for each workgroup reside.<br>
Referring now to Figure 1, the process begins in step 101 when a workgroup member revises his local copy of a workgroup file. Revisions include creating a new workgroup file, deleting a workgroup file or creating a new version of a workgroup file. Other file operations may however be considered revisions as well. In response to the file revision in step 101, the computer in step 102 automatically creates an e-mail message in MIME format with a synchronization command embedded in the MIME and attaches a copy of the revised local workgroup file to the e-mail message as a MIME file attachment or MIME part. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the synchronization commands are embedded in the MIME formatted e-mail as MIME text header field values. Synchronization commands include add commands, corresponding to the creation of a new workgroup file; update commands, corresponding to the creation of a new version of a workgroup file; and delete commands, corresponding to the deletion of a workgroup file.<br>
Referring still to Fig. 1, in step 103 the computer automatically queues and sends the message created in step 102 to those addresses appearing in the workgroup mailing list of that workgroup member. In step 104 another member of the workgroup receives the e-mail message created in step 102. In response to the receipt of the e-mai] in step 104, the computer automatically determines<br><br>
whether or not there is a synchronization command embedded in the MIME of that e-mail. If there is no embedded synchronization command detected, the e-mail is treated as a normal or non-workgroup related e-mail by the computer in step 105A.<br>
If an embedded synchronization command is detected in step 105, the computer determines in step 106 whether the recipient of that e-mail is a member of the workgroup with which the command is associated. If the recipient has information regarding the workgroup in their local workgroup list they are members of the workgroup. If the computer determines that the recipient is not a member of the workgroup, the e-mail is disregarded in step 106A and no local workgroup file operations are performed in response to the e-maik<br>
If the computer determines in step 106 that the recipient is a member of the workgroup, the computer determines in step 107, referring now, to Figure 1 A, whether the embedded synchronization command is an add or update command. If the computer detects an add or update command, the computer determines in step 108 whether a local copy of the particular workgroup file exists in the local workgroup files of the recipient workgroup member. If a local copy of the workgroup file does exist, the computer creates a backup copy of the existing local copy of the workgroup file in step 109, and saves in step 110 the MIME file attached to the e-mail as the local workgroup file of the recipient workgroup member. The computer will typically store the backup copy in a specially designated file or storage location which can be pre-selected by the computer or system of the invention. In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, the workgroup member can set or select the number of generations of backup copies that will be kept. If the computer determines in step 108 that no local copy of the workgroup file exists, the computer skips to step 110 and saves the MIME file attached to the e-mail as the local copy of the workgroup file of the recipient workgroup member.<br>
Referring still to Figure lA, if the computer determines in step 107 that the synchronization command embedded in the MIME of the e-mail is neither an add nor an update command^ the computer then determines in step 111 whether the synchronization command is a delete command. If the computer determines that the command is not a delete command, the e-mail is disregarded in step<br><br>
Ill A and no local workgroup file operations are performed in response to the e-mail.<br>
If the computer determines in step 111 the embedded synchronization command is a delete command, the computer determines in step 112 whether a local copy of the workgroup file associated with the delete command exists in the active local workgroup files of the recipient workgroup member. If a local copy of the workgroup file does exist, the computer creates a backup copy of the local copy in step 113, and removes or deletes the local copy from the current local workgroup files of the recipient workgroup member. The computer will typically store the backup copy in a specially designated file folder or location. If the computer determines in step 111 that no active local copy of the workgroup file associated with the delete command exists, the e-mail is disregarded in step 112A and no local workgroup file operations are performed in response to the e-mail.<br>
According to an alternative embodiment of the present invention, each local copy of a workgroup file typically has two associated digests, a local-copy.digest and an ancestor.digest, as well as a record of the last modification time of the local copy. Whenever a local copy is revised by a workgroup member in step 101 of the process noted above, the computer updates the last modification time record for the local copy to accurately reflect the time and date when the file was revised. In step 102 of the process above, the computer also creates a new local-copy .digest using a hashing algorithm and saves the existing local-copy.digest as the ancestor.digest, before generating the e-mail message containing the embedded synchronization command.<br>
Those having skill in the art will appreciate that many different hashing algorithms may be used to generate the digests in accordance with the present invention such as the Message Digest 5 (MD5) algorithm, or others such as those discussed in Chapter 18 of "APPLIED CRYPTOGRAPHY, Protocols, Algorithms, and Source Code in C" by Bruce Schneier, 2nd Ed. 1996, Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. However, the Secure Hashing Algorithm (SHA4) defined in FIPS PUB 180-1 issued by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and which is incorporated by reference herein, is particularly well-suited for used with the present invention. The SHA-l algorithm takes a message or file that is less than 264 bits in length and produces a 160-bit message digest that is designed in a way<br><br>
that is computationally expensive to find a text which matches a given hash. In other words, if one has an SHA-1 hash for document A, H(A), it is exceedingly unlikely that one will find a document B where H(B) = H(A). In the case of a new workgroup file being created by a workgroup member, which would ultimately generate an e-mail having an embedded add synchronization command, the local copy will have only a local-copy.digest associated with it until that local copy is revised, at which point the digests are handled as noted above in conjunction with an update.<br>
Having created the new local-copy.digest and saved the previous local-copy.digest as the ancestor.digest, the computer completes step 102 by generating an e-mail message in MIME format with an embedded synchronization command as before, with one exception. The computer includes as part of the embedded synchronization command the ancestor.digest of the revised local copy; unless the revision to the local copy in step 101 was the creation of a new workgroup file, in which case the computer includes as part of the embedded synchronization command a digest that is a copy of the local-copy.digest created for the new file.<br>
The method proceeds as described above up to either step 108 or 112. If the result of the determination in step 108 is "Yes," indicating that a local copy of the attached workgroup file exists, the computer determines whether the digest of the workgroup file attached to the e-mail is identical to the digest of the local copy. Thus, in the case of an update command, the computer determines whether ancestor.digest = local-copy,digest; and in the case of an add command, whether digest = local-copy.digest. If the digests are identical, the add or update command is valid, a backup copy of the existing local copy is created, and the workgroup file attached to the e-mail is saved as the local copy of the workgroup file. If the digests are not identical there is a conflict, indicating that the existing local copy and the copy of the workgroup file attached to the e-mail do not have the same ancestry. The workgroup member is notified of the conflict and must then choose how to resolve the conflict. If the result of the determination in step 108 is "No," indicating that a local copy of the attached workgroup file does not exist, the attached workgroup file is saved as the local copy on the recipient's computer as before.<br><br>
Referring now to step 112, if the result of the determination is "Yes/' the computer determines whether the digest of the workgroup file attached to the e-mail is identical to the digest of the local copy. In other words, whether ancestor.digest = local-copy.digest. If the digests are identical, the delete command is valid, a backup copy of the existing local copy is created and the local copy of the workgroup file is deleted from the recipient's computer. If the digests are not identical there is a conflict, indicating that the existing local copy and the copy of the workgroup file attached to the e-mail do not have the same ancestry. The workgroup member is notified of the conflict and must then choose how to resolve the conflict. If the result of the determination in step 112 is "No," indicating that a local copy of the attached workgroup file does not exist, the computer disregards the e-mail and no file operations are performed on the recipient workgroup member's computer.<br>
Exemplary add, update, and delete commands containing the foregoing digests are seen as follows:<br><br><br><br>
Those having skill in the art will appreciate that other commands and forms of the commands are possible, and that the invention is neither limited to the specific commands nor the specific forms of the commands set forth herein.<br>
Referring now to Figures 2 and 2A, there is shown a flow diagram of a computer-implemented method for automatically adding new members to or removing existing members from a workgroup according to one embodiment of the present invention. Each member of the workgroup has local copies of the shared files residing on their computer, as well as a workgroup mailing list containing the e-mail addresses of each member in the workgroup. The local copies of the files shared by the members of the workgroup are the only copies of the shared files necessary for the method. There is no need for a centralized workspace wherein the shared files reside and are accessed remotely by members, wherein copies of the shared files reside and are synchronized in that central location, or wherein a master workgroup mailing list would be maintained.<br>
Any particular member of the workgroup may also be a member of other workgroups, in which case he will have local copies of shared files and a<br><br>
workgroup mailing list for each of the workgroups of which he is a member. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, each workgroup member has a local workgroup folder or storage location for each workgroup of which he is a member and wherein his local copies of the shared workgroup files for each workgroup reside.<br>
Referring to Figures 1, the process begins in step 201 when a computer user, who may or may not be a current member of the workgroup, receives an e-mail in MIME format. In response to the receipt of the e-mail in step 201, the computer determines whether there is a mailing list management command (MLM command) embedded in the MIME of that e-maiL MLM commands include invitation commands, corresponding to an invitation to add the computer user to the workgroup; rsvp commands, corresponding to the addition of the computer user to the workgroup as a new member; introduction commands, corresponding to the introduction of the new workgroup member to the other workgroup members by the author of the invitation command; welcome commands, corresponding to the welcoming of the new member to the workgroup by the other workgroup members; and leave commands, corresponding to the removal of an existing member from the workgroup. Other MLM commands are contemplated that would correspond to other workgroup mailing list revisions. If there is no embedded MLM command detected, the e-mail is treated as a normal or non-workgroup related e-mail by the computer in step 202A. If an embedded MLM command is detected in step 202, the computer then determines in step 203 whether the MLM command is an invitation command.<br>
Referring still to Figure 2, if the computer detects an invitation command in step 203, the computer determines in step 204 whether the recipient of the e-mail is an existing member of the workgroup. If it is determined that the recipient of the e-mail in step 201 is an existing member of the workgroup, the e-mail is disregarded in step 204A and no operations are performed on the workgroup mailing list of the recipient workgroup member. If it is determined in step 204 that the recipient is not an existing member of the workgroup, the computer automatically creates a workgroup mailing list in step 205. In step 206, the computer then sends an e-mail in MIME format with an invitation command embedded in the MIME of that e-mail to the author of the e-mail received in step<br><br>
201 that contained the invitation command. In another embodiment of the present invention, the computer notifies the new workgroup member that they have been added to the workgroup. In yet another embodiment of the invention, prior to creating the workgroup mailing in step 205, the computer notifies the recipient of the e-mail in step 201 that they have been invited to join the workgroup and queries them whether they wish to join the workgroup. Only if the recipient responds to the query in the affirmative does the computer proceed to steps 205 and 206 described above. Otherwise, the computer disregards the invitation command, and no further steps in the process would be performed.<br>
Referring still to Figure 1, if the computer determines in step 203 that the e-mail contains no embedded invitation command, the computer determines, in step 207, whether the recipient of the e-mail in'step 201 is an existing member of the workgroup. If the recipient is not an existing member of the workgroup, the computer disregards the embedded MLM command in step 207A and exits the process. If the recipient of the e-mail is a member of the workgroup^ the computer determines whether the MLM command is an rsvp command in step 208. If the MLM command is an rsvp command, the computer then determines, in step 209, whether the recipient of the e-mail previously sent an invitation command to the author of the e-mail received in step 201. If the recipient of the e-mail did not previously send an invitation command to the author of the e-mail received in step 201, the computer in step 209A disregards the rsvp command and exits the process. If the recipient of the e-mail did previously send an invitation command to the author of the e-mail received in step 201, the computer adds the author of the e-mail received in step 201 to the workgroup mailing list of the recipient in step 210. In step 211, the computer automatically creates an e-mail message in MIME format with an introduction command embedded in the MIME, queues and sends the e-mail to the other members of the workgroup. The computer may also notify the recipient that the new workgroup member has been added. In an alternative embodiment, the computer may also send copies of the current workgroup files residing on the computer (i.e., the local copies on the computer for the relevant workgroup) to the new workgroup member in step 211. Otherwise, the new workgroup member receives workgroup files in conjunction with add or update commands.<br><br>
Referring still to Figure 2, if the computer determines in step 208 that the embedded MLM command is not an rsvp command, the computer then determines, referring now to Figure 2A, in step 212, whether the MLM command is an introduction command. If the MLM command is an introduction command, the computer determines, in step 213, whether the address of the new member being introduced appears in the workgroup mailing list of the e-mail recipient of step 201. If the address of the new member being introduced does appear in the workgroup mailing list of the e-mail recipient, the computer disregards the introduction command and exits the process in step 213A. If the address of the new member being introduced does not appear in the workgroup mailing list of the e-mail recipient, the computer adds the address of the new member to workgroup mailing list of the e-mail recipient in step 214, The computer, in step 215, automatically creates an e-mail message in MIME format with a welcome command embedded in the MIME, queues and sends the e-mail to the new member whose address was added to the workgroup mailing list in step 214. The computer may also notify the recipient that a new workgroup member has been added.<br>
Referring still to Figure 2A, if the computer determines in step 212 that the embedded MLM command is not an introduction command, the computer then determines whether the MLM command is a welcome command in step 216. If the MLM command is a welcome command, the computer determines, in step 217, whether the address of the author of the e-mail received in step 201 and containing the welcome command appears in the workgroup mailing list of the recipient. If the address of the author of the e-mail received in step 201 appears in the workgroup mailing list of the recipient, the computer disregards the welcome command and exits the process in step 217A. If the address of the author of the e-mail received in step 201 does not appear in the workgroup mailing list of the recipient, the computer adds the address of the author to the workgroup mailing list of the recipient in step 218.<br>
Referring still to Figure 2A, if the computer determines in step 216 that the embedded MLM command is not a welcome command, the computer determines whether the MLM command is a leave command in step 219. If the MLM command is not a leave command, the computer disregards the e-mail received in step 201 and exits the process in step 219A. If the MLM command is<br><br>
a leave command, the computer determines whether the address of the member to be removed appears in the workgroup mailing list of the recipient in step 220. If the address of the member to be removed does not appear in the workgroup mailing list of the recipient^ the computer disregards the leave command and exits the process in step 220A. If the address of the member to be removed appears in the workgroup mailing list of the recipient, the computer removes the address from the workgroup mailing list of the recipient in step 22L The computer may also notify the recipient that a workgroup member has been removed.<br>
