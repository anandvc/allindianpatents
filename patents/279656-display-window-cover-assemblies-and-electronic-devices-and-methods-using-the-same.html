Integral mounting posts and/or bores may be provided on/in the plastic panel 120 to engage complementary features (e.g., mounting holes or posts) of the housing 12 or other components.<br>
[059]   It will thus be appreciated that the plastic panel 120 may be provided with features that serve to facilitate mounting of the cover assembly in the device. Accordingly, in addition or as an alternative to adhering the plastic panel 120 directly to the LCD module 28, other techniques may be employed for mounting the cover assembly 100. For example, the plastic panel 120 can be welded (e.g., ultrasonically welded), heat staked, taped, adhered, or mechanically coupled to the housing (which<br>
 <br>
may also be plastic) or other component(s). The.plastic panel 120 can be directly secured to the housing. According to some embodiments, the plastic panel 120 is directly ultrasonically welded to the housing.<br>
[060]   For example and with reference to Figure 8, a mobile terminal 10' according to further embodiments of the invention is shown therein. The mobile terminal 10' corresponds to the mobile terminal 10 except that the mobile terminal 10' further includes a mounting post 12E forming a part of the housing 12 and the cover assembly 100 is replaced with a composite window cover assembly 200. The cover assembly 200 corresponds to the cover assembly 100 except that the cover assembly 200 includes a mounting hole 227 that receives the mounting post 12E there through to secure and/or position the cover assembly 200 in the housing 12. For example, the post 12E may receive a nut, screw, heat stake or the like to retain the cover assembly 200.<br>
[061]   By way of further example and with reference to Figure 9, a mobile terminal 10" according to further embodiments of the invention is shown therein. The mobile terminal 10" corresponds to the mobile terminal 10 except that the mobile terminal 10" further includes a snap feature or hole 12F forming a part of the housing 12 and the cover assembly 100 is replaced with a cover assembly 300. The cover assembly 300 corresponds to the cover assembly 100 except that the cover assembly 300 includes a snap feature or member 329 that engages and interlocks with the snap feature 12F.<br>
[062]   Display window cover assemblies in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention may provide various advantages. The glass panel may provide desirable or requisite hardness or scratch resistance while the plastic panel provides desired or required mounting features, cosmetic decoration, functional coatings or optical features, etc. The plastic panel may allow for the provision of a wide range of mounting features and/or decorative effects, which may be provided at a relatively a low cost. According to some embodiments, the plastic panel is decorated and the glass panel is not decorated.<br>
[063]   The plastic panel may provide an anti-splinter or anti-shatter' functionality to prevent or inhibit dispersion of the glass panel in the event the glass panel is broken. The composite display window cover may have increased impact resistance as compared to either a glass display window cover or a plastic display<br>
 <br>
window cover. The composite display window coyer may allow for a thinner product.<br>
[064]   Although the electronic devices are discussed herein as being included as part of a mobile wireless communication terminal, for example, the mobile terminal 10 of Figures 5-7, embodiments of the present invention are not limited to this configuration. Various aspects of the present invention may be incorporated into other types of devices including, for example, mobile devices that are not wireless communication terminals or non-portable electronic devices.<br>
[065]   Many alterations and modifications may be made by those having ordinary skill in the art, given the benefit of present disclosure, without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Therefore, it must be understood that the illustrated embodiments have been set forth only for the purposes of example, and that it should not be taken as limiting the invention as defined by the following claims. The following claims, therefore, are to be read to include not only the combination of elements which are literally set forth but all equivalent elements for performing substantially the same function in substantially the same way to obtain substantially the same result. The claims are thus to be understood to include what is specifically illustrated and described above, what is conceptually equivalent, and also what incorporates the essential idea of the invention.<br>
