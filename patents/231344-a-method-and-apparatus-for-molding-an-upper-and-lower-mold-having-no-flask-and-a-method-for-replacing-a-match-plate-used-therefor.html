In the removing mechanism 12, a pushing member 28, which is fixed at the distal end of the piston rod of the cylinder 29, is arranged downward and fixed to the upper portion of the base 1. It can be inserted in the upper and the lower flasks 2, 3, which match each other, and which are horizontal, and which can move up and down by driving the cylinder 29. [0055]<br>
A supporting member 30 is disposed below the pushing member 28, which supports the upper and the lower mold that are removed from the upper and the lower flask 2, 3, and which can move up and down by means of a pantograph mechanism driven by a cylinder 31.<br>
Namely, since the pantograph mechanism is used to move the supporting member 30, it is unnecessary to provide a pit for the removing mechanism 12. (See Fig. 2.) [0056]<br>
In the rotating mechanism 13, a rotating shaft 33 extending upward and downward is rotatably disposed at the base 1. The distal end of the rotating shaft 33 is connected to an output shaft of a motor 34 fixed to the upper end of the base 1. The rotating shaft 33 can be rotated clockwise or counterclockwise for 180 degrees by the motor 34.<br>
A supporting element 35 is disposed at the top of the rotating shaft 33. Two pairs of guide rods 36, 36 extending downward are hung from the support element 35 with a set interval in the direction connecting the front and the back side of the rotating mechanism 13.<br>
Two pairs of the guide rods 36, 36 are symmetrically located about the rotating shaft 33. [0057]<br>
Upper hooks 37 for hooking the protuberances 2a, 2a of the upper flask 2 are slidably disposed at each of the two pairs of the guide rods 36, 36.<br>
The hooks 37 are fixed to the distal end of the piston rod of a cylinder 38 arranged vertically and connected to the rotating shaft 33. The hooks 37 can move up and down by driving the cylinder 38.<br>
14<br><br>
[0058]<br>
Lower hooks 39 for hooking the protuberances 3a, 3a of the lower flask 3 are disposed at the lower ends of the two pairs of the guide rods 36, 36. [0059]<br>
A symbol 40, shown in the figures, indicates an apparatus for taking out the upper and the lower mold that are removed from the upper and the lower flask 2, 3 from the supporting member 30. [0060]<br>
Figs. 8—14 show an apparatus using the upper and lower segmented-squeeze feet as the upper and the lower squeeze means for molding the upper and the lower mold having no flask. [0061]<br>
The difference between the apparatus using the upper and lower segmented-squeeze feet as the upper and the lower squeeze means and using the upper and lower squeeze plate as the ones for molding the upper and the lower mold having no flask is the use of a plurality of the upper and lower segmented-squeeze feet 6a, 6a, 7a, 7a instead of the upper and the lower squeeze plate.<br>
The upper and lower segmented-squeeze feet 6a, 6a, 7a, 7a can be inserted into the openings of the upper and the lower flask 2, 3 that have no match plate 5 so that the segmented-squeeze feet can be taken out. [0062]<br>
A plurality of cylinders 24', 24' are disposed at the upper lifting and lowering frame 20 to move an upper squeeze plate 6' forward and backward as shown in Fig. 9. A plurality of cylinders 25', 25' are disposed at the lower lifting and lowering frame 21 to move a lower squeeze plate 7' forward and backward.<br>
A plurality of the upper segmented-squeeze feet 6a, 6a can move forward and backward by driving a plurality of the cylinders 6b, 6b. A plurality of the lower segmented-squeeze feet 7a, 7a can move forward and backward by driving a plurality of the cylinders 7b, 7b. [0063]<br>
The upper and the lower lifting and lowering frame 20, 21 have large horizontal flat surfaces so as to push the upper and the lower flask 2, 3, which are similar to the apparatus using the upper and the lower squeeze<br>
15<br><br>
plate, as the upper and the lower squeeze means for molding the upper and<br>
the lower mold having no flask.<br>
[0064]<br>
The difference between the apparatus using the upper and lower segmented-squeeze feet as the upper and the lower squeeze means and using the upper and the lower squeeze plate as the ones for molding the upper and the lower mold having no flask is explained above.<br>
These two apparatuses are comprised of the same elements, except for the different elements explained above. [0065]<br>
Below, the second embodiment of the removing mechanism 12, which can be installed in two types of the apparatus for molding the molds explained above, is now explained in detail based on Figs. 15 and 16. [0066]<br>
The second embodiment of the removing mechanism is comprised of a supporting member 119 having a configuration of a rectangular plate to support the molds, wherein the supporting member 119 can be lifted, lowered, and inserted into the lower flask 3,<br>
a lower air cylinder 120 disposed under the supporting member 119 to lift and lower the supporting member 119,<br>
a lower lifting and lowering table 121, wherein the lower air cylinder 120 is disposed under the lower lifting and lowering table 121,<br>
a lower toggle mechanism 122 to lift and lower the lower lifting and lowering table 121, which is disposed under the lower lifting and lowering table 121,<br>
a pushing member 123 disposed above the supporting member 119 at a set distance away that can move up and down, and that can be inserted in the upper flask 2, to press the molds out,<br>
an upper hydraulic cylinder 124 disposed above the pushing member 123 to lift and lower the pushing member 123,<br>
an upper lifting and lowering table 125, wherein the upper hydraulic cylinder 124 is disposed above the upper lifting and lowering table 125, and an upper toggle mechanism 126 disposed above the upper lifting and lowering table 125 to lift and lower the upper lifting and lowering table 125. [0067]<br>
As shown in Fig. 15, the lower toggle mechanism is comprised of-<br>
16<br><br>
a lower base table 127 having a horizontal and flat surface,<br>
two pairs of toggle main structures 128, 128 disposed between the upper surface of the lower base table 127 and the lower surface of the lower lifting and lowering table 121, and<br>
a cylinder 129 disposed horizontally between the two pairs of the toggle main structures 128, 128.<br>
The lower toggle mechanism can lift and lower the lower lifting and lowering table 121 by driving the cylinder 129.<br>
The upper toggle mechanism 126 is also comprised of<br>
an upper base table 130 having a horizontal and flat surface,<br>
two pairs of toggle main structures 131, 131 disposed between the lower surface of the upper base table 130 and the upper surface of the upper lifting and lowering table 125, and<br>
a cylinder 132 disposed horizontally between the two pairs of the toggle main structures 131, 131,<br>
which are similar to the lower toggle mechanism.<br>
The upper toggle mechanism can lift and lower the upper lifting and lowering table 125 by driving the cylinder 132. [0068]<br>
In this embodiment, the upper and the lower toggle mechanism are used as the upper and- the lower folding and retracting mechanism. However, the upper and the lower folding and retracting mechanism are not limited to the upper and the lower toggle mechanism.<br>
A pantograph mechanism can be used as the folding and retracting mechanism. [0069]<br>
The processes for molding the upper and the lower mold having no flask by the apparatus using the squeeze plates as the squeeze means are now explained in detail based on Fig. 1. [0070]<br>
First, the match plate 5 is inserted between a pair of the upper and the lower flask 2, 3, which are horizontal, by driving the cylinder 16 of the conveying apparatus 4 so that a pair of the arms 17, 17 can rotate. Next, while the upper flask 2 is being slightly moved up and down by driving the cylinder 38, the pair of the arms 17, 17 are released from the carriage 45 by driving the cylinder 16 of the conveying apparatus 4 so that the pair of the<br>
17<br><br>
arms 17, 17 can rotate clockwise and are returned to the initial position.<br>
[0071]<br>
Then, the upper and the lower flask 2, 3 access each other by means of driving the cylinder 22, which is arranged upward, and the cylinder 23, which is arranged downward, of the squeezing mechanism 9, so that the upper and the lower lifting and lowering frame 20, 21 can access each other.<br>
Next, while the upper and the lower flask 2, 3 are holding the match plate 5 between them, the upper squeeze plate 6 and the lower squeeze plate<br>
7	are inserted into the upper and the lower flask 2, 3 at a predetermined<br>
depth to define the upper and the lower molding space by driving a plurality<br>
of the cylinders 24, 24, 25, 25 of the squeezing mechanism 9.<br>
Then, the pair of the upper and the lower flask 2, 3 and the match plate 5 become perpendicular by driving the cylinder 10 so that the squeezing mechanism 9 rotates clockwise about the supporting shaft 8.<br>
The intakes for foundry sand are moved upward and caused to contact the lower ends of the two aeration tanks 27, 27 of the aeration mechanism 11. (See Fig. 4.) [0072]<br>
In this case, while the upper and the lower molding space are being defined, the squeezing mechanism 9 may be rotated clockwise about the supporting shaft 8 by driving the cylinder 10.<br>
Further, after the upper and the lower molding space are defined, the squeezing mechanism 9 may be rotated clockwise about the supporting shaft<br>
8	by driving the cylinder 10.<br>
[0073]<br>
Then, the upper and the lower molding space are filled with the foundry sand by discharging the foundry sand from the aeration mechanism 11 through the intakes.<br>
The foundry sand in the upper and the lower molding space is squeezed by moving the upper and the lower squeeze plate 6, 7 forward.<br>
The upper and the lower flask and the match plate are rotated so that they are horizontal.<br>
In this case, the process for squeezing the foundry sand and the process for rotating the upper and the lower flask and the match plate so that they are horizontal may be carried out simultaneously. Otherwise, either of them may be carried out before the other.<br>
18<br><br>
[0074]<br>
The process to fill the foundry sand and the squeezing process may be carried out by the following two-stage process. Namely, the upper and the lower molding space are filled with the foundry sand by discharging the foundry sand from the aeration mechanism 11 through the intakes, and then the upper and the lower squeeze plate 6, 7 are moved backward to retract the squeeze plates 6, 7 to a position near the opening of a pair of the upper and the lower flask by driving a plurality of the cylinders 24, 24, 25, 25. [0075]<br>
Next, the upper and the lower molding space are also filled with the foundry sand by discharging the foundry sand from the aeration mechanism 11 through the intakes, and while the upper and the lower flask 2, 3 and the match plate 5 are rotated so that they are horizontal, the foundry sand in the upper and the lower molding space is squeezed by driving a plurality of the cylinders 24, 24, 25, 25 so that the upper and the lower squeeze plate 6, 7 move forward. [0076]<br>
In the process for filling and squeezing the foundry sand, the upper and lower squeeze plates 6, 7 are moved backward to retract the squeeze plates 6, 7 to a position near the opening of the pair of the upper and the lower flask, after the upper and the lower molding space defined by inserting the upper and lower squeeze plates 6, 7 in the upper and the lower flask 2, 3 are filled with the foundry sand.<br>
However, while the upper and the lower molding space defined by inserting the upper and lower squeeze plates 6, 7 in the upper and the lower flask 2, 3 are being filled with the foundry sand, the upper and the lower squeeze plate 6, 7 may move backward to retract the squeeze plates 6, 7 to a position near the opening of the pair of the upper and the lower flask. [0077]<br>
As mentioned above, by using the two-stage process for filling and squeezing the foundry sand, it is possible to increase the hardness of the foundry sand near the opening of the upper and lower flasks 2, 3. [0078]<br>
After the process for filling and squeezing the foundry sand is completed, the upper and the lower lifting and lower frame 20, 21 are moved apart from each other by driving the cylinder 22, which is arranged upward,<br>
19<br><br>
and the cylinder 23, which is arranged downward.<br>
[0079]<br>
Then, the upper flask 2, containing the mold molded by squeezing the foundry sand, is hung by the upper hooks 37, and is separated from the match plate 5.<br>
The lower flask 3 is positioned on the lower hooks 39 of the rotating mechanism 13, and then the match plate 5, which is located between the upper and the lower flask 2,3, is carried out by driving the cylinder 16 so that the arms 17, 17 are rotated.<br>
Next, the upper and lower flasks 2, 3, containing the molds, are moved to the position of the removing mechanism 12 by driving the motor 34 of the rotating mechanism 13 so that the rotating shaft 33 can be rotated by a predetermined angle, and if necessary, after the core is set, the upper flask 2, containing the mold, is matched to the lower flask 3 by driving the cylinder 38 so that the upper flask 3, located on the upper hooks 37, can descend. [0080]<br>
Then, the upper and lower flasks 2, 3, containing the molds, are put on the supporting table 30 by driving the cylinder 31 of the removing mechanism 12 so that the supporting table can ascend.<br>
After the pushing member 28 is put on the upper surface of the upper flask 2 by driving the cylinder 29 of the removing mechanism 12, the molds are removed from the upper and the lower flask 2, 3 by driving the cylinder 31 so that the pushing member 28 and the supporting table 30 can descend together.<br>
Then, the upper and the lower mold on the supporting table 30 are pressed out by the apparatus for taking out the lower mold 40. [0081]<br>
In the above processes, while the upper and lower flasks 2, 3 are rotated and moved to the position of the removing mechanism 12, if necessary, after the core is set in the mold which has already been made, the pair of the upper and the lower flask 2,3 are matched to each other, and the molds are removed from the flasks, wherein these processes are similar to the method mentioned above. [0082]<br>
Next, the processes for replacing the match plates of the apparatus for molding the molds having no flask are explained in detail.<br>
20<br><br>
As shown in Fig. 5(a), after the upper flasks 2, 2 are hung by driving the cylinders 38, 38 of the rotating mechanism 13 so that the upper flasks 2, 2 on the upper hooks 37, 37 can ascend, the carriage 45, having the match plate 5(A) on it, is transferred from the rails 46 to the rails 47 of the upper flask 2 by driving the cylinder 16 of the conveying apparatus 4 so that a pair of the arms 17, 17 rotate counterclockwise. Then, the match plate 5(A) is transferred to the upper flask 2, located at the left side.<br>
As shown in Fig. 5(b), while the upper flask 2 is being moved slightly up and down by driving the cylinder 38, the pair of the arms 17, 17 are released from the carriage 45 by driving the cylinder 16 of the conveying apparatus 4 so that the pair of the arms 17, 17 can rotate clockwise and are returned to the initial position. Further, the carriage 45, having the match plate 5(B) on it to be replaced, which is hung from the rails disposed at a transfer apparatus, and which is waiting at the removing mechanism 12, moves to the position that is opposed to the rails 47 of the upper flask 2, which is at the right side of the apparatus and which is located at the removing mechanisml2. [0083]<br>
As shown in Fig. 6(a), the carriage 45, disposed at the position that is opposed to the rails 47 of the upper flask 2, which is located at the right side of the apparatus, and located at the removing mechanism 12, is manually moved on the rails 47. The match plate 5(B), positioned at the right side, is moved to the upper flask, positioned at the right side, then the match plate 5(A), positioned at the squeezing mechanism 9, is rotated and moved to the removing mechanism 12, and the match plate 5(B), positioned at the removing mechanism 12, is rotated and moved to the squeezing mechanism 9 by driving the motor 34 of the rotating mechanism, as shown in Fig. 6(b). [0084]<br>
Then, as shown in Fig.7(a), a pair of the arms 17, 17 are connected to the carriage 45 having the match plate 5(B) on it by driving the cylinder 16 so that the pair of the arms 17, 17 can rotate counterclockwise, while the upper flask 2 is being moved up and down for a small distance by driving the cylinder 38.<br>
Next, a carriage 45 having the match plate 5(A) on it is moved from the rails 47 of the upper flask 2 to the outside of the apparatus, and the carriage 45 having the match plate 5(B) is moved from the rails 47 of the<br>
21<br><br>
upper flask 2 to the rails 46 by driving the cylinder 16 of the conveying apparatus 4 so that the pair of the arms 17, 17 can rotate clockwise, and then the match plate 5(B) is moved from the upper flask 2. The carriage 45, having the match plate 5(A) and being removed from the rails 47, is moved to a proper place by a proper transfer means. Consequently, the process for replacing the match plate 5 is completed. [0085]<br>
Processes for molding the upper and the lower mold having no flask by the apparatus using the segmented-squeeze feet as the squeeze means are explained in detail based on Fig. 8. [0086]<br>
First, the match plate 5 is inserted between a pair of the upper and the lower flask 2, 3 which are horizontal, by driving the cylinder 16 of the conveying apparatus 4 so that the pair of the arms 17, 17 can rotate. (See Fig. 9.) [0087]<br>
Then, the upper and the lower flask 2, 3 access each other by driving the cylinder 22, which is arranged upward, and the cylinder 23, which is arranged downward, of the squeezing mechanism 9, so that the upper and the lower lifting and lowering frame 20, 21 can access each other, and by driving the cylinder 38 so that the upper hooks 37 can descend.<br>
Next, while the upper and the lower flask 2, 3 are holding the match plate 5 between them, a plurality of the upper and lower segmented-squeeze feet 6a, 6a, 7a, 7a are inserted in the upper and the lower flask at a predetermined depth to define the upper and the lower molding space by driving a plurality of the cylinders 24, 24, 25, 25 of the squeezing mechanism 9.<br>
Then, the pair of the upper and the lower flask 2, 3 and the match plate 5 become perpendicular by driving the cylinder 10 so that the squeezing mechanism 9 rotates clockwise about the supporting shaft 8.<br>
The intakes for foundry sand are moved upward and contact the lower ends of the two aeration tanks of the aeration mechanism 11. (See Fig. 12(a).) [0088]<br>
In this case, while the upper and the lower molding space are being defined, the squeezing mechanism 9 may be rotated clockwise about the<br>
22<br><br>
supporting shaft 8 by driving the cylinder 10.<br>
Further, after the upper and the lower molding space are defined, the squeezing mechanism 9 may be rotated clockwise about the supporting shaft 8 by driving the cylinder 10. [0089]<br>
A plurality of the upper and lower segmented-squeeze feet 6a, 6a, 7a, 7a of the upper and the lower squeeze means are moved for a predetermined distance so that each of the respective ratios of the distance between each of the upper and lower segmented-squeeze feet 6a, 6a, 7a, 7a and the match plate 5 before squeezing the foundry sand to that after squeezing becomes almost equal. [0090]<br>
When, as shown in Fig. 12(b), the distances between a plurality of the upper and lower segmented-squeeze feet 6a, 6a, 7a, 7a and the corresponding portion of the match plate 5 before squeezing the foundry sand are defined as "A" and "B," and, as shown in Fig. 12(c), those after squeezing are defined as "a" and "b," the segmented-squeeze feet 6a, 6a, ;7a, 7a are moved so that the ratios of "a/A" and "b/B" can have the relation close to "a/A=b/B." [0091]<br>
Namely, when the height of the portion of the match plate is high, the upper and lower segmented-squeeze feet 6a, 6a, 7a, 7a are moved so that the quantity of the foundry sand at the position corresponding to the portion becomes less, and when the height of the portion of the match plate is low, they are not moved too much, so that the quantity of the foundry sand at the position corresponding to the portion becomes greater. [0092]<br>
Then, the upper and the lower molding space are filled with the foundry sand by discharging the foundry sand from the aeration mechanism 11 through the intakes of the upper and the lower flask 2, 3.<br>
The foundry sand in the upper and lower molding space is squeezed by driving a plurality of the cylinders 24, 24, 25, 25, so that a plurality of the upper and lower segmented-squeeze feet 6a, 6a, 7a, 7a can move forward, while the pair of the upper and the lower flask 2, 3 and the match plate are being rotated so that they become horizontal.<br>
Next, after a plurality of the upper and lower segmented-squeeze feet 6a, 6a, 7a, 7a are retracted by driving a plurality of the cylinders 24, 24, 25,<br>
23<br><br>
25, the segmented-squeeze feet 6a, 6a, 7a, 7a are moved further forward by driving the cylinders 24, 24, 25, 25.<br>
By these processes, the density of the foundry sand of the upper and the lower mold can become uniform, and the surface opposed to the upper and lower segmented-squeeze feet 6a, 6a, 7a, 7a of the foundry sand in the flasks 2, 3 can also become flat. (See Fig. 12(c).) [0093]<br>
The upper and the lower Lifting and lowering frame 20, 21 are moved apart from each other by driving the cylinder 22, arranged upward, and the cylinder 23, arranged downward.<br>
Then, the upper flask 2, containing the mold molded by squeezing the foundry sand, is hung by the upper hooks 37, and is separated from the match plate 5 by driving the cylinder 38 of the rotating mechanism 13. The lower flask 3 is positioned on the lower hooks 39 of the rotating mechanism 13, and then the match plate 5, which is located between the upper and the lower flask 2, 3, is carried out by driving the cylinder 16 so that the arms 17, 17 can rotate.<br>
Next, the upper and lower flasks 2, 3, containing the mold, are moved to the position of the removing mechanism 12 by driving the motor 34 of the rotating mechanism 13 so that the rotating shaft 33 can rotate to a predetermined angle, and if necessary, after the core is set, the upper flask 2, containing the mold, is matched to the lower flask 3 by driving the cylinder 38 so that the upper flask 2 on the upper hooks 37 can descend. (See Fig. 10.) [0094]<br>
Then, the upper and the lower flask 2, 3, containing the mold, are put on the supporting table 44 by driving the cylinder 43 of the supporting device 30 so that the supporting table 44 can ascend, and by driving the cylinder 31 so that the supporting table 44 on the lifting and lowering table 42 can further ascend.<br>
After the pushing member 28 is put on the upper surface of the upper flask 2 by driving the cylinder 29 of the removing mechanism 12, the upper and the lower mold are removed from the upper and the lower flask 2, 3 by driving the cylinder 31 so that the pushing member 28 and the supporting table 44 can descend together.<br>
Then, the upper and the lower mold on the supporting table 44 and<br>
24<br><br>
the lifting and lowering table 42 are further caused to descend by driving the cylinder 31, and are pressed out by the apparatus for taking out the molds 40. [0095]<br>
In the above processes, while the upper and the lower flask 2, 3 are being rotated and moved to the position of the removing mechanism 12, if necessary, after the core is set in the mold which has been molded already, the pair of the upper and the lower flask 2, 3 containing the mold may be matched to each other, and then the molds may be removed from the flasks. This process is similar to the method mentioned above. [0096]<br>
In this preferred embodiment, when the distances between a plurality of the upper and lower segmented-squeeze feet 6a, 6a, 7a, 7a and the corresponding portion of the match plate 5 before squeezing the foundry sand are defined as "A" and "B," and those after squeezing are defined as "a" and "b," the segmented-squeeze feet 6a, 6a, 7a, 7a are moved so that the ratios of "a/A" and "b/B" can have the relation of close to "a/A=b/B," to thereby make the density of the foundry sand of the upper and the lower mold become uniform, and to make the surface of the foundry sand in the flasks 2, 3 opposed to the upper and lower segmented-squeeze feet 6a, 6a, 7a, 7a also become flat.<br>
However, the method for molding the molds is not limited to this process.<br>
For example, as shown in Figs. 13(a) — 13(c), after the space between the match plate 5 and a plurality of the upper and lower segmented-squeeze feet 6a, 6a, 7a, 7a opposed to the match plate 5 is formed so that the foundry sand can easily flow in the space, the molds may be molded by discharging the foundry sand into the molding space through the intakes of the upper and the lower flask 2, 3. [0097]<br>
It is possible to reduce the friction between the foundry sand and a wall of an aeration tank by jetting air into a nozzle (especially, a nozzle throat) of the aeration tank and a portion where it is difficult for the foundry sand to flow to make the foundry sand easily flow in the space between a plurality of the upper and lower segmented-squeeze feet 6a, 6a, 7a, 7a and the match plate 5.<br>
25<br><br>
[0098]<br>
As shown in Figs. 14(a) — 14(b), the following process may also be acceptable.<br>
Namely, after the upper and the lower molding space, which are perpendicular, are defined by the match plate 5, by the upper and the lower flask 2, 3, and by a plurality of the upper and lower segmented-squeeze feet 6a, 6a, 7a, 7a, acting as the upper and the lower squeeze means, then the foundry sand is discharged into the upper and the lower molding space through the intakes of the upper and the lower flask 2, 3.<br>
Then the foundry sand in the molding space is squeezed by driving a plurality of the cylinders 6b, 6b, 7b, 7b so that a plurality of the segmented-squeeze feet 6a, 6a, 7a, 7a can move forward.<br>
Next, after a plurality of the upper and lower segmented-squeeze feet 6a, 6a, 7a, 7a are retracted by driving a plurality of the cylinders 6b, 6b, 7b, 7b, the foundry sand is further discharged into the upper and the lower molding space through the intakes.<br>
Then, the squeezing surfaces of a plurality of the upper and lower segmented-squeeze feet 6a, 6a, 7a, 7a are arranged in a flat plane, and the foundry sand in the upper and the lower molding space is further squeezed by driving a plurality of the cylinders 19, 19, 20, 20 so that a plurality of the upper and lower segmented-squeeze feet 6a, 6a, 7a, 7a can move forward together. [0099]<br>
Further, a plurality of the upper and lower segmented-squeeze feet 6a, 6a, 7a, 7a, integrated with some of a plurality of the upper and lower segmented-squeeze feet 6a, 6a, 7a, 7a, can be used. [0100]<br>
When the upper and the lower mold that have no flask are molded by the apparatus using the segmented-squeeze feet as the squeeze means for molding the molds, the method for replacing the match plate is the same as that used in molding the molds by the apparatus using the squeeze plates as the squeeze means. [0101]<br>
Below, the method for removing the molds by using the second embodiment of the removing mechanism 12 is explained in detail based on Figs. 15-20.<br>
26<br><br>
[0102]<br>
After the foundry sand in the upper and the lower molding space is squeezed, the upper and the lower lifting and lowering frame 20, 21 are separated from each other, and the upper flask containing the mold molded by squeezing the foundry sand is raised by using the upper hooks 37 and by driving the cylinder 38 of the rotating mechanism 13, and is separated from the match plate 5.<br>
Then, the lower flask 3 is put on the lower hooks 39 of the rotating mechanism 13, and the match plate 5 is removed from the area between the upper and the lower flask 2, 3. [0103]<br>
Next, the upper and the lower flask 2, 3, containing the mold, are moved to the removing mechanism 12 by driving the motor 34 of the rotating mechanism 13 so that the rotating shaft 33 can rotate over a predetermined angle. If necessary, after the core is set in the mold, the upper flask 2 on the upper hooks 37 is lowered and matched to the lower flask 3. [0104]<br>
Then, after the upper and the lower flask 2, 3 are held between the upper and the lower lifting and lowering table 125, 121 by driving the cylinders 132, 129 of the upper and the lower toggle mechanism 126, 122 so that the lifting and lowering tables 125, 121 can access each other as shown in Fig. 18(a), the supporting member 119 contacts the lower surface of the lower mold by driving the air cylinder 120 as shown in Fig. 18(b).<br>

A matchplate is held by a cope and drag as a set, the cope and drag being in a horizontal state and each having a sand blowing nozzle in the side wall. Upper and lower squeeze means are respectively inserted in matchplate-less openings in the cope and drag to define two upper and lower cavities. The cope and drag and the matchplate are set in a vertical state, and at the same time the sand blowing nozzles are moved upward. Molding sand is blown from the sand blowing nozzles into the two upper and lower forming cavities to fill the cavities. While the cope and drag and the matchplate being returned to a horizontal state, the upper and lower squeeze means are further advanced, and the molding sand in the two upper and lower forming cavities are individually squeezed. The cope and drag containing the mold are separated from the matchplate, and then the matchplate is removed from between the cope and drag. A core is set, when required, in the mold previously formed during the steps above, and then the mold is removed from the cope and drag containing the mold.<br></td>
