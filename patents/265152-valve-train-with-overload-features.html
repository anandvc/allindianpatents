				<td>VALVE TRAIN WITH OVERLOAD FEATURES<br>
FIELD<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to valve trains, and more<br>
particularly to a valve train having overload features.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may or may not constitute prior<br>
art.<br>
[0003] Internal combustion engines typically include an arrangement of<br>
pistons and cylinders located within an engine block. In a four stroke engine,<br>
each cylinder has at least two valves. These valves control the flow of air to the<br>
combustion cylinders and allow for venting of combustion exhaust gasses. A<br>
simple valve arrangement includes an intake valve and an exhaust valve, each<br>
actuated by a valve train. The valve train typically includes a camshaft with cam<br>
followers that actuate respective pushrods and rocker assemblies. The rocker<br>
assemblies in turn actuate respective intake and exhaust valves.<br>
[0004] Though unlikely, it is possible that during operation of the valve<br>
train, a failure may occur in one of the various components. One such failure<br>
could include a mistimed event. A mistimed event may occur when the intake<br>
valve in an engine employing cylinder deactivation is inadvertently reactivated<br>
before the activation of the exhaust valve. In this scenario, the intake valve is<br><br>
forced open against combustion and exhaust gasses under large amounts of<br>
pressure. These gasses may create as much as 19.5 kN of force and cause<br>
failures in expensive and/or difficult to replace components within the valve train<br>
or engine. Accordingly, it is desirable that the valve train is designed to fail at<br>
controlled locations in order to prevent more extensive damage to the valve train<br>
and/or engine during a mistiming event<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0005] In one aspect of the present invention, a valve train for use in an<br>
engine is provided. The valve train includes a rocker arm assembly having a<br>
valve side arm and a cam side arm. A valve is coupled to the engine and is in<br>
contact with the valve side arm. A pushrod is reciprocatable by a camshaft and<br>
is in contact with the cam side arm. An overload feature is located on at least<br>
one of either the rocker arm assembly or the pushrod. The overload feature has<br>
a reduced cross-sectional area calibrated to activate at a predefined load.<br>
[0006] In another aspect of the present invention, the overload feature<br>
is located on the pushrod.<br>
[0007] In yet another aspect of the present invention, the pushrod<br>
includes a first wall portion with a first thickness and a second wall portion within<br>
the overload feature with a second thickness, and wherein the second thickness<br>
is less than the first thickness.<br><br>
[0008] In yet another aspect of the present invention, the second wall<br>
portion is located proximate to an end of the pushrod that contacts the cam side<br>
lever arm.<br>
[0009] In yet another aspect of the present invention, the rocker arm<br>
assembly includes an annular extension that defines a bore, and the overload<br>
feature includes a first slot and a second slot located on the annular extension.<br>
[0010] In yet another aspect of the present invention, the first slot and<br>
the second slot are located on opposite sides of the annular extension.<br>
[0011] In yet another aspect of the present invention, the first slot<br>
reduces a cross-sectional area through the annular extension a first amount and<br>
the second slot reduces a cross-sectional area through the annular extension a<br>
second amount that is different than the first amount.<br>
[0012] In yet another aspect of the present invention, the rocker arm<br>
assembly further includes a bolt that couples the rocker arm assembly to the<br>
engine, and wherein the overload feature is located on the bolt.<br>
[0013] In yet another aspect of the present invention, the bolt includes<br>
a cylindrical shaft having a portion with a first cross-sectional area and a portion<br>
within the overload feature and having a second cross-sectional area less than<br>
the first cross-sectional area.<br>
[0014] In still another aspect of the present invention, a rocker arm<br>
assembly for use in a valve train having a pushrod and a valve is provided. The<br>
rocker arm assembly includes a rocker body, a valve side arm extending from the<br>
rocker body and in contact with the valve, and a cam side arm extending from the<br><br>
rocker body opposite the valve side arm and in contact with the push rod. A slot<br>
is located in the cam side arm and has a size calibrated such that the cam side<br>
arm will fail at a predefined load.<br>
[0015] In yet another aspect of the present invention, the slot is<br>
circular.<br>
[0016] In yet another aspect of the present invention, the circular slot is<br>
located in a first surface of the rocker arm and the pushrod contacts a second<br>
surface of the rocker arm opposite the first surface.<br>
[0017] In yet another aspect of the present invention, the circular slot is<br>
aligned with the pushrod.<br>
[0018] In yet another aspect of the present invention, the rocker arm<br>
assembly further includes a pair of side slots extending from the circular slot.<br>
[0019] In yet another aspect of the present invention, the side slots<br>
extend from opposite sides of the circular slot along the length of the second<br>
rocker arm.<br>
[0020] In yet another aspect of the present invention, the rocker arm<br>
assembly further includes a fluid port formed in the top surface of the second<br>
rocker arm and located within the circular slot.<br>
[0021] In yet another aspect of the present invention, a failure occurs<br>
when the pushrod pushes through the circular slot of the second rocker arm.<br>
[0001] In yet another aspect of the present invention, the second<br>
rocker arm grips the pushrod if the pushrod pushes through the circular slot in<br>
the second rocker arm during a failure.<br><br>
[0002] Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the<br>
description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and<br>
specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0010]	The following description is merely exemplary in nature and<br>
is not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses.<br>
[0011]	Referring now to FIG. 1, a portion of an internal combustion<br>
engine is illustrated and generally designated by the reference number 10. The<br>
internal combustion engine 10 includes an engine block 12 which defines a<br>
plurality of cylinders 14, only one of which is illustrated in FIG. 1. A cylinder head<br>
16 is secured to the top of the engine block 12 and defines at least one inlet<br>
passageway 18A and one exhaust passageway 18B for each cylinder 14.<br>
[0012]	The internal combustion engine 10 also includes a valve<br>
train 20 according to the principles of the present invention. The valve train 20<br>
includes a camshaft 22 which is received and supported for rotation in a bore 24<br>
within the engine block 12. In the particular example provided, the cylinders 14<br>
are arranged in a V-type arrangement and the camshaft 22 is located at the<br>
bottom of the "V". However, it should be appreciated that various other cylinder<br>
14 and camshaft 22 arrangements may be employed with the present invention.<br>
[0013]	The valve train 20 also includes a pushrod 26, a rocker arm<br>
assembly 28, and at least one inlet valve 29. The camshaft 22 includes an inlet<br>
cam 30 that engages a hydraulic roller lifter 32 at an end of the pushrod 26. The<br>
pushrod 26 is coupled at an opposite end thereof to the rocker assembly 28. The<br>
rocker assembly 28 is in turn coupled to the inlet valve 29. The inlet valve 29 is<br>
biased by a biasing member 31, illustrated as a spring in the particular example<br>
provided.<br><br>
[0014]	During operation of the valve train 20, rotation of the<br>
camshaft 22 and the inlet cam 30 reciprocates the hydraulic roller lifter 32 and<br>
the pushrod 26. The pushrod 26 then actuates the rocker assembly 28 such that<br>
the rocker assembly 28 oscillates on a supporting shaft 33 about a pivot axis 34.<br>
The pivot axis 34 is parallel to the axis of the camshaft 24. As the rocker<br>
assembly 28 is actuated by the reciprocating pushrod 26, the rocker assembly 28<br>
opens and closes the inlet valve 29. The inlet valve 29 is in communication with<br>
the cylinder 14 and allows air intake into the cylinder 14 as the camshaft 22<br>
rotates and the pushrod 26 reciprocates.<br>
[0015]	An exhaust valve train 36 is also illustrated with the engine<br>
12. The exhaust valve train 36 includes an exhaust pushrod 38 (the top of which<br>
is shown) that is reciprocated by an exhaust cam 40 on the camshaft 22. The<br>
exhaust pushrod 38 in turn oscillates an exhaust rocker arm 42, which<br>
reciprocates an exhaust valve 44. The exhaust valve train 36 operates in a<br>
manner similar to the valve train 20, though the opening and closing of the<br>
exhaust valve 44 is out of synch with the opening and closing of the pair of inlet<br>
valves 29.<br>
[0016]	With reference to FIG. 2, an enlarged view of the pushrod 26<br>
used in the valve train 20 of the present invention is illustrated. As noted above,<br>
the pushrod 26 is coupled to the rocker arm assembly 28 at one end and to the<br>
hydraulic roller lifter 32 at an opposite end. The pushrod 26 is generally<br>
cylindrical and includes a wall 46. The wall 46 includes an inner surface 48 and<br>
an outer surface 50. The inner surface 48 of the wall 46 defines an inner cavity<br><br>
52 used to allow hydraulic fluid to flow from the hydraulic roller lifter 32 to the<br>
rocker arm assembly 28, though it should be appreciated that the pushrod 26<br>
may be solid without departing from the scope of the present invention. The wall<br>
46 has a first thickness, indicated by reference number 54, throughout a first wall<br>
portion 47.<br>
[0017]	The pushrod 26 also includes an overload feature 60. The<br>
overload feature 60 includes a reduction in the thickness of the wall 46 of the<br>
pushrod 26 along a second wall portion 49 of the pushrod 26. Accordingly, the<br>
wall 46 of the overload feature 60 has a second thickness, indicated by reference<br>
number 62, through the second wall portion 49 that is less than the first thickness<br>
54. In this way, the cross-sectional area through the overload feature 60 is less<br>
than the cross-sectional area through the remainder of the pushrod 26. In the<br>
particular example provided, the thickness of the wall 46 is reduced through the<br>
overload feature 60 by removing material from the outer surface 50 of the wall<br>
46. Alternatively, the thickness of the wall 46 may be reduced through the<br>
overload feature 60 by removing material from the inner surface 48 of the wall<br>
46. The overload feature 50 acts as a "fuse" for the valve train 20. More<br>
specifically, the reduced cross-sectional area of the wall 46 at the overload<br>
feature 60 (the second wall portion 49) has a compressive strength less than that<br>
of the wall 46 along the rest of the pushrod 26 (the first wall portion 47).<br>
Accordingly, if the pushrod 26 is subjected to a predefined compressive load or<br>
force that exceeds the strength of the pushrod 26 through the overload feature<br>
60, then the overload feature 60 activates and the pushrod 26 will separate or<br><br>
bend at a point within the overload feature 60. The load or force at the overload<br>
feature 60 that results in activation may be calibrated by adjusting the cross-<br>
sectional area of the wall 46 at the overload feature 60. The overload feature 60<br>
is preferably located proximate to the rocker arm assembly 28 such that during<br>
activation of the overload feature 60, the pushrod 26 may be extracted from the<br>
engine 10 with minimal difficulty.<br>
[0018]	Turning now to FIGS. 3A and 3B, an enlarged view of the<br>
rocker arm assembly 28 used in the valve train 20 is provided. The rocker arm<br>
assembly 28 includes a rocker body 70 having a pair of annular extensions 71<br>
that define a cylindrical bore 72. The cylindrical bore 72 is sized to receive the<br>
supporting shaft 33 therein (FIG. 1). Two lever arms extend from the rocker body<br>
70 and include a first or valve side lever arm 74 and a second or cam side lever<br>
arm 76. The valve side lever arm 74 and the cam side lever arm 76 extend from<br>
opposite sides of the rocker body 70. The valve side lever arm 74 is coupled to<br>
the intake valve 29 (FIG. 1). The cam side lever arm 76 includes a top surface<br>
78 and a bottom surface 80. The pushrod 26 (FIG. 1) is connected to the cam<br>
side lever arm 76 at the bottom surface 80. A fluid port 82 extends through the<br>
cam side lever arm 76 and cooperates with the pushrod 26 to transfer hydraulic<br>
fluid, such as oil, from the hydraulic roller lifter 32 through the pushrod 26 to the<br>
rocker arm assembly 28.<br>
[0019]	The rocker arm assembly 28 further includes an overload<br>
feature 84 located on the cam side lever arm 76. The overload feature 84<br>
includes a circular slot 86 formed in the top surface 78 on the cam side lever arm<br><br>
76. The circular slot 86 encircles the fluid port 82 and is positioned such that the<br>
circular slot 86 is approximately aligned with the end of the pushrod 26 on the<br>
bottom surface 80 of the cam side lever arm 76. A pair of side slots 88A and 88B<br>
extend out from the circular slot 86 on opposite sides. The side slots 88A and<br>
88B are preferably positioned such that they extend along the length of the cam<br>
side lever arm 76. In the particular example provided, the side slot 88A extends<br>
to an end or tip of the cam side lever arm 76 and the side slot 88B extends<br>
towards the rocker body 70. The overload feature 84 acts as a "fuse" for the<br>
valve train 20. More specifically, the slots 86, 88A, and 88B cooperate to reduce<br>
the cross-sectional area of the cam side lever arm 76 thereby reducing the<br>
strength of the cam side lever arm 76 through that cross-sectional area.<br>
Accordingly, if the pushrod 26 is subjected to a predefined compressive load that<br>
exceeds the strength of the cam side lever arm 76 at the overload feature 84,<br>
then the overload feature 84 will activate and the pushrod 26 will punch through<br>
the cam side lever arm 76 near the circular slot 86. The cam side lever arm 76<br>
will also preferably separate or bend between the side slot 88B and the rocker<br>
body 70. During such an activation, the cam side lever arm 76 will grip the<br>
pushrod 26 as the pushrod 26 pushes through the cam side lever arm 76,<br>
thereby preventing the pushrod 26 from coming free within the engine 10. The<br>
depths or sizes of the slots 86, 88A, and 88B into the cam side lever arm 76 may<br>
be sized such that the pushrod 26 will push through the cam side lever arm 76 at<br>
a calibrated, predefined load or force.<br><br>
[0020]	With reference to FIG. 4, an alternate embodiment of the<br>
rocker arm assembly 28 shown in FIG. 3 is illustrated and indicated by reference<br>
number 90. The rocker arm assembly 90 is substantially similar to the rocker<br>
arm assembly 28 and includes a rocker body 92, a pair of annular extensions<br>
94A and 94B that define a cylindrical bore 95, a valve side lever arm 96, and a<br>
cam side lever arm 98. The rocker arm assembly 90 is further illustrated with an<br>
exemplary bearing assembly 100 and an exemplary support shaft 102 located<br>
within the cylindrical bore 95.<br>
[0021]	The rocker arm assembly 90 also includes an overload<br>
feature 104 located on the annular extension 94A. It should be appreciated that<br>
the overload feature 104 may alternatively be located on the annular extension<br>
94B or on both annular extensions 94A and 94B without departing from the<br>
scope of the present invention. The overload feature 104 includes a first slot<br>
106A and a second slot 106B. The slots 106A and 106B are located on opposite<br>
sides of the annular extension 94A. Each slot 106A and 106B extend from an<br>
outer edge 107 of the annular extension 94A radially inward towards the pivot<br>
axis 34. The slots 106A and 106B reduce a wall thickness of the annular<br>
extension 94A a predefined amount. The overload feature 104 acts as a "fuse"<br>
for the valve train 20. More specifically, the reduced cross-sectional area of the<br>
annular extension 94A at the overload feature 104 has a strength less than that<br>
of the rest of the annular extension 94A. Accordingly, if during a mistiming event<br>
the pushrod 26 subjects the rocker arm assembly 90 to a load or force that<br>
exceeds the strength of the annular extension 94A through the overload feature<br><br>
104, then the overload feature 104 will activate and accordingly the annular<br>
extension 94A will separate or bend at a point within the overload feature 104.<br>
The amount of load or force that results in activation at the overload feature 104<br>
may be calibrated by adjusting the depths or sizes of the slots 106A and 106B<br>
which in turn change the cross-sectional area through the annular extension 94A<br>
and therefore the strength through that cross-sectional area. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, the slots 106A and 106B have different depths and sizes such that<br>
the first slot 106A reduces the cross-sectional area or wall thickness of the<br>
annular extension 94A a first amount and the second slot 106B reduces the<br>
cross-sectional area or wall thickness of the annular extension 94A a second<br>
amount that is different than the first amount. Accordingly, the annular extension<br>
94A will separate at one of the slots 106A or 106B before separating at the other.<br>
Therefore, the annular extension 94A will stay attached at whichever of the<br>
cross-sectional areas through the slots 106A or 106B has greater strength. This<br>
feature prevents a portion of the annular extension 94A from coming completely<br>
free of the rocker arm assembly 28 and moving loose within the engine 10.<br>
[0022]	Turning now to FIG. 5, a center bolt used in the rocker arm<br>
assemblies 28 and 90 in FIGS. 3 and 4 is generally indicated by reference<br>
number 110. The center bolt 110 extends through the center shaft 102 (FIG. 4)<br>
and couples the rocker arm assemblies 28 and 90 to the engine 10 (FIG. 1). The<br>
center bolt 110 includes a cylindrical shaft 112 extending between a narrowed tip<br>
portion 114 and a head portion 116. The cylindrical shaft 112 has a first<br>
diameter, indicated by reference number 118.<br><br>
[0023] The center bolt 110 further includes an overload feature 120<br>
located on the cylindrical shaft 112. The overload feature 120 includes a<br>
reduction in the diameter of the cylindrical shaft 112. Accordingly, the cylindrical<br>
shaft 112 through the overload feature 120 has a second diameter, indicated by<br>
reference number 122, that is less than the first diameter 118 such that the<br>
cross-sectional area through the overload feature 120 is less than the cross-<br>
sectional area through the remainder of the cylindrical shaft 112. The overload<br>
feature 120 acts as a "fuse" for the valve train 20. More specifically, the reduced<br>
cross-sectional area of the cylindrical shaft 112 at the overload feature 120 has a<br>
strength less than that along the rest of the cylindrical shaft 112. Accordingly, if<br>
during a mistiming event the pushrod 26 subjects the rocker arm assembly 90<br>
and therefore the center bolt 110 to a load or force that exceeds the strength of<br>
the center bolt 110 through the overload feature 120, then the overload feature is<br>
activated and accordingly the center bolt 110 will break or separate at a point<br>
within the overload feature 120. The amount of load or force that results in<br>
activation at the overload feature 120 may be calibrated by adjusting the cross-<br>
sectional area of the cylindrical shaft 112 at the overload feature 120.<br>
[0024]	Preferably, only one of the overload features 60, 84, 104,<br>
and 120 described throughout the several views will be employed in any given<br>
