PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br>
BACKGROUND<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a mesoporous material, particularly catalytic material, and use of the mesoporous material for the conversion of organic compounds, particularly hydrocarbons.<br>
2.	Background of the Prior Art<br>
Most of today's hydrocarbon processing technologies are based on zeolite catalysts. Zeolite catalysts are well known in the art and possess well-arranged pore systems with uniform pore sizes. However, these materials tend to possess either only micropores or only mesopores. Micropores are defined as pores having a diameter less than about 2 nm. Mesopores are defined as pores having a diameter ranging from about 2 nm to about 50 nm. Because such hydrocarbon processing reactions are mass-transfer limited, a catalyst with an ideal pore size will facilitate transport of the reactants to active catalyst sites and transport the products out of the catalyst. There is yet need for an improved material having functionalized sites within a porous framework for processes directed to the catalytic conversion and/or adsorption of hydrocarbons and other organic compounds. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A process for treating organic compounds is provided herein. The process comprises: (a) providing a composition which includes a substantially mesoporous structure of silica containing at least 97% by volume of pores having a pore size ranging from about 15 A to about 30 A and having a micropore volume of at least about 0.01 cc/g, wherein the mesoporous structure has incorporated therewith at least about 0. 02% by weight of catalytically and/or chemically active heteroatoms selected from the group consisting of Al, Ti, V, Cr, Zn, Fe, Sn, Mo, Ga, Ni, Co, In, Zr, Mn, Cu, Mg, Pd, Pt and W, and wherein said catalyst has an X-ray diffraction pattern with one peak at 0.3° to about 3. 5" at 2 9 ; and, (b) contacting an organic feed under reaction conditions with said catalyst wherein the treating process is selected from the group consisting of alkylation, acylation, oligomerizatjon, selective oxidation, hydrotreating, isomerization, demetalation, catalytic dewaxing, hydroxylation, hydrogenation, ammoximation, isomerization, dehydrogenation, cracking and adsorption. One aspect of this invention deals with an improved catalytic process for the demetalation and desulfurization of petroleum oils, preferably those residual fractions with undesirably high metals and/or sulfur and/or nitrogen contents and/or Conradson Carbon Residue (CCR). More particularly, this invention relates to a hydrotreating process for reducing high metals, sulfur and nitrogen contents and CCR of petroleum oils, again preferably those containing residual hydrocarbon components. Residual petroleum oil fractions are produced by atmospheric or vacuum distillation of crude petroleum; they generally contain high amounts of metals, sulfur, nitrogen and CCR content. This comes about because practically all of the metals and CCR present in the original crude remain in the residual fraction, and a disproportionate amount of sulfur and nitrogen in the original crude oil also remains in that fraction. Principal metal contaminants are nickel and vanadium, with iron and small amounts of copper also sometimes present. The high metals, sulfur, nitrogen, and CCR content of the residual fractions generally limit their effective use as charge stocks for subsequent catalyst processing such as catalytic cracking and hydrocracking. The metal contaminants deposit on the special catalysts for these cracking processes and cause the premature aging of the catalyst and/or unwanted side reactions such as cracking to coke, dry gas and hydrogen. During the FCC process, much of the sulfur ends up in the FCC catalyst's coke, which is burned during regeneration, resulting in substantial SOx emissions. Another major fate of the residua's sulfur is in the final cracked products, such as gasoline and light cycle oil (a blending component for diesel fuel and home heating fuel). Some of the nitrogen contributes to NOx emissions, and some nitrogen (the basic nitrogen compounds) becomes bound to the active sites of the FCC catalyst and renders it ineffective. CCR, a measure of a molecule's tendency to coke rather than crack and/or distill, is also an undesirable property for charge streams processed by catalytic cracking. Under the high temperature employed in catalytic<br><br>
cracking, molecules high in CCR thermally and/or catalytically degrade to coke, light gases, and hydrogen. Catalytic cracking is generally done utilizing hydrocarbon charge stocks lighter than residual fractions, which generally have an API gravity less than 20. The most common, cracking charge stocks are coker and/or crude unit gas oils, vacuum tower overheads, etc., the feedstock having an API gravity from, about 15 to about 45. Since these cracking charge stocks are distillates, they do not contain significant proportions of the large molecules in which the metals are concentrated. Such cracking is commonly earned out in a reactor operated at a temperature of about 425 to 800'C., a pressure of about 1 to 5 atmospheres, and a space velocity of about 1 to 1000 WHSV. Metals and sulfur contaminants would present similar problems in hydrocracking operations that are typically carried out on charge stocks even lighter than those charged to a cracking unit. Typical hydrocracking reactor conditions consist of a temperature of 200 to 550°C and a pressure of 700 to 20,000 kPa. It is evident that there is considerable need for an efficient method to reduce the metals and/or sulfur and/or nitrogen and/or CCR content of hydrocarbons, and particularly of residual petroleum fractions. While the technology to accomplish this for distillate fractions has been advanced considerably, attempts to apply this technology to residual fractions generally fail due to very rapid deactivation of the catalyst, primarily by metals contaminants and coke deposition.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT (S)<br>
The catalyst of the present invention includes a three-dimensional, stable, porous silica, which is substantially mesoporous in structure. The silica possesses a non- crystalline, but regularized (pseudo-crystalline) structure. Mesoporous materials are described in U. S. Patent No. 6, 358,486 Bl, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. The amorphous silica material of the present invention generally contains both mesopores and micropores. Micropores are defined as pores having a diameter of less than about 2 run. Mesopores are defined as pores having a diameter of from about 2 nm to about 50 nm. The inorganic oxide material of the present invention has a volume percentage of mesopores of at least about 97% and preferably at least about 98%. A method for making a preferred porous silica-containing catalyst support is described in<br><br>
U. S. Patent No. 6, 358,486 B 1. The average mesopore size of the preferred catalyst as determined from N2-porosimetry ranges from about 2 nm to about 25 nm. The catalyst includes, and is finctionalized with, one or more catalytically active metal heteroatoms incorporated into the porous silicate structure. The catalytically active metal heteroatom (i. e., non-silicon atom) can be selected from Groups IB, IIB, IIIB, IVB, VB, VIB, VIIB, VIII, IVA, and IIIA of the Periodic Table of the Elements. Suitable metal heteroatoms include aluminum (Al), titanium (Ti), vanadium (V), chromium (Cr), zinc (Zn), iron (Fe), tin (Sn), molybdenum (Mo), gallium (Ga), nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co), indium (In), zirconium (Zr), manganese (Mn), copper (Cu), magnesium (Mg), palladium (Pd), platinum (Pt) and tungsten (W), for example. The incorporated heteroatoms can be isolated and/or distributed as clusters in the porous matrix. They can be in an atomic form or molecular form (e. g., as oxide). The heteroatom content of the catalyst is at least about 0.02% by weight of the catalyst. The atomic ratio of the heteroatoms to silicon atoms in the catalyst can be varied up to about 0.9, preferably from about 0. 0001 to about 0.5. The composition of the present invention has a characteristic X-ray diffraction pattern ("XRD") which shows at least one peak at 0.3° to 3.5° at 2 6, which corresponds to a basal spacing between 25 A and 440 A. Nitrogen adsorption tests reveal a tunable pore size ranging from about 15 A (1.5 nm) to about 300 A (30 nm), and a surface area ranging from about 300 m2/g to about 1,250 m2/g, and a pore volume of from about 0.3 cc/g to about 2.5 cc/g. The composition of the present invention has a three-dimensional, randomly connected mesopore system, which facilitates mass-transfer of reactants and products, and avoids pore blockage. Generally, the mesoporous silica material of the present invention is prepared from a synthesis mixture containing at least one silica source, at least one heteroatom source, and at least one pore-forming organic templating agent. In a first stage of the method for making the catalyst of the invention, the silica source, heteroatom source, and organic templating agent (s) are combined in aqueous solution to form a synthesis mixture (usually a gel). In an intermediate stage of the method, the volatile components of the synthesis mixture (e. g., water, alcohol) are removed by conventional means such as drying with or without forced air flow. The drying can be conducted, for example, at 40°C to about 130°C for up to about 72 hours, more preferably from about 60°C to about 120°C for 6 to 36 hours. In a final stage the organic templating agent (s) are removed by conventional means such as calcining and extraction. Typically, the calcining is performed at a temperature of from about 450°C to about 900°C with an oxygen-containing gas (e. g., air) for 2 to 20 hours, preferably at 540°C to about 700°C for about 4 to 15 hours. The extraction can be done using, organic solvents at a temperature of from about 30°C to about 100°C, depending upon the solvent used. Some alcohols with low or no toxicity are preferable as solvents. Optionally, the method can include aging the synthesis mixture at 10°C for up to 24 hours before removing the volatile components of the synthesis mixture. Optionally, the synthesis mixture can be heated in an autoclave at a temperature of from about 100°C to about 220°C for up to about 10 days, preferably at a temperature of from about 120°C to about 200°C for up to 96 hours, before removing the pore forming agent. The heating step in the autoclave can tune the mesoporosity to meet specific requirements. During the heating, inorganic species such as silicon and aluminum will coalesce to form an inorganic framework, while the pore forming agent, forms aggregates to shape the inorganic framework. The size distribution of the aggregates determines the mesopore size distribution. However, the aggregate size mainly depends on the nature of the pore forming agent, the temperature of heating and the length of the heating time. So for a certain pore-forming agent, the mesoporosity of the final material can be tuned by manipulating the temperature and the heating time. More particularly, in the first stage, the silica source, or silica precursor, can be a silicon compound containing some organic groups. Such compounds can be alkoxides, e. g., tetraethyl orthosilicate ("TEOS"), and silatranes, e. g., triethanolamine-substituted silatranes. The silica source can alternatively be inorganic, such as anhydrous or hydrous silica gels or silica hydrogels. The silica source also can be geothermal silica, but to facilitate reactivity, is preferably not a crystalline source. The organic templating agent preferably contains hydroxy! (-OH) groups that form hydrogen bonds with the inorganic species (i.e., silica and heteroatom). They may have atoms with a pair of electrons that<br><br>
can bond with the silicon or heteroatoms. Such organic templating agents include glycols (e. g., propylene glycol, glycerol, ethylene glycol, triethyiene glycol, tetraethylene glycol), alkanolamines (e. g., triethanolamine ["TEA"], triisopropanolamine), diethylglycol dibenzoate, triethyiene pentamine, starch, and sulfolane. The organic templating agent should have a boiling point above 150"C, preferably above about 180'C. The heteroatom source can be with or without organic groups and is typically added in the form of a solution. For example, in the case of aluminum, the source can be aluminum alkoxide (e. g., aluminum isopropoxide), alumina, aluminum hydroxide, aluminum nitrate, aluminum sulfate, or aluminum chloride. The synthesis mixture can also include alkali or acid to adjust the pH of the mixture. Alkalis typically include organic alkali such as tetraethylammonium hydroxide ("TEAOH") and other tetraalkylammonium hydroxides, urea, and the like, or inorganic alkali such as ammonium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, and the like. The solvents, reaction conditions, the order of adding and mixing components and the pH can depend upon the heteroatom and should be selected to avoid premature separation (e. g., precipitation) of the heteroatom. Premature separation can result in failure of the heteroatom to be incorporated into the silica structure. The composition of the invention can be applied as catalysts, co-catalysts (a part of catalysts), catalyst supports, adsorbents and molecular sieves. Depending on the functionality of the incorporated heteroatoms, the composition can have weak, medium and strong acidity, consequently it can catalyze cracking, isomerization, alkylation, acylation, oligomerization/polymerization, dehydration of organic compounds and desulfurization. The composition can also have redox properties, which can catalyze epoxidation of alkenes (e.g., cyclohexene, octene, ethylene, or propylene), selective oxidation of alkanes (e.g. cyclododecane, cyclohexane), alcohols and amines, hydroxyiation of aromatics and ammoximatjon of ketones. The composition can be used as co-catalysts or catalyst supports. For instance, addition of noble metals, e. g. Pd and/or Pt/to this composition offers functionality of hydrocracking, hydrogenatjon, dehydrogenation, and desulfurization. This composition can also contain all types of zeolites and zeolite-like structures, together with all possible heteroatoms mentioned above. A typical example of the composition of the invention, which offers acidity, is the one containing aluminum and/or gallium. A group of industrially important reactions is- alkylation, which conventionally uses corrosive Lewis acids such as AlCb and HF and generates large amount of wastes. The composition of this invention is environmental friendly and can replace the conventional catalysts. It can catalyze alkane or aromatic alkylation (including Friedel-Crafts alkylation) using olefins, alkyl halides or alcohols as alkylation agents. The aromatic compounds mainly include benzene, naphthalene, phenanthrene and their derivatives, such as toluene, xylene, isopropylnaphthalene, di- phenyl oxide, or 2, 4-di-t-butylphenol. The olefin alkylation agents mainly include alpha- olefins, preferably those with a carbon number more than two, preferably more than four. Suitable olefins include e.g., ethylene, propylene, and 1-hexadecene. Alcohol alkylation agents mainly include methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, benzyl alcohol, and cinnamyl alcohol. The alkylation reaction can be earned out at a temperature of from about 80°C to about 400°C, under a pressure between 1 and 50 bars, preferably from about 90°C to about 300°C and between 1 and 30 bars. Oligomerization and polymerization of olefins can produce fractions for gasoline, jet fuel, diesel fuel and lubricating base oil. The catalyst composition of the invention, especially those containing aluminum, chromium, gallium or iron heteroatoms, can be used as catalysts for oligomerization of olefins such as alpha-olefins with a carbon number larger greater than three. Reaction conditions, depending on the specific feedstocks and desired products, include a temperature ranging from about 25°C to about 300"C, and a pressure ranging from atmospheric pressure to about 70 bars. The catalyst composition of the invention can be used for the selective oxidation of organic compounds. Particularly preferred are those catalyst compositions containing one or more heteroatoms selected from transition metals including, for example, copper, zinc, iron, titanium, chromium, vanadium, molybdenum and tin. For instance, the composition containing titanium, zinc, chromium, iron and manganese can catalyze epoxidation of olefins including aromatics such as phenanthrene, anthracene and trans- stilbene. The oxidants used in this type of reaction include organic or inorganic peroxides, nitrogen oxides, oxygen and any gas<br><br>
mixture containing oxygen. The composition containing copper and zinc is particularly preferred for catalyzing the selective oxidation of alcohols to corresponding aldehydes. HydroxylatJon of phenol and 1-naphthol can be accomplished using the catalyst composition containing tin, iron, copper, cobalt and vanadium. In the prior art, acylation of aromatics was conventionally performed using Lewis acids, such as AlCb, FeCb, H2SO4, etc. which generated a huge amount of wastes. In contrast, the composition of the present invention, especially embodiments that contain aluminum, iron, gallium, indium, etc., replaces the Lewis acids. Acylation agents mainly include acyl halide, carboxyl acid anhydride. The aromatic compounds mainly include benzene, naphthalene, phenanthrene and their derivatives. Acylation can be carried out at a temperature from about 40°C to about 300°C, under a pressure of from about 0.5 bar to about 20 bars, preferably from about 60°C to about 250°C, and a pressure of from about 1 to 15 bars. When incorporated as heteroatoms in the mesoporous silica of the invention, transition metals such as cobalt, nickel, molybdenum, tungsten, or combinations thereof, or noble metals such as platinum, palladium or combinations thereof, provide catalysts particularly suitable for hydrotreating process such as (1) hydrogenation of aromatics in gasoline, jet fuel, diesel fuel and lubricating oil; (2) hydrocracking of heavy fractions such as vacuum gas oil, residuum fractions and liquids derived from coal (coal oil); (3) OCR reduction, denitrogenation, desulfurization, and demetalation of hydrocarbons, including the above-mentioned fractions. Demetalation is particularly useful for the removal of iron, nickel, vanadium, and arsenic. Hydrotreating reaction conditions typically include a reaction temperature ranging from about 40°C to about 400°C, preferably from about 60°C to about 350"C, and a pressure ranging from atmospheric pressure to about 300 bars. Isomerizatjon of hydrocarbons (e. g. n-butane, n-pentane, 1-butene and xylene) can be catalyzed by using the catalyst of the invention. Preferred catalyst compositions for isomerization contain zirconium, tungsten, gallium, iron, titanium and aluminum as heteroatoms. Dehydrogenation of saturated hydrocarbons to unsaturated hydrocarbons can be catalyzed using the composition containing mainly vanadium, iron, gallium, cobalt and chromium. The saturated hydrocarbon can be, for example, propane, isobutane and ethylbenzene. The gas hourly space velocity (6HSV) normally ranges from 100 to 2000 hr1, preferably from 500 to 1000 hr1. The operating pressure normally ranges from about 7 kPa to about 600 kPa, preferably from about 7 kPa to about 400 kPa. The reaction temperature typically ranges from about 350°C to about 650°C, preferably from about 450s C to about 600°C. Hydrocarbon cracking can advantageously be carried out using the inventive catalyst composition containing nickel, tungsten, cobalt, molybdenum, aluminum and/or gallium. Moreover, the catalyst composition of the invention can be used alone or together with zeolites. The hydrocarbon can be feedstock for fluid catalytic cracking, hydrocracking, etc. The catalyst composition can also catalyze the cracking of waste polymers to recover useful fractions of desirable chemicals. The composition can be used as a catalyst for Fischer-Tropsch process. The process involves contacting a feed stream comprising hydrogen and carbon monoxide with the catalyst in a reaction zone maintained at conversion-promoting conditions effective to produce an effluent stream comprising hydrocarbons. The gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) may range from about 100 volumes/hour/volume catalyst (hr1) to about 10,000 hr1, preferably from about 300 hr1 to about 2,000 hr1. The reaction temperature is typically in the range from about IGO'C to about 300oC, preferably from about 190°C to about 260"C. The reaction pressure is typically in the range of about 5 bar to about 60 bar, preferably from 8 bar to about 30 bar. The composition can be used to effectively and selectively adsorb particular compounds. Due to its tunable pores and functionalized pore wall, it allows various compounds to enter the pores and interact with functional heteroatom groups on or in the wall. For instance, the incorporated heteroatoms can have high but unsaturated coordination numbers, which enables the heteroatoms to form coordination bonds with oxygen-containing, nitrogen-containing, and sulfur-containing compounds, thereby effectively removing these compounds from streams. It can also be a base-acid interaction. For example, the composition containing aluminum can remove toxic compounds such as cyanuric acid and p-chlorophenol from streams. As such, the composition can be used as adsorbents and molecular sieves. The invention disclosure presents a new type of mesoporous or meso-<br><br>
microporous silicate containing heteroatoms, having a randomly connected three-dimensional pore structure with tunable pore sizes. It offers a new, cost-effective process to synthesize the mesoporous silicate without any surfactant involved. It provides new diverse catalytic materials. And it provides the processes to apply the composition in catalysis and separation. Various features of the invention are illustrated by the Examples given below. X-ray powder diffraction patterns (XRD) of the resulting materials were recorded using CuKa radiation on a Philips PW1840 diffractometer equipped with a graphite monochromator. The samples were scanned in the range of 0.5-40° 2 0 with steps of 0.02'. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed using a Philips CM30T electron microscope with a LaB6 filament as the source of electrons operated at 300 kV. Nitrogen sorption isotherms were measured on the Quantachrome Autosorb-6B at 77 K. Mesoporosity was calculated using the Barrett, Joyner and Halenda (BHJ) method. All composition parts are by weight unless indicated otherwise. EXAMPLE 1<br>
This example shows how to incorporate aluminum into silica without heating in an autoclave before calcination. First, 1 part aluminum isopropoxide (Al (iso-OC3H6)3) was added into 26 parts of an aqueous solution of tetraethytammonium hydroxide (TEAOH, 35%) while stirring. After dissolution, 38 parts of triethanolamine (TEA) together with 8 parts of water were added into the above solution under stirring. Then, 26 parts of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) were added under vigorous stirring. A clear solution was obtained. The stirring was continued for 1 hour, and then the synthesis mixture was aged at room temperature overnight and dried at 98°C in air for 24 hours. Finally, the synthesis mixture was calcined at 570°C for 10 hours in air with a ramp rate of 1 "C/min, Fig. 1 shows its XRD pattern with an intensive reflection at about 1.1 "in 2 6 indicating the characteristic of a mesoporous material. In addition, the absence of resolved peaks for alumina implies that no bulky alumina phase formed. Fig, 2 presents an image of transmission electron microscopy (TEM), showing a randomly connected mesoporous structure. Elemental analysis showed it to have a Si/AI ratio of about 24.8, which is consistent with the ratio of the initial synthesis mixture of 25. Nitrogen adsorption revealed a surface area of 983 m2/g, a total pore volume of 1.27 cm3/g and a narrow mesopore distribution centered at 4.2 nm, shown in Fig. 3. EXAMPLE 2<br>

EXAMPLE 28<br>
This example demonstrates the preparation of FCC catalyst using the composition of this invention and compares its<br>
cracking results with that of a catalyst using MCM-41. Catalyst preparation was as follows: About 35wt% of the composition<br>
of Example 4 in a silica-alumina-clay matrix was prepared. 130 parts of the composition of Example 4 were ball-milled for 14<br>
hours in 230 ml H2O. The product was rinsed from the mill with 52.5 ml of H2O. A slurry was prepared containing 827 g of<br>
H20,33.5 parts of kaolin clay (Georgia Kaolin Kaopaque), and 175.4 parts of hydrous silica (Philadelphia Quartz N-brand).<br>
The slurry was stirred and 16.4 parts of H2SO4 (96.7%) were added over a 30 minute period. 22.9 Parts of AI2 (S04)3 '16^0<br>
dissolved in 92.2 of H2O were added dropwise. 396 Parts of the ball- milled MCM-41 slurry (11.36% solids) were added to<br>
the silica-alumina-clay slurry, and the mixture was vigorously stirred at 800 rpm for 30 minutes and then filtered. The solid<br>
was re-slurried in H2O and spray dried. The spray-dried product was slurried with H2O and the fines floating on the slurry<br>
were discarded. The remaining solid was exchanged with 1N NH4NO3 (5 cc NtoNOj/g of solid). The solid was washed with<br>
H2O, filtered, and dried in an oven at 120°C. A 50g sample of this material was calcined at 540°C for one hour in N2 and 6<br>
hours in air. The remainder of the oven-dried solid was steamed in 45% H2O at 650°C for 4 hours. Prior to admitting steam<br>
to the reactor, the sample was heated to 650°C in N2. Air was gradually increased over aVA hour period while the N2 flow<br>
rate was increased. After the % hour period steam was admitted for the 4-hour period. For comparison, a FCC catalyst<br>
containing 35wt% MCM-41 was prepared in the same way as described above. The original MCM-41 had a surface area of<br>
980 rrWg, a pore size distribution centered around 2.5 nm, and a pore volume of 0.72 cm3/g. It contained 5.4 wt% AI2O3,<br>
similar to 5.3wL % in the material of Example 4. Properties of the steamed catalysts are shown in Table 11.<br>

A medium pressure hydrocracked bottoms fraction was subjected to catalytic dewaxing and hydroprocessing. The feed was processed in cascade operation over fixed bed reactors. Eighty grams of HZSM-5 dewaxing catalyst was loaded into a first reactor and 240 g of the invention catalyst as described in Example 19 was loaded into the second reactor. The feed is passed over both catalysts at 175 bar, 1.0 LHSV over the dewaxing catalyst, 0.33 LHSV over the hydroprocessing catalyst. The temperature in the first reactor was maintained at 307-321 "C to give a target pour point of -6.6*0. The properties of the bottoms fraction are described below in Table 14.<br><br><br>

UV absorbance of the product was used to determine the aromatics in the lubricant base stock. The absorbance at 226 nm<br>
is a measure of the total aromatics while the absorbance at 400 nm (x 103) is a measure of the polynudear aromatics. For<br>
comparative purposes over Pd/MCM-41, catalysts prepared in accordance with the procedure described in Example 19<br>
were also tested. The results of the runs are summarized in the following Table 15.<br>

it is apparent that the composition of this invention is much more effective in saturating aromatics.<br>
EXAMPLE 30<br>
This example demonstrates using the composition of the invention as a catalyst for hydrotreating of a coal liquid. While the<br>
specific coal-derived liquid exemplified here is a liquefaction product of the H-Coal process (using Illinois No. 6 coal as the<br>
starting material), other coal liquids (e. g. coal tar extracts, solvent refined coal, etc.) can be similarly upgraded. The catalyst<br>
sample was made in the same way as described in Example 3A. However, the method included hydrotherma! treatment in<br>
an autoclave at 190"C for a relatively short period of time of 4 days. Nitrogen adsorption showed mesopores with a size<br>
centered at 11 nm with a surface area of about 630 m2/g. Elemental analysis showed a Si/AI atomic ratio of about 99.6. The<br>
material is further impregnated with an ammonium heptamolybdate solution. Particularly, 45.12 parts of an aqueous solution<br>
containing 6.38 parts of ammonium heptamolybdate is added to 40 parts of the above material. The resulting wet material<br>
was dried at 120° C and calcined in air at 538°C under conditions sufficient to decompose ammonium heptamolybdate and<br>
generate M0O3, thereby producing a molybdenum impregnated material. The molybdenum-impregnated material is then<br>
impregnated with a nickel nitrate solution. Particularly, 48.2 parts of an aqueous solution containing 9.3 parts of Ni (NO3)<br>
2-6h20 is added to the molybdenum-impregnated material. The resulting wet material is dried at 121°C and then calcined in<br>
air at 538°C to decompose nickel nitrate and generate NiO, thereby producing a nickel and molybdenum impregnated<br><br>
material. Elemental analysis shows that the final material contains 15.0 wt% of M0O3 and 6.4 wt% of NiO. For comparison, an MCM-41 material is used, which has a surface area of 992 m2/g, a pore size distribution centered at 3.5 nm, and a pore volume of 0.72 cm3/g. It is impregnated in the same way as described above and finally contains 15.2 W t% of M0O3 and 6.7 wt% of NiO. Their activities for hydrotreating are evaluated using Illinois H-coal as feedstock.

These two catalysts are presulfided for a period of 1 hour in a 500 cm3/min flow of 10% H2S in H2 at 230"C and a total pressure of 680 kPa.

The catalyst of this invention shows much higher activity, which partially should be attributed to its unique pore structure. It<br>
has relatively large pores with three- dimensional connection, which can accommodate and transport large molecules such<br>
as present in coal liquids.<br>
EXAMPLE 31<br>
This Example demonstrates the preparation of Fischer-Tropsch catalyst and its catalytic performance. Twenty (20) parts of<br>
Al-containing material made in Example 1 is dried at 200°C for half an hour under N2 flow. It is then mixed thoroughly with 2<br>
parts of C02 (CO) 8 in a glove box. This mixture of solids is placed into a tube furnace boat in a sealed tube and removed<br>
from the glove box. Then it is heated in flowing helium at 100°C for 15 minutes, raised to 200"C over 10 minutes, then<br>
heated at 200"C in helium for half an hour. The final catalyst contains 16 wt. % Co. The above catalyst is treated with<br>
hydrogen prior to test. It is placed in a small quartz crucible in a chamber and purged with nitrogen at 8. 5 x 106 Nm3/s at<br>
room temperature for 15 minutes. It is then heated at 1 "C/min to 100°C under flowing hydrogen at 1.8 X 10* NnWs and<br>
held at 100°C for one hour. It is then heated at 1 "C/min to 400"C and held at 400"C for four hours under flowing hydrogen<br>
at 1.8 X10* NnWs. The catalyst is cooled in hydrogen and purged with nitrogen before use. A pressure vessel containing<br><br>
the catalyst and n-octane is heated at 225°C under 69 bar of H2: CO (2:1) and held at that temperature and pressure for 1 hour. The reactor vessel is cooled in ice, vented, and an internal standard of di-n-butylether is added. Hydrocarbons in the range of Cn-C« are analyzed relative to the internal standard by GC. A C»+ Productivity (g Cuiiour/kg catalyst) is calculated to be 234 based on the integrated production of the Cu- C« hydrocarbons per kg of catalyst per hour. The logarithm of the weight fraction for each carbon number In (Wn/n) is plotted as the ordinate vs. number of carbon atoms in (Wn/n) as the abscissa. From the slope, a value of alpha is obtained to be 0.87, While the above description contains many specifics, these specifics should not be construed as limitations on the scope of the invention, but merely as exemplifications of preferred embodiments thereof. Those skilled in the art will envision many other possibilities within the scope and spirit of the invention as defined by the claims appended hereto.<br><br>
