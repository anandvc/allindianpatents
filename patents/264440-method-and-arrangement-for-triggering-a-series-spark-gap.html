METHOD AND ARRANGEMENT FOR TRIGGERING A SERIES SPARK GAP<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The invention relates to a method for triggering a series<br>
spark gap, in which there are in series at least two partial spark gaps, and<br>
supply voltage is distributed over the partial spark gaps by means of first volt-<br>
age distribution means.<br>
[0002] The invention also relates to an arrangement for triggering a<br>
series spark gap, the series spark gap comprising at least two partial spark<br>
gaps in series, and the arrangement comprising first voltage distribution means<br>
for distributing supply voltage over the partial spark gaps.<br>
[0003] For instance, in connection with high-voltage lines there are<br>
employed series capacitor batteries to compensate for line inductance. In par-<br>
allel with the capacitor battery, in protection thereof, there is generally coupled<br>
a metal oxide varistor and/or a spark gap. The current-voltage characteristic of<br>
the metal oxide varistor is highly non-linear and as battery current rises, the<br>
metal oxide varistor limits capacitor voltage. A typical limiting voltage UKm is<br>
2.3 pu = 2.3 Un, i.e. 2.3 times the nominal capacitor voltage (case-specifically<br>
the voltage may also be selected to be something else). This voltage passes<br>
over the capacitor with the maximum short-circuit current of the line. In a line<br>
short circuit the metal oxide varistor protects the capacitor by limiting its volt-<br>
age to the value 2.3 pu. Thus, some of the current in the line passes through<br>
the metal oxide varistor that gets warm. In parallel with the capacitor and the<br>
metal oxide varistor there is coupled a so-called forced-triggered spark gap<br>
that is ignited if the varistor heats excessively.. If the short circuit occurs in the<br>
same line sector where the series capacitor is located, forced-triggering of the<br>
spark gap is always attempted. Due to spark gap settings the typical lowest<br>
voltage at which the forced-triggering of the spark gap will succeed is about 2<br>
pu using the conventional technology.<br>
[0004] In a line short circuit line breakers switch the current off. If<br>
the line short circuit current is low, the varistor voltage does not always rise to<br>
the value 2 pu or higher. In that case the forced-triggering of the spark gap will<br>
not succeed. In case the capacitor battery has not been bypassed with a spark<br>
gap prior to opening the line breakers, a transient recovery voltage TRV of the<br>
line breakers rises. Therefore it is necessary for the forced-triggering of the<br><br>
2<br>
spark gap to succeed with lower line current and capacitor voltage than 2 pu. A<br>
typical empirical requirement is about 1.7 to 1.8 pu.<br>
[0005] SE publication 8 205 236 discloses an arrangement for<br>
forced triggering of a spark gap. The arrangement employs a separate pulse<br>
transformer that feeds a high-voltage pulse igniting the spark gap. By means of<br>
the high-voltage pulse there is ignited one of the auxiliary spark gaps arranged<br>
in parallel with the main spark gap, whereby these auxiliary spark gaps will be<br>
ignited eventually triggering the main spark gaps. It is necessary, however, to<br>
synchronize the ignition pulse with spark "gap voltage so as to enable forced<br>
triggering. The synchronization and generation of energy needed by a high-<br>
voltage pulse and supply thereof to the pulse transformer require suitable<br>
means. These means make the structure of the forced-triggering device com-<br>
plicated, increase its costs and liability to damage and thus undermine the<br>
overall reliability of the forced-triggering device.<br>
[0006] Fl patent 80812 discloses an arrangement for forced-<br>
triggering a spark gap with voltage lower than autoignition. The spark gap is<br>
divided into at least two partial spark gaps in series. In parallel with the partial<br>
spark gaps there are coupled capacitors to provide mutual voltage distribution<br>
of the partial spark gaps. In series with the capacitors there is arranged a<br>
member controllably adopting a low impedance or high impedance state. On<br>
shifting to the high impedance state said member changes the mutual voltage<br>
distribution of the spark gaps such that the partial spark gap in parallel<br>
therewith ignites. The member adopting a high impedance or a low impedance<br>
state is a transformer, for instance. Strength of said member leaves a great<br>
deal to be desired. Moreover, the arrangement does not necessarily operate<br>
sufficiently fast. -<br>
[0007] There is further known an arrangement according to Figure 1<br>
for triggering a series spark gap. In the solution of Figure 1 the main spark gap<br>
is divided into two partial spark gaps in series, i.e. a first partial spark gap 1<br>
and a second partial spark gap 2. In parallel with the first partial spark gap 1<br>
there are coupled capacitors Ca and Cb. In parallel with the second partial<br>
spark gap 2 there is coupled a capacitor Cc. The capacitors Ca, Cb and Cc are<br>
designed such that in a normal situation they distribute the voltage such that<br>
there is an equal voltage over both partial spark gaps 1 and 2. In parallel with<br>
the capacitor Cc there is coupled a first auxiliary spark gap 3. In series with the<br>
first auxiliary spark gap 3 there is coupled a first current limiting resistor R1. In<br><br>
3<br>
parallel with the capacitor Cb there is coupled a second auxiliary spark gap 4<br>
and in series therewith there is coupled a second current limiting resistor R2.<br>
The auxiliary spark gaps 3 and 4 are gas-pressure spark gaps, i.e. trigatrons.<br>
They are hermetically closed, and therefore their autoignition voltage is con-<br>
stant, in principle. There is, however, a slight spread in their ignition voltage,<br>
and thus, to be on the safe side, their autoignition voltage is set to a value that<br>
is about 10 % higher than the highest voltage over them, which is 2.3 pu/4 =<br>
0.575. In said example the setting is thus 1,1 * 2.3/4 = 0.633 pu. When the se-<br>
ries spark gap is to be triggered, the procedure is as follows. A trigger pulse is<br>
fed to the first auxiliary spark gap. This provokes ignition in the first spark gap,<br>
and consequently the capacitor Ca is discharged through the current limiting<br>
resistor R1. The voltage is then distributed such that one third of the voltage<br>
acting over the whole arrangement acts over the capacitor Cb and thus over<br>
the second auxiliary spark gap 4.<br>
[0008] Autoignition voltage of the second auxiliary spark gap is set<br>
to value 1.1 * 2.3 /4 = 0.633 pu. This voltage passes over said second auxiliary<br>
spark gap if the voltage acting over the whole spark gap is 3 * 0.633 pu = 1.9<br>
pu. In view of the tolerance of the auxiliary spark gap the required voltage over<br>
the whole spark gap is 2 pu.<br>
[0009] In series with the current limiting resistor R1 there is a trans-<br>
former 5 that gives a trigger pulse to the second auxiliary spark gap 4. The trig-<br>
ger pulse expedites ignition, but does not necessarily decrease the ignition<br>
voltage, because the trigger pulse has very short duration. When the second<br>
auxiliary spark gap 4 ignites, the capacitor Cb discharges through the resis-<br>
tance R2. This results in the whole voltage acting over the second partial spark<br>
gap that will ignite. Thereafter the first partial spark gap will also ignite.<br>
[0010] Autoignition of the auxiliary spark gaps 3 and 4 may not be<br>
set excessively low so that they would not ignite on their own without forced<br>
triggering. As described above, the whole spark gap will be ignited at voltage<br>
2.0 pu, if the limiting voltage of the varistor is 2.3 pu. In all cases the value 2.0<br>
pu is not sufficiently low, however. The arrangement is also relatively compli-<br>
cated and consequently expensive.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0011] The object of the present invention is to provide a method<br>
and an arrangement of a novel type for triggering a series spark gap.<br><br>
4<br>
[0012] The method of the invention is characterized by arranging an<br>
additional electrode in at least one partial spark gap between main electrodes<br>
thereof, setting voltage of the additional electrode to a given level by means of<br>
second voltage distribution means, arranging the capacity of the second volt-<br>
age distribution means to be lower than the capacity of the first voltage distri-<br>
bution means and triggering the series spark gap by disturbing voltage distribu-<br>
tion of the second voltage distribution means, whereby the spark gap between<br>
the main electrode of the partial spark gap and the additional electrode will ig-<br>
nite, and consequently the voltage determined by the first voltage distribution<br>
means acts over the spark gap that is between the additional electrode and the<br>
second main electrode of the partial spark gap and that will also ignite, which<br>
further leads to the fact that supply voltage only acts over the second partial<br>
spark gap, and consequently a spark-over also occurs therein.<br>
[0013] The arrangement of the invention is further characterized by<br>
comprising an additional electrode arranged in at least one partial spark gap<br>
between main electrodes thereof, second voltage distribution means for setting<br>
voltage of the additional electrode to a given level, the capacity of the second<br>
voltage distribution means being lower than the capacity of the first voltage<br>
distribution means, and means for disturbing voltage distribution of the second<br>
voltage distribution means.<br>
[0014] The basic idea of the invention is that the arrangement com-<br>
prises at least two partial spark gaps in series. In parallel with the partial spark<br>
gaps there are coupled first voltage distribution means. In at least one partial<br>
spark gap there is arranged an additional electrode whose voltage is set to a<br>
given level by means of second voltage distribution means. The voltage level<br>
of the additional electrode is changed by disturbing the voltage distribution of<br>
the second voltage distribution means. Thus the spark gap between the elec-<br>
trode of the partial spark gap and the additional electrode will be ignited. The<br>
capacity of the second voltage distribution means is clearly lower than the ca-<br>
pacity of the first voltage distribution means and consequently the voltage act-<br>
ing over the first voltage distribution means will not change significantly. So,<br>
the voltage determined by the first voltage distribution means only acts over<br>
the spark gap which is between the second additional electrode and the elec-<br>
trode of the partial spark gap and which will also ignite. This leads further to<br>
the whole supply voltage acting over the second partial spark gap alone,<br>
whereby a spark-over also occurs therein. The disclosed solution permits igni-<br><br>
' 5<br>
tion of the partial spark gaps with voltage that is considerably lower than their<br>
autoignition voltage. Consequently it is possible to protect other components<br>
very efficiently and reliably with the spark gap. The basic idea of one embodi-<br>
ment is that voltage distribution of voltage distribution means is disturbed by<br>
short-circuiting a gap between poles of one voltage distribution means in the<br>
second voltage distribution means, for instance, by means of a gas-pressure<br>
spark gap, i.e. a trigatron. The basic idea of a second embodiment is that volt-<br>
age distribution of others is disturbed by feeding a current pulse by means of a<br>
pufse transformer. This leads to a change in the voltage of the additional elec-<br>
trode and further to a spark-over.<br>

[0016] For the sake of clarity the invention is shown in a simplified<br>
manner in the figures. Like reference numerals refer to like parts in the figures.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION-OF SOME EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0017] Figure 2 shows a solution, in which a main spark gap is di-<br>
vided into two partial spark gaps in series, i.e. into a first partial spark gap 1<br>
and a second partial spark gap 2. In parallel with the first partial spark gap<br>
there is coupled a capacitor C1. In parallel with the second partial spark gap<br>
there is coupled a capacitor C2. These so-called first capacitors C1 and C2 are<br>
designed in this example such that in a normal situation they distribute the<br>
voltage in equal amounts over each one of the partial spark gaps 1 and 2.<br>
[0018] In the first partial spark gap 1 there are main electrodes 6a<br>
and 6b in a manner known per se. Correspondingly, in the second partial spark<br>
gap 2 there are main electrodes 7a and 7b. Further, the first partial spark gap 1<br><br>
6<br>
is arranged in a housing 8.The second partial spark gap 2 is also arranged in a<br>
housing 9 in a manner known per se.<br>
[0019] Apart from the main electrodes 6a and 6b there is an addi-<br>
tional electrode 10 in the first partial spark gap 1. The distance between the<br>
main electrode 6a and the additional electrode 10 is shorter than the distance<br>
between the main electrodes 6a and 6b. Preferably the additional electrode 10<br>
is arranged such that its distance from the main electrodes 6a and 6b is about<br>
half, or less, of the distance between the main electrodes 6a and 6b. The ar-<br>
rangement further comprises-second capacitors C3'and C4, by which the volt-<br>
age of the additional electrode 10 is set to a desired level in a normal situation.<br>
The structure constituted by the main electrodes 6a and 6b and the additional<br>
electrode 10 may be symmetrical, and consequently the second capacitors C3<br>
and C4 are equal. The second capacitors C3 and C4 maintain the voltage of<br>
the additional electrode 10 halfway between the voltages of the main elec-<br>
trodes 6a and 6b such that the electric field strength between the main elec-<br>
trode 6a and the additional electrode 10 is equal to that between the main<br>
electrode 6b and the additional electrode 10. If the structure is not symmetrical,<br>
i.e. said gaps are not equal, the values of the capacitors C3 and C4 are de-<br>
signed such that the field strength is equal in both gaps.<br>
[0020] Typically the distances between the first partial spark gap 1<br>
and the second partial spark gap are farmed such that the field strengths are<br>
equal. The first capacitors C1 and C2 are typically equal in size, whereby the<br>
voltage is distributed evenly between each partial spark gap 1 and 2 in a nor-<br>
mal situation. Even in this case, if the partial spark gaps 1 and 2 are formed<br>
different, the capacitances of capacitors C1 and C2 are designed such that the<br>
field strength in each partial spark gap 1 and 2 is equal.<br>
[0021] The spark gaps are designed to endure normal operating<br>
voltage. Typically the spark gaps are designed such that autoignition of the<br>
partial spark gaps 1 and 2 occurs, for instance, the voltage being 75% of the<br>
supply voltage Unm to which the metal oxide varistor limits the voltage. Typi-<br>
cally this voltage U|jm = 2.3 x UN, where UN is the nominal voltage.<br>
[0022] The series spark gap shown in Figure 2 allows forced trigger-<br>
ing with a voltage lower than the above-mentioned autoignition voltage such<br>
that voltage distribution provided by the second capacitors C3 and C4, i.e. the<br>
voltage level of the additional electrode 10, is disturbed sufficiently. In the case<br>
of Figure 2 the voltage distribution is disturbed by means of an auxiliary spark<br><br>
7<br>
gap 3. The auxiliary spark gap 3 is a gas-pressure spark gap, i.e. a trigatron.<br>
By means of the auxiliary spark gap 3 the spark gap between the main elec-<br>
trode 6a and the additional electrode 10 and the capacitor C3 in parallel<br>
therewith are thus short-circuited. For instance, an ignition coil or a semi-<br>
conductor switch may be used for triggering the auxiliary spark gap 3 in a<br>
manner known per se. The current limiting resistor R1 that is in series with the<br>
auxiliary spark gap 3 limits the current passing through the auxiliary spark gap<br>
3.<br>
[0023] When the auxiliary spark gap 3 has been triggered, the ca-<br>
pacitor C3 will discharge. Further, the voltage level of the additional electrode<br>
10 decreases and part of the supply voltage U determined by the capacitor C1<br>
acts over the additional electrode 10 and the main electrode 6b. In a symmetri-<br>
cal case said voltage is thus about half of the supply voltage U. Thus a spark-<br>
over occurs between the main electrode 6b and the additional electrode 10.<br>
The capacitor C4 in parallel with said spark gap then discharges. The capaci-<br>
tances of the capacitors C3 and C4 are significantly lower than that of the ca-<br>
pacitor C1. So the voltage over the capacitor C1 does not reduce considerably.<br>
Said voltage acts now between the additional electrode 10 and the main elec-<br>
trode 6a, whereby a spark-over also occurs in said spark gap. This in turn will<br>
result in the supply voltage U acting almost completely over the second spark<br>
gap 2, whereby a spark-over will also occur therein.<br>
[0024] Thus, the operation of the arrangement requires that the ca-<br>
pacitance in series connection of the capacitors C3 and C4 be lower than that<br>
of the capacitor C1. Preferably the capacitance of the capacitor C1 is more<br>
than twice higher than the capacitance in series connection of the capacitors<br>
C3 and C4. According to a preferred embodiment the capacitance of the ca-<br>
pacitor C1 is more than five times higher than that in series connection of the<br>
capacitors C3 and C4. Particularly preferably the capacitance of the capacitor<br>
C1 is more than ten times higher than that in series connection of the capaci-<br>
tors C3 and C4.<br>
[0025] It may be mentioned in some numerical values that the<br>
nominal value UN of the supply voltage U may be, for instance, in the order of<br>
40 kilovolts. The capacitance of the capacitors C1 and C2 may be 1.5 nano-<br>
farad, for instance, and the capacitance of the capacitors C3 and C4 may then<br>
be less than 1 nanofarad, for instance. The distance between the main eiec-<br><br>
8<br>
trades 6a and 6b and the distance between the main electrodes 7a and 7b<br>
may be in the order of 15 to 20 mm, for instance.<br>
[0026] Voltage distribution of the capacitors C3 and C4 may also be<br>
disturbed without the auxiliary spark gap 3. One solution of this kind is shown<br>
in Figure 3. The solution of Figure 3 corresponds mainly to that of Figure 2, but<br>
instead of the auxiliary spark gap 3, a pulse transformer 11, for instance a<br>
Tesla transformer, is employed for disturbing the voltage distribution. The<br>
pulse transformer 11 is coupled in series with the capacitor C3. A trigger pulse<br>
is fed to a primary of'the pulse transformer 11. To generate a trigger pulse for<br>
the primary it is possible to use an ignition coil or a semi-conductor switch, for<br>
instance, in a manner known per se. When the trigger pulse is fed to the pulse<br>
transformer 11, it produces a high-voltage pulse whose voltage is distributed to<br>
the capacitors C3 and C4. Because in parallel with these capacitors C3 and C4<br>
there is a considerably greater capacitor C1, the voltage between the elec-<br>
trodes 6a and 6b will not change considerably, however. Disturbance of volt-<br>
age distribution caused by the pulse transformer 11 results in triggering either<br>
the spark gap 6a - 10 or the spark gap 6b - 10, depending on the polarities of<br>
the momentary values of the pulse and the alternating voltage. The capacitor<br>
C3 or C4 in parallel with the spark gap that sparked over will discharge. Thus,<br>
because the capacitance in series connection of the capacitors C3 and C4 is<br>
lower than that of the capacitor C1, the voltage acting over the capacitor C1<br>
does not decrease substantially. Said voltage thus acts over the spark gap that<br>
is between the additional electrode 10 and the main electrode 6a or 6b and<br>
that will also spark over. Further, as described in connection with Figure 2,<br>
subsequently a spark-over will occur over the main electrodes 7a and 7b of the<br>
partial spark gap 2.<br>
[0027] Voltage level of the additional electrode 10 may also be<br>
changed by arranging the pulse transformer 11 between the midpoint of the<br>
capacitors and the additional electrode 10 as shown in Figure 4. An advantage<br>
with this coupling is a lower voltage stress of the capacitors C3 and C4. The<br>
primary of the pulse transformer 11 may be against the ground, or it may be<br>
coupled to the midpoint of the capacitors as in Figure 4. In the latter case the<br>
energy required for triggering the primary may be generated by utilizing auxil-<br>
iary capacitors C5 and C6, a diode D1 and a switch K1 in accordance with<br>
Figure 4.<br><br>
9<br>
[0028] The autoignition voltage of the spark gap depends on ambi-<br>
ent conditions, such as temperature and air humidity. Thus, in practice, the<br>
autoignition voltage of the spark gap is not set so low as it could be set in the-<br>
ory. The autoignition voltage of the spark gap shall be higher than the one to<br>
which the metal oxide varistor limits the voltage. Typically this voltage, i.e. U|jm,<br>
is 2.3 x nominal voltage UN. Notation 2.3 pu (per unit) may also be used. In<br>
theory, the autoignition voltage of one spark gap 1 or 2 shall thus be higher<br>
than 0.5 x 2.3 pu. However, in order to prevent autoignition from occurring at<br>
an excessively low voltage, it was found" that aufoignition of the partial spark<br>
gap 1 and 2 occurring with value 0.75 x Urm would provide a good safety fac-<br>
tor/margin. In the presented solution the magnitude of a lower limit for the<br>
forced triggering, i.e. successful forced triggering, is determined by autoignition<br>
voltages of the partial spark gaps 1 and 2. Air temperature and air pressure are<br>
also to be considered. If the autoignition voltages of the partial spark gaps are<br>
set to value 0.75 x Uiim, forced triggering of the series spark gap will still suc-<br>
ceed the voltage being 1.73 pu, if U|jm is 2.3 pu.<br>
[0029] In some cases features set forth in the present document<br>
may be used as such, irrespective of other features. On the other hand, fea-<br>
tures set forth in the present document may be combined to provide various<br>
combinations.<br>
[0030] The drawings and the relating description are only intended<br>
to illustrate the inventive idea. The details of the invention may vary within the<br>
scope of the claims. Consequently, the series spark gap may comprise two<br>
partial spark gaps in series as shown in the attached figures, or there may be a<br>
plurality of partial spark gaps in series. Instead of capacitors, the voltage distri-<br>
bution means may be, for instance, resistances or other adequate voltage dis-<br>
tribution means. It is preferable, however, to use capacitors as the voltage dis-<br>
tribution means, because their structure is relatively simple and additionally the<br>
switching can utilize their ability to store energy. Naturally one capacitor may<br>
be replaced by coupling a plurality of capacitors in parallel or in series in a cor-<br>
responding manner.<br><br>

WE CLAIM:<br>
1. A method for triggering a series spark gap; in which there are in series at least two partial<br>
spark gaps (1,2), and supply voltage (U) is distributed over the partial spark gaps (1, 2) by means<br>
of first capacitors means (CI, C2), characterized by arranging an additional electrode<br>
(10) in at least one partial spark gap (1) between main electrodes (6a, 6b) thereof, setting voltage<br>
of the additional electrode (10) to a given level by means of second capacitors (C3, C4),<br>
arranging the capacitance of the second capacitors (C3, C4) to be lower than the capacitance of<br>
the first capacitors (CI, C2) and triggering the series spark gap by disturbing the voltage<br>
distribution of the second capacitors (C3, C4), whereby the spark gap "between the main electrode<br>
(6a) of the partial spark gap (1) and the additional electrode (10) will ignite, and consequently the<br>
voltage determined by the first capacitors (CI, C2) acts over the spark gap that is between the<br>
additional electrode (10) and the second main electrode (6b) of the partial spark gap (1) and that<br>
will also ignite, which further-leads to the fact that supply voltage (U) acts over the second partial<br>
spark gap (2) alone, and consequently a spark-over also occurs therein.<br>
2.	The method of claim 1,characterized in that disturbance of voltage distribution is<br>
carried out by short-circuiting the spark gap between the additional electrode (10) and the main<br>
electrode (6a, 6b).<br>
3.	The method of claim 2, characterized in that the short-circuit is implemented by<br>
means of a trigatron (3);<br>
4.	The method of claim ^characterized in that the disturbance of the voltage<br>
distribution is carried out by means of a pulse transformer (11).<br>
5.	The method of any one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the capacitance<br>
of the first capacitors (CI, C2) is more than twice higher than the capacitance in series<br>
connection of the second capacitors (C3, C4).<br>
6.	The method of any one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the capacitance<br>
of the first capacitors (CI, C2) is more than five times higher than the capacitance in series<br>
connection of the second capacitors (C3, C4).<br>
7.	An arrangement for triggering a series spark gap, which series spark gap comprises at least two<br>
partial spark gaps (1, 2) in series, and which arrangement comprises first capacitors (CI, C2) for<br>
distributing supply voltage (U) over the partial spark gaps (1,2), characterized by<br>
comprising an additional electrode (10) arranged in at least one partial spark gap (1) between<br>
main electrodes (6a, 6b) thereof, second capacitors (C3, C4) for setting voltage of the additional<br>
electrode (10) to a given level, the capacitance of the second capacitors (C3, C4) being lower<br>
than the capacitance of the first capacitors (CI, C2), and means for disturbing voltage<br>
distribution of the second capacitors (C3, C4).<br><br>
-11 -<br>
8.	The arrangement of claim 7, characterized by comprising means for short-circuiting<br>
the spark gap between the additional electrode (10) and the main electrode (6a, 6b).<br>
9.	The arrangement of claim 8, characterized in that the means for short-circuiting the<br>
spark gap between the additional electrode (10) and the main electrode (6a, 6b) is a trigatron (3).<br>
10.	The arrangement of claim 7, c h a r a c t e r i z e d by comprising a pulse transformer (11)<br>
for feeding a current pulse to disturb the voltage distribution of the second voltage distribution-<br>
means.<br>
11.	The arrangement of any one of the claims 7 to 10, characterized in that the<br>
capacitance of the first capacitors (CI, C2) is more than twice higher than the capacitance in<br>
series connection of the second capacitors (C3, C4).<br>
12.	The arrangement of any one of the claims 7 to 10, characterized in that the<br>
capacitance of the first capacitors (CI, C2) is more than five times higher than the capacitance in<br>
series connection of the second capacitors (C3, C4).<br><br>
A series spark gap is triggered such that in parallel with partial spark gaps (1 , 2) of the series spark gap there are<br>
coupled first voltage distribution means. Further, at least in one partial spark gap (1 , 2) there is arranged an additional electrode (10)<br>
whose voltage is set to a given level by means of second voltage distribution means. The voltage level of the additional electrode<br>
(10) is changed by disturbing the voltage distribution of the second voltage distribution means. Thus the spark gap between the<br>
main electrode (6a, 6b) of the partial spark gap (1) and the additional electrode (10) will be ignited. Capacity of the second voltage<br>
distribution means is lower than that of the first voltage distribution means and consequently the voltage acting over the first voltage<br>
distribution means does not change significantly. Thus the voltage determined by the first voltage distribution means acts over the<br>
spark gap that is between the additional electrode (10) and the second main electrode (6a, 6b) of the partial spark gap (1) and that will<br>
also ignite, which further results in the supply voltage (U) acting only over the second partial spark gap (2), whereby a spark-over<br>
will also occur therein.</td>
