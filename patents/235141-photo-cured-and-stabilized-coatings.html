PHOTO-CURED AND STABILIZED COATINGS<br>
The present invention is aimed at a process for photo-curing coating formulations, which comprise durable and/or red-shifted reactable hydroxyphenylbenzotriazole ultraviolet light absorbers.<br>
Durable and/or red-shifted hydroxyphenylbenzotriazoles are disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5,977,219. Solar control films comprising durable and/or red-shifted hydroxyphenylbenzotriazoles are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,187,845 and 6,191,199.<br>
Surprisingly, photo-curable coating formulations that comprise durable and/or red-shifted reactable hydroxyphenylbenzotriazole UV absorbers are effectively photo-cured by employing a combination of a-hydroxy ketone and bisacylphosphine oxide photoinitiators. This is surprising since UV absorbers block light that is required for light curing. This is especially surprising for highly effective UV absorbers such as the present hydroxyphenylbenzotriazoles since they absorb more UV light by virtue of being red-shifted.<br>
An object of this invention is to provide for protective thin photo-cured coatings, which comprise high performance durable and/or red-shifted hydroxyphenylbenzotriazole ultraviolet light absorbers (UVA's) that are reacted into the coating.<br>

The polyols may be esterified partially or completely with one or with different unsaturated carboxylic acids, in which case the free hydroxyl groups of the partial esters may be modified, for example etherified, or esterified with other carboxylic acids.<br>
Illustrative examples of esters are: Trimethylolpropane triacrylate, trimethylolethane triacrylate, trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate, trimethylolethane trimethacrylate, tetramethylene glycol dimethacrylate, triethylene glycol dimethacrylate, tetraethylene glycol diacrylate, pentaerythritol diacrylate, pentaerythritol triacrylate, pentaerythritol tetraacrylate, dipentaerythritol diacrylate, dipentaerythritol triacrylate, dipentaerythritol tetraacrylate, dipentaerythritol pentacrylate, dipentaerythritol hexacrylate, tripentaerythritol octacrylate, pentaerythritol dimethacrylate, pentaerythritol trimethacrylate, dipentaerythritol dimethacrylate, dipentaerythritol tetramethacrylate, tripentaerythritol octamethacrylate, pentaerythritol diitaconate, dipentaerythritol trisitaconate, dipentaerythritol pentaitaconate, dipentaerythritol hexaitaconate, ethylene glycol diacrylate, 1,3-butanediol diacrylate, 1,3-butanediol dimethacrylate, 1,4-butanediol diitaconate, sorbitol triacrylate, sorbitol tetraacrylate, pentaerythritol-modified triacrylate, sorbitol tetramethacrylate, sorbitol pentacrylate, sorbitol hexacrylate, oligoester acrylates and methacrylates, glycerol di- and-triacrylate, 1,4-cyclohexanediacrylate, bisacrylates and bismethacrylates of polyethylene glycol having molecular weights of 200 to 1500, or mixtures thereof. Polyfunctional monomers and oligomers are available for example from UCB Chemicals, Smyrna, Georgia, and Sartomer, Exton, Pennsylvania.<br>
Suitable ethylenically unsaturated polymerizable compounds are also the amides of identical or different unsaturated carboxylic acids of aromatic, cycloaliphatic and aliphatic polyamines containing for instance 2 to 6, for example 2 to 4, amino groups. Exemplary of such polyamines are ethyienediamine, 1,2- or 1,3-propylenediamine, 1,2-, 1,3-or 1,4-butylenediamine,        1,5-pentylenediamine,        1,6-hexylenediamine,        octylenediamine,<br><br>
dodecylenediamine, 1,4-diaminocyclohexane, isophoronediamine, phenylenediamine, bisphenylenediamine, bis(p-aminoethyl) ether, diethylenetriamine, triethylenetetramine, bis(D-aminoethoxy)ethane or bis(p-aminopropoxy)ethane. Other suitable polyamines are polymers and copolymers which may contain additional amino groups in the side-chain and oligoamides containing amino end groups.<br>
Exemplary of such unsaturated amides are: Methylenebisacrylamide, 1,6-hexamethylenebisacrylamide, diethylenetriaminetrismethacrylamide, bis(methacrylamido-propoxy)ethane, p-methacrylamidoethylmethacrylate, N-[(p-hydroxyethoxy)ethyl]acrylamide.<br>
Suitable unsaturated polyesters and polyamides are derived typically from maleic acid and diois or diamines. Maleic acid can be partially replaced by other dicarboxylic acids such as fumaric acid, itaconic acid, citraconic acid, mesaconic acid or chloromaleic acid. To control the reactivity of the polyester and to influence the crosslinking density and hence the product properties, it is possible to use in addition to the unsaturated dicarboxylic acids different amounts of saturated dicarboxylic acids such as phthalic acid, isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid, tetrahydrophthalic acid, succinic acid or adipic acid. The unsaturated polyesters can be used together with ethylenically unsaturated comonomers such as styrene. The polyesters and polyamides can also be derived from dicarboxylic acids and ethylenically unsaturated diols or diamines, especially from those with long chains containing typically from 6 to 20 carbon atoms. Polyurethanes are typically those derived from saturated or unsaturated diisocyanates and unsaturated and saturated diols.<br>
Suitable polyester acrylates or acrylated polyesters are obtained by reacting oligomers, typically epoxides, urethanes, polyethers or polyesters, with acrylates such as hydroxyethyl acrylate or hydroxypropyl acrylate.<br>
Polybutadiene and polyisoprene and copolymers thereof are known. Suitable comonomers include olefins such as ethylene, propene, butene, hexene, (meth)acrylates, acrylonitrile, styrene or vinyl chloride. Polymers containing (meth)acrylate groups in the side-chain are also known. They may typically be reaction products of epoxy resins based on novolak with (meth)acrylic acid, homo- or copolymers of polyvinyl alcohol or their hydroxyalkyl derivatives which are esterified with (meth)acryiic acid or homo- and copolymers of (meth)acrylates which are esterified with hydroxyalkyl(meth)acrylates.<br><br>
Monomers are for instance alkyi- or hydroxyalkyl acrylates or methacrylates, styrene, ethylene glycol diacrylate, propylene glycol diacrylate, neopentyl glycol diacrylate, hexamethylene glycol diacrylate or bisphenol A diacrylate, 4,4*-bis(2-acryloyloxyethoxy)diphenylpropane, trimethylolpropane triacrylate, pentaerythritol triacrylate or tetraacrylate, for instance acrylates, styrene, hexamethylene glycol or bisphenol A diacrylate, 4,4'-bis(2-acryloyloxyethoxy)diphenylpropane or trimethylolpropane triacrylate.<br>
Oligomeric polyunsaturated compounds are for instance polyester acrylates or unsaturated polyester resins which are prepared from maleic acid, fumaric acid, phthalic acid and one or more than one diol, and which typically have molecular weights from about 500 to 3000.<br>
Unsaturated carboxylic acids are for example acrylic acid and methacrylic acid.<br>
The photopolymerizable compounds are used by themselves or in any desired mixtures. It is suitable to use mixtures of polyol(meth)acrylates.<br>
Binders may also be added to the unsaturated photopolymerizable compounds. The addition of binders is particularly useful if the photopolymerizable compounds are liquid or viscous substances. The amount of binder may be from 5-95, for example 10-90, for instance 40-90, percent by weight, based on the entire composition. The choice of binder will depend on the field of use and the desired properties therefore, such as the ability of the compositions to be developed in aqueous and organic solvent systems, adhesion to substrates and susceptibility to oxygen.<br>
Suitable binders are typically polymers having a molecular weight of about 5,000 to 2,000,000, for instance 10,000 to 1,000,000. Illustrative examples are: Homo- and copolymers of acrylates and methacrylates, including copolymers of methyl methacrylate/ethyl acrylate/methacrylic acid, poly(alkylmethacrylates), poly(alkylacrylates); cellulose esters and ethers such as cellulose acetate, cellulose acetobutyrate, methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose; polyvinyl butyral, polyvinyl formal, cyclized rubber, polyethers such as polyethylene oxide, polypropylene oxide, polytetrahydrofuran; polystyrene, polycarbonate, polyurethane,     chlorinated     polyolefins,     polyvinyl     chloride,     copolymers     of    vinyl<br><br>
chloride/vinylidene chloride, copolymers of vinylidene chloride with acrylonitrile, methyl methacrylate and vinyl acetate, polyvinyl acetate, copoly(ethylene/vinyl acetate), polymers such as polycaprolactam and poly(hexamethylene adipamide), polyesters such as poly(ethylene glycol terephthalate) and poly(hexamethylene glycol succinate).<br>
The unsaturated compounds can also be used in admixture with non-photopolymerizable film-forming components. These components may be physically drying polymers or solutions thereof in organic solvents, for example nitrocellulose or cellulose acetobutyrate. The photopolymerizable unsaturated monomers may be a component of a free radical-ionic curable blend, such as a free radical-cationic curable blend. Also of importance are systems that undergo both thermal and photo-induced curing cycles, such as are used in powder coatings, laminates, certain adhesives and conformal coatings.<br>
Mixtures of a prepolymer with polyunsaturated monomers which, additionally contain a further unsaturated monomer are frequently used in paint systems. The prepolymer in this instance primarily determines the properties of the paint film and, by varying it, the skilled person can influence the properties of the cured film. The polyunsaturated monomer acts as crosslinking agent that renders the paint film insoluble. The mono-unsaturated monomer acts as reactive diluent with the aid of which the viscosity is lowered without having to use a solvent. Moreover, properties of the cured composition such as curing rate, crosslinking density and surface properties are dependent on the choice of monomer.<br>
Unsaturated polyester resins are usually used in two-component systems, together with a mono-unsaturated monomer, for example with styrene.<br>
Binary electron-rich/electron-poor monomer systems are often employed in thick pigmented coatings. For example, vinyl ether/unsaturated polyester systems are employed in powder coatings and styrene/unsaturated polyester systems are used in gel coats.<br>
A suitable process is that wherein the ethylenically unsaturated polymerizable compounds are a mixture of at least one oligomeric compound and at least one monomer.<br>
An interesting process is that wherein the ethylenically unsaturated polymerizable compounds are a mixture of 1) unsaturated polyesters, especially those that are prepared<br><br>
from maleic acid, fumaric acid and/or phthalic acid and one or more than one diol, and which have molecular weights of 500 to 3,000, and 2) acrylates, methacrylates or styrene or combinations thereof.<br>
An important process is also that wherein the ethylenically unsaturated polymerizable compounds are a mixture of 1) unsaturated polyesters and 2) acrylates or methacrylates or combinations thereof.<br>
Another interesting process is that wherein the ethylenically unsaturated polymerizable compounds are a mixture of 1) unsaturated polyester acrylates and 2) acrylates or methacrylates or combinations thereof.<br>
The present photopolymerizable coating compositions may additionally contain further additives. Examples thereof are thermal inhibitors, which are intended to prevent premature polymerization, for example hydroquinone, hydroquinone derivatives, p-methoxyphenol, p-naphthol or sterically hindered phenols such as 2,6-di(tert-butyl)-p-cresol. To enhance the dark storage stability it is possible to add copper compounds, including copper naphthenate, copper stearate or copper octoate, phosphorus compounds, including triphenylphosphine, tributylphosphine, triethyl phosphite, triphenyl phosphite, or tribenzyl phosphite, quaternary ammonium compounds, such as tetramethylammonium chloride or trimethylbenzylammonium chloride, or hydroxylamine derivatives, such as N-diethylhydroxylamine. The exclusion of atmospheric oxygen during the polymerization may be effected by adding paraffin or similar wax-like substances which, at the onset of polymerization, migrate to the surface owing to lack of solubility in the polymer and form a transparent film which prevents air from entering the system. Similarly, an oxygen-impermeable layer may be applied. UV absorbers, typically those of the hydroxyphenylbenzotriazole, hydroxyphenylbenzophenone, oxanilide or hydroxyphenyl-s-triazine type, or combinations thereof, may be added as light stabilizers. It may be advantageous to add light stabilizers that do not absorb UV light, for example those of the sterically hindered amine (HALS) class. The light stabilizers selected from the classes of UV absorbers or HALS may be employed separately or in any combination.<br>

(5 mil), from about 50.8 Î¼ , (2 mil) to about 127 Î¼ (5 mil), from about 76.2 Î¼ (3 mil) to about 127 Î¼  (5 mil), or from about 101.6 n (4 mil) to about 127 Î¼  (5 mil). For example, the present dry coating film thicknesses are from about 12.7 Î¼ (0.5 mil) to about 88.9 Î¼  (3.5 mil), or from about 25.4 Î¼ (1 mil) to about 63.5Î¼ . (2.5 mil).<br>
The films prepared according to this invention are advantageously employed for example as window films, in graphic overcoating, as solar control films, as backlit display films, as overlaminate films (exterior or interior digital graphics and the like), in signage, in laminated glazing, ink jet media coatings, in electrochromic/photochromic applications, optical light films, in safety glass/windshield interlayers, in-mold films, decals, anti-grafitti films, specialty packaging, compact disc coatings, protective coatings for polymer substrates (e.g. for plastic parts such as machine and automobile parts), and other high-performance thin coating applications.<br>
The present films are especially effective towards preventing the underlying substrate against the deleterious effects of UV radiation. For example, they are especially effective towards the protection of dyes or pigments present in underlying substrates against color fade.<br>
The substrate surface can be coated by applying to said substrate a liquid composition, a solution or suspension. The choice of solvent and the concentration will depend mainly on the type of formulation and on the coating method employed. The solvent should be inert; in other words it should not undergo any chemical reaction with the components and should be capable of being removed again after the coating operation, in<br><br>
the drying process. Examples of suitable solvents are ketones, ethers and esters, such as methyl ethyl ketone, isobutyl methyl ketone, cyclopentanone, cyclohexanone, N-methylpyrrolidone, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, 2-methoxyethanol, 2-ethoxyethanol, 1-methoxy-2-propanol, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, ethyl acetate, n-butyl acetate and ethyl 3-ethoxypropionate. The suspension is uniformly applied to a substrate by known coating techniques such as by spin coating, dip coating, curtain coating, knife coating, brushing or spraying or reverse roll coating. It is also possible to apply the photosensitive layer to a temporary, flexible support and then to coat the final substrate, for example a copper-laminated circuit board, by means of layer transfer via lamination.<br>
The present method may additionally be employed for radiation-curable powder coatings. The powder coatings can be based on solid resins and on monomers containing reactive double bonds*, for example maleates, vinyl ethers, acrylates, acrylamides and mixtures thereof. A free-radically UV-curable powder coating can be formulated by mixing unsaturated polyester resins with solid acrylamides (e.g. methyl methacrylamidoglycolate) and with a free-radical photoinitiator system according to the invention, as described, for example, in the paper "Radiation Curing of Powder Coating", Conference Proceedings, Radtech Europe 1993 by M. Wittig and Th. Gohmann. Similarly, free-radically UV-curable powder coatings can be formulated by mixing unsaturated polyester resins with solid acrylates, methacrylates or vinyl ethers and with a photoinitiator system according to the invention. The powder coatings may also comprise binders as described, for example, in DE-A-4228514 and EP-A-636669. The UV-curable powder coatings may also comprise white or colored pigments. Thus, for example, rutile titanium dioxide can be employed in concentrations of up to 50% by weight in order to give a cured powder coating having good covering power. The process normally comprises electrostatic or tribostatic spraying of the powder onto the substrate, for example metal or wood, melting of the powder by heating and, after a smooth film has been formed, radiation-curing of the coating using ultraviolet and/or visible light, for example with medium-pressure mercury lamps, metal halide lamps or xenon lamps. A particular advantage of the radiation-curable powder coatings over their heat-curable counterparts is that the flow time after the melting of the powder particles can be selectively extended in order to ensure the formation of a smooth, high-gloss coating. In contrast to heat-curable systems, radiation-curable powder coatings can be formulated without the unwanted effect of a reduction in their lifetime, so that they melt at relatively low temperatures.     For this reason, they are also suitable as  coatings for heat-sensitive<br><br>
substrates such as wood or plastics. In addition to the photoinitiator systems according to the invention, the powder coating formulations may also include UV absorbers. Appropriate examples have been listed above under sections 1.-8.<br>
The photosensitivity of the compositions according to the invention generally ranges from the UV region (about 200 nm) up to about 600 nm. Suitable radiation comprises, for example, sunlight or light from artificial sources. Therefore, a large number of very different types of light source can be used. Both point sources and flat radiators (lamp carpets) are appropriate. Examples are carbon arc lamps, xenon arc lamps, medium-pressure, high-pressure and low-pressure mercury lamps, doped with metal halides if desired (metal halogen lamps), microwave-stimulated metal vapor lamps, excimer lamps, superactinic fluorescent tubes, fluorescent lamps, incandescent argon lamps, electronic flashlights, photographic flood lamps, electron beams and X-rays. For example, Hg lamps, iron doped Hg lamps or Ga doped Hg lamps are suitable. Artificial light sources equivalent to daylight may be used, such as low intensity lamps such as specific fluorescent lamps, e.g. Philips TL05 or TL09 special fluorescent lamps. The distance between the lamp and the substrate according to the invention which is to be coated can vary depending on the application and on the type and/or power of the lamp, for example between 2 cm and 150 cm. Also suitable, for example, are lasers in the visible range. The cure may be effected behind a transparent layer (e.g. a pane of glass or plastic sheet).<br>
Complicated and expensive apparatus is superfluous when using light sources that emit light of low intensity, and the compositions in this case can be used in particular for special exterior applications. The cure with daylight or with light sources equivalent to daylight is an alternative to the standard moving belt method of UV curing. In contrast to the moving belt method, which is particularly suitable for flat parts, the daylight cure can be used for exterior coatings on stationary and fixed objects or constructions. These are typically coatings on buildings, facades, bridges, ships or markings on roads and sites as disclosed, inter alia, in EP-A-160723.<br>
The cure with daylight or with light sources equivalent to daylight is an energy-saving method and, in exterior applications, no emission of volatile organic components into the environment occurs. The cure with daylight or light sources equivalent to daylight is, however, also suitable for series curing in which the objects are so positioned that angular<br><br>
areas are also exposed to daylight. In this connection, mirrors or reflectors can also be used.<br>
A further aspect of the invention is a curable composition itself useful in the process described above. Accordingly, further disclosed is a photo-curable coating composition, wherein said coating composition comprises<br>
a)	at least one ethylenically unsaturated polymerizable compound,<br>
b)	at least one durable and/or red-shifted reactable hydroxyphenylbenzotriazole UV absorber comprising an ethylenically unsaturated polymerizable group and<br>
c)	a combination of photoinitiators comprising<br>
i) at least one a-hydroxy ketone photoinitiator and ii) at least one bisacylphosphine oxide photoinitiator.<br>
The definitions and preferences given above apply also for the curable conposition.<br>

UV Curable Formulation<br>
Urethane acrylate oligomer (20g, Bomar, BR 5824), ethoxylated bisphenol A diacrylate (20g, Sartomer, SR 601), propoxylated trimethylol propane triacrylate (32 g, Sartomer, SR492), di-trimethylolpropane tetraacrylate (25g, Sartomer, SR 355), bis (2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)-phenylphosphine oxide (0.33g, Giba, IrgacureÂ® 819), 1-hydroxycyclohexylphenyl ketone (2.67g, Ciba, IrgacureÂ® 184), and, optionally, a reactable benzotriazole (3 g, 3% based on formulation weight) are added to a laboratory reactor equipped with the necessary auxiliary equipment. The mixture is agitated and heated gently to 50-80Â°C for one hour after which the mass is cooled to ambient temperature and agitated for an additional hour.<br><br>
UV Cured Film Preparation<br>
2 mil (50,8 micron) thick films are prepared by applying the acrylate resin to glass plates using a Bird Film applicator, followed by UV light exposure under a nitrogen environment on a Fusion conveyer belt system (Fusion UV model DRS-10/12 conveyer system with nitrogen inerting capability). The lamp is a Fusion VPS/I600 (F600 series) irradiator that is equipped with a "D-lamp" (Fe doped mercury lamp bulb). A trace oxygen analyzer (Alpha Omega Instruments, model Series 2000) is used to measure 02 levels during light curing. Under a nitrogen purge and at 50 ft/min conveyer belt speed, the oxygen levels are typically 
The VPS 600 unit is operated at variable voltage settings, which provided control over the light output intensity. The belt speed is maintained at a rate of 50 ft/min throughout all operations.<br>
Example 3<br>
MEK Double Rub Test<br>
The solvent resistance is determined using a MEK (methyl ethyl ketone) double rub test. This procedure is found in: Z. Jovanovic et al Verfkroniek 2001, 74(11), 29-32. The number of double rubs required to break or mar the surface of the coating is measured using a Crockmeter (Am. Assoc, of Textile Chemist Colorants, US Patent 2,114,831).<br>
The MEK double rub is correlated to the solvent resistance and increases with the degree of cure. The degree of cure is related to the amount of light used to activate the photoinitiator. In general, the MEK double value is an increasing function of light dose and reaches a certain plateau value. A maximum of 100 MEK double rubs were interpreted as full cure for these coating, i.e., the solvent resistance was independent of the light dose when the MEK values of 100 or greater were obtained.<br><br>

C is 2-methyl-acrylic acid  3-[5-.tert.-butyI-4-hydroxy-3-(5-trifluoromethyl-benzotriazol-2-yl)-phenyl]-propyl ester<br>
D is 2-methyl-acrylic acid 3-[3-(5-benzenesulfonyl-benzothazol-2-yl)-5-.tert.-butyl-4-hydroxy-phenylj-propyl ester<br>
This demonstrates that the coating is readily cured in the presence of a red-shifted benzotriazole and it is not detrimental to the cure rate or cure speed.<br>
Example 4<br>
Thumb-Twist Test<br>
The thumb-twist test is used to assess the degree of cure and is a pass-fail test. The reference for this test is located in: C. Lowe, Volume VI. Test methods for UV &amp; EB Curable<br><br>
Systems, p. 74 (Wiley/SITA Series in Surface Coatings Technology, SITA Technology Limited, 1996). It is carried out on a series of coatings that are exposed to increasingly higher amounts of UV dose. A failure is when the thumb-twist produces surface mar, which indicates the coating is undercured. The dose needed to pass the thumb-twist is when no surface mar occurs.<br><br>
C is 2-methyl-acrylic acid 3-[5-tert-butyl-4-hydroxy-3-(5-trifluoromethyl-benzotriazol-2-yl)-phenyl]-propyl ester<br>

Example 5<br>
UV Stability and Photo-Bleaching Resistance<br>
UV absorption spectra are taken of the cured films (containing 3 wt% UV absorber) to determine whether photo-bleaching of the UV absorber had occurs during UV curing. Little to no change in optical density is highly desired.<br><br>
C   is   2-methyl-acrylic  acid   3-[5-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyÂ«3-(5-trifluoromethyl-benzotriazol-2-yl)-phenyl]-propyl ester<br>
D is 2-methyl-acrylic acid 3-[3-(5-benzenesulfonyl-benzotriazol-2-yl)-5-tert-butyl-4-hydroxy-phenyl]-propyl ester<br>
The absorption occurring from the control UV absorber (optical density) is decreased about 9% at high light doses. This demonstrates photo-fading of this compound occurred at very high light exposures (&gt; 13 J/cm2) and is less photostable than the instant red-shifted compounds.<br>
The absorption occurring from the inventive UV absorbers C and D (optical density) changed very little and is invariant to the light dose. The fact that no change occurred in the UV absorption spectra of the UV absorbers in the cured coatings demonstrate that the instant compounds can survive the UV exposure conditions. Furthermore, it is found that no photo-fading of these compounds occurred even at very high light exposures (&gt; 13 J/cm2).<br><br>
This result demonstrates that the instant compounds could also be used in photo-curable coatings that require higher exposures than the one under current study.<br>
