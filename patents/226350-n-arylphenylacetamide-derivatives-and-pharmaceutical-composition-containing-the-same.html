N-ARYLPHENYLACETAMIDE DERIVATIVES AND PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION CONTAINING THE SAME<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an N-arylphenylacetamide derivative being useful as an agent for treatment of pain and inflammation, and a pharmaceutical composition containing the same.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Capsaicin (trans-8-methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonenamide) is present in juices of Capsicum plants, and it has been commonly used as a spice, and further, it has been knovi^n to exhibit an analgesic effect and an antiinflammatory effect.    Capsaicin has been considered to act on a specific receptor being present in primary afferent sensory nerves (C-fibers: capsaicin-sensitive nerves), whereby it causes a drastic pungency (pain) and further exhibits an analgesic effect and an antiinflammatory effect thereafter.    Recently, said receptor has been cloned and named as vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (hereinafter, referred to as VRl) (cf., Nature, 389, 816 (1997)).   VRl has been considered from its amino acid sequence as an ion channel having six transmembrane domains and showing a high Ca2+ permeability, and it is suggested that VRl is possibly activated not only by capsaicin-like compounds but also by thermal stimuli or protons, and further that VRl may possibly be involved with pain in various clinical conditions.    When capsaicin acts on VRl in primary afferent sensory nerves, a cation channel is opened,<br><br>
and the membrane is depolarized so that neuropeptides such as substance P are released to induce pain.    Capsaicin, a pain inducing substance, is actually used in the treatment of painful disorders such as diabetic neuropathy and rheumatic arthritis.   The reason for this paradoxical use of capsaicin has been considered that sensory nerves are insensitive (desensitized) to painful stimuli as a result of continuous VRl cation channel opening after repeatedly application of capsaicin (cf., Pharmacol. Rev., SJ, 159 (1999)).<br>
At the moment, narcotic analgesics (morphine, etc.) and nonnarcotic analgesics (NSAIDs, etc.) are commonly used as an analgesic agent.    However, the use of narcotic analgesics is strictly restricted, because of development of tolerance, dependency or serious side effects thereof.    Further, nonnarcotic analgesics are not effective to severe pain, and it has been known that nonnarcotic analgesics are associated with significant rates of upper digestive disorders or liver disorders by prolonged administration thereof.    Under the circumstances, it has been desired to develop an analgesic agent exhibiting a higher analgesic effect with few side effects.    Moreover, since there is no effective analgesic agent for neuropathic pains such as pains caused by diabetic neuropathy, post herpetic neuralgia, trigeminal neuralgia, it has also been desired to develop a novel analgesic agent to treat them.<br>
Capsaicin-like compounds acting on VRl receptor (VRl receptor agonists) have been considered to exhibit their effects based on a completely different action mechanism from the existing analgesic agents, i.e., desensitization of capsaicin-sensitive sensory nerve, and hence, the efficacy of such compounds has greatly been expected for the<br><br>
treatment of neuropathic pains for which the existing analgesic agents cannot be effective, or pains induced in various pathologic conditions such as rheumatic arthritis.<br>
Since it is reported that capsazepin, which is an only-known VRl receptor antagonist, exhibits a significant analgesic effect in an animal pain model (cf., Life Science, 69, 2911 (2001)), VRl receptor antagonists may also be an agent for treatment of various pains.<br>
The compounds with similar actions of capsaicin may be useful as an agent for treatment of diseases in which primary afferent sensory nerves (C-fibers) are concerned, such as essential pruritus, allergy or nonallergic rhinitis, frequent urination and urinary incontinence with overactive bladder, stroke, irritable bowel syndrome, respiratory disorders such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dermatitis, mucositis, gastric and duodenal ulcers, inflammatory bowel diseases.<br>
Further, since it has been reported that capsaicin exhibits an anti-obesity activity by promoting the hypersecretion of adrenalin (cf., Pharmacol. Rev., 38, 179 (1986)), capsaicin-like compounds will be useful as an agent for treatment of obesity.<br>
As capsaicin analogous compounds having an analgesic activity^ JP-A-63-295537 (= EP 0282127B, US 5099030, US 5045565) discloses beta-aminoethyl-substituted phenyl compounds, JP-A-4-230257 (= EP 0462933B) discloses N-benzyl-N'-phenyl- and -phenylalkyl-thiourea compounds, and WO 00/16756 discloses N-acylvanillinamide derivatives.    In addition, J. Med. Chem., 36, 2595 (1993) discloses with respect to the analgesic effects of N-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzyl)-4-pentylbenzamide, but it is reported that this compound has no<br><br>
analgesic effect.   The compounds disclosed in these patent publications and literatures are N-benzylamide derivatives or N-benzylthiourea derivatives, but the compounds of the formula (I) as described hereinafter are phenylacetamide derivatives, and therefore, these compounds are different in the chemical structures thereof.<br>
It has been disclosed that the substituted phenylacetamide derivatives (in JP-A-62-48657 (=EP 206609B, US 5013759)) and the N-arylalkylphenylacetamide compounds (in JP-A-5-320113 (=EP 0525360B, US 5242944) and JP-A-8-283220 (= EP 0721939B, US 5670546)) exhibit an analgesic effect.    Furthermore, GB 2168975 discloses an aralkaneamide compound having an analgesic effect. However, these patent publications never specifically disclose the N-arylacetamide derivative of the formula (I) as described below.<br>
WO 99/29674 discloses that the following anilides are compounds inhibiting the metabolism of retinoic acid.<br><br>
wherein X is O, etc., R2is hydrogen atom, a C1-6 alkyl group, etc., R2is a hydrogen atom, a C1.12 alkyl group, a C2-8 alkenyl group, etc., R2is a hydrogen atom, a C1-6 alkyl group, etc., R*^ is an aryl group, etc., Het is an unsaturated heterocyclic group selected from a pyrrolyl group, a pyrazolyl group, an imidazolyl group, a triazolyl group, a tetraZolyl group and a pyrimidinyl group, which may optionally be substituted by an amino, a mercapto, a C1-6 alkyl, a C1-6 alkylthio, or an aryl.<br><br>

The test results are shown in Table 2, Table 3, Table 4 and Table 5.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
As shown in Table 2, the compounds of the present invention exhibited a potent analgesic activity by subcutaneous administration. The compounds of Examples as shown in Table 3 showed a potent analgesic activity with an ED50 of not more than 1 mg/kg (subcutaneous administration), and among them, the compounds of Examples 1, 13, 20, 36, 54, 63, 69, 83 and 249 especially showed an extremely potent analgesic activity with an ED50 of not more than 0.1 mg/kg (subcutaneous administration).<br>
The compounds of the present invention as shown in Table 4 showed a comparatively potent analgesic activity by oral administration. Especially, the compounds of Examples 59, 60, 62, 63, 122, 123, 124, 125, 171, 173, 179 and 184 showed a potent analgesic activity with an ED50 of not more than 1 mg/kg (oral administration). Experiment 2: Study of pungency (eye wiping test)<br>
The pungency of the test compounds were studied referring to the method of Jancso et al. [Acta Physiol. Acad. Sci. Hung., 19, 113-131 (1961)] and the method of Szallasi et al. [Brit. J. Pharmacol., 119, 283-290 (1996)].    A test compound was dissolved in a physiological saline solution containing 10 % ethanol and 10 % Tween 80 into various concentrations (pg/ml), and a drop of the solution thereof was added dropwise into the eye of Jcl:SD strain male rats (5 to 25 mice per group, body weight; 220 to 280 g).   Then, the number of the protective wiping movements with forefoot was counted for 3 minutes, and was considered as an index for pungency.   The test results are expressed as average value ± S.E.M., and the statistical significant differences between each test compound-treated group and the control group were analyzed using non-parametric Dunnett's multiple range test, and<br><br><br><br>
As is shown in Table 6, capsaicin significantly increased the number of wiping movements at a dose of 5 ug/ml.    On the other hand, the pungency of each compound of Examples as listed in Table 6 was one-tenth or less weaker than that of capsaicin.    Among them, the compounds of Examples 60, 62, 66, 164 and 225 showed no significant increase in the number of wiping movements even at a high dose of 500 ].ig/ml, and their pungency is quiet weak.<br>
As is apparent from the above test results, the compounds of the present invention, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and a hydrate or solvate thereof exhibit a potent analgesic effect with a weak pungency, and they are efficacious even in oral administration. Therefore, the compounds of the present invention are useful as analgesic agents and antiinflammatory agents, and as an agent for treatment of neuropathic pain to which conventional analgesic agents are ineffective, or pain caused by rheumatic arthritis.
