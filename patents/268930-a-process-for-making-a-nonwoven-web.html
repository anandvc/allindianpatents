PROCESS AND APPARATUS FOR PRODUCING SUB-MICRON FIBERS. AND<br>
NONWOVENS AND ARTICLES CONTAINING SAME<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]	The present invention generally relates to producing sub-micron fibers,<br>
and more specifically relates to a process and apparatus for effecting formation of sub-<br>
micron fibers by fibrillation of polymer films, and nonwoven materials and articles<br>
incorporating them.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]	Continuous and discontinuous filament spinning technologies are known<br>
in art, and are commonly referred to as spunmelt technologies. Spunmelt<br>
technologies include both the meltblown or spunbond processes. A spunbond process<br>
involves supplying a molten polymer, which is then extruded under pressure through a<br>
large number of orifices in a plate known as a spinneret or die. The resulting<br>
continuous filaments are quenched and drawn by any of a number of methods, such<br>
as slot draw systems, attenuator guns, or Godet rolls. The continuous filaments are<br>
collected as a loose web upon a moving foraminous surface, such as a wire mesh<br>
conveyor belt. When more than one spinneret is used in line for the purpose of<br>
forming a multi-layered fabric, the subsequent webs are collected upon the uppermost<br>
surface of the previously formed web.<br>
[0003]	The melt-blown process is related to means of the spunbond process for<br>
forming a layer of a nonwoven fabric, wherein, a molten polymer is extruded under<br>
pressure through orifices in a spinneret or die. High velocity gas impinges upon and<br>
attenuates the filaments as they exit the die. The energy of this step is such that the<br>
formed filaments are greatly reduced in diameter and are fractured so that microfibers<br>
-1-<br><br>
of indeterminate length are produced. This differs from the spunbond process<br>
whereby the continuity of the filaments is preserved.<br>
[0004]	Spunmelt equipment manufacturing companies, such as Reifenhauser,<br>
Ason Neumag, Nordson, and Accurate Products have engineered numerous<br>
meltblown and/or spunbond manufacturing models that offer a variety of desirable<br>
attributes, such as increased polymer throughputs, better management of process air<br>
flow or polymer distribution, and improved control of filament deviations, to name a<br>
few. U.S. Patent Numbers 4,708,619; 4,813,864; 4,820,142; 4,838,774; 5,087,186;<br>
6,427,745; and 6,565,344, all of which are incorporated herein by reference, disclose<br>
examples of manufacturing equipment for the processing of spunbond or meltblown<br>
materials.	!<br>
[0005]	There is an increasing demand for articles produced from nonwoven<br>
containing sub-micron fibers. The diameters of sub-micron fibers are generally<br>
understood to be less than about 1000 nanometer (i.e., one micron). The sub-micron<br>
fibers webs are desired due to their high surface area, low pore size, and other<br>
characteristics. The sub-micron fibers can be produced by a variety of methods and<br>
from a variety of materials. Although several methods have been used, there are<br>
drawbacks to each of the methods and producing cost effective sub-micron fibers has<br>
been difficult. Conventional spunmelt equipment arrangements can not provide high<br>
quality, low defect fibers and webs that are predominantly microfine including<br>
submicron diameter fibers with narrow fiber size distributions.<br>
[0006]	Methods of producing sub-micron fibers include a class of methods<br>
described by melt fibrillation. Non limiting examples of melt fibrillation methods include<br>
melt blowing, melt fiber bursting, and melt film fibrillation. Methods of producing sub-<br>
micron fibers, not from melts, are film fibrillation, electro-spinning, and solution<br>
spinning. Other methods of producing sub-micron fibers include spinning a larger<br>
diameter bi-component fiber in an islands-in-the-sea, segmented pie, or other<br>
configuration where the fiber is then further processed so that sub-micron fibers result.<br>
-2-<br><br>
[0007]	Melt fibrillation is a general class of making fibers defined in that one or<br>
more polymers are molten and extruded into many possible configurations (e.g. co-<br>
extrusion, homogeneous or bicomponent films or filaments) and then fibrillated or<br>
fiberized into filaments.<br>
[0008]	Melt film fibrillation is another method to produce fibers. A melt film is<br>
produced from the melt and then a fluid is used to form fibers from the melt film. Two<br>
examples of this method include Torobin's U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,315,806; 5,183,670; and<br>
4,536,361; and Reneker's U.S, Pat. Nos. 6,382,526, 6,520,425 and 6,695,992,<br>
assigned to the University of Akron.<br>
[0009]	Electrospinning is a commonly used method of producing sub-micron<br>
fibers. In one manifestation of this method, a polymer is dissolved in a solvent and<br>
placed in a chamber sealed at one end with a small opening in a necked down portion<br>
at the other end. A high voltage potential is then applied between the polymer solution<br>
and a collector near the open end of the chamber. The production rates of this process<br>
are very slow and fibers are typically produced in small quantities. Another spinning<br>
technique for producing sub-micron fibers is solution or flash spinning which utilizes a<br>
solvent.<br>
[0010]	One of the ways to achieve high melt shear for a melt film fibrillation<br>
process is through high-speed gas (i.e., close to sonic or supersonic gas velocities).<br>
To obtain supersonic or transonic (close to sonic) velocities, flow typically needs to<br>
converge to a throat (narrowest part of the nozzle where the velocity reaches sonic<br>
levels) and then expands in a diverging section. Adiabatic nozzles (no heat gained or<br>
lost through the boundaries of the nozzle system) meeting these general criteria are<br>
known in the art, and include so-called Laval nozzles. Use of Laval type nozzles in<br>
fiber formation are disclosed, e.g., in U.S. Pat. Appln. Publ. No. 2004/0099981 A1,<br>
and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,075,161 and 5,260,003. These methods utilize Laval nozzles to<br>
speed up the gas velocities to sonic and/or supersonic range. When polymer melt is<br>
exposed to such high gas velocities, it bursts into multiplicity of fine fibers. They<br>
-3-<br><br>
generally use concentric input and channeling of gas and polymer melt in the<br>
discharge nozzles, which can be non-optimal from standpoints of equipment lay-out<br>
complexity and equipment maintenance, etc. However, other nozzle configurations,<br>
such as non-concentric (non-annular) layouts of nozzles pose challenges of their own.<br>
For instance, in a fiber or filament nozzle system where polymer melt and gas<br>
introduction proceed from separate side-by-side units, a problem tends to arise when<br>
the fiberization gas flows between a side with a surface or wall that is heated to a high<br>
temperature (e.g., due to polymer melt flow introduction from that side) and a surface<br>
or wall of an opposing side (for example, an gas introduction side) that is at a lower<br>
temperature than the polymer melt side. In such a scenario, gas flow tends to become<br>
unstable in the diverging section in prior nozzle configurations such as with a Laval<br>
nozzle. This leads to problems of lack of polymer shear, polymer back-flow or build-up<br>
into the gas side of the gas passage, and subsequently an unevenly varying excessive<br>
and diminishing polymer flow and fiberization. After sufficient melt build up occurs<br>
upstream into the gas side, polymer melt separates and is typically blown out as a<br>
"shot," since the melt locally cools down and can no longer form fibers due to<br>
insufficient shearing of polymer. When the polymer flow starves as the other end of<br>
those variation, the shearing is excessive leading to undesired dust. New advances<br>
have been needed to allow production of consistently high quality sub-micron fibers for<br>
disposable articles in a more efficient manner at commercially-significant output levels.<br>
Summary<br>
[0011]	The present invention is directed to high quality, low defect sub-micron<br>
fibers and nonwovens incorporating the sub-micron fibers that are produced in a<br>
unique single step, melt film fibrillation, high throughout process, and a nozzle device<br>
used for this purpose. Nonwoven products are attained that contain high quality<br>
microfiber content, which in onje aspect exceeds 99% sub-micron fiber content, at<br>
commercial scale throughputs. Increased polymer shear and reduction of polymer<br>
back-flow or build-up problems otherwise leading to undesired fiber defects, such as<br>
-4-<br><br>
shot development within a nozzle system, are also achieved by the present invention.<br>
With the present invention, high quality, microfibrous nonwoven products having<br>
improved barrier properties, softness, absorbency, opacity and/or high surface area<br>
are provided that are suitable for a large variety of industrial and consumer care<br>
fibrous products.<br>
[0012]	A process for making a nonwoven web has been found for producing<br>
high quality, high output sub-micron fiber product by providing a pressurized gas<br>
stream flowing within a gas passage confined between first and second opposing walls<br>
which define respective upstream converging and downstream diverging wall surfaces<br>
into which polymer melt is introduced to provide an extruded polymer film on a heated<br>
wall surface that is impinged by the gas stream flowing within the gas passage,<br>
effective to fibrillate the polymer film into sub-micron diameter fibers. "Converging"<br>
means that the cross-sectional area decreases in the direction of gas flow; and<br>
"diverging" means that the cross-sectional area increases in the direction of gas flow.<br>
In one embodiment, the gas passage comprises a first, upstream section into which<br>
the gas enters from a supply end, a transition region, and a second, downstream<br>
section in which the gas flows to an exit end, wherein the transition region fluidly<br>
connects the first section to the second section, and the gas passage ends at the exit<br>
end of the second section. In a particular embodiment, the first section of the gas<br>
passage has a monotonically decreasing cross-sectional area from the supply end to<br>
the transition region, and the second section of the gas passage has a monotonically<br>
increasing cross-sectional area from the transition region to the exit end of the second<br>
section. At least one flowing polymer fluid stream is transmitted through at least one<br>
bounded polymer passage which ends in at least one opening in at least one of the<br>
opposing heated walls. Polymer is heated sufficiently in transit to make and keep it<br>
flowable until introduced into the gas passage. Each polymer fluid stream extrudes in<br>
the form of a film from each opening. Each extruded polymer film joins with the gas<br>
stream and the polymer film is fibrillated to form fibers comprising sub-micron fibers<br>
-5-<br><br>
exiting from the exit end of the second section of the gas passage. For purposes<br>
herein, "monotonically decreasing cross-sectional area" means "strictly decreasing<br>
cross-sectional area" from the upper (jnlet) end to the lower end of the upstream<br>
nozzle section, and "monotonically increasing cross-sectional area" means "strictly<br>
increasing cross-sectional area" from the upper end to the exit end of the downstream<br>
section of the nozzle.<br>
[0013]	Although not desiring to be bound to any theory, it is thought that the<br>
introduction of heated polymer as a film on a heated support wall which in part defines<br>
the gas passage within the nozzle as described herein makes it possible to maintain<br>
and control gas flow uniformity in an enhanced manner such that the fibrillated fiber<br>
product has improved size distribution that is weighted towards or is even exclusively<br>
in the sub-micron fiber size range.<br>
[0014]	In a particular embodiment, each extruded polymer film joins with the gas<br>
stream in the second section of the gas passage. The introduction of the polymer melt<br>
in the second section of the nozzle system on a heated diverging support wall has<br>
been found to especially facilitate production of high quality, high content sub-micron<br>
fibers and resulting webs at commercial throughputs. In a further embodiment, the<br>
location where the extruded polymer film joins with the gas in the second, downstream<br>
section in order to produce the best quality fibers and web depends on the type of gas,<br>
the nozzle geometry, including angles and transitions, and the pressure of the gas,<br>
and is preferably located in the upper half of the second section such as for low gas<br>
pressure conditions, and is preferably located in the lower, downstream half of the<br>
second section such as for high gas pressure conditions. In a particular embodiment,<br>
only one polymer film forms on at least one of the opposite heated walls, the gas<br>
pressure exceeds about 10psi, and each polymer passage opening from which<br>
polymer film extrudes is located in a second, downstream half of the second section<br>
between the transition region and the exit end of the second section. It has been<br>
found that the second half of the downstream second section can provide an optimal<br>
-6-<br><br>
gas velocity region where melt film fibrillation is accomplished very efficiently, yielding<br>
higher quality microfiber product.<br>
[0015]	As another advantage of the present invention, increased sub-micron<br>
fiber output is obtained with lower gas demand. Lowered gas demand makes it<br>
possible to reduce energy consumption and/or use smaller scale unit operations to still<br>
" provide commercially significant sub-micron fiber output levels. In one embodiment,<br>
the gas stream and polymer fluid stream are introduced into the second section at a<br>
gas stream/polymer fluid stream mass flow rate ratio less than about 40:1, particularly<br>
less than about 30:1; more particularly less than about 15:1. The gas stream to<br>
polymer fluid stream mass flow ratio is calculated as kilogram per hour per meter of<br>
gas stream through the gas passage to kilogram per hour per meter of polymer fluid<br>
stream through all the polymer] openings in the second section of the gas passage.<br>
[0016]	In more particular embodiments, each polymer passage opening may be<br>
a slit with a hydraulic diameter defined as four times cross-sectional area of the<br>
polymer passage opening divided by inner perimeter of the polymer passage opening,<br>
said hydraulic diameter of each polymer passage opening ranging from about 0.001<br>
inch to about 0.100 inch. The polymer film generally has a polymer film thickness not<br>
exceeding the hydraulic diameter of the polymer passage opening. The polymer fluid<br>
may expand upon exiting the polymer passage opening, for example, due to die swell<br>
phenomenon without being limited by theory. However, the polymer fluid film<br>
thickness almost instantaneously becomes lesser than or equal to the hydraulic<br>
diameter of the polymer passage opening.<br>
[0017]	In characterizing the geometry of the wall-defined gas passage of the<br>
nozzle of the present invention, a first bisecting surface, defined as an angular bisector<br>
of the angle between the first and second walls in the first section, geometrically<br>
divides the first section into two halves with about equal volumes, and a second<br>
bisecting surface, defined as an angular bisector of the angle between the first and<br>
second walls in the second section, geometrically divides the second section into two<br>
-7-<br><br>
halves with about equal volumes. The bisecting surface may be planar or curvilinear,<br>
depending on the embodiment of the present invention, as will be more apparent from<br>
the detailed descriptions herein. In a general embodiment, the bisection angle of the<br>
first and the second walls with respect to the first bisecting surface ranges from about<br>
15 to about 40 degrees in the first section, and the bisection angle of the first and the<br>
second walls with respect to the second bisecting surface ranges from about 2 to<br>
about 20 degrees in the second section of the gas passage.<br>
[0018]	The opposing walls of nozzle where polymer is introduced into the gas<br>
passage may be operated such that they are thermally similar or different. In one<br>
embodiment, the first and second walls of the gas passage are heated to<br>
approximately the same temperature to provide symmetric thermal states with respect<br>
to the first and the second bisecting surfaces. In an alternative embodiment, one of the<br>
opposing walls may be a hot wall while the other wall is a cold wall, wherein<br>
temperature of the hot wall is at least higher than the cold wall, such as at least 50°C<br>
higher, and only the hot wall has at least one polymer fluid passage opening. In this<br>
configuration, the microfibers may be produced in a hot melt/"cold" gas (e.g., unheated<br>
air) fibrillation environment that reduces process complexity and costs. In this<br>
embodiment, the hot wall in the second section diverges away from the first bisecting<br>
surface at an angle that ranges from about 1 degree to 20 degrees, and the cold wall<br>
in the second section converges towards the first bisecting surface at an angle that<br>
ranges from about 0.1 degree to about 15 degrees. The ratio between the diverging<br>
angle of the hot wall relative to the first bisecting surface and the converging angle of<br>
the cold wall relative to the first bisecting surface may range from about 1:1 to about<br>
500:1. The angle between centerline of each polymer passage and the wall containing<br>
the corresponding polymer passage opening may range from about 10 degrees to<br>
about 100 degrees. The polymer fiim extruding from each polymer passage opening<br>
may flow with the gas flow along a polymer fiberization surface, which has an<br>
orientation angle with respect to the first bisecting surface ranging from about 90<br>
-8-<br><br>
degrees measured in clockwise direction to about 45 degrees measured in<br>
counterclockwise direction. The length of the polymer fiberization surface<br>
corresponding to each polymer passage opening may be less than about one<br>
thousand times the hydraulic diameter of the corresponding polymer passage opening.<br>
[0019]	In another embodiment, the first and second walls of the gas passage<br>
are smoothly curved such that the curvature of the opposing walls in the first section<br>
smoothly transitions without any sharp edges into the curvature of the opposing walls<br>
in the second section in the region of smallest cross-section area of the gas passage.<br>
The opposing walls in the second section of the gas passage may be curved such that<br>
the hot wall has a convex shape that curves away from the second bisecting surface<br>
and the cold wall has a concave shape that curves towards the second bisecting<br>
surface as viewed from within the second section in the gas passage. The ratio of the<br>
radius of curvature of the hot wall to the radius of curvature of the cold wall in the<br>
second section of the gas passage ranges from about 1:10,000 to about 100:1. The<br>
gas stream is introduced into the gas passage at a mass flow rate ranging from about<br>
150 kilogram per hour per meter to about 3500 kilogram per hour per meter.<br>
[0020]	The nozzle used in the processes described herein for making nonwoven<br>
webs comprising sub-micron fibers represents another embodiment of the present<br>
invention. The inventive nozzle device is not limited to any particular type of polymer<br>
material or fibrillating gas and allows for the polymer to be independently selected for a<br>
specific application from amongst a wide variety of polymeric materials. Particularly the<br>
fibrillating gas is a gaseous material such as air, nitrogen, steam, etc. The gas may be<br>
used as a single type thereof or as combinations of different gases. Additionally<br>
suitable gases may include reactive gases or gases with reactive components, or<br>
combinations thereof. In embodiments, the gas generally may be inert to the nozzle<br>
wall materials. For purposes herein, the terms "nozzle system" and "nozzle" are used<br>
interchangeably.<br>
-9-<br><br>
[0021]	The high quality microfibers provided by the present invention are<br>
provided within narrow fiber size distributions with minimal fiber defects. The raw<br>
nonwoven web product materials directly collected from the process of the present<br>
invention generally may comprise more than 35%, particularly more than 75%, and<br>
more particularly more than 99% sub-micron fibers. The standard deviation of fiber<br>
diameter distribution generally may be less than about 0.5 micron, particularly less<br>
than about 0.3 micron. The present invention also may be used in production of<br>
microfibers in the range of meltblown fibers. The present invention can be<br>
implemented on a wide variety polymer materials. The fibers may be comprised of a<br>
polymer, e.g., selected from amongst polyolefins, polyesters, polyamides,<br>
biodegradable polymers, polyurethanes, polystyrenes, alkyd resins, poly-<br>
hydroxyalkanoic acids, adhesives and other compounds capable of making fibers, and<br>
combinations thereof. The nonwoven web may be used in a wide variety of articles by<br>
itself or in combination with other materials. The nonwoven web may be used, for<br>
example, in filters, medical apparel, medical cleaning wipes, housewrap construction<br>
materials, bandages, protective clothing, battery separators, catalyst carrier, diapers,<br>
training pants, adult incontinence pads, catamenials products such as feminine care<br>
pads and pantiliners, tampons, personal cleansing articles, personal care articles, and<br>
personal care wipes such as baby wipes, facial wipes, body wipes and feminine wipes,<br>
and combinations thereof.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
[0040]	While the present invention is susceptible of embodiment in various<br>
forms, there is shown in the drawings and will hereinafter be described a presently<br>
preferred embodiment of the invention, with the understanding that the present<br>
disclosure is to be considered as an exemplification of the invention, and is not<br>
intended to limit the invention to the specific embodiment illustrated.<br>
[0041]	Referring to FIG. 1, a general nozzle system 800 is depicted for making<br>
fibers, and by way of example, an annular, axisymmetric system is shown. Gas is<br>
pressurized in element 700, from which gas stream 3 is supplied and enters a first<br>
nozzle section 8 having a generally converging geometry and flows towards and<br>
through a transition region 9, and then the gas stream enters into and expands in a<br>
second nozzle section 10 having generally diverging geometry before leaving the<br>
nozzle system through the exit plane 101 into the atmospheric environment 900. The<br>
-12-<br><br>
transition region 9 represents a narrowed throat section of the nozzle in which the<br>
upstream converging section is transitioned into the downstream diverging section.<br>
The transition region or throat includes the smallest cross-sectional area of the nozzle.<br>
Polymer melt is fed from a polymer extrusion body 801 or other molten polymer source<br>
to the gas passage 802 or interior of the nozzle 800. As indicated by the non-limiting<br>
dashed lines 804-805 depicted in the figure, polymer melt can be introduced anywhere<br>
in the nozzle 800 provided that a polymer film is provided on an inner heated wall<br>
surface 803 of the nozzle 800 that is impinged by the gas stream 3 flowing within the<br>
gas passage 802, effective to fibrillate the polymer film into sub-micron diameter fibers.<br>
[0042]	Referring to FIG. 2, a nozzle system 1 is illustrated for making<br>
microfibers, and particularly nonwoven products comprising sub-micron diameter<br>
fibers in web or mat form, acccording to embodiments of the present invention. The<br>
nozzle system 1 shown in FIG 2 depicts a symmetric gas passage 4, by way of<br>
example. A polymer fluid stream 2 is introduced into nozzle system 1 along a curved,<br>
straight or other geometrically-suitable polymer passageway 200. An imaginary<br>
bisecting axis or plane 7 geometrically bisects the space between the opposing walls<br>
51 and 61 in the first section 8, and also the opposing walls 5 and 6 in second section<br>
10. As can be appreciated, if the opposing walls are rectilinear (i.e., generally planar)<br>
sloped surfaces, then the bisector 7 is a plane, while if the opposing walls curve to<br>
provide a continuous concentric surface, then the bisector 7 is a longitudinal axis. If<br>
they are opposing sloped generally planar walls, then space-apart upright forward and<br>
rearward sidewalls are also provided that connect the opposing sloped walls (5, 6, and<br>
51, 61), effective to complete the enclosure of gas passage 4 in an fluid-tight manner.<br>
For example, a rear side wall 43 is indicated in FIG. 2. The corresponding forward side<br>
wall is similar but not shown in FIG. 2 to simplify this illustration.<br>
[0043]	With further reference to FIG. 12, the same nozzle system 1 is illustrated<br>
in a manner showing rear side wall 43 and a forward side wall 44. The walls 43 and 44<br>
are joined in a fluid-tight manner to opposite ends 1210/1211 and 1221/1222 of die<br>
-13-<br><br>
components 121 and 122, respectively, which include the above-described opposing<br>
walls that define the gas passage extending through the first and second sections of<br>
the nozzle. The die and end wall components can be made of material, e.g., polymer,<br>
metal, ceramic, etc., that can be shaped, e.g., by molding, casting, machining, etc. into<br>
the appropriate shapes, and are components which can tolerate the microfiber<br>
production process conditions, such as described herein. In FIG. 12, the location and<br>
shape of the stacked dual-funnel shape defined by the opposing walls is traced with<br>
imaginary lines at the end walls 43 and 44 to facilitate the illustration, although it will be<br>
appreciated that the end walls 43 and 44 close off the gas passage 4 and the rearward<br>
and forward opposite ends of the nozzle. As illustrated in FIG. 12, the upper nozzle<br>
inlet 41 is space defined between upper edges 510 and 610 of dies 121 and 122,<br>
respectively. The nozzle exit 42 is space defined between lower edges 500 and 600 of<br>
dies 121 and 122, respectively.<br>
[0044]	FIGS. 13 and 14 show a nozzle inlet cross-sectional area 1001<br>
(indicated by cross-sectioned area in FIG. 13 defined between edges 610 and 510)<br>
and nozzle exit cross-sectional area 1002 (indicated by cross-sectioned area in FIG.<br>
14 defined between edges 500 and 600) of the nozzle inlet opening 41 and exit<br>
opening 42, respectively, defined by the die components 121 and 122. Also shown in<br>
FIG. 13 is an intermediate cross-sectional area 1003 defined between opposing wall<br>
locations 1004 and 1005 (indicated by hatched lines) located between nozzle inlet 41<br>
and the transition region 9 of the nozzle. Also shown in FIG. 14 is an intermediate<br>
cross-sectional area 1006 defined between opposing wall locations 1007 and 1008<br>
(indicated by hatched lines) located between the transition region 9 and the nozzle exit<br>
42 of the nozzle. In FIGS. 13 and 14, die edges defining the gas passage that are not<br>
visible in the given view have locations indicated generally by dashed lines.<br>
[0045]	As illustrated, the cross-sectional area of the first section 8 is decreasing,<br>
preferably at least substantially continuously, in the downstream direction between the<br>
inlet 41 through intermediate area 1003 and further uniil reaching the transition region<br>
-14-<br><br>
9. The cross-sectional area of jthe second section 10 is increasing, preferably at least<br>
substantially continuously, in the downstream direction between the transition region 9<br>
through intermediate area 1006 and further until reaching the exit opening 42 of the<br>
nozzle. In a particular embodiment, the first section 8 of the gas passage 4 has a<br>
monotonically decreasing cross-sectional area 1001 from the supply end 41 to the<br>
lower discharge end 410 of the first section 8, i.e., the beginning of the transition<br>
region 9, and the second section 10 of the gas passage 4 has a monotonically<br>
increasing cross-sectional area 1002 from the entrance 420 or beginning of the<br>
second section 10 (i.e., the lower end of transition region 9) to the exit end 42 of the<br>
second section 10. These criteria also are used in the following additional<br>
embodiments of the present invention.<br>
[0046]	Referring now to FIG. 3, multiple polymer fluid streams 2 also may be<br>
introduced concurrently from multiple corresponding polymer introduction passages<br>
200a-d that feed into gas passage 4. The number of polymer fluid streams is not<br>
limited other than by practical constraints of a given nozzle set-up. A pressurized gas<br>
stream 3 is introduced within gas passage 4 and flows in a direction 30 from upstream<br>
nozzle section 8 through transition region 9 to downstream nozzle section 10. The first<br>
and second opposing walls 5, 6 comprise first section 8 and a second section 10. The<br>
first and second opposing walls 5, 6 converge in the first section 8 towards the<br>
transition region or throat section 9, which is the narrowest cross-section of the gas<br>
passage 4, as measured in a direction normal to the imaginary bisecting plane 7<br>
between nozzle inlet 41 and nozzle exit 42. Thus the throat section 9 connects the first<br>
section 8 to the second section 10 and conduits gas from one section to the other. At<br>
least one of the opposing walls 5 or 6 diverges from plane 7 in the second section 10.<br>
In this illustration, the first section 8 has a continuously, progressively decreasing<br>
cross-sectional area 65 measured between the opposing walls 51 and 61 in the gas<br>
flow direction 30 from inlet 41 to throat 9. The second section 10 has continuously,<br>
progressively increasing cross-sectional area 66 measured between opposing 5 and 6<br>
-15-<br><br>
in the gas flow direction 30 from throat 9 to exit 42. These cross-sectional areas 65<br>
and 66 are measured normal to the plane 7 between the opposing walls (i.e., 51, 61 or<br>
5, 6, as applicable) in the direction of the gas flow 3. The polymer fluid streams 2 leave<br>
the polymer introduction passage 200 or passages 200a-d at the polymer passage<br>
openings 20 and flow put on the opposing walls 5 and 6, and are combined with the<br>
high velocity gas stream 3, preferably in the second section 10 of the gas passage 4,<br>
to form films 11, i.e., polymer melt exiting the polymer passage openings spreads into<br>
rivulets in the form of a film or otherwise uniformly spread out polymer fluid. The film<br>
or films are fibrillated to form fibers 12 comprising sub-micron diameter fibers that are<br>
collected below the nozzle system 1 as a fibrous web or mat material 13. The amount<br>
of fibrillation of films 11 from polymer fluid streams 2 may be different depending on<br>
the location of passages 200a-d in the gas passage 4. In a non-limiting embodiment,<br>
fibrillated polymer melt in the form of continuous or discrete melt filaments or melt<br>
particles, e.g., due to excessive shearing of films 11 from passages 200b and 200c,<br>
may combine with fibrillated polymer melt films 11 from passages 200a and 200d,<br>
respectively. In such embodiment, if polymer fluid streams 200b and 200c are<br>
respectively of dissimilar polymer types from polymer fluid streams 200a and 200d, the<br>
fibrous web material may comprise of multi-componen|t fibers, or more specifically<br>
bicomponent fibers. The introduction of the polymer melt in the second section of the<br>
nozzle system on a heated diverging support wall has been found to especially<br>
facilitate production of high quality, high content sub-micron fibers and resulting webs<br>
at commercial throughputs. The polymer passage openings 20 into the gas passage 4<br>
can have oval, round, rectangular or other geometric cross-sections. There may be<br>
single or multiple polymer passage openings into the gas passage on either opposing<br>
surface/wall. The single or multiple openings in the preferred embodiment are on the<br>
hotter sides, the polymer melt-side (e.g., see FIG. 6 described in greater detail below).<br>
-16-<br><br>
[0047]	Referring again to FIG. 3, it has been found that the location of the<br>
polymer passage opening 20 for making high quality fibers depends on the type of gas<br>
used.the geometry of the nozzle sections, and the pressure of the gas. In one<br>
preferred embodiment, the pressure of the entering gas is relatively low, less than<br>
about 10 psi, and the extruded polymer film joins with the gas in the upper half (50%)<br>
of the second, downstream section 10, indicated as section 101, in which polymer melt<br>
is extruded from gas passage 200c. It has been found in this case that the upper half<br>
of the downstream second section 10 can provide an optimal gas velocity region<br>
where melt film fibrillation is accomplished very efficiently, yielding higher quality<br>
microfiber product. Consequently, it is a preferred embodiment in the case of pressure<br>
of the entering gas, exceeding about 10 to 15 psi, that the extruded polymer film joins<br>
with the gas in the lower, downstream half (50%) of the second, downstream section<br>
10, indicated as remainder after section 101, in which polymer melt is extruded from<br>
gas passage 200a. As the gas, pressure is increased, the preferred location for joining<br>
the gas and polymer streams moves downstream, i.e. from passage 200c to passage<br>
200b to passage 200d and to passage 200a for the highest range of gas pressures.<br>
[0048]	The fibrous web 13, such as shown in FIGS. 2-3, may be comprised of a<br>
pile of loose fibers or alternatively a self-supporting unitary web of fibers, depending on<br>
process conditions such as temperature, collector distance 100, and so forth. The<br>
fibers may also be deposited on a moving substrate web to form an additional layer.<br>
Collection of the fibers discharged from the nozzle system 1 may be done, e.g., onto a<br>
belt or substrate 300 aided by a vacuum underneath the belt or substrate or other<br>
means to keep the fibers deposited on the belt or substrate until further processing.<br>
The fiber collecting structure may be, e.g., a mesh or belt across which a vacuum pulls<br>
the fibers onto the structure. It pan also comprise a preformed fibrous web. It is<br>
obvious to those skilled in the art that the nozzle system can be of essentially slot<br>
design or of annular design with minor modifications. Although FIGS. 2 and 3 show a<br>
-17-<br><br>
nozzle with essentially flat and symmetric geometry, that is shown only for simple non-<br>
limiting illustration purposes.<br>
[0049]	FIG. 4 shows more details of a nozzle system 1, and in this illustration<br>
shows a system with a colder apparatus side that is bounded by the colder first<br>
opposing wall 5, and a hotter apparatus side containing the polymer melt components<br>
that is bounded by the hotter second opposing wall 6. An axis or plane 7 geometrically<br>
bisects the space between the opposing walls 5 and 6 in the first section 8, thus also<br>
defining the contraction bisection or half-angles a. Preferably, the bisection angle a is<br>
between 0.5 and 89.5 degrees, more preferably between 1 and 45 degrees, and most<br>
preferably between 15 and 40 (degrees. In one of the embodiments the bisection a is<br>
about 30 degrees. The opposing wall 6 diverges from the axis or plane 7 in the second<br>
section 10, while the overall crdss-sectional area 66 of the gas passage 4 in the<br>
second section 10, as measured in a direction normal to the direction 30 of gas flow,<br>
actually still increases, allowing the gas to expand after the throat section 9. The<br>
opposing colder wall 5 is generally converging with respect to the axis or plane 7 at an<br>
angle 9. The angle p is measured from the hotter opposing wall 6 to the bisecting axis i<br>
or plane 7, and the angle  is measured from the axis or plane 7 to the colder	:<br>
opposing wall 5. Therefore, the angle  is zero if the opposing wall 5 is parallel to the<br>
bisecting axis or plane 7, and negative if it is converging, and positive if it is diverging.<br>
The opposing wall 6 has a diverging angle p that should generally be from about 1<br>
degree to less than about 90 degrees relative to the axis or plane 7, or preferably from<br>
about 2 to less than about 20 degrees. In one embodiment this diverging angle p is<br>
approximately 15 degrees. The opposing wall 5 has a diverging angle that should be<br>
less than about +45 degrees relative to the axis or plane 7, but preferably has a<br>
converging angle that is from about -45 degrees to about zero degree. The sum of p<br>
and  should preferably be from about 0.1 degree to about 30 degrees. Polymer is<br>
directed through the polymer introduction passages 200 and exiting into the gas<br>
-18-<br><br>
passage 4 through one or more polymer passage openings 20 and flowing in the form<br>
of film, rivulets, or hollow tubes, and preferably film, onto the polymer fiberization<br>
surfaces 63, also referred to as impingement surfaces. The polymer melt passages<br>
200 can be at various angles y with respect to the hotter opposing wall 6, anywhere<br>
from perpendicular (90 degrees) to almost parallel (co-flowing) to the hotter opposing<br>
wall surface 6 (about 5 degrees) or counterflowing at about 170 degrees, but<br>
preferably from 10 to 100 degrees. The polymer fiberization surface 63 is present<br>
below (in the direction of gas flow) each polymer passage opening 20 and has a<br>
smooth continuation of the second opposing wall 6 from before the introduction of the<br>
polymer melt 2, and on which the polymer melt flows out before and during fiberization<br>
by the gas stream 4. If the polymer fiberization surface 63 is not a smooth continuation<br>
of the second opposing hotter wall 6, then it can be at an angle § that is measured<br>
between the polymer fiberization surface below each polymer passage opening in the<br>
direction of polymer flow and the respective polymer passage 2, and is less than about<br>
180 degrees. With an angle  of (90 - ) degrees or leaser relative to polymer passage<br>
(in an embodiment with y less than 90 degrees), the polymer fiberization surface 63<br>
would essentially become zero. Alternatively, the orientation of the polymer fiberization<br>
surface may be measured relative to the bisecting plane or axis 7. When measured<br>
relative to the bisecting plane or axis 7, the polymer fiberization surface orientation<br>
angle ranges from about 90 degrees measured in clockwise direction to about 45<br>
degrees measured in counterclockwise direction. The length "5" of the polymer<br>
fiberization surface 63 is critical for a good fiberization process with few fiber defects<br>
such as shot etc., and should be less than about one thousand times the hydraulic<br>
diameter of the respective polymer passage opening 20, but preferably less than one<br>
hundred times the hydraulic diameter of the respective polymer passage opening 20.<br>
A reason for this configuration example is that the opposing wall 6 is heated to keep<br>
the pressurized polymer stream 2 molten and flowing. The heated wall 6 in the second<br>
section 10 of the gas passage 4 has a diverging angle  of less than 45 degrees from<br>
-19-<br><br>
the central, bisecting axis 7, preferably from about 1 to 20 degrees. The colder,<br>
unheated wall 5 opposite to the heated wall 6 in the second section 10 of the gas<br>
passage 4 may have a converging angle  of less than 30 degrees from the central<br>
axis 7, particularly from about 0.1 to 15 degrees. The ratio, /, of the diverging angle<br>
P to the converging angle  of the opposing walls 6 and 5, respectively, in the second<br>
section 10 of the gas passage 4 ranges between 1:1 to 500:1. The cross-sectional<br>
inner geometry of the throat 9 may be, e.g., rectangular shaped if the opposing walls<br>
are sloped (e.g., see FIG. 2), or alternatively may be rounded if curved opposing walls<br>
are used that form a continuous curved inner boundary defining the gas passage. In<br>
another embodiment, the gas passage 4 comprises an annular cross-sectional space<br>
located between walls 5 and 6. The walls in FIG. 4 are shown as sloped, flat and<br>
planar, however the walls in the various sections may be curved. This may be done for<br>
walls 5 and 6 in either the first, or the second or the throat sections, or a combination<br>
of them. A particular, non-limiting embodiment is presented in the following<br>
description.<br>
[0050]	Referring to FIG. 5, in another embodiment of the nozzle system 1, the<br>
opposing walls 6 and 5 in the second section 10 of the gas passage 4 are curved. The<br>
curved portion may have a vertical dimension 102 of about 0.004 inch to about 2 inch,<br>
and the melt passage 200 may have a hydraulic diameter of about 0.001 inch to 0.100<br>
inch. The ratio, r1/r2, of the radius of curvature r1 of the hotter wall 6 to the radius of<br>
curvature r2 of the colder wall in the second section 10 of the gas passage 4 may<br>
range between 1:10,000 to about 100:1.<br>
[0051]	Referring to FIG. 6, in another embodiment of the nozzle system 1, the<br>
geometry of the heated wall 6 is similar to that described in connection with FIG. 5<br>
above. However, in this embodiment, the throat section 9 of the gas passage 4 has<br>
greater length in comparison to the embodiments of FIGS. 2-4. The wall 5 opposite to<br>
the heated wall 6 converges towards the bisecting axis or plane 7 at an angle <br>
typically ranging from about 0.1 degree to about 15 degrees. The heated wall 6<br>
-20-<br><br>
diverges from the plane 7 at an angle  typically ranging from about 1 to about 20<br>
degrees. As best seen in FIG. 7, the polymer fluid stream 2 enters the second section<br>
10 of the gas passage 4 through one or a multiplicity of openings 20, and is directed at<br>
an angle  that can range from about 10 to 170 degrees, but is typically ranging from<br>
about 30 to about 150 degrees, particularly about 60 to about 95 degrees, relative to<br>
the second, hotter wall 6. As shown, the heated wall 16 comprises a tip portion 65<br>
immediately below a polymer introduction passage 2. The integral tip portion 65 has a<br>
polymer fiberization surface length less than about 0.050 inch, more preferably less<br>
than about 0.010 inch. The curved portion 64 is located immediately below the tip<br>
portion 65 curves away from the central axis 7 in the downstream direction 30, and the<br>
wall 5 opposite to the heated wall converges towards plane 7 along wall portion 151<br>
thereof and at a location laterally spaced from and adjacent the lower end of tip portion<br>
152 is bent back to form the angle 90+ with plane 7. The curved portion 64 defines<br>
the tip portion 65 at its upper end and also helps prevent gas disruption within the gas<br>
passage 4 near the polymer introduction passage 2. The tip portion 65 enhances sub-<br>
micron fiber formation. In this illustration, the tip portion 65 has a side 63 facing the<br>
gas passage 4 that may be substantially flat and defines the polymer fiberization<br>
length 8. When angles ,  and  are not in the ranges prescribed herein, the process<br>
may be adversely impacted. For instance, it can negatively impact fiberization, fiber<br>
sizes, and increase undesirable shot formation. As a non-limiting illustration, the tip<br>
portion 65 may have a vertical length or impingement length  of approximately 0.005 -<br>
0.050 inch, the curved portion 64 may have a vertical dimension of about 0.040 - 0.100<br>
inch or greater, and the melt passage 2 may have a hydraulic diameter of about 0.001<br>
to about 0.010 inch, and preferably from 0.002 to about 0.008 inch.<br>
[0052]	Referring to FIGS. 8-9, the first and second walls (5, 6, and 51, 61) of the<br>
gas passage 4 of these alternate configurations of nozzle 1 are smoothly curved such<br>
that the curvature of the opposing walls 5, 6 in the first section 8 smoothly transitions<br>
in the transition region 9 of the gas passage 4 without any sharp edges into the<br>
-21-<br><br>
curvature of the opposing walls 51, 61 in the second section 10 where polymer 2 is<br>
introduced in this illustration, the opposing walls in the second section 10 of the gas<br>
passage 4 are curved such that the hot wall 6 has a convex shape that curves away<br>
from the curvilinear bisecting surface 7 and the cold wall 5 has a concave shape that<br>
curves towards the curvilinear bisecting surface 7 as viewed from within the second<br>
section 10 in the gas passage 4. The ratio of the radius of curvature of the hot wall 6<br>
to the radius of curvature of the cold wall 5 in the second section 10 of the gas<br>
passage 4 may range from about 1:10,000 to about 100:1, particularly about 1:4 to<br>
about 1:1, and more particularly about 1:2 to about 1:1. The radii of curvature of the<br>
first and the second walls 51, 61 in the first second section 8 may range from about<br>
1 % to about 1000% of the length of the first and the second walls 5, 6 in the second<br>
section 10 of the gas passage 4. Each polymer introduction opening 20 particularly<br>
may be located in the hot wall 6 in the second section 10. Each polymer opening 20<br>
also may be located between about 20% to about 80% of the curvilinear length of the<br>
hot wall 6 in the second section 10 of the gas passage 4. The polymer film can be<br>
extruded into the second section 10 through each polymer opening 20 at angle<br>
ranging from about 20 degrees to about 160 degrees with respect to the tangent at the<br>
hot wall 6 in the second section 10 of the gas passage 4.<br>
[0053]	Referring to FIGS. 10-11, the first and second walls (5, 6, and 51,61) of<br>
the gas passage 4 of these alternate configurations of nozzle 1 are sloped and planar<br>
and the transition region 9 is an asymmetric bent configuration located between the<br>
upstream section 8 and downstream section 10 where polymer 2 is introduced in this<br>
illustration.<br>
[0054]	The nozzle devices used to practice the processes described herein are<br>
configurable to be a cartridge that is mountable to conventional die bodies.<br>
Conventional die bodies may vary. However, industry standard machine practice can<br>
be followed to mount the cartridge embodying the inventive nozzle to a die body. For<br>
example, the die bearing the nozzle can be mounted to a die body with a conventional<br>
-22-<br><br>
bolt arrangement and flat/shaped surfaces. If a gasket/seal is needed, the channel is<br>
machined in the top of the die and/or the location is defined per specific die body. For<br>
example, the nozzle system of the present invention may be adapted to fit the lower<br>
extrusion body of standard meltspun equipment, e.g., equipment supplied by suppliers<br>
such as Reifenhauser, Ason-Neumag, Lurgi Zimmer, Accurate Products, Nordson, and<br>
Impianti. Pressurized gas may be supplied to the nozzle system via gas manifolds<br>
used in combination with extruder bodies in conventional or commercial equipment or<br>
via another source of compressed gas fed to the nozzle inlet via air-tight fluid conduits<br>
and connections.<br>
[0055]	To implement the processes of the invention using the nozzle systems<br>
and support equipment illustrated above, the polymer generally is heated until it forms<br>
a liquid and flows easily. As indicated in the figures, the polymer melt is introduced into<br>
the second section 10 of the gas passage 4 of the nozzle system 1 via opening 20,<br>
and forms a film as it descends along the wall surface 6 where located below the<br>
opening 20, such as described above. To form the polymer melt, the polymer is heated<br>
sufficiently to form a molten polymer flow. By way of example and not limitation, the<br>
melted polymer may have a viscosity at the point of fiberization in the nozzle as a<br>
positive numerical value less than 30 Pa-s, particularly less than 20 Pa-s, and may<br>
range from 0.1 to 20 Pa-s, andi particularly from 0.2 to 15. These viscosities are given<br>
over a shear rate ranging from about 100 to about 100,000 per second (at 240°C). The<br>
melted polymer generally is at a pressure exceeding atmospheric pressure at the time<br>
is conducted through the gap in the polymer die and is introduced into the gas<br>
passage of the nozzle design.<br>
[0056]	The suitable and optimal melt flow rates of the starting polymer material<br>
used to provide the polymer melt may vary depending on the type of polymer material '■,<br>
used and other process conditions such as the gas flow properties. In the instance of<br>
polypropylene having a glass transition temperature of approximately minus 18°C, a<br>
suitable melt flow rate may range, e.g., from about 35 to greater than 2000 decigram<br>
-23-<br><br>
per minute, preferably not greater than 1800. The melt flow rate is measured using<br>
ASTM method D-1238. If the polymer material used is polypropylene, it may have a<br>
polydispersity index (PDI) that ranges, e.g., from about 2.0 to about 4.0. For<br>
purposes herein, PDI is a measure of the distribution of molecular weights in a given<br>
polymer sample, where the PDI calculated is the weight average molecular weight<br>
divided by the number average molecular weight.<br>
[0057]	The polymer throughput in the inventive process and apparatus will<br>
primarily depend upon the specific polymer used, the nozzle design, and the<br>
temperature and pressure of the polymer. The aggregate polymer throughput of the<br>
nozzle system 1 is more than about 1 kg/hr/m, particularly may range from 1 to 200<br>
kg/hr/m, more particularly from 10 to 200 kg/hr/m, and most particularly between 25<br>
and 70 kg/hr/m. Per orifice, the polymer throughput can be more than about 1,<br>
particularly more than about 5Q, and more particularly more than about 1000 gram per<br>
minute per orifice. There can be several introduction gaps or orifices operating at one<br>
time to increase the total production throughput. The throughput, along with pressure,<br>
temperature, and velocity, are measured at the die orifice exit. An gas curtain or other<br>
ancillary gas stream can also be used to affect the spray pattern of sub-micron fibers<br>
from two or more nozzles. This gas stream or curtain may aid in shielding the spray<br>
formations between adjacent nozzles or may aid in compressing the spray pattern.<br>
The gas curtain or stream may improve the uniformity of the web.<br>
[0058]	The inventive nozzle system is not limited to any particular type of<br>
polymer material and allows for the polymer to be independently selected for a specific<br>
product application from amongst a wide variety of polymeric materials. Suitable<br>
polymeric materials for formation of the fibrous webs of the present invention are those<br>
polymers capable of being fibriJIated into microfibers using the nozzles of the present<br>
invention. These polymers include, but are not limited to polymers selected from the<br>
group consisting of polyolefins, polyesters, polyamides, biodegradable polymers,<br>
polyurethanes, polystyrenes, alkyd resins, poly-hydroxyalkanoic acids, adhesives or<br>
-24-<br><br>
other compounds capable of making fibers, and combinations thereof. Particular<br>
examples of the polymeric materials are, e.g., polypropylenes. The polymers may be<br>
further selected from homopolymers; copolymers, and conjugates and may include<br>
those polymers having incorporated melt additives or surface-active agents or<br>
pigments. More than one polymer type may be used at one time via the use of<br>
multiple polymer passages 200a-d as illustrated in FIG 3. In such embodiment, a web<br>
13 comprising multicomponent sub-micron fibers may be produced, as described<br>
earlier.<br>
[0059]	The gaseous fluid may be introduced into the nozzle system at a<br>
i<br>
temperature less than that of the polymer melt, and particularly below 100°C, more<br>
particularly less than 50°C, or otherwise at room temperature (e.g., about 30°C, or<br>
less). The gaseous fluid also may be heated, although not required for processes of<br>
the present invention. Non-limiting examples of the fiberizing gaseous fluid are gases<br>
such as air, nitrogen, steam, etc. Additionally suitable gases may include reactive<br>
gases or gases with reactive components, or combinations thereof. The pressure of<br>
the fiberizing (i.e., fibrillating) gaseous fluid is a positive pressure sufficient to blow the<br>
sub-micron fibers and can be slightly above the pressure of the melted polymer as it is<br>
extruded out of the gap from which it is introduced into the gas passage of the nozzle<br>
system. The fiberizing gaseous fluid will generally have a pressure below 1000 psi,<br>
particularly will be less than 100 psi, more particularly will be from about 15 to about<br>
80 psi. The gas flow rate used is sufficient to shear the polymer film at a sufficient rate<br>
to fibrillate. The gas flow rate through the nozzle system generally is in the range of<br>
150 kilogram per hour per meter to about 3500 kilogram per hour per meter,<br>
particularly 600 to 2000 kilogram per hour per meter; more particularly 1000 to 1800<br>
kilogram per hour per meter. In terms of gas mass flux, measured as unit mass of gas<br>
flowing per unit time per unit area, the gas flow ranges from about 15 kg/s/m2 to about<br>
1500 kg/s/m2 depending on the separation between the opposing walls 5 and 6 in<br>
throat section 9 and gas flow rate used. For purposes herein, the cross-section of the<br>
-25-<br><br>
transition region 9 of the nozzle 1 generally is used for the calculations of gas mass<br>
flux.<br>
[0060]	As one benefit of the present invention, increased sub-micron fiber<br>
output is obtained with lower gas demand, making it feasible to reduce energy<br>
consumption and/or use smaller scale unit operations to still provide commercially<br>
significant sub-micron fiber output levels. In one embodiment, the gas stream and<br>
polymer fluid stream are introduced into the second section at a gas stream/polymer<br>
fluid stream mass flow rate ratio generally less than about 40:1, particularly less than<br>
about 30:1; more particularly less than about 15:1. In one embodiment, the gas<br>
stream to polymer fluid stream mass flow ratio may be even less than 10:1. The gas<br>
stream to polymer fluid stream mass flow ratio is calculated as kilogram per hour per<br>
meter of gas stream through the gas passage to kilogram per hour per meter of<br>
polymer fluid stream through all the polymer openings in the second section.<br>
Equivalently, the gas stream to polymer fluid stream mass flux ratio is less than about<br>
20:1, more preferably less than about 10:1, and most preferably less than about 7:1.<br>
The gas stream/polymer fluid stream mass flux ratio is calculated as kg/s/m2 of gas<br>
mass flux through the gas passage to the kg/s/m2 of polymer fluid mass flux flowing<br>
through all the polymer openings in the second section of the gas passage. Therefore,<br>
improved performance is provided via a more efficient, lower cost process delivering<br>
higher quality microfiber or sub-micron fiber webs at commercially viable outputs.<br>
Among other advantages, the process is more efficient as it prevents polymer back<br>
flow and/or build-up on the gas-side in the fiber forming process. The resulting product<br>
web or mat is high quality, as the web possesses good uniformity even at sub-micron<br>
fiber sizes, and with less fiber and web defects.<br>
[0061]	High quality microfibers are provided by the present invention within<br>
narrow fiber size distributions with minimal fiber defectfe. For purposes herein, a "high<br>
quality" fiber is defined as predominantly sub-micron fibers in a narrow fiber diameter<br>
distribution with minimal fiber defects such as shot and dust. "Shot" is defined as<br>
-26-<br><br>
unfiberized discrete, largely spherical or ellipsoidal or combinations thereof polymer<br>
mass with the largest dimension of the discrete mass ranging from 10 to 500 microns.<br>
By way of non-limiting illustration, FIG. 15 is a representative view (500x) showing<br>
microfibers with shot produced with standard fiber making equipment and process<br>
conditions. The shot creates and leaves large pores and other defects in web formed<br>
by the microfibers. FIG. 16 is a representative view (500x) showing microfibers with<br>
very little or no shot made with a nozzle system operated according to an embodiment<br>
of the present invention. A good fiber distribution is provided and more efficient<br>
polymer-fiber and web quality conversion is attained in the fibrous web shown in FIG.<br>
16. "Dust" is another fiber defect, where polymer is sheared uncontrolled or<br>
excessively to largely spherical or ellipsoidal or combinations thereof polymer mass<br>
with the largest dimension of less than 10 micron. An undesired, low quality of fiber<br>
may have an excessive range of fiber diameters, or contain large amount of dust or<br>
large amounts of shot. A particularly low quality of fiber, or effect of fiberization, can<br>
contain large shot, typically greater than 40 micron in diameter, wherein the mass has<br>
enough momentum and thermal energy (i.e., temperature) to penetrate through the<br>
entire thickness of the nonwoven web to form a distinct "pin hole" defect therein that<br>
can be visually identified well under magnified examination (i.e., over 10 times or 10X)<br>
of the web. Therefore, a web made from high quality fiberization, and fibers, has a<br>
narrow fiber diameter distribution, no or only a low amount of dust below an average of<br>
10 particles per square-millimeter, no or a low amount of shot below an average of 10<br>
particles per square-millimeter and no or negligible amount of penetrating and pin-<br>
hole creating type of shot. These measurements and evaluations can be done using<br>
optical microscopes with magnification of 10X or preferably 100X (for shot), and with<br>
scanning electron microscope photographs (for dust and shot). To determine an<br>
average, at least ten or preferably over twenty samples need to be taken from a<br>
production condition or a selected production period and evaluated in this manner for<br>
dust and shot.<br>
-27-<br><br>
[0062]	The fibrous webs produced in accordance with the present invention may<br>
include fibers exhibiting one or more fiber diameters. The fiber diameters can range<br>
from sub-micron fiber diameters up to microfiber diameters. For purposes herein "fiber<br>
diameter" is determined by SEM with image analysis. Although not limited thereto, the<br>
average fiber diameters may he, e.g., about 0.1 to abdut 1 micron, particularly about<br>
0.1 to about 0.9 micron, and more particularly about 0.3 to about 0.6 micron. The raw<br>
nonwoven web product materials directly collected from the process of the present<br>
invention generally may comprise more than 35%, particularly more than 75%, more<br>
particularly more than 95%, and more particularly more than 99% sub-micron fibers.<br>
The standard deviation of fiber diameter distribution generally may be less than about<br>
0.5 micron, particularly less than about 0.3 micron. Further, the nonwoven fabric of the<br>
present invention may exhibit basis weights ranging from very light to very heavy. For<br>
example, and not by way of limitation, the fabrics may have a basis weight ranging<br>
from less than about 5 grams per square meter (gsm), to fabrics having a basis weight<br>
greater than about 200 gsm. In a particular embodiment, nonwoven product webs<br>
comprising fibers in the indicated submicron fiber ranges have a basis weight of from<br>
about 0.01 to 200 gsm, particularly about 0.1 to about 50 gsm. The basis weight of the<br>
nonwoven web products may be varied depending on the web application envisioned.<br>
For some lighter weight applications, the basis weight of the sub-micron fiber layer<br>
may be, for example, less than about 10 gsm, depending upon use of the nonwoven<br>
web. It may be desirable to form a web of several superposed layers. The sub-micron<br>
fiber layer may be combined with one, two, or more same or different layers. A<br>
composite web could comprise, for example, a spunbond layer/sub-micron fiber<br>
layer/spunbond layer three-component construction. Another example composite web<br>
could be comprised of a spunbond layer/1-10 micron fiber meltblown layer/sub-micron<br>
melt-film-fibrillation fiber layer/spunbond layer construction. Basis weights for the total<br>
composite webs may range, for example, from about 5 gsm to about 200 or more gsm,<br>
but may vary depending on the number and types of layers assembled together.<br>
-28-<br><br>
[0063]	A uniform sub-micron fiber web can be produced by the process of the<br>
present invention. Web unifornhity can be measured through several methods. In<br>
addition to the shot and dust rate described above, other examples of uniformity<br>
metrics include low coefficient of variation of pore diameter, basis weight, air<br>
permeability, and/or opacity. Uniformity can also mean lack of fiber bundles or roping,<br>
or visible holes, or other such defects. Uniformity may also be evaluated by the<br>
hydrohead or other liquid barrier measurement of the web. Pore diameter can be	;<br>
determined by methods known to those skilled in the art. The mean pore diameter of<br>
the sub-micron fiber layer may be less than about 15 microns. The desired coefficient<br>
of variation for a uniform web can be less than 20%. The lack of roping can be<br>
measured by counting the number of ropes or bundles, of fibers in a measured area of<br>
the web; this is best done jointly with a shot and dust evaluation. The lack of holes can<br>
also be measured by counting the number of holes having a diameter above a certain<br>
threshold in a measured area of the web. An optical microscope with 10-100X<br>
magnification, or scanning electron microscope or other enlargement means can be<br>
used. For example, the holes may be counted if they are visible to the naked eye using<br>
a light box, or are more than 100 microns in diameter.<br>
[0064]	The present invention can be implemented on a wide variety polymer<br>
materials and the nonwoven web may be used in a wide variety of articles by itself or<br>
in combination with other materials. The nonwoven fabric produced in accordance with<br>
the invention may include one or more fibrous layers, as well as wovens, scrims, films,<br>
and combinations thereof, and may be utilized in the manufacture of numerous home<br>
cleaning, personal hygiene, midical, and other end use products where a nonwoven<br>
fabric can be employed. The nonwoven web may be used, for example, in gas or liquid<br>
filters, medical apparel, medical cleaning wipes, housewrap construction materials,<br>
diapers, training pants, adult incontinence pads, catamenials products such as<br>
feminine care pads and pantiliners, tampons, personal cleansing articles, personal<br>
care articles, and personal care wipes such as baby wipes, facial wipes, body wipes<br>
-29-<br><br>
and feminine wipes, and combinations thereof. In addition, the fabric may be utilized<br>
as medical gauze, or similar absorbent surgical materials, for absorbing wound<br>
exudates and assisting in the removal of seepage from surgical sites. Other end uses<br>
include wet or dry hygienic, anti-microbial, or hard surface wipes for medical,<br>
industrial, automotive, home care, food service, and graphic arts markets, which can<br>
be readily hand-held for cleaning and the like.<br>
[0065]	The nonwoven of the present invention also may be included in<br>
constructs suitable for medicalj and industrial protective apparel, such as gowns,<br>
drapes, shirts, bottom weights, lab coats, face masks, and the like, and protective<br>
covers, including covers for vehicles such as cars, trucks, boats, airplanes,<br>
motorcycles, bicycles, golf carts, as well as covers for equipment often left outdoors<br>
like grills, yard and garden equipment, such as mowers and roto-tillers, lawn furniture,<br>
floor coverings, table cloths, and picnic area covers. In particular embodiment, the<br>
nonwoven is used in an article selected from the group consisting of bandages,<br>
diapers, training pants, adult incontinence pads, catamenials products such as<br>
feminine care pads and pantiliners, tampons, personal cleansing articles, personal<br>
care articles, and personal care wipes such as baby wipes, facial wipes, body wipes<br>
and feminine wipes, and combinations thereof. The nonwoven may also be used in top<br>
of bed applications, including mattress protectors, comforters, quilts, duvet covers, and<br>
bedspreads. Additionally, acoustical applications, such as interior and exterior<br>
automotive components, carpet backing, insulative and sound dampening appliance<br>
and machinery wraps, and wall coverings. The nonwoven is further advantageous for<br>
various filtration applications, including bag house, plus pool and spa filters. The<br>
nonwoven also may be used in other applications, such as battery separators, or as<br>
agent/particle carriers (e.g., catalyst carriers).<br>
[0066]	Depending on the desired end use application of the nonwoven fabric,<br>
specific additives may be included directly into the polymeric melt or applied after<br>
formation of the web. Suitable non-limiting examples of such additives include<br>
-30-<br><br>
absorbency enhancing or deterring additives, UV stabilizers, fire retardants, dyes and<br>
pigments, fragrances, skin protectant, surfactants, aqueous or non-aqueous functional<br>
industrial solvents such as, plant oils, animal oils, terpenoids, silicon oils, mineral oils,<br>
white mineral oils, paraffinic sqlvents, polybutylenes, polyisobutylenes,<br>
polyalphaolefins, and mixtures thereof, toluenes, sequestering agents, corrosion<br>
inhibitors, abrasives, petroleum distillates, degreasers, and the combinations thereof.<br>
Additional additives include antimicrobial composition, including, but not limited to<br>
iodines, alcohols, such as such as ethanol or propanol, biocides, abrasives, metallic<br>
materials, such as metal oxide, metal salt, metal complex, metal alloy or mixtures<br>
thereof, bacteriostatic complexes, bactericidal complexes, and the combinations<br>
thereof.<br>
[0067]	All amounts, parts, ratios, and percentages described herein are by<br>
weight unless otherwise indicated. The following non-limiting example further<br>
illustrates the present invention.<br>
10068]	EXAMPLE<br>
[0069]	An extruder (2.5 inch diameter, single screw extruder) and a<br>
conventional melt blown die body (25 inch width) were used to provide a source<br>
of 1800 MFR polypropylene. The extruder temperature was 650°F. A nozzle generally<br>
having the configuration of FIG. 4 was mounted to a conventional extruder die body<br>
using a conventional gasketed bolt mount at an upper flat surface region on the nozzle<br>
device. A source of pressurized air was fed from an air supply to the inlet of the nozzle<br>
via air-tight connections and seals. The nozzle had the following geometrical features<br>
(using FIG 4 as a non-limiting example): an 0.016 inch as the minimum distance<br>
between opposing walls 5 and 6 in the throat section 9; cold wall 5 converging at an<br>
angle  of negative 1.5 degrees towards the bisecting plane 7; hot wall diverging away<br>
at an angle  of 2 degrees from the bisecting plane 7; the polymer passage entered<br>
the second section in the second, downstream half of the second section and had a<br>
hydraulic diameter of about 0.008 inch and was oriented at an angle  of about 32<br>
-31-<br><br>
degrees with the hot wall 6; the polymer fiberization surface length  was almost zero.<br>
The converging section 8 had a vertical length of about 0.090 inch with the bisection<br>
angle a about 30 degrees. The throat section 9 had a vertical length of about 0.010<br>
inch, and the diverging section 10 had a vertical length of about 0.200 inch. The<br>
pressurized air was introduced into the inlet end (converging section) of the nozzle at a<br>
flow rate of 300 scfm (standard cubic feet per minute) and at an air temperature of<br>
80°F. A nonwoven web product was collected and analyzed which revealed that it had<br>
the following product attributes: 17.2 gsm basis weight total of the spunbond-<br>
layer/submicron-fiber layer/spunbond-layer construction; estimated fiber content<br>
produced from the nozzle apparatus of current invention was about 15% ( 2.7 gsm );<br>
Mean diameter of the fibers in the submicron-fiber layer: 0.45 micron; standard<br>
deviation: 0.15; ratio of standard deviation/mean of sijbmicron fiber diameter<br>
distribution= 0.33; and fiber diameter range: 0.1 to 0.85 microns.<br>
[0070]	From the foregoing, it will be observed that numerous modifications and<br>
variations can be affected without departing from the true spirit and scope of the novel<br>
concept of the present invention. It is to be understood that no limitation with respect<br>
to the specific embodiments illustrated herein is intended or should be inferred. The<br>
disclosure is intended to cover, by the appended claims, all such modifications as fall<br>
within the scope of the claims.<br>
