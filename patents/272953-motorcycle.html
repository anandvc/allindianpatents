[Title of Invention] MOTORCYCLE<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
[0001]<br><br>
The present invention relates to a motorcycle, and particularly relates to a side stand and a kick arm of a motorcycle.<br><br>
[Background Art] <br>
[0002]<br><br>
A motorcycle whose engine is started by depressing a kick arm provided at a side of the engine is conventionally known (see Patent Literature 1, for example).  This conventional motorcycle is structured such that the kick arm contacts a main stand if the kick arm is depressed while the main stand is retracted. This is because the kick arm should be operated with a rear wheel raised by use of the main stand. <br><br>
[Citation List] <br>
[Patent Literature] <br>
[0003]<br><br>
[Patent Literature 1] Japanese Examined Patent Application Publication No. Hei 2-14991 [Summary of Invention] <br>
[Technical Problems] <br>
[0004]<br><br>
A motorcycle according to Patent Literature 1 is structured such that the kick arm is brought into contact with the main stand. Therefore, the arrangement of the kick arm and the main stand is limited, and thus the motorcycle has a low degree of freedom for arrangement of  components.  In addition, in order that the kick, arm may be brought into contact with the main stand, the main stand needs to be made large in the vehicle width direction or needs to be provided with a projection. This makes it difficult. to downsize the main stand. <br><br>
[10005]<br>
The present invention has bean made in view of such circumstances. An object of the present invention is to provide a motorcycle in which a degree of freedom for arrangement of components is improved and a main stand is downsized.<br><br>
[Solution to Problems] <br>
[0006]<br>
To achieve the above objective, a first aspect of the present invention provides a motorcycle comprising: a vehicle-body frame; a front wheel steerably supported on a front end portion of the vehicle-body frame; a rear wheel swingably supported on a rear portion of the vehicle-body frame; an engine supported below the vehicle-body frame;<br><br>
a main stand used when the motorcycle is parked with the rear wheel raised from the ground; a side stand used when the motorcycle is parked with the front wheel and the rear wheel resting on the ground; and a kick arm which is attached on a kick shaft protruding from the engine and which is depressed by a rider to start the engine. In this motor cycle, the length of the kick arm is set so that, when the motorcycle is parked using the side stand, the kick arm contacts the ground before reaching a rotation position at which the kick arm causes the engine to start. <br><br>
[0007]<br>
 In addition to the structure of the first aspect, a second aspect of the present invention is characterized in that the kick arm is arranged at the same side, in the vehicle width direction, as the side stand, <br><br>
[0008]<br>
In addition to the structure of the second aspect, a third aspect of the present invention is characterized in that: paired left and right steps are provided which are respectively arranged at both sides of a crankcase of the engine and on which the rider puts the feet; and the kick shaft is arranged below the steps. <br><br>
[0009]<br>
In addition to the structure of the third aspect, a fourth aspect of the present invention is characterized in that: a step bar is provided which is supported on a lower surface of the crankcase in front of the kick shaft and extends outward in the vehicle width direction from the lower surface of the crankcase, the steps being respectively provided on both end portions of the step bar/ and the step bar is arranged protruding within a rotation range of the kick arm. <br><br>
[0010]<br>
In addition to the structure of the second aspect, a fifth aspect of the present invention is characterized in that: the engine includes a generator cover which is provided at one side of the crankcase and which houses a generator in cooperation with the crankcase, and a transmission cover which is provided at the other side of the crankcase and which houses a transmission in cooperation with the crankcase; the kick arm is arranged at the same side as the generator cover; and when the kick arm is not used, a foot stepping portion of the kick arm is retracted to a position within the width of the generator cover in the vehicle width direction when viewed from above the vehicle. <br><br>
[0011]<br>
In addition to the structure of the first aspect, a sixth aspect of the present invention is characterized in that the side stand is supported on a lower surface of a crankcase at a position behind the kick arm and inward of the kick arm in the vehicle width direction. <br><br>
[Advantageous Effects of Invention]<br>
 [0012]<br>
According to the motorcycle according to the first aspect, the length of the kick arm |is set so that, when the motorcycle is parked using the side stand, the kick arm should contact the ground before reaching the rotation position at which the kick arm causes the engine to start. Thereby, adjusting the length of the kick arm is only needed to make the engine impossible to start with use of the kick arm when the motorcycle is parked using the side stand. Because of this, the kick arm need not be brought into contact with the main stand, and thus there is no limitation on the arrangement of the kick arm and the main stand. Accordingly, a degree of freedom for arrangement of components is improved. In addition, since the kick arm need not be brought into contact with the main stand, the main stand can be downsized.<br><br>
 [0013]<br>
According to the motorcycle according to the second aspect, the kick arm is arranged at the same aide, in the vehicle width direction, as the side stand. Thereby, when the motorcycle is parked using the side stand, the motorcycle tilts to the side stand side. Accordingly, compared to the case in which the kick arm is arranged at the opposite side to the side stand, the length of the kick arm can be made short, and thus the weight of the motorcycle can be reduced. <br><br>
[0014]<br>
According to the motorcycle according to the third aspect, the paired left and right steps are provided which are respectively arranged at both sides of the crankcase of the engine and on which the rider puts the feet, and the kick shaft is arranged below the steps. Thereby, the distance from the kick shaft to the ground can be made small. Accordingly, the length of the kick arm can be made short, and thus the weight of the motorcycle can be reduced. <br><br>
[0015]<br>
According to the motorcycle according to the fourth aspect, the step bar is provided which is supported on the lower surface of the crankcase in front of the kick shaft<br>
which extends outward in the vehicle width direction from the lower surface of the crankcase, and which has the steps respectively provided on both end portions thereof. The step bar is arranged protruding within the rotation range of the kick arm. This arrangement of the step bar causes the kick arm to contact the step bar even when the kick arm rotates exceedingly toward the front to pass the lowermost portion of the rotation range. Thereby, the step bar can be used as a stopper for the kick arm. Moreover, a force of the kick arm heading for the front is small compared to a force of the kick arm heading for the lowermost portion. Hence, even if the kick arm contacts the step bar, the contact force can be made small.<br><br>
 [00161<br>
According to the motorcycle according to the fifth aspect, the engine includes: the generator cover which is provided at one side of the crankcase and which houses the generator in cooperation with the crankcase; and the transmission cover which is provided at the other side of the crankcase and which houses the transmission in cooperation with the crankcase. The kick arm is arranged at the generator cover side. When the kick arm is not used, the foot stepping portion of the kick arm is retracted to a position within the width of the generator cover in the vehicle width direction when viewed from above the vehicle. Accordingly, the amount of projection of the kick arm from the engine when the kick arm is not used can be reduced, and thereby the motorcycle is downsized in the vehicle width direction. [0017]<br>
According to the motorcycle according to the sixth aspect, the side stand is supported on the lower surface of the crankcase at a position behind the kick arm and inward of the kick arm in the vehicle width direction. Accordingly, even if the side stand and the kick arm are arranged at the same side in the vehicle width direction, the rotation range of the kick arm can be made large.<br><br>

When the number of rotations of the orankahaft SI reaches or exceeds e predetermined number of rotations, a rotating drive force of the crankshaft Si is transmitted to the drive sprocket 57 through the primary sheave Ml, the belt M3, the secondary sheave M2, and then the centrifugal clutch M4. <br><br>
[0025]<br>
In addition, as shown in Fig. 1, a throttle body 62 is connected to an intake port (not shown) formed on an upper-side wall of the cylinder head 53 with an intake pipe 61 interposed therebetween. An air cleaner 64 is connected to an upstream end of the throttle body 62 with a connecting pipe 63 interposed therebetween. A muffler 66 is connected to an exhaust port (not shown) formed on a lower-side wall of the cylinder head 53 with an exhaust pipe 65 interposed therebetween.<br><br>
 [0026]<br>
In addition, as shown in Figs. 2 to 4, the motorcycle 10 of this embodiment includes: a main stand 71 which is rotatably supported on a lower end portion of the pivot plate 14 and which is used when the motorcycle 10 is parked with the rear wheel WR raised from the ground E; a side stand 72 which is attached to a rear lower surface of the crankcase 51 of the engine 50 and which is used when the motorcycle 10 is parked with the front wheel WF and the rear wheel WR resting on the ground E; a kick arm 73 which is attached on a kick shaft 59 protruding from a left-side wall of the crankcase 51 of the engine 50 and which is depressed by a rider to start the engine 50; and paired left and right steps 74 which are attached to a lower surface of a front portion of the crankcase 51 of the engine 50 and on which the rider puts the feet.<br><br>
 [0027]<br>
The side stand 72 is attached to the rear lower surface of the crankcase 51 on a left side thereof in the vehicle width direction with a side stand stay 80 interposed therebetween. The side stand stay 80 is a plate-shaped member including: a flat plate member 81fastened to the rear lower surface of the crankcase 51 with three bolts 83; and a bent portion|82 which is a left end portion of the flat plate member 8l bent obliquely downward. Moreover, the aide stand 72 is rotatably and pivotally supported on the bent portion 82 of the side stand stay 80 with a bolt 84 and a nut 85. Note *that reference numeral86 in Fig. 2 is a tension spring for maintaining the side stand 72 at a retracted position.<br><br>
[0028]<br>
In addition, in this embodiment, as shown in Figs. 2 and 4, the side stand 72 is arranged behind the kick arm 73.The dashed-dotted line in Fig. 3 indicates a state in which the kick arm 73 passes a side of the side stand 72 in the course of rotation. As shown in Fig. 3, the side stand 72 is arranged at an inner side in the vehicle width direction so that the side stand 72 should be positioned inward of a rotation range R of the kick arm73.Accordingly, even if the side stand 72 and the kick arm 73 are arranged at the same side in the vehicle width direction, the rotation range R of the kick arm 73 can be made large.<br><br>
 [0029]<br>
As shown in Figs. 2 and 3, the kick arm 73 includes a base portion 73a fastened to the kick shaft 59 with a bolt 73c, and a substantially L-shaped arm portion 73b rotatably fitted into the base portion 73a.  Formed on a distal end portion of the arm portion 73b is a foot stepping portion 73d on which the rider puts the foot when using the kick arm 73.  In this embodiment, the kick arm 73 is arranged at the generator cover 55 side (left side in the vehicle width direction) which is the same side, in the vehicle width direction, as the side stand 72 is arranged. <br><br>
[0030]<br>
In addition, in this embodiment, as shown in Figs. 2 and 3, when the kick arm 73 is not used, the foot stepping portion 73d of the arm portion 73blthereof is retracted to a position within the width of the generator cover 55 in the vehicle width direction when viewed from above the vehicle, specifically, at a position above the generator cover 55. Accordingly, the amount of projection of the kick arm 73 from the engine 50 (generator cover 55) when the kick arm 73 is not used can be reduced. In Fig. 2, the kick arm 73 indicated by the dashed-dotted line represents the kick arm 73 not being used, at the retracted position. The kick arm 73 indicated by the dashed-two dotted line represents the kick arm 73 being used, at an initial12 position Pi. The kick arm 73 indicated by the HOJ. id lino repreaenta blie kick arm 73 at a rotation position at which the kick arm 73 causes the engine 50 to start, namely, at an engine start rotation position P2.<br><br>
[0031]<br>
In addition, in this embodiment, as shown in Figs. 7 and 8, the length of the kick arm 73 is set so that, when the motorcycle is parked using the side stand 72, the kick arm 73 should contact the ground E before the kick arm 73 reaches the engine start rotation position P2.  Accordingly,I. the engine cannot be started with use of the kick arm 73 in<br>
the when the motorcycle is parked using the side stand 72 Note that the kick arm 73 indicated by the solid line in Fig. 7 represents the kick arm 73 in contact with the ground E, at a contact rotation position P4.<br><br>
[0032]<br>
Here, as shown in Fig. 8, in a state in which the side stand 72 is used and thereby a vehicle body is inclined toward the side stand 72, a distance LI from the axis of<br>
the kick shaft 59 to the ground E when the kick arm 7 3 is arranged at the same side as the side stand 72 is smaller than a distance L2 from the axis of the kick shaft 59 to<br>
the ground E when the kick arm 73 is arranged at the opposite side to the side stand 72. Therefore, when the kick arm 73 is arranged at the same side as the side stand<br>
72, compared to the case in which the kick arm 73 is arranged at the opposite side to the side stand 72, the length of the kick arm 73 can be made short when the length of the kick arm 73 is set so that the engine 50 cannot be started with use of the kick arm 73 when the motorcycle 10 is parked using the side stand 72. <br><br>
[0033]<br>
The steps 7 4 are attached on a front lower surface of the crankcase 51 with a step holder 90. The step holder 90 includes: paired left and right holder bases 91 each fasl:.oned to the front lower surface of the crankcase 51 by two bolts 94 with respective vibration damping members 92 therobetween; and a pipe-shaped step bar 93 fixed in a way to be laid across the paired left and right holder bases 91. The Btapa 7
<br>
[0034]<br>
In addition, in this embodiment, as shown in Fig. 2, the kick shaft 59 is arranged below the steps 74. This causes the distance from the kick shaft 59 to the ground E to be short. Thereby, when the length of the kick arm 73 is set so that the engine 50 cannot be started with the kick arm 73 when the motorcycle 10 is parked using the side stand 72, the length of the kick arm 73 can be made short, <br><br>
[0035]<br>
In addition, as shown in Fig. 2, the step bar 93 is supported on the front lower surface of the crankcase 51 with the holder bases 91 in front of the kick shaft 59. The step bar 93 is formed to extend outward in the vehicle width direction from the front lower surface of the crankcase 51 and then to extend upward to the rear while being bent. As shown in Figs. 5 and 6, the step bar 93 is arranged protruding within the rotation range R. This <br>
causes the kick arm 73 to contact the step bar 93 even when the kick arm 73 rotates exceedingly toward the front to pass the lowermost portion of the rotation range R.  In this way, the step bar 93 serves as a stopper for the kick arm 73.  In Fig. 5, the kick arm 73 indicated by the solid line represents the kick arm 73 in contact with the step bar 93, at a contact rotation position P3, and the kick arm 73 indicated by the dashed line represents the kick arm 73 passing a side of the side stand 72, at a passing rotation position P5. <br><br>
[0036]<br>
As described above, according to the motorcycle 10 of this embodiment, the length of the kick arm 73 is set so that, when the motorcycle 10 is parked using the side stand 72, the kick arm 73 should contact the ground E before reaching the engine start rotation position P2. Thereby, adjusting the length of the kick arm 73 is only needed to make l.he erigino impossible to start with use of the kick arm 73 when the motorcycle 10 is parked using the side stand 72. 13ecause of this, the kick arm 73 need not be brought into contact with the main stand 71, and thus there is no limitation on the arrangement of the kick arm 73 and the main stand 71. Accordingly, a degree of freedom for arrangement of components is improved. In addition, since the kick arm 73 need not be brought into contact with the main stand 71, the main stand 71 cln be downsized.<br><br>
[0037]<br>
In addition, according to the motorcycle 10 in this embodiment, the kick arm 73 is arranged at the same side as the side stand 72 in the vehicle w^dth direction. Thereby,<br>
when the motorcycle 10 is parked with use of the side stand 72, the motorcycle 10 tilts to the side stand 72 side. Accordingly, compared to the case in which the kick arm 73 is arranged at the opposite side to the side stand 72, the length of the kick arm 73 can be made short, and thus the weight of the motorcycle 10 can be reduced. The length of the kick arm 73 is set so that, when the motorcycle 10 is parked using the side stand 72, the kick arm 73 should contact the ground E before reaching the engine start rotation position P2.<br><br>
 [0038]<br>
In addition, according to the motorcycle 10 in this embodiment, the paired left and right steps 74 are provided which are respectively arranged at both sides of the crankcase 51 of the engine 50 and on which the rider puts the feet, and the kick shaft 59 is arranged below the steps 74. Thereby, the distance LI from the kick shaft 59 to the ground E can be made small. Accordingly, the length of the kick arm 73 can be made short, and thus the weight of the motorcycle 10 can be reduced. The length of the kick arm 73 is set so that, when the motorcycle 10 is parked using the side stand 72, the kick arm 73 should contact the ground E before reaching the engine start rotation position P2.<br><br>
 [0039]<br>
In addition, according to the motorcycle 10 in this embodiment, the step bar 93 is provided which is supported on the lower surface of the crankcase 51 in front of the kick rahaft 59 which extends outward in the vehicle width direction from the lower surface of the crankcase 51, and whichn as the steps 74 respectively provided on both end porl.JonH thereof;. The step bar 93 is arranged protruding within tlie rotation range R of the kick arm 73. This arrangement of the step bar 93 causes the kick arm 73 to contact the step bar 93 even when the kick arm 73 rotates exceedingly toward the front to pass the lowermost portion of the rotation range R. In this way, the step bar 93 can be used as a stopper for the kick arm 73. Moreover, a force of the kick arm 73 heading for the front is small compared to a force of the kick arm 73 heading for the lowermost portion. Accordingly, even if the kick arm 73 contacts the step bar 93, the contact force can be made  small. <br><br>
[0040]<br>
In addition, according to the motorcycle 10 in this embodiment, the engine 50 includes: the generator cover 55 which is provided at the left side of the crankcase 51 and which houses the generator G in cooperation with the crankcase 51; and the transmission cover 56 which is provided at the right side of the crankcase 51 and which houses the transmission M in cooperation with the crankcase 51. The kick arm 73 is arranged at the generator cover 55 side. When the kick arm 73 is not used, the foot stepping portion 73d of the kick arm 73 is retracted to a position within the width of the generator cover 55 in the vehicle width direction when viewed from above the vehicle. Accordingly, the amount of projection of the kick arm 73 from the engine 50 when the kick arm 73 is not used can be reduced, and thereby the motorcycle 10 can be downsized in the vehicle width direction.<br><br>
[0041]<br>
In addition, according to the motorcycle 10 in this embodiment, the side stand 72 is supported on the lower surface of the crankcase 51 at a position behind the kick arm 73 and inward of the kick arm 73 in the vehicle width direction. Accordingly, even if the side stand 72 and the kick arm 73 are arranged at the sa|:ie side in the vehicle widl.h direction, the rotation range R of the kick arm 73 can ba made large. <br><br>
[0042]<br>
FurLher, as a modification of this embodiment, as shown in Fig. 9, a aide stand switch 87 may be provided on a pivot portion of the side stand 72. The side stand switch 87 determines a use state of the side stand 72 by detecting a rotation angle of the side stand 72, and when the motorcycle 10 is parked using the side stand 71, control may be performed so that ignition and fuel injection should be cut off. <br><br>
[0043]<br>
Note that the present invention is not limited to the embodiment exemplified above, and modifications can be made as appropriate without departing from the scope of the present invention.For example, in the embodiment above, the length of the kick arm 73 is set so that the kick arm 73 should contact the ground E before reaching the engine start rotation position P2; however, the present invention is not limited to this, and the kick arm 73 may be provided with a projection or a separate member so.that the kick arm 73 should contact the ground E therewith.<br><br>
