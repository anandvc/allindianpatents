				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of improved organophilic clay useful as gellants for making viscous organic systems.<br>
In the field of chemical technology this invention relates to the modified clay complexes and to a method of preparing them. More particular!}' this invention relates to the ion-exchange process for the preparation of hydrophobia clay complexes which are compatible with organic liquids / mineral oils in contrast to an unmodified hydrophilic clay that is easily dispersible in water.<br>
The preparation of organpclay complexes that are compatible with organic liquids has been known for some time. A naturally occurring water dispersible clay such as bentonite can be reacted with long chain quaternary ammonium compounds to produce  hydrophobia  clay complexes. These organically modified clay complexes have been found to have utility in a wide variety of applications, where it is desired to impart greater viscosity,  gellation and antisettling properties etc. to an organic liquid. The modified clay complexes have specific property for their uses in (i) lubricant    industry, as versatile gellant. to thicken oil to semi-solid   or   solid   consistency,    (ii)   paints, lacquers and stains,    as   an excellent suspending agent, that inhibits separation of pigments and fillers, (iii) printing ink , as a valuable viscosity   controller to   prevent throw-off at high speed printing operation, (iv) waxes, to provide high tensile strength, (v) adhesivcs.   ( like asphalt and rubber ) to impart bond strength and improve moisture resistance, (vi) drilling fluids like oil based muds, it is used for drill-stem  lubrication, and for corrosion protection,  (vii) fiber glass resin as thixotrop, to prevent the separation and sagging of fiberglass during curing and enable easy spraying of the liquid resin.<br>
The organophilic clays are the reaction products of highly purified bentonite clay and a long chain quaternary ammonium compound. Under favourable conditions, the cation of the<br><br>
organic compound undergoes ion-exchange reaction with clay which contain a negatively charged layer-lattice and exchangeable inorganic cations, to form organophilic clays which possess the property of being compatible with many oyanic liquids. Reference may be made to E. A .Hauser, U.S. Patent No.2.531.427(1950) and J.W.Jordan, U.S. Patent No.2,966,506(1960) both included herein by reference and the book "The Chemistry of Clay - Organic Reactions" 1974 by B.K..G. Iheng (John Wiley &amp; Sons), Chapter 5, Interaction with positively charged organic species. PP 211-238.<br>
Howard Goodman in U.S. Patent No.4.631.091 (1985). has described the use of inorganic salt viz. Al2(SO.Oj or AlCb to flocculate the purified bentonite clay prior to reaction with higher alkyl containing quaternary ammonium compounds in order to obtain organophilic clays that are readily dispersible in organic liquids. The drawback associated with this invention is that, after the flocculation step the removal of traces of flocculating agent by repeated washing is time consuming and labourous. liven at ppm level the clay gets flocculated and does not remain in suspension for long period.<br>
T.R. Jones et al. in an European Patent No.220. 346 (1987) has disclosed the use of higher alkyl containing quaternary ammonium compound in organic solvent and homogenisation of clay slurry under high energy pug milling in order to manufacture organoclay having enhanced gelling properties. The drawback of this method is that the use of organic solvent to prepare a clear solution of quaternary ammonium compound and latter the recovery of this organic solvent from end liquor makes the process complicated and uneconomical. M.I.Knudson Jr .ct al. in U.S.Pat. No .4.664.842 (1987) recommends that the clay slurry be exposed to high speed fluid sheer i.e. homogenisation with 5000 psig pressure, to reduce the particle size of clay before its interaction with dimeths Idihydrogenated   tallow ammonium salt in organic solvent. The patent discloses that the reaction was carried out at 60° C with<br><br>
stirring for about 30 minutes. The drawback of this invention is that homogenisation at high pressure involve large energy. Thereby one unit operation is also increased. Moreover, the basic ion-exchange reaction is carried out at 60 ° C and maintained for 30 minutes, This will also increase the energy (power) consumption in the process.<br>
It is disclosed by N.T.Doidge et al. in U.S. Pat. No.4. 743, 305 (1988) that organoclay readily dispersible in organic media is prepared by subjecting the crude bentonite slurry to sedimentation , sieving and homogenisation at 5000 psig pressure to remove non-clay components before its interaction with quaternary ammonium compounds. This patent also c discloses the interaction of dimethyldihydrogenated tallow ammonium chloride in Me2CHOH with purified bentonite clay while maintaining the temperature around 60°C for about 30 minutes. This mixture was aged for 20 minutes at high speed. The drawback associated with this invention is that purification steps involves many unit operation steps. This will also simultenously increase the overall time of reaction of one particular batch. Besides, the reaction was carried out at higher temperature. Therefore energy (power) consumption will be increased.<br>
It is well documented in a book by C.J. Boner ."Manufacture and Application of Lubricating Grease" (1954) (Reinhold Publishing Corp.) Clay Base Thickners, PP 724-748 which depicts the effect of variables on the gelation of lubricating oil by organoclays to form grease. Another article "The gelation of Hydrocarbons by Montmorillonite Organic Complexes" by W.T. Granquist and J.L. McAttee Jr., J. Colloid Science. 18. 409-420 (1963) discloses the use of organophilie clay gellants and polar organic dispersants as viscosifiers in organic systems,<br><br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of improved organophilic clay useful as gallants for making viscous organic systems, which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide organophilic clay with high degree of hydrophobicity and that is compatible with organic liquids.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide organically modified clay complexes with large basal spacing, high gel volume, low surface area, controlled moisture and nitrogen content which are the prerequisites for higher viscosity, improved gellation, better antisettling property in organic liquids and mineral oils.<br>
Another and more particular object of the present invention is to provide organically modified clay complexes capable of thickening a wide variety of mineral oils to produce a gelled system that displays a high degree of stability when subjected to'mechanical working.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an economical, simple and practical method for producing the product without being subjected to the disadvantages and complexities involved in other known techniques,<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the preparation of organophilic clay useful as gellants for making viscous organic systems which comprises<br>
i)         dispersing 2 to 3 weight percent of raw smectite clay selected from<br>
bentonite in de mineralized water under stirring by known method, to<br>
obtain a slurry; ii)       purifying the said dispersed clay slurry by known methods to obtain<br>
cation exchange capacity of 60 miliequivalent per 100 g clay and a water<br>
swelling capacity of 20 cc: iii)      converting the purified bentonite clay slurry to homo ionic form by<br>
reacting with concentrated alkali metal inorganic salt solution. Such as<br>
herein described hydrochloric acid or by passing the clay slurry through<br>
the cationic form of ion exchange resin;<br><br>
iv) preparing a solution of quaternary ammonium salt in dematerialized water at 70°equivalent to the cation exchange capacity of the purified clay:<br>
v) adding the quaternary ammonium salt solution as obtained in step (iv) to the homoionic clay slurry as obtained in step (iii) at room temperature under constant agitation, allowing the reaction mixture to age under stirring to obtained flocculated clay, separating the flocculated clay by known methods, to obtain wet cake of organophilic clay;<br>
vi) drying the wet cake in an air circulated oven, while maintaining the temperature at 65 °Celsius, until the free moisture is 3 percent; (vii)pulverizing the dry granules in a steel hammer mill to obtain a organophilic clay.<br>
In the process of the present invention the reaction product of a bentonite clay having cation exchange capacity of at least 60 mill equivalent per 100 grams of the said clay and a dimethyl benzyl alkyl ammonium compound, wherein the said alkyl radical independently contains from 12 to 22 carbon atoms and wherein the amount of said ammonium compound is within the range from 90 to less than 110 milliequivalent per 100 grams of clay, based upon 100 percent active clay, using 6 to 10 percent by weight of said organophilic clay to enhance dispersibility and the gel formation of mineral oil with addition of polar activator in the range of 0.6 to 1.0 percent by weight to obtain grease. The polar activator is added to increase the gelling efficiency of organophilic clay.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the smectite clays such as bentonite used can be either in lump or powder form and the purified clay must have a basal spacing in the range 12-16 A* cation exchange capacity of at least 60 mill equivalent per 100 grams of clay and water swelling capacity more than 20cc.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the quaternary ammonium compounds used contains at least 12 carbon atoms in alkyl group preferably with 20 to 30% of alkyl group containing 16 carbon atoms and 60 to 75 % of alkyl group containing 18 carbon atoms.<br><br>
In yet another embodiment-of the present invention the quaternary ammonium compound solution is added to the clay slurry over a period of 30 to 70 minutes.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the reaction mixture is aged for at least 45 minutes.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the quaternary ammonium compounds used are such as (i) dimethyl benzyl stearyl ammonium chloride , (ii) dimethyl benzyl cetyl ammonium chloride, (iii) dimethyl dioctadecyl ammonium chloride and (iv) dimethyl dihydrogenated tallow ammonium chloride.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the quaternary ammonium salt solution used are in concentration range of 0.01 M to 0.1M.<br>
The   clays which are useful in the practice of this invention are those that belong to a class  known  as  smectites  and  are characterised  by  a  three   layer, platelet structure. In nature, bentonile clay exists   as   stacks   of platelets, similar to the pages   in   a   book. Bentonite and hcctorite (Smectite group) are characterised   by   a negatively charged layer lattice structure, which arises from the replacement of some higher valency positive lattice atoms with the lower valency atoms of similar si/.e (i.e. isomorphous   substitution)   eg. magnesium replaces some of the aluminium atoms in bentonites and lithium replaces some magnesium atoms in hectorite. The negative charges developed are reflected on both faces of the clay platelets where they arc counter balanced, in nature, by inorganic cations such as Na4,Mg'~ and Ca\     These   cations   are   not   a part of the lattice structure and are relatively   easy   to   replace.   Therefore, these clays possess a substantial base exchange capacity. Besides this, another important property of bentonite (smectite) is the swelling capacity in water.<br><br>
A particular desirable type of clay, from which organically modified clay complexes can be prepared is the naturally occuring swelling type bentonite and the like clays and hectorite a swelling magnesium lithium silicate clay. These clays exhibit swelling capacity in water in the range of 20 to 30 times its own volume and has base exchange capacity in the range of 60-100 milliequivalents per 100 grams of clay as determined by ammonium acetate method. A typical, naturally occuring bentonite has about 60% of its base exchange capacity satisfied by sodium ions with the remainder of its exchangeable ions being calcium and magnesium, out of them calcium is in major proportion. Naturally occuring bentonite clays having sodium ion in major proportion are called sodium bentonite clay. In addition to the bentonite clays mentioned above, we have found that clays having different origin and chemical composition are also useful in the preparation of organoclay provided that, it possesses the inherent characteristics viz. (i) swelling in water (ii) high base exchange capacity and (iii) intercalation property. These clays are characterised by an unbalanced crystal lattice and have negative charges which are neutralized as available in nature by inorganic metal ions. These cations to varying degree are capable of being replaced by other inorganic or organic cations.<br>
The quaternary ammonium compounds used in the practice of this invention are quaternary ammonium salts containing at least one long   chain alkyl   group  having   from   12 to 22 carbon atoms, preferably  16 to 18 carbon atoms and more preferably 20% to 30% of the alkyl groups containing 16 carbon atoms and 60% to 75% containing  18 carbon atoms. The long chain alkyl  group provide hydtophobic characteristic. In addition to long chain carbon molecule the other groups that are attached to the cation centers are divided   into   two classes viz. (i) Filler groups and (ii) Active groups<br><br>
The filler groups are small chain alkyl radicals that complete the tetrahedron around the nitrogen. It does not offer any beneficial effects to the organoclay performance. The typical   examples   of filler groups are hydrogen and short chain alkyl groups viz methyl, ethyl, butyl.<br>
The active groups which is a small part of the total cation, have a beneficial contribution to the organoclay performance. Typical examples of active groups are benzyl and 2 hydroxy ethyl. The cations containing these groups will not significantly increase the basal spacing between the clay platelets but provide both greater solvent polarity range and improved ease of dispersion to the organoclay.<br>
Anions such as Cl , Br , acetate, hydroxide, nitrate, nitrite, etc may be present in the quaternary ammonium compound to balance the charge of cation. Generally salt having Cl , Br or mixture of them as anion is selected These quaternary ammonium salts can be represented by the formula<br>
where RI   and RT are methyl groups. RS is the aryl group and R4   is  the long chain alkyl group containing a mixture of 12 to 22 carbon atoms wherein   the major portion is of C|6 -C|g  carbon atoms. This alkyl chain has 20%    to  30% have 16 carbon atoms and 60% to 75% have 18 carbon atoms, based on 100% and where X " is preferably selected from the group consisting of Cl      Br    . NO.i    .OH    . (MhO:      and mixtures thereof.<br>
In accordance with the present invention it has been found that organically modified clay complexes can be prepared by introducing a dilute solution of quaternary ammonium salt (such as dimethyl alkyl aryl ammonium chloride) to a dilute aqueous dispersion of clay (montmorillonite and the like) that has been, prior to reaction with quaternary ammonium salt converted to homoionic form. The reaction can be represented by the general formula<br><br>
In the present invention, the starting material or reactants employed    include    bentonite clays  and  quaternary  ammonium compounds  (cationic   surfactant).   As used herein, the bentonite clay is in the highly purified state with major portion being montmorillonite clay. It is particularly advantageous because   montmorillonite   in   pure   form possesses high swelling power and base exchange capacity.   The montmorillonite clay is effective/suitable in high cation exchange capacity, in which the exchange   capacity   must   be   in the range of 60 to   100 millicquivalents per   100 grams of clay.  The swelling capacity  in  water must be about 20 times than the original volume of raw clay.<br>
The commercially available quaternary ammonium compound is used, which is completely soluble in water. It contained atleast one long chain alkyl group containing atleast 12 carbon atoms. The other groups attached to the cation may be (i) "Filler" group which serves to complete the tetrahedron around the nitrogen and (ii) The "Active" group (Aryl group) which contributes to organoclay performance by providing greater solvent<br>
polarity and improved ease  of dispersion. The cations must have sufficient hydrophobic character to impart organophilic character to the modified clay reaction product. The preparation of organically modified clay complexes such as is contemplated by this invention is accomplished by first dispersing   a   naturally occuring clay   lumps/powder, in demineralized water to produce a dilute slurry. This dilute clay slurry is then subjected to separation / upgradation process which causes   the   removal   of   non-clay contaminants from the montmorillonite clay particles. This separation can be readily accomplished by permitting the contaminants to settle out of a dilute aqueous dispersion of the clay or they can be removed by hydrocyclone    or   centrifugation    techniques.    This    step may be conveniently    carried    out    either before or after converting the clay into a desirable homoionic form.<br>
Many of the non-swelling bentonitc clays exhibit in their natural state the base exchange capacity satisfied w ith Ca+" and Mg*~ which are comparatively difficult for organic cations to replace. It has been found that a much improved organically modified clay complexes can be prepared by subjecting the clay to an ion-exchange treatment to replace Ca+2 and Mg+" ions by sodium or any monovalent ion. prior to reacting it with quaternary ammonium compound of the type described.<br>
In commercial practice, one of the most widely used methods for preparing a homoionic clay is by passing a dilute clay slum.' through an ion-exchange resin column using a fixed bed technique. Other method in which clay slurry is mixed with resin under agitation can also be used to prepare homoionic clay. In the practice of this invention, another method of preparing homoionic clay which can be employed is by repeatedly leaching the clay slurry with a solution of water soluble metal salt or acid and subsequently washing the clay free of excess salt.<br>
In general, the ion-exchange reaction between the charge balancing cations of the clay and cations of quaternary ammonium salts   can   be   carried   out   over  a   wide range of temperature. According to this invention, the improved characteristics i.e. high degree of hydrophobicity ( high retention of organic cations on clay ) is obtained when the reaction as hitherto described is carried   out   at   a temperature within the range of 35°C to 75°C   or higher, although it was observed that there is no particular   advantage   in higher reaction temperature. It    is understood     that     high     degree     of     hydrophobicity     depends significantly upon the selectivity of organic cation in the interlayer space of clay, in place of inorganic charge balancing cations.    Such  selectivity for organic cation is related to the easy  availability   of organic   cations   in   solution   which   is temperature   related. The interaction  at  controlled temperature leads  to the production of modified clay complexes having   higher   hydrophobicity   and   required   surface   characteristics.   In   so   far  as   the temperature of dispersed clay slum- is concerned, it is not critical and it may be delivered at room temperature or higher as per the objective of the invention.<br>
In accordance with the broad aspect of the present invention, the ion-exchange reaction having particular regard to the co-mingling of the total quantities of the two reactants, is subject to a variety of approaches. The total quantities of the reactants can be co-mingled very rapidly or very slowly, in both the cases the ion-exchange reaction will take place. In practising this invention, it is found desirable not to complete the addition of quaternary ammonium salt solution in a period of time shorter than 30 minutes. Moreover, it may be mentioned here that little or no advantage is gained by unduly prolonging the addition time. In no instance, it is found to be desirable to extend the addition time, beyond a period of about 70 minutes. A more suitable range for producing the<br>
organoclay with high hydrophobicity is   from   about   30 to 40 minutes, besides the aging<br>
time, before the flocculated clay is filtered. In this invention it is not found to be advantageous to disregard the rate of co-mingling of readmits, because the uniformity of the particulate mass composing the end product is rendered poor or economics is adversely affected.<br>
According to this invention, number of conditions are varied, as directed above to obtain modified organoclay with improved surface properties. One such important aspect of the present invention   involves the clay concentration and molar concentration of quaternary ammonium salt solution. For those skilled   in the art of manufacture of organoclay, it is understood  that  a  dilute  aqueous  dispersion  of clay must be present as a part of the reaction medium right from the inception of the reaction, otherwise the end product fails to acquire the physical / surface characteristics falling within the specified range. In practising this invention, the raw clay is dispersed in demincraliscd water at a concentration from about 1  to 5 percent by weight. The slurry optionally sedimented / hydrocycloned and / or centrifuged to remove non-clay impurities which constitute about 30 to 40 percent by weight of the starting clay composition. Thus, the   purified   clay  slurry contains montmorillonite clay, within the range  of about 0.5  to 4.0 percent,  particularly and preferably in the range of about   1   to 3 per cent. At lower concentration, degree of hydrophobicity or in other words the retention of organic cations by the clay, is higher.  At higher concentration, the organophilic clays are poor gellants. The quaternary ammonium salt solution is prepared containing organic cations within the range of about 0.01 M to 0.1M, preferably in the range of about 0.02 M to 0.07M.    It is further found   in this investigation that dilution   of quaternary ammonium salt does not help in improving the surface properties of the end product. At the same time, increasing the concentration beyond a certain limit, no advantage<br>
is gained.<br>
In   practising this invention the quaternary ammonium salt solution is prepared in the desired   milliequivalent ratio, either   dispersed   or   dissolved in demineralised water.The amount of quaternary ammonium salt added to the clay must be sufficient to impart to the organophilic clay the enhanced gellation characteristics desired. The milliequivalent ratio is the number of milliequivalent of the quaternary ammonium compound in organophilic clay per 100 grams of   clay. The modified organoclay complexes   of this invention have a milliequivalent ratio   from 90 to 110. At lower milliequivalent ratio, the organophilic clays are ineffective gellants. even though they may be effective gellants in presence of a polar additive.   At   higher   milliequivalent   ratio   the organophilic   clay   are   poor   gellants. However, the preferred milliequivalent   ratio   within the range   from 90 to 110 will vary depending on the characteristics of the organic system to be gelled by the organophilic clay. Upon completion of the addition of the quaternary ammonium salt solution and given the sufficient aging time for the ion-exchange reaction to be completed, the flocculation of organically modified clay complexes takes place. The latter readily   separated   from   the aqueous  phase  by  filtration,  but other means of separation,  such  as centrifuge / filter press can be used. It is preferable to wash the product with demineralised water to remove adhering water soluble salts and the like. The filter cake is then dried in an air-circulated oven. The amount of water remaining in the powder depends upon the time, temperature and  other conditions of drying.   The  dried  cake  can   be  pulverised  to produce a fine pulverulent product with the help of a hammer mill.<br>
A     simple   gel   volume   measurement   method   has   been adopted to illustrate   the compatibility (dispersion) of organophilic clay prepared in this invention.   In this method, 2 grams   of organophilic   clay   is slowly added to a toluene-methanol mixture (80 : 20 by<br>
volume) taken in a 100 ml graduated stoppered glass cylinder   and   thoroughly   shaken to<br>
uniformly disperse the clay. The volume of gel in millilitres is recorded after 24 hours. The milliequivalents of the organic compound retained in the organophilic clay is calculated from the ignition loss at 800°C of (i) clay-organic complex (ii) hydrophilic upgraded clay and (iii) molecular weight of quaternary ammonium cation.   The free moisture is measured by keeping the sample in oven at 105°C for 2 hours The product so obtained has the following properties :(Table Removed)<br>
In the present invention, bentonite clay having (i) basal spacing in the range of 12-16A0 (ii) cation exchange capacity in the range of 60 to 110 milliequivalents per 100 grams of dry clay, (iii) swelling capacity in water more than 20 cc.. was used The bentonite with above properties should have Silica (as SiOi ) 45-55 %: Alumina (as AN O.i ) 20-25 %; Iron oxide (as Fe: O.; ) 7-12 %: Magnesium oxide ( as MgO) 2-4 %; Sodium oxide ( as NaaO)<br>
1-3 % and Calcium oxide (as CaO) 1-4 %. The impurities (non-clay fractions) were removed<br>
by sedimentation /centrifugation technique. Different homoionic forms viz. Na and H were prepared   either by using ion-exchange resin or concentrated inorganic salt solution.   The typical quaternary ammonium   compounds which have been used in the practice of this invention includes (i) Dimethyl  benzyl stearyl ammonium chloride  (ii)  Dimethyl  benzyl cetyl   ammonium chloride, (iii) Dimethyl      dioctadccyl      ammonium    chloride,    (iv) Dimethyl dihydrogenated tallow ammonium chloride. Any of the above compounds can be used with an ion-exchange treated clay to produce an organically modified clay complex. The molecular weight of these organic compounds ranged from 390 to 590. Using the above organophilic clay the  grease  may  be  prepared  from lubricating oil having the following<br><br>
properties. (Table Removed)<br>
Now   in    accordance    with the present invention it has been found that   no   special equipment is  required  in the process herein described.  The  reaction vessel  should  be equipped with an adequate agitator which produces a strong back flow of slurry and avoids zone of high concentrations of the reactants. The storage vessels for (i) purified clay slurry and (ii) quaternary ammonium salt solution, are connected to the reaction vessel through lines fitted with flow control means. The reaction vessel is equipped with an outlet line fitted at the bottom leading to a filter which may be of the plate and frame type or a<br>
centrifuge. The filter cake is washed with water until  the test  for chloride  is negative with silver nitrate. The filtered and washed mass is dried in air circulated tray dryers. This method of preparation generates a very dilute effluent which contains soluble salts and very less quantity of unreacted organic cation.  The effluent is acidic in nature and can be neutralised by a small amount of alkali., before its disposal.<br>
In the present invention, an improved organophilic clay gellants are prepared from a purified clay slurry and a clear solution of quaternary ammonium sail. The process imbibes a simple ion-exchange reaction between the interlayer inorganic cations of clay and the organic cations of quaternary ammonium salt, under ambient and experimental conditions. The organo-clay so prepared possess a high degree of hydrophobicity. The byproduct such as sodium chloride is removed by washing. In this method, the simple inventive steps adopted are (i) dispersing the bentonite clay demineralised water without the use of dispersing agents; (ii) the purified clay slurry so obtained is used as such and does not need homogenisation at high pressure ; (iii) the homo-ionic clay is prepared by addition of dilute mineral acid ; (iv) the quaternary ammonium compounds are readily soluble in hot water and (v) the basic ion-exchange reaction is carried out at ambient temperature. The clay used in this process, have sites in the interlayer space, where the exchange of ions takes place. This space can be expanded and organic cation of large molecular size can be accomodated. The organic cations orient in mono-, di-. or pseudo layer depending on the experimental conditions. The quaternary ammonium compound used in this process have an active group with a hydrophobic character which is found to be responsible for the conversion of hydrophilic character of clay to hydrophobic character.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
