PROVISIONAL SPECIFICATION<br>
(Section 10 and Rule 13)<br>
PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF RETENTION OF PLACENTA IN CATTLE AND BUFFALOES<br>
Harshadbhai Patel<br>
Bochasan, Barsod Block,<br>
District - Anand, Gujarat.<br>
INDIA.<br>
The following specification describes the invention<br>
 <br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to the herbal composition for treatment of retention of placenta in cattle and buffaloes. The composition further comprises the use of Chlerodendrum phlomides, optionally with other herbs<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Cross breeding of indigenous dairy cattle has tremendously improved the productivity of the animals, augmenting milk production. However, increased prevalence of reproductive problems in dairy animals is becoming a potential threat to the profitability of dairy farming business by bringing down the production and income.<br>
The multitude of reproductive disease conditions like prolapse, retained placenta and metritis<br>
<br>
 in the early postpartum period, a sequel to stress the lactating; animals experience, dwindles<br>
the production efficiency and reproductive performance.<br>
Retention of fetal membranes (after birth) is observed more frequently in cattle and<br>
buffaloes, especially in dairy cattle, than in other animals. Normally a cow's placenta is<br>
expelled within 8-12 hours period after calving. If any part of the afterbirth is held for longer<br>
periods, it is considered to be pathological or abnormal.<br>
Partial retention is rather common and frequently involves the placentomes (buttons) nearer <br>
the ovaries of the pregnant horn. The frequency of retained placenta averages 7-10% under<br>
normal conditions in a dairy herd.<br>
In case of abnormal deliveries and infections by micro-organisms, the retention of fetal<br>
membranes may occur in 50% or more of the cows. In herds with management problems,<br>
nutritional deficiencies, metabolic diseases, or acute mastitis at calving, the incidence of<br>
 <br>
retained placenta may also be abnormally high. Cows having history of retained placenta<br>
have an increased chance of retention on subsequent carvings.<br>
Many direct and indirect factors are possible causes of placenta retention. Frequently a<br>
retained placenta should be considered a clinical sign of a more generalized disease or<br>
condition. Inadequate nutrition, infection, lack of specific nutrients like Ca etc. and hormonal<br>
imbalance are the major factors.<br>
Partial retention may go unnoticed until complications such as metritis (inflammation of<br>
uterus) or pyometra (pus in uterus) develop. When noticed, the affected cows may have<br>
increased temperature, be off feed, be depressed, have lowered milk production and have foul<br>
smelling vaginal discharged<br>
The affected animals should be examined and treated both systemically with antibiotics<br>
(possibly with intravenous electrolytes and dextrose fluids) and locally with intra-uterine<br>
medication by or under the direction of a veterinarian.<br>
Prevention of retained placentas, of course, is the key. The optimum is to maintain a healthy,<br>
contented and active cow prior to, during and after parturition.   <br>
The negative effect of retained placentas on subsequent fertility is commonly due to delayed <br>
involution of the uterus and chronic endomeritis, one of the more common causes of<br>
infertility.<br>
Some cows with retention are affected with permanent sterility due to pyometra, perimetris,<br>
salpingitis (inflammation of oviducts), ovaritis or severe damage to the endometrium.<br>
US patent 3966927 discloses methods employing compositions containing a long-acting<br>
glucocorticoid, as for example, dexamethasone trimethylacetatea, for inducing parturition in<br>
cattle up to four to six weeks prior to normal birth and within two to three days after<br>
 <br>
intravenous administration of the glucocorticoid, with low incidence of retention of placenta, in-utero and post partum mortality and high rate of efficacy and parturition synchronization. The US patent 7045151 and 6497885 describes the use of a new pharmaceutical combination employing the herb Vitex agnus-castus (chasteberry), to enhance hormone balance by increasing progesterone release and, therefore, ovulation frequency. The antioxidants, green tea, vitamin E, and selenium, improve overall reproductive health. L-arginine, an amino acid, stimulates the reproductive organs by improving circulation: Folic acid, vitamins B6 and B12, iron, zinc and magnesium help promote womens' fertility.<br>
Russian patent RU2010573C1 describes a method that involves applying local effect to endometrium by injecting into uterus cavity 200-250 ml of mixture composed of equal parts of 0.0-0.12% electrolytic solution of sodium hypochlorite and 4-5% solution of hydrogen peroxide heated to 37Â°C 6-12 h after calving in the course of 1-2 days. Efficiency of the claimed method for treating cows in case of placenta retention is 100% as compared with 5-% in the animals of the reference group which were treated with hormonal agents. The period from calving to fecundation proved to be 44 days shorter in the .cows of the test group while the insemination index was smaller by 0.6%. The period between calving and first insemination was reduced by 17.3 days. Effect was the higher contractility of uterus muscles and better postnatal involution of the entire uterus.<br>
The method disclosed in Russian patent RU2028807C1 involves addition of preparation to cow food containing (as a single dose), g: copper 0.051; zinc 0.409; manganese 0.119; cobalt 0.003; iodine 0.003, and malt seedlings 500.0. Preparation is added beginning from the 2-d day after calving for 26-30 days up to appearance the first stage of sexual excitation. Prophylaxis effectiveness is 90% at placenta retention and 95Â°  at endometritis, fertilization<br>
 <br>
coefficient is decreased, calves safety is increased. Effect is the improved method of<br>
prophylaxis.<br>
Gangleron is used for prophylaxis of placenta retention in cows, affecting the improved<br>
method  of cow  placenta  retention  as  mentioned  in  the  Russian  patent  document<br>
RU2028809C1.<br>
US patent application 20040121027 describes the invention provides a novel herbal<br>
composition for treatment of cuts, burns and wound, the composition comprising plant<br>
material selected from Utleria solicifolia, Jatropha curcas, Clerodendrum infortunatum, and<br>
Centella asiatica.<br>
The plant is also reported for skin care (in patents JP2002179581 and JP2003113064) and<br>
hair growth promoter (JP2001097824).<br>
US patent application 20030228383 relates to herbal composition for the treatment of chronic<br>
respiratory disorders such as cold, cough, allergic asthma, seasonal allergic rhinitis,<br>
pharyngitis, laryngitis and the like and a process for preparing the same. The composition<br>
comprises extracts derived from Ayurvedic plants selected from the following group:<br>
Ocimum sanctum 10-40%, Glycerrhiza glabra 10-25%, Curcuma longa 2-20%, Zingiber<br>
officinale 1-10%, Adhatoda vasika 10-25%, Solanum indicum 1-10% Saussurea lappa 1-5%,<br>
Piper cubeba 1-5%, Terminalia belerica 1-10%, Aloe barbadensis 10-30%, Inula racemosa<br>
2-10%, Clerodendrum serratum 1-5%, Solanum xanthocorpum 1-5%, Piper longum 1-5%,<br>
Alpinia galanga 1-5%, Terminalia chebula 5-15%, Embelica officinalis 5-15%.<br>
The basic goal of any treatment of retained placenta is to return the cow's reproductive tract<br>
to a normal state as quickly as possible. There are generally two methods of managing<br>
 <br>
retained placenta when no systemic involvements are present - manual removal and natural<br>
separation.<br>
Manual removal has long been a common practice but should not be used because of possible<br>
injury to the delicate lining of the uterus. Some type of antibiotic or antiseptic solution may<br>
be placed in the uterus as prescribed by a veterinarian.<br>
If the membranes are not released due to poor uterine conditions, the afterbirth may detach<br>
without damage by applying slight tension externally to the fetal membranes.<br>
Based on the recent research on retained placenta, the most common recommendation is to<br>
allow the placenta to separate naturally with or without use of medication. Hormones such as.<br>
prostaglandins, estrogens and oxytocin may be used to evacuate fluid and debris from the<br>
uterus. If evacuation is not successful with hormonal therapy, uterine palpation and irrigation<br>
may be recommended using warm water, followed by treatment with antibiotic solution.<br>
Series of treatments are more effective than a single treatment. The length and number of<br>
treatments considered &amp; selection of one or more antibiotics should be determined on an<br>
individual basis as recommended by the veterinarian.<br>
The use of glucocorticoid hormones to induce early or timed parturition also results in<br>
approximately 67% of the retained placentas.<br>
Considering the huge economic losses this postpartum disorder of retention of placenta might<br>
cause, as they occur in the most productive period of the lactation, it becomes essential to have preventive measures against the condition. This will ensure the profitability of dairy farm business;<br>
 <br>
Animal population need not to depend upon hormonal injections, which are not affordable to most of the livestock owners. The prolonged use of hormone therapy to cure retention of placenta in animals causes abnormalities among the animals.<br>
Hence there is a need to develop safer alternatives, which is aimed to cure the state of retention of placenta in cattle and buffaloes. The present invention relates to herbal veterinary medicine which can be used for the treatment of retained placenta in cattle and buffaloes. In the composition, the plants have been used in different combinations, based on the information provided by grassroots innovators. Though, some plant, ^ingredients of this preparation may have been used, but the synergic combination of these elements, their relative amount and method of preparation made it more effectual and inimitable than other available products.<br>
OBJECTIVES OF THE CURRENT INVENTION<br>
A primary object of the present invention is to provide herbal compositions for prevention<br>
and treatment of retention of placenta in cattle and buffaloes.<br>
It is a further object to provide safe and non-toxic compositions that will not harm cattle,<br>
humans or the environment.<br>
It is still another object to provide compositions that can be used without burdensome safety<br>
precautions.<br>
It is still another object to provide compositions which can be inexpensively produced or<br>
employed.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide a method of use of the herbal composition of<br>
the present invention.<br>
 <br>
SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the herbal composition employing Ami {Chlerodendrum phlomides) - either alone or in combination with other herbs - to treat the retained placenta in cattle and buffaloes. The fresh or dried parts of the plant/s or the extracts can be used. Various dosage forms can also be prepared taking into', account the administration of the said composition to the animals.<br>
Clerodendrum phlomidis L.f. is a shrubs 1.5-3 (-4) m tall, stem ashy-grey, branches pubescent. Leaves opposite, ovate to rhomboid-ovate, 1.5-5 cm long, 1-3 cm broad, entire to sinuate-crenate, subacute-obtuse; petiole up to 2.5 cm long, densely hirsute. Cymes dichotomously branched, axillary, forming a rounded terminal panicle. Flowers creamy-white or pale yellowish, c. 1.5 cm across; pedicels 5-10 mm long, densely hirsute; bracts ovate lanceolate. Calyx campanulate, glabrous, pale or somewhat yellowish green, somewhat inflated, 5-lobed; lobes 4-5 mm. long, ovate-triangulate, Corolla-tube 2-2.5 cm long, much narrower than the calyx, pubescent externally; lobes 5, subequal, ovate-elliptic, 7-8 mm long, obtuse. Drape obovoid, 8-12 mm long, black, wrinkled, usually 4-lobed, enclosed by the persistent calyx; seeds oblong, white.<br>
Clerodendrum phlomides has been reported for its anti-oxidative / anti-inflammatory properties, use in muscular/joint pain, use in allergic conditions, antitumour properties, protection against infectious agents, hypolipidemic and hypotensive properties, psychopharmacological/CNS properties, bronchodilator properties, antidiarrhoel and antiulcer properties, larvicidal- activities, use in curing' prolapse/hernia, control of ectoparasites,, inhibitory properties of the plant against Angiotensin converting enzyme.<br>
 <br>
There are quite a few reports of Chlerodendrum phlomides. for promoting reproductive functions. The plant was studied for its antifertility potential by Maurya et al (2004) and-found useful in fertility regulation. Roots of Clerodendrum, viscosum (Verbenaceae) is employed by Himalyan tribes for spermatorrhoea (Agarwal, 2006). The genus had effective role in reducing inflammatory agents providing sufficient reasoning to be used to cure retention of placenta. The review of literature also suggest its having strong antifertility activity and hence may have ecbolic action. The use of plant for enhancing sperm count also illustrates its effective action over reproductive system.<br>
In one embodiment, the whole plant is fed as such to animal for immediate expulsion placenta. The time for administration is when the placenta does not fall after 6-10 hours of calving. The present invention relates to veterinary medicine and can be used for inducing a stable retention state and a rest state in cattle and buffaloes.<br>
ADVANTAGES OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
The availability of Clerodendrum phlomides is plenty and hence has tremendous scope against hormonal injections, and the cost of administering the treatment is reduced. Users need not depend on veterinary institutions as the dosage and applications are simple they can follow up the practice with ease.<br>
Animal population needs not to depend upon hormonal injections, which are not affordable to most of the livestock owners and have adverse side effects.<br>
It provides natural, non-toxic, eco-friendly and user-friendly alternative to the existing<br>
hormone therapy.<br>
