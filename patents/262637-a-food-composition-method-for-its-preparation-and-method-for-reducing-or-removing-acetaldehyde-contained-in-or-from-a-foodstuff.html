FOOD COMPOSITION FOR BINDING ACETALDEHYDE IN THE MOUTH AND<br>
THE DIGESTIVE TRACT AND A METHOD FOR PREPARING THE COMPOSITION<br>
The invention relates to a food composition according to the preamble of Claim 1 and a<br>
method according to the preamble of Claim 23 for the preparation of such a food composi-<br>
tion. The invention also relates to a method according to the preamble of Claim 32 to re-<br>
duce or remove the acetaldehyde contained in a foodstuff from the foodstuff, a composi-<br>
tion according to the preamble of Claim 33, which is added to the foodstuff, and the use of<br>
compounds containing acetaldehyde according to the preamble of Claim 35 to prepare the<br>
food composition.<br>
Both alcohol and smoking are risk factors for upper digestive tract cancers, and the com-<br>
bined use thereof multiplies the risk of developing an upper digestive tract cancer to as<br>
much as 150-fold (Salaspuro, M. Best Pract Res Clin. Gastroenterol (2003) 17:679 - 94<br>
and Francheschi et al. Cancer Res (1990) 50:6502 - 07).<br>
The first metabolite of alcohol is acetaldehyde. It has been shown to be carcinogenic both<br>
to test animals and humans (Salaspuro, M. Crit Rev Clin Lab Sci (2003) 40: 183 - 208).<br>
Alcohol is evenly distributed in the liquid phase of the organs. Hence, after enjoying alco-<br>
hol and as long as there is alcohol in the organs, the alcohol content in blood, saliva, gastric<br>
juice and the contents of the intestine is the same. In that case, the microbes in the diges-<br>
tive tract are capable of oxidizing the alcohol to acetaldehyde. As the aldehyde dehydro-<br>
genase enzyme of the liver removes the acetaldehyde thus generated, no alcohol can accu- •<br>
mulate in the liver, where the metabolism of alcohol mainly takes place.<br>
Asian heavy drinkers, who have a familial low-activity modification of the aldehyde dehy-<br>
drogenase-2 (ALDH2) enzyme, have both an increased risk of developing a cancer of the<br>
mouth, the pharynx and the digestive tract, and an increased acetaldehyde content of the<br>
saliva after consuming alcohol (Vakevainen et al. (2000) Alcohol Clin Exp Res 24:873 -<br>
877). Even more common is the ADH3*1 gene/allele (ADH1C at present), which predis-<br>
poses the heavy drinkers, who have this gene, to the upper digestive tract cancers because<br>
of increased local acetaldehyde contents. (Visapaa J-P et al. Gut. 2004 Jun; 53(6):871-6.)<br>
In the organism, acetaldehyde is thus formed from alcohol as a consequence of the hepatic<br>
metabolism and, locally, in the digestive tract via microbial alcohol dehydrogenase and<br><br>
WO 2006/103316	PCT/FI2006/000104<br>
2<br>
that of mucous membrane cells (Salaspuro et al, (1996) Ann Med 28:195 - 200). For ex-<br>
ample, even after a moderate dose of ethanol (0.5 g/kg), high acetaldehyde contents of a<br>
microbial origin (18 - 143 M) have been found in human saliva; in other words, acetalde-<br>
hyde mainly builds up in saliva as an intermediate product of the microbial metabolism; in<br>
addition, it is also produced by the mucous membrane cells and salivary glands (Homann<br>
et al, Carcinogenesis (1997) 18:1739 - 1743).<br>
As a consequence of the microbial metabolism, acetaldehyde also builds up in the stomach<br>
in the case, where the stomach is free from acid or has been made acid-free by medication<br>
(Vakevainen et al, (2000) Alimentary Pharmacology Ther 14:1511 - 1518). It has also<br>
been shown that acetaldehyde builds up in the large intestine, as its bacteria that represent<br>
the normal flora are capable of converting ethanol into acetaldehyde (Jokelainen et al,<br>
(1996) Gut 39:100-104),<br>
In the intestines, endogenous ethanoi can also be found, i.e. ethanol that is formed in the<br>
intestines in oxygen-free conditions under the effect of microbes. Acetaldehyde is formed,<br>
when this ethanol comes into contact with oxygen near the mucous membrane, for exam-<br>
ple.<br>
For atrophic gastritis patients, microbes produce high acetaldehyde contents from ethanol<br>
in the stomach, possibly leading to an enhanced gastric cancer risk among atrophic gastritis<br>
patients (Vakevainen et al, Scand J Gastroenterol 2002 (6):648 - 655).<br>
Acetaldehyde is formed in the mouth, the pharynx and the upper respiratory ducts also as a<br>
consequence of smoking and exposure to air contamination (passive smoking, fumes, ex-<br>
haust gases, etc.). It has been proven that chronic smoking increases the acetaldehyde pro-<br>
duction of a microbial origin in saliva. Salaspuro et al. (2004) Int J Cancer, 2004 Sep 10;<br>
111(4):480 — 3) have proven that the average in vivo acetaldehyde concentration in saliva<br>
is about two times higher for smokers than for non-smokers after enjoying ethanol, the<br>
control time being 160 minutes. During the time consumed by smoking, the in vivo acetal-<br>
dehyde in saliva was increased to ten-fold from the level it was after enjoying ethanol only.<br>
During active smoking, the acetaldehyde in saliva was increased to a value of 261.4±45.5<br>
M from the basic level. The average amount of saliva secreted by a human is 1.5 litres per<br>
day. The areas of influence of the acetaldehyde contained in the saliva include the mouth,<br>
the pharynx, the aesophagus and the ventricle.<br><br>
WO 2006/103316	PCT/FI2006/000104<br>
3<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions containing compounds that bind acetaldehyde are known<br>
from before, their effect being based on the reaction of the effective substances with the<br>
acetaldehyde inside blood and/or cells, for example, US 5 202 354, US 4 496 548, US<br>
4 528 295, US 5 922 346.<br>
Acetaldehyde, which is formed in the organism when alcohol is consumed and thereafter,<br>
also causes physiological symptoms called a hangover. Previously, efforts have been made<br>
to decrease the symptoms caused by acetaldehyde by taking preparations containing ascor-<br>
bic acid, thiamine, cysteine or cysteic acid, and flavonoids or fiavonoid complexes in a<br>
form of orally taken tablets in connection with, before or after consuming alcohol. When<br>
swallowed, the effective substances go to the stomach and from there into the blood circu-<br>
lation (Matsuoka, US Pat No 5,202,354 and Moldowan et al, US Pat No 4,496,548).<br>
Suggestions have been made so as to use preparations containing amino acids, such as L-<br>
cysteine, methionine, taurine or arginine, ascorbic acid, vitamins A and E, which are<br>
sucked or chewed in the mouth, to reduce the effect of detrimental free radical compounds,<br>
which are formed when using tobacco products or being exposed to the same. It is believed<br>
that, after being absorbed, amino acids affect various tissues (Hersch, US Pat No<br>
5,922,346, Hersch, International Patent Application No PCT/US98/12617).<br>
Publication WO 02/36098 suggests the use of compounds containing a free sulphhydryl<br>
and/or amino group for a local and long-term binding of acetaldehyde from saliva, the<br>
stomach or the large intestine. The compounds were mixed with a substance that enabled<br>
them to be released for at least 30 minutes in the conditions of the mouth, the stomach or<br>
the large intestine.<br>
As on the basis of recent studies, acetaldehyde plays a considerable part in the pathogene-<br>
sis of the upper digestive tract cancers, there is a need to find alternative ways to bind acet-<br>
aldehyde in the mouth and the digestive tract in a harmless manner.<br>
The purpose of the present invention is to provide new compositions, which are suitable to<br>
be used in foodstuffs and which can be consumed to reduce the acetaldehyde content in the<br>
entire digestive tract, and especially in the mouth, the pharynx, the oesophagus, the ventri-<br>
cle, and the large intestine, or to remove the acetaldehyde.<br>
In principle, the acetaldehyde can originate in any source, such as a foodstuff containing<br>
acetaldehyde. The acetaldehyde can have been formed from the ethanol contained in the<br><br>
WO 2006/103316	PCT/FI2006/000104<br>
4<br>
foodstuff or it can have been formed from endogenous ethanol occurring in the organism<br>
or from the precursors of the acetaldehyde as a consequence of the metabolism, for exam-<br>
ple, sugars - acetate - acetaldehyde. The purpose of the invention is to reduce the risk of<br>
developing cancers of the mouth, the pharynx, and the digestive tract, which are caused by<br>
the acetaldehyde occurring in the said areas.<br>
The present invention is directed at a food composition, to which one or more acetalde-<br>
hyde-binding compounds have been added.<br>
To be more precise, the composition according to the invention is characterized in that,<br>
which is presented in the characterizing part of Claim 1.<br>
According to the invention, compounds containing one or more free sulphhydryl and/or<br>
amino groups are added to foodstuffs, which are consumed with the object of reducing the<br>
risk of developing cancers of the mouth, the pharynx, the digestive tract, especially the<br>
ventricle and the large intestine. Consuming the food compositions according to the inven-<br>
tion mainly binds acetaldehyde locally, but it may also have a systemic effect.<br>
Another object of the invention comprises the method according to the characterizing part<br>
of Claim 23 for the preparation of the food composition.<br>
The dosing of pharmaceutical compositions containing acetaldehyde-binding compounds,<br>
for example, in aqueous solutions is presented by patent publication US 4,528,295. Patent<br>
publication WO 02/098405 suggests the use of cysteine-containing inhibitors to inhibit<br>
liver fibrosis and liver diseases, such as cirrhosis. According to the publication, the inhibi-<br>
tor can be in the form of drugs or foods or drinks. Publications JP 4021635 and IP<br>
61134313 suggest adding a dipeptide that contains alanine or a substance that contains<br>
alpha-alanine to drinks to reduce the toxicity of the acetaldehyde. However, the known<br>
technique does not suggest the addition of compounds capable of binding acetaldehyde to<br>
foodstuffs, especially to the food products directed at consumers.<br>
The present invention also relates to food compositions, which contain acetaldehyde or<br>
where acetaldehyde has formed, and to which one or more acetaldehyde-binding com-<br>
pounds have been added. According to the invention, the acetaldehyde-binding compounds<br>
can be allowed to fully or partially bind the acetaldehyde in the foodstuff. If the acetalde-<br>
hyde-binding compound has been added to the foodstuff in an amount sufficient to bind the<br><br>
WO 2006/103316	PCT/FI2006/000104<br>
5<br>
acetaldehyde in the food composition, the foodstuff delivered to the consumers does not<br>
contain essential amounts of acetaldehyde, but only its harmless degradation products.<br>
Accordingly, the object of the invention comprises the method according to the character-<br>
izing part of Claim 32 to reduce or remove the acetaldehyde contained in a foodstuff.<br>
Another object of the invention comprises a solid or liquid composition according to the<br>
characterizing part of Claim 33 that is added to the foodstuff.<br>
A further object of the invention comprises the use of the acetaldehyde-binding compounds<br>
according to the characterizing part of Claim 35 to prepare the food composition.<br>
The invention provides considerable advantages. The food compositions containing acetal-<br>
dehyde-binding compounds can be used to reduce the risk of developing the cancer of the<br>
mouth, the pharynx, the oesophagus, the ventricle, and the small and large intestines. In<br>
particular, the compositions according to the invention can be used for large-scale consum-<br>
ers of alcohol, smokers and those, who have a familial low-activity modification of the<br>
aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (ALDH2) enzyme or the ADH3*1 gene/allele (ADH1C*1 at<br>
present), and for those who suffer from atrophic gastritis. The use of the compositions ac-<br>
cording to the invention is also of benefit to those who consume moderate amounts of al-<br>
cohol or who consume foodstuffs that contain small contents of alcohol or acetaldehyde.<br>
By adding the compounds to the food products aimed at consumers, the use of acetalde-<br>
hyde-binding compounds can be extended and made a part of everyday life; on the other<br>
hand, it can yet be directed at groups of people who use alcohol on a regular basis or who<br>
smoke or have the familial low-activity modification of the aldehyde dehydrogenase-2<br>
(ALDH2) enzyme or the ADH3*1 gene/allele (ADH1C at present).<br>
Removing or reducing the acetaldehyde, which is in foodstuffs or which forms in the food-<br>
stuffs, before the foodstuff is delivered to the consumers, reduces or removes the amount<br>
of acetaldehyde entering the mouth or the digestive tract and reduces the risk of contracting<br>
cancers of these areas. If the acetaldehyde-binding compound, which is added to bind the<br>
acetaldehyde in the foodstuff, is fully consumed to bind the acetaldehyde, there is the ad-<br>
vantage that the acetaldehyde-binding compound will not give the food composition an<br>
extra flavour. On the other hand, if the acetaldehyde-binding compound is not consumed to<br>
bind the acetaldehyde in the foodstuff, the acetaldehyde-binding compound travels along<br>
with food to the mouth and the digestive tract to bind the acetaldehyde hi these areas.<br><br>

In the following, the present invention is examined more closely with the aid of a detailed<br>
description and examples of application.<br>
A "food composition" refers to any solid, semi-solid, or liquid foodstuff, also a drinkable<br>
liquid, which is suitable for food.<br>
A "food product" refers to any foodstuff that is suitable for food, especially one that is<br>
packed, bottled or, in another way, prepared to be delivered to consumers. The product<br>
meant for consumers also means, among others, that the markings of the product be intellir<br>
gible to consumers. The food product can also be, for example, a food product that is de-<br>
livered to a restaurant or a shop to be conveyed to the consumers.<br>
A "drink composition" refers to any drinkable liquid that is suitable for food.<br>
A "drink product" refers to any drinkable liquid, especially one that is packed or bottled to<br>
be delivered to consumers. Thus, the product does not refer to drinking water or juice sup-<br>
plied to humans or animals in laboratory tests, for example.<br>
"Domestic water" refers to water that is delivered from the water utility to the consumers;<br>
it can also be called tap water.<br>
A "product that is added to the foodstuff' refers to a food composition in particular, which<br>
is packed, bottled or, in some other way, prepared for consumers; for example, provided<br>
with clear markings for the consumer.<br>
A "consumer package" refers to a foodstuff package aimed at consumers, such as a food or<br>
drink package, which is packed or bottled or, in some other way, prepared for the con-<br>
sumer. The package preferably contains clear markings indicating the contents, the purpose<br>
of use and the way of using the product. The markings for consumers, for example, mean<br>
that no pharmaceutical education should be needed for one to be able to read the markings.<br>
The term "consumer" herein is used in its conventional sense. Furthermore, the consumer<br>
may refer to the employees of a shop selling foodstuffs, a restaurant or the food industry.<br>
The digestive tract herein refers to the human or animal digestive tracts, the human diges-<br>
tive tract, in particular. The methods described by the invention could also be used to re-<br>
duce the cancers of animal digestive tracts.<br><br>
WO 2006/103316	PCT/FI2006/000104<br>
7<br>
An "acetaldehyde-binding substance" refers to a compound containing one or more free<br>
sulphhydryl and/or amino groups, preferably a sulphhydryl and an amino group. "Com-<br>
pound" may be used to refer to one or more compounds.<br>
Cysteine and its derivatives are especially well suited to the purpose according to the in-<br>
vention. The most suitable amino acids for the use according to the invention comprise L-<br>
and D-cysteines, acetylcysteine or the derivatives of cysteine, or salts, especially water-<br>
soluble derivatives or water-soluble salts, which function in the same way as the L- or D-<br>
cysteines. The most preferred compound is L-cysteine.<br>
The "binding of acetaldehyde" refers to a chemical reaction between the acetaldehyde and<br>
the compound that has a free sulphhydryl and/or amino group, wherein the acetaldehyde<br>
jointly with the "acetaldehyde-binding substance" forms a larger molecule and water can<br>
be formed in the reaction. For example, when reacting with cysteine, the acetaldehyde<br>
binds itself both to the sulphhydryl and the amino group and forms 2-methyl-L-<br>
thiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid and water. The acetaldehyde can bind itself to the amino<br>
group of almost any protein, whereby Schiff's base or a 2-methyl-imidazole ring is formed.<br>
According to the invention, the compounds obtained from acetaldehyde by chemically<br>
binding are safe for the organism.<br>
Suitable compounds for binding acetaldehyde in the organism also include the compounds<br>
according to the formula (I):<br><br>
wherein<br>
R1 is hydrogen or an acyl group with 1-4 carbon atoms;<br>
R2 is a sulphhydryl or sulphone group;<br>
n is 1 or 2.<br>
The scope of the invention also includes salts of the compounds according to Formula I,<br>
water-soluble salts in particular.<br><br>
WO 2006/103316	PCT/FI2006/000104<br>
8<br>
Amino acids or other compounds that suitably bind acetaldehyde and contain a free<br>
sulphhydryl (SH) and/or amino (NH2) group include, for example:<br>
L-cysteine,<br>
D-cysteine,<br>
cysteic acid,<br>
cysteine glycine,<br>
threo or erythro--phenyl-DL-cysteine,<br>
-tetramethylene-DL-cysteine,<br>
methionine,<br>
D-penicillamine and its dipeptides with N-terminals,<br>
semicarbazide,<br>
reduced glutathione,<br>
P-mercaptoethylamine,<br>
D, L-homocysteine,<br>
N-acetylcysteine,<br>
L-cysteinyl-L-valine,<br>
P-p-tetramethylene-DL-cysteine,<br>
cysteinyl-glycine,<br>
mercaptoethylglycine,<br>
tre-(5)-p-phenyl-DL-cysteine,<br>
erythro-beta-phenyl-DL-cysteine,<br>
cysteine hydrochloride,<br>
miarrrinhydrochloride,<br>
sodiummetabisulphite,<br>
mercaptanes.<br>
The scope of the invention also includes salts of the compounds, water-soluble salts in par-<br>
ticular.<br>
However, only those acetaldehyde-binding compounds, which are suitable for foodstuffs,<br>
can be applied to the products according to the present invention. These compounds should<br>
not cause a health hazard in the amounts used.<br><br>
WO 2006/103316	PCT/FI2006/000104<br>
9<br>
A "harmfol/carcinogenic content of acetaldehyde" in the human mouth, oesophagus, ven-<br>
tricle, and large intestine is 20 to 800 mol/1 of saliva or the contents of the intestine, a<br>
content of as low as about 20 to 50 uM causing carcinogenic mutations on the cell level.<br>
Hence, it would be advisable to aim at a zero concentration of acetaldehyde in these areas.<br>
Keeping the acetaldehyde content essentially lower than without the use of the food com-<br>
position means that the acetaldehyde content should be kept at a level that is at least 20%,<br>
preferably over 40%, and most preferably over 60% lower than when not using the compo-<br>
sition according to the description of the invention.<br>
Such a harmful or carcinogenic content of acetaldehyde in the human mouth, oesophagus,<br>
stomach or large intestine can be obtained in connection with consuming alcoholic drinks,<br>
particularly strong alcoholic drinks, or foodstuffs containing alcohol, as a consequence of<br>
smoking or when consuming products containing acetaldehyde.<br>
"Alcoholic drinks" are ethanol-containing drinks, their ethanol content varying within<br>
0.7% by volume and 84% by volume."<br>
"Alcoholic foodstuffs" refer to foodstuffs containing at least 0.7% of ethanol. Such food-<br>
stuffs can be, for example, fermented juices or preserves, or foodstuffs preserved with<br>
small amounts of alcohol, pastries, jellies, and mousse seasoned with liqueur or corre-<br>
sponding products containing alcohol.<br>
The use of the products according to the invention can be of benefit even, when light alco-<br>
holic drinks are enjoyed or foodstuffs are consumed, which contain small amounts of alco-<br>
hol.<br>
Some foodstuffs as such can also contain acetaldehyde. Acetaldehyde is contained in food-<br>
stuffs, which have ethanol that is generated in connection with fermentation, such as beer,<br>
cider, wine, home-brewed beer, and other alcoholic drinks, as well as many juices. In cer-<br>
tain foodstuffs, such as some milk products, acetaldehyde is used for preservation purposes<br>
and to add flavour, or the acetaldehyde is formed in the product as a consequence of rm-<br>
crobial activity. For example, sugary juices or sugar-containing foodstuffs, in general, pro-<br>
vide a good substrate for microbes. High concentrations of acetaldehyde are formed, for<br>
example, in fermented milk products, such as yoghurt. The microbes used to make yoghurt<br>
produce acetaldehyde in the yoghurt As for alcoholic drinks, sherry and Calvados contain<br>
especially large amounts of acetaldehyde.<br><br>

The amount of acetaldehyde in a foodstuff can be defined by standard methods that are<br>
well known by those skilled in the art, such as liquid or gas chromatographic methods.<br>
Acetaldehyde can be defined, for example, by means of the gas chromatographic method,<br>
which is described in the publication Homann et al. 1997. High acetaldehyde levels in sa-<br>
liva after ethanol consumption: Methodological aspects and pathogenic implications. Car-<br>
cinogenesis 18:1739-1743, (see also Salaspuro V and Salaspuro M: Synergistic effect of<br>
alcohol drinking and smoking on in vivo acetaldehyde concentration in saliva. Int J Cancer<br>
2004; 111:480-483). In that case, it is possible to calculate the amount of acetaldehyde-<br>
binding compound that is needed to bind the acetaldehyde in the foodstuff. If the acetalde-<br>
hyde concentrations in the foodstuff are from 50 to 500 M, for example, the amount of<br>
acetaldehyde-binding compound, such as cysteine, to bind the same, is about 0.1 to 5.0<br>
mM according to our studies; in some cases, a cysteine concentration of 1 to 10 mM may<br>
be enough; in other words, the amount of cysteine to be added is about 12.1 mg/1 to 6.05<br>
g/1 or, correspondingly, from 121 mg/1 to 1.21 g/1 of foodstuff. Naturally, the amount of<br>
acetaldehyde-binding compound that is added to the foodstuff can be higher, if the idea is<br>
to carry the acetaldehyde-binding compound to the organism along with the foodstuff.<br>
The compounds capable of binding acetaldehyde should be allowed to react with the acet-<br>
aldehyde in the food composition for a sufficiently long time in suitable conditions. It is<br>
preferable to mix the acetaldehyde-binding compounds with the product as well as possi-<br>
ble. The reaction is preferably allowed to take place at room temperature during 5 to 30<br>
min, preferably during 5 to 15 min.<br>
"hi connection with consuming alcoholic drinks" herein refers to the period of time that<br>
begins from starring to enjoy alcohol and ends, when there is no more alcohol in the blood.<br>
"hi connection with smoking" herein refers to the period of time that begins from starting<br>
to smoke and ends, when smoking is stopped.<br>
The foodstuff, to which one or more acetaldehyde-binding compounds are added, can<br>
comprise cereal or baking products, milk, milk products or, generally, milk dishes, meat,<br>
meat products or meat dishes, fish, fish products or fish dishes, fat, oil, fat or oil products,<br>
eggs, potatoes, confectionery, fruit or berry dishes, vegetables, vegetable dishes, salads,<br>
salt, sugar, sweets, spices, relishes and various dietary supplements, snacks, and various<br>
drinks and alcoholic drinks, health foods and preserved foods. On the whole, the acetalde-<br>
hyde-binding compound(s) can be added to any foodstuff aimed at consumers. Typically,<br><br>
WO 2006/103316	PCT/FI2006/000104<br>
11<br>
the foodstuff is packed in larger or smaller quantities and it is delivered directly to the con-<br>
sumer or, for example to a restaurant or a shop, which sells the foodstuff in smaller quanti-<br>
ties to the consumers.<br>
In particular, it is preferable to add acetaldehyde-binding compounds to foodstuffs that<br>
remain in the stomach for a longer period of time, typically, more than half an hour or to<br>
foodstuffs or substances used in foodstuffs, which do not decompose or which decompose<br>
poorly in the digestive tract and thus work as carriers of the acetaldehyde-binding com-<br>
pounds, carrying them deeper into the intestines.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the acetaldehyde-binding com-<br>
pounds) is added to various cereal or bakery products, such as buns to serve with coffee,<br>
biscuits, crackers, bread, breakfast cereals, sugary pastries, salty pastries, flour, pasta,<br>
pizza, porridge, or rice and various rice products, corn and com products.<br>
It is preferable to add the acetaldehyde-binding compound to various preserves or their<br>
preserving liquid, e.g., preserved vegetables or greens, such as pickled cucumbers, pickles,<br>
preserved sweet peppers, tomatoes, squash or mushrooms.<br>
According to another preferred embodiment of the invention, the acetaldehyde-binding<br>
compound(s) is added to milk or milk products, such as milk desserts, milk sauces, sour<br>
milk, soured whole milk, cheese, ice-cream or yoghurt. In particular, it is preferable to add<br>
the acetaldehyde-binding compounds to products that remain in the stomach for a longer<br>
period of time, such as sour milk, soured whole milk, and yoghurt.<br>
According to another preferred embodiment of the invention, the acetaldehyde-binding<br>
compound(s) is added to various snacks, such as potato chips, corn chips, cheese snacks,<br>
popcorn, nuts, raisins, almonds, crackers, and dried fruits.<br>
As high acetaldehyde contents occur both in the mouth and the digestive system in connec-<br>
tion with enjoying alcohol and smoking, in particular, it is preferable to add acetaldehyde-<br>
binding compound(s) to products, which are possibly consumed in connection with drink-<br>
ing alcohol or smoking, in particular. Such products include various snacks and savouries.<br>
On the other hand, acetaldehyde-binding compound(s) can be added to food that is served<br>
in connection with enjoying alcoholic drinks, for example. This can be effected by adding<br>
a seasoning mixture containing acetaldehyde-binding compounds to meat or fish dishes. As<br><br>
WO 2006/103316	PCT/FI2006/000104<br>
12<br>
seasoning mixtures as such have a strong taste, the taste of the acetaldehyde-binding com-<br>
pounds is hidden under the taste of the mixture.<br>
The amount of acetaldehyde-binding compound(s) that is added depends on the amounts of<br>
these foodstuffs the consumer is most likely to enjoy at one time. The amount of added<br>
substances also depends on, whether the foodstuff in question already contains acetalde-<br>
hyde-binding compounds, such as cysteine. The amount of substances to be added also<br>
depends on, whether the foodstuff already contains acetaldehyde. For example, 1 to 5000<br>
mg/kg, preferably 5 to 4000 mg/kg, more preferably 5 to 3000 mg/kg, even more prefera-<br>
bly 5 to 2000 mg/kg, still more preferably 5 to 1000 mg/kg, even more preferably 5 to 500<br>
mg/kg, even more preferably 5 to 300 mg/kg, most preferably 5 to 100 mg of acetalde-<br>
hyde-binding compound per kilo of food composition can be added to the product. The<br>
amount added to salted peanuts or a steak, for example, can be 1 to 500 mg, typically 5 to<br>
500 mg of cysteine/100g. The amount of added acetaldehyde-binding compounds also de-<br>
pends on how well the foodstuff in question is able to cover the taste of the acetaldehyde-<br>
binding compounds. When calculating the amount of a suitable acetaldehyde-binding<br>
compound per day, it is preferably no more than 100 mg per a kilo of a person's weight,<br>
more preferably no more than 80 mg/kg, even more preferably no more than 60 mg/kg,<br>
still more preferably no more than 40 mg/kg, further and more preferably no more than 20<br>
mg/kg. The amount of acetaldehyde-binding compound is most preferably no more than 10<br>
mg/kg, preferably no more than 5 mg per a kilo of a person's weight. A single dose of ac-<br>
etaldehyde-binding compounds is preferably no more than 5000 mg, preferably no more<br>
than 4000 mg, more preferably no more than 3000 mg, even more preferably no more than<br>
2000 mg, still more preferably no more than 1000 mg, more preferably no more than 500<br>
mg, even more preferably no more than 400 mg, most preferably no more than 300 mg,<br>
suitably 100 to 300 mg, typically 100 to 200 mg.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the acetaldehyde-binding com-<br>
pound(S) is added to various drinks, such as juices, sports drinks, soft drinks, spring water,<br>
waters, coffee and tea, milk, sour milk, special drinks, such as soy drink.<br>
It is preferable to add acetaldehyde-binding compounds, for example, to mineral waters,<br>
soda waters or waters that are served together with alcoholic drinks, or to dilute the same.<br>
In that case, the drink may have a slight taste, such as the taste of lemon, which slightly<br>
covers the possible taste of the acetaldehyde-binding compounds.<br><br>
WO 2006/103316	PCT/FI2006/000104<br>
13<br>
It is especially preferable to add the acetaldehyde-binding compound(s) to various alco-<br>
holic drinks, beer, wine and strong alcohol. Regarding these, it is preferable to add the ac-<br>
etaldehyde-binding compound particularly to drinks that as such have high acetaldehyde<br>
contents. It is especially preferable to add acetaldehyde-binding compounds to ice cubes,<br>
for example, as the acetaldehyde-binding compounds contained in them dissolve at a suit-<br>
able pace during the time the alcohol or other drinks are being consumed.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the acetaldehyde-binding com-<br>
pound(S) is added to domestic water. The compounds can be added already at the water<br>
utility at a suitable process stage before the water is delivered to the consumers. Alterna-<br>
tively, consumers may have at their disposal a special tap having a device connected<br>
thereto distributing acetaldehyde-binding compounds, such as an adapter or a filter at-<br>
tached to the end of the tap, from which for example cysteine is dissolved in the tap water.<br>
An alternative structure may be a distributing device, such as an automat, which mixes<br>
acetaldehyde-binding compounds with the desired drinks, such as soft drinks, beer or min-<br>
eral water. It is preferable, if such a distributor can be switched on and off, when so de-<br>
sired. Such a distributor or tap adapter is also advantageous in restaurants, where water, ice<br>
or other drinks containing acetaldehyde-binding compounds could be served to the cus-<br>
tomers in connection with selling and serving alcoholic drinks and tobacco. Such a dis-<br>
tributor or tap adapter is also advantageous in hospitals that treat patients, who suffer from<br>
atrophic gastritis or use preventive medication for gastric acid secretion, or other patients<br>
who have exceptional problems with acetaldehyde.<br>
The adapter that is connected to the tap has preferably a structure that allows the adapter to<br>
be attached to the tap so that the water coming from the tap runs through the adapter. A<br>
carrier, such a filter, which releases one or more acetaldehyde-binding compounds, can<br>
preferably be connected to the adapter, water running through the filter, whereby the acet-<br>
aldehyde-binding compound dissolves in the water coming from the tap along with a water<br>
jet The adapter can preferably be switched off, when so desired.<br>
The adapter according to the description can also be used in treating liquids other than wa-<br>
ter. For example, beer, soft drinks and mineral water can be dosed through such an adapter.<br>
Acetaldehyde-binding compounds can be added to mineral waters, spring waters or other<br>
bottled or packed waters in connection with the bottling/packaging.<br><br>
WO 2006/103316	PCT/FI2006/000104<br>
14<br>
Alternatively, a product, which is intended to be added to a certain amount of liquid or<br>
solid or semi-solid foodstuff, can be distributed to consumers. Depending on the amount of<br>
certain foodstuffs usually consumed, the amount of acetaldehyde-binding compounds in<br>
the product added to the foodstuff can be calculated accurately enough and give dosing<br>
instructions to the consumers. The product can be, for example, suited to a bottled con-<br>
sumer package, whereby it will be no problem for the consumer to calculate the adequate<br>
quantity of dosing.<br>
The acetaldehyde-binding compound is added to drinkable liquids, for example, in an<br>
amount of 1 to 5000 mg/1, preferably 5 to 4000 mg/1, more preferably 5 to 3000 mg/1, even<br>
more preferably 5 to 2000 mg/1, still more preferably 5 to 1000 mg/1, more preferably 5 to<br>
500 mg/1, more preferably 5 to 300 mg/1, most preferably 5 to 100 mg of acetaldehyde-<br>
binding compound per liter of drink product. For example, 5 to 2000 mg/1 of cysteine can<br>
be added to mineral water, and 50 to 500 mg to 8 cl of cognac.<br>
When preparing the food compositions according to the description of the invention, the<br>
acetaldehyde-binding compounds can be added in a solid or liquid form as such or with<br>
various carriers or additives. Several acetaldehyde-binding compounds, such as cysteine,<br>
can be added as aqueous solutions to foodstuffs, or aqueous solutions can be made from<br>
the compounds. As the acetaldehyde-binding compound in a soluble form is capable of<br>
immediately binding acetaldehyde in the stomach, when going to the stomach, drinks con-<br>
taining acetaldehyde, cysteine in particular, work effectively. In addition to the solid form<br>
and the solution, the acetaldehyde-binding compounds can also be added to foodstuffs as<br>
various mixtures, dispersions, gels or emulsion, for example. It is preferable to add the<br>
acetaldehyde-binding compound in a form, such as gel, which releases the acetaldehyde-<br>
binding compound in a prolonged way. Such gels and other products are described in pub-<br>
lication WO 02/36098. The acetaldehyde-binding compound can also be added with oil or<br>
as a mixture of water and oil.<br>
The invention also relates to a solid, semi-solid or liquid product that is added to food-<br>
stuffs, containing at least one acetaldehyde-binding compound. Such a product can contain<br>
liquid or solid carriers or additives suitable for foodstuffs. The dosage of the product is<br>
preferably given per a certain foodstuff portion. The dosages and markings given to the<br>
consumers should be easy to read and understand. Suitable carriers and auxiliary sub-<br>
stances include, for example, various powdery or granular substances, carbohydrates,<br><br>
WO 2006/103316	PCT/FI2006/000104<br>
15<br>
starch, fibres, cellulose, proteins, glycoproteins, sugar alcohols, sugars, salt, spices, and<br>
spice mixtures, products dosed in liquid form, such as various aqueous solutions, oils,<br>
syrup and other carriers and auxiliary substances suitable for foodstuffs. The product can<br>
also contain various fillers, flavoring agents, scents, stabilizers, buffers and/or preserva-<br>
tives.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the acetaldehyde-binding com-<br>
pound can be added to a food, nutritional and/or drink component, which is capable of<br>
conveying the acetaldehyde-binding compound all the way to the small intestine and espe-<br>
cially to the large intestine. Such components may comprise various substances, which do<br>
not decompose or which decompose poorly in the digestive tract, such as cellulose, the<br>
derivatives of cellulose, glycoproteins, such as lactulose, or substances working in a corre-<br>
sponding way.<br>
According to another preferred embodiment of the invention, the food composition can<br>
contain acetaldehyde-binding compounds in a protected form so that the compounds are<br>
not released until in the small intestine, at the end of the small intestine, in particular, and<br>
in the large intestine, especially at its beginning. The protection of the acetaldehyde-<br>
binding compound can be provided, for example, by preparing pharmaceutical prepara-<br>
tions, such as granules, pellets, etc., which contain the acetaldehyde-binding compound<br>
and which are coated with a polymer film that is not dissolved until the pH in its environ-<br>
ment is 6.5 or higher. Alternatively, the protection can be provided, for example, by means<br>
of a component that does not dissolve until under the effect of the enzymes secreted by the<br>
bacteria in the large intestine. The component can be, for example, a polymer, which can<br>
be used as a filling agent in the preparation or in the granules contained by the preparation<br>
(WO 02/36098).<br>
A film coating made of polymers, which does not dissolve in the acidic environment of the<br>
stomach, can be formed on pharmaceutical tablets, capsules or granules, (e.g., D.R. Friend,<br>
Oral Colon-Specific Drug Delivery, CRC Press, Florida, ISBN 0-8493-6688-7, 1992). En-<br>
teric polymer refers to a polymer, the solubility of which depends on the pH. The solution<br>
pH of the film-forming polymer is preferably 6.0 to 7.5, most preferably 6.5 to 7.0.<br>
According to the description of the present invention, the acetaldehyde-binding com-<br>
pound(S) is preferably placed in the foodstuff inside pharmaceutical preparation, such as<br>
granules of pellets that are coated with an enteric film. When the granules reach the end of<br><br>
WO 2006/103316	PCT/FI2006/000104<br>
16<br>
the small intestine or the large intestine, the film is dissolved and the acetaldehyde-binding<br>
compounds are released and they act on the area of release.<br>
The polymer film can be formed, for example, from cellulose acetatephtalate, (CAP), such<br>
as the quality sold under Aquateric TM, a methacrylic acid derivative, such as Eudragit-S<br>
TM, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate, or hydroxypropyl methycellulose acetate<br>
succinate or the like, such as the grades sold under the trade name Aqouat TM. The gran-<br>
ules and pellets coated with the enteric film and the preparation thereof are described in<br>
patent publication WO 02/36098.<br>
An enteric tablet, the film coating of which does not dissolve until at the end of the small<br>
intestine or at the beginning of the large intestine, can have the following structure, for<br>
example. The amount of enteric polymer that forms the film can be 5 to 20%, most pref-<br>
erably 10 to i5% of the whole mass of the tablet. The filler can comprise pharmaceutical<br>
additives that do not swell, such as calcium hydrogen phosphate.<br>
The preparation can also comprise granules that contain an acetaldehyde-binding substance<br>
and are coated with an enteric film. The amount of film-forming enteric polymer in the<br>
entire mass of the granule can be 5 to 30%, most preferably 15 to 25%. The granule can<br>
comprise 20 to 40%, preferably about 30% of filler poorly soluble in water, such as cal-<br>
cium hydrogen phosphate.<br>
The binder of the granule that is coated with the enteric film can be an enteric polymer, the<br>
solution pH of which is 6.0 to 7.5, most preferably 6.5 to 7.0. The amount of binder in the<br>
granule is 2 to 5%, preferably 3 to 4%.<br>
The preparation according to the invention can also be a tablet containing the enteric<br>
coated granules described above, on which an enteric film has also been made. The tablet<br>
made for such a preparation not only comprises enteric granules, but also a filler suitable<br>
for direct compression, such as microcrystalline cellulose, the amount of which in the tab-<br>
let can be 30 to 70%, preferably 40 to 60%.<br>
The foodstuff can be any suitable solid, semi-solid or liquid foodstuff. It can preferably be<br>
a foodstuff with a pH of below 7, such as sour milk products, e.g., yoghurt, sour milk or<br>
sour whole milk<br>
In addition to the pH suitable for the purpose according to the invention, one advantage of<br>
the sour milk products is also the fact that the duration of the product is fairly short,<br><br>
WO 2006/103316	PCT/FI2006/000104<br>
17<br>
whereby a premature release of the acetaldehyde-binding compounds is unlikely. By na-<br>
ture, there is ethanol in the human large intestine; therefore, it is justifiable to add acetal-<br>
dehyde-binding compounds to products, which are consumed quite widely. A considerable<br>
advantage is that the taste of the acetaldehyde-binding compounds is not an issue, as the<br>
release of the compounds will not occur until in the small and large intestines. In that case,<br>
the compounds can be added in large quantities, when so desired, i.e., even in amounts,<br>
which at their highest can safely be recommended to humans per a kilo of weight.<br>
Tablets, capsules or granules, which remain in the stomach for a long time, can also be<br>
added to the food composition. The tablets, granules or corresponding preparations can be<br>
prepared so that they adhere to the mucous membrane of the stomach or float in the con-<br>
tents of the stomach. The preparations can be rendered fixable to the mucous membrane of<br>
the stomach by using as additives cationic polymers, such as various chitosan grades.<br>
Preparations that float in the stomach are provided by using polymers (e. g., alginic acid)<br>
that form a gel and by adding to the preparation sodium hydrogen carbonate, as described<br>
in patent publication WO 02/36098.<br>
The preparation that locally binds acetaldehyde in the stomach can be a tablet that forms a gel<br>
in the stomach or a capsule comprising a mixture of powder or granules that forms a gel. In<br>
addition to the acetaldehyde-binding substances, the preparation comprises polymers that<br>
form a gel in the stomach, such as chitosans, alginates, sodium carboxy-methylcellulose<br>
grades, carbomers or aluminium hydroxide. To advance floating in the stomach, the preparation 
also comprise sodium hydrogen carbonate.<br>
The amount of polymers in the preparation is 10-50%, preferably 15-40%, and most<br>
preferably 20-30%.<br>
The amount of sodium hydrogen carbonate can be 10-30%, preferably 20% of the amount<br>
of polymers.<br>
The preparation, which is added to the food composition and which binds acetaldehyde in<br>
the stomach, can be a tablet or granule preparation, wherein the acetaldehyde-binding sub-<br>
stance is mixed with the fillers needed, and granulated thereafter by using enteric polymers<br>
as binders. The binder used can be any known enteric polymer, most preferably a polymer<br>
with a solution pH of 6 to 7, and most preferably the polymer is any of the methacrylate<br>
derivatives, which are known by the trade names Eudragit L and Eudragit S. The amount<br>
of enteric polymer in the preparation is preferably 2 to 5%, most preferably 3 to 4%.<br><br>
WO 2006/103316	PCT/FI2006/000104<br>
18<br>
The preparation that locally binds acetaldehyde in the stomach can be a liquid preparation,<br>
i. e., a mixture comprising, in addition to the acetaldehyde-binding substance, also sodium<br>
alginate, aluminium hydroxide, sodium hydrogen carbonate, and water. The amount of<br>
water in the whole preparation can be 70 to 90%, most preferably about 75 to 85%. The<br>
amount of sodium alginate in the preparation is preferably 2 to 10%, most preferably about<br>
5%, and the amount of aluminium hydroxide is preferably 5 to 15%, most preferably about<br>
10%.<br>
The relative composition of the preparation comprising granules can be as follows, for ex-<br>
ample:<br>
Acetaldehyde-binding substances	60	parts<br>
Chitosan	10 to 40 parts<br>
Calcium hydrogen phosphate	0 to 30	parts<br>
The relative composition of the liquid preparation can be as follows, for example:<br>
Acetaldehyde-binding substances	10	parts<br>
Sodium alginate	2-10	parts<br>
Aluminium hydroxide	5 -15	parts<br>
Sodium hydrogen carbonate	1-2	parts<br>
Water	70 - 80	parts<br>
The dosage unit, which is consumed with the foodstuff and which goes to the intestines,<br>
can preferably be 50 to 500 mg of acetaldehyde-binding substance, preferably 50 to 300<br>
mg, and most preferably 100 to 200 mg.<br>
Other preparations, which are described in patent publication WO 02736098 and which<br>
release compounds that are able to bind acetaldehyde in the stomach in a prolonged way,<br>
or preparations, which release compounds that are able to bind acetaldehyde in the small or<br>
the large intestines, can also be added to the food composition.<br>
It is of advantage to add preparations that release compounds that are able to bind acetal-<br>
dehyde to foodstuffs as compositions or products that are aimed for adding to the food-<br><br>
WO 2006/103316	PCT/FI2006/000104<br>
19<br>
stuffs. In that case the acetaldehyde-binding substances are not released too early, just in<br>
connection of consuming the foodstuff or in the intestine.<br>
Advantages similar to those that are obtained when adding to the foodstuff preparations,<br>
which are not released until in the small or large intestines, are obtained when acetalde-<br>
hyde-binding substances are added to the foodstuff as preparations, which release com-<br>
pounds that bind acetaldehyde in the stomach in a prolonged way.<br>
The above-mentioned preparations, which release compounds that bind acetaldehyde in the<br>
stomach, or which release compounds that bind acetaldehyde in the small/large intestine,<br>
can also be added to the foodstuff simultaneously. In addition, the acetaldehyde-binding<br>
compounds can be added to the foodstuff in a form that binds the acetaldehyde contained<br>
in the product even before consuming the product.<br>
Example 1<br>
In the test, the capability of cysteine to bind acetaldehyde from light alcohol drinks and<br>
milk products, such as yoghurt, was examined.<br>
The amounts of acetaldehyde in four Finnish yoghurts and three beers were measured by<br>
means of a standardized method (Homann et al. 1997. High acetaldehyde levels in saliva<br>
after ethanol consumption: Methodological aspects and pathogenic implications. Carcino-<br>
genesis 18:1739-1743).<br>
The average acetaldehyde concentration (±SEM) in the beers was 146±30 M. L-cysteine<br>
was added to the beers so that the final cysteine concentration of the product was 0 (the<br>
control), 0.1, 3 and 10 mM (i.e., 0 mg/1, 12.1 mg/1, 363 mg/1 and 1210 mg/1); thereafter, the<br>
beers were incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Thereafter, the acetaldehyde contents<br>
were measured by means of a gas chromatograph. The acetaldehyde concentrations after<br>
the treatment were 146±30 M, 133±32 M, 26±9 M and 10±3 M, correspondingly.<br>
In the yoghurt, the acetaldehyde concentrations were 419±53 M, on an average. L-<br>
cysteine was added so that the cysteine concentrations in the final product were 0 (the con-<br>
trol), 0.1, 3 and 10 mM (i.e., 0 mg/1, 12.1 mg/1, 363 mg/1, and 1210 mg/1); thereafter, the<br>
yoghurts were incubated for 5 min at room temperature. The acetaldehyde concentrations<br>
after the treatment were 419±53 M, 240±42 M, 55±15 M, and 15±2 M.<br><br>
WO 2006/103316	PCT/FI2006/000104<br>
20<br>
It was possible to eliminate as much as 3 mM of cysteine (363 mg/1) from over 80% of the<br>
acetaldehyde in the products.<br>
Example 2<br>
10 mM of L-cysteine is added to various products, such as lemon-flavoured mineral water,<br>
milk, sour milk, and yoghurt. As part of the cysteine is consumed in binding the acetalde-<br>
hyde in the product, the amount of cysteine coming into the system in products, which con-<br>
tain acetaldehyde, is about 7 mM, i.e. about 848 mg/1. The amount of cysteine coming into<br>
the system in a product not containing acetaldehyde is about 1210 mg/1.<br>
Example 3<br>
Granules coated with an enteric film are prepared, containing L-cysteine, as described in<br>
patent publication WO 02/36098. The solution pH of the film is about 7.<br>
Enteric granules	L-cysteine	100 mg<br>
calcium hydrogen phosphate	30 to 50 mg<br>
enteric polymer	40 to 60 mg<br>
The granules are added to the yoghurt in an amount such that the amount of L-cysteine is<br>
1000 mg/1 of yoghurt, whereby the amount of L-cysteine obtained from 2 dI of yoghurt<br>
should be 200 mg of L-cysteine, conveyed all the way to the end of the small intestine or<br>
the beginning of the large intestine.<br>
Correspondingly, preparations can be made for the stomach, as described in patent publica-<br>
tion WO 02/36098.<br>
Example 4<br>
The granules releasing cysteine in the small/large intestine, which were prepared in the<br>
previous example, were tested for their functioning in vitro. The granules are mixed in a<br>
suitable device, such as a dissolution device, with yoghurt, the pH of which has been<br>
measured. Samples are taken for a few hours and the acetaldehyde content is defined. After<br>
4 to 6 hours, the pH of the yoghurt is raised to 7 and the sampling is continued to deter-<br>
mine the acetaldehyde content.<br>
The same device can also be used to examine the release of preparations in foodstuffs,<br>
which release cysteine in the stomach in a prolonged way.<br><br>
