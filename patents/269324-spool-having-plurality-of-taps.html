				<td>SPOOL, BRAKE AND ELECTRIC MOTOR<br>
Description:<br>
The present invention relates to a spool, a brake and an ;<br>
electric motor. Bobbins for spools wound with winding wire are<br>
generally known.	:<br>
A brake coil having a center tap (Figure 4, reference numjeirail<br>
6) is known from DE 36 13 294, which is usable as a brake; far<br>
an electric motor. It is a disadvantage, in this case,+ tlhiati<br>
manufacturing it is effortful and costly. It is important!, in<br>
this context, that each additional contact of the winding: !wiire<br>
causes effort and costs during manufacturing.	,<br>
The connecting of wire is known from DE 79 23 585 Ul, the: : ;<br>
winding wire of the spool having to be wound around the pan-<br>
shaped end several times ("wind around" page 4, 3rd paragtf^ph,<br>
lines 4-5) and then soldered on. This requires too much ejfjfqrt<br>
and is costly.	:<br>
A hook on a connecting piece is known from DE 34 07 758 Ail, which is provided to guard against pulling tit] out (E2, pagie 9, line 11) . It is a disadvantage, again, that connecting! :thie winding wire requires much effort and is complicated.<br>
The present invention is therefore based on the object of' further developing a spool so as to make it more cost-effective and simpler to manufacture, especially including contacting. This also relates particularly to spools having a plurality of taps, especially at least one center tap.<br>
According to the present invention, the objective is achieved in the spool according to the features delineated in Claita 1<br><br>
or 2, and in the brake according to the features delineated in Claim 16 and in the electric motor according to the features delineated in Claim 17.<br>
In the present invention, the principal features in the spool are that it includes at least one bobbin and one winding wire, especially a winding wire lacquered [enameled] for electrical insulation,<br>
the bobbin including at least one channel, especially one; developed as a pocket,<br>
at least one sleeve [bush, bushing] being electrically connected to the winding wire,<br>
the sleeve being electrically connected to an electrical lane, especially a stranded conductor of a cable,<br>
the sleeve including deforrnable regions,<br>
for producing the electrical connections, a respectively deformable region being deformable in such a way that a force-locking connection is provided and welding is able to be carried out.<br>
It is of advantage, in this context, that the sleeve makes possible a cost-effective type of electrical connection. In particular, the sleeve itself is able to be produced as a: cost-effective punched bent component made of sheet metali. Since it has deformable regions, using these regions, winding wire sections or stranded conductor sections are able to be clamped, that is, able to be connected by force-locking. Welded joints are then able to be produced by appropriate heating. Using additional deformable regions, other parts: of the cable are also able to be clamped, which makes strain relief implementable for the cable having the stranded conductor.<br><br>
In particular, the sleeve includes at least one first support region which is provided as support and/or guidance for the winding wire,<br>
the sleeve including at least one second region, designed; as a tab, which is deformable for the force-locking connection to the winding wire and is providable for producing a welded joint to the winding wire,<br>
the sleeve including at least one third region, especially a wall part region, which is provided for a welded joint to the stranded conductor of a cable.<br>
The advantage is that the winding wire is easy to thread in and then gets to lie on the support surface, that is, it is able to be accurately positioned. In this way, the threading* is able to be carried out so well by the shaping of the sleeve that the winding wire is introduced into the second region, that is, the region of the deformable tab. The latter is deformable, that is, it is particularly easily pressed against a wall part for clamping, that is, the force-locking connection of the winding wire to the sleeve. But then, the clamped winding wire is able to be quickly and simply welded. The welded joint is well protected against stressing forces, because the force-locking connection continues to be effective, and thus unloads the welded joint.<br>
The fact that the sleeve has an additional region for a welded joint to the stranded conductor of the cable, has the advantage that, at the sleeve itself, a stable region is realized that is suitable for a welded joint, and consequently no further additional parts are required for the welded joint of the stranded conductor of the cable.<br>
In one advantageous embodiment, the sleeve is a metallic punched bent component. In particular, the sleeve is suitably developed for producing an electrical connection between the<br><br>
winding wire and the electrical line or a stranded conductor. This has the advantage that a conductive metal and a metal that is especially suitable for producing a welded joint may be selected, and which is also cost-effective and is able! to be manufactured by a punching and bending process.<br>
In one advantageous embodiment, the sleeve is able to be fastened in the bobbin with force-locking and/or form-locking. In particular, the sleeve includes at least one barb, especially for hooking into the channel. This has the advantage that the fastening is able to be achieved using; simple and cost-effective means.<br>
In one advantageous embodiment, the sleeve includes at least one f_i£st region, especially a region developed as a tab,; , which is provided as a support and/or guidance for the wijading wire. This has the advantage that manufacturing faults can be minimized, since the winding wire is able to be positioned; securely and reproducibly, with great accuracy.<br>
In one advantageous embodiment, the sleeve includes at least one second region, especially a region designed as a tab,: which is deformable for the force-locking connection to the winding wire and is providable for producing a welded joint to the winding wire. This has the advantage that a good electrical connection is providable, using the simplest and most cost-effective means.<br>
In one advantageous embodiment, the sleeve includes at least one third region, especially a region designed as a tab, [which is deformable for the force-locking connection to a stranjded connector, especially of a cable, and is providable for producing a welded joint to the stranded connector. This,: in turn, has the advantage that a good electrical connection la providable, using the simplest and most cost-effective means.<br><br>
In one advantageous embodiment, the sleeve includes at least one fourth region, especially a region designed as a tab, which is deformable for the force-locking connection to a cable, especially to the insulation of the cable, and is , providable for producing a welded joint to the stranded connector. This has the advantage that a strain relief is providable, using the simplest and most cost-effective means.<br>
In one advantageous embodiment, the lacquering of the winding wire is removable when producing a welded joint at least in the vicinity of the electrical contact area, especially because of the heating that occurs during the production of the welded joint. This has the advantage that no special stripping operating step is required, but just the welding is sufficient.<br>
In one advantageous embodiment, the regions are connected1 at a wall part. This has the advantage that the regions are able to be held together in a stable manner, using the wall part.<br>
In one advantageous embodiment, the spool includes a center tap. This has the advantage of one's being able to realize particularly rapidly switchable brakes.<br>
In one advantageous embodiment, the spool includes encapsulating material, especially in the area of the channel and/or the winding. The advantage is that chemical and mechanical protection is achievable. Besides that, the electrical insulating values are also able to be improved!, in response to a suitable choice of the encapsulating material.<br>
In one advantageous embodiment, the bobbin includes a holding device for winding wire and/or cable. This has the advantage that the holding device is able to be produced already at the injection molding production of the bobbin, and thus no , further operation is required.<br><br>
Further advantages are derived from the dependent claims.<br>
Principal features of the present invention, with regard to the brake, are that the brake coil is developed in the manner of the above-named spool.  The advantage is that a cost-effective brake coil is able to be implemented even having a center tap. Three sleeves are required for the center tap, using which, stranded connector at the beginning, in the middle and at the end of the winding of the spool, that is executed using winding wire, is tapped.<br>
The principal features of the present invention, for the electric motor, are that the electric motor includes a brajce having a brake coil or a spool as described above. This has the advantage that the electric motor is able to be manufactured with low effort and costs, and a high degree of automation is able to be achieved in the manufacturing.<br><br>

The present invention will now be explained in detail with, the aid of figures:<br>
Figure 1 shows a bobbin 2. It is advantageously able to be made as a plastic injection-molded part, and has a holding^ device 7 as fastening for an outgoing cable.<br>
Figure 2 shows three sleeves 1, which are able to be introduced into the bobbin at three places on the circumference.<br>
The exact construction of sleeves 1 are shown in Figures 12<br>
and 13.	:<br>
Figure 3 shows a cable 3, including electrically conductive stranded conductor and insulation, which is able to be introduced into the lower part of sleeve 1, before the lateter is inserted into the bobbin.<br>
Figure 4 shows three cables 3, which are connected to corresponding sleeves 1 before the latter are introduced into bobbin I.<br>
Figure 5 shows cable 3 connected to sleeve 1, Figure 12 showing sleeve 1 by itself, without the cable, in an enlarged version. The left bent part 25 is deformed in such a way ithait the insulation of sleeve 1 is fixed, and thus a strain relief is provided for the right part of the cable. Right bent piart 20 is connected to the stranded conductor of cable 3 in an electrically conductive manner, especially in welded form.<br>
Figure 6 shows bobbin 2, sleeves 1 connected to the cableia being introduced.<br>
Figure 7 shows channel 4, into which sleeves 1 are pushed in, in a clearer manner. Channel 4 is developed as a pocket.<br><br>
Figure 8, just as Figure 1, shows the pushed-in sleeves, the cables being guided through the eyelet of holding device 7;.<br>
Figure 9 shows a holding device 6 for fixing a first end pit a winding wire 5, which is guided over the sleeve and lies on tabs 24 of sleeve 1, Figure 12 showing sleeve 1 enlarged by itself without cable.<br>
Figure 10 shows a winding wire 5 guided via sleeve 1.<br>
Figure 11 shows sleeve 1 in the state in which it has been: pushed into the bobbin.<br>
In Figure 12, the sleeve is shown larger than in Figure 13|a. The sleeve is developed as a punched bent component, and has a wall part 23 from which a tab 22 is bent away.<br>
Regions having barbs 21 and additional tabs 24 are situated to<br>
the right and left, and are also bent away. At the lower end<br>
of wall part 23, there are situated a right tab 20 and a left<br>
tab 25, and again they are bent away.	'.<br>
Figure 13b shows what the bending state is of tabs 20,25 when a cable with its insulation is introduced coming from the; left, and the insulation is fixed using left tab 25. This; fixing has the effect of strain relief for the stripped, ;r;ight end part of the cable, that is, the bare stranded conductor. This stranded conductor piece is pressed together using tab 20 and is then electrically welded. This consequently createis a very good conductive connection of the stranded conductor to the sleeve, which bears large mechanical stresses because^ of the strain relief.<br>
Figure 13c shows the bending state of tab 22, which fixes: the winding wire and to which the winding wire is welded.<br><br>
By contrast to Figure 13b, Figure 13d shows the cable introduction from the right, tab 20 being consequently less bent for fixing the cable having insulation, and tab 25 being more strongly bent for fixing the stranded conductor of the stripped end piece of the cable.<br>
Figures 14a and 14b show bobbin 2 in different orientations, channel 4 developed as a pocket being shown, and slot 9 for the introduction of the winding wire also being shown. Thfe winding wire is then wound, and at the end is guided via a corner and sleeve 1 to holding device 6, as is clearly shown in Figure 9.<br>
In additional exemplary embodiments according to the presbnt invention, holding device 6 may also be omitted on the bobbin and instead be provided on the tool.<br>
In further exemplary embodiments according to the present, invention, the channel is encapsulated at the end of the manufacturing process using an encapsulating compound. Consequently, one is able to achieve both mechanical and • chemical protection for the spool winding.<br>
The spool is able to be provided especially advantageously as a brake coil of an electromagnetically operable brake. This brake may advantageously be used in, and integrated into :an electric motor.<br>
A refinement is shown in Figures 15 through 27.<br>
Figure 15 shows refined sleeve 101 having wall part 123. Tabs 124, in this exemplary embodiment, have positioning functions for the winding wire. Winding wire 105 is held between walll part 123 and tabs 124. In this context, it lies upon support surfaces 125 for winding wire. In the process, the winding wire is pressed by tab 122 against wall part 123, and is there able to be welded, so as to produce the electrical connection.<br><br>
This running of the wire is shown exactly in Figures 26 and 27. Wall part areas 120 are provided for connecting to stripped cable 103, including stranded conductor and insulation. The stranded conductor wires are there able to: be welded or soldered to a wall part area 120, as is shown ifi more detail in Figure 18.<br>
Figure 16 shows bobbin 102, into which up to three sleeves: 101 are able to be introduced.<br>
Figure 17 [shows] sleeve 101 before it is pushed into bobbin 102. Figure 18 shows the connection to a cable 103 having insulation, the stripped end regions of cable 103 being welded.<br>
Figure 19 shows sleeve 101 pushed into bobbin 102, and cable 103 laid into a channel. Figure 20 shows an associated different perspective. Figure 21 shows the bobbin having two sleeves 101 pushed in and one sleeve 101 before being pushed in.<br>
Figure 22 shows winding wire 105, which is fastened to a holding device 108, and which runs over support surfaces :125 of the sleeve. Winding wire 105 is laid in, in between, into still open tab 122. Figures 23 and 24 each show another view.<br>
Figure 25 shows bobbin 102 having three sleeves 101 pushed in, tab 122 being pressed closed, that is, against wall part 123. In this way, the winding wire is easily welded. Figure 26 shows an enlarged section of this. Figure 27 shows anotheir . perspective.<br><br>
