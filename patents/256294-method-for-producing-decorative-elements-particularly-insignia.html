Method for producing decorative elements, particularly insignia<br>
The present invention relates to the production of decorative elements, particularly shiny insignia which can be applied to various articles, such as the bodywork of motor cars and motorcycles, domestic appliances, bicycles, boats and the like. Typical examples of these insignia are badges identifying the model, applied to the back of a motor car.<br>
In a known method,' a shiny insignia of this type is produced by a process which has two distinct ■ stages. In the first stage, a core having the desired profile is produced by the<br>
injection moulding of plastics material, for example ABS. In the second stage, this core is immersed in a chromium plating bath so that it is covered with a bright coating layer which imparts a shiny reflective appearance to it.<br>
However, this known method has a numbest of drawbacks. This is because the execution of the injection moulding and chromium plating stages requires skills of markedly different kinds, which are rarely present in a single business. These stages are therefore typically executed in different locations, resulting in complications in terms of logistics and organization. The chromium plating stage also requires the use of chemical products which constitute a health risk, and the handling of these products therefore requires compliance with burdensome safety regulations, and their disposal in an environmentally compatible way is difficult in all circumstances. On the other hand, the stage of injection moulding requires the availability of moulds which can withstand the high pressures required by this kind of technology. These moulds are therefore very costly, making their preparation economically justifiable only in the case of large mass production.<br><br>
One object of the present invention is therefore to overcome the aforementioned drawbacks of the known art.<br>
According to the present invention, this object is achieved by means of a method having the characteristics claimed in Claim 1. Preferred characteristics. of the method are indicated in the claims dependent on Claim 1.<br>
The method according to the invention has a series of stages ■ which can easily be executed in a sequential way in a single installation, without the use of injection moulding and chromium plating methods. It is therefore easily applied, equally suitable for short and long production runs, inexpensive, and has virtually no environmental impact.<br>
A further object of the present invention is a decorative element which can be produced by using the aforementioned method.<br>
This decorative element has the advantageous property of being highly flexible. It can therefore be adapted to curved surfaces at the time of its application, without having to be produced with a corresponding specified curvature in advance. By contrast, the decorative elements of the known art are markedly rigid, and must already have a corresponding curved profile before they are applied to curved surfaces.<br>
Further advantages and characteristics of the invention will be made clear by the following detailed description, provided by way of example and without restrictive intent, with reference to the attached drawings, in which:<br>
Figures i to 12 are schematic illustrations of successive stages of a method for producing decorative elements according to the invention.<br><br>
In a method for producing decorative .elements, particularly insignia, the starting material (Fig. 1) is a multiple-layer film 10 comprising a first transparent protective layer 12, a second decorative layer 14 containing one or more pigments, and a third supporting layer 16 of thermo formable plastics material.<br>
The first transparent protective layer 12 can consist, for example, of polyester, polyvinyl idene fluoride or poly (meth) acrylate. The second layer 14 contains, for example, metallic pigments, while the third layer 16 can consist of a material such as AES or polyurethane. The metallic pigments, preferably of the aluminium and/or magnesium type, of the second layer 14 give the film 10 a brilliant reflective appearance, a satin appearance, or any other known type of metallized appearance. However, it ia also possible to use non-metallic pigments which give the film a coloured or patterned appearance, for example by reproducing a carbon fibre effect. The total thickness of the film 10 can typically be in the range from 200 to 500µm.<br>
A rectangular portion of the multiple-layer film 10 described above is inserted (Pig. 2) into a holder formed by two substantially rectangular frames IB hinged in a book-like way on one longer side 20. The two frames 18 are then closed on to each other (Pig. 3), thus securing the portion of film 10 along its perimeter. The film is then heated {Fig. 4) to a temperature preferably in the range from 150 to 200°C by exposing it to the radiation of a lamp 22, and it is then (Fig. 5) clamped between a die 24 and a matrix 26 having, respectively, projections and recesses of the desired shape, so that it is thermoformed. The thermoforming produces a plurality of recesses 28, whose shape corresponds to that of the insignia to be produced, in the portion of film 10 (Fig. 5) . In Figure 6, the recesses 2 B are shown as having the<br><br>
shape of the letters making up the word "DEMAK". Clearly, the shapes of the recesses could all be identical to each other and/or could be different from the shapes of letters of the alphabet, and there could be virtually any number of recesses, or only one of them, thus enabling a single large insignia to be produced.<br>
In a subsequent stage of the operation (Pig. 7), a hardening resin 30 - typically of the polyurethane type - is poured into the recesses 28, so that it fills them and adheres to the third layer 16. The thermoformed film 10 {Fig. 8) ie strong and substantially self-supporting, and therefore does not require dedicated supporting devices during the pouring stage, in which it acts as a containment vessel for the resin, or afterwards.<br>
A covering sheet 32 is then applied (Fig. 9} to the third layer 16 of the film 10, so as to enclose the resin 30 in the various recesses 28 {see Fig. 10, in which the formed portion of film 10 is shown in an inverted configuration with respect to the preceding figures) . Advantageously, the covering sheet 32 is of the double-sided adhesive type and has a protective liner 34 on the side facing away from the film 10, this liner being removable at the moment of application of the decorative element.<br>
The resin 30 enclosed in the recesses 28 then undergoes a hardening process, which can be accelerated by heating in a kiln. This kiln heating can be carried out, if necessary, even before the application of the covering sheet 32 to the third layer 16 of the film 10.<br>
Finally (Fig. 11) , a cutting device such as a punching machine or a laser beam machine 36 is used to cut the film 10 around the various recesses 28 filled with resin 30 and<br><br>
sealed by the sheet 32, than producing (Pig. 12) insignia 38 of the desired shape. These insignia have a stratified structure comprising a layer of film ID, a layer of poured resin 30, and a covering sheet layer 32, superimposed on each other. In its turn, the layer of film 10 comprising a first transparent protective layer 12, a second decorative layer 14 containing at least one pigment, and a third supporting layer 16 of plastics material to which the poured resin 30 adheres.<br>
Clearly, provided that the principle of the invention is retained, the details of construction and the embodiments can be varied widely from what has been described purely by way of example, without departure from the scope which has been claimed. In particular, the method according to the invention can theoretically be used to produce any number of decorative elements in any shape.<br><br><br>
