				<td>The present invention relates to a herbal antifungal, antimicrobial and antibacterial dermatological drug and the process for manufacturing this herbal antifungal, antimicrobial and antibacterial dermatological drug.<br>
Nature has a bounty of plants and natural agents which show promising anti-microbial activity. Synthetic anti-microbial agents are often active only against a narrow spectrum of bacteria/fungi and in cases where stronger doses are necessciated, the synthetic agents generally express side effects. More over, the phenomenon of development of resistance by microbes is very common. Natural agents are generally safe and since the chemistry of the molecules are very complex compared to their synthetic counterparts; it becomes alt the more difficult for the microbes to develop resistance.<br>
Wound infections are mainly caused by Gram negative bacteria like Psuedomonas aeroginosa (other species of Psuedomonas also) and Gram positive bacteria like Staphylococcus aureus. Fungal species of the genus Microsporum, Trichophyton and Epidermophyton are normally responsible for causing skin diseases.<br>
The present invention serves as a multipurpose dermatological cream which is effective against a broad range of bacteria and fungi, and also possesses ant inflammatory and wound-healing properties. To arrive at this invention, a large number of Indian medicinal plants were screened using "well-bore" technique as well as checked using isobologram. Finally, only those ingredients exhibiting synergistic effect with each other were selected. The novelty of this invention therefore lies not only in its composition, but also in the way its ingredients are processed and blended with each other, so that their synergistic potential is expressed maximally.<br>
Majority of the antimicrobial ointments/creams available in the market are synthetic in origin and contain antibiotic compounds. These compounds generally have specific and narrow spectrum of antimicrobial activity. Moreover, they pose a risk of the microbes developing resistance to them, thus making the formulation ineffective. The present herbal antifungal, antimicrobial and antibacterial dermatological composition contains natural ingredients having a broad spectrum activity against a range of microbes and is therefore preferable. Being natural substances, the chemistry is quite complex and risks of microbes developing resistance to these compounds is negligible.<br><br>
The present herbal drug consists of plant derivatives derived from members of Labiatae, Poaceae and the like.<br>
Ocimwn sanctum is an aromatic herb belonging to the family Labiatae, and is found to occur throughout India. It contains an essential oil which is known to have potent antimicrobial activity and contains a phenyl propanoid compound called eugenol.<br><br>
According to the present invention, a herbal antifungal, antimicrobial and antibacterial dermatological drug comprising the plurality of essential oils minimum two, 2.5% by weight of the total composition, which are mixed and stirred to obtain Mixture A which consists of Cymbopogon citrates{20A5%) and Ocimum sanctum( 40-80%). Mixture B i.e. base material consisting of a plurality of waxes at 12 to 16% by weight of the total composition, melting the said base materials over moist heat to obtain a soft paste, adding a fixed oil to the said soft paste at 8 to 12% by weight of said composition, stirring the said mixture of base and oil continuously and adding to the said mixture, an antioxidant to the tune of 0.02 to 0.07% for weight of the said total composition adding to the said mixture, solubiliser 2 to 5% by weight of the total composition, heating the said mixture to the temperature of 50 to 70 C under a moist atmosphere to obtain a homogenous Mixture B,<br><br>
adding the said Mixture B to the Mixture A and stirring it continuously while cooling the said mixture to 40 to 45°C keeping the stirring constant and adding the solution of preservatives 0.5 - 2.0% and adding water while stirring at 40 to 45°C to make the composition 100% by weight, cooling the said composition to room temperature to obtain homogenous cream.<br>
According to present invention, a process for the preparation of herbal antifungal, antimicrobial and antibacterial dermatological drug comprises of the following steps:<br>
Step 1: Mixture A is made by adding Cymbopogon citrates(20-45%) and Ocimum sanctum(40-80%). This mixture is taken 2.5% w/w of the total composition.<br>
Step 2: The base material consisting of a plurality of waxes, taken in 14.5% w/w of the total composition consists of:<br>

2.	Stearic acid	3.5-5.5% by weight of the composition<br>
3.	Glyceryl monosterate	2-5% by weight of the composition<br>
4.	Ethylene glycol monosterate	0.1- 2.5% by weight of the composition<br>
Step 3: The said base materials are melted over moist heat to obtain a soft paste and added a fixed oil to the said soft paste 10% w/w of said composition, stirring the said mixture of base and fixed oil continuously to obtain homogenous form.<br>
Step 4: An antioxidant to the tune of 0.05% w/w of the said total composition is added to the said mixture obtained in step 3 along with solubiliser 4.0% w/w of the total composition. The said mixture is heated to a temperature of 500C under a moist atmosphere to obtain a homogenous Mixture B.<br>
Step 5: Mixture B is added to Mixture A and stirring is continued while cooling the same to 40 to 450C, keeping the stirring constant.<br>
Step 6: A solution of preservatives 1.55% w/w is added to step 5 along with some amount of water, while stirring at 40 to 450C to make the composition 100% by weight. The said composition is cooled to room temperature, with continuous stirring to obtain homogenous cream.<br><br>
The essential oils to obtain the mixture A arc minimum two, preferably Cymbopogon citrates and Ocimum sanctum, mixed in the ratio of 1:2.<br><br>
Step 2: The base material consisting of a plurality of waxes, taken in 12% w/w of the total composition consists of:<br>
