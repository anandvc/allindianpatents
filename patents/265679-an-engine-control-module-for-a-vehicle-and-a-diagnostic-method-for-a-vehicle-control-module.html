STATE OF HEALTH MONITORING AND RESET METHODS AND SYSTEMS<br>
FOR ON-BOARD DEVICE DRIVER INTEGRATED CIRCUITS<br>
FIELD<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to on-board vehicle diagnostic<br>
systems for device driver integrated circuits.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0003] One or more control modules control various subsystems of a<br>
vehicle. A control module typically includes a primary processor that executes<br>
software or firmware programs stored in memory. A control module may include<br>
one or more device driver integrated circuits that issue control signals to one or<br>
more components of the subsystem based on signals from the primary<br>
processor.<br>
[0004] The primary processor typically monitors system parameters<br>
(e.g. sensor values, system voltage, and response characteristics) for faults.<br>
When a system parameter is out of range or indicates a fault, the control module<br>
typically operates the subsystems in a "limp home mode." For example, vehicle<br>
operation is limited to prevent further damage to the vehicle subsystems and<br>
maintain safety of the driver. The control module makes no attempt to restore full<br>
functionality of the vehicle subsystems until a complete shutdown of the vehicle<br>
is performed and a restart occurs. In some instances, the device driver<br>
1<br><br>
GM. Ref. No. GP-308841-PTE-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000461<br>
integrated circuit corresponding to the faulty parameter just needs to be reset to<br>
restore proper functionality.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0005] Accordingly, an engine control module for a vehicle is provided.<br>
The engine control module includes at least one device driver implemented by<br>
the engine control module. The at least one device driver generates a control<br>
signal to a device of the vehicle and generates a state of health signal based on<br>
an operational status of the device driver. A processor implemented by the<br>
engine control module monitors the state of health signal from the at least one<br>
device driver and generates a running reset command to the at least one device<br>
driver based on a fault status of the state of health signal.<br>
[0006] In other features, a transmission control module for a vehicle is<br>
provided. The transmission control module includes at least one device driver<br>
implemented by the transmission control module. The at least one device driver<br>
generates a control signal to a device of the vehicle and generates a state of<br>
health signal based on an operational status of the device driver. A processor<br>
implemented by the transmission control module monitors the state of health<br>
signal from the at least one device driver and generates a running reset<br>
command to the at least one device driver based on a fault status of the state of<br>
health signal.<br>
[0007] In still other features, a diagnostic method for a vehicle control<br>
module is provided. The diagnostic method includes: monitoring a state of health<br>
2<br><br>
GM. Ref. No. GP-308841-PTE-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000461<br>
signal generated by at least one device driver of the vehicle control module;<br>
determining a faulty status of the at least one device driver based on the state of<br>
health signal; generating a running reset command to the at least one device<br>
driver based on the faulty status of the state of health signal; and maintaining<br>
operation of the vehicle control module while the device driver performs the<br>
running reset.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0016] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses. It should be<br>
understood that throughout the drawings, corresponding reference numerals<br>
indicate like or corresponding parts and features.<br>
[0017] Referring now to Figure 1, a non-limiting example of a vehicle<br>
10 is shown. The vehicle 10 includes an engine 12, a transmission 14, and a<br>
torque converter 16. The engine 12 combusts an air and fuel mixture within<br>
cylinders (not shown) to produce drive torque. Air is drawn into the engine<br>
through a throttle 18. The torque converter 16 transfers and multiplies torque<br>
from the engine 12 to the transmission 14. The transmission 14 includes one or<br>
4<br><br>
GM. Ref. No. GP-308841-PTE-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000461<br>
more gear sets that transfer torque to a driveline (not shown) based on a desired<br>
speed.<br>
[0018] The exemplary vehicle 10 further includes at least one control<br>
module 20a, 20b that controls various subsystems within the vehicle 10. For<br>
example, an engine control module 20a controls the engine 12 and/or the throttle<br>
18 and a transmission control module 20b controls the transmission 14. As<br>
shown in Figure 2, at least one of the control modules 20a, 20b includes a main<br>
processor (shared, dedicated, or group) 22 that executes one or more software<br>
or firmware programs stored in memory 24 and one or more device driver<br>
integrated circuits 26. The one or more device driver integrated circuits 26<br>
include logic for issuing control signals to one or more components of the<br>
subsystem. For example, in the context of the engine control module 20a, the<br>
one or more device driver integrated circuits 26 can be, but are not limited to, a<br>
throttle motor driver, a fuel injector driver, and a fuel pump driver. The processor<br>
22 can be used to monitor a state of health (SOH) signal 27 of each of the device<br>
driver integrated circuits 26. The processor 22 generates a reset signal 28 or<br>
shutdown signal 29 to a device driver integrated circuit 26 when the state of<br>
health signal 27 for that device driver integrated circuit indicates one or more<br>
faults.<br>
[0019] A more detailed example of a state of health monitoring and<br>
reset system is shown in Figure 3. As shown, a main processor (CPU) 22a<br>
electrically communicates with an electronic throttle control (ETC) motor driver<br>
integrated circuit 26a. The ETC motor driver integrated circuit 26a sends the<br>
5<br><br>
GM. Ref. No. GP-308841-PTE-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000461<br>
SOH signal 27 (Figure 2) via a serial data link (SPI) 30 to the CPU 22a. When<br>
the SOH signal 27 (Figure 2) indicates the ETC motor driver integrated circuit<br>
26a is no longer functioning properly (i.e. fault present) or no SOH signal is<br>
received, the CPU 22a resets the ETC motor driver integrated circuit 26a. The<br>
reset is performed while the CPU 22a is still powered and running. In various<br>
embodiments, as shown in Figure 3, the CPU 22a can send the reset signal 28<br>
(Figure 2) to the ETC motor driver integrated circuit 26a via a separate reset line<br>
32 or by sending a reset command over the serial data link 30. The reset line 32<br>
electrically forces a reset while the reset command is processed by the ETC<br>
motor driver integrated circuit 26a before initiating the reset. During such time,<br>
the CPU 22a continues to run any diagnostics related to ETC to detect problems<br>
such as actuation errors.<br>
[0020] Referring now to Figures 4, 5, and 6, the various flowcharts<br>
illustrate exemplary methods as performed by the state of health monitoring and<br>
reset system. The methods may be performed periodically or at scheduled<br>
events during operation of the control module 20a, 20b. As can be appreciated,<br>
the state of health monitoring and reset methods of the present disclosure are<br>
not limited to the sequential execution as shown in Figures 4, 5, and 6.<br>
[0021] Figure 4 is a flowchart illustrating an exemplary state of health<br>
monitoring and reset method that can be performed by the processor 22 of the<br>
state of health monitoring and reset system as shown in Figure 2. The method<br>
may begin at 100. The SOH signal 27 is monitored at 110. If the SOH signal 27<br>
indicates a faulty device driver integrated circuit 26 at 120, the reset signal 28 is<br>
6<br><br>
GM. Ref. No. GP-308841-PTE-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000461<br>
sent to the device driver integrated circuit 26 at 130. Otherwise, if a SOH signal<br>
27 has not been received for X consecutive seconds at 140, the reset signal 28 is<br>
sent over the serial data link 30 (Figure 3) or a running reset is commanded via<br>
the reset line 32 (Figure 3) to the device driver integrated circuit 26 at 130.<br>
Thereafter, the method may end at 150. Otherwise, if the SOH signal 27 is<br>
received and the SOH signal 27 does not indicate a faulty device driver<br>
integrated circuit 26 at 120 and 140, the processor 22 continues to monitor the<br>
SOH signal 27 at 110.<br>
[0022] Figure 5 is a flowchart illustrating an exemplary state of health<br>
monitoring and reset method that can be performed by the device driver<br>
integrated circuit 26 of the state of health monitoring and reset system as shown<br>
in Figures 2. As can be appreciated, this method may be performed when the<br>
reset signal 28 is communicated over the serial data link 30 (Figure 3). The<br>
method may begin at 200. The serial data link 30 is monitored at 210. If a reset<br>
signal 28 is received at 220, the device driver integrated circuit 26 performs a<br>
running reset at 230. Thereafter, the method may end at 240. Otherwise, if the<br>
reset signal 28 is not received at 220, the device driver integrated circuit 26<br>
continues to monitor the serial data link 30 for a reset signal 28 at 210.<br>
[0023] As applied to the example system shown in Figure 3, if the ETC<br>
motor driver integrated circuit 26a was latched up, the reset signal 28 (Figure 2)<br>
may free the latch and allow normal throttle control to resume before the CPU<br>
22a sets a throttle actuation fault. If the actual throttle 18 was hung up on some<br>
debris thereby preventing the blade from moving, this method of resetting the<br>
7<br><br>
GM. Ref. No. GP-308841-PTE-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000461<br>
ETC motor driver integrated circuit 26a would effectively cause the motor control<br>
to send a pulse width modulated signal to the throttle 18. The pulse width<br>
modulated signal would pulse between zero percent and a high number (i.e.<br>
greater than ninety percent), which may generate enough force to free the<br>
throttle 18 from the debris and prevent setting a throttle fault.<br>
[0024] Figure 6 is a flowchart illustrating an exemplary state of health<br>
monitoring and reset method that can be performed by the processor 22, for<br>
example, when monitoring the ETC motor driver integrated circuit 26a of Figure<br>
3. The method may begin at 300. One or more ETC diagnostics are monitored<br>
at 310. If one or more of the ETC diagnostics indicate that one or more ETC<br>
faults have occurred X number of times within a designated time period or Y<br>
number of consecutive times at 320, a shutdown signal 29 (Figure 2) is sent to<br>
the ETC motor driver integrated circuit 26a at 330. Thereafter, the processor 22<br>
allows ETC control to enter a mechanical failsoft mode at 340 and the method<br>
may end at 350. Otherwise, if the ETC diagnostics indicate that ETC faults have<br>
not occurred, the one or more ETC diagnostics are continually monitored at 310.<br>
The method allows the processor 22 to shutdown the integrated circuit without<br>
shutting down the entire control module 20a, 20b when significant faults have<br>
occurred.<br>
[0025] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the foregoing<br>
description that the broad teachings of the present disclosure can be<br>
implemented in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this disclosure has been<br>
