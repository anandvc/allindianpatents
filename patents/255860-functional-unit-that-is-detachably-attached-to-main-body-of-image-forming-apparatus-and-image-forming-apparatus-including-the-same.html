TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a functional unit<br>
that is detachably attached to a body of an image forming<br>
apparatus, and an image forming apparatus including the<br>
unit.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
It is common to detachably attach various functional<br>
units to the main body of image forming apparatuses such as<br>
electronic copying machines, printers, facsimile machines,<br>
and multifunction products. A process cartridges, which is<br>
disclosed in Patent Document 1, having an image carrier, a<br>
developing unit, a cleaning unit, a fixing unit, and an<br>
intermediate transfer unit is an example of the functional<br>
unit. Such functional units are generally set deep inside<br>
the main body of the image forming apparatus. If the<br>
functional unit is not set in its usual position, and if<br>
the image forming operation starts, an abnormal image can<br>
be formed, or, parts in the image forming apparatus can get<br>
damaged.<br>
There is a known configuration in which, at the time<br>
of attaching a face plate to a front plate of the image<br>
forming apparatus main body, the functional unit is pushed<br>
in and positioned at the innermost position within the<br>
image forming apparatus main body by the face plate, and<br>
the functional unit is locked at that position. According<br>
to this configuration, since the functional unit can be<br>
locked at a predetermined attaching position within the<br><br>
image forming apparatus main body, occurrence of the<br>
drawback described above can be prevented. However, when<br>
the functional unit is pushed in by the face plate, large<br>
external force is applied to the face plate from the<br>
functional unit, and the face plate can be largely<br>
elastically deformed. In such case, since the face plate<br>
serves to position respective elements within the image<br>
forming apparatus main body, positions of the elements to<br>
be positioned by the face plate may deviate from<br>
predetermined positions.<br>

BEST MODE(s) OF CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Embodiments of a functional unit and an image forming<br>
apparatus including the functional unit according to the<br>
present invention will be explained in detail with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings. The invention is<br>
not limited by the embodiments.<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic of an internal structure of an<br>
image forming apparatus. The image forming apparatus is a<br>
full color image forming apparatus. The image forming<br>
apparatus includes a main body 7, first to fourth units 1Y,<br>
1C, 1M, and 1BK arranged in the main body 7, and an<br>
intermediate transfer belt 2 arranged to be opposed to the<br>
four units. The intermediate transfer belt 2 is spanned<br>
around a plurality of rollers 3, 4, and 5. The respective<br>
units 1Y to 1BK include image carriers 6Y, 6C, 6M, and 6BK,<br>
each constituted as a drum-shaped photoconductor. Toner<br>
images of different colors are formed on the respective<br>
image carriers. The units 1Y to 1BK are generally called a<br>
"process cartridge" which is a functional unit.<br>
Configurations of the first to the fourth units 1Y to<br>
1BK are substantially the same; moreover, configurations<br>
for transferring toner images formed on the respective<br>
image carriers to the intermediate transfer belt 2 are<br>
substantially the same except for difference in color among<br>
the toner images. Therefore, only the configuration of the<br>
first unit 1Y and the configuration for transferring a<br>
toner image on the image carrier 6Y to the intermediate<br>
transfer belt 2 are explained.<br>
Fig. 2 is an enlarged schematic of the first unit 1Y.<br>
The unit 1Y shown in Fig. 2 includes a charging device 8, a<br>
developing device 9, and a cleaning device 10 arranged<br>
around the image carrier 6Y. Respective cases 11, 12, and<br>
13 for the devices 8, 9, and 10 are integrally assembled by<br><br>
a unit frame (not shown in Fig. 1), and the image carrier<br>
6Y is rotatably supported by the unit frame. The unit 1Y<br>
is thus constituted by integrally assembling the respective<br>
devices 8, 9, and 10 with the image carrier 6Y.<br>
When an image forming operation is started, the image<br>
carrier 6Y is rotationally driven in a clockwise direction<br>
in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, and the intermediate transfer belt 2<br>
is rotationally driven in a direction of arrow A. At this<br>
time, a charge roller 14 rotationally supported by the case<br>
11 of the charging device 8 is rotated in the direction of<br>
arrow while contacting with a surface of the image carrier<br>
6Y, so that the image carrier 6Y is charged to<br>
predetermined polarity due to action of the charge roller<br>
14. An optically modulated laser beam L emitted from an<br>
exposing device 17 shown in Fig. 1 as a device separated<br>
from the unit 1Y is irradiated on the charged image carrier<br>
6Y, so that an electrostatic latent image is formed on the<br>
image carrier 6Y.<br>
The developing device 9 has a developing roller 15<br>
rotatably supported by the case 12, so that dry-type<br>
developer D is carried on the developing roller 15 rotating<br>
in a counterclockwise direction to be conveyed, yellow<br>
toner in the developer is electrostatically moved to an<br>
electrostatic latent image formed on the image carrier 6Y,<br>
and the latent image is visualized as a yellow toner image.<br>
A primary transfer roller 18 is arranged on an<br>
opposite side of the unit 1Y across the intermediate<br>
transfer belt 2, and the toner image formed on the image<br>
carrier 6Y is transferred to the intermediate transfer belt<br>
2 due to action of the primary transfer roller 18. Post-<br>
transfer remaining toner adhering on the image carrier 6Y<br>
after the toner image has been transferred is scraped and<br>
removed from the surface of the image carrier by a cleaning<br><br>
blade 16 supported by the case 13 of the cleaning device 10.<br>
Similarly to the above, a cyan toner image, a magenta<br>
toner image, and a black toner image are formed on the<br>
second to the fourth units 1C, 1M, and 1BK, respectively,<br>
and these toner images are sequentially transferred in a<br>
superimposing manner on the intermediate transfer belt 2<br>
with the transferred yellow toner image transferred thereon.<br>
On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 1, a paper feed<br>
cassette 19 that accommodates recording media P, each being<br>
transfer paper, is disposed at a lower portion inside the<br>
image forming apparatus main body 7. The uppermost<br>
recording medium P is fed out in a direction of arrow B<br>
according to rotation of a paper feed roller 20. The fed<br>
out recording medium P is fed into between the intermediate<br>
transfer belt 2 and a secondary transfer roller 21 arranged<br>
to be opposed to the intermediate transfer belt 2. At this<br>
time, a toner image on the intermediate transfer belt 2 is<br>
transferred on the recording medium P according to action<br>
of the secondary transfer roller 21. The recording medium<br>
P on which the toner image is transferred further conveyed<br>
upwardly to pass through a fixing unit 22 where the toner<br>
image on the recording medium is fixed on the recording<br>
medium according to action of heat and pressure. The<br>
recording medium having passed through the fixing unit 22<br>
is discharged to a paper discharge unit 23 at an upper<br>
portion of the image forming apparatus main body 7. Post-<br>
transfer remaining toner adhering on the intermediate<br>
transfer belt 2 after the toner image has been transferred<br>
is removed by a cleaning unit 24 for the intermediate<br>
transfer belt 2.<br>
Fig. 3 is a schematic partial sectional plan view of<br>
the unit 1Y set at a predetermined attaching position<br>
within the image forming apparatus main body 7. As<br><br>
explained with reference to Fig. 2, the charging device 8,<br>
the developing device 9, and the cleaning device 10<br>
constituting the unit 1Y are assembled integrally by a unit<br>
frame 25 partially shown in Fig. 3, and the image carrier<br>
6Y is rotatably supported by the unit frame 25. A cover 26<br>
is fixed to a front portion of the unit frame 25. In the<br>
image forming apparatus according to the embodiment,<br>
therefore, a casing 27 of the unit 1Y includes the case 11<br>
for the charging device 8, the case 12 for the developing<br>
device 9, the case 13 for the cleaning device 10, the unit<br>
frame 25 for assembling these devices, and the cover 26<br>
fixed to the unit frame 25. The casing of the unit can be<br>
constituted in other appropriate modes.<br>
Reference symbol F in Fig. 3 indicates a front side of<br>
the image forming apparatus, while reference symbol R<br>
indicates an inner side, namely, a rear side of the image<br>
forming apparatus. The unit 1Y is detachably attached to<br>
the image forming apparatus main body 7 in front and rear<br>
directions, as described later. The image forming<br>
apparatus main body 7 has a front plate 2 8 arranged on the<br>
front side, a face plate 30 detachably fixed to the front<br>
plate 28 so as to cover an opening 29 formed in the front<br>
plate 28, and a front door 31 positioned at a side nearer<br>
to the front side than the face plate 30. The imaged<br>
forming apparatus main body 7 also includes an inner plate<br>
32 arranged at the inner side and an exterior cover 33.<br>
The opening 29 can be opened by opening the front door 31<br>
shown in Fig. 3 and detaching the front plate 2 8 from the<br>
face plate 30. When the unit 1Y is pulled to the front<br>
side in this state, the unit 1Y is drawn out to the front<br>
side, as shown with arrow G, while being guided by guide<br>
rails 34 and 35 as shown in Fig. 2. On the contrary, when<br>
the unit 1Y is pushed to the inner side, the unit 1Y is<br><br>
moved to the inner side while being guided by the guide<br>
rails 34 and 35, so that it is pushed into the innermost<br>
position shown in Fig. 3. Thus, the unit 1Y is detachably<br>
attached to the image forming apparatus main body 7 in<br>
front and rear directions shown with arrows G and H. Thus,<br>
the unit 1Y can be easily replaced with a new one, and<br>
maintenance work for the unit 1Y can be performed easily.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, a unit gear 37 is fixed to an end<br>
at the inner side of a shaft 36 fixedly supporting the<br>
image carrier 6Y, and a support shaft 39 of a cup-shaped<br>
gear 3 8 formed with internal teeth is rotatably supported<br>
by an inner plate 32 of the image forming apparatus main<br>
body 7 via a bearing. When the unit 1Y is pushed into the<br>
innermost position within the image forming apparatus main<br>
body toward the inner position direction thereof, as shown<br>
with arrow H in Fig. 3, the unit gear 37 fits with the cup-<br>
shaped gear 38, so that teeth of both the gears 37 and 38<br>
mesh with each other. Thus, the unit 1Y is positioned<br>
regarding the front and rear directions of the image<br>
forming apparatus main body 7. As shown in Fig. 3, in this<br>
state, when the face plate 30 is fixed to the front plate<br>
28, a bearing 41 attached at the front side end of the<br>
shaft 36 is fitted into a positioning hole 40 formed in the<br>
face plate 30. Thus, the unit 1Y is positioned regarding<br>
the upward and downward directions and the front and rear<br>
directions. The image forming operation can be started by<br>
closing the front door 31 in this state, as shown in Fig. 3.<br>
A drive gear 42 is fixed to an inner side end of the<br>
support shaft 39 of the cup-shaped gear 38, and the drive<br>
gear 42 is rotationally driven by a motor (not shown) via<br>
an intermediate gear (not shown) during image forming<br>
operation, so that rotation of the drive gear 42 is<br>
transmitted to the image carrier 6Y via the support shaft<br><br>
39, the cup-shaped gear 38, the unit gear 37, and the shaft<br>
36, and the image carrier 6Y is rotationally driven as<br>
described above.<br>
After the unit 1Y is pushed into the innermost<br>
position within the image forming apparatus main body, when<br>
the unit 1Y is deviated from the innermost position to the<br>
front side, the position of the unit 1Y is out of alignment<br>
so that an abnormal image can be formed or failure may<br>
occur in the image forming apparatus. Therefore, in the<br>
image forming apparatus of the embodiment, the unit 1Y can<br>
be locked at a predetermined attaching position within the<br>
image forming apparatus main body in the following manner.<br>
Fig. 4 to Fig. 7 are schematic views of the front side<br>
portion of the unit 1Y, and Fig. 8 is an exploded<br>
perspective view of the unit 1Y. Fig. 4 depicts the unit<br>
1Y which has been drawn out to the front side, and Fig. 5<br>
to Fig. 7 depict the unit 1Y which has been pushed into the<br>
innermost position within the image forming apparatus main<br>
body. As understood with reference to Fig. 4 to Fig. 8, a<br>
first locking member 43 is provided on the cover 26<br>
constituting the casing 27 of the unit 1Y. The first<br>
locking member 43 is formed of resin, and it includes a<br>
pair of arm portions 44 and 45 and a coupling portion 46<br>
that couples the arm portions 44 and 45 to each other. As<br>
shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8, pins 47 and 48 are projectingly<br>
provided on proximal ends of the respective arm portions 44<br>
and 45, and the respective pins 47 and 48 are pivotally<br>
fitted into mounting holes 49 and 50 formed in the cover 26<br>
of the casing 27. Thus, the proximal ends of the<br>
respective arm portions 44 and 45 are pivotally coupled to<br>
the casing 27 of the unit lY, and the first locking member<br>
43 is supported pivotally by the casing 27 between a<br>
locking position shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 and an<br><br>
member 51 occupies the lowermost position due to its self<br>
weight without engaging with the restricting member 55<br>
shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 8, so that an upper end 58 of the<br>
second locking member 51 is positioned below a pivoting<br>
locus X of the first locking member 43. Accordingly, even<br>
if the first locking member 43 in this state is grasped by<br>
a hand of an operator and is pivoted to the locking<br>
position shown in Fig. 6, the first locking member 43 does<br>
not contact with the second locking member 51, and when the<br>
first locking member 43 set at the locking position is<br>
released from the hand, the first locking member 43 is<br>
pivoted to the unlocking member shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 9<br>
due to action of the biasing unit. When the unit 1Y is<br>
drawn out to the front side and the second locking member<br>
51 and the restricting member 55 are disengaged from each<br>
other in this manner, the first locking member 43 can be<br>
freely pivoted within a predetermined angular range between<br>
the locking position and the unlocking position.<br>
When the unit 1Y shown in Fig. 4 is pushed in the<br>
direction of arrow H, the unit 1Y is moved toward the inner<br>
side of the image forming apparatus main body, and when the<br>
second locking member 51 gets over the top portion 59 of<br>
the restricting member 55 fixed on the front plate 28 of<br>
the image forming apparatus main body 7 and when the unit<br>
1Y is pushed into the innermost position within the image<br>
forming apparatus main body 7 at this time, the second<br>
locking member 51 stops in a state that it is set above the<br>
inclined face 57 of the restricting member 55, as shown in<br>
Fig. 5 and Fig. 10. Thus, the second locking member 51 is<br>
lifted up to a position above the lowermost position<br>
thereof by the inclined face 57 of the restricting member<br>
55 so that the upper end 58 of the second locking member 51<br>
enters inside the pivoting locus X of the first locking<br><br>
member 43. Thus, when the unit 1Y is pushed into the<br>
innermost position within the image forming apparatus main<br>
body 7, the second locking member 51 is pushed in a<br>
direction of approaching to the first locking member 43 by<br>
the restricting member 55 provided on the image forming<br>
apparatus main body. Accordingly, when the first locking<br>
member 43 is pivoted to the locking position shown in Fig.<br>
6 in this state, the first locking member 43 is brought in<br>
pressure contact with the upper end 58 of the second<br>
locking member 51, as shown in Fig. 11, so that the second<br>
locking member 51 is pressed down. Thus, the second<br>
locking member 51 and the inclined face 57 of the<br>
restricting member 55 are brought in pressure-contact with<br>
each other, so that the tongue portion 60 is elastically<br>
deformed downwardly.<br>
As described above, the first locking member 43<br>
frictionally engages with the second locking member 51,<br>
where the first locking member 43 is immovably held at the<br>
locking position, and the unit 1Y is locked to the image<br>
forming apparatus main body due to pressure-contact between<br>
the second locking member 51 and the restricting member 55.<br>
Since the unit 1Y is positioned regarding the upward and<br>
downward directions and the leftward and rightward<br>
directions by fixing the face plate 30 shown in Fig. 3 to<br>
the front plate 30 in this state, the unit 1Y is locked<br>
while it has been set at the predetermined attaching<br>
position. Unless the unit 1Y is pressed into the innermost<br>
position within the image forming apparatus main body at<br>
this time, the unit 1Y can not be locked, so that there is<br>
no possibility that the unit 1Y is locked at a wrong<br>
position. When the unit 1Y is not locked, the first<br>
locking member 43 occupies the unlocking position where it<br>
projects to the front side, so that an operator can<br><br>
immediately know whether the unit 1Y has been locked,<br>
thereby preventing forgetting to lock the unit 1Y. With<br>
this configuration, the unit 1Y can be prevented from<br>
moving to deviate from the predetermined attaching position,<br>
thereby preventing occurrence of an abnormal image or<br>
failure of the image forming apparatus. Since the unit 1Y<br>
is not pressed toward the inner side by the face plate 30,<br>
the face plate 30 is not applied with large external force<br>
from the unit 1Y, so that the face plate 30 is not deformed<br>
largely and positioning precision of the image carrier 6Y<br>
is not lowered.<br>
As described above, in the unit 1Y according to the<br>
embodiment, the first locking member 43 and the second<br>
locking member 51 are arranged to the casing 27 such that,<br>
when the unit 1Y is drawn out to the front side and the<br>
second locking member 51 and the restricting member 55 are<br>
disengaged from each other, the first locking member 43 can<br>
be freely pivoted within the predetermined angular range.<br>
Further, when the first locking member 43 is pivoted to the<br>
locking position where it engages with the second locking<br>
member 51 pressed by the restricting member 55 while it has<br>
been pushed into the innermost position within the image<br>
forming apparatus main body, the first locking member 43<br>
frictionally engages with the second locking member 51,<br>
where the first locking member 43 is held at the locking<br>
position, and the second locking member 51 and the<br>
restricting member 55 are brought in pressure contact with<br>
each other, so that the unit 1Y is locked to the image<br>
forming apparatus main body 7.<br>
When the unit 1Y is drawn out to the front side or it<br>
is pushed into the inner side, the first locking member 43<br>
occupying the unlocking position can be grasped by a hand<br>
of an operator, so that attaching and detaching operations<br><br>
of the unit 1Y can be performed easily. In the unit 1Y of<br>
the embodiment, thus, the first locking member 43 also<br>
serves as a handle grasped by the operator at attaching and<br>
detaching times of the unit 1Y. Thus, an exclusive handle<br>
is not required, so that the configuration of the unit 1Y<br>
can be simplified.<br>
A specific example of the biasing unit that biases the<br>
first locking member 43 toward the unlocking position<br>
except for the locking position will be explained.<br>
Fig. 7 is an explanatory diagram of the respective<br>
pins 47 and 48 projectingly provided on the respective arm<br>
portions 44 and 45 of the first locking member 43,<br>
pivotally fitted into the respective mounting holes 49 and<br>
50 formed in the cover 26. As shown in Fig. 7, projections<br>
61 and 62 are formed on the respective arm portions 44 and<br>
45, and guide portions 63 and 64, on which the projections<br>
61 and 62 of the first lock member 43 slide when the first<br>
locking member 43 is pivoted between the locking position<br>
and the unlocking position, are formed on portions of the<br>
cover 26 positioned adjacent to the respective mounting<br>
holes 49 and 50 (also see Fig. 8). The casing 27 of the<br>
unit 1Y has the guide portions 63 and 64 on which the<br>
respective arm portions 44 and 45 slide when the first<br>
locking member 43 is pivoted between the locking position<br>
and the unlocking position.<br>
Assuming that a distance between portions 63A and 64A<br>
of the guide portions 63 and 64 on which the respective<br>
projections 61 and 62 abut when the first locking member 43<br>
occupies the locking position shown in Fig. 7 is<br>
represented as d1, and a distance between portions 63B and<br>
64B of the guide portions 63 and 64 on which the<br>
projections 61 and 62 abut when the first locking member 43<br>
occupies the unlocking position is represented as d2,<br><br>
setting is made to satisfy dl&gt;d2 and the distances<br>
gradually change. Therefore, when the first locking member<br>
43 is in the locking position, the distances between both<br>
the arm portions 44 and 45 become the maximum, and when the<br>
first locking member 43 occupies the unlocking position,<br>
the distance between both the arm portions 44 and 45<br>
becomes the minimum. When the first locking member 43 is<br>
pivoted from the unlocking position toward the locking<br>
position, the guide portions 63 and 64 guide both the arm<br>
portions 44 and 45 while elastically deforming both the arm<br>
portions 44 and 45 such that the distance between both the<br>
arm portions 44 and 45 gradually expands. As shown in Fig.<br>
10, therefore, when the first locking member 43<br>
frictionally engaging with the second locking member 51 to<br>
occupy the unlocking position is grasped by hand to be<br>
slightly pivoted toward the unlocking position and the<br>
frictional engagement of the first locking member 43 with<br>
the second locking member 51 is cancelled, the first<br>
locking member 43 pivots from the locking position toward<br>
the unlocking position due to its own elasticity while<br>
being deformed such that the distance between both the arm<br>
portions 44 and 45 decreases. The biasing unit that<br>
pivotally biases the first locking member 43 toward the<br>
unlocking position except for the locking position is<br>
configured in this manner. According to such a biasing<br>
unit, the first locking member 43 can be biased toward the<br>
unlocking position without providing a special member.<br>
The guide portions can be constituted by plate springs<br>
abutting on the respective arm portions 44 and 45 instead<br>
of forming the guide portions 63 and 64 by the cover 26<br>
itself.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4 to Fig. 7, respective ends of a<br>
tension coil spring 65 are engaged with the first locking<br><br>
member 43 and the cover 26 so that the first locking member<br>
43 can be biased toward the unlocking position by the<br>
tension coil spring 65. The first locking member 43 can be<br>
pivotally biased toward the unlocking position by a torsion<br>
coil spring instead of using the tension coil spring 65.<br>
Thus, the biasing unit can include a spring for biasing the<br>
first locking member 43 toward the unlocking position.<br>
Although the first unit 1Y has been explained above,<br>
the other units 1C, 1M, and 1BK can also be configured<br>
similarly. The configuration according to the present<br>
invention can also be widely applied to an intermediate<br>
transfer unit and the like including units other than the<br>
unit having the image carrier on which a toner image is<br>
formed, for example, a fixing unit, a developing unit, a<br>
cleaning unit, and an intermediate transfer belt.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>

apparatus where a plurality of imaging units are unitized<br>
for detachably attaching to the apparatus and an<br>
improvement in operability of the respective functional<br>
units and reliability of setting the respective functional<br>
units are reguired.<br><br>
unlocking position shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5. The first<br>
locking member 43 is pivotally biased toward the unlocking<br>
position shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 by a biasing unit<br>
described later.<br>
On the other hand, a mounting portion 52 formed in a<br>
substantial U shape is provided on the cover 26, and a<br>
second locking member 51 is held by the mounting portion 52<br>
movably in a vertical direction. A guide slot 54 extending<br>
vertically is formed in the mounting portion 52, and a<br>
projection 53 provided on the second locking member 51 is<br>
slidably fitted into the guide slot 54. The second locking<br>
member 51 is positioned below the first locking member 43,<br>
and it is held on the casing 27 movably in parallel in<br>
directions of approaching to and separating from the first<br>
locking member 43.<br>
As shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 8, proximal portions 56 of<br>
a restricting member 55 formed of a plate spring made of,<br>
for example, metal is fixed to the front plate 2 8<br>
constituting the image forming apparatus main body 7. As<br>
also shown in Fig. 10 and Fig. 11, the restricting member<br>
55 has a tongue portion 60 including an inclination face 57<br>
inclined obliquely downwardly from a top portion 59 toward<br>
the inner side of the image forming apparatus main body 7.<br>
The restricting member 55 is not shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7.<br>
As described above, Fig. 4 depicts the unit 1Y which<br>
has been drawn out from the innermost position within the<br>
image forming apparatus main body 7 to the front side<br>
position, and Fig. 9 depicts a relative positional<br>
relationship between the first locking member 43 and the<br>
second locking member 51 at that time. In this state, the<br>
first locking member 43 occupies the unlocking position<br>
where it projects toward the front side due to action of<br>
the biasing unit. On the other hand, the second locking<br><br>
