Use of Organic compounds<br>
The invention relates to the use of a Dipeptidyi peptidase IV inhibitor (DPP-IV inhibitor) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases or damages, renal diseases or damages, Heart Failure, or Heart Failure associated diseases, to a method of treating warm-blooded animate including humans suffering from cardiovascular diseases or damages, renal diseases or damages, Heart Failure, or Heart Failure associated diseases, by administering to a said animal in need of such treatment an effective dose of at least one DPP-IV inhibitor or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) upregulation is a well-recognized contributor to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease and is one of the hormonal mechanisms involved in regulation of pressure/volume homeostasis and in expression of hypertension. The renin-angiotensin system furthermore plays a major role in the development of renal damage.<br>
Pursuing research in this field, the applicant has surprisingly discovered that Dipeptidyi peptidase IV inhibitors (DPP-IV inhibitor) attenuate cardiovascular diseases or damages, renal diseases or damages, Heart Failure, or Heart Failure associated diseases. The DPP-IV inhibitors reduce particularly the cardiovascular thickening, the matrix deposition and cardiovascular hypertrophy and hypertrophic remodeling in animals. Secondly, the amelioration of these trophic effects was independent of changes in systemic blood pressure. The advantage of a blood pressure independent effect is that in clinical practice it is difficult to reach recommended targets. It usually requires 2-3 drugs. Also, there is no threshold for blood pressure or cardiovascular and renal diseases or damages, so a blood pressure independent protection would be highly advantageous.<br>
Congestive heart failure (CHF), or heart failure (HF), is a term used to describe any condition m which the heart is unable to adequately pump blood throughout the body and/or unable to prevent blood from "backing up" into the lungs. These conditions cause symptoms such as shortness of breath (dyspnea), fatigue, weakness, and swelling (edema) of the legs and sometimes the abdomen.<br>
Congestive heart failure, regardless of its etiology, is characterized by a weakness of the myocardial tissue of the left and/or right ventricles of the heart and the resulting difficulty in pumping and circulating blood to the systemic and/or pulmonary systems. Myocardial tissue weakness is typically associated with circulatory and neurohumoral changes which result in a failure to deliver sufficient blood and oxygen to peripheral tissues and organs. Some of the<br><br>
resulting changes include higher pulmonary and systemic pressure, lower cardiac output, higher vascular resistance and peripheral and pulmonary edema. Congestive heart failure may be further expressed as shortness of breath either on exertion, at rest or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. If left untreated, congestive heart failure can lead to death.<br>
Heart failure may be described as systolic or diastolic, high-output or low-output, acute or chronic, right-sided or left-sided, and forward or backward. These descriptors are often useful in a clinical setting, particularly early in the patient's course, but late in the course of chronic HF the differences between them often become blurred.<br>
Systolic Versus Diastolic Failure: The distinction between these two forms of HF, relates to whether the principal abnormality is the inability of the ventricle to contract normally and expel sufficient blood (systolic failure) or to relax and/or fill normally (diastolic failure).<br>
High-Output versus Low-Output Heart Failure: It is useful to classify patients with HF into those with a low cardiac output, i.e., low-output HF, and those with an elevated cardiac output, i.e., high-output HF.<br>
Acute versus Chronic Heart Failure: The prototype of acute HF is the sudden development of a large myocardial infarction or rupture of a cardiac valve in a patient who previously was entirely well. Chronic HF is typically observed in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy or multivalvular heart disease that develops or progresses slowly. Acute HF is usually predominantly systolic, and the sudden reduction in cardiac output often results in systemic hypotension without peripheral edema. In contrast, in chronic HF, arterial pressure is ordinarily well maintained until very late in the course, but there is often accumulation of edema.<br>
Right-Sided versus Left-Sided Heart Failure: Many of the clinical manifestations of HF result from the accumulation of excess fluid behind either one or both ventricles. This fluid usually localizes upstream to (behind) the ventricle that is initially affected.<br>
Backward versus Forward Heart Failure: For many years a controversy has revolved around the question of the mechanism of the clinical manifestations resulting from HF. A rigid distinction between backward and forward HF (like a rigid distinction between right and left HF) is artificial, since both mechanisms appear to operate to varying extents in most patients withHF.<br><br>
The treatment of HF may be divided into four components: (1) removal of the precipitating cause, (2) correction of the underlying cause, (3) prevention of deterioration of cardiac function, and (4) control of the congestive HF state.<br>
Conventionally, HF has been treated with a wide variety of drugs, including aipha-adrenergk agonists, beta-adrenergic antagonists, calcium channel antagonists, cardiac glycosides, diuretics, nitrates, phosphodiesterase inhfctors, prazosin, and a variety of vasodilators.<br>
All of these drugs, however, have undesired side-effects. For example, use of alpha-adrenergic agonists results in edema of the periphery tissues. The prolonged use of p-adrenergic agents leads to the progressive development of desensifeation to the drug. Cardiac glycosides produce toxic side- effects in the CNS, and also in the gastrointestinal and respiratory systems. They additionally produce pro-arrhythmic effects. Treatment with diuretics may result in a variety of adverse-effects, such as hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hyperchloremic metabolic alkalosis.<br>
Prolonged use of calcium channel antagonists, such as verapamil, diltiazem and nifedipine, render them ineffective. Moreover, calcium channel antagonists have been shown to increase the mortality rates in patients thus treated, because such compounds act to increase oxygen consumption, which further stresses the compromised heart.<br>
Thus, there is a continued demand for new, non toxic, compounds for treating HF, improving left ventricle function, without increasing the myocardial oxygen requirement. It is also preferred that the drugs do not act directly to stimulate cardiac contractility, or produce side-effects such as changes in blood pressure and/or heart rate, since they are associated with increased mortality in patients with HF.<br>
Pursuing research in this field, the applcant has surprisingly discovered that DPP-IV inhibitors are useful for the prevention, delay erf progression or the treatment of heart failure (HF) or heart failure associated diseases.<br>
The present invention thus concerns the use of a Dipeptkiyl peptidase IV inhibitor (DPP-IV inhibitor) or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for the manufacture of a medicament for treating cardiovascular diseases or damages, renal diseases or damages, Heart Failure, or Heart Failure associated diseases.<br>
The term "DPP-IV inhibitor" is intended to indicate a molecule that exhibits inhibition of the enzymatic activity of DPP-IV and functionally related enzymes, such as from 1-100% inhibition, and specially preserves the action of substrate molecules, including but not limited<br><br>
to glucagon-like peptide-1, gastric inhibitory polypeptide, peptide histidine methionine, substance P, neuropeptide Y, and other molecules typically containing alanine or proline residues in the second aminoterminal position. Treatment with DPP-IV inhibitors prolongs the duration of action of peptide substrates and increases levels of their intact, undegraded forms leading to a spectrum of biological activities relevant to the disclosed invention.<br>
DPP-IV can be used in the control of glucose metabolism because its substrates include the insulinotropic hormones Glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and Gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP). GLP-1 and GIP are active only in their intact forms; removal of their two N-terminal amino adds inactivates them. In vivo administration of synthetic inhibitors of DPP-IV prevents N- terminal degradation of GLP-1 and GIP, resulting in higher plasma concentrations of these hormones, increased insulin secretion and, therefore, improved glucose tolerance. For that purpose, chemical compounds are tested for their ability to inhibit the enzyme activity of purified CD26/DPP-IV. Briefly, the activity of CD26/DPP-IV is measured in vitro by its ability to cleave the synthetic substrate Gly-Pro-p-nitroanilide (Gly-Pro-pNA). Cleavage of Gly-Pro-pNA by DPP-IV liberates the product p-nitroanilide (pNA), whose rate of appearance is directly proportional to the enzyme activity. Inhibition of the enzyme activity by specific enzyme inhibitors slows down the generation of pNA. Stronger interaction between an inhibitor and the enzyme results in a slower rate of generation of pNA. Thus, the degree of inhibition of the rate of accumulation of pNA is a direct measure of the strength of enzyme inhibition. The accumulation of pNA is measured with a spectrophotometer. The inhibition constant, Ki, for each compound is determined by incubating fixed amounts of enzyme with several different concentrations of inhibitor and substrate.<br>
In the present context "a DPP-IV inhibitor" is also intended to comprise active metabolites and prodrugs thereof, such as active metabolites and prodrugs of DPP-IV inhibitors. A "metabolite" is an active derivative of a DPP-IV inhibitor produced when the DPP-IV inhibitor is metabolised. A "prodrug" is a compound that is either metabolised to a DPP-IV inhibitor or is metabolised to the same metabolite(s) as a DPP-IV inhibitor.<br>

Any of the substances disclosed in the above mentioned patent documents, hereby included by reference, are considered potentially useful as DPP-IV inhibitors to be used in carrying out the present invention.<br><br>
DPP-IV inhibitor to be used alone according to the present invention can be used in association with a carrier.<br>
A carrier in the instant context is a tool (natural, synthetic, pepfidic, non-peptidic) for example a protein which transports specific substances through the cell membrane in which it is embedded and into the cell. Different carriers (natural, synthetic, peptidic, non-peptidic) are required to transport different substances, as each one is designed to recognize only one substance, or group of similar substances.<br>
Any means of detection known by the person skilled in the art can be used to detect the association of the DPP-IV with a carrier, for example, by labelling the carrier.<br>
The DPP-IV inhibitor can be a peptidic or, preferably, non-peptidic one.<br>
Most preferred are orally active DPP-IV inhibitors and pharmaceutical salts thereof.<br>
The active ingredients or pharmaceutical acceptable salts thereof according to the present invention may also be used in form of a solvate, such as a hydrate or including other solvents, used for crystallization.<br>
It has now been surprisingly found that DPP-IV inhibitors are useful for the prevention, delay of progression or the treatment of cardiovascular diseases or damages, renal diseases or damages, Heart Failure, or Heart Failure associated diseases.<br>
The present invention thus concerns the use of a DPP-IV inhfctor or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for the manufacture of a mecficament for the prevention, delay of progression or the treatment of cardiovascular diseases or damages, renal diseases or damages, Heart Failure, or Heart Failure associated diseases.<br>
In particular, the present invention relates to a new use of (S)-H{3-hydroxy-1-adamantyI) amino] acetyl-2-cyano-pyrrolidine (LAF237) of formula (T)<br><br>

Furthermore it has surprisingly been discovered that the compounds disclosed herein do not have the disadvantages of the currently used compounds. It has been found that the compounds of the invention exert their beneficial effect as a consequence of having partial fatty acid oxidation (pFox) inhibiting properties and glucose oxidation activating properties, and that they are valuable for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases or damages, renal diseases or damages, Heart Failure, or Heart Failure associated diseases.<br>
In particular, the compounds of the invention switch substrate use in the heart from fatty acids to glucose/lactates, thus improving left ventricte function, while not producing adverse side-effects such as changes in blood pressue and/or heart rate, and do not act directly to stimulate cardiac contractility, all of which would be expected from a calcium entry blocker.<br>
It has also been surprisingly found that DPP-IV inhibitors are particularly able to slow or halt progression of myocardial remodeling, to improve endothelial function, to improve endothelial-dependent vasodilator function, to reduce progression of atherosclerosis, to markedly improve endothelial-dependent vasodiator function to acetylcholine, improvement in vasodilatory capacity, known to be severely impaired in CHF patients, decrease levels of apoptosis and necrosis.<br>
It has been surprisingly found that DPP-IV inhfcctors improve left ventricle function, without increasing the myocardial oxygen requirement Furthermore DPP-IV inhibitors do not act directly to stimulate cardiac contractility, or produce side-effects such as changes in blood pressure and/or heart rate, since they are associated with increased mortality in patients with HF.<br><br>
It has also been surprisingly found that DPP-IV inhibitors are particularly safe (non toxic) and useful for long-term administration e.g. less side effects, good absorbability into the body upon oral administration and long-lasting action.<br>
The method or use of the present invention comprises the long-term administration to a patient of a daily dose of DPP-IV inhibitor effective to treat HF.<br>

The term "heart failure associated diseases* as used herein, means treating any one or more of the conditions underlying HF, including, without limitation, decreased cardiac contractility, decreased ventricular pressure such as left ventricular systolic pressure, abnormal diastole compliance, reduced stroke volume, infection of the heart valves and/or muscte itsetf (endocarditis and/or myocarditis) and decreased cardiac output, while minimizing or attenuating deleterious effects commonly associated with the long-term administration of other prior art compounds, such as oxygen-wasting effects, arrhythmias, and exacerbation of angina pectoris. As further used herein, "oxygen-wasting effects" include, without limitation, symptoms and signs of congestion due to increased ventricular filling pressures, and fatigue associated with low cardiac output. As used herein, long-term administration' means administration for at least three weeks.<br><br>
The term "cardiovascular diseases or damages  as used herein means a cardiac and/or vascular disease or a cardiac and/or vascular damage.<br>
The term 'endothelial dysfunction with pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidant states" as used herein means but is not restricted to chronic damage to the endothelium where Ang II is deeply involved.<br>
The term hypertension induced cardiovascular diseases or damages, renal diseases or damages, Heart FaOum, or Heart Failure associated diseases" as used herein means cardiovascular diseases or damages, renal diseases or damages, Heart Failure, or Heart Failure associated diseases in animals or humans suffering from hypertension. Hypertension induced cardiovascular diseases or damages, renal diseases or damages, Heart Failure, or Heart FaDure associated diseases are preferably vascular damages to the ocular, renal, cardiac, general circulation and cerebral systems.<br>
The term "diabetes induced cardiovascular diseases or damages, renal diseases or damages, Heart Failure, or Heart Failure associated diseases* as used herein means cardiovascular or renal diseases or damages in animals or humans suffering from diabetes e.g. type 2 diabetes, such as especially artherosclerosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, stroke prevention in congestive heart failure, heart failure, left ventricular hypertrophy or vascular damages to the ocular, renal, cardiac, general circulation and cerebral systems such as preferably artherosclerosis.<br>
Cardiac, vascular or kidney hypertrophy or hypertrophic remodeling is characterized by an increase in mass of the heart, arteries, large vessels or kidney.<br>
Hypertension induced cardiovascular diseases or damages, renal diseases or damages, Heart Falure, or Heart FaDure associated diseases. Hypertension, a condition of elevated blood pressure, affects a substantial number of the human population. Consequences of persistent hypertension indude vascular damage to the ocular, renal, cardiac and cerebral systems, and the risk of these complications increases as blood pressure increases. Injuries in relation to hypertension, according to the invention are preferably but not limited to cardiac hypertrophy such as right or left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in hypertensive patients, renal arteriopathy, and vascular diseases.<br>
Endothelial dysfunction, is an early stage disease characterized by impaired vasomotton/tone, pruthrombotic state, pro-Inflammatory state and/or proliferation in arterial walls. The development of endothelial dysfunction is also speculated to be one of the several<br><br>
factors which might contribute to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular diseases.<br>
Cardiac hypertrophy or cardiac myocyte hypertrophy is an adaptive process of the heart to reduce wall stress when an increased pressure load is imposed on the myocardium. Activation of the renin-angiotensin system has been postulated to play a major role in the pathophysiology of cardiac hypertrophy and failure. In vivo studies have demonstrated that angiotensin II increases left ventricular mass and contributes to cardiac phenotype modulation independently from its effect on arterial pressure. By in vitro studies, it has been shown that angiotensin II causes cardiac myocyte hypertrophy and modulates interstitial fibrosis.<br>
Adverse cardiac remodeling after myocardial infarction: The loss of contractile tissue by myocardial infarction (Ml) is in part compensated for by hypertrophy of the remaining surviving myocardium. Larger transmural infarcts tend to expand and the whole ventricle reacts by dilatation. Adaptation to increased load of residual myocardium includes strengthening of the myocardium by increased collagen deposition. The whole process is termed remodeling of the heart (cardiac remodelling) and appears to be controlled by mechanical and humoral factors. Importantly, remodeling includes gross morphologic, histologic, cellular, and molecular changes of the infarct and scar as well as of residual myocardium. Progressive dilatation is accompanied by progressive left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and electrical instability of the heart Patients after acute Ml are at risk of recurrent ischemia, arrhythmias, and remodeling even if they are asymptomatic. In the assessment of post-MI patients, it is important to identify the patient at risk of remodeling and to apply secondary preventive therapy that includes interruption or delay of the remodeling process.<br>
Pulmonary congestion and cardiac fibrosis in dilated or in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), the most common cause of sudden cardiac death in tiie young, is characterized by cardiac hypertrophy, myocyte disarray, and interstitial fibrosis.<br>
Stroke prevention in congestive heart failure.<br>
Atherosclerosis is a systemic disease of the vessel wall that occurs in the carotid arteries, aorta, coronary arteries and other peripheral arteries. The main components of the atherosclerotic plaques are (1) connective tissue extracellular matrix, including collagen, proteoglycans and fibronectin elastic fibers; (2) cells such as monocyte-derived macrophages, T-lymphocytes, and smooth-muscle cells; and (3) crystalline cholesterol,<br><br>
cholesteryl esters, and phospholipids. During the progression of the aterosclerotic processes, substantial vascular remodeling occurs, resulting in enlargement of the vessel and, subsequently, in concentric or eccentric stenotic lesions.<br>
Among the imaging techniques to assess atherosclerotic plaques in humans, high-resolution magnetic resonance (MR) has emerged as the leading in vivo modality for plaque characterization.<br>
The pathogenesis of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) or hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) involves mechanical, hormonal, and neural factors. The left ventricle increases its mass and wall thickness to oppose a rise in the pressure load. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a major cardiovascular risk factor for morbidity and mortality e.g. Myocardial hypertrophy, heart failure, heart failure related to hypertension, and other cardiovascular complications independent of blood pressure (BP). The individual prognosis of LVH can be determined by echocardiography.<br>
Nephrosclerosis or hypertensive nephrosclerosis is characterized by interstitial accumulation of the extracellular matrix components collagen types I, III, IV, V, and VI and fibronectin (remodeling). These matrix changes were accompanied by a progressive infiltration of mononuclear cells in the cortical interstitium, suggesting that the macrophages and T lymphocytes contribute to the development of fibrogenesis.<br>
Renal arteriopathy as a consequence of hypertension. This disease leads to thickening of the arterial wall characterized by elastic disorganisation, hypertrophied smooth muscle cells and collagen bundles.<br>
Proteinuria in chronic renal disease. Intraglomerular hypertension promotes proteinuria, which further activates the renin-angiotensin system (RAS).<br>
Renal Hyperfiltration such as after portal renal ablation. Partial ablation of renal mass initiates a cycle of progressive glomerular injury in the remnant. This process is associated with glomerular hypertrophy, hyperfiltration and systemic hypertension.<br>
Diabetic nephropathy is characterized by a persistent albuminuria {&gt; 300 mg/ 24 h or 200 (ig/min), which disease can be diagnosed clinically if the following additional criteria are fulfilled: presence of diabetic retinopathy and no clinical or laboratory evidence of kidney or urinary tract disease other than diabetic glomerulosclerosis. Diabetic nephropathy is the commonest cause of endstage renal failure in the Western World.<br><br>
Diabetic retinopathy (DR) and diabetic macular edema (DME) are common vascular complications in patients with diabetes and may have a sudden and debilitating impact on visual acuity (VA), eventually leading to blindness. Advanced stages of DR are characterized by the growth of abnormal retinal blood vessels secondary to ischemia. These blood vessels grow in an attemptto supply oxygenated blood to the hypoxic retina. At any time during the progression of DR, patients with diabetes can also develop DME, which involves retinal thickening in the macular area. DME occurs after breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier because of leakage of dilated hyperpermeable capillaries arc! microaneurysms.<br>
Diabetic neuropathy is the least understood diabetes vascular compficafcn which results in morphological and metabolic changes in peripheral nerves.<br>

Experimental protocols, which are by no way limitative, to prove pharmacological activity of the compounds and composition according to the invention in heart failure and heart failure   -*. associated diseases, are described below (see also former pages);<br>
&gt;	For the evaluation that the DPP-IV inhibitors according to the present invention may be used for the treatment of heart failure, for example, the methods as disclosed by Smith HJ, Nuttall A: Experimental models of heart failure. Cardiovasc Res 1985,19, 181-186 may be applied. Molecular approaches such as transgenic methods are also described, for example by Luff et al.: Hypertension-induced end-organ damage. "A new transgemic approach for an old problem." Hypertension 1999, 33,212-218. Also, rat models of hypertension and cardiac failure as described by Doggrel SA and Brown L (Cardiovasc Res 1998, 39: 89-105) may be used for the pharmacological evaluation of the DPP-IV inhibitors. The evaluation of the cardiovascular benefic effects especially in diabetes of the agents given alone or in combination can be performed using models such as the Zucker fatty rat as described in the publication of Nawano et al., Metabolism 48:1248-1255,1999.<br>
&gt;	Additional experimental protocols are described in the patents US 6,087,360 (using farm pigs as heart failure model) and US 20030045469.<br><br>
58:2437-2451, 2000). Animals are then further randomized to receive either no treatment or DPP-IV inhibitors at a dose of 60 mg/kg by daily gavage and sacrificed 12 days later. Rats have unrestricted access to water and standard rat chow. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) is measured by indirect tail-cuff plethysmography in prewarmed unanesthetized animals as previously described (Bunag RD; Journal of Applied Physiology 34:279-282,1973). In each group of 16 animals, 8 are used for histological studies and eight are used for gene expression analyses. In the latter group, animals are sacrfficed by decapitation after which the mesenteric vessels are removed and stripped of surrounding fat, connective tissue and veins to yield the superior mesenteric arterial tree as previously described (Rumble J et al.; J Hypertension 14:601-607,1996). The vessels are weighed, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and subsequently stored at -80°C.<br>
Histochemistry and immunohistochemistry: Histological studies of vascular architecture are performed in a subset of animals (n = 8/group). Animals in this subgroup are anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (Nembutal, Bomac Laboratories, Asquith, Australia) and vessels are perfused at arterial pressure with 10% neutral buffered formalin via an intra-aortic cannula. Tissues are then prepared as previously described (Cooper ME et col.; Diabetes 43:1221-1228,1994). In brief, mesenteric vessels are placed in ice cold phosphate buffer where fat, connective tissue and veins are removed by blunt dissection. The resultant vessel preparation are then embedded in paraffin. Sections are then either histochemically or immunohistochemically stained. Histochemical staining comprised the use of either haematoxlyin and eosin or Masson's trichrome (Masson P; J Tech Methods 2:75-90,1929) to examine extracellular matrix. Smooth muscle is immunostained using a polyclonal a-smooth muscle actin antibody (Biogenes, San Ramon, CA) and immunohistochemistry is performed using the indirect avidin-biotin complex method as previously described (Rumble JR et caL; J Clin Invest 99:1016-1027,1997).<br>
Quantification of histopathology: The proportion of vessel wall occupied by the media is identified by immunolabelling for a-smooth muscle actinand the ratio of the wall:lumen quantified using of a video-imaging system (Video Pro 32, Leading Edge, Bedford Park, South Australia, Australia), connected to a light microscope (Zeiss, Oberkocken, Germany) with photographic attachment (Axiophot, Zeiss, Oberkocken, Germany). Using this device, the media (areas stained with the anti-actin antibody) and corresponding lumenal areas are determined in a median of 20 (range 10-35) vessels per animal and expressed as walhlumen ratio, as previously described in other models of vascular hypertrophy (Kakinuma Yet col.; Kidney Int 42:46-55., 1992).<br><br>
&gt;	A useful Heart Failure clinical trial is described by Stephan Schmidfr-Schweda and Christian Holubarsch (First clinical trial with etomoxir in patients with chronic congestive heart failure; Clinical Science (2000) 99, 27-35).<br>
&gt;	Other clinical trials are described by Jay N. Cohn, M.D. and Gianni Tognoni, MX). (Volume 345:1667-1675, December 6, 2001 - Number 23 A Randomized Trial of the Angiotensin-Receptor Blocker Valsartan in Chronic Heart Failure) and the patent US 5,998,458 (example 1).<br>

Preferred DPP-IV inhibitors for the uses and methods of the present invention are H2-[(5-cyanopyridin-2-yl) amino] ethylamino} acetyl-2 (S)- cyano-pyrrolidine dihydrochloride (DPP728), especially the dihydrochloride thereof, (S)-H(3-hydroxy-1-adamantyI)amino]acetyl-2-cyano-pyrrolidine (LAF237), and L-threo-isoleucyi thiazofidine (compound code according to Probiodrug: P32/98 as described above), MK-0431, GSK23A, BMS-477118, 3-(aminome%l)-2-isobuthyl-1-oxo-4-phenyi-1,2-dihydro-6-isoquinolinecarboxamide and 2-3-aminorr-thyl)-2-isobuthyl-phenyl-1--dihydro-6-isoquinolyl]oxy}acetamide and optionally in any case pharmaceutical salts thereof.<br>
EXPERIMENTAL PART<br>
The following examples can be carried out with DPP-IV inhibitors to show their claimed<br>
activity.<br>
Example 1:<br>
Animals: Forty-eight, 8 week old, male Sprague Dawley rats are anaesthetized with<br>
enflurane (Abbott Australasia, Kumal, NSW, Australia) and a osmotic nrinipump (Alzet Model<br>
2002, Alzet Corporation, Palo Alto) inserted in the interscapular region. Rats are<br>
randomized to receive minipumps filled vehicle (0.15 M NaCI, 1 mmol/l acetic acid) either<br>
with or without angiotensin II (58 ng/min), as previously described (Cao Z et col. Kidney Int<br><br>
Quantification of ECM is performed on trichrome-stained sections by calculating the proportion of area occupied by ECM using computer-assisted image analysis as previously described (Lehr HA, et coL JHistochem Cytochem 45:1559-1565,1997). In brief, the color ranges for matrix {blue on trichrome stained sections), media smooth muscle (red on trichrome stained sections) are selected and image analysis is performed using a chromogeivseparating technique (Lehr HA, et col.). The entire section is examined by light microscopy (Olympus BX-5Q, Olympus Optical, Tokyo, Japan) and digitized using a high resolution camera (Fujix HC-2Q0Q, Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). All images are obtained using a 20X objective lens. DjgiSzed images are then captured on a Power Macintosh G3 computer (Apple Computer inc., Cuper&amp;K&gt;, CA) equipped with an in-built graphic board and evaluated using analytical software (Analytical Imaging Software, Ontario).<br>
Statistics: All data are shewn as mean ± SE unless otherwise specified. Data are analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) using the StatView IV program (Brainpower, Calabasas, CA) on a Macintosh G3. Comparisons between group means are performed by Fisher's least significant difference method. A p value of less than 0.05 is considered statistically significant Results:<br>
Animal Data: Angiotensin II infusion is associated with increased systolic blood pressure (SBP) compared with vehicle treated animals (141 ±2 mmHg versus 202 ± 7 mmHg, vehicle versus angiotensin U, p 
Histology and immunohistocheirostry: Histomorphometric analysis reveal a significant increase in the metfa walfclumen ratio in angiotensin ll-infused rats (Vehicle -&gt; 0.39; angiotensin ll-infused rats -&gt; 0.52 , p 
 <br>
Example 2: Nephropathy: Antiproteinuric action in rats with non-insulin-dependent (NIDD) diabetes (Wistar fatty rats) [protocol described by H. Ikeda et al„ Diabetes 30,1045 (1981) or by focal glomerulosclerosis model; T.W. Meyer and H.G. Renake, Am. J. Physiol. 254, F856 (1988) or in WO 01/64200]<br>
This unforeseeable range of properties means that DPP-IV inhibitors is of particular interest for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of the herein described diseases especially hypertrophy or hypertrophic remodeling in the cardiovascular system and or in the kidney, and the associated diseases described herein.<br>
This effect can especially be clinically relevant for patients with injuries in relation to hypertension such as described herein.<br>
Experiment 3: Effect on Cardiac Hypertrophy<br>
Materials and Methods: Animal-housed male Wistar rats weighing 100-120 g are used: 5 per cage (cage size: 425 mm*266 mm* 180 mm with a sawdust litter) at a temperature of 21±10° C. and 50±15% humidity with a 12/12 h light/darkness cycle and with 15-20 air changes/hour. The animals are fed with LP ALTROMIN (REIPER) feed and spring water ad<br>
libitum.<br>
Induction of Cardiac Hypertrophy: Left ventricular hypertrophy is induced in rats anaesthetised with Nembutal sodium, by means of constriction of the abdominal aorta with a clip (00.8 mm) placed in the abdominal aorta between the diaphragm and the renal branches; one group of animals, which is then used as a control group, underwent the same operation but is not submitted to constriction of the aorta (shams).<br>
The animals are thus randomly assigned to the following groups:<br>
Shams: operated on without aortic constriction (n=8)<br>
Controls: operated on with aortic constriction (n=8)<br>
CLO: operated on with aortic constriction and to be treated for 12 weeks, from the day after the operation with DPP-IV inhibitors in the feed (60-100 mg/kg/day (n=11).<br>
Evaluation of Cardiac Function: At the end of treatment, cardiac function is evaluated, in the animals anaesthetised with Nembutal sodium, by means of a polyethylene catheter inserted in the left ventricle via the carotid and connected up to a pressure transducer (Statham p23 XL) and to an amplifier (Biomedica Mangoni bm 61).<br><br>
The parameters to be recorded are: heart rate, ventricular systolic and end- diastolic pressure, and the positive and negative derivatives of ventricular pressure, which are recorded on a personal computer by means of a special data acquisition system (IDAS). The measurements are taken for a period of 30 minutes.<br>
Macroscopic Assessment At the end of the experiments the animals are sacrificed by means of a lethal dose of Nembutal, the abdominal cavity was opened, the organs are exteriorised in order to verify correct positioning of the aortic clip, and the heart, lungs and liver are then removed and carefully dried and weighed after macroscopic observation of any abnormalities.<br>
Statistical Analysis: The data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation and are compared using Student's t-test for independent data. Differences with P
Results<br>
Weight Parameters: The weight parameters measure at the end of the experiment is evaluated; the body weight of the animals does not change significantly either as a result of constriction of the aorta or as a result of the treatments. Aortic constriction induces a significant ventricular hypertrophy; in fact, the heart weight of the animals with the clip increases by approximately 35% as compared to the shams (P
Cardiac Function : Aortic constriction induces a significant increase both in left ventricular systolic pressure and in end-diastolic pressure; the pressure developed, and the positive and negative derivatives of ventricular pressure show no statistically significant changes in absolute values in the animals with aortic constriction as compared to the shams.<br>
If the pressure developed is normalised for ventricular weight, a statistically significant reduction in this parameter can be observed in the animals with aortic constriction; similarly, the positive derivative of ventricular pressure can significantly be reduced if it is normalised for ventricular systolic pressure .<br>
Treatment of the animals with aortic constriction normalises end-diastolic pressure, and the pressure developed in relation to ventricular weight, with a significant improvement in both the positive and negative derivatives of ventricular pressure.<br><br>
Treatment with DPP-IV inhibitors can induce e.g. a further increase in left ventricular systolic pressure and normalise end-diastolic pressure in the animals with aortic constriction.<br>
The pressure developed in relation to ventricular weight, and both the positive and negative derivatives of ventricular pressure can significantly be improved by treatment with DPP-IV inhibitors.<br>
Experiment 4. Effect on endothelial function (Heart Failure)<br>
This example describes a study to be conducted to determine the effect of the treatment of the invention on endothelial function in Watanabe rabbits, known to develop complex atherosclerotic lesions during the first year of life. As previously mentioned, endothelial dysfunction is linked to the pathophysiology of HF.<br>
The rabbits enter the study at 7 to 8 months of age, and are randomized into three groups, a first group to be sacrificed immediately for baseline measurements, a second group (n=10) which receives a DPP-IV inhibitor, and a third group (n=10) which receives sham treatments comprising placebo (control animals).<br>
The treatment comprise a daily administration of DPP-IV inhibitor over a period of 10 weeks.<br>
All animals are sacrificed at 11 months of age. Ring preparations are taken from the iliac arteries of the animals and are evaluated for the amount of relaxation induced by acetylcholine (an endothelial-dependent vasodilator) after being treated with phenylephrine (a vasoconstrictor).<br>
Evaluation of the ring preparations e.g. show a significant increase in endotheliaknediated vasorelaxation in the treated animals as compared to the control animals.<br>
No relaxation is observed when the endothelium is removed from the ring preparations, further confirming the endothelium-specific effect of the treatment of the invention. DPP-IV inhibitors are able to restore the attenuated endothelium-dependent relaxation<br>
