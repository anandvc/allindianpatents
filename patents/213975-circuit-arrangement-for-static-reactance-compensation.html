				<td>CIRCUIT ARRANGEMENT FOR STATIC REACTANCE COMPENSATION<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The invention lies in general in the area of static generation of electrical power, in par-<br>
ticular in the area of the static reactive-power compensation systems. At present the static re-<br>
active-power systems (STATIC VAR SYSTEMS) are divided in two broad categories:<br>
(1) Static reactive-power systems, which are based on the generation of reactive-power<br>
by inductors or capacitors;<br>
(2) Static compensation systems (Statcoms), which rely on that matter, that by means<br>
of a sinusoidal voltage source, which voltage is different to the energy system and which is<br>
generated by means of power electronic circuits, a reactive-power is taken out of the energy<br>
system or reactive-power is supplied to this energy system by controlling the magnitude of the<br>
voltage which is generated by this separate voltage source. At present the second type of static<br>
reactive-power compensators is essential more expensive than the first type (DE-Z "ABB<br>
Technik", 5/99, page 4-17).<br>
The present invention relates more to the first category. There are three types in this<br>
category at the moment:<br>
(1) inductors which are switched by means of thyristors (TSR),<br>
(2) capacitors which are switched by means of thyristors (TSC) and<br>
(3) inductors which are controlled by means of thyristors (TCR).<br>
With the TSR and TSC types anti-parallel connected thyristor rectifiers are used as<br>
static switches in order to switch inductors or capacitors on or off and because of that to con-<br>
trol the reactive-power flow. Such an on-off-control enables changes of the reactive-power<br>
flow in discrete steps. An economic design of such systems includes normally the use of a step<br>
transformer in order to create the connection to the rectifier and the inductor or to the capaci-<br>
tor. In order to achieve a fine control of the reactive-power supply by such a on-off controlling<br>
one need a larger number of static reactive-power compensators which are connected in par-<br>
allel. Such an apparatus would request a large number of thyristor rectifiers which are de-<br>
signed for the full voltage. This would lead to an increase of the costs.<br>
In the case of the TCR type the anti-parallel connected thyristor rectifiers are not only<br>
used to switch on/off the static reactive-power compensators (SVC) but also to change the<br>
reactive-power flow by adjusting the firing angle of the rectifiers. The change of the firing<br>
angle changes the time span during which the inductor leads a current and thus changes the<br>
effective resistance of the inductor. Differing from the TSR and TSC types, the TCR type en-<br>
ables a continuous control of the reactive-power. However, the interruptions of the current<br>
which flows through the inductor leads to harmonic waves, which requires the use of very<br>
expensive harmonic wave filters.<br>
For creating a variable electrical voltage or an electrical current in the lower voltage<br>
area it is well-known to provide a transformer on its secondary side with several partial<br>
windings which are electrically arranged in series whereby the arrangement of a serial circuit<br>
as each done by a bridge circuit which has two anti-parallel connected static switches in each<br>
bridge branch. These bridge circuits are - should the occasion arise together with a partial<br>
winding, to which no bridge circuit is assigned - electrically arranged in parallel to a load (US<br>
3,195,038 A, Fig. 7 and 8).<br>
By the present invention the main disadvantages of the known steps of reactive-power<br>
compensation which use on/off switching and resistance controlling, should be overcome. The<br>
invention has the advantage that no harmonic wave filters are needed although the reactive-<br>
power flow is changeable in steps and achieves this in a manner that has as a result no signifi-<br>
cant increase of costs for thyristor rectifiers.<br>
Starting from the circuit arrangement with the features of the preamble of claim 1, dif-<br>
ferent circuit arrangements according to the claims 1 to 3 and 5 are provided in order to solve<br>
the object which circuit arrangements rely on the common idea that the load is formed by the<br>
capacitor as well as by the inductor and that the total power which is supplied to this load is<br>
variably adjustable by the secondary partial windings of a transformer which are assigned to<br>
the capacitor as well as to the inductor and by the anti-parallel circuits of the static switches<br>
which are assigned to these partial windings.<br>
Short description of the circuit arrangements shown in the following figures for carry-<br>
ing out the invention:<br>
Figure 1 shows the principal procedure in order to achieve an arrangement which is<br>
made according to the present invention where this arrangement has two control windings and<br>
one fixed winding on the secondary side of the transformer in order to achieve a voltage con-<br>
trolled capacitor which is switched by thyristors.<br>
Figure 2 shows the same procedure for an arrangement by which three control wind-<br>
ings and one fixed winding are provided on the secondary side of a transformer in order to<br>
achieve a voltage controlled inductor which is switched by thyristors.<br>
Figure 3 shows a first embodiment of the invention, namely an arrangement for a volt-<br>
age controlled static reactive load compensator (VCSVC) with separated secondary trans-<br>
former windings for the control of the voltages which are supplied to a capacitor and an in-<br>
ductor.<br>
Figure 4 shows a second embodiment of the invention, namely an arrangement for a<br>
VCSVC with common secondary transformer windings for capacitor and inductor but with<br>
separated rectifier bridges for the control of the voltages which are supplied to the capacitor<br>
and the inductor.<br>
Figure 5 shows a third embodiment of the invention, namely an arrangement of a<br>
VCSVC with a common transformer and common rectifier bridges for the capacitor and the<br>
inductor and with additional static switches for the selection of the type of the reactive load<br>
flow.<br>
Figure 6 shows a fourth embodiment of the invention and especially a simplified ap-<br>
plication of an arrangement of a VCSVC, which is used for a working field of an inductive to<br>
capacitive reactive load.<br>
Detailed description of the circuit arrangements:<br>
Within the scope of the present invention, a voltage is supplied to a capacitor and/or to<br>
an inductor by a transformer T which has several secondary windings which are intended to<br>
connect the secondary windings in different manners by the static switches BBS so that the<br>
provided voltage can be changed in small steps. According to the figures, the transformer<br>
which is supplied by an alternating voltage source U, is provided on the secondary side by a<br>
fixed winding Wf and a certain number of control windings Wi (l..,n). Each of the control<br>
windings is connected to four bidirectional static switches BSS 1...4, for example to anti-<br>
parallel connected thyristor rectifiers which are arranged in a bridge circuit B1 and B2, re-<br>
spectively.<br>
Figure 1 shows such an arrangement with two control windings W1 and W2 for a volt-<br>
age controlled capacitor C which is switched by thyristors. A similar arrangement for a volt-<br>
age controlled inductor which is switched by thyristors, which has three control windings W1,<br>
W2 and W3 is shown in Figure 2.<br>
In the case that each two switches BBS, which are opposite in the bridge circuit, at<br>
instant blockade of the other two switches, are switched on, it is possible to connect the ac-<br>
cording control winding on three different kinds to the lasting windings:<br>
(1) In series with the fixed winding Wf in that manner that the voltages of the fixed<br>
winding and of the corresponding control winding are in phase.<br>
(2) In series with the fixed winding, whereby the voltages of the fixed winding and the<br>
corresponding control winding are in opposite phase to each other; or<br>
(3) The control winding is left out.<br>
The number of the control windings and their voltage design determine the number of<br>
the steps and the size of the steps. To reach uniform step sizes with an as possible small num-<br>
ber of control windings, the voltage of the control windings Wi is so chosen that it has the<br>
value of VO x 3(i-1), whereby<br>
VO is the smallest step size,<br>
n is the number of control windings and<br>
i is a normal number with values from 1 to n.<br>
In Figure 1, where two control windings W1 and W2 are provided, it is possible to<br>
achieve nine combinations of the supplied voltage: first Vf, then Vf +/- VO, further Vf +/- 2<br>
VO, further Vf+/- 3 VOand Vf+/- 4 VO, whereby Vf is the voltage of the fixed winding. When<br>
Vf = 4 VO then the voltage provided to the capacitor can be changed between 0 and 8 VO in<br>
eight equal steps. Since a voltage of 0 can be reached, when all rectifiers BBS are blockaded,<br>
one gets - as far as one makes Vf = 5 VO - nine voltage steps between 0 and 9 VO.<br>
In a similar way, as shown in Figure 2, it is possible to change the provided voltage to<br>
the inductor D in 27 steps by three control windings Wl, W2 and W3. Basically one can<br>
achieve 3n steps, when n control windings are provided.<br>
The voltage changes are made in discrete steps, i.e. discontinuous. From the practical<br>
point of view, however, the step sizes can be made however as small as needed - in principal<br>
so small to be not distinguishable in the scope of the measurement accuracy - , by increasing<br>
the number of control windings.<br>
The reactive load control is normally used for the purpose of control of a system volt-<br>
age which is normally not controlled to a special value, but must be kept only in a certain<br>
bandwidth. Therefore, it is appropriate when the step size of the voltage which is provided to<br>
the inductor or to the capacitor, is so small that the resultant change of the reactive-power<br>
supply in the controlled voltage system causes voltage changes which are small in comparison<br>
to the specified voltage band.<br>
It is possible to make the control of the reactive-power of such an arrangement actually<br>
continuous if a particular secondary winding is provided which supplies an additional ar-<br>
ranged conductor (TCR) which is controlled by thyristors. The bulk size of such a supple-<br>
mental measure must not be particularly large but only as large as the largest step size for<br>
changing the reactive-power requests for step sizes of the voltage which is provided to the<br>
reactive-power element. Thereafter, the rough control of the reactive-power supply is effected<br>
by stepwise changes of the voltage which is provided to the reactance, and in between this<br>
steps, an additional fine control is achieved by controlling the TCR element, i.e. of the addi-<br>
tional inductor which is controlled by means of thyristors. The bulk size of the TCR-building<br>
group can be made small enough in order to make harmonic waves which result from the op-<br>
eration of the TCR element so small that no harmonic wave filters are requested.<br>
Instead of the fixed winding also a control winding can be provided so that all wind-<br>
ings of the transformers are defined as control windings. However, such an embodiment<br>
would increase the necessary total number of the static control switches.<br>
It is neither necessary nor always desirable that all step sizes of the voltage have the<br>
same size. Reactive-power is proportional to the square of the voltage applied. When the volt-<br>
age which is provided to a reactance is increased from V to V + Vo, this leads to a change of<br>
the reactive-power by the value V02 + 2 V x Vo The higher the output value of the voltage, the<br>
larger is the step size in case of the change of the reactive-power. Therefore, a larger step size<br>
is acceptable in regard to the applied voltage for the fust steps. A way to provide a larger step<br>
size only for the first steps and to make the other steps equal in size, consists in choosing the<br>
voltage of the fixed windings relatively large. When, for example, like in the case of figure 1<br>
with two control windings, Vf = 8 x Vo, then the smallest value of the provided voltage is<br>
equal to 4 x Vo and every following step comprises steps of the magnitude Vo.<br>
According to the invention, there are different possibilities to combine the arrange-<br>
ments for capacitive and inductive reactive-power supply such that one gets a voltage con-<br>
trolled, static reactive-power compensator (VCSVC) with a specific operation range from in-<br>
ductive to capacitive MV AR. One method would be to have separate secondary windings Wn,<br>
W1 and W2 as well as Wf11, W11 and W12 of the transformer each having its own rectifier<br>
groups B1 and B2, and B11 and B12 respectively, as is shown in Figure 3. In this case, it is<br>
required to have the same arrangement of secondary windings for the TSC- and TSR-parts as<br>
far as it regards the number of windings or their voltage dimensioning. In another arrange-<br>
ment, when the TSC- and TSR-parts do not have to be activated at the same time, both parts<br>
can use the same secondary windings Wf, W1 and W2 of the transformer but they should have<br>
separate rectifier groups B1, B2, respective B11 and B12, as is shown in figure 4. Another<br>
possibility would be to have common secondary windings of the transformer T and common<br>
rectifier groups Bl, B2 for the TSC- and TSR-parts, but to provide additional static switches<br>
BSS11, BSS12 in order to select between the use of the capacitor C or the inductor D, as is<br>
shown in figure 5.<br>
In order to simplify the circuit arrangements for an operation range from inductive to<br>
capacitive reactive load, which are shown in the figures 3 to 5, one can also arrange in parallel<br>
to the further partial winding, which is not connected to a bridge branch, a serial circuit of an<br>
inductor or a capacitor and two anti-parallel connected rectifiers, as is shown in figure 6. hi<br>
such a design of the circuit arrangement, the secondary side of the transformer is loaded by an<br>
inductive or a capacitive base load where this base load can be reduced by additionally con-<br>
necting a capacitive or inductive additional load which is controllable in its magnitude. With<br>
the base load is disconnected, a load is only given by the controllable additional load.<br>
Similar to figure 1, figure 6 shows a circuit arrangement with three partial windings<br>
Wf, W1 and W2 on the secondary side of the transformer T where the partial windings W1 and<br>
W2 are each connected to a bridge circuit B1 and B2 respectively, and where anti-parallel<br>
connected static switches BSS1...4 are arranged in each branch of the bridge. A serial circuit<br>
of an inductor Dl and two anti-parallel connected rectifiers V1, V2 is arranged in parallel to<br>
the further partial winding Wf, where the rectifiers can define an additional static switch to<br>
stop, should the occasion arise, the circuit flow through the inductor. - In case the secondary<br>
side of the transformer T is loaded inductively, then a capacitor can be introduced inspite of<br>
an inductor Dl.<br>
For some of the described arrangements, the voltage strength of the static switches is<br>
possibly not sufficient; in order to still provide the requested voltage strength an economic<br>
application would comprise inserting additional rectifiers in series with the capacitor C or the<br>
inductor D. - In the examples according to the figures 1 to 5 it is possible to use the secondary<br>
fixed winding Wf in order to supply other loads.<br>
This and similar modifications in order to enlarge the inner structure or to enlarge the<br>
field of the basic idea to apply a voltage to a reactance in order to control the reactive-power<br>
supply, are included in the basic ideas of this invention. Every modification which is based on<br>
this basic idea, like it is described in the following patent claims, should be covered by these<br>
patent claims, and no limitation of the invention described by the present application should<br>
be incurred from the present description of the invention.<br>
