				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to the field of mobile communications. In idle mode, UE performs neighbor cell measurements and reselections to provide best possible service to User by alv\/ays camping on best suitable cell. This invention relates to description of UE behavior in idle mode. This invention deschbes some methods by which cell reselection procedures can be helped to make best decisions, which would lead to reduce current consumption. More particularly the present invention relates to a method of avoid unnecessary cell reselection measurements and reducing power consumption.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
As a part of Idle mode procedures, UE has to constantly look for better neighbor cells so that UE can remain camp on best suitable cell. In order to achieve this UE has to start neighbor cell measurements based on meeting of certain thresholds (Sintrasearch, Sintersearch and SsearchRAT) and later UE has to rank and perform cell reselection if better ranked cell is found.<br>
There are sudden downwards spikes in UE's measured RSCP and ECNO due to various reasons such as<br>
1)	Sudden Fading Area (which lasts for 0,1 to 2 seconds).<br>
2)	Sometimes when UE moves to long term fading area (e.g. weak signal area and shadow of a mountain / big building).<br><br>
3.Poor performance of DSP especially in weak signal area, where UE finds measured ECNO &amp; RSCP to be lower that what is actually present in that area.<br>
Now when there are sudden fluctuation in measured ECNO/RSCP, UE takes wrong decision to start measurements and performs subsequent cell reselection within very short duration. There is no parameter defined by specifications which can provide protection so as to delay the neighbor cell measurement until measured ECNO/RSCP becomes really bad consistently (Similar such protection is already there for actual cell reselection decision algorithm in terms of T-reselection and Hysteresis for serving cell but this also doesn't solve above mentioned problem). This leads to a ping pong situation in which UE does frequent cell reselections.<br>
This may also lead to missed paging because when UE performs frequent cell reselection among the cells belonging to different LAIs, UE cannot receive MT calls until UE performs LAU.<br>
This is the main cause identified for higher current consumption in Idle mode.<br>
A US Patent no. US 2004/0043769 deschbe the concepts of avoiding unnecessary cell measurements, unnecessary cell reselections and reducing power consumption. However, the concept of applying MR filtering to measure RSCP and ECNO values by using an optimized value for the total number of samples, and the concept of performing an averaging of measured RSCP and<br><br>
ECNO has not been described in the patent application. The concept of performing an adaptive optimization to the measured RSCP and ECNO values to overcome long term fading and UE's poor RF performance in weak signal area has also not been mentioned in the patent application. The patent application mentions the addition of a hysteresis offset to the channel quality metrics of a cell. However, the concept of providing an offset by an appropriate amount to the measured RSCP and ECNO values has not been indicated in the patent application.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention explains two main ideas undertaken for improving UE's battery life in Idle/Cell PCH/URA PCM mode. An MR filtering can be applied to measured ECNO and RSCP values by using an optimized value for number of samples and this helps in reducing the onslaught of sudden downward spikes in measured RSCP/ECNO. Numbers of samples undertaken for performing filtering are inversely proportional to DRX cycle length. This takes care of sudden downward spikes problem. Also an adaptive optimization to measured ECNO/RSCP values can be applied to overcome long term fading and UE's poor RF performance especially in weak signal area. This is necessary since hysteresis values provided by Network don't take care of this condition of unnecessary starting of neighbor cell measurement and it only comes into picture at the time of actual cell reselection decision. In field conditions this invention has provided very good results and overall battery saving is of the<br><br>
order of 50-60% in idle mode, Cell PCH and URA PCH. Also no side effects (such as in terms of MT call success rate) have been found after implementation of this invention.<br>
Accordingly the invention explains a method to avoid unnecessary cell reselection measurement and reducing power consumption comprising the steps of:<br>
measuring RSCP and ECNO values; and<br>
performing an averaging of measured RSCP and ECNO using an MR filter with optimized value for number of samples to be used by it for minimizing sudden fluctuations; and<br>
applying an adaptive optimization to measured ECNO/RSCP values to overcome long term fading and UE's poor RF performance especially in weak signal area.<br>
wherein the number of samples used to perform MR filtehng is inversely proportional to DRX cycle length, which checks the sudden downward spike problem whereby the UE avoids unnecessary measurements and cell reselectlons.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 depicts a flow chart of problem of sudden drop in ECNO/RSCP<br><br>
Figure 2 depicts a flow chart showing advantage of Averaging and Adaptive optimization algorithm<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
As mentioned above, there are two main problems that have been targeted by this invention:<br>
A)	Sudden downward fluctuation in measured ECNO/RSCP values.<br>
B)	General degradation in measured ECNO/RSCP values due to long term fading and UE's poor RF performance especially in week signal area.<br><br>
To tackle the first problem, this invention proposes to use filtered values of measured RSCP and ECNO<br>
UE will perform averaging of measured ECNO &amp; RSCP, so that sudden fluctuation won't happen and UE will not perform unnecessary measurements and will avoid frequent cell reselections. Numbers of samples used for calculating average value are calculated based on DRX cycle in a particular Network<br>
(no_of_samples = (256/drx_parms.drx_cycle_len)).<br>
So for DRX cycle of 1.28 ms UE will use last two plus current instantaneous values for averaging and for a DRX cycle of 2.56 ms, only last and current values will be used for averaging.<br>
Also a maximum limit of 3 has been put to no_of_samples, to avoid averaging algorithm misbehavior when number of samples becomes large with lower order DRX cycles being in used.<br>
To tackle the second problem, this invention proposes to give offset to the measured RSCP and ECNO values by an approphate amount so that UE will not do unnecessary measurements.<br><br>
This offset has to be put in such a way that following three concerns are taken care:<br>
IThis algorithm should make sure that UE remains camped in suitable cell and UE should not wrongly assume S criteria is met when actually it is not meeting.<br>
2.	No Paging should be missed.<br>
3.	It is known that to start various kinds of measurements, knowledge of three parameters is needed. S_Srchlntra, S_Srchlnter and S_SrchRAT for starting intra, inter and inter-rat measurements respectively. Usual values of these parameters will be in decreasing order say 6, 4, 2. This is so because Intra freq search are given more priority than inter-frequency and inter-frequency searches are given more priority that inter-RAT search. But these parameters are not always broadcasted in Network. So before offset is applied to measured values, it needs to taken care that at least the lowest priority types of searches are not avoided.<br>
To meet first and second condition as mentioned above it is proposed that offset should not be applied when measured ECNO and RSCP are less or equal to the Qqualmin and Qrxlevmin values.<br><br>
Also third condition leads to conclusion that offset values should be applied only if measured RSCP and ECNO are ahead of Qrxlevmin and Qqualmin by an amount PROTECTION_THRESHOLD.<br>
Hence ideally following conditions should be met.<br>
PROTECTION_THRESHOLD = min (S_Srchlntra, S_Srchlnter, S_SrchRAT, 2)<br>
However since these parameters are not always broadcasted, it was decided after much experimentation, a lower threshold of 2 can be used as PROTECTION_THRESHOLD.<br>
Now coming to exact amount of offset, after various types of experiments and simulations, it is decided that the measured ECNO can be offset by 2dB and measured RSCP can be offset by 5 dBm. So to make above concept clear in understanding, let's take one example:<br>
Qqualmin=-18	Qrxlevmin=-110      PR0TECTI0N_THRESH0LD=2<br>
ECNO will be modified by<br>
2dB	RSCP will be modified by 5 dBm<br><br><br><br>
In figure 1 problem of sudden drop in ECNO/RSCP and its effects on UE is depicted. This figure shows that because of sudden fluctuations, unnecessary neighbor cell measurements start which leads to higher current consumption in the UE.<br>
Figure 2 shows that because of Averaging using MR filter, sudden fluctuations in measured ECNO and RSCP are smoothened and hence unnecessary measurements and corresponding cell reselections are avoided.<br>
Results obtained after implementing the invention.<br><br><br><br>
Following advantages can be observed with this invention.<br>
1.	UE will avoid lots of unnecessary cell reselections and hence save<br>
battery consumption.<br>
2.	UE will not miss paging and will remain in suitable cell because<br>
Optimized offset values are not applied at exact boundary levels of<br>
measured  RSCP/ECNO,  i.e., when  measured  RSCP/ECNO are near Qrxlevmin / Qqualmin.<br>
3.	Implementation of this invention makes UE much more efficient in<br>
battery consumption as compared to mobile with no such optimizations.<br>
4.	After extensive KPI and Regression tests no performance degradation<br>
was found.<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a microchip, microprocessor, handheld communication device, computer, rendering device or a multi function device.<br><br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart there from.<br><br><br><br>
