				<td>The present invention relates to a process for identifying aflatoxigenic aspergilli by using oligonucleotide primers. In particular, the present invention relates to three sets of novel primers of SEQ ID Nos. 1-6, wherein said three sets of primer are designed from three genes omt, ord, and afl R respectively of aflatoxin biosynthesis pathway of fungi Aspergillus flavus and an improved method of identifying aflatoxinogenic aspergilli using said three sets of primers.<br>
Aflatoxins are potent carcinogenic, mutagenic and teratogenic metabolites produced primarily by the fungal species of Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus. Foods and feeds, especially in warm climates are susceptible to invasion by aflatoxigenic Aspergillus sp. And subsequent production of Aflatoxins during preharvesting, processing, transportation or storage. Over the last few years, means for mycotoxin detection have been simplified, by the adoption of immunological methods. The level of mold infestation and identification of the governing species are important parameters which could give an indication of the quality of the material and future potential for the presence of mycotoxins.<br>
Mold counts are a part of quality control assurance for foods. This method is time consuming, labour intensive, costly requires facilities and mycological expertise and do not allow the specification of mycotoxegenic fungi.<br>
With the advances made in the detection methods, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) facilitates in vitro amplification of target sequence and offers several advantages over traditional methods of detection.<br>
Reference may be made to the work of Miller and Martin (1988) for the application of PCR techniques for the detection of microorganisms, including plant pathogens. However no attempt has been made to detect aflatoxin-producing fungi.<br>
Reference may be made to the works of Payne and Woloshuk (1989) and Nu, et al (1995). Who    have    identified    the    genes    in    Aflatoxins    biosynthetic    pathway    of    strains<br><br><br><br>
of A. flavus and A. parasiticus. However, detection of aflatixigenic fungi were not attempted.<br>
Reference may be made to the work of Shapira, et al (1996) , where in the identification of aflatoxin producing molds in grains has been attempted using PCR techniques. Three genes ver- 1, omt- 1 and apa - 2 coding for key enzymes and regulatory factor in biosynthesis of aflatoxin were used as primers. Positive results were obtained in 24h enriched cultures at lowest spore level of 102 spores per gram. However incubation of dried ground corn seeds in enrichment media allowed detection as few as 102 spores per gram after 48h of incubation. The drawback of these references is that no attempts have been made to detect aflatoxigenic fungi and the traditional methods are non-sensitive, time consuming and lack consistency. The present invention enables detection of aflatoxigenic fungi by PCR using specific aflatoxin biosynthetic pathway genes. This use has application in food system.<br>
The main object of the present invention is an improved method for detection of Aflatoxinogenic aspergilli<br>
Another main object of the present invention is to develop primers for genes omt,<br>
ord, and afl R of aflatoxin biosynthesis pathway.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to develop an improved use for<br>

Still another object of the present invention is to develop a use of identifying<br>
aflatoxinogenic aspergilli directly in food articles.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to develop a highly sensitive use to<br>
identifying aflatoxinogenic aspergilli.<br>
Further object of the present invention is to develop an identification use using<br>
multiple number of primers for more accuracy.<br><br>
The present invention relates to three sets of novel primers of SEQ ID Nos. 1-6, wherein said three sets of primer are designed from three genes omt, ord, and afl R respectively of aflatoxin biosynthesis pathway of fungi Aspergillus flavus and an improved use of identifying aflatoxinogenic aspergilli using said three sets of primers.<br>

a), designing a set of novel nucleotide primers for o-methyl transferase , oxidoreductase and aflatoxin regulatory genes in Aspergillus flavus which may be selected from the sequence of<br>

f). detecting of aflatoxigenic fungi by amplification of target gene may be effected from an initial denaturation at 90° - 98°C for 2 - 8min, amplification cycle of 28 to 40 ,each cycle with a denaturation at 90° - 98°C for 40 - 70secs,annealing at 46° - 62°C for 40 - SOsecs and an extension at 68° - 76°C for 4 to 12min.<br>
g). achieviing the analysis of the PCR product in 1.2 - 1.8% agarose gel electrophoresis, visualization of PCR product by staining with 0.5 ^g /ml ethidium bromide and observation in a UV - transilluminator.<br>

In another embodiment of the present invention, the PCR use can detect from 12 to 120h old mycelia.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the PCR use may detect toxigenic fungi directly in grains.<br>
The patent relates to PCR use for the detection of aflatoxigenic fungi. Polymerase chain reaction use was used to selectively amplify o-methyl transferase, oxidoreductase and aflatoxin regulatory genes in toxigenic fungi. Fungi grown in czapek-dox or potato dextrose broth or from contaminated grains were used for the isolation of template DMA. The PCR reaction mixture and amplification conditions were optimized for specific amplification. Visualization of PCR products revealed that by the use followed, it is possible to detect toxigenic fungi from 10~2 to 10"6 cell numbers in grains and only from aflatoxigenic fungi.<br><br>
The novelty of this use is the use of the designed primers for the direct detection of aflatoxigenic moulds by PCR. This use can detect aflatoxigenic fungi from contaminated grains. The use is rapid and sensitive making it possible to detect aflatoxigenic fungi from contaminated food systems without culturing them. The following examples are given by way of illustrations of the present invention and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>

Sterilization of media and other solutions was achieved by autoclaving for 20 min. at 121°C.<br>

Ten ml of Czapek-dox or potato dextrose broth was inoculated with 1 ml spore suspension of Aspergillus flavus ATCC 46283, Aspergillus ochraceus CFR 221 and Fusarium tricinctum NRRL 32998 separately and the flasks were incubated for 120h at ambient temperature (26° - 28°C) under stationary conditions. The mycelia were harvested by centrifugation, washed well with buffer, ground well using lysis buffer after freezing in liquid nitrogen. After 1h of incubation at 65°C, DMA was extracted using phenol: chloroform: amyl alcohol mixture at 25:24:1 concentration. The aqueous phase was redissolved in Tris-EDTA buffer.

each of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate,4nm of each primer and unit of taq DMA polymerase and sterile ultra filtered water. Template DMAs were initially denatured at 94°C for 4 min. Subsequently, a total of 35 amplification cycle was carried out in a programmable thermocycler. Each cycle consisted of denaturation for 30 sec. at 94°C, primer annealing for 45 secs.at 50°C , 58°C and 62°C separately and an extension for 1.15 min. at 72°C . The last cycle was followed by a final extension at72°Cfor10min.<br>

Aliquots of 10(al PCR products were mixed with 2.0 jal of loading dye and loaded on to 1.2% agarose gel and subjected to electrophoresis for 2h at 100 volts in 1 x TAB buffer. Gel was stained with ethidium bromide (0.5jag /ml), destained with distilled water and examined on a UV transilluminator. A 100 bp ladder was used as a molecular size marker. The amplification profile in the gel was documented in a CCD-camera based gel documentation system.<br>
Specific amplicons of 406, 387, and 1299 bp for omt, ord and afl R were observed with Aspergillus flavus template DNA while, Aspergillus ochraceus and Fusarium tricinctum template genes did not show amplification.<br>
