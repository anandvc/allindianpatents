				<td>Multi-channel synthesizer and method for generating a<br>
multi-channel output signal<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to multi-channel audio proc-<br>
essing and, in particular, to multi-channel audio recon-<br>
struction using a base channel and parametric side informa-<br>
tion for reconstructing an output signal having a plurality<br>
of channels.<br>
Background of the invention and prior art<br>
In recent times, the multi-channel audio reproduction tech-<br>
nique is becoming more and more important. This may be due<br>
to the fact that audio compression/encoding techniques such<br>
as the well-known mp3 technique have made it possible to<br>
distribute audio records via the Internet or other trans-<br>
mission channels having a limited bandwidth. The mp3 coding<br>
technique has become so famous because of the fact that it<br>
allows distribution of all the records in a stereo format,<br>
i.e., a digital representation of the audio record includ-<br>
ing a first or left stereo channel and a second or right<br>
stereo channel.<br>
Nevertheless, there are basic shortcomings of conventional<br>
two-channel sound systems. Therefore, the surround tech-<br>
nique has been developed. A recommended multi-channel-<br>
surround representation includes, in addition to the two<br>
stereo channels L and R, an additional center channel C and<br>
two surround channels Ls, Rs. This reference sound format<br>
is also referred to as three/two-stereo, which means three<br>
front channels and two surround channels. Generally, five<br><br>
transmission channels are required. In a playback environ-<br>
ment, at least five speakers at the respective five differ-<br>
ent places are needed to get an optimum sweet spot in a<br>
certain distance from the five well-placed loudspeakers.<br>
Several techniques are known in the art for reducing the<br>
amount of data required for transmission of a multi-channel<br>
audio signal. Such techniques are called joint stereo tech-<br>
niques. To this end, reference is made to Fig. 10, which<br>
shows a joint stereo device 60. This device can be a device<br>
implementing e.g. intensity stereo (IS) or binaural cue<br>
coding (BCC). Such a device generally receives - as an in-<br>
put - at least two channels (CH1, CH2, ... CHn) , and outputs<br>
a single carrier channel and parametric data. The paramet-<br>
ric data are defined such that, in a decoder, an approxima-<br>
tion of an original channel (CH1, CH2, ... CHn) can be calcu-<br>
lated.<br>
Normally, the carrier channel will include subband samples,<br>
spectral coefficients, time domain samples etc, which pro-<br>
vide a comparatively fine representation of the underlying<br>
signal, while the parametric data do not include such sam-<br>
ples of spectral coefficients but include control parame-<br>
ters for controlling a certain reconstruction algorithm<br>
such as weighting by multiplication, time shifting, fre-<br>
quency shifting, phase shifting, ... The parametric data,<br>
therefore, include only a comparatively coarse representa-<br>
tion of the signal or the associated channel. Stated in<br>
numbers, the amount of data required by a carrier channel<br>
will be in the range of 60 - 70 kbit/s, while the amount of<br>
data required by parametric side information for one chan-<br>
nel will be in the range of 1,5 - 2,5 kbit/s. An example<br>
for parametric data are the well-known scale factors, in-<br>
tensity stereo information or binaural cue parameters as<br>
will be described below.<br><br>
Intensity stereo coding is described in AES preprint 3799,<br>
"Intensity Stereo Coding", J. Herre, K. H. Brandenburg, D.<br>
Lederer, February 1994, Amsterdam. Generally, the concept<br>
of intensity stereo is based on a main axis transform to be<br>
applied to the data of both stereophonic audio channels. If<br>
most of the data points are concentrated around the first<br>
principle axis, a coding gain can be achieved by rotating<br>
both signals by a certain angle prior to coding. This is,<br>
however, not always true for real stereophonic production<br>
techniques. Therefore, this technique is modified by ex-<br>
cluding the second orthogonal component from transmission<br>
in the bit stream. Thus, the reconstructed signals for the<br>
left and right channels consist of differently weighted or<br>
scaled versions of the same transmitted signal. Neverthe-<br>
less, the reconstructed signals differ in their amplitude<br>
but are identical regarding their phase information. The<br>
energy-time envelopes of both original audio channels, how-<br>
ever, are preserved by means of the selective scaling op-<br>
eration, which typically operates in a frequency selective<br>
manner. This conforms to the human perception of sound at<br>
high frequencies, where the dominant spatial cues are de-<br>
termined by the energy envelopes.<br>
Additionally, in practical implementations, the transmitted<br>
signal, i.e. the carrier channel is generated from the sum<br>
signal of the left channel and the right channel instead of<br>
rotating both components. Furthermore, this processing,<br>
i.e., generating intensity stereo parameters for performing<br>
the scaling operation, is performed frequency selective,<br>
i.e., independently for each scale factor band, i.e., en-<br>
coder frequency partition. Preferably, both channels are<br>
combined to form a combined or "carrier" channel, and, in<br>
addition to the combined channel, the intensity stereo in-<br>
formation is determined which depend on the energy of the<br><br>
first channel, the energy of the second channel or the en-<br>
ergy of the combined or channel.<br>
The BCC technique is described in AES convention paper<br>
5574, "Binaural cue coding applied to stereo and multi-<br>
channel audio compression", C. Faller, F. Baumgarte, May<br>
2002, Munich. In BCC encoding, a number of audio input<br>
channels are converted to a spectral representation using a<br>
DFT based transform with overlapping windows. The resulting<br>
uniform spectrum is divided into non-overlapping partitions<br>
each having an index. Each partition has a bandwidth pro-<br>
portional to the equivalent rectangular bandwidth (ERB).<br>
The inter-channel level differences (ICLD) and the inter-<br>
channel time differences (ICTD) are estimated for each par-<br>
tition for each frame k. The ICLD and ICTD are quantized<br>
and coded resulting in a BCC bit stream. The inter-channel<br>
level differences and inter-channel time differences are<br>
given for each channel relative to a reference channel.<br>
Then, the parameters are calculated in accordance with pre-<br>
scribed formulae, which depend on the certain partitions of<br>
the signal to be processed.<br>
At a decoder-side, the decoder receives a mono signal and<br>
the BCC bit stream. The mono signal is transformed into the<br>
frequency domain and input into a spatial synthesis block,<br>
which also receives decoded ICLD and ICTD values. In the<br>
spatial synthesis block, the BCC parameters (ICLD and ICTD)<br>
values are used to perform a weighting operation of the<br>
mono signal in order to synthesize the multi-channel sig-<br>
nals, which, after a frequency/time conversion, represent a<br>
reconstruction of the original multi-channel audio signal.<br>
In case of BCC, the joint stereo module 60 is operative to<br>
output the channel side information such that the paramet-<br>
ric channel data are quantized and encoded ICLD or ICTD pa-<br><br>
rameters, wherein one of the original channels is used as<br>
the reference channel for coding the channel side informa-<br>
tion.<br>
Normally, the carrier channel is formed of the sum of the<br>
participating original channels.<br>
Naturally, the above techniques only provide a mono repre-<br>
sentation for a decoder, which can only process the carrier<br>
channel, but is not able to process the parametric data for<br>
generating one or more approximations of more than one in-<br>
put channel.<br>
The audio coding technique known as binaural cue coding<br>
(BCC) is also well described in the United States patent<br>
application publications US 2003, 0219130 A1, 2003/0026441<br>
A1 and 2003/0035553 A1. Additional reference is also made<br>
to "Binaural Cue Coding. Part II: Schemes and Applica-<br>
tions", C. Faller and F. Baumgarte, IEEE Trans. On Audio<br>
and Speech Proc, Vol. 11, No. 6, Nov. 1993. The cited<br>
United States patent application publications and the two<br>
cited technical publications on the BCC technique authored<br>
by Faller and Baumgarte are incorporated herein by refer-<br>
ence in their entireties.<br>
In the following, a typical generic BCC scheme for multi-<br>
channel audio coding is elaborated in more detail with ref-<br>
erence to Figures 11 to 13. Figure 11 shows such a generic<br>
binaural cue coding scheme for coding/transmission of<br>
multi-channel audio signals. The multi-channel audio input<br>
signal at an input 110 of a BCC encoder 112 is down mixed<br>
in a down mix block 114. In the present example, the origi-<br>
nal multi-channel signal at the input 110 is a 5-channel<br>
surround signal having a front left channel, a front right<br>
channel, a left surround channel, a right surround channel<br><br>
and a center channel. In a preferred embodiment of the pre-<br>
sent invention, the down mix block 114 produces a sum sig-<br>
nal by a simple addition of these five channels into a mono<br>
signal. Other down mixing schemes are known in the art such<br>
that, using a multi-channel input signal, a down mix signal<br>
having a single channel can be obtained. This single chan-<br>
nel is output at a sum signal line 115. A side information<br>
obtained by a BCC analysis block 116 is output at a side<br>
information line 117. In the BCC analysis block, inter-<br>
channel level differences (ICLD), and inter-channel time<br>
differences (ICTD) are calculated as has been outlined<br>
above. Recently, the BCC analysis block 116 has been en-<br>
hanced to also calculate inter-channel correlation values<br>
(ICC values) . The sum signal and the side information is<br>
transmitted, preferably in a quantized and encoded form, to<br>
a BCC decoder 120. The BCC decoder decomposes the transmit-<br>
ted sum signal into a number of subbands and applies scal-<br>
ing, delays and other processing to generate the subbands<br>
of the output multi-channel audio signals. This processing<br>
is performed such that ICLD, ICTD and ICC parameters (cues)<br>
of a reconstructed multi-channel signal at an output 121<br>
are similar to the respective cues for the original multi-<br>
channel signal at the input 110 into the BCC encoder 112.<br>
To this end, the BCC decoder 120 includes a BCC synthesis<br>
block 122 and a side information processing block 123.<br>
In the following, the internal construction of the BCC syn-<br>
thesis block 122 is explained with reference to Fig. 12.<br>
The sum signal on line 115 is input into a time/frequency<br>
conversion unit or filter bank FB 125. At the output of<br>
block 125, there exists a number N of sub band signals or,<br>
in an extreme case, a block of a spectral coefficients,<br>
when the audio filter bank 125 performs a 1:1 transform,<br>
i.e., a transform which produces N spectral coefficients<br>
from N time domain samples.<br><br>
The BCC synthesis block 122 further comprises a delay stage<br>
126, a level modification stage 127, a correlation process-<br>
ing stage 128 and an inverse filter bank stage IFB 129. At<br>
the output of stage 129, the reconstructed multi-channel<br>
audio signal having for example five channels in case of a<br>
5-channel surround system, can be output to a set of loud-<br>
speakers 124 as illustrated in Fig. 11.<br>
As shown in Fig. 12, the input signal s (n) is converted<br>
into the frequency domain or filter bank domain by means of<br>
element 125. The signal output by element 125 is multiplied<br>
such that several versions of the same signal are obtained<br>
as illustrated by multiplication node 130. The number of<br>
versions of the original signal is equal to the number of<br>
output channels in the output signal, to be reconstructed<br>
When, in general, each version of the original signal at<br>
node 130 is subjected to a certain delay d1, d2, ..., di, ...,<br>
dN. The delay parameters are computed by the side informa-<br>
tion processing block 123 in Fig. 11 and are derived from<br>
the inter-channel time differences as determined by the BCC<br>
analysis block 116.<br>
The same is true for the multiplication parameters a1, a2,<br>
..., a1, ..., aN, which are also calculated by the side infor-<br>
mation processing block 123 based on the inter-channel<br>
level differences as calculated by the BCC analysis block<br>
116.<br>
The ICC parameters calculated by the BCC analysis block 116<br>
are used for controlling the functionality of block 128<br>
such that certain correlations between the delayed and<br>
level-manipulated signals are obtained at the outputs of<br>
block 128. It is to be noted here that the ordering of the<br><br>
stages 126, 127, 128 may be different from the case shown<br>
in Fig. 12.<br>
It is to be noted here that, in a frame-wise processing of<br>
an audio signal, the BCC analysis is performed frame-wise,<br>
i.e. time-varying, and also frequency-wise. This means<br>
that, for each spectral band, the BCC parameters are ob-<br>
tained. This means that, in case the audio filter bank 125<br>
decomposes the input signal into for example 32 band pass<br>
signals, the BCC analysis block obtains a set of BCC pa-<br>
rameters for each of the 32 bands. Naturally the BCC syn-<br>
thesis block 122 from Fig. 11, which is shown in detail in<br>
Fig. 12, performs a reconstruction which is also based on<br>
the 32 bands in the example.<br>
In the following, reference is made to Fig. 13 showing a<br>
setup to determine certain BCC parameters. Normally, ICLD,<br>
ICTD and ICC parameters can be defined between pairs of<br>
channels. However, it is preferred to determine ICLD and<br>
ICTD parameters between a reference channel and each other<br>
channel. This is illustrated in Fig. 13A.<br>
ICC parameters can be defined in different ways. Most gen-<br>
erally, one could estimate ICC parameters in the encoder<br>
between all possible channel pairs as indicated in Fig.<br>
13B. In this case, a decoder would synthesize ICC such that<br>
it is approximately the same as in the original multi-<br>
channel signal between all possible channel pairs. It was,<br>
however, proposed to estimate only ICC parameters between<br>
the strongest two channels at each time. This scheme is il-<br>
lustrated in Fig. 13C, where an example is shown, in which<br>
at one time instance, an ICC parameter is estimated between<br>
channels 1 and 2, and, at another time instance, an ICC pa-<br>
rameter is calculated between channels 1 and 5. The decoder<br>
then synthesizes the inter-channel correlation between the<br><br>
strongest channels in the decoder and applies some heuris-<br>
tic rule for computing and synthesizing the inter-channel<br>
coherence for the remaining channel pairs.<br>
Regarding the calculation of, for example, the multiplica-<br>
tion parameters a1, aN based on transmitted ICLD parame-<br>
ters, reference is made to AES convention paper 5574 cited<br>
above. The ICLD parameters represent an energy distribution<br>
in an original multi-channel signal. Without loss of gener-<br>
ality, it is shown in Fig. 13A that there are four ICLD pa-<br>
rameters showing the energy difference between all other<br>
channels and the front left channel. In the side informa-<br>
tion processing block 123, the multiplication parameters<br>
a1, ..., aN are derived from the ICLD parameters such that the<br>
total energy of all reconstructed output channels is the<br>
same as (or proportional to) the energy of the transmitted<br>
sum signal. A simple way for determining these parameters<br>
is a 2-stage process, in which, in a first stage, the mul-<br>
tiplication factor for the left front channel is set to<br>
unity, while multiplication factors for the other channels<br>
in Fig. 13A are set to the transmitted ICLD values. Then,<br>
in a second stage, the energy of all five channels is cal-<br>
culated and compared to the energy of the transmitted sum<br>
signal. Then, all channels are downscaled using a down-<br>
scaling factor which is equal for all channels, wherein the<br>
downscaling factor is selected such that the total energy<br>
of all reconstructed output channels is, after downscaling,<br>
equal to the total energy of the transmitted sum signal.<br>
Naturally, there are other methods for calculating the mul-<br>
tiplication factors, which do not rely on the 2-stage proc-<br>
ess but which only need a 1-stage process.<br>
Regarding the delay parameters, it is to be noted that the<br>
delay parameters ICTD, which are transmitted from a BCC en-<br><br>
coder can be used directly, when the delay parameter d1 for<br>
the left front channel is set to zero. No reseating has to<br>
be done here, since a delay does not alter the energy of<br>
the signal.<br>
Regarding the inter-channel coherence measure ICC transmit-<br>
ted from the BCC encoder to the BCC decoder, it is to be<br>
noted here that a coherence manipulation can be done by<br>
modifying the multiplication factors a1, ..., an such as by<br>
multiplying the weighting factors of all subbands with ran-<br>
dom numbers with values between 201ogl0(-6) and 201ogl0(6).<br>
The pseudo-random sequence is preferably chosen such that<br>
the variance is approximately constant for all critical<br>
bands, and the average is zero within each critical band.<br>
The same sequence is applied to the spectral coefficients<br>
for each different frame. Thus, the auditory image width is<br>
controlled by modifying the variance of the pseudo-random<br>
sequence. A larger variance creates a larger image width.<br>
The variance modification can be performed in individual<br>
bands that are critical-band wide. This enables the simul-<br>
taneous existence of multiple objects in an auditory scene,<br>
each object having a different image width. A suitable am-<br>
plitude distribution for the pseudo-random sequence is a<br>
uniform distribution on a logarithmic scale as it is out-<br>
lined in the US patent application publication 2003/0219130<br>
Al. Nevertheless, all BCC synthesis processing is related<br>
to a single input channel transmitted as the sum signal<br>
from the BCC encoder to the BCC decoder as shown in Fig.<br>
11.<br>
A related technique, also known as parametric stereo, is<br>
described in J. Breebaart, S. van de Par, A. Kohlrausch, E.<br>
Schuijers, "High-Quality Parametric Spatial Audio Coding at<br>
Low Bitrates", AES 116th Convention, Berlin, Preprint 6072,<br>
May 2004, and E. Schuijers, J. Breebaart, H. Purnhagen, J.<br><br>
Engdegard, "Low Complexity Parametric Stereo Coding", AES<br>
116th Convention, Berlin, Preprint 6073, May 2004.<br>
As has been outlined above with respect to Fig. 13, the pa-<br>
rametric side information, i.e., the interchannel level<br>
differences (ICLD), the interchannel time differences<br>
(ICTD) or the interchannel coherence parameter (ICC) can be<br>
calculated and transmitted for each of the five channels.<br>
This means that one, normally, transmits five sets of in-<br>
terchannel level differences for a five channel signal. The<br>
same is true for the interchannel time differences. With<br>
respect to the interchannel coherence parameter, it can<br>
also be sufficient to only transmit for example two sets of<br>
these parameters.<br>
As has been outlined above with respect to Fig. 12, there<br>
is not a single level difference parameter, time difference<br>
parameter or coherence parameter for one frame or time por-<br>
tion of a signal. Instead, these parameters are determined<br>
for several different frequency bands so that a frequency-<br>
dependent parametrization is obtained. Since it is pre-<br>
ferred to use for example 32 frequency channels, i.e., a<br>
filter bank having 32 frequency bands for BCC analysis and<br>
BCC synthesis, the parameters can occupy quite a lot of<br>
data. Although - compared to other multi-channel transmis-<br>
sions - the parametric representation results in a quite<br>
low data rate, there is a continuing need for further re-<br>
duction of the necessary data rate for representing a<br>
multi-channel signal such as a signal having two channels<br>
(stereo signal) or a signal having more than two channels<br>
such as a multi-channel surround signal.<br>
To this end, the encoder-side calculated reconstruction pa-<br>
rameters are quantized in accordance with a certain quanti-<br>
zation rule. This means that unquantized reconstruction pa-<br><br>
rameters are mapped onto a limited set of quantization lev-<br>
els or quantization indices as it is known in the art and<br>
described in detail in C. Faller and F. Baumgarte, "Binau-<br>
ral cue coding applied to audio compression with flexible<br>
rendering," AES 113th Convention, Los Angeles, Preprint<br>
5686, October 2002.<br>
Quantization has the effect that all parameter values,<br>
which are smaller than the quantization step size, are<br>
quantized to zero. Additionally, by mapping a large set of<br>
unquantized values to a small set of quantized values re-<br>
sults in data saving per se. These data rate savings are<br>
further enhanced by entropy-encoding the quantized recon-<br>
struction parameters on the encoder-side. Preferred en-<br>
tropy-encoding methods are Huffman methods based on prede-<br>
fined code tables or based on an actual determination of<br>
signal statistics and signal-adaptive construction of code-<br>
books. Alternatively, other entropy-encoding tools can be<br>
used such as arithmetic encoding.<br>
Generally, one has the rule that the data rate required for<br>
the reconstruction parameters decreases with increasing<br>
quantizer step size. Stated in other words, a coarser quan-<br>
tization results in a lower data rate, and a finer quanti-<br>
zation results in a higher data rate.<br>
Since parametric signal representations are normally re-<br>
quired for low data rate environments, one tries to quan-<br>
tize the reconstruction parameters as coarse as possible to<br>
obtain a signal representation having a certain amount of<br>
data in the base channel, and also having a reasonable<br>
small amount of data for the side information which include<br>
the quantized and entropy-encoded reconstruction parame-<br>
ters .<br><br>
Prior art methods, therefore, derive the reconstruction pa-<br>
rameters to be transmitted directly from the multi-channel<br>
signal to be encoded. A coarse quantization as discussed<br>
above results in reconstruction parameter distortions,<br>
which result in large rounding errors, when the quantized<br>
reconstruction parameter is inversely quantized in a de-<br>
coder and used for multi-channel synthesis. Naturally, the<br>
rounding error increases with the quantizer step size,<br>
i.e., with the selected "quantizer coarseness". Such round-<br>
ing errors may result in a quantization level change, i.e.,<br>
in a change from a first quantization level at a first time<br>
instant to a second quantization level at a later time in-<br>
stant, wherein the difference between one quantizer level<br>
and another quantizer level is defined by the quite large<br>
quantizer step size, which is preferable for a coarse quan-<br>
tization. Unfortunately, such a quantizer level change<br>
amounting to the large quantizer step size can be triggered<br>
by only a small parameter change, when the unquantized pa-<br>
rameter is in the middle between two quantization levels.<br>
It is clear that the occurrence of such quantizer index<br>
changes in the side information results in the same strong<br>
changes in the signal synthesis stage. When - as an example<br>
- the interchannel level difference is considered, it be-<br>
comes clear that a strong change results in a sharp de-<br>
crease of loudness of a certain loudspeaker signal and an<br>
accompanying sharp increase of the loudness of a signal for<br>
another loudspeaker. This situation, which is only trig-<br>
gered by a quantization level change and a coarse quantiza-<br>
tion can be perceived as an immediate relocation of a sound<br>
source from a (virtual) first place to a (virtual) second<br>
place. Such an immediate relocation from one time instant<br>
to another time instant sounds unnatural, i.e., is per-<br>
ceived as a modulation effect, since sound sources of, in<br>
particular, tonal signals do not change their location very<br>
fast.<br><br>
Generally, also transmission errors may result in sharp<br>
changes of quantizer indices, which immediately result in<br>
the sharp changes in the multi-channel output signal, which<br>
is even more true for situations, in which a coarse quan-<br>
tizer for data rate reasons has been adopted.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide an im-<br>
proved signal synthesis concept allowing a low data rate on<br>
the one hand and a good subjective quality on the other<br>
hand.<br>
In accordance with the first aspect of the present inven-<br>
tion, this object is achieved by a multi-channel synthe-<br>
sizer for generating an output signal from an input signal,<br>
the input signal having at least one input channel and a<br>
sequence of quantized reconstruction parameters, the quan-<br>
tized reconstruction parameters being quantized in accor-<br>
dance with a quantization rule, and being associated with<br>
subsequent time portions of the input channel, the output<br>
signal having a number of synthesized output channels, and<br>
the number of synthesized output channels being greater<br>
than 1 or greater than a number of input channels, compris-<br>
ing: a post processor for determining a post processed re-<br>
construction parameter or a post processed quantity derived<br>
from the reconstruction parameter for a time portion of the<br>
input signal to be processed, wherein the post processor is<br>
operative to determine the post processed reconstruction<br>
parameter such that a value of the post processed recon-<br>
struction parameter or the post processed quantity is dif-<br>
ferent from a value obtainable using requantization in<br>
accordance with the quantization rule; and a multi-channel<br><br>
reconstructor for reconstructing a time portion of the num-<br>
ber of synthesized output channels using the time portion<br>
of the input channel and the post processed reconstruction<br>
parameter or the post processed quantity.<br>
In accordance with a second aspect of the invention, this<br>
object is achieved by a method of generating an output sig-<br>
nal from an input signal, the input signal having at least<br>
one input channel and a sequence of quantized reconstruc-<br>
tion parameters, the quantized reconstruction parameters<br>
being quantized in accordance with a quantization rule, and<br>
being associated with subsequent time portions of the input<br>
channel, the output signal having a number of synthesized<br>
output channels, and the number of synthesized output chan-<br>
nels being greater than 1 or greater than a number of input<br>
channels, comprising: determining a post processed recon-<br>
struction parameter or a post processed quantity derived<br>
from the reconstruction parameter for a time portion of the<br>
input signal to be processed, such that a value of the post<br>
processed reconstruction parameter or the post processed<br>
quantity is different from a value obtainable using requan-<br>
tization in accordance with the quantization rule; and<br>
reconstructing a time portion of the number of synthesized<br>
output channels using the time portion of the input channel<br>
and the post processed reconstruction parameter or the post<br>
processed quantity.<br>
In accordance with a third aspect of the present invention,<br>
this object is achieved by a computer program implementing<br>
the above method, when running on a computer.<br>
The present invention is based on the finding that a post<br>
processing for quantized reconstruction parameters used in<br>
a multi-channel synthesizer is operative to reduce or even<br>
eliminate problems associated with coarse quantization on<br><br>
the one hand and quantization level changes on the other<br>
hand. While, in prior art systems, a small parameter change<br>
in an encoder results in a strong parameter change at the<br>
decoder, since a requantization in the synthesizer is only<br>
admissible for the limited set of quantized values, the in-<br>
ventive device performs a post processing of reconstruction<br>
parameters so that the post processed reconstruction pa-<br>
rameter for a time portion to be processed of the input<br>
signal is not determined by the encoder-adopted quantiza-<br>
tion raster, but results in a value of the reconstruction<br>
parameter, which is different from a value obtainable by<br>
the quantization in accordance with the quantization rule.<br>
While, in a linear quantizer case, the prior art method<br>
only allows inversely quantized values being integer multi-<br>
ples of the quantizer step size, the inventive post proc-<br>
essing allows inversely quantized values to be non-integer<br>
multiples of the quantizer step size. This means that the<br>
inventive post processing eliminates the quantizer step<br>
size limitation, since also post processed reconstruction<br>
parameters lying between two adjacent quantizer levels can<br>
be obtained by post processing and used by the inventive<br>
multi-channel reconstructor, which makes use of the post<br>
processed reconstruction parameter.<br>
This post processing can be performed before or after re-<br>
quantization in a multi-channel synthesizer. When the post<br>
processing is performed with the quantized parameters,<br>
i.e., with the quantizer indices, an inverse quantizer is<br>
needed, which can inversely quantize not only quantizer<br>
step multiples, but which can also inversely quantize to<br>
inversely quantized values between multiples of the quan-<br>
tizer step size.<br><br>
In case the post processing is performed using inversely<br>
quantized reconstruction parameters, a straight-forward in-<br>
verse quantizer can be used, and an interpola-<br>
tion/filtering/smoothing is performed with the inversely-<br>
quantized values.<br>
In case of a non-linear quantization rule, such as a loga-<br>
rithmic quantization rule, a post processing of the quan-<br>
tized reconstruction parameters before requantization is<br>
preferred, since the logarithmic quantization is similar to<br>
the human ear's perception of sound, which is more accurate<br>
for low-level sound and less accurate for high-level sound,<br>
i.e., makes a kind of a logarithmic compression.<br>
It is to be noted here that the inventive merits are not<br>
only obtained by modifying the reconstruction parameter it-<br>
self which is included in the bit stream as the quantized<br>
parameter. The advantages can also be obtained by deriving<br>
a post processed quantity from the reconstruction parame-<br>
ter. This is especially useful, when the reconstruction pa-<br>
rameter is a difference parameter and a manipulation such<br>
as smoothing is performed on an absolute parameter derived<br>
from the difference parameter.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
post processing for the reconstruction parameters is con-<br>
trolled by means of a signal analyser, which analyses the<br>
signal portion associated with a reconstruction parameter<br>
to find out, which signal characteristic is present. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the inventive post processing is ac-<br>
tivated only for tonal portions of the signal (with respect<br>
to frequency and/or time), while the post processing is de-<br>
activated for non-tonal portions, i.e., transient portions<br>
of the input signal. This makes sure that the full dynamic<br>
of reconstruction parameter changes is transmitted for<br><br>
transient sections of the audio signal, while this is not<br>
the case for tonal portions of the signal.<br>
Preferably, the post processor performs a modification in<br>
the form of a smoothing of the reconstruction parameters,<br>
where this makes sense from a psycho-acoustic point of<br>
view, without affecting important spatial detection cues,<br>
which are of special importance for non-tonal, i.e., tran-<br>
sient signal portions.<br>
The present invention results in a low data rate, since an<br>
encoder-side quantization of reconstruction parameters can<br>
be a coarse quantization, since the system designer does<br>
not have to fear heavy changes in the decoder because of a<br>
change from a reconstruction parameter from one inversely<br>
quantized level to another inversely quantized level, which<br>
change is reduced by the inventive processing by mapping to<br>
a value between two requantization levels.<br>
Another advantage of the present invention is that the<br>
quality of the system is improved, since audible artefacts<br>
caused by a change from one requantization level to the<br>
next allowed requantization level are reduced by the inven-<br>
tive post processing, which is operative to map to a value<br>
between two allowed requantization levels.<br>
Naturally, the inventive post processing of quantized re-<br>
construction parameters represents a further information<br>
loss, in addition to the information loss obtained by pa-<br>
rametrization in the encoder and subsequent quantization of<br>
the reconstruction parameter. This is, however, not as bad<br>
as it sounds, since the inventive post processor preferably<br>
uses the actual or preceding quantized reconstruction pa-<br>
rameters for determining a post processed reconstruction<br>
parameter to be used for reconstruction of the actual time<br><br>
portion of the input signal, i.e., the base channel. It has<br>
been shown that this results in an improved subjective<br>
quality, since encoder-induced errors can be compensated to<br>
a certain degree. Even when encoder-side induced errors are<br>
not compensated by the post processing of the reconstruc-<br>
tion parameters, strong changes of the spatial perception<br>
in the reconstructed multi-channel audio signal are re-<br>
duced, preferably only for tonal signal portions, so that<br>
the subjective listening quality is improved in any case,<br>
irrespective of the fact, whether this results in a further<br>
information loss or not.<br>

Fig. 1 shows a block diagram of an inventive multi-channel<br>
synthesizer for generating an output signal from an input<br>
signal. As will be shown later with reference to Fig. 4,<br>
the input signal has at least one input channel and a se-<br>
quence of quantized reconstruction parameters, the quan-<br>
tized reconstruction parameters being quantized in accor-<br>
dance with a quantization rule. Each reconstruction parame-<br>
ter is associated with a time portion of the input channel<br>
so that a sequence of time portions has associated<br>
therewith a sequence of quantized reconstruction parame-<br>
ters. Additionally, it is to be noted that the output sig-<br>
nal, which is generated by the multi-channel synthesizer of<br>
Fig. 1 has a number of synthesized output channels, which<br>
is in any case greater than the number of input channels in<br>
the input signal. When the number of input channels is 1,<br>
i.e., when there is a single input channel, the number of<br>
output channels will be 2 or more. When, however, the num-<br>
ber of input channels is 2 or 3, the number of output chan-<br>
nels will be at least 3 or at least 4.<br>
In the BCC case described above, the number of input chan-<br>
nels will be 1 or generally not more than 2, while the num-<br>
ber of output channels will be 5 (left surround, left, cen-<br>
ter, right, right surround) or 6 (5 surround channels plus<br>
1 sub-woofer channel) or even more in case of 7.1 or 9.1<br>
multi-channel formats.<br><br>
As shown in Fig. 1, the inventive multi-channel synthesizer<br>
includes, as essential features, a reconstruction parameter<br>
post processor 10 and a multi-channel reconstructor 12. The<br>
reconstruction parameter post processor 10 is operative to<br>
receive quantized and preferably encoded reconstruction pa-<br>
rameters for subsequent time portions of the input channel.<br>
The reconstruction parameter post processor 10 is operative<br>
to determine a post processed reconstruction parameter at<br>
an output thereof for a time portion to be processed of the<br>
input signal. The reconstruction parameter post processor<br>
operates in accordance to a post processing rule, which is<br>
in certain preferred embodiments a low pass filtering rule,<br>
a smoothing rule or something like that. In particular, the<br>
post processor 10 is operative to determine the post proc-<br>
essed reconstruction parameter such that a value of the<br>
post processed reconstruction parameter is different from a<br>
value obtainable by requantization of any quantized recon-<br>
struction parameter in accordance with the quantization<br>
rule.<br>
The multi-channel reconstructor 12 is used for reconstruct-<br>
ing a time portion of each of the number of synthesis out-<br>
put channels using the time portion to be processed of the<br>
input channel and the post processed reconstruction parame-<br>
ter.<br>
In preferred embodiments of the present invention, the<br>
quantized reconstruction parameters are quantized BCC pa-<br>
rameters such as interchannel level differences, interchan-<br>
nel time differences or interchannel coherence parameters.<br>
Naturally, all other reconstruction parameters such as ste-<br>
reo parameters for intensity stereo or parametric stereo<br>
can be processed in accordance with the present invention<br>
as well.<br><br>
To summarize, the inventive system has a first input 14a<br>
for the quantized and preferably encoded reconstruction pa-<br>
rameters associated with subsequent time portions of the<br>
input signal. The subsequent time portions of the input<br>
signal are input into a second input 14b, which is con-<br>
nected to the multi-channel reconstructor 12 and preferably<br>
to an input signal analyser 16, which will be described<br>
later. On the output side, the inventive multi-channel syn-<br>
thesizer of Fig. 1 has a multi-channel output signal output<br>
18, which includes several output channels, the number of<br>
which is larger than a number of input channels, wherein<br>
the number of input channels can be a single input channel<br>
or two or more input channels. In any case, there are more<br>
output channels than input channels, since the synthesized<br>
output channels are formed by use of the input signal on<br>
the one hand and the side information in the form of the<br>
reconstruction parameters on the other hand.<br>
In the following, reference will be made to Fig. 4, which<br>
shows an example for a bit stream. The bit stream includes<br>
several frames 20a, 20b, 20c,... Each frame includes a time<br>
portion of the input signal indicated by the upper rectan-<br>
gle of a frame in Fig. 4. Additionally, each frame includes<br>
a set of quantized reconstruction parameters which are as-<br>
sociated with the time portion, and which are illustrated<br>
in Fig. 4 by the lower rectangle of each frame 20a, 20b,<br>
20c. Exemplarily, frame 20b is considered as the input sig-<br>
nal portion to be processed, wherein this frame has preced-<br>
ing input signal portions, i.e., which form the "past" of<br>
the input signal portion to be processed. Additionally,<br>
there are following input signal portions, which form the<br>
"future" of the input signal portion to be processed (the<br>
input portion to be processed is also termed as the "ac-<br>
tual" input signal portion), while input signal portions in<br>
the "past" are termed as former input signal portions,<br><br>
while signal portions in the future are termed as later in-<br>
put signal portions.<br>
In the following, reference is made to Fig. 2 with respect<br>
to a complete encoder/decoder set-up, in which the inven-<br>
tive multi-channel synthesizer can be situated.<br>
Fig. 2 shows an encoder-side 21 and a decoder-side 22. In<br>
the encoder, N original input channels are input into a<br>
down mixer stage 23. The down mixer stage is operative to<br>
reduce the number of channels to e. g. a single mono-<br>
channel or, possibly, to two stereo channels. The down<br>
mixed signal representation at the output of down mixer 23<br>
is, then, input into a source encoder 24, the source en-<br>
coder being implemented for example as an mp3 decoder or as<br>
an AAC encoder producing an output bit stream. The encoder-<br>
side 21 further comprises a parameter extractor 25, which,<br>
in accordance with the present invention, performs the BCC<br>
analysis (block 116 in Fig. 11) and outputs the quantized<br>
and preferably Huffman-encoded interchannel level differ-<br>
ences (ICLD) . The bit stream at the output of the source<br>
encoder 24 as well as the quantized reconstruction parame-<br>
ters output by parameter extractor 25 can be transmitted to<br>
a decoder 22 or can be stored for later transmission to a<br>
decoder, etc.<br>
The decoder 22 includes a source decoder 26, which is op-<br>
erative to reconstruct a signal from the received bit<br>
stream (originating from the source encoder 24) . To this<br>
end, the source decoder 26 supplies, at its output, subse-<br>
quent time portions of the input signal to an up-mixer 12,<br>
which performs the same functionality as the multi-channel<br>
reconstructor 12 in Fig. 1. Preferably, this functionality<br>
is a BCC synthesis as implemented by block 122 in Fig. 11.<br><br>
Contrary to Fig. 11, the inventive multi-channel synthe-<br>
sizer further comprises the post processor 10, which is<br>
termed as "interchannel level difference (ICLD) smoother",<br>
which is controlled by the input signal analyser 16, which<br>
preferably performs a tonality analysis of the input sig-<br>
nal .<br>
It can be seen from Fig. 2 that there are reconstruction<br>
parameters such as the interchannel level differences<br>
(ICLDs), which are input into the ICLD smoother, while<br>
there is an additional connection between the parameter ex-<br>
tractor 25 and the up-mixer 12. Via this by-pass connec-<br>
tion, other parameters for reconstruction, which do not<br>
have to be post processed can be supplied from the parame-<br>
ter extractor 25 to the up-mixer 12.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a preferred embodiment of the signal-adaptive<br>
reconstruction parameter processing formed by the signal<br>
analyser 16 and the ICLD smoother 10.<br>
The signal analyser 16 is formed from a tonality determina-<br>
tion unit 16a and a subsequent thresholding device 16b. Ad-<br>
ditionally, the reconstruction parameter post processor 10<br>
from Fig. 2 includes a smoothing filter 10a and a post<br>
processor switch 10b. The post processor switch 10b is op-<br>
erative to be controlled by the thresholding device 16b so<br>
that the switch is actuated, when the thresholding device<br>
16b determines that a certain signal characteristic of the<br>
input signal such as the tonality characteristic is in a<br>
predetermined relation to a certain specified threshold. In<br>
the present case, the situation is such that the switch is<br>
actuated to be in the upper position (as shown in Fig. 3),<br>
when the tonality of a signal portion of the input signal,<br>
and, in particular, a certain frequency band of a certain<br>
time portion of the input signal has a tonality above a to-<br><br>
nality threshold. In this case, the switch 10b is actuated<br>
to connect the output of the smoothing filter 10a to the<br>
input of the multi-channel reconstructor 12 so that post<br>
processed, but not yet inversely quantized interchannel<br>
differences are supplied to the decoder/multi-channel re-<br>
constructor/up-mixer 12.<br>
When, however, the tonality determination means determines<br>
that a certain frequency band of a actual time portion of<br>
the input signal, i.e., a certain frequency band of an in-<br>
put signal portion to be processed has a tonality lower<br>
than the specified threshold, i.e., is transient, the<br>
switch is actuated such that the smoothing filter 10a is<br>
by-passed.<br>
In the latter case, the signal-adaptive post processing by<br>
the smoothing filter 10a makes sure that the reconstruction<br>
parameter changes for transient signals pass the post proc-<br>
essing stage unmodified and result in fast changes in the<br>
reconstructed output signal with respect to the spatial im-<br>
age, which corresponds to real situations with a high de-<br>
gree of probability for transient signals.<br>
It is to be noted here that the Fig. 3 embodiment, i.e.,<br>
activating post processing on the one hand and fully deac-<br>
tivating post processing on the other hand, i.e., a binary<br>
decision for post processing or not is only a preferred em-<br>
bodiment because of its simple and efficient structure.<br>
Nevertheless, it has to be noted that, in particular with<br>
respect to tonality, this signal characteristic is not only<br>
a qualitative parameter but also a quantative parameter,<br>
which can be normally between 0 and 1. In accordance with<br>
the quantitatively determined parameter, the smoothing de-<br>
gree of a smoothing filter or, for example, the cut-off<br>
frequency of a low pass filter can be set so that, for<br><br>
heavily tonal signals, a heavy smoothing is activated,<br>
while for signals which are not so tonal, the smoothing<br>
with a lower smoothing degree is initiated.<br>
Naturally, one could also detect transient portions and ex-<br>
aggerate the changes in the parameters to values between<br>
predefined quantized values or quantization indices so<br>
that, for heavily transient signals, the post processing<br>
for the reconstruction parameters results in an even more<br>
exaggerated change of the spatial image of a multi-channel<br>
signal. In this case, a quantization step size of 1 as in-<br>
structed by subsequent reconstruction parameters for subse-<br>
quent time portions can be enhanced to for example 1.5,<br>
1.4, 1.3 etc, which results in an even more dramatically<br>
changing spatial image of the reconstructed multi-channel<br>
signal.<br>
It is to be noted here that a tonal signal characteristic,<br>
a transient signal characteristic or other signal charac-<br>
teristics are only examples for signal characteristics,<br>
based on which a signal analysis can be performed to con-<br>
trol a reconstruction parameter post processor. In response<br>
to this control, the reconstruction parameter post proces-<br>
sor determines a post processed reconstruction parameter<br>
having a value which is different from any values for quan-<br>
tization indices on the one hand or requantization values<br>
on the other hand as determined by a predetermined quanti-<br>
zation rule.<br>
It is to be noted here that post processing of reconstruc-<br>
tion parameters dependent on a signal characteristic, i.e.,<br>
a signal-adaptive parameter post processing is only op-<br>
tional. A signal-independent post processing also provides<br>
advantages for many signals. A certain post processing<br>
function could, for example, be selected by the user so<br><br>
that the user gets enhanced changes (in case of an exag-<br>
geration function) or damped changes (in case of a smooth-<br>
ing function). Alternatively, a post processing independent<br>
of any user selection and independent of signal character-<br>
istics can also provide certain advantages with respect to<br>
error resilience. It becomes clear that, especially in case<br>
of a large quantizer step size, a transmission error in a<br>
quantizer index may result in heavily audible artefacts. To<br>
this end, one would perform a forward error correction or<br>
anything like that, when the signal has to be transmitted<br>
over error-prone channels. In accordance with the present<br>
invention, the post processing can obviate the need for any<br>
bit-inefficient error correction codes, since the post<br>
processing of the reconstruction parameters based on recon-<br>
struction parameters in the past will result in a detection<br>
of erroneous transmitted quantized reconstruction parame-<br>
ters and will result in suitable counter measures against<br>
such errors. Additionally, when the post processing func-<br>
tion is a smoothing function, quantized reconstruction pa-<br>
rameters strongly differing from former or later recon-<br>
struction parameters will automatically be manipulated as<br>
will be outlined later.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a preferred embodiment of the reconstruction<br>
parameter post processor 10 from Fig. 1. In particular, the<br>
situation is considered, in which the quantized reconstruc-<br>
tion parameters are encoded. Here, the encoded quantized<br>
reconstruction parameters enter an entropy decoder 10c,<br>
which outputs the sequence of decoded quantized reconstruc-<br>
tion parameters. The reconstruction parameters at the out-<br>
put of the entropy decoder are quantized, which means that<br>
they do not have a certain "useful" value but which means<br>
that they indicate certain quantizer indices or quantizer<br>
levels of a certain quantization rule implemented by a sub-<br>
sequent inverse quantizer. The manipulator lOd can be, for<br><br>
example, a digital filter such as an IIR (preferably) or a<br>
FIR filter having any filter characteristic determined by<br>
the required post processing function. A smoothing or low<br>
pass filtering post-processing function is preferred. At<br>
the output of the manipulator lOd, a sequence of manipu-<br>
lated quantized reconstruction parameters is obtained,<br>
which are not only integer numbers but which are any real<br>
numbers lying within the range determined by the quantiza-<br>
tion rule. Such a manipulated quantized reconstruction pa-<br>
rameter could have values of 1.1, 0.1, 0.5,..., compared to<br>
values 1, 0, 1 before stage lOd. The sequence of values at<br>
the output of block lOd are then input into an enhanced in-<br>
verse quantizer lOe to obtain post-processed reconstruction<br>
parameters, which can be used for multi-channel reconstruc-<br>
tion (e. g. BCC synthesis) in block 12 of Fig. 1.<br>
It has to be noted that the enhanced quantizer lOe is dif-<br>
ferent from a normal inverse quantizer since a normal in-<br>
verse quantizer only maps each quantization input from a<br>
limited number of quantization indices into a specified in-<br>
versely quantized output value. Normal inverse quantizers<br>
cannot map non-integer quantizer indices. The enhanced in-<br>
verse quantizer lOe is therefore implemented to preferably<br>
use the same quantization rule such as a linear or loga-<br>
rithmic quantization law, but it can accept non-integer in-<br>
puts to provide output values which are different from val-<br>
ues obtainable by only using integer inputs.<br>
With respect to the present invention, it basically makes<br>
no difference, whether the manipulation is performed before<br>
requantization (see Fig. 5) or after requantization (see<br>
Fig. 6a, Fig. 6b). In the latter case, the inverse quan-<br>
tizer only has to be a normal straightforward inverse quan-<br>
tizer, which is different from the enhanced inverse quan-<br>
tizer lOe of Fig. 5 as has been outlined above. Naturally,<br><br>
the selection between Fig. 5 and Fig. 6a will be a matter<br>
of choice depending on the certain implementation. For the<br>
present BCC implementation, the Fig. 5 embodiment is pre-<br>
ferred, since it is more compatible with existing BCC algo-<br>
rithms. Nevertheless, this may be different for other ap-<br>
plications .<br>
Fig. 6b shows an embodiment in which the enhanced inverse<br>
quantizer lOe in Fig. 6a is replaced by a straightforward<br>
inverse quantizer and a mapper 10g for mapping in accor-<br>
dance with a linear or preferably non-linear curve. This<br>
mapper can be implemented in hardware or in software such<br>
as a circuit for performing a mathematical operation or as<br>
a look up table. Data manipulation using e.g. the smoother<br>
lOg can be performed before the mapper 10g or after the<br>
mapper lOg or at both places in combination. This embodi-<br>
ment is preferred, when the post processing is performed in<br>
the inverse quantizer domain, since all elements 10f, 10h,<br>
lOg can be implemented using straightforward components<br>
such as circuits of software routines.<br>
Generally, the post processor 10 is implemented as a post<br>
processor as indicated in Fig. 7a, which receives all or a<br>
selection of actual quantized reconstruction parameters,<br>
future reconstruction parameters or past quantized recon-<br>
struction parameters. In the case, in which the post proc-<br>
essor only receives at least one past reconstruction pa-<br>
rameter and the actual reconstruction parameter, the post<br>
processor will act as a low pass filter. When the post<br>
processor 10, however, receives a future quantized recon-<br>
struction parameter, which is not possible in real-time ap-<br>
plications, but which is possible in all other applica-<br>
tions, the post processor can perform an interpolation be-<br>
tween the future and the present or a past quantized recon-<br>
struction parameter to for example smooth a time-course of<br><br>
a reconstruction parameter, for example for a certain fre-<br>
quency band.<br>
As has been outlined above, the data manipulation to over-<br>
come artefacts due to quantization step sizes in a coarse<br>
quantization environment can also be performed on a quan-<br>
tity derived from the reconstruction parameter attached to<br>
the base channel in the parametrically encoded multi chan-<br>
nel signal. When for example the quantized reconstruction<br>
parameter is a difference parameter (ICLD), this parameter<br>
can be inversely quantized without any modification. Then<br>
an absolute level value for an output channel can be de-<br>
rived and the inventive data manipulation is performed on<br>
the absolute value. This procedure also results in the in-<br>
ventive artefact reduction, as long as a data manipulation<br>
in the processing path between the quantized reconstruction<br>
parameter and the actual reconstruction is performed so<br>
that a value of the post processed reconstruction parameter<br>
or the post processed quantity is different from a value<br>
obtainable using requantization in accordance with the<br>
quantization rule, i.e. without manipulation to overcome<br>
the "step size limitation".<br>
Many mapping functions for deriving the eventually manipu-<br>
lated quantity from the quantized reconstruction parameter<br>
are devisable and used in the art, wherein these mapping<br>
functions include functions for uniquely mapping an input<br>
value to an output value in accordance with a mapping rule<br>
to obtain a non post processed quantity, which is then post<br>
processed to obtain the postprocessed quantity used in the<br>
multi channel reconstruction (synthesis) algorithm.<br>
In the following, reference is made to Fig. 8 to illustrate<br>
differences between an enhanced inverse quantizer 10e of<br>
Fig. 5 and a straightforward inverse quantizer 10f in Fig.<br><br>
6a. To this end, the illustration in Fig. 8 shows, as a<br>
horizontal axis, an input value axis for non-quantized val-<br>
ues. The vertical axis illustrates the quantizer levels or<br>
quantizer indices, which are preferably integers having a<br>
value of 0, 1, 2, 3. It has to be noted here that the quan-<br>
tizer in Fig. 8 will not result in any values between 0 and<br>
1 or 1 and 2. Mapping to these quantizer levels is con-<br>
trolled by the stair-shaped function so that values between<br>
-10 and 10 for example are mapped to 0, while values be-<br>
tween 10 and 20 are quantized to 1, etc.<br>
A possible inverse quantizer function is to map a quantizer<br>
level of 0 to an inversely quantized value of 0. A quan-<br>
tizer level of 1 would be mapped to an inversely quantized<br>
value of 10. Analogously, a quantizer level of 2 would be<br>
mapped to an inversely quantized value of 20 for example.<br>
Requantization is, therefore, controlled by an inverse<br>
quantizer function indicated by reference number 31. It is<br>
to be noted that, for a straightforward inverse quantizer,<br>
only the crossing points of line 30 and line 31 are possi-<br>
ble. This means that, for a straightforward inverse quan-<br>
tizer having an inverse quantizer rule of Fig. 8 only val-<br>
ues of 0, 10, 20, 30 can be obtained by requantization.<br>
This is different in the enhanced inverse quantizer 10e,<br>
since the enhanced inverse quantizer receives, as an input,<br>
values between 0 and 1 or 1 and 2 such as value 0.5. The<br>
advanced requantization of value 0.5 obtained by the ma-<br>
nipulator lOd will result in an inversely quantized output<br>
value of 5, i.e., in a post processed reconstruction pa-<br>
rameter which has a value which is different from a value<br>
obtainable by requantization in accordance with the quanti-<br>
zation rule. While the normal quantization rule only allows<br>
values of 0 or 10, the inventive inverse quantizer working<br>
in accordance with the inverse quantizer function 31 re-<br><br>
suits in a different value, i.e., the value of 5 as indi-<br>
cated in Fig. 8.<br>
While the straight-forward inverse quantizer maps integer<br>
quantizer levels to quantized levels only, the enhanced in-<br>
verse quantizer receives non-integer quantizer "levels" to<br>
map these values to "inversely quantized values" between<br>
the values determined by the inverse quantizer rule.<br>
Fig. 9 shows the impact of the inventive post processing<br>
for the Fig. 5 embodiment. Fig. 9a shows a sequence of<br>
quantized reconstruction parameters varying between 0 and<br>
3. Fig. 9b shows a sequence of post processed reconstruc-<br>
tion parameters, which are also termed as "modified quan-<br>
tizer indices", when the wave form in Fig. 9a is input into<br>
a low pass (smoothing) filter. It is to be noted here that<br>
the increases/decreases at time instance 1, 4, 6, 8, 9, and<br>
10 are reduced in the Fig. 9b embodiment. It is to be noted<br>
with emphasis that the peak between time instant 8 and time<br>
instant 9, which might be an artefact is damped by a whole<br>
quantization step. The damping of such extreme values can,<br>
however, be controlled by a degree of post processing in<br>
accordance with a quantitative tonality value as has been<br>
outlined above.<br>
The present invention is advantageous in that the inventive<br>
post processing smoothes fluctuations or smoothes short ex-<br>
treme values. The situation especially arises in a case, in<br>
which signal portions from several input channels having a<br>
similar energy are super-positioned in a frequency band of<br>
a signal, i.e., the base channel or input signal channel.<br>
This frequency band is then, per time portion and depending<br>
on the instant situation mixed to the respective output<br>
channels in a highly fluctuating manner. From the psycho-<br>
acoustic point of view, it would, however, be better to<br><br>
smooth these fluctuations, since these fluctuations do not<br>
contribute substantially to a detection of a location of a<br>
source but affect the subjective listening impression in a<br>
negative manner.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, such audible artefacts are reduced or even<br>
eliminated without incurring any quality losses at a dif-<br>
ferent place in the system or without requiring a higher<br>
resolution/quantization (and, thus, a higher data rate) of<br>
the transmitted reconstruction parameters. The present in-<br>
vention reaches this object by performing a signal-adaptive<br>
modification (smoothing) of the parameters without substan-<br>
tially influencing important spatial localization detection<br>
cues.<br>
The sudden occurring changes in the characteristic of the<br>
reconstructed output signal result in audible artefacts in<br>
particular for audio signals having a highly constant sta-<br>
tionary characteristic. This is the case with tonal sig-<br>
nals. Therefore, it is important to provide a "smoother"<br>
transition between quantized reconstruction parameters for<br>
such signals. This can be obtained for example by smooth-<br>
ing, interpolation, etc.<br>
Additionally, such a parameter value modification can in-<br>
troduce audible distortions for other audio signal types.<br>
This is the case for signals, which include fast fluctua-<br>
tions in their characteristic. Such a characteristic can be<br>
found in the transient part or attack of a percussive in-<br>
strument. In this case, the present invention provides for<br>
a deactivation of parameter smoothing.<br>
This is obtained by post processing the transmitted quan-<br>
tized reconstruction parameters in a signal-adaptive way.<br><br>
The adaptivity can be linear or non-linear. When the adap-<br>
tivity is non-linear, a thresholding procedure as described<br>
in Fig. 3 is performed.<br>
Another criterion for controlling the adaptivity is a de-<br>
termination of the stationarity of a signal characteristic.<br>
A certain form for determining the stationarity of a signal<br>
characteristic is the evaluation of the signal envelope or,<br>
in particular, the tonality of the signal. It is to be<br>
noted here that the tonality can be determined for the<br>
whole frequency range or, preferably, individually for dif-<br>
ferent frequency bands of an audio signal.<br>
The present invention results in a reduction or even elimi-<br>
nation of artefacts, which were, up to now, unavoidable,<br>
without incurring an increase of the required data rate for<br>
transmitting the parameter values.<br>
As has been outlined above with respect to figures 2 and 3,<br>
the preferred embodiment of the present invention performs<br>
a smoothing of interchannel level differences, when the<br>
signal portion under consideration has a tonal characteris-<br>
tic. Interchannel level differences, which are calculated<br>
in an encoder and quantized in an encoder are sent to a de-<br>
coder for experiencing a signal-adaptive smoothing opera-<br>
tion. The adaptive component is a tonality determination in<br>
connection with a threshold determination, which switches<br>
on the filtering of interchannel level differences for to-<br>
nal spectral components, and which switches off such post<br>
processing for noise-like and transient spectral compo-<br>
nents. In this embodiment, no additional side information<br>
of an encoder are required for performing adaptive smooth-<br>
ing algorithms.<br><br>
It is to be noted here that the inventive post processing<br>
can also be used for other concepts of parametric encoding<br>
of multi-channel signals such as for parametric stereo<br>
MP3/AAC, MP3 surround, and similar methods.<br><br>
