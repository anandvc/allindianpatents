				<td>A process for the preparation of N,N'-bis(2-hydroxybenzyl)ethylenediamine-N,N'-<br>
diacetic acid and its derivatives<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of N,N'-bis(2-<br>
hydroxybenzyl)ethylenediamine-N,N'-diacetic acid and its derivatives substituted in<br>
phenyl ring, as well as their salts.<br>
N,N'-Bis(2-hydroxybenzyl)ethylenediamine-N,N'-diacetic acid, also known under the<br>
name HBED, and its derivatives substituted in para position with respect to phenolic<br>
hydroxy group arc well known for their ability to chelate III and IV groups of metal<br>
ions in aqueous solutions. They can be used as chelating agents for micronutrients in<br>
fertilizer preparations for plants, such as iron, zinc, copper or manganese<br>
micronutrients. Therefore a need exists of its industrial production in large scale.<br>
One of known methods of the preparation of HBED is described in US 3.632,637 and<br>
comprises reaction of disodium N.N'-ethylenediaminediacetate with o-acetoxybenzyl<br>
bromide or chloride and then alkaline hydrolysis to remove acetoxy protecting group.<br>
The preparation of o-acetoxybenzyl bromide is complex and requires two reaction steps:<br>
reaction of o-hydroxybenzyl alcohol with acetic anhydride to form o-acetoxybenzyl<br>
acetate and then bromination with HBr. Furthermore, as later reported by Martell et al<br>
in Can. J. Chem., vol. 63(3), 449-456, 1986, that procedure suffered from the formation<br>
of a resinous polymeric by-product, which seemed to be promoted by treatment with<br>
acid or base and sometimes formed spontaneously during recrystallization of the<br>
material. Another disadvantage of this method is that disodium N,N'-ethylenediamine-<br>
diacetate is not easy available and must be prepared in the reaction of<br>
carboxymethylation of ethylenediamine which involves the use of cyanides (NaCN) and<br>
CH20.<br>
Martell et al in Can. J. Chem.. vol. 63(3), 449-456, 1986 reports two approaches for the<br>
synthesis of HBED and derivatives. The first approach, which is suitable for synthesis<br>
of HBED, involves conversion of N,N'-bis(2-hydroxybenzyl)ethylenediamine to the<br>
amide via reaction with formaldehyde and HCN followed by hydrolysis. A<br>
disadvantage of this approach is the use of HCN and difficulty of hydrolyzing diamide,<br>
which requires the use of very pH sensitive metal catalysis. The second approach, which<br>
is suitable for synthesis of HBED derivatives substituted para to the phenolic hydroxy<br>
group, involves reaction of N,N'-ethylenediaminediacetic acid with para substituted<br>
phenols and formaldehyde and was found to be very sensitive to pH. Another<br>
disadvantage of this second approach is also the necessity of the synthesis of the starting<br>
N,N' -ethylenediaminediacetic acid.<br>
Another synthetic approach for the preparation of HBED is described in WO01/46114<br>
and comprises reaction of N,N'-bis(2-hydroxybenzyl)ethylenediamine with tert-butyl<br>
haloacetate and then hydrolysis of resulting N,N'-bis(2-hydroxybenzyl)ethylene-<br>
diamine-N,N'-diacetic acid di-tert-butyl ester with a weak acid, such as formic acid.<br>
The method was specifically designed to obtain neat HBED, which then could be easy<br>
converted into target mono-cationic salt while avoiding intermediate dihydrochloride<br>
formation and its neutralization into sodium chloride. However, the reaction of N,N'-<br>
bis(2-hydroxybenzyl)ethylenediamine acid with t-butyl bromoacetate is performed in<br>
DMSO solvent and takes a very long time. Hydrolysis with formic acid is also very time<br>
consuming and takes 5 days, the yield of hydrolysis being very low. Furthermore, t-<br>
butyl bromoacetate is expensive and not easy available on the industrial scale.<br>
A synthetic approach for the preparation of HBED derivatives substituted in position<br>
para with respect to the phenolic OH group is known from US 2,967.196 and<br>
US 3.038,793 and comprises reacting formaldehyde with disodium N,N'-ethylene-<br>
diaminediacetate to form the dimethylol derivative which can condense in the position<br>
ortho to the phenolic OH group with para substituted phenols. A disadvantage of this<br>
method is that disodium N,N'-ethylenediaminediacetate must be prepared first in the<br>
reaction of carboxymethylation of ethylenediamine which involves the use of NaCN<br>
and CH2O. This approach fails when applied to the preparation of HBED because of by-<br>
products formation due to the possibility of the reaction of methylolol group with<br>
phenol in positions both para and ortho to the phenolic OH group and formation of a<br>
complex mixture of compounds.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a synthetic process, which applicable<br>
both for HBED itself and its derivatives substituted in para position with respect to<br>
phenolic OH group and which could be carried out in the same reaction system and<br>
under similar conditions both in the case of HBED and its derivatives.<br>
It is also the object of the present invention to provide a synthetic process having small<br>
number of steps and employing reagents which are either easy available or easy to<br>
synthesize on a large scale, as well as standard and simple industrial operations and<br>
equipment. It is also the object of the invention to eliminate the need of using toxic<br>
cyanides.<br>
In accordance with the invention there is provided a process for the preparation of N,N'-<br>
bis(2-hydroxybenzyl)ethylenediamine-N.N'-diacctic acid and its derivatives of general<br>
formula I:<br><br>
wherein:<br>
both R have the same meaning and are selected from H. C1-C4alkyl, CH2OH, SO3M,<br>
and COOM; and<br>
all M have the same meaning and represent hydrogen atom. Na, K or NH4:<br>
which comprises:<br>
- reductive animation of glyoxylic acid with a salan compound of formula (II)<br><br>
wherein R have the same meaning as defined above for formula (I), in the presence of<br>
an amine proton acceptor, to obtain the compound of formula (I), wherein M are<br>
hydrogen atoms, and<br>
- if desired, converting it further into compound of formula (I) wherein M represent Na,<br>
K or NH4 by the treatment with a corresponding base.<br>
The term C1-C4alkyl group in the above formulas encompasses both straight (linear) or<br>
branched C1-C4alkyl group, such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, sec-<br>
butyl, tert-butyl.<br>
The most preferred compounds prepared by the process of the invention are compounds<br>
of formula (I) wherein R are hydrogen atoms or methyl groups.<br>
The molar ratio salan compound:glyoxylic acid:amine is in the range from 1:2:2 to<br>
1:4:5, preferably 1:3:3.5.<br>
Any excess of reagents used in the reductive amination in the process of the invention<br>
can be easily recovered from the reaction medium after the reaction and used in a next<br>
batch of the reductive amination. The only inorganic by-product in the process is a salt,<br>
contrary to the processes known from the prior art.<br>
Reductive amination can be preferably carried out by catalytic hydrogenation (reaction<br>
with hydrogen) in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst.<br>
For the catalytic hydrogenation the starting salan compound of formula (I)) can be<br>
dissolved in a polar solvent, preferably selected from C1-C3 alkanol or their mixtures or<br>
in a C1-C3 alkanol/water mixture containing 30 to 60% of the alkanol. Preferred solvent<br>
can be methanol, ethanol in a mixture with water and methanol, such as industrial<br>
methylated spirit. Then the solution of glyoxylic acid and amine in the same solvent is<br>
introduced to the solution of the salan compound. The molar ratio of glyoxylic acid to<br>
amine is about 1:1 or an excess of amine can be used.<br>
Reductive amination can be also carried out in an aqueous-amine proton acceptor<br>
medium. In such a case the reaction is performed in a heterogeneous medium, where the<br>
mixture of glyoxylic acid and amine is dissolved in the aqueous phase and the salan<br>
compound and the catalyst remain undissolved.<br>
The hydrogenation catalyst can be selected from conventional catalysts which include,<br>
without limitation, catalysts based on noble or transition metals such as palladium,<br>
platinum, rhodium, nickel, osmium and ruthenium. These catalysts can be used in a<br>
form bound to a support, carbon or charcoal being the supports most commonly used.<br>
The most preferred are Raney nickel (Ra-Ni) and palladium or platinum on a charcoal<br>
(Pd/C, Pt/C). Hydrogenation is carried out by mixing reagents in a solvent in the<br>
atmosphere of hydrogen gas. The choice of a solvent, temperature of the reaction and<br>
the hydrogen pressure depends on a specific catalyst employed. Hydrogenation can be<br>
carried out under low hydrogen pressure of about 1 to 4 arm and relatively low<br>
temperature (typically when noble metals catalysts, such as platinum, are used) or<br>
under low- or medium pressure such as 30 to 50 atm (when Ra-Ni or Rh/C are used).<br>
Preferred catalysts are Pd/C or Ra-Ni, preferably in the amount of 1 to 5% by weight<br>
with respect to the starting salan compound.<br>
Hydrogenation can be carried out at 30 to 70°C, preferably at about 50°C, until the<br>
hydrogen absorption ceases. The time of the reaction is usually 4 to 48 hrs.<br>
Glyoxylic acid can be used in any convenient and commercially available form,<br>
preferably as free acid or its hydrate, like monohydrate, or their mixtures. It can be also<br>
used as its salt, such as sodium salt hydrate, like monohydrate. Preferably, glyoxylic<br>
acid monohydrate is used when reductive amination is carried out in alcoholic medium.<br>
Aqueous 50% solution is used preferably when the reaction is carried out in water.<br>
When the reaction is carried out in an alcoholic solvent, glyoxylic acid can also be<br>
present at least in part in a form of its acetal or hemiacetal. The use of glyoxylic acid<br>
ester is also contemplated by the invention. By "glyoxylic acid" any form thereof as<br>
described above or their mixtures are understood in accordance with the invention.<br>
The amine proton acceptor can be any amine compound capable of binding proton in a<br>
reaction media, most preferably simple tertiary amine such as triethylamine or<br>
tributylamine. Amine serves also as a blocking agent for carboxylic group in glyoxylic<br>
acid.<br>
The compound of formula (I) wherein M are H is isolated in a form of a free acid or its<br>
monohydrochloride after separation of the hydrogenation catalyst by pressure filtration<br>
and subsequent evaporation of a solvent from the filtrate. The product in a<br>
monohydrochloride form can be crystallized from water after acidification to pH = 1.5<br>
to 2.5 with hydrochloric acid. Conversion of the compound of formula (I) wherein M<br>
are H into its salt, i.e. the compound of formula (I) wherein M represent Na, K or NH4<br>
is carried out by the treatment with a corresponding base to pH 10 - 12.5, preferably<br>
11.5. Such corresponding bases are preferably sodium, potassium or ammonium<br>
hydroxides. After alkalization, 10 to 35% (by weight) aqueous solutions of the<br>
compound of formula (I) with M being Na, K or NH4 are obtained, preferably 20% by<br>
weight.<br>
The starting salan compounds of formula (II) can be prepared in two ways.<br>
According to one approach, the starting salan compound of formula (II) can be prepared<br>
by condensation of ethylenediamine with 2 molar equivalents of salicylaldehyde or a<br>
corresponding salicylaldehyde derivative substituted with R substituent in position para<br>
with respect to hydroxy group and then reduction of thus obtained salen compound<br>
(Schiff's base). According to the second approach, the starting salan compound of<br>
formula (II) can be prepared by reaction of ethylenediamine, a formaldehyde source and<br>
phenol or phenol substituted with R substituent in para position (direct Mannich<br>
condensation). The second approach is applicable most preferably when R is<br>
C1-C4alkyl.<br>
Therefore, in one variant of the invention, the process for the preparation of the<br>
compound of formula (I) wherein R are as described above comprises preparing salan<br>
compound of formula (II) by reaction of ethylenediamine with 2 molar equivalents of a<br>
compound of formula (IV)<br><br>
wherein R are as described for formula (I) above to obtain a corresponding compound<br>
of formula (V) wherein R are as described for formula (I)<br><br>
and then reduction of the compound of formula (V) to obtain the compound of formula<br>
(II).<br>
Compounds of formula (IV), i.e. salicylaldehyde and its derivatives substituted with R<br>
substituent in position para with respect to hydroxy group, are well known and easy<br>
commercially available materials.<br>
Reaction of ethylenediamine with the compound of formula (IV) can be carried out in a<br>
known manner in a suitable solvent, such as lower alcohols or their mixtures at an<br>
ambient temperature.<br>
Reduction of the compound of formula (V) to obtain the compound of formula (II) can<br>
be generally carried out using any known reduction methods known in the art. One of<br>
such methods is the reduction with complex alkali metals hydrides, such as<br>
borohydrides, preferably sodium borohydride and lithium aluminium hydride. Preferred<br>
method of reduction is catalytic hydrogenation using the methods an catalysts as<br>
described above for the reaction of reductive amination of glyoxylic acid.<br>
Most preferably, the reduction of the compound of formula (V) can be carried out by<br>
catalytic hydrogenation using hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst, such as palladium<br>
or nickel catalyst, like Pd/C or Ra-Ni. When the reduction is carried out by catalytic<br>
hydrogenation, intermediate compound of formula (II) without its isolation from the<br>
reaction medium can be directly reacted further with glyoxylic acid in the reductive<br>
amination in the same hydrogenation environment.<br>
The yields of both the reaction of ethylenediamine with the compound of formula (IV)<br>
and the reduction of the intermediate compound of formula (V) are in principle<br>
quantitative. A further advantage is that reduction of the intermediate compound of<br>
formula (V) to form the compound of formula (II) and subsequent reductive amination<br>
of glyoxylic acid with the compound of formula (II) can be carried out under the same<br>
conditions and in the same equipment and using the same operations, which simplifies<br>
the whole process and lowers its costs.<br>
An embodiment of the invention is therefore a process for the preparation of the<br>
compound of formula (I) wherein R are as described above, which comprises:<br>
a) reaction of ethylenediamine with 2 molar equivalents of a compound of formula (IV)<br><br>
wherein R are as described for formula (T) above,<br>
to obtain a corresponding compound of formula (V) wherein R are as described for<br>
formula (I)<br><br>
b) reduction of the compound of formula (V) to obtain the compound of formula (II)<br>
wherein R are as described above:<br>
c) reductive amination of glyoxylic acid with a salan compound of general formula (II)<br><br>
wherein R have the same meaning as defined above for formula (I), in the presence of<br>
an amine proton acceptor, to obtain the compound of formula (I), wherein M are<br>
hydrogen atoms, and<br>
d) if desired, further converting the compound of formula (I) wherein M are hydrogen<br>
atoms into compound of formula (I) wherein M represent Na, K or NH4 by the<br>
treatment with a corresponding base.<br>
Preferably, in the above embodiment the reduction in step b) and the reductive<br>
amination in step c) are earned out in the same reaction vessel, without isolation of the<br>
intermediate compound of the formula (V).<br>
Also preferably, all steps a) to c) can be carried out in the same reaction vessel, without<br>
isolation of intermediate compounds of the formula (IV) and (V).<br>
Also preferably, both the reduction in step b) and the reductive amination in step c) are<br>
carried out by hydrogenation with hydrogen in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst<br>
in a C1-C3 alkanol or their mixtures or in a C1-C3 alkanol/water mixture. Preferred<br>
hydrogenation catalysts are Ra-Ni and Pd/C.<br>
In a second variant of the invention, a process for the preparation of a compound of<br>
formula (I) wherein R is C1-C4alkyl comprises preparing a starting salan compound of<br>
formula (II) wherein R is C1-C4alkyl by reaction of ethylenediamine, a formaldehyde<br>
source and a phenol compound of formula (III)<br><br>
wherein R is C1-C4alkyl. at a molar ratio ethylenediamine:formaldehyde:phenol<br>
compound about 1:2:2.<br>
An embodiment of the invention is therefore a process for the preparation of N.N'-<br>
bis(2-hydroxybenzyl)ethylenediamine-N.N'-diacetic acid and its derivatives of general<br>
formula I:<br><br>
wherein:<br>
both R have the same meaning and arc selected from C1-C4alkyl; and<br>
all M have the same meaning and represent hydrogen atom, Na, K or NH4;<br>
which comprises:<br>
a) reaction of ethylenediamine, a formaldehyde source and the phenolic compound of<br>
formula (111)<br><br>
wherein R is C1-C4alkyl, in a molar ratio ethylenediamine: formaldehyde: phenol<br>
compound of formula (III) of about 1:2:2, to obtain the salan compound of general<br>
formula (II)<br><br>
wherein R have the same meaning as defined for formula (I), and<br>
b) reductive animation of glyoxylic acid with the salan compound of the formula (II) in<br>
the presence of an amine proton acceptor, to obtain the compound of formula (I),<br>
wherein M are hydrogen atoms, and<br>
c) if desired, converting it further into compound of formula (I), wherein M represent<br>
Na, K or NH4 by the treatment with a corresponding base.<br>
Phenol compounds of formula (III) arc known and commercially available.<br>
The formaldehyde source can be any conventional and commercially available<br>
formaldehyde source such as an aqueous formaldehyde solution, paraformaldehyde,<br>
trioxane or hexamethylenetctraamine HMTP (urotropine). Preferred formaldehyde<br>
source is the aqueous 35-40% formaldehyde solution, usually sold as a saturated<br>
aqueous solution with formaldehyde concentration of about 37%, stabilized with 10-<br>
15 % methanol (formalin or formol).<br>
Most preferred formaldehyde sources are 37% aqueous formaldehyde solution and<br>
paraformaldehyde.<br>
The reaction of ethylenediamine, the formaldehyde source and the phenol compound of<br>
formula (III) (direct Mannich condensation) can be earned out in a water-alcoholic<br>
mixture at reflux temperature, The product of formula (II) can be separated from the<br>
reaction mixture as its hydrochloride or by evaporation of a solvent. The yield of the<br>
Mannich condensation is 80 to 95%.<br>
The Examples which follow illustrate the invention without any intention to limit its<br>
scope to the embodiments shown in these Examples.<br>
Example 1<br>
General method of the preparation of compounds of formula (I) where R is C1-C4alkyl,<br>
using salan compounds prepared by direct Mannich condensation<br>
To a 250 ml flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer and reflux condenser 100 ml of a<br>
solvent and 0.1 mol of ethylenediamine are introduced to obtain a solution. To the<br>
solution 0.2 mol of paraformaldehyde 37% formaldehyde aqueous solution and 0.2 to<br>
0.4 ml of 37% hydrochloric acid are added portionwise. The mixture obtained is heated<br>
for 0.5 h at 50-60°C until complete homogeneity and then 50% solution of the phenol<br>
compound of formula (III) in the same solvent is added at the rate of 0.1 mol/h. The<br>
reaction mixture is heated at reflux for 4 to 30 h.<br>
Salan compound of formula (II) thus obtained can be separated by crystallization:<br>
- in a form of a salan monohydrochloride after acidification of the reaction<br>
mixture to pH 0.5-2.0 with concentrated hydrochloric acid, or<br>
- in a form of a salan after evaporation of the solvent and crystallization from<br>
ethyl ether at 5 to 10°C.<br>
Reductive amination can be performed in a closed reaction medium, such as heated<br>
autoclave equipped with a mechanical stirrer. Salan compound and the mixture<br>
containing glyoxylic acid, an amine and a solvent are introduced to the autoclave. After<br>
completing the addition of the total amount of salan compound the reaction mixture<br>
contains reactants salamglyoxylic acid:amine at the molar ratio in the range from 1:2:2<br>
to 1:4:5. The total concentration of reactants in the reaction mixture is in the range 2 to<br>
10% by weight.<br>
Then to the reaction mixture a catalyst is added, which is preferably Ni-Raney or Pd/C<br>
in the amount of 1 to 5% by weight with respect to the salan compound.<br>
The air is removed from the reaction system using the flow of an inert gas, preferably<br>
argon, and the autoclave is pressurized with hydrogen gas.<br>
Reductive amination is carried out for 4 to 48 h at the hydrogen pressure of 2 to 50 atm.<br>
The product is isolated by filtration of the catalyst, evaporation of the solvent and<br>
crystallization of the product from water after acidifying the to the pH 1.5 to 2.5.<br>
The overall yield after crystallization is in the range from 30 to 85%. depending on the<br>
type of the phenol compound of formula (III) used in the reaction. Structures of the<br>
products are confirmed by means of 1H NMR analysis and their purities by means of<br>
HPLC and elemental analysis.<br>
Example 2<br>
N,N'-Bis(2-hydroxy-5-methylbenzyl)ethylenediamine-N,N'-diacetic acid,<br>
monohydrochloride trihydrate<br>
2.1. N,N'-bis(2-hydroxy-5-methylbenzyl)ethylenediamine (salan compound)<br>
Following the general procedure described in Example 1 ethylenediamine (6.0 g, 0.1<br>
mo I). 37% formaldehyde aqueous solution (14.9 ml. 0.2 mol), p-cresol (21.6 g. 0.2 mol)<br>
and ethanol (150 ml) as a solvent were introduced to the reaction system to form a<br>
homogenous reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was heated at 60oC for 12 h. The<br>

condenser 100 ml of a solvent and 0.1 mol of ethylenediamine is introduced to obtain a<br>
solution. To the solution 0.2 mol of salicylaldehyde or its derivative of the formula (IV)<br>
are added portionwise. The mixture obtained is heated for 1 h at 50-60oC. As the<br>
reaction progresses a salen compound produced precipitates in a form of a fine<br>
crystalline solid.<br>

When the reaction is completed, the mixture containing the salen compound is<br>
transferred to a heated autoclave with a mechanical stirrer and hydrogenation catalyst is<br>
added in the amount of 1 to 5% by weight with respect to the salen compound. The air<br>
is removed from the reaction system by passing inert gas flow (preferably argon), the<br>
autoclave is pressurized with hydrogen gas and the hydrogenation is then carried out at<br>
40-60oC at the hydrogen pressure 2 to 20 atm for 4 to 25 h until the absorption of<br>
hydrogen in the system ceases.<br>
C. Reductive amination with glyoxylic acid<br>

acid:amine in the range from 1:2:2 to 1:4:5. The total concentration of reactants in the<br>
reaction mixture is in the range 2 to 20% by weight.<br>
Then to the reaction mixture a heterogeneous catalyst is added, preferably Ni-Raney or<br>
Pd/C in the amount of 1 to 5% by weight with respect to the salan compound.<br>
The air is removed from the reaction system by venting and passing over inert gas flow<br>
(preferably argon). Reductive amination is carried out for 4 to 48 h at the hydrogen<br>
pressure of 2 to 50 atm.<br>
The product is isolated by filtration of the catalyst, evaporation of the solvent and<br>
crystallization of the product from water after acidifying to the pH 1.5 to 2.5.<br>
