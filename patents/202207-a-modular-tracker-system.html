The commercial transportation industry management and monitoring of vehicle mileage, driver"s log the driving route and tracking of current position of the vehicle of multiple numbers of vehicles for cost effective fleet management .it is mandatory to submit reports regarding total miles driven in a state, drivers" time, field added in a state drivers hours of service etc.. Generally this information is inaccurate due to the tracking method or employed in collecting relevant information that leads to the wrong calculation of taxes and loss of revenue. Commercial Transportation industry need to enter this data manually for the above said purpose which is time consuming and prone to manual errors.<br>
Various systems have been developed for this purpose. Some systems have GPS and a telecommunication module with no memory card interface provision. The telecommunication module employed in one current system transmits data via satellite to a base station computer.  teems are costlier in nature and do not have provision for retrieval of information offline. Some systems employ only a memory card of lower capacity without a communication module. This defeats the purpose of tracking the vehicle online.<br>
This invention was made based on the requirement of low cost alternatives for cost effective fleet management and to comply with tiie Federal tax return law.<br>
This invention is aimed at developing a system, which would act as an automated mileage and route data collection device besides its various other functions. The feasibility of such a system has been studied in detail, under "Automated mileage and Stateline Crossing Operational Test (AMACOT)", jointly by the US Department of Transportation, Federal highway Administration and Center for transportation Research and Education and published in their final report dated May 1,1996.<br>
This invention also aims at developing a system that will log and maintain and generate all reports as required by the international Fuel Tax Agreement (IFTA) as in the IFTA Procedures Manual.<br>
This invention also aims at developing a system, which satisfy the Federal Motor Carrick Safety Administration (FMCSA) Regulation of being a Automatic on board recording device, as per Regulation" Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations -Regulation $ 395.15 Automatic on board recording devices".<br><br>
This invention also aims at developing a system, which would log and store data pertaining to driver information as required by FMCSA.<br>
According the invention has the following documents as few of its input references:<br>
1.	"Automated Mileage and Stateline Crossing Operational Test": Final Report published by the US Department of Transportation, dated May 1,1996.<br>
2.	IFTA Procedures Manual, effective July 1,1998.<br>
3.	"Part 395" ofPederal Motors Carrier Safety Regulations.<br>
This invention also aims at developing a sj^tem, whose functionality is not restricted to the commercial transportation industry but which can be used for other possible applications including Sea vessels, trains and even by a treklcCT on the move. Hence the design is based on a modiilar hardware system and customized software support, which would make the device suitable for different applications with minimal hardware changes.<br>
Brief Summary of the Invention<br>
This is an invention of a system (Modular Hardware and Customized Software) called MAK WORLD TRACKER. This invention relates to a system for tracking and logging online real time information pertaining to any moving object. Information herein refers to the global location, speed, miles, direction, fiiel purchase and other parameters of the object depending on the appUcation.<br>
The information is collected from three basic sources<br>
1)	GPS receiver<br>
2)	Vehicle odo sensor<br>
3)	From driver for ftiel purchase details. This information is collected on each sampling interval (e.g.5 min) and stored in the built in memory. This information is copied to a memory card at the end of the trip or transmitted through the communication module at real time. Both the options are also available in a single module.<br>
When the memory card is used, this serves as a backup memory storage system for the communication module where the commimication network is not supported and also plays as the Driver"s time card. Each driver will be provided a memory card with all the driver information programmed in to the card. The system can accept memory cards of variable sizes to hold driver"s trip data from one week to one mon^. As such the system has the built - in memory for storage up to one-month period. At the end of the trip the memory card will be handed over to the administrators at the terminal where the formatted raw data is down loaded in to the computer though a memory card reader writer. This system uses Cardlogix C 152 memory card reader writer.<br>
The customer has the option to buy the report generating software and load it in to his computer, which reads the raw data and updates its database and generates various reports. Otherwise the raw data is sent to a website hoisted by the data base administrator who handles the data and provides reports for the customer on request. This is automatically done by appropriate software installed in the website.<br><br>
With the communication module present in the system, the unit can transmit the information in real-time. The unique feature of this unit is the information is directly routed to the specified Internet website. Once the data reaches the website the raw data is processed by the Fleet management software automatically and stored in a database. Provisions can be made to process this raw data either manually by the customer fi-om his place or automatically with the web- installed software. Customer himself or supplier or a third party data base administrator can hoist this website. Provisions can be made to view the reports securely with appropriate access codes for the drivers. Management and Government authorities. The communication module can be any of the following based on the requirement; two way Pager / GSM or cellular / satellite communication modules. Each one has its own plus and minus points and based on the application requirement the modules are selected. When the vehicle is out of range of tfie communication network the data is stored in the memory and once it comes in to the coverage zone the data is transmitted to the website so that no data is lost. The system is so designed so that it adopts any module with minimum hardware changes. The only change required would be the software embedded in to the micro controller board. The micro controller board is based on Motorola MMC 2107 M core 32 - bit controller with built in flash memory. The reports generating using the data transmitted to the website are described as follows.<br>
The following example is specific for trucking industry.<br>
The report generated can be categorized into three groups as follows.<br>
1.	Management Reports<br>
2.	Drivers Log Reports<br>
3.	Paging ftmction.<br>
Various report generated by these groups are listed below. 1.        Management Repots<br>

5.	Timecard.<br>
3.        Package function<br>
1.	Send the record periodically<br>
2.	Send message on request<br>
Automated state - wise mileage detection for Fuel tax generation:<br>
Two basic methods are employed for this purpose.<br>
The unit is programmed to store or transmit the information collected on every periodic interval (eg.5 minutes). The logged data collected in the web site is further processed and the felt management software detects the state-line border crossing and generates the appropriate report. The accuracy of this approach will be approximately 5 miles and this can be shortened by short storage interval at the cost of more memory space.<br>
Second method employs the state-line border crossing detections in the hardware unit itself The system stores the database of position data for all the state-line borders and a software algorithm checks this database each time a new coordinate is received and the moment the crossing is detected all the information including position and miles are stored or transmitted. The accuracy of this approach is few hundred meters. This method employs a memory module in the micro controller board.<br>
In both the cases the BFTA fuel tax reports can be generated. Customer can choose any of the options provided.<br><br>
