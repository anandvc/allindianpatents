This invention relates to a feedroller sensing mechanism for sensing and controlling the feed batt of lap or loose fibers in a carding machine in order to achieve lesser sliver coeficient of variation.<br>
In a carding machine the output sliver quality depends on the uniformity in weight per unit length of the feed material in the form of lap or loose fibers. Nomially in any carding machine the feed materiaL whether in lap form or loose fibers, is bound to have variations in weight per unit length, both in length wise and width wise. Since there is a huge draft between feed and delivery, a small variation in feed is multiplied heavily on the delivery, sliver. Hence controlling the feed weight per unit length is very important for the output sliver quality.<br>
At present the feed material is controlled by means of a sensing and controlling the speed of feed roller. Here the sensors are fitted at both ends of the feed roller and the feed roller is allowed to move up and down, against a predetermined spring load. This movement depends on the variation in feed weight in length wise. The sensing and corrections are carried out in a single roller only. The width wise variations are not taken into consideration.<br>
Sliver coeficient of variation (CV%) is a statistical term which indicates the magnitude of variations in sliver weight per unit length. Number of samples are 20 and the cut length is 5m. Weight is measured in gms. Lesser sliver CV% reduce the yarn count variations. Consequently, stripiness is eliminated in woven and knitted fabrics.<br><br>
The feed roller, placed along the machine width, adjacent to the licker  in, is driven by a motor through chains. The motor speed is varied bv an inverter servo drive through an electronic control device which is getting signals from sensing means and averaging it, to feed a uniform weight per unit length material to the lickerin. Bearing housings are fitted at both end shafts of the feed roller and the housings are supported in two end brackets. Needle bearings may be used for smooth, continuous rotation. The brackets are rigidly fixed over the feed plate. A coating may be given on the feed roller surface to avoid lap licking. The feed roller is loaded with springs at both ends.<br>
The invention provides an apparatus for sensing thickness variation of feed in a carding machine comprising a sensing roller supported on two end brackets rigidly fixed to a support lirame and located along the width of a carding machine, close to the feed roller of the carding machine, the said sensing roller being driven at the same speed of the feed roller, the said support frame housing plurality of sensing plates each said sensing plate having a middle stud passing through a linear bearing and a bottom stud passing through a spring and a sensing means is provided to sense the variation in the thickness of the feed batt along the width of the carding machine.<br>
A prefered sensing means is an inductive proximity swatch which provides signal in response to the movement of the bottom stud of the sensing plate which corresponds to the thickness variation in the feed batt.<br><br>
Another prefered sensing means is a load cell which provides signal in response to the movement of the bottom stud of the sensing palte which corresponds to the thickness variations in the feed batt.<br>
Since the apparatus according to the invention uses plurality of sensing plates and sensors, located at intervals along the length of the feed roller, the measure of the average thickness variation obtained from the plurality of sensors provides a more accurate measure of the thickness variation of the feed batt. The signal corresponding to the average measure of the thickness variation is used to controll the feed roller drive to obtain a fibre batt of uniform thickness.<br>
The feed plate preferably is a solid iron component having a curved profile at the top side. The feed plate top surface preferably has a special finish and coatings for wear resistance and to avoid lap licking. Feed roller end brackets are mounted over the feed plate. The position of the feed roller is ensured by two locating pins and fasteners. Feed plate is placed across the width of the machine and mounted over the main frame. The gap between the feed plate and feed roller is maintained by spring. When the feed material is fed between the feed plate and feed rollers, the roller gets loaded by means of the spring. The material fed to the licker jn from feed plate and feed roller is under the grip due to the spring load.<br>
The apparatus according to the invention sense the feed thickness variation which corresponds to the weight variations in both length wise and width wise. It can provide accurate control of the feed to achieve a uniform weight per unit length of textile material feed to card licker in.<br><br>
The apparatus according to the invention will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings :<br>
Figure 1  shows the apparatus according to the invention.<br>
Figure 2A shows a prefered embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention.<br>
Figure 2B  shows another prefered embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention.<br>
Figure 3 shows the top view of the sensing plates housed in the support frame.<br>
Plurality of sensing plates (2) are located under a sensing roller (1) located parallel to the feed roller (3) and close to the feed roller. For carding the feed material is fed to the licker in (5) through the feed roller (3). The uniformity of the feed material is ensured by controlling the drive of the feed roller in accordance with the variation in the thickness sensed by the sensing plates (2). Each sensing plate (2) is provided with a middle stud (2a) passing through a linear bearing (10) and a bottom stud (2b) passing through a spring (11). A sensing means (12, 13) is provided with each sensing plate (2) for sensing the thickness of the feed batt between each sensing plate (2) and the sensing roller (1). The sensing roller (1) is driven at the same speed as the feed roller (3). Plurality of sensing plates (2) are housed in a support frame (8). The spring loaded bottom stud (2b) of the sensing plate<br><br>
(2) allow the sensing plate to move vertically below the sensing roller (1) in accordance with the variation in the thickness of the feed batt in the form of a lap or loose fibres passing between the sensing roller (1) and sensing plates (2). The sensing means (12, 13) convert the movement of the sensing plates (2) to electric signals which are fed to a control device. The signals are averaged in the control device and the speed of the feed roller (3) is continuously controlled to obtain uniform weight per unit length of the feed material from the feed roller (3). The sensing roller (1) is fixed along the width of the carding machine, supported in two end brackets (6) fixed to the edges of the support frame (8) and rotated at the same speed as that of the feed roller (3). The sensing roller (1) is located close to the feed roller (3) and the sensing plate (2) is located close to feed plate (4). The middle stud (2a) of the sensing plate is supported by the sensing plate support (8) and attached to the frame preferably through a linear roller bearing (10), allowing free vertical motion of the sensing plate (2). The sensing plate bottom stud 2(b) is spring loaded by means of the spring (11). For sensing the vertical motion of the bottom stud (2b), sensors such as a proximity switch (12) or a load cell (13) are provided. The signal from the sensors attached to the plurality of sensing plates (2) are integrated and is used to control the drive of the feed roller in order to get uniform weight per length of the fibre batt fed to the licker_in (5).<br>
Preferably the surface of the sensing roller (1) is coated with a suitable coating to avoid lap licking. The sensing roller surface may have a knurled profile, a saw tooth clothing mounted on a plain roller or diamond patterns depending upon the textile materials processed.<br><br><br><br>
