				<td>SANTTIZABLE FLOAT VALVE<br>
The present invention concerns a float valve, the tolerances of a slide of said valve<br>
allowing liquid to discharge between the valve chamber and the slide in order to flush the<br>
surfaces thereof.<br>
There are numerous different float valves known in the art. Their most essential field of<br>
application are mechanical level indicators. The operation of a float valve is regulated bv<br>
a float, as indicated by its name. The float is in general a swimmer located outside the<br>
valve and usually connected to the valve by means of a lever arm. The float swims in the<br>
liquid tank on the liquid surface, whereby the amount of the liquid controls the operation<br>
of the float valve in a desired way opening and closing the valve when necessary<br>
GB 595 100 discloses a float-actuated valve, in which the valve is positively actuated<br>
both when opening and closing. This valve overcomes the defect of seizing of the valve<br>
in its housing by particles of grit which become lodged around the valve by means of the<br>
stream of water or other liquid that constantly passes the valve itself to wash away any<br>
particles which might become lodged around it. The present invention provides a better<br>
alternative solution.<br>
According to the present invention, a sanitizable version of a float valve is provided in<br>
order to keep the valve and its surfaces clean. This is especially important in an<br>
environment, where the purity of the liquid flowing through the valve is essential.<br>
In a valve in accordance with the present invention, the sanitizability of the float valve is<br>
provided by locating the opening and closing element of the valve into the valve chamber<br>
so that an allowance is left between the valve chamber and the closing element, allowing<br>
a part of the liquid that flows through the valve to discharge through the allowance<br>
between the closing element and the valve chamber when the valve is open, thus flushing<br>
these surfaces. An example of this kind of a valve is for example a valve regulating the<br><br>
intake of the filling water of a cleansing circulation to be used for disinfection. The valve<br>
is thereby controlled by the water amount of the circulation, which is effected by the<br>
impurities to be removed and the clean water to be taken into use. The water flushing the<br>
valve flows to the water tank of the circulation, in other words, to the same place as the<br>
water that flows through the valve when the valve is open. In addition, the valve can in<br>
this kind of a use be sterilized, when necessary, with hot waLer and/or steam.<br>
By means of a valve operation described above, the agglomeration of impurities can be<br>
prevented onto surfaces between the valve chamber and the closing element, from where<br>
these impurities would move into the liquid circulating through the valve. In addition, the<br>
functionality of the valve can be improved bv preventing the closing element from<br>
sticking into the valve chamber due to impurities.<br>
More precisely, the float valve of the present invention provides a saniti/able float valve<br>
to be used in water purification circulation, said valve comprising a body a closing<br>
element placed into the body, the length of said closing element being essentially bigger<br>
than the diameter of the closing element, and a float connected to a lever arm for<br>
controlling the closing element, characterized in that the allowance between the chamber<br>
of the body and the closing element allows a part of the liquid flow to discharge through<br>
said allowance thereby flushing said surfaces when the valve is open.<br>
In the following, the present invention will be described in more detail, with reference to<br>
the accompanying drawing, wherein<br>
Figure 1 shows schematically a float valve in accordance with the present invention as a<br>
partial cross section.<br>
Essential parts of the float valve in accordance with the invention as shown in Figure 1<br>
comprise a valve body (1), shown as a vertical cross section, a slide (2), a guide cam (3),<br>
lever arm (4) and floater (not shown), attached to the lever arm. In the figure, the valve is<br><br>
illustrated in its open-position and the arrows in the figure show the main path of the<br>
liquid flowing through the valve. The arrow pointing at the valve illustrates the liquid<br>
entering the valve and the arrow pointing away from it illustrates the liquid leaving the<br>
valve.<br>
When the valve is open, in the position shown by the figure, the liquid flows from one<br>
end of the valve body (I) into the valve (entering-arrovv), and it flows away through the<br>
opening on the side of the valve (leaving-arrow). Additionally, a part of the liquid<br>
flowing through the valve continues through the valve in the direction shown by the<br>
entering arrow, through the gap between the walls of the valve chamber and the slide (2)<br>
and leaves the valve through the opposite end of the valve. Thus, the liquid leaving<br>
through the valve chamber flushes the walls of the valve chamber and the slide and<br>
prevents agglomeration of impurities to the valve.<br>
The operation of the valve is regulated by a float attached to a lever arm (4) according to<br>
the liquid level. A guide cam (3) is regulated by the float through the lever arm, and the<br>
guide cam for its part moves the slide (2) of the valve. The front surface of the<br>
slide is equipped with a curved projective portion (5). said projective portion<br>
pressing against the inlet (6) of the liquid on the front wall of the<br>
valve chamber, when the valve is closed. Correspondingly, the edge of the inlet<br>
(6) of the liquid on the front wall of the valve chamber is chamfered. Thereby<br>
a tight connection between the front surface and the front wall of<br><br>
the valve chamber is provided, when the valve is closed, despite the allowance between the<br>
slide and the valve chamber.<br>
The form of the combination of the valve float and the lever arm is determined by the posi-<br>
tion of the valve with respect to the liquid level controlling its operation. Thus, the valve in<br>
accordance with the present invention is not dependent on any definite combination of the<br>
float and the lever arm, or to its form.<br>
The form of the closing element of the valve in accordance with the present invention is<br>
preferably designed so, that the length of the closing element is substantially bigger than<br>
the diameter of the closing element. This is to ensure the correct operation of the closing<br>
element and to prevent eventual wedging of the closing element due to the allowance or<br>
other corresponding disturbance of the closing operation due to the allowance. Addition-<br>
ally, the tight closing of the valve can thereby be guaranteed, because the eventual lateral<br>
movement of the closing element can be adequately compensated by the curved projective<br>
portion of the front surface of the closing element, said projective portion also positioning<br>
the closing element of the valve to the correct place when the valve is being closed.<br>
The valve in accordance with the present invention is, however, not limited to a definite<br>
form of the slide. Other optional functional forms of the slide are, among others, flap and<br>
ball.<br>
By means of the lever arm and the guide cam of the float of the valve an adequate surface<br>
force for closing the valve can be determined, by which an adequate sealing of the slide<br>
against the liquid inlet in the front wall of the chamber can be reached.<br>
In addition, in the valve solution in accordance with the present invention, there are no<br>
limitations for the direction of the liquid outlet in the radial direction of the valve cross sec-<br>
tion, but it can be chosen as desired.<br>
In one preferable embodiment of the invention the float valve comprises a valve housing<br>
having a substantially cylindrical chamber, said chamber having in its one end a water<br>
inlet; slide element having a substantially circular cross section, movable in the chamber in<br>
its longitudinal direction and having in its end facing towards the inlet of the valve a partly<br>
convex closing surface and said slide element having a rounded other end; on the side of<br>
the chamber, in the end facing towards the inlet, a discharge; a guide cam effecting the<br><br>
rounded end of the slide and being attached hinged to the body of the valve; a lever arm.<br>
attached to the guide cam; and a float attached to the lever arm.<br>
The float valve in accordance with the invention or the components thereof are not limited<br>
to any specific material, but it has been stated that a slide made of or plated with fluor-<br>
bearing polymer like PTFE is especially suitable in the solution in accordance with the in-<br>
vention.<br>
The valve can preferably be equipped with a flange, so that it is be easily mountable to the<br>
inlet pipe for liquid and attached to its place with a bayonet flange joint. Bayonet flange<br>
joint in this connection refers to connecting the valve and the pipe by means of a flange<br>
mounted into each of them so, that the flanges are attached to each other with a bayonet-<br>
coupling, like a clamping collar around the outer edge of the flanges, said collar connecting<br>
the flanges with each other.<br><br>
