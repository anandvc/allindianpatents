				<td>Self-adhesive addition-crosslinking silicone rubber blends, a method for the production thereof, methods for producing composite molded parts and the use thereof<br>
The present invention relates to addition-crosslinking silicone rubber blends, to a method of producing them, to methods of producing composite moldings, and to their use.<br>
The self-adhesive addition-crosslinking silicone rubber blends of the invention feature effective adhesion to substrates without an accompanying need for special treatment of the molds used to produce the moldings, allowing detachment of the addition-crosslinking silicone rubber blends from the mold. Moreover, there is generally no need for subsequent heating of the composite moldings.<br>
A range of methods have been proposed for achieving an adhesive bond between addition-crosslinking silicone elastomers and various substrates. One way is to use what is called a primer, which is employed for the pretreatment of the substrate surface. In processing, this necessitates an additional workstep and also operation with solvents. Both are disadvantageous. Another way is to achieve adhesion of addition-crosslinking silicone elastomers to substrates by adding one or more additives to the noncrosslinked silicone rubber blend.<br>
Another version is the production of a thermoplastic/siloxane blend, where different siloxanes have been mixed into the thermoplastic matrix prior to shaping, and the surface of moldings made from this thermoplastic blend are adhered using an addition-crosslinking silicone rubber. In this context, US 5 366 806 claims hydrogen-siloxanes with additional alkenyl group in the thermoplastic matrix, which are bonded with addition-crosslinking polyorganosiloxane rubbers which can preferably contain further organofunctional SiH adhesion promoters.<br>
US 5 366 805 discloses a polycarbonate which contains hydrogensiloxane-containing siloxane copolymers or terpolymers with epoxy or aryl groups. Instead of a siloxane-containing thermoplastic, US 5 418 065 proposes a polypropylene terpolymer which<br>
contains addition-crosslinking polyorganosiloxane rabber and epoxy-containing SiH siloxanes, which is adhered in the course of crosslinking. Adhesion takes place, for example, in 8 min at 120°C. In that case the thermoplastic part is injected immediately prior to the application of the silicone rubber. The system allows the composite part to be demolded from a metal mold.<br>
Another solution is the provision of addition-crosslinking polyorganosiloxane rubbers which depending on the nature of the thermoplastic substrate comprise one or more additives and which, under different conditions, can be adhered to said thermoplastic in the course of crosslinking. In this context it is desirable in particular to adhere thermoplastics with high softening temperatures to silicone rubber and conversely to minimize the adhesion to the metallic mold material, i.e., generally steel.<br>
According to US 4 087 585 effective adhesion to aluminum is brought about, for example, by the addition of two additives, a short-chain polysiloxane having at least one SiOH group, and a silane having at least one epoxy group and an Si-bonded alkoxy group. In accordance with J. Adhesion Sci. Technol. Vol. 3, No. 6 pp. 463-473 (1989) effective adhesion to various metals and plastics is achieved by adding an epoxysilane in combination with a homopolymeric crosslinker. EP-A 875 536 achieves improved adhesion to various plastics through the use of an alkoxysilane having an epoxy group and also of a hydrogensilane having at least 20 SiH functions per molecule, these blends also featuring an improved reactivity.<br>
EP 350 951 describes the use of a combination of acryl- or methacryloyloxysilane with an epoxy-functional silane and with a partial allyl ether of a polyhydric alcohol as additives for obtaining permanent adhesion of addition-crosslinking silicone elastomers to glass and metal.<br>
These blends have the disadvantage that they also exhibit effective adhesion to metals and are therefore problematic in the case of processing with uncoated metallic molds.<br>
EP-A2-1085053 discloses how, by adding a combination of glycidyloxypropyltrimethoxysilane and methacryloyloxypropyltrimethoxysilane, effective adhesion to polyamide and polybutylene terephthalate is achieved by subsequent heating of the composite parts, in tandem with ease of demolding from uncoated steel molds. However, a relatively high amount of the silanes is used, and for achieving effective ultimate adhesion it is generally recommended that the composite moldings be subsequently heated, which entails an additional workstep.<br>
US 4 082 726 discloses the use of aterpolymer, i.e., of a siloxane which is composed of at least 3 different siloxy groups. Besides Si-epoxy groups this terpolymer may comprise units including Si-phenyl, SiH, and other siloxy units. In addition to almost any alkenylsiloxanes A) and also a hydrogensiloxane B), this epoxy siloxane is used in order to produce adhesion between a thermoplastic substrate and an addition-crosslinking polyorganosiloxane rubber. No preferred concentrations were disclosed for the organofunctional units on the silicon. The presence of the epoxy-containing terpolymer brings about not only adhesion to thermoplastics but also to metals.<br>
US 5 405 896 discloses, instead of the epoxy-containing siloxane terpolymer, a copolymer or terpolymer containing at least one oxygen-containing phenylene group and also at least one SiH group. The silicone rubbers are cured with adhesion to the thermoplastic surface for 8 min at 120°C, for example. Demolding is successful from an uncoated metal mold.<br>
US 6 127 503 proposes, instead of the oxygen-containing siloxane copolymer or terpolymer, a terpolymer having at least one phenyl or phenylene unit, a nitrogen-containing unit, and an SiH group. The silicone rubbers are cured, with adhesion to the thermoplastic surface, for 10 min at 120°C, for example.<br>
EP 686 671 (US 5 536 803) describes the use as an additive of an organohydrogen-polysiloxane, at least 12 mol% of the monovalent Si-bonded organic radicals being aromatic groups. In this case, although adhesion was found to ABS, but was not quantified, and easy demolding from metallic surfaces was found, the typical technical thermoplastics such as polyamide, polybutylene terephthalate or<br>
polyphenylene sulfide, for example, were not evaluated. A specific set problem for these thermoplastics was not seen. Nor was any preferred range disclosed for the SiH content of the corresponding siloxane components. The silicone rubbers were adhered to the thermoplastic surface during crosslinking, for example for 100 sec to 8 min at 60-100°C. The SiH content is stated generally as being more than 2 hydrogen atoms per molecule. In the specific examples a hydrogen content of 6 hydrogensiloxy units per molecule is not exceeded.<br>
EP-A2-1106662 discloses self-adhesive addition-crosslinking silicone elastomer compositions which use polyorganohydrogensiloxanes that have on average less than 20 SiH groups in the molecule. The use of polyorganohydrogensiloxanes of this kind with less than 20 SiH groups in the molecule is described as being essential, since the storage stability of addition-crosslinking silicone rubber blends is affected considerably, i.e., the fluidity is massively adversely affected.<br>
EP-B1-1375622 likewise discloses addition-crosslinking silicone elastomer compositions, which comprise polyorganohydrogensiloxanes and also a specific adhesion promoter based on biphenyl compounds. The use of such biphenyl compounds is disadvantageous, however, on account of their relatively high price.<br>
WO 03/066736 has likewise disclosed addition-crosslinking silicone elastomer compositions which comprise relatively SiH-rich, phenyl-free organohydrogen-polysiloxanes and also phenyl-containing organohydrogenpolysiloxanes. The phenyl-containing organohydrogenpolysiloxanes used are relatively low in SiH.<br>
The inventors of the present patent application found surprisingly that self-adhesive addition-crosslinking silicone elastomer compositions having an SiH content of more than on average 20 SiH groups per molecule, with a comparatively low aromatic groups content, are stable on storage, adhere better to a multiplicity of substrates, ensure a high crosslinking rate, and yet are demoldable from the injection moldings filled with them.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide addition-crosslinking silicone rubber blends featuring effective adhesion to a variety of substrates, more particularly to technical thermoplastics with a high softening temperature such as polyamide, polybutylene terephthalate or polyphenylene sulfide, without the need for the molds to be coated to prevent mold sticking or treated with mold release agents, and without the need in general for the composite parts to undergo subsequent heating, for the purpose of processing on an automatic injection molding unit. For this purpose, a search is made for readily and inexpensively producible additive components for silicone rubbers, which can be added separately, also as a separate component, to commercially known, preferably 2-component rubbers.<br>
The invention accordingly provides addition-crosslinking silicone rubber blends<br>

The alkenyl content of the organopolysiloxane a) is situated preferably in the range from 0.003 mmol/g to 11.6 mmol/g, based on the vinyl-substituted polydimethyl-siloxanes, which is transferred correspondingly, equimolarly, to other radicals R having different formula weights.<br>
The organopolysiloxane a) has a viscosity of 0.001 to 30kPa.s, with very particular preference 5 to 200 Pa.s. The viscosity is determined in accordance with DIN 53 019 at 25°C.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention the organopolysiloxane a) comprises a mixture of different organopolysiloxanes having different alkenyl (preferably vinyl) contents, their alkenyl or vinyl contents preferably differing at least by a factor of 1.5-3.<br>

Chemical Analysis ed. by J.D. Winefordner.<br>
The alkenyl group content is preferably set by means of alkenyldimethylsiloxy units.<br>
As a result, in addition to the different alkenyl contents, a different chain length is<br>
produced, and hence a different viscosity.<br>
Through the use of the above-described mixtures with different alkenyl (preferably<br>
vinyl) contents it is possible to optimize the mechanical properties, such as<br>
elongation and tear propagation resistance, of the crosslinked silicone rubbers of the<br>
invention.<br>

alkenyl content of a mixture of different organopolysiloxanes with different alkenyl<br>
(preferably vinyl) contents ought preferably to be less than 0.9 mmol/g.<br>
The organopolysiloxanes a) can be prepared by methods known per se, such as, for example, using alkaline or acidic catalysts, as in US 5,536,803 column 4.<br>
The amount of the organopolysiloxanes a) can be preferably between about 20.5% and 99.8% by weight, based on the total amount of the silicone rubber blend.<br>

Component bl) of the addition-crosslinking silicone rubber blend of the invention is at least one organohydrogensiloxane having in each case on average at least 20 SiH units per molecule. If the organohydrogensiloxanes have less than 20 SiH units per molecule, the adhesion to substrates, such as more particularly thermoplastics, is reduced. The organohydrogensiloxanes bl) used in accordance with the invention contain preferably on average at least 23 SiH groups in the molecule, more preferably at least 30 SiH groups in the molecule.<br>
Additionally the organohydrogensiloxane bl) has at least one organic radical which includes at least one constituent selected from aromatic groups, halogen atoms, pseudohalogen groups, polyether groups, aminoalkyl groups, and ammonioalkyl groups. The organohydrogensiloxane bl) preferably includes at least one organic radical which contains on average at least one aromatic group.<br>

or two groups R1 from different siloxy units together form a linear, branched or cyclic alkanediyl radical having 2 to 12 carbon atoms between two silicon atoms.<br>
In a first embodiment the Si-H content of the organohydrogensiloxane bl), defined as the proportion of the silicon-bonded H atoms relative to the sum of the silicon-bonded H atoms and of the silicon-bonded organic groups, is more than 36 mol%.<br>
Particular preference is given to an organohydrogensiloxane bl) which has at least one unsubstituted or substituted aromatic group, with particular preference a phenyl, naphthyl, biphenyl or biphenyl ether group. Preferred aromatic units as substituent Rl include, for example, the following: aromatic units in which the aromatic group is attached directly to a silicon atom, such as phenyl, Cl-Cl0-alkylphenyl, C2-C10-alkylenephenyl, Cl-Cl0-alkoxyphenyl, C2-C10-alkyleneoxyphenyl, halophenyl, and naphthyl, and aromatic units in which the aromatic group is attached via an alkyl group to the silicon atom, such as phenyl(Cl-C12)-alkyl. Preference is given to aromatic groups, more particularly phenyl, which is attached directly to a silicon atom.<br>
The amount of organic radicals containing aromatic groups in the organohydrogen-polysiloxane bl), based on the amount of all radicals on the silicon atoms (with the exception of the Si-O-Si oxygen atoms), in other words including hydrogen atoms and the organic radicals, is preferably less than 12 mol%, preferably less than<br>
8 mol%, more preferably less than 7.4 mol%. The minimum amount of aromatic groups is preferably 0.5 mol%, more preferably 1 mol%.<br>
The preferred organohydrogensiloxane bl) is a linear triorganosiloxy- and/or diorganohydrogensiloxy-endstopped organohydrogensiloxane, wherein the triorganosiloxy end groups are selected from the group consisting of trimethylsiloxy, triphenylsiloxy, diphenylmethylsiloxy, phenyldimethylsiloxy, phenylethyl-dimethylsiloxy, and phenylpropyldimethoxysiloxy, the diorganohydrogensiloxy end group is preferably a dimethylhydrogensiloxy group, and that has on average 20 to 1000 methylhydrogensiloxy units, on average 0 to 500 dimethylsiloxy groups, on average less than 360 (methyl)(phenyl)siloxy units, and/or on average less than 180 diphenylsiloxy units, preferably less than 111 or 222.<br>
The molar ratio of dimethylsiloxy to methyl-hydrogen-siloxy units is preferably less than 0.1<br>
The organohydrogensiloxane bl) preferably has a content of more than 2 mmol SiH/g up to about 16 mmol SiH/g. With particular preference the organohydrogensiloxane bl) has a content of more than 7 mmol SiH/g<br>
based on polymethylhydrogendimethylsiloxanes, which is to be adapted correspondingly, equimolarly, in the presence of radicals Rl having a different formula weight.<br>
The viscosity of the organohydrogensiloxanes bl) is, for example, 10 mPa.s to 100 Pa.s, preferably 15 mPa.s to 10 Pa.s (25°C).<br>
The SiH content is determined here by way of 1H-NMR; see A.L. Smith (ed.): The Analytical Chemistry of Silicones, J. Wiley &amp; Sons 1991 Vol. 112 p. 356 ff. in Chemical Analysis ed. by J.D. Winefordner. The Si-phenyl content is likewise determined by 1H-NMR and/or 29Si-NMR; see A.L. Smith (ed.); loc. cit.<br>
The addition-crosslinking silicone rubber blend of the invention further comprises, if desired, one or more organohydrogensiloxanes b2) whose organic radicals are<br>
selected from saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon radicals, i.e., which contain no aromatic groups. Additionally the organohydrogenpolysiloxanes b2) contain on average at least two SiH groups per molecule.<br>
It is particularly preferred for both component bl) and component b2) to be present. In addition it is preferred for both component bl) and component b2) to be selected from at least one triorganosiloxy- or diorganohydrogensiloxy-endstopped poly-organohydrogensiloxane with more than 20 SiH units.<br>
The organohydrogensiloxane b2) is preferably a linear, branched or cyclic polysiloxane which can have the following siloxy units:<br><br>

or two substituents R1 from different siloxy units together form a linear, branched or cyclic alkanediyl radical having 2 to 12 carbon atoms between two silicon atoms.<br>

In this case it is preferred to stir the organopolysiloxanes a), fillers, and the hydro-phobicizing agent, preferably hexamethyldisilazane and/or divinyltetramethyl-disilazane, with water in the presence of silicas of component f), preferably at temperatures of 90 to 100°C, for at least 20 minutes in a mixer suitable for high-viscosity materials, such as a compounder, dissolver or planetary mixer, for example, and then to free the mixture from excess hydrophobicizing agents and water at 150 to 160°C, initially by evaporation under atmospheric pressure and subsequently under a reduced pressure of 100 to 20 mbar. The further components are then mixed in<br>
advantageously over 10 to 30 minutes.<br>
One preferred embodiment of the method of producing the addition-crosslinking silicone rubber blend starts by preparing at least one partial mixture which includes more than one, but not all, of components a) to g).<br>
The aim of this subdivision into partial mixtures is improved handling of the reactive mixture composed of the constituents a) to d) and also, where appropriate, e) to g).

The invention further provides addition-crosslinked silicone rubber blends obtained by crosslinking or vulcanizing the addition-crosslinking silicone rubber blends of the invention. Crosslinking or vulcanizing takes place, depending on the reactivity of the addition-crosslinking silicone rubber blends, within a temperature range from 0 to 300°C.<br>
Crosslinking may take place where appropriate under atmospheric pressure, reduced pressure down to 20 mbar, or superatmospheric pressure in the presence of ambient air. Superatmospheric pressure in the presence of ambient air includes injection molding and crosslinking on a substrate surface under injection conditions, i.e., up to 300 bar relative to the unit area of the molding.<br>
The addition-crosslinked silicone rubber blends are generally elastomeric moldings.<br>
The invention further provides a method of producing composite moldings, characterized in that at least one of the addition-crosslinking silicone rubber blends of the invention is crosslinked on a mineral, metallic, thermoset and/or thermoplastic substrate.<br>
A preferred substrate is a thermoplastic substrate, and with particular preference the substrate is of polybutylene terephthalate, polyamide or polyphenylene sulfide.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the method of the invention of producing the composite moldings, the addition-crosslinking silicone rubber blend of the invention is applied to the surface of a pre-produced thermoplastic molding, where appropriate with spreading, casting, calendering, knife coating, and rolling, preferably under atmospheric pressure, and then is crosslinked - and adhered in the process - at temperatures from 0 to 300°C, preferably 50 to 250°C.<br>

The aforementioned methods of producing the composite moldings generally involve applying the addition-crosslinking silicone rubber blend to the substrate by injection into the vulcanizing chamber in which the surface of the substrate is located. In this case the addition-crosslinking silicone rubber blend is preferably produced immediately beforehand by mixing of components a) to g). With particular preference the above-described reactive partial mixtures are prepared beforehand, and are then mixed. It is also possible for the reactive partial mixtures to be injected directly onto the target substrate, and then crosslinked.<br>
The substrates which can be coated with the crosslinked silicone rubber blends of the invention further include, for example, the following: glass, unpretreated or pretreated metal or, preferably, unpretreated or pretreated plastic.

Thermoset plastics include, for example, the following: melamine resins, urethane resins, epoxy resins, phenylene oxide resins or phenolic resins.<br>
In the course of the crosslinking or vulcanizing operation these substrate surfaces are adhered with at least one addition-crosslinkable or crosslinking silicone rubber blend of the invention.<br>
The silicone rubber blend, divided into two to three reactive partial mixtures, is brought together prior to vulcanization, by mixing in an automatic injection-molding unit or in an upstream mixing head and, if desired, downstream static mixer, the mixtures are mixed, and the resulting mixture is then crosslinked at 0-300°C and adhered. It is preferred, after mixing, to inject the components into a mold at an<br>
elevated temperature of 50-250°C, The cavity of this mold that accommodates the silicone rubber blend need not be coated or treated with mold release agents in order to reduce the level of adhesion to the mold surface to a level low enough for demolding. Information on the design of the molds, which are preferably charged in succession with a thermoset or thermoplastic material and with an elastomeric material, are found in Schwarz; Ebeling; Furth: Kunststoffverabeitung, Vogel-Verlag, ISBN: 3-8023-1803-X<br>

In order to be able to run the molds and keep them closed, it is preferred to select<br>
automatic injection-molding units with locking forces of greater than 3000 N/cm2 of<br>
molding surface.<br>
All customary automatic injection-molding units can be employed for the methods of the invention. The technical selection is determined by the viscosity of the silicone rubber blend and also the molding dimensions.<br>
The proportions of the reactive partial mixtures employed correspond to those which result after the inventively described silicone rubber blends have been mixed. They are determined by the desired Si-alkenyl to SiH ratio and also by the required amounts of adhesion-promoting constituents of components bl) and, where appropriate, b2).<br>
The invention additionally provides for the use of the addition-crosslinking silicone rubber blend of the invention for producing composite moldings such as, for example, sealing and/or damping mounting elements, handles, keyboards, switches, showerheads, plugs with elastomeric seals, lamp sockets or other fixings which have both a thermoplastic part and a silicone rubber part.<br>
