SILICA-BASED SOLS AND THEIR PRODUCTION AND USE<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention generally relates to aqueous silica-based sols suitable for use in papermaking. More particularly, the invention relates to silica-based sols, their production and use in papermaking. The present invention provides an improved method of producing silica-based sols with high stability and SiO2 contents as well as improved drainage performance.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
In the papermaking art, an aqueous suspension containing cellulosic fibres and optional fillers and additives, referred to as stock, is fed into a headbox which ejects the stock onto a forming wire. Water is drained from the stock so that a wet web of paper is formed on the wire, and the web is further dewatered and dried in the drying section of the paper machine. Drainage and retention aids are conventionally introduced into the stock in order to facilitate drainage and to increase adsorption of fine particles onto the cellulosic fibres so that they are retained with the fibres on the wire.<br>
Sols of silica-based particles are widely used as drainage and retention aids in combination with charged organic polymers. Such additive systems are among the most efficient now in use in the papermaking industry. One of the parameters affecting the properties and performance of silica-based sols is the specific surface area; stable, high-performance silica-based sols usually contain particles with a specific surface area of at least 300 m2/g. Another parameter is the S value, which indicates the degree of aggregate or microgel formation; a lower S-value is indicative of a higher degree of aggregation. While high surface areas and a certain degree of aggregate or microgel formation may be advantageous from a performance point of view, very high surface areas and extensive particle aggregation or microgel formation result in considerably decreased stability of silica-based sols, thereby making extreme dilution of the sols necessary so as to avoid gel formation.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,368,833 discloses a silica sol comprising silica particles having a specific surface area within the range of from 750 to 1,000 m2/g which are surface-modified with aluminium to a degree of from 2 to 25 % substitution of silicon atoms, and wherein the sol has an S value within the range of from 8 to 45 %. Said patent also discloses a process for producing the silica sol which comprises the steps of acidifying a water glass solution to a pH within the range of from 1 to 4; alkafising the acid sol at an SiO2 content within the<br><br>
range of from 7 to 4.5 % by weight; allowing particle growth of the sol to a specific surface area within the range of from 750 to 1,000 nr/g; and subjecting the sol to aluminium modification.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,603,805 discloses silica sols having an S value within the range of from 15 to 40 % comprising anionic silica particles, said silica particles optionally being aluminium modified, and having a specific surface area within the range of from 300 to 700 m2/g. Said patent also discloses a process for producing the silica sol comprising the steps of acidifying a water glass solution to a pH within the range of from 1 to 4; alkaiising the acid sol at an SiO2 content within the range of from 7 to 5 % by weight; alternatively alkalisation of the acid sol to a pH value between 7 and 9; and particle growth of the sol to a specific surface area within the range of from 300 to 700 m2/g; and optionally followed by aluminium modification.<br>
International Patent Appln. Pubi. No. WO 98/56715 discloses a process for preparing an aqueous polysilicate microgel which comprises mixing an aqueous solution of an alkali metal silicate with an aqueous phase of a silica-based material having a pH of 11 or less. The polysilicate microgel is used as a flocculating agent in combination with at least one cationic or amphoteric polymer in the production of pulp and paper and for water purification.<br>
International Patent Appln. Publ. No. WO 00/66492 discloses a process for the production of an aqueous sol containing silica-based particles which comprises acidifying an aqueous silicate solution to a pH of from 1 to 4 to form an acid sol; alkaiising the acid sol in a first alkalisation step; allowing particle growth of the aikalised sol for at least 10 minutes and/or heat-treating the aikalised sol at a temperature of at least 30Â°C; alkaiising the obtained sol in a second alkalisation step; and optionally modifying the silica-based sol with, for example, aluminium.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,372,806 discloses a process for preparing a stable colloidal silica having an S-value of from 20-50 and wherein said silica has a surface area of greater than 700 m2/g comprising: (a) charging a reaction vessel with a cationic ion exchange resin having at least 40 percent of its ion exchange capacity in the hydrogen form wherein said reaction vessel has means for separating said colloidal silica from said ion exchange resin; (b) charging said reaction vessel with an aqueous alkali metal silicate having a mole ratio of SiO2 to alkali metai oxide in the range of from 15:1 to 1:1 and a pH of at least 10.0; (c) stirring the contents of said reaction vessel until the pH of said contents is in the range of from 8.5 to 11.0; (d) adjusting the pH of the contents of said reaction vessel to above 10.0<br><br>
using an additional amount of said alkali metal silicate; and (e) separating the resulting colloidal silica from said ion exchange resin while removing said colloidal silica from said reaction vessel.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,176,891 discloses a method for the production of water soluble polyalumino silicate microgels having a surface area of at least about 1,000 rrr/g, comprising the steps of (a) acidifying a dilute solution of alkali metal silicate containing about 0.1 to 6 wt. % SiO2 to a pH of between 2 and 10.5 to produce polysilicic acid; followed by (b) reacting a water soluble aluminate with the potysiiicic acid before the polysilicic acid has gelled such that a product with an alumina/silica mole ratio greater than about 1/100 is obtained; and then (c) diluting the reaction mix before gelation has occurred to the equivalence of about 2.0 wt. % SiO2 or less to stabilize the microgels.<br>
It would be advantageous to be able to provide silica-based sols with high stability and SiO2 contents as well as improved drainage performance. It would also be advantageous to be able to provide improved processes for the preparation of silica-based sols with stability and SiO2 contents as well as improved drainage performance. It would also be advantageous to be able to provide a papermaking process with improved drainage.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
In accordance with the present invention there is provided silica-based sols which are suitable for use as flocculating agents in water purification and as drainage and retention aids in papermaking. The silica-based sols of the invention exhibit good stability over extended periods of time, notably high surface area stability and high stability to avoid complete gel formation.

Hereby the silica-sols of the invention can be produced by a process that is simplified, improved and more economic.<br>
The ion exchange resin used in the process is cationic and has at least part of its ion exchange capacity in the hydrogen form, i.e. an acid cationic ion exchange resin, preferably a weak acid cationic ion exchange resin. Suitably, the ion exchange resin has at least 40 % of its ion exchange capacity in the hydrogen form, preferably at least 50 %. Suitable ion exchange resins are provided on the market by several manufacturers, for example AmberliteÂ® IRC84SP from Rohm &amp; Haas. Preferably, a reaction vessel equipped with means for mixing, e.g. a stirrer, is charged with the ion exchange resin. Preferably, the ion exchange resin is regenerated by addition of an acid, e.g. sulphuric acid, preferably according to manufacturer's instruction.<br>
Step (b) of the process comprises bringing together the cationic ion exchange resin with an aqueous alkali metal silicate. Suitably, this is achieved by adding the ion exchange resin and aqueous alkali metal silicate to the reaction vessel. Preferably, the reaction vessel containing regenerated ion exchange resin is charged with the aqueous alkali metal silicate whereby an aqueous slurry is formed. Usually, the aqueous alkali metal silicate is added to a reaction vessel containing ion exchange resin having at least part of its ion exchange capacity in hydrogen form at a rate in the range of from 0.5 to 50 g SiO2 per minute and kg ion exchange resin, calculated as ion exchange resin having 100 % of its ion exchange capacity in hydrogen form, suitably from 1 to 35, and preferably from 2 to 20. Alternatively, a reaction vessel containing the aqueous alkali metal silicate is charged with the regenerated ion exchange resin whereby an aqueous slurry is formed.<br><br>
Examples of suitable aqueous alkali metal silicates or water glass include conventional materials, e.g. lithium, sodium and potassium silicates, preferably sodium silicate. The molar ratio of silica to alkali metal oxide, e.g. SiO2 to Na2O, K2O or U2O, or a mixture thereof, in the silicate solution can be in the range of from 15:1 to 1:1, suitably in the range of from 4.5:1 to 1.5:1, preferably from 3.9:1 to 2.5:1. The aqueous alkali metal silicate used can have an SiQ2 content of from about 2 to about 35 % by weight, suitably from about 5 to about 30 % by weight, and preferably from about 15 to about 25 % by weight. The pH of the aqueous alkali metal silicate is usually above 11, typically above 12.<br>
Step (c) of the process comprises stirring the aqueous slurry formed in step (b) until the pH of the aqueous phase is in the range of from 5.0 to 11.5. Alternatively, or additionally, step (c) of the process comprises stirring said aqueous slurry to allow particle aggregation or microgel formation, corresponding to an S value up to 45 %, and to obtain pH of the aqueous phase of at least 5.0. Suitably stirring is carried out until the pH of the aqueous phase is in the range of from 6.0 to 11.O, preferably to a pH in the range of from 6.5 to 10.0. In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the slurry is stirred until the pH of the aqueous phase is up to 8.0, suitably in the range of from 6.0 to 8.0, preferably from 6.5 to 7.5. In another preferred embodiment of the invention, the slurry is stirred until the pH of the aqueous phase is at least 8.0, suitably in the range of from 8.0 to 11.0, preferably from 9.0 to 10.0. Preferably, particle growth takes place while stirring the aqueous slurry. The silica-based particles formed usually have a specific surface area of at least 300 m2/g, preferably at least 700 m2/g. The specific surface area is suitably up to 1f500 rrr/g, preferably up to 1,000 m2/g. Preferably, the slurry is stirred so as to achieve particle aggregation and microgel formation, usually corresponding to an S value in the range of from 5 to 45 %, suitably from 8 to 35 %, preferably from 10 to 25 % and most preferably from 15 to 23 %. The stirring usually takes place during a period of time of from 5 to 240 minutes, preferably from 15 to 120 minutes.<br>
Step (c) of the process can be carried out simultaneously with and/or after step (b). In a preferred embodiment, the aqueous alkali metal silicate is added under stirring to the reaction vessel containing ion exchange resin having at least part of its ion exchange capacity in hydrogen form and then, after completed addition, the stirring continues to achieve the pH and/or particle aggregation or microgel formation as described above. In another preferred embodiment, the aqueous alkali metal silicate is added under stirring to the reaction vessel containing ion exchange resin having at least part of its ion exchange capacity in hydrogen form to achieve the pH and/or particle aggregation or microgel formation as described above.<br><br>
Step (d) of the process comprises adding to the aqueous phase one or more materials comprising at least one aluminium compound- Suitably, the pH of the aqueous phase is adjusted to above 9.0, preferably above 10.0; suitably in the range of from 9.2 to 11.5, preferably from 9.5 to 11.2, and most preferably from 10.0 to 11.0. Preferably, the pH is adjusted by adding one or more materials comprising at least one aluminium compound, preferably the pH is raised by adding one or more alkaline materials comprising at least one aluminium compound. In a preferred embodiment, there is added an aluminium compound. In another preferred embodiment, there is added an alkaline material and an aluminium compound. Examples of suitable aluminium compounds include alkaline aluminium salts as well as neutral and essentially neutral aluminium salts. Examples of suitable alkaline aluminium salts include alurninates, suitably aqueous alurninates, e.g. sodium and potassium aluminates, preferably sodium aluminate. Examples of neutral and essentially neutral aluminium salts include aluminium nitrate. Examples of suitable alkaline materials include aqueous alkali metal silicates, e.g. any of those defined above; aqueous alkali metal hydroxides, e.g. lithium, sodium and potassium hydroxides, preferably sodium hydroxide; ammonium hydroxide; suitably sodium silicate or hydroxide, preferably sodium silicate. When using two or more materials comprising an alkaline material and aluminium compound, the materials can be added in any order, preferably the alkaline material is added first followed by adding the aluminium compound. In a preferred embodiment, aqueous alkali metal silicate is added first and "then aqueous sodium aluminate is added. In another preferred embodiment, aqueous alkali metal hydroxide is added first and then aqueous sodium aluminate is added. The addition of aluminium compound provides an aluminated silica-based sol. Suitably, the addition of aluminium compound results in aluminium modification of the silica-based particles, preferably the particles are surface-modified by aluminium. The amount of aluminium compound used can be varied within wide limits. Usually the amount of aluminium compound added corresponds to a mole ratio of Si:A! of from 10:1 to 100:1, suitably from 2O:1 to 50:1, preferably from 25:1 to 35:1, and most preferably from 25:1 to 30:1.<br>
In step (d) of the process, when using an aqueous alkali metal silicate to adjust the pH of the aqueous phase, the weight ratio of alkali metal silicate used is step (b) to alkali metal silicate used is step (d) can vary within wide limits; usually the ratio is in the range 99:1 to 1:9, suitably from 19:1 to 1:2, preferably from 4:1 to 1:1.<br>
In step (e) of the process, the ion exchange resin is separated from the aqueous phase, for example by filtration. This can be done after step (c), for example after step (c) but before step (d), or after step (d). It is also possible to separate the ion exchange resin from the aqueous phase during step (d). For example, the ion exchange resin can be separated<br><br>
after adding the alkaline material but before adding the aluminium compound. It is also possible to add part of one alkaline material, e.g. aqueous alkali metal silicate, then separating the ion exchange resin from the aqueous phase followed by adding the remaining part of the alkaline material. Preferably, the ion exchange resin is separated from the aqueous phase after step (d).<br>
The concentration of the aqueous starting materials used in the process, e.g. the aqueous alkali metal silicate, aqueous alkali metal hydroxide and aqueous sodium aluminate, is preferably adjusted so as to provide a silica-based sol which usually has a SiO2 content of at least 3 % by weight, suitably at least 5 %, preferably at least 6 %, most preferably at least 7.5 %, and suitably up to 20 % by weight, preferably up to 15 % by weight. The silica-based sol produced by the process of this invention can have the properties defined hereinafter.<br>
The aqueous silica-based sol according to the invention contains silica-based particles, i.e. particles based on silica or SiO2, that are preferably anionic and colloidal, i.e., in the colloidal range of particle size. The particles are suitably modified with aluminium, preferably surface modified with aluminium. The silica-based sol of the invention can have a mole ratio of Si:AI of from 10:1 to 100:1, suitably from 20:1 to 50:1, preferably from 25:1 to 35:1, and most preferably from 25:1 to 30:1.<br>
The silica-based sol of the invention can have an S va lue in the range of from 10 to 50 %, suitably from to 12 to 40 %, preferably from 15 to 25 %&gt;, and most preferably from 17 to 24 %. The S-value is measured and calculated as described by Her &amp; Dalton in J. Phys. Chem. 60(1956), 955-957. The S-value indicates the degree of aggregate or microgel formation and a lower S-value is indicative of a higher degree of aggregation.<br>
The silica-based particles present in the sol can have a specific surface area of at least 300 m2/g, suitably at least 700 m2/g, preferably at least 750 m2/g. The specific surface area is usually up to 1,000 nr/g, suitably up to 950 m2/g. The specific surface area is measured by means of filtration with NaOH as described by Sears in Analytical Chemistry 28(1956):12, 1981-1983, after appropriate removal of or adjustment for any compounds present in the sample that may disturb the titration like aluminium and boron compounds, for example as described by Sears and in U.S. Patent No. 5,176,891.<br>
The silica-based sol of the invention usually has a mole ratio of Si:X, where X = alkali metal, of at least 3:1, suitably at least 4:1, preferably at least 5:1 and most preferably at least 6:1. The mole ratio of Si:X, where X = alkali metal, is usually up to 25:1, suitably up to 20:1, preferably up to 17:1, more preferably up to 15:1  and most preferably up to 10:1.<br><br>
The silica-based sol of this invention is preferably stable. Suitably, the sol maintains a specific surface area of at least 300 rrr/g, preferably at least 700 trr/g, for at least 3 months on storage or ageing at 20 Â°C in dark and non-agitated conditions. Suitably, the sol maintains an S value in the range of from 10 to 50 %, preferably from 12 to 40 %, for at least 3 months on storage or ageing at 20 Â°C in dark and non-agitated conditions.<br>
The silica-based sol according to this invention is suitable for use as a flocculating agent, for example in the production of pulp and paper, notably as a drainage and retention aid, and within the field of water purification, both for purification of different kinds of waste water and for purification specifically of white water from the pulp and paper industry. The silica-based sols can be used as a flocculating agent, notably as a drainage and retention aid, in combination with organic polymers which can be selected from anionic, amphoteric, non-ionic and cationic polymers and mixtures thereof. The use of such polymers as flocculating agents and as drainage and retention aids is well known in the art. The polymers can be derived from natural or synthetic sources, and they can be linear, branched or cross-linked. Examples of generally suitable main polymers include anionic, amphoteric and cationic starches; anionic, amphoteric and cationic acrylamide-based polymers, including essentially linear, branched and cross-linked anionic and cationic acrylamide-based polymers; as well as cationic poly(diallyldimethyl ammonium chloride); cationic polyethylene imines; cationic polyamines; cationic polyamideamines and vinyiamide-basecl polymers, melamine-formaldehyde and urea-formaldehyde resins. Suitably, the silica-based sols are used in combination with at least one cationic or amphoteric polymer, preferably cationic polymer. Cationic starch and cationic polyacrylamide are particularly preferred polymers and they can be used singly, together with each other or together with other polymers, e.g. other cationic and/or anionic polymers. The molecular weight of the polymer is suitably above 1,000,000 and preferably above 2,000,000. The upper limit is not critical; it can be about 50,000,000, usually 30,000,000 and suitably about 25,000,000. However, the molecular weight of polymers derived from natural sources may be higher.<br>
The present silica-based sol can also be used in combination with cationic coaguiant(s), either with or without the co-use of the organic polymer(s) described above. Examples of suitable cationic coagulants include water-soluble organic polymeric coagulants and inorganic coagulants. The cationic coagulants can be used singly or together, i.e. a polymeric coagulant can be used in combination with an inorganic coagulant.<br>
Examples of suitable water-soluble organic polymeric cationic coagulants include cationic polyamines, polyamideamines, polyethylene imines, dicyandiamide condensation polymers<br><br>
and polymers of water soluble ethylenicaily unsaturated monomer or monomer blend which is formed of 50 to 100 mole % cationic monomer and 0 to 50 mole % other monomer. The amount of cationic monomer is usually at least 80 mole %, suitably 100 %. Examples of suitable ethylenicalty unsaturated cationic monomers include dialkylaminoalkyl (meth)-acrylates and -acryiamides, preferably in quaternised form, and diallyl dialkyl ammonium chlorides, e.g. diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (DADMAC), preferably homopolymers and copolymers of DADMAC. The organic polymeric cationic coagulants usually have a molecular weight in the range of from 1,000 to 700,000, suitably from 10,000 to 500,000. Examples of suitable inorganic coagulants include aluminium compounds, e.g. alum and polyaluminium compounds, e.g. polyaluminium chlorides, polyaiuminium sulphates, polyaluminium silicate sulphates and mixtures thereof.<br>
The components of the drainage and retention aids according to the invention can be added to the stock in conventional manner and in any order. When using drainage and retention aids comprising a silica-based sol and organic polymer, it is preferred to add the organic polymer to the stock before adding the silica-based sol, even if the opposite order of addition may be used. It is further preferred to add the organic polymer before a shear stage, which can be selected from pumping, mixing, cleaning, etc., and to add the silica-based sol after that shear stage. When using a cationic coagulant, it is preferably added to the cellulosic suspension before the addition of the silica-based sol, preferably also before the addition of the organic polymer(s).<br>
The components of the drainage and retention aids according to the invention are added to the stock to be dewatered in amounts which can vary within wide limits depending on, inter alia, type and number of components, type of furnish, filler content, type of filler, point of addition, etc. Generally the components are added in amounts that give better drainage and retention than is obtained when not adding the components. The silica-based sol is usually added in an amount of at  blast 0.001 % by weight, often at least 0.005% by weight, calculated as SiO2 and based on dry furnish, i.e. dry cellulosic fibres and optional fillers, and the upper limit is usually 1.0% and suitably 0.5% by weight The organic polymer is usually added in an amount of at least 0.001%, often at least 0.005% by weight, based on dry furnish, and the upper limit is usually 3% and suitably 1.5% by weight. When using a cationic polymeric coagulant, it can be added in an amount of at least 0.05%, based on dry furnish. Suitably, the amount is in the range of from 0.07 to 0.5%, preferably in the range from 0.1 to 0.35%. When using an aluminium compound as the inorganic coagulant, the total amount added is usually at least 0.05%, calculated as AI2O3 and based on dry furnish. Suitably the amount is in the range of from 0.1 to 3.0%, preferably in the range from 0.5 to 2.0*%.<br><br>
Further additives which are conventional in papermaking can of course be used in combination with the additives according to the invention, such as, for example, dry strength agents, wet strength agents, optical brightening agents, dyes, sizing agents tike rosin-based sizing agents and cellulose-reactive sizing agents, e.g. alkyl and alkenyl ketene dimers and ketene multimers, alkyl and alkenyl succinic anhydrides, etc. The cellulosic suspension, or stock, can also contain mineral fillers of conventional types such as, for example, kaolin, china clay, titanium dioxide, gypsum, talc and natural and synthetic calcium carbonates such as chalk, ground marble and precipitated calcium carbonate.<br>
The process of this invention is used for the production of paper. The term "paper", as used herein, of course include not only paper and the production thereof, but also other cellulosic sheet or web-like products, such as for example board and paperboard, and the production thereof. The process can be used in the production of paper from different types of suspensions of cellulose-containing fibres and the suspensions should suitably contain at least 25% by weight and preferably at least 50% by weight of such fibres, based on dry substance. The suspension can be based on fibres from chemical pulp such as sulphate, sulphite and organosoiv pulps, mechanical pulp such as thermomechanical pulp, chemo-thermomechanical pulp, refiner pulp and groundwood pulp, from both hardwood and softwood, and can also be based on recycled fibres, optionally from de-inked pulps, and mixtures thereof. The pH of the suspension, the stock, can be within the range of from about 3 to about 10. The pH is suitably above 3.5 and preferably within the range of from 4 to 9.<br>
