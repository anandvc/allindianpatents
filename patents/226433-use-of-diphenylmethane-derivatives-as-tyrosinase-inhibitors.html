Use of diphenylmethane derivatives as tyrosinase inhibitors<br>
The present invention relates to the use of diphenylmethane derivatives of the<br>
following Formula 1 as tyrosinase inhibitors,<br><br><br>
straight-chain or branched, saturated or unsaturated alkyl having 2-4 C<br>
atoms<br>
OH or<br>
halogen,<br>
R2 is<br>
hydrogen,<br>
methyl or<br>
straight-chain or branched, saturated or unsaturated alkyl having 2-5 C<br>
atoms,<br>
R3 is<br>
methyl or<br>
straight-chain or branched, saturated or unsaturated alkyl having 2-5 C<br>
atoms,<br>
and<br>
R4 and R5 independently of one another are<br>
hydrogen,<br>
methyl,<br>
straight-chain or branched, saturated or unsaturated alkyl having 2-5 C<br>
atoms<br><br>
OH or<br>
halogen.<br>
In this formula the substituents OH, R1, R4 and R5 can in each case, (as is<br>
shown in the drawing) assume an arbitrary position on the aromatic ring<br>
concerned (ortho, meta or para with respect to the bridge between the rings).<br>
In the field of the cosmetics industry there is an increasing need for agents for<br>
lightening skin and hair and for agents for combating age spots. In this<br>
context, cosmetics for lightening skin and hair and for combating age spots<br>
play a major role in particular in Asiatic countries with a dark skinned/haired<br>
population, but agents for such cosmetic treatments are gaining in importance<br>
in the central European area and in the USA as well.<br>
The skin and hair colour of people is essentially determined via the<br>
melanocyte count, by the melanin concentration and the intensity of the<br>
melanin biosynthesis, in which context, on the one hand, intrinsic factors such<br>
as the genetic make-up of an individual and, on the other hand, extrinsic<br>
factors such as, in particular, the intensity and frequency of exposure to UV<br>
exert a significant influence on the skin and hair colour.<br>
Skin-lightening active compounds usually intervene in the melanin metabolism<br>
or catabolism. The melanin pigments, which as a rule are brown to black in<br>
colour, are formed in the melanocytes of the skin, transferred into the<br>
keratinocytes and give rise to the colouration of the skin or the hair. In<br>
mammals, the brown-black eumelanins are formed mainly from hydroxy-<br>
substituted aromatic amino acids such as L-tyrosine and L-DOPA and the<br>
yellow to red pheomelanins are additionally formed from sulphur-containing<br>
molecules (Cosmetics &amp; Toiletries 1996, 111 (5), 43-51). Starting from L-<br>
tyrosine, L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) is formed by the copper-<br>
containing key enzyme tyrosinase, which L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine, in<br><br>
turn, is converted by tyrosinase to dopachrome. The latter is oxidised to<br>
melanin via several steps catalysed by various enzymes.<br>
Skin-lightening agents are used for various reasons: if the melanin-forming<br>
melanocytes in the human skin are not uniformly distributed for whatever<br>
reason, pigment spots are produced that are either lighter or darker than the<br>
surrounding areas of the skin. In order to eliminate this problem, lightening<br>
agents are used that help at least partially to even out such pigment spots. In<br>
addition, for many people there is a need to lighten their naturally dark skin<br>
colour or to prevent skin pigmentation. Very reliable and effective skin and hair<br>
lightening agents are needed for this purpose. Many skin and hair lightening<br>
agents contain tyrosinase inhibitors that are more or less powerful. However,<br>
this is only one possible route for skin and hair lightening.<br>
Occasionally, UV-absorbing substances are also used for protection against<br>
the increase in skin pigmentation induced by UV light. However, this is an<br>
effect of purely physical origin and thus differs from the biological action of<br>
skin lightening agents on the cellular melanin formation, which is detectable<br>
even in the absence of UV light. Specifically, only the UV-induced browning of<br>
the skin can be prevented by UV filters, in contrast to which a lightening of the<br>
skin can also be produced by biologically active skin lighteners, which<br>
intervene in the melanin biosynthesis.<br>
Hydroquinone, hydroquinone derivatives, such as, for example, arbutin,<br>
vitamin C, derivatives of ascorbic acid, such as, for example, ascorbyl<br>
palmitate, kojic acid and derivatives of kojic acid, such as, for example, kojic<br>
acid dipalmitate, are used in particular in commercially available skin and hair<br>
lightening agents.<br>
One of the skin and hair lightening agents most frequently used is<br>
hydroquinone. However, the substance has a cytotoxic effect on melanocytes<br>
and acts as an irritant on the skin. Therefore, for example in Europe, Japan<br>
and South Africa, such preparations are no longer permissible for cosmetic<br><br>
applications. Moreover, hydroquinone is highly sensitive to oxidation and can<br>
be stabilised in cosmetic formulations only with difficulty.<br>
Vitamin C and ascorbic acid derivatives have only an inadequate action on the<br>
skin. Moreover, they do not act directly as tyrosinase inhibitors, but reduce the<br>
coloured intermediates in the melanin biosynthesis.<br>
Kojic acid (5-hydroxy-2-hydroxymethyl-4-pyranone) is a tyrosinase inhibitor<br>
that inhibits the catalytic action thereof via chelation of the copper atoms of the<br>
enzyme; it is used in commercial skin and hair lightening agents, but has a<br>
high sensitising potential and causes contact allergies.<br>
In the search for novel agents that have a skin and hair lightening action<br>
and/or are active against age spots, the aim is, accordingly, quite generally to<br>
find substances that inhibit the enzyme tyrosinase in as low a concentration as<br>
possible, it furthermore having to be taken into account that these substances<br>
used in cosmetic and/or pharmaceutical products, in addition to having a high<br>
activity at concentrations that are as low as possible, must also be<br>
toxicologicaily acceptable,<br>
readily tolerated by the skin and in particular not sensitising and not<br>
irritant,<br>
stable (in particular in the customary cosmetic and/or pharmaceutical<br>
formulations),<br>
preferably odourless and<br>
able to be produced inexpensively (that is to say using standard<br>
methods and/or starting from standard precursors).<br><br>
The search for suitable (active) substances that have one or more of the said<br>
properties to an adequate degree is made more difficult for the person skilled<br>
in the art because there is no clear dependence between the chemical<br>
structure of a substance, on the one hand, and its biological activity and its<br>
stability, on the other hand. Furthermore, there is no predictable relationship<br>
between the skin lightening effect, the toxicological acceptability, the tolerance<br>
by the skin and/or the stability of potential active compounds. Furthermore, a<br>
particular prerequisite for the use of an active substance in practice is its<br>
stability to chemical substances which are customarily used as accompanying<br>
constituents in cosmetics and to light.<br>
The primary aim of the present invention was, therefore (in accordance with<br>
the general requirements, see above), to indicate an active substance which<br>
(a) has a good skin lightening effect (that is to say, for example, a powerful<br>
tyrosinase-inhibiting action in specific cell-free or cellular in vitro test systems,<br>
cellular in vitro test systems being preferred because of the better<br>
transference to the human in vivo situation), (b) can be prepared in a highly<br>
pure form, (c) is dermatologically and toxicologically acceptable and (d) in<br>
addition shows good stability to the effects of light. The Applicant's own<br>
research now showed that diphenylmethane derivatives of the Formula 1<br>
achieve these aims and thus can be used preferentially as tyrosinase-<br>
inhibiting agents.<br>
In this context, diphenylmethane derivatives that can be used according to the<br>
invention, such as, for example, styrylresorcinol (Formula 4; CARN:85-27-8; 4-<br>
(1-phenylethyl)-1,3-dihydroxybenzene), that is described in more detail below,<br>
can be prepared without any problem in accordance with methods known from<br>
the literature. To perform activity studies, the diphenylmethane derivatives of<br>
the Formula 1 were prepared by Friedel-Crafts alkylation in accordance with<br>
methods known from the literature, such as in T. Yamamura et al. (Bull. Chem.<br>
Soc. Jpn. Vol. 68, S.2955-2960; 1995).<br><br><br>
The Applicant's own research now showed that diphenylmethane derivatives<br>
of the Formula 1, and here in particular styrylresorcinol of the Formula 4, have<br>
a more powerful tyrosinase-inhibiting activity than hexylresorcinol that is used,<br>
inter alia, in the food industry as a browning inhibitor (see below, Example 1,<br>
Table 2: Comparison of styrylresorcinol (Formula 4) and 4-hexylresorcinol:<br>
CARN: 136-77-6). In addition, the fact that compounds of the Formula 1, and<br>
here in particular styrylresorcinol (Formula 4), have a more powerful<br>
tyrosinase-inhibiting activity compared with the known skin- and hair-lightening<br>
active compound kojic acid was particularly surprising, as a result of which<br>
they can be used in particularly low, and thus toxicologically and<br>
dermatologically acceptable, concentration in cosmetic products;<br>
styrylresorcinol has a tyrosinase-inhibiting action that is more powerful by a<br>
factor of approximately 215 than that of kojic acid.<br>
The Applicant's activity studies with synthetic styrylresorcinol (Formula 4;<br>
CARN:85-27-8; 4-(1-phenylethyl)-1,3-dihydroxybenzene) prepared in<br>
accordance with methods known from the literature confirm, for example, that<br>
the compounds of the Formula 1 (diphenylmethane derivatives) and also<br>
mixtures of substances that contain one or more compounds of the Formula 1,<br>
where the groups R1 to R5 in each case have the abovementioned meaning,<br>
have a powerful tyrosinase-inhibiting action and thus are outstandingly<br>
suitable for use as skin lightening agents and as agents for combating age<br>
spots. In this context, because of their high stability to light, they are<br>
outstandingly suitable for use as skin lighteners in cosmetic products and the<br>
like, as alternatives for or as supplements to known skin-lightening active<br><br>
compounds (such as, for example, hydroquinone, arbutin or ascorbic acid).<br>
The compound of the Formula 4 and the further compounds of the Formula 1,<br>
in which the OH groups are in the meta- or para- position with respect to one<br>
another, are, moreover, very stable to oxygen.<br>
Tyrosinase inhibition usually takes place for cosmetic reasons, but in<br>
exceptional cases can also have a therapeutic character. Furthermore, the<br>
compounds of the Formula 1 can also be used in the food industry or in the<br>
aroma industry as browning-inhibiting additives; in this context see below.<br>
The compounds of the Formula 1, in particular insofar as they are used as<br>
agents for skin and hair lightening or as agents for combating age spots, are<br>
as a rule applied topically in the form of solutions, creams, lotions, gels, sprays<br>
or the like.<br>
Important fields of application in this context are cosmetic, in particular<br>
dermatological and/or keratinological formulations, which (apart from the<br>
presence of compounds of the Formula 1) are of customary composition, and<br>
serve for cosmetic, in particular dermatological and/or keratinological,<br>
sunscreening, for the treatment, the care and the cleansing of the skin and/or<br>
the hair or as a make-up product in decorative cosmetics. Correspondingly,<br>
such formulations, depending on their composition, can be used, for example,<br>
as skin protection cream, cleansing milk, cleansing soap, sunscreen lotion,<br>
nutrient cream, day cream or night cream, deodorant, antiperspirant,<br>
shampoo, hair care agent, hair conditioner or hair colourant and, in this<br>
context/ are preferably in the form of an emulsion, lotion, milk, cream,<br>
hydrodispersion gel, balm, spray, foam, liquid soap, bar of soap, hair- (sic),<br>
roll-on, stick or make-up.<br>
Furthermore, the diphenylmethane derivatives according to the invention can<br>
also be used in foods. Particularly preferred product categories here are in<br>
particular those foods that, because of their naturally occurring content of<br>
phenolic compounds, tend to spontaneous browning reactions under the<br><br>
influence of endogenous polyphenol oxidases when processing. These<br>
nclude, in particular, fruit and vegetable products, in particular apples, pears<br>
or potatoes, or crustaceans, such as, in particular, crabs, langustines or<br>
shrimps, in which context this list must, of course, not be regarded as<br>
complete and can be expanded as desired.<br>
The concentration of the diphenylmethane derivatives of the Formula 1 in<br>
formulations (in particular formulations to be applied topically) is preferably in<br>
the range of 0.0001 to 20% (m/m), preferentially in the range of 0.001 to<br>
5% (m/m) and particularly preferentially in the range of 0.01 to 1% (m/m). In<br>
these formulations the tyrosinase-inhibiting active compound can be used (a)<br>
prophylactically or (b) as needed.<br>
The concentration of the amount of active compound that is, for example, to<br>
be applied daily differs and depends on the physiological condition of the test<br>
person and on parameters specific to the individual, such as age or body<br>
weight. Diphenylmethane derivatives of the Formula 1 can be used on their<br>
own, as mixtures or also in combination with further tyrosinase-inhibiting<br>
substances.<br>
The compounds of the Formula 1 (where R1 to R5 have the meanings<br>
indicated above and what has been stated above also applies in respect of the<br>
preferred meanings of R1 to R5) can also be used as a constituent of<br>
cosmetic agents and fragrance compositions (perfume compositions) and, for<br>
example, can impart a tyrosinase-inhibiting action to a perfumed (for example<br>
cosmetic) end product. A particularly preferred fragrance composition<br>
comprises (a) a fragrance in an amount that has a sensory action, (b) one or<br>
more compounds of the Formula 1 (where R1 to R5 can have the meanings<br>
indicated above) in an amount that has a tyrosinase-inhibiting action and<br>
optionally (c) one or more excipients and/or additives. Since the perfume<br>
content in a cosmetic end product is frequently in the range of approximately<br>
1% (m/m), a perfume which contains a compound of the Formula 1 will<br>
preferably consist to approximately 5 to 50% (m/m) of one or more<br><br>
compounds of the Formula 1. It has proved particularly advantageous that the<br>
substances of the Formula 1 have only a weak odour of their own, or are<br>
completely odourless since this property predestines them for use in a<br>
fragrance composition.<br>
in a preferred method for cosmetic and/or therapeutic skin lightening and for<br>
the treatment (combating) of age spots, the concentration in which the<br>
synergistically active mixtures according to the invention is used is also in the<br>
range between 0.0001 to 20% (m/m), preferably in the range between 0.001 to<br>
5% (m/m) and particularly preferentially in the range of 0.01 to 1% (m/m), in<br>
each case based on the total mass of the cosmetic or pharmaceutical product<br>
which contains the mixture.<br>
In this context, the diphenylmethane derivatives of the Formula 1 can be used<br>
(a) prophylactically or (b) as needed.<br>
It is pointed out that, in the context of the present text, the term<br>
diphenylmethane derivatives in the case of the derivatives of the Formula 1<br>
that have differently substituted phenyl radicals and for which, at the same<br>
time, R2 and R3 differ, also comprises the pure S-configured enantiomers, the<br>
R-configured enantiomers and arbitrary mixtures of S- and R-configured<br>
enantiomers. It is true that for commercial reasons it is particularly<br>
advantageous in these cases to use mixtures of racemates of the particular<br>
diphenylmethane derivatives for skin lightening and/or for combating age<br>
spots since these mixtures are particularly easily accessible by synthesis;<br>
however, the pure enantiomers or non-racemic mixtures of these enantiomers<br>
are also suitable for the purposes according to the invention.<br>
The diphenylmethane derivatives of the Formula 1 used according to the<br>
invention can be incorporated without difficulty in conventional cosmetic or<br>
ciermatological formulations such as, inter alia, pump sprays, aerosol sprays,<br>
creams, ointments, tinctures, lotions, nail care products (for example nail<br>
varnishes, nail varnish removers, nail balsams) and the like. In this context it is<br><br>
also possible, and in some cases advantageous, to combine the<br>
diphenylmethane derivatives of the Formula 1 used according to the invention<br>
with further active compounds, for example with other substances that have a<br>
skin and hair lightening action or are active against age spots. In this context<br>
the cosmetic and/or dermatological/keratological formulations containing the<br>
diphenylmethane derivatives of the Formula 1 can otherwise be of customary<br>
composition and serve for treatment of the skin and/or the hair in the sense of<br>
a dermatological or keratological treatment or of a treatment in the sense of<br>
care cosmetics. However, they can also be used in make-up products in<br>
decorative cosmetics.<br>
Cosmetic formulations that contain diphenylmethane derivatives of the<br>
Formula 1 can also contain further active compounds having a skin lightening<br>
action. In this context all skin lightening active compounds that are suitable or<br>
customary for cosmetic and/or dermatological applications can be used<br>
according to the invention. Advantageous skin lightening active compounds<br>
are, to this extent, kojic acid (5-hydroxy-2-hydroxymethyl-4-pyranone (sic),<br>
kojic acid derivatives such as, for example, kojic acid dipalmitate, arbutin,<br>
ascorbic acid, ascorbic acid derivatives, hydroquinone, hydroquinone<br>
derivatives, resorcinol, sulphur-containing molecules, such as, for example,<br>
glutathione or cysteine [lacuna] alpha-hydroxy acids (for example citric acid,<br>
lactic acid, malic acid) and the derivatives thereof, cycloalkanones,<br>
methylenedioxyphenyl alkanols, vinyl- and ethyl-gujacol (sic), inhibitors of the<br>
nitrogen oxide synthesis, such as, for example, L-nitroarginine and the<br>
derivatives thereof, 2,7-dinitroindazole or thiocitrulline, metal chelating agents<br>
(for example a-hydroxy fatty acids, palmitic acid, phytic acid, lactoferrin, humic<br>
acid, bile acid, bile extracts, bilirubin, biliverdin, EDTA, EGTA and derivatives<br>
thereof), flavonoids, retinoids, soya milk, serin protease inhibitors or lipoic acid<br>
or other synthetic or natural active compounds for skin and hair lightening, it<br>
being possible for the latter also to be used in the form of an extract from<br>
plants, such as, for example, bearberry extract, rice extract, liquorice root<br>
extract or constituents enriched therefrom, such as glabridin or licochalkon A,<br>
artocarpus extract, extract from Rumex and Ramulus species, extracts from<br><br>
pine species (Pinus) and extracts from Vitis species or stilbene derivatives<br>
enriched therefrom.<br>
In numerous cases the diphenylmethane derivatives of the Formula 1 can be<br>
used in combination with preservatives. Preferably, preservatives such as<br>
benzoic acid, the esters and salts thereof, propionic acid and salts thereof,<br>
salicylic acid and salts thereof, 2,4-hexanoic acid (sorbic acid) and salts<br>
thereof, formaldehyde and paraformaldehyde, 2-hydroxybiphenyl ether and<br>
salts thereof, 2-zincsulphidopyridine-N-oxide, inorganic sulphites and<br>

In various cases it can also be advantageous to use the diphenylmethane<br>
derivatives of the Formula 1 in combination with substances that are used<br>
mainly for the inhibition of the growth of undesired microorganisms on or in<br>
animal organisms. In addition to conventional preservatives, further active<br>
compounds that are worthy of mention in this regard are, in addition to the<br>
large group of conventional antibiotics, in particular the products relevant for<br>
cosmetics, such as triclosan, climbazol, octoxyglycerol, Octopirox (1-hydroxy-<br>
4-methyl-6-(2,4j4-trimethylpentyl)-2(1 H)-pyridone, 2-aminoethanol), chitosan,<br>
farnesol, glycerol monolaurate or combinations of the said substances, which,<br>
inter alia, are used against underarm odour, foot odour or dandruff.<br>
In addition, the diphenylmethane derivatives of the Formula 1 can also be<br>
used particularly advantageously in combination with perspiration-inhibiting<br>
active compounds (antiperspirants) for controlling body odour. Perspiration-<br>
inhibiting active compounds used are, in particular, aluminium salts, such as<br>
aluminium chloride, aluminium chlorohydrate, nitrate, sulphate, acetate etc. In<br>
addition, however, the use of zinc, magnesium and zirconium compounds can<br>
also be advantageous. Essentially the aluminium salts and - to a somewhat<br>
lesser extent - aluminium/zirconium salt combinations have proved their worth<br>
for use in cosmetic and dermatological antiperspirants. The partially<br>
neutralised aluminium hydroxychlorides, which are thus better tolerated by the<br>
skin but are not quite as effective, are also worthy of mention. In addition to<br>
aluminium salts, further substances can also be used, such as, for example, a)<br>
protein-precipitating substances such as, inter alia, formaldehyde,<br>
glutaraldehyde, natural and synthetic tanning agents and also trichloroacetic<br>
acid, which give rise to surface closure of the sweat glands, b) local<br>
anaesthetics (inter alia dilute solutions of, for example, lidocaine, prilocaine or<br><br>
mixtures of such substances) that switch off the sympathetic supply of the<br>
sweat glands by blocking the peripheral nerve paths, c) zeolites of the X, A or<br>
Y type, which in addition to reducing sweat secretion also act as adsorbents<br>
for bad odours, and d) botulinus toxin (toxin of the bacterium Clostridium<br>
botulinum), which is also used in the case of hyperhidrosis, a pathologically<br>
increased sweat secretion, and the action of which is based on an irreversible<br>
blockage of the release of the transmitter substance acetylcholine relevant for<br>
sweat secretion.<br>
In some cases a combination with (metal) chelating agents can also be<br>
advantageous. In this context, (metal) chelating agents that are preferably to<br>
be used are, inter alia, α-hydroxy fatty acids, phytic acid, lactoferrin, α-hydroxy<br>
acids, such as, inter alia, citric acid, lactic acid and malic acid, as well as<br>
humic acids, bile acids, bile extracts, bilirubin, biliverdin or EDTA, EGTA and<br>
derivatives thereof.<br>
For use, the cosmetic and/or dermatologically active diphenymethane<br>
derivatives of the Formula 1 are applied to the skin and/or the hair in an<br>
adequate amount in the manner customary for cosmetics and dermatological<br>
products. In this context cosmetic and dermatological formulations that contain<br>
a mixture according to the invention and additionally act as a sunscreen offer<br>
particular advantages. Advantageously, these formulations contain at least<br>
one UVA filter and/or at least one UVB filter and/or at least one inorganic<br>
pigment. In this context the formulations can be in various forms, such as are,<br>
for example, customarily employed for sunscreen formulations. Thus, they can<br>
be, for example, a solution, an emulsion of the water-in-oil (W/O) type or of the<br>
oil-m-water (O/W) type or a multiple emulsion, for example of the water-in-oil-<br>
in-water (W/O/W) type, a gel, a hydrodispersion, a solid stick or also an<br>
aerosol.<br>
As mentioned, formulations that contain diphenylmethane derivatives of the<br>
Formula 1 can particularly advantageously be combined with substances that<br>
absorb UV radiation, the total amount of the filter substances being, for<br><br>
example, 0.01% (m/m) to 40% (m/m), preferably 0.1% to 10% (m/m), in<br>
particular 1.0 to 5.0% (m/m), based on the total weight of the formulations, in<br>
order to make available cosmetic formulations that protect the hair and/or the<br>
skin against ultraviolet radiation. Advantageously these formulations contain at<br>
least one UVA filter and/or at least one UVB filter and/or at least one inorganic<br>
pigment, so that a protection factor of at least &gt; 2 (preferably &gt; 5) is achieved.<br>
In this context, these formulations according to the invention can be in various<br>
forms, such as are customarily used, for example for sunscreen formulations.<br>
Thus, they can, for example, be a solution, an emulsion of the water-in-oil<br>
(W/O) type or of the oil-in-water (O/W) type or a multiple emulsion, for<br>
example of the water-in-oil-in-water (W/O/W) type, a gel, a hydrodispersion, a<br>
solid stick or also an aerosol.<br>
If the formulations according to the invention contain UVB filter substances,<br>
these can be oil-soluble or water-soluble. Advantageous oil-soluble UVB filters<br>
are, for example: 3-benzylidenecamphor derivatives, preferably 3-(4-<br>
methylbenzylidene)camphor, 3-benzylidenecamphor; 4-aminobenzoic acid<br>
derivatives, preferably 2-ethylhexyl 4-(dimethylamino)-benzoate, amyl 4-<br>
(dimethylamino)benzoate, esters of cinnamic acid, preferably 2-ethylhexyl 4-<br>
methoxycinnamate, isopentyl 4-methoxycinnamate; esters of salicylic acid,<br>
oreferably 2-ethylhexyl salicylate, 4-isopropylbenzyl salicylate, homomenthyl<br>
salicylate, derivatives of benzophenone, preferably 2-hydroxy-4-<br>
methoxybenzophenone, 2-hydroxy-4-methoxy-4'-methylbenzophenone, 2, 2'-<br>
dihydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone, esters of benzalmalonic acid, preferably<br>
di(2-ethylhexyl) 4-methoxybenzalmalonate, 2,4,6-trianilino-(p-carbo-2'-ethyl-1 '-<br>
hexyloxy)-1,3,5-triazine. Advantageous water-soluble UVB filters are, for<br>
example, salts of 2-phenylbenzimidazole-5-sulphonic acid, such as the<br>
sodium, potassium or triethanolammonium salt thereof, and also the sulphonic<br>
acid itself; sulphonic acid derivatives of benzophenones, preferably 2-hydroxy-<br>
4-methoxybenzophenone-5-sulphonic acid and salts thereof; sulphonic acid<br>
derivatives of 3-benzylidenecamphor, such as, for example, 4-(2-oxo-3-<br>
bomylidenemethyl)benzenesulphonic acid, 2-methyl-5-(2-oxo-3-bomylidene-<br>
methyl)sulphonic acid and salts thereof and also 1,4-di(2-oxo-10-sulpho-3-<br><br>
bornylidertemethyl)-benzene and salts thereof (the corresponding 10-sulphato<br>
compounds, for example the corresponding sodium, potassium or triethanol-<br>
ammonium salt) and also benzene-1,4-di(2-oxo-3-bornylidenemethyl-10-<br>
sulphonic acid (sic).<br>
The above list of the said UVB filters that can be used in combination with the<br>
diphenylmethane derivatives of the Formula 1 should, of course, not be<br>
understood as definitive. It can also be advantageous to employ UVA filters,<br>
such as are customarily contained in cosmetic formulations. These<br>
substances are preferably derivatives of dibenzoylmethane, in particular 1-(4'-<br>
tert.-butylphenyl)-3-(4'-methoxyphenyl)-propane-1,3-dione and 1-phenyl-3-(4'-<br>
isopropylphenyl)propane-1,3-dione.<br>
In cosmetic formulations, the diphenylmethane derivatives of the Formula 1<br>
can advantageously be combined with cosmetic auxiliaries, such as are<br>
customarily used in such formulations, thus, for example, with: antioxidants;<br>
perfume oils; agents to prevent foaming; colourants; pigments that have a<br>
colouring action; thickeners; surface-active substances; emulsifiers;<br>
piasticizing substances; moistening and/or moisture-retaining substances;<br>
fats, oils, waxes; other conventional constituents of a cosmetic formulation,<br>
such as alcohols, polyols, polymers, foam stabilisers; electrolytes, organic<br>
solvents or silicone derivatives.<br>
A high content of treatment substances is usually advantageous in<br>
formulations containing diphenylmethane derivatives of the Formula 1 for the<br>
topical prophylactic or cosmetic treatment of the skin. According to a preferred<br>
embodiment, the compositions contain one or more animal and/or vegetable<br>
treatment fats and oils, such as olive oil, sunflower oil, purified soya oil, palm<br>
oil, sesame oil, rapeseed oil, almond oil, borage oil, evening primrose oil,<br>
coconut oil, shea butter, jojoba oil, sperm oil, beef tallow, neatsfood oil and<br>
lard, and also optionally further treatment constituents, such as, for example,<br>
fatty alcohols having 8-30 C atoms. Here the fatty alcohols can be saturated or<br>
unsaturated and straight-chain or branched. For example, decanol, decenol,<br><br>
octanol, octenol, dodecanol, dodecenol, octadienol, decadienol, dodecadienol,<br>
oleyl alcohol, ricinol (sic) alcohol, erucic alcohol, stearyl alcohol, isostearyl<br>
alcohol, cetyl alcohol, lauryl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, arachidyl alcohol, capryl<br>
alcohol, capric alcohol, linoleyl alcohol, linolenyl alcohol and behenyl alcohol,<br>
as well the guerbet alcohols thereof can be used, in which context it would be<br>
possible to extend the list virtually arbitrarily by further structurally chemically<br>
related alcohols. The fatty alcohols preferably originate from natural fatty<br>
acids, and usually are prepared from the corresponding esters of the fatty<br>
acids by reduction. Furthermore, fatty alcohol fractions that are formed from<br>
naturally occurring fats and fat oils by reduction, such as, for example, beef<br>
tallow, peanut oil, colza oil, cottonseed oil, soya oil, sunflower oil, palm kernel<br>
oil, linseed oil, maize oil, castor oil, rapeseed oil, sesame oil, cocoa butter and<br>
cocoa fat, can be used.<br>
In addition, the treatment substances that can preferably be combined with the<br>
diphenylmethane derivatives of the Formula 1 also include<br>
ceramides, ceramides being understood to be N-acylsphingosines (fatty<br>
acid amides of sphingosine) or synthetic analogues of such lipids (so-<br>
called pseudo-ceramides), which clearly improve the water retention<br>
capacity of the stratum corneum.<br>
phospholipids, for example soya lecithin, egg lecithin and cephalins<br>
vaseline, paraffin and silicone oils; the latter include, inter alia, dialkyl-<br>
and alkylaryl-siloxanes, such as dimethylpolysiloxane and<br>
methylphenylpolysiloxane, as well as the alkoxylated and quaternised<br>
derivatives thereof.<br>
Animal and/or vegetable hydrolysed proteins can advantageously also be<br>
added to the diphenylmethane derivatives of the Formula 1. In this regard, in<br>
particular elastin, collagen, keratin, lactoprotein, soya protein, oat protein, pea<br>
protein, almond protein and wheat protein fractions or corresponding<br><br>
hydrolysed proteins, but also the condensation products thereof with fatty<br>
acids, and also quaternised hydrolysed proteins are advantageous, the use of<br>
vegetable hydrolysed proteins being preferred.<br>
Insofar as a cosmetic or dermatological formulation containing<br>
diphenylmethane derivatives of the Formula 1 is a solution or lotion, the<br>
solvents used can advantageously be:<br>
water or aqueous solutions;<br>
fatty oils, fats, waxes and other natural and synthetic fatty bodies,<br>
preferably esters of fatty acids with alcohols having a low C number, for<br>
example with isopropanol, propylene glycol or glycerol, or esters of fatty<br>
alcohols with alkanoic acids having a low C number or with fatty acids;<br>
alcohols, diols or polyols having a low C number, as well as the ethers<br>
thereof, preferably ethanol, isopropanol, propylene glycol, glycerol,<br>
ethylene glycol, ethylene glycol monoethyl or monobutyl ether,<br>
propylene glycol monomethyl, monoethyl or monobutyl ether, diethylene<br>
glycol monomethyl or monoethyl ether and analogous products. In<br>
particular, mixtures of the abovementioned solvents are used.<br>
In the case of alcoholic solvents, water can be a further constituent.<br>
Cosmetic formulations that contain diphenylmethane derivatives of the<br>
Formula 1 can also contain antioxidants, it being possible to use all<br>
antioxidants suitable or customary for cosmetic and/or dermatological<br>
applications. Advantageously, the antioxidants are selected from the group<br>
consisting of amino acids (for example glycine, histidine, tyrosine, tryptophan)<br>
and the derivatives thereof, imidazoles (for example urocanic acid) and the<br>
derivatives thereof, peptides such as D, L-carnosine, D-carnosine, L-carnosine<br>

thiodipropionate, distearyl thiodipropionate, thiodipropionic acid and the<br>
derivatives thereof (esters, ethers, peptides, lipids, nucleotides, nucleosides<br>
and salts) and also sulphoximine compounds (for example buthionine<br>

derivatives (salts, esters, ethers, sugars, nucleotides, nucleosides, peptides<br>
and lipids) of the said active compounds.<br>
Cosmetic formulations that contain diphenylmethane derivatives of the<br>
Formula 1 can advantageously also contain vitamins and vitamin precursors, it<br><br>
being possible to use all vitamins and vitamin precursors suitable or<br>
customary for cosmetic and/or dermatological applications. Mention may be<br>
made here in particular of vitamins and vitamin precursors such as<br>
tocopherols, Vitamin A, nicotinic acid and nicotinomide, further vitamins of the<br>
B complex, in particular biotin, and Vitamin C, pantothenyl alcohol and the<br>
derivatives thereof, in particular esters and ethers of pantothenyl alcohol, and<br>
also derivatives of pantothenyl alcohols obtained cationically, such as, for<br>
example, pantothenyl alcohol triacetate, pantothenyl alcohol, monoethyl ether<br>
and the mono acetate thereof and also cationic pantothenyl alcohol<br>
derivatives.<br>
Cosmetic formulations, which advantageously contain diphenylmethane<br>
derivatives of the Formula 1, can also contain anti-inflammatory active<br>
compounds and/or active compounds that alleviate reddening and/or itching.<br>
In this context all anti-inflammatory active compounds and active compounds<br>
that alleviate reddening and/or itching that are suitable or customary for<br>
cosmetic and/or dermatological applications can be used. Advantageously, the<br>
anti-inflammatory active compounds and active compounds alleviating<br>
reddening and/or itching that are used are steroidal anti-inflammatory<br>
substances of the corticosteroid type, such as, for example, hydrocortisone,<br>
dexamethasone, dexamethasone phosphate, methylprednisolone or cortisone,<br>
it being possible to expand the list by adding further steroidal anti-<br>
inflammatory agents. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents can also be<br>
used. Oxicams, such as piroxicam or tenoxicam; salicylates, such as aspirin,<br>

mentioned here by way of example. Alternatively, natural anti-inflammatory<br>
substances and substances that alleviate reddening and/or itching can be<br>
used. Plant extracts, special highly active plant extract fractions and also<br>
highly pure active substances isolated from plant extracts can be used.<br><br>
Extracts, fractions and active substances from camomile, aloe vera,<br>
Commiphora species, Rubia species, willows, willow-herb, oats and pure<br>
substances such as, inter alia, bisabolol, apigenin-7-glucoside, boswellic acid,<br>

compounds from oats and Echinacea are particularly preferred for use in the<br>
sense of the invention; α-Bisabolol and extracts and isolated highly pure active<br>
compounds from oats are particularly preferred.<br>
The amount of the anti-irritants (one or more compounds) in the formulations<br>
is preferably 0.0001 to 20% (m/m), particularly preferentially 0.0001 -<br>
10% (m/m), in particular 0.001 - 5% (m/m), based on the total weight of the<br>
formulation.<br>
(/osmetic formulations that contain diphenylmethane derivatives of the<br>
Formula 1 can advantageously also contain moisturisers. Moisturisers used<br>
are, for example, the following substances: sodium lactate, urea, alcohols,<br>
sorbitol, glycerol, propylene glycol, collagen, elastin or hyaluronic acid, diacyl<br>
adipates, petroleum jelly, ectoin, urocanic acid, lecithin, pantheol, phytanetriol,<br>

such as, for example, glucose, galactose, fructose, mannose, fructose (sic)<br>
and lactose<br><br>
Cosmetic formulations that contain diphenylmethane derivatives of the<br>
Formula 1 can advantageously also contain plant extracts, which are usually<br>
prepared by extraction of the complete plant, but in individual cases are also<br>
prepared exclusively from blossom and/or leaves, wood, bark or roots of the<br>
plant. With regard to the plant extracts that can be used, reference is made in<br>
particular to the extracts that are listed in the table starting on page 44 of the<br>
third edition of the Leitfaden zur Inhaltsstoffdeklaration kosmetischer Mittel,<br>
(Guide to the Declaration of Constituents of Cosmetic Agents), published by<br>
the Industrieverband Korperpflegemittel und Waschmittel e.V. (IKW),<br>
Frankfurt The extracts from aloe, Hamamelis, algae, oak bark, willow-herb,<br>

and Hamamelis are particularly preferred. Mixtures of two or more plant<br>
extracts can also be employed. Extraction agents that can be used for the<br>
oreparation of the said plant extracts can be, inter alia, water, alcohols and<br>
mixtures thereof. Amongst the alcohols, lower alcohols, such as ethanol and<br>
isopropanol, but also polyhydric alcohols, such as ethylene glycol, propylene<br>
glycol and butylene glycol are preferred in this context, and specifically both as<br>
sole extracting agent and also in mixtures with water. The plant extracts can<br>
be used in the pure form or also in dilute form.<br>
Cosmetic formulations that contain diphenylmethane derivatives of the<br>
Formula 1 can also contain anionic, cationic, non-ionic and/or amphoteric<br>
surfactants, especially if crystalline or microcrystalline solids, for example<br>
inorganic micropigments, are to be incorporated into the formulations.<br>
Surfactants are amphiphilic substances that are able to dissolve organic, non-<br>
polar substances in water. In this context the hydrophilic parts of a surfactant<br><br>
molecule are usually polar functional groups, for example, -COO, -OSO32-,<br>
-SCV, whilst the hydrophobic parts are as a rule non-polar hydrocarbon<br>
radicals. Surfactants are generally classified according to the nature and<br>
charge of the hydrophilic part of the molecule. Four groups can be<br>
differentiated here:<br>
*	anionic surfactants,<br>
*	cationic surfactants,<br><br>
•	amphoteric surfactants and<br>
•	non-ionic surfactants.<br>
Anionic surfactants usually contain carboxylate, sulphate or sulphonate groups<br>
as functional groups. In aqueous solution they form negatively charged<br>
organic ions in the acid or neutral medium. Cationic surfactants are<br>
characterised virtually exclusively by the presence of a quaternary ammonium<br>
group. In aqueous solution they form positively charged organic ions in the<br>
acid or neutral medium. Amphoteric surfactants contain both anionic and<br>
cationic groups and accordingly behave like anionic or cationic surfactants in<br>
aqueous solutions, depending on the pH value. They have a positive charge in<br>
a strongly acid medium and a negative charge in an alkaline medium. In the<br>
neutral pH range, on the other hand, they are zwitter ionic. Polyether chains<br>
are typical of non-ionic surfactants. Non-ionic surfactants do not form ions in<br>
an aqueous medium.<br>
A. Anionic surfactants<br>
Anionic surfactants that can advantageously be used are acylamino acids<br>
(and the salts thereof), such as<br><br>
- acylglutamates, for example, sodium acylgultamate, di-TEA-palmitoyl<br>
aspartate and sodium capryl/caprin glutamate,<br>
acylpeptides, for example, palmitoyl-hydrolysed lactoprotein, sodium<br>
cocoyl-hydrolysed soya protein and sodium/potassium cocoyl-<br>
hydrolysed collagen,<br>
sarcosinates, for example, myristoyl sarcos/'ne, TEA lauroyl sarcosinate,<br>
sodium iauroyl sarcosinate and sodium cocoyl sarcosinate,<br>
taurates, for example, sodium lauroyl taurate and sodium methylcocoyl<br>
taurate,<br>
acyl lactylates, lauroyl lactylate, caproyl lactylate<br>
alaninates<br>
carboxyllc acids and derivatives, such as,<br>
for example, lauric acid, aluminium stearate, magnesium alkanolate and<br>
zinc undecyienate,<br>
ester-carboxylic acids, for example calcium stearoyl lactylate, laureth-6<br>
citrate and sodium PEG-4 lauramidocarboxylate,<br>
ether-carboxylic acids, for example sodium laureth-13 carboxylate and<br>
sodium PEG-6 cocamide carboxylate,<br>
phosphoric acid esters and salts, such as, for example, DEA-oleth-10<br>
phosphate and dilaureth-4 phosphate,<br>
sulphonic acids and salts, such as<br><br>
acyl isothionates, for example sodium/ammonium cocoyl-isethionate,<br>
alkylarylsulphonates,<br>
alkylsulphonates, for example sodium coconut monoglyceride sulphate,<br>
sodium C12-14 olefin-sulphonate sodium lauryl sulphoacetate and<br>
magnesium PEG-3 cocamidosulphate,<br>
sulphosuccinates, for example, dioctylsodium sulphosuccinate, disodium<br>
laureth-sulphosuccinate, disodium laurylsulphosuccinate and disodium<br>
undecylenamido MEA-sulphosuccinate<br>
and<br>
sulphuric acid esters, such as<br>
alkyl ether sulphate, for example, sodium, ammonium, magnesium,<br>
MIPA, TIPA laureth sulphate, sodium myreth sulphate and sodium C12-<br>
13 pareth sulphate,<br>
alkyl sulphates, for exmaple, sodium, ammonium and TEA lauryl<br>
sulphate.<br>
B. Cationic surfactants<br>
Cationic surfactants that can advantageously be used are<br>
-	alkylamines,<br>
-	alkylimidazoles,<br>
-	ethoxylated amines and<br><br>
-	quaternary surfactants<br>
RNH2CH2CH2COO' (at pH=7)<br>
RNHCH2CH2COO- B+ (at pH=12) B+ = arbitrary cation, for example Na+<br>
-	esterquats<br>
Quaternary surfactants contain at least one N atom that is covalently bonded<br>
to 4 alkyl or aryl groups. This leads to a positive charge, irrespective of the pH<br>
value. Alkylbetaine, alkylamidopropylbetaine and alkylamidopropyl<br>
hydroxysulfaine are advantageous. The cationic surfactants used can<br>
furthermore preferably be chosen from the group comprising the quaternary<br>
ammonium compounds, in particular benzyltrialkyl-ammonium chloride or<br>
bromide, such as, for example, benzyldimethylstearyl-ammonium chloride<br>
and also alkyltrialkylammonium salts, for example cetyltrimethylammonium<br>
chloride or bromide, alkyldimethylhydroxy-ethylammonium chlorides or<br>
bromides, dialkyldimethylammonium chlorides or bromides, alkylamidoethyl-<br>
trimethyl-ammonium ether sulphates, alkylpyridinium salts, for example lauryl-<br>
or cetyi-pyrimidinium chloride, imidazoline derivatives and compounds of a<br>
cationic nature, such as amine oxides, for example alkyldimethylamine oxides<br>
or alkylaminoethyldimethylamine oxides. Cetyltrimethyl-ammonium salts can<br>
be used particularly advantageously.<br>
C. Amphoteric surfactants<br>
Amphoteric surfactants that can advantageously be used are<br>
acyl-/dialkylethylenediamine, for example sodium acylamphoacetate,<br>
disodium acylamphodipropionate, disodium alkylamphodiacetate,<br>
sodium acylamphohydroxy-propylsulphonate, disodium acylampho-<br>
diacetate and sodium acylamphopropionate,<br><br>
N-alkylamino acids, for example aminopropylalkylglutamide,<br>
alkylaminopropionic acid, sodium alkylimidodipropionate and<br>
lauroamphocarboxyglycinate.<br>
D. Non-ionic surfactants<br>
Non-ionic surfactants that can advantageously be used are<br>
alcohols,<br>
alkanolamides, such as cocamides MEA/ DEA/ MIPA,<br>
amine oxides, such as cocoamidopropylamine oxide,<br>
esters, that are formed by esterification of carboxylic acids with ethylene<br>
oxide, glycerol, sorbitan or other alcohols,<br>
ethers, for example ethoxylated/propoxylated alcohols, ethoxylated/<br>
propoxylated esters, ethoxylated/propoxylated glycerol esters,<br>
ethoxylated/ propoxylated cholesterols, ethoxylated/propoxylated<br>
triglyceride esters, ethoxylated [lacuna] propoxylated lanolin,<br>
ethoxylated/propoxylated polysiloxanes, propoxylated POE ethers and<br>
alkylpolyglycosides, such as lauryl glucoside, decyl glycoside and coco<br>
glycoside.<br>
sucrose esters and ethers<br>
polyglycerol esters, diglycerol esters, monoglycerol esters<br>
methylglucose esters, ester of hydroxy acids<br>
The use of a combination of anionic and/or amphoteric surfactants with one or<br>
more non-ionic surfactants is also advantageous.<br><br>
The surface-active substance can be present in a concentration of between 1<br>
and 98% (m/m) in the formulations according to the invention containing<br>
diphenylmethane derivatives of the Formula 1, based on the total weight of the<br>
formulations.<br>
Cosmetic or dermatological formulations that contain diphenylmethane<br>
derivatives of the Formula 1 according to the invention can also be in the form<br>
of emulsions.<br>
The oil phase can advantageously be chosen from the following group of<br>
substances:<br>
mineral oils, mineral waxes<br>
fatty oils, fats, waxes and other natural and synthetic fatty bodies,<br>
preferably esters of fatty acids with alcohols having a low C number, for<br>
example with isopropanol, propylene glycol or glycerol, or esters of fatty<br>
alcohols with alkanoic acids having a low C number or with fatty acids;<br>
alkyl benzoates;<br>
silicone oils, such as dimethylpolysiloxanes, diethylpolysiloxanes,<br>
diphenylpolysiloxanes and mixed forms therefrom.<br>
Advantageously, (a) esters of saturated and/or unsaturated, branched and/or<br>
straight-chain alkanecarboxylic acids having a chain length of 3 to 30 C atoms<br>
and saturated and/or unsaturated, branched and/or straight-chain alcohols<br>
having a chain length of 3 to 30 C atoms, (b) esters of aromatic carboxylic<br>
acids and saturated and/or unsaturated, branched and/or straight-chain<br>
alcohols having a chain length of 3 to 30 C atoms can be used. Preferred<br>
ester oils are isopropyl myristate, isopropyl palmitate, isopropyl stearate,<br>
isopropyl oleate, n-butyl stearate, n-hexyl laurate, n-decyl oleate, isooctyl<br>
stearate, isononyl stearate, isononyl isononanoate, 2-ethylhexyl palmitate, 2-<br><br>
ethylhexyl laurate, 2-hexyldecyl stearate, 2-octyldodecyl palmitate, oleyi<br>
oleate, oleyl erucate, erucyl oleate, erucyl erucate and synthetic, semi-<br>
synthetic and natural mixtures of such esters, for example, jojoba oil.<br>
Furthermore, the oil phase can advangaeously be chosen from the group<br>
comprising the branched and straight-chain hydrocarbons and waxes, the<br>
silicone oils, the dialkyl ethers, the group comprising the saturated or<br>
unsaturated, branched or straight-chain alcohols, and also the fatty acid<br>
triglycerides, specifically, the triglycerol esters of saturated and/or unsaturated,<br>
branched and/or straight-chain alkanecarboxylic acids having a chain length of<br>
8 to 24, in particular 12 to 18 C atoms. The fatty acid triglycerides can<br>
advantageously be chosen from the group comprising the synthetic, semi-<br>
synthetic and natural oils, for example, olive oil, sunflower oil, soya oil, peanut<br>
oil, rapeseed oil, almond oil, palm oil, coconut oil, palm kernel oil and more of<br>
the like. Arbitrary admixtures of such oil and wax components can also<br>
advantageously be used. In some cases it is also advantageous to use waxes,<br>
for example cetyl palmitate, as the sole lipid component of the oil phase;<br>
advantageously, the oil phase is chosen from the group that consists of 2-<br>
ethylhexyl isostearate, octyldodecanol, isotridecyl isononanoate, isoeicosane,<br>
2-ethylhexyl cocoate, C12-15-alkyl benzoate, capryl-capric acid triglyceride and<br>
dicaprylyl ether. Mixtures of C12-15-alkyl benzoate and 2-ethylhexyl isostearate,<br>
mixtures of C12-15-alkyl benzoate and isotridecyl isononanoate and mixtures of<br>
C12-15-alkyl benzoate, 2-ethylhexyl isostearate and isotridecyl isononanoate<br>
are particularly advantageous. The hydrocarbons paraffin oil, squalane and<br>
squalene can also advantageously be used. Advantageously, the oil phase<br>
can furthermore contain cyclic or linear silicone oils or consist entirely of such<br>
oils, it being, however, preferred to use an additional content of other oil phase<br>
components in addition to the silicone oil or the silicone oils. Cyclomethicone<br>
(for example, decamethylcyclopentasiloxane) can advantageously be used as<br>
silicone oil. However, other silicone oils can also advantageously be used, for<br>
example undecamethylcyclotrisiloxane, polydimethylsiloxane and poly(methyl-<br>
phenylsiloxane). Furthermore, mixtures of cyclomethicone and isotridecyl<br><br>

Preferred embodiments and further aspects of the present invention can be<br>
seen from the appended patent claims and the following examples.<br><br>
Example 1:<br>
Experiments to determine the tvrosinase-inhibitinq action of stvrvlresorcinol (4)<br>
The finding that diphenylmethane derivatives of the Formula 1 (where R 1-5<br>
can each have the meanings indicated above) are outstanding for use as<br>
agents for skin lightening and for combating age spots results from the<br>
following experiments, which were carried out on 3T3 fibrosarcoma cells or<br>
B16V mouse melanoma cells.<br>
A. (Cytotoxicity determination)<br>
3T3 fibrosarcoma cells or B16V mouse melanoma cells are distributed in a 96-<br>
well microtitre plate in a concentration of 1 x 104 cells/well (3T3) or 2 x 104<br>
cells/well (B16V). After culturing for 24 h at 37°C and 5 % C02 in DMEM<br>
medium (3T3 cells) or RPMI medium (B16V cells), enriched with 10 % foetal<br>
calf serum, the medium is removed by suction. Various concentrations of the<br>
test substances, dissolved in fresh medium enriched with 5% foetal calf<br>
serum, are added and the plates are incubated for a further 48 h. A parallel<br>
incubation is carried out using SDS as standard in concentrations of 0.01 mM,<br>
0.1 mM, 1 mM and 10 mM. After the incubation, the medium is removed by<br>
suction and the cells are incubated for with (sic) 2 h with MTT (3-[4,5-<br>
dimethylthiazol-2-yl]2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide). After extraction of the<br>
dye with SDS acidified with acetic acid in DMSO (10 min), the absorption (A)<br>
at 570 nm is measured.<br>
Average value and standard deviation of the controls, the blanks and the<br>
samples are calculated. The average value of the blanks is substracted from<br>
the average values of the controls and samples. The viability of the cells is<br>
indicated as a percentage with respect to the controls (100 %):<br>
Viability (%) = (Atestcompound/Acontrol) X 100]<br><br>
Table 1: Cytotoxicity (MTT/LDH assay, 3T3 fibroblasts and B16V mouse<br>
melanoma cells) - IC50and IC20 values for styrylresorcinol, 4-hexylresorcinol<br>
and kojic acid.<br><br>
The cytotoxicological experiments show that styrylresorcinol has a relatively<br>
low cytotoxicity, which is approximately comparable to the cytotoxicity of 4-<br>
hexylresorcinol, which, inter alia, is also used in food chemistry.<br>
B IC50 values for styrylresorcinol (4) compared with koiic acid and 4-<br>
hexvlresorcinol<br>
The IC50 values of styrylresorcinol (4), kojic acid and 4-hexylresorcinol were<br>
determined in accordance with the general test conditions described below<br>
and summarised in Table 2.<br>
Test method: B16V mouse melanoma cells are distributed in a 96-well micro<br>
litre plate in a concentration of 5 x 103 cells/well. After culturing for 24 h at<br>
37°C and 5% C02 in RPMI medium, enriched with 10 % foetal calf serum,<br>
various concentrations of the test substances and 10 nM a-MSH (a-<br><br>
melanocyte stimulating hormone) are added and the plates are incubated for a<br>
further 96 h. The maximum concentration of the test substances used<br>
corresponds to 0.1 times the value of the particular IC20 value from the<br>
cytotoxicity assay. A parallel incubation was carried out with kojic acid as<br>
standard in concentrations of 0.01 mM, 0.1 mM and 1 mM. After the<br>
incubation, SDS and NaOH (final concentrations: 1mM and 1M, respectively)<br>
are added to the culture medium and the adsorption (A) is measured at 400<br>
im after 3 h.<br>
The inhibition of the pigmentation in the presence of the test compounds or<br>
kojic acid was calculated in accordance with the following equation:<br>
Inhibition of pigmentation (%) = 100- [ (Atestcompound/Acontrol)x 100]<br>
The IC50 is calculated for each test compound from the inhibition of the<br>
pigmentation (%) in a series of dilutions of test compounds. The IC50 is the<br>
concentration of a test compound at which the pigmentation is 50% inhibited.<br>
Table 2: Lightening effect (B16V mouse melanoma cells) - IC50 values for<br>
styrylresorcinol, 4-hexylresorcinol and kojic acid<br><br>
As Table 2 shows, styrylresorcinol significantly inhibits the tyrosinase activity<br>
in very low concentrations and is thus outstandingly suitable for use as an<br><br>
agent for skin and hair lightening and for combating age spots. Compared with<br>
kojic acid, an active compound that is already frequently used in cosmetic<br>
products for skin and hair lightening and for controlling age spots, which,<br>
however, is not entirely toxicologically acceptable, styrylresorcinol (Formula 4)<br>
according to the invention has an activity that is greater by a factor of<br>
approximately 215. Compared with 4-hexylresorcinol, styrylresorcinol<br>
(Formula 4) still proves to be more than twice as effective. Accordingly, the<br>
effect of 4-hexylresorcinol compared with kojic acid is also only approximately<br>
87 times as great.<br>
The experiments discussed above clearly show that diphenylmethane<br>
derivatives of the Formula 1 (where R1 to R5 have the meanings indicated<br>
above and what has been stated above also applies in respect of the preferred<br>
meanings of R1 to R5) severely inhibit tyrosinase and thus are outstandingly<br>
suitable for use as skin and hair lightening agents, for combating age spots<br>
and/or as browning inhibitors in food chemistry.<br><br>
