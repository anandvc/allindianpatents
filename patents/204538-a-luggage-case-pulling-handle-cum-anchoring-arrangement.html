APPLICANTS<br>
VIP INDUSTRIES LTD, 78A MIDC,<br>
Satpur, Nashik - 422 007, Maharashtra, India, an Indian Company<br>
INVENTOR<br>
Naik Shashank Sharad, an Indian national, VIP Industries Limited, 78A MIDC, Satpur, Nashik-422007, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the<br>
manner in which it is to be performed :<br><br>
GRANTED     30-7-2004<br>
5 MAY 2004 	.<br><br><br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a luggage case pulling handle cum anchoring arrangement.<br>
The term luggage case wherever used in the specification includes suitcase with or without the reinforcing metallic frame around the sidewall of the bottom shell thereof. The reference to sidewall of the bottom shell of a luggage case includes the reinforcing metallic frame around the side wall.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
To facilitate movement of a luggage case from place to place, it is usually provided with a rolling mechanism at the bottom thereof. In one configuration of the rolling mechanism, a pair of fixed direction wheels are fitted at the bottom corner at one end of a luggage case. Another configuration of the rolling mechanism comprises a pair of fixed direction wheels fitted at the bottom comer at one end of a luggage. A pair of swivelling wheels are fitted at the bottom of the luggage between the centre<br>
2<br><br>
and the other end thereof. A third configuration of the rolling mechanism comprises a pair of fixed direction wheels fitted at the bottom corner at one end of a luggage case. A pair of swiveling wheels are fitted at the bottom of the luggage case about the centre thereof. A further pair of swiveling wheels are fitted at the bottom of the luggage case towards the other end thereof. Luggage cases fitted with such rolling mechanisms are provided with a pulling handle at the other end thereof. The pulling handle may be an oblong member integrally formed with an eye for grip at one end thereof and hinged at the other end top corner of the luggage case. Alternatively the pulling handle may be an oblong member or a staple member hinged at the other end top corner of the luggage case. Alternatively the pulling handle may be a slider member housed at the other end top corner of the luggage case adapted to be shd in or out. A fourth rolling mechanism comprises two pairs of swiveling wheels fitted at the bottom of a luggage case which is provided with a pulling string or strap at one end thereof. A luggage case fitted with any one of the first three roller mechanisms is moved by first tilting up the luggage case from its other end,<br><br>
where the handle is provided, by holding the handle so that only the fixed direction wheels at the one end bottom corner of the luggage case are resting on the floor. The luggage case is then moved on the fixed direction wheels by holding the handle and pulling it. A luggage case fitted with the fourth roller mechanism is moved on the swiveling wheels by simply holding the string or strap and pulling it. Because of the flexibility of the string or strap, no tilting of the luggage case is necessary as in the earlier case.<br>
In order to prevent theft of a luggage case, especially in crowded places like bus or railway stations or in long distance trains, a fastening device has been described in our Jndian Patent No 163690 (296/BOM/86). It comprises one or two channel members, each having a pair of spaced apart flanges and an interconnecting web provided with a longitudinal slot originating from one end thereof. It also comprises a flexible entwining member provided with a pair of double headed buttons one at each end thereof adapted to be vertically slidably located in the longitudinal slot. The entwining member is completely detachable and is required to be carried separately.<br>
4<br><br>
There is also described in our patent application nos 629/MUM/2000 and 79/MUM/2001 a luggage case anchoring system comprising a casing rigidly fitted in the luggage case. A flat spiral spring tensioned spool is rotatably mounted in the casing. A releasable stopper for the spool is located in the casing and is accessible from outside the luggage case. A cable is wound on the spool with its inner end rigidly fixed to the spool. The outer end of the cable is accessibly exposed and is movable in and out of the casing and the luggage case through openings in the casing and is adapted to be releasably fastened to interlocking means provided on the luggage case.<br>
The above mentioned pulling handles and string or strap and anchoring device or system are independent and separate units and function independently separately. The handles and string or strap are only for pulling purpose and the anchoring device or system is only for  anchoring purpose.<br>
The pulling handle  cum  anchoring arrangement  of the   invention serves the dual purpose of handle and anchoring of the luggage case. It is versatile and suitable for use with luggage cases fitted with all types of roller mechanisms.   It is compact and simple in construction and easy to handle and operate.<br><br>

As illustrated in Figs 1 to 9 of the accompanying drawings, 1 is a luggage case whose bottom shell and top shell are marked 2 and 3 respectively. (Figs 1, 2, 3 and 4) The sidewall of the bottom shell of the luggage case is marked 4. Where the luggage case is with reinforcing metallic frame the reference numeral 4 indicates the metallic frame around the side wall of the bottom shell of the luggage case. The other features or parts of the luggage case have not been illustrated and described as such are not necessary for understanding the invention. The luggage case may be provided with anyone of the four roller mechanisms (not shown) described in the prior art. 5 is a pulling handle cum anchoring arrangement comprising a handle 6 comprising an oblong portionJSyintegrally formed with a curved portion 9 at one end thereof (Fig 9). The handle also comprises a staple member 10 corresponding to the curved portion (Fig 9). One end of the staple member is provided with a wedge 10a disposed in a cleave 9a of   cleft portion  9b  at  one end  of the<br>
9<br><br>
curved portion. The one end of the staple member is pivoted at the one end of the curved portion using pivot pin member 11 running through pivot holes 12 and pivot hole 13 in the one ends of the curved portion and staple member respectively (Figs 9). 14 is a key operated spring loaded multilever barrel lock located in a socket 15 provided at the other end of staple member (Figs 7, 8 and 9). The barrel lock has a T-shaped extension 16 at the inner end thereof. The crossflange of the T-shaped extension of the barrel lock is marked 17. The key hole at the outer end of the barrel lock is marked 18. The spring loaded levers of the barrel lock are marked 19. The socket is provided with spaced close ended partial radial grooves 20 corresponding to the levers of the barrel lock. 21 is an oblong slot at the other end of the curved portion corresponding to the cross flange 17 of the T-shaped extension of the barrel lock (Figs 7, 8 and 9) The barrel lock is of known construction and works in known manner. The handle is moulded plastics such as polypropelene or nylon. The oblong portion comprises four spaced ribs 22a, 22b, 22c and 22d along the length of (he oblong portion at the inner side thereof (Fig 9). The outer ends of the ribs are provided with heads 23a,. 23b, 23c and 23d respectively. 24 is a double headed metal<br>
10<br><br>
insert such as mild steel fitted between the two inner ribs 22b and 22c using screw 25 passing through hole 26 in insert 24 and secured in a threaded hole (not shown) in boss 27 at the inner side of the oblong portion 8(Fig 9). 28 is a pivot pin fitted in holes 29a, 29b, 29c and 29d in heads 23a, 23b, 23c and 23d of the ribs respectively and holes 30a and 30b in the heads 30c and 30d respectively of the insert. A pair of spaced brackets 31, 31 are provided on a base plate 32 which is fitted to the sidewall 4 of the bottom shell of the luggage case at the top comer at one end of the luggage using rivets 33 secured through rivet holes 34 in the base plate and corresponding rivet holes 35 in the sidewall 4 (Figs 5 and 9). The base plate and brackets are metallic such as stainless steel. The brackets 31 are provided with open L-slots 36 (Figs 5, 6 and 9), The tapered heads 23b and 23c of the inner ribs 22b and 22c are larger (Figs 5, 6 and 9). The tapered heads of the inner ribs and open L-slots are so adapted as to detachably engage and pivot the pivot pin in the L-slots thereby detachably pivoting the other end of the oblong portion of the handle at the said corner of the luggage case (Figs 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6). The handle is disengaged and detached from the brackets by lifting up the other end of the oblong portion of the handle and removing the<br><br>
pivot pin from the open L-slots through the open ends of the slots (Fig 6). Due to the other end of the oblong portion of the handle being pivoted at the said corner of the luggage case, the handle is free to be moved up and down about the pivot. The handle is pivoted in the L-slots in the brackets by aligning the pivot pin at the other end of the oblong portion of the handle with the open ends of the L-slots and moving the handle down to engage the pivot pin in the L-slots (Figs 5 and 6). 37 is a retractable string located within a housing 38 whose front side is partially open (Figs 5 and 9). 39 is a retainer plate provided with an angular lip 40 at one end (Fig 9). The retainer plate is disposed at the open front side of the housing and fitted to the housing by engaging the angular lip in a corresponding slot 41 at the corresponding end of the housing (Fig 9). The housing with retainer plate is fitted internally to the sidewall 4 of the bottom shell of the case at the said corner of the luggage case by rivets 33 secured through rivet holes 42 in the retainer plate and by screw 43 passing through hole 44 in the sidewall 4 and secured in a screw hole (not shown) at the front side of the housing (Fig 9). The inner and outer ends of the string are fitted with thimbles 45 and 46 with holes 47 and 48 respectively. The outer end of the<br><br>
string is fixed to the pivot pin 28 and thus to the handle through hole 48 in thimble 46. The string is stressed by compression spring 49 whose one end is fixed to the inner end of the string by entangling it to the thimble 45 through hole 47 in the thimble 45 (Fig 9). The other end of the spring is anchored on a boss 50 provided on the closed front side inner face of the housing (Fig 9). The string bears against roller 51 rotatably mounted between spaced lateral projections 52 and 53 on the retainer plate using pin member 54 passing through holes 55 and 56 in the lateral projections respectively and hole 57 in the roller (Fig 9). The string passes through corresponding openings 58, 59 and 60 in the retainer plate, sidewall of the bottom shell of the luggage case and base plate, respectively (Fig 9). 61 is a rubber bush fitted in the openings 58,59 and 60 (Fig 9). The metal insert reinforces the inner ribs 22b and 22c. During up and down movement of the handle about the pivot provided by the pivot pin in the open L-slots the plastic outer surfaces of the inner ribs 22b and 22c touch the metallic brackets. Therefore, up and down movement of the handle is noise free. The rubber bush provides a smooth surface for the string and avoids damage to the string. A chain, wire rope, strap or the like may be used instead of string.<br><br>
Normally the other ends of the curved portion and staple member remain locked and the cross flange of the T-shaped extension of the barrel lock remains across the sidewalls of the oblong slot at the other end of the curved portion in close contact therewith and the handle remains closed against the luggage case (Figs 1, 2 and 7). To use the handle tor pulling a luggage case fitted with any one of the first three roller mechanisms described in the prior art, the handle is moved up about its pivot by holding the staple member by hand (Fig 3) and the luggage case is turned up about its one corner such that the fixed direction wheels rest on the floor and the luggage case is moved by holding the handle. To use the handle for pulling a luggage case fitted with the fourth roller mechanism described in the prior art the handle is disengaged from its pivot as described earlier and moved away against the spring tension (Fig 2). The handle is held by hand and the luggage case is pulled to move it. Due to the flexibility of the string, the swiveling wheels of the luggage case continue to remain on the floor while the luggage case is moved. On releasing the hold on the handle the string with the handle retracts under spring contraction and the handle is pivoted in the open L-slots as described earlier. While not in use, the handle is turned<br>
14<br><br>
down about its pivot and closed against the luggage case. The roller 51 facilitates and smoothens the back and forth movement of the spring. The luggage case is anchored to a rigid or fixed member such as leg of a seat in a train (not shown) or post (not shown) by first moving up the handle about its pivot and detaching it from its pivot if necessary. The other ends of the curved portion and staple member are unlocked by inserting a key (not shown) in the barrel lock through the key hole and turning the key in the clockwise direction when the spring stressed levers move in and disengage from the close ended radial grooves and facilitates rotation of the barrel lock in the socket in the clockwise direction. The T-shaped extension of the barrel lock also rotates with the barrel lock in the clockwise direction and disengages from the sidewalls of the oblong slot at the other end of the curved portion and positions itself along the oblong slot and is free to be moved out of the other end of the curved portion (Fig 8). The other end of the staple member is disengaged from the other end of the curved portion and moved out about the pivot at the one ends of the curved portion and staple member provided by the pivot member. The curved portion and staple member are positioned around the rigid or fixed<br><br>
member and the other ends of the curved portion and staple member are brought together. The T-shaped extension of the barrel lock passes through the oblong slot in the other end of the curved portion and lies behind the oblong slot. On rotating the barrel lock in the anticlockwise direction using the key and aligning the levers with the close ended radial grooves, the levers move out under spring tension and engage themselves in the radial grooves and the cross flange of the T-shaped extension of the barrel lock engages across the sidewalls of the oblong slot at the other end of the curved portion in close contact therewith thereby locking the other ends of the curved portion and staple member and anchoring the luggage case to the rigid or fixed member. The key is retracted from the barrel lock. The luggage case is disengaged from the rigid or fixed member by unlocking the other ends of the curved portion and staple member and moving out the staple member about the pivot at the one end thereof. The string provides additional length for the handle in case the rigid or fixed member is located at a distance from the luggage case to be anchored.<br>
According to the invention the pulling handle cum anchoring<br>
16<br><br>
arrangement serves the dual purpose of handle and anchoring for the luggage case. It is versatile and suitable for use with luggage cases fitted with all types of roller mechanisms. It is compact and simple in construction and easy to handle and operate.<br>
The handle may be non-removably pivoted at the said corner of the luggage case and may not be detachable. It can still be used as handle for a luggage case fitted with any one of the first three roller mechanisms described in the prior art and also for anchoring. The retractable string assembly is thus optional. Instead of the retractable string assembly, the anchoring system of applications Nos 629/MUM/2000 and 79/MUM/2001 may be used. The locking means at the other ends of the curved portion and staple member may be of a different construction. The other end of the oblong portion of the handle may be detachably pivoted at the said corner of the luggage case by a different arrangement. The housing may be of different construction. The roller is optional. The plastic handle may have metal insert inside to increase its strength. Such variations of the invention are to be construed and understood to be within the scope of the invention.<br>
