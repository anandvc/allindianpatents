"BLOCK COPOLYMERS FOR RECOVERING HYDROCARBON FLUIDS FROM A<br>
SXJBTERRANEAN RESERVOIR"<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0001] In the first stage of hydrocarbon recovery the sources of energy present in the<br>
reservoir are allowed to move the oil, gas, condensate etc. to the producing wells(s) where they<br>
can flow or be pumped to the surface handling facility. A relatively small proportion of the<br>
hydrocarbon in place can usually be recovered by this means. The most widely used solution to<br>
the problem of maintaining the energy in the reservoir and ensuring that hydrocarbon is driven to<br>
the producing well(s) is to inject fluids down adjacent wells. This is commonly known as<br>
secondary recovery.<br>
[0002] The fluids normally used are water (such as aquifer water, river water, sea water,<br>
or produced water), or gas (such as produced gas, carbon dioxide, flue gas and various others). If<br>
the fluid encourages movement of normally immobile residual oil or other hydrocarbon, the<br>
process is commonly termed tertiary recovery.<br>
[0003] A very prevalent problem with secondary and tertiary recovery projects relates to<br>
the heterogeneity of the reservoir rock strata. The mobility of the injected fluid is commonly<br>
different from the hydrocarbon and when it is more mobile various mobility control processes<br>
have been used to make the sweep of the reservoir more uniform and the consequent<br>
hydrocarbon recovery more efficient. Such processes have limited value when high permeability<br>
zones, commonly called thief zones or streaks, exist within the reservoir rock. The injected fluid<br>
has a low resistance route from the injection to the production well. In such cases the injected<br>
fluid does not effectively sweep the hydrocarbon fluids from adjacent, lower permeability zones.<br>
When the produced fluid is re-used this can lead to fluid cycling through the thief zone to little<br>
benefit and at great cost in temas of fiiel and maintenance of the pumping system.<br>
[0004] Numerous physical and chemical methods have been used to divert injected fluids<br>
out of thief zones in or near production and injection wells. When the treatment is applied to a<br>
producing well it is usually termed a water (or gas etc.) shut-off treatment. When it is applied to<br>
an injection well it is termed a profile control or conformance control treatment.<br>
[0005] In cases where the thief zone(s) are isolated from the lower permeability adjacent<br>
zones and when the completion in the well forms a good seal with the barrier (such as a shale<br>
layer or "stringer") causing the isolation, mechanical seals or "plugs" can be set in the well to<br>
1<br>
block the entrance of the injected fluid. If the fluid enters or leaves the formation from the<br>
bottom of the well, cement can also be used to fill up the well bore to above the zone of ingress.<br>
[0006] When the completion of the well allows the injected fluid to enter both the thief<br>
and the adjacent zones, such as when a casing is cemented against the producing zone and the<br>
cement job is poorly accomplished, a cement squeeze is often a suitable means of isolating the<br>
watered out zone.<br>
[0007] Certain cases are not amenable to such methods by virtue of the facts that<br>
communication exists between layers of the reservoir rock outside the reach of cement. Typical<br>
examples of this are when fractures or rubble zones or washed out caverns exist behind the<br>
casing. In such instances chemical gels, capable of moving through pores in reservoir rock have<br>
been applied to seal off the swept out zones.<br>
[0008] When such methods fail the only alternatives remaining are to produce the well<br>
with poor recovery rate, sidetrack the well away from the prematurely swept zone, or the<br>
abandon the well. Occasionally the producing well is converted to a fluid injector to increase the<br>
field injection rate above the net hydrocarbon extraction rate and increase the pressure in the<br>
reservoir. This can lead to improved overall recovery but it is worthy of note that the injected<br>
fluid will mostly enter the thief zone at the new injector and is likely to cause similar problems in<br>
nearby wells. All of these are expensive options.<br>
[0009] Near wellbore conformance control methods always fail v^iien the thief zone is in<br>
widespread contact with the adjacent, hydrocarbon containing, lower permeability zones. The<br>
reason for this is that the injected fluids can bypass the treatment and re-enter the thief zone<br>
having only contacted a very small proportion, or even none of the remaining hydrocarbon. It is<br>
commonly known amongst those skilled in the art, that such near wellbore treatments do not<br>
succeed in significantly improving recovery in reservoirs having crossflow of the injected fluids<br>
between zones.<br>
[0010] A few processes have been developed with the aim of reducing the permeability in<br>
a substantial proportion of the thief zone and, or at a significant distance from the injection and<br>
production wells. One example of this is the Deep Diverting Gel process patented by Morgan et<br>
al (1). This has been used in the field and suffered from sensitivity to unavoidable variations in<br>
quality of the reagents which resulted in poor propagation. The gelant mixture is a two<br>
component formulation and it is believed that this contributed to poor propagation of the<br>
treatment into the formation.<br>
[0011] The use of swellable cross linked superabsorbent polymer microparticles for<br>
modifying the permeability of subterranean formations is disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,465,792<br>
2<br>
and 5,735,349. However, swelling of the superabsorbent microparticles described therein is<br>
induced by changes of the carrier fluid from hydrocarbon to aqueous or from water of high<br>
salinity to water of low salinity.<br>
[0012] Cross linked, expandable polymeric microparticles and their use for modifying the<br>
permeability of subterranean formations and increasing the mobilization and/or recovery rate of<br>
hydrocarbon fluids present in the formation are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,454,003 Bl;<br>
6,709,402 B2; 6,984,705 B2 and 7,300,973 B2 and in published U.S. Patent Application No.<br>
2007/0204989 Al.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0013] We have discovered novel polymeric microparticles in which the microparticle<br>
conformation is constrained by reversible (l^^bile) internal crosslinks. The microparticle<br>
properties; such as particle size distribution and density, of the constrained microparticle are<br>
designed to allow efficient propagation through the pore structure of hydrocarbon reservoir<br>
matrix rock, such as sandstone. On heating to reservoir temperature and/or at a predetermined<br>
pH, the reversible (labile) internal cross links start to break allowing the particle to expand by<br>
absorbing the injection fluid (normally water).<br>
[0014] The ability of the particle to expand from its original size (at the point of<br>
injection) depends only on the presence of conditions that induce the breaking of the labile cross<br>
linker. The particles of this invention can propagate through the porous structure of the reservoir<br>
without using a designated fluid or fluid with salinity higher than the reservoir fluid.<br>
[0015] The expanded particle is engineered to have a particle size distribution and<br>
physical characteristics, for example, particle rheology, which allow it to impede the flow of<br>
injected fluid in the pore structure. In doing so it is capable of diverting chase fluid into less<br>
thoroughly swept zones of the reservoir.<br>
[0016] The rheology and expanded particle size of the particle can be designed to suit the<br>
reservoir target, for example by suitable selection of the backbone monomers or comonomer ratio<br>
of the polymer, or the degree of reversible (labile) and irreversible cross linking introduced<br>
during manufacture.<br>
[0017] In an embodiment, the present disclosure is directed to compositions comprising<br>
highly cross linked expandable polymeric microparticles having unexpanded volume average<br>
particle size diameters of from about 0.05 to about 5,000 microns and cross linking agent<br>
contents of from about 100 to about 200,000 ppm of labile cross linkers and from 0 to about 300<br>
3<br>
ppm of non-labile cross linkers, wherein the expandable polymeric microparticles have a block<br>
copolymer structure that includes at least two different monomers having different chemical<br>
structures.<br>
[0018] In alternative embodiments, methods for using the above compositions are also<br>
provided.<br>
[0019] Additional features and advantages are described herein, and will be apparent<br>
from the following Detailed Description.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0020] "Amphoteric polymeric microparticle" means a cross-linked polymeric<br>

2-methyl propanesulfonic acid sodiimi salt is more preferred.<br>
[0023] "Anionic polymeric microparticle" means a cross-linked polymeric microparticle<br>
containing a net negative charge. Representative anionic polymeric microparticles include<br>
4<br>
copolymers of acrylamide and 2-acrylamido-2-methyl propane sulfonic acid, copolymers of<br>
acrylamide and sodium acrylate, terpolymers of acrylamide, 2-acrylamido-2-methyl propane<br>
sulfonic acid and sodium acrylate and homopolymers of 2-acrylaniido-2-methyl propane sulfonic<br>
acid. Preferred anionic polymeric microparticles are prepared from about 95 to about 10 mole<br>
percent of nonionic monomers and from about 5 to about 90 mole percent anionic monomers.<br>
More preferred anionic polymeric microparticles are prepared from about 95 to about 10 mole<br>
percent acrylamide and from about 5 to about 90 mole percent 2-acrylamido-2-methyl propane<br>
sulfonic acid.<br>
[0024] "Betaine-containing polymeric microparticle" means a cross-linked polymeric<br>
microparticle prepared by polymerizing a betaine monomer and one or more nonionic monomers.<br>
[0025] "Betaine monomer" means a monomer containing cationically and anionically<br>
charged functionality in equal proportions, such that the monomer is net neutral overall.<br>
Representative betaine monomers include N,N-dimethyl-N-acryloyioxyethyl-N-(3-sulfopropyl)-<br>
ammonium betaine, N,N-dimethyl-N-methacryloyloxyethyl-N-(3-sulfopropyl)-ammonium<br>
betaine, N,N-dimethyI-N-acrylamidopropyl-N-(2-carboxymethyl)-ammonium betaine, N,Ndunethyl-<br>

monomer is N,N-dimethyl-N-methacryloyloxyethyl-N-(3-sulfopropyl)-ammonium betaine.<br>
[0026] "Block copolymers" means any type of long sequences of the same monomer unit<br>
bound by covalent bonds. The blocks can be connected in a variety of ways. Examples of block<br>
copolymers include, but are not limited to, segmented blocks, random blocks, di-blocks, triblocks,<br>
alternating blocks, periodic blocks, amphiphilic blocks, statistical blocks, star<br>
blocks and comb blocks. Synthetic details on each type of block varies. However, the varied<br>
synthetic details may provide distinctive performance advantages in application. Recently, block<br>
copolymer synthesis has received a greater amount of attention because of controlled radical<br>
polymerizations, mcluding, for example, atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), nitroxidemediated<br>
radical polymerization (NMP), and revisible addition fragmentation chain transfer<br>
polymerization (RAFT); See, Braunecker, W. A. et al. Prog. Polym. Sci. 2007, 32, 93. These<br>
new methods provide better control over the block synthesis, as well as synthesis of<br>
novel block copolymers. There are many examples of block copolymer synthesis using<br>
5<br>
controlled radical polymerization in the literature. The most common method for the<br>
preparation of vinyl monomers is the sequential addition of the monomers. This can be<br>
extended if the sequential polymerization is terminated with a functional group such as<br>
alkoxyamine, which can be used as a macroinitiator to prepare a new block. Tenhu et al, reports<br>
the synthesis of A-B-A block copolymers of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) as a hydrophilic block<br>
and a non-water-soluble-block consisting of poly((3-methoxypropyl)acrylamide) (PMPAM) are<br>
synthesized using RAFT polymerizations. In this reaction, a bifunctional S,S'-bis(a, a'-dimethyla"-<br>
acetic acid)-trithiocarbonate is used as a RAFT agent to obtain the A-B-A block copolymer.<br>
See, Nuopponen et al, J. of Polymer Science, A Poly Chem. 2008, 46, 38. Further,<br>
BlocBuilder®, introduced by Arkema, is a double headed alkoxyamine initiator which will lead to<br>
triblocks. If a single headed initiator is used, the polymer produced will be a simple diblock<br>
copolymer. Blockcopolymers of various composition and morphology will result in polymers<br>
with different properties, which can lead to polymers that behave and perform differently.<br>
[0027] "Cationic Monomer" means a monomer unit as defined herein which possesses a<br>
net positive charge. Representative cationic monomers include the quaternary or acid salts of<br>
dialkylaminoalkyl acrylates and methacrylates such as dimethylaminoethylacrylate methyl<br>
chloride quaternary salt (DMAEAMCQ), dimethylaminoethylmethacrylate methyl chloride<br>
quaternary salt (DMAEMMCQ), dimethylaminoethylacrylate hydrochloric acid salt,<br>
dimetliylaminoethylacrylate sulfuric acid salt, dimethylaminoethyl acrylate benzyl chloride<br>
quaternary salt (DMAEABCQ) and dimethylaminoethylacrylate methyl sulfate quaternary salt;<br>
the quaternary or acid salts of dialkylaminoalkylacrylamides and methaciylamides such as<br>
dimethylaminopropyl acrylamide hydrochloric acid salt, dimethylaminopropyl acrylamide<br>
sulfuric acid salt, dimethylaminopropyl methacrylamide hydrochloric acid salt and<br>
dimethylaminopropyl methacrylamide sulfuric acid salt, methacrylamidopropyl trimethyl<br>
ammonium chloride and acrylamidopropyl trimethyl ammonium chloride; and N,N-diallyldialkyl<br>
ammonium halides such as diallyldimethyl ammoniiun chloride (DADMAC). Preferred cationic<br>
monomers include dimethylaminoethylacrylate methyl chloride quaternary salt,<br>
dimethylaminoethyhnethacrylate methyl chloride quaternary salt and diallyldimethyl ammonium<br>
chloride. Diallyldimethyl ammonium chloride is more preferred.<br>
[0028] "Cross linking monomer" means an ethylenically unsaturated monomer<br>
containing at least two sites of ethylenic unsaturation which is added to constrain the<br>
microparticle conformation of the polymeric microparticles of this invention. The level of cross<br>
linking used in these polymer microparticles is selected to maintain a rigid non-expandable<br>
6<br>
microparticle configuration. Cross linking monomers according to this invention include both<br>
labile cross linking monomers and non-labile cross linking monomers.<br>
[0029] "Emulsion." "microemulsion" and "inverse emulsion" mean a water-in-oil<br>
polymer emulsion comprising a polymeric microparticle according to this invention in the<br>
aqueoijs phase, a hydrocarbon oil for the oil phase and one or more water-in-oil emulsifying<br>
agents. Emulsion polymers are hydrocarbon continuous with the water-soluble poljmiers<br>
dispersed within the hydrocarbon matrix. The emulsion polymer are optionally "inverted" or<br>
converted into water-continuous form using shear, dilution, and, generally an inverting<br>
surfactant. See, U.S. Pat. No. 3,734,873, the entire content of \^iuch is incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
[0030] "Fluid mobility" means a ratio that defmes how readily a flxiid moves through a<br>
porous meditim. This ratio is known as the mobility and is expressed as the ratio of the<br>
permeability of the porous medium to the viscosity for a given fluid.<br>
1. X~— for a single fluid X flowing in a porous medium.<br>
[0031] When more than one fluid is flowing the end point relative permeabilities must be<br>
substituted for the absolute permeability used in equation 1.<br>
2. /Lt = — for a fluid x flowing in a porous medium in the presence of one or more<br>
other fluids.<br>
[0032] When two or more fluids are flowmg the fluid mobilities may be used to define a<br>
Mobility ratio<br>
3. M = —= - ^<br>
Xy TJxkry<br>
[0033] The mobility ratio is of use in the study of fluid displacement, for example in<br>
water flooding of an oil reservoir where x is water and y is oil, because the efficiency of the<br>
displacement process can be related to it. As a general principle at a mobility ratio of 1 the fluid<br>
front moves almost in a "plug flow" manner and the sweep of the reservoir is good. When the<br>
mobility of the water is ten times greater than the oil viscous instabilities, known as fingering,<br>
7<br>
develop and the sweep of the reservoir is poor. When the mobility of the oil is ten times greater<br>
than the water the sweep of the reservoir is almost total.<br>
[0034] "Ion-pair polymeric microparticle" means a cross-linked polymeric microparticle<br>
prepared by polymerizing an ampholytic ion pair monomer and one more anionic or nonionic<br>
monomers.<br>
[0035] "Labile cross linking monomer" means a cross linking monomer which can be<br>
degraded by certain conditions of heat and/or pH, after it has been incorporated into the polymer<br>
structure, to reduce the degree of crosslinking in the polymeric microparticle of this invention.<br>
The aforementioned conditions are such that they can cleave bonds in the "cross linking<br>
monomer" without substantially degrading the rest of the polymer backbone. Representative<br>
labile cross linking monomers include diacrylamides and methacrylamides of diamines such as<br>
the diacrylamide of piperazine, acrylate or methacrylate esters of di, tri, tetra hydroxy compounds<br>
including ethyleneglycol diacrylate, polyethyleneglycol diacrylate, trimethylopropane<br>
trimethactylate, ethoxylated trimethylol triacrylate, ethoxylated pentaerj^thritol tetracrylate, and<br>
the like; divinyl or diallyl compounds separated by an azo such as the diallylamide of 2,2'-<br>
Azobis(isbutyric acid) and the vinyl or allyl esters of di or tri functional acids. Preferred labile<br>
cross linking monomers include water soluble diacrylates such as PEG 200 diacrylate and PEG<br>
400 diacrylate and poljrfimctional vinyl derivatives of a polyalcohol such as ethoxylated (9-20)<br>
trimethylol triacrylate.<br>
[0036] In an embodiment, the labile cross linkers are present in an amount of about 100<br>
to about 200,000 ppm, based on total weight of monomer. In another embodiment, the labile<br>
cross linkers are present in an amount from about 1,000 to about 200,000 ppm. In another<br>
embodiment, the labile cross linkers are present in an amount from about 9,000 to about 200,000<br>
ppm. In another embodiment, the labile cross linkers are present in an amount from about 9,000<br>
to about 100,000 ppm. In another embodiment, the labile cross linkers are present in an amount<br>
from about 20,000 to about 60,000 ppm. In another embodiment, the labile cross linkers are<br>
present in an amount from about 500 to about 50,000 ppm. In another embodiment, the labile<br>
crosslinkers are present in an amount of about 1,000 to about 20,000 ppm.<br>
[0037] "Monomer" means a polymerizable allylic, vinylic or acrylic compound. The<br>
monomer may be anionic, cationic, nonionic or zwitterionic. Vinyl monomers are preferred,<br>
acrylic monomers are more preferred.<br>
[0038] "Nonionic monomer" means a monomer as defined herein which is electrically<br>
neutral. Representative nonionic monomers include N-isopropylacrylamide, N,Ndimethylacrylamide,<br>
N,N-diethyIacrylamide, dimethylaminopropyl acrylamide,<br>

dimethylaminoethylacrylate (DMAEA), dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate (DMAEM), maleic<br>
anhydride, N-vmyl pyrrolidone, vinyl acetate and N-vinyl formamide. Preferred nonionic<br>
monomers include acrylamide, N-methylacrylamide, N,N-dimethylacrylamide and<br>
methacrylamide. Acrylamide is more preferred.<br>
[0039] "Non-labile cross linking monomer" means a cross linking monomer which is not<br>
degraded under the conditions of temperature and/or pH which would cause incorporated labile<br>
cross linking monomer to disintegrate. Non-labile cross linking monomer is added, in addition to<br>
the labile cross linking monomer, to control the expanded conformation of the polymeric<br>
microparticle. Representative non-labile cross linking monomers include methylene<br>
bisacrylamide, diallylamine, triallylamine, divinyl sulfone, diethyleneglycol diallyl ether, and the<br>
like. A preferred non-labile cross linking monomer is methylene bisacrylamide.<br>
[0040] In an embodiment, the non-labile cross linker is present in an amount from about<br>
0 to about 300 ppm, based on total weight of monomer. In another embodiment, the non-labile<br>
cross linker is present in an amount from about 0 to about 200 ppm. In another embodiment, the<br>
non-labile cross linker is present in an amount from about 0 to about 100 ppm. In another<br>
embodiment, the non-labile cross linker is present in an amount of from about 5 to about 300<br>
ppm. In another embodiment, the non-labile cross linker is present in an amount of from about 2<br>
to about 300 ppm. In another embodiment, the non-labile cross linker is present in an amount of<br>
from about 0.1 to about 300 ppm. In the absence of a non-labile cross linker, the polymer<br>
particle, upon complete scission of labile cross linker, is converted into a mixture of linear<br>
polymer strands. The particle dispersion is thereby changed into a polymer solution. This<br>
polymer solution, due to its viscosity, changes the mobility of the fluid in a porous medium. In<br>
the presence of a small amount of non-labile cross linker, the conversion from particles to linear<br>
molecules is incomplete. The particles become a loosely linked network but retain certain<br>
'structure.' Such 'structured' particles can block the pore throats of porous media and create a<br>
blockage of flow.<br>
[0041] In an aspect of the present disclosure, the polymeric microparticles of this<br>
disclosure are prepared using an inverse emulsion or microemulsion process to assure certain<br>
particle size range. In an embodiment, the unexpanded volume average particle size diameter of<br>
the polymeric microparticles is from about 0.05 to about 5,000 microns. In an embodiment, the<br>
unexpanded volume average particle size diameter of the polymeric microparticles is from about<br>
0.1 to about 3 microns. In another embodiment, the unexpanded volume average particle size<br>
9<br>
diameter of the polymeric microparticles is from 0.1 to about 1 microns. In another embodiment,<br>
the unexpanded volume average particle size diameter of the polymeric microparticles is from<br>
about 0.05 to about 50 microns.<br>
[0042] Representative preparations of cross-linked polymeric microparticles using<br>
microemulsion process are described in U.S. Pat Nos. 4,956,400; 4,968,435; 5,171,808;<br>
5,465,792 and 5,737,349.<br>
[0043] In an inverse emulsion or microemulsion process, an aqueous solution of<br>
monomers and cross liiikers is added to a hydrocarbon liquid containing an ^propriate surfactant<br>
or surfactant mixture to form an inverse monomer microemulsion consisthig of small aqueous<br>
droplets dispersed in the continuous hydrocarbon liquid phase and subjecting the monomer<br>
microemulsion to free radical polymerization.<br>
[0044] In addition to the monomers and cross linkers, the aqueous solution may also<br>
contain other conventional additives including chelating agents to remove polymerization<br>
mhibitors, pH adjusters, initiators and other conventional additives.<br>
[0045] The hydrocarbon liquid phase comprises a hydrocarbon liquid or mixture of<br>
hydrocarbon liquids. Saturated hydrocarbons or mixtures thereof are preferred. Typically, the<br>
hydrocarbon liquid phase comprises benzene, toluene, ftiel oil, kerosene, odorless mineral spirits<br>
and mixtures of any of the foregoing.<br>
[0046] Surfactants useftil in the microemulsion polymerization process described herein<br>
include sorbitan esters of fatty acids, ethoxylated sorbitan esters of fatty acids, and the like or<br>
mixtures thereof. Preferred emulsifying agents include ethoxylated sorbitol oleate and sorbitan<br>
sesquioleate. Additional details on these agents may be found in McCutcheon's Detergents and<br>
Emulsifiers, North American Edition, 1980.<br>
[0047] Polymerization of the emulsion may be carried out in any manner known to those<br>
skilled in the art. Initiation may be effected with a variety of thermal and redox free-radical<br>
initiators including azo compounds, such as azobisisobutyronitrile; peroxides, such as t-bxityl<br>
peroxide; organic compounds, such as potassium persulfate and redox couples, such as sodium<br>
bisulfite/sodium bromate. Preparation of an aqueous product from the emulsion may be effected<br>
by inversion by adding it to water which may contain an inverting surfactant<br>
[0048] Alternatively, the polymeric microparticles cross linked with labile cross links are<br>
prepared by internally cross linking polymer particles which contain polymers with pendant<br>
carboxylic acid and hydroxyl groups. The cross linking is achieved through the ester formation<br>
between the carboxylic acid and hydroxyl groups. The esterification can be accomplished by<br>
azeotropic distillation (U.S. Pat. No. 4,599,379) or thin film evaporation technique (U.S. Pat No.<br>
10<br>
5,589,525) for water removal. For example, a polymer microparticle prepared from inverse<br>
emulsion polymerization process usir^ acrylic acid, 2-hydroxyethylacrylate, acrylamide and 2-<br>
acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonate sodium as monomer is converted into cross linked<br>
polymer particles by the dehydration processes described above.<br>
[0049] The polymeric microparticles are optionally prepared in dry form by adding the<br>
emulsion to a solvent which precipitates the polymer such as isopropanol, isopropanol/acetone or<br>
methanol/acetone or other solvents or solvent mixtures that are miscible with both hydrocarbon<br>
and water and filtering off and drying the resulting solid.<br>
[0050] An aqueous suspension of the polymeric microparticles is prepared by<br>
redispersing the dry polymer in water.<br>
[0051] Upon injection into a subterranean formation, the polymeric microparticles flow<br>
through the a zone or zones of relatively high permeability in the subterranean formation under<br>
increasing temperature conditions, until the composition reaches a location where the<br>
temperature or pH is sufficiently high to promote expansion of the microparticles,<br>
[0052] Unlike conventional blocking agents such as polymer solutions and polymer gels<br>
that cannot penetrate far and deep into the formation, the composition of this invention, due to<br>
the size of the particles and low viscosity, can propagate far &amp;om the injection point until it<br>
encounters the high temperature zone.<br>
[0053] Also, the polymeric microparticles of this invention, due to their highly<br>
crosslinked nature, do not expand in solutions of different salinity. Consequently, the viscosity<br>
of the dispersion is not affected by the salinity of the fluid encountered in the subterranean<br>
formation. Accordingly, no special carrier fluid is needed for treatment. Only after the particles<br>
encounter conditions sufficient to reduce the crosslinking density, is the fluid rheology changed<br>
to achieve the desired effect<br>
[0054] Among other factors, the reduction in crosslinking density is dependent on the rate<br>
of cleavage of the labile crosslinker. In particular, different labile crosslinkers, have different<br>
rates of bond cleavage at different temperatures. The temperature and mechanism depend on the<br>
nature of the cross-linking chemical bonds. For example, when the labile crosslinker is PEG<br>
diacrylate, hydrolysis of the ester linkage is the mechanism of de-crosslihking. Different<br>
alcohols have slightly different rates of hydrolysis. In general, methacrylate esters will hydrolyze<br>
at a slower rate than acrylate esters under similar conditions. With divinyl or diallyl compounds<br>
separated by an azo group such as the diallylamide of 2,2'-Azobis(isbutyric acid), the mechanism<br>
of de-crosslinking is elimination of a nitrogen molecule. As demonstrated by various azo<br>
11<br>
initiators for free radical polymerization, different azo compounds indeed have different half-life<br>
temperatures for decomposition.<br>
[0055] In addition to the rate of de-crosslinking, and without wishing to be bound to any<br>
theory, it is believed that the rate of particle diameter expansion also depends on the total amount<br>
of remaining crosslinking. We have observed that the particle expands gradually initially as the<br>
amount of crosslinking decreases. After the total amount of crosslinking passes below a certain<br>
critical density, the viscosity increases explosively. Thus, by proper selection of the labile crosslinker,<br>
both temperature- and time-dependent expansion properties can be incorporated into the<br>
polymer particles.<br>
[0056] The particle size of the polymer particles before expansion is selected based on<br>
the calculated pore size of the highest permeability thief zone. The crosslinker type and<br>
concentration, and hence the time delay before the injected particles begin to expand, is based on<br>
the temperature both near the injection well and deeper into the formation, the expected rate of<br>
movement of injected particles through the thief zone and the ease with which water can<br>
crossflow out of the thief zone into the adjacent, lower permeability, hydrocarbon containing<br>
zones. A polymer microparticle composition designed to incorporate the above considerations<br>
results in a better water block after particle expansion, and in a more optimum position in the<br>
formation.<br>
[0057] An aspect of the present disclosure is to demonstrate the benefits that result fiom<br>
the use of expandable polymeric microparticles having a block copolymer structures. Block<br>
copolymers of various composition and morphology will result in polymers with different<br>
properties and behavior that will aid in improving recovery of hydrocarbon fluids from<br>
subterranean formations. For example, application of a composition of expandable polymeric<br>
microparticles having a block copolymer structure may improve properties including, but not<br>
limited to, the binding, diffusion and rate of expansion of the polymeric microparticles.<br>
[0058] In an embodiment, a composition is provided that includes highly cross linked<br>
expandable poljoneric microparticles having unexpanded volume average particle size diameters<br>
of about 0.05 to about 5,000 microns and cross linking agent contents of about 100 to about<br>
200,000 ppm of labile cross linkers and from 0 to about 300 ppm of non-labile cross linkers,<br>
wherein the expandable polymeric microparticles have a block copolymer structure having at<br>
least two different monomers having different chemical structures. The block copolymer<br>
structure may be any block copolymer structure known in the art. For example, the block<br>
copolymer structure may include segmented blocks, random blocks, di-blocks, tri-blocks,<br>
alternating blocks, periodic blocks, amphiphilic blocks, statistical blocks, star blocks, comb<br>
12<br>
blocks and combinations thereof. In an embodiment, the block copolymer includes a hydrophilic<br>
block of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) and a non-water-soluble block of poly((3-<br>
methoxypropyl)acrylamide).<br>
[0059] The expandable polymeric microparticles having the block copolymer structure<br>
may be synthesized by any method known in the art. For example, the expandable polymeric<br>
microparticles having the block copolymer structure may be synthesized by methods including,<br>
but not limited to, controlled radical polymerization, anionic polymerization, cationic<br>
polymerization, group transfer polymerization, olefin metathesis polymerization, postpolymerization<br>
formation of metal complexes, and transition metal-catalyzed polymerization. In<br>
an embodiment, the expandable polymeric microparticles having the block copolymer structure is<br>
synthesized by controlled radical polymerization.<br>
[0060] In an embodiment where the expandable polymeric microparticles having the<br>
block copolymer structure are synthesized by controlled radical polymerization, the controlled<br>
radical polymerization technique may be any controlled radical polymerization technique known<br>
in the art For example, the controlled radical polymerization technique may include, but is not<br>
limited to, atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), nitroxide-mediated radical<br>
polymerization (NMP), and reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer polymerization<br>
(RAFT).<br>
[0061] Because an embodiment of the present disclosure comprises a composition of at<br>
least two different monomers having different chemical structures, the at least two different<br>
monomers may have any number of characteristics that differ from each other. For example, the<br>
monomers may have different molecular weights, hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity. Differences<br>
in the chemical structures and, therefore, the inherent properties of the different monomers allow<br>
for an improved behavior of the polymeric microparticles with respect to, for example, binding<br>
properties, diffusivity and the rate of expansion of the microparticles within the subterranean<br>
formation.<br>
[0062] The block copolymer structure of the polymeric microparticles in accordance with<br>
present disclosure may include any number of different monomer units. For example, in an<br>
embodiment, the block copolymer may include at least two different monomers, each of which<br>
have different chemical structures. Alternatively, in an embodiment, the block copolymer may<br>
also include a third monomer having a structure that is different from both of the at least two<br>
different monomers. The third monomer may be any monomer known in the art and may be<br>
selected based on the desired properties of the block copolymer. For example, a third monomer<br>
may be selected for its ability to modify the hydrophobicity or the hydrophilicity of the block<br>
13<br>
copolymer. Further, a third monomer may also be selected for its ability to either strengthen or<br>
assist in degrading the backbone of the polymer chain. Accordingly, the skilled artisan will<br>
appreciate that any number of different monomers may be used to synthesize the block<br>
copolymer structure of the polymeric microparticles.<br>
[0063] The unexpanded polymeric microparticles may have any average particle size<br>
diameter useful in appUcations to improve recovery of hydrocarbon fluids from subterranean<br>
formations. For ejcample, the unexpanded polymeric microparticles may have an average particle<br>
size diameter from about 0.05 to about 5,000 microns. In an embodiment, the unexpanded<br>
polymeric microparticles have an average particle size diameter from about 0,1 to about 5<br>
microns. In an embodunent, the unexpanded polymeric microparticles have an average particle<br>
size diameter from about 0.1 to about 3 microns. In another embodiment, the unexpanded<br>
polymeric microparticles have an average particle size diameter from about 0.1 to about 1<br>
micron. In another embodiment, the unexpanded polymeric microparticles have an average<br>
particle size diameter from about 0.05 to about 50 microns.<br>
[0064] In an embodiment, the labile cross Unker is selected from diacrylates and<br>
polyfimctional vinyl derivatives of a polyalcohol. The labile cross-linker may also be<br>
polymethyleneglycol diacrylate.<br>
[0065] In an embodiment, the composition includes cross linked anionic, amphoteric,<br>
ion-pair or betaine-containing polymeric microparticles.<br>
[0066] In an embodiment, the composition is in the form of an emulsion or aqueous<br>
suspension.<br>
[0067] In an embodiment, at least one of the cross linked polymeric microparticles is<br>
anionic. The anionic polymeric microparticle may be prepared by free-radical polymerization<br>
from about 95 to about 10 mole percent of nonionic monomers and from about 5 to about 90<br>
mole percent anionic monomers. The nonionic monomer may be acrylamide and the anionic<br>
monomer may be 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-l-propanesulfonic acid.<br>
[0068] In an embodiment, the non-labile cross linker is methylene bisacrylamide.<br>
[0069] The diameter of the expanded polymeric microparticles may be greater than one<br>
tenth of the controlling pore throat radius of the rock pores in the subterranean formation.<br>
Alternatively, the diameter of the expanded polymeric microparticles may be greater than one<br>
fourth of the controlling pore throat radius of the rock pores in the subterranean formation.<br>
[0070] Accordingly, in another aspect of the present disclosure, methods of using the<br>
above-described compositions are provided. The methods are directed toward improving<br>
recovery of hydrocarbon fluids from a subterranean formation comprising injecting into the<br>
14<br>
subterranean formation any of the compositions previously described herein, as well as variations<br>
or combinations thereof.<br>
[0071] For example, in an embodiment, a method for improving recovery of hydrocarbon<br>
fluids from a subterranean formation is provided. The method mcludes injecting into a<br>
subterranean formation highly cross linked expandable polymeric microparticles having<br>
unexpanded volume average particle size diameters of about 0.05 to about 5,000 microns and<br>
cross linking agent contents of about 100 to about 200,000 ppm of labile cross linkers and from 0<br>
to about 300 ppm of non-labile cross linkers, wherein the expandable polymeric microparticles<br>
have a block copolymer structure comprising at least two different monomers having different<br>
chemical structures. The microparticles may have a smaller diameter than the pores of the<br>
subterranean formation and the labile cross linkers may break under the conditions of<br>
temperature and pH in the subterranean formation to form expanded microparticles.<br>
[0072] In an embodiment, the highly cross Imked expandable polymeric microparticles<br>
are added to injection water as part of a secondary or tertiary process for the recovery of<br>
hydrocarbon fluids from the subterranean formation. The injection water may be added to the<br>
subterranean formation at a temperature lower than the temperature of the subterranean<br>
formation. The injection water may also be added directly to a producing well.<br>
[0073] The composition of polymeric microparticles having a block copolymer structure<br>
may be added to the injection water in any amount, based on polymer actives, effective to<br>
improve recovery of hydrocarbon flxxids from the formation. For example, in an embodiment,<br>
from about 100 ppm to about 10,000 ppm of the composition, based on polymer actives, is added<br>
to the subterranean formation. In another embodiment, from about 500 ppm to about 1,500 ppm<br>
of the composition, based on polymer actives, is added to the subterranean formation. In yet<br>
another embodiment, from about 500 ppm to about 1,000 ppm of the composition, based on<br>
polymer actives, is added to the subterranean formation.<br>
[0074] In an embodiment, the injection into the subterranean formation of the highly<br>
cross linked expandable polymeric microparticles is used in a carbon dioxide and water tertiary<br>
recovery project.<br>
[0075] In an embodiment, the injection into the subterranean formation of the highly<br>
cross linked expandable polj^meric microparticles is used in a tertiary oil recovery process, one<br>
component of which constitutes water injection.<br>
[0076] In an embodiment, the subterranean formation is a sandstone or carbonate<br>
hydrocarbon reservoir.<br>
15<br>
[0077] The foregoing may be better understood by reference to the following examples,<br>
which are presented for purposes of illustration and are not intended to limit the scope of the<br>
present disclosure.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
[0078] Preparation of the Polymeric Microparticle<br>
[0079] The polymeric microparticle of the present disclosure may be readily prepared<br>
using inverse emulsion polymerization techniques as described below.<br>
[0080] A representative emulsion polymer composition can be prepared in numerous<br>
ways by the sIdUed artisan. By way of example, a preparation method using (3-<br>
vinylphenyl)azomethylmalonodinitrile is provided herein. A representative emulsion polymer<br>
composition is prepared by polymerizing a monomer emulsion consisting of an aqueous mixture<br>
of 98.94 g of 50% acrylamide, 150 g of 58% sodium acrylamido methylpropane sulfonate<br>
(AMPS), 19.38 g water, 0.5 g 40% pentasodium diethylenetriaminepentaacetate, 0.2 g of (3-<br>
vinylphenyl)azomethylmalonodinitrile, and 36.24 g polyethyleneglycol (PEG) diacrylate as the<br>
dispersed phase and a mixture of 336 g petroleum distillate, 60 g ethoxylated sorbitol oleate and<br>
4 g sorbitan sesquioleate as the continuous phase.<br>
[0081] The monomer emulsion is prepared by mixing the aqueous phase and the oil<br>
phase, followed by homogenization using a Silverson Homogenizer. After deoxygenation with<br>
nitrogen for 30 minutes, poljmierization is initiated by using redox initiators and kept under 35<br>
"C. Once all of the monomer is polymerized, a second batch of monomers: 65.96 g of 50%<br>
acrylamide, 225 g of 58% sodium acrylamido methylpropane sulfonate (AMPS) is added to the<br>
reaction mixture. The reaction is slowly heated to 65 °C and held at that temperature until the<br>
monomer is converted to 50%. The temperature is then raised to 80 "C and held there until all of<br>
the monomer is converted.<br>
[0082] If desired, the polymeric microparticle can be isolated fixDm the latex by<br>
precipitating, filtering, and washing with a mixture of acetone and isopropanol. After drying, the<br>
oil and surfactant free particle can be redispersed in aqueous media.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
[0083] Sand Pack Test<br>
[0084] This Example demonstrates that the polymeric microparticles of this invention can<br>
be propagated with a conformation constrained by the built-in reversible crosslinks and will<br>
expand in size when these break, to give a particle of suitable size to produce a substantial effect.<br>
16<br>
[0085] In the sand pack test, a 40 foot long sand pack of 0.25 inches internal diameter,<br>
made from degreased and cleaned 316 stainless steel tubing, is constructed in eight sections,<br>
fitted with pressure transducers, flushed with carbon dioxide gas and then placed in an oven and<br>
flooded with synthetic oil field injection water.<br>
[0086] A dispersion of a representative polymeric microparticles is prepared in the<br>
synthetic injection water and injected into the pack to fill the pore volume. Pressure drops across<br>
the tube sections are monitored for signs of conformation change of the polymer particle as the<br>
reversible cross-links are hydrolysed. The "popping open" of the polymer particles is observed<br>
as a steep rise in the pressure drop. The sand pack test is described in detail in WO 01/96707.<br>
[0087] The data for representative polymeric microparticles shows that the particles are<br>
able to travel through the first two sections of the sand pack without changing the RRF of the<br>
sections. However, particles in the last section, after accumulating a sufficient amount of<br>
residence time, have expanded and give a higher value of RRF. The higher RRF value is<br>
maintained after the injection fluid is changed from polymer dispersion to brine.<br>
[0088] This experiment clearly demonstrates two aspects of the invention which are:<br>
[0089] 1. The polymeric microparticles with a conformation constrained by the<br>
built-in reversible crosslinks can be propagated through a porous media.<br>
[0090] 2. The microparticles will expand in size when crosslinks break, to give a<br>
particle of suitable size to produce a substantial effect, even in a high permeability porous<br>
medium.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
[0091] Activation of the Polymeric Microparticles by Heat<br>
[0092] As the particles expand in a medium of fixed volume, the volume firaction<br>
occupied by them increases. Consequently, the volume fraction of the continuous phase<br>
decreases. This decrease in free volume is reflected in an increase in the viscosity of the<br>
dispersion. Activation of the microparticles of present disclosure by heat can be demonstrated in<br>
a bottle test.<br>
[0093] To carry out a bottle test, a dispersion containing 5000 ppm of the kernel particles<br>
is prepared in an aqueous medium (e.g., a synthetic brine). Dispersing of particles can be<br>
accomplished by vigorous stirring or by using a homogenizer. To prevent oxidative degradation<br>
of the expanding particles during monitoring, 1000 ppm sodium thiosulfate can be added to the<br>
mixture as an oxygen scavenger.<br>
17<br>
[0094] The bottles are placed in a constant temperature oven to age. Then, at a<br>
predetermined time, a bottle can be removed fix)m the oven and cooled to 75oF. The viscosity is<br>
measured at 75 T using Brookfield LV No.l spindle at 60 rpm (shear rate 13.2 sec"').<br>
[0095] Activation of the polymeric microparticles by heat can be demonstrated by<br>
monitoring the viscosity change of aqueous dispersions of particles aged at different temperature.<br>
[0096] It should be understood that various changes and modifications to the presently<br>
preferred embodiments described herein will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Such<br>
changes and modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the<br>
present subject matter and without diminishing its intended advantages. It is therefore intended<br>
that such changes and modifications be covered by the appended claims.<br>
