(Formula Removed)<br>
Likewise particularly preferred mixtures are those which, as well as the dyes of the formulae (I) and (II), contain a dye of the formula (IV), in particular dyes of the formula (IV) selected from the group (IVa), (IVb) and (IVc)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Particularly preferred mixtures further include those which, as well as the dyes of the formulae (I) and (II), contain a dye of the formula (V), especially the dye of the formula (Va)<br>
(Formula   Removed)<br>
The dye mixture of the invention preferably comprises 1 to 99%, preferably 1 to 80%, especially 5 to 60%, by weight of at least one dye of the formula (I) and 1 to 99%, preferably 20 to 99%, especially 40 to 95%, by weight of at least one dye of the formula (II), based on the total amount of dye.<br>

Preference is given to using the dye of the formula (V) in an amount of 0 to 40%, especially 5 to 30% by weight, based on the total amount of dye.<br>
The dye mixtures of the invention lead to black to navy shades, especially with the above-specified mixing ratios.<br>
The mixtures of the invention are especially notable for excellent sublimation fastness and good affinity. Also, the colour yield is consistently high over a wide pH range. They are especially useful for alkaline polyester dyeing, especially at a pH of 8 to 11.<br>
The dye mixture of the invention may include further disperse dyes.<br>
The invention further relates to a process for producing the dye mixture of the invention, characterized in that the individual dyes (I) and (II) and optionally further dyes of the dye mixture are ground in water in the presence of a dispersant, then mixed and optionally dried or in that the dyes (I), (II) and optionally further ones are mixed, ground in water in the presence of a dispersant and optionally dried.<br>
Novel dye mixtures of the dyes of the formulae (I), (II) and optionally one or more dyes of the general formulae (III) to (V) can be prepared for example by simply mixing the components. The mixing can be accomplished by mixing separately finished individual components in the dyeing liquor or else, preferably, by mixing the press cakes of the individual components and conjointly finishing the mixture.<br>
The finish is characterized in that the dyes are ground in the presence of a dispersant to convert them into an aqueous dispersion, i.e. into a liquid or, after drying, into a pulverulent dye preparation, for which the individual dyes can first be separately finished and then mixed or the individual dyes can first be mixed and then conjointly finished. This grinding preferably takes place in mills, for example ball, vibratory, bead or sand mills, or in kneaders. After grinding, the dye particle size is preferably about 0.1 to 10 urn, especially about 1 urn. The grinding preferably takes place in the presence of dispersants, which can be nonionic or anionic. Nonionic dispersants are for example reaction products of alkylene oxides, for example ethylene oxide or propylene oxide, with alkylatable compounds, for example fatty alcohols, fatty amines, fatty acids, phenols, alkylphenols and carboxamides. Anionic dispersants are for example ligninsulphonates and salts thereof, alkyl- or alkylaryl-sulphonates, alkylaryl polyglycol ether sulphates, alkali metal salts of the condensation products of naphthalenesulphonic acids and formaldehyde, polyvinyl sulphonates and ethoxylated novolaks.<br>
The invention therefore also provides dye preparations comprising<br>
10 to 60% by weight of the dye mixture of the invention, and 40 to 90% by weight of the dispersant.<br>
The dye preparations can be present in liquid or solid form, in which case the liquid preparations are preferably aqueous dye dispersions and the solid preparations are present as powder or granules.<br>
Preferred aqueous dye preparations comprise water,<br>
15 to 50% by weight of the dye mixture of the invention, and<br>
10 to 25% by weight of dispersant, each based on the dye preparation.<br>
Preferred dispersants are the abovementioned nonionic and anionic dispersants.<br>
The dye preparations of the invention may comprise further auxiliaries, for example auxiliaries which act as oxidizing agents, e.g. sodium m-nitrobenzenesulphonate, or fungicidal agents, e.g. sodium o-phenylphenoxide and sodium pentachlorophenoxide. It is also possible for wetting agents, antifreeze agents, dustproofing agents or hydrophilicizing agents to be included.<br>
For certain applications, solid preparations such as powder or granule preparations are preferred. Preferred solid dye preparations comprise<br>
30 to 50% by weight of the dye mixture of the invention, and<br>
70 to 50% by weight of the dispersant.<br>
They may optionally further comprise auxiliaries, for example wetting, oxidizing,<br>
preserving and dustproofmg agents.<br>
A preferred process for producing the solid preparations consists in depriving the above-described liquid dye preparations of their liquid, for example by vacuum drying, freeze drying, by drying on drum dryers, but preferably by spray drying.<br>
Dye mixtures of the invention, however, can preferably also be produced by conjoint finishing of the mixing components.<br>
To this end, the mixing components are dispersed in a suitable mixing ratio as described above by a grinding operation in water and optionally converted into a solid dye preparation by removing the water.<br>
To improve the properties of the dye preparations, it can be advantageous to subject the mixing components to a heat treatment prior to grinding. The heat treatment takes place at 25 to 98°C, preferably at 30 to 80°C, particularly preferably at 40 to 60°C. It is advantageous to carry out the finishing, i.e. the conversion into the commercially customary solid or liquid preparations, immediately after the heat treatment, without intermediary isolation. For this purpose, the heat-treated suspension is converted into a dispersion by grinding. It is advantageous in this connection to carry out the heat treatment in the presence of those dispersants and optionally also auxiliaries which are to be included in the finished solid or liquid preparation. These are identical with the abovementioned surface-active substances. If the total amount of these dispersants and auxiliaries was not added during the heat treatment, the remainder will be added prior to grinding. In this case, generally 10 to 400% by weight, preferably 20 to 200% by weight, of surface-active substances, based on the dye mixtures, are added for the heat treatment.<br>
To produce dyeing liquors, the requisite amounts of the dye preparations produced in accordance with the above directions are diluted with the dyeing medium, preferably water, to such an extent that a liquor ratio of 5:1 to 50:1 is obtained for the dyeing. In<br>
addition, the liquors generally have added to them further dyeing auxiliaries, such as carriers, dispersants and wetting agents.<br>
If the dye mixture of the invention is to be used for textile printing, then the requisite amounts of the dye preparation are kneaded, preferably together with thickeners, for example alkali metal alginates or the like, optionally further additives, for example fixation accelerants, wetting agents and hydration agents, to form print pastes.<br>
The dye mixtures of the invention, which incidentally may include further dyes, are very useful for dyeing and printing hydrophobic synthetic materials. Examples of suitable hydrophobic synthetic materials are cellulose acetate, cellulose triacetate, polyamides and high molecular weight polyesters. The dye mixtures of the invention are preferably used for dyeing and printing materials composed of high molecular weight polyesters, especially those based on polyethylene glycol terephthalates, or their mixtures with natural fibre materials, especially wool or cellulose, or for dyeing and printing materials composed of cellulose triacetate.<br>
The hydrophobic synthetic materials can be present in the form of sheetlike or filamentary structures and may have been processed for example into yarns or woven or knitted textile materials. The dyeing of the fibre material mentioned with the dye mixtures of the invention can be carried out in a conventional manner, preferably from aqueous dispersion, optionally in the presence of carriers, between 80 to about 110°C by the exhaust method or by the HT method in a dyeing autoclave at 110 to 140°C, and also by the so-called thermofix method, whereby the fabric is padded with the dyeing liquor and then set/fixed at about 180 to 230°C. The printing of the materials mentioned can be carried out in a conventional manner by incorporating the dye mixtures of the invention into a print paste and treating the fabric printed therewith at temperatures between 180 to 230°C with HT steam or dry heat to fix the dyes, optionally in the presence of a carrier. This produces very strong olive, navy or black dyeings and prints having very good fastnesses, especially having very good light, rub, dry heat setting and pleating, washing, water and sublimation fastness<br>
properties.<br>
The dye mixtures of the invention exhibit excellent wetting characteristics when used for making up dyeing and padding liquors and also print pastes and are rapidly dispersible without extensive manual or mechanical stirring. The liquors and print pastes are homogeneous and give trouble-free processing in modern dyehouse drugstores without blocking the nozzles.<br>
The liquid preparations of the invention do not separate and, in particular, do not form a sticky sediment. There is thus no need for any extensive homogenization of the dye in its container before the dye is removed.<br>
The millbase produced on grinding the dyes in the presence of dispersants and auxiliaries to produce solid preparations is stable for a prolonged period, even at elevated temperature. The millbase need not be cooled in the mills or after leaving the mills and can be kept for a prolonged period in collection vessels prior to spray drying.<br>
The thermal stability of the dye mixture of the invention also shows itself in the fact that spray drying can be carried out at high temperatures without agglomeration of the material to be dried. For the same dryer outlet temperature, a higher inlet temperature means better dryer performance and thus reduced manufacturing costs.<br>
The above-described dye preparations are very useful for making up print pastes and dyeing liquors. They offer particular advantages for example in relation to continuous processes, where the dye concentration of the dyeing liquors has to be kept constant by continuously feeding dye into the running apparatus.<br>
The advantage of the dye mixtures of the invention becomes particularly clear when dyeing from an aqueous dyebath under modern industrial conditions.<br>
The modem industrial conditions mentioned are characterized by high pack densities in the case of package and beam dyeings, short liquor ratios, i.e. high dye concentrations, and also high shearing forces in the dyeing liquor due to high pumping rates. The dye mixtures of the invention do not agglomerate even under these conditions, nor filter out on the textile materials to be dyed. Thus, homogeneous dyeings are obtained without colour strength differences between the outer and inner layers of the wound packages, and the dyeings do not shed any dye deposits. Pad dyeings and prints with the dye mixture of the invention produce a material of homogeneous, speckle-free appearance.<br>
The dye mixtures of the invention are also useful for dyeing the above-cited hydrophobic materials from organic solvents by the methods known for this purpose and for mass coloration.<br>
The invention therefore also provides for the use of the dye mixtures of the invention for dyeing and printing hydrophobic synthetic materials, especially fibre materials, and for the mass coloration of hydrophobic synthetic materials.<br>
The examples hereinbelow illustrate the invention.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1<br>

(Formula Removed)<br>
and also13.7 g of the dye of the formula (3<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
And 6.0 g of the dye of the formula (4) <br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
