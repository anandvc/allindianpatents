Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates, in general, to a handover method in a mobile communication<br>
network and, more particularly, to a mobile communication system and handover method thereof,<br>
which enable handover of a mobile communication terminal that is using a packet data service or is in a<br>
dormant state in a mobile communication network in which asynchronous and synchronous networks<br>
coexist<br>
Background Art<br>
With the development of mobile communication technology, a mobile communication<br>
network changes every generation. Currently, a network adopts a structure in which a synchronous<br>
mobile communication system (Code Division Multiple Access [CDMA] mobile communication<br>
system), designated as second generation or 2.5-th generation network, and an asynchronous mobile<br>
communication system (Wideband CDMA [WCDMA] mobile communication system), designated<br>
as a third generation network, coexist<br>
Further, in order to support global roaming between mobile communication systems, a<br>
Dual-Band Dual-Mode (DBDM) mobile communication terminal capable of being used in both a<br>
synchronous mode system and an asynchronous mode system has been developed. By using the<br>
mobile communication terminal, different types of services can be used in asynchronous and<br>
synchronous mode system areas.<br><br>
Currently, an asynchronous mobile communication system is being constructed in areas<br>
having a great number of service requests, so that a synchronous mode mobile communication<br>
system has been developed into a form in which the service area thereof includes service areas of an<br>
asynchronous mode system. However, since the asynchronous mobile communication system is<br>
still in an initial stage and requires enormous investment to be implemented, the service cannot be<br>
provided to a wide area, so that the service area of an asynchronous mobile communication system<br>
overlaps with that of a synchronous mobile communication system.<br>
Accordingly, since the service area of the asynchronous mobile communication system is<br>
limited, there is a problem in that service is interrupted when a subscriber to the asynchronous mobile<br>
communication system moves into a synchronous area, in which an asynchronous mobile<br>
communication service cannot be provided, during the use of the packet data service in an<br>
asynchronous area.<br>
As described above, if asynchronous and synchronous mobile communication systems<br>
coexist and the service area of the asynchronous mobile communication system is smaller than that of<br>
the synchronous mobile communication system, handover is required to provide continuous packet<br>
data service between the asynchronous and synchronous mobile communication systems.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention has been made keeping in mind the above problems<br>
occurring in the prior art, and an object of the present invention is to provide a mobile communication<br>
system and handover method thereof, which provide continuous packet data service when a mobile<br>
communication terminal that is using a packet data service in an asynchronous network moves into a<br>
synchronous network, thus preventing service interruption.<br><br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a handover method for providing a packet<br>
data service to a dual-band dual-mode mobile communication terminal having an asynchronous<br>
modem unit and a synchronous modem unit in a mobile communication network in which<br>

asynchronous mobile communication system moves into an area of the synchronous mobile<br>
communication system, a Serving General packet radio service (GPRS) Support Node (SGSN)/<br>
Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) of the asynchronous mobile communication system<br>
receiving information indicating that handover is required; the second step of the SGSN/GGSN<br>
commanding a base station of the synchronous mobile communication system to perform<br>
handover; the third step of the mobile communication terminal attempting to originate a call<br>
to the base station, thus executing call processing and channel assignment between the base<br>
station and a mobile switching center of the synchronous mobile communication system; the<br>
fourth step of performing a negotiation related to call processing and setup between the mobile<br>
communication terminal and the base station; the fifth step of the synchronous mobile<br>
communication system setting up a trunk; the sixth step of initializing a radio link protocol<br>
between the mobile communication terminal and the base station; the seventh step of the base<br>
station notifying the mobile switching center that channel assignment has, been completed; the<br>

packet data service node of the synchronous mobile communication system; and the ninth step<br>
of the synchronous mobile communication system assigning a mobile IP to the mobile<br>
communication terminal.<br>
The present invention also provides a handover method for providing a packet data<br>
service to a dual-band dual-mode mobile communication terminal having an asynchronous<br>
modem unit and a synchronous modem unit in a mobile communication network in which<br>
asynchronous and synchronous mobile communication systems coexist, the method comprising:<br>
the first step of, as the mobile communication terminal that is connected to the asynchronous<br><br><br><br>
mobile communication system and using a packet data service moves into an area of the<br>
synchronous mobile communication system, and a handover event occurs, a node B of the<br>
asynchronous mobile communication system notifying a Serving General packet radio service<br>
(GPRS) Support Node (SGSN)/Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) of the asynchronous<br>
mobile communication system that handover is required; the second step of the SGSN/GGSN<br>
requesting a mobile switching center of the synchronous mobile communication system to<br>
perform handover, and the mobile switching center requesting the base station of the<br>

attached drawings.<br>
FIG. 1 is a view showing the configuration of a mobile communication network according to<br>
the present invention, in which the mobile communication network is depicted on the basis of<br>
components used to provide a packet data service.<br><br>
A mobile communication terminal 10 applied to the present invention is a Dual-Band Dual-<br>
Mode (hereinafter referred to as DBDM) mobile communication terminal, which can be provided<br>
with both an asynchronous mobile communication service and a synchronous mobile<br>
communication service. The mobile communication terminal is selectively connected to an<br>
asynchronous mobile communication system 20 and a synchronous mobile communication system<br>
30 in a wireless manner, thus using voice and data services. A detailed description thereof will be<br>
described later with reference to FIGS. 2 and 3.<br>
The asynchronous mobile communication system 20 includes a node B 210 functioning as<br>
a base station to perform wireless section communication with the mobile communication terminal<br>
10, a Radio Network Controller (RNC) 220 for controlling the node B 210, an asynchronous Mobile<br>
Switching Center (MSC) 230 connected to the RNC 220 to perform call switching so as to provide<br>
voice service to the mobile communication terminal 10, a Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) 240<br>
disposed between the RNC 220 and a General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) network 250 to track<br>
the location of the mobile communication terminal 10 and perform access control and security<br>
functions, and a Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) 260 connected to the SGSN 240 through the<br>
GPRS network 250 and connected to an IP network 40 to support interworking with external packets.<br>
Further, the synchronous mobile communication system 30 includes a Base Transceiver Station<br>
(BTS) 310 for supporting wireless section communication with the mobile communication terminal<br>
10, a Base Station Controller (BSC) for controlling the BTS 310 and a packet controller (Packet<br>
Control Function: PCF) 320 for performing a function similar to that of the BSC at the time of<br>
providing a packet data service, such as the management of radio resources for the packet data<br>
service, a Mobile Switching Center (MSC) 330 connected to one or more base station controllers to<br>
perform call switching, a Packet Data Service Node (PDSN) 340 connected to the packet controller<br>
320 to establish a Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) session with the mobile communication terminal 10,<br>
interface with an external node, and perform a Foreign Agent (FA) function for the location<br><br>
registration of the mobile communication terminal 10 so as to provide a packet data service to a<br>
subscriber, a Data Core Network (DCN) (not shown) for supporting the interface between the packet<br>
data service node 340 and the IP network 40, a home agent 350 for authenticating the mobile<br>
communication terminal 10 and transmitting packet data to a foreign agent, and an Authentication<br>
Authorization Account (AAA) unit 360 for performing authentication, authorization and account<br>
functions for the mobile communication terminal.<br>
Although not shown in the drawing, the MSCs 230 and 330 of the asynchronous mobile<br>
communication system 20 and the synchronous mobile communication system 30 are connected to<br>
each other through a No. 7 common channel signaling network to transmit and receive information<br>
required for handover of the mobile communication terminal 10, etc. therebetween.<br>
In such a mobile communication system, the mobile communication terminal 10 of the<br>
present invention is selectively connected to the asynchronous mobile communication system 20 and<br>
the synchronous mobile communication system 30 and transmits and processes signal processing status<br>
with respect to the two systems.<br>
FIG. 2 is a view of an example of a mobile communication terminal applied to the present<br>
invention, which shows the case in which functional units for radio communication with asynchronous<br>
and synchronous networks are independently implemented.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, a DBDM mobile communication terminal 10 applied to the present<br>
invention includes an antenna 110, an asynchronous mobile communication service module 120, a<br>
synchronous mobile communication service module 130 and a common module 140.<br>
The antenna 110 is capable of simultaneously processing frequency bands for synchronous and<br>
asynchronous mobile communication services.<br>
The asynchronous module 120 includes a duplexer 121 functioning as a band pass<br>
filter for separately processing individual frequencies, an asynchronous radio transmission/reception<br>
unit 122 for separating transmission/reception radio waves into preset frequency bands, and an<br><br>
asynchronous modem unit 123 for processing wireless section protocol with an asynchronous mobile<br>
communication system. The synchronous module 130 includes a duplexer 131 functioning as a band<br>
pass filter for separately processing individual frequencies, a synchronous radio transmission/reception<br>
unit 132 for separating transmission/reception radio waves into preset frequency bands, and a<br>
synchronous modem unit 133 for processing wireless area protocol with a synchronous mobile<br>
communication system.<br>
The common module 140 includes an application processor that functions as a central<br>
processing unit for controlling the asynchronous modem unit 123 and the synchronous modem unit<br>
133, an application processor for performing a multimedia function, memory, an input/output unit, and<br>
some other application processing units.<br>
Further, in the DBDM mobile communication terminal 10, software used for user interface,<br>
additional services, mobility management, connection/session control, resource control, and protocol<br>
processing is installed, thus allowing a user to use various application services, performing handover,<br>
and converting protocols according to mobile communication systems.<br>
In the mobile communication terminal according to this embodiment, the asynchronous<br>
modem unit 123 of the asynchronous module 120 and the synchronous modem unit 133 of the<br>
synchronous module 130 can be controlled by the common module 140. Further, either of the<br>
asynchronous and synchronous modem units 123 and 133 can control the entire mobile communication<br>
terminal.<br>
FIG. 3 is a view of another example of a mobile communication terminal applied to the<br>
present invention, which shows the case in which functional units for radio communication with<br>
asynchronous and synchronous networks are integrated.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3, the DBDM mobile communication terminal 10 applied to the present<br>
invention includes an antenna 150,aduplexer 160, a multi-band radio transmission/reception unit 170,a<br>
multi-mode modem unit 180 and some other processing module 190.<br><br>
The antenna 150 is capable of simultaneously processing frequency bands for synchronous<br>
and asynchronous mobile communication services.<br>
The duplexer 160 functions as a band pass filter for separately processing frequencies from<br>
the asynchronous network and frequencies from the synchronous network. The multi-band radio<br>
transmission/reception unit 170 separates transmission/reception radio waves into preset frequency<br>
bands. The multi-mode modem unit 180 processes wireless section protocol with the asynchronous<br>
mobile communication system or the synchronous mobile communication system.<br>
The processing module 190 includes an application processor that functions as a central<br>
processing unit for controlling the multi-mode modem unit 180 and includes an application processor<br>
for performing a multimedia function, memory, an input/output unit, and some other application<br>
processing units.<br>
Further, in the DBDM mobile communication terminal 10, software used for user interfaces,<br>
additional services, mobility management, connection/session control, resource control, and protocol<br>
processing is installed, thus allowing a user to use various application services, performing handover,<br>
and converting protocols according to mobile communication systems.<br>
As described above, if the radio transmission/reception units and the modem units are<br>
integrated, several advantages can be realized, such as the reduction of the size of the mobile<br>
communication terminal 10, the reduction of power consumption and the sharing of modem memory.<br>
FIGS. 4A and 4B are conceptual views showing handover of a mobile communication<br>
terminal in a dormant state in a mobile communication network in which asynchronous and<br>
synchronous networks coexist<br>
In a single mobile communication system, "handover" (or "handoff") means technology<br>
allowing a user to communicate without interruption when a mobile communication terminal moves<br>
from one cell of a mobile communication system to another cell thereof. The present invention relates<br>
to a handover method for a DBDM mobile communication terminal in a network in which<br><br>
synchronous and asynchronous mobile communication systems coexist. Of the cases in which the<br>
mobile communication terminal 10 moves from a synchronous area B into an asynchronous area A,<br>
and in which the mobile communication tenninal 10 moves from an asynchronous area A into a<br>
synchronous area B, the latter is described in detail.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4A, the mobile communication terminal establishes a session with the node<br>
B 210 in the asynchronous area A, is assigned a mobile IP, and enters a dormant state, in which the<br>
mobile communication terminal is connected to the IP network 40 through the SGSN 240 and the<br>
GGSN 260 and can use the packet data service provided by the CP server 50, if a data signal is<br>
generated<br>
As the mobile communication terminal 10 gradually moves into the synchronous area B<br>
through an overlap area C between the asynchronous and synchronous areas A and B,<br>
transmission/reception power between the node B 210 of the asynchronous mobile communication<br>
system and the mobile communication terminal 10 gradually attenuates. The asynchronous mobile<br>
communication system, having sensed the power attenuation, or the synchronous mobile<br>
communication system, having sensed the approach of the mobile communication terminal, notifies the<br>
SGSN/GGSN 240/260 of the asynchronous mobile communication system that handover is required.<br>
Accordingly, the SGSN/GGSN 240/260 commands the BTS 310 of the synchronous mobile<br>
communication system 310 to perform handover, so that call setup and trunk setup are performed<br>
between the mobile communication tenninal and the synchronous mobile communication system.<br>
Thereafter, as shown in FIG. 4B, a mobile IP is assigned by the PDSN 340 to the mobile<br>
communication tenninal, so that the mobile communication terminal remains in a dormant state with<br>
respect to the synchronous mobile communication system.<br>
Consequently, the mobile communication tenninal, handed over to the synchronous mobile<br>
communication system area B, completely releases the connection to the asynchronous mobile<br>
communication system, and remains in a dormant state in the synchronous mobile communication<br><br>
system. Thereafter, if a data signal is generated, the mobile communication terminal makes a<br>
transition to an active state to immediately use the packet data service.<br>
FIGS. 5A and 5B are conceptual views showing handover of a mobile communication<br>
terminal using a packet data service in a mobile communication network in which asynchronous and<br>
synchronous networks coexist<br>
Referring to FIG. 5A, the mobile communication terminal establishes a session with the node<br>
B 210 in the asynchronous area A and is assigned a mobile IP. If a data signal is generated, the mobile<br>
communication terminal is in a dormant state in which it is connected to the IP network 40 through the<br>
SGSN 240 and GGSN 260 and can use the packet data service provided by the CP server 50, or in a<br>
state in which the mobile communication terminal is connected to the IP network 40 through the node<br>
B 210, the SGSN 240 and the GGSN 260 and is using the packet data service provided by the CP<br>
server 50. Thereafter, as the mobile communication terminal 10 approaches the synchronous area B<br>
through the overlap area C between the asynchronous and synchronous areas A and B,<br>
transmission/reception power between the node B 210 of the asynchronous mobile communication<br>
system and the mobile communication terminal 10 gradually attenuates. The asynchronous mobile<br>
communication system, having sensed the power attenuation, requests the synchronous mobile<br>
communication system to perfonn handover. The synchronous mobile communication system,<br>
having received the handover request, assigns a channel to the mobile communication terminal 10 so as<br>
to provide the packet data service.<br>
When channel assignment has been completed between the synchronous mobile<br>
communication system and (he mobile communication terminal 10, the asynchronous mobile<br>
communication system directs the mobile communication terminal to perform handover, thus handing<br>
over the mobile communication tenrtinal to the synchronous mobile communication system. When<br>
the mobile communication tenninal is completely connected to the synchronous mobile<br>
communication system, the synchronous mobile communication system notifies the<br><br>
asynchronous mobile communication that handover has been completed. Accordingly, the node B<br>
210 of the asynchronous mobile communication system releases the connection to the mobile<br>
communication terminal 10. Further, the mobile communication terminal is assigned a new mobile IP<br>
through the PDSN and HA of the synchronous mobile communication system to continuously use the<br>
packet data service.<br>
Consequently, referring to FIG. 5B, the mobile communication terminal, handed over to the<br>
synchronous mobile communication system area B, completely releases the connection to the<br>
asynchronous mobile communication system, and can continuously use the packet data service<br>
provided by the CP server 50 through the BTS 310, the PCF 320, the PDSN 340 and the IP network 40.<br>
FIG. 6 is a flowchart of a handover method for a mobile communication terminal in a<br>
dormant state according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
As the mobile communication terminal 10 in a dormant state in the asynchronous network<br>
moves into a synchronous network area, the node B 210 of the asynchronous network senses the<br>
attenuation of transmission/reception power between the node B 210 and the mobile communication<br>
terminal 10, determines mat handover is required, and notifies the SGSN/GGSN 240/260 of the<br>
requirement for handover, thus indicating that the mobile communication terminal is leaving the<br>
asynchronous area (Serving Radio Network Subsystem: SRNS Relocation Required) at step S101. In<br>
this case, the identification number of the mobile communication terminal 10 is also transmitted.<br>
Further, the step S101 of notifying the SGSN/GGSN 240/260 that handover is required can be<br>
performed by the BTS 310 of the synchronous mobile communication system, having sensed the<br>
approach of the mobile communication terminal.<br>
The SGSN/GGSN 240/260, notified of the requirement for handover, commands the BTS<br>
310 of the synchronous network to perform handover (SRNS Relocation Command) at step S102.<br>
Further, the node B 210 directs the mobile communication terminal to perform handover<br>
(HANDOVER FROM UTRAN CMD) at step S103. This direction message includes a<br><br>
message related to the synchronous mobile communication system, in particular, information about<br>
channel assignment, traffic channel entry, etc.<br>
Thereafter, the mobile communicau'on terminal attempts to originate a call to the BTS 310<br>
using an Origination Message (ORM) (ORM[DRS=l]) at step S104, so that call processing and<br>
channel assignment are executed between the BTS 310 and the MSC 330. In detail, the BTS 310<br>
transmits a service request message to the MSC 330 in response to the call origination attempt by the<br>
mobile communication terminal (Connection Management: CM Serv. Req.) at step S105. The MSC<br>
330 requests the BTS 310 to assign a channel (Assign. Req.) at step S106, and the BTS 310, having<br>
received the channel assignment request, transmits a channel assignment message to the mobile<br>
communication terminal (ECAM: Extended Channel Assignment Message) at step S107.<br>
Next, a negotiation related to call processing and setup is performed between the mobile<br>
communication terminal (synchronous module) and the BTS 310 of the synchronous mobile<br>
communication system (negotiate and connect service) at step S108, and a trunk setup procedure is<br>
performed. The trunk, setup procedure can be performed through an A-interface. In detail, if the<br>
BTS 310 requests the packet controller (PCF) 320 to set up a trunk (A9 Setup-A8) at step S109, the<br>
packet controller 320 requests the PDSN 340 to set up a trunk and receives a reply to the trunk setup<br>
request (A11 RRQ, A11 RRP) at steps S110 and S111. The packet controller 320 transmits a reply<br>
signal, received from the PDSN 340, to the BTS 310 (A9 Connect-A8) at step S112.<br>
In this way, when the trunk setup is completed, the initialization of a Radio Link Protocol<br>
(RLP) is performed (RLP initialization) between the mobile communication terminal 10 and BTS 310<br>
at step S113. The BTS 310 notifies the MSC 330 that channel assignment has been completed<br>
(Assignment complete) at step S114. Then, PPP setup is performed between the mobile<br>
communication terminal and the PDSN 340 (PPP establishment) at step S115, so that a new packet data<br>
call is set up, and men amobile IP assignment procedure is performed.<br>
The mobile IP assignment procedure is described in detail. The mobile communication<br><br>
terminal requests the packet controller 320 to assign a mobile IP (MIP registration request) at step S116.<br>
Therefore, the packet controller 320 requests the Authentication Authorization Account (AAA) unit<br>
360 to authenticate the mobile communication terminal (Access Request) at step S117.<br>
Accordingly, the AAA unit 360 verifies the legality of the mobile communication terminal,<br>
and transmits verification results to the PDSN 340 (Access Reply) at step S118. If the mobile<br>
communication terminal is an acceptable terminal as determined by the legality verification received<br>
from the AAA unit 360, the PDSN 340 requests the home agent 350 to assign a mobile IP and receives<br>
a reply to the mobile IP assignment request (MOP RRQ/RRP) at steps S119 and S120. In this way, if<br>
the mobile IP is assigned, the assigned mobile IP is transmitted to the mobile communication terminal<br>
(MIP registration reply) at step S121.<br>
Accordingly, the mobile communication terminal completely releases the connection to the<br>
asynchronous mobile communication system 20, is assigned a new mobile IP by the synchronous<br>
mobile communication system, and remains in a dormant state.<br>
FIG. 7 is a flowchart of a handover method for a mobile communication terminal using a<br>
packet data service according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
As the mobile communication terminal 10 that is using a packet data service in the<br>
asynchronous network moves into the synchronous network area, the node B 210 of the asynchronous<br>
network determines that handover is required on the basis of the attenuation of transmission/reception<br>
power between the node B 210 and the mobile communication terminal 10, and notifies the<br>
SGSN/GGSN 240/260 that handover is required (SRNS Relocation Required) at step S201. In this<br>
case, the identification number of the mobile communication terminal is also transmitted, and the<br>
SGSN/GGSN 240/260 requests the MSC 330 of the synchronous network to perform handover<br>
(FACDIR2) at step S202.<br>
Accordingly, the MSC 330 requests the BTS 310 to perform handover (Handoff Request),<br>
and the BTS 310 performs a procedure of setting control signals and traffic for the transmission of<br><br>
packet data in the synchronous network For this operation, the BTS 310 requests the packet<br>
controller (PCF) 320 to assign a channel (A9-setup) at step S204. Accordingly, the packet controller<br>
(PCF) 320 requests location registration from the PDSNZFA 340, and receives results of the location<br>
registration request (All-Reg. Req/reply) at step S205. The PDSN/FA 340 requests location<br>
registration from the SGSN/GGSN 240/260 and receives a reply to the location registration request<br>
(Registration req/reply) at step S206, and then transmits channel assignment information to the BTS<br>
310 (A9-Connect) at step S207.<br>
As described above, when channel assignment is completed, the BTS 310 notifies the MSC<br>
330 that handover has been completed (HandoffReq. Ack) at step S208, and assigns a forward channel<br>
to the mobile communication terminal by transmitting a null frame to the mobile communication<br>
terminal through a forward fundamental channel (F-FCH) for the transmission of forward traffic (F-<br>
FCH frames) at step S209.<br>
Further, the MSC 330, notified of the completion of handover, notifies the SGSN/GGSN<br>
240/260 that handover has been completed (facdir2) at step S210. The SGSN/GGSN 240/260,<br>
having received the handover completion notification, commands the node B 210 to perform handover<br>
(SRNS Relocation Command) at step S211.<br>
Thereafter, the node B 210 directs the mobile communication tenninal to perform handover<br>
(HANDOVER FROM UTRAN CMD) at step S212. This direction message includes a message<br>
related to the synchronous mobile communication system, in particular, information about channel<br>
assignment The mobile communication tenninal, having received the handover direction message,<br>
directs the synchronous module to prepare to communicate with the synchronous mobile<br>
communication system, switches to the synchronous mode, and transmits frames to the BTS 310 of the<br>
synchronous mobile communication system through a Reverse Fundamental Channel (R-FCH) (R-<br>
FCH frames) at step S213. Thereafter, the mobile communication terminal notifies the BTS 310 that<br>
handover has been completed (HCM) at step S214. Accordingly, the connection between<br><br>
the mobile communication terminal 10 and the synchronous mobile communication system 30 is<br>
established.<br>
Next, the BTS 310 performs a procedure of setting up a call with the packet network of the<br>
synchronous mobile communication system. First, if the BTS 310 requests the packet controller<br>
(PCF) 320 to set up a call (A-9 connected) at step S215, the packet controller (PCF) 320 requests<br>
location registration from the PDSN/FA 340, and receives results of the location registration request<br>
(A11-Reg. Req/reply) at step S216. Further, the PDSN/FA 340 requests location registration from the<br>
SGSN/GGSN 240/260, and receives a reply to the location registration request (Registration req/reply)<br>
at step S217.<br>
Thereafter, the packet controller (PCF) 320 notifies the BTS 310 that call setup has been<br>
completed (A-9 connected Ack) at step S218. The BTS 310 notifies the MSC 330 that handover has<br>
been completed (Handoff Complete) at step S219. The MSC 330 notifies the SGSN/GGSN 240/260<br>
that handover has been completed (Handoff Complete, MSONCH) at step S220. Then, the<br>
SGSN/GGSN 240/260 requests the node B 210 to release the connection to the mobile communication<br>
terminal (lu Release Cmd) at step S221.<br>
Accordingly, if the service provided by the asynchronous mobile communication system 20<br>
to the mobile communication terminal is released, the mobile communication terminal performs PPP<br>
establishment with the PDSN 340 (PPP establishment) at step S222, thus setting up a new packet data<br>
call. If the new packet data call is set up, the mobile communication terminal requests the packet<br>
controller (PCF) 320 to assign a mobile IP (MIP registration request) at step S223. Accordingly, the<br>
packet controller (PCF) 320 requests the HA 350 to assign a mobile IP and receives a reply to the<br>
request (MIP RRQ/RRP) at step S224, and then transmits an assigned mobile IP to the mobile<br>
communication terminal (MIP registration reply) at step S225.<br>
Accordingly, the mobile communication terminal completely releases the connection to the<br>
asynchronous mobile communication system 20, and can continuously use the packet data service<br><br>
provided by the CP server through the BTS, the packet controller (PCF), the PDSN and the IP network.<br>
FIGS. 8 and 9 are views of examples of a protocol stack applied to the mobile communication system<br>
according to the present invention, which shows a user plane protocol stack applicable to the case in<br>
which a common module 140 is constructed to control a DBDM mobile communication terminal in the<br>
DBDM mobile communication terminal of FIG. 2.<br>
First, FIG. 8 illustrates the case in which a PPP is used as a Packet Data Protocol (PDP) type<br>
in an asynchronous mobile communication system. A protocol stack can be easily implemented by<br>
constructing an interface between the asynchronous mobile communication system and the home agent<br>
350.<br>
For a protocol stack for communicating with the IP network 40, the home agent 350 includes<br>
an L1 layer (physical layer) for performing coding and modulation, an L2 layer for processing replies to<br>
accurately transmit messages, and an IP layer. Further, for a protocol stack for communicating with<br>
the GGSN 260 of the asynchronous network and the PDSN 340 of the synchronous network, the home<br>
agent 350 includes an L1 layer, an L2 layer, and an IP tunneling layer for tunneling the L2 layer.<br>
The GGSN 260 of the asynchronous network includes an L1 layer, an L2 layer, a User<br>
Datagram Protocol (UDP)/Intemet Protocol (IP) layer for performing message exchange in a system<br>
that transmits data using IP to correspond to the IP tunneling layer of the home agent 350, a GPRS<br>
Tunneling Protocol (GTP)-U layer for defining the flow of packet data and information, and a Point-to-<br>
Point Protocol (PPP) layer for performing packet compression, authentication, IP assignment, etc. for<br>
data communication.<br>
Further, the SGSN 240 is connected to the GGSN 260 through a Gn interlace, includes an<br>
L1bis layer corresponding to the L1 layer, and an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) layer for<br>
performing the generation, extraction and exchange of packet data to correspond to the L2 layer so as to<br>
convert protocols used in the GGSN 260, and does not perform protocol conversion with respect to the<br>
data used in other layers (UDP/IP and GTP-U).<br><br>
Next, the node B and the RNC 210 and 220 are connected to the SGSN 240 through an Iu interface,<br>
and include an L1 layer corresponding to the L1bis layer, a Media Access Control (MAC) layer for<br>
assigning radio resources for multimedia data processing to correspond to the ATM layer, a Radio Link<br>
Control (RLC) layer for establishing a radio link with the mobile communication terminal and<br>
combining and dividing packet data to correspond to the UDP/IP layer, and a Packet Data Convergence<br>
Protocol (PDCP) layer for compressing a packet data header to conespond to the GTP-U protocol, so as<br>
to convert protocols used in the SGSN 240.<br>
Furthermore, the asynchronous modem unit 123 of the mobile communication terminal does<br>
not perform protocol conversion with respect to an L1 layer and includes an HDLC flaming layer for<br>
performing link management for link connection and disconnection, synchronization problem solution,<br>
flow control, error control, etc. to correspond to the MAC/RLC/PDCP layers, so as to convert protocols<br>
used in the node B/RNC, and includes a PPP layer for receiving data through the PPP layer of the<br>
GGSN260.<br>
In the meantime, the PDSN 340 includes an L1 layer, an L2 layer, a UDP/IP layer for<br>
performing message exchange in a system that transmits data using IP to correspond to the IP tunneling<br>
layer, a Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) layer for encrypting and compressing packets, and a<br>
Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) layer for performing packet compression, authentication, IP assignment,<br>
etc. for data communication, so as to convert protocols used in the home agent 350.<br>
The packet controller (PCF) 320 is connected to the PDSN 340 through an A-interface (A10),<br>
includes an L1bis layer corresponding to the L1 layer and an ATM layer for performing the generation,<br>
extraction and exchange of packet data to correspond to the L2 layer so as to convert protocols used in<br>
the PDSN 340, and does not perform protocol conversion with respect to data used in other higher<br>
UDP/IP and GRE layers.<br>
Further, the BTS 310 is connected to the packet controller (PCF) 320 through an A-interface<br>
(A8), and includes an L1 layer corresponding to the L1bis layer, a MAC layer for assigning radio<br><br>
resources for multimedia data processing to correspond to the ATM layer, and an RLP layer, for<br>
requesting the retransmission of erroneous frames to prevent errors from occurring in a wireless section,<br>
to correspond to the UDP/IP layer, so as to convert protocols used in the PCF 320.<br>
In addition, the synchronous modem unit 133 of the mobile communication terminal does not<br>
perform protocol conversion with respect to an L1 layer and includes an HDLC framing layer for<br>
performing link management for link connection and disconnection, synchronization problem solution,<br>
flow control and error control, etc. to correspond to the MAC/RLP layers so as to convert protocols<br>
used in the BTS/PCF, and includes a PPP layer for receiving data through the PPP layer of the GGSN<br>
260.<br>
Finally, the common module 140 of the mobile communication terminal includes an L1<br>
layer, a PPP layer, an IP layer, a transport layer and an application layer so as to convert protocols of<br>
data received from the asynchronous modem unit 123 and the synchronous modem unit 133.<br>
In this embodiment, it can be seen that both the asynchronous modem unit 123 and the<br>
synchronous modem unit 133 perform only a communication function, and the common module<br>
establishes the protocols of higher PPP and IP layers.<br>
Next, FIG. 9 illustrates the case in which a Packet Data Protocol (PDP)-type IP is used in the<br>
asynchronous mobile communication system, which shows a protocol stack when a PPP is not used.<br>
In this embodiment, it can be seen that, since the asynchronous mobile communication system does not<br>
use a PPP, a PPP layer is not used in either the GGSN 260 or the asynchronous modem unit 123 of the<br>
mobile communication terminal, unlike FIG. 8.<br>
In the present invention, a procedure of establishing a new PPP and assigning a mobile IP to a<br>
mobile communication terminal in a synchronous network is performed to support handover from an<br>
asynchronous network to the synchronous network during the use of a packet data service, thus<br>
providing continuous packet data service to the mobile communication terminal.<br><br>
As described above, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the present invention can be<br>
implemented with other embodiments without changing the technical spirit or essential features thereof<br>
Therefore, the above-described embodiments should be appreciated as having been disclosed for<br>
illustrative purposes and are not restrictive. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the scope of the<br>
present invention is defined by the accompanying claims rather than the above detailed description, and<br>

terminal to provide continuous service, thus improving the quality of service.<br><br><br>
