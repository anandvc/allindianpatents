				<td>The present invention relates to a cationic coating compo-"" sition, more specifically to a cationic coating composition capable of forming a cured coating film which is excellent in a corrosion resist¬ance and a rust preventive steel plate aptitude.<br>
A cationic coating composition is used mainly as an elec-trodepositable coating composition for wide-ranged uses including an undercoating composition for car bodies, and those having various characteristics have so far been developed. Proposed as a conven¬tional cationic coating composition is, for example, a coating composi¬tion having an excellent corrosion resistance and improved in an electrodepositable coating aptitude and an adhesive property toward a rust preventive steel plate, in which used as a vehicle component is a modified epoxy resin obtained by internally plasticizing an epoxy resin having an amino group and/or a quaternary ammonium salt group as a hydrophilic group with a plasticizer, for example, a lead compound or a chromium compound such as polyamide, polyester and polyether and blended is a rust preventive pigment such as lead chromate, basic lead silicate and strontium chromate. In recent years, however, hazardous compounds such as lead compounds and chromium compounds are restricted in use thereof from a viewpoint of pollution problems, and techniques which can improve a corrosion resistance of the coating film without blending such hazardous compounds are expected to be developed.<br>
On the other hand, an epoxy resin which is internally plasticized with a plasticizer tends to reduce a corrosion resistance of the coating film, and therefore it is considered to use an epoxy resin containing no plasticizing modifier to thereby elevate the corrosion resistance. However, this provides the problem that the electrodepo-<br><br>
sitable coating aptitude against a rust preventive steel plate is reduced. In order to solve such problems, it is proposed that added as a plasticizer for an epoxy resin are, for example, polyol resins such as polyesterpolyols, polyetherpolyols, polyurethanepolyols and acryl-polyols; and polymers including polyolefins such as polybutadiene and polyethylene. Involved therein, however, is the problem that these materials not only do not have a sufficiently high compatibility with epoxy resins and are not effective so much for elevating a rust preventive steel plate aptitude but also reduce a corrosion resistance of the coating film by adding in a large amount.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a cationic coating composition comprising an epoxy resin as a base material and capable of forming a coating film which is excellent both in a corro¬sion resistance and a rust preventive steel plate aptitude without using hazardous compounds such as lead compounds and chromium compounds.<br>
Intensive researches repeated by the present inventors have resulted in finding that the object described above can be achieved by using as a vehicle component in a cationic coating compo¬sition, a polyol-modified, amino group-containing epoxy resin pre¬pared by reacting an epoxy resin with a polyol compound obtained by adding caprolactone to a compound having plural active hydrogen groups and an amino group-containing compound, and they have come to complete the present invention.<br>
Thus, the present invention provides a cationic coating composition comprising as a vehicle component, a polyol-modified, amino group-containing epoxy resin prepared by reacting an epoxy resin (A) having an epoxy equivalent of 180 to 2500 with a polyol compound <b obtained by adding caprolactone to a compound having plural active hydrogen groups and an amino group-containing com></b>

Epoxy resin (A):<br>
usually 60 to 90 % by weight, preferably 62 to 85 % by weight and more preferably 62 to 80 % by weight Polyol compound (B);<br>

usually 5 to 25 % by weight, preferably 6 to 19 % by weight and more preferably 6 to 18 % by weight Cationic coating composition:<br>
The cationic coating composition provided by the present invention comprises as a vehicle, the polyol-modified, amino group-containing epoxy resin produced in the manner described above and is suitably used in water base coating materials, particularly electro-depositable coating materials.<br>
The cationic coating composition according to the present invention is used in combination with, for example, a cross-hnking agent such as blocked polyisocyanate and a melamine resin, particu¬larly a blocked polyisocyanate cross-linking agent, whereby a thermo¬setting cationic coating composition can be prepared.<br>
The blocked polyisocyanate cross-Hnking agent described above is an addition reaction product of a polyisocyanate compound with an isocyanate blocking agent in almost stoichiometric amounts.

such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, trimethylolpropane, hexa-netriol and castor oil.<br>
On the other hand, the isocyanate blocking agents de¬scribed above are added to isocyanate groups of the polyisocyanate compounds to block them, and the blocked polyisocyanate compounds formed by addition thereof are stable at a room temperature. How¬ever, when they are heated at a baking temperature (usually, about 100 to about 200^:;) of the coating film, the blocking agent is prefera¬bly dissociated, and the free isocyanate groups can be regenerated. The blocking agent satisfying such requisite includes, for example, lactam base compounds such as e-caprolactara and y-butyrolactam; oxime base compounds such as methyl ethyl ketoxime and cyclo-hexanoneoxime; phenol base compounds such as phenol, p-t-butyl-phenol and cresol; aliphatic alcohols such as n-butanol and 2-ethyl-hexanoi; aromatic alkylalcohols such as phenylcarbinol and methyl-phenylcarbinol; and ether alcohol base compounds such as ethylene glycol monobutyl ether.<br>

The cationic coating composition of the present invention comprising the polyol-modified, amino group-containing epoxy resin and the blocked polyisocyanate cross-linking agent described above can be prepared, for example, by sufficiently mixing the polyol-modified, amino group-containing epoxy resin and the blocked<br><br>
polyisocyanate cross-linking agent and then neutralizing the mixture with water-soluble organic carboxylic acid usually in an aqueous medium to make the above epoxy resin water-soluble or water-dis-persible. Acetic acid, formic acid or a mixture thereof is particularly suited as the organic carboxylic acid used for neutralization, and use of these acids elevates a finishing property, a throwing property and a low temperature-curing property of the coating composition formed and a stabihty of the coating material.<br>
A bismuth compound can be added as a rust preventive to the coating composition of the present invention. The kind of the bismuth compound which can be blended shall not specifically be restricted and includes, for example, inorganic bismuth compounds such as bismuth oxide, bismuth hydroxide, basic bismuth carbonate, bismuth nitrate and bismuth sihcate. Among them, bismuth hydrox¬ide is particularly preferred.<br>
Capable of being also used as the bismuth compound are organic acid bismuth salts which are produced by reacting two or more organic acids with the bismuth compounds described above and in which at least one of the above organic acids is aliphatic hydroxy-carboxylic acid. The organic acids which can be used for producing the above organic acid bismuth salts include, for example, glycolic acid, glyceric acid, lactic acid, dimethylolpropionic acid, dimethylol-butyric acid, dime thy lol valeric acid, tartaric acid, malic acid, hydroxymalonic acid, dihydroxysuccinic acid, trihydroxysuccinic acid, methylmalonic acid, benzoic acid and citric acid.<br>
The inorganic bismuth compounds and the organic acid bismuth salts described above each can be used alone or may be used in combination of two or more kinds thereof.<br>
A content of these bismuth compounds in the coating composition of the present invention shall not strictly be restricted and can be changed over a wide range according to performances<br><br>
required to the coating material. Usually, it falls suitably in a range of 10 % by weight or less, preferably 0.05 to 5 % by weight based on the resinous solid matters contained in the coating composition of the present invention.<br>
Further, the coating composition of the present invention can contain, if necessary, a tin compound as a curing catalyst. The above tin compound includes, for example, organic tin compounds such as dibutyltin oxide and dioctyltin oxide; and aHphatic or aro¬matic carboxylic acid salts of dialkyltin such as dibutyltin dilaurate, dioctyltin dilaurate, dibutyltin diacetate, dioctyltin benzoateoxy, dibutyltin benzoateoxy, dioctyltin dibenzoate and dibutyltin dibenzo-ate. Among them, dialkyltin aromatic carboxylic acid salts are suitable from a viewpoint of a low temperature curabiHty.<br>
A content of these tin compounds in the coating composi¬tion of the present invention shall not strictly be restricted and can be changed over a wide range according to performances required to the coating material. Usually, the tin content falls suitably in a range of 0.01 to 8 parts by weight, preferably 0.05 to 5.0 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the resinous solid matters con¬tained in the coating material.<br>
Further, the cationic coating composition of the present invention can be blended, if necessary, with coating material addi¬tives such as a color pigment, an extender pigment, a rust preventive pigment, an organic solvent, a pigment dispersant and a surface-con¬trolling agent.<br>
The cationic coating composition of the present invention can be coated on a desired base material surface by cationically electrodepositable coating. In general, electrodepositable coating can be carried out on the condition of a loaded voltage of 100 to 400 V in an electrodepositing bath controlled usually to a bath temperature of about 15 to about SSt, which comprises the coating composition of<br><br>
the present invention diluted by adding deionized water so that the sohd matter concentration becomes about 5.0 to about 40 % by weight and controlled to a pH falling in a range of 5.5 to 9.<br>
A film thickness of an electrodeposited coating film which is formed using the coating composition of the present invention shall not specifically be restricted and falls preferably in a range of usually 10 to 40 fim, particularly 15 to 35 ^m in terms of a cured coating film. A baking temperature of the coating film is suitably a temperature falling in a range of usually about 120 to about 200°C, preferably about 140 to about 180°C on a coated article surface, and the baking time can be set preferably in an extent of 5 to 60 minutes, preferably 10 to 30 minutes.<br>
The cationic coating composition of the present invention is suitably used as a cationically electrodepositable coating material, but it shall not be restricted thereto and can also be used as a solvent type coating material for a corrosion resistant primer of a steel plate for coating by a method such as electrostatic coating and roll coating. Further, the coating composition of the present invention can be used as a two Liquid type room temperature-drying coating material and an adhesive using a polyisocyanate compound and a melamine resin as a cross-linking agent.<br>
The cationic coating composition of the present invention forms a cured coating film which is excellent in a corrosion resist¬ance, an electrodepositable coating aptitude against a corrosion-resistant steel plate and an adhesive property to a base material and is useful as an undercoating material for car bodies, car parts and construction &amp; building fields.<br>
