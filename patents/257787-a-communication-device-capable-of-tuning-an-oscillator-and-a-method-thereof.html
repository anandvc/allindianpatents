				<td>The present invention relates to a communication device.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Field<br>
[0001]      The present invention relates generally to electronics, and more specifically,<br>
to telecommunications vising a tunable oscillator.<br>
Background<br>
[0002] Consumer demand for mobile wireless services has led to the development of an ever increasing number of cellular networks. One such network is based on code division multiple access (CDMA) technology which supports wireless voice and data services using spread-spectrum communications. In spread-spectrum communications, a large number of signals share the same frequency spectrum and, as a result, provide a high level of user capacity. This is achieved by transmitting each signal with a different pseudo-noise (PN) code that modulates a carrier, and thereby, spreads the signal. The transmitted signals are separated in the receiver by a correlator that uses a corresponding PN code to despread the signol. The undesired signals, whose codes do not match, are not despread and contribute only to noise.<br>
[0003] A competing network which has become the de facto standard in Europe and Asia is Global Syslem for Mobile Communications (GSM) technology. Unlike CDMA, GSM uses narrowband time division multiple access (TDMA) technology to support wireless voice and data services. Other popular networks that have evolved over the years using TDMA technology include General Packet Radio Service (GPRS)' and EDGE, both which support high speed data services. These networks may be dispersed throughout the geographic landscape, each with its own unique set of protocols, services, and data rates.<br>
[0004] Today, wireless communication devices are being deployed with technology that supports multiple cellular networks. Typically, these devices are equipped with a dedicated receiver for each network. A local oscillator (LO) circuit may be used to provide a stable reference signal to each receiver. The stable reference signal may be used by each individual receiver to recover information signals from a high frequency carrier. The LO circuit is typically implemented with a crystal oscillator driving several<br><br>
frequency multiplier circuits. The frequency multiplier circuits may be individually programmed to provide a reference signal to each receiver at the proper frequency. 3h order to maintain good receiver performance, a highly accurate and stable crystal oscillator is often employed. Alternatively, a tunable oscillator, such as a voltage controlled temperature compensated crystal oscillator (VCTCXO) may be used. A frequency tracking loop may be used to tune the oscillator to compensate for manufacturing tolerances, Doppler frequency shifts, and drift.<br>
[0005] In more advanced systems, wireless communication devices may be equipped with a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver. GPS is part of a satellite based navigation system developed by the United States Department of Defense. It provides global coverage with navigational capability under various environmental conditions. In a fully operational GPS, the entire surface of the earth is covered by up to twenty-four satellites dispersed in six orbits with four satellites in each orbit. A GPS receiver in the wireless communications device uses signals modulated by a pseudorandom-noise (PKN) code from multiple satellites to pinpoint its exact location on earth. The raw data generated from the GPS receiver may be used for various applications. By way of example, the raw data may be plugged into map files stored in memory.<br>
[0006] To improve the economic viability of these wireless communication devices, the GPS receiver often .shares a common LO circuit with the cellular receivers. The problem with this approach is that the performance of the GPS receiver may be degraded if the crystal oscillator in the LO circuit is being tuned by the frequency tracking loop during GPS operation. Accordingly, there is a need for an innovative approach that can be used to tune a crystal oscillator in an LO circuit without degrading the performance of the GPS receiver.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0007] In one aspect of the present invention, a communications device includes a tunable oscillator configured to produce a reference signal, a receiver configured to recover an information signal from a carrier using the reference signal, and a processor configured to detect a frequency error in the information signal, and periodically tune the oscillator to reduce the frequency error.<br>
[0008] In another aspect of the present invention, a communications device includes a tunable oscillator configured to produce a reference signal, a receiver configured to<br><br>
recover an information signal from a carrier using the reference signal, and a processor configured to detect a frequency error in the information signal, and tune the oscillator if the frequency error crosses a threshold.<br>
[0009] In yet another aspect of the present invention, a method of communications includes recovering an information signal from a carrier using a reference signal, detecting a frequency error in the information signal, and periodically tuning the reference signal to reduce the frequency error.<br>
[0010] In a further aspect of the present invention, a communications device includes means for producing a reference signal, means for recovering an information signal from a carrier using the reference signal, means for detecting a frequency error in the information signal, and means for periodically timing the reference signal to reduce the frequency error.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0017] The detailed description set forth below in connection with the appended drawings is intended as a description of various embodiments of the present invention and is not intended to represent the only embodiments in which the present invention may be practiced. Each embodiment described in this disclosure is provided merely as an example or illustration of the present invention, and should not necessarily be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments. The detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the concepts of the present invention. Acronyms and other descriptive terminology may be used merely for convenience and clarity and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention. In addition, for the purposes of this disclosure, the term "coupled" means "connected to" and such connection can either be direct or, where appropriate in the context, can be indirect, e.g., through intervening or intermediary devices or other means.<br>
[0018] A wireless cornmunications device may be used to access a network or communicate witih other communication devices through one or more cellular networks. By way of example, the wireless communications device may be designed to communicate over a wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA) cellular network. Alternatively, the wireless communications device may be designed to communicate over a GSM, GPRS, EDGE, or any other cellular network. In at least one embodiment, the wireless communications device may be designed to operate over multiple cellular networks and have GPS capability. The wireless communications device, typically referred to as a subscriber station, may be any type of wireless device that can communicate over a wireless medium with a cellular network including, but not limited to, a wireless phone or terminal, a computer, a modem, a personal digital assistant and the like.<br>
[0019] A functional block diagram of a receiver system for a wireless communications device is shown in FIG. 1. The receiver system may include a GPS receiver 102 with an antenna 104. The GPS receiver 102 may be implemented with a heterodyne architecture with an intermediate frequency (IF). The receiver system may also include one or more cellular receivers including, by way of example, a WCDMA, GSM, GPRS, EDGE and/or any other cellular receiver. For ease of explanation, the receiver system is shown with a single direct conversion heterodyne cellular receiver 106 designed for WCDMA operation. Those skilled in the art will be readily able to apply the inventive concepts described throughout this disclosure to multiple cellular receiver designs. The WCDMA receiver 106 may share the antenna 104 with the GPS receiver 102, or alternatively, maybe equipped with its own. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, both the GPS receiver 102 and the WCDMA receiver 106 are coupled to the same antenna 104 to reduce cost.<br>
[0020] A LO circuit 108 may be used to provide a stable reference signal to each receiver at the appropriate frequency. The LO circuit 108 may be implemented with a tunable oscillator 110, such as a VCTCXO or other similar circuit, coupled to a pair of frequency multiplier circuits 112 and 114. The first frequency multiplier circuit 112 may be used to generate a GPS reference signal 108a suitable to convert a GPS Doppler carrier to an IF signal. The second frequency multiplier circuit 114 may be used to generate a WCDMA reference signal 1086 suitable to convert a WCDMA radio frequency (RF) carrier to a baseband signal. Additional frequency multiplier circuits may be used to support additional cellular receivers that may be present in alternative embodiments of the receiver system. The voltage applied to the tuning input of the oscillator 110 may be biased to compensate for manufacturing tolerances in frequency.<br>
[0021] The GPS receiver 102 may include any number of amplifier stages and filters to increase gain and reduce front end noise of the GPS signals from the antenna 104. The GPS signals may also be downconverted to IF signals through a mixing operation with the GPS reference signal 108a from the LO circuit 108 and sampled to produce a digital baseband signal. The digital baseband signal may then be code-correlated, demodulated and signal processed to obtain a navigational solution. The signal processing function may be performed by a computing algorithm that is enabled by the user, or alternatively, by the network. When the computing algorithm is enabled, the GPS receiver 102 is said to be in an "active" state. Once the GPS receiver 102<br>
obtains the navigational solution, it enters an "idle" state until enabled again by the user or the network.<br>
[0022] The function of the WCDMA receiver 106 is to amplify, filter and downconvert information signals from a WCDMA cellular network for use by a WCDMA processor 116. la a manner similar to the GPS receiver 102, the WCDMA receiver 108 may use any number of amplifier stages and filters to process carrier signals from the antenna 104. The information signals may be recovered from the carrier through a mixing operation with the WCDMA reference signal 108. The baseband signal from the WCDMA receiver 106 may then be provided to the WCDMA processor 116. The WCDMA processor 116 may be used to generate demodulated, error-corrected data from the information signals. The data may be text, video, audio, or any other type of data.<br>
[0023] The WCDMA processor 116 may be responsible for tuning the LO circuit 108. The tuning operation should be done in a way that niinimizes the impact on other receivers. In the embodiment of the receiver system described thus far, the performance of the GPS receiver 102 may be degraded during LO tuning, and the WCDMA processor 116 should be implemented with this in mind. One way to reduce the potential impact on other receivers is to limit the tuning period of the LO circuit 108. The criteria for limiting the tuning period may vary depending on the preferences of the designer, the particular communications application and the overall design constraints. In at least one embodiment of the WCDMA processor 116, the LO circuit 108 may be tuned for a short duration of time at repeated frequency intervals. In another embodiment of the WCDMA processor 116, the LO circuit 108 may be tuned only when the frequency error in the baseband signal exceeds a threshold. Those skilled in the art will be readily able to determine the criteria most suitable to the particular application for controlling the periodic tuning of the LO circuit 108.<br>
[0024] To illustrate the operation of the WCDMA processor 116, a periodic tuning algorithm will be described. For the purposes of this disclosure, the term "periodic" and "periodically" will mean "on occasion" without regard to the time period or frequency of the LO tuning operation, hi the described embodiment, the WCDMA processor 116 may include a frequency tracking function to detect frequency errors in the baseband signal. The frequency tracking function may be used to compensate the baseband signal for small frequency errors. For larger frequency errors, a tuning control signal 116a<br>
may be generated by the WCDMA processor 116 to tune the LO circuit 108 by adjusting the voltage applied to the tuning input of the oscillator 110. To ensure high performance, the frequency tracking function should provide baseband signal compensation even during LO tuning. One or more thresholds may be established in the WCDMA processor 116 and compared against the frequency error to determine whether the LO circuit 108 should be tuned. These thresholds,may be different depending on whether the GPS receiver 102 is in the active or idle state. A state indicator signal 102a may be provided from the GPS receiver 102 to the WCDMA processor 116 to set the thresholds. The thresholds may also be different depending on the type of cellular receiver. By way of example, the thresholds for a WCDMA receiver may be different from the thresholds for a GSM receiver. Those skilled in the art will be readily able to determine the appropriate thresholds for their particular application based on the overall design constraints and performance parameters.<br>
[0025] In at least one embodiment of the WCDMA processor 116, a first threshold may be used to begin the tuning operation of the LO circuit 108. The first threshold may be selected to best accommodate WCDMA operation and may be adjustable depending upon whether the GPS receiver 102 is in the active or idle state. To prevent GPS performance degradation during LO tuning, a tuning indicator signal 1166 may be generated by the WCDMA processor 116 and provided to the GPS receiver 102 to disable GPS operation.<br>
[0026] Once the tuning operation begins, the WCDMA processor 116 may continue tuning the LO circuit 108 until the frequency error drops below a second threshold. Like the first threshold, the second threshold may be selected to best accommodate WCDMA operation and may be adjustable depending upon whether the GPS receiver 102 is in the active or idle state. Once the frequency error drops below the second threshold, the tuning operation may be terminated, and the tuning indicator signal 1166 may be used to signal the GPS receiver 102 to resume operation.<br>
[0027] Before the GPS receiver 102 can resume operation, it must first reacquire the GPS signal. Acquisition is a coarse synchronization process giving estimates of the PRN code offset and the Doppler carrier. The process involves a two dimensional search through space and frequency in which a replica code and carrier are aligned with the received GPS signal. Multiple frequency hypotheses may be required to complete the acquisition process. To reduce the time it takes for signal acquisition, a frequency<br>
error signal 116c generated by the frequency tracking function of the WCDMA processor 116 may be provided to the GPS receiver 102. This information may be used by the GPS receiver 102 to limit the search through the frequency spectrum for the Doppler carrier.<br>
[0028] The first and second thresholds may be different. The effect of this approach is to add an element of hysteresis to the tuning operation of the LO circuit 108. This concept will be described with reference to FIG. 2 which plots the LO tuning operation as a function of frequency error. Referring to FIG. 2, one can readily see that as the frequency error increases from 0 Hz. to the first threshold frequency FI, the LO tuning operation is not performed. Below the first threshold frequency FI, the baseband signal may be compensated in the WCDMA processor for the frequency error. Should the frequency error, however, cross the first threshold frequency FI, the WCDMA processor 116 begins tuning the LO circuit 108 to reduce the frequency error. The LO tuning operation continues until the frequency error drops below fee second threshold frequency Fa. The separation between the threshold frequencies FI and F2 may be optimized by those skilled in the art to minimize the overall tuning duration of the LO circuit 108.<br>
[0029] A functional block diagram of a WCDMA processor is shown in FIG. 3. The WCDMA processor may be implemented with a complex (I-Q) architecture. For ease of explanation, the WCDMA processor 116 will be depicted functionally in FIG. 3 without reference to separate I (in-phase) and Q (quadrature) channels. The WCDMA processor 116 includes carrier and timing recovery circuits feeding a rake receiver 302. The rake receiver 302 may use independent fading of resolvable mulripaths to achieve diversity gain. Specifically, the rake receiver 302 may be configured to process one or more mulripaths of a downlink transmission to the wireless communications device. Each multipath may be fed into a separate finger processor to perform PN code despreading and orthogonal variable spreading factor (OVSF) code decovering. The rake receiver 302 may then be used to combine the result from each finger processor to recover the symbols transmitted over the downlink transmission.<br>
[0030] The rake receiver output may be used to drive a timing recovery loop 304, Timing recovery refers to the process of extracting timing information from the downlink transmission and using the timing information to synchronize a local clock. This clock (not shown) may then be used to sample the digital baseband signal from the<br>
WCDMA receiver 106 (see PIG. 1). Specifically, the tuning recovery loop 304 may be used to estimate the timing error between the symbols recovered by the RAKE receiver 302 and the local clock rate, and adjust the local clock to minimize the timing error. The local clock (not shown) may then be used to control the sampling phase of a decimator 306. Timing recovery circuits are well known in the art.<br>
[0031] The rake receiver output may also be used to drive a frequency tracking loop 308. The frequency tracking loop 308 may be used in conjunction with a rotator 310 to compensate for frequency errors in the baseband signal The rotator 310 may be implemented with a complex multiplier or other similar device. The frequency error may be computed by any number of techniques well known hi the art.<br>
[0032] The frequency error computed by the frequency tracking loop 308 may be provided to a threshold detector 312. la a manner to be described in greater detail later, the threshold detector 312 may be used to control the periodic tuning of the LO circuit 108 (see FIG. 1). The operation of the threshold detector 312 will be described with reference to the flow diagram of FIG. 4. In step 402, the threshold detector may be initialized, typically with the application of power. The threshold detector should remain in the initialization state during signal acquisition. During the initialization state, the threshold detector may be set to a first state. Although not shown in FIG. 4,, should the WCDMA processor ever need to reacquire the signal, the threshold detector should be forced back into the initialization state.<br>
[0033] Once the WCDMA processor acquires the signal, the threshold detector may exit the initialization state and set the first threshold FI hi step 404. The first threshold FI may be adjusted depending on whether the GPS receiver is in the active or idle state. Li step 406, the threshold detector receives a frequency error measurement Fe from the frequency tracking loop and compares it to the first threshold FI in step 408. If the measured frequency error Fe is less than the first threshold FI, then the threshold detector loops back to step 406 to await the next frequency error measurement Fe from the frequency tracking loop. If, on the other hand, the measured frequency error Fe exceeds the first threshold Fi, then the threshold detector may be set to a second state in step 410.<br>
[0034] Once the threshold detector output is set to the second state, the second threshold ¥2 may be set hi step 412. The second threshold F2 may be adjusted<br>
depending on whether the GPS receiver is in the active or idle state. In step 414, the threshold detector receives a new frequency error measurement Fe from the frequency tracking loop and compares it to the second threshold Fa in step 416. If the measured frequency error Fe is greater than the second threshold F2, Uien the threshold detector loops back to step 414 to await the next frequency error measurement Fe from the frequency tracking loop. If, on the other hand, the measured frequency error Fe drops below the threshold Fa, then the threshold detector output may be set back to the first state in step 418. The threshold detector then loops back to step 404 to await the next frequency error measurement Fe from the frequency tracking loop.<br>
[0035] Returning to FIG. 3, the threshold detector 312 may be used to control a switch 314. The switch 314 may be used to demultiplex the frequency error computed by the frequency tracking loop 308 onto one of two output lines depending on the state of the threshold detector 312. When the threshold detector 312 is hi the first state, the frequency error may be coupled to the rotator 310 through the switch 314. In this mode, the frequency error may be used to compensate the baseband signal without tuning the LO circuit 108 (see FIG. 1).<br>
[0036] The switch 314 may also be configured to couple the frequency error from the frequency tracking loop 308 to a converter 318 when the threshold detector 312 is in the second state. The converter 318 may be used to generate a pulse width modulated signal corresponding to the frequency error. A filter 322 may be used to convert the pulse width modulated signal to an analog voltage. The analog voltage is the tuning control signal 116a used to provide coarse tuning of the LO circuit 108 (see FIG. 1). A sealer 316 may be used to produce a digital signal that can be applied to the rotator 310 to provide fine tuning in the digital domain. To prevent GPS performance degradation, the threshold detector 312 may also be used to disable GPS operation through the tuning indicator signal 116&amp; when the threshold detector 312 is in the second state. The frequency error signal 116c from the frequency tracking loop 308 may also be provided to the GPS receiver 102 (see FIG. 1) to facilitate reacquisition of the GPS signal once the LO circuit 108 (see FIG. 1) is tuned.<br>
[0037] The WCDMA processor may also include a searcher 324 for signal acquisition and synchronization. The acquisition process involves a search through an unknown region of time and frequency in order to bring a spread spectrum pilot signal into coarse alignment with a replica code. A PN code generator 326 may be used to<br>
sequence through the different PN codes for multiple frequency hypothesis. The searcher 324 may also be used to force the threshold detector 312 into the first state during signal acquisition. With this approach, the signal acquisition process may be performed without tuning the LO circuit 108 (see FIG. 1) and disturbing GPS operation. Once the acquisition process is complete, the searcher 324 may use the pilot signal to identify strong multipath arrivals and. assign the fingers in the rake receiver 302. The rake receiver 302 uses the fingers as a timing reference to correlate the signal for each anticipated multipath reflection.<br>
