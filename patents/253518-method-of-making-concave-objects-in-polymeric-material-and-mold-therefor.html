METHOD AND GROUP FOR THE COMPRESSION MOLDING OF PREFORMS<br>
FOR CONTAINERS IN POLYMERIC MATERIAL<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
5     ThA present invention relates to the compression molding of (semi-finished)<br>
preforms intended for the subsequent realisation (typically through stretch blow<br>
molding) of concave objects, such as bottles, in polymeric material.<br>
The preform comprises an upper neck which maintains unchanged the shape of the<br>
final object and a hollow body, placed below the neck, which is instead dilated until<br>
10     it assumes a much greater capacity and a correspondingly reduced thickness.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
According to present technique, to form the preform it is first foreseen the insertion,<br>
within a rigid metal matrix (in steel) of a metered body of polymeric material whose<br>
mass is metered according to a pre-established value such to completely and exactly<br>
15 fill the molding chamber of the mold, and, subsequently, the pressure insertion of a<br>
punch within the same matrix cavity until it closes the mold's molding chamber, i.e.<br>
the chamber which, when the mold is in closed position, remains between the punch<br>
and the inner surface of the matrix and defines the shape of the preform. The punch<br>
conferring the shape to the inner surface of the preform and the matrix having an<br>
20     inner surface which confers the shape to the outer surface of the preform,<br>
A technical problem, present in the described technology and connected with said<br>
molds, arises from the fact that, in the metering of the body of polymeric material<br>
(metering) to be inserted into the matrix (typically through the separation of the body<br>
from a continuous and unshaped mass supplied by an extruder means), one inevitably<br>
25 obtains (small) differences in value with respect to the pre-established value, while<br>
the volume of the (closed) chamber of the mold, which must be completely and<br>
exactly filled with polymeric material to form the preform, is instead constant for<br>
each mold; there exists therefore the technical problem of compensating the<br>
inexactness of the mass of the metered body with respect to the reference value.<br>
30 To such end it has been proposed (see for example the publication JP 10-337769) to<br>
compensate the mass error (with respect to a reference value) by concentrating it in<br>
the zone of the neck of the preform through relative displacements between some<br><br>
WO 2006/040631	PCT/IB2005/002671<br>
2<br>
parts of the mold, in particular varying some dimensions of a flat collar normally<br>
present on the neck, having mainly the function of support of the bottle in some of<br>
the operations in which this is subjected.<br>
This solution, while having the merit of transferring the mass error into a formal<br>
5 element which disturbs neither the functionality nor the external aspect of the bottle,<br>
presents nevertheless considerable disadvantages. Indeed, said transfer of the mass<br>
error of one part of the neck occurs while a mutual (if relatively small) movement<br>
takes place among the mold components and while at the same time a cooling of the<br>
material occurs. This involves the rising of inner tensions in the zone where the error<br>
10 compensation takes place, which, when the neck subsequently undergoes mechanical<br>
stress, for example in the capping step of the bottle, may lead to the breaking or to<br>
unacceptable damage of the neck parts themselves.<br>
Moreover, for example, in the case in which, as the Japanese document foresees, said<br>
error transferring is localised in a zone where a circular groove is present on the<br>
15 collar of the neck, it occurs that when the collar itself slides along appropriate<br>
transfer guides, such groove causes undesirable friction and moreover acts as a<br>
receptacle for dirt.<br>
STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to solve said technical problem through a valid<br>
20     and effective solution.<br>
Another object of the invention is to improve at the same time the thermal exchange<br>
between the mold and preform which takes place during the molding and the<br>
subsequent solidification of the preform itself, in order to render more rapid such<br>
solidification step.<br>
25 Said and other objects are achieved by the invention herein as characterised in the<br>
claims.<br>
The method according to the invention foresees to distribute in the hollow body the<br>
mass error of the metered body with respect to the reference value, in the molding of<br>
the preform, being further foreseen that the hollow body undergoes a subsequent hot<br>
30     deformation until it achieves the final shape.<br>
When the preform, after its molding, is subsequently cooled, it is possible that the<br>
fact of distributing the mass error of the metered body in the hollow body may<br><br>
WO 2006/040631	PCT/IB2005/002671<br>
3<br>
induce the rising of inner tensions. Nevertheless, since it is foreseen that the hollow<br>
body is subjected to a subsequent heating with hot deformation until it achieves the<br>
final shape, with such heating all of the possible inner tensions are more or less<br>
eliminated. The same is valid in the case in which the preform is not cooled but is<br>
5 maintained at a sufficiently hot temperature, and is deformed until it achieves the<br>
final shape.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the compensation of the error of the metered<br>
body in the preform molding is realised with an elastic deformation of at least one<br>
part of the inner surface of the matrix. In such case the reference value of the mass of<br>
10 the metered body is calculated so that, the error taken into account, the metered body<br>
has a mass such to always fill the volume in a complete manner, calculated "in<br>
unloaded condition" (i.e. in conditions of inactivity of the mold), of the mold's<br>
molding chamber and that the error proves to be an excess of polymeric material<br>
with respect to the volume of the chamber itself. In the subsequent molding step of<br>
15 the preform, due in fact to the presence of said excess of polymeric material, at least<br>
part of the inner surface of the matrix is elastically deformed (to an extent which<br>
varies in relation to the size of the error) with respect to the shape that the same<br>
possesses "in unloaded condition", consequently increasing the thickness of the<br>
hollow body with respect to the thickness value "in unloaded condition", thereby<br>
20     absorbing the error of the metering.<br>
The excess of polymeric material is thus distributed in a homogenous and regular<br>
manner in the hollow body of the preform, determining an error in its thickness of a<br>
quite modest value (on the order of several hundredths of a millimetre).<br>
When subsequently the preform, and in particular its hollow body, is subject to<br>
25 deformation to achieve the foreseen final shape, said error of the thickness of the<br>
hollow body is distributed over a much greater surface and is thus further reduced. In<br>
practice, the initial error of the mass of the metered body becomes practically<br>
imperceptible in the final bottle, even difficult to perceive with traditional measuring<br>
instruments.<br>
30 The part of the matrix which, as said above elastically deforms, is adapted to resist<br>
such deformation to the extent that the polymeric material achieves in the final<br>
molding step a pressure of value substantially equal to the pre-established design<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
An example of a preform which is desired to be obtained according to the invention<br>
25     is illustrated in FIG. 5. This preform, indicated with 9, is for realising (typically<br>
through stretch blow molding) bottles in thermoplastic resin PET and comprises a<br>
neck 91, having the final shape foreseen in the bottle, and a hollow body 92 intended,<br>
in the realisation step of the bottle, to form the container body of the same.<br>
Generally, the neck 91 is provided with projections which define, for example, a<br>
30     thread 93 projecting radially outward suited to receive a common screw cap. The<br>
hollow body 92 has on the other hand a continuous outer surface, generally nearly<br>
cylindrical (slightly tapered toward the bottom for delivery reasons) and terminating<br><br>
WO 2006/040631	PCT/IB2005/002671<br>
5<br>
in the lower end with a more or less spherical cap. In particular, the hollow body 92<br>
comprises a side wall 92a, typically substantially cylindrical, and a bottom wall 92b,<br>
typically in the form of a cap.<br>
The preform 9 is obtained with a process of compression molding through the<br>
5 pressure insertion of a punch 11 (male element of the mold) within a closed-cavity<br>
hollow matrix (female part of the mold), loaded with a metered body 8 of polymeric<br>
material (in particular a thermoplastic resin) at the more or less viscous pasty state,<br>
whose mass is metered according to a reference value.<br>
The molding machine which utilises the mold according to the invention is typically<br>
10 but not exclusively of the continuously rotating turntable type, and typically but not<br>
exclusively operates with a plurality of equal molding groups which are operated in<br>
sequence.<br>
Illustrated in the figures is only a generic meld according to the invention. The<br>
machine on the other hand is not illustrated, being per se of traditional type.<br>
15 The mold according to the invention comprises a matrix and a punch 11. Together,<br>
punch 11 and matrix cavity give rise to a molding chamber 7 which confers the<br>
desired shape to the preform 9. The cavity of the matrix confers shape to the outer<br>
surface of the preform while the outer surface of the punch 11 confers shape to the<br>
inner surface of the preform 9.<br>
20 According to the embodiment illustrated in the figures, the matrix of the mold is<br>
formed by:<br>
an upper matrix part 20 having inner surface 21 adapted to form the outer surface of<br>
the upper neck 91 of the preform, divided into at least two sectors adapted to be<br>
distanced between each other to permit the extraction of the preform 9,<br>
25 a lower matrix part 30 having inner surface adapted to form the outer surface of the<br>
hollow body 92 of the preform.<br>
The two upper 20 and lower 30 matrix parts may be separated from each other in the<br>
loading step of the metered body 8, which is inserted in the cavity of the only lower<br>
matrix part 30; the inner surface areas of said upper 20 and lower 30 matrix parts are<br>
30     adapted, when they are operatively associated to each other, to form the entire cavity<br>
of the matrix.<br>
Alternatively, the two matrices are maintained associated to each other also in the<br><br>
WO 2006/040631	PCT/IB2005/002671<br>
6<br>
loading step of the metered body.<br>
According to the invention, the lower matrix part 30 comprises an undeformable<br>
support body 40 which houses at its interior at least one deformable wall 31 realised<br>
in steel (or in an equivalent material) whose inner surface defines at least a part of<br>
5 the inner surface of the lower matrix part, having at least a portion in the shape of<br>
foil having a relatively thin thickness which permits it to be elastically deformed<br>
under the pressure of the polymeric material in the final molding step of the preform<br>
so to vary, in particular to increase, the thickness of the hollow body. The<br>
deformation of the wall 31 occurs mainly by bending the section along the generic<br>
10 axial plane, together with deformations by traction, while the thickness of the wall<br>
does not undergo considerable variations.<br>
According to the first embodiment, illustrated in Fig. 1, the lower matrix part 30<br>
comprises a portion 38 having tubular form, in particular substantially cylindrical,<br>
which defines said deformable wall 31, whose inner surface 31' confers the shape, at<br>
15     least in part (and in particular, as illustrated, almost completely) of the outer surface<br>
of the side wall 92a of the hollow body 92, which wall 31 has a relatively thin<br>
thickness which permits it to be elastically deformed under the pressure of the<br>
polymeric material.<br>
The deformable wall 31 is housed, in particular it is enclosed, within a coaxial cavity<br>
20 36 made in the support body 40; whose inner surface is placed a distance from the<br>
outer surface of the wall 31, such that this may be radially deformed without being<br>
hindered by the body 40 itself.<br>
The deformable wall 31 comprises an enlarged section which defines a circular band<br>
32 near the upper end and a second enlarged section, near the lower end, which<br>
25 defines a second circular band 33. Said circular bands 32 and 33 have respective<br>
outer cylindrical surfaces 32' and 33' which abut corresponding seats 34 and 35<br>
made in the coaxial cavity 36 of the support body 40; thus defined are two circular<br>
radial abutting zones for the wall 31 which also serve for the centring of the wall 31.<br>
Said surfaces 32' and 33' are perfectly cylindrical so that the abutting operates only<br>
30     in the radial direction. The upper band 32 also has a shoulder 32a which is blocked in<br>
the axial direction by the seat 34.<br>
Along the generic section in the axial plane, the deformable wall 31 comprises, from<br><br>
WO 2006/040631	PCT/IB2005/002671<br>
7<br>
one side and from the other with respect to the axis, two end portions defined by the<br>
circular bands 32 and 33, which form abutments which hinder radial displacement<br>
and a central portion, laminar and having a relatively thin thickness compared with<br>
the axial length in a single body with the two end portions, free to elastically bend in<br>
5     the radial direction, forming an arch in the axial plane.<br>
In detail, the support body 40 comprises a first tubular body 41 and a second, upper<br>
body 42 bound together with the first in monolithic manner by an outer envelope 43<br>
and by an upper closing element 44 associated to the envelope 43. The cavity 36 is<br>
made nearly entirely in the lower body 41.<br>
!0     Inside the first body 41 an undeformable central body 45 is placed whose upper<br>
surface 45' defines the outer surface of the bottom wall 92b of the hollow body 92.<br>
The lower band 33 is also blocked in the axial direction by the respective seat 35.<br>
More precisely, a lower shoulder is foreseen near the lower end of the inner wall 31<br>
which comes into contact with the upper end edge of the central body 45 in order to<br>
15 ensure the continuity between the inner surface 31' of the wall 31 and the upper<br>
surface 45' of the central body 45.<br>
The cavity 36 is connected, through conduits 46 and others (not illustrated), with<br>
means adapted to introduce, circulate and discharge refrigerant fluids capable of<br>
removing heat from the preform in a thermal conditioning step (cooling) of the same.<br>
20 The deformable wall 31 lends itself in a particular manner to this end due to the fact<br>
that it possesses a relatively thin thickness, which greatly favours the transmission of<br>
heat through it.<br>
Moreover, the deformable wall 31 may have different reliefs 37 placed along the<br>
outer surface, which define the elements of thermal exchange; these elements are<br>
25 interrupted in the circumferential direction in order not to hinder the elastic radial<br>
dilation of the deformable wall 31 in the molding step.<br>
In the embodiment illustrated in Fig. 1A e IB, the reliefs 37 have the shape of fins<br>
which project radially and which extend for a distance in the axial direction; these<br>
reliefs are moreover placed alternately between one line and the other in order to<br>
30     realise maximum turbulence in the passage of the refrigerant fluid and therefore<br>
maximise the thermal exchange with the wall 31.<br>
In the embodiment illustrated in Fig. 1C the reliefs 37 have the shape of rings placed<br><br>
WO 2006/040631	PCT/IB2005/002671<br>
8<br>
on planes transverse to the axis of the wall 31 and nevertheless interrupted in order to<br>
not realise stiffening ribs which may hinder the radial dilation of the wall 31.<br>
There may be foreseen, moreover, appropriate ducts (not shown in the figures)<br>
adapted to cool and/or thermoregulate the central body 45 so to cool and/or<br>
5     thermoregulate through such body the lower end portion of the preform.<br>
The punch 11 is integrally fixed to an upper body 10 with which it forms a single<br>
body and of which it defines the lower end portion, that which confers shape to the<br>
inner surface of the preform. In detail, the upper body 10 comprises a shoulder<br>
adapted to abut against the upper end 23 of the upper matrix part 20, and a lower<br>
10     portion 10" which in its lower section is united to the punch 11 itself.<br>
The upper surface 91b of the upper end edge of the neck 91 of the preform 9 is<br>
formed in part by a narrow, downward-turned upper surface 21b, which terminates<br>
with a substantially horizontal tengent which defines the upper border of the inner<br>
surface 21 of the upper matrix part 20, and in part is formed by a narrow upper<br>
15     surface 12b, downward-turned and terminating with a substantially horizontal<br>
tangent, which defines the upper border of the outer surface of the punch 11, at the<br>
border with the lower end of the lower portion 10" of the upper body 10 (see Fig.<br>
ID).<br>
When the two said upper surfaces 12b and 21b are aligned with each other, the mold<br>
20     is then in closed position, i.e. the punch 11 and the matrix parts 20 and 30 are<br>
mutually coupled such that the mold cavity defines the molding chamber 7 in which,<br>
between the inner surface of the matrix parts 20 and 30 and the surface of the punch<br>
11, lies defined the shape of the preform.<br>
In operation, it is first foreseen (Fig. 2A) to insert in the cavity of the matrix a<br>
25 metered body 8 of polymeric material, whose mass is metered according to a<br>
reference value which is established such that, taken into account the error which<br>
inevitably exists in the metering of such body, the body 8 itself always fills in a<br>
complete manner the volume of the molding chamber 7 of the mold calculated "in<br>
unloaded condition" and that the error proves to be an excess of polymeric material<br>
30     with respect to the volume of the chamber itself.<br>
Subsequently, the mutual approaching among the mold components is carried out,<br>
for example, following a lifting of the lower matrix part 30, operated through a lower<br><br>
WO 2006/040631	PCT/IB2005/002671<br>
9<br>
device (not shown in the figures) while the upper body 10, which bears the punch 11,<br>
and the punch itself on the other hand remain still.<br>
In the figures from 2A to 2D a horizontal reference axis is indicated with an X,<br>
which remains fixed, passing tlvrough the lower abutting shoulder of the upper<br>
5     portion 10' of the body 10.<br>
It is nevertheless obvious that that of importance here is the movement related to the<br>
mutual approaching; this may be obtained, alternatively, following a downward<br>
movement of the upper body 10, possibly together with an upward movement of the<br>
lower device which bears the matrix.<br>
10 First, (Fig. 2B) the punch 11 begins to penetrate into the cavity of the lower matrix<br>
part 30, beginning to progressively deform the metering 8.<br>
Subsequently, the upper end of the lower matrix part 30 comes to couple with the<br>
lower end of the upper matrix part 20 (position illustrated in Fig. 2C) and the punch<br>
11 continues to penetrate in the cavity of the matrix, continuing to deform the<br>
15 metering 8. The sectors which form the upper matrix part 20 are locked in radially<br>
closed position through an upper annular body 14 (of known type) associated to the<br>
punch 11 and vertically moving with respect to it, whose lower end portion possesses<br>
a concave frustoconical surface 14a, which mates with a complementary outer and<br>
upper side surface 26 of the upper matrix part 20, it too of frustoconical shape.<br>
20 Subsequently, the punch 11 continues to penetrate (always following upward<br>
displacements of the lower device which bears the matrix) within the matrix cavity<br>
until it produces the complete closing of the mold, which occurs when the two<br>
surfaces 12b and 21b are in contact with each other (position shown in Fig, 2D). At<br>
this point the penetration of the punch terminates.<br>
25 During this final molding step of the preform, it occurs that first, when the molding<br>
chamber 7 is still not closed, the polymeric material of the metering completely fills<br>
such chamber 7, while the deformable wall 31 is not yet deformed, at least in<br>
appreciable terms, achieving appropriately high pressure values, in the range of the<br>
design values foreseen at the end of the molding. Then, the penetration of the punch<br>
30 continuing further into the matrix cavity until the closing of the mold, since the<br>
polymeric material has an excess volume with respect to the volume of the chamber<br>
7, such material, pushed by the pressure produced by the penetration of the punch,<br><br>
WO 2006/040631	PCT/IB2005/002671<br>
10<br>
causes the elastic wall 31, whose generic axial section is free to bend, not having any<br>
constraint other than the abutments provided by the bands 32 and 33, to be elastically<br>
deformed with outward radial displacement until said excess volume is absorbed.<br>
5 The elastic deformation which the deformable wall 31 undergoes is of bending type<br>
in the section along a generic axial plane, with displacement of the axially middle<br>
zone of the wall itself which bends outward, said displacement being as great as said<br>
excess volume of the metering. On the other hand, along the generic transverse<br>
plane, the deformation which the elastic wall 31  undergoes, in tubular form<br>
10     according to the first embodiment (fig. 1A), consists of an increase in the diameter of<br>
the tubular wall itself which achieves maximum value in the axially middle zone.<br>
The tubular wall 31 is therefore subject to stress composed of elastic bending and<br>
traction together. The described deformation of the wall 31 illustrated in figures I<br>
and 1A, produces a distributed and regular increase of the thickness of the side wall<br>
15 92a of the hollow body 92 which achieves maximum value in the intermediate zone<br>
thereof, while such thickness remains nearly unchanged at the bands 32 and 33 since<br>
these are scarcely deformable.<br>
The elastic deformation does not even involve other parts of the matrix, and in<br>
particular the upper part 20 which gives shape to the neck 91, which remain instead<br>
20     unaltered.<br>
The error of the mass of the metering with respect to the reference value is therefore<br>
distributed in the preform part placed at the deformable wall 31 and hence in the<br>
hollow body 92.<br>
The reference value of the mass of the metering 8 is calculated so that taking into<br>
25 account both the error in the formation of the metering 8 and the volumetric<br>
shrinkage which occurs in the cooling of the preform during the molding, the<br>
complete filling of the molding chamber 7 is realised and moreover such that the<br>
polymeric mass is subjected, in the final step of the molding, to a pressure having<br>
appropriate design values (on the order of several hundred bar). In particular, it may<br>
30 be foreseen that said reference value is such that the polymeric material of the<br>
metering has always a greater volume than the volume of the molding chamber and<br>
that therefore the deformable wall 7 always undergoes a deformation, of a more or<br><br>
WO 2006/040631	PCT/IB2005/002671<br>
11<br>
less significant measure.<br>
For its own part the deformable wall 31 is designed with structural characteristics (in<br>
particular the material and the thickness in relation with the length) such that it can<br>
be elastically deformed so to absorb the excess volume of the metering and provide<br>
5 at the same time, in virtue of only its own structural characteristics (without the<br>
intervention of outside means or actions), a sufficient resistance to elastic<br>
deformation to allow that the polymeric material of the metering achieves in the final<br>
molding step said design values regarding the pressure, where moreover the<br>
deformation of the wall 31 takes place following the complete filling of the molding<br>
10     chamber.<br>
Therefore, the deformable wall 31 shall be sized in relation with several parameters<br>
including the force of the molding in play and the size of the errors of the metering.<br>
For example, for a preform having a mass of 24 grams, and having a totai axiai<br>
length of 100 mm, it was utilised, in the lower matrix part 30, a deformable wall 31<br>
15 in stainless steel, with low values of carbon and high values of Mo, Ni, Co and Ti,<br>
whose thickness in the central part comprised between two abutments defined by the<br>
bands 32 and 33 is approximately 2.5 mm. In the test operation, foreseeing for the<br>
mass of the metered body 8 a maximum error of 1 %, radial deformations were<br>
detected in the wall 31 on the order of 0.02-0.05 mm.<br>
20 In the second embodiment, illustrated in Fig. 3, the deformable wall 31 comprises a<br>
side portion 38 having tubular form (substantially equal to the whole wall 31 of the<br>
first embodiment) in particular substantially cylindrical, whose inner surface 38'<br>
defines at least in part (and in particular, as illustrated, nearly completely) the outer<br>
surface of the side wall 92a of the hollow body 92, and also a bottom portion 39, in<br>
25      the shape of a cap joined in a single body to the side portion 38, whose inner surface<br>
39' defines the outer surface of the bottom wall 92b of the hollow body 92.<br>
This deformable wall 31 has nearly entirely a relatively thin thickness which permits<br>
it to be elastically deformed, under the pressure of the polymeric material, both in the<br>
side portion 38 and in the bottom portion 39.<br>
30     The two said circular bands 32 and 33 are present, placed at the respective upper and<br>
lower ends of the side portion 38.<br>
The coaxial cavity 36, in this case, also wraps around the bottom portion 39 of the<br><br>
WO 2006/040631	PCT/IB2005/002671<br>
12<br>
wall 31.<br>
Said lower seat 35, on which abuts the lower band 33, defines a cylindrical abutment<br>
surface and is made on a limited number of radial and axial fins 48 which permit the<br>
communication between the lower and upper part of the cavity 36.<br>
5 The abutment between the band 33 and the respective abutment seat 35 permits the<br>
axial sliding of the band itself, so to not hinder the axial elastic deformation of the<br>
deformable wall 31.<br>
Therefore, also in this second embodiment, as in the first, the deformable wall 31<br>
comprises a deformable tubular portion 38 which has, along the generic axial section,<br>
10 from one side and the other with respect to the axis, two end portions defined by the<br>
circular bands 32 and 33, which form abutments which hinder the radial<br>
displacement, and a central portion, laminar and having a relatively thin thickness in<br>
relation with the axial length, in a single body with the two end portions, free to<br>
elastically bend in radial direction, forming an arch in the axial plane. Moreover it<br>
15      also comprises a deformable bottom portion 39 which has, along generic axial<br>
section, two end portions, both defined by the circular band 33, and a central portion,<br>
having a relatively thin thickness in relation with the length, free to elastically bend<br>
in the axial direction.<br>
The cavity 36 is connected, through a lower mouth 49 made in the central body 45b<br>
20 and other not-illustrated conduits, with means adapted to circulate refrigerant fluids<br>
capable of removing heat from the preform in a step of thermal conditioning<br>
(cooling) of the same.<br>
In operation, this embodiment differs from the preceding for the fact that the pressure<br>
exerted by the metering 8 on the inner surface of the molding chamber 7 causes an<br>
25 elastic deformation both of the side portion 38 and the bottom portion 39 of the<br>
deformable wall 31 and therefore the error of the metering is apportioned also to the<br>
bottom portion 92b, in addition to the side portion 92a of the hollow body 92.<br>
Moreover, the deformable wall 31 is subject to both bending and axial elongation<br>
deformations.<br>
30 Also in the third embodiment, illustrated in Fig. 4, as in the second, the deformable<br>
wall 31 comprises a side portion 38 having tubular form (substantially equal to the<br>
whole wall 31 of the first embodiment) in particular substantially cylindrical, whose<br><br>
WO 2006/040631	PCT/IB2005/002671<br>
13<br>
inner surface 38' defines at least in part (and in particular, as illustrated, almost<br>
completely) the outer surface of the side wall 92a of the hollow body 92, and also a<br>
bottom portion 39, in the shape of a cap joined to the side portion 38, whose inner<br>
surface 39' defines the outer surface of the bottom wall 92b of the hollow body 92.<br>
5 Nevertheless, unlike the second embodiment, this foresees that the two portions 38<br>
and 39 are separated from each other and in any case associated to form a continuity<br>
of the respective inner surfaces.<br>
Said lower circular band 33 is made in the upper circular border of the bottom<br>
portion 39 and in correspondence thereof the two portions 38 and 39 are mutually<br>
10     fixed. The band 33 has a series of radial-axial ribs 51 whose free radial ends define a<br>
cylindrical surface which abuts against the lower seat 35, it too cylindrical.<br>
Here too, as in the preceding embodiment, the coaxial cavity 36 also wraps around<br>
the bottom portion 39 of the wall 31 and the lower seat 35, and the ribs 51 permit the<br>
communication between the lower part of the cavity 36 and the upper part thereof.<br>
15     In particular, inside the tubular body 41 there is a central body 45b whose upper<br>
surface is placed a distance from the lower surface of the bottom portion 39.<br>
The abutment between the band 33 and the respective abutment seat 35 permits the<br>
axial sliding of the band itself, so to not hinder the axial elastic deformation of the<br>
deformable wall 31.<br>
20 The cavity 36 is connected, through a lower mouth 52 made in the central body 45b<br>
and other not-illustrated conduits, with means adapted to circulate refrigerant fluids<br>
in the cavity 36 itself capable of removing heat from the preform in a step of thermal<br>
conditioning (cooling) of the same. In the lower part of the cavity 36, below the<br>
abutment ribs 51, there are several fins 53 projecting upward from the central body<br>
25     45b, adapted to better direct the flux of the refrigerant fluid, and which do not hinder<br>
the deformation of the wall 31 with which they do not come into contact. Also in this<br>
third embodiment, the error of the metering is apportioned also to the bottom portion<br>
92b, in addition to the side portion 92a of the hollow body 92.<br>
There may moreover be foreseen several conduits 54, made in the support body 40,<br>
30 in particular in the central body 45b and in the fins 53, which cross the ribs 51 and<br>
the lower band 33, which lead in correspondence with the surfaces of mutual<br>
connection between the lower end of the side portion 38 and the upper end of the<br><br>
WO 2006/040631	PCT/IB2005/002671<br>
14<br>
bottom portion 39.<br>
Said conduits 54 may be advantageously connected with suction means in order to<br>
clear the air present in the cavity of the mold before and during the compression step<br>
of the metering.<br>
5     Moreover, or alternatively, the conduits 54 may be advantageously connected with<br>
means adapted to inject air or another thermally conditioned fluid inside the cavity,<br>
before the opening step of the mold, to favour the cooling and the detachment of the<br>
preform after its molding.<br>
The fourth embodiment (Fig. 6) consists of a variation of the first embodiment<br>
10 (figure 1 and 1A) in which the central body 45 was modified according to the<br>
teaching of the invention described in the patent application n. PCT/IB2005/002303<br>
(claiming the priority of the Italian patent application n.RE2004A000127 of the same<br>
Applicant), mainiy in order to increase the capacity of the matrix to receive the<br>
metering. In particular, the central body 45 is realised so to comprise a first<br>
15     component body 451 and a second component body 452, situated centrally with<br>
regards to the first, having respectively inner surfaces 453 and 454 which may be<br>
aligned in a complementary manner to define, together, the inner surface 45'.<br>
The first component body 451 is integrally fixed to the remaining lower matrix part,<br>
in particular it is integrally fixed to the body 41. The second component body 452 is<br>
20 movable with respect to the first component body 451 between an upper position<br>
(illustrated with a continuous line in Fig. 6) in which its inner surface 454 is placed<br>
in aligned or nearly aligned position with the inner surface 453 of the first<br>
component body 451 and a back position (illustrated with a dashed line in Fig. 6) in<br>
which its inner surface 454 is placed a distance from the inner surface of the first<br>
25 component body in order to increase the volume of the cavity of the lower part of the<br>
matrix. Finally, operation means are foreseen (not illustrated in the figures) adapted<br>
to arrange said second component body in said back position in the loading step of a<br>
metering of polymeric material in the cavity of the lower matrix part 30 and to bring<br>
it to the upper position in the molding step.<br>
30 In operation, first a metering is formed outside of the mold and then inserted in the<br>
cavity of the lower matrix part, while the second component body 452 is in said back<br>
position.<br><br>
WO 2006/040631	PCT/IB2005/002671<br>
15<br>
Subsequently, the progressive insertion of the punch in the matrix cavity is carried<br>
out until the closing of the mold, with modalities equal or similar to those described<br>
above with reference to the figures 2A to 2D, while the second component body 452<br>
is maintained in said back position.<br>
5 Once the complete penetration of the punch 11 in the matrix cavity is realised until<br>
the closing of the mold (in which the lower matrix part 30 is coupled with the upper<br>
part 20 and the two surfaces 12b and 21b are in mutual contact), the upward<br>
displacement is produced of the second component body 452 until it reaches the<br>
upper position. This final step may begin after the closing of the mold, or a little<br>
10     before.<br>
In this last step, the polymeric material is pushed to completely fill the molding<br>
chamber and then to deform the elastic wall 31, thereby increasing the thickness of<br>
the hollow body, until the excess volume of the metering is absorbed.<br>
The upper position does not necessarily coincide with the position in which the<br>
15 surface 454 of the second component body 452 represents the exact geometric<br>
continuation of the surface 453 of the other component body 451 ("nominal position"<br>
of design) but is separated from this in a variable manner, in relation with a level of<br>
error of the mass of the metering. This upper position may therefore result below<br>
said "nominal position".<br>
20     According to a further embodiment (not shown in the figures) it is foreseen that<br>
said deformable inner wall 31 comprises only the bottom portion and that therefore<br>
the error of the metering is apportioned only to the bottom portion 92b of the hollow<br>
body 92.<br>
According  to  the  invention,  the preform,  after its  molding,  is  cooled  and<br>
25 subsequently subjected to a process of deformation through stretch blow molding in<br>
which the hollow body is newly heated, until the desired shape of the container is<br>
achieved. Alternatively, the preform is subjected to the process of deformation<br>
through stretch blow molding v/hile the temperature of its hollow body is still<br>
sufficiently hot.<br>
30 Thanks to the invention, firstly, the error of the mass of the metering is distributed in<br>
a continuous manner and over a relatively quite wide surface such that no trace is left<br>
in the exterior aspect of the final containers which are obtained at the end of the<br><br>
WO 2006/040631	PCT/IB2005/002671<br>
16<br>
entire process; nor is it possible to perceive, in practice, size variations between one<br>
final container and the other.<br>
Moreover, after the molding of the preform, the possible further tensions which form<br>
in the distribution of the error of the metered body in the hollow body are eliminated<br>
5 with the hollow body's subsequent heating; or else such tensions do not even form<br>
since the temperature of the hollow body is maintained sufficiently high and the mass<br>
is maintained in a more or less viscous fluid state.<br>
The fourth embodiment (Fig. 6) increases the volume of the cavity of the lower<br>
matrix part, with respect to that of a traditional mold, in the step in which it receives<br>
10 the metering, and thus renders such cavity capable of receiving metered bodies<br>
having higher mass and/or height than would otherwise be receivable. Moreover, it<br>
renders possible the compensation of relatively greater mass errors, thanks to the fact<br>
that to the compensation which is obtained through the elastic deformation of the<br>
elastic wall 31 a compensation may be added, obtained by ensuring that the upper<br>
15 position of the component body 452 does not exactly coincide with said "nominal<br>
position", but is separated from this to compensate for at least a part of the metering<br>
error.<br><br>

(31) comprises a side portion (38) and a bottom portion (39) which are separated<br>
from each other and in any case associated to form continuity of their respective<br>
inner surfaces.<br>
5 21. Mold according to claim 20, characterised in that it comprises at least one<br>
conduit (54), which leads in correspondence with the surfaces of mutual<br>
connection between the lower end of the side portion (38) and the upper end of<br>
the bottom portion (39), said conduit (54) being connected with suction means<br>
adapted to clear the air present in the cavity of the mold before and during the<br>
10     compression step of the metering.<br>
22. Mold according to claim 20, characterised in that it comprises at least one<br>
conduit (54), which across the deformable wall (31) leads in correspondence<br>
with the surfaces of mutual connection between the lower end of the side portion<br>
15 (38) and the upper end of the bottom portion (39), said conduit (54) being<br>
connected with means adapted to inject air or other thermally conditioned fluid<br>
inside the cavity, before the opening step of the mold, to favour the cooling and<br>
the detachment of the preform.<br>
AMENDED SHEET<br><br>
The preform is formed by an upper neck which<br>
maintains unchanged its form in the final object and a hollow body,<br>
joined to the neck. The method foresees the insertion, within a<br>
matrix cavity, of a metered body of polymeric material whose<br>
mass is metered according to a reference value, and the subsequent<br>
pressure insertion of a punch within the matrix cavity until it closes<br>
the mold's molding chamber, the punch conferring the shape to<br>
the inner surface of the preform and the matrix having an inner<br>
surface which confers the shape to the outer surface of the preform.<br>
According to the invention, in the molding of the preform, the error<br>
of the mass of the metered body with respect to the reference value<br>
is distributed in the hollow body, which undergoes a subsequent<br>
hot deformation until it achieves the final shape. In the mold, the<br>
matrix comprises at least one deformable wall (31) whose inner<br>
surface defines at least part of the inner surface of the matrix part<br>
intended to give form to the hollow body of the preform, said<br>
deformable wall (31) having, at least in part, a relatively thin<br>
thickness which permits it to be elastically deformed under the<br>
pressure of the polymeric material in the final preform molding<br>
step, thereby varying the thickness of the hollow body.<br></td>
