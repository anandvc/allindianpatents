SPECIFICATION<br>
CATALYST AND PROCESS FOR PRODUCING UNSATURATED ALDEHYDE AND UNSATURATED ACID<br>
Field of Industrial Application<br>
The present invention relates to a process forproducing unsaturated aldehyde and unsaturated acid and a catalyst used therefor.<br>
Prior Art<br>
Various hybrid oxide catalyst containing molybdenum, bismuth and iron and used for the catalytic oxidation of an olefin having 3 or 4 carbon atoms in a gas phase to form the corresponding unsaturated aldehyde and unsaturated acid were already proposed, and some of them are used on an industrial scale. These catalysts are typified by, for example, those described in Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 27490/1972, 42241/1972, 1645/1973 and 61011/1982*xn4<soorv.></soorv.>
However, various problems are posed in the production of unsaturated aldehyde or both unsaturated aldehyde and unsaturated acid on an industrial scale in the presence of such a catalyst.<br>
One of the problems is that local, abnormally heated portions (hot spots) are formed in the catalyst layer. The hot spots are formed because the gas-phase catalytic reaction is an exothermic reaction. To improve the productivity in the production of unsaturated aldehyde and unsaturated acid on an industrial scale, it is a usual practice to increase the concentration of the starting olefin or to increased the space velocity.<br>
However, under such high load reaction condition, an increase in the heat buildup in the hot spots causes shortening of the catalyst life, excess oxidation reaction and, in the worst case, runaway of the reaction.<br>
Although it is a common practice to content oneself with a low productivity or to take countermeasures such as reduction in the diameter of the reaction tube against the formation of hot spots or abnormal heat buildup<br><br>
in the hot spots, it cannot but be said that they are economically disadvantageous.<br>
Various investigations have been made and reported for securing an economical production on an industrial scale while avoiding the dangers caused by the hot spots in the reaction operation. Methods proposed hitherto include, for example, a method wherein a substance inert to hot spot-forming catalysts is mixed in the catalyst to dilute it (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 10614/1972) and a method wherein the catalyst used is tubular (Japanese Patent Publication No. 36739/1987).  In addition, the following methods have also been proposed: a method wherein two reaction zones are formed in a reaction tube (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 127013/1976, a method wherein, in<br>
r<br>
the oxidation of propylene, two or more kinds of catalysts having activities different from each other, which are produced by varying the composition (particularly the kind and/or amount of the alkaline metal), are fed into a reaction tube along its axis so that the activities of the catalysts are gradually increased in the direction from the inlet for the starting gas toward the outlet (Japanese Patent Publication No. 38331/1988), and a method wherein catalysts having different space occupation are fed into a reaction tube so that the occupied space is gradually reduced in the direction from the inlet side toward the outlet side of the reaction tube to form two or more reaction zones along the axis of the reaction tube (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 217932/1992).<br>
However, in the method wherein the catalyst is diluted with an inert substance, the time taken for charging the catalyst into a reactor is increased in the periodic maintenance of plants, since the inert substance used for the dilution is to be homogeneously mixed with the catalyst before the charging. In addition, since the homogeneous mixing is not always possible in this method, heat buildup is rather increased in the hot spots in the portions of a high catalyst concentration. Another disadvantage of this method is that the hot spots are different from each other in the position and temperature in each reaction tube, which is inconvenient for the reaction<br><br>
reaction conditions, wherein the heat buildup in the hot spots in the catalyst layer is controlled without necessitating any complicated feeding operation as necessitated in the prior art to obtain a high yield of the intended product, and a stable production can be continued for a long period of time by preventing the catalyst from undergoing deterioration caused by heat load.<br>
Means for Solving the Problem<br>
In exothermic reactions like the above-described gas-phase catalytic oxidation reaction, catalytically active components have been shaped in various wa^s in the prior art and the shaped articles mainly comprise catalytically active components. Supposing that the catalyst is the site for the gas-phase catalytic oxidation reaction, heat generation occurs exactly on the catalyst. Accordingly, when the shaped catalyst is used for the reaction, the heat generated by the reaction concentrates tkiiwwi i induce—thgHFdrmation of hot spots. After intensive investigations roatfS^IB^Tiie^pnrpose"of* reducing^ithe apparent density of the catalytically active component to avoid the concentration of the heat of reaction generated on the catalyst, the inventors have found that the purpose can be attained by controlling the amount of the catalytically active component to be loaded on an inactive carrier, the particle size of the catalyst and the calcining temperature. The present invention has been completed on the basis of this finding. Accordingly, the present invention relates to'<br>
a catalyst obtained by loading a catalytically active component on a carrier andAcaicining the loaded catalyst, characterized by a particle diameter of the catalyst of 4 to 16 mm, an average particle diameter of the carrier of 3 to 12 mm, a calcining temperature of 500 to 600 °C and an amount of the catalytically active component loaded on the carrier of 5 to 80 % by weight [(weight of the catalytically active component)/(weight of the catalytically active component + weight of the carrier + weight of a strength improver) ]„ Ike c^UXu*tT oP b^e p-rese^f 7nStjr\tio&gt;^ k  pie&amp;r«Ku<xv cwd></xv><br><br><br>
obtaining the catalyst of the present invention is not particularly limited so far as the metal element is the same as that used as the catalytically active component of a catalyst usually used for the gas phase catalytic oxidation reaction of olefin or tertiary alcohol.  Among such catalysts, the one represented by theyvformula (1) ja tho above item (2t* is preferred.<br>
The catalytically active component is usually prepared by the methods known per se, such as the coprecipitation method, and the starting materials used in the method, which are not particularly limited, are, for example, nitrates, ammonium salts, hydroxides, etc., of the metal elements constituting the catalytically active component. The catalytically active component itevj^ usually calcined at 200 to 600 °C for 2 to 7 hours before being loaded on the carrier to form a pre-calcined powder. The pre-calcining is conducted preferably in air or nitrogen stream.<br>
In loading the pre-calcined powder on the carrier, a molding aid and/or a strength improver is preferably used. Examples of the molding aids usable herein include crystalline cellulose, starch and stearic acid. The molding aid^ is used usually in an amount of 30 % by weight or less based on the pre-calcined powder. Examples of the strength improvers usable herein include ceramic fibers, carbon fibers and whiskers. The strength improver is used usually in an amount of 30 % by weight or below based on the pre-calcined powder. The molding aid and/or strength improver may be mixed with the pre-calcined powder prior to loading the catalyst on the carrier or when, before or after the pre-calcined powder and other materials are fed into a molding machine as will be described before.<br>
In loading the pre-calcined powder on the carrier, also a binder is preferably used. Examples of the binders usable herein include water, high-molecular binders such as polyvinyl alcohols, inorganic binders such as silica sol and alumina sol, polyhydric alcohols such as ethylene glycol and glycerol, and mixtures of them.<br>
The binder is used in an amount of usually 10 to 60 % based on the pre-calcined powder.<br><br>
The shape of the carrier is not particularly limited and the carrier may be, for example, spherical, cylindrical or tubular. From the viewpoints of the production efficiency and the mechanical strength of the catalyst, the spherical shape is preferred. The average particle diameter of the carrier which is suitably determined depending on the inner diameter of the reaction tube in which the catalyst is to be fed and the amount of the catalytically active component-containing powder to be carried is usually 3 to 12 mm, preferably 3. 5 to 9 mm, roof e p^e?e^&gt;Vj&amp;*1 tolm^.<br>
Any carrier which is catalytically inactive and porous or which can be shaped into porous particles is available. Examples of the materials usable as the carrier include a-alumina, silicon carbide, pumice, silica, zirconium oxide and titanium oxide.<br>
The catalytically active component can be loaded on the carrier by any method capable of uniformly loading the component on the carrier such as the tumbling granulation method, the method wherein a centrifugal fluidization coater is used or the wash coating method. From the viewpoint of the production efficiency of the catalyst, the tumbling granulation method is preferred. In particular, in this preferred method, an apparatus having a disc having a smooth or rough surface at the bottom of a fixed cylindrical vessel is used, and the disc is rotated at such a high speed that the carrier charged in the vessel is violently stirred by the rotation of the carrier itself and also by the revolution. The catalytically active component and, if necessary, the binder, molding aid and strength improver are added thereto to load the powder components on the carrier. The amount of the catalytically active component which varies depending on the operation conditions such as the inner diameter of the reaction tube is usually 5 to 80 % by weight, preferably 10 to 60 % by weighty .more f^k*^l\^«-to5D % ~b^e,.{-)ktete/: (weight of the catalytically active component + weight of the carrier + weight of the strength improver (optional component))3 (hereinafter referred to as the catalyst-loading rate). The term "weight of the catalytically active component" refers to the weight of the pre-calcined powder. By the tumbling granulation method<br><br>
which is a preferred mode for producing the catalyst of the present invention, almost 100 % of the predetermined amount of the pre-calcined powder (or the powder further containing the molding aid and/or strength improver) can be loaded.<br>
Then the catalytically active component loaded on the carrier is calcined to obtain the catalyst of the present invention. The calcining temperature which varies depending on the operation conditions such as the inner diameter of the reaction tube is usually 500 to 600 °C, preferably 520 to 560 °C. The calcining time is usually 3 to 30 hours, preferably 4 to 15 hours. The particle size of the catalyst which varies depending on the inner diameter of the reaction tube, the average particle size of the carrier and the<br>
r<br>
catalyst-loading rate is usually 4 to 16 mm, preferably 4 to 10 mm^yrwe-p^WiAy •jj^eParticle size of the catalyst after the calcining is substantially equal to that before the calcining.<br>
Next, a detailed description will be made on the production process of the present invention.<br>
In the production process of the present invention wherein a multitubular reactor of fixed bed type is usually used, the length of the filled catalyst, the inner diameter of the reaction tube and the number of the tubes vary depending on the operation conditions. Therefore, the catalyst-loading rate, the calcining temperature and the particle size of the catalyst are suitably determined depending thereon so as to obtain an optimum yield. For example, when the inner diameter of the reaction tube is 21 to 28 mm, then the catalyst-loading rate is preferably 20 to 50 % by weight, the catalyst particle size is preferably 4 to 8 mm and the calcining temperature is preferably 500 to 580 °C.<br>
The catalyst of the present invention is used preferably for the gas-phase catalytic oxidation of olefin or tertiary alcohol to produce the corresponding unsaturated aldehyde and unsaturated acid, and still preferably for producing acrolein and acrylic acid or methacrolein and methacrylic acid from propylene, isobutylene or t-butanol.<br>
The gas-phase catalytic oxidation reaction in the present invention may<br><br>
be carried out by an ordinary single pass method or the recycle method, the reaction can be carried out under the conditions usually employed for a reaction of this kind except that the catalyst of the present invention is used. In using the catalyst of the present invention charged in the reaction tube, it is preferred to form one layer (one-layer charging). The one-layer charging is preferred particularly when acrolein is produced from propylene. When, for example, at least one compound selected from among propylene, isobutylene and t~butanol is used as the starting material, the process of the present invention is conducted by introducing a mixed gas comprising 1 to 10 % by volume, preferably 4 to 9 % by volume, of the starting material, 3 to 20 % by volume, preferably 4 to 18 % by volume, of molecular oxygen, 0 to 60 % by volume, preferably 4 to 50 % by volume, of water vapor, 20 to 80 % by volume, preferably 30 to 60 % by volume, of an inert gas (such as nitrogen or carbon dioxide etc.) into a reaction tube filled with the catalyst of the present invention at a space velocity (= flow rate of the starting gas / apparent volume of the charged catalyst) of 300 to 5,000 hour"1, preferably 800 to 2,000 hour"1 at a temperature of 250 to 450 °C under a pressure of atmospheric pressure to 10 atm.<br>
Effect of the Invention<br>
The following effects are obtained by conducting the oxidation reaction of olefin or the like in the presence of the catalyst of the present invention charged to form one layer:<br>
(a)	the temperature of the hot spots can be kept low to avoid the<br>
danger of the runaway of the reaction caused by the abnormal temperature rise.<br>
(b)	the excessive oxidation reaction in the hot spots can be<br>
prevented to obtain high yields of the intended unsaturated aldehyde and<br>
unsaturated acid and also high selectivities toward them,<br>
(c)	the catalyst can be prevented from suffering deterioration by<br>
the heat load, and the catalyst can be used stably for a long period of time,<br><br>
(d)	since the intended unsaturated aldehyde and unsaturated acid can be produced under high-load reaction conditions such as a high concentration of the starting material and a high space velocity, the productivity can be remarkably improved.<br>
(e)	the pressure loss in the catalyst layer can be kept low, and (f) since multi-layer charging is unnecessary, the time taken for charging the catalyst in the periodic maintenance of the plant can be remarkably reduced.<br>
Thus, the catalyst and process of the present invention are very useful for the production of unsaturated aldehyde and unsaturated acid.<br>
Examples<br>
The following Examples will further illustrate the present invention. In the Examples, the conversion, selectivity and one-pass yield are defined as follows*<br>
conversion (molar %) = (molar number of reacted starting material) /<br>
(molar number of fed starting material) X100 selectivity (molar %)  = (molar number of formed unsaturated aldehyde or<br>
unsaturated acid) / (molar number of reacted starting material) X100 yield (molar %)  = (molar number of formed unsaturated aldehyde or<br>
unsaturated acid) / (molar number of fed starting material) X100<br>
