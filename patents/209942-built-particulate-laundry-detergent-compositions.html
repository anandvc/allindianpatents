GRANTED<br>

TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to built laundry detergent compositions containing anionic sulphonate or sulphate surfactants and exhibiting increased mildness to the skin.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Heavy duty laundry detergent compositions have for many years contained an anionic sulphonate or sulphate surfactant, for example, linear alkylbenzene sulphonate (LAS) or primary alcohol sulphate (PAS) , as the principal detergent-active ingredient.  These anionic surfactants are frequently used in conjunction with ethoxylated alcohol nonionic surfactants which give improved detergency on hydrophobic soils.  The nonionic surfactants generally have alkyl chain lengths of C12-C18 and degrees of ethoxylation of 1 to 10.<br>
These anionic and anionic/nonionic surfactant systems are robust and highly efficient on a wide range of soils and under a wide range of conditions, for example, temperature and water hardness.  However, they are not noted for mildness to skin.  These materials are designed to interact with fatty materials like body soil and protein residues on soiled laundry, and can therefore interact with the skin to give reactions such as dryness and erythema (redness).  The milder surfactants used  to formulate products intended for prolonged skin contact, for example, shampoos and shower<br>
.<br><br>
gels, would not perform adequately in heavy duty laundry detergent compositions because of insufficient interaction with fatty materials occurring as soil.<br>
It has now been surprisingly discovered that the mildness to skin of a laundry detergent composition containing an anionic sulphonate or sulphate detergent and a conventional detergent ethoxylated nonionic surfactant can be significantly improved, without detriment to detergency performance, by the incorporation of a low level of a much more highly ethoxylated nonionic surfactant.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>

WO 00 08129A (Unilever) discloses mild particulate laundry-detergent compositions based on high-foaming anionic surfactant (for example linear alkylbenzene sulphonate) plus one or more milder cosurfactants, for example, amine oxide or cocoamidopropyl betaine.<br>
DEFINITION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a built particulate laundry detergent composition comprising<br>
(i)   from. 5 to 25 wt%. of. an anionic sulphonate or sulphate surfactant,<br>
(ii)  from 1 to 10 wt% of an ethoxylated alcohol nonionic<br>
surfactant having an alkyl chain length of from C8 to<br>
C18 and an average degree of ethoxylation of from 3 to 10,<br><br><br>
(iii) from 1 to 5 wt% of s. highly ethoxylated alcohol nonionic surfactant having an average degree of ethoxylation of from 15 to 40,<br>
(iv)  from 10 to 80 wt% of detergency builder and<br>
(v)   optionally other detergent ingredients to 10 0 wt%.<br>
The present invention further provides the use of an ethoxylated alcohol nonionic surfactant having an average degree of ethoxylation of from 15 to 40, in an amount of from 1 to 5 wt%, to increase the mildness to skin of a built particulate laundry detergent composition containing an anionic sulphonate or sulphate detergent.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Detergent compositions of the invention contain a conventional anionic sulphonate or sulphate surfactant and a conventional nonionic surfactant, and also contain as an essential ingredient a low level of a highly ethoxylated nonionic surfactant, (iii). which is- an -aliphatic" alcohol having an average degree cf ethoxylation of from 15 to 40.<br>
The invention is based on the observation that use of a highly ethoxylated nonionic surfactant at low levels to supplement or replace part of a conventional anionic/nonionic surfactant system results in a measurable increase in mildness to skin.<br><br><br>
It is well known and intuitively obvious that the mildness to skin of a formulation can be increased simply by reducing the amount of surfactant.  However, cleaning efficiency is then reduced.  Surprisingly, it has now been found that addition of low levels of highly ethoxylated nonionic surfactant will increase mildness even when the total surfactant level is kept constant, i.e. the high ethoxylate replaces a small proportion of the other surfactants.   For example, in a formulation containing 15 wt% surfactant (LAS and ethoxylated nonionic) replacement of as little as 5 wt% of that surfactant is beneficial with respect to mildness, and there is no loss of cleaning efficiency.  It is surprising that such a small addition has a significant effect.  The effect on mildness is significantly greater than that of an equal amount of alkyl ether sulphate or cocoamidopropyl betaine, both of which are known from the prior art as supplements to increase mildness.<br>
According to an especially preferred embodiment of the invention, the skin-mild detergent compositions of the invention are free of enzymes, since enzymes can also cause skin irritation to sensitive individuals.  However, enzymatic compositions are also within the scope of the invention.<br>
The Anionic Sulphonate or Sulphate Surfactant (i)<br>
Anionic sulphonate and sulphate surfactants are well-known to those skilled in the art.  Many suitable detergent-active compounds are available and are fully described in the<br><br><br>
literature, for example, in "Surface-Active Agents and Detergents", Volumes I and II, by Schwartz, Perry and Berch.<br>
Examples include alkylbenzene sulphonates, primary and<br>
secondary alkylsulphates, particularly C8-C15 primary alkyl<br>
sulphates;  alkyl ether sulphates;  olefin sulphonates; alkyl xylene sulphonates,-  dialkyl<br>
sulphosuccinates,  and fatty acid ester sulphonates. Sodium salts are generally preferred.<br>
Preferably the anionic surfactant is linear alkylbenzene sulphonate or primary alcohol sulphate.  More preferably the anionic surfactant is linear alkylbenzene sulphonate.<br>
The Nonionic Surfactant (ii)<br>
Conventional nonionic detergent surfactants are ethoxylated alcohols of the formula<br>
Rl - (- 0 - CH2 - CH2)TO " OH<br>
wherein R1 is a C8-C20 hydrocarbyl chain, and the average<br>
degree of ethoxylation m  is generally from 1 to 10, preferably from 3 to 8.  The alkyl chain length is<br>
preferably in the C12  to C3.5 range.<br>
The Highly Ethoxylated Nonionic Surfactant (iii)<br>
The highly ethoxylated nonionic surfactant is an ethoxylated aliphatic alcohol of the formula<br><br><br>
R2 - (- 0 - CH2 - CH2)n " OH<br>
wherein R2 is a hydrocarbyl chain and the average degree of<br>
ethoxylation n  is from 15 to 40, preferably from 16 to 35, more preferably from 18 to 32, most preferably from 2 0 to 30.  The average degree of ethoxylation may even be from 22 to 30.<br>
The alkyl chain length may range, for example, from C12 to<br>
C2o.  ln commercial materials containing a spread of chain<br>
lengths, these figures represent an average.<br>
The alcohol may be derived from natural or synthetic<br>
feedstock.<br>
Desirably, the highly ethoxylated alcohol nonionic surfactant is a solid at ambient temperature, so that it may conveniently be incorporated in the compositions of the invention in the form of separately admixed granules. Because these materials are solid, no carrier material is required in the. granules; especially preferred-granules-are substantially 100 wt% pure and have a particle size within the range of from 100 to 2000 micrometres.<br>
Where the alkyl chain is linear or only lightly branched, the chain length is preferably at least C16, more preferably from C16 to C18.  An example of a highly preferred material of this type is Lutensol (Trade Mark) AT25 ex BASF, which<br><br><br>
has an aikyl chain length of C16-C18 and an average degree of ethoxylation of 25.<br>
Where the alkyl chain is more highly branched, for example, contains at least three methyl groups, a shorter chain length may be suitable.  Another highly preferred material for use in the present invention is Lutensol (Trade Mark)<br>
TO2 0 ex HAS?, which has a highly branched C12 (average)<br>
alkyl chain containing on average from 3 to 4 methyl groups (including a terminal methyl group), and an  average degree of ethoxylation of 20.<br>
Both of these materials are waxy solids at ambient temperature and are available in pure granular form suitable for postdosing to detergent powder compositions.<br>
The Detergency Builder<br>
The compositions of the invention also contain from 10 to 80%, preferably from 15 to 70% by weight, of detergency builder.  Preferably, the quantity of builder is in the range of from 15 to 5T)% by weight.<br>
Preferably the builder is selected from zeolite, sodium tripolyphcsphate, sodium carbonate, sodium citrate, layered silicate, and combinations of these.<br>
The zeolite used as a builder may be the commercially available zeolite A (zeolite 4A) now widely used in laundry detergent powders. Alternatively, the zeolite may be maximum<br><br><br>
aluminium zeolite P (zeolite MAP) as described and claimed in EP 384 070B (Unilever), and commercially available as Doucil (Trade Mark) A24 from Ine.os Silicas Ltd, UK.<br>
Zeolite MAP is defined as an alkali metal aluminosilicate of zeolite P type having a silicon to aluminium ratio not exceeding 1.33, preferably within the range of from 0.90 to 1.33, preferably within the range of from 0.90 to 1.20. Especially preferred is zeolite MAP having a silicon to aluminium ratio not exceeding 1.07, more preferably about 1.00.  The particle size of the zeolite is not critical. Zeolite A or zeolite MAP of any suitable particle size may be used.<br>
Also preferred according to the present invention are phosphate builders, especially sodium tripolyphosphate. This may be used in combination with sodium orthophosphate, and/or sodium pyrophosphate.<br>
Other inorganic builders that may be present additionally or alternatively include sodium carbonate, layered silicate, amorphous aluminosilicates.<br>
Organic builders that may be present include polycarboxylate polymers such as polyacrylates and acrylic/maleic copolymers; polyaspartates; monomeric polycarboxylates such as citrates, gluconates, oxydisuccinates, glycerol mona-di-and trisuccinates, carboxymethyloxysuccinates, carboxy-methyloxymalonates, dipicolinates,<br>
hydroxyethyliminodiacetates, alkyl- and alkenylmalonates and succinates; and sulphonated fatty acid salts.<br><br><br>
Organic builders may be used  in minor  amounts  as   supplements to inorganic builders  such as phosphates  and zeolites. Especially preferred  supplementary organic builders  are citrates,   suitably used in amounts of  from 5  to 3 0 wt   %, preferably  from 10   to  25 vt   %;   and acrylic polymers,   more especially acrylic/maleic  copolymers,   suitably used in amounts  of  from 0.5  to 15 wt  %,   preferably from 1  to  10  wt%.<br>
Builders,   both inorganic and organic,   are preferably present in alkali metal  salt,   especially sodium salt,   form.<br>
Other Detergent  Ingredients<br>
As well  as  the surfactants and builders  discussed above,   the compositions  may optionally contain bleaching components  and other active  ingredients to enhance performance and properties.<br>
These optional  ingredients may include,   but  are not  limited to,   any one or more of the following:   soap,   peroxyacid and persalt bleaches,   bleach activators,   sequestrants,   cellulose ethers  and,esters,   other antiredeposition agents,   sodiunv sulphate,   sodium silicate,   sodium chloride,   calcium chloride,   sodium bicarbonate,   other.inorganic salts, proteases,   lipases,   cellulases,   amylases,   other detergent enzymes,   fluorescers,   photobleaches,   polyvinyl pyrrolidone, other dye transfer inhibiting polymers,   foam controllers, foam boosters,   acrylic and acrylic/maleic polymers,   citric acid,   soil release polymers,   fabric conditioning compounds, coloured speckles,   and psrfume.<br><br><br>
Detergent compositions according to the invention may suitably contain a bleach system.

Suitable peroxy bleach compounds include organic peroxides such as urea peroxide, and inorganic persalts such as the alkali metal perborates, percarbonates, perphosphates, persilicates and persulphates.  Preferred inorganic persalts are sodium perborate monohydrate and tetrahydrate, and sodium percarbonate.  Especially preferred is sodium percarbonate having a protective coating against destabilisation by moisture.  Sodium percarbonate having a protective coating comprising sodium metaborate and sodium silicate is disclosed in GB 2 123 044B (Kao).<br>
The peroxy bleach compound is suitably present in an amount of from 5 to 35 wt%, preferably from 10 to 25 wt%.<br>
The peroxy bleach compound may be used in conjunction with a bleach activator (bleach precursor) to improve bleaching action at low wash temperatures.  The bleach precursor is suitably present in an amount of from 1 to 8 wt%, preferably from 2 to 5 wt%.<br>
Preferred bleach precursors are peroxycarboxylic acid precursors, more especially peracetic acid precursors and peroxybenzoic acid precursors; and peroxycarbonic acid precursors.  An especially preferred bleach precursor suitable for use in the present invention is N.N.N'.N'-tetracetyl ethylenediamine (TAED).  Also of interest are<br><br><br>

In particulate detergent compositions, detergency enzymes are commonly employed in granular form in amounts of from abo~t 0.1 to about 3,0 wt%.  However, any suitable physical form of enzyme may be used in any effective amount.<br>
Antiredeposition agents, for example cellulose esters and ethers, for example sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, may al:;.. be present.<br>
The compositions may also contain soil release polymers, frr example sulphonated and unsulphonated PET/POET polymers, both end-capped and non-end-capped, and polyethylene glycol/polyvinyl alcohol graft copolymers such as Sokolan (Trade Mark) HP22.  Especially preferred soil release polymers are the sulphonated nor.-end-capped polyesters described and claimed in WO 95 32997A (Rhodia Chimie) .<br><br><br>
