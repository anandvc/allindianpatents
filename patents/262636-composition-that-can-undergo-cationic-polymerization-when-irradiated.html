COMPOSITION THAT CAN UNDERGO CATIONIC AND/OR RADICAL POLTMERIZATION AND/OR CROSSLINKING WHEN IRRADIATED<br>
The invention relates to a composition that can undergo cationic and/or radical polymerization and/or crosslinking when irradiated. The invention more particularly relates to a polymerizable and/or crosslinkable composition comprising at least one base compound, at least one photoinitiator and at least one compound comprising at least one isocyanate function, and to its use as a coating.<br>
The field of the invention is that of photopolymer systems that can be crosslinked and/or polymerized when irradiated, in particular with UV radiation or with an electron beam, which can be used especially for forming coatings, such as inks, varnishes or paints.<br>
These compositions are of the type comprising an organic matrix whose constituents bear polymerization/crosslinking reactive functions, and also a photoprimer or photoinitiator which, after absorption of energy, for example UV energy, releases a strong acid: H* (cationic route) or a free radical (radical route), Cationic photoinitiators thus allow the initiation and propagation of cationic chain polymerizations, while radical photoinitiators (PI) allow the triggering of chain polymerizations via formation of free radicals.<br>
In the field of coatings of varnish type, in particular in the field of varnishes on metal packagings such as drink cans, compounds that can improve the flexibility of the coatings without reducing the reactivity of the systems or the chemical and mechanical strength (especially the scratch resistance) of the coating, are sought.<br><br>
Compositions that can undergo cationic polymeriza¬tion Zeros si inking under UV irradiation are known and are used as coatings such as varnishes. Such compositions have, for example, as organic matrix a compound comprising aliphatic epoxide functions and a cationic photoinitiator. A coat of varnish based on such a composition, deposited on an aluminum support, for example, shows good chemical and mechanical strength {scratch resistance) , but insufficient flexibility (suppleness).<br>
Thus, the present invention proposes a composition that does not have  these drawbacks.<br>
To this end, the invention proposes, according to a first subject, a composition that can undergo cationic and/or radical polymerization and/or crosslinking when irradiated, preferably with actinic radiation and/or with an electron beam, comprising:<br>
-	A) at least one base compound comprising, per molecule, at least one polymerization/crosslinking group, the groups being chosen from the following list: epoxy, oxetane, alkenyl, dioxolane, episulfide, thioxolane, acrylate or methacrylate, hydroxyl ;<br>
-	B)   at   least   one   cationic   and/or   radical photoinitiator;<br>
-	C) optionally, at least one compound comprising an alcohol or thiol or  carboxylic acid function;<br>
-	D) at least one compound comprising at least one isocyanate function.<br>
In the present invention, cationic irradiation is preferred.<br>
Advantageously,  the base compound comprises at least<br><br>
two polymerization/crosslinking groups, these groups preferably being selected frorn the group of the following combinations of groups; epoxy-epoxy, oxetane-oxetane, dioxolane-dioxolane.<br>
The epoxy, oxetane and dioxolane groups of the invention are preferably aliphatic groups. The epoxy groups are even more preferentially cycloaliphatic.<br>
The base compounds containing two epoxy, oxetane or dioxolane groups are hydrocarbon-based compounds that may comprise ester, amide, carbamate, carbonate, carbonyl, etc. functionalities.<br>
Advantageously, the base compound containing epoxy groups is chosen from the following compounds:<br><br><br>
According to one particular embodiment of the invention, the base compound is a. cross linkable and/or polymerizable silicone oligomer and/or polymer that is liquid at room temperature or heat-fusible at a temperature below 100°C, the silicone oligomer and/or polymer comprising:<br>
at least one unit having the following formula:<br>
Z(R°)3Si03-a/2<br>
in which:<br>
-	a ^ 0, 1 or 2,<br>
-	R°, which may be identical or different, represents an alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, vinyl, hydrogeno, hydroxyl or alkoxy radical, preferably a Ci-Cg lower alkyl,<br>
-	Z is an organic substituent comprising at least one epoxy and/or alkenyl ether and/or oxetane and/or dioxolane and/or carbonate reactive function, and<br>
at least two silicon atoms.<br>
The reactive functions z of the silicone polymer or oligomer may be very varied. However, particularly advantageous coatings are obtained when the silicone oligomer or polymer comprises at least one unit (FS) in which Z represents an organic substituent Zl comprising at least one epoxy and/or dioxolane reactive function, and preferably at least one epoxy reactive function.<br>
According to two advantageous alternatives of the present invention, the silicone oligomer or polymer containing at least one epoxy and/or dioxolane reactive function Zl, and preferably at least one epoxy reactive function Zl, may:<br>
(i)  either solely comprise this or these type(s)<br>
of reactive function(s) Zl, {ii) or comprise other reactive functions Z such as alkenyl ether,  oxetane and/or carbonate<br><br>
reactive functions Z2.<br>
In the case of the first alternative (i), the composition may also comprise other silicone oligomers and/or polymers other than the oligomer/polymer described above, comprising other reactive functions Z2 such as alkenyl ether, oxetane and/or carboiiate functions and optionally reactive functions zl.<br>

Preferred examples of "alkenyl" groups are vinyl, allyl and  homoallyl  groups;   vinyl  being  particularly<br>
preferred.<br>
When the base compound comprises alkenyl groups, they may be "activated" alkenyl groups such as alkenyl ether or styrene, which will polymerize in the presence of the photoinitiator, especially a cationic photoinitiator. They may also be "non-activated" alkenyl groups such as allylic groups. These "non-activated" alkenyl groups may polymerize in the presence of a radical photoinitiator and of a compound comprising thiol functions. An example of such a reaction    that   may   be   mentioned    is    the<br><br>
photopolymerization of thiol-enes. Such a reaction is described in the publication "Photopolymerization of thiol-enes: some recent advances" (Rad. Tech. 2001, October 8-10, 2001, conference proceedings, pp. 219--224) .<br>

•	compound D: between 1% and 70% (limits inclusive), preferably between 1.5% and 50% (limits inclusive) and even more preferentially between 2% and 30%<br>
(limits inclusive).<br>
In the case of the compositions of the invention that can undergo radical polymerization/crosslinking when irradiated, the proportion (by weight relative to the weight of the composition) of compounds A, B, C and D in the composition of the invention is advantageously as follows:<br>
•	compound A: greater than or equal to 30%, preferably greater than or equal to 50% and even more preferentially greater than or equal to 70%,<br>
•	compound B: between 0.01% and 10% (limits inclusive) and preferably between 0.1% and 5% (limits inclusive),<br>
•	compound C; less than or equal to 80%, preferably less  than  or  equal  to  50%  and  even  more<br><br>
preferentially less than or equal to 20%, • compound D: between 1% and 70% (limits inclusive}, preferably between 1.5% and 50% llimits inclusive) and even more preferentially between 2% and 30% (limits inclusive).<br>
In a second subject, the invention also relates to a process for coating a support, characterized in that the composition described above is applied to a support.<br>
This may be any known type of support. Examples of supports that may be mentioned include supports made of wood, plastic, metal such as aluminum or steel, etc. The support is advantageously metallic.<br>
Advantageously, the process comprises the following steps:<br>
coating  the  support  using  the  composition  as described above to form at least one coating layer (at least partial) on the support, - crosslinking the coating layer by irradiation.<br>
The composition of the invention may be applied to the support, for example, by any suitable coating or transfer means (for example a doctor blade, a coating roll, photogravure, dynamic screen printing, a brush, spraying: pneumatic or electrostatic gun, etc.).<br>
The crosslinking of the coating applied to the support to be coated may be activated, for example by heating the impregnated or even coated support to a temperature of between 30 and 250°C and preferably between 50 and 250°C, obviously taking into account the maximum heat resistance of the support. The duration of heating of the support is generally between 3 0 seconds and one hour. When the duration of heating of the support is<br><br>
short, for example between 30 seconds and a few minutes, the maximiam temperature reached by the support is advantageously between 30 and 150°C and preferably between 50 and 150°C.<br>
The heat-activation means are of the type that are known and suitable for this purpose, for example an oven or IR radiation.<br>
During the implementation of a standard process of cationic irradiation, for example in the presence of a monomer and a photoinitiator, certain areas of the coating are occasionally not irradiated, and thus not polymerized.<br>
Now, the use of compound D comprising an isocyanate function in the invention allows the polymerization of the areas of th^ coating that have not been irradiated. This represents a considerable advantage in terms of the properties of the coating.<br>
The composition of the invention may also be an adhesive composition used for the processing of laminated materials (for instance in the case of packaging materials). The composition is then applied to a support, irradiated with UV in order to obtain an adhesive layer that is dry to the touch and thereby transportable in the form of a roll, for example. The support thus coated may then be subsequently reprocessed by lamination to form a multilayer system, and then by any other process for obtaining an object of three-dimensional fojrm of the desired form. The stiffness of the final material is then obtained by heat activation of the adhesive as described above. The two steps of irradiation and heat activation, which may be performed separately, afford flexibility to the processes for preparing coated supports.<br><br>
The deposition rate of the composition on the support varies as a function of the field of application of the composition. In the field of coatings in general, the deposition rate is usually less than or equal to 80 g/m^, In the field of varnishes for metallic packaging boxes such as drink cans, the deposition rate is generally between 2 and 30 g/m^.<br>
In a third subject, the present invention also relates to the coated support (or compositel that may be obtained according to the process described above.<br>
This composite is characterized in that it comprises:<br>
•	a support,<br>
•	at least one coating layer  (at least partial) obtained from the composition as defined above.<br>
The coating layer [s) of this composite has (have) good properties in terms of chemical resistance and mechanical strength (especially scratch resistance), but also in terms of suppleness and flexibility.<br>

Tests<br>
MEK    test:    One drop of methyl ethyl ketone (MEK)  is<br>
placed on the film of varnish. A watch glass is placed<br>
on top and the MEK is left to act for 3 minutes. Next,<br>
the product is removed by dabbing up gently with a soft<br>
cloth,  and the surface state of the film is then<br>
exaitiined.  The  result  is scored     from     0  to  5,  0<br>
corresponding to no effect,  and 5 corresponding to<br>
complete destruction of the film;<br>
0: the film is not attacked, the reagent leaves no<br>
trace;<br>
1: a mark corresponding to the contour of the drop is<br>
observed. The interior is identical to the rest of the<br>
film in terms of appearance and feel;<br>
2:  loss of gloss is observed, or the film is tacky<br>
(considerably softened), or coloration is observed;<br>
3: the film cumulates two or three of the defects of<br>
point 3;<br>
4: the film is folded or sticky and does not really<br>
have any cohesion. A wet edge at the periphery of the<br>
drop may also be observed;<br>
5:  the film has been completely destroyed,  and the<br>
support is bare.<br>
Flexibility    of    the    layers     ('■T-bend") :  a strip 5 to<br><br>
10 mm wide of the varnished support is cut out and one end of the strip is folded over, with the varnished face always to the exterior. By continuing to fold the same end in the same manner, the fold is less and less clean, and at a certain point the coating bears no mark due to the fold (cracking, crazing, etc. ) . The result on the test is the number of turns made by the end to arrive at this point (2.5 - 2 turns plus half a turn -5 consecutive folds).<br>
Hardness: mention is made herein of the pencil hardness, This is measured using a standard set of pencils ranging from hardness 7B to 7H.<br><br>
This is a mixture of salts of arylsulfonium hexafluoroantimonate type.<br><br>
Benzyl alcohol is used as compound C.<br>
Hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDD oligomers sold by Rhodia under the brand name Tolonate® are used as compound D. The main characteristics of these compounds are given hereinbelow:<br><br>
A clear, colorless solution is obtained.<br>
Application to an aluminum plate {of Pechiney type £or cans) using a No. 2 Meyer type threaded coating bar leads to a uniform film without dewetting. After treating with UV (speed of 10 m/min under two mercury lamps at 190 W/cm) , a film that is dry to the touch with a thickness of about 5 vrni is obtained.<br><br>
Exangle 1<br>
The following mixture of constituents is prepared:<br><br>
A clear, colorless solution is obtained.<br>
Application to an aluminuin plate (of Pechiney type for cans) us ing a No. 2 Meyer type threaded coating bar leads to a uniform film without dewetting. After treating with UV (speed of 10 m/min under two mercury lamps at 190 W/cm) , a film that is dry to the touch with a thickness of about 5 um is obtained.<br>
The same formulation is applied in the same manner to another bare support 4 hours and 24 hours after its preparation. After treating with UV (speed of 10 m/min under two mercury lamps at 190 W/cm) , a film that is dry to the touch with a thickness of about 5 um is again obtained.<br>
After UV irradiation, the crosslinking can also be terminated by curing in an oven at 200°C for 1 min. The films obtained then have the following properties:<br><br><br>
(Test    with    MEK:     0    =    no    degradation,  5 ~    complete destruction of the film)<br>
A marked improvement in the suppleness of the coating, without deterioration of the other properties, is observed.<br><br><br><br>
