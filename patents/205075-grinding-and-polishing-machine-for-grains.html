COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
{See Section i©)<br><br>
BRANDING AND POLISHING MACHINE BSPB<br>
BUHLER AG of CH-9.248 UZWIL, SWITZERLAND,  SWISS  Company<br>
The  following  spec1fleation  particularly  describes<br>
the nature of the invention  and  the manner in which it is  to be <br>
performed : -<br><br><br>
The invention is about a grinding and/or polishing machine (read vertical abrasive whitener) for grains like rice or other tvpes of grains, with grinding and/or polishing rotor surrounded by a screen which is made up of several radially adjustable screen segments, each of which are arranged at one end, around a dowel screw in horizontally swingable manner.<br>
Conventional grinding or polishing machines, especially grinding machines, possess an arrangement of screen segments, which are mounted on one peripheral end on an articulated axle, where as the other peripheral end is swing able around this axle in such a manner that it projects into the space tilled with the grains to be screened to a smaller or larger extent. The purpose behind it is to give an increased resistance for the grains picked up by the rotor against the free end of the screen segment bv shifting radiallv towards inside, so that there is a friction between the rotor and the grains or between the grains themselves. If this kind of resistance is not provided, that is, if the screen basket is completely concentric and circular cylindrical, the grains would be driven bv the rotor to an empty circumferential movement around the inner surface of the screen and there would be no abrasion of the husk residues or other such things.<br>
When one talks about "grains" in—the—Patent"application in hand, it can be a matter of many different types of grains. Commonly, this tvpe of treatment is used for rice, but occasionally also for other types of grain. Furthermore, the use of these machines is recommended also for coffee beans.<br>
In the conventional construction described above, axially running flanges are provided at the ends of the screen segments, which are supposed to provide a covering when the free end of the screen segment is adjusted in radial direction, because, otherwise a gap will be created between the free end of the screen segment and the end of the neighbouring screen segment joined to it, through which the grains can pass. But a complete cover is not possible, due to sheer<br>
2<br><br>
geometric reasons, because, when a screen segment swings horizontally against the other, obviouslv the angle of the flange also changes in relation to the radial plane running through the dowel screw of the neighbouring screen segment. In case of small sized grains and/or larger setting ranges, this can lead to a gap between screen segments that are right next to each other, through which the grains can pass. This disadvantage makes it imperative in conventional constructions, to limit the setting range, that is, to keep it smaller, since, it would be effective under the circumstances.<br>
Another disadvantage of the conventional construction is in the fact that each individual screen segment, often three of them, have to be set separately, which is time consuming and causes idle time of the machine, since the setting can be carried out only after stopping the machine completely, that's only when the operator obtains an access to the screen which is housed in a casing.<br>
The basis of the invention is now the task to improve the conventional construction by evading, ihe described disadvantages. Invention wise, this is achieved by arranging each screen segment swing ably arounci a dowel screw on its other end also, and the arrangement of neighbouring screen segments is provided on a common lever which bridges the axial gap between each of the neighbouring screen segments. Thus, as opposed to the conventional constructions, both periferal ends of each screen segment are freely mobile within certain limits, at the same time, due to the placing of the lever, the movement almost corresponds to a parallel displacement, so that, irrespective of how big the setting range for the screen segments is - the distance of one screen segment from the neighbouring is essentially always of equal size and thus gaps, through which the grain can pass, are avoided.<br>
Further, in addition to this, there is a surprising and very important effect, that the movement of even one screen segment, through the lever, automaticallv guides all the other screen segments also in the corresponding position.<br><br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, it is recommended that each lever is laid in a swing able manner around a dowel screw that is fixed in one position. This constructive measure brings the advantage of a very secure kinematics with a dependable function. The distance of this screen from the rotor (grinding rotor) is adjustable even during operation of the machine.<br>
The preferred embodiment of the invention proves to be especiallv advantageous, in that, each connecting rod is developed as a lever with two arms and each lever arm is equipped with a dowel screw for the arrangement of a screen segment. Through this, a precise guide for the positioning of the screen segments is obtained, which ensures a dependable operation of the machine over long operation periods.<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment of the invention, it is so designed, that the two-armed lever which makes up the connecting rod is symmetrically designed. Through this, same setting range or same settings are achieved for all screen segments.<br>
According to the preferred embodiment of the invention, if even one screen segment is provided with a setting device for radial positioning against the grinding and/or polishing rotor, then all screen segments will be positioned as an advantage of the construction according to the invention. Especially simple, but very effective, is the adjustment, when, according to the further preferred design, it is made up of a setting lever with a fixed position, which is connected to a lever or to a lever arm of the lever through a tappet, whereby, preferably, the setting lever or the lever that belongs to it show a locking facility.<br>
Accordingly there is provided Grinding and/or polishing machines for grains like rice or other grains with a grinding and/or polishing rotor
4<br><br>
The invention will now be clear from the following description and illustration in figures 1 to 3 in the accompanying drawings.<br>
Fig. 1 a longitudinal section through the grinding machine according to the invention, for which the<br>
Fig. 2 is a cross section according to the Line II - II of Fig. 1 and<br>
Fig. 3 a magnified section according to the Line Ill-Ill of Fig, 2.<br>
Referring to figures 1 to 3, Grinding and/or polishing machines for grains like rice or other grains with a grinding and/or polishing rotor
A grinding machine represented schematically in Fig. 1 in longitudinal section has a machine housing 1, on whose upper side an. inlet spout 2 is fixed for the grains to be processed where as the material is carried awav after processing from the underside through a discharge hopper 3. The inlet spout 2 is connected to a vibrofeeder 4, from which the grains to be processed is brought into into the annular gap type processing chamber 5. Inside this processing chamber 5, an emerv ring 6 is located, which is fixed on a shaft 7 and is driven bv a belt pullev 8 and a motor 9.<br>
Screen 10 forms the border of the radial outerside of the processing chamber 5, which, according to the fig. 2 is made up of three screen segments 10' that are mobile in relation to each other. At it's ends, the screen segments 10' have the flange 11 which streches out over the axial length of the processing chamber 5, and thus is called axial flange. As one can see from Fig. 1, a ring shaped flange 12 streching out radially towards the outside is provided on the screen 10 each on<br>
&gt;<br><br>
the upper and lowef ends, which is fixed on a toroid shaped base plate 13 (on the under side) and on a toroid body 14 on the upper side in a manner that will be described later.<br>
It is understood thaT the perforations of screen 10 are usually small enough to hold back the grains to be processed in processing chamber 5, so that only the scrape off can pass through to outside. From Fig. 2 it is father seen that the radial flange 12 is put together with three parts, which correspond each to the screen segments 10' and are connected with them.<br>
The conventional design was made in such a way that on one peripheral end of each of the screen segments 10" or on the radial flange 12 that belonged to it, a dowel scrcwB was fixed firmlv to the plate 13 lving under it, where as the other peripheral end of the screen segment was freely mobile and bordered on that side of the neighbouring screen segment 10', which was again linked to a firmly fixed shaft. Then if the free ends of the screen segments 10' were moved radialv inwards or outwards, due to the swaying movement, gaps would form between the neighbouring screen segments 10', through which the grains could pass outside. Moreover, t?ach screen segment had to be set separately.<br>
Invention wise, this disadvantage is avoided by the fact that the screen segments 10' are connected with each other, but through lever 16, which are each connected in a mobile manner with the screen segment 10' or it's radial flange 12 through dowel screw 15. In this way only a parallel displacement happens between the axial flanges 11 neighbouring each other, that is, the gap 21 that is between them changes it self only minimally due to the movement of the screen segments 10' in radial direction towards processing chamber 5.<br>
A further advantage is seen through the fact that the leverlb can transmit the movement of a screen segment 10' or the movement of it's radial flange 12 directly to the other screen segments. Hence, it is sufficient when a single setting lever 17 is operational from the outside of the casing 1. The setting lever 17 sits<br>
6<br><br>
on a pivot point 18 which has a fixed place and through it's short end on the other side, it drives an articulated head 19 which defines the axial position of the radial flange 12 and the screen segment 10' that belongs to it. At the same time, it would be suitable to assign a corresponding (not shown in the drawing) locking device to the lever 17, for example to let it engage itself in a link block that is mobile along a setting screw rod, whereby the screw rod causes the locking through it's self-locking effect.<br>
By itself, it would be possible to let the leverl6 work for securing the screen 10 with regard to the rotor 6, as long as for this purpose a certain arrangement is provided for the lever, which gives it a defined oscillating movement. Such an oscillating axis defining arrangement could be realised by different methods, for example bv arranging a striking surface on the lever approximately in the centre oi the ends (or even off-centre) of the lever and/or on the housing suface next to it. A secure kinematic and a better function takes place when each lever, in the way it is seen especially in Fig. 3, is itself pivoted around a connecting rod 20. This connecting rod 20 is provided effectively in the center of each lever 16, so that each lever 16 with its dowel screw 15 virtually builds a two armed lever.<br><br><br><br>
