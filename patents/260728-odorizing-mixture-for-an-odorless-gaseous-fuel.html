				<td>MELANGE ODORISANT POUR COMBUSTIB LEGAZEUK INODORE <br>
The present invention concerns the field of oc$orizers for gaseous fuels, especially odorless ones, arid more especially relates to odorizing compositions that are free of sulfur compounds, for detecting gas leaks and preventing- risks of explosion resulting therefrofi.<br>
The mains gases and coke oven gases that were Obtained via thermal processes were used for a long time: in the past as gaseous fuels, both for public lightingfand for domestic needs. These gases contained Strongly odoriferous components. They consequently had a strong intrinsic odor, enabling a gas leak to be) easily detected.<br>
In contrast, the gaseous fuels used nowadays, whether natural gas, propane, butane, liquefied petroleum gas (or LPG) , or even oxygen (for example for weldifig) , are essentially odorless, either on account of their origin or on account of the purification treatment they have received.<br>
Thus, if leaks are not perceived in time, exjjplosable mixtures of gaseous fuels and air rapidly form^ with a consequential high risk potential.<br>
It is for these safety reasons that the natural gas circulating in gas pipelines is odorized by injection (in specialized plants) of suitable additives known as odorizers.<br>
Natural gas is generally conveyed in odorless jform to consumer countries from the production sites, after a suitable purification treatment, either via: a gas pipeline, or (in liquid form) in specialized ships (methane jankers). In France, for example, natural gas is thus 'received at a limited number of injection plants, wfhere the odorizer is injected, such jth&amp;t the<br>
natural gas both which circulates in the Freifch gas pipeline network and which is stored in underground reservoirs is odorized, thus allowing easy detection in the event of a leak, irrespective of the portion; of the network in .which this leak occurs.<br>
In other countries, natural gas may be distributed throughout the territory via a network of gas pijpelines in which it circulates without an odorizer, the gas then being odorized on entering the towns wher^ it is consumed, hence the need for an even larger number of injection plants.<br>
Storage tanks are usually maintained under an atmosphere of nitrogen or of natural gas in order to limit, at this stage, the risks of explosion.<br>
It is known practice to use alkyl sulfides and/or mercaptans as odorizers, alone or as a mixture. Examples that may be mentioned include diethyl Sulfide, dimethyl sulfide, methyl ethyl $ulfide, tetrahydrothiophene, tert-butyl mercaptan and i$opropyl mercaptan, which are widely used for their excellent properties, being especially capable of triggering a sensation of alarm among people in the event of an accidental leak of the natural gas thus odorized, and of initiating the necessary safety operations5 within the briefest of delays.<br>
However, during the combustion of natural gaqf, these products generate an amount of sulfur dioxide which, small as it may be, becomes non-negligible Fwhen an overall account is taken at the scale of a country or a region, especially one with a high lejvel of industrialization or of urbanization. Thus, for example, the combustion of a natural gas odorized with tetrahydrothiophene (THT) at a concentration of 10 mg/Nm3 (or number of m3 of gas, measured under standard temperature and pressure conditions) gfenerates<br><br>
7.3 mg/Nm3 of sulfur dioxide.<br>
In the general context of better assimilation of environmental constraints, it is thus necessary to reduce the amounts of S02 discharged into the atmosphere via the o#orizers present in natural gas, during the combustion thereof.<br>
Many odorizing mixtures free of sulfur compounds have been proposed.<br>
Examples that may be mentioned include PL 72057, which describes odorizing mixtures based on dicyclo-pentadiene, JP-41-73895, which describes mixtures of specific ethers and esters, WO 02/42396, which describes mixtures based on norbornene or derivatives thereof, and JP-80-060 167, which describes ifaixtures based on 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene and a 2-alkoxy-3-alkylpyrazine.<br>
Many docuBients describing odorizing mixtures based on alkyl acrylates are also known:<br>
JP-49-131, 201 describes a gaseous fuel odorizfr based on an acrylate CH2=CHC02-R1 where Rl is a saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon-based chain containing 3 carbon atoms ahd/or based on an ether R2-0-R3 where %2 is an unsaturat#d hydrocarbon-based chain containing; 2 or 3 carbon attorns and R3 is a saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon-based chain containing 2 or 3 carbon atoms.<br>
DE 198 37 066 describes a process for odorizing natural gas by adding a mixture comprising an alkyl acriylate, a nitrogenous compound of pyrazine type, and $n antioxidant. However, this mixture has the drawback of not having a characteristic odor of gas and is thus liable to lead to confusion in the event of a gas leak. The risk is, quite obviously, that of not detecting this leak, and thus of explosion, if the concentration of gas in the air reaches its lower explosiveness limit.<br>
Documents are also known that combine sulfur compound{s} and non-sulfur compound(s), such as JP-55-137 190, which describes an odorizing mixture combining ethyl acrylate with a specific sulfur compound, namely tert-butyl mercaptan (or TBM) . However, the major drawback of this mixture is that, on account of the chemical reactivity of TBM with ethyl acrylate, the two components of the odorizing mixture must be stored, at the various injection plants, in separate tanks and also require separate pumps and injection heeds for introduction into the gas pipeline. With regard to the complex logistics for odorizing natural gas presented hereinabove, this results in a considerable increase in costs for the injection plants, arising from the necessary multiplication of the storage tanks, pumps and injection heads; WO 2004/024 852 describes an odorizer constituted of four components, including an alkyl acrylate, an alkyl sulfide and a stabilizing antioxidant such as tert-butylhydroxyf:oluene, hydroquinone, etc.; WO 2005/103 210 describes an odorizing mixture for odorless gaseous ; fuel, constituted of an alkyl sulfide, an alkyl acrylate and a compound for inhibiting the polymerization of the alkyl acrylate, of nitroxide type.<br>
It is known that acrylates are highly reactive monomers that can polymerize spontaneously, especially on storage, to form polyacrylates. Such an uncontrolled polymerization is liable to place in danger people located in proximity to the injection plants, such as local residents or maintenance workers, due to the risk of explosion. This polymerization arising during storage, including, for example, in the storage tanks or vats of the injection plants, may also lead to rapid fouling or even blocking of the pipes between the storage, tanks and the point of injection. Such a phenomenal* may lead to an uncontrolled drop in the concentration of odorizer in the natural ga$, which<br>
increases the risk associated with an undetected gas leak.<br>
To avoid this, hydroquinones are commonly a#ded to acrylaterkased odorizing compositions to inhibit their polymerization, as taught in US 3 816 627, which concerns the manufacture of acrylate. In ofder to function, the hydroquinone-based inhibiting •. system needs oxygen, since the active form of the inhibitor is a molecule comprising a radical that is formed following the reaction of the inhibitor with oxygen and traps the polymerization precursors. This inhibitor requires storage of the odorizing mixture in air. This condition is not respected when an odorizer ; storage tank is under pressure of natural gas, which makes it possible to increase the yield of the purtips for injecting odorizer into the gas. Storage under nitrogen also exists. In this case, as with natural gas, the hydroquinone cannot react with oxygen to form a radical and therefore does not play its role of inhibitor, which places the user in danger of risk of explosion following an uncontrolled polymerization, but also may cause fouling or even rapid blocking of the pipes between the storage reservoir and the point of injection. The consequence of this latter point is an uncontrolled drop in the concentration of odorizer in the gas, leading to an increased risk of explosion due to undetected gas leaks.<br>
The odorizing mixture based on alkyl acrj/iate(s) according to the invention can overcome the drawbacks described above due not only to the absence of sulfur compound in the mixture (no release of SOg) , fmt also to the absence of oxygen required for activation of the non-nitroxyl polymerization inhibitors. The ojdorizing mixture according to the invention shows stability on storage, irrespective of the nature of the covering g4s, which may or may not contain oxygen.<br>
In contrast with other inhibitors such as ;radical inhibitors belonging to the hydroquinone family, the inhibitors, do not require storage of the odorizing composition in air, whereas storage in air is necessary for radical inhibitors of hydroquinone type. Tfhis has the advantage, at the gas injection plants, of (fooling the storage of the odorizing composition in a suitable tank under pressure of natural gas and thus qf being able to increase the yield of the injection pump^s.<br>
The odorizing compositions according to the invention can also, in certain natural gas injection plants in which the,storage tanks are under nitrogen, be stored under nitrogen.<br>
One subject of the present invention is a composition that can be used especially as an odorizer for a gaseous fuel, more particularly natural gas, comprising:<br>
-	at least one alkyl acrylate (I) in which the alkyl radical contains from 1 to 12 and preferably fiom 1 to 8 carbon atoms;<br>
-	at least one compound of formula (II) in aii amount sufficient, to inhibit the polymerization of tt|e alkyl acrylate(s) (I) in the presence and/or absence of oxygen<br>
in which:<br>
-	Ri and R2, which may be identical or different, each represent a tertiary or secondary hydrocarbon-based radical containing from 2 to 30 and preferably from 4 to 15 carbon atoms, and optionally one or more heteroatoias chosen from sulfur, phosphorus, nitrogen and oxygen; or<br>
-	Ri and %, taken with the nitrogen atom to wh^ch they are attached, form a cyclic hydrocarbon-based\  radical<br>
containing from 4 to 10 and preferably from ;-4 to 6 carbon atoms, said radical being optionally substituted.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) are preferably chosen from methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isjobutyl, tert-butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl and/or j'dodecyl acrylates,. and are advantageously chosen from; methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate and/or n-butyl acrylate.<br>
The compounds of formula (II) are known per sa; their preparation is described, for example, in tfie book "Synthetic; Chemistry of Stable Nitroxides" )f&gt;y L.B. Volodarsky et al., CRC Press, 1993, ISBN: 0-8493-^4590-1.<br>
According to one particularly preferred variant, the composition according to the invention comprises as inhibitor of formula (II) at least one compound;. derived from tetramethylpiperidine oxide (also known as TEMPO) of formula (Ila):<br>
Formula Removed<br><br><br><br><br>
in which R3 represents a hydroxyl, amino, ejster or amide gro«p, preferably R3COO- or R3CON- in whiph R3 is a C1-C4 alkyl radical.<br>
It is advantageously preferred to select the compound of formula (lib) from at least one of the following compounds;<br>
N- (tesrt-butyl) -N- (1- [ethoxy(ethyl)phosphino|propyl) nitroxide of formula:<br><br>
Formula Removed<br>
 (tert-butyl)-N-(l-diethylphosphono-2,2-dimethyl-propyl) nitroxide of formula:<br>
Formula Removed<br><br>
N- (tert-*butyl) -N- ( [2-methyl-l-phenyl] propyl)  nitroxide of formula:<br>
Formula Removed<br>
According to one preferred variant of the composition according to the invention, the polymerization inhibitor (s) (II) is (are) used in an amount ;'of from 50 ppb to 1000 ppm by weight relative to the mass of acrylate(s) present in the mixture.<br>
The odorizing composition according to the invention gives gaseous fuels, especially natural gas after it has been injected therein, a strong odorous? power, comparable to that obtained with odorizers based on alkyl sulfides or mercaptans of the prior art, thus enabling any person present in the vicinity of a leak tQ recognize it and to instigate the appropriate safety measures. This strong odorous power is ^obtained simultaneously with the disappearance of SO2 discharged<br>
into the ecosphere after combustion of the gas thus odorized.<br>
Finally, this composition may be used in injection plants by means of a single storage tank, a single pump and a single injection head, which leads to considerably simplified logistics.<br>
A subject of the present invention is also a process for odorizing an odorless gaseous fuel, comprising the addition of an effective amount of an odorizing composition defined previously comprising at least one alkyl acrylate and at least one compound (II) for inhibiting the polymerization of the alkyl acrylates, which is stable in the presence and in the absence of oxygen. The amount of said composition may be determined by a person skilled in the art by means of routine tests, taking into account the particular characteristics of the gaseous fuel, and of the distribution networks.<br>
Purely as a guide, this effective amount is generally between 1 and 500 mg/Nm3 and preferably between 2 and 50 mg/Nm3.<br>
The composition according to the invention described above may be used in its native form or may be; diluted in a solvent or a mixture of solvents that is inert with respect to acrylates. Examples of solvents that may be mentioned include cyclohexane and n-hexane. The dilution of the composition may be up to 85%, i.e. 15 parts by weight of the composition according; to the invention are diluted in 85 parts by weight of solvent.<br>
The gaseous fuels to which the process according to the invention applies include: natural gas, propane, butane, liquefied petroleum gas (or LPG), or even oxygen or; hydrogen, such as the gas generated by fuel cells.<br>
Natural gas is a preferred gaseous fuel according to the present invention on account of its very broad diffusion and the magnitude of the distribution networks, .making the reduction of any danger resulting from a risk of a leak particularly desirable.<br>
As regards natural gas, the composition that ; may be used as oftorizer is added by injection in specialized plants according to the usual techniques used in this field.<br>
