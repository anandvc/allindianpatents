PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an access means management method for conditional access data, this data being broadcast in particular by satellite, by a terrestrial antenna network or by cable intended for at least one multimedia unit. In particular, this data can be Pay-TV data.<br>
More particularly, it concerns the management of the access means to data when this access is carried out by means of a multimedia unit bound to a subscription with a fixed validity duration or a regularly renewable validity duration.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
The validity conditions for access to Pay-TV services by means of a multimedia unit are stored in a security module. As it is well known to those skilled in the art, the security module can essentially be realised according to four different forms. One of these is a microprocessor card, a smart card, or more generally an electronic module (in the form of a key, badge,...). This type of module is generally removable and connectable to the decoder. The form with electric contacts is the most widely used, but a connection without contact is not excluded, for example of the ISO 14443 type.<br>
A second known form is that of an integrated circuit box, generally placed definitively and irremovably in the decoder. An alternative is made up of a circuit mounted on a base or connector such as a SIM module connector.<br>
In a third form, the security module is integrated into an integrated circuit box that also has another function, for example in a descrambling module of the decoder or the microprocessor of the decoder.<br>
In a fourth embodiment, the security module is not produced as a hardware, but its function is only implemented in software form. Given that in the four cases, although the security level differs, the function is identical, we can talk about security modules regardless of the way in which its function is carried out or the form that this module can take.<br>
2<br><br>
Access conditions to Pay-TV services such as those previously mentioned can be a duration or a credit, for example. In the case of a subscription with a determined duration, in particular when this duration is relatively long, for example one year, it is not desirable to introduce rights or access means into the security module for the totality of the subscription duration. On the contrary, it is preferable to introduce rights or access means for only a fraction of the total duration. As an example, for a subscription with a duration of one year, rights for one month can be introduced. It is clear that before the expiration of the partial duration, it is necessary to renew the rights or the access means for the multimedia units concerned.<br>
The introduction of the rights or the access means related to a fractioned subscription prevents a subscriber from cancelling his/her rights after a relatively short usage time while managing, for example, by switching off the multimedia unit for a certain time, this multimedia unit not to receive the rights' cancellation messages which are intended for this unit. It should be noted that the term "access means" such as used in the description below also encompasses access rights, that is to say the rights necessary to be able to decrypt the data as well as the keys necessary for the decryption of the data. The keys mentioned here can be used to decrypt directly the data or more generally to decrypt the data in an indirect way. This means that the key in question allows the decryption of a message, for example a control message ECM, that contains keys, for example in the form of control words, allowing the decryption of the data.<br>
There are also security modules, generally removable, which give an access right to an event during a predefined duration and which require the reception of a rights' renewal message to continue receiving events or contents. Therefore, this type of module gives an access duration to events of 6 months but for security reasons, it is necessary to receive a rights' confirmation message (or right extension) for all the 30 days. With this type of module, the management centre does not know on which date the renewal message must be sent. In fact, the extension date depends on the date on which the user initially activated his/her security module.<br>
With the existing systems, each time that the partial validity duration associated to a multimedia unit reaches the deadline, the management centre must send a renewal<br>
3<br><br>
message of the access means. These messages are sent in the form of authorization messages EMM.<br>
A problem is posed with this type of message. In fact, numerous multimedia units are only capable of processing these authorization messages when they are active, that is to say when they are neither turned off, nor on standby.<br>
In order to guarantee that the majority of the multimedia units have correctly received an authorization message intended for them, it is necessary to repeat the sending of this type of message several times. This makes a non-optimal use of the available bandwidth. Moreover, the fact that the modem backward channels presently in existence between the multimedia units and the management centre are rather inconvenient, in particular since the modem must be connected in the vicinity of the multimedia unit, in general there are no means provided to indicate to the management centre which multimedia units have correctly received the rights' renewal message.<br>
Another problem appears when a multimedia unit is not used during the period in which the renewal messages are sent. Given that this multimedia unit has not received the necessary access means, it will no longer be able to function. This obliges the subscriber to call a management centre so that the authorization messages are sent to him/her specifically.<br>
The existing means do not allow the optimal management of the renewal messages, they involve an incorrect usage of the resources and are inconvenient for the user in the case that the unit is not used during a certain time.<br>
This invention intends to overcome the drawbacks of the prior art processes by carrying out a process in which it is unnecessary to repeat unnecessary messages several times and in which the management of the authorization messages is thus optimized.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The aim of the invention is achieved by an access means management method of to conditional access data, this data being broadcast to at least one multimedia unit, the<br>
4<br><br>
access means being controlled by a management centre, and these access means being associated to a time information,<br>
said multimedia unit comprising at least one security module in which the<br>
access means to data are stored;<br>
said multimedia unit also including remote communication means with the<br>
management centre and local communication means with said security<br>
module;<br>
characterized in that it includes the steps of:<br>
-	determination by the security module, of the next renewal date of the access means;<br>
-	if the next renewal date of the access means is closer than a preset duration, sending by the security module of a request to the multimedia unit, requesting the renewal of the access means, this request using said local communication means;<br>
-	sending by the multimedia unit of said request for renewal of the access means to the management centre, this request using said remote communication means;<br>
-	verification by the management centre, if said multimedia unit is authorized to renew the access means;<br>
-	in the case of a positive response, sending to said multimedia unit of an access means renewal message.<br>
According to this invention, the request for access means renewal messages is managed by the multimedia unit itself and in particular by the security module that it contains. The latter controls the moment in which the request is sent in such a way that it is possible to arrange for the renewal message to be sent when there is a good chance that the multimedia will be working. The multimedia unit is also able to send a reception message indicating to the management centre that the renewal message has been received correctly. This prevents the management centre from sending unnecessary renewal messages.<br>
It is also possible to broadcast in a conventional way, access means renewal messages when the validity duration for a group of multimedia units expires, for instance a few days before the end of the month. The process of the invention can then be used to<br>
5<br><br>
send a confirmation message to the management centre. It is then possible to send rights' renewal messages, using the process of the invention, only to the multimedia units that have not received these messages in a conventional way. This ensures not only that the management centre does not send numerous unnecessary messages, but also ensures that the multimedia units work even after a prolonged period without use.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
This invention and its advantages will be better understood with reference to the enclosed drawings and to the detailed description of a particular embodiment, in which:<br>
-	Figure 1 shows the elements allowing the implementation of the process of the invention; and<br>
-	Figure 2 schematically represents the steps of the process of the invention.<br>
DETAILED DECRIPTION<br>
With reference to these Figures, the process according to the invention is implemented by means of a system comprising essentially three entities, namely a management centre CG connected to a conditional access data supplier, a multimedia unit STB using said conditional access data and remote communication means ST between the management centre and the multimedia unit. The remote communication means can use a telecommunication satellite capable of communicating bi-directionally with the management centre CG as well as with the multimedia STB units in connection with this satellite. These communication means can also use a terrestrial antenna network and transmit data in conformity with standards DVB-T (Digital Video Broadcasting - Terrestrial) or DVB-H (Digital Video Broadcasting -Handheld). Generally, the events are transmitted to multimedia units in broadcast mode (that is to say that the same content is sent to a large number of units) while the feedback channel is generally a point-to-point channel. In this case, the return communication channel can use a conventional modem or a communication according to GSM standards (Global System for Mobile Communications) or GPRS (General Packet Service Radio) or other similar standards. The remote communication means can also use a cable network.<br>
6<br><br>
In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the access to data is connected to rights or access means acquired in the form of a subscription. In the description below, it is supposed that the subscription has a total duration of one year and that the rights are introduced in a fractionized way in time, for a duration of one month, for example. In a conventional way, these rights are stored in a security module SC connected to the multimedia unit.<br>
The process of the invention operates in the following way, with reference to the Figure 2. According to predefined criteria, for example when the multimedia unit is activated after a pause, this unit verifies if it still disposes of the rights or access means to access the data. In the case of a positive response, it then verifies when the fractionized rights expire. This corresponds to the step with the reference 20. The unit then compares, during a step 21, the duration until the next renewal expiration of the access means with a preset threshold value, correspondent for example to 48 hours. If the comparison indicates that the next renewal deadline is further away than this threshold value, the multimedia unit operates in a conventional way. On the contrary, if the comparison indicates that the renewal deadline is closer than the threshold value, a renewal request is formed.<br>
In the first time, a request is formed by the security module that transmits it to the multimedia unit by local communication means. This corresponds to step 22. This request is then transmitted to the management centre, possibly after modification, processing and preparation by the multimedia unit. This step has the reference 23. For this, the multimedia unit uses the remote bi-directional commumcation means that pass through the telecommunication satellite, an antenna of the terrestrial antenna network or a cable. This request contains at least one identifier of the multimedia issuing unit and an authentication element. The identifier is advantageously sent in clear so that the management centre can determine the origin of the message. However, this identifier could also be encrypted by means of a key common to all the multimedia units connected to the management centre. The authentication element is preferably encrypted by means of a key known from the management centre and the multimedia unit. This key is advantageously specific to each multimedia unit. It can be symmetrical or asymmetrical. This authentication element could be the encrypted identifier. In this way, when the management centre receives a message, the identifier<br>
7<br><br>
in clear allows the origin of the message to be known, which allows the determination, for example in a key table stored in the management centre, of the key that corresponds to the multimedia issuing unit. If the authentication element corresponds to the encrypted identifier, the identifier in plaintext is then encrypted in the management centre by way of the corresponding key and compared to the authentication element received by the remote communication means. It is clear that other authentication procedures can also be used, for example by means of hashing functions. This authentication corresponds to step 24 in Figure 2.<br>
When the management centre has identified and authenticated the multimedia unit that has emitted the request, it then verifies, during a step 25, the rights associated to this multimedia unit. These rights are stored in a database of the management centre and indicate the total duration of the subscription as well as the partial or fractionized duration and possibly the date from which the fractionized renewal can be carried out. If the conditions for renewal are fulfilled, that is to say in particular if the total duration of the subscription has not expired, the new access means can be transmitted during step 26 to the multimedia unit that has made the request.<br>
These access means can be sent in two distinct modes. According to one of these, they are inserted into the data stream broadcast to all the units. This type of message can be encrypted by a global key or by a key specific to the concerned multimedia unit (more particularly, to its security module). The concerned multimedia unit is the only one capable of processing the message(s) in order to extract the access means, that is to say the rights or the keys in particular.<br>
According to a second method, the access means are sent by means of the point-to-point connection that is formed between the multimedia unit and the satellite, an antenna of the terrestrial antenna network or the cable. Therefore, only the corresponding multimedia unit receives individually the necessary authorization messages.<br>
When the authorization messages EMM containing the access means have been received by the multimedia unit, they are transmitted to the security module by local communication means possibly after processing by the multimedia unit. They are then stored in this security module.<br>
8<br><br>
If the renewal conditions are not fulfilled, namely the multimedia unit that has emitted the request no longer disposes of the rights to renew its subscription, two different embodiments are possible. According to one of the embodiments, the management centre does not send anything to the multimedia unit. According to another embodiment, illustrated by reference 27, the management centre sends an inhibitory message to the multimedia issuing unit. This message, which is also transmitted by the remote communication means, has the function of preventing the multimedia unit from re-sending a renewal message while such a renewal is no longer authorized. This prevents the sending of unnecessary messages. It is also possible to send to the subscriber, a message proposing the renewal of his/her subscription and/or explaining the way to proceed.<br>
According to one advantageous embodiment, when the multimedia unit has received a message, whether it is a renewal message or an inhibitory message, and has been capable of processing it correctly, said unit informs the management centre. For this, it sends a confirthation message, during step 28, using the same communication channels as for the sending of the request. If the management centre has received the confirthation message, which is verified during step 29, the process stops, which corresponds to step 30, and the access to data is carried out conventionally. If the confirthation message is not received, the message is repeated until a confirthation is sent. This message can be the renewal message of the access means or the inhibitory message. The sending of this confirthation message prevents the management centre from repeating many times the sending of messages that have already been received.<br>
This invention includes several advantages with reference to the processes of the prior art. In fact, entrusting the management of the sending of the renewal messages to the multimedia unit and not to the management centre allows a success rate with respect to the reception of the renewal messages to be achieved that is considerably greater than in the systems of the prior art. Indeed, it is possible to force the multimedia unit to verify the next renewal expiration date during each of its activations. If a renewal message is sent a short time after this activation, there is a high possibility that it can be processed. In fact, the multimedia unit will certainly still be functioning. Furthermore, as the majority of the messages are correctly processed, the use of the bi-directional communication means allow the detection only of the messages that<br>
9<br><br>
have not been well received. This prevents the sending of a large number of unnecessary messages.<br>
