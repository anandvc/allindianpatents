				<td>The present invention relates to an improved universal fixture for card assembly for printed circuit board. The main embodiment of the present invention resides in handling the printed cards of different dimensions.<br>
The electronic components are assembled on a printed circuit board. During assembly the printed circuit boards are fixed in a fixture and after assembly are removed from the fixture and placed on the conveyor of the wave soldering machine.<br>
However, the cards of different sizes can not easily be placed on the same printed circuit board. If the cards are of different dimensions, then an adjustable type of fixture is required to accommodate cards having different dimensions. These adjustable fixtures can not be easily manufactured because the arms of the adjustable fixture have to be moved to accommodate the changed card dimensions. Therefore a problem has been encountered in the manufacture of these adjustable universal fixtures.<br>
To overcome the problems of a fixture and an adjustable universal fixture for card assembly, need has been felt for a universal fixture which overcomes all the problems associated with the conventional fixtures for card assembling.<br>
The present invention therefore relates to a universal	fixture<br>
for  card assembly which overcomes all shortcoming	of the<br>
conventional fixture cards. The main embodiment of the	present<br>
invention resides in the applicability of the universal	fixture<br>
for card assembly on cards of different shapes and sizes.	Another<br><br>
embodiment of the present invention resides in that the cards can easily be removed from the fixture for wave soldering without disturbing the components placed on the printed circuit board.<br>
One of the very important feature of this universal fixture for card assembly is that, it is very simple, small and convenient set up and is very cost effective as compared to the conventional fixture assemblies.<br>
The fixture for card assembly of the present invention comprises of movable means which can be magnetically attached to the fixture for card assembling. The fixture is made up of a plain magnetic material surface and the size of surface is dictated by the application and ease of handling desired. These movable means are attached on to the magnetic surface or base plate of fixture which can not slide easily over the surface of the fixture. The movable means moves over the surface of the magnetic surface of the fixture on applying force, however, these fixtures have resistance to movement because they are attached to the magnetic base plate of fixture with the magnetic force.<br>
The movable means of the present invention for universal fixture for card assembly can be of any shape such as conical, square rectangular. These movable means are made up of antistatic material with a magnetic bottom. Any such antistatic material can be employed for the purpose of manufacture of such movable means, e.g. plastics form an appropriate material for making such movable means. These antistatic materials are however essentially provided with a magnetic bottom.<br><br>
4 STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a universal fixture assembly for printed circuit board comprising of a magnetic base, a plurality of pairs of cones and/or stoppers placed adjacent to the corners of the -said magnetic bottom, mounting holes having diameter in proportion to the edge of the cone provided on the said printed circuit board conforming to the edges of the cones, characterized in that movable means are provided as the magnetic surface or base plate of the fixture as herein before described magnetically attached to the said fixture for removing the printed circuit board for wave soldering without disturbing the components assembled on the said printed circuit board and movable fixture provided in the said base for adjusting the height of the said printed circuit board with respect to the said base.<br>
The subject invention can better be understood from the following description in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein:<br>
Figure 1 depicts the positioning of cones<br>
Figure 2 depicts the positioning of the stoppers on the edges of printed circuit board.<br>
These movable means can be better understood with reference to the accompanying drawings where two different types of moving means of the are defined. Cones (1) can be used for the cards having mounting holes (2) on 4 corners or strategic places. Below these holes as depicted in figure 1, cones (1) are placed facilitating assembling of the card (3).<br><br>
If the mounting holes are not available, the stoppers (14) can be used on the edge of the Printed Circuit board (3) as depicted clearly in figure 2.<br>
Thus the present invention provides universal fixture for card assembly of cards of various shapes and sizes. Any odd shaped card can be used on the improved fixture of the present invention. The Printed circuit board as a result can be placed any where on the fixture as per the convenience of the operator or the requirement of such operator. Another advantage of the improved fixture of the present invention resides in that the cards can be removed from the fixture for wave soldering very easily without disturbing the components assembled on the printed circuit board.<br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM :-<br>
1.	A universal fixture assembly for printed circuit board<br>
comprising of a magnetic base, a plurality of pairs of cones<br>
and/or stoppers placed adjacent to the   corners of the said<br>
magnetic bottom, mounting holes having diameter in proportion to<br>
the edge of the cone provided on the said printed circuit board<br>
conforming to the edges of the cones,  characterized in that<br>
movable means are provided as the magnetic surface or base plate<br>
of the fixture as herein before described magnetically attached<br>
to the said fixture for removing the printed circuit board  for<br>
wave soldering without disturbing the components assembled on the<br>
said printed circuit board and movable fixtures provided in the<br>
said base for adjusting the height of the said  printed circuit<br>
board with respect to the said base .<br>
2.	A universal fixture assembly as claimed in claim 1, wherein<br>
the said movable means are conical, square or rectangular  made of antistatic material having a magnetic base.<br>
3.	A universal fixture assembly as claimed in claim 1, wherein<br>
the said stoppers comprise of matching grooves and notch<br>
conforming to the width of the said printed circuit board.<br>
4.   A universal fixture assembly substantially as hereinbefore described with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br></td>
