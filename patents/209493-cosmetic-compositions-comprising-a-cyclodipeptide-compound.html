COSMETIC COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING A CYCLODIPEPTIDE COMPOUND<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the slndian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br><br><br><br>
The  following   specification   particularly  describes  the   nature  of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
WO 03/059307<br><br>
PCT/EP02/I4525<br><br><br><br><br><br>
COSMETIC COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING A CYCLODIPEPTIDE COMPOUND<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
\ The present invention relates to cosmetic compositions for application to human skin, to the preparation and use of such compositions and to structurants for incorporation in such compositions and their preparation.<br>
10  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION AND SUMMARY OF PRIOR ART<br><br>
15<br>
20<br><br>
A wide var'iety of cosmetic compositions for application to human skin make use of a structured liquid carrier to deliver colour or some other active material to the surface of the skin.  Significant examples of such cosmetic compositions include antiperspirant or deodorant<br>
compositions which are widely used in order to enable their<br>
 users to avoid or minimise wet patches on their skin,<br>
especially emission of<br>
'in axillary regions or to control or prevent the malodours, which could otherwise arise when the<br><br>
user perspires.  Other examples of cosmetic compositions<br><br>
include lipsticks.<br><br>
Although structuring is a term that has often been employed<br>
25  in respect of materials which structure a carrier liquid,<br>
I1 various othejr terms have been employed alternatively,<br>
including solidifying and gelling.<br>
Antiperspirant or deodorant formulations have been provided<br><br>
30<br><br>
with a range<br><br>
of different product forms.  One of these is a<br><br>
so-called "stick" which is usually a bar of an apparently<br><br>
WO 03/059307<br><br>
PCT/EP02/14525<br><br><br><br>
firm solid material held within a dispensing container and<br>
which retains being applied<br><br><br>
its structural integrity and shape whilst In that respect they are representative, of cosmetic comp'ositions in stick form containing other active constituents.  When a portion of the stick is drawn across the skin surface, a film of the stick composition is transferred to the skin surface.  Although the stick has the appearance of a solid article capable of retaining its own shape for a period of time, the material often has a structured liquid phase so that a film of the composition is readily transferred from the stick to another surface upon contact.<br><br><br><br>
Antiperspirant Suspension sti<br><br><br><br><br>
sticks can be divided into three categories. rks contain a particulate antiperspirant active material suspended in a structured carrier liquid phase which often is anhydrous and/or in many instances may<br>
be water-immiseible.  Emulsion sticks normally have a<br>
 hydrophilic phase, commonly containing the antiperspirant<br>
active in solution, this phase forming an emulsion with a<br>
second, more hydrophobic, liquid phase.  The continuous<br>
phase of the emulsion is structured.  Solution sticks<br>
typically have the antiperspirant active dissolved in a<br>
structured liquid phase which is polar and may comprise a<br>
I polar organic solvent, which is often water-miscible, and<br>
the polar phase<br>
can contain water.<br><br>
There is substantial literature on structuring, of...cosmetic<br><br>
compositions,   for example as  represented by antiperspirant       or deodorant  compositions.<br><br>
WO 03/059307<br><br>
PCT/EP02/14525<br><br>
Conventionally, many sticks have been structured using naturally-occurring or synthetic waxy materials, in which term we include materials which resemble beeswax, in that they soften progressively with increase in temperature until they are fluid, generally by about 95°C.  Examples of wax-structured sticks are described in an article in Cosmetics and Toiletries, 1990, Vol 105, P75478, in US patents 5169626 and 4725432 and in many other publications, in some of which<br><br>
such material<br><br>
s are called solidifying agents,<br><br>
More specifically, it has been common practice for sticks to<br><br>
be structured<br><br>
or solidified by incorporating fatty alcohol<br><br><br><br>
15<br><br><br>
of castor wax J alcohol tend t to human skin; clothing when<br>
into the composition, often accompanied by a smaller amount<br>
Sticks which are structured with fatty b leave visible white deposits on application moreover the deposits can also transfer onto it comes into contact .with the skin and the<br>
wearer can, for example, find white marks at the armhole of the sleeveless garment.  Fatty alcohols are often regarded as coming within the general category of waxy materials, but we have observed that they are a more significant source of<br><br><br><br>
white deposits<br><br>
than various other waxy materials<br><br>
Some alternative structurants or solidifying agents to waxy-materials have been proposed.  For example, the use of dibenzylidene sorbitol (DBS) or derivatives thereof as gellant for a polar or hydrophylic carrier liquid has been<br>
proposed in a number of publications such as EP-A-5-1-277-0-,<br>
11 WO-92/19222, US!4954333, US 4822602 and US 4725430.<br>
Formulations containing such gellants can suffer from a<br>
number of disadvantages, including instability m the<br><br>
WO 03/059307	PCT/EP02/14525<br>
presence oflacidic antiperspirants,.and comparatively high processing temperatures needed in the production of sticks.<br>
Other alternative proposed structurants include various classes of esters or amides that are solid at ambient temperature and are capable of solidifying a hydrophobic or water-immiscible liquid carrier.  One such class comprises ester or amide derivatives of 12-hydroxystearic acid, as described in inter alia US-A-5750096.  Another class of such esters or amides comprises N-acyl amino acid amides and esters, of which N-Lauroyl-L-glutamic acid di-n-butylamide is commercially available from Ajinomoto under their designation GP-1.  They are described in US patent 3969087. A further class which has been disclosed as gelling agents comprises the amide derivatives of di and tribasic . carboxylic acids set forth in WO 98/27954 notably alkyl N,N'-dialkyl succinamides.  Yet other amide structurants for water-immiscible liquid carriers are described in EP-A-<br>
1305604.<br>
hough many amido-structurants have been identified already, it remains an objective to locate others which may meet the exacting standards of the cosmetic industry and ameliorate or eliminate one or more of the difficulties or disadvantages associated with the various amido structurants that have already been proposed or used.<br>
One further class of compounds which contain a -CO-NH- group<br>
11'<br>
comprises cyclodipeptides, which are cyclic	derivatives of<br>
aminoacids.  Various cyclodipeptides has been described in<br><br>
an article by K<br><br>
Hanabusa et al entitled Cyclo(dipeptide)s as<br><br>
WO 03/059307<br><br>
PCT/EP02/14525<br><br>
low molecular-mass Gelling Agents to harden Organic Fluids, J. Chem Soc. Commun., 1994 ppl40l/2.  The cyclodipeptides satisfied the general formula R2<br><br>
in which Rx  and R2 are designated organic residues.  The selection exemplified included two materials (8 and 9) in which Ri represented alkyl esters, being either -CH2C02CH2CH2CH2Me or -CH2C02CH2CH2CHMeCH2CH2CH2CHMe2 and R2 represented -CH2Ph.  This paper is herein referred to as Hanabusa I.<br><br>
In an introductory section, Hanabusa states that the most difficult problem for the development of low molecular mass gelling agents is how to stabilise the formed gel, in other<br>
words how to prevent the transformation from the metastable<br>
II qel to a crystalline state.  Having conducted an extensive<br>
II research programme into gels formed using low molecular mass<br>
gellants, the Applicants are able to,confirm that the<br>
stabilisation of such gels often does indeed represent a<br>
be exacerbated other cosmetic<br>
serious and difficult problem, and indeed a problem that can<br>
in cosmetic compositions by the presence of ingredients.  Hanabusa I subsequently makes a general assertion that the formed gels (sic. employing" the exemplified cyclodipeptides in the list of organic fluids given in Table 1) were stable even after several months.<br><br>
WO 03/059307	PCT/EP02/14?2?<br>
Various other cyclo(dipeptides) satisfying formula 1 above were described in a second article by Hanabusa et al entitled Low Molecular Weight Gelators for Organic Fluids: Gelation using a Family of Cyclo(dipeptide)s, in  the Journal of Colloid and Interface Science 224, 231-244 (2000), hereiln called Hanabusa II.  The text disclosed materials no 22 to 28, which were further esters like those of materials :8 and 9 in Hanabusa I, except that they were<br>
derived from different alkanols.  Applicants have found that<br>
 such esters, and in particular 27 and 28 in Hanabusa II,<br>
 produced gels that were only poorly stable.<br>
Applicants tested a number of materials as gellants in oils<br>
that are common in cosmetic formulations in accordance with<br>
Formula 1 in Hanabusa I, 11-27 and 11-28, which seemed to be<br>
 Hanabusa's best gellants. Unfortunately, the resultant<br>
 products demonstrated inferior storage characteristics, at<br>
laboratory ambient temperatures-.  Applicants deduced- that at<br>
best, the capability of cyclodipeptides to gel organic fluid<br>
stably could vary significantly, depending on the chemical<br>
nature of the substituent residues Ri and R2 •<br>
ii A number of cyclic dipeptide derivatives have been described<br>
as gellants in Japanese kokai No 2001-247451, in the name of<br>
 Pola Chemical Industries Inc and Nisshin Oil Mills Ltd.<br>
These were either alkyl derivatives, which had already been<br>
described by Hanabusa or the unsubstituted cyclohexyl<br>
derivative which likewise showed inferior stability when<br>
I tested in the same manner as those proposed by Hanabusa.<br><br>
WO 03/059307<br><br>
PCT/EP02/14525<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
Applicants have now found that selected cyclodipeptide derivatives can be used as structurants for cosmetic compositions I  When used as a modest percentage of the composition, typically not more than 15% by weight and often less than 10% by weight, they are able to structure the composition in a manner that is superior to that achieved by material 11-27 and 11-28 of Hanabusa.  Indeed, at the same<br>
!<br>
be recognised! alternatively<br>
time, and where appropriate, the composition can yield a deposit with [no worse than a low visible residue.  It will that cyclodipeptide derivatives herein may be called diketopiperazine derivatives.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide structured cosmetic compositions, in which a liquid carrier<br><br>
material is ste<br><br>
ructured using a structuring agent which is<br><br>
different from those mentioned above.  A further object" of" the invention is to provide a structurant which can exhibit a superior property to at least structurants 11-27 and 11-28 of Hanabusa identified above.<br>
A yet further object of some embodiments of the invention is to provide compositions which exhibit low visible deposits.<br>
It has been found that the properties of gels in hydrophobic carrier liquids can be improved by esterifying a cyclo(dipeptidej) acid with an alcohol producing a cyclic residue.<br><br>

Broadly, in La first aspect of the,present invention, there is provided a cosmetic composition comprising:<br>
(i)  an antiperspirant active material 5  (ii) a continuous phase which comprises water-immiscible<br>
liquid carrier, and<br>
II (ii) a strucfcurant therein which comprises a cyclodipeptide<br>
derivative having the general formula<br>
O<br><br>
10 in which RA represents a carbocyclic, or heterocyclic group<br>
containing not||more than 2 rings, other than unsubstituted<br>
cyclohexyl.	Such cyclodipepjtide compounds are sometimes referred to 15  herein as DOPA derivatives or DOPAD and the residue<br>
containing the cyclodipeptide and the carboxyl group is<br>
! sometimes called herein a DOPA residue.<br><br>
WO 03/059307<br><br>
PCT/EP02/14525<br><br>
For the avoidance of doubt, in the DOPA derivatives employed<br><br>
herein, the DOPA residue<br><br>
cyclic group within RA is directly bonded to the<br><br><br><br>
10<br><br>
A DOPA derivative as above serves as a structuring agent for the water^immiscible liquid carrier and when used in a sufficient amount, which is likely to be less than 15% of the total composition, is able to structure this liquid into<br>
a gel with sufficient rigidity to sustain its own shape.<br>
ii<br>
We have observed that the structuring compounds used in this invention form fibres or strands within the liquid phase.<br><br><br><br>
Without being<br><br>
bound to any specific theory or explanation,<br><br>
15  we believe that upon gel formation a network of such fibres is formed which extends throughout the liquid phase.  Upon heating the gel to the gel melting temperature, the strands of structurant dissolve and the liquid phase becomes more mobile.<br>
20<br><br>
25<br><br>
In order to promote good sensory properties at the time of<br>
use it is preferred to include a silicone oil as	at least a<br>
Ifraction of the water-immiscible carrier liquid.	The amount<br>
of silicone oil may be at least 10%"by weight of	the<br>
composition and/or at least 25% by weight of the	water-<br>
immiscible carrier liquid.<br><br><br><br>
30<br><br>
Fatty alcohols which are solid at room temperature of 20°C, such as stearyjl alcohol, lead to deposits with an opaque white appearance and are preferably substantially absent, by which we mean present in an amount of no more than 3% by<br><br>

weight of the composition, more preferably less than 1% and<br>
ji	! '<br>
most preferably 0%.  As already mentioned, fatty alcohols<br>
are often regarded as coming within the general category of.<br>
waxy materials.  More generally the term "wax" is<br>
conventionally applied to a variety of materials and<br>
diversity in properties.<br>
mixtures (including some fatty alcohols) which have some<br>

solid at 30°GI, often also solid up to 40°C, having a waxy 10  appearance ori feel, but which gradually soften and<br>
eventually melt to a mobile liquid at a temperature below<br>
95°C usually below 90°C.<br>
ii<br><br>
Possibly the composition does not include more than 3% of<br>
any material which is a wax, ie a solid at 3 0°C but softens<br>
II at an elevated temperature and at 95°C is molten and soluble<br>
l| in the water-immiscible liquid, yet which is unable to form<br>
a network of fjibres therein on cooling to 20°C.<br>
As^w-ill be explained in more detail below, in cosmetic compositions herein, the structured water-immiscible carrier liquid may be the continuous phase in the presence of a<br>
dispersed second phase, which may comprise a suspension of<br>

of droplets ofjja lypohobic liquid.  Such a solid may be a<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION AND EMBODIMENTS<br>
As mentioned hereinabove, in accordance with the first aspect, the invention requires a structurant compound within a water-immiscible liquid phase.  Other materials may also<br>
be present depending on the nature of the composition.  The<br>
II various materials will now be discussed by turn and<br>
II	;<br>
preferred features and possibilities will be indicated.<br>
The structurant compounds of the present invention satisfy the general formula:<br><br>

PCT/EP02/14525<br><br>
14<br><br>
in which group contain! unsubstituted<br><br>
RA represents a carbocyclic or heterocyclic ng not more than 2 rings, other than cyclohexyl.<br><br>
Desirably, the substituted by<br><br>
carbocyclic or heterocyclic group in RA is at least one alkyl, ether or ester<br><br>
unsaturation. aromatic group<br>
substituent and/or contains at least! one degree of ring<br>
The ring unsaturation may result in a non-, for example comprising 1 or 2 degrees of<br>
unsaturation or an aromatic group.  Although gels made using the derivative in which RA represents an unsubstituted cyclohexyl group are relatively unstable during storage under normal storage conditions, stability can be improved<br>
by distributing one or more substituents around the<br>
ll cyclohexyl group or by introducing unsaturation or a hetero<br>
atom.<br>
Herein, RA can comprise two fused rings, but preferably comprises a single six membered ring, either carbocyclic or<br><br>
WO 03/059307<br><br>
PCT/EP02/14525<br><br>
15<br>
heterocyclic!, or a bridged ring.  When A is carbocylic, it can be either saturated or unsaturated, preferably unsaturated or aromatic.  When RA is heterocyclic, it is preferably saturated.<br><br>
Although the cyclic group within Rft can be unsubstituted, with the exception of cyclohexyl, it is preferably substituted by at least one alkyl substituent, which preferably contains no more that 16 carbon atoms.  In some highly desirable embodiments the alkyl substituent has a longest chain length of up to 4 carbon atoms, and in certain<br>
or those a total carbon content of up to 5 carbon-atoms.<br>
II The alkyl substituent may be linear' or branched.  Preferred<br>
examples include methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl<br>
isobutyl or t-butyl or isopentyl.  In a number of very<br>
suitable DOPA derivatives, RA contains two or more alkyl<br>
substituents and especially those selected from the above<br>
II list of preferred examples.  The alkyl substituents may be<br>
the same, such a combination<br>
as two or more methyl substituents, or may be<br>
of different substituents such as a methyl and<br>
I isopropyl substituents.  When RA is saturated, the<br>
substituents may depend from the same carbon atom in the<br>
ring, such as two methyl groups, or from different carbon<br>
atoms.  In several highly desirable derivatives, two alkyl<br>
substituents are meta or para to each other, for example<br>
meta methyl groups or a para methyl and isopropyl group.  In<br>
yet other derivatives, the ring may include a methylene<br>

The DOPA derivatives used in this invention may be a mixture 20  of compounds within the general formulae given, or may be a single compound.<br>
These DOPA derivatives can be prepared by reacting the respective alcohol with DOPA in acid form (DOPAA), or 25  possibly with an acid chloride, or possibly an anhydride or<br>

If the composition is an emulsion with a separate disperse phase, the amount of structurant compound(s) is likely to be from 0.15 to 20% by weight of the continuous phase, more likely from 0.4% to 8% of this phase.  In some highly desirable embodiments the hydrophobic 10  carrier phase contains from 1.5 to'4.5% by weight based on that phase ofj the DOPAD.  It will be recognised that the invention DOPA structurants are particularly advantageous because they are able to produce hard gels at even low<br>
concentrations of structurant.  This is beneficial, not only<br>
II 15  because reduces the cost of the structurant, often a<br>
relatively expensive ingredient, but also releases<br>
formulation space for incorporating other desirable<br>
ingredients in the composition and reduces the amount of<br>
ingredient which might contribute to visible deposits.  Use<br>

desired that this carrier is liquid (in the absence of structurant) at temperatures of 15,°C and above.  It may have some volatility but its vapour pressure will generally be less than 4kPa (30 mmHg) at 25°C so that the material can be. referred to as an oil or mixture of oils.  More specificallyj it is desirable that at least 80% by weight of the hydrophobic carrier liquid should consist of materials with a vapour pressure not over this value of 4kPa at 25°C.<br>
10  It is preferred that the hydrophobic carrier material includes a volatile liquid silicone, i.e. liquid polyorganosiloxane.  To class as "volatile" such material should have a measurable vapour pressure at 20 or 25°C. Typically the vapour pressure of a volatile silicone lies in<br><br>

Aliphatic alcohols which are liquid at 2 0°C may be employed, and it is especially desirable to employ those which are water-immiscible.  These include branched chain alcohols of<br>
at least 10 carbon atoms such as isostearyl alcohol and<br>

Liquid Disperse Phase in emulsions!<br>
II 10<br>
If the composition is an emulsion in which the DOPA<br>
derivative acts as a structurant in the hydrophobic<br>
continuous phase, the emulsion will contain a more polar or<br>
|l lypophobic disperse phase.  The disperse phase may be a<br>
15  solution of an active ingredient.<br>
The hydrophilic disperse phase in an emulsion commonly comprises water as solvent and can comprise one or more water soluble or water miscible liquids in addition to or in 20  replacement of water.  The proportion of water in an emulsion according to the present invention is often selected in the range of up to 60%,; and particularly from . 10% up to 40% or 50% of the whole formulation.<br>

In an emulsion the disperse phase is likely to constitute 15  from 5 to 80 or 85% of the weight of the composition<br>
preferably from 5 to 50 or 65% more, preferably from 25 or 3'5% up to 5'0 or 65%, while the continuous phase with the structurant therein provides the balance from 15 or 35% up to 95% of the weight of the composition.  Compositions with 20  high proportion of disperse phase, i.e. from 65 to 85%<br>
disperse phase, may be advantageous,;because they can give good hardness even though the concentration of structurant may be only a small percentage of the total composition.

Generally thejcontainer will include a cap for its open end and a component part which is sometimes referred to as an elevator or piston fitting within the barrel and capable of relative axiall movement along it.  The stick of composition<br><br>

Composition Preparation<br>
I!<br>
Compositions of this invention can be produced by conventional processes for making cosmetic solids.  Such processes invqlve forming a heated mixture of the composition at; a temperature which is sufficiently elevated<br>
I!<br>
that all the structurant dissolves, pouring that mixture<br>
into a mould,<br>
which may take the form of a dispensing<br><br>

container, and] then cooling the mixture whereupon the<br>
structurant solidifies into a network of fibres extending<br>
II through the waiter-immiscible liquid phase.<br>
A convenient process sequence for a composition which is a suspension comprises first forming a solution of the structurant in the water-immiscible;liquid or one of the water-immiscible liquids.  This is normally carried out by-agitating the mixture at a temperature sufficiently high that all the structurant dissolves (the dissolution temperature) such as a temperature in a range from 50 to 140°C.  Thereafter, the particulate!constituent, for example particulate antiperspirant active, is blended with the hot mixture.  This must be done slowly, or the particulate solid must be preheated, in order to avoid premature gelation. The resulting blend is then introduced into a dispensing container such as a stick barrel.  This is usually carried out at a temperature 5 to 30°C above the setting temperature of the composition.  The container and contents are then cooled to ambient temperature.  Cooling may be brought about by nothing more than allowing the container and contents to cool.  Cooling may be assisted by blowing ambient or even refrigerated air over the containers and their contents.<br><br>

with the continuous phase.  Alternatively, the solution is introduced at a rate which maintains the temperature of the mixture.  If it is necessary to work at a temperature above the boiling temperature of the disperse phase, or at a<br>
temperature where evaporation from this phase is<br>

significant, a pressurised apparatus could be used to allow<br>
a higher temperature to be reached.  With the structurant<br>
materials of this invention this isi usually unnecessary.<br>
After the two<br>
phases are mixed, the resulting mixture is<br>
filled into dispensing containers, typically at a temperature 5 to 3 0°C above the setting temperature of the composition, and allowed to cool as, described above for suspension sticks.<br><br>

composition, such as an alcohol, eg an alcoholic carrier fluid, ie, a branched aliphatic alcohol, eg isostearyl alcohol or octyldodecanol, optionally in conjunction with an alcohol having some water-miscibility and boiling point"<br>

Structurant Preparation<br>
i;<br>
The DOPA derivatives employed as structurants herein can be made by esterdfying DOPA in acid form with the alcohol corresponding to the residue desired in the DOPA derivative.<br><br>
of a substant alcohol, such period.  Desi<br>
In one convenient precursor step, the DOPA acid (DOPAA) can be made by cyclising aspartame, preferably in the presence<br>
ial excess of a low molecular weight aliphatic<br>
reaction, the the resultant<br>
as isopropanol, under reflux for a long rably, the alcohol is employed in. a weight ratio to aspartame of greater than 50:1 such as up to 100:1, and the reaction is continued for at least 10 hours at reflux temperature, such as from 15 to 24 hours.  During the aspartame gradually dissolves.  On cooling, solution yields a white powder.  Removal of<br>
the solvent from the filtrate yields a solid which, after washing with acetone, provides a further amount of the white product, confirmed by a combined yield of the DOPA acid of 79 %.<br>
DOPAA can be[reacted with the relevant alcohol of formula RAOH, preferably in a mole ratio to; the DOPAA of at least 1:1 to 10:1, particularly from 1.5:1 to 7:1 and especially at<br>
least 2.-1 in 'dimethyl	sulphoxide,..conveniently in a ratio of<br>
at least 4 :1 I; (vol :wt) , preferably from 6:1 to 12:1, and preferably in; the presence of a promoter, such as a<br><br>

-   40   -<br>
carbonyldiimidazole, in an amount preferably from 0.5 to 2 moles of promoter per mole of DOPA acid.  The reaction is conveniently carried out at a mildly elevated temperature, such as up to 60°C and particularly^ from 40 to 60°C for a 5  period of at least 6 hours and preferably from 9 to 24<br>
hours.  The resultant solution is quenched in excess ambient or cooler water, desirably after the solution has cooled to ambient, a solid precipitates and is filtered off, water washed until no residual diimidazole remained and then can 10  be purified by washing with diethyl, ether or toluene, and<br>

The bottle was then removed from the heat and the solution allowed to cool and gel under quiescent conditions.<br><br>
The gel hardness was determined by a skilled assessor of 30  gels using a qualitative assessment' by comparison with standard gels after the gels had been stored at ambient<br><br>

The clarity was determined by visual assessment by comparison with standards and for some samples, light transmission measurements were made by the general method described in WO 00/61082, incorporated herein by reference.  The results are summarised herein in Table 4.<br>
Gel stability was assessed of a number of samples employing the structurant at a concentration of 1.5% by weight by<br>

From Table 4,<br><br>
it can be seen than the invention structurants<br><br>
were able to produce gels in a wide range of representative hydrophobic liquid carrier systems, whereas various related<br>
structurants in RA did not satisfy the criteria of the<br>
I 5 ' instant invention were not so able.  Some comparative<br>
(I structurants produced opaque pastes or simply produced a<br>
If	, . „   ,	•  .<br>
mixture of undissolved solids plus supernatant liquid.<br>
From Table 5, it can be seen that even those structurants 10  which produced gels initially, such;as CA, CB and CC,<br>
exhibited poor stability, becoming opaque and soft, followed by leaking, and/or collapsed quickly, whereas those gels produced using structurants according to the present<br>
invention were considerably more stable.  Many of the<br>
II 15  invention gels were not showing any discernible change after<br>
several months.  It will further more be recognised that the<br>
invention gellants employing RA that is unsaturated in the<br>
ring or a ring that is substituted by an alkyl ether or<br>
ester group is superior to a comparison DOPAD in which RA<br>
20  represents cyclohexyl.  Likewise, it can be seen that the invention DOPADs in which the ring is a direct substituent of the cyclic dipeptide are superior to comparisons in which an unsaturated (phenyl) ring is separated from the cyclic dipeptide by an intervening methylene group.<br>

Example 3 - Opaque Suspension Sticks<br><br>
In Example 3, specified eye<br>
opaque sticks were made by dissolving the o dipeptide structuraht in the liquid alcohol or alcohol mixture, eg isostearyl alcohol whilst with heated and stirring using an overhead paddle stirrer until complete dissolution had occurred.  In formulations additionally<br>
I!<br>
approximately desired solid and with gentl<br>
containing a further structurant, namely GP1 DBS and/or 12-HSA, the latter was dissolved into solution of the cyclo dipeptide structurant at a temperature of about 5 to 10°C lower.  The remaining carrier oils were heated to<br>
50°C and stirred using a stirrer bar and the antiperspirant active;was introduced slowly e stirring into them.: When all the active had<br>
been added, the mixture was sheared using a Silverson mixer<br>
II at 7000rpm for 5 minutes to ensure the active was fully<br>
dispersed.  The active/oil mixture was then heated in an<br>
II oven to 85°C and mixed into the structurant solution which<br>
had been allowed to cool to 90°C.  The temperature of the<br>
stirred mixture was kept at 85°C until it was poured into<br>
conventional commercial 50g stick barrels and allowed to<br>
cool except for formulations containing GP1 which were<br>
II poured at approximately 75°C.<br><br>
The formulations and properties of the sticks are summarised<br>

From Table 7,<br><br>
it can be seen that sticks of acceptable<br><br>
firmness can be obtained using the invention structurants at 5  comparatively low concentrations of the structurant.<br>
measured by a and therefore<br>
Moreover, even though suspension sticks that are structured using the invention structurants are a- little- softer (as-<br>
penetrometer) than either the GS or WS sticks might be expected to suffer from a higher pay-<br>
off and higher visible deposits, the pay-off is similar to such sticks and the whiteness is, on balance, lower.<br>
Example 4 - Transparent Suspension Sticks<br>
The sticks in this Example were made using the process of Example 3 together with a preparatory step.  In the preparatory st!ep, the RI of the antiperspirant active was first measured using a standard procedure (Becke. line-test)-The proportions of each of the carrier oils were then determined (through calculation and measurement) such that their weight averaged refractive index was closely matched<br><br>

The remaining water immiscible carrier oils an emulsifier, Abil EM 90, were heated to 85°C in an oil bath whilst being shear mixed at 2500 rpm.  The solution of antiperspirant active was heated to 8 0°C and<br>
0  introduced gradually into the oil/emulsifier mixture, and the resultant mixture was kept constant by heating at 85°C and sheared at 7500 rpm for 5 minutes.  The emulsion was the mixed into the solution of the structurant solution which had been allowed to cool to - 90°C.i The resultant mixture<br>

From Table 9,   it can be seen that even though the stick in Example 5.1 was comparatively soft for a stick., it had acceptable pay-off and only a low visible deposit.  Visually<br>
it was slightly translucent.  The somewhat harder stick of<br>

specified to a flat upper<br>
and rigidity of a composition which is a firm determined by penetrometry.  If the composition is a softer solid, this will be observed as a substantial lack of any resistance to the penetrometer probe. A suitable procedure is to utilises a lab plant PNT<br>
equipped with a Seta wax needle (weight 2.5 has a  cone angle at the point of the needle<br>
be 9°10' + 15'. A sample of the composition with surface is used. The needle is lowered onto the<br>
five seconds Desirably the<br>
surface of the composition and then a penetration hardness measurement is conducted by allowing the needle with its holder to drop under a total weight, (i.e. the combined weight of needle and holder) of 50 ,'grams for a period of<br>
after which the depth of penetration is noted. test is carried out at a number of points on each sample a'nd the results are averaged. Utilising a test of this nature, an appropriate hardness for use in an open-ended dispensing container is a penetration of less than 3 0 mm in this test, for example in a range from 2 to 30 mm. Preferably the penetration is in a range from 5mm to 20 mm.<br><br>
In a specific protocol for this test measurements on a stick 25  were performed in the stick barrel.  The stick was wound up<br>
to project from the open end of the barrel, and then cut off<br>
l|	-<br>
to leave a flat, uniform surface.  The needle was carefully<br>
lowered to the stick surface, and then a "pens t rat "ion<br>
hardness measurement was conducted..  This process was<br>
3 0  carried out at six different points on the stick surface.<br><br>

The hardness |jreading quoted is the ^average value of the 6 measurements.<br>
ii) Deposition by firm sticks (pay-off)<br>
standardised surface is de<br>
5  Another property of a composition is the amount of it which is delivered onto a surface when the composition is drawn across that surface (representing the application of a stick product to human skin), sometimes called the pay-off.  To carry out this test of deposition when the composition is a 10  firm stick, able to sustain its own shape, a sample of the composition with standardised shape and size is fitted to apparatus which draws the sample across a test surface under conditions.  The amount transferred to the termined as an increase in the weight of the<br>
15  substrate to which it is applied.  If desired the colour, opacity or clarity of the deposit may subsequently be determined.  A specific procedure for such tests of deposition and whiteness applicable to a firm solid stick used apparatus to apply a deposit from a stick onto a<br>
2 0  substrate under standardised conditions and then measures<br>
I! the mean level of white deposits using image analysis.<br>
The substrate's used were:<br>
a:     12 x 28cm strip of grey abrasive paper (3M™ P800<br>
2 5	WetorDry™ Carborundum paper)<br>
b:     12 x 2 8cm strip of black Worsted wool fabric. The substrates were weighed before use.  The sticks were previously unused and with domed top surface unaltered.<br><br>

having a mounting to receive a standard size stick barrel was mounted on an arm that was moveable horizontally across the substrate by means of a pneumatic piston.<br>
positioned to standardised stick lateral substrate was The whiteness as described<br>
Each stick was kept at ambient laboratory temperature overnight before the measurement was made.  The stick was advanced to project a measured amount from the barrel.  The barrel was then placed in the apparatus and a spring was<br>
biassed the stick against the substrate with a iorce. The apparatus was operated to pass the ly across the substrate eight times.  The<br>
carefully removed from the rig and reweighed.<br>
of the deposit could -subsequently be measured at (v) below.<br><br>

(iii)  Whiteness of Deposit<br><br>
The. dep.osits their whitene<br><br>
from the at test (ii) above, were assessed for ss shortly after application (ie within 3 0<br><br>
minutes) or after an interval of 24 hours approximately.<br>
20<br>
This was done using a Sony XC77 monochrome video camera with<br>
a Cosmicar 16mm focal length lens positioned vertically<br>
above a black table illuminated from a high angle using<br>
fluorescent tubes to remove shadowing.  The apparatus was<br>
initially calibrated using a reference white card, after the<br>
fluorescent tubes had been turned on for long enough to give<br>
a steady light output.  A cloth or:,Carborundum paper with a<br>
deposit there'on from the previous test was placed on the<br>
table and the; camera was used to capture an image".	An" area<br><br>
30<br><br>
of the image<br><br>
of the deposit was selected and analysed using<br><br>
a Kontron IBXs™ image analyser.  This notionally divided the<br><br>

PCT/EP02/14525<br><br>
70   -<br>
image into a large array of pixels.and measured the grey level of each pixel on a scale of 0 (black) to 255 (white). The average of the grey intensity was calculated.  This was a measure of the whiteness of the deposit, with higher numbers indicating a whiter deposit.  It was assumed that low numbers show a clear deposit allowing the substrate<br><br>
colour to be<br><br>
seen.<br>
I<br><br>
iv     Clarity of formulation - Light transmission 10  The translucency of a composition may be. measured by placing a sample of standardised thickness in the light path of a spectrophotometer and measuring transmittance, as a percentage ofii light transmitted in the absence of the gel.<br><br>
15  This test was carried out using a dual-beam Perkin Elmer<br>
methacrylate) temperature o thickness of<br>
Lambda 4 0 spectrophotometer.  The sample of composition was poured hot into a 4.5 ml cuvette made of poly(methyl-(PMMA) and allowed to cool to an ambient f 20-25°C.  Such a cuyette gives a 1 cm<br>
20  thickness of composition.  Measurement was carried out at<br>
580 nm, with an identical but empty cuvette in the reference beam of the spectrophotometer, after the sample in the cuvette had been held for 24 hours.- A transmittance measured at any temperature in the range from 20-25°C is<br>
25  usually adequately accurate, but measurement is made at 22°C if more precision is required.<br><br>
