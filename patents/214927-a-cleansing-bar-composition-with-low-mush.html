COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10; rule 13)<br>
1. TITLE OF INVENTION<br>
A CLEANSING BAR COMPOSITION WITH LOW MUSH<br>
2. 	HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act. 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever house, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
14 MAR 2005<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to cleansing bars, and more particularly to cleansing bars having low mush. Synthetic detergent or syndet toilet-bars have found considerable use as mild cleansing bars but such bars have the potential to exhibit unacceptable mush levels. Furthermore, syndet melt cast formulations require a higher level of solubilizers and suspending or dispersing agents than extruded formulations to dissolve all the components of the formulation.  These solubilizers, such as fatty alcohols disadvantageously increase the mush level of the bar.<br>
THE RELATED ART<br>
USP 5,691,287 issued to Villars et al. on November 25, 1997 discloses a sodium cocoyl isethionate cleansing bar containing cetyl and stearyl alcohol in a total concentration range of about 6 to 11 wt percent.<br>
USP 5,372,751 issued to Rys-Cucciari et al. on December 13, 1994 discloses an acyl isethionate cleansing bar containing free fatty alcohols of 8-22. carbon atoms in an amount of 0-10 wt. percent.<br>
2<br><br>
USP 5,994,281 issued to He et al. on November 30, 1999 discloses an acyl isethionate cleansing bar containing fatty alcohols of 16 to 22 carbon atoms.<br>
PCT publication no. WO 95/02035 to Chambers et al., published on January 19, 1995 discloses a fatty acid soap bar with minor amounts of acyl isethionates and fatty alcohols of 16 to 22 carbon atoms.<br>
The above patents and publications however, fail to disclose or suggest a specific range of either alkyl alcohols of 6 to 12 carbon atoms or alkenyl alcohols of 6 to 18 carbon atoms in a cleansing bar composition which unexpectedly decreases mush, increases hardness, and has excellent lather; especially for syndet formulations.<br>

Conventional art recognised melt cast processing techniques may be used to fabricate the inventive toilet bar. For example, the melted components of the inventive bar are usually blended together at elevated temperatures. Optionally the water level may be adjusted and the blending will continue. Next an optional drying step may follow whereby the water is reduced.  Preferably the water level of the ingredients is selected to be low enough to avoid the drying process.  Finally, the molten cleansing composition is poured into molds and cooled to its hardening point.  The molds may be made of any rigid material that is not subject to attack by the ingredients of the toilet bar. Mold materials may include plastic, metal, glass, ceramic, composite, or elastomeric materials and the like.  Cooling the molten cleansing materials can be accomplished by art recognised cooling techniques including refrigeration, cryogenics, ambient air and the like.  Controlled cooling using thermostatic control cooling devices may also be employed.<br>
Conventional art recognised packaging materials may be used to package the inventive toilet bar.  The package may hold one or more separately packaged bars.  Shrink wrap,<br>
20 <br>
blister pack, and flow wrap packaging configuration may be used.  The package may also have an optional transparent area to view part or all of the bar contained therein.  Paper, plastic, or coated paper, or other flexible or rigid packaging materials that are compatible with the toilet bar may be used.  Single layer or laminated packaging material structures may also be used.  Preferably, the packaging •material is -moisture-proof, :.nd 'mold resistant. -The packaging material should have good barrier properties to prevent the loss of volatile cleansing composition ingredients such as perfume.  Examples, of useful barrier materials are polymer coated paper board or other appropriate materials.  Hot melt adhesive or contact adhesive such as glue may be used to adhere a portion of the carton and the wrapper. An appropriate coating would be a low density polyethylene coating and the like.<br>

Description of Test Methods; Evaluation of Mush:<br>
Immerse a weighed toilet bar in 250 ml water (at 25 C), in a beaker for four hours.  Scrape the mush from the bar with a soft plastic knife. Weigh the scraped bar after allowing to dry at room temperature 24 hours.  The weight change multiplied by 100 and divided by the initial weight of the bar denotes the mush of the bar.  Mush is calculated as the average of three bars.<br>
