Technical Field<br>
[0002]       This invention relates to polymer compositions and, more particularly, to polymer compositions comprising halogen-free polymers. The polymer compositions may be characterized by enhanced fire retardant properties. The polymer compositions may be in the form of latex compositions.<br>
Background<br>
[0003]       Latex compositions have been widely used in providing decorative or protective coatings as well as in providing binders or saturants for woven and non-woven substrates and paper substrates.   In order to provide latex compositions with flame retardant properties, it is common practice to incorporate halogen-containing monomers such as vinyl chloride into the latex resin. However, a problem with this practice is that when the resin burns, hydrochloric acid is released. This invention, in at least one embodiment, provides a solution to this problem.<br>
Summary<br>
[0004]       This invention relates to a composition, comprising: (A) at least one halogen-free polymer, the polymer exhibiting a total loss of mass of at least about 7% by weight at a temperature of 370°C when subjected to thermogravimetric analysis; (B) at least one acid source; (C) at least one carbon-yielding source; and (D) at least one blowing agent. This composition, in at least one embodiment, exhibits enhanced fire retardant properties. These compositions may be in the form of latex compositions and may be used as binders, coatings, and the like.<br>

[0027]       Polymerization of the monomers described above to form the polymer (A) may be conducted in an aqueous medium by charging a polymerization reactor with an appropriate amount of water, optionally one or more emulsifiers, and a sufficient amount<br>
of initiator to initiate polymerization. The polymerization reactor may be heated to the initiation temperature. An emulsified monomer premix may be added over a desired period of time, for example, several hours. The monomer premix may be prepared by mixing water, optionally one or more emulsifiers, one or more monomers, and optionally one or more polymerization modifiers. The rate of addition may be varied depending on the polymerization temperature, the particular initiator employed and the amount of monomer being polymerized. After the monomer premix has been added to the polymerization reactor, additional initiator may be added. The polymerization reactor may be heated and the reactor contents may be agitated for a desired period of time, for example, up to several hours, to achieve the desired conversion. Resulting coagulum, if any, may be separated from the polymer dispersion using filtration. The polymer dispersion may be referred to as a latex composition.<br>

[0029]       The latex composition may contain, in addition to the polymer (A), one or more emulsifiers, curing agents, fillers, plasticizers, antioxidants or stabilizers, antifoaming agents, dying adjuvants, pigments, as well as other known latex or paint additives. Thickeners or bodying agents may be added to the latex compositions to control the viscosity and thereby achieve the proper flow properties for the particular application desired. Each of these may be added at a concentration of up to about 15% by weight based on the weight of the solids in the latex composition. [0030]       In one embodiment, the polymer (A) may have a glass transition temperature (Tg) in the range from about -40°C to about 40°C, and in one embodiment from about -20°C to about 10°C. In one embodiment, the polymer may not have a specifically defined glass transition temperature.<br>
[0031]       In order for the inventive compositions to exhibit effective fire retardant properties, it is desirable for the polymer to exhibit certain thermal stability characteristics. These characteristics may relate to the loss of mass the polymer undergoes when it is burned. This loss of mass can be measured using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). With TGA, a sensitive balance is used to follow the weight of a sample as a function of temperature. The polymer (A) may exhibit a total loss of mass of at least about 5% by weight, and in one embodiment from about 5% to about 30% by weight, and in one embodiment from about 5% to about 60% by weight, at a temperature of 350°C when subjected to TGA. In one embodiment, the polymer (A) may exhibit a total loss of mass of at least about 6% by weight, and in one embodiment from about 6% by weight to about 35% by weight, and in one embodiment from about 6% by weight to about 70% by weight, at a temperature of 360°C when subjected to TGA. In one embodiment, the polymer (A) may exhibit a total loss of mass of at least about 7% by weight, and in one embodiment from about 7% by weight to about 40% by weight, and in one embodiment from about 7% to about 80% by weight, at a temperature of 370°C when subjected to TGA. In one embodiment, the polymer (A) may exhibit a total loss of mass of at least about 14% by weight, and in one embodiment from about 14% by weight to about 60% by weight, and in one embodiment from about 14% by weight to about 90% by weight, at a temperature of 390°C when subjected to TGA. In one embodiment, the polymer (A) may exhibit a total loss of mass of at least about 25% by weight, and in one embodiment from about 25% by weight to about 60% by weight, and in one embodiment from about 25% by weight to about 90% by weight, at a temperature of 400°C when subjected to TGA. In one embodiment, the polymer (A) may exhibit a total loss of mass of at least about 44% by weight, and in one embodiment from about 44% by weight to about 80% by weight, and in one embodiment from about 44% by weight to about 95% by weight, at a temperature of 410°C when subjected to TGA. These characteristics may contribute to the formation of a stable char when the inventive compositions are burned.<br>
[0032]       The following Example 1 discloses the preparation of a copolymer corresponding to the polymer (A) that is within the scope of the invention, and the<br>
following Example C-l discloses a copolymer that is not within the scope of the invention but is provided for purposes of comparison.<br>
Example 1<br>
[0033]       A monomer premix is prepared formed by adding water (270 g), 30% sodium lauryl sulfate solution (30 g) and a mixture of monomers (180 styrene, 418.2 g n-butyl acrylate, 3.6 g methyl ene-bis-acrylamide) to a premix vessel. The contents of the premix vessel are agitated. Water (324 g) and 30% sodium lauryl sulfate solution (1.1 g) are added to a polymerization reactor. Agitation in the polymerization reactor is commenced under a nitrogen purge. The temperature of the polymerization reactor is increased to the initiation temperature of 80°C. An initiator (3 g sodium persulfate) is added to the polymerization reactor. The monomer premix is added to the polymerization reactor at a rate of 4.3 g/min. An additional amount of initiator (0.18 g sodium persulfate in 50 g of water) is metered in over a period of 150 minutes. The reaction mixture is maintained in the polymerization reactor with agitation and at a temperature of 87°C for 285 minutes to allow the reaction to proceed. An additional amount of redox initiator may be added to complete the polymerization of the monomers and the reaction mixture may be maintained in the polymerization reactor with agitation for an additional period of time. The polymerization reactor is cooled, and the polymerization reactor contents are filtered and poured into a storage container.<br>
Example C-l<br>
[0034]       A monomer premix is formed by adding water (100 g), 30% sodium lauryl sulfate solution (6 g), itaconic acid (12 g), 48% N-methyol acrylamide (25 g), styrene (306 g), n-butyl acrylate (264 g) and acrylic acid (6 g) to a premix vessel. The contents of the premix vessel are agitated. Water (200 g) is added to a polymerization reactor. Agitation in the polymerization reactor is commenced under a nitrogen purge. The temperature of the polymerization reactor is increased to the initiation temperature of 87°C. An initiator (2.4 g sodium persulfate) is added to the polymerization reactor. The monomer premix is added to the polymerization reactor at a rate of 4.3 g/min. An<br>
additional amount of initiator (0.24 g sodium persulfate in 53 g of water) is added. The reaction mixture is maintained in the polymerization reactor with agitation and at a temperature of 87°C for 210 minutes to allow the reaction to proceed. An additional amount of initiator (0.18 g sodium persulfate in 50 g of water) is added and the reaction mixture is agitated for an additional 75 minutes. The polymerization reactor is cooled and the polymerization reactor contents are filtered and poured into a storage container. [0035]       TGA for the polymers produced in Examples 1 and C-l is determined using the following procedure. The samples for thermogravimetric analysis are tested on a TA instruments Model 2950HR (high resolution) Thermogravimetric Analyzer. Approximately 10 to 20 mg of each sample are weighed into a tarred aluminum TGA pan. The temperature is increased at a rate of 10°C per minute to a maximum temperature of 550°C. The samples are heated in a nitrogen atmosphere. Data is recorded using Thermal Advantage Software and analyzed with Universal Analysis 2000<br>
i<br>
software. The test is run in accordance with ASTM El 131 -98. The TGA results for these polymers are shown in Fig. 1 and are reproduced below in Table 1. In Table 1, the numerical values are for the loss of mass in weight percent at the indicated temperature.<br>

For example, monoammonium orthophosphate and urea may be thermally condensed to prepare a substantially water-insoluble ammonium polyphosphate by heat treating a melt formed from substantially equimolar quantities at a temperature of about 250°C for a period of about 3 hours. The acid source may be employed in the intumescent composition (that is, the combination of (B), (C) and (D)) at a concentration in the range from about 2% to about 90% by weight, and in one embodiment from about 5% to about<br>
90% by weight, and in one embodiment from about 10% to about 90% by weight, and in one embodiment from about 20% to about 85% by weight, and in one embodiment from about 40% to about 80% by weight based on the total weight of solids in the intumescent composition.<br>
[0038]       The carbon-yielding source (C) may comprise pentaerythritol, dipentaerythritol, tripentaerythritol, carbohydrated modified sugars, carbohydrated modified starches, water-dispersible proteins, gelatins, casein, derivatives of any of the foregoing, and mixtures of two or more thereof. The carbon-yielding source may be referred to as a carbonific source or a char-yielding source. The carbon-yielding source may be employed in the intumescent composition at a concentration from about 1 % to about 60% by weight, and in one embodiment from about 5% to about 60% by weight, and in one embodiment from about 10% to about 40% by weight based on the total solids in the intumescent composition.<br>
[0039]       The blowing agent (D) may comprise any material that generates an inert gas upon being heated at a temperature in the range from about 100°C to about 500°C, and in one embodiment from about 150°C to about 500°C, and in one embodiment from about 230°C to about 400°C. The blowing agent may comprise an organic amine or amide. The blowing agent may comprise melamine, melamine salts, urea, dicyandiamide, or a mixture of two or more thereof. The blowing agent may be used at a concentration from about 1% to about 60% by weight, and in one embodiment from about 5% to about 60% by weight, and in one embodiment from about 10% to about 40% by weight based on the weight of total solids in the intumescent composition.<br>
[0040]       In one embodiment, the softening temperature range of the polymer (A) may be synchronized with the temperature in which the intumescent composition (i.e., the combination of components (B), (C) and (D))5 decomposes, liberates non-combustible gases and foams, so that the polymer (A) in combination with the intumescent composition may form a matrix for trapping non-combustible gases and an intumescent layer for providing a barrier against fire and heat.<br>
[0041]       The following Example 2 discloses an intumescent composition within the scope of the invention.<br>
Example 2<br>
[0042]       An intumescent composition is prepared from the following formulation. This composition has a solids content of 71% by weight.<br>
Parts by Wt.<br>
Water	28<br>
Igepal CO-530 (non-ionic surfactant supplied	0.1<br>

Melamine	14.1<br>
Pentaerythritol	14.1<br>
Carbopol EP-1 (thickener supplied by Noveon	1.1<br>

FR Cross 84 (ammonium polyphosphate supplied	42.4<br>
by Budenheim)<br>
[0043]       The following Example 3 discloses the mixing of the polymers from Examples 1 and C-l with the intumescent compositions from Example 2 to form latex Samples I and C-I.<br>
Example 3<br>
[0044]       The intumescent composition from Example 2 is blended at a solids to solids weight ratio of 1:1 with the composition from Examples 1 and C-l to make latex Samples I and C-I. Each of the Samples I and C-I has a solids content of 45% by weight. For each of the Samples I and C-I, the intumescent composition from Example 3 is added while the samples are agitated. Sodium lauryl sulfate (1% by weight) is added as a<br><br>
surfactant to stabilize the resulting mixture. Water is added to each of the mixtures to provide a solids content for each mixture of 50% by weight.<br>
[0045]       The inventive latex composition, which comprises water and components (A), (B), (C) and (D), may be useful as binders, coatings, and the like. This composition may be characterized by enhanced flame retardant properties. The solids concentration of the latex composition may be in the range from about 20% to 80% by weight, and in one embodiment from about 25% to 75% by weight. The latex composition may be applied to any substrate using any technique including brushing, spraying, dipping, rolling, roll-transfer, foam coating, film coating, and the like. The substrate may comprise wood, plastic, metal, drywall, masonry, webs or mats of woven fibers, webs or mats of non-woven fibers, and the like. Application of the latex composition to the substrate may be made at any temperature that is consistent with the end-use application. In one embodiment, the latex composition may be applied to the substrate at room temperature. [0046]       In one embodiment, the inventive latex compositions may be used as binders for webs or mats of woven fibers, webs or mats of non-woven fibers, and the like. The fibers may be partially or completely oriented or they may be randomly distributed. The web or mat may be formed by carding when the fibers are of such a character, by virtue of length and flexabifity, as to be amenable to a carding operation. The fibers may comprise natural textile fibers such as cellulose, jute, sisal, ramie, hemp and cotton, as well as many of the synthetic organic textile fibers including rayon, those of cellulose esters such as cellulose acetate, vinyl resin fibers such as those of polyvinyl chloride and copolymers thereof, polyacrylonitrile and copolymers thereof, polyesters such as poly(ethylene terephthalate), polymers and copolymers of olefins such as ethylene and propylene, condensation polymers such as polyimides or nylon types, and the like. The fibers that may be used can be those of a single composition or mixtures of fibers in a given web. The inventive latex composition may be combined with cellulosic materials or blends of cellulosic materials. These include paper made from cellulosic fibers; nonwoven fabric made by bonding natural fibers, synthetic fibers, or a mixture of such natural and synthetic fibers; and woven fabrics. With paper substrates, the latex composition may contribute to the strength of the paper. With paper cloth products<br><br>
having a non-woven, randomly-oriented structure, the latex composition may serve as a binder to hold the structure together and provide strength. Examples of paper cloth products include high-strength, high absorbent materials such as disposable items, e.g., consumer and industrial wipes or towels, diapers, surgical packs and gowns, industrial work clothing and feminine hygiene products. The inventive latex composition may be used as a binder for durable products, such as carpet and rug backings, apparel interlinings, automotive components and home furnishings, and for civil engineering materials, such as road underlays. Non-woven substrates may be formed from fiberglass, polyester, rayon, carbon, and the like fibers. These non-woven substrates may be made by wet-laid processes or dry or air-laid processes. In each case, the latex composition may serve to bind the fibers together.<br>
[0047]       The proportion of the latex composition that may be applied to the fibers may be sufficient to provide from about 0.1% to about 200% by weight, and in one embodiment from about 3% to about 50% by weight of the polymer (A), based on the total weight of the polymer (A) and the fibers. After application of the latex composition to the substrate, the resulting coated, impregnated or saturated substrate may be dried either at room temperature or at an elevated temperature. The substrate may be subjected, either after completion of the drying or as the final step of the drying step, to a baking or curing step. In one embodiment, the baking or curing steps may be conducted at a temperature in the range from about 110°C to about 170°C for a period of about 0.5 to about 10 minutes.<br>
[0048]       When a web or mat of fibers to which the inventive latex composition has been applied is exposed to heat or fire, in at least one embodiment of the invention, the flame spread during the early stages of the resulting fire is reduced and a char forms during the latter stages of the fire. This provides the latex composition and the web or mat to which the latex composition has been applied with enhanced fire retardant characteristics.<br>
[0049] The inventive latex composition may be useful as a protective and/or decorative coating composition and when applied to a substrate may provide the substrate with flame retardant properties. These coating compositions may be applied to<br>
a substrate using any technique, for example, spraying, brushing, rolling, dipping, flowing, and the like. The substrate may be any substrate requiring coating with a flame retardant coating composition. These include substrates made of wood, plastic, metal, drywall, masonry, and the like. The inventive latex composition may be applied to the substrate at a coat weight in the range from about 0.1 to about 1000 grams per square meter, and in one embodiment from about 1 to about 200 grams per square meter. The coating of the inventive latex composition provides the substrate, in at least one embodiment, with a protective carbonaceous char layer exhibiting enhanced fire-retardant properties when the coating is exposed to heat and/or fire. [0050]       The following Example 4 discloses test results showing improved fire retardant properties for latex Sample I as compared to latex Sample C-I.<br>
Example 4<br>
[0051]       Each of the latex Samples I and C-I from Example 3 is cast in the form of a film having a thickness of 25 mils on a Mylar sheet, dried overnight at room temperature, and placed in an oven operated at a temperature of 50°C for one hour. The films are removed from the oven, placed on dry ice for 10 minutes and then peeled off the Mylar sheets. Each film is pressed on a 100% cotton sheet at a temperature of 50°C and a pressure of 100 pounds per square inch (psi) for 2 minutes. The resulting fabric samples are cured for 3 minutes at 300°F (148.9°C), cut into squares (3x3 inch), and placed on a holder one inch above a ceramic radiant heater having a surface temperature of 650°C. The film side of each fabric sample faces the radiant heater. The temperature of the non-film side of each fabric sample is measured using an IR gun over a period of 180 seconds. The results for each sample are plotted in Fig. 2. These results show fabric temperatures that are about 90°C less with Sample I as compared to Sample C-I. [0052]       While the invention has been explained in relation to its preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that various modifications thereof will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon reading the specification.
