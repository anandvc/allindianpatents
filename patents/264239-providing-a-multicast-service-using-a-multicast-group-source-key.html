				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates generally to the field of communications and more specifically to providing a multicast service using a multicast group-source key.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Multicasting allows content to be distributed to multiple devices of a communication network. To multicast packets to a multicast group, a single device may send copies of the packets to the members of the multicast group. Multicasting typically involves distributing packets using a group identifier that uniquely identifies the multicast group. In certain situations, however, the group identifier itself might not provide for effective multicast group identification. For example, a group identifier might not be sufficient in networks that have private or overlapping addresses. It is generally desirable to effectively distribute packets.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE<br>
In accordance with the present invention, disadvantages and problems associated with previous techniques for providing a multicast service may be reduced or eliminated.<br>
According to one embodiment of the present invention, providing a multicast service to a mobile node includes receiving a first request to join a multicast group from a first cell site. The first request requests that a first mobile node be permitted to join the multicast group. A first multicast source operable to provide content to the first mobile node is identified. The multicast group and the first multicast source are<br>
associated to yield a first group-source combination. A first key is assigned to the first group-source combination, and the first key is provided to the first cell site.<br>
Certain embodiments of the invention may provide one or more technical advantages. A technical advantage of one embodiment may be that a key is assigned to a combination of a multicast group and a multicast source, such as a multicast service provider. Assigning the key to the combination provides for distinguishing among multicast sources that provide content to the same multicast group. Distinguishing among the multicast sources may provide for more effective distribution of packets for private multicast services.<br>
Certain embodiments of the invention may include none, some, or all of the above technical advantages. One or more other technical advantages may be readily apparent to one skilled in the art from the figures, descriptions, and claims included herein.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
For a more complete understanding of the present invention and its features and advantages, reference is now made to the following description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
FIGURE 1 is a block diagram illustrating one embodiment of a system that provides multicast services;<br>
FIGURE 2 is a call flow diagram illustrating one embodiment of a method for setting up multicast services that may be used with the system of FIGURE 1; and<br>
FIGURE 3 is a flowchart illustrating one embodiment of a method for multicasting content that may be used with the system of FIGURE 1.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Embodiments of the present invention and its advantages are best understood by referring to FIGURES 1 through 3 of the drawings, like numerals being used for like and corresponding parts of the various drawings.<br>
FIGURE 1 is a block diagram illustrating one embodiment of a network system 10 that provides multicast services. System 10 assigns a key to a combination of a multicast group and a multicast source. Assigning the key to the combination provides for distinguishing among multicast sources that provide content to the same multicast group. Distinguishing among the multicast sources may provide for more effective distribution of packets for private multicast services.<br>
According to the illustrated embodiment, system 10 operates to provide services such as communication sessions to endpoints such as mobile node 20. A communication session may refer to an active communication between endpoints, measured from endpoint to endpoint. Information is communicated during a communication session. Information may refer to voice, data, text, audio, video, multimedia, control, signaling, other information, or any combination of the preceding. System 10 may communicate information in packets. A packet may comprise a bundle of data organized in a specific way for transmission, and a frame may comprise the payload of one or more packets organized in a specific way for transmission. A packet-based communication protocol such as Internet Protocol (IP) may be used to communicate the packets.<br>
System 10 may utilize communication protocols and technologies to provide the communication sessions. Example communication protocols and technologies include those set by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics<br>
Engineers, Inc. (IEEE) 802.xx standards such as 802.11 and 802.16 standards, International Telecommunications Union (ITU-T) standards, European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) standards, Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standards, or other standards. According to one embodiment, system 10 may operate according to the WiMAX protocols, also known as the IEEE 802.16 standards. The WiMAX protocols specify fixed and mobile point-to-multipoint and multipoint-to-multipoint communication for broadband wireless systems.<br>
According to the embodiment, system 10 is operable to multicast packets to a multicast group comprising devices of system 10. Multicasting may refer to the communication of packets from a single device to multiple member devices of a multicast group. The single device may send copies of packets to the member devices of the multicast group. A multicast group may refer to a set of devices to which packets are multicast. A multicast group may be represented by, for example, identifiers, such as addresses, of the members of the multicast group. A multicast group may have a group identifier that uniquely identifies the multicast group. IP multicast procedures use Class D Internet addresses.<br>
According to the illustrated embodiment, system 10 includes one or more mobile nodes 20, one or more cell sites 24, a communication network 26, a gateway 28, and one or more source networks 32 coupled as shown. Mobile node 20 represents any suitable device operable to communicate with a communication system. In general, a device may include any suitable arrangement of components and logic operable to perform the operations of the device. "Logic" may refer to hardware, software, other logic, or any suitable combination of the preceding. Mobile node 20 may comprise, for example, a personal<br>
digital assistant, a computer such as a laptop, a cellular telephone, a mobile handset, or any other device operable to communicate with system 10.<br>
Cell site 24 represents any suitable device that provides wireless services to mobile node 20 present in, or visiting, a cell. For example, cell site 24 may represent an access point, a base station, a router, or any combination of the preceding. An access point may refer to a network point that couples a wireless network, such as a wireless radio network, to a wired network, such as a wired area network. A cell may refer to a geographic unit of a network attachment point of a communication network. As an example, a cell may refer to a cell of a cellular network or a hot spot of a wireless network. A mobile node 20 may be present in, or visiting, a cell if mobile node 20 is within the range of cell site 24 of the cell.<br>
A cell site 24 may comprise any suitable logic operable to provide wireless services to mobile nodes 20 present in a cell. According to one embodiment, cell site 24 includes a base transceiver station and a base station controller. The base transceiver station communicates signals to and from mobile node 20 through a wireless link that is typically a radio frequency link. The base station controller manages the operation of the base transceiver station.<br>
Network 26 represents a communication network that allows devices such as mobile node 20 to communicate with other devices. A communication network may comprise all or a portion of a public switched telephone network (PSTN), a public or private data network, a local area network (LAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), a wide area network (WAN), a local, regional, or global communication or computer network such as the Internet, a<br>
wireline or wireless network, an enterprise intranet, other suitable communication link, or any combination of the preceding.<br>
Gateway 28 represents any suitable device operable to multicast packets to members of a multicast group. According to the illustrated embodiment, gateway 28 multicasts packets to cell sites 24. To multicast the packets, gateway 28 maintains a list of the members of the multicast group. The list may include identifiers, such as addresses, of the members.<br>
Gateway 28 also assigns a key to each group-source combination. A key may refer to any suitable identifier that uniquely identifies a group-source combination. As an example, a key may comprise a tag or other value. A group-source combination may refer to the combination of a multicast group and a multicast source operable to provide content to the multicast group. Accordingly, a combination of a group and a first source would be assigned a different key than a combination of the group and a second source. Moreover, the same key is provided for members of the same group serviced by the same source, regardless of whether the same or different cell sites 24 that are servicing the members. A key may make the multicast interaction between gateway 28 and cell site 24 independent of the multicast addressing.<br>
TABLE 1 illustrates example groups and keys for group-source combinations.<br>
TABLE 1<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
TABLE 1 lists group GI with members inn, nu2/ mi3, and and group G2 with members m2i and n\22- Members may be serviced by any suitable combination of cell sites 24. Source Si provides content to members mn, mi2, m2i and m22, and source S2 provides content to members mi 3 and mi4. Key KI is assigned to the combination GI-SI, key K2 is assigned to the combination 61-82, and key KS is assigned to the combination 62-81. Members associated with the same group-source combination are assigned the same key, regardless of whether they are serviced by the same or different cell sites 24.<br>
Gateway 28 may provide other suitable operations. For example, gateway 28 may convert communications between different communication protocols. For example, gateway 28 may convert communications from a protocol used by network 32 to a different protocol, or vice-versa .<br>
Source network 32 represents a communication network that includes a multicast source 34. Multicast source 34 may refer to a server that provides content to be distributed to a multicast group. As an example, source network 32 may comprise a core server network operated by a service provider. According to one embodiment, different source networks 32 may use private addresses for each multicast group. Accordingly, a source network 32 may refer to a domain that uses different addresses<br>
for a multicast group than the addresses used by another source network 32.<br>
System 10 may include other suitable components operable to facilitate communications sessions. As an example, system 10 may include a home agent and a foreign agent. A home agent of a mobile node 20 may refer to an agent that maintains the address of mobile node 20 and forwards packets to mobile node 20. A foreign agent of mobile node 20 may refer to an agent that provides the home agent of mobile node 20 with an address to which packets for mobile node 20 may be forwarded.<br>
As another example, system 10 may include an authorization server. An authorization server may represent any suitable device operable to provide authorization-related services. Authorization-related services may include services for authentication, authorization, accounting, or any suitable combination of the preceding. Authentication may refer to validating the identity of mobile node 20. Authorization may refer to authorizing a level of service for mobile node 20. Accounting may refer to tracking the usage of resources. As an example, an authorization server may provide one, two, or three of the listed services.<br>
A component of system 10 may include logic, an interface, memory, other component, or any suitable combination of the preceding. Certain logic may manage the operation of a device, and may comprise, for example, a processor. "Processor" may refer to any suitable device operable to execute instructions and manipulate data to perform operations. "Interface" may refer to logic of a device operable to receive input for the device, send output from the device, perform suitable processing of the input or output or both, or any<br>
combination of the preceding, and may comprise one or more ports, conversion software, or both.<br>
"Memory" may refer to logic operable to store and facilitate retrieval of information, and may comprise Random Access Memory (RAM), Read Only Memory (ROM), a magnetic drive, a disk drive, a Compact Disk (CD) drive, a Digital Video Disk (DVD) drive, removable media storage, any other suitable data storage medium, or a combination of any of the preceding.<br>
Modifications, additions, or omissions may be made to system 10 without departing from the scope of the invention. The components of system 10 may be integrated or separated according to particular needs. Moreover, the operations of system 10 may be performed by more, fewer, or other modules. Additionally, operations of system 10 may be performed using any suitable logic. As used in this document, "each" refers to each member of a set or each member of a subset of a set.<br>
FIGURE 2 is a call flow diagram illustrating one embodiment of a method for setting up multicast services that may be used with system 10 of FIGURE 1. For purposes of illustration, the method is described using TABLE 1. Any suitable data structure, however, may be used. The method begins at step 110, where mobile node mn 20 sends a join request to cell site 24. A join request may refer to a message that may be used to request access to content distributed to a multicast group. The join request may include a group identifier GI for multicast group GI . Cell site 24 forwards the join request to gateway 28 at step 112.<br>
Gateway 28 joins mobile node mn 20 to the requested multicast group GI at step 114. Gateway 28 may perform any suitable procedure for joining mobile node mn 20 to multicast group GI. As an example, gateway 28 may first<br>
establish whether mobile node mu 20 is authorized to join multicast group GI. An authorization server may facilitate the authorization process. If mobile node mu 20 is authorized, gateway 28 may then add an identifier mu for mobile node mu 20 to the multicast group list for multicast group GI.<br>
Gateway 28 establishes a multicast source Si designated to provide the multicast content to mobile node mu 20 at step 116. Gateway 28 assigns a key KI to the group Gi-source Si combination of mobile node mu 20 at step 118. Gateway 28 sends a join response to cell site 24 at step 120. A join response may refer to a message that indicates whether a mobile node can join the requested multicast group. The join response may include the assigned key KI. The assigned key, however, may be provided to cell site 24 in any suitable message. Cell site 24 associates key KI with mobile node mu 20 at step 122. The key may be used to establish a tunnel between gateway 28 and cell site 24. Cell site 24 forwards the join response to mobile node mu 20 at step 124.<br>
Mobile node mis 20 sends a join request to cell site 24 at step 126. The join request may include a group identifier GI for multicast group GI . Cell site 24 forwards the join request to gateway 28 at step 128. Gateway 28 joins mobile node mis 20 to the requested user group GI at step 130. Gateway 28 establishes a multicast source S2 designated to provide the multicast content to mobile node mi3 20 at step 132. Gateway 28 assigns a key K2 to the group Gi-source Si combination of mobile node mi3 20 at step 134. Gateway 28 sends a join response to cell site 24 at step 136. Cell site 24 associates key K2 with mobile node mn 20 at step 138, and forwards the join response to mobile node mis 20 at step 140. After forwarding the response, the message terminates.<br>
Modifications, additions, or omissions may be made to the method without departing from the scope of the invention. The method may include more, fewer, or other steps. Additionally, steps may be performed in any suitable order without departing from the scope of the invention.<br>
FIGURE 3 is a flowchart illustrating one embodiment of a method for multicasting content to mobile nodes 20 that may be used with system 10 of FIGURE 1. For purposes of illustration, the method is described using TABLE 1. Any suitable data structure, however, may be used.<br>
Multicast source Si 32 sends a packet PI for multicast group GI to gateway 28 at step 150. Packet PI includes identifiers for multicast group GI and multicast source Si 32. As an example, packet PI may include a destination address that corresponds to identifier GI of multicast group GI, and may include a source address that corresponds to multicast source Si 32. Gateway 28 identifies key KI as associated with multicast group GI and multicast source Si 32 and inserts key KI into packet PI at step 152.<br>
Multicast source S2 32 sends a packet P2 for multicast group GI to gateway 28 at step 154. Packet P2 includes identifiers for multicast group GI and multicast source S2 32. Gateway identifiers key K2 as associated with multicast group GI and multicast source S2 32, and inserts key K2 into packet P2 at step 156.<br>
Gateway 28 sends packet PI to cell site 24 at step 162. Cell site 24 identifies mobile node mn 20 as associated with key KI at step 166. Gateway 28 sends packet P2 to cell site 24 at step 170. Cell site 24 identifies mobile node mi3 20 as associated with key K2 at step 174. Cell site 24 forwards packet PI to mobile node 20 at step 178. Cell site 24 forwards packet P2 to<br>
mobile node m13 20 at step 182.   After forwarding the packet, the method terminates.<br>
Modifications, additions, or omissions may be made to the method without departing from the scope of the invention. The method may include more, fewer, or other steps. Additionally, steps may be performed in any suitable order without departing from the scope of the invention.<br>
Certain embodiments of the invention may provide one or more technical advantages. A technical advantage of one embodiment may be that a key is assigned to a combination of a multicast group and a multicast source. Assigning the key to the combination provides for distinguishing among multicast sources that provide content to the same multicast group. Distinguishing among the multicast sources may provide for more effective distribution of packets for private multicast services.<br>
