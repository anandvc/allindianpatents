A METHOD OF PRODUCING A CELL PERMEABLE OSTEOINDUCTIVE POLYPEPTIDE^ -A<br>
This application claims the benefit of United States provisional application<br>
number 60/456,551, filed March 24,2003.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to osteoinductive proteins and<br>
methods for the delivery of those proteins into cells. More specifically, the invention<br>
relates to osteoinductive proteins such as LIM mineralization proteins (LMPs), bone<br>
morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and Smad proteins, conjugates of such<br>
osteoinductive proteins with protein transduction domains (PTDs), conjugates of<br>
PTDs and nucleic acids comprising nucleotide sequences encoding osteoinductive<br>
proteins, and to the transduction of these conjugates into cells. Furthermore, the<br>
invention relates to the use of PTD/osteoinductive protein conjugates to promote<br>
bone growth and disc regeneration.<br>
Background<br>
Tissue regeneration is an important component of the healing process<br>
subsequent to disease, trauma, or surgery. In situations where disease or trauma<br>
produces bone defect, for example, or where a surgical procedure such as insertion of<br>
an autograft or allograft, bone bridge, or bone fusion is used to correct a bone defect,<br>
bone regeneration is a central goal of recovery. It is not, however, a goal that is<br>
always or easily achieved and much research has been devoted to newer and more<br>
effective ways to promote tissue repair and regeneration.<br>
Elimination of joint motion by creation of a bone bridge is a common<br>
orthopedic' strategy for the treatment of degenerative spine and joint disorders.<br>
Failure of spine fusion can occur in as many as forty-five percent of the patients who<br>
mdergo the procedure, leaving them with continued pain, repeated surgeries,<br>
medical costs, and overall therapeutic failure.<br>
Intracellular and extracellular osteoinductive proteins promote bone growth<br>
and repair and constitute potential targets for therapeutic use. Such proteins include<br>
the bone morphogenetic proteins and the LIM mineralization proteins. BMPs have<br>
been shown to stimulate bone growth in vivo and LMPs, particularly LMP-1 and<br>
LMP-3, have a more upstream effect on osteoinduction, as evidenced by the fact that<br>
inhibition of LMP-1 expression blocks nodule formation that would normally be<br>
stimulated by glucocorticoids or BMP-6. Since they are considered "extracellular"<br>
proteins, acting via interaction with cell surface receptors, very high doses of bone<br>
morphogenetic proteins are required to achieve consistent effects in humans. Since<br>
the manufacturing costs of BMPs is generally high, this can mean that the cost of<br>
therapy is prohibitive. Therefore, although BMPs have demonstrated efficacy and<br>
are a viable therapeutic aid to osteoinduction, it would be beneficial to develop an<br>
alternate therapy that might be more cost-effective and possibly even more<br>
therapeutically effective.<br>
Delivery of LMPs to the intracellular environment provides an attractive<br>
therapeutic regimen. This can be accomplished by transfection of cells with plasmids<br>
comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a LIM mineralization protein, or can be<br>
done by infection of target cells with a viral vector carrying the nucleotide sequence<br>
of LMP. Each of these techniques has limitations, however. Plasmid transfection<br>
generally requires that cells be isolated for transfection and then implanted after<br>
transfection.   Viral delivery generally requires that the appropriate receptor be<br>
located on the surface of the target cell in order to facilitate viral entry into the cell.<br>
There is tremendous potential for the use of osteoinductive proteins and<br>
peptides, particularly for the use of those proteins and peptides that act via an<br>
intracellular mechanism. What is needed is a method of delivery of effective<br>
intracellular osteoinductive proteins and peptides into cells.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>

Detailed Description<br>
The inventors have discovered that a fusion protein comprising a protein<br>
transduction polypeptide and an osteoinductive polypeptide can be effectively used<br>
to promote bone development and intervertebral disc regeneration in vivo. The<br>
invention therefore provides osteoinductive polypeptides for intracellular delivery,<br>
polynucleotides encoding such osteoinductive polypeptides and protein transduction<br>
sequences, and methods of utilizing these fusion proteins to promote bone<br>
development and intervertebral disc regeneration in vivo.<br>
Previous work has demonstrated that LIM mineralization protein splice<br>
variants 1 and 3 (LMP-1 and LMP-3) are osteoinductive, while LMP-2 does not<br>
appear to have such osteoinductive potential.    A forty amino acid sequence<br>
corresponding to amino acids 94-133 of the amino acid sequence of human LMP-1<br>
(hLMP-1) is common to both LMP-1 and LMP-3. The inventors therefore surmised<br>
that this unique region of the proteins might, in itself, have osteoinductive potential.<br>
Peptides comprising overlapping segments of this sequence were designed and used<br>
to test the inventors' hypothesis. Their results indicate that peptides derived from<br>
LMP-1 and LMP-3 have osteoinductive potential. When used in vivo, these peptides<br>
demonstrated the ability to induce bone formation. Fig. 6 indicates peptides which<br>
have demonstrated osteoinductive functionality when introduced into cells as part of<br>
the fusion protein of the present invention in the method of the present invention.<br>
Implantation of cells expressing LMP-1 into the thoracic or lumbar spine has<br>
been shown by the inventors to produce solid spine fusion in athymic rats. Results<br>
herein disclosed demonstrate that LMP-1 and LMP-3 peptides such as those<br>
provided by SEQ ID NO 1, SEQ ID NO 2, SEQ ID NO 3, SEQ ID NO 4, SEQ ID NO 5,<br>
SEQ ID NO 6, SEQ ID NO 7, and SEQ ID NO 8 also provide the osteoinductive<br>
benefit that has been demonstrated for LMP-1.<br>
Bone morphogenetic proteins are generally required in very high doses to<br>
achieve consistent effects in humans. LMP-1 intracellular delivery by means of a<br>
PTD fusion protein, as described herein, provide a more cost-effective therapeutic<br>
option. Furthermore, results to date indicate that LMP-1, and LMP-related<br>
osteoinductive peptides, act within the cell to induce a cascade of factors to active the<br>
natural osteoinductive pathway.<br>
Protein transduction polypeptides facilitate the uptake and subsequent<br>
expression of nucleic acid sequences or therapeutic proteins. In the literature, they<br>
may be referred to alternately, and often interchangeably, as cell-permeable peptides,<br>
protein transduction domains, membrane transport sequences, and membrane-<br>
translocating peptides. They function to transport an attached peptide, polypeptide,<br>
or protein through the cell membrane into the interior of the cell in a receptor-<br>
independent manner. A fusion protein utilizing a protein transduction domain can<br>
comprise one or more peptides, polypeptides, or proteins operably linked to the<br>
protein transduction domain. In the present invention, such a fusion protein can<br>
comprise a protein transduction domain and at least one osteoinductive peptide,<br>
polypeptide, or protein, or combinations thereof. These peptides can be used to<br>
transduce autologous, allogeneic, or xenogeneic cells or tissues of ectodermal,<br>
mesenchymal, or hematopoetic origin and infuse or implant them into the recipient<br>
to induce or contribute to the formation of new tissue. In the method of the present<br>
invention, such polypeptides facilitate the uptake of proteins that can induce cells<br>
such as, for example, multipotent progenitor (stem) cells, to produce, for example,<br>
BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-6, BMP-7, BMP-9, BMP-12, BMP-13, aggrecan, collagen type I,<br>
collagen type II, versican, lumican, fibromodulin, biglycan, and decorin. Effective<br>
amounts of polypeptides of the present invention are indicated in the experimental<br>
design and results disclosed herein, but may also be determined by one of skill in the<br>
art based upon the disclosure of effective amounts provided herein.<br>
Human LIM mineralization protein-1 (hLMP-1), one of a family of LMP<br>
proteins, is an intracellular regulatory protein that can enhance the efficacy of bone<br>
mineralization in vitro and in vivo. Human LMP-1 is so named because it possesses<br>
a characteristic structural motif composed of two special zinc fingers that are joined<br>
by an amino acid spacer. LIM mineralization protein splice variants and their uses<br>
have been described by the inventors in U.S. patents numbers 6,300,127; 6,444,803;<br>
and 6,521,750. The sequences of LMP-1, LMP-2, and LMP-3 have also been<br>
disclosed in those patents. On Jul. 22, 1997, a sample of 10-4/RLMP (Rattus<br>
norvegicus LIM mineralization protein cDNA) in a vector designated pCMV2/RLMP<br>
(which is vector pRc/CMV2 with insert 10-4 clone/RLMP) was deposited with the<br>
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), 12301 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, Md.<br>
20852, and was assigned accession number 209153. On Mar. 19,1998, a sample of<br>
the vector pHis-A with insert HLPM-1s (Homo sapiens LIM mineralization protein<br>
cDNA) was deposited at the American Type Culture Collection and assigned<br>
accession number 209698.<br>
A serotype 5 adenovirus (Ads) has been employed for the delivery of LMPs to<br>
a variety of cells and tissues including cells derived from peripheral blood and bone<br>
marrow. fBoden. et al.. "Adenoviral Delivery of LMP-1 Induces Consistent Spine<br>
Fusion", 47th Annual Meeting, Orthopaedic Research Society, San Francisco,<br>
California (2001)). However, the Ad5 virus utilizes a specific receptor (i.e., coxsackie<br>
adenovirus receptor or CAR), which is absent, or present in limited quantities, in<br>
these cells. Protein transduction across the cell membrane to facilitate intracellular<br>
delivery of proteins without receptor-mediated mechanisms offers an attractive<br>
alternative to allow treatment of a variety of cell and tissue types.<br>
The actions of LMPs and other osteoinductive proteins indicate that they have<br>
therapeutic potential in a variety of tissues, such as brain, spinal cord, peripheral<br>
nerve, bone, cartilage, intervertebral discs, connective tissue, tendons, and ligaments.<br>
Delivery of LMPs, for example, to a variety of tissues can be accomplished by delivery<br>
systems comprising, for example, collagen, collagen ceramic combinations,<br>
demineralized bone matrix, natural or synthetic polymers such as elastin, fibrin,<br>
polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, polycaprolactone, polypropylene fumarate,<br>
polyvinyl alcohol, polyesters, polyethers, polyhydroxyls, and structural implants.<br>
Such matrices may be injectable, moldable, solid implants, structural implants, or<br>
combinations thereof.<br>
The present inventors have discovered that PTDs can be used to deliver<br>
functional osteoinductive proteins into cells and to effectively induce osteogenesis<br>
and proteoglycan synthesis. Such cell-permeable peptide import (CPPI) provides a<br>
method for delivering osteoinductive proteins into a variety of cell types. An 11<br>
amino acid peptide, initially derived from the HIV-1 TAT protein, was successfully<br>
used to deliver osteoinductive proteins into cells. The TAT peptide can be over-<br>
expressed in bacterial cells using the pTAT-HA vector. A recombinant human gene<br>
can be inserted into this vector in such a manner as to produce a fusion protein<br>
containing both the TAT peptide sequence as well as the gene product of interest.<br>
Furthermore, the PTD/osteoinductive polypeptide can be expressed in conjunction<br>
with a polyHis tag in order to facilitate isolation and purification of the fusion<br>
protein. The pTAT-HA vector and a purification protocol for TAT fusion proteins<br>
have been described previously by Nagahara, et al. f Nature Medicine. Vol. 4, p. 1449-<br>
1452, December 1998).<br>
A peptide sequence as found in a variety of PTDs can facilitate entry into cells<br>
in a coxsackie-adenovirus receptor (CAR)-1ndependent manner, thereby improving<br>
transduction efficiencies to target cells and subsequently lowering the required<br>
amounts of nucleic acid or protein needed to achieve the desired effect. PTD fusion<br>
proteins therefore provide a therapeutic tool that may be used to reduce the cost of<br>
therapy.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, a fusion protein of a protein<br>
transduction domain and an osteoinductive protein is provided. Osteoinductive<br>
proteins include, but are not limited to, LIM mineralization proteins (LMPs), bone<br>
morphogenetic proteins (BMP) and Smad proteins. As used herein, "osteoinductive<br>
proteins," "osteoinductive polypeptides," and "osteoinductive peptides" may be used<br>
interchangeably to refer to either a peptide or polypeptide of varying length or a full-<br>
length protein with osteoinductive functionality.<br>
A fusion protein comprising a PTD and a LIM mineralization protein is<br>
provided as one embodiment of the invention. The fusion protein can comprise a<br>
PTD and one or more LIM mineralization proteins or polypeptides. Useful LIM<br>
mineralization proteins include, for example, LMPs as disclosed in U. S. Patents<br>
numbers 6,300,127; 6,444,803; and 6,521,750; as well as pending U.S. Patent<br>
Application Serial No. 09/959,578, filed April 28, 2000. Preferably, the LMP is<br>
RLMP, HLMP-1, HLMP-1s, HLMP-2, HLMP-3, or a peptide derived therefrom.<br>
These peptides can include, for example, SEQ ID NO 1, SEQ ID NO 2, SEQ ID NO 3,<br>
SEQ ID NO 4, SEQ ID NO 5, SEQ ID NO 6, SEQ ID NO 7, or a polypeptide as in SEQ<br>
ID NO 8.<br>
The nucleotide sequence encoding the LIM mineralization protein preferably<br>
hybridizes under standard conditions to a nucleic acid molecule complementary to<br>
the full length of the following sequence:<br>
tcctcatccg ggtcttgcat gaactcggtg<br>
or hybridizes  under  highly  stringent  conditions  to  a  nucleic  acid  molecule<br>
complementary to the full length of the following sequence:<br>
gcccccgccc gctgacagcg ccccgcaa,<br>
or both.<br>
"Standard hybridization conditions" will vary with the size of the probe, the<br>
background and the concentration of the nucleic acid reagents, as well as the type of<br>
hybridization (in situ, Southern blot, or hybrization of DNA-RNA hybrids (Northern<br>
blot)). The determination of "standard hybridization conditions" is within the level of<br>
skill in the art. Methods include, for example, those described in U.S. Patent<br>
5,580,775 (Fremeau, et al.), Southern, J. Mol. Biol., 98:503 (1975), Alwine, et al,<br>
Meth. Enzvmol.. 68:220 (1979), and Sambrook, et ah, Molecular Cloning: A<br>
Laboratory Manual. 2nd edition, Cold Spring Harbor Press, 7.19-7.50 (1989).<br>
One set of standard hybrization conditions involves pre-hybridizing a blot at<br>
42°C for 2 hours in 50% formamide, 5X SSPE (150 nM NaCl, 10 mM Na H2PO4 [pH<br>
7.4], 1 mM EDTA [pH 8.o])l 5X Denhardt's solution (2omg Ficoll, 2omg<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone and 20 mg BSA per 100 ml water), 10% dextran sulphate, 1%<br>
SDS and 100 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA. A 32p- labeled cDNA probe is added, and<br>
further hybridizing continued for 14 hours. Afterward, the blot is washed twice with<br>
2X SSPE, 0.1 % SDS for 20 minutes at 22°C, followed by a 1 hour wash at 65°C in<br>
O.IX SSPE, 0.1 %SDS. The blot is then dried and exposed to x-ray film for 5 days in<br>
the presence of an intensifying screen.<br>
Under "highly stringent conditions", a probe will hybridize to its target<br>
sequence if those two sequences are substantially identical. Techniques are known to<br>
those of skill in the art for determining the conditions under which only substantially<br>
identical sequences will hybridize while non-1dentical sequences will not.<br>
As used herein, the term "protein" is intended to include mimetics and the<br>
term "amino acid" is intended to include L-form, D-form, and modified amino acids.<br>
These substitutions may be made by one of skill in the art, using the known<br>
structural similarities between the molecules. The amino acid sequence is also<br>
intended to include any peptide or protein sequence that may include additional<br>
amino acids either N-terminal or C-terminal to the listed sequence, or both. The<br>
term "osteoinductive protein" is intended to include variants or biologically active<br>
fragments of the polypeptide, as well as full-length proteins.<br>
It is well known in the art that a single amino acid may be encoded by more<br>
than one nucleotide codon, and that the nucleotide sequence may be modified to<br>
produce an alternate nucleotide sequence that encodes the same peptide. Therefore,<br>
alternate embodiments of the present invention include alternate DNA sequences<br>
encoding peptides containing the amino acid sequences as previously described.<br>
DNA, sequences encoding peptides containing the claimed amino acid sequence<br>
include DNA sequences which encode any combination of the claimed sequence and<br>
other amino acids located N-terminal or C-terminal to the claimed amino acid<br>
sequence. It is to be understood that amino acid and nucleic acid sequences may<br>
include additional residues, particularly N- or C-terminal amino acids or 5" or 3'<br>
nucleotide sequences, and still be essentially as set forth in the sequences disclosed<br>
herein, as long as the sequence confers osteoinductive potential upon the expressed<br>
polypeptide or protein.<br>
Additional nucleic acid bases may be added either 5' or 3' to the nucleotide<br>
sequence encoding the osteoinductive polypeptide, and may be combined with other<br>
DNA sequences, such as promoters, polyadenylation signals, additional restriction<br>
enzyme sites, multiple cloning sites, other coding segments, and the like. Therefore,<br>
overall length of such a polynucleotide may vary considerably.<br>
It is to be understood that a "variant" of a polypeptide is not completely<br>
identical to the native protein. A variant of an osteoinductive polypeptide or protein,<br>
for example, can be obtained by altering the amino acid sequence by insertion,<br>
deletion or substitution of one or more amino acids. The amino acid sequence of the<br>
polypeptide or protein can be modified, for example, by substitution to create a<br>
polypeptide having substantially the same or improved qualities as compared to the<br>
native polypeptide. The substitution may be a conserved substitution. A "conserved<br>
substitution" is a substitution of an amino acid with another amino acid having a side<br>
chain that is similar in polar/nonpolar nature, charge, or size. The 20 essential<br>
amino acids can be grouped as those having nonpolar side chains (alanine, valine,<br>
leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, and tryptophan), uncharged polar side<br>
chains (methionine, glycine, serine, threonine, cystine, tyrosine, asparagine and<br>
glutamine), acidic side chains (aspartate and glutamate), and basic side chains<br>
Gysine, arginine, and histidine). Conserved substitutions might include, for example,<br>
Asp to Glu, Asn, or Gln; His to Lys, Arg or Phe; Asn to Gln, Asp or Glu; and Ser to<br>
Cys, Thr or Gly. Alanine, for example, is often used to make conserved substitutions.<br>
To those of skill in the art, variant polypeptides can be obtained by<br>
substituting a first amino acid for a second amino acid at one or more positions in<br>
the polypeptide structure in order to affect biological activity. Amino acid<br>
substitutions may, for example, induce conformational changes in a polypeptide that<br>
result in increased biological activity.<br>
Those of skill in the art may also make substitutions in the amino acid<br>
sequence based on the hydrophilicity index or hydropathic index of the amino acids.<br>
A variant amino acid molecule of the present invention, therefore, has less than one<br>
hundred percent, but at least about fifty percent, and preferably at least about eighty<br>
to about ninety percent amino acid sequence homology or identity to the amino acid<br>
sequence of a polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of LMP-1, LMP-2,<br>
LMP-3, SEQ ID NO l, SEQ ID NO 2, SEQ ID NO 3, SEQ ID NO 4, SEQ ID NO 5, SEQ<br>
ID NO 6, SEQ ID NO 7, or a polypeptide as in SEQ ID NO 8. Therefore, the amino<br>
acid sequence of the variant osteoinductive polypeptide or protein corresponds<br>
essentially to the native osteoinductive polypeptide or protein amino acid sequence.<br>
As used herein, "corresponds essentially to" refers to a polypeptide sequence that will<br>
elicit a similar biological and enzymatic activity to that generated by an<br>
osteoinductive polypeptide or protein comprising LMP-1, LMP-2, LMP-3, SEQ ID<br>
NO 1, SEQ ID NO 2, SEQ ID NO 3, SEQ ID NO 4, SEQ ID NO 5, SEQ ID NO 6, SEQ<br>
ID NO 7, or a polypeptide as in SEQ ID NO 8., such activity being at least about 70<br>
percent that of the native osteoinductive protein, and more preferably greater than<br>
100 percent of the activity of the native osteoinductive protein.<br>
A variant of the osteoinductive protein may include amino acid residues not<br>
present in a corresponding osteoinductive protein comprising LMP-1, LMP-2, LMP-<br>
3, SEQ ID NO l, SEQ ID NO 2, SEQ ID NO 3, SEQ ID NO 4, SEQ ID NO 5, SEQ ID<br>
NO 6, SEQ ID NO 7, or SEQ ID NO 8, or may include deletions relative to the<br>
osteoinductive protein comprising LMP-1, LMP-2, LMP-3, SEQ ID NO l, SEQ ID NO<br>
2, SEQ ID NO 3, SEQ ID NO 4, SEQ ID NO 5, SEQ ID NO 6, SEQ ID NO 7, or SEQ ID<br>
NO 8. A variant may also be a truncated "fragment," as compared to the<br>
corresponding protein comprising LMP-1, LMP-2, LMP-3, SEQ ID NO l, SEQ ID NO<br>
2, SEQ ID NO 3, SEQ ID NO 4, SEQ ID NO 5, SEQ ID NO 6, SEQ ID NO 7, or SEQ ID<br>
NO 8., the fragment being only a portion of the full-length protein or polypeptide.<br>
Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are members of the TGF-p superfamily<br>
of proteins. BMPs have been shown to induce ectopic bone or cartilage formation.<br>
According to the invention, a fusion protein of a PTD and a bone morphogenetic<br>
protein is also provided. BMPs include, for example, BMP-2, BMP-3, BMP-3b, BMP-<br>
4,  BMP-5, BMP-6, BMP-7, BMP-8, BMP-9, BMP-10, BMP-11, BMP-12, BMP-13,<br>
BMP-14, BMP-15, GDF-1, GDF-3, GDF-8 and GDF-9. Bone morphogenetic proteins<br>
BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-5, BMP-6, BMP-7, BMP-8, or BMP-9 can be especially useful<br>
in the method of the present invention.<br>
Smad proteins are intracellular proteins that mediate signaling from receptors<br>
for extracellular TGF-beta-related factors (Heldin. et al, "TGF-b Signalling from Cell<br>
Membrane to Nucleus through SMAD Proteins", Nature. Vol. 390 (1997)). Smad<br>
proteins can be activated (i.e., phosphorylated) by the binding of a BMP to its<br>
receptor. Upon activation, the Smad proteins translocate to the nucleus where they<br>
regulate gene expression. A fusion protein of a PTD and a Smad protein is also<br>
provided in the present invention. Smad- 1, Smad-2, Smad-3, Smad-4, Smad-5,<br>
Smad-6, Smad-7 or Smad-8 can be especially useful for promoting osteoinduction<br>
when delivered as a fusion protein with a protein transduction domain as in the<br>
present invention.<br>
The protein transduction domain according to the invention can be any<br>
peptide, mimetic, or peptide nucleic acid (PNA) sequence that can traverse the<br>
plasma membrane of a cell to deliver an attached or accompanying protein, peptide,<br>
or nucleic acid to the interior of the cell. The inventors have demonstrated that<br>
osteoinductive proteins can be delivered intracellularly (as a fusion protein moiety,<br>
for example) without impairing their ability to promote osteoinduction and<br>
proteoglycan synthesis. PTDs include, for example, polypeptides derived from the<br>
Drosophila homeotic transcription factor Antennapedia (Antp), the herpes simplex<br>
virus (HSV) protein VP22, signal peptide sequences from growth factors such as<br>
Kaposi's fibroblast growth factor (K-FGF) (Lin, et al, J. Biol. Chem., Vol. 270, p.<br>
14255-14258, 1995) a membrane translocation sequence derived from the K-FGF<br>
signal peptide sequence (Rojas, et al, Nat. Biotech.. Vol. 16, p. 370-375, 1998), and<br>
the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 transcriptional activator TAT (Fawell, et<br>
al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. Vol. 91, p. 664-668,1994)- PTDs are disclosed in U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,652,122, and in Schwarze. et al, "Protein Transduction: Unrestricted<br>
Delivery into all Cells", Trends in Cell Biology. Vol. 10 (2000). The inventors have<br>
found the HIV-TAT PTD to be especially useful in the present invention.<br>
A nucleic acid comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a fusion protein<br>
operably linked to a promoter, wherein the fusion protein comprises a protein<br>
transduction domain (PTD) and an osteoinductive protein, is also provided. The<br>
nucleic acid can be part of a vector (e.g., an expression vector such as a plasmid).<br>
Osteoinductive proteins can include, for example, LIM mineralization proteins, bone<br>
morphogenetic proteins, Smad proteins, and osteoinductive peptides and<br>
polypeptides  derived  therefrom.     Examples  of osteoinductive  peptides   and<br>
polypeptides include SEQ ID NO 1, SEQ ID NO 2, SEQ ID NO 3, SEQ ID NO 4, SEQ<br>
ID NO 5, SEQ ID NO 6, SEQ ID NO 7, and SEQ ID NO 8.<br>
Methods of delivering osteoinductive proteins into cells are also provided by<br>
the present invention. In a method of the invention, at least one osteoinductive<br>
protein can be delivered into a cell via transduction wherein a fusion protein<br>
comprising a protein transduction domain (PTD) and an osteoinductive protein is<br>
contacted with the cell so that the fusion protein is delivered into the cell, the<br>
delivery being facilitated by the protein transduction domain or cell-permeable<br>
peptide<br>
The cells into which the osteoinductive proteins can be delivered include, for<br>
example, osseous (i.e., bone forming) and non-osseous cells. Such cells may include,<br>
for example, buffy coat cells, stem cells (e.g., mesenchymal stem cells, multipotent<br>
and pluripotent stem cells), intervertebral disc cells (e.g., cells of the annulus<br>
fibrosus and cells of the nucleus pulposus), mesenchymal cells, hematopoietic cells,<br>
endothelial cells and muscle cells. Stem cells can be derived from autalogous or<br>
allogeneic tissue.<br>
Cells transduced with or expressing a fusion protein of a protein transduction<br>
domain (PTD) and an osteoinductive protein are also provided. Such cells may<br>
include, but are not limited to, buffy coat cells, stem cells (e.g., mesenchymal stem<br>
cells and pluripotential stem cells), intervertebral disc cells (e.g., cells of the annulus<br>
fibrosus and cells of the nucleus pulposus), mesenchymal cells, hematopoietic cells,<br>
endothelial cells and muscle cells. Cells containing a fusion protein of a PTD and an<br>
osteoinductive protein as described herein can be implanted into the body of a<br>
mammal to induce bone formation. Methods of inducing bone formation using<br>
LMPs as osteoinductive proteins are described, for example, in U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,300,127. Cells comprising a fusion protein of a PTD and an osteoinductive protein<br>
may also be implanted into the intervertebral disc, for example, to stimulate<br>
proteoglycan and/or collagen synthesis as set forth in U.S. Patent Application No.<br>
10/292,951, filed November 13,2002, pending.<br>
A conjugate of a PTD and a nucleic acid comprising a nucleotide sequence<br>
encoding an osteoinductive protein is also provided. The PTD/nucleic acid conjugate<br>
can be used to direct over-expression of an osteoinductive protein to promote bone<br>
formation or disc regeneration, for example. Osteoinductive proteins encoded by the<br>
nucleotide sequence can include, but are not limited to, LMPs, BMPs, and Smad<br>
proteins. Methods for chemically linking peptides to nucleic acids are known in the<br>
art. One such method is described in U.S. Patent No. 5,652,122. The nucleic acid can<br>
be in the form of an expression vector comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding an<br>
osteoinductive protein operably linked to a promoter.<br>
Methods of the present invention can be used to induce the expression of one<br>
or more bone morphogenetic proteins or transforming growth factor-p proteins in a<br>
cell as described in copending U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 10/382,844, filed<br>
March 7, 2003. For example, the expression of one or more proteins selected from<br>
the group consisting of BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-6, BMP-7, TGF-B1 and combinations<br>
thereof can be induced by contacting a cell with a fusion protein comprising a PTD<br>
and an osteoinductive protein according to the invention. Additionally, cells which<br>
over-express one or more proteins selected from the group consisting of BMP-2,<br>
BMP4, BMP-6, BMP-7, TGF-S1 and combinations thereof are also provided<br>
according to the invention. The cell can be any somatic cell including, but not limited<br>
to, a stem cell, a buffy coat cell, a bone marrow cell, a peripheral blood cell or a fat<br>
cell. The cell can be a stem cell derived from autologous or allogeneic tissue.<br>
In the kidney, for example, cells may be stimulated to produce BMP-7 via<br>
administration of a PTD/LMP fusion polypeptide as described in the present<br>
invention, or stem cells may be treated with a PTD/LMP fusion polypeptide,<br>
inducing them to express BMP-7. Once transplanted into the kidney, their<br>
production of BMP-7 can provide a therapeutic benefit not previously available<br>
through administration of exogenous BMP-7. BMP-7 induces repair of severely<br>
damaged renal tubular epithelial cells, in association with reversal of chronic renal<br>
injury (Zeisberg, et al., Nat. Med. 9: 964-968, 2000). One complication of chronic<br>
kidney disease, adynamic bone disorder, has been reported to be successfully treated<br>
in mice by administration of BMP-7 (Lund, et al., J Am Soc Nephrol 15(2): 359-369,<br>
2004). In mouse genetic models of chronic renal injury and fibrosis, administration<br>
of exogenous human recombinant BMP-7 improved renal function and survival<br>
(Zeisberg, et al., Am J Phvsiol Renal Phvsiol 285(6): F1060-7, 2003). BMP-7 has<br>
also been shown to partially reverse diabetic-1nduced kidney hypertrophy (Wang, et<br>
al., Kidney Int 63(6): 2037-2049, 2003). Davies, et al, determined that BMP-7<br>
deficiency is a pathophysiologic factor in chronic renal failure (J Am Soc Nephrol<br>
14(6): 1559-1567&gt; 2003). These studies, in conjunction with the discovery by the<br>
inventors that LMP-1 induces BMP-7 production by the cell, and that LMP peptides<br>
(SEQ ID NO 1, SEQ ID NO 2, SEQ ID NO 3, SEQ ID NO 4, SEQ ID NO 5, SEQ ID NO<br>
6, SEQ ID NO 7, and SEQ ID NO 8) function in a similar fashion to LMP-1 protein,<br>
demonstrate that a fusion polypeptide comprising a protein transduction domain<br>
and an LMP-1 or LMP-3 protein or related peptide can be of benefit in the treatment<br>
of kidney disease. Stem cells induced to express BMP-7 by means of a fusion<br>
polypeptide of the present invention may be particularly useful for this purpose.<br>
BMP-4 and BMP-7 have also been shown to inhibit proliferation and induce<br>
apoptosis in human myeloma cells. Therapeutic use of BMP has been suggested for<br>
myeloma bone disease and myeloma cell growth. The method of the present<br>
invention provides a way to stimulate both BMP-4 and BMP-7 production in vivo by<br>
administering LMP-1, LMP-3, or peptides comprising SEQ ID NO l, SEQ ID NO 2,<br>
SEQ ID NO 3, SEQ ID NO 4, SEQ ID NO 5, SEQ ID NO 6, SEQ ID NO 7, and SEQ ID<br>
NO 8, by, for example, injection, an implant, or implantation of stem cells that have<br>
been treated with a PTD/LMP fusion polypeptide. A combination of a stem cell<br>
implant in conjunction with a source of PTD/LMP such as an implantable drug<br>
delivery device may be particularly effective.<br>
Stem cells, or multipotent progenitor cells, can provide a source of cells from<br>
which to generate osteoblasts. These cells may be isolated at various stages of<br>
differentiation and induced to differentiate in specific lineage pathways. The cells<br>
may be used to treat bone diseases such as osteoporosis or osteogenesis imperfecta,<br>
as well as non-healing fractures. Core binding factor alpha 1 (Cbfai) has been<br>
demonstrated to be necessary for osteogenesis. BMP-2, BMP-4, and BMP-7, which<br>
are known to induce osteoblast differentiation, up-regulate Cbfai expression. BMP-<br>
8 and Smad-3 are up-regulated during osteoblast differentiation. Activation of TGF-<br>
beta/BMP-Smad signaling has been shown to promote Cbfai expression, and<br>
osteoblast differentiation. The present invention provides fusion proteins<br>
comprising functional BMPs, LMPs, Smad proteins, or a combination thereof, for<br>
example, to promote osteoblast differentiation in cells such as human bone marrow-<br>
derived mesodermal progenitor cells. Suitable cells may include, for example,<br>
multipotent cells such as those described by Jiang, et al. fNature, Vol. 418, p. 41-49,<br>
2002). Administration of suitable osteoinductive proteins or polypeptides, or<br>
combinations thereof, can be performed ex vivo before implantation of the cells, or in<br>
vivo following implantation or injection.<br>
For in vivo administration, osteoinductive proteins of the present invention<br>
can be injected at a target site so that they can be delivered to the interior of nearby<br>
cells via a PTD or cell-permeable peptide, for example.   Alternately, an implant<br>
comprising a carrier in combination with a PTD/osteoinductive polypeptide may be<br>
used. Implants may contain reservoirs in which to place the PTD/osteoinductive<br>
polypeptide for release into the surrounding tissue, or may comprise a porous<br>
composition that has been soaked in a solution containing one or more<br>
PTD/osteoinductive polypeptide constructs. Hydrogels, time-release capsules or<br>
spheres, liposomes, microspheres, nanospheres, biodegradable polymers, or other<br>
such drug delivery systems may also be employed to deliver peptides and proteins of<br>
the present invention to target cells and tissues. U.S. Patent No. 6,475,516<br>
(DiCosmo, et al), for example, provides hydrogels loaded with liposomal therapeutic<br>
agents such as antibiotics, the hydrogels being covalently bonded to the surface of an<br>
in-dwelling medical device such as an implant.<br>
A hallmark of disc degeneration is the decreased production of proteoglycans<br>
in the disc, especially sulfated-glycosammoglycans (sGAG) and aggrecan. A decrease<br>
in the production rate of aggrecan, the major proteoglycan of the intervertebral disc,<br>
is an important factor in intervertebral disc degeneration. Because of the central role<br>
of proteoglycans in the function of the intervertebral disc, restoration of normal<br>
proteoglycan production of the intervertebral disc may be critically important in any<br>
biological treatment of intervertebral disc degeneration.<br>
The inventors performed experiments which demonstrated that LMP-1 over-<br>
expression or intracellular administration increases disc cell proteoglycan production<br>
in vitro and in vivo. LMP-1 over-expression induces the upregulation of BMP-2 and<br>
BMP-7 mRNA in vitro and in vivo. Noggin, which specifically inhibits these BMP-2<br>
and BMP-7, inhibits proteoglycan upregulation by AdLMP-1, indicating that LMP-1<br>
induced upregulation of proteoglycan is mediated by the upregulation of BMPs.<br>
LMP-1 administration via gene therapy or protein therapy (e.g., delivery by PTD<br>
conjugates) therefore can be used to stimulate proteoglycan production in discs and<br>
play a therapeutic role in disc regeneration.<br>
Cytokines such as TGF-B1, IGF-1, and EGF have been shown to stimulate<br>
intervertebral disc cell mitosis and, to some extent, proteoglycan production. Other<br>
cytokines such as BMP-2 and BMP-7 have also been shown to be effective in<br>
stimulating proteoglycan production. Because cytokines are small water soluble<br>
molecules, however, they rapidly diffuse away from the intervertebral disc or become<br>
inactivated by other regulatory factors. LIM Mineralization Protein-1 (LMP-1) is an<br>
intracellular regulatory molecule that is known to induce the secretion of multiple<br>
different BMPs from leukocytes and osteoblasts. By delivering LMP-1, LMP-2, LMP-<br>
3, or an osteoinductive peptide derived from LMP-1 or LMP-3, or a combination<br>
thereof, into the cell, particularly via a PTD/nucleic acid conjugate, BMP production<br>
can be stimulated from within the cells. Suitable osteoinductive peptides include, for<br>
example, SEQ ID NO 1, SEQ ID NO 2, SEQ ID NO 3, SEQ ID NO 4, SEQ ID NO 5,<br>
SEQ ID NO 6, SEQ ID NO 7, or a polypeptide as in SEQ ID NO 8.<br>
The present invention may be more fully understood by reference to the<br>
following non-limiting examples.<br>
Examples<br>
The synthesis and use of a (His)6 TAT-LMP protein conjugate, comprising the<br>
protein transduction domain of HIV-Tat and the LMP-1 protein, is described below.<br>
The pTAT-HA-vector was obtained under a material transfer agreement from<br>
Washington University (St. Louis, MO).<br>
An Ncol restriction site was added to the 5' end of hLMP-1 by utilizing<br>
PCDNA3.1/I1LMP-1 as the template for PCR with the following primers:<br>
Fwd: 5'-CCATGGAflCCflCAAAGTAGTGC-3'<br>
Rev: 5 -CAGGGCGGGCGGCTGGTAG-3'<br>
The reaction was performed at: 95°C for 2 Min.[95°C, 30 sec; 66°C, 30 sec; 72°C, 1<br>
mm] x 25, and 72°C 10 mm. The PCR product was cloned into PCRII-TOPO vector<br>
(Invitrogen) and appropriate clones were identified by sequencing.<br>
Construction of the (His)6 TAT-LMP vector was accomplished by restriction<br>
endonuclease digestion of plasmid clones with Ncol and Clal, and purification of the<br>
resulting product by agarose gel electrophoresis and electroelution. The full-length<br>
hLMP-1 sequence was isolated by restriction digest of the pCDNA3.1/hLMP-l vector<br>
with Clal and EcoRI, and purification of the resulting product by agarose gel<br>
electrophoresis and electroelution. The pTAT-HA-vector was also subjected to<br>
restriction digestion with Ncol and EcoRI, and the resulting linearized vector was<br>
purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and electroelution. Products were then ligated<br>
by standard procedures overnight at i6°C. Correctly ligated products (5' hLMP-1 + 3'<br>
hLMP-1 + linearized pTAT-HA-vector = (His)6 TAT-LMP vector) were determined by<br>
subsequent agarose gel electrophoreses and molecular weight determinations.<br>
Ligation products were transfected into BL21 (DE3) competent cells and<br>
suitable clones were identified by restriction analysis.<br>
Synthesizing and Harvesting the (His)6 TAT-LMP Protein<br>
Appropriate BL21 (DE3) Eschericia coli colonies containing positive clones of<br>
(His)6 TAT-LMP fusion constructs were grown to 0.8 OD (600 nm) and protein<br>
production was induced with 100 uM IPTG for 4h at 37°C. Induced cells were<br>
harvested by standard methods and lysed (20 raM P04 buffer, pH 7.2, 8 M urea, 100<br>
mM NaC1, 20 mM Imidazole) by sonicarion (4 x 20 s, each with 2 mm rest periods,<br>
4°C).<br>
The lysate was clarified by centrifugation (10000 x g) and the resulting<br>
supernatant applied to a Ni2+ sepharose affinity column (Invitrogen) under gravity<br>
flow conditions. The column was washed (20 mM PO4 buffer, pH 6.0,8 M Urea, 250<br>
mM NaCl, 20 mM Imidazole) and then bound proteins eluted (20 mM P04 buffer,<br>
pH 4.0,8 M Urea, 500 mM NaCI).<br>
Eluate was subjected to anion exchange chromatography (Hitrap Q HP, 5 mL,<br>
Pharmacia) using a linear gradient (Buffer A: 20 mM sodium carbonate, pH 11, 8 M<br>
Urea; Buffer B: 20mM sodium carbonate, pH 11, 8 M Urea, 2 M NaCl) from 0%<br>
Buffer B to 100% Buffer B (40 mm @ 5 mL/min). Eluted fractions (5 mL) were<br>
analyzed for the presence of hLMP-1 by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses.<br>
Fractions positive for hLMP-1 were subjected to hydrophobic interaction<br>
chromatography (Hitrap® Phenyl-sepharose, 5 mL, Pharmacia). Elution (Buffer A:<br>
2omM sodium carbonate, pH 10.5, 1.5 M ammonium sulfate; Buffer B: 2omM<br>
sodium carbonate, pH 10.5) was performed with a linear gradient of 0% to 100%<br>
Buffer B for 20 mm @ 5 mL/mm. Eluted fractions (5 mL) were analyzed for the<br>
presence of hLMP-1 by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses. Fractions positive for<br>
(His)6TAT-LMP fusion protein were lyophilized until used.<br>
Use of (His)6TAT-LMP Fusion Protein for de novo Bone Formation<br>
Lyophilized fractions (55 pg) were resuspended into 40 mM KOH to (Stock<br>
Solution; 1.0 uM). Human buffy coat cells were prepared as described in<br>
Viggeswarapu, et al., J. Bone Joint Surg.. Vol. 83(3), p. 364 (2001). These cells were<br>
mixed with 5 uL of(His)6 TAT-LMP fusion protein in alpha MEM (Gibco) and<br>
incubated for 30 min.@ 37°C.<br>
An appropriate volume of human buffy coat cells containing the (His)6 TAT-<br>
LMP fusion protein was then applied to a porous collagen matrix for implantation.<br>
To demonstrate de novo bone formation in vivo, 100 mL of cell suspension was<br>
applied via sterile pipette to a sterile 5 x 5 mm type I human collagen disc for<br>
implantation into rats. A similar quantity of cell suspension was applied to 10 x 25<br>
mm sheets for implantation to promote spine fusion. Discs were surgically<br>
implanted subcutaneously in the chest/abdomen of 4-5 week old athymic rats<br>
(rnu~/rnu"). The animals were sacrificed at 4 weeks, at which time discs were<br>
excised, fixed in 70% ethanol, and analyzed by radiography and undecalcified<br>
histologic examination (sectioned to 5 urn and stained with Goldner Trichrome).<br>
In rabbits, posterolateral lumbar spine arthrodesis was performed and carrier<br>
matrix was implanted (i.e., collagen sponge with 15% hydroxyapatite/85% tricalcium<br>
phosphate) with each side of the spine receiving 4 x 106 transduced buffy coat cells.<br>
After 4 weeks, rabbits were euthanized and their lumbar spines excised. The status of<br>
the spine fusion was assessed by blinded manual palpation of the motion segments to<br>
detect residual motion (indicative of failed fusion), radiographs, CT scans, and non-<br>
decalcified histology.<br>
In both rats and rabbits, radiography revealed a high level of mineralized bone<br>
formation conforming to the form of the original collagen discs or sheets containing<br>
LMP-1 transfected human buffy coat cells. No mineralized bone formation was<br>
observed in the control, and the original collagen discs or sheets appeared to be<br>
undergoing absorption. Histology revealed new bone trabeculae lined with<br>
osteoblasts in the LMP-l transduced implants, whereas no bone was seen, and the<br>
carrier was partially resorbed, in the controls.<br>
Use of Osteoinductive Peptides to Induce In Vivo Bone Formation<br>
Protocols were essentially as described above. Peptides were applied to 4<br>
separate implants (3 for rabbit), 250 microliters per disc, 6M/ml. Implants<br>
comprised collagen discs. Implants were placed within the chest of Harlan athymic<br>
rats or New Zealand White rabbits. Dose ranges tested were 5 nM, 10 nM, 12.5 nM,<br>
15 nM, 17.5 nM, 20 nM, 22.5 nM, and 25 nM. Results are shown in Fig. 6.<br>
LMP-1 Stimulation of sGAG Synthesis<br>
In vitro experiments with lumbar intervertebral disc cells from Sprague-<br>
Dawley rats were performed by treating the cells with an adenovirus containing an<br>
LMP-1 nucleotide sequence insert (AdLMP-1) at various doses (multiplicity of<br>
infection o, 5,10, 25, 50) and culturing them for 6 days in monolayer to determine<br>
the effect of LMP-1 over-expression in vitro. The DMMB method was used to<br>
quantitate sulfated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) level in the media. Real-time PCR<br>
was used to quantitate mRNA levels of aggrecan, over-expressed LMP-1, BMP-2,4,6,<br>
and 7. A direct ELISA method was used to quantiate the levels of BMP-2,4, 6, and 7<br>
in the media. To demonstrate that LMP-1 upregulation of disc cell proteoglycan<br>
production involves BMPs, a molecule (noggin) which specifically blocks BMP-2, 4,<br>
6, and 7 activities was added to AdLMP-1 treated cells at different concentrations.<br>
In vivo gene therapy experiments were performed in New Zealand White<br>
rabbits. Lumbar discs were injected with either AdLMP-1 (experimental) or an<br>
adenovirus carrying a marker gene (AdLacZ - control) at three different doses (106,<br>
107, and 108 pfu/disc). Three weeks later the injected discs were harvested and the<br>
mRNA level of total LMP-1 (endogenous), over-expressed LMP-1, aggrecan, BMP-2,<br>
and BMP-7 were measured.<br>
AdLMP-1 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 25 was sufficient to induce the<br>
maximal level of sGAG upregulation. A period of 6 days in monolayer culture was<br>
required to reach the maximal level of sGAG upregulation after AdLMP-1 treatment<br>
(MOI 25). Aggrecan mRNA increased by 2 times compared to control. When the<br>
cells were cultured in alginate, the effect of AdLMP-1 treatment on sGAG production<br>
was sustained for 3 weeks.  Six days after AdLMP-1 treatment, BMP-2 and BMP-7<br>
mRNA levels increased significantly to 3.o±o.2 and 2.8±o.3 times that of controls (p<br><o.o1 respectively. bmp-4 and bmp-6 mrna levels were unchanged. bmp-2and></o.o1>
BMP-7 protein levels in the media were increased significantly (p 
to control. In contrast, BMP-4 and BMP-6 protein levels were not elevated. Noggin<br>
at 3200 ng/ml completely blocked the upregulation of proteoglycan by AdLMP-1.<br>
Endogenous levels of LMP-1 mRNA were detected in lumbar nucleus pulposus. In<br>
vivo discs injected with 107 pfu/disc of AdLMP-1 had a significantly elevated level of<br>
LMP-1, BMP-2, and BMP-7 mRNA levels compared to control.<br>
In vitro experiments were carried out with Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat lumbar<br>
disc cells. Two tailed student t-tests were used to compare the experimental group to<br>
control group. The error bars in the figures present 1 SEM.<br>
A replication deficient type 5 adenovirus carrying the cDNA for the human<br>
LMP-1 gene was used (AdLMP-1). Monolayer culture experiments with SD annulus<br>
cells were carried out to determine the relationship between virus dose and over-<br>
expressed LMP-1 mRNA expression using realtime PCR method using a primer that<br>
is specific for only the virally delivered LMP-l cDNA. Monolayer culture experiments<br>
with SD annulus cells were performed to determine the relationship between virus<br>
dose and sGAG production. The sGAG levels were measured with a DMMB method.<br>
The optimal dose of AdLMP-1 was defined as the lowest dose which led to the plateau<br>
level of sGAG production. Using the optimal dose (25 MOI), a time-course<br>
experiment (9 days) was carried out to determine the minimal length of time (6 days)<br>
necessary to reach the plateau level of sGAG production The aggrecan mRNA level of<br>
AdLMP-1 treated annulus cells were compared to controls using the optimal viral<br>
dose and time determined above (AdLMP-1 at 25 MOI and six days after treatment).<br>
In order to ascertain that nucleus cells responded in a similar fashion to annulus<br>
cells, the effect of AdLMP-1 on sGAG production and cell number was determined for<br>
both annulus and nucleus cells at 25 MOI six days after treatment. To investigate the<br>
more long-term effects of AdLMP-1 treatment, sGAG accumulation in the alginate of<br>
SD annulus cells cultured in alginate was determined at 1, 2, and 3 weeks. All<br>
experiments were repeated at least twice.<br>
Monolayer culture experiments with SD annulus cells were performed using<br>
AdLMP-1 at MOI 25. Briefly, the mRNA levels of LMP-1, BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-6,<br>
and BMP-7 were measured with real-time PCR analysis at 0.5,1, 3, and 6 days after<br>
AdLMP-1 treatment. Levels of BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-6, and BMP-7 were measured<br>
in the media six days after treatment using a direct EUSA method. To determine the<br>
effect of blocking BMP activity, noggin was added to the culture media at the start of<br>
AdLMP-1 treatment. The change in sGAG level with or without noggin at various<br>
concentrations after treatment with AdLMP-1 was determined in a six day<br>
experiment<br>
To determine the in vivo effects of administration of LMP-1 (via AdLMP-1) on<br>
aggrecan, BMP-2, and BMP-7, four New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits (3-4 kg) were<br>
used. The anterior lumbar discs L2/3, L3/4, L4/5, and L5/6 were exposed through a<br>
left retroperitoneal approach. Either the experimental virus (AdLMP-1) or control<br>
virus (AdGFP - type 5 adenovirus with Green Fluorescence Protein cDNA as insert)<br>
at io? plaque-forming units (pfu) was injected into each of the exposed disc nucleus<br>
in alternating fashion (i.e., two discs injected with AdLMP-1 and two discs injected<br>
with AdGFP in each rabbit). The virus was administered by delivery in 10 microliters<br>
of phosphate buffered saline through a 30G Hamilton syringe. After 3 weeks,<br>
nucleus pulposus tissue from the injected lumbar discs was harvested. Nucleus<br>
tissues from two rabbits were pooled into either control or experimental disc groups<br>
to obtain sufficient mRNA for further analysis. Reverse transcription and real-time<br>
PCR were used to quantitate the mRNA levels of total LMP-1, BMP-7, and aggrecan.<br>
The primers for total LMP-1 were designed to identity both endogenous and over-<br>
expressed LMP-l.<br>
In a second in vivo demonstration, various doses of the AdLMP-1 virus were<br>
used to establish a dose response relationship. AdLMP-1 at three different doses<br>
(io6,107, i08 pfu) and AdGFP at a single dose (io? pfu) were administered. In this<br>
experiment, all the discs from each animal were injected with a single dose of virus<br>
instead of alternating virus type as in the previous experiment. Eight NZW rabbits<br>
(3-4kg) were used, two rabbits for each of the four virus groups. The rabbits were<br>
euthanized three weeks later and the nucleus pulposus was harvested. The harvested<br>
tissue from within each treatment group was pooled, mRNA isolated and used to<br>
generate corresponding cDNA. Real-time PCR was used to quantitate the mRNA<br>
levels of total LMP-1, over-expressed LMP-l, BMP-2, BMP-7, and aggrecan.<br>
The relative amounts of over-expressed LMP-1 mRNA at 12 hours after virus<br>
treatment at different doses (MOI o, 10, 25, and 50) were normalized to the lowest<br>
detectable level of over-expressed LMP-1 mRNA (AdLMP-1 MOI 5). Increasing the<br>
dose of AdLMP-1 resulted in statistically significant increases in over-expressed<br>
LMP-l mRNA as compared to MOI 5. No detectable levels of over-expressed LMP-l<br>
mRNA could be found in the untreated control or the AdLacZ control groups,<br>
indicating that AdLMP-1 induced over-expression of LMP-l in annulus cells in a dose<br>
dependent manner.<br>
The sGAG concentration in the culture media from annulus cells was<br>
determined 6 days after treatment with AdLMP-1 at different doses. The sGAG<br>
concentration in the culture media on day 6 is a measure of the total sGAG produced<br>
by the cells over the three-day time period between media change and the sGAG<br>
measurement, and therefore is a measure of the production rate of sGAG during that<br>
time period.  Data is expressed as a ratio between treated and untreated controls.<br>
Administration of LMP-1 (via AdLMP-1 at MOI 25) provided the highest sGAG level,<br>
which was 3.1 ± 0.2 times that of the control (p
difference in sGAG levels in media between cells treated with MOI 25 or MOI 50.<br>
Because this AdLMP-1 dose of MOI 25 was the lowest dose that could achieve the<br>
maximal sGAG response, the inventors chose MOI 25 as the working dose for the<br>
remainder of the experiments.<br>
A time-course experiment was carried out to determine the effect of varying<br>
the length of the experiment after treatment with AdLMP-1 at MOI 25. Annulus cells<br>
were treated with LMP-1 (AdLMP-1 at MOI 25), and the production of sGAG over<br>
three day increments were measured. The results were normalized by DNA content<br>
at each time point and expressed as a ratio to untreated controls from the same time<br>
point. The sGAG level was increased to 1.6 + 0.2 (p 

noted between day 6 and day 9, indicating that a pleateau level was achieved by day<br>
6.<br>
LMP-1 Induction of Aggrecan Synthesis<br>
Because aggrecan is the predominant proteoglycan of the intervertebral disc,<br>
aggrecan core protein mRNA levels were measured 6 days after treatment with<br>
AdLMP-1. Quantitative real-time PCR methods were used and the data are<br>
presented as a ratio to untreated controls. After AdLMP-1 treatment (MOI 25),<br>
aggrecan mRNA level was 2.1 + 0.1 (p 
treatment (MOI 25) aggrecan mRNA level was unchanged, 1.0 ±_o.i6 times that of<br>
controls. These results, together with the sGAG experiments, demonstrated that<br>
LMP-1 stimulates intervertebral disc cell production of proteoglycans.<br>
Having established the dose and timing necessary for optimal AdLMP-1<br>
activity on our culture system, the inventors then compared the effect of LMP-1, as<br>
administered via AdLMP-1, on annulus and nucleus cells. Rat annulus and nucleus<br>
cells were treated with AdLMP-1 at MOI 25 and the sGAG concentration of each cell<br>
type was measured on day 6. The sGAG concentration was normalized by DNA<br>
content in order to account for minor variations in cell number. The results were not<br>
normalized to untreated controls in order to compare the untreated controls of<br>
annulus and nucleus cell types. The results for untreated annulus and nucleus cells<br>
were 0.6 ± 0.04 sGAG/DNA and 1.0 ± 0.12 sGAG/DNA respectively. This difference<br>
was statistically significant (p 
produce more sGAG per cell than annulus cells. After AdLMP-1 treatment the results<br>
for annulus and nucleus cells were 1.5 ± 0.08 sGAG/DNA (p 
sGAG/DNA (p 
increases compared to their respective untreated controls. The relative increases<br>
from untreated to AdLMP-1 treated cells were similar between annulus and nucleus<br>
cells. The cell number at day 6 with and without AdLMP-1 treatment was<br>
determined by measuring the DNA content. The annulus cell DNA content increased<br>
1.2 times compared to untreated controls (p 
was unaffected by AdLMP-1. This indicated that LMP-1 induced a mild but<br>
significant increase in the number of annulus cells but not nucleus cells.<br>
In order to test the effect of administration of LMP-1 (via AdLMP-1) on sGAG<br>
production in vitro for a period of weeks, the inventors used an alginate culture<br>
system. Alginate provides a three-dimensional matrix for cells that is important for<br>
maintenance of chondrocytic phenotype in long term in vitro cultures. Annulus cells<br>
grown in monolayer were treated with AdLMP-1 at MOI 25 then transferred to<br>
alginate culture 24 hours later. The cells were cultured for periods of 1, 2, and 3<br>
weeks. At 1 week, the sGAG level in the AdLMP-1 group was 1.5 ± 0.06 (p 
times that of untreated control (Figure 5). At 2 weeks, the sGAG in the AdLMP-1<br>
treated group increased to 2.9 + 0.3 (p 
difference was maintained at 3 weeks; the sGAG level in the AdLMP-1 treated group<br>
was 2.9 ± 0.1 (p 
effective in maintaining increased sGAG accumulation in alginate for at least 3 weeks<br>
in culture.<br>
Having demonstrated the effect of LMP-1 over-expression on proteoglycan<br>
production, we investigated the mechanism by which LMP-1 over-expression<br>
induced this effect. The time-course of changes in mRNA of over-expressed LMP-1<br>
and BMPs (BMP-2, 4, 6, and 7) were determined. These BMPs had previously been<br>
shown to be stimulated in leukocytes and osteoblasts by LMP-1 over-expression.<br>
The time-dependent changes in over-expressed LMP-1 after annulus cell<br>
treatment with AdLMP-1 at MOI 25 were determined. The data were expressed as a<br>
percent of the maximal mRNA level of over-expressed LMP-1 (day 6) instead of as<br>
ratio to untreated controls because no over-expressed LMP-1 mRNA was detectable<br>
in controls. LMP-1 mRNA was detectable 12 hours after treatment and continued to<br>
increase up to the last time point checked (day 6). This indicated that over-expressed<br>
LMP-1 could have an effect on downstream genes as early as 12 hours after LMP-1<br>
administration.<br>
The time-course of BMP mRNA levels after treatment with AdLMP-1 at MOI<br>
25 were also determined by real-time PCR and calculated as a ratio to untreated<br>
controls at each time point. BMP-2 mRNA was upregulated early, reaching a<br>
statistically significant (p 
mRNA increase reached a plateau level by day 3. BMP-7 mRNA was upregulated<br>
later than BMP-2, reaching statistically significantly increase at day 3 (p 
day 6 (p 
different from those of untreated controls.<br>
Having established that LMP-1 mRNA over-expression provides up-regulation<br>
of BMP-2 and BMP-7 mRNAs in annulus cells, the inventors tested whether this<br>
mRNA increase correlated with increased secretion of the BMP proteins into the<br>
culture media. An ELISA assay to quantitate the level of BMP-2,4, 6, and 7 proteins<br>
in the conditioned media. Annulus cells cultured in monolayer were treated with<br>
AdLMP-1 at MOI 25. Media was changed once at day 3, and media was analyzed at<br>
day 6. Test samples therefore contained BMPs secreted during the last 3 days (day 4<br>
to 6) of culture. Protein levels of BMP-2 and BMP-7 in the media were 3.5 + 0.4 (p 
0.01) and 2.5 ± 0.3 (p 
and BMP-6 protein levels were not significantly different from those of untreated<br>
control, which is consistent with the results obtained for mRNA.<br>
Since the mRNA and protein of BMP-2 and BMP-7 were upregulated by LMP-<br>
1, the inventors investigated whether blocking these BMPs would prevent the<br>
increase in sGAG production induced by LMP-1. Annulus cells cultured in<br>
monolayer with AdLMP-1 at MOI 25 were simultaneously treated with the BMP<br>
inhibitor noggin in the culture media and the sGAG levels were measured at day 6.<br>
Cells treated with AdLMP-1 alone had increased sGAG levels (2.7 + 0.3 times that of<br>
untreated control), whereas cells treated with noggin at 3200 ng/ml and AdLMP-1 at<br>
MOI 25 had unchanged sGAG levels (1.1 + 0.1 times untreated control), indicating<br>
that noggin completely blocked the effect of AdLMP-1. Cells treated with noggin<br>
alone (3200 ng/ml) still had nearly unchanged sGAG level (0.8 + 0.1 times untreated<br>
control), indicating the absence of a toxic effect by noggin. The inhibitory effect of<br>
noggin on AdLMP-1 induced sGAG production was concentration dependent.<br>
Endogenous levels of aggrecan, BMP-7, and LMP-1 mRNA in the control discs<br>
(AdGFP injected discs) were detected in the nucleus pulposus. Endogenous mRNA<br>
levels were used to calculate the increase in aggrecan, BMP-7, and LMP-1 mRNA in<br>
the AdLMP-1 injected discs. Discs injected with AdLMP-1 expressed 830% higher<br>
levels of total LMP-1 mRNA than the discs injected with AdGFP. Administration of<br>
LMP-1 via AdLMP-1 produced an 1100% increase in the BMP-7 mRNA level over<br>
control (p
(p<o.05></o.05>
Endogenous levels of BMP-2, BMP-7, LMP-1, and aggrecan mRNA were also<br>
detected. A correlation between increasing AdLMP-1 dose and total LMP-1 mRNA<br>
was seen. Administration of LMP-1 via AdLMP-1 significantly increased BMP-2 and<br>
BMP-7 mRNA levels maximally at a dose of 107 pfu per disc (p
dose of 107 pfu per disc led to the highest increase in aggrecan mRNA, 50% over<br>
control (p
Administration LMP-1 to intervertebral disc cells resulted in an increase in<br>
sGAG production and an increase in aggrecan mRNA levels. LMP-1 administration<br>
produced an increase in the mRNA and protein levels of BMP-2 and BMP-7 in vitro,<br>
and the effect of LMP-1 administration on upregulation of proteoglycan production<br>
could be blocked by administration of the BMP inhibitor noggin.<br>
Sprague-Dawley rats aged 11 months were euthanized and intervertebral disc<br>
tissue from the lumbar spine and tail were harvested in under sterile conditions.<br>
Annulus fibrosus and nucleus pulposus were separately dissected and diced. The<br>
intervertebral disc tissue was placed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and<br>
Ham's F12 medium (DMEM/F-12 ; GIBCO BRL, Grand Island, NY.U.S.A.)<br>
containing 100 unit/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. The intervertebral<br>
disc tissue was treated with 0.2% pronase (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO, U.S A.) in<br>
the medium for 1 hour at 37 °C and then treated with 0.025% collagenase (Sigma<br>
Chemical, St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.) for 6 hours at 37 °C. Isolated cells were washed and<br>
filtered through a 70 mm mesh (Falcon, Franklin Lakes, NJ, U.S.A.) into 75 cm2<br>
flasks with 12 ml DMEM/F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS),<br>
100 unit/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, 2mM Lrglutamine and 50 mg/ml<br>
ascorbate. The cells were grown at 37°C in 5% C02 with humidification. The culture<br>
media was changed every 2 days for approximately 8 days.<br>
Two different viruses were used. The replication deficient type 5 Adenovirus<br>
containing the human LMP-1 cDNA driven by a CMV promoter (AdLMP-1) was used<br>
as the experimental virus. The control virus consisted of a similar replication<br>
deficient type 5 adenovirus containing the lacZ cDNA.<br>
When the primary culture of intervertebral disc cells became confluent, the<br>
cells were subcultured into 6-well plates at 400,000 cells per well. Three days later,<br>
the cells were treated with adenovirus containing the cDNA for either the human<br>
LMP-1 gene (AdLMP-1) or the LacZ gene (AdLacZ). Cell number was determined at<br>
day o by counting a control well using a hemocytometer. The viral dose was<br>
expressed as a multiplicity of infection (MOI), the number of plaque-forming unit<br>
(pfu) per cell. This is essentially the number of recombinant adenoviral plaque-<br>
forming units to which a single intervertebral disc cell was exposed. The cultured<br>
cells were treated for thirty minutes at 37 °C with AdLMP-1 or AdLacZ in 300 ml of<br>
DMEM/F-12 with 0% FBS at different MOIs (o, 10, 25, 50) as designated in each<br>
experiment. Then the culture volume was raised to 2.0 ml with DMEM/F-12<br>
medium containing i%FBS, 100 unit/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, 2mM<br>
L-glutamine and 50 mg/ml Vitamin C. The medium was changed every 3 days<br>
during the experiment.<br>
The sulfated-glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) content of the culture media was<br>
assayed using the 1,9-dimethylmethylene blue (DMMB) method. The culture media<br>
2 ml was centrifuged (5000 x G for 30 minutes) to concentrate the sGAG using the<br>
Centricon YM-50 centrifugal filter (Millipore Co., Bedford, MA, U.S.A.). The sample<br>
solution (20 ml) were mixed gently with 200 ml DMMB dye solution in a 96-well<br>
microtiter plate, and the optical density (OD) was checked immediately at 520 nm<br>
wavelength filter. A standard curve was constructed using serial dilutions of<br>
chondroitin sulfate (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.). Total sGAG in the<br>
media were normalized by DNA content and presented as a ratio to the untreated<br>
control.<br>
The cell number was determined by the DNA content of each well, and DNA<br>
content was measured with a Hoechst dye 33258 (Polysciences, Warrington, PA,<br>
U.S.A.) method, as previously described. Cultured cells were removed from the plate<br>
by exposure to papain (10 units/ml). Cells were then pelleted and incubated at 60 °C<br>
for 3 hours. A twenty microliter aliquot of the papain digest was mixed with 200 ml<br>
of Hoechst dye 33258 solution in a 96-well fluoroplate. Emission and excitation<br>
spectra were measured in Luminescence Spectrometer LS 50B (Perkin-Elmer,<br>
Wellesly, MA, U.S.A.) at 456 nm and 365 nm, respectively. Standard curves were<br>
generated at the time of each measurement using known concentrations of calf<br>
thymus DNA (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.).<br>
Alginate bead cultures are useful for maintaining chondrocytic phenotype in<br>
long term cultures. This method was to determine the effect of AdLMP-1 in three<br>
week cultures. The cells were treated in monolayer cultures as described above. One<br>
day later, the cells were released by trypsinization and washed 2 times with media.<br>
The isolated cells were resuspended in 0.6% low-viscosity sterile alginate (Sigma<br>
Chemical, St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.) solution at 600,000 cells/ml. The cells were<br>
dispensed into a 0.102M CaCl + 0.15M NaCl solution in a dropwise fashion through a<br>
21-gauge needle attached to 10-ml plastic syringe in order to form the alginate beads.<br>
After 10 minutes the newly formed beads (containing approximately<br>
i2,ooocells/bead ) were washed three times with sterile 0.9% NaCl solution foDowed<br>
by two washes with DMEM/F-12. The beads containing the annulus fibrosus cells<br>
were separately cultured in 6 wells plate with DMEM/F-12 medium containing 1%<br>
FBS, ioo unit/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, 2mM L-glutamine and 50<br>
mg/ml Vitamin C. The media was changed every two days for different time periods<br>
(1, 2, and 3 weeks). The alginate beads were dissolved in 350 ml sodium citrate<br>
buffer (55mmol/L Na-citrate, 50mmol/L EDTA, isommol/L NaCl, PH7.4). Cells<br>
were pelleted with centrifugation and the sGAG content in the dissolved solution was<br>
measured with the DMMB method described above. The sGAG content that<br>
remained the cell pellet was negligible compared to that in the suspension. The<br>
results were described as fold increase over untreated control group using sGAG of<br>
dissolved solution.<br>
Quantification of mRNA levels.<br>
Real-time PCR was used to determine mRNA levels of BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-<br>
6, BMP-7, and over-expressed LMP-1 in a quantitative fashion. The primers for all<br>
of the genes were validated by determining the product size on an agarose gel and by<br>
DNA sequencing the amplicon. 18S levels were determined in each sample to use as<br>
an internal control.<br>
Total RNA of each sample was extracted by a single-step method using a<br>
guanidium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform technique. The concentration of the<br>
isolated RNA was determined with a spectrophotometer (DU-500; Beckman,<br>
Fullerton, CA, U.S.A.) at 260 nm wavelength. The RNA was treated with DNAse 1<br>
(Ambion,Inc. Texas, U.S.A.) to remove DNA contamination of the samples. Reverse<br>
transcription was carried out in 40 ml volume with 2 mg of total RNA; 30U Avian<br>
Myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison,WI, U.S A); 5 mM of<br>
MgCl2; 60 U/ml of RNAsin (Promega, Madison,WI, U.S.A.); 1 mM of each<br>
deoxyadenosine    triphosphate    (dATP),    deoxycytidine    triphosphate    (dCTP),<br>
deoxyguanidine triphosphate (dGTP), deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP); and 1<br>
mg oligo(dT)i5 primer for 45 minutes at 42 °C. PCR was performed for 30 cycles ( 95<br>
°C,3o"; 62 °C,30"; 72 °C,45") with Amplitaq® DNA polymerase. To confirm the<br>
absence of DNA contamination, RNA samples treated without reverse transcriptase<br>
were also subjected to PCR: the absence of PCR product confirmed the lack of DNA<br>
contamination.<br>
Real-time PCR has been reported to be a rapid, reliable, and reproducible<br>
method for quantitative detection of specific mRNAs. A real-time PCR method using<br>
SYBR® Green Real-Time PCR Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA.) was<br>
used to perform quantitative mRNA analysis of BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-6, BMP-7, and<br>
aggrecan. Twenty-five microliters (25 ml) of reaction volume included 5 ml of cDNA,<br>
3.75 picomole of each primer (BMP-2,-4,-6,-7 and 18S), and 12.5 ml of SYBR® Green<br>
master mix (2x, Biorad, Hercules, CA, U.SAJ. To quantify mRNA levels of over-<br>
expression LMP-1 and 18S, real-time PCR method using TaqMan® Real-Time PCR<br>
Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, U.SA.) was also performed. Twenty-five<br>
microliters (25 ml) of reaction volume included 5 ml of cDNA, 3.75 pmol of each<br>
primer, and 12.5 ml of TaqMan® PCR master mix (2x, Biorad, Hercules, CA, U.S.A.).<br>
Real-time PCR was performed with the following 3 step protocol; step 1: 50 °C<br>
for 2 minutes, step 2: 95 °C for 10 minutes, and step 3: ( 95 °C for 15 seconds, 60 °C<br>
for 1 minute ) x 45 cycles using the GeneAmp®; 5700 Sequence Detection system<br>
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, U.S.A.). To confirm amplification specificity,<br>
the PCR products were subjected to a dislocation curve analysis. Threshold cycles<br>
(Ct) of each reaction were standardized according to 18S using the comparative -MCt<br>
method, as described previously.<br>
ELISA assay for BMP 2,4,6 and 7<br>
Standard curves of BMPs were constructed using increasing concentrations<br>
(0.1 ng/100 uL per well to looong /100 ^L per well) of human BMP 2, 4, 6, and 7<br>
(Genetics Institute, Cambridge, MA) dissolved in 0.05 mol/L bicarbonate buffer.<br>
One hundred microliters of the samples were added to each well in triplicate. After<br>
incubating overnight at 4 °C, the plates were washed with 0.01 M phosphate-buffered<br>
saline with 0.5% Tween 20 (PBST) three times and unreacted sites were blocked with<br>
1% bovine albumin (Sigma, ST. Louis, MO) at room temperature for 1 hour. After the<br>
plates were washed with PBST, primary antibody (1:1000) was added to each well in<br>
100 microliter aliquots and incubated at room temperature for 2 hours. Polyclonal<br>
goat antibodies to BMP 2, 4, and 6 (Santa Cruz Inc, Santa Cruz, California) and<br>
rabbit antibody to BMP 7 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) were used. The plates were washed<br>
with PBST and then incubated respectively with alkaline phosphatase conjugated<br>
anti-goat IgG and anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) at room temperature for 1<br>
hour. Color was developed with the substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma, St.<br>
Louis, MO) for 20 minutes before the reaction was stopped with 3N NaOH. The color<br>
was quantified by measuring the absorption difference at 405 nm using an Elx 800-<br>
microplate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooska, VT).<br>
To quantitate the results, linear regression plots were made for each standard.<br>
In all cases, the concentrations of samples were extrapolated from the linear<br>
regression plots of the standard in according to the corresponding values at the same<br>
absorbance as the standards.<br>
BMP Inhibition by Noggin Glycoprotein<br>
Noggin is a glycoprotein that binds to BMP-2, 4, 6, and 7 in a highly specific<br>
manner and prevents these BMPs from activating their cognate receptors. A form of<br>
mouse noggin (noggin-FC Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO, U.SA.) was used in<br>
experiments to determine the effect of specifically blocking BMPs after AdLMP-1<br>
treatment. Noggin at different concentrations (100, 200, 400, 800,1600 and 3200<br>
ng/ml) was applied to cells on day 0 and day 3 after AdLMP-1 (MOI 25) treatment.<br>
On day 6, the conditioned media were assayed to examine sGAG production using<br>
the DMMB method described above. Results indicated that LMP-1 effects could be<br>
blocked by administration of Noggin, demonstrating that LMP-1 activity is, in part,<br>
related to its induction of BMPs.<br>
