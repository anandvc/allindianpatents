				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an improved dunnage material for use as floor covering in stores, godowns and warehouses and process for preparation the material. This material is resistant to water, mildew and moisture and therefore helps in preventing spoilage of food products by preventing ingress of moisture and dampness in stored consumable items which includes food grains, tea, coffee, cement, sugar, fertilizers, tobacco.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Traditionally wooden crates, bamboo mats, black polyethylene etc are used in different godowns, stores for storage of food products. These traditional materials have several drawbacks.<br>
A drawback of the above material is that black polyethylene used in the godowns gets easily ripped thereby exposing the stored food products to moisture and dampness.<br>
Another drawback of the above material is that nails used in wooden crates, come out after certain period, which tear the gunny bags kept over the wooden crates, which in turn causes spillage and wastage of food products.<br>
Still another drawback of the bamboo material used in flooring in godowns is that during removal of food grains from the stacks, bamboo/pataramats get mixed with the grains, which cause wastage of food grains.<br>
Further drawback of the above is traditional flooring materials is that these materials if partially damaged, the damaged portion is not easily replacable.<br>
Yet further disadvantage of the above materials is that these materials cannot be reused.<br>
Even further drawback of the above material specifically black polyethylene is that it is not durable enough to withstand the pressure of load of stacks of food products and therefore it necessitates periodic replacement.<br>
Still further drawback of the above material is that these materials cannot be used on walls. The stacks of food grains in godowns, are therefore kept away from walls as safety zone to prevent ingress of moisture creeping into the storage bags form the walls. The storage space in the godowns, warehouses therefore remains partially unutilised to the extent of about 5%.<br>
Yet further drawback of the above material is that excessive discarding of used polyethylene etc. is not eco-friendly.<br>
Even further drawback of the above material is that laying down of t] materials on the floor is time-consuming.<br>
Still further drawback of the above materials is that these materials not cost-effective as these have relatively lower life and necess: periodic replacements.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide improved duni material for use as floor covering in stores, godowns, warehouses and process for preparation of such material.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an impr
Still another object of the present invention is to provide an impri dunnage material for use as floor covering, which in addition to us covering to floors, can also be easily fixed on the walls c store/godown/warehouses. This enables keeping of stacks of food g in contact with the walls of the store, etc. thereby obviating the nee( keeping safety zone between walls and the stacks, which in turn, ena 100% utilization of storage space in godowns. The traditional covering materials cannot be easily fixed to the walls and so the stacl food products have to be kept away from the walls to avoid ingress of<br>
moisture into the stacks, resulting in under-utilization of storage space.<br>
Further object of the present invention is to provide a floor covering material which can be fixed on mobile trollies and thus stocks of food products can be stacked in mobile trollies, which saves labour costs of loading and unloading bags from one place to another since such loaded trollies can be easily moved from one place to another.<br>
Still further object of the present invention is to provide an improved dunnage material for use as floor covering material, which is cost-effective.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to provide an improved dunnage floor covering material, the use of which is time-efficient as it can be easily and quickly laid on the floor of godowns/warehouses.<br>
Even further object of the present invention is to provide an improved dunnage material which enables replacement of any damaged part of the flooring material, which may get damaged due to any reason.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to provide an improved dunnage material for use a floor covering material, which is considerably resistant to ripping by any sharp objects.<br>
Even further object of the present invention is to provide an improved dunnage material for use as floor covering material, which reduces spillage/wastage of food to almost negligible.<br>
Still further object of the present invention is to provide an improved dunnage material for use as floor material which is anti-bacterial<br>

Further according to this invention an improved dunnage material comprising of five layers, the first layer being of plastic film, the second layer being of hessian cloth, third layer being of bitumen coating, fourth layer being of hessian cloth and fifth layer being of plastic film wherein plastic is selected from PP, LDPE, LLDPE, HDPE and any combination thereof wherein bitumen is applied to hessian cloth in quantity 0,70 to 3g per sq ft. and bitumen is selected from 85/25 and 85/35 grades.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
According to this invention, the improved dunnage material for use as floor covering in stores, godowns and warehouses, comprises of five layers, the first layer being of plastic, second layer being of Hessian cloth, third layer being of bitumen coating, the fourth layer being of Hessian cloth and the fifth layer being of plastic film.<br>
Further  according  to  this  invention  the  floor  covering  material  is prepared by the process comprising following steps :<br>
(a)	Preparing laminates of plastic and Hessian cloth<br>
Plastic film using any of polypropylene (PP), low density polyethylene(LDPE), linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), high density polyethylene (HOPE) or any combination thereof, is laminated over a hessian cloth. The thickness of film is kept such that the laminated material having a width of 82-124" and length of 1m has a weight in the range of 160-220g. Lamination is carried out at 150-300Â°C under a pressure of 8.5-9kg. In this way two separate laminates of plastic film and Hessian cloth are prepared.<br>
(b)	Preparation of dunnage material<br>
The two separate laminates of plastic film and Hessian cloth obtained by step (a) are bonded together using bitumen. The bitumen is pre-heated to a temperature of 150-350Â°C and then applied between the said two laminates in the quantity range varying from 0.70 g to 3 g per square foot.<br>
WORKING EXAMPLE<br>
The invention will now be illustrated with a working example, which is intended to be a typical example to illustrate the working of the invention<br>
