designated forms B, D, E, F, G and H, and processes for the manufacture thereof.<br>
OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides novel hydrate forms of alendronate sodium having water content of between 1. 3 and 11.7 percent water.

A still further embodiment of the invention is a new crystalline Form F of alendronate sodium, having a powder X-ray diffractograrmsubstantially as depicted in FIG. 6a,'with characteristic peaks at 9.3 ±0.2, 11.7 ±0.2, 13.0 ±0.2,13.4 ±0.2, 14.2 ±0.2, 15.3 ±0.2, 16.2 ±0.2, 17.4 ±0.2, 19.1 ±0.2, 19.4 ±0.2 and 25,5 ±0.2 degrees 2 theta. Form F has significant IR bands as depicted in Fig- 60 at 660 cm-1, 893 cm-1, 930 cm-1, 9953 cm' ,970 cm-1, 982 cm-1, 1010 cm-1, 1033 cm-1 1052 cm-1, 1060 cm-1, 1069 cm-1, 1109 cm-1 and 1169 cm-1, 1251 cm-1, 1338 cm-1, 1498 cm-1, 1544 cm-1, 1603 cm-1, 1637 cm-1, 1664 cm-1. The TGA Fig. 5b curve shows a gradual loss on drying of 4.1 % up to 150°C.<br>
A further embodiment is a new crystalline Form G of alendronate sodium, having a powder X-ray diffractogram substantially as depicted in FIG. 7a, with characteristic peaks at 9.5 ±0.2, 10.1 ±0.2, 12.7 ±0.2, 16.2 ±0.2, 17.3 ±0.2, 17.6 ±0.2', 19.1 ±0.2, 20.4 ±0.2, 20.9 ±0.2, 22..I ±0.2, 24.8 ±0.2, 25.5 ±0.2, 28.0 ±0.2, 29.0 ±0.2, 29.6±0.2, 30.4 ±0.2, 32.4 ±0.2, and 32.8 ±0.2 degrees 2 theta. Form G has significant IR bands as depicted in Fig. 7b at 665 cm-1, 751 cm-1, 856 cm-1, 895 cm-1, 913 cm-1, 939 cm-1, 1011 cm-1, 1021 cm-1, 1050 cm-1, 1091 cm-1, 1155 cm-1, 1273 cm-1, 1.305 cm-1, 1337 cm-1, 1510 cm-1, and 1639 cm-1-. The TGA curve, Fig. 7b, shows a loss on drying of 6.5% which indicates that the crystal form G contains a stoichiometric quantity of water corresponding to that of the monohydrate (expected loss on drying value: 6.2%). This TGA step is sharp and occurs at 195 °C. The relatively high temperature of dehydration implies that the water is bound tightly to the alendronate molecule. The dehydration step is immediately followed by another step due to decomposition. Due to the decomposition process that occurs adjacent to the dehydration, the conventional loss of drying method is not feasible, and for loss on drying determination the TGA is used.<br>
Yet another embodiment is a new crystalline Form H of alendronate sodium, having a powder X-ray diffractogram substantially as depicted in FIG. 8a, with characteristic peaks at 9.2 ±0.2, 13.0 ±0.2, 14.2 ±0.2, 15.0 ±0.2, 17.1 ±0.2, 20.7 ±0.2, 22.0 ±0.2, 22.4 ±0.2, degrees two theta. Form H has significant IR bands, as depicted in Fig. 8b, of 664 cm-1, 688 cm-1, 722 cm-1, 751 cm-1, 863 cm-1, 893 cm-1, 918 cm-1, 936 cm-1,<br><br>
984 cm-1, 1010 cm-1, 1036 cm-1, 1052 cm-1, 1092 cm-1, 1157 cm-1, 1273 cm-1, 1303 cm-1,     and 1338 cm-1, 1499 cm-1, 1598 cm-1, 1636 cm-1, and 1664 cm-1. The TGA curve.Fig. 8b shows a sharp loss on drying of 3.7% at 170°C.<br>

The present invention also discloses new crystalline forms of alendronate sodium which have been designated Forms B, D, E, F, G and H.<br>
The term "water content" refers to the content of water based upon the Loss on Drying method as described in Pharmacopeia! Forum, Vol. 24, No. 1, page 5438 (Jan -Feb 1998). The calculation of water content is based upon the percent of weight that is lost by drying. For Forms G and H the term "water content" refers to the content of water based upon a TGA measurement and a step analysis in the temperature range of about 25°C - 215°C for Form G, and 25°C - 200°C for Form H.<br>
The term "lower alkanol" refers to alkanols having 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Preferred lower alkanols include ethanol, methanol and isopropanol.<br>
The term "equivalents of water" means molar equivalents of water. The term "equivalents of sodium base" means molar equivalents of sodium base.<br>
Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the term "monohydrate" when used in reference to alendronic acid describes a crystalline material having a water content of 6.7%. Those skilled in the an will also understand that the term "anhydrous" when used in reference to alendronic acid describes alendronic acid that is substantially free of water.<br>
