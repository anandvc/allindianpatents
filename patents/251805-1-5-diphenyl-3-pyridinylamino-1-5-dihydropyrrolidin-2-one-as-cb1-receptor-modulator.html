BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Serial No.<br>
60/862,540 filed October 23,2006.<br>
5	The CBi receptor family is primarily found in the central and peripheral nervous<br>
systems and to a lesser extent in several peripheral organs. The CB3 receptor is found primarily in the immune system. The pharmacology and therapeutic potential for cannabinoid receptor Uganda has been reviewed (Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents 1998, 8, 301-313; Ann. Rep. Med. Chem., A. Doherty, Ed.; Academic Press, NY 1999, Vol. 34, 199-<br>
10     208; Exp. Opin. Ther. 2000, 10,1529-1538; Trends in Pharma. Sci. 2000,21,218-224). CB1 receptor'agbnists have been associated with stimulation of feeding, anemetic properties, analgesia, reduction in intraocular pressure in glaucoma, and aUfivwuyjn of muscle spasms in multiple sclerosis. Conversely, CBi receptor antagonists have been shown effective for reducing feeding and body weight in animal models of obesity.<br>
15 However, most compounds that modulate CBI receptor activity have the pharmacological property of inverse agonism which reduces basal CBI receptor signal transduction as well as the activity of blocking CBI agonist dependent receptor stimulation.<br>
A number of selective, centrally acting CBt receptor compounds are currently in development for the treatment of obesity. Nevertheless, there still remains a need for CBt<br>
20     receptor compounds which have increased in vivo potency which are low molecular weight, and have pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties that provide therapeutic benefit while minimizing adverse events. See for example WO 2007/020502.<br>
In addition to appentency disorders, CBi inverse agonists have been shown to further potentiate the activity of antipsychotic agents in assays. Although current<br>
25     antipsychotic therapies are more or less effective at controlling positive symptoms, -such therapies are not as effective in treating the negative and cognitive symptoms; rendering many patients incapable of leading normal lives. Convergent evidence suggests drugs that enhance neuronal activation in specific brain areas, hippocampal, striatal, and conical areas in particular, would be effective in treating both negative and cognitive symptoms.<br>
30 In addition, the weight loss effects of CBi receptor compounds have been demonstrated in animal models of antipsychotic treatment-induced weight gain and therefore.may also be<br><br>
WO 2008/070305<br><br>
PCT/US2007/08204I<br><br><br>
effective in controlling the treatment-emergent weight gain and metabolic syndrome seen with current antipsychotic therapies.<br>
Moreover, CBj receptor compounds have been shown to reduce alcohol consumption in animal models of alcohol drinking and therefore may be useful in the 5     treatment of substance abuse.<br>
While oral administration is a preferred route of drug delivery, many CBi receptor compounds suffer from poor oral bioavailability as a consequence of their limited solubility in aqueous media and their metabolic lability. Because of the high lipophilicity of the endogenous cannabinoid ligands and the complementary site to which they bind in 10     the CB| receptor, Icnown CBi receptor compounds are also highly lipophilic. This high lipophilicity leads to poor solubility in aqueous media which limits oral absorption and bioavailability. See for example WO 2007/020502.<br>
In addition, compounds which are rapidly metabolized by the liver may undergo metabolic conversion following absorption from the small intestine and prior to reaching 15     the general circulation. During this process, reactive metabolic intermediate (s) may be formed and subsequently may react with other nuclcophiles in the body (such as proteins, DNA, RNA, etc.). This could lead to toxicity issues. This so-called "first pass effect" also limits drug bioavailability.  See for example WO 2007/020502.<br>
In conclusion, there is a need for CB\ receptor compounds that have good 20     bioavailability, have increased in vivo potency, are highly selective over CBj, are more readily soluble than previous molecules, and do not form reactive metabolites which could subsequently cause toxicity issues. The present invention satisfies this need and provides related advantages as well.<br>

5	Compounds of Formula (I) contain asymmetric centers and can thus occur as<br>
Uiastereomeric mixtures, racemic mixtures, single enantiomers, and individual diastereomers, such as compounds of Formula la. All such isomeric forms of the compounds of Formula (I) are contemplated as aspects of the present invention.<br>
While compounds of Formula (I) in their racemic form are useful agents, it is<br>
10     generally preferable to administer compounds of Formula (I) in which one of the<br>
enantiomeric forms has been enriched. A preferred aspect of this invention provides<br>
compounds of Formula (la) that are substantially pure enantiomers. As such, each of the<br>
following specific classes ofcompounds of Formulas (1) and (la) are contemplated as<br>
aspects of the present invention:<br>
15	(a) Those where enantiomeric purities are greater than 80% enantiomeric excess;<br>
(b)	Those where enantiomeric purities arc greater than 90% enantiomeric excess;<br>
(c)	Those where enantiomeric purities are greater than 95% enantiomeric excess; and<br>
(d)	Those where enantiomeric purities are greater than 99% enantiomeric excess.<br>
20                These enantiomerically pure compounds may be prepared by purification of the<br>
desired enantiomer of a compound of Formula (1) from a mixture of enantiomers of this compound. The desired enantiomer of a compound of Formula (I) may also be prepared by synthesis according to the following general schemes by using precursors that are substantially enantiomerically pure. Those skilled in the art will recognize that either<br>
25     resolution of final compounds or of intermediates will provide compounds of Formula^!) in substantially enantiomerically pure form, to yield for example, compounds of Formulas .   (la),ano
It will be further recognized that a substantially pure diastereomer may be isolated from a mixture of diastereomers using methods known in the an. Methods for<br>
30 purification of diastereomers include chromatography and crystallization. A mixture of enantiomers may be separated into the individual substantially pure enantiomers by the process known as resolution. Enantiomers may be resolved through the use of<br><br>
WO 2008/070305<br><br>
PCT/US2007/082041<br><br>
chromatography using a chiral stationary phase. Suitable chiral solid phases include polysaccharide-based stationary phases such as Chiralpak AD and Chiracel OJ (sold by Chiral Technologies, Inc.)- Additionally, enantiomers of basic compounds may be resolved by conversion to a mixture of diastereomeric salts by treatment with a chiral 5     acid. The desired diastereomeric salt is isolated by, for example, crystallization. The substantially enantiomerically pure basic compound may be isolated by treatment with base. Examples of chiral acids include (-^tartaric acid, (+)-tartaric acid, (-)-mandelic acid, (+)-mandelic acid, (-)-ditoluoyltartaric acid and (+&gt;ditoluoyltartaric acid. Enantiomers of acidic compounds may be resolved in an analogous manner using a<br>
10     substantially enantiomerically pure base. Examples of such bases include R-alpha-<br>
methylbenzylamine, S-alpha-methyibenzylamine, and brucine. Another method for the resolution of a racemic mixture involves reaction with a substantially enantiomerically pure chiral reagent (referred to here as a chiral auxiliary) to form a covalent bond. This reaction results in a mixture of diastereomers, which is purified according to methods<br>
15     known in the art. All, or a portion, of the chiral auxiliary may then be cleaved from the molecule to generate a compound which is substantially enantiomerically pure. In some cases, the asymmetric cenier introduced by the chiral auxiliary may be retained in the final product<br>
One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that certain disclosed intermediate<br>
20     compounds and the compound of Formula (II) may exist with different points of<br>
attachment of hydrogen, and is thus considered tautomeric. The individual tautomers as well as mixtures thereof are contemplated as an aspect of the present invention. Each of the forms of the tautomer may exist, interconvert, and undergo the tautomerization under the conditions specified.<br>
25	It will be understood that as used herein, unless otherwise specified, referencesjo<br>
the compounds of Formulas (I) or (la) are meant to also include the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.<br>
It will be understood that the compounds of the present invention described below may exist as distina crystal forms prepared by crystallization under controlled conditions.<br>
30	Compounds of Formulas (I) and (la) are selective for the CBi receptor in<br>
preference to the CB2 receptor. In addition, there is evidence suggesting these CBt receptor ligands act as antagonists of CB( receptor function and have inverse agonists<br><br>
WO 2008/070305<br><br>
PCT/US2007/082041<br><br>
properties as well. Thus, it can be stated compounds of Formulas (I) and (la) ^e modulators of the CB( receptor, and as such are useful for prevention and treatment of conditions associated with the CBj receptor. Such conditions include, for example, memory deficits, cognitive disorders, negative symptoms of schizophrenia, substance 5     abuse disorders (particularly to opiates, alcobol, and nicotine), obesity, metabolic<br>
disorders and eating disorders associated with excessive food intake. See DSM-TV-TR., Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Revised, 4th Ed., Text Revision (2000). Sec also DSM-IV, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4"1 Ed., (1994), The DSM-IV and DSM-1V-TR were prepared by the Task Force on<br>
10     Nomenclature and Statistics of the American Psychiatric Association, and provides descriptions of diagnostic categories. The skilled artisan will recognize that there are alternative nomenclatures, nosologies, and classification systems for pathologic psychological conditions and that these systems evolve with medical scientific progress. The compounds of Formulas (I) or (la) can also be used to ameliorate weight gain,<br>
] 5     whether or not the associated weight gain subject can be classified as clinically obese. An effective amount of the compounds of Formulas (I) or (la), may be administered to a patient in need of such treatment or prophylaxis in order to practice the present methods of therapy. The need for a prophylactic administration according to the methods of the present invention is determined via the use of well-known risk factors.<br>
20     The effective amount of an individual compound is determined, in the final analysis, by the physician in charge of the case, but depends on factors such as the exact disease to be treated, the severity of the disease and other diseases or conditions from which the patient suffers, the chosen route of administration, other drugs and treatments which the patient may concomitantly require, and other factors in the physician's judgment. The<br>
25 prophylaciicjor therapeutic dosage of a compound of Formula (1) or (la) will, of course,<br>
vary with the nature of the severity of the condition to be treated and with the particular<br>
compound of Formula (I) or (la) and its route of administration.	.  ,<br>
A pharmaceutical composition of the present invention comprising a compound of Formula such as herein described and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent, or excipient showed surprising and enhanced effects. Therefore, the said composition is synergistic in nature.<br>
The dose may be administered in a single daily dose or the total daily dosage may be administered in divided doses of two, three or four times daily. Furthermore, based on 30     the properties of the individual compound selected for administration and/or the<br>
characteristics of the dosage form (i.e., modified release), the dose may be administered less frequently, e.g., weekly, twice weekly, monthly, etc. The unit dosage may be<br><br>
WO 2008/070305<br><br>
PCT/US2007/082041<br><br>
correspondingly larger for the less frequent administratis When administered via, transdermal routes, or through a continual intravenous solution,lne dosage administration will, of course, be continuous rather than intermittent throughout the dosage regimen.<br>

Table 1 summarizes the antagonist/inverse agonist properties of Example 2 in CHO cells expressing human or rat CBt receptors or Si9 cells expressing human CB2 5     receptors. It is concluded Example 2 exhibits potent human and rat CBi antagonism with no measurable antagonism of the human CBj receptor. The data indicates Example 2 is a potent CBi antagonist/inverse agonist at both rat and human receptors with no antagonism of human CB2 receptors.<br>
Table 2 summarizes the agonist properties of Example 2 in Sf9 cell membranes 10     from cells expressing human CB] or CB2 receptors. These data demonstrate that Example 2 is an inverse agonist at the human CBi receptor as evidenced by agonist efficacy (Table 2) less than zero which indicates that the compound decreased basal constitutive activity of the CBi receptor in vitro. Example 2 does not have any measurable CB2 agonist activity (Table 2).<br>
