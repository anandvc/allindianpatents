Description:<br>
The invention relates to a winding device for a workstation of a textile machine producing cross-wound bobbins according to the preamble of claim 1.<br>
In order to produce a textile bobbin, as is known, it is necessary for the relevant textile bobbin to rotate, on the one hand, about its bobbin axis, and on the other hand, for the thread running onto the bobbin to be traversed along the bobbin axis. A so-called cross-winding can be produced here by relatively rapid traversing of the thread. In the case of cross-wound bobbins of this type, which are not only distinguished by a relatively stable bobbin body, but also by good run-off behaviour, a distinction is not only made with regard to their type of winding, for example "random winding", "precision winding" or "step precision winding", but also with regard to various cross-wound bobbin formats. A distinction is made, for example, between cylindrical and conical bobbins and between bobbins with a different width. Bobbins which are 4", 5", 6" etc. in width are conventional, for example, in conjunction with textile machines producing cross-wound bobbins. Depending on the cross-wound bobbin format, different tube formats are used here, which also differ inter alia with regard to their length.<br>
In particular in the production of cross-wound bobbins with the "random winding" type of winding, winding devices that operate with so-called thread guide drums are widespread. Such thread guide drums traverse the thread that is running on during the winding process and simultaneously also drive the cross-wound bobbin by means of frictional engagement.<br>
Furthermore, especially in connection with the production of cross-wound bobbins with precision or step precision winding, winding devices are also known in which the drive for the cross-wound bobbin and the drive for the thread traversing mechanism are separate. In other words, in the production of a cross-wound bobbin in the precision or step precision type of winding, the cross-wound bobbin is driven<br><br><br>
by a bobbin drive, while the thread which is running on is displaced by an additional, separately driven thread traversing mechanism.<br>
Mechanisms which have a thread guide which can be displaced parallel to the axis of rotation of the cross-wound bobbin and thread traversing mechanisms, which operate with a so-called finger thread guide, have proven to be very suitable for thread traversing which is rapid and precise in terms of position, in other words, thread traversing mechanisms, which either have a thread guide, which is connected, for example, by means of a traction means to a reversible single drive, or thread traversing mechanisms, which have a finger-like thread displacement lever, which is pivotably mounted in a defined manner over a specific angle range about an axis arranged substantially perpendicular to the cross-wound bobbin axis and is connected to a reversible electromagnetic drive.<br>
A winding device of this type for a workstation of a textile machine producing cross-wound bobbins is described for example in DE 198 58 548 Al, in which the thread traversing mechanism is configured as a finger thread guide. The electromagnetic single drive of the finger thread guide is also connected in this case to a control mechanism which predetermines the current intensity and the current direction according to a predeterminable programme, as a function of the angle and time, in such a way that a specific displacement angle of the thread is adjusted over the traversing width of the finger thread guide. Although high traversing speeds can be produced during the winding process with winding devices such as are known from DE 198 58 548 Al, it is disadvantageous in such winding devices that they are generally designed for a specific cross-wound bobbin format, for example for bobbins which are 6" in width. In other words, always only cross-wound bobbins with a specific width can be wound with these known winding devices.<br>
Winding devices are described in EP1126 058 A2, the thread traversing mechanisms of which are configured in such a way that the most varied requirements of a winding device can be reacted to very universally with them.   In other words,<br><br><br>
although it is basically possible to wind cross-wound bobbins with different formats and widths with such winding devices, a relatively laborious adaptation of the winding device, generally a change of the creel, is however also always necessary with these winding devices when the tube format is changed, in particular if tubes with a different length are to be used.<br>
Winding devices which operate with a thread guide drum are also only suitable to a limited extent with regard to the winding of cross-wound bobbins with different widths, in particular if the tube format is also to be changed in this case.<br>
When the tube format is changed, a change of the creel is also generally necessary in winding devices of this type in addition to a change of the thread guide drum.<br>
A winding device is described, for example, in DE 42 20 188 Al, the thread guide drum of which can be limited to a shortened bobbin width by the blocking of certain regions of the thread guide groove. To assist this stroke limitation during the thread displacement, a special traversing limiting mechanism can also be positioned in this known winding device in the region of a thread guide arranged upstream of the thread guide drum. Although cross-wound bobbins with different widths can be produced relatively easily with the winding device according to DE 42 20 188 Al, when changing the tube format, however, the usual, laborious changeover work in the region of the creel is also necessary here.<br>
Furthermore, winding devices are known from DE 36 28 735 Al, which have, in the region of the bobbin axis of the cross-wound bobbin, a respective drive, by means of which the cross-wound bobbin can be directly driven by means of the cross-wound bobbin tube and, in the process, entrains a pressure roller by frictional engagement. The thread that is running on is traversed in these winding devices in each case by a thread guide drum driven by a single motor and arranged spaced apart from the cross-wound bobbin. Arranged in the region of the thread guide drum here is also a stroke limiting mechanism axially displaceably mounted in the direction of the<br><br><br>
bobbin axis, by means of which the winding-on width of the cross-wound bobbin held in the creel and the position of the traversing triangle of the thread when running onto the cross-wound bobbin can be adjusted. In other words, in this known thread traversing mechanism, the thread course is limited to certain groove portions of the thread guide drum by a corresponding positioning of so-called overturn pins.<br>
A disadvantage in this known mechanism is, however, that a thread traversing mechanism of this type is not suitable for high traversing speeds because of its overturn pins. In addition, it is not described anywhere in DE 36 28 735 Al how to proceed when there is a change in the tube format. It is therefore to be assumed that a corresponding change of the creel is also necessary in this known winding device when there is a change of the tube format.<br>
Proceeding from the aforementioned prior art, the invention is based on the object of developing a winding device which allows different cross-wound bobbin formats to be selectively wound. In particular, in the event of a change of the format of the cross-wound bobbin tube used, the previously necessary, laborious conversion measures in the region of the creel are to be minimised.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention by a winding device as described in claim 1.<br>
Advantageous configurations of the winding device according to the invention are the subject of the sub-claims.<br>
The winding device according to the invention, which has a creel which can easily be modified by equipping with adapters of different length in such a way that cross-wound bobbin tubes of different length and with a different tube format can be fixed between the creel arms of the creel, has the advantage that, if necessary, the respectively required cross-wound bobbin tube can easily be fixed rapidly and completely without problems in the creel of the workstation and can immediately be<br><br><br>
properly wound by the thread traversing mechanism. In other words, in the winding device according to the invention, when the tube format is changed, a fitting adapter merely has to be inserted into the creel and the thread traversing mechanism adjusted in terms of software to the new cross-winding format. No further conversion measures, which are generally expensive and time-consuming, have to be put into effect in the region of winding device.<br>
As shown in claim 2, the respective adapter can be fixed here instead of a tube receiving plate on one of the creel arms of the creel. In other words, after releasing a screw bolt, the rotatably mounted tube receiving plate can be dismantled and replaced by a fitting adapter which is then in turn secured by the screw bolt.<br>
As shown in claim 3, the adapter is preferably configured as a tubular component and is either equipped already with a rotatably mounted tube receiving plate arranged at the end or the adapter is fitted with the previously dismantled tube receiving plate or with a new one. The tube receiving plate of the adapter, in the installed state, engages in one of the end faces of a cross-wound bobbin tube which rests with its opposing end face on a rotatable tube receiving plate of the second creel arm and is thereby securely positioned.<br>
The configuration described in claims 2 and 3 if necessary allows rapid and simple exchange of the adapter, so the downtimes of the workstations are very short when the tube format is changed.<br>
In addition, the adapter is preferably equipped, as described in claim 4, with a respective fitting tube receiving plate. In other words, the adapter has a tube receiving plate which is designed especially for the tube format to be fixed and therefore ensures proper holding of the cross-wound bobbin to be produced.<br>
As described in claim 5, it is advantageous to arrange the adapter on the creel arm, which has no bobbin brake.   It is thus ensured that the braking torque applied<br><br><br>
during braking of the cross-wound bobbin by the bobbin brake is transmitted without the interposition of an adapter, directly to the cross-wound bobbin tube, which significantly minimises the risk of additional slippage occurring between the tube receiving plate of the adapter and the cross-wound bobbin tube during braking of the cross-wound bobbin.<br>
As shown in claim 6, it is also provided in an advantageous embodiment that the thread traversing mechanism is equipped with a finger thread guide and is connected by its drive to the control mechanism of the workstation, preferably the so-called winding head computer. A configuration of this type ensures that, if necessary, the thread traversing mechanism of each workstation can be rapidly and easily adjusted according to the cross-wound bobbin tube positioned in the creel and adjusted by means of an adapter and a cross-wound bobbin with the desired format can be wound.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, each of the numerous workstations of the textile machine producing cross-wound bobbins, as described in claim 7, has a winding device with a bobbin drive roller which can be driven by a single motor and which rotates the cross-wound bobbin during the winding process by means of frictional engagement. A bobbin drive roller of this type driven by a single motor is a drive means which is substantially independent of the format of the cross-wound bobbin to be driven, has been successful for a long time in textile machine construction and ensures a reliable drive of each cross-wound bobbin during the entire winding process.<br>
As shown in claim 8, the winding device is, in an advantageous embodiment, equipped with a creel, which, in addition to a pivot pin, which extends parallel to the axis of rotation of the cross-wound bobbin, has a further pivot pin, which is arranged orthogonally with respect to the axis of rotation of the cross-wound bobbin held in the creel. With a configuration of this type, the creel, if necessary can be used to produce cylindrical cross-wound bobbins and also to produce conical cross-<br><br><br>
wound bobbins, it being possible for the conical cross-wound bobbins to have the various, current angles of inclination.<br>
The invention will be described in more detail below with the aid of an embodiment shown in the drawings, in which:<br>
Fig. 1 schematically shows a side view of a workstation of a textile machine producing cross-wound bobbins with a winding device which has a creel for receiving an adapter,<br>
Fig. 2 shows a perspective front view of the winding device according to Fig. 1 with an adapter arranged on a creel arm of the creel, which adapter fixes a relatively short cross-wound bobbin tube in the creel.<br>
Fig. 1 schematically shows a side view of a workstation 2 of a textile machine producing cross-wound bobbins, in the embodiment a so-called automatic cross-winding machine 1. At the workstations 2 of automatic cross-winding machines 1 of this type, as known and therefore not described in detail, spinning cops 3 produced on ring spinning machines and having relatively little yarn material are rewound to form large-volume cross-wound bobbins 5. The cross-wound bobbins 5, after they have been produced, are transferred by means of an automatically operating service unit (not shown), preferably a cross-wound bobbin changer, to a cross-wound bobbin transporting mechanism 7 along the length of the machine and transported to a bobbin loading station or the like arranged at the end of the machine.<br>
Automatic cross-winding machines 1 of this type generally also have a logistics mechanism in the form of a cop and tube transporting system 6. In this cop and tube transporting system 6, the spinning cops 3 or empty tubes revolve on transporting plates 11. Of the cop and tube transporting system 6, only the cop supply section 24, the reversibly drivable storage section 25, one of the transverse transporting sections 26 leading to the winding heads 2 and the tube return section 27 are shown in Fig. 1.<br><br><br>
Each workstation 2 of the automatic cross-winding machine 1 has a control mechanism, a so-called winding computer 28, which is connected, inter alia by means of a bus connection 29 to a central control unit 30 of the automatic cross-winding machine 1 and by means of control lines 15, 35 to the individual drives 14, 33 of the winding device 4. Furthermore, each of the workstations 2 has various further mechanisms, which are necessary for proper operation of the workstations 2.<br>
One of these mechanisms known per se is, for example, the winding device 4 mentioned above. A winding device 4 of this type inter alia has a creel 8 which, as indicated in Fig. 1, is at least movably mounted about a pivot pin 12, which extends parallel to the axis of rotation of the cross-wound bobbin 5. In addition, the creel 8, as is basically also known and therefore not shown for reasons of clarity, can also be rotatably mounted to a limited extent about a further pivot pin, which extends orthogonally to the pivot pin 12. In other words, the creel 8 is configured in such a way that cylindrical or conical cross-wound bobbins can selectively be wound on it. As further indicated in Fig. 1, the cross-wound bobbin 5 freely rotatably held in the creel 8 rests during the winding operation with its surface on a bobbin drive roller 9, which is driven by a single motor, by means of an electric motor 33.<br>
The electric motor 33 is in this case connected to the workstation computer 28 by means of a control line 35.<br>
Furthermore, to traverse the thread 16 during the winding process, a thread traversing mechanism 10 is provided. A thread traversing mechanism 10 purely schematically indicated in Fig. 1, preferably has a finger thread guide 13 which, driven by an electromagnetic, reversible single drive 14, traverses the thread 16 running onto the cross-wound bobbin 5 at a higher speed between the end faces of the cross-wound bobbin 5. The thread guide drive 14 is thus also connected to the workstation computer 28 by means of a control line 15. Such workstations 2 generally also have a thread connecting mechanism 42, preferably a pneumatic splicing mechanism, a gripper tube 43 for handling the lower thread and a suction<br><br><br>
nozzle 17, with which an upper thread running onto the cross-wound bobbin 5 can be received and placed in the thread connecting mechanism 42.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the winding device 4 of a workstation 2 in a perspective front view. As indicated, each of these workstations 2 has a winding head housing 31 equipped with an input mechanism 32, which winding head housing inter alia receives the control mechanism of the workstation 2, preferably a so-called winding head computer 28. The winding device 4 of the workstation 2 is also fixed on the winding head housing 31 and consists substantially of the creel 8 to hold the tube of a cross-wound bobbin 5, the bobbin drive roller 9 to rotate the tube 18 or the cross-wound bobbin 5 as well as a thread traversing mechanism 10 for traversing the thread 16 running onto the cross-wound bobbin 5.<br>
The thread traversing mechanism 10 has a finger thread guide 13, the electromagnetic single drive 14 of which is connected to the workstation computer 28 by means of a control line 15. The finger thread guide 13 can be activated in a defined manner by means of the workstation computer 28, in other words, the thread displacement speed and the thread displacement range inter alia can be adjusted precisely.<br>
The bobbin drive roller 9 also has an electromagnetic single drive 33, which is in turn connected by means of the control line 35 to the winding head computer 28.<br>
The creel 8, which as already explained above, is at least rotatably mounted to a limited extent about a pivot pin 12, has two creel arms 20, 21, which are in each case equipped in turn with a rotatably mounted tube receiving plate 22. The tube receiving plate 22, which is arranged on the creel arm 21 and is functionally connected to a bobbin brake 23, is axially displaceably mounted. In other words, this tube receiving plate 22 arranged on the creel arm 21 can be pulled back slightly, if necessary, in particular to insert a cross-wound bobbin tube 18 or to remove a cross-wound bobbin 5. The freely rotatably mounted tube receiving plate 22 on the creel<br><br><br>
arm 20 is arranged so as to be easily exchangeable. In other words, this tube receiving plate 22, if necessary, for example after releasing a screw bolt 34, can easily be removed from its mounting on the creel arm 20 and replaced by an adapter 19, which then in turn has a corresponding tube receiving plate 22.<br>
In practice, in each case as a function of the cross-wound bobbin format which is to be produced, a fitting cross-wound bobbin tube 18 and an associated adapter 19 are firstly selected. The cross-wound bobbin tube 18 corresponding to the desired cross-wound bobbin format is then placed in the creel 8, fixed by means of the associated adapter 19 between the creel arms 20, 21 or the corresponding tube receiving plates 22 of the creel 8 and the desired cross-wound bobbin format selected on the input mechanism 32. The winding head computer 28 connected to the input mechanism 32 then activates the drive 14 of the finger thread guide 13 in such a way that the thread 16 is constantly wound on in the region in which the inserted cross-wound bobbin tube 18 is positioned. In other words, the finger thread guide 13 traverses the thread 16 which is running on in the angle range characterised by a in Fig. 2, which, for example, leads to the production of a cross-wound bobbin 5 which is 2" in width.<br><br><br>
