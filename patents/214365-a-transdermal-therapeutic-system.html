				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates  to a transdermal  therapeutic<br>
      system (TTS) for the controlled administration of an<br>
  active pharmaceutical ingredient. The TTS is suitable<br>
for   prolonged,   in   particular   several   days",<br>
administration  of  the  active  ingredient  and makes<br>
continuous contact possible with the  surface of a<br>
  user"s skin even during a time segment characterized by<br>
intensive exposure to water of the TTS applied to the<br>
surface  of  the  skin,  without  unwanted  detachment<br>
occurring.<br>
  Transdermal  therapeutic  systems  (TTS),  are  patches<br>
  having a layered structure and comprising at least one<br>
active pharmaceutical ingredient in a reservoir layer.<br>
A  distinction  is  made  between  matrix-type  and<br>
reservoir-type TTS:  in the first case the reservoir<br>
 layer containing the active pharmaceutical ingredient has a pressure-sensitive adhesive finish, and in the second case a membrane which controls the rate of release of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, and where  appropriate  an  additional  pressure-sensitive<br>
  adhesive layer, are present.<br>
Most commercially available TTS are designed for 24-hourly use. However, there are also so-called three-day patches which are intended to be worn by the user<br>
 (e.g. a person requiring continuous administration of the active pharmaceutical ingredient over a prolonged period, patient, etc.) over a period of at least 72 hours, e.g. Duragesic. The intended period of use is a typical characteristic for a specific transdermal<br>
 therapeutic system and is evident in each case from the instructions for use in the package insert.<br>
The ability of a TTS to function is based on the<br><br>
concentration of the active pharmaceutical ingredient in the reservoir layer being distinctly higher than in the blood vessels located underneath the surface of the user"s skin onto which the transdermal therapeutic 5 system is applied (site of application). This concentration gradient results in a directed diffusion which, after a short initial period (the so-called lag time), ensures a substantially constant active ingredient flux.<br>
10<br>
In this case there is formation of a dynamic equilibrium between the active ingredient-containing reservoir layer of the TTS, the membrane which is present  where  appropriate,   the  pressure-sensitive<br>
15 adhesive layer which is present where appropriate, the layers of skin located below the surface of the user"s skin onto which the TTS is applied, and the blood circulation. Interruption of this dynamic equilibrium -for example by a brief removal of the TTS, may lead to<br>
2	0  the conditions of the dynamic equilibrium set up after<br>
the initial period being considerably altered, and it not being possible to ensure continuous and constant administration of the active pharmaceutical ingredient.<br>
25 Problems may also arise during long-term application of TTS through a patient developing a pronounced sensation of a foreign body because of the rigidity of this system, especially the backing layer. In addition, this rigidity of one component (active ingredient-containing<br>
3	0  matrix,  backing layer etc.)  may result in the TTS<br>
becoming detached or even falling off the skin, because not only good adhesive properties, but also sufficient flexibility of the TTS is necessary for adequate adhesion of the TTS, because a TTS should adapt to the 35  movements of the skin.<br>
In addition, the wearing of a TTS almost always -especially on wearing for more than 24 hours - leads to<br><br>
occlusion of the site of application, because the skin at this site is able to secrete sweat to only a limited extent. This leads on the one hand to hydration of the skin, and on the other hand the growth of 5 microorganisms is favored in the moist and warm microclimate.<br>
The loss of active ingredient in the reservoir layer occurring  through the administration of  the active<br>
10 pharmaceutical ingredient may also alter considerably the composition of this layer. This may be of importance when the active pharmaceutical ingredient can act as plasticizer for the polymeric material of which the reservoir layer is composed. Such effects may<br>
15 be compensated where appropriate by adding other plasticizers and/or changing the degree of polymerization and/or crosslinking of the polymeric material used in the composition of the reservoir layer.<br>
20<br>
Another problem which may occur on use of a TTS over a prolonged period (at least 24 hours) is that relatively large amounts of moisture reach the TTS and bring about decomposition of  the  constituents  of  the reservoir<br>
25 layer and/or an unwanted detachment from the surface of the skin.<br>
Moisture of concern in this connection is, on the one hand, perspired water - water secreted by the sweat<br>
3 0 glands located underneath the site of application of the TTS on the user"s skin - and water which may reach the outside of the TTS applied to the surface of the user"s skin for example during washing (bathing, showering, sauna etc.).<br>
35<br>
The TTS is exposed to the perspired water throughout the period of use, the total amount representing a relatively small but continuously existing stress for<br><br>
the TTS. During bathing, showering etc., by contrast, the TTS is exposed to water which approaches from the outside  for  a  particular  time  segment,  but  with considerably greater intensity. 5<br>
US patent 4,911,916 discloses a transdermal therapeutic system (TTS) having an elastic backing layer, a diffusion matrix composed of a reticulate, macroporous polymer  film  and  a  hydrophobic  pressure-sensitive<br>
10 adhesive layer. The pores of the macroporous diffusion matrix contain a viscoelastic polymer which comprises an at least partially dissolved active ingredient. The backing layer is chosen so that it ensures the occlusivity of the TTS. The advantage achieved thereby<br>
15 is an increase in the rate of permeation of the active ingredient.<br>
It is an object of the invention to administer an active pharmaceutical ingredient over a prolonged 2 0 period to a person requiring a controlled and continuous administration of this active ingredient over a prolonged period.<br>
A further object is to provide a transdermal 25 therapeutic system (TTS) which makes continuous wearing of this TTS possible on a particular site on the surface of the skin (application site) over a prolonged period and ensures during this period a controlled and continuous administration of this active ingredient. 30<br>
A further object is to prevent unwanted detachment of this TTS during the prolonged period, even if within this period there is at least one time segment in which the transdermal therapeutic system is exposed to 35  intensive contact with water.<br>
A further object is to provide an adhesive matrix for a transdermal therapeutic system  (TTS)  which makes it<br><br>
possible for this TTS to be worn continuously over a prolonged period, in particular under conditions such that within this period there is at least one time segment in which the transdermal therapeutic system is 5  exposed to intensive contact with water.<br>
A further object is to provide a TTS design which makes it  possible  for  perspired  water   (perspiration, evaporation  of  sweat)  to  diffuse  out  through  the 10  various layers of the TTS.<br>
The object is achieved by a method in which a transdermal therapeutic system (TTS) which has a reservoir  layer  comprising  at  least  one  active<br>
15 pharmaceutical ingredient is applied over a prolonged period to the surface of a user"s skin, adheres there (at the specific site of application) continuously, and delivers the active pharmaceutical ingredient transdermally. The transdermal therapeutic system used<br>
2 0 in this case is likewise part of the achievement of the object.<br>
The prolonged period includes the time between the attachment of a transdermal therapeutic system to the<br>
2 5 surface of a user"s skin and the removal of this transdermal therapeutic system after the intended period of use has elapsed. The prolonged period is a period of at least 24 hours, preferably of at least 48 hours and particularly preferably a period of at least<br>
30 72 hours. In a further particularly preferred embodiment, the prolonged period comprises at least about 168 hours. It will be appreciated that the skin gives off perspired water (sweat) during the prolonged period. The prolonged period corresponds to the period<br>
35  of use of a single specific TTS.<br>
The intended period of use is a particular characteristic of a transdermal therapeutic system and<br><br>
is normally to be found from the package insert. Within the period of use, the delivery of active ingredient by the TTS is substantially constant. The prolonged period may include at least one time segment of intensive 5 exposure to water of the TTS adhering to the surface of the skin.<br>
A time segment of intensive exposure to water of the TTS adhering to the surface of the skin means,  for<br>
10 example, the case of a bath, of a shower or of a visit to a sauna. Such a time segment naturally depends on the individual user, but in certain cultural circles the duration and extent of body cleaning involves a prolonged  time  of  contact  with  water.  Such  time<br>
15 segments may normally last from a minimum of 1 minute to a maximum of 3 0 minutes, with an average duration of from 5 to 15 minutes being assumed.<br>
The term continuous for the purpose of this description<br>
2	0  means that the contact between the surface of the<br>
user"s skin onto which the TTS has been applied (i.e. the site of application) and the side of the transdermal therapeutic system from which the at least one active pharmaceutical ingredient is delivered to<br>
25 the surface of the user"s skin is not interrupted throughout the prolonged period. This means that no unwanted detachment from the surface of the skin takes place during the period between the attachment of a transdermal therapeutic system to the specific site of<br>
30 application on the surface of a user"s skin and the removal of this transdermal therapeutic system after the intended period of use has elapsed.<br>
The term continuous in connection with the adhesion to<br>
3	5  the surface of the skin is not to be strictly equated<br>
with a continuous administration of the active pharmaceutical ingredient to the user, because normally - as described above - first a dynamfc equilibrium must<br><br>
be generated between the active ingredient-containing reservoir layer, the layers of skin and the blood vessels of the user. These diffusion-related manifestations have the effect that, during a so-called 5 lag time, no or only a small amount of the at least one active pharmaceutical ingredient is delivered to the skin. This lag time is, however, in general negligibly short in relation to the complete time between the application to the surface of the skin and the removal<br>
10 of the transdermal therapeutic system, i.e. the intended application period. The lag time is moreover important only on initial use of a TTS, because normally a transdermal therapy involves a plurality of TTS being applied in chronological sequence.<br>
15<br>
The term transdermal means the percutaneous delivery of at least one active pharmaceutical ingredient to a user (patient), with at least one active pharmaceutical ingredient  being  delivered   from  a   transdermal<br>
2	0  therapeutic system to the surface of the user"s skin<br>
and migrating through the various layers of skin (e.g. stratum corneum,  dermis, cutis and subcutis)  located underneath the site of application of the TTS until it is taken up by the underlying blood vessels. 25<br>
The transdermal therapeutic system (TTS) of the invention which can be employed within the framework of said method includes a backing layer, a reservoir layer comprising  the  at  least  one  active  pharmaceutical<br>
3	0  ingredient, and an adhesive. During storage, such a TTS<br>
is normally located on a redetachable protective layer from which it is removed immediately before application to the surface of the user"s skin. A TTS protected in this way is stored in the blister pack or a side-sealed 35  bag.<br>
The backing layer is located on the TTS side facing away from the backing. It may be in the form of a film<br><br>
web, of a fabric or of a combination of these two embodiments. The backing layer is preferably flexible, by which is meant the ability to bend easily when exposed to a small force directed perpendicularly onto 5  the layer.<br>
A film web means a sheet-like material which is preferably flexible. The thickness of such a film web can be between 2 and 5 0 μm, preferably between 5 and  36 μm and particularly preferably between 9 and 23 μm. The film web may consist of plastic or metal or comprise at least one of these materials in a composite laminate. The film web may be transparent or opaque.<br>
15 Any synthetically preparable polymeric material is in principle suitable as a plastic of which the backing layer can consist, although polyester, preferably polyethylene terephthalate, is preferred. However, polyurethanes  and  polyether/ester  elastomers  (block<br>
20 polymers of partially crystalline polybutylene terephthalate and polyether diols or long-chain aliphatic dicarboxylic esters) are also particularly suitable therefor. A particularly suitable metal is aluminum.<br>
25<br>
Film webs which can be employed as composite laminate are those obtained by gluing, laminating, cladding or extruding from at least one first plastic and a further plastic or metal. In a particular embodiment, the film<br>
30 web can be perforated, and the pores may have a diameter between 2 |im and 150 fom. The pore density can be between 200 to 2500 pores per cm^, preferably between 500 and 17 00. A preferred pore shape has a funnel-shaped orifice structure, resulting in specific<br>
35 capillary properties. While the "smooth" side of such a film web ensures a free passage for water, the rough side acts as barrier. A perforated film web with funnel-shaped orifice structure as backing layer is<br><br>
therefore disposed in the TTS in such a way that its rough side points toward the side facing away from the skin.<br>
5 A fabric means a woven product which is normally produced from warp threads and weft threads. The filamentary starting material of a fabric can consist of natural or synthetic polymeric materials. A suitable natural  polymeric  material  may  be,  for  example,<br>
10 cellulose, silk and cotton, and a suitable synthetic polymeric material may be, for example, polyvinyl chloride, polyurethane, polyester, polyamide, Nomex, Kevlar, polypropylene, polyacryl, Preox, Trevira, nylon or viscose rayon.<br>
15<br>
The backing layer may be impermeable to active ingredient, by which is meant that the backing layer is able to prevent the active pharmaceutical ingredient passing out through the backing layer.  The backing<br>
2 0 layer may be permeable to moisture, by which is meant that the backing layer is permeable to water vapor and/or water in liquid form. In a preferred embodiment, however, the backing layer is impermeable to water in liquid form.<br>
25<br>
The backing layer may also be elastic, which is very important for wearing comfort. By this is meant that, when an external tensile force is applied, the backing layer is capable of stretching and, when the tensile<br>
30 force is removed, this is likewise canceled. The backing layer then returns to the original dimensions. This reversible change in dimensions is possible in at least one direction and amounts to at least 10%, preferably at least 30%. In a particularly preferred<br>
35 embodiment, the backing layer is elastic and permeable to water vapor.<br>
The reservoir layer contains the at least one active<br><br>
pharmaceutical ingredient and at least one polymeric carrier material. The content of the at least one active pharmaceutical ingredient in the reservoir layer is between 0.5 and 45% by weight, preferably between 3 5 and 25% by weight. The content of the at least one active pharmaceutical ingredient in the reservoir layer is sufficient for the active ingredient to be delivered continuously to the surface of the skin during the prolonged period.  The content of the at least one<br>
10 active pharmaceutical ingredient is additionally sufficient for the adhesion of the TTS not to be interrupted by the at least one time segment of intensive exposure to water (within the prolonged period) of the TTS adhering to the surface of the skin,<br>
15  i.e. no  detachment of the TTS takes place.<br>
Suitable as active pharmaceutical ingredient are slimming agents, appetite suppressants, therapeutic agents  for acidosis,  Alzheimer"s drugs,  analeptics,<br>
2	0  antihypoxemics,       analgesics,       antirheumatics,<br>

10  neurotherapeutic   agents,   gastrointestinal   drugs, migraine   remedies,   minerals,   muscle   relaxants, anesthetics,  parathyroid hormones,  calcium metabolism regulators, osteoporosis remedies, neuropathy products, neurotropic  agents,  ophthalmologicals,  otologicals,<br>
15 anti-parkinson drugs, drugs for extrapyramidal disorders, psychoactive drugs, rhinologicals, sinusitis remedies, roborants, tonics, thyroid therapeutic agents, sera, immunoglobulins and vaccines, sex hormones and their inhibitors, spasmolytics, platelet<br>
20  aggregation   inhibitors,   anti-tuberculosis   drugs, stimulants,  urologicals,  vein  therapeutic  agents, vitamins,  wound-treatment  agents,   cytostatics  and metastasis inhibitors.<br>
25 These include inter alia in particular: 17β-estradiol, norethisterone, physostigmine, norelgestromin, norethisterone acetate, nitroglycerin, nicotine, clonidine, moxonidine, fentanyl, testosterone, buprenorphine,  galanthamine,  rivastigmine,  morpine,<br>
30  diamorphine,    buprion,    sildenafil,    (-)-5,6,7,8,-tetrahydro-6-[propyl[2-(2-thienyl)ethyl]amino]-1-naphthol, methylphenidate, ethinylestradiol and (S)-N-ethyl-3-[1-dimethylamino)ethyl]-N-methyl-phenyl-carbamate.<br>
35<br>
The at least one active pharmaceutical ingredient is present in the reservoir layer of the TTS in an amount sufficient for the at least one active pharmaceutical<br><br>
ingredient to be delivered in an effective amount to the blood circulation over the intended prolonged period (period of use). By this is meant that, where appropriate, an initial phase may occur, during which  the delivery of active ingredient does not correspond to the substantially constant delivery of active ingredient during the predominant part of the prolonged period (lag time).<br>
10 The polymeric carrier material forms an essential constituent of the reservoir layer. Suitable possibilities are: water-repelling polymers, water-swellable polymers, water-soluble polymers, water vapor-permeable polymers, which are known to a skilled<br>
  worker.<br>
The underside of this reservoir layer may be identical to the side of the transdermal therapeutic system for which the active pharmaceutical ingredient is delivered<br>
  to the surface of the user"s skin ("skin side" = the<br>
side of the TTS releasing the active ingredient). However, if a membrane controlling the rate of release of the active ingredient and/or an additional pressure-sensitive adhesive layer are present and disposed  underneath the reservoir layer, these accordingly form this side of the TTS.<br>
One component of the reservoir layer which confers pressure-sensitive  adhesive  properties  thereon  is<br>
  possibly an adhesive.  The adhesive may also be a<br>
separate pressure-sensitive adhesive layer which is applied to the side of the TTS facing the skin, or a cover patch.<br>
 It is possible to use a tackifier as component of the reservoir layer which has the effect that this is a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer. Examples of suitable tackifiers are abietyl alcohol and its derivatives,<br><br>
e.g. abietyl esters.<br>
The polymeric carrier material of the reservoir layer may additionally be of such a nature that this is a  "pressure-sensitive adhesive" layer. In this case, monomers which, as constituent of the polymeric carrier material, contribute to the presence of pressure-sensitive adhesive properties are used for producing the polymeric carrier material. Suitable monomers are:<br>
 polysiloxanes, polyisobutylenes and polyacrylates, preferably those composed of acrylic acid and/or methylacrylic acid and/or their esters, e.g. isooctyl acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl acrylate etc. The property of being pressure-sensitive adhesive refers to a material<br>
 in the dry form and at room temperature having a permanent initial tack which makes the material able to adhere firmly to a large number of different materials without the pressure required for this being more than can be exerted with a finger.<br><br>
In a further embodiment it is possible to use an additional pressure-sensitive adhesive layer which is provided with a higher content of tackifiers. In a further embodiment it is possible to use a cover patch.<br>
 In this case, the reservoir layer comprising the at<br>
least one active pharmaceutical ingredient is covered with a composite of backing layer and pressure-sensitive layer to an extent which results in a projecting rim. The pressure-sensitive adhesive layer<br>
  of the projecting rim is able to ensure continuous<br>
contact between surface of the skin and reservoir layer.<br>
The achievement of the invention is the method by which  this at least one active pharmaceutical ingredient is administered to the user to a user (patient) requiring continuous administration of this active pharmaceutical ingredient over a prolonged period. The method includes<br><br>
the steps of a) attachment of a transdermal therapeutic system comprising a backing layer, a reservoir layer comprising the at least one active pharmaceutical ingredient, and an adhesive to the particular site on  the surface of this person"s skin, b) maintenance of the contact between the active ingredient-releasing side of the transdermal therapeutic system and the particular site on the surface of the skin over a prolonged period and c) removal of the transdermal  therapeutic system after its intended period of use has elapsed, where the prolonged period includes at least one time segment associated with intensive exposure to water of the TTS adhering on the surface of the skin.<br>
  The following examples serve to illustrate the method of the invention.<br>
1.	Comparative example with a TTS known from the<br>
prior art.<br>
	A TTS produced as in example 1 of DE 38 43 239<br>
and intended to be worn by a patient over a<br>
prolonged period of 72 hours is stuck onto the<br>
skin of a test subject. A wearing time of 24<br>
hours is followed by the test subject taking a<br>
	vigorous shower over a period of 5 minutes,<br>
during which the TTS adhering to the skin is exposed to the shower water. It is observed that the TTS detaches from the skin during this showering process. Continuous delivery of the<br>
3	0	active ingredient over the intended prolonged<br>
period is thus no longer possible.<br>
2.	Example with a TTS of the invention<br>
A TTS comprising a backing layer composed of a<br>
	PET fabric and of a pressure-sensitive adhesive<br>
reservoir layer with a content of 10% by weight of the active pharmaceutical ingredient buprenorphine  is  stuck onto  the  skin of  a<br><br>
further test subject. This TTS is to be worn over a prolonged period of 72 hours. During this period, the test subject takes three baths each lasting 10 minutes, during which the TTS adhering to the skin is exposed to the bath water. Detachment from the skin is not observed during these baths. The active ingredient is thus delivered continuously to the skin also during the prolonged period of 72 hours.<br>
Comparative example with a further TTS of the invention<br>
A further TTS comprising a backing layer composed of a PET fabric and of a pressure-sensitive adhesive reservoir layer with a content of 10% by weight of the active pharmaceutical ingredient buprenorphine is stuck onto the skin of a further test subject. The TTS is to be worn over a prolonged period of 168 hours. During this period, the test subject takes four showers each over a period of 5 minutes and takes three baths each lasting 10 minutes. The TTS adhering to the skin is exposed to the water during these shower processes and baths. Detachment of the TTS is not observed.<br>
[t is thus shown that the design of the transderamal therapeutic system (TTS) of the invention enables the active ingredient to be delivered continuously over a prolonged period to the skin, even if at least one time segment associated with intensive exposure to water of bhe TTS adhering to the skin occurs during this period.<br>
rhe transdermal therapeutic system for administering at least one active pharmaceutical ingredient through the skin of a person requiring the continuous administration  of  this  active  ingredient  over  a<br><br>
prolonged period, where this prolonged period includes at least one time segment of intensive exposure to water of the transdermal therapeutic system, comprises a backing layer, a reservoir layer and an adhesive and  has the innovation that the adhesive retains its adhesive properties over said prolonged period.<br>
The figures show three different embodiment of designs of transdermal therapeutic systems (TTS) which comprise   the design elements mentioned in the description. The reference numbers therein have the following meaning:<br>
1	-	backing layer<br>
2	=    reservoir layer<br>
  3 =    control membrane<br>
4	=    pressure-sensitive adhesive layer<br>
5	=    support film<br>
Modifications of the embodiments described herein will   be apparent to the person skilled in the art of the transdermal administration of active ingredients and are intended to be within the scope of the claims.<br><br><br>
