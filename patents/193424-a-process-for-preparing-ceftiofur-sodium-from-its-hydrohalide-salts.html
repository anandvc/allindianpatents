FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a novel method for preparing ceftiofur sodium from its hydrohalide salts. The invention discloses a new and economical process for preparation of ceftiofur acid starting from ceftiofur hydrohalide salt and treating it with a trimethylsilylating agent. The ceftiofur acid thus prepared was converted into its sodium salt by using some highly efficient sodium exchange reagent.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Ceftiofur is the generic name given to compound of formula (I)<br><br>
Ceftiofur acid, its salts with alkali metal, alkaline earth metal and amines are reported for the first time in US patent no. 4464367. All these derivatives of ceftiofur are known to have stability problems and are difficult to purify due to amorphous nature of the compounds.<br>
An attempt to overcome these problems was made in US patent No. 4877782 by preparing zinc complexes of ceftiofur which have better dispersibility in water and can be used in pharmacological preparations. US patent No. 4902683 explains the isolation of ceftiofur in the form of crystalline hydrohalide salts which has better<br><br>
solubility and other physical properties compared to parent compounds. The hydrohalide salts as such cannot be used for parenteral administration, therefore it is necessary to convert a hydrohalide salt to sodium salt in order to use the drug as injectable.<br>
Several methods are reported in patents for converting cephalosporanic acid to their corresponding alkali metal salt. This step is of special importance in case of injectable antibiotics. Surprisingly, very few methods are disclosed for preparing ceftiofur sodium starting from hydrohalide salt of ceftiofur. US patent No. 4937330 describes the use of polyvinylpyridine for neutralization of hydrohalide salt to get free acid and then treating the free acid with sodium-2-ethylhexanoate. The use of sodium-2-ethyl hexanoate for this purpose is subject of several patents in field of cephalosporin antibiotics. The neutralization of hydrohalide salt using polyvinyl pyridine resin involves an extra filtration step in the process and the resin loses activity after certain batches and needs replacement which adds cost to the process.<br>
In general, the process for liberation of ceftiofur free acid from hydrohalide salt using either resinous bases or non-resinous bases is associated with several problem. Keeping all these problems in mind, the Applicant discloses a simple, economical and commercially viable process for preparing ceftiofur sodium starting from ceftiofur hydrohalide salt which obviates the above mentioned limitations and does not use known neutralizing agents for this purpose. The process comprises of two steps:<br>
(a) treatment of hydrohalide salt of ceftiofur with a trimethylsilylating agent which will neutralize the ceftiofur hydrohalide salt to give free ceftiofur acid; and<br><br>
(b) the   reaction of free ceftiofur acid with sodium exchanging agents'for making sodium salt of ceftiofur acid<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of the invention is a new process for preparing a ceftiofur sodium.<br>
Another object of this invention is to neutralize the hydrohalide salt of ceftiofur to get free ceftiofur acid. This has been achieved by using N,0-bistrimethylsilyl acetamide, bis-trimethylsilylurea and Hexamethyl disilazane (HMDS).The applicant reports for the first time the use of these trimethylating agents for the purpose of neutralizing the hydrohalide salt of any cephem acid.<br>
Yet another object of the invention relates to use of trimethylsilylating agent for the first time for the purpose of neutralizing the hydrohalide salt of any cephem acid.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to make sodium salt thus prepared from ceftiofur acid using sodium lactate, sodium ethylacetoacetate, sodium-2-ethyl hexanoate and sodium acetate as sodium exchange reagent.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing sodium salt of cephalosporins from their corresponding hydrohalide salt, which is neutralized with trimethylsilylating agent for the first time.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to this invention treatment of hydrohalide salt of ceftiofur with a silylating agent in an aprotic solvent at a temperature ranging from 25 to 60°C for 8-12 hrs gives free acid. The hydrohalide salt of ceftiofur employed in the present invention is well-known and commercially available. Hence, the present invention relates to a process for preparing ceftiofur sodium of formula (II)<br><br>
said process comprising the steps of:<br>
a)	dissolving a ceftiofur hydrohalide salt in an aprotic organic solvent such as<br>
hereindescribed   and   neutralizing   it   with   a   silylating   agent   such   as hereindescribed at a temperature in the range of 25 to 65 °C,<br>
b)	precipitating the ceftiofur acid by quenching with water,<br>
c)	dissolving the ceftiofur acid from step (b) in a solvent and reacting with a sodium exchanging reagent such as hereindescribed,<br>
d)	precipitating ceftiofur sodium with a solvent as hereindescribed, and<br>
e)	isolating the ceftiofur sodium by conventional methods.<br>
Since the solubility of hydrohalide salt of ceftiofur is very poor in organic solvent and in aqueous phase, it is required to be neutralized. Silylating agents such as N,0-bistrimethylsilyl acetamide, bissilyl-urea (BSU) and hexamethyl disilazane (HMDS) used herein plays a dual role in this reaction. First, it solublizes the hydrohalide salt of ceftiofur in an aprotic organic solvent and thereby production of ceftiofur acid by neutralization of the hydrohalide salt, thus avoiding use  of any other _<br><br>
base. The silylating agent was used in mole ratio of 1.0 to 5.0 w.r.t hydrohalide salt but the most preferred ratio is about 3.0 moles w.r.t. hydrohalide salt of ceftiofur.<br>
The solvents used in the process are selected from any of tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, Dichloromethane, dimethylacetamide (DMAc), acetone, acetonitrile and mixtures thereof. Most suitable solvents were acetonitrile and DMAc. The reaction was carried out at temperature range of 25-60°C but best results were obtained at 35-40°C. The reaction duration was about 8-12 hours.<br>
The wet cake of ceftiofur acid thus obtained was converted to sodium salt using sodium exchanging agents like sodium lactate, sodium ethyl acetoacetate, sodium acetate and sodium 2-ethyl hexanoate. Ceftiofur acid was dissolved in suitable solvent and reacted with suitable sodium-exchanging reagent, whereby the ceftiofur sodium product was precipitated by the addition of ethyl acetate or acetone.<br>
The preferred process of this invention is to prepare sodium salt of ceftiofur starting from hydrohalide salt of ceftiofur acid.<br>
The invention is illustrated with following examples but it should be understood that<br>
the invention is not intended to be limited to the specific embodiments herein.<br>
