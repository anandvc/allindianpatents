ACTIVITY<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a polysaccharide compound of formula I<br>
which present immune stimulating activity, to a process for obtaining it, to its use in<br>
the treatment of immune suppressant diseases and to pharmaceutical compositions<br>
containing it.<br>
BACKGROUD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The immune system can be defined as the collection of molecules, cells and<br>
organs whose complex interactions form an emergent system which is generally able<br>
to protect an individual both from outside invaders and its own altered cells.<br>
The immune system can be separated into two functionally distinct parts:<br>
those elements which are innate and those which are acquired. Innate immunity<br>
refers to immune elements which are non-specific and non-adaptive. They are able<br>
to distinguish foreign tissues/organisms but are unable to recognise a particular<br>
invader. They can be best divided in barriers (skin and mucosa), non-specific<br>
chemical agents (enzymes present in mucusal secretions, quinines and histamines)<br>
and non-specific effector cells (macrophages). Acquired immunity refers to elements<br>
which are specific and adaptive. They are able to distinguish foreign cells from self,<br>
and can distinguish one foreign antigen from another. Acquired immunity has<br>
memory. This allows immunisation and resistance to reinfection with the same<br>
microorganism. The cells which are responsible for the acquired immunity are<br>
lymphocytes, of which there are two subclasses: B and T-cells.<br>
The acquired immunity can be attained either by natural infection or<br>
vaccination (in an active way) or by administration of immune cells (in a passive<br>
way). While the first way presents long lasting effects and can be even permanent,<br>
the later is not long lasting.<br>
Patients presenting immune-suppressant diseases are treated with immune<br>
stimulants in order to activate their immune system. Different immune stimulants are<br>
known from US 4801578, US 5417979, WO 9851319. Polysaccharide immune<br>
stimulants are known from DE 19817177 and EP 0 225 496. These patents disclose<br>
polysaccharide compounds having immune stimulating activity and their obtention<br>
from plant cell cultives. As plants Echinacea purpurea, Echinacea angustifolia and<br>
Calendula officinalis are employed.<br>
However, none of these immune stimulating compounds present a<br>
satisfactory activity for the immune-suppressant diseases. There is, thus, a need in<br>
the art for alternative immune stimulators presenting an improved and wide activity.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a polysaccharide compound of formula I<br>
which presents immune stimulating activity, a process for obtaining it, its use in the<br>
treatment of immune suppressant diseases and pharmaceutical compositions<br>
containing it.<br>
An aspect of the invention relates to polysaccharide compounds of formula<br>
I<br>
Scheme I<br>
wherein n = 7 to 8.<br>
A second aspect of the invention relates to the method for obtaining the<br>
polysaccharide compound of formula I. This method comprises firstly, the obtention<br>
of an aqueous extract from the plant Calendula officinalis according to a method<br>
disclosed in a copending application of ours and, secondly, the isolation of the<br>
polysaccharide by a employing a combination of separation techniques guided by<br>
bioassay.<br>
A further aspect of the invention relates to the use of the present<br>
polysaccharide compound of formula I as therapeutic agent in the treatment of<br>
immune suppressant diseases such as cancer, tuberculosis, influenza, common cold,<br>
allergies, lupus erythematosus, psoriasis and AIDS.<br>
A further aspect of the invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
As mentioned above, the first aspect of the invention relates to a<br>
polysaccharide compound of formula I:<br>
Scheme I<br>
wherein n = 7 to 8<br>
The configurational structure of the compound of formula I is:<br>
Scheme II<br>
wherein n = 7 to 8<br>
The polysaccharide compound present a mean molecular weight of about<br>
10,000.<br>
The second aspect of the invention relates to the method for obtaining the<br>
polysaccharide compound of formula I. This method comprises firstly, obtaining an<br>
aqueous extract from the plant Calendula officinalis according to a method disclosed<br>
in a copending patent application of ours entitled "process for preparing aqueous<br>
extracts of plants and extracts so obtained" and filed simultaneously with the present<br><br>
application of serial number 753/KOLNP/2003 and, secondly, the isolation of the<br>
polysaccharide by a combination of separation techniques guided by bioassay.<br>
The aqueous extract of the Calendula officinalis is obtained by subjecting<br>
the flowers of this pant to the following process:<br>
a) Decontamination of the flowers<br>
b) Comminuting the flowers.<br>
c) Treatment of the comminuted flowers with a laser radiation.<br>
d) Suspension of the mixture obtained in step c) in water.<br>
e) Maceration of the suspension obtained in step d).<br>
f) Separation of the resulting liquid.<br>
The decontamination (step a) is effected by washing the flowers of<br>
Calendula oficinalis with water. The amount of water employed in this step is not<br>
determinant, and can be varied depending on ther contamination state of the plant.<br>
Although higher and lower temperatures are not discarded, the water temperature<br>
should be between 10 and 40 °C, preferably between 20 and 35°C, and most<br>
preferably 28°C. A washing tunnel can be employed to facilitate this step. Both the<br>
amount of water and the residence time of the plant in the .washing tunnel is not<br>
determinant, and can therefore be varied depending on the contamination state of the<br>
plant. The washing step can be carried out several times, with a drying step in<br>
between. This drying step is preferably effected by placing the plant in the sun.<br>
Once the flowers have been thoroughly decontaminated, they are<br>
comminuted (step b) by conventional methods such, as a comminuting machine or<br>
even manually. Although higher and lower temperatures are not discarded, the<br>
temperature at which the flowers are comminuted should be between 10 and 40 °C.<br>
The comminuted flowers are next subjected to a treatment with laser<br>
radiation (step c). As source of the laser radiation, a red linear laser diode with a<br>
capability of harmonic generation in wavelengths within the range of 150 to 810 run<br>
is preferably employed. The wavelength of the laser radiation is more preferably of<br>
200 to 400 nm and most preferably of 250 nm. The power of the laser radiation is<br>
preferably of 1 to 60 watts, more preferably of 10 to 30 watts and most preferably of<br>
20 watts. The spot is preferably of 1 to 6 mm, more preferably of 2 to 5 mm and<br>
most preferably of 4 mm of diameter. The comminuted plant is exposed to the laser<br>
radiation so that the whole or most of the mixture is irradiated. This is achieved<br>
either by displacing manually the laser generator through the comminuted plant, or<br>
by passing the comminuted matter on a conveyor belt through a set of several laser<br>
generators. Preferably each kilogram of the comminuted matter is treated with the<br>
laser radiation for a period of 3 to 10 minutes, more preferably for a period of 5<br>
minutes. Although higher and lower temperatures are not discarded, the temperature<br>
at which the comminuted plant is treated with the laser radiation should be between<br>
10 and 40 °C.<br>
The laser treated matter is next suspended in water (step d). Any<br>
commercial mineral water can be employed in this step. The suspension is effected<br>
so that 50 to 300, preferably 100 to 250, grams of the laser treated matter are present<br>
per litre of water. Although higher and lower temperatures are not discarded, the<br>
temperature at which the comminuted plant is suspended in water should be between<br>
10 and 40 °C. "<br>
The suspension is then kept for a period of between 5 to 20 days, preferably<br>
of 7 to 15 days, at a temperature of 2 to 10 °C, preferably of 4 to 8°C, so that<br>
maceration of the mixture takes place (step e).<br>
Finally, after the maceration step, a separation of the liquid phase from the<br>
solid phase is effected (step f). The solids can be pressed to facilitate the separation.<br>
The separation can be achieved by decantation alone or, preferably, by decantation<br>
followed by filtration. The filtration is preferably effected under pressure. Most<br>
preferably three consecutive press-filtrations are effected with filters of 5 µm, 1 µm<br>
and 0.22 µm. Although higher and lower temperatures are not discarded, the<br>
temperature at which the separation is effected should be between 10 and 40 °C.<br>
An aqueous extract of an ochre colour is finally obtained.<br>
The extract thus obtained is next subjected to an isolation process which<br>
comprises precipitation with methanol, centrifugation and chromatographic separa-<br>
tion guided by bioassay. The bioassay employed were performed in vitro by adding<br>
the samples to lymphocytes isolated from mice according to the literature reference<br>
Max. W. et al. Journal of Natural Products, vol. 54, no. 6, pp. 1531-1542 (1991).<br>
The incorporation of thymidine, which means replication of DNA, was monitored.<br>
This incorporation is indicative both of an increase in lymphocyte number and an<br>
increase in lymphocyte activity. These separation techniques employed include<br>
repeated precipitation with ethanol, centrifugation, dialysis and/or column<br>
chromatography.<br>
Thus, 112 litres of the aqueous extract previously obtained were lyophilised<br>
to yield 800 g of a tan coloured powder ("PF2")- This powder was fractionated into a<br>
MeOH-soluble and a MeOH-insoluble residue (PF2R, 350 g), which exhibit<br>
lymphocyte transformation activity. A portion (80 g) of this material was subjected<br>
to MeOH precipitation, centrifugation, dialysis and/or column chromatography on<br>
Sephadex DEAE led to the isolation of a number of crystalline materials, which were<br>
determined to be inactive inorganic salts (figure 1).<br>
A portion (270 g) of PF2R which was subjected to precipitation with<br>
MeOH to final concentrations of 25, 50 and 67% led to active precipitates. The most<br>
active material was the precipitate obtained from the 50% MeOH solution (PF2RS8<br>
51.2 g, LT= +1059 %). Work up of a 5 g portion of PF2RS8 solubilised in water,<br>
followed by centrifugation, and chromatographic separation of the supernatant on<br>
Sephadex G-25 led to the active polysaccharide enriched fraction designated as<br>
PF2RS8A (0.13 g, LT = +1074 %). Subsequently, an identical fraction designated as<br>
PF2RS8A" (0.3 g) was obtained from a second portion (6 g) of the 50 % MeOH<br>
precipitate. As indicated in figure 2, a number of other fractions and crystalline<br>
materials were isolated, however, none showed the level of LT activity of PF2RS8A.<br>
PF2RSSA was characterised by spectroscopic (1H, i3C-NMR, and OEPT<br>
spectra) and chemical analysis (hydrolysis with TFA and analysis on silica ge TC).<br>
See Figures 3,4 and 5.<br>
More active polysaccharide mixture PF2RS8A (1.4 g) was isolated from<br>
the remaining 50% MeOH precipitate (PF2RS3). At- the same time, work-up of a<br>
portion (2.0 g) of the 67% MeOH insoluble fraction (PF2RS9; LT =+735%) led to<br>
the isolation of a polysaccharide mixture (PF2RS9A, 0.3g), which was showed by<br>
"H- NMR analysis to be identical as PF8RS8A. Thus, PF2RS9A (0.2 g) was<br>
combined with PF2RS8A (1.4 g), and the mixture, designated as "PF2S8B", was<br>
subjected to further separation with sephadex G-50 (29-80 mm) as showed in figure<br>
6. Elution with water yielded six fractions (PF2RS8B1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6), which on<br>
HPLC analysis showed that only the major isolate PF2RS8B2 to be homogeneous<br>
using both evaporative light scattering and UV detection (figures 7 and 8). 1H and<br>
13C-NMR spectral analysis (figures 9 and 10) showed spectra of this isolate to be<br>
very similar to those obtained for PF2RS8A (figures 3 and 4), which implied that it<br>
is the major polysaccharide in the mixture. The fraction PF2RS8B2 consists<br>
therefore of the polysaccharide of formula I and water. The latter can be eliminated<br>
by methods known in the art.<br>
Bioassay of the homogeneous isolate PF2RS8B2 and its parent mixture<br>
PF2RS8A in the same assay showed lymphocyte transformation (LT) activities of<br>
6203% and 3532%, respectively (Table 1). The higher level of activity showed by<br>
the isolate implied that this polysaccharide is the major active constituent for the<br>
biological effect of the present extract.<br>
The active polysaccharide PF2RS8B2 (polysaccharide of formula I) was<br>
elucidated by spectroscopic (1H, 13C-NMR, HMQC and 2D 1H-1H COSY spectra)<br>
and chemical analysis (hydrolysis with TFA and analysis on silica gel TLC). Thus,<br>
The 1H-RMN signals (Figure 9) at 5 5.3 and 3.2 ppm is indicative of a<br>
polysaccharide. The 13C-NMR signals (Figures 10-12) at d 111.9 (d), 110.1 (d) ppm<br>
were assigned to the anomeric carbons of l?3 linked a-L-arabinofuranose and<br>
terminal a-L-arabinofuranose (expressed Araf and Araf respectively). The signals at<br>
5106.1 (d) and 105.9 (d) ppm were assigned to the anomeric carbons of 1?6 linked<br>
P-D-galactopyranose and l?3, 1?6 linked P-D-galactopyranose (expressed as<br>
Galp" and Galp respectively), whereas, the signal at 5 100.2 (d) ppm was assigned to<br>
the anomeric carbons of a-L-rhamnopyranose (expressed as Rhap). The anomeric<br>
proton signals (H-1) were also easily recognised due to their relative low-field shift<br>
in the 1H-RMN spectra. The direct correlation between proton and carbon-13 signals<br>
observed in HMQC spectrum (Figure 13) determined the 1H-RMN signals"of 5 5.08<br>
(brs), 5.23 (brs), 4,47 (d, 5=1.9 Hz), 4.53 (d, J=7.3Hz) and 5.1 (brs) ppm to be the<br>
anomeric protons of a-L-arabinofuranose (Araf"), a-L-arabinofuranose (Araf), P-D-<br>
galactopyranose (Galp"), P-D-galactopyranose (Galp) and a-L-rhamnopyranose<br>
(Rhap). Employing these signals as reference, other proton signals could be traced<br>
by analysing 2D 1H-1H COSY spectra (figures 14,15). Similarly, the corresponding<br>
carbon signals were defined by HMQC spectra (figures 13, 16 and Table 2). The<br>
sequencing of the sugar units was determined as follows. The down field shift of the<br>
signal at C-3 of Araf (5 79.4) and Galp (8 82.8), and the signals at C-6 of Galp and<br>
Galp"(569.2) suggested that these carbons were connected to other sugar units. The<br>
observation of long-range correlations between C-1 of Araf and C-6 of Galp and<br>
Galp" in the HMBC spectrum (Figure 17) suggested a 1?6 linked P-D-<br>
galactopyranose backbone. The Araf was 1?3 linked to Galp by the observation of<br>
long-range correlation between C-l of Araf and C-3 of Galp (Figure 18). From the<br>
1H-RMN spectrum (Figure 9), the ratio of the sugars was calculated according to the<br>
integration values of anomeric protons peaks to be Araf:Araf :Galp:Galp":Rhap/<br>
3:1:2:2:1. PF2RS8B2 was therefore elucidated as a large branched chain<br>
polysaccharide with the primary structure as shown in formula I (scheme I). Scheme<br>
II is a representation of the same structure showing the stereochemical configuration<br>
of the individual sugars.<br>
To confirm the identities of the constituent sugars, PF2RS8B2 was<br>
hydrolysed with TFA (0.5 M, 100-120 °C) followed by TLC analysis (Figure 19).<br>
The presence of the major sugars a-L-arabinofuranose and p-D-galactopyranose was<br>
easily discerned, whereas the presence of the minor sugar, a-L-rhamnopyranose,<br>
was detected with more difficulties, probably due to the quantity of the hydrolysate<br>
applied to the TLC plate.<br>
The molecular weight of the PF2RS8B2 was estimated by gel permeation<br>
(size exclusion) chromatography. The mean molecular weight thus estimated of<br>
PF2RS8B2 is of 10,000 (See figure 20).<br>
The polysaccharide compound of formula I unexpectedly presents veiy<br>
high activity as immune stimulator, as reflected in the example below. The third<br>
aspect of the invention relates, thus, to the use of the polysaccharide compound of<br>
formula I as therapeutic agent in the treatment of immune-suppressant diseases such<br>
as cancer, tuberculosis, influenza, common cold, allergies, lupus erythematosus,<br>
psoriasis and AIDS. Non limitative examples of cancers are hepatic carcinoma, lung<br>
cancer, kidney cancer, colon cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer or prostatic<br>
adenocarcinoma; brain cancers such as astrocytoma and glioblastoma; cervix cancer<br>
and blade cancer.<br>
The fourth aspect of the invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions<br>
comprising the polysaccharide compound of formula I.<br>
The polysaccharide according to the present invention can be administrated<br>
either separately as a pure substance or in the form of pharmaceutical preparations,<br>
even though the compound of the invention is preferably administered in a<br>
combination. The drug combination is preferably in the form of a formulation which<br>
(1) contains the polysaccharide according to the invention alone; (2) contains one or<br>
more appropriate binders, carriers and/or further auxiliary, materials, and (3) may<br>
further contain additional therapeutically active substances.<br>
The carriers materials, binders and/or auxiliary materials must be<br>
pharmaceutically and pharmacologically tolerable, so that they can be combined<br>
with the other components of the formulation or preparation and do not exert adverse<br>
effects on the organism treated .<br>
The formulations include those which are suitable for oral or parentherai<br>
(including subcutaneous, intradermal, intramuscular and intravenous) administration,<br>
even though the best route of administration is dependent on the patient"s status.<br>
The formulations can be in the form of single doses. The formulations are<br>
prepared according to methods known in the field of pharmacology. The appropriate<br>
quantities of active substances suitable for administration may vary as a function of<br>
the particularly field therapy. In general, the active substance concentration in a<br>
single-dose formulation is 5% to 95% of the total formulation.<br>
The invention provided by the application is illustrated by the examples<br>
presented hereinbelow.<br>
Example 1: Preparation ofan aqueous extract of flowers of Calendula oficinalis<br>
according to the method of the invention.<br>
500 g. of flowers of Calendula oficinalis are placed in a wash tunnel and<br>
subjected to a thorough wash with water at about 28oC The flowers are next<br>
comminuted with a comminuting machine. The resultant 500 g of comminuted<br>
matter are subjected to a treatment with a red linear laser diode with a capability of<br>
harmonic generation in a wavelength of 250 nm, a power of 20 watts and a spot of 4<br>
mm of diameter. The treatment is effected by manually displacing the laser generator<br>
through the comminuted matter during 2.5 minutes, so that the whole or most of the<br>
mixture is irradiated. The laser treated matter is next suspended in 2 litres of water at<br>
a temperature of about 20 °C. The suspension is then kept for 12 days at a<br>
temperature of 4 °C. Finally, the separation of the liquid and the solid phase is<br>
effected, first by decantation of the liquid (the solids are pressed to facilitate the se-<br>
paration), and then, by three consecutive press-filtrations with filters of 5, 1 and 0.22<br>
urn at a temperature of about 20 °C. The process yields approximately 1.7 litres of a<br>
solution (aqueous extract) of an ochre colour.<br>
Example 2: The isolation of the polysaccharide of formula I is effected as<br>

Example 3: The polysaccharide of formula I was tested in order to establish its<br>
activity as immune stimulator by quantifying the lymphocyte transformation<br>
activity (LTA). By lymphocyte transformation activity it is meant the fact that the<br>
lymphocytes are transformed from a dormant to an active state, which is necessary to<br>
fight diseases through an immunological mechanism, or to restore the immune<br>
system, which might be weakened by different factors. The tests were performed<br>
according to the literature reference Max, W. et al. Journal of Natural Products, vol.<br>
54. no. 6. pp. 1531-1542 (1991), by adding in vitro a solution of the polysaccharide<br>
of the invention to lymphocytes isolated from mice. The incorporation of thymidine,<br>
which means replication of DNA, was monitored. This incorporation is indicative<br>
both of an increase in lymphocyte number and an increase in lymphocyte activity".<br>
The polysaccharide of formula I presents a LTA of +6203 % with respect to<br>
non stimulated lymphocytes.<br>
