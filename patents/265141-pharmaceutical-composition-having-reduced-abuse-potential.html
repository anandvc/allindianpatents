				<td>PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION HAVING<br>
REDUCED ABUSE POTENTIAL<br>
The present application claims benefit of priority from U.S. Patent Application No. 11/432,226 filed May 12, 2006.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a controlled release agent. The present invention also relates to the use and method for making the same.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Drug abuse has almost become a way of life to a rapidly growing segment of the world population, for example in the United Slates and Canada. It has become the vogue of many of the younger generation to experiment with any type of drug that will produce an emotional, psychological, euphoric, depressive or generally psychedelic experience.<br>
A major problem is the abuse of medicinal opioid formulations by the parenteral route.<br>
Another route of abuse which has become of serious concern is snorting of fine powder obtained from crushed opiod dosage form or the oral ingestion of finely crushed extended release oral dosage form in order to instantaneously obtain the benefit of the total opiod present in the slow release dosage form.<br>
Another phenomenon that has become of concern regarding the use of extended release opiod analgesics is the discovery that they dose dump in the presence of alcohol and release all their content at once.<br>
There has been a lot of concern with regards to the performance of extended release narcortics taught in prior art and currently commercialized. This is because the extended release or controlled release mechanism of current extended release opiod agonists using compositions and methods taught in the prior art is compromised and destroyed in the presence of<br>
alcohol leading to the loss of controlled release effects and complete release or dose dumping of its opiod content.<br>
The danger and economic consequences of dose dumping in the presence of alcohol for current controlled release narcotic analgesics was highlighted when in July 14, 2005 Purdue Pharma voluntarily took its pain-relieving narcotic analgesic Palladone (hydromorphone hydrochloride) capsules off the market. The company took the action on July 13 following an FDA request to withdraw Palladone because of safety concerns. The FDA approved Palladone in September 2004, The drug was launched by Purdue Pharma in February 2006, Palladone was approved for the management of persistent, moderate-to-severe pain in patients requiring continuous, around-the-clock pain relief with a high-potency opioid for an extended period of time. An FDA news release stated that serious and potentially fatal adverse reactions can occur when Palladone extended release capsules are taken together with alcohol.<br>
According to an FDA news release, Palladone is a once-a-day pain management drug containing a very potent narcotic. New data gathered from a company-sponsored study testing the potential effects of alcohol use shows that when Palladone is taken with alcohol the extended release mechanism is harmed which can lead to dose-dumping. The FDA described dose-dumping, as the rapid release of the drug's active ingredient into the bloodstream. The agency's news release pointed out that dose-dumping, even with a low dose of Palladone (12 milligrams), could lead to "serious, or even fatal, adverse events in some patients". The FDA also warned that the risk increases for higher doses of Palladone.<br>
Health Canada also issued an Advisory to warn of serious health risks associated with the consumption of alcohol while taking any slow-release opioid analgesics, following data from Purdue Pharma.<br>
It can be argued that just like in the case of Palladone all powerful pain management drugs such as opiod agonists or narcotic analgesics have serious risks if used incorrectly, and this is particularly true for the current extended release formulations in the prior art or under commercialization. In<br>
fact Health Canada has advised patients receiving other slow-release opioids to be aware that these products may react in a similar way to hydromorphone slow release formulation when co-Ingested with alcohol i.e.. they may be released into the blood quickly (dose-dumping) instead of over extended release time periods, for example 24 hours.<br>
This situation continues to present an unacceptabiy high level of patient risk. There is a great concern that as more patients take current compostions, safety problems will arise since even having one alcoholic drink could have fatal implications. The use of patient information vial label warnings regarding the dangers of using opioids and alcohol concomitantly is not expected to solve this problem. As a matter of fact the FDA has said that the agency doesn't believe that "potentially fatal, adverse events can be effectively managed by label warnings alone. ..."<br>
Health authourities have turned up the heat and are demanding the pharmaceutical companies come clean and put interests of patients first. AccordingJy, to investigate if the same effect occurs with other slow-release drugs, Health Canada requests that ail manufacturers of these products provide information on the interaction between their drug and alcohol; if this is not possible, studies investigating product interactions with alcohol are to be conducted and completed within six months. Health Canada states that the data wilt be assessed within a three-month period and that further action will be taken if required.<br>
From the foregoing there is therefore an urgent and great need for compositions of opiod agonist or narcotic analgesics or abuse-able substances which have a reduced potential for abuse or dose-dumping in the presence of alcohol.<br>
Attempts have been made in the past to control the abuse potential associated with opioid analgesics. Parenteral dose of opioid analgesics are more potent as compared to the same dose administered orally. Therefore, drug abuse is often carried out by the extraction of the opioid from the dosage form, and the subsequent injection of the opioid (using any "suitable" vehicle for injection) in order to achieve a "high." Attempts to curtail abuse have<br>
therefore typically centered around the inclusion in the oral dosage form of an opioid antagonist which is not orally active but which will substantially block the analgesic effects of the opioid if one attempts to dissolve the opioid and administer it parenteraliy.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 3,254,088, describes the preparation of naloxone and its activity as a narcotic antagonist.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 3,493,657, describes the combination of morphine and naloxone as a composition for parenteral use "which has a strong analgesic, as well as antagonistic effect, without the occurrence of undesired or dangerous side effects."<br>
A New York Times article appearing in a July 14, 1970 issue described the oral administration of naloxone to narcotic addicts as a method of treatment. The oral administration of naloxone (in high doses) "makes it impossible for the addict to experience a high no matter how much heroin he uses."<br>
The combination of pentazocine and naloxone has been utilized in tablets available in the United States, commercially available as Talwin® from Sanofi-Winthrop. Talwin® contains pentazocine hydrochloride equivalent to 50 mg base and naloxone hydrochloride equivalent to 0.5 mg base. Talwin® is indicated for the relief of moderate to severe pain. The amount of naloxone present In this combination has no action when taken orally, and will not Interfere with the pharmacologic action of pentazocine. However, this amount of naloxone given by injection has profound antagonistic action to narcotic analgesics. Thus, the inclusion of naloxone is intended to curb a form of abuse of oral pentazocine which occurs when the dosage form is solubilized and injected. Therefore, this dosage has lower potential for parenteral abuse than previous oral pentazocine formulations- However, it is still subject to patient misuse and abuse by the oral route, for example, by the patient taking multiple doses at once.<br>
Sunshine, et al. "Analgesic Efficacy of Pentazocine Versus a Pentazocine-Naloxone Combination Following Oral Administration", Clin. J. Pain, 1988:4:35-40, reported on the effect of the addition of 0.5 mg naloxone<br>
on the analgesic efficacy of pentazocine 50 mg. The combination was found to be significantly less efficacious than pentazocine for the sum of the pain intensity difference (SPID), and for relief and pain intensity difference (PID) at the fourth hour For patients with moderate baseline pain, the combination produced significantly less pain relief than pentazocine for SPID and for relief and PID at hours 3 and 4. In patients with severe baseline pain, there was no significant difference found between pentazocine and the combination of pentazocine plus naloxone.<br>
Wang, et al. "Crossover and Parallel Study of Oral Analgesics", J. Clin Pharmacol 1981; 21:162-8, studied the combination of naloxone 0.25 mg and Percodan® (composed of 4.5 mg oxycodone HC1, oxycodone terephthalate 0.28 mg, aspirin 224 mg, phenacetin 160 mg, and caffeine 32 mg) compared to Percodan® alone, and placebo in a crossover study of patients with chronic pain. The combination had lower mean scores than Percodan® alone for most of the analgesic hourly parameters in the later hours of the trial. However, for the summary variables, the combination showed no significant difference from either placebo or Percodan®.<br>
A fixed combination of buprenorphine and naloxone was introduced in 1991 in New Zealand (Temgesic®, Reckitt &amp; Colman) for the treatment of pain.<br>
A fixed combination therapy comprising tiJidine (50 mg) and naloxone (4 mg) has been available in Germany for the management of severe pain since 1978 (Valoron®, Goedecke). The rationale for the combination of these drugs is effective pain relief and the prevention of tilidine addiction through naloxone-tnduced antagonisms at the morphine receptor.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,955 (Pachter, et al.) described orally effective analgesic compositions which upon parenteral administration do not produce analgesia, euphoria, or physical dependence, and thereby prevent parenteral abuse of the analgetic agents. Such compositions contained from about 0.1 mg to about 10 mg naloxone per analgetic oral duse. This reference was not concerned with oral abuse of opioids.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 3,493,657 (Lewenstein, et al.) described compositions comprising naloxone and morphine or oxymorphone, which compositions were said to provide a strong analgesic effect without the occurrence of undesired side effects such as hallucinations.<br>
U.S. Pat No. 4,457,933 {Gordon, et al.) described a method for decreasing both the oral and parenteral abuse potential of strong analgesic agents such as oxycodone, propoxyphene and pentazocine, by combining an analgesic dose of the opioid with naloxone in a specific, relatively narrow range. Oxycodone-naloxone compositions having a ratio of 2.5-5:1 parts by weight and pentazocine-naloxone compositions having a ratio of 16-50:1 parts by weight were preferred. The dose of naloxone which was to be combined with the opioid is stated to substantially eliminate the possibility of either oral or parenteral abuse of the opioid without substantially affecting the oral analgesic activity thereof.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,582,835 (Lewis) describes a method of treating pain by administering a sublingually effective dose of buprenorphine with naloxone. Lewis describes dosage ratios of naloxone to buprenorphine from 1:3 to 1:1 for parenteral administration, and from 1:2 to 2:1 for sublingual administration.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 6,627,635 teaches a method of preventing abuse of opioid dosage forms wherein an analgesicalfy effective amount of an orally active opioid agonist is combined with an opioid antagonist into an oral dosage form which would require at least a two-step extraction process to be separated from the opioid agonist, the amount of opioid antagonist including being sufficient to counteract opioid effects if extracted together with the opioid agonist and administered parenterally.<br>
U.S. Pat. 6,696,088 discloses tamper-resistant oral opioid agonist formulations comprising (i) an opioid agonist in releasable form and (ii) a sequestered opioid antagonist which is substantially not released when the dosage form is administered intact, such that the ratio of the amount of antagonist released from said dosage form after tampering to the amount of said antagonist released from said intact dosage form is about 4:1 or greater,<br>
wherein said agonist and antagonist are interdispersed and are not isolated from each other in two distinct layers.<br>
Despite all the above attempts in the prior art to address the problem of drug abuse, the problem persists partly because of design faults in the compositions and the addicts coming up with creative ways to beat the anti drug abuse mechanism. At present the problem is escalating at an alarming rate with devastating financial and social consequences.<br>
Therefore, there is still a need to develop a stable drug delivery device that can be reproducibly manufactured and have a desired effect of reducing potential for abuse.<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The following drawings are illustrative of embodiments of the invention and are not meant to limit the scope of the invention as encompassed by the claims:<br>
FIGURE 1 shows, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention, data regarding the release of an active pharmaceutical ingredient over a sustained-release period in varying concentrations of alcohol.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Certain embodiments of the present invention relate to a novel composition and to a method of using and preparing same in order to reduce the potential for abuse of an addictive substance. This is accomplished by the use of a paste composition. The addictive substance may be, without limitation, an opiod agonist, a narcotic analgesic, barbiturates, central nervous system stimulants, and/or tranquilizers. Prior to incorporation within a paste, an addictive substance may be in any suitable form known in the art, liquid, semi-solid or solid, for example, without limitation, powder, granules, spheroids, pellets, microspheres, nanospheres, microcapsules, or crystals, and may be homogenously or non-homogenously dispersed in the paste.<br>
The novel composition of the present invention can be used in any delivery device such as, and without being limited thereto, a sustained release, pulsed release, delayed release and/or controlled release device that controls the release of one or more active pharmaceutical ingredients.   The device can be a solid unit dosage form, The device can comprise a paste that comprises, for example, one or more granules, one or more crystals, one or more pellets and/or one or more spheroids. In a specific embodiment, the device is a stable single homogeneous unit controlled release device which controls the release rate, without significant variability, and with a reproducible controlled release rate.<br>
The composition may be administered in any suitable manner using any suitable formulation and/or dispensing device. For example and without being limited thereto, the composition can be in the form of a suitable device for in vivo oral, vaginal, anaf, ocular, subcutaneous, intramuscular administration or for implantation. The composition may also be used for in vitro or ex vivo delivery of an addictive substance. It may be targeted at specific sites in the gastrointestinal tract or to specific organs. It may be applied buccally and transdermally in a pouch or patch. It is evident that the physical state of the formulation and the particular method of application may vary accordingly.<br>
Paste compositions may be useful in formulation of addictive substances to reduce the abuse potential of the addictive substance, for example via alcohol extraction. However, it will be understood that the utility of paste compositions may not be limited to addictive substances, and may also be useful in formulation of any active ingredient or substance.<br>
The term "active ingredient" or "active substance" means any compound which has biological, chemical, or physiological utility including, without limitation, active pharmaceutical ingredient, drug, naturally occurring compound, nucleic acid compound, peptide compound, nutraceutical, agricultural or nutritional ingredient or synthetic drug.<br>
The term "'addictive substance" means any compound upon which a user may develop a psychic or physical dependence, including, without<br>
limitation, active pharmaceutical ingredient, drug, naturally occurring compound, or synthetic drug.<br>
Many interchangeable terms are commonly used to describe the psychic or physical dependence of people upon compounds. The term addiction is most commonly used when talking about the strong analgesics or opiod agonist or abuse-able substances. The strong analgesics or opiod agonist or abuse-able substances, in contrast to the weaker agents such as aspirin, acetaminophen, and the like, are employed in the relief of more severe pain. They usually produce a euphoric effect when crushed and swallowed, snorted and "shoot" parenterally. When taken as oral controlled release composition there is usually no significant euphoria.<br>
Addiction can develop to the barbiturates and strong analgesic agents or opiod agonist or abuse-able substances, in the sense of the term "addiction" as defined by the Committee on Problems of Drug Dependence of The National Research Council, namely, a compulsion to take the drug and to increase the dose, with the development of psychic and sometimes physical dependence on the effects of the drug, so that the development of means to continue the administration of the drug becomes an important motive in the addict's existence.<br>
Addiction to narcotics or narcotic-like strong analgesics often occurs by the legitimate chronic oral or parenteral administration of these agents in the alleviation of deep pain. More commonly, however, addiction to these agents occurs when the psychologically unbalanced or thrill-seeking individual looking for an escape from the realities of life finds his escape in the euphoria produced by the oral or parenteral administration of strong analgesics or opiod agonist or abuse-able substances. Euphoria is generally defined as a feeling of well-being. Euphoria can be produced in many ways, e.g., an exhilarating experience, alcohol, stimulants, depressants, narcotics, etc. For the purpose of this disclosure, "euphoria" is defined as an abnormal state of well-being produced by the parenteral administration of strong analgesics.<br>
Addictive substance encompasses the terms "abuse-able substances", "euphoric analgesics" and "strong analgesics," often called narcotic or<br>
narcotiollke analgesics or opiod agonist, including, for example, those chemical agents which upon oral or parenteral administration are capable of maintaining or partially maintaining a known addict addicted to heroin or the like without substantial withdrawal symptoms. For the purpose of this disclosure, a "strong analgesic'* can also be described as any analgesic agent whose analgesic, euphoric or dependence producing actions are negated by the parenteral administration of an opiod antagonist.<br>
Examples of some of the opiod agonists or narcotic analgesics contemplated for use in this invention include alfentanil, aliylprodtne, alphaprodine, anileridine, benzyl morphine, bezitramide, buprenorphine, butorphanol, cfonitazene, codeine, desomorphine, dextromoramide, dezocine, diampromlde, diamorphone, dihydrocodeine, dihydromorphine, dimenoxadol, dimepheptanol, dimethylthiambutene, dioxaphetyl butyrate, dipipanone, eptazocine, ethoheptazine, ethylmethylthiarnbutene, ethylrnorphine, etonitazene, etorphine, dihydroetorphine, fentanyi hydrocodone, hydromorphone, hydroxypethidine, isomethadone, ketobemidone, levorphanol, ievophenacylmorphan, (ofentanil, meperidine, meptazinol, metazocine, methadone, metopon, morphine, myrophine, narceine, nicomorphine, norlevorphanol, normethadone, nalorphine, nalbuphene, normorphine, norpipanone, opium, oxycodone, oxymorphone, papaveretum, pentazocine, phenadoxone, phenomorphan, phenazocine, phenoperidine, piminodine, piritramide, propheptazine, promedol, properidine, propoxyphene, sufentanil, tramadol,tilidine, alpha prod ine, dextroporpoxyphene, propiram, profadol, phenampromide, thiambutene, pholcodeine , 3-trans-dimethylamino-4-pheny1-4-trans-carbethoxy-delta-cycfohexene, 3-dimethylamino-0-(4-methoxyphenylcarbamoyl)-propiophenone oxime, (-)beta-2-hydroxy^,9-drrnethyl-5-phenyl-6,7- benzomorphan, (-)2'-hydroxy~2-(3-methyl-2-butenyl)-9-methyl~5-phenyl-6,7-benzomorphan, ptrinitramide, (-)a[pha-5,9-dt"ethy1 -2*-hydroxy-2-methyl-6,7-benzomorphan, ethyl-1-(2-dimethylaminoethyl}"4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-3-methyf-4-oxo-6-phenylindole-2-carboxylate, 1-Benzoytmethyi-2,3-dimethyl-3-(m-hydroxyphenyt)-piperidineI N-allyl-7alpha-(1-(R)~hydroxy-1-methylbuty()-6,14-endo-ethanotetrahydron ororipavine, (-)2'-hydroxy-2-rnethy!-<br>

Addictive substances also include drugs most commonly employed for illicit purposes (to bring about a "high", euphoria, excitement, stupor, sleep deprivation etc.,) such as the barbiturates, lysergic acid diethylamide <lsd mescaline marijuana heroin and the like central nervous system stimulants amphetamines sedative hypnotics some of major minor tranquilizers promazines rneprobamate diazepines></lsd>
Many addictive substances are commonly used in medicine for the legitimate treatment of various conditions and therefore have a limited availability in our society. While these agents are a necessary part of modern medicine, it would be highly desirable (1) to produce new drugs that have reduced drug abuse potential or (2) to "denature" the old agents to prevent their illicit use. The pharmaceutical industry has been striving to achieve the first goal for many years but most regrettably has only achieved very moderate success. If one focuses on the strong analgesics, it becomes apparent that much effort and money has been expended to produce chemicals possessing good analgesic activity but little or no addictive liability. While good progress has been made as evidenced, for example, by the development of propoxyphene as a replacement for codeine and pentazocine as a replacement for morphine or meperidine, these compounds are still reported in the medical literature to be addictive and/or euphoric and subjected to abuse by crushing and dissolving and heating/evaporation of the drug composition to enable immediate access to the drug by swallowing, inhalation, snorting, "shooting" or parenteral administration. Furthermore, some of these agents have undesirable side effects, i.e., bad hallucinations, etc.<br>
The compositions or devices of the present invention can also contain other active ingredients. These include, amongst others and tor example, opiod antagonists (such as naloxone), aspirin, phenacetin, caffeine, acetaminophen, antihistamines, homatropine methylbromide, phenyltoloxarnine citrate, barbiturates, or the like, or multiple combinations thereof. Also included within the scope of the present invention are those compositions comprising narcotic analgesics in combination with non narcotic analgesics, antitussive preparations which contain narcotic or narcotic-like cough suppressants such as codeine, dihyrocodeinone, pholcodeine, and the like. Other products comprising a narcotic or narcotic-!ike composition for use as an antispasmotic in the gastro-intestinal tract, such as Camphorated Opium Tincture, U.S.P., Opium Tincture. U.S.P., Opium extract, N.F., and the like can be an integral part of certain examples of the present invention.<br>
The term "paste" means a pharmaceutical form of thick or stiff consistency. A paste may also comprise solids of less than 1000 microns dipersed therein. A paste can also be described as a liquid or semi-solid matrix or magma or paste which is non-newtonian, thixotropic or pseudoplastic. A paste typically comprises an addictive substance. However, a paste may comprise other active ingredients with or without the presence of an addictive substance. Furthermore, a singular paste composition may be used or combinations of two or more paste compositions having different release profiles and/or comprising different active substances may be used. The release profiles provided by the paste compositions of the present invention may be advantageously used in the formulation of any active ingredient.<br>
Two or more populations of pastes with different release properties in a singular or multiple dosage unit(s) may be used for delivery of the active substances. One or more active substances can be delivered similarly, by use of multiple paste populations. For example, formulating two active substances in two paste compositions, respectively may be particularly useful if the substances are incompatible or are to act seperateiy or at different onset of<br>
action. The different population of paste can be encapsulated or delivered in any other suitable holding or dispensing device.<br>
A paste may comprise one or more controlled release agent, and/or one or more clays such as bentonite and/or one or more fillers in a pharmaceutical suitable vehicle, and optionally materials selected from disintegrants, humectants, surfactants and stabilizers. In certain examples, a paste may comprise one or more controlled release agent, and/or one or more clays such as bentonite and/or one or more fillers in a non-aqueous vehicle, and optionally materials selected from disintegrants, humectants, surfactants and stabilizers. In certain examples, a paste may comprise one or more controlled release agent, and/or one or more clays such as bentonite and/or one or more fillers in an aqueous vehicle, optionally comprising an emutsffier for mixing with oily, fatty or waxy substances, and optionally materials selected from disintegrants, humectants, surfactants and stabilizers,<br>
A paste composition may be formulated such that physicochemical properties of the paste reduces or prevents dose dumping of active substances. For example, a paste composition may be formulated such that physicochemical properties of the paste reduces or prevents dose dumping of addictive substances in the presence of alcohol, and discourages drug abuse by mode of crushing, milling or grinding the dosage form to powder or heating the dosage form to vapour and snorting or inhalation by the nasal route or dissolving to abuse via the parenteral route.<br>
The temn "polymeric coating" or "polymeric coat" means any coating which is formed by polymerization of one or more monomers to form linear or branched or cross-linked rnacromolecules. The coating may be variously characterized as a coating, layer, membrane, shell, capsule, or the like, and substantially surrounds or envelope a core particle. Where a device of the present invention comprises more than one polymeric coat, a first polymeric coat substantially surrounds or envelopes a core particle, a second polymeric coat substantially surrounds or envelopes the first polymeric coat, and so forth. Polymeric coats may take the form and composition of any known<br>
compatible controlled-release coat, for example a pH sensitive coat a water repeilant coat, or an aqueous solvent based coat, or a water soluble coat.<br>
In certain examples, a polymeric coat may be prepared from a homogenous mixture comprising a water soluble ge! forming polymer and a water insoluble organosolubie polymer in an organosolvent. While such a preparation may be substantially nonaqueous, small amounts of water may be used or tolerated, for example, less than about 20% (v/v), less than about 10% (v/v), less than about 5% (v/v) or less than about 2% (v/v) of the polymeric coating composition before application to or incorporation into the controlled-re lease delivery device.<br>
The terms "sustained release", "pulsed release", "delayed release" and "controlled release" are used interchangeably in this application and are defined for purposes of the present invention as the release of an active ingredient from a delivery device at such a rate that when a dose of the active ingredient is administered in the sustained release, pulsed release, delayed release or controlled-release device, concentrations (levels) of the active ingredient are maintained within a desired range but below toxic levels over a selected period of time.  In the case of in vivo administration, concentrations (levels) of the active ingredient could be measured in blood or plasma, for example. When administered in vivo the sustained release, pulsed release, delayed release or controlled-release device of the present invention allows for useful plasma concentration of an active ingredient to be maintained for longer than in the case of Immediate-release forms.<br>
The controlled release profile may be modified on the basis of many factors pertaining to the polymeric coats, for example, without limitation, through the types of polymers used, the order in which they are deposited, the ratios of the polymers in the mix and the nature of their interaction. The controlled-release profile can also be modified by a variety of factors relating to the delivery device and the route of administration as outlined for example, in US Application No. 20070003619, published January 4, 2007. For example, the sustained-release period will vary depending upon the solubility of the active ingredient, the rate of clearance of the active ingredient from the<br>
intended site of administration, the size of the core particle, the amount of the active ingredient initially present in the core particle, the presence of other compounds within the core particle that affect the rate of release of the active ingredient, the permeability of the polymeric coating(s) to the active pharmaceutical ingredient, and the rate of degradation of the polymeric coating(s), as well as other factors.<br>
Release control may be effected or optimized through the types of polymers used, the order in which they are deposited, the number of polymeric coats, the width of polymeric coats, the ratios of the polymers in the mix and the nature of their interaction.<br>
It is commonly known to the narcotic enforcement agencies and others in the medical trades that a substantial amount of the strong analgesics destined for legitimate medicinal use are diverted to illicit use through dishonest or careless handling, in many instances, these drugs are obtained by the addict or potential addict by theft or casual prescribing practice by the physician.<br>
It is known from experience that the true narcotic addict must feed his habit by the crushing and/or dissolving and heating and/or evaporation of the drug composition to enable immediate access to the drug by swallowing, inhalation, snorting, "shooting" or parenteral route (mainlining) to obtain the maximum euphoric effect The potential addict or thrill-seeker will also experiment in the same manner. Unfortunately, a substantial amount of the legitimate strong analgesics formulated in oral dosage form are diverted to illicit parenteral use. Since the oral dosage forms of these drugs diverted from legitimate channels must be easily crushed, dissolved and heated /evaporated in order to get a form in which it can be administered to produce the desired euphoria, it follows that if these oral dosage forms are in some way rendered difficult or impossible to crush, dissolve, heat/evaporate or extract and made unpleasant for abuse via swallowing, snorting, inhalation and "shooting" or parenteral use the addict or potential addict will be cut off from this particular supply of euphoric drugs. Obviously, oral activity must be retained rf a useful medicament is to be provided.<br>
Incorporating a pharmaceutical drug, that is an addictive substance, in a paste composition may be useful for (1) reducing at least one mode of abuse, for example, the illicit use by snorting/inhalation, parenteral administration, or crushing and oral ingestion of dosage forms intended for oral administration; (2) reducing dose dumping, for example in the presence of alcohol; or (3) timed or extended release compositions and/or devices which despite its pseudoplastic or thixotropic nature maintains its integrity sufficiently to perform.its controlled release functions during transit in the GIT.<br>
Paste compositions and comprise an addictive substance materials selected from oily, waxy or fatty substances, clays or controlled release agents can discourage abuse and make it harder to abuse by mode of crushing, dissolving, heating to cause evaporation and snorting, "shooting" or<br>
inhalation.<br>
Paste compositions may optionally comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable nasal irritant. A nasal irritant can produce nasal irritation and annoyance feeling when the composition is brought in contact with the nasal membrane. The irritant agent is not in amounts sufficient to precipitate allergic type reactions or immune response upon snorting. U.S. Pat, No. 7,157,103 (Sackler) issued Jan. 2, 2007, suggests the use of various irritants in preparing pharmamentical  formulations including, for example, capsaicin, a capsaicin analog with similar type properties as capsaicin, and the like- Some capsaicin analogues or derivatives include for example, resiniferatoxin, tinyatoxin, heptanoylisobutylamide, heptanoyi guaiacylamide, other isobutyiamides or guatacylamides, dihydrocapsaicin, homovanillyl octylester, nonanoyl vanitiyiainide, or other compounds of the class known as vanilloids. Resiniferatoxin is described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,290,816 (Blumberg), issued Mar. 1, 1994. U.S. Pat. No. 4,812,446 (Brand), issued Mar. 14, 1989, describes capsaicin analogs and methods for their preparation.<br>
With the inclusion of an irritant (e.g., capsaicin) in a dosage form, when the dosage form is tampered with, the capsaicin imparts a burning or discomforting quality to the abuser to preferably discourage the inhalation, injection, or oral administration of the tampered dosage form, and preferably<br>
to prevent the abuse of the dosage form. Suitable capsaicin compositions include capsaicin (trans 8-methy!-N-vanillyl-6-noneamide) or analogues thereof in a concentration between about 0.00125% and 50% by weight, preferably between about 1 and about 7.5% by weight, and most preferably, between about 1 and about 5% by weight of the dosage form.<br>
Paste compositions are formulated such that an addictive substance comprised therein is not easily soluble and immediately available upon crushing and attempt at dissolving it for intravenous injection or to get access to the total drug immediately upon oral ingestion of the crushed dosage form is not met with easy success.<br>
A paste composition makes it harder for dose dumping of an addictive substance in the presence of alcohol or during co-ingestion of alcohol. For example, Figure 1 shows that a controlled release profile a paste composition comprising oxycodone is maintained in varying concentrations of ethanol.<br>
A paste composition will typically comprise a controlled release agent or an oily, fatty or waxy substance, or a clay. When present in a paste composition the concentration of a controlled release agent may be from about 2% to about 90%. When present in a paste composition the concentration of an oily substance may be from about 3% to about 99%. When present in a paste composition the concentration of a fatty substance may be from about 0.5 % to about 70%.

Hygroscopic or aqueous materials may be used with caution. Limited quantities have been incorporated in certain compositions. For example, a paste composition may comprise an aqueous vehicle in combination with a non-aqueous vehicle in the presence of an emulsifier.<br>
The composition of the invention comprising one or more active substances may be made by any method wherein the quantity or ratio and type of clays, controlled release agents, oily, fatty or waxy substance and optionally fillers is sufficient to form a paste, liquid or semi solid matrix, magma of the entire composition. Preferably, the entire quantity of the composition is dissolved, dispersed, emulsified or suspended in the oily, fatty or waxy substances. Typically, the clays, controlled release agent and oily, fatty or waxy substances are combined, such as by blending or mixing under high shear until the clays, controlled release agent is completely dissolved, or homogeneous paste is formed. The components may be added separately one after the other, The active substance is added under high shear to form a homogeneous non Newtonian, thixotropic or pseudoplastic paste or liquid/semi solid matrix. The order of incorporation depends on the outcome to be achieved. A cold process under room temperature conditions is preferred, however solid substances may be heated to their liquid state prior to incorporation.<br>
Alternatively, the composition may be processed in a jacketed vessel which allows precise control of the processing temperature. Other pharmaceutically acceptable additives, such as those described above, may be incorporated before, after, or during the addition of controlled release agents or narcortic analgesics.<br>
The manufacture of the composition of this invention is relatively simple. Formulation may be prepared at room temperature. Typically, no heating of the ingredients are required. However, when materials that are solid at room temperature are to be used, heating may be necessary. Solvents having high volatile properties are typically not used. Examples of such volatile solvents are: benzene, toluene, xylene, hexane, cyclohexanole, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexanote, dioxane, ethytacetate, acetone, amylacetate, propylacetate, methylethy I ketone, ethylcellosolve, isopropylalcohol, methanol, ethyialcohol and isoamylalcohoL<br>
In certain examples solid non-dissolved particles may be dispersed within a paste. The solid part/cles will be of a size such that the paste composition maintains its consistency/viscosity and homogeneity at room temperature conditions and during storage. The solid particles may take any convenient form, including, for example, granules, spheroids, pellets, microspheres, nanospheres, microcapsules, or crystals and can be prepared by wet or dry granulation, by extrusion spheronization, by powder or solution layering, by microencapsulation techniques, by milling and compression techniques or other suitable known techniques. In certain examples, different populations of coated particles can be mixed together within a paste composition.<br>
In certain examples, the particle size of solid materials is less than about 1000 microns and the composition maintains its consistency/viscosity and homogeneity at room temperature conditions and during storage. In certain other examples, the particle size of solid materials is less than about 500, 200, 100, or 50 microns and the composition maintains its consistency/viscosity and homogeneity at room temperature conditions and during storage. In certain further, examples the solid particles are sfficiently small such that the paste composition is essentially a homogeneous non-Newtonian, thixotroplc or pseudoplastic paste.<br>
A singular paste composition may be used or a combination of two or more paste compositions may be used. In certain examples, a single paste composition may comprise one or more active substances. In certain other<br>
examples, two or more paste compositions may have different release profiles (for example, controlled release and immediate release) and may comprise the same or different active substance(s). Multiple paste compositions may be useful for delivery of one or more active substances. For example, multiple paste compositions may be useful for delivery of two or more substances that are incompatible or are to act seperately or at a different onset of action, (f desired, multiple paste compositions may be encapsulated together or delivered together in any other suitable dispensing device.<br>
In certain examples, paste compositions are enveloped by capsules, for example, soft of hard capsules. While both soft and hard capsules may be used, hard capsules may be particularly useful. In certain examples, the capsule is a hard gelatin capsule or is made of a metal or alloy of metals from the periodic table, cellulose ether, vegetable or animal origin.<br>
Capsules are often made from gelatin. Gelatin capsules are traditionally divided into two general groups; hard shell gelatin capsules and soft gelatin capsules (softgels). In certain examples of hard shell gelatin capsules, the capsule is typically in equilibrium with a relative humidity of less than 20%; is typically formulated with a low ratio of dry plasticizer to dry gelatin (low amounts of plasticizer); and is typically made of two separately formed, cooperating, telescoping shells. On the other hand, softgels are most commonly in equilibrium with a relative humidity of between 20% and 30%, are typically formulated with a high ratio of dry plasticizer to dry gelatin (higher amounts of plasticizer); and are typically formed in a unitary process such as a rotary die encapsulation process.<br>
Capsules from materials other than gelatin will also be known to the skilled person. For example, US Patent Appin. Pub. No. 20060099246 (Tanner) published May 11, 2000 pertains to a non-gelatin soft capsule system having a predominantly starch and gelling canrageenan based shell. Carrageenan is a collective term for polysaccharides prepared by alkaline extraction (and modification) from red seaweed (Rhodophycae), mostly of genus Qhondrus, Eucheuma, Gigartina and Iridaea. Different seaweeds produce different carrageenans. Carrageenan consists of alternating 3-linked-<br>
beta-D-galactopyranose and 4-linked-alpha-D-galactopyranose units. Most, if not all, of the galactose units are substituted with sulfate ester groups. As another example, US Patent Appln. Pub.

As another example, PCT publication WO 01/37817 describes a soft capsule based on thermoplastic starch (TPS) with high softener content. As another example, US Patent Appln. Pub.

la certain examples, a controlled release composition may be filled into a capsule or dispensing device alone and utilized, or it may be co-filled with non controlled release composition containing opiod antagonist and/or immediate release non narcotic analgesics or other pharmaceutical^ active substances.<br>
Paste compositions allow for a clean break during formation or dosing ("stringing") into gelatin capsule or device. With regard to two-piece capsules, the paste composition should be of sufficient viscosity to prevent possible splashing of the bushings that may occur and which could contaminate the area of overlap between the capsule body and cap and prevent a good seal from being formed.<br>
Capsules comprising paste compositions may be prepared by any number of known suitable techniques. The fill material used in a capsule generally contains a pharmaceutical dissolved or dispersed in a carrier that is compatible with the capsule wall.<br>
In certain examples, a liquid or semi-solid matrix, magma or paste is filled in a gelatin capsule for which dissolution using a USP dissolution tester is not significantly different by the rotation speed of the basket or paddle in the speed range from about 25 rpm to about 150 rpm, or at about 50 rpm and about 100 rpm or at about 50 rpm and about 75 rpm or at about 100 rpm and about 150 rpm. The rotation speed does not interact with or compromise the integrity of the composition and release mechanism. Compositions that meet these requirements perform consistently in the gastrointestinal tract without fear of collapse or disintegration, They are typically not perturbed, crushed or damaged by gastrointestinal tract content, resident time or motility. These types of composition may be prized for their reliability.<br>
Compositions comprising addictive substances, clays, controlled release agents or oily, waxy or fatty substances are formulated to be compatible with the gelatin capsule shell and not compromise the integrity of the capsule shell.<br>

A capsule or other particles may be coated with a polymeric coating. Methods of polymeric coating are well known in the art. For example, a core particle may be coated in a fluidized bed or pan, or by spraying or painting a polymeric coat onto a core particle. Another known option is a fluid bed bottom spray coaler by having particles suspended in an air stream, and an aqueous dispersion of a polymeric coating composition is sprayed on to the particles. Various conventional coating apparatuses may be employed to facilitate this including, for example, a centrifugal fluidized bed coating apparatus, a pan coating apparatus, or a fluidized bed granulating coating apparatus.<br>

the present invention is used for treating a horse. In another example, a delivery device of the present invention is used for treating a human being.<br>
A medical condition or dose dumping may be prevented or treated by administering to a patient a paste composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of an addictive substance.<br>
in certain examples of methods of preparing or using a paste composition, the administration in man or animal may be internal, such as oral or parenteral. Such internal parenteral administration includes but is not limited to intravascular, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intradermal, intrathecal, and intracavitary routes of administration, as well as application to the external surface of an internal bodily organ, such as during a surgical or laparoscopic procedure. The administration may be topical, including administration to the skin or to a mucosal surface, including the oral, vaginal, rectal surfaces, to the surface of the eye, to the nasal passages, or to the ear canal.<br>
The composition may also be in the form of a solid. The means and area of application will depend on the particular condition that is being treated. The composition may be dispensed using any suitable formulation and/or dispensing device. For example, it may be taken orally, implanted, intravenously or as a depot. It may be targeted at specific sites in the gastrointestinal tract (GU) or to specific organs. As another example, the composition may also be applied buccally and transdermally in a pouch or patch.<br>
The composition may be applied to bodies of water, such as rivers, lakes, or oceans, to the atmosphere, or to land. It is evident that the physical state of the formulation and the particular method of application may vary accordingly.<br>
Solid particles may be prepared by conventional techniques. The preferred technique is by dry or wet granulation of an addictive substance and excipients such as solubuiizing agents, emulsifying agents, suspending agents, fillers, compression agents, stabilizers, pH altering agents, buffers, lubricants, and gjidants.<br>
Fillers, such as lactose, and compression agents such as microcrystaliine cellulose, lubricants such as magnesium stearate and glidants such silicone dioxide may, in certain examples, be included in the core. The core onto which the coating is applied contains the active component. The core may be a tablet, capsule, caplet, pellet, spherical or irregular in shape.<br>
In certain examples, swellable polymeric materials such as hydrogels that swell and expand significantly are included in the core.<br>
Excipients may be homogenously mixed with an active ingredient in a core particle.

Excipients are biologically inert ingredients which enhance the therapeutic effect. The filler or diluent (eg lactose or sorbitol)is a bulking agent, providing a quantity of material which can accurately be formed into a tablet. The binders and adhesives(eg methyl cellulose or gelatin) hold the ingredients together so that they form a tablet and hold together. Lubricants (eg magnesium stearate or polyethylene glycol) are added to improve powder flow so that the die fills accurately, they also reduce the friction between the tablet and the machine so that the process progresses smoothly and uniformly.<br>
Antiadherents are used to reduce the adhesion between the powder (granules) and the punch faces and thus prevent tablet sticking to the<br>
punches<br>
Binders hold the ingredients in a tablet together. Binders ensure that tablets and granules can be formed with required mechanical strength. Binders may be selected from starches, sugars, cellulose or modified cellulose such as hydroxypropyl cellulose, lactose, or sugar alcohols like xylitol, sorbitol or maltitol.  Solution binders are dissolved in a solvent (for<br>
example water or alcohol and used in wet granulation processes. Examples of solution binders are gelatin, cellulose, cellulose derivatives, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, starch, sucrose and polyethylene glycol. Dry binders are added to a powder blend, either after a wet granulation step, or as part of a direct powder compression. Examples of dry binders are cellulose, methyl cellulose, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyethylene glycol. A commonly used binder or compression agent is microcrystalline cellulose.  Microcrystalline and powdered cellulose products are sold under the tradenames Avicel.TM, PH (FMC Corporation, Philadelphia, Pa.) and Soika Floc.TM. (Penwest Company, Patterson N.Y.).  Microcrystalline cellulose may be used in various techniques such as direct compression, dry granulation, wet granulation, or extrusion-spheronization.<br>
Compression agents are materials that may be compacted. Compression agents may be added to increase the overall hardness of a core particle. Compression agents have inherently high compatibility due to properties of plastic deformation and limited elastic recovery. Non-limiting examples of materials that find use as compression agents are microcrystalline cellulose, silicrfied microcrystalline cellulose (for example Prosolv™ produced by JRS Pharma), oxidized polyethylene, calcium hydrogen phosphate dehydrate, dextrate, or sugar.<br>
Fillers or diluents are added for bulk to fill out the size of a tablet or capsule, making it practical to produce and convenient for the consumer to use. Fillers/diluents are typically inert, compatible with the other components of the formulation, non-hygroscopic, soluble, relatively cheap, compactible, and preferably tasteless or pleasant tasting. Plant cellulose (pure plant filler) is a popular filler in tablets or hard gelatin capsules. Dibasic calcium phosphate is another popular tablet filler. A range of vegetable fats and oils can be used in soft gelatin capsules. Other examples of fillers include: lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, sorbitol, and, calcium carbonate. Fillers/diluents are typically selected from microcrystalline cellulose, plant cellulose, calcium phosphate, mannitol, sorbitol, xylitol, glucitol, ducitol, inositiol, arabinitol; arabttol, galactitol, iditol, allitol, fructose, sorbose, glucose, xylose, trehalose.<br>

Glidants are used to improve the flowability of the powder or granules or both. Some examples of glidant(s) are silicon dioxide, starch, calcium silicate, Cabosil, Syloid. and silicon dioxide aerogels. Typically, silicon dioxide is used.<br>
Lubricants prevent ingredients from clumping together and from sticking to the tablet punches or capsule filling machine. Lubricants also ensure that tablet formation and injection can occur with low friction between the solid and die wall. Some examples of lubricants) are alkali stearates such as magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, zinc stearate, polyethylene glycol, adipic acid, hydrogenated vegetable oils, sodium chloride, sterotex, glycerol monastearate, talc, polyethylene glycol, sodium benzoate, sodium lauryl sulfate, magnesium iauryl sulfate, sodium stearyl fumarate, light mineral oil and the like may be employed. Waxy fatty acid esters, such as glyceryl behenate, sold as "Compritol" products, can be used. Other useful commercial lubricants include "Stear-O-Wet" and "Myvatex TL". Common minerals like talc or silica, and fats, e.g. vegetable stearin, glycerol monostearate, magnesium stearate or stearic acid are typically used lubricants.<br>
