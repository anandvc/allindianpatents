				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention concerns an internal combustion engine with a 2-stage turbocharger and an intercooler in the connection duct between the compressor of the low-pressure stage and the compressor of the high-pressure stage.<br>
An internal combustion engine with such features is, for example, known from DE 19961610 A1. Although an intercooler is provided there in the connection duct between the compressor of the low-pressure stage and that of the high-pressure stage, it remains open how this intercooler is designed.<br>
It is therefore the task of this invention to create an intercooler which does justice to these spatial limitations on the internal combustion engine in the area between the compressor of the low-pressure stage and that of the high-pressure stage.<br>
in the internal combustion engine of the type described this task has been solved by invention of an intercooler of the type specified in Claim 1.<br>
Design-related advantages of the solution in this invention are indicated in the subclaims.<br>
The intercooler in this invention is characterised by an extremely small, but effective design. The fact that the cooling insert is desigend as a cartridge and can be installed in a specialty designed section of the connection duct between the low-pressure compressor of the turbocharger and the high-pressure compressor of the turbocharger and that, with its wall, this section of the connection duct forms the outer wall of the intercooler makes it quite easy both to manufacture these components and to fit them between the two turbocharger stages. Consequently, a sufficiently large cooling effect is achieved because on the outside the cooling pipes are provided with a large number of cooling ribs which ensure sufficient heat exchange.<br>
In the following the intercooler in the invention is explained in greater detail by means of an example shown in the drawing. The drawing shows:<br>

and interceding between the low-pressure stage and the high-pressure stage, Fig. 2:    an example of the cooling insert in the invention in cross-sectional view, Fig. 3:    a cover associated with the exemplary model as per Fig. 2,<br>

Fig. 4: an example of a connection-duct section between the compressors of the two turbocharger stages as part of the intercooler in the invention,<br>
Fig. 5: an example of the intercoofer in the invention using the cooling insert as per Fig. 2, the cover as per Fig. 3 and the connection-duct section as per Fig. 4,<br>
Fig. 5: a cross-section of version shown in Fig. 5, along the sectional line Vf-VI indicated there.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a turbocharged internal combustion engine 1 whose exhaust-gas header pipe connected with the output ducts of the cylinders is marked with 2 and whose charge-air header pipe connected with the input ducts of the cylinders is marked with 3. To the internal combustion engine 1 is allocated a 2-stage turbocharger whose high-pressure stage 4 is provided with a turbine 6 driving a compressor 5 and whose low-pressure stage 7 is provided with a turbine 9 driving a compressor 8. The turbine 6 of the high-pressure stage 4 is connected with the exhaust-gas header pipe 2 via an exhaust-gas duct 10 and via a connection duct 11 with the turbine 9 of the low-pressure stage 7. The compressor 5 of the high-pressure stage 4 is connected with the charge-air header pipe 3 via a charge-air pipe 12 and via a connection line 13 with the compressor 8 of the low-pressure stage 7. The connection pipe 13 is provided with an intercooler 14. This intercooler 14 is designed as in the invention and is described in the following details:<br>
The intercooler 14 in the invention is composed of a cooling insert 15 - see Fig. 2 - in the charge-air-conducting connection duct 13, through which cooling insert a cooling medium flows, and of a specially designed section 16 of the connection duct 13 - see Fig. 3, 4 -, whereby in this section 16 the connection duct 13 with its wall 17 forms the outer wall of the intercooler 14 and limits the air throughput volume by means of the cooling medium flowing through the cooling insert 15, which volume is sufficient for adequately cooling the charge air flowing around the installed cooling insert 15 - see Fig. 5.<br>
As can be clearly learned from Fig. 2, the cooling insert 15 is designed as a preassembled cartridge. This cooling insert 15 is composed of a base plate 18 and several, eg three cooling pipes 19, 20, 21 provided, on the outside, with a number of cooling ribs - see Fig. 6. Each of the cooling pipes 19, 20, 21 is provided with a cylindrical collar 22 at Its one end, with which collar 22 each of said pipes is installed, eg pressed, welded or soldered into place, in a blind-hole bore 23 in said base plate 18 in a position perpendicular to said basic plate 18 The other end of each cooling pipe 19, 20, 21 is provided with a sealing sleeve 25 on a cylindrical collar 24. Within the cooling insert 15 each cooling pipe 19, 20, 21 with its inner bore 26 communicates with a distribution duct 27 in the base plate 18.<br>
In that section 16 which forms part of the charge-air intercooler 14 the connection duct 13 consists of a largely straight cooling-pipe area 16 and of two pipe elbows 30, 31 at each of the end areas, which pipe elbows branch off laterally before the axial end 28, 29. whereby the cooling insert 15 designed as a cartridge which, in the final assembly, can be inserted through the one open end 28 of the straight section 16 of the connection pipe 13 into the interior of said section 16. With the sealing sleeves on the cooling pipes 19, 20, 21 the cooling insert protrudes, in a sealing manner, into holding bores 32 provided at the opposite axfal end 29 of the section 16 and is, at the one axial end 28, finally fastend to the basic plate<br>
18	in a leakage-free manner by means of several bofts 33. Finally, the end 29 of the straight<br>
section 16 of the connection duct 13 is dosed by a cover 34 which can be fastened there,<br>
said end 29 being adjacent to the sealing sleeves 25. This cover 34 is internally provided<br>
with a distribution duct 36 which can be supplied with cooling medium from the outside - see<br>
arrow 35 - and communicates with some of the cooling pipes, in this case with the cooling<br>
pipes 20, 21. In addition, the inside of the cover 34 features a return duct 38 which is<br>
connected with an external cooling-medium return line - marked with arrow 37 - and with<br>
which the other cooling pipe(s), in this case cooling pipe 19, communicate(s).<br>
In the example presented the cooling insert 15 in the invention features three cooling pipes 19, 20, 21 which are arranged parade! in one plane and at little distance to one another and are of identical length - see Fig. 6 -, through two of which pipes (20, 21) cooling medium flows parallel in the one direction - see arrow 39 in Rg. 5 - and through the third cooling pipe<br>
19	cooling medium flows in the other direction - see arrow 40 - the third coo/ing pipe thus<br>
forming a quasi cooling-insert-internal return pipe for the cooling medium.<br>
In its straight duct section 16 the connection duct 13 with its wall 17 encompasses the installed cooling insert 15 at a certain distance which is not too large and is smaller than the outer diameter of the cooling pipes 19, 20, 21.<br>
In this invention-specific intercooler 14 a sufficient cooling effect is achieved despite its relative small constructional size because of the intensive passage of cooling medium through the cooling pipes 19, 20, 21 and the intensive contact of the charge air, flowing through the cooling insert 15 in the connection-duct section 16, with the cooling ribs of the cooling pipes 19, 20, 21.<br><br><br><br>
