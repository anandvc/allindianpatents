				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of fried snacks with improved sensory profile.<br>
Fried snacks of several types based on cereals, legumes, and millets are being prepared and soy flour has also been used in the recent past in several types of foods. Soy meal or defatted soy flour (DSF) has been used in food preparation such as biscuits, chocolates, (coffee substitutes, (milk-like or milk-based beverages, sauces gels, films, infant foods hydrolysed vegetable proteins vegetable condiments, drying syrups and molasses, and extrusion cooked products<br>
Although soy or defatted soy flour or soy protein isolate have found extensive use, there are still limitations in using soy products as food ingredients mostly due to their inherent undesirable taste and aroma characteristics.<br>
Defatted soy flour (DSF) has a high protein content (50%) and thus form a good source in the preparation of several foods with high protein content. Use of DSF along with rice or Bengal gram flour has been tried but the products have some undesirable flavour associated with it. Heat treatment of soy or DSF by toasting soya bean or flakes or aqueous heating or steaming of soy flour or DSF slurry, dielectric heating, extrusion cooking pressure induced heating , super heated steam and steam texturization have been reported. Microwave heating has been carried out and shown to reduce the anti nutritional factors. Heating has been reported to improve the nutritive value by inactivation of trypsin inhibitors but reduces the nitrogen solubility index of the proteins. (1-14)..<br>
Reference may be made to a method of manufacturing a coffee substitute (Cerise L European patent -Application, EP No. 0 963 273 A1 1999) where a process for manufacture of a coffee subastitute is based on heating a mixture of defatted soy meal and water under pressure. This process produces a liquid coffee substitute, which may also be used as a flavoring.(1).<br><br>
Reference may be made to a method of preparing milk beverage (Japanese -Examined - Patent 5 545 168 Nishini oi / milk KK 1980 ) where defatted soy bean is heated, acidified with organic acid, reacted with acid protease, and centrifuged to give a supernatant. The supernatant is further reacted with peptidase, and resultant product mixed with sugar, organic acid , flavour.ete., to give a sot bean milk beverage. (2)<br>
Reference may be made to a method of deodorizing soybean milk (Eida T; Saito- Y Yomoto-C; ; Nakajima-Y United States Patent No.4 138 506 1979) where a process is described in which soy milk, containing sodium or potassium sulphite ,is heated under pressure and contacted with activated carbon to remove odorous components. (3)<br>
Reference may be made to a method of getting a Tissue like protein (Japanese-Examined -Patent, No. 5 705 139 Nishin Seiyu KK 1982) where defatted soybean is immersed in aqueous alcohol, washed and then kneaded with water and extruded under heat and pressure to give a tissue- like soybean protein. (4).<br>
Reference may be made to the manufacture of a condiment (Faesi - R; Werner - G; Wolfensberger -U European-patent-Application, Swiss Patent No. Ch 668 163A5,Ch 85-5013, 19851125, Nestle.Vevey .Swizen Lab, 1987) where vegetable proteins are hydrolyzed using conc, hydrochloric acid, neutralized, insolubles removed, the hydrolyzate then being left to stand before further insolubles are removed . After separation of the first or second portion of insolubles, the hydrolyzate is subjected to steam distillation under reduced pressure while maintaining the density of the hydrolyzate at a fairly constant level ; the distillation removes 1,3-dichloropropan-2-ol. Examples of vegetable proteins are oilseed cake, wheat gluten and defatted soy flour (5).<br>
Reference may be made to the preparation of solidified product from high fructose corn syrup (Glabe -EF; Anderson -PW ; Laftsidis United States Patent No. 3 958 037 1975) where a process for dehydrating high fructose corn<br><br>
syrup, partially detailed soy protein is slurried with the syrup and composition dried by application as a thin film to a heat surface, the quantity of soy protein being sufficient to enhance the crispness of the film (6)<br>
Reference may be made to the process of preparing improved soy protein material (Gomi-T; Hisa-Y; Soeda -T United States Patent No. 4 113 716 1978 ) where an aqueous slurry of denatured, defatted soybean flake material having a pH of 6.5 - 9.0 is heated to 110 -140 degree C to yield a product in which the N solubility index of the soy protein is greater than 75% . The product also has improved flavour and color (7)<br>
Reference may be made to a method of processing by heating a powdery and /or granular substance and apparatus (Akao T and Furukawa t European-patent-Application, EP 0 196 464 A2 1986), where low cost .small size heating tubes are used to heat treat powdered or granular materials, using a whirling stream of saturated steam, super heated steam or hot gas . The equipment is suitable for sterilizing defatted soybean, buckwheat flour.rice bran.Adlay, marine alga.polished rice, or crushed wheat.without causing serious los of vitamins or other nutrients (8).<br>
Reference may be made to the preparation of a a bland functional DSF (Clatfelter k; LoPresti GM;Conta JA and deLumen BO US patent No. 4 209 541 1980) by a method in which a batch of hulled soybean material is heated to inactivate lipoxidase, after which it is dehulled and cracked, defatted in an inert atm, washed in an inert atm to remove polar lipids, dried and milled to yield a defatted soy flour (9).<br>
Reference may be made to De-flavoring of defatted particulate oil seed protein ( Baird- -JCand Warfield GR ; US patent No. 4 205 094 1980) material is deflavoured by increasing the moisture level to 25-65%, steam cooking the material with direct steam and subjecting the material to high speed centrifugal turbine mixing. The process takes a few seconds and the product used as a ground beef extender (10)<br><br>
Reference may be made to a method of preparing improved soy bean flour (Herzberg C and Dollbaum W West-German-patent-Application, No. 2 007 588 1971) where raw soya beans from which the oil has not been extracted are broken up and fed into a baffled vortex-chamber to meet super heated steam at, e.g. 135Â°C and 0.4-1.0 atm. gauge for an average of 20 sec. After grinding, the whole flour contains no bitter matter, e.g. urease, and is neutral to the taste (11).<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of fried snacks with improved sensory profile.<br>
Another object of the present invention is use of steam for improving the taste of DSF.<br>
Yet another object is to use treated DSF for preparation of a fried snack.<br>
Yet another object is to improve the sensory quality of fried snacks containing DSF.<br>
Still another object is to use treated DSF along with Bengal gram flour in the preparation of fried snacks.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of fried snacks with improved sensory profile containing defatted soy flour (DSF) which comprises steaming defatted soy flour at atmospheric pressure in a vessel or cooker over a perforated disc for a period ranging from 5-15 min, powdering the above said steamed mass and sieving the dried mass through a 60 mesh screen, equilibrating the powder for 1-3 hr. at a temperature ranging form 25-40Â°C, mixing the equilibrated powder with 80-130% of water, 2-2.5% salt, 0.3-0.6 % chilli powder all on the flour weight basis optionally mixing the said powdered sieved DSF with Bengalgram flour in a proportion of 20:80 or 50:50 to make the dough, extruding the above said dough and deep fat frying<br><br>
the extended dough in refined vegetable oil such as ground nut oil till the product becomes crisp in texture and golden brown in color.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the sieved, powdered DSF is equilibrated preferably for a period ranging from 2-3 hours.<br>
In an another embodiment of the present invention the steamed DSF may be mixed with BGF in a proportion of 20:80 or 50:50.<br>
The methodology for preparation of fried snacks with improved sensory profile containing treated DSF comprises of the following steps.<br>
GENERAL FLOW DIAGRAM FOR PREPARATION OF STEAMED FLOUR<br>
Defatted soy flour<br>
spreading as 2 - 3 cm thickness in a cloth steaming at atmospheric pressure<br>
powdering the mass<br>
sieving through 60 mesh screen<br>
equilibrating at room temperature by spreading as thin layer<br>
The novelty of this process is<br>
1.	Improvement in the sensory quality of DSF by steaming.<br>
2.	Achieving higher compatibility of DSF with BGF in the preparation of fried<br>
snacks having improved sensory quality.<br><br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLE-1<br>
Five hundred g of DSF was spread to thickness of 1.5 cm on a coarse cloth bag and placed on a perforated plate. This was kept in a vessel/cooker and steamed at atmospheric pressure for 5 minutes. The steamed mass was powdered by gentle pounding and sieved through a 60 mesh screen. The processed DSF was spread as a thin bed of 1 cm thickness and equilibrated at 30Â°C for 2 hours. Two hundred grams each of flour samples steamed for 5, 10 and 15 minutes was mixed with 276, 288 and 292 ml of water, 5g of salt and 1g of chilli powder and made in to a dough in a mixer. The dough was hand extruded in a metal press as strands of 0.25 cm diameter and fried in refined ground nut oil at 180Â°C for 3 minutes .till the products were crisp in texture and golden brown in color. For comparison the snacks were also prepared from Bengal gram flour dough and untreated DSF dough. All the samples were subjected to sensory analysis by Quantitative Descriptive Analysis.<br>

Table 5. shows the comparison between untreated and treated DSF in 1:1 combination with BGF. samples containing treated DSF had significantly lower levels of undesirable flavour notes, namely husky bitter and after-taste bitterness.<br>
Summary of observations of the above examples is as follows<br>
1. The oilyness of the product was very high in DSF as compared to BGF or the steamed samples of DSF.<br>
2.	The sample prepared from DSF steamed for 10 min., had a mean score for<br>
oilyness close to that of BGF.<br>
3.	By steaming DSF the huskiness in the product decreased significantly when<br>
compared to untreated DSF.<br>
4.	The bitterness in the product decreased with increasing steaming period up<br>
to 10 min. but showed a slight increase after 15 min., of steaming.<br>
5.	The after-taste bitterness also decreased significantly in the product after<br>
steaming for 10 min. as compared to the native DSF sample.<br>
6.	Untreated DSF alone did not give a satisfactory product, but steaming DSF<br>
for 10 minutes gave a better product as compared to that obtained from 5<br>
or 15 minutes steamed DSF.<br>
7.	Steamed DSF   for 10 min improved the sensory quality of the product<br>
prepared from it either alone or in combination with BGF. .<br>
8.	In combination with BGF, at 20% and 50% levels, 10 minutes steam treated<br>
DSF gave products which had shown attributes closer to that   prepared<br>
from BGF.<br>
The main advantages of the present invention are<br>
1.	The process involves simple steaming for improvement in sensory quality of<br>
DSF.<br>
2.	It is possible to obtain fried product with significantly reduced undesirable<br>
characteristics, such as husky, bitter and after-taste bitterness.<br>
3.	It is possible to use the treated DSF in combination with BGF to get<br>
products close to the traditionally prepared snacks.<br>
4.	Treated DSF can be used in other snacks with increased protein content<br>
without sacrificing desirable quality attributes<br><br><br><br><br><br>
We claim<br>
1.	A process for the preparation of fried snacks with improved sensory<br>
profile containing defatted soy flour (DSF) which comprises steaming<br>
defatted soy flour at atmospheric pressure in a vessel or cooker over a<br>
perforated disc for a period ranging from 5-15 min, powdering the above<br>
said steamed mass and sieving the dried mass through a 60 mesh<br>
screen, equilibrating the powder for 1-3 hr. at a temperature ranging<br>
