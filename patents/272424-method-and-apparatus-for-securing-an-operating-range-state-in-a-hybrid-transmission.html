CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]   This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application<br>
No. 60/983,166, filed on 10/27/2007 which is hereby incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002]   This disclosure pertains to control systems for hybrid powertrain<br>
systems.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003]   The statements in this section merely provide background information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art. [0004]   Known hybrid powertrain architectures can include multiple torque-generative devices, including internal combustion engines and non-combustion machines, e.g., electric machines, which transmit torque through a transmission device to an output member. One exemplary hybrid powertrain includes a two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical transmission which utilizes an input member for receiving tractive torque from a prime mover power source, preferably an internal combustion engine, and an output member. The output member can be operatively connected to a driveline for a motor vehicle for transmitting tractive torque thereto. Machines, operative as motors or generators, can generate torque inputs to the transmission<br><br>
independently of a torque input from the internal combustion engine. The machines may transform vehicle kinetic energy transmitted through the vehicle driveline to energy that is storable in an energy storage device. A control system is operative to monitor various inputs from the vehicle and the operator and provides operational control of the hybrid powertrain, including controlling transmission operating state and gear shifting, controlling the torque-generative devices, and regulating the power interchange among the energy storage device and the machines to manage outputs of the transmission, including torque and rotational speed. A control system can monitor input and control signals and execute algorithms to verify and secure operation of the powertrain.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0005]   A method to secure a transmission operating range state for a hybrid powertrain system selectively operative in one of a plurality of discrete operating range states includes determining a preferred transition path between a first main operating range state and a second operating range state, monitoring a transition path from the first main operating range state to the second main operating range state, determining whether the monitored transition path from the first main operating range state to the second main operating range state conforms to the preferred transition path, and identifying a fault when the monitored transition path from the first main operating range state to the second main operating range state does not conform to the preferred transition path.<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0006]   One or more embodiments will now be described, by way of<br>
example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
[0007]   Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram of an exemplary hybrid powertrain, in<br>
accordance with the present disclosure;<br>
[0008]   Figs. 2 and 3 are schematic diagrams of an exemplary architecture for<br>
a control system and hybrid powertrain, in accordance with the present<br>
disclosure; and<br>
[0009]   Figs. 4-7 are schematic signal flow diagrams, in accordance with the<br>
present disclosure.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0010]   Referring now to the drawings, wherein the showings are for the purpose of illustrating certain exemplary embodiments only and not for the purpose of limiting the same, Figs. 1 and 2 depict an exemplary electromechanical hybrid powertrain. The exemplary electro-mechanical hybrid powertrain in accordance with the present disclosure is depicted in Fig. 1, comprising a two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical hybrid transmission 10 operatively connected to an engine 14 and torque machines comprising first and second electric machines ('MG-A') 56 and ('MG-B') 72. The engine 14 and first and second electric machines 56 and 72 each generate mechanical power which can be transferred to the transmission 10. The power generated by the engine 14 and the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 and transferred to the transmission 10 is described in terms of input and<br><br>
motor torques, referred to herein as T1, TA, and TB respectively, and speed, referred to herein as N1, NA, and NB, respectively. [0011]   The exemplary engine 14 comprises a multi-cylinder internal combustion engine selectively operative in several states to transfer torque to the transmission 10 via an input member 12, and can be either a spark-ignition or a compression-ignition engine. The engine 14 includes a crankshaft (not shown) operatively coupled to the input member 12 of the transmission 10. A rotational speed sensor 11 monitors rotational speed of the input member 12. Power output from the engine 14, comprising rotational speed and engine torque, can differ from the input speed NI and the input torque TI to the transmission 10 due to placement of torque-consuming components on the input member 12 between the engine 14 and the transmission 10, e.g., a hydraulic pump (not shown) and/or a torque management device (not shown). [0012]   The exemplary transmission 10 comprises three planetary-gear sets 24,26 and 28, and four selectively engageable torque-transferring devices, i.e., clutches CI 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75. As used herein, clutches refer to any type of friction torque transfer device including single or compound plate clutches or packs, band clutches, and brakes, for example. A hydraulic control circuit ('HYD') 42, preferably controlled by a transmission control module (hereafter 'TCM') 17, is operative to control and monitor clutch states. Clutches C2 62 and C4 75 preferably comprise hydraulically-applied rotating friction clutches. Clutches C1 70 and C3 73 preferably comprise hydraulically-controlled stationary devices that can be selectively grounded to a transmission case 68. Each of the clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75<br><br>
is preferably hydraulically applied, selectively receiving pressurized hydraulic fluid via the hydraulic control circuit 42.<br>
[0013]   The first and second electric machines 56 and 72 preferably comprise three-phase AC machines, each including a stator (not shown) and a rotor (not shown), and respective resolvers 80 and 82. The motor stator for each machine is grounded to an outer portion of the transmission case 68, and includes a stator core with coiled electrical windings extending therefrom. The rotor for the first electric machine 56 is supported on a hub plate gear that is operatively attached to shaft 60 via the second planetary gear set 26. The rotor for the second electric machine 72 is fixedly attached to a sleeve shaft hub 66.<br>
[0014]   Each of the resolvers 80 and 82 preferably comprises a variable reluctance device including a resolver stator (not shown) and a resolver rotor (not shown). The resolvers 80 and 82 are appropriately positioned and assembled on respective ones of the first and second electric machines 56 and 72. Stators of respective ones of the resolvers 80 and 82 are operatively connected to one of the stators for the first and second electric machines 56 and 72. The resolver rotors are operatively connected to the rotor for the corresponding first and second electric machines 56 and 72. Each of the resolvers 80 and 82 is signally and operatively connected to a transmission power inverter control module (hereafter 'TPIM') 19, and each senses and monitors rotational position of the resolver rotor relative to the resolver stator, thus monitoring rotational position of respective ones of first and second electric machines 56 and 72. Additionally, the signals output from the<br><br>
resolvers 80 and 82 are interpreted to provide the rotational speeds for first and second electric machines 56 and 72, i.e., NAand NB, respectively. [0015]   The transmission 10 includes an output member 64, e.g. a shaft, which is operably connected to a driveline 90 for a vehicle (not shown), to provide output power to the driveline 90 that is transferred to vehicle wheels 93, one of which is shown in Fig. 1. The output power at the output member 64 is characterized in terms of an output rotational speed No and an output torque To. A transmission output speed sensor 84 monitors rotational speed and rotational direction of the output member 64. Each of the vehicle wheels 93 is preferably equipped with a sensor 94 adapted to monitor wheel speed, the output of which is monitored by a control module of a distributed control module system described with respect to Fig. 2, to determine vehicle speed, and absolute and relative wheel speeds for braking control, traction control, and vehicle acceleration management.<br>
[0016]   The input torque from the engine 14 and the motor torques from the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 (TI, TA, and TB respectively) are generated as a result of energy conversion from fuel or electrical potential stored in an electrical energy storage device (hereafter 'ESD') 74. The ESD 74 is high voltage DC-coupled to the TPIM 19 via DC transfer conductors 27. The transfer conductors 27 include a contactor switch 38. When the contactor switch 38 is closed, under normal operation, electric current can flow between the ESD 74 and the TPIM 19. When the contactor switch 38 is opened electric current flow between the ESD 74 and the TPIM 19 is interrupted. The TPIM 19 transmits electrical power to and from the first electric machine 56 through a first motor control module ('MCP-A') 33 using transfer conductors 29, and<br><br>
the TPIM 19 similarly transmits electrical power to and from the second electric machine 72 through a second motor control module ('MCP-B') 34 using transfer conductors 31 to meet the torque commands for the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 in response to the motor torques TA and TB. Electrical current is transmitted to and from the ESD 74 in accordance with whether the ESD 74 is being charged or discharged. [0017]   The TPIM 19 preferably includes a hybrid control module (hereafter 'HCP') 5 and the pair of power inverters and respective motor control modules 33 and 34 configured to receive the torque commands and control inverter states therefrom for providing motor drive or regeneration functionality to meet the commanded motor torques TA and TB. The power inverters comprise known complementary three-phase power electronics devices, and each includes a plurality of insulated gate bipolar transistors (not shown) for converting DC power from the ESD 74 to AC power for powering respective ones of the first and second electric machines 56 and 72, by switching at high frequencies. The insulated gate bipolar transistors form a switch mode power supply configured to receive control commands. There is typically one pair of insulated gate bipolar transistors for each phase of each of the three-phase electric machines. States of the insulated gate bipolar transistors are controlled to provide motor drive mechanical power generation or electric power regeneration functionality. The three-phase inverters receive or supply DC electric power via DC transfer conductors 27 and transform it to or from three-phase AC power, which is conducted to or from the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 for operation as motors or generators via transfer conductors 29 and 31 respectively.<br><br>
[0018]   Figs. 2 and 3 are schematic block diagrams of the distributed control module system of the control system. As used herein, the term 'control system' is defined as the control modules, wiring harnesses (not shown), communications links, sensors and actuators that monitor and control operation of the powertrain system. The control system monitors sensor inputs and commands outputs for controlling the actuators. The distributed control module system comprises a subset of overall vehicle control architecture, and provides coordinated system control of the exemplary hybrid powertrain described in Fig. 1. The control system includes the distributed control module system for synthesizing information and inputs, and executing algorithms to control actuators to meet control objectives, including objectives related to fuel economy, emissions, performance, drivability, and protection of hardware, including batteries of ESD 74 and the first and second electric machines 56 and 72. The distributed control module system includes an engine control module (hereafter 'ECM') 23, the TCM 17, a battery pack control module (hereafter 'BPCM') 21, and the TPIM 19. The HCP 5 provides supervisory control and coordination of the ECM 23, the TCM 17, the BPCM 21, and the TPIM 19. A user interface ('UI') 13 is preferably signally connected to a plurality of devices through which a vehicle operator controls, directs, and commands operation of the electro-mechanical hybrid powertrain. The devices include an accelerator pedal 113 ('AP'), an operator brake pedal 112 ('BP'), a transmission gear selector 114 ('PRNDL'), and a vehicle speed cruise control (not shown). The transmission gear selector 114 may have a discrete number of operator-selectable positions, including the rotational direction of the output member 64 to enable one of a forward and a<br><br>
reverse direction. The user interface 13 can comprise a single device, as shown, or alternatively can comprise a plurality of user interface devices directly connected to the individual control modules (not shown). [0019]   The aforementioned control modules communicate with other control modules, sensors, and actuators via a communications link comprising a local area network (hereafter 'LAN') bus 6, in this embodiment. The LAN bus 6 allows for structured communication between the various control modules. The specific communication protocol utilized is application-specific. The LAN bus 6 and appropriate protocols provide for robust messaging and multi-control module interfacing between the aforementioned control modules, and other control modules providing functionality including e.g., antilock braking, traction control, and vehicle stability. Multiple communications buses may be used to improve communications speed and provide some level of signal redundancy and integrity. Communications between the MCP-A 33 and the HCP 5 and between the MCP-B 34 and the HCP 5 is preferably effected using direct links preferably comprising serial peripheral interface (hereafter 'SPI') buses 37. Communication between individual control modules can also be effected using a wireless link, e.g., a short range wireless radio communications bus (not shown).<br>
[0020]   The HCP 5 provides supervisory control of the hybrid powertrain, serving to coordinate operation of the ECM 23, TCM 17, MCP-A 33, MCP-B 34, and BPCM 21. Based upon various command signals from the user interface 13 and the hybrid powertrain, including the ESD 74, the HCP 5 determines an operator torque request, an output torque command, an engine input torque command, clutch torque(s) for the applied torque-transfer<br><br>
clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, C4 75 of the transmission 10, and the motor torques TA and TB for the first and second electric machines 56 and 72. The HCP 5 sends commands to specific control modules to effect control of the engine 14, transmission 10 and the first and second electric machines 56 and 72.<br>
[0021]    The ECM 23 is operatively connected to the engine 14, and functions to acquire data from sensors and control actuators of the engine 14 over a plurality of discrete lines, shown for simplicity as an aggregate bi-directional interface cable 35. The ECM 23 receives the engine input torque command from the HCP 5. The ECM 23 determines the actual engine input torque, TI, provided to the transmission 10 at that point in time based upon monitored engine speed and load, which is communicated to the HCP 5. The ECM 23 monitors input from the rotational speed sensor 11 to determine the engine input speed to the input member 12, which translates to the transmission input speed, NI. The ECM 23 monitors inputs from sensors (not shown) to determine states of other engine operating parameters including, e.g., a manifold pressure, engine coolant temperature, ambient air temperature, and ambient pressure. The engine load can be determined, for example, from the manifold pressure, or alternatively, from monitoring operator input to the accelerator pedal 113. The ECM 23 generates and communicates control signals to control engine actuators, including, e.g., fuel injectors, ignition modules, and throttle control modules, none of which are shown. [0022]   The TCM 17 is operatively connected to the transmission 10 and monitors inputs from sensors (not shown) to determine states of transmission operating parameters. The TCM 17 generates and communicates actuator<br><br>
control signals to control the transmission 10, including controlling the hydraulic control circuit 42. Inputs from the TCM 17 to the HCP 5 include estimated clutch torques for each of the clutches, i.e., C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75, and rotational output speed, No, of the output member 64. Other actuators and sensors may be used to provide additional information from the TCM 17 to the HCP 5 for control purposes. The TCM 17 monitors inputs from pressure switches (not shown) and selectively actuates pressure control solenoids (not shown) and shift solenoids (not shown) of the hydraulic circuit 42 to selectively actuate the various clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75 to achieve various transmission operating range states, as described hereinbelow.<br>
[0023]   The BPCM 21 is signally connected to sensors (not shown) to monitor the ESD 74, including states of electrical current and voltage parameters, to provide information indicative of parametric states of the batteries of the ESD 74 to the HCP 5. The parametric states of the batteries preferably include battery state-of-charge, battery voltage, battery temperature, and available battery power, referred to as a range PBAT_MiNto PBAT_MAX-[0024]   A brake control module (hereafter 'BrCM') 22 is operatively connected to friction brakes (not shown) on each of the vehicle wheels 93. The BrCM 22 monitors the operator input to the brake pedal 112 and generates control signals to control the friction brakes and sends a control signal to the HCP 5 to operate the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 based thereon.<br>
[0025J   F'g- 3 shows details of the TPIM 19. The MCP-A 33 and the HCP 5 are preferably signally connected to the LAN 6. MCP-A 33 and MCP-B 34<br><br>
are directly signally connected to the HCP 5 using first and second SPI buses 37 which are preferably dedicated, i.e., communicate exclusively between the HCP 5 and the MCP-A 33 and the HCP 5 and the MCP-B 34, respectively. [0026]   Each of the control modules ECM 23, TCM 17, HCP-5, MCP-A 33, MCP-B 34, BPCM 21, and BrCM 22 is preferably a general-purpose digital computer comprising a microprocessor or central processing unit, storage mediums comprising read only memory ('ROM'), random access memory ('RAM'), electrically programmable read only memory ('EPROM'), a high speed clock, analog to digital ('A/D') and digital to analog ('D/A') circuitry, and input/output circuitry and devices ('I/O') and appropriate signal conditioning and buffer circuitry. Each of the control modules has a set of control algorithms, comprising resident program instructions and calibrations stored in one of the storage mediums and executed to provide the respective functions of each computer. Information transfer between the control modules is preferably accomplished using the LAN bus 6 and SPI buses 37. The control algorithms are executed during preset loop cycles such that each algorithm is executed at least once each loop cycle. Algorithms stored in the non-volatile memory devices are executed by one of the central processing units to monitor inputs from the sensing devices and execute control and diagnostic routines to control operation of the actuators, using preset calibrations. Loop cycles are executed at regular intervals, for example each 3.125, 6.25, 12.5,25 and 100 milliseconds during ongoing operation of the hybrid powertrain. Alternatively, algorithms may be executed in response to the occurrence of an event.<br><br>
[0027]   The exemplary hybrid powertrain selectively operates in one of several states that can be described in terms of engine states comprising one of an engine-on state ('ON') and an engine-off state ('OFF'), and transmission operating range states comprising a plurality of fixed gears and continuously variable operating modes, described with reference to Table 1, below.<br><br>
[0028]   Each of the transmission operating range states is described in the table and indicates which of the specific clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75 are applied for each of the operating range states. A first continuously variable mode, i.e., EVT Mode 1, or Ml, is selected by applying clutch C1 70 only in order to "ground" the outer gear member of the third planetary gear set 28. The engine state can be one of ON ('Ml_Eng_On') or OFF ('Ml_Eng_Off). A second continuously variable mode, i.e., EVT Mode 2, or M2, is selected by applying clutch C2 62 only to connect the shaft 60 to the carrier of the third planetary gear set 28. The engine state can be one of ON ('M2_Eng_On') or OFF ('M2_Eng_Off). For purposes of this description,<br><br>
when the engine state is OFF, the engine input speed is equal to zero revolutions per minute ('RPM'), i.e., the engine crankshaft is not rotating.  A fixed gear operation provides a fixed ratio operation of input-to-output speed of the transmission 10, i.e., NI/No. A first fixed gear operation ('Gl') is selected by applying clutches C1 70 and C4 75. A second fixed gear operation ('G2') is selected by applying clutches CI 70 and C2 62. A third fixed gear operation ('G3') is selected by applying clutches C2 62 and C4 75. A fourth fixed gear operation ('G4') is selected by applying clutches C2 62 and C3 73. The fixed ratio operation of input-to-output speed increases with increased fixed gear operation due to decreased gear ratios in the planetary gears 24, 26, and 28. The rotational speeds of the first and second electric machines 56 and 72, NA and NB respectively, are dependent on internal rotation of the mechanism as defined by the clutching and are proportional to the input speed measured at the input member 12. When the transmission 10 is controlled in EVT Mode 1, the transmission 10 can be commanded to operate in the reverse direction, which is accomplished by operating the second electric machine 72 in the reverse rotational direction through its motor control module in TPIM 19. A neutral operating range state can be effected by deactivating all of the torque transfer clutches.<br>
[0029]   In response to operator input via the accelerator pedal 113 and brake pedal 112 as captured by the user interface 13, the HCP 5 and one or more of the other control modules determine torque commands to control the torque actuators to meet the operator torque request at the output member 64 for transference to the driveline 90. The torque actuators preferably include a plurality of torque generative devices, e.g., the engine 14 and the first and<br><br>
second electric machines 56 and 72 and a torque transferring device comprising the transmission 10 in this embodiment. Based upon operator commands from the user interface 13, the HCP 5 determines the operator torque request and an output torque command from the transmission 10 to the driveline 90 and actuator controls including an input torque from the engine 14, clutch torques for the torque-transfer clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, C4 75 of the transmission 10 and the motor torques for the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 based upon operator commands from the user interface 13.<br>
[0030]   Fig. 4 shows an embodiment of an architecture to control and manage signal flow in a powertrain system including torque actuators comprising multiple torque generating devices and a torque transferring device to control and manage torque transfer and power flow. The architecture is described with reference to, but not limited by, the powertrain system described hereinabove. The flow of signals through the control modules controls the torque generating devices and the torque transferring device. In operation, the operator inputs to the accelerator pedal 113 and the brake pedal 112 are monitored to determine the operator command comprising the operator torque request ('To_req'). Operation of the engine 14 and the transmission 10 are monitored to determine the input speed ('Ni') and the output speed ('No'). A strategic optimization control scheme ('Strategic Control') 310 determines a preferred input speed ('NiDes') and a preferred engine state and transmission operating range state ('Hybrid Range State Des') based upon the output speed and the operator torque request, and optimized based upon other operating<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
response limits of the engine 14, the transmission 10, and the first and second electric machines 56 and 72. The strategic optimization control scheme 310 is preferably executed by the HCP 5 during each 100 ms loop cycle and each 25 ms loop cycle.<br>
[0031]   The outputs of the strategic optimization control scheme 310 are used in a shift execution and engine start/stop control scheme ('Shift Execution and Engine Start/Stop') 320 to operate the transmission 10 ('Transmission Commands') including commanding a change to the preferred operating range state. This includes commanding and executing a change in the operating range state if the preferred operating range state is different from the present operating range state by commanding changes in application of one or more of the clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75, and other commands. The present operating range state ('Hybrid Range State Actual') and an input speed profile ('NiProf) can be determined. The input speed profile is an estimate of an upcoming time-rate change in the input speed and preferably comprises a scalar parametric value that is a targeted input speed for the forthcoming loop cycle, based upon the engine operating commands and the operator torque request during a transition in the operating range state of the transmission, i.e., executing a transmission shift from a first to a second operating range state. [0032]   Each of the transmission operating range states, i.e., G1, G2, G3, G4, Ml and M2 in this embodiment, can be a main operating range state and a transitional operating range state. Shifting from one of the main operating range states to a second main operating range state can include shifting out of the first main operating range state to a transitional operating range state prior to shifting to the second main operating range state. By way of example, with<br><br>
reference to the embodiment described herein, shifting from Gl to G2 preferably includes first shifting from Gl to Ml and then shifting from Ml to G2. The main operating range states are Gl and G2, and the transitional operating range state is Ml in this example. This operation allows the system to off-load the off-going clutch C4 75 and decrease engine input speed prior to applying oncoming clutch C2 62. Each shifting sequence comprises a predetermined transition path having at least one valid transitional operating range state. Fig. 5 depicts a state flow diagram, having main states 0, 1, 2, and 3, and transition states T4, T5, T6, T7, T8, T9, T12, and T13. The flow paths show valid predetermined transition paths between the main states using specific ones of the transition states. By way of example, a flow path from State 0 to State 1 includes transition state T6.  By way of example, a flow path from State 0 to State 3 includes transition states T6 and T13. State flow paths are depicted for transitions between each of the main states. [0033]   A tactical control scheme ('Tactical Control and Operation') 330 is repeatedly executed during one of the control loop cycles to determine engine commands ('Engine Commands') for operating the engine 14, including a preferred input torque from the engine 14 to the transmission 10 based upon the output speed, the input speed, and the operator torque request and the present operating range state for the transmission. The engine commands also include engine states including one of an all-cylinder operating state and a cylinder deactivation operating state wherein a portion of the engine cylinders are deactivated and unfueled, and engine states including one of a fueled state and a fuel cutoff state.<br><br>
[0034]    A clutch torque ('Tel') for each of the clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75 is estimated in the TCM 17, including the presently applied clutches and the non-applied clutches for the presently commanded operating range state. A clutch monitoring algorithm is executed to monitor present commands for selectively actuating pressure control solenoids (not shown) of the hydraulic control circuit 42 for applying one or more of the clutches, and comparing with the presently commanded transmission operating range state. [0035]   A present engine input torque (Ti') through the input member 12 is determined in the ECM 23. An output and motor torque determination scheme ('Output and Motor Torque Determination') 340 is executed to determine the preferred output torque from the powertrain ('Tocmd'), which includes motor torque commands ('TA', 'TB') for controlling the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 in this embodiment. The preferred output torque is based upon the estimated clutch torque(s) for each of the clutches, the present input torque from the engine 14, the present operating range state, the input speed, the operator torque request, and the input speed profile. The first and second electric machines 56 and 72 are controlled through the TPIM 19 to meet the preferred motor torque commands based upon the preferred output torque. The output and motor torque determination scheme 340 includes algorithmic code which is regularly executed during the 6.25 ms and 12.5 ms loop cycles to determine the preferred motor torque commands. [0036]   The hybrid powertrain is controlled to transfer the output torque to the output member 64 and thence to the driveline 90 to generate tractive torque at wheel(s) 93 to forwardly propel the vehicle in response to the operator input to the accelerator pedal 113 when the operator selected position<br><br>
of the transmission gear selector 114 commands operation of the vehicle in the forward direction. Similarly, the hybrid powertrain is controlled to transfer the output torque to the output member 64 and thence to the driveline 90 to generate tractive torque at wheel(s) 93 to propel the vehicle in a reverse direction in response to the operator input to the accelerator pedal 113 when the operator selected position of the transmission gear selector 114 commands operation of the vehicle in the reverse direction. Preferably, propelling the vehicle results in vehicle acceleration so long as the output torque is sufficient to overcome external loads on the vehicle, e.g., due to road grade, aerodynamic loads, and other loads.<br>
[0037]   Torque security of the hybrid powertrain system can be achieved by executing integrity tests of the control system which include monitoring hardware integrity, monitoring integrity of algorithms and memory devices, securing and monitoring integrity of critical signals during communications within a control module and communications between the control modules, monitoring processor integrity and executing remedial actions. Torque security in the presence of an observed fault can include limiting a torque actuator command signal. This can include maximum and minimum limits on torque actuator command signals and maximum rates of change on torque actuator command signals. Specifically, motor torque commands TA and TB can be limited to maximum and minimum motor torques, and changes in the motor torque commands TA and TB can be limited to effect a maximum rate of change in output torque, e.g., 0.2g.<br>
[0038]   Securing and monitoring signal integrity is preferably accomplished by individually securing the control modules and securing the serial<br><br>
communications links between the control modules. The distributed control module system of the embodiment preferably includes each of the torque actuators controlled by a separate control module. This embodiment includes the ECM 23 that monitors sensors and control actuators of the engine 14, the TCM 17 that monitors sensors and control actuators of the transmission 10, the MCP-A 33 that monitors sensors and control actuators of the first electric machine 56, and the MCP-B 34 that monitors sensors and control actuators of the second electric machine 72. The HCP 5 monitors inputs from and commands operation of the ECM 23, TCM 17, MCP-A 33 and MCP-B 34. The control modules communicate the signals using the LAN bus 6 and the SP1 bus 37. Each of the ECM 23, MCP-A 33, MCP-B 34 and TCM 17 is responsible for closed loop monitoring and self-security based on secured commands received from the HCP 5.<br>
[0039]   Securing and monitoring integrity of the signal includes monitoring processor integrity for each of the control modules. The processor integrity can be determined using diagnostics software that monitors data internal to the control module, and rationalizing it in one of the loop cycles. When an inconsistency between monitored data and rationalized data is detected, the inconsistency is recorded as a mismatch or a fault in a fault maturation algorithm, e.g., an X of Y routine wherein a matured fault is detected when X faults are observed out of immediately preceding Y observations of the signal. An example is detecting a matured fault when more than half the immediately preceding observations are mismatches occurring between the monitored data and the rationalized data. When the fault maturation algorithm achieves a threshold number of mismatching observations in the immediately preceding<br><br>
observations, the fault has matured, indicating a requirement for remedial action. The remedial action can be actuator-specific or across the entire control system, and places the powertrain in a torque-safe state. The remedial action will also include storing an OBD compliant code for subsequent retrieval.  A diagnostic may preliminarily identify a fault pending, meaning an inconsistency has been detected but the fault maturation algorithm has not reached its threshold. The hardware integrity can be further determined using diagnostics software that monitors the sensors and actuators of the control system.<br>
[0040]   Integrity of other hardware can be determined using diagnostics software that monitors data internal to the control module, and rationalizing it in one of the loop cycles. When an inconsistency between monitored data and rationalized data is detected, the inconsistency is recorded as a mismatch count in a fault maturation algorithm, e.g., an X of Y routine wherein a fault is detected when X mismatches are observed out of immediately preceding Y observations. An example is a fault is detected when more than half the immediately preceding observations are mismatches occurring between the monitored data and the rationalized data. When the fault maturation algorithm achieves a threshold number of mismatching observations a fault will be set and a remedial action taken. The remedial action can be actuator-specific or across the entire control system, and preferably places the powertrain in a torque-safe state. The remedial action will also include storing an OBD compliant code for subsequent retrieval.  A diagnostic may preliminarily identify a fault pending, meaning an inconsistency has been detected but the fault maturation algorithm has not reached its threshold. The hardware<br><br>
integrity can be further determined using diagnostics software that monitors the sensors and actuators of the control system. [0041]   A critical signal comprising an operating range state command originates in the HCP 5 in this embodiment, and is communicated to the TCM 17 for implementation. The operating range state command is also used by the HCP 5 to determine engine torque commands and motor torque commands to control torque output. Furthermore, as previously described, the present operating range state can vary from the commanded operating range state as there is a finite period of time between a commanded change in the operating range state and execution of the change from first to second main operating range states. Any lag time can be attributed to mechanical and hydraulic response lag times related to deactivating an off-going clutch, operating in the transitional operating range state, and applying an oncoming clutch. The operating range state can be used in each of the strategic optimization control scheme 310, the shift execution and engine start/stop control scheme 320, the tactical control scheme 330 and the output and motor torque determination scheme 340 to control operation of the powertrain including control torque output from the transmission 10, the engine 14 and the first and second electric machines 56 and 72.<br>
[0042]   Fig. 6 shows signal flow to secure and verify integrity of an input signal to an originating control module, which comprises an input signal generated by a sensor signally connected to the originating control module in this depiction. Alternatively, the input signal in the originating control module can comprise one of an operator command signal and an actuator command and control signal. The input signal is generated (502) and is captured as a<br><br>
primary signal 504 and a redundant signal 504'. This can include the input signal from the sensor converted to a digital representation of the input from the sensor using an analog-to-digital converter (not shown) which may be interposed between the sensor and the originating control module. Diagnostics ('Diagnostics') are executed on both the primary signal and the redundant signal (506, 506').   Diagnostics can include limit checks that indicate when the signal is outside of a predetermined operating range for the signal, a rationality check of the signal, and other diagnostics check that can indicate corruption of the signal. If a corrupted signal is detected ('Signal Fault') in either or both the primary signal and the redundant signal, a default signal is generated ('Defaulting') (508, 508") and communicated to a rationality check 510. The default signal preferably comprises a predetermined signal that is recognizable in the control module as indicating the primary signal or the redundant signal has been corrupted. When a fault is not detected ('No Fault'), the primary and/or the redundant signals are communicated to the rationality check 510.  The rationality check 510 compares the primary signal and the redundant signal and identifies a fault ('Fault') when there is a difference detected between the primary and redundant signals. When the rationality check 510 indicates that the primary signal is valid ('Valid Signal'), the primary signal is communicated to a dual store function ('Dual Store') 511. The dual store function 511 monitors and compares present contents in first and second memory locations 512, 512'to verify integrity of the memory locations, preferably during each 6.25 ms loop cycle. When the dual store function 511 verifies integrity of the first and second memory locations, i.e., the present contents in the first and second<br><br>
memory locations are identical, the primary signal is stored as the primary signal in the first memory location ('Store Primary Signal') (512) and stored as a secondary signal in the second memory location ('Store Secondary Signal') (512'). The primary signal stored in the first memory location is subsequently communicated to a control path ('Primary Signal To Control Path'). The secondary signal stored in the second memory location is subsequently communicated to a security path. ('Secondary Signal To Security Path'). If there is a difference between the present contents of the memory locations, a fault ('Fault') is recorded indicating corruption of one of the first and second memory locations.<br>
[0043]   When the rationality check 510 indicates corruption of one or both of the primary and the redundant signals, or the dual store function 511 indicates corruption of the present contents of one the first and second memory locations 512, 512' the control system identifies occurrence of the fault ('Fault'). The control system determines whether the corrupted signal has matured ('Mature Fault') (514), and executes remedial action (516) to mitigate risks associated with the presence of the fault. A fault maturation algorithm can be executed, including, e.g., an X of Y routine wherein a fault has matured when X mismatched signals are observed out of immediately preceding Y signal observations. An example includes determining a fault has matured when more than half the immediately preceding observations indicate a corrupted signal.<br>
[0044]   Monitoring integrity of a signal transmitted over a serial bus includes detecting missing data, e.g., detecting loss of a message frame and taking a short term mitigation action and informing the receiving control module that<br><br>
no new data is available. Detecting missing data also includes detecting long term loss of communications to one of the control modules and taking a remedial action.<br>
[0045]   Fig. 7 shows communicating the redundantly stored signals, e.g., the dual stored signal from Fig. 6, from the originating control module to the receiving control module using a communications bus, e.g., LAN bus 6 or SPI bus 37. The originating control module generates a message ('Tx Message') 610 to transmit. In the embodiment shown, the transmitted message 610 includes words comprising other signals ('TSigl' and 'TSig_2\ 'TSig_4', 'TSig_5' and 'TSig_6'). The primary signal being secured is preferably inserted as a third word ('TSig_3'). The subsequent word ('TSig_3_ARC') comprises an alive rolling count ('Build ARC) consisting of a two bit digital word (one of 00, 01, 10, 11) wherein the two bit word sequentially increments from 00 to 01 to 10 to 11 and repetitively cycles back to begin at 00 for consecutively generated and transmitted messages. The control module generates a fifth word ('TSig_3_PV') which preferably includes adding the alive rolling count to the primary signal and generating a protection value ('Build PV). Generating the protection value preferably comprises generating a logic complement, e.g., a 2's complement, of the primary signal with the added alive rolling count.<br>
[0046]   The message 610 is transmitted over one of the serial communications links (LAN bus 6 or SPI bus 37) and received at the receiving control module as a received message ('Rx Message') 610'. The received message 610' is decoded, including determining received words ('RSig 1', 'RSig_2, 'RSig_3', 'RSig_3_ARC ,'RSig_3_PV ,' 'RSig_4, 'RSig_5' and<br><br>
'RSig_6'). The third word ('RSig_3') is captured and will be stored in a predetermined memory location as a received primary signal ('R/Primary Signal') subsequent to a successful rationality check 515 and a successful dual-store function 517 of memory locations 519 and 519'.   The fourth word ('RSig_3_ARC') is captured and interpreted as a received alive rolling count. The received alive rolling count is compared to an expected alive rolling count, i.e., the next two bit word in the sequence from 00 to 01 to 10 to 11 ('ARC Fault') (518). A fault is recorded if the received alive rolling count is not equal to an expected alive rolling count (518). The fifth word ('RSig_3_PV') is captured and a received secondary signal ('R/Secondary Signal') is determined by generating a corresponding inverse logic complement of the fifth word and parsing out the alive rolling count ('Parse PV/Check PV). Preferably the alive rolling count from the fourth word is subtracted therefrom.<br>
[0047]   The rationality check 515 compares the received primary signal and the received secondary signal and identifies a fault ('Fault') when a difference is detected, preferably prior to storing the received primary signal. When the rationality check 515 indicates that the signal is valid, the primary signal is communicated to the dual store function ('Dual Store') 517. The dual store function 517 monitors and compares present contents in first memory location 519 and second memory location 519' to verify integrity of the memory locations, preferably during each 6.25 ms loop cycle. When the dual store function 517 compares and determines the contents of the first and second memory locations 519 and 519'are identical, the received primary signal is dual-stored, i.e., the received primary signal ('R/Primary Signal') is stored in<br><br>
both the first and second memory locations 519 and 519'. If there is a difference between the present contents of the first and second memory locations 519 and 519', a fault ('Fault') is recorded indicating corruption of one of the first and second memory locations 519 and 519' and remedial action is undertaken consistent with the specific signal.<br>
[0048]    When a fault is recorded based upon the received alive rolling count not being equal to the expected alive rolling count (518), or the rationality check 515 indicates corruption of one or both of the primary and the redundant signals, or the dual store function 517 indicates corruption of the present contents of one the first and second memory locations, the control system identifies occurrence of the fault ('Fault'). The control system determines whether the corrupted signal has matured to a fault using a fault maturation algorithm ('Mature Fault') (521), and executes remedial action (523) to mitigate risks associated with the presence of the fault. The fault maturation algorithm can be executed to determine whether the corrupted signal has matured, including, e.g., an X of Y routine wherein a fault has matured when X mismatched signals are observed out of immediately preceding Y signal observations. An example includes determining a fault has matured when more than half the immediately preceding observations indicate a corrupted signal. As shown, there is a common fault maturation algorithm 521 for the alive rolling count comparison 518, the rationality check 515 and the dual store function 517. Alternatively, there can be individually executed fault maturation algorithms.<br>
[0049]   Messages are transmitted at a rate dependent upon the communications rate of the specific bus, e.g., the LAN bus 6 or SPI bus 37,<br><br>
which can be 1 Mbps. In one embodiment, messages are communicated across the LAN bus 6 every 6.25 ms loop cycle. Messages can be sent serially and evaluated.  The aforementioned signal monitoring software can execute a detection algorithm in one of the loop cycles to detect signal inconsistency between the primary signal and the secondary signal. When an inconsistency is detected, it is recorded as a mismatch count in a fault maturation algorithm, e.g., an X of Y routine wherein a fault is detected when X mismatched signals are observed out of immediately preceding Y signal observations. The control system can execute remedial action to mitigate risks associated with the presence of a fault identified by the fault maturation algorithm. An X of Y routine in which Y = 16 and in which messages are communicated across the LAN bus 6 every 6.25 ms loop cycle is able to detect and mature a fault within 100 milliseconds.<br>
[0050]   Detection of a fault in communications can include detecting temporary loss of data and missing data, detecting corrupted data, and no data. Detecting missing data includes detecting loss of a message frame and taking a short term mitigation action and informing the receiving control module that no new data is available. Detecting no data includes detecting a long term loss of communications to one of the control modules and taking a remedial action. When missing data is detected during communications, the control module can enter a fail-soft mode, wherein torque commands are initially held unchanged, i.e., at steady-state torque levels for a predetermined period of time and then ramped down toward zero torque command. The control modules continue to communicate, and when valid communications are reestablished, torque commands can be ramped up to achieve the operator torque request, with rate-<br><br>
change of the output torque controlled to effect the previously described maximum rate of change in output torque, e.g., 0.2g. When loss of communications is permanent, powertrain operation can be transitioned to a degraded state that limits output torque to a predetermined maximum level, preferably permitting some level of operation for a remainder of the key cycle. [0051]   When a fault is detected in the dual store functions 511, 517, the remedial action and fault mitigation can include disabling the actuator controlled by the respective control module in which the fault occurred. The remedial action can be actuator-specific or system-wide, and places the powertrain in a torque-safe state. The remedial action further includes storing an OBD compliant code for subsequent retrieval.  A diagnostic may preliminarily identify a fault pending, meaning data corruption or an inconsistency has been detected but the fault maturation algorithm has not reached its threshold. The hardware integrity can be further determined using diagnostics software that monitors the sensors and actuators of the control system.<br>
[0052]   The operating range state of the powertrain system can be secured. The operating range state preferably includes a signal indicating a specific torque equation governing operation of the system. The torque equation specific to a commanded operating range state is used to monitor the torque actuators to meet the operator torque request at the output member 64 for transference to the driveline 90. An exemplary torque equation can be executed in 0an output torque determination algorithm monitor, and is shown in<br><br>
wherein inputs Ta and Tb are motor torque commands used for controlling the first and second electric machines 56 and 72, and NO comprises the acceleration rate of the output member 64. The Ti term in Eq. 1 comprises a presently achieved input torque. The [B] term comprises a 1 x 4 matrix of scalar values specific to each operating range state and specific to an embodiment of the powertrain system described herein. The output torque determination algorithm executes the torque equation for the present operating range state, i.e., Eq. 1 in this embodiment, to estimate output torque ('To -est') based upon the aforementioned inputs. The operating range state can be rationalized by comparing the specific torque equation against a set of supported torque equations associated with the operating range state presently being executed in the shift execution and engine start/stop control scheme 320 to operate the transmission 10. The supported torque equations associated with the operating range state presently being executed preferably include output and motor torque determination equations that determine control parameters for operating the torque actuators including the engine 14, transmission 10, and first and second electric machines 56 and 72 to transmit torque to the output member 64 in this embodiment. [0053]    Securing the transmission operating range state further includes assigning each of the discrete operating range states to one of a plurality of<br><br>
allowable groups. The present operating range state can be represented as a specific discrete state. The main operating range states and the transitional operating range states can be subdivided into groups.   By way of example, the main operating range states can be grouped into one group, and transitional upshift states can be grouped into a second group, and transitional downshift states can be grouped into a third group. During every execution of one of the loop cycles, the control scheme executes a rationality check of the operating range state groups. The rationality check is in the form of an algorithm, preferably executed as an element of the shift execution and engine start/stop control scheme 320. The algorithm is executed to verify that the present operating range state group, represented by a numeric value in a RAM location, is one of the valid operating range state groups, and verify that the operating range state, also represented by a numeric value in a RAM location, is one of the allowed operating range states for the present operating range state group. If the algorithm cannot verify the present operating range state group is valid or the operating range state is allowed, a fault has been identified and remedial action is taken.<br>
[0054]    Security of the operating range state includes securing a shift from one of the main operating range states to a second main operating range state. Securing the shift in the operating range state includes monitoring a transition path. This includes monitoring the shift from the first main operating range state to one or more valid transitional operating range states and to the second main operating range state. When a request to change the operating range state occurs, an algorithm can monitor the shift transition path from the first main operating range state to a target operating range state. Each transition<br><br>
between the main operating range states is predetermined.   By way of example and referring to Fig. 5, when a request to transition from State 0 to State 3 occurs, the normal sequencing path comprises a transition from State 0 to T6 to T13 to State3. If however, the shift execution and engine start/stop control scheme 320 detects that on an execution loop after operating in state T6, it is now operating in state T5, a fault is flagged, because the state machine does not support a transition from T6 directly to T5. When a fault is flagged, remedial action is taken.<br>
[0055]   Remedial action can be actuator-specific or across the entire control system, and preferably places the powertrain in a torque-safe state. The remedial action includes storing an OBD compliant code for subsequent retrieval.  Preferably, the HCP 5 commands operation of the transmission 10 to the neutral operating range state upon a detection of a fault in the operating range state. This includes deactivating each of the clutches, in this embodiment, e.g., C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75, and immediately decreasing hydraulic pressure in the hydraulic control circuit 42 preferably by controlling operation of a hydraulic pressure pump (not shown) and controlling regulated hydraulic pressure.<br>

Further modifications and alterations may occur to others upon reading and understanding the specification. It is intended to include all such modifications and alterations insofar as they come within the scope of the disclosure.<br><br>
