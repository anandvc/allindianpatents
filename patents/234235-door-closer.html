				<td>DOOR CLOSER<br>
The invention relates to a door closer comprising an eccentric cam disc linked to<br>
a driven shaft extending out from a housing. The housing is filled with a shock<br>
absorbing medium, whereby, seen in the door closer's axis direction, the<br>
eccentric cam disc on each side adjoins respectively one pressure roller. Also<br>
the eccentric cam disc is engaged in a working connection with a spring piston<br>
loaded by a closing spring and is moreover engaged with a damping piston,<br>
whereas the piston and the housing consist of oil-proof plastic material.<br>
Furthermore, the invention relates to a door closer with a plastic piston<br>
presenting an internal toothing, said piston being driven by a pinion arranged on<br>
a driven shaft, whereby the driven shaft extends at least on one side out from a<br>
housing accommodating the piston and a closing spring.<br>
A door closer is known from the Swiss printed patent specification 281 690.<br>
Therein the described door closer is suitable for German Standards DIN left<br>
hand pivoted or DIN right hand pivoted doors, whereby an existing driven shaft is<br>
equipped with a symmetrically executed cam disc which is in contact with the<br>
piston and thus with the closing spring. The housing as well as the piston are<br>
made from oil-proof plastic material.<br>
A door closer species is revealed by DE G 94 13 039 U1, describing a door<br>
closer, in which the piston includes an internal toothing. In this case, the toothing<br>
and the piston are executed as separate components, and the toothing is<br>
preferably made from material other than plastic from which the piston is<br>
made. Likewise, at least parts of the pinion being in meshed engagement with<br>
the toothing are made partially from metal and plastic material.<br>
DE 40 02 889 A1 reveals a door closer, in which the housing is executed as a<br>
hollow profile. This hollow profile is executed as single piece and realised from<br>
an extruded section made of aluminium alloy or of plastic material. A damping<br>
piston composed of a solid body and a thereto connected elastic body made<br>
from rubber or plastic material, is described in DE-AS 10 39 886.<br>
A piston presenting an external toothing in the form of an inserted toothed rack<br>
made from metal or plastic material is found in the US 4,019,222.<br>
The object of the invention is to produce a lightweight and inexpensive door<br>
closer without any usually required metal removing operation.<br>
To solve the problem, the present invention provides a door closer to close a<br>
door, said door closer comprising a plastic housing consisting essentially of a<br>
plastic material, a plastic drive cam disk consisting essentially of a plastic<br>
material and being rotatably disposed in said plastic housing, a plastic output<br>
shaft consisting essentially of a plastic material and being disposed to project out<br>
a distance from said plastic housing; said plastic drive cam disk being connected<br><br>
to said plastic output shaft to permit transfer of force between said plastic drive<br>
cam disk and said plastic output shaft, said plastic output shaft being configured<br>
to be operatively connected to a door to permit transfer of force between said<br>
plastic output shaft and a door, a plastic spring piston consisting essentially of a<br>
plastic material and being slidingly disposed in said plastic housing, a first plastic<br>
pressure roller consisting essentially of a plastic material and being disposed<br>
between said plastic drive cam disk and said plastic spring piston, said first<br>
plastic pressure roller being configured and disposed to rotate upon rotation of<br>
said plastic drive cam disk to slidingly displace said plastic spring piston during<br>
opening of a door, a spring being mounted in said plastic housing and being<br>
disposed to be in contact with said plastic spring piston, said spring being<br>
configured and disposed to produce a force to slidingly displace said plastic<br>
spring piston during closing of a door, a plastic damping piston consisting<br>
essentially of a plastic material and being slidingly disposed in said plastic<br>
housing, a second plastic pressure roller consisting essentially of a plastic<br>
material and being disposed between said plastic drive cam disk and said plastic<br>
damping piston, said second plastic pressure roller being configured to rotate<br>
upon rotation of said plastic drive cam disk to slidingly displace said plastic<br>
damping piston, at least one of said plastic spring piston and said plastic<br>
damping piston being disposed in said plastic housing adjacent to said plastic<br>
drive cam disk to provide at least two chambers for containing damping fluid in<br>
said plastic housing, said damping fluid being adapted to damp movement of<br>
said door closer, at least one of said plastic spring piston and said plastic<br><br>
damping piston being configured to permit flow of said damping fluid between<br>
said at least two chambers of said plastic housing, and said plastic housing, said<br>
plastic drive cam disk, said plastic spring piston, said plastic damping piston,<br>
said plastic output shaft, and said first and second plastic pressure rollers each<br>
being configured to exhibit at least substantially the same thermal expansion<br>
coefficient.<br>
Usually the cylinder walls surrounding the piston have a round outline. This is<br>
particularly due to the otherwise required retouching work, as the round shape is<br>
the most convenient to realise. However, if it is aimed to manufacture a small<br>
inexpensive door closer, that is to say a door closer without a robust structure,<br>
then the section of the piston, e.g. of the damping piston and of the spring piston<br>
or also the plastic material piston with toothing, may have a different shape than<br>
the round section, namely they could have an oval, rectangular, square or<br>
quadrangular section. All these shapes can be engineered without any problem<br>
from plastic material, as such housings and pistons are made by so-called<br>
injection moulding. Thanks to the available plastic materials, these procedures<br>
nowadays result in an enormous dimensional tolerance and thus a good fitting<br>
precision.<br>
Therefore it is also possible to produce at no extra cost for example door closers<br>
according to DE 36 45 314 C2 and DE 36 45 315 C2 from plastic material in<br>
which piston toothing's teeth present different sizes and a different module.<br><br>
Likewise the opposite toothing of the driven shaft, being in contact with the<br>
aforementioned toothing, can be made without any problem from plastic<br>
material.<br>
With regard to the geometrical sections, such housing must not necessarily be<br>
realised as a single piece in injection moulding. It is also possible to produce<br>
several segments or even partial segments. These segments or partial<br>
segments are assembled respectively joined together via conformed fittings<br>
respectively protrusions that match corresponding indentations in the<br>
counterpart, which are then durably connected to each other by appropriate<br>
procedures like gluing, ultra-sound welding, laser welding or the like. These<br>
procedures guarantee that the individual segment's dimensional stability is<br>
maintained. Simultaneously the execution of the individual segments of the<br>
housing allows also to directly conform or to include in the production process :<br>
channels, borings, pockets, valve seats or even the proper valves, without<br>
needing any retouching work. Thus the assembly work and the production cost<br>
factor is considerably reduced.<br>
Usually so-called end caps or covers seal the door closer's end sides, depending<br>
on the produced segment according to the inventive idea, these are not<br>
necessarily required, as the joining of the individual one sided closed segments<br>
allows to consider a pre-assembly of individual pieces. Segments, which can<br>
only be closed later, will then receive separate covers. These covers may<br><br>
likewise be connected with the segments respectively with the housing by gluing,<br>
ultra-sound welding or the like. In this case, besides covers provided with butt-<br>
jointed executions, likewise covers with grooves, undercuts or bayonet-type<br>
catches, are possible, thus in this way the assembly times can be reduced when<br>
mounting the pieces.<br>
Likewise the attachment devices, in form of appropriate borings to mount the<br>
ready completed door closer at its final destination can be simultaneously<br>
conformed in injection moulding from plastic material without additional cutting.<br>
Hereinafter embodiments of the invention are explained in detail with reference<br>
to the accompanying drawings which show :<br>
Figure 1 : An axial section through a lateral view of an overhead door<br>
closer with an eccentric cam disc ;<br>
Figure 2 : An axial section through a top view of an overhead door closer<br>
according to figure 1 ;<br>
Figure 3 : A section through a frontal view of an overhead door closer with<br>
an internal toothing ;<br>
Figure 4 : A section through a top view on a overhead door closer<br>
according to figure 3 ;<br>
Figure 5 : A section through a door closer's housing which is composed of<br>
individual segments.<br>
Figure 6 : A lateral view of two housing halves, comprising two housing<br><br>
segments with a square sectioned piston chamber.<br>
Besides the following description of the figures of different embodiment<br>
examples according to an overhead door closer, the inventive idea is likewise<br>
applicable to floor springs, transom concealed door closers and internal door<br>
closers. For the overhead door closers, transom concealed door closers and<br>
internal door closers, rods can be used in the form of a rod assembly or an<br>
actuation arm in connection with a sliding rail. These parts, sliding rail, actuation<br>
arm and rod arm assembly are also made from plastic material having the<br>
appropriate stability.<br>
The door closer illustrated in figures 1 and 2 presents an eccentric cam disc 1,<br>
which is penetrated by a driven shaft 3. In the upper part, the driven shaft 3 is<br>
supported inside housing 2 by a driven shaft bearing 17 and in the lower part by<br>
a driven shaft bearing 16. In this case, the bearing either consists of sintered<br>
material or of a needle bearing respectively a ball bearing. Besides the housing<br>
2, the driven shaft bearings 16 and 17 can also be made of plastic material. On<br>
the one side, the curved paths of the eccentric cam disc 1 contact a pressure<br>
roller 7, which is supported via an axle 14 inside a damping piston 4 (Fig. 2). On<br>
the other side, the eccentric cam disc 1 contacts a pressure roller 8, which is<br>
supported via an axle 15 inside a spring piston 6. At the other end of the spring<br>
piston 6 abuts a closing spring 13 on the one end and on the other end against a<br>
spring counter plate 31. The lateral housing's 2 sides are sealed by covers 18<br><br>
and 19, which are connected to the housing 2, either by gluing, ultra-sound<br>
welding, laser welding or the like. As appropriate channels 20 in connection with<br>
valves 29 are required for the control function of a door closer, these have been<br>
simultaneously moulded during the production process into the housing 2 without<br>
any additional cutting. Inside the damping piston 4 as well as inside the spring<br>
piston 6, during production process of these pistons, furthermore return valves 5<br>
have simultaneously been moulded. However, it is also possible to separately<br>
produce these return valves 5, whereby in such case they will also consist of<br>
plastic material.<br>
In order to attach such housing 2 at a door or above a door, an attachment<br>
device 28 has been simultaneously moulded within the housing or conformed to<br>
the housing during the production process and again without additional cutting.<br>
By the method of plastic material processing without any retouching work it is<br>
understood that besides the continuous cylinder boring for the damping piston 4,<br>
for the spring piston 6 and for the closing spring 13, which are circularly executed<br>
in the state of the art, other shapes are possible. These shapes could especially<br>
comprise an oval form, which simultaneously means that the closer would be<br>
considerably smaller dimensioned, respectively a rectangular or square form.<br>
In figure 2, representing a single piece housing, it is obvious that due to the<br>
identical material of the damping piston 4 as well as of the spring piston 6 and of<br><br>
the eccentric cam disc 1 with the driven shaft 3, because of warming, caused for<br>
example by sun radiation, with such door closer type there will be no problem<br>
with thermal expansion, because the used materials have got the same<br>
expansion coefficient for all components. This is not accomplished in the state<br>
of the art, because when utilising for example steel or light metal in connection<br>
with plastic material, these materials all have different thermal expansion<br>
coefficients, this circumstance forcibly leads to leakage and failure of such door.<br>
In another embodiment example in the figures 3 and 4, a toothed rack door<br>
closer with a piston 10 made from plastic material and having an internal toothing<br>
11 is represented. A pinion 12 is in working connection with a toothing 11<br>
whereby the pinion 12 is conformed on the driven shaft 3. In addition to the<br>
housing 9, in this embodiment example, the piston 10 with its toothing 11 and the<br>
driven shaft 3 with its pinion 12 are likewise made from plastic material. Thus<br>
the door closer presents the same characteristics as the one in figures 1 and 2,<br>
that means with this door closer warming would not lead either to function failure,<br>
as the expansion coefficients are the same. The end sides of the housing 9 are<br>
likewise concealed by covers 18 and 19, which are similarly connected to the<br>
housing 9 by gluing, ultra-sound welding, laser welding or the like.<br>
In case of a floor spring executed completely in plastic material, it is obvious that<br>
the cement case for the floor spring is likewise made of plastic material.<br><br>
The embodiment example illustrated in figure 5 shows a door closer housing<br>
which is composed of several segments 21 and 22. In this case, it is possible to<br>
individually engineer different segments, as for example the segment 22, which<br>
is shown as a segment open on one side with conformed attachment devices 28.<br>
At their areas to be joined, the segments 21 and 22 are provided with fittings 26<br>
and indentations 27, which will interconnect upon assembly and after<br>
subsequent operation to join the segments 21 and 22, they will engage and<br>
moreover provide dimensional stable connection. The piston chamber 30<br>
located inside the segments 21 and 22 is closed on the open side of segment 21<br>
by means of a cover 19. Without requiring any additional cutting, a boring 23, for<br>
the driven shaft bearing 16 and 17 as represented in figure 1, is moreover<br>
simultaneously moulded in segment 21.<br>
In addition to the separation into segments 21 and 22, it is possible to subdivide<br>
the segments differently, as shown in figure 6. Here we see segments 24 and<br>
25, which are linked in the longitudinal door closer's direction by means of fittings<br>
26 and indentations 27. Simultaneously in this embodiment example of figure 6,<br>
the piston chamber 30 is represented as a quadrangular piston chamber.<br>
All the aforementioned embodiment examples, which are certainly not complete,<br>
are assumed to be door closers of any type, which are assembled without any<br>
retouching work on the individual parts and segments. In this case, such<br><br>
assembly may take place in an automated process. The parts manufactured<br>
from plastic material, preferably injection moulded without any further retouching<br>
work, are connected to each other by gluing, ultra-sound welding, laser welding<br>
or the like. The used plastic material may be carbon fibre or glass fibre<br>
reinforced plastic.<br>
