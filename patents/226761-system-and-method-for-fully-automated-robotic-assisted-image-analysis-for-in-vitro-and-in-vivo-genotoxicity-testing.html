REFERENCE TO COMPUTER PROGRAM LISTING APPENDIX<br>
A Computer Program Listing Appendix to this document has been submitted to<br>
the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in accordance with 37 C.F.R. §§ 1.52 and 1.96 on the<br>
filing date of this document and is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The<br>
Computer Program Listing Appendix is contained on one (1) CD-ROM, two copies of which<br>
have been filed with the U.S. Patent and. Trademark Office and each of which are labeled with<br>
the name of the inventor of the present invention, the title of the invention, the attorney's<br>
docket number and the creation date of the CD-ROMs.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to genotoxicity testing and, more particularly,<br>
to a metho.l and system for utilizing, in conjunction, an automated robotic slide feeder or<br>
equivalent device, an electronically driven microscope, a microprocessor-based computer and<br>
additional components and software to facilitate high-throughput in vitro and in vivo<br>
genotoxicily testing.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Toxicologicial testing is used in various technologies, industries and disciplines<br>
for assessing the effect of drugs and other chemical compounds on the nature and properties of<br>
oiological natter. Genotoxicity testing is particularly useful for analyzing the effect of certain<br><br>
chemicals on the DNA structure of the cells of humans, animals and other life forms, including<br>
he analysis of the potential for induction of hereditary diseases and mutations. Genotoxicity<br>
testing generally includes screening of either in vivo or in vitro biological matter.<br>
Well known in vitro test systems include, but are not limited to:<br>
(1)	the comet assay, which is used for detecting primary DNA damage, DNA to<br>
DNA crosslinks, and DNA-protein interactions. A specific version of the comet assay is the<br>
alkaline Comet Assay which is described in a publication titled "A simple technique for<br>
quantiation of low levels of DNA damage in individual cells," Singh et al., Experimental<br>
( ellular Research, vol. 175, pp. 184-191 (1988). The Alkaline Comet Assay is also described<br>
in a publication titled "Modification of the Comet Assay for the detection of DNA strand<br>
breaks in extremely small tissue samples," Tebbs et al., Mutagenesis, vol. 14, pp. 437 -438<br>
( 999);<br>
(2)	the micronucleus test in cell lines (V79 cells, Mouse Lymphome cells, TK6<br>
colls) or hurian lymphocytes, which are all known to be useful in the early screening of new<br>
 impounds n industrial toxicology; and<br>
(3)	the chromosome aberration test, which is required by certain regulatory<br>
authorities,such as the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development and the<br>
I nited States Food and Drug Administration, for approval of new drugs. For this in vitro test,<br>
ie assessment of chromosomal aberrations is done on the basis of metaphases which must be<br>
detected for analysis.<br>
In vivo genotoxicity test systems include, but are not limited to:<br>
(1)	the in vivo micronucleus test in bone marrow for clastogenic or aneugenic<br>
petential of test compound administered to rodents. This test is described in a publication<br>
titled "A Rapid in vivo test for chromosomal damage," Heddle, JA., Mutual Res., vol. 18, pp.<br>
[i 7-90 (197:0;<br>
(2)	the in vivo comet assay, which under certain circumstances may be accepted<br>
as a regulatory assay in addition to the micronucleus test in vivo, to verify in vitro test results.<br>
The in vivo comet assay is described in a publication titled "Recommendations for conducting<br>
th : in vivo alkaline Comet assay", Hartmanr. et al., Mutagenesis vol. 18, no. 1, pp. 45-51<br>
(2 )03).<br><br>
Other in vivo and in vitro testing methods are also well known in the art.<br>
Limited automated methods for facilitating genotoxicity screening ("screening"<br>
being understood to refer to the analysis of biological material samples previously treated with<br>
the test compound) of both in vivo and in vitro materials have also been attempted. As an<br>
example, art automated in vivo micronucleus assay analysis of mouse bone marrow used in the<br>
pharmaceutical industry to test the genotoxicity potential of new compounds is described in a<br>
publication co-authored by the inventor of the present invention which is titled "Technical<br>
aspects of automatic micronucleus analysis in rodent bone," Cell Biology and Toxicology, vol.<br>
10, pp. 283 -289 (1994). Automated forms of analysis for in vitro micronucleus tests are also<br>
known. The inventor of the present invention authored an article titled "Automatic analysis of<br>
t le in vitro micronucleus test on V79 cells" in Mutation Research, vol. 413, pp. 57-68 (1998),<br>
cescribing an automated in vitro micronucleus test for V79 cells.<br>
The techniques for automated genotoxicity screening for both in vivo and in<br>
Nitro biological material that were noted above utilize image analysis software and techniques<br>
mat are individually designed for the specific type of test and the specific type of material that<br>
i being screened. Automation of genotoxicity testing that utilizes image analysis simplifies the<br>
process of compound screening, eliminates the tedium of manual scoring and significantly<br>
Ficreases the overall number of genotoxicity screenings which can be performed in any given<br>
period of time. Generally, an automated electronically driven microscope with image<br>
capturing capabilities and a micro-processor based computer running microscope control and<br>
inage analysis software, each specifically designed, calibrated and programmed for the<br>
rarticular screening being performed, is used to operate and facilitate the image analysis-based<br>
automated screening process.<br>
To provide still further increases in the throughput of genotoxicity sample<br>
screening, prior art devices are known to have incorporated robotic arm assemblies and<br>
equivalent devices to facilitate sample slide feeding, thus freeing the user from the tedium of<br>
nanually loading slides for image analysis and further increasing screening throughput rates.<br>
Known prior art systems do not, however, allow for both in vivo and in vitro<br>
cenotoxicity screening using a single platform to perform automatically all manners of in vitro<br>
and in vivo genotoxicity testing such as the micronucleus test, the comet assay and metaphase<br><br>
detection for chromosome analysis, nor do any known prior art system provide for utilization<br>
of a rot otic slide feeder or equivalent device for all manner of in vitro and in vivo testing<br>
without the tedium of extensive user intervention.<br>

Detailed Description of an Embodiment of the Invention<br>
Described herein is a single automated platform for genotoxicity screening<br>
which can accommodate both in vivo and in vitro micronucleus testing, comet assay screening<br>
and in, vitro metaphase finding, but requires minimal user monitoring and/or user interaction.<br>
As will be more fully described, the present invention is an automated system<br>
and method for performing sample analysis for genotoxicity testing. An embodiment of the<br>
invenire system Includes: (1) a robotic slide feeder, (2) an electronically driven microscope,<br>
(3) an image capturing apparatus, (4) a microprocessor-based computer running program<br>
contro software, and (5) required communication cables and interface apparatus for<br>
interconnecting the various components, The invention is embodied in a system and method as<br>
exempt t ed in the embodiments described below, but is not limited to the details of those<br>
embodimentsnts. One skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the invention may include and<br>
utilize equivalent components and processes that fall within the scope of the invention, which<br>
invention is defined solely by the claims that will accompany this disclosure. Moreover, the<br>
inventior an comprise aspects of the foregoing components and their interrelationship to one<br>
another, rehiding, without limitation, programmed control of such components.<br><br>
Using the inventive automated genotoxicity analysis system and method, a<br>
laboratory technician or other user may optimally process, for analysis, successive batches of<br>
slic es containing biological material using different tests and different types of biological<br>
maerial for each batch, without the need to manually adjust any hardware and with only<br>
rminiimal user interaction.<br>
As will be more fully described below, the method of operation of the<br>
automated genotoxicity analysis system of the present invention proceeds as follows. A<br>
lab bratory technician or other user prepares a batch of slides for genotoxicity screening. These<br>
slices may include in vivo or in vitro biological materials and may be prepared for screening<br>
by any of the following (or additional) tests: (1) in vivo micronucleus test, (2) in vitro<br>
moni ronucleus test, (3) in vitro or in vivo comet assay and (4) in vitro metaphase finding. Once<br>
tt e slides are prepared for testing, the user selects the appropriate genotoxicity test system<br>
(from the described list of possibilities) from a menu or equivalent user interface displayed on<br>
the screen of he microprocessor based computer. The robotic slide feeder then automatically<br>
ret ieves the first of the slides from the batch prepared by the user and delivers the slide to the<br>
electronically driven microscope, which then automatically and appropriately focuses on the<br>
material contained on the slide. Next, the image capturing apparatus records a visual<br>
resresentatior of the focused image and delivers it to the microprocessor-based computer. The<br>
mmicroprocessor-based computer then performs image analysis on the recorded image using the<br>
aproropriate image analysis software preloaded on the computer. The computer then records<br>
the data resuling from the analysis of the image until either the given delimiting number of<br>
ce1 s have been counted or the maximum number of image fields to be analyzed has been<br>
reached for the slide currently under analysis. Once the analysis of the slide is complete, the<br>
robotic slide feeder returns the slide to the slide rack and retrieves the next slide for analysis.<br>
This process continues until all of the slides in the batch have been analyzed. The user may<br>
then prepare ,tnew batch of slides of any type of in vivo or in vitro material and initiate<br>
animated screening of the material using any of the genotoxicity assays described above<br>
wi hout the need to manually change or modify any of the system equipment.<br>

incluiding necessary library files provided by third party vendors for controlling operation of<br>
the electronicaily driven microscope 150 and frame grabber board 120.<br><br>
The source code for certain of the above-described library link and DLL files 220<br>
defefne the algorithm and image analysis processing that is conducted for the various<br>
screenings.<br>
The image analysis processing for the micronucleus test in vivo uses red and blue<br>
canera channel information and thresholding techniques for discrimination<br>
between polychromatic and normochromatic erythrocytes. Thereafter, gradient and watershed<br>
transformation for segmentation of micronucleus candidates is utilized. Individual analysis of<br>
segmented objects uses supervised training of patterns on the basis of morphometric features,<br>
as well as structural features such as "periphery percentage," "focus deviation" and "gray<br>
deviation." Reference may be made to the applicable source code described above for further<br>
de a 1.<br>
Metaph use finding utilizes differences of spectral images as the gray image basis and<br>
thereafter utilizes a combination of watershed transformation and "top-hat" segmentation for<br>
nucleus candidate segmentation. That is followed by restriction of metaphase range on non-<br>
nuclar regions which is followed thereafter with another application of top-hat and watershed<br>
segmentation. Finally, feature base metaphase candidate classification, involving individual<br>
parameters for chromsomal structuring, is applied. Reference may be made to the applicable<br>
source code described above for further detail.<br>
Comet assay analysis involves red channel uses of fluorescence image on a first run to<br>
detect valid nuclei, including classification on morphometric features. Automatic relocation of<br>
detected nuclei for tail moment measurement and use of a sequentially degrading thresholding<br>
tecluique which involves a gradient for the pixel sum change in the image is also utilized.<br>
Refrenence may be made to the applicable source code described above for further detail.<br>
The micronucleus test in vitro uses all three color channel images. The image<br>
algorithms attenpt segmentation of valid nuclei and cytoplasm range, and then detect<br>
micronucleus candidates using a combination of gradient, top-hat and thresholding<br>
segmentation. Final classification uses an off-line trained backpropagational neural network<br>
for predicting the probability of a true micronucleus. Reference may be made to the applicable<br>
source code described above for further detail.<br><br>
Continuing with Figure 2, application software 200 further includes parameter<br>
libs 230 which store information about the proper settings for the operation of electronically<br>
craven microscope 150 and the image analysis software operating on genotoxicity analysis<br>
system 100, depending upon the particular analysis being conducted. Each of the parameters<br>
and adjustments varies depending on the genotoxicity test to be conducted and is set<br>
automatically by designating the particular test.<br>
Parameter files 230 include the following files:<br>
-	"cometpar.txt" 290 - contains parameters for the configuration of the<br>
image analysts algorithms used for the Comet assay application;<br>

to itains parameter data that controls the automatic focus features of electronically driven<br>
microscope 150 in connection with the autofocus execution for Datainput.exe 252 and<br>
AutoScan.exe; 256. Parameter file 230 called "focus_reloc.txt" 286 generally contains the<br>
same parameter definitions as "focus_std.txt" 284, but is more refined to allow for autofocus<br>
performance that is better suited for operation under Relocation.exe 254. Parameter file 230<br>
labeled "scantef.txt" 288 contains parameter data that is used for the configuration of<br>
electronically operated microscope 150 depending on the selected application. Such<br>
configuration includes automatic adjustment of optical modules of the microscope, and setting<br>
general parameters referring to the scanning process of the application.<br>
Also, the parameter file 230 called "roboplace.txt" 296 contains parameter data<br>
to control the initialization and placement of robotic slide feeder 160. These parameters<br>
include x,y positioning and speed.<br>
Each of "focus_std.txt" and "focus_reloc.txt," are particularized for the<br>
sceening tes being performed, i.e., there exists a "focus_std.txt" and "focus_reloc.txt" for<br><br>
sach of the in vivo micronucleus test, in vitro micronucleus test, comet assay or in vitro<br>
netaphase finding. Computer Program Listing Appendix stores the parameter files 230 for<br>
:ach screening type in respective file folders.<br>
More particularly, Computer Program Listing Appendix includes a folder<br>
lamed "Applications" which includes subfolders labeled "COMETASSAY" containing the<br>
above described parameter files 230 used for comet assay analysis. Similarly, the subfolder<br>
called "METFIN" contains the above described parameter files for metaphase finding analysis,<br>

iuecronucleus test analysis.<br>
The subfolder called "MOLYMNT" contains the above described parameter<br>
tiles for in vitro micronucleus test analysis. The "MOLMNT" subfolder further includes a file<br>
called "p21h9.net" and includes parameters for the neural network pattern prediction and<br>
cassification utilized for the in vitro micronucleus test analysis.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, "robias.txt," which holds system specific<br>
information for the application in general for genotoxiciy analysis system 100 and<br>
" oboplace.txt" 296, which contains parameters for use by robotic slide feeder 160 during<br>
initialization, reside locally on the hard drive of computer 110 while the remaining programs<br>
and files reside on a networked server connected to computer 110.<br>
In addition to the above-described parameter data files, calibration files<br>
conntaining "shadimages", including "shadref_black" and "shadref_whitbl", are referenced by<br>
the executable programs 210. One skilled in the art may generate these files to provide<br>
colibration for shading correction. Calibration files are particular to each screening<br>
publication. The calibration files are preferably stored in a subdirectory that is parallel to the<br>
respective subdirectories containing the parameter data.<br>
Application software 200 of Figure 2 further includes data results files 240<br>
which are generated and modified by executable programs 210.<br>
There are three types of data results files 240 having the following forms:<br>
(1)	&gt; scanresults/<study>/<experiment>/<slidename> .txt;<br>
(2)	 &gt; individualdata/<study>/<experiment>/<slidenamo.txt></slidenamo.txt>
and<br><br>
(3)  &gt;slidedata/slidedata<rackposition> .txt<br>
In the above-listed file formats for data results files 240,  &gt; indicates the<br>
preliminary file path of the directory containing the file at issue. This part of the path may<br>
vary depending upon how the file structure of the overall operational software is configured,<br>
"scanresults," individualdata" and "slidedata" represent respective subfolder names for the<br>
files.  represents a placeholder for the study name coding the toxicological testing of<br>
i certain test compound and is correlated with a unique "study name", <experiment><br>
represents a placeholder for a particular experiment in the context of the selected study.<br>
Experiments belonging to a specific study can vary with respect to treatment time or the<br>
aosence or presence of the metabolic activation of cells, or sampling time after treatment of<br>
aiimals. Generally, it specifies the "experimental" conditions for the same test compound of<br>
interest. <slidename> represents a placeholder for the identity of a particular slide and<br> represents a placeholder for a particular position of a slide in a rack.<br>
The operation of genotoxicity analysis system 100 will now be described with<br>
reference to (he flow chart of Figure 3 and the exemplary screen interfaces of genotoxicitiy<br>
analysis system 100 illustrated in Figures 4 through 14.<br>
At step 302 of the process of Figure 3, the user selects one of Datalnput.exe,<br>
Auto Scan.exe and Relocation.exe for execution from the main display screen of color display<br>
monitor 130. Bach application is preferably represented as an application or shortcut icon on<br>
the main display screen of the Windows NT platform. The user may select the desired<br>
program by double clicking the corresponding icon in the known manner.<br>
If the user desires to enter information for each slide that is to be analyzed, the<br>
uss, selects the icon representing Datalnput.exe for execution at step 302. As a result, the<br>
process proceeds to step 304 where the form illustrated in Figure 4 is displayed to the user,<br>
thing the fonr of Figure 4, the user specifies the current application, i.e., the analysis that is<br>
to be performed, by selecting a unique path to which the slide data will be written. Thus,<br>
selection of the path also designates the analysis that will be performed, i.e., comet assay,<br>
micronucleus test in vivo, micronucleus test in vitro or metaphase finding. The form of Figure<br>
4 is seated from the source code found in the file called "frolmite" in the<br><br>
VB6/T00 LFORMS subdirectory of the Computer Program Listing Appendix for this<br>
document.<br>
The process then moves to step 306 where the form illustrated in Figure 5 is<br>
displayed to the user. Using this form, the user enters data for identifying each slide that is to<br>
the processed. The identification string for each slide consists of a study name (col. 501),<br>
tollowed b&gt; experiment name (col. 502) and a slide code (col, 503), each of which may utilize<br>
Lumerals ot characters. It is noted that the exemplary slide codes 503 presented in figure 5 are<br>
appended by "a" and "b." In the presently disclosed embodiment of the present invention, two<br>
simples of biological material may be included on each slide, one designated by "a", the other<br>
by "b." The precision provided by the components of genotoxicity analysis system 100 in<br>
combination with application software 200 allows for this efficient use of slide space which<br>
effectively doubles slide capacity for screening.<br>
For slides sharing the same study and experiment code, a common folder for<br>
resulting storage will be created. The form of Figure 5 is created from source code found in<br>
the; file called "frmSlides.frm" in the VB6/DATAINPUT subdirectory of the Computer<br>
Program Lisiitig Appendix for this document.<br>
At step 308, the user accepts the settings entered at step 306 by pressing the<br>
"accept settings" button 506 of the form of Figure 5, at which point the system ends operation<br>
of Datalnput exe, creates all necessary folders (for studies and experiments) and data files and<br>
returns to step 302 of Figure 3.<br>
Alternately, at step 310, the user may select any of the respective detail buttons<br>
(see column 504 of the form of Figure 5) for each slide to adjust specific parameters relating to<br>
each slide. Figure 6 represents the form presented to the user for adjusting the parameters for<br>
a particular slide. The form of Figure 6 is created from the source code found in the file called<br>
fire Slideparam frm in the VB6/DATAINPUT subdirectory of the Computer Program Listing<br>
A poendix for this document.<br>
Among the various parameters that the form of Figure 6 allows a user to control<br>
is threshold adjustment (button 602) and microscope adjustment (button 604).<br>
The form for providing the user the ability to adjust the threshold settings for<br>
the particular slide is illustrated in Figure 7. This form is created from the source code found<br><br>
i the file called "frmlnterThresh.frm" in the VB6/T00LF0RMS subdirectory of the<br>
Computer Program Listing Appendix for this document. The form for providing the user the<br>
ability to adjust microscope parameters for the particular slide at issue is illustrated in Fig. 8.<br>
This form is created from source code found in the file called "frmAdjustMicro.frm" in the<br>
VB6/TOOLFORMS subdirectory of the Computer Program Listing Appendix for this<br>
document.<br>
Once the user is satisfied with the adjustments made to the particular slides, the<br>
user may select the "acc. Settings for ALL slides" button 606 of the form of Figure 6 which<br>
will set these parameters for all previously identified slides that have valid slide code entries in<br>
the form of Figure 5. Alternatively, the user may select the "ace. settings for CURRENT<br>
slide" (button 608) which saves parameter settings only for the currently selected slide.<br>
Control is then returned to the form of Figure 5 (step 306).<br>
Returning now to step 302 of the process illustrated in Figure 3, if the user<br>
selects the icon to initiate execution of AutoScan.exe, the process moves to step 312 where the<br>
f rom illustrated in Figure 8a is presented to the user. Here, the user selects the genotoxicity<br>
tos. that will he processed, i.e., one of the comet assay, micronucleus in vivo, micronucleus in<br>
vitro or metaphase finding analyis, by selecting the respective subdirectory illustrated in<br>
window 802 in the form of Figure 8a. The form of Figure 8a is created from source code<br>
found in the file called "frmlnit.from" in the VB6/TOOLFORMS subdirectory of the Computer<br>
Pro gram Listing Appendix for this document.<br>
The process then proceeds to step 314 where the form of Figure 9 is presented<br>
to the user. The form of Figure 9 allows the user to select the scanning options for the<br>
genotxicity analysis to be performed as was specified at step 312 using the form of Figure 8.<br>
The options presented by the form of Figure 9 include: (1) scanning the slides without display<br>
(button 902), meaning that no intermediate image display will be presented to the user during<br>
analysis of the slides; (2) scanning the slides with display (button 904), meaning that the most<br>
important intermediate image processing results will be displayed during analysis without<br>
req liring user interaction to continue analysis; (3) scanning the slides with Testl level (button<br>
9(), meaning that several intermediate image processing steps are performed and the process<br>
is t: en halted until the user presses a key to continue automatic analysis; and (4) scanning the<br><br>
slides wit a Test2 level (button 908), which results in operation similar to that of button 906<br>
except that detection results are not displayed. This last mode is utilized to validate operation<br>
of the application where a user performs manual analysis of a slide in parallel with automated<br>
analysis in the same image fields. Finally, the user may press button 910 for scanning the<br>
slides with autofocus test, which processes the slides while presenting a graphical display of<br>
the autofocus results, e.g., contrast curve, for each slide.<br>
The user may also abort running the analysis by pressing the exit button 912.<br>
If the user does not abort the automatic scanning, the process proceeds to step<br>
116 and the automatic scanning is executed by referencing the applicable library link and DLL<br>
tiles 220 and parameter files 230 of application software 200 for the specific type of analysis<br>
teing performed. The form of Figure 9 is created from source code found in the file called<br>
frmMain.frm" in the VB6/AUTOMATICSCAN subdirectory of the Computer Program<br>
I isting Appendix for this document.<br>
When the automatic scanning is complete and all results data has been written<br>
and stored, the process returns to step 302 of Figure 3.<br>
If at step 302, the user executes Relocations.exe, the process of Figure 3<br>
proceeds to step 318 where the form of Figure 10 is presented to the user. Using the form of<br>
Figure 10, the user selects the genotoxicity test for which results are to be reviewed, i.e., one<br>
of the comet issay, micronucleus in vivo, micronudeus in vitro or metaphase finding analyis,<br>
by selecting the respective subdirectory illustrated in window 1002 in the form of Figure 10.<br>
The form of Figure 10 is created from the source code found in the file called "frmlnit.frm" in<br>
the VB6/TOCLFORMS subdirectory of the Computer Program Listing Appendix for this<br>
document.<br>
The process then proceeds to step 320 where the user is presented with forms to<br>
select a specif c slide to be reviewed. More particularly, the user is presented with the forms<br>
the trated in F igures 11 and 12. In the form of Figure 11, the user selects the particular study<br>
con aining the slide by selecting the appropriate subdirectory labeled with the appropriate study<br>
and experimem name (see window 1102). Using the form of Figure 12, the user identifies the<br>
palcular slide by selecting the file containing the slide data (see window 1202). The form of<br>
Figure 11 is created from source code found in the file called "frmMain.frm" in the<br><br>
VI 6/RELOCATION subdirectory of the Computer Program Listing Appendix for this<br>
document. The form of Figure 12 is created using a standard Visual Basic CommonDialog<br>
USER interface object.<br>
Next, at step 322, the user is presented with the form of Figure 13 which<br>
includes a display (window 1302) of the scanning results associated with the slide specified<br>
using the form of Figure 12. The form of Figure 13 is similar to that of Figure 11 except that it<br>
row includes, in window 1302, the most relevant data that had been acquired during automatic<br>
slile analysis, such as the number of detected objects, number of scanned fields, error codes,<br>
and other application specific information for the slide under review.<br>
The user may exit Relocation.exe by eliciting button 1304 of the form of Figure<br>
3 (step 324) at which point the process of Figure 3 returns to step 302.<br>
Alternatively, the user may select button 1306 of the form of Figure 13 causing<br>
the process of Figure 3 to move to step 326 at which point the user is presented with the form<br>
or Figure 14 The form of Figure 14 allows a user to retrieve the objects that had been<br>
detected during the automatic scanning process. For this purpose, one can move from one<br>
object to another (and then back again) using the arrow buttons 1402 and 1404. Using the<br>
additional controls presented in the form of Figure 14, each object's coordinates, which had<br>
been stored during scanning, and the current live image showing the object are displayed on<br>
color display screens 130 and 132 for visual inspection. The user may operate the right or left<br>
n ouse button to flag an object under observation and discard an object as a valid micronucleus<br>
(by using the left mouse button) or accept an object as a valid micronucleus (using the right<br>
mouse button). By moving from the first detected object to the last for each slide, the user can<br>
assign the proper label (i.e., "accept" or "reject") to each object and, therefore, adjust the<br>
result of automatic scanning through supervised visual inspection. The corrected result for the<br>
current slide, i.e. the number of micronuclei for micronucleus application, or number of<br>
metaphases for metaphase finding application, will be stored after exiting the form of Figure<br>
14. The othir options present in the form in Figure 14 support the adjustment of the current<br>
image, e.g. microscope and focus, and support image analysis for other objects of interest in<br>
c rder to confirm proper performance of the the algorithms utilized for image analysis.<br><br>
The form of Figure 14 is created from source code found in the file called<br>
"FrmRelocation.frm" in the VB6/RELOCATION subdirectory of the Computer Program<br>
L sting Appendix for this document.<br>
Thus, it is seen by the above, that by creating software code which can facilitate<br>
different types of genotoxicity screening and which references parameter data files respectively<br>
configured for each of various genotoxicity tests, the genotoxicity analysis system of the<br>
present inversion provides a flexible and easy to use platform for performing various<br>
genotoxicity screenings with minimal user interaction. Depending upon the type of screenings<br>
being performed, no manual microscope module adaptation is necessary between screening<br>
runs for different analysis testing. In the case of comet assay screening, a manual change to<br>
iuident illumination to support fluorescence staining in comet assay analysis and then back to<br>
transmitted light illumination for other genotoxicity screenings may be necessary. Moreover,<br>
as described above, the genotoxicity analysis system of the present invention allows interactive<br>
pattern control to permit a user to manually perform artifact rejection for objects wrongly<br>
c a isified dur ng automatic scanning.<br>
