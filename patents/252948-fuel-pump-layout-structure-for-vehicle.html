[Title of the Invention]<br>
Fuel Pump Layout Structure for Vehicle [Technical Field] [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to an improvement in fuel pump layout structure for a vehicle. [Background Art] [0002]<br>
Conventionally known is a fuel pump layout structure for a vehicle such that a fuel pump is located between a pair of right and left frame members extending rearward from a head pipe (see Patent Document 1, for example).<br>
[ Patent Document 1]<br>
Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2005-96504 [0003]<br>
Referring to FIGS. 2 and 3 in Patent Document 1, there is shown a motorcycle having a body frame F including a head pipe Fh, a pair of right and left main pipes MP extending rearward from the head pipe Fh so as to be inclined downward, a pair of right and left pivot plates 5 respectively connected to the rear ends of the right and left main pipes MP, and a pair of right and left down tubes DT extending substantially vertically<br><br>
downward from the head pipe Fh. An engine E is mounted to<br>
the body frame F. A throttle body TB is located behind a<br>
cylinder head CH of the engine E and between the right<br>
and left main frames MP. A spare fuel tank Ts containing<br>
a fuel pump is mounted to an upper portion of a rear<br>
extended portion CRa constituting a rear portion of a<br>
crankcase CR of the engine E at a position below the<br>
throttle body TB.<br>
[Disclosure of the Invention]<br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
[0004]<br>
As mentioned above, the throttle body TB and the spare fuel tank Ts containing the fuel pump are located in the space between the right and left main pipes MP and above the engine E. This space is limited in its lateral distance by the main pipes MP. As a result, the throttle body TB and the spare fuel tank Ts must be vertically arranged.  Further, the vertical position of the throttle body TB is determined by the position of the cylinder head CH, so that the fuel pump contained in the spare fuel tank Ts must be located between the engine E and the throttle body TB.<br>
Accordingly, the flexibility of layout and design of the fuel pump is limited.  Also in another body frame<br><br>
structure different from the structure mentioned above, it is desired to increase the flexibility of layout and design of a fuel pump.<br>
It is accordingly an object of the present invention to increase the flexibility of layout and design of a fuel pump.<br>
[Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
[0005]<br>
In accordance with the invention as defined in claim 1, there is provided in a vehicle including a single frame member arranged along a center line extending in the longitudinal direction of said vehicle at the lateral center thereof, a fuel tank mounted on an upper portion of said frame member independently of a fuel pump, an engine located below said frame member, and a throttle body located behind said engine; a fuel pump layout structure characterized in that said fuel pump is located opposite to said throttle body with respect to said frame member as viewed in plan and juxtaposed to said throttle body in the lateral direction of said vehicle.<br>
[0006]<br>
With this arrangement, the throttle body and the fuel pump are juxtaposed in the lateral direction of the<br><br>
vehicle on the laterally opposite sides of the frame member as viewed in plan.  Thus, the frame member is located laterally inside of the fuel pump, and the engine is located below the fuel pump. Accordingly, the position of the fuel pump is not limited on the upper side and laterally outer side thereof.<br>
[0007]<br>
In accordance with the invention as defined in claim 2, a lower frame member extending downward is connected to the rear end of said frame member, and said fuel pump and said throttle body are located between said engine and the unit of said frame member and said lower frame member as viewed in side elevation.<br>
[0008]<br>
With this arrangement, the fuel pump and the throttle body are located in the space between the engine and the unit of the frame member and the lower frame member, so that this space can be effectively used. Further, the fuel pump and the throttle body as relatively massive components can be located near the engine, thereby attaining the concentration of mass.<br>
[0009]<br>
In accordance with the invention as defined in claim 3, an exhaust pipe extends from a front portion of<br><br>
said engine along a lower portion of said engine toward a rear portion of said vehicle, and said fuel pump is located at such a position that said exhaust pipe is blocked by said engine.<br>
With this arrangement, heat radiated from the exhaust pipe can be blocked by the engine, thereby preventing the transmission of the heat to the fuel pump. [0010]<br>
In accordance with the invention as defined in claim 4, a fuel pipe unit extends from a rear portion of said fuel pump and is connected to a front portion of a fuel injection valve provided in said throttle body.<br>
With this arrangement, the fuel pipe unit extends from the rear portion of the fuel pump, thereby suppressing the influence of heat from the engine.<br>
Further, the fuel pipe unit is connected to the fuel injection valve from the front side thereof, so that the fuel pipe unit can be arranged along the frame member so as to be spaced apart from the engine.  Further, the fuel pipe unit can be so arranged as to extend like an S shape, so that undue bend of the fuel pipe unit in a short distance can be prevented. [Effects of the Invention]<br><br>
According to the invention as defined in claim 1, the vehicle includes the single frame member arranged along the center line extending in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle at the lateral center thereof, the fuel tank mounted on the upper portion of the frame member independently of the fuel pump, the engine located below the frame member, and the throttle body located behind the engine, wherein the fuel pump is located opposite to the throttle body with respect to the frame member as viewed in plan and juxtaposed to the throttle body in the lateral direction of the vehicle.  Accordingly, the position of the fuel pump is not limited on the upper side and laterally outer side thereof, so that the flexibility of layout and design of the fuel pump can be increased. [0012]<br>
According to the invention as defined in claim 2, the lower frame member extending downward is connected to the rear end of the frame member, and the fuel pump and the throttle body are located between the engine and the unit of the frame member and the lower frame member as viewed in side elevation. Accordingly, the space between the engine and the unit of the frame member and the lower frame member can be effectively used.  Further, the fuel<br><br>
pump and the throttle body as relatively massive components can be located near the engine, thereby attaining the concentration of mass at the center of the vehicle body. Accordingly, the drivability of the vehicle can be improved. [0013]<br>
According to the invention as defined in claim 3, the exhaust pipe extends from the front portion of the engine along the lower portion of the engine toward the rear portion of the vehicle, and the fuel pump is located at such a position that the exhaust pipe is blocked by the engine. Accordingly, heat radiated from the exhaust pipe can be blocked by the engine, thereby preventing the transmission of the heat to the fuel pump. [0014]<br>
According to the invention as defined in claim 4, the fuel pipe unit extends from the rear portion of the fuel pump and is connected to the front portion of the fuel injection valve provided in the throttle body.  Since the fuel pipe unit extends from the rear portion of the fuel pump, the influence of heat from the engine located before the throttle body can be suppressed.  Further, since the fuel pipe unit is connected to the fuel injection valve from the front side thereof, the fuel<br><br>
pipe unit can be arranged along the frame member so as to be spaced apart from the engine.  Further, the fuel pipe unit can be so arranged as to extend like an S shape, so that undue bend of the fuel pipe unit in a short distance can be prevented.<br>
[Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention]<br>
[0015]<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to the attached drawings. The orientation of each drawing is the same as that of the reference numerals included therein.<br>

The body frame 11 further includes a reinforcing frame 54 and reinforcing plates 56 and 57.<br>
[0017]<br>
The down frame 48 and the pivot plates 18 are members for supporting the engine 17. Reference numeral 61 denotes a bracket for mounting the front portion of the engine 17 to the down frame 4 8.<br>
[0018]<br>
The engine 17 includes a cranlccase 66 having a rear portion integral with a transmission 65, a cylinder block 68 mounted to the upper portion of the crankcase 66, a cylinder head 71 mounted to the upper portion of the cylinder block 68, a head cover 72 for covering the upper portion of the cylinder head 71, an intake device 73 mounted to the rear portion of the cylinder head 71, and an exhaust device 74 mounted to the front portion of the cylinder head 71.<br><br>
The intake device 73 includes an intake pipe 7 6 mounted to the rear portion of the cylinder head 71, a throttle body 77 connected to the rear end of the intake pipe 76, a connecting tube 78 connected to the rear end of the throttle body 77 and extending rearward, and an air cleaner 81 connected to the rear end of the connecting tube 7 8. [0020]<br>
The throttle body 77 includes a throttle valve and a fuel injection valve.  Fuel stored in the fuel tank 24 is supplied to the fuel injection valve by a fuel pump 83 provided independently of the fuel tank 24.  The fuel supplied to the fuel injection valve is injected into the throttle body 77 to form an air-fuel mixture, which is in turn supplied to a combustion chamber formed between the cylinder block 68 and the cylinder head 71, and the air-fuel mixture is burned in the combustion chamber. [0021]<br>
The exhaust device 74 includes an exhaust pipe 86 mounted to the front portion of the cylinder head 71 and extending along the front portion and lower portion of the engine 17 toward the rear side of the engine 17, a submuffler 87 provided at the middle of the exhaust pipe 86, and a main muffler 88 connected to the rear end of<br><br>
the exhaust pipe 86.<br>
[0022]<br>
As mentioned above with reference to FIG. 1, the present invention is characterized in that the exhaust pipe 86 extends from the front portion of the engine 17 along the lower portion of the engine 17 toward the rear portion of the vehicle body and that the fuel pump 83 is located at such a position that the exhaust pipe 86 and the submuffler 87 are blocked by the engine 17.<br>
[0023]<br>
Thus, the exhaust pipe 86 and the submuffler 87 are located below the engine 17, more specifically, the crankcase 66,   and the fuel pump 8 3 is located above the crankcase 66. Accordingly, heat radiated from the exhaust pipe 86 and the submuffler 87 can be blocked by the crankcase 66, thereby preventing the transmission of the heat to the fuel pump 83.<br>
[0024]<br>
FIG. 2 is a side view of an essential part of the vehicle 10 shown in FIG. 1 (in which the arrow denoted by<br>
"FRONT" represents the front side of the vehicle, and the same applies to the other drawings).  As shown in FIG. 2, the center frame 42 and a cushion supporting bracket 91 for supporting the upper end of the rear cushion unit 34<br><br>
are mounted to the rear end portion of the main frame 41, and a pump supporting bracket 92 for supporting the fuel pump 83 is mounted to the center frame 42.  Reference numerals 93 and 94 denote a bolt and nut for mounting the rear cushion unit 34 to the cushion supporting bracket 91.<br>
[0025]<br>
The fuel pump 83 has a front bracket 96 fixed at a central portion of the fuel pump 83 in its longitudinal direction.  The front bracket 96 is mounted to the pump supporting bracket 92 by two bolts 97.<br>
[0026]<br>
The fuel pump 83 is located on the left side of the<br>
throttle body 77 in the lateral direction of the vehicle. As viewed in side elevation, the throttle body 77 and the fuel pump 83 are located between the unit of the cylinder block 68 and the cylinder head 71 constituting the engine 17 and the unit of the main frame 41 and the center frame 42. [0027]<br>
A fuel injection valve 101 is mounted to the upper portion of the throttle body 77 so as to be inclined downward to the front side. A fuel outlet 83a is formed at the upper rear portion of the fuel pump 83.  The fuel<br><br>
outlet 83a of the fuel pump 83 and the fuel injection valve 101 are connected to each other by a fuel pipe unit 102.  Reference numeral 103 denotes an insulator as an intake pipe for connecting the cylinder head 71 and the throttle body 77.<br>
[0028]<br>
The fuel pipe unit 102 includes a tube 104, an inlet connector 105 mounted at one end of the tube 104 for connecting the tube 104 to the outlet 83a of the fuel pump 83, and an outlet connector 106 mounted at the other end of the tube 104 for connecting the tube 104 to the fuel injection valve 101 of the throttle body 77.<br>
[0029]<br>
As mentioned above with reference to FIG. 2, the present invention is characterized in that the center frame 42 as a lower frame member extending downward is connected to the rear end of the main frame 41 and that the fuel pump 83 and the throttle body 77 are located between the engine 17 and the unit of the main frame 41 and the center frame 42 as viewed in side elevation.<br>
[0030]<br>
With this arrangement, the space between the engine 17 and the unit of the main frame 41 and the center frame 42 can be effectively used, and the throttle body 77 and<br><br>
the fuel pump 83 as relatively massive components can be located near the engine 17, thereby attaining the concentration of mass at the center of the vehicle body. Accordingly, the drivability of the vehicle 10 (see PIG. 1) can be improved. [0031]<br>
FIG. 3 is a perspective view of the essential part shown in FIG. 2, showing the layout of the fuel pump 83 and the throttle body 77 (the contour of the throttle body 77 being shown by a heavy line) such that the fuel pump 83 and the throttle body 77 are arranged in the lateral direction of the vehicle at a position behind the cylinder block 68 and the cylinder head 71 of the engine 17 and above the crankcase 66 of the engine 17. [0032]<br>
With this arrangement, there is no obstacle on the laterally outer side and upper side of the throttle body 77 and the fuel pump 83, so that the flexibility of layout and design of the throttle body 77 and the fuel pump 83 can be increased. [0033]<br>
FIG. 4 is a view taken in the direction shown by an arrow 4 in FIG. 2, showing the layout that the main frame 41 is arranged along a center line 110 extending in the<br><br>
longitudinal direction of the vehicle at the lateral center thereof and that the throttle body 77 and the fuel pump 83 are arranged side by side in the lateral direction of the vehicle with the main frame 41 (or the center line 110) interposed therebetween as viewed in plan.<br>
The fuel injection valve 101 is provided with a fuel inlet 111 adapted to be connected to the outlet connector 106 (see FIG. 2) of the fuel pump unit 102 (see FIG. 2) .  The fuel inlet 111 is inclined leftward to the front side of the vehicle. [0034]<br>
Reference numeral 112 shown by a dot &amp; dash line connecting the fuel outlet 83a of the fuel pump 83 and the fuel inlet 111 of the fuel injection valve 101 denotes the center line of the tube 104 (see FIG. 2) and the outlet connector 106 (see FIG. 2) . As apparent from FIG. 4, the center line 112 extends like an S shape from the position behind the fuel pump 83 to the position before the fuel injection valve 101.<br>
In this manner, the tube 104 can be arranged along the main frame 41 so as to be spaced apart from the engine 17, more specifically, the cylinder head 71. Further, since the tube 104 extends like an S shape.<br><br>
undue bend of the tube 104 in a short distance can be prevented.<br>
[0035]<br>
As mentioned above with reference to FIGS. 1 and 4, the present invention is characterized in that the vehicle 10 includes the main frame 41 as a single frame member arranged along the center line 110 extending in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle at the lateral center thereof, the fuel tank 24 mounted on the upper portion of the main frame 41 independently of the fuel pump 83, the engine 17 located below the main frame 41, and the throttle body 77 located behind the engine 17, wherein the fuel pump 83 is located opposite to the throttle body 77 with respect to the main frame 41 (or the center line 110) as viewed in plan and juxtaposed to the throttle body 77 in the lateral direction of the vehicle.<br>
With this arrangement, the position of the fuel pump 83 is not limited on the upper side and laterally outer side thereof, so that the flexibility of layout and design of the fuel pump 83 can be increased.<br>

the fuel pipe unit 102 extends from the rear portion of the fuel pump 83 and is connected to the front portion of the fuel injection valve 101 provided in the throttle body 77.<br>
[0037]<br>
With this arrangement, the fuel pipe unit 102 extends from the rear portion of the fuel pump 83, thereby suppressing the influence of heat from the engine 17 located on the front side of the throttle body 77. Further, the fuel pipe unit 102 is connected to the fuel injection valve 101 from the front side thereof, so that the fuel pipe unit 102 can be arranged along the main frame 41 so as to be spaced apart from the engine 17. Further, the fuel pipe unit 102 can be so arranged as to extend like an S shape, so that undue bend of the fuel pipe unit 102 in a short distance can be prevented.<br>
