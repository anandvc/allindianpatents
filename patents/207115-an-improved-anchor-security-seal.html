				<td>other fraudulent practices. The brunt of loss is usually borne by multitude of helpless customers. In an ongoing lookout for a low-cost, yet effective device, a security seal has been designed which is an improvement over and modification of the device described in the complete specification of my main Patent Application The device of the present invention is capable of being used as an effective seal to prevent pilferage, tampering and / or theft of water, gas, petrol, diesel and electric maters and also as a means for preventing adulteration of edible substances during storage, transit and / or distribution.<br>
Heretofore mainly lead seals were used with G.I. wire to make facilities pilfer-proof. These seals normally comprised of two metal bodies having recesses in between for insertion of wire. Such wire was passed through bodies, installations or equipments which were to be sealed and in turn was allowed to be inserted through the recess provided between two sheets of metal bodies. On being pressed with an instrument bearing logo or insignia of the concern or company handling such matters, the seal was put on. Such sealing devices suffered from a number of drawbacks, e.g. the seal being essentially two soft and malleable metal bodies, one could easily force them open with the tip of a sharp instrument like knife and reset by applying pressure, without leaving discerning evidence of tampering. Soft and malleable metal bodies could be restored to their original position and such sequence of steps may be repeated many times over, particularly by people who have had access to the equipment for applying pressure with insignia or logo marked on the working lips thereof.<br>
Apart from the foregoing, the conventional sealing means also posed a potential health hazard, being principally made from lead or lead-bearing alloy. The workmen handling such toxic material run the risk of suffering from lead poisoning.<br>
4<br>
Although the invention of the main Patent Application attempted to solve the problem and evolved an easy device therefore, further research was carried to achieve the following :<br>
i)         reduction  in  the  material  of construction  by  reducing size  and dimensions.<br>
ii)        to use unlimited length of sealing wire to facilitate sealing irrespective of size and length.<br>
iii)       making the device simpler and easily traceable. iv)      making the device cost-effective.<br>
Accordingly, the principal object of the present invention is to provide a novel anchor security seal which is capable of overcoming the drawbacks and difficulties inherent in the conventional seals.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide and efficient sealing means<br>
which can be used and operated by application of mere finger pressure and once<br>
locked cannot be opened without being destroyed.	<br>
Tara Chand Bank   A further object of this invention is to provide a improved means of sealing which may be fabricated from inert, durable, high-strength plastic material and stainless steel, polymer-coated galvanized iron or polymer thread as the sealing means, both the plastic and metallic materials being cost-effective and environmentally safe.<br>
A still further object of this invention is to provide a novel sealing means<br>
Tara Chand Bank wherein the length and cross-section of the sealing wire may be varied at will, depending on the nature and mutual distance of the objects to be brought under sealing.<br>
5<br>
The present invention aims at fulfilling the foregoing objects and provides a novel anchor security seal, which is an improvement in or modification of the means for sealing disclosed in the main Patent Application No. 432/CAL/2001 dated 7th August, 2001, said seal comprising :<br>
a)	a hollow, polygonal body or capsule having two broad and two narrow sides,<br>
the upper portion being open and the lower portion being closed and carrying an<br>
extended part affixed to the bottom thereof acting as a holding means or handle, the<br>
said capsule having a plurality of tips or stop inside the body attached to the narrow<br>
sides thereof and pointing downwards;<br>
b)	an anchor-like body having a base with two vertical stands or columns<br>
carrying a plurality of collapsible bards or legs slanting towards base and separated by<br>
a channel running throughout the length thereof and equipped with a diaphragm like<br>
partition or strip connecting the said stands or columns which in turn carry at least<br>
two holes for allowing sealing means to be inserted there through, said holes being<br>
disposed at predetermined locations of the partition over and along which run the<br>
channels,<br>
c)	a flexible link or strip, one end of which is attached to the upper part of one of<br>
the narrow sides of the capsule, and the other end being attached to the base of the<br>
said anchor and<br>
d)	sealing means selected from the group of metallic wire or polymeric thread or<br>
wire-like body capable of being bent and inserted in the hole(s) of the said anchor-like<br>
body and creating a loop-like seal when the said anchor-like body carrying the wire or<br>
polymeric thread is inserted within the blank space of the capsules by application of<br>
pressure.<br>
The main parts of the device of this invention may be fabricated from high tensile strength engineering plastic, which may be selected from the group of high<br>
6<br>
density polyethylene (HDPE), polypropylene, PVA (polyvinyl acetale), PTTE (Polytetrafluoroethylene) or 'Teflon', "Perspex"etc , or copolymers thereof, inertness and strength being the criteria. They should have a degree of impact resistance and should be able to withstand wide variations in superincumbent conditions<br>
The sealing wire means mentioned above may be selected from plastic coated ¦ galvanized steel (G.I.) wire, double-stand stainless steel or in-built plastic sealing thread, the last-named being sealingly attached to the bottom of the base of the said anchor-like body. Double strand or ribbed stainless steel wire ensures greater strength, resistance to atmospheric condition corrosion resistance and hence greater safety, since the wire cannot be drawn out even by applying force without damaging or destroying the sealed body.<br>
Fabrication of the components parts may be done by moulding using suitable dies, and raw materials and machineries are indigenously available.<br>
The component parts of the device other than metallic sealing means may be made from opaque or transparent plastic materials to which colour of different shades          may be imparted by incorporating therein such as, for instance, blue, green, red, yellow, violet or any other suitable / desirable shade.<br>
The anchor sealing means is designed for single use and once the anchor-like body is inserted in the capsule and pressed, it cannot be opened unless destroyed by a cutting device. In case of moulded end product with a transparent appearance, any instance of tampering will be easily detected.<br>
Printing of logo and use of non-repetitive numerals make each seal uniquely non-vulnerable which cannot be tampered with or removed even by the erring employees of the service providers. However, serial numbering serves as a deterrent and it is virtually impossible to reproduce a seal with the same features and get-up.<br>
7<br>
Hence, anchor seal with a logo and serial number on the handle ensure security value of the system.<br>
The invention will now be more particularly described with reference to the drawings accompanying this specification, wherein -<br>
Tara Chand Bank    Fig. 1. shows the improved anchor seal in open condition using double strand or ribbed        metallic wire;<br>
Fig. 2. shows the front view of the seal using plastic thread integrally moulded at the bottom of the base of the anchor like body;<br>
Fig. 3. shows the device in a sealed or locked condition;<br>
Fig. 4. shows the top view of the device in an open condition, and<br>
Fig. 5. shows the seal in an inverted position using polymer coated galvanized iron wire.<br>
In Fig. 1,1 is the main body of the capsule, 2 is the holding means or handle, 3 is the lips protruding from the inner wall of the narrower sides of the capsule, 4 is the inner stops provided on top of the tapering portion of the capsule, 5 is the malleable connecting strip linking the capsule at the lip region thereof and the base 6 of the anchor-like body, 7 is the channel, 8 is the smaller leg or barb and 9 is the larger barb, 10 &amp; 11 are the hole and 12 is the sealing wire.<br>
In Fig. 2, 1 to 10 has the same significance as above and 12 is the plastic thread.<br>
In Fig. 3, 5 is the connecting strip and 13 is the opening in the capsule through which anchor-like body is to be inserted.<br>
8<br>
Fig. 4, shows 3 as the smaller barb, 6 is the base, 7 is the channel and 13 is the opening.<br>
In Fig. 5, 1 to 10 has the same signification as in Fig. 1 and 14 is the sealing wire coated with plastic.<br>
Technical specification of the anchor security seal may be as follows :<br>
Part No	Wire	To fit into	Wire type<br>
length (mm)   hole dia (mm)<br>
1.	130	1.0	In-built plastic sealing thread<br>
130 mm long.<br>
2.	150	1.0	Plastic coated galvanized<br>
steel wire 150 mm long.<br>
3.	150	1.0	Two-strand stainless steel<br>
wire 150 mm long.<br>
4.	*	10	See N.B. below<br>
* N.B. Anchor seal of type 4 may be used in combination with either two-strand stainless steel sealing wire or non-conductive, non-corrosive PVC-coated galvanized steel wire of lengths varying between 25 cm and 60 cm, or continuous length roll form to be cut in required sizes by the user as desired.<br>
For putting the anchor seal to use, the sealing wire is to be inserted through the hole or recess of the object to be secured. Next the sealing wire is routed down the channel on one side of the arrow and up the channel on the other side, followed by bending the link and inserting the anchor through the opening of the capsule. On being pushed firmly by pressing on the base of the anchor, there will be a 'click' signalling that the seal is locked upon insertion of the anchor, its legs or barbs expand and get permanently locked behind the inner stops provided on the narrow walls of<br>
9<br>
the capsule, and thereafter anchor cannot be pulled out. It is advisable to check that the seal is properly locked by pulling the handle provided below the main body of the capsule.<br>
The anchor seal of the present invention has another notable feature which may be regarded a distinct improvement over the main Patent Application. In the later, steel wire was hermetically sealed with the capsule, whereas in the present instance the sealing wire is detachable and can be selected from different cross sections depending on the end use. Moreover, the user may exercise his choice in selecting the wire material and also the wire length according to necessity. As mentioned above, the wire is secured on the channel by passing one end of it through one of the holes, preferably the one adjacent the shorter barb or leg of the anchor, and bending it down the channel and passing it through the other hole after forming a loop or seal through the slot or recess provided on the body of the object to be secured. Repeated trails have established that after the anchor with sealing wire is pushed down inside the capsule, neither the wire nor the anchor can be pulled out without disturbing or destroying the seal.<br>
The anchor seal of the present invention finds application in diverse areas, some of which are, inter alia, as denoted hereunder:<br>
(i) electric meter, (ii) gas meter, (iii) taxi meter, (iv) water meter, (v) pay phones, (vi) ATM cassettes, (vii) cabinets, (viii) tankers, (ix) vehicle doors, (x) valves, (xi) locking rings, (xii) fibre drums, (xiii) zipper bags, (xiv) documents, (xv) milk cans, (xvi) demand meters and the like.<br>
The anchor seals of the present invention enjoy the following advantages :<br>
a)	it is quick and easy to use and no additional tools are required.<br>
b)	it is environmentally and physiologically safe to handle, as it does not contain<br>
any toxic substance such as lead.<br>
10<br>
c)	it  is   durable,   and   unaffected   by  wide  variations   in   temperature  and<br>
superincumbent conditions.<br>
d)	it is made from indigenously available raw materials and simple machinery,<br>
and does not use any imported or sophisticated equipments.<br>
e)	it has wide range of applications and comes in whole range of colours.<br>
f)	it is designed for single use and will be destroyed once opened or unlocked.<br>
g)	it is highly cost-effective and versatile in its mode of application, providing an<br>
effective solution to curb theft, pilferage, tampering, adulteration and such<br>
other unlawful, damaging and / or harmful activities.<br>
While the invention has been described in detail and with reference to specific embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various changes and modification can be made therein with departing or deviating from the spirit and scope of the invention. Thus the disclosure contained herein includes within its scope obvious equivalents and substitutes as well.<br>
