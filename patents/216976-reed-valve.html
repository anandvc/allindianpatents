				<td>REED VALVE<br>
The present invention relates generally to a reed valve and, more particularly, to a reed valve suitable for supplying air to an intake system or an exhaust system of an engine.<br>
Generally, reed valves are used for supplying air to an intake system or an exhaust system of an engine. In an intake system of a two-cycle engine, for example, a reed valve is disposed in an intake pipe connected between a carburetor and a crankcase so that a negative pressure produced by vertical movements of a piston is utilized to cause air/fuel mixture to be drawn via the reed valve into the crankcase for eventual combustion within a combustion chamber of the engine. The reed valve also shuts off the flow of the mixture into the crankcase when the crankcase has a high internal pressure.<br>
In a secondary air supply apparatus of an engine often used to meet the requirements under the exhaust emission control regulat ions, a reed valve is disposed in a connector tube connecting an air cleaner andapipeof an exhaust system. A pressure difference between an upstream side and a downstream side of the reed valve, which is created in the exhaust system due to pulsation of exhaust gases, is utilized to cause air to be drawn from the air cleaner via the reed valve into the exhaust gases in the exhaust system for re-combustion of exhaust gases so that unburnt components in the exhaust gases are caused to burn. The reed valve also prevents a back-flow of exhaust gases to the air cleaner when the pressure of the exhaust system is high.<br>
Figs. 5 through 8 show a conventional reed valve for used<br><br>
in a secondary air supply system of an engine. The conventional<br>
reed valve 1 includes a plate-like support base 1 made of aetal<br>
such as aluminum and having a generally rectangular shape when<br>
viewed in plan. The support base 2 has a valve port 3 formed at<br>
a substantially central portion across the thickness thereof for<br>
the passage therethrough of a fluid. The valve port 2 also has<br>
a generally rectangular shape when viewed in plan. An outer<br>
peripheral portion of the support base 2 forms a mount portion<br>
2a adapted to be mounted, in an embraced manner/ in an attachment<br>
groove 4 (Fig. 8) formed in an object, such as a mounting portion<br>
of a connector pipe of the engine or a case mounted on the mounting<br>
portion of the connector pipe, on a surface of the mount portion<br>
2a, particularly both an upper surface and a lower surface of the<br>
outer peripheral portion of the support base 2, a first gasket<br>
portion 5 formed by a thin film of elastic material such as rubber<br>
is provided. The first gasket portion 5 has on its upper and lower<br>
surfaces a pair of annular projections 5a, 5a, respectively, so<br>
as to prevent the fluid from leaking outside the device when the<br>
fluid passes through the valve port 3. A second gasket portion<br>
6 formed by an elastic material such as rubber is provided on an<br>
inner peripheral surface of the valve port 3 and both an upper<br>
and lower surfaces of a central portion of the support base 2<br>
contiguous to the valve port 3. on an upper side of the second<br>
gasket portion 6, a generally hollow rectangular frame-like valve<br>
seat 6a extending around the valve port 3 is formed.<br>
A substantially rectangular reed piece 7 is disposed on an upper surface of the support base 2 and normally closes the valve port 3. The reed piece 7 is adapted to open and close in response<br><br>
to the pressure of the fluid passing through the valve port 3. A reed stop 8 is disposed on an upper side of the reed piece 7 so as to limit or define an open position of the reed piece 7. The reed piece 7 and reed stop 8 are clamped at one end (left end in Fig. 5) to the upper surface of the support base 2 in a cantilevered fashion by a suitable clamp means such as an attaching screw 9 threaded into the support base 2 from the lower surface thereof. The reed piece 7 operates to allow the fluid to pass through the valve port 3 in one direction from blow to the above and to block the flow of the fluid in the opposite direction. The reed piece 7 is formed from a resilient sheet of metal or plastic. The reed stop 8 is formed from a rigid metal and bent at an angle such that the distance from the upper surface of the support base 2 has a maximum value at a free end (right end in Fig. 5) of the reed stop 8.<br>
Zn the reed valve 1 of the foregoing construction, as shown in Fig. 8, the upper and lower annular projections 5a of the first gasket portion 5 formed on the mounting portion 2a of the support base 2 are fully squeezed out of shape by being compressed between two opposed rigid surfaces of the attachment groove 4, so as to form a seal surface extending around the mount portion 2a. By the seal surface/ it is possible to prevent leakage of the fluid which may otherwise occur when the fluid is passing through the valve port 3. As shown in Fig. 5, the reed stop 8 secures a static flow rate by increasing the amount of lift (i.e., the distance from the valve seat 6a) of the reed piece 7 when the reed piece 7 is in the open state.<br>
As indicated by solid line shown in Pig. 5, the reed piece<br><br>
7 is normally in contact with the valve seat 6a and thus closes the valve port 3 of the support base 2 from the upper side thereof. Furthermore, by a pressure difference created between an upper side and a lower side of the reed valve 1 due to pulsation of exhaust gases, the reed piece 7 is cause to oscillate between the sol id-lined closing position in which the reed piece 7 is in contact with the valve seat 6a at a lower surface thereof to thereby close the valve port 3, and the phantom-lined open position in which the reed piece 7 is in contact with the reed stop 8 at an upper surface thereof to thereby open the valve port 3 Thus, the reed valve 1 is constructed to allow the flow of the fluid in only one direction from blow to the above of the valve port 3 and to block the flow of the flow in the opposite direction.<br>
The conventional reed valve i has a problem, however, that vibrations generated during opening and closing operations of the reed piece 7 are transmitted to the attachment groove 4, thereby causing the engine to produce a high level abnormal sound or noise. This problem becomes significant when the engine is operating at relative low speeds where the high level noise is offensive to the ear.<br>
With the foregoing problem in view, it is an object of the present invention to provide a reed valve that is capable of suppressing transmission of vibrations produced by repetitive opening and closing operations of a reed piece thereby to surely prevent generation of an abnormal sound or noise.<br>
To achieve the foregoing object, according to the present invention, there is provided a reed valve which is equipped with a vibration suppressing means for suppressing transmission of<br><br>
vibrations, produced by repretititve opening and closing operations of a reed piece, to a fixed mounting portion of, for example, an engine part.<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a reed valve for an engine having an engine part defining a passage for a fluid and having an annular groove opening to the passage, comprising:<br>
a valve plate having a valve port formed at a central portion thereof for the passage therethrough of the fluid and further having an outer peripheral portion adapted to be disposed in the annular groove of the engine part so as to attach the reed valve to the engine part;<br>
a resilient sheet-like reed piece for opening and closing the valve port in response to the pressure of the fluid passing through the valve port;<br>
a reed stop defining an open position of the reed piece, the reed piece and the reed stop together being fixed in a cantilevered fashion to one surface of the valve plate by a clamp member in such a manner that the reed piece normally closes the valve port; and<br>
vibration suppressing means for suppressing transmission of vibration, caused due to opening and closing operations of the reed piece, to the engine part, the vibration suppressing means comprises an elastic annular projection formed on one of an outer peripheral surface of the valve plate, a pair of upper and lower surfaces of the outer peripheral portion of the valve plate and both of the outer peripheral surface and the upper and lower surfaces of the outer peripheral portion of the valve plate, characterized in that<br>
when the outer peripheral portion of the valve plate is disposed in the annular groove of the engine part, the elastic annular projection is engaged with, and partly deformed by, a surface of the annular groove to thereby support the reed valve in a floating condition within the annular groove of the engine part.<br><br>
The vibration suppressing means may comprise an elastic annular projection formed on an outer peripheral surface of a gasket fitted around an outer peripheral surface of a valve plate and a pair of upper and lower surfaces of the gasket, or only on the outer peripheral surface of the gasket, the elastic annular projection being elastically engaged with the fixed mounting portion when the outer peripheral portion of the valve plate is mounted to the fixed mounting portion. The annular projection elastically engaged with the fixed mounting portion is able to reduce a contact area between the outer peripheral portion of the valve plate and the fixed mounting portion. Further, when subjected to vibration from the reed piece, the annular projection elastically deforms to thereby absorb the vibration before the vibration is transmitted to the fixed mounting portion.<br>
A cantilevered reed stop clamed to the valve plate together with the reed piece for defining an open position of reed stop may have an arch-shaped portion projecting outward away from the valve plate and extending diametrically across over the valve port. The arch-shaped portion of the reed stop preferably has an apex corresponding in position to a central portion of a valve port formed in the valve plate. By virtue of the arch-shaped portion, a maximum amplitude of oscillation of the reed piece during opening and closing operations occurs at a position corresponding to the central portion of the valve port. This means that the distance from a source of maximum vibration to the fixed mounting portion<br><br>
is made longer than that of the conventional reed valve wherein a reed stop is bent at an angle to the valve plate so that the maximum amplitude of oscillation of the reed piece occurs at a free end thereof. By using the arched reed stop, the amount of lift of the reed piece at the free end thereof can be reduced with the result that a shock or impact produced when the reed piece free end impinges on a surface of the valve plate is reduced. A preferred embodiment of the present invention will hereinafter be described in detail, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Fig. 1 is a longitudinal cross-sectional view of a reed valve according to an embodiment of the present invention; Fig. 2 is a plan view of Pig. 1; Fig. 3 is a bottom view of Fig. 1;<br>
Fig. 4 is an enlarged cross-sectional view illustrative of<br>
the manner in which the reed valve shown in Fig. l is mounted in<br>
an attachment groove of the secondary air supply device of an engine;<br>
Fig. 5 is a longitudinal cross-sectional view of a<br>
conventional reed valve;<br>
Fig. 6 is a plan view of Fig. 5; Fig. 7 is a bottom view of Fig. 5; and Fig. 8 is an enlarged cross-sectional view illustrative of the manner in which the reed valve shown in Fig. 5 is mounted in an attachment groove of the secondary air supply device of an engine, figs. 1 through 4 show a reed valve according to an embodiment of the present invention. In the illustrated embodiment, the reed valve 11 is used in a secondary air supply device 10 (Fig. 4) of an engine.<br><br>
As shown in Figs. 1 to 3, the reed valve 11 includes a generally rectangular valve plate 12 made of metal such as aluminum. The valve plate 12 has a generally rectangular valve port 13 formed at a substantially central portion across the thickness thereof for the passage therethrough of a fluid. An outer peripheral portion of the valve plate 12 forms a mount portion 12a adapted to be mounted, in an embraced manner, in an attachment groove 14 (Fig. 4) formed in an engine part 10, such as a fixed mounting portion of a connector pipe of the engine or a case mounted on the mounting portion of the connector pipe* On a surface of the mount portion 12a, especially upper and lower surfaces of the outer peripheral portion of the valve plate 12 and an outer peripheral surface of the valve plate 12, a first gasket portion 15 is provided 90 as to embrace these surface portions. The first gasket portion 15 is formed by a thin layer of elastic material such as rubber-An upper surface, a lower surface and an outer peripheral surface of the first gasket portion 15 each have an elastic annular projection ISa.<br>
Ac shown in Fig. 4, when the mount portion 12a of the valve plate 12 is fitted in the attachment groove 14, the annular projections 15a are elastically engaged with upper and lower surfaces 14a, 14b and an inner peripheral surface 14c of the attachment groove 14 so that the valve plate 12 (i.e., the reed valve 1 as a whole) is elastically supported within the attachment groove 14.<br>
Referring back to Figs. 1-3, a second gasket portion 16 formed by a thin film of elastic material such ae .rubber is provided on an inner peripheral surface of the valve port 13 and both an upper<br><br>
and lower surfaces of a central portion of the valve plate 12 contiguous to the valve port 13. An upper side of the second gasket portion 16 forms a generally hollow rectangular frame-like valve seat 16a extending around the valve port 13.<br>
A substantially rectangular reed piece 17 is disposed on an upper surface of the valve plate 12 so as to close the valve port 13. the reed piece 17 is adapted to open and close in response to the pressure of the fluid passing through the valve port 13. A reed stop 18 is disposed on an upper side of the reed piece 17 so as to limit or define an open position of the reed piece 17. The reed piece 17 and reed stop 18 are clamped at one end (left end in Fig. 1) to the upper surface of the valve plate 12 in a cantilevered fashion by a suitable clamp means such as an attaching screw 19 threaded into the valve plate 2 from the lower surface thereof. The attaching screw 19 may be replaced by a rivet known per se.<br>
The reed piece 17 operates to allow the fluid to pass through the valve port 13 in one direction from blow to the above and to block the flow of the fluid in the opposite direction. The reed piece 17 is formed from a resilient sheet of metal or plastic.<br>
The reed stop 18 is formed from a rigid metal and has an arch-shaped intermediate portion 18a projecting outward away from the upper surface of the valve plate 12 and extending between a left edge of the valve port 13 located adjacent to the fixed end of the reed stop 18 and a right edge of the valve port 13 located adjacent to a free end of the reed stop 18. The arch-shaped intermediate portion 18a of the reed stop 18 has an apex at a central portion thereof, which is corresponding in position to a<br><br>
longitudinal central portion of the valve port 18. The amount of lift (i.e., the distance from the valve seat 16a) of the reed pieoe 17 is thus determined by the arch-shaped intermediate portion 18aof the reed stop 18 such that the maximum amplitude of oscillation of the reed piece 17 during opening and closing operations occurs at the longitudinal central portion of the rectangular valve pott 13. By the arch-shaped intermediate portion 18a of the reed stop 18, the amount of lift of the reed piece 17 is made small at the free end portion thereof. The reed stop 18 has a rectangular vent hole I8b (Fig. 2) formed in the arch-shaped intermediate portion 18a in concentric relation to the rectangular valve port 13 for allowing smooth passage of the fluid. The vent hole 18b is smaller in size (or area) than the valve port 13.<br>
The annular projections iSa formed on the upper surface, lower surface and outer peripheral surface of the first gasket portion 15 form a first vibration suppressing means. The first vibration suppressing means ISa is elastically engaged with surfaces of the attachment groove 14 when the mount portion 12a is fitted in the attachment groove 14 to mount the reed valve ll to the engine part,<br>
[0028) The arch-shaped intermediate portion I8a of the reed stop 18, which projects outward away from the valve plate 12 so as to form an apex vertically aligned with a longitudinal central portion of the valve port 13, forms a second vibration suppressing means.<br>
By thus providing the first and second vibration suppressing means 15a, 18a, it is possible to suppress transmission of vibrations, caused due to repetitive opening and closing operations of the reed piece 17, to the attachment groove 14 of the fixed<br><br>
engine part 10.<br>
The reed valve 11 nay be attached either directly to the engine or indirectly via a case (not shown) to the engine.<br>
Xhe reed valve 11 of the foregoing construction operates as follows. Opening and closing operations of the reed valve 11 are substantially the same as that of the conventional reed valve 1 discussed previously with reference to Pigs. 5-8, and description given below will be limited to significant differences from the conventional reed valve 1 only in conjunction with the vibration suppressing effect.<br>
When the reed valve 11 is mounted in the attachment groove<br>
14, as shown in Fig. 4, the annular projections 15a (forming the<br>
first vibration suppression means) are elastically engaged with<br>
the surfaces lla-14c of the attachment groove 14 with a relatively<br>
snail contact area formed between each projection 15a and the<br>
corresponding groove surface 14a-14c. Thus, by the elasticity<br>
of the annular projections 12a being partly deformed elastically,<br>
the valve plate 12 and thus the reed valve 11 as a whole is elastically<br>
supported within the attachment groove 14. The reed valve 11 is<br>
thus arranged in a floating condition. Under such condition, by<br>
a pressure difference created between an upper side and « lower<br>
side of the reed valve 11 due to pulsation of exhaust gases, the<br>
reed piece 17 is caused to oscillate in the directions indicated<br>
by the arrowhead shown in Fig. 1 between a solid-lined closing<br>
position in which the reed pieces 17 is in contact with the valve<br>
seat I6a at a lower surface thereof to thereby close the valve<br>
port 13, and a phantom-lined open position in which the reed piece<br>
17 is in contact with the reed stop 18 at an upper surface thereof<br><br>
to thereby release itself from the valve seat I6a and thus opening the valve port 13. During that time, the annular project ions (first vibration suppressing means) 15a elastically supporting the valve plate 12 relative to the attachment groove 14 elastically deform to thereby absorb vibration transmitted from the reed piece 17 being oscillated. By thus absorbing the vibration, the guide groove 14 of the engine part 10 is kept substantially free from the effect of vibration of the reed piece 17. This ensures that the engine does not produce an abnormal sound or noise resulting from operation of the reed valve 11.<br>
The same vibration suppressing effect and the resulting noise prevention affect can be also achieved when the first vibration suppressing means is formed by either the annular projection ISa on the outer peripheral surface of the first gasket portion 15, or the annular projections 15ar 15a on the upper and lower surfaces of the first gasket portion 15-<br>
when the annular projections 15a are in a free state, they are disposed in an initial position indicated by the phantom lines shown in Pig. 4. When the reed valve 11 is mounted in the attachment groove 14 of the engine part 10, the annular projections 15a are elastically deformed until they assume an elastically distorted operating position indicated by the solid lines shown in Fig. 4. in the operating posit ion, the annular pro jections ISa elastically engaged with the corresponding surfaces 14a-14c of the attachment groove 14 form hermetic seals therebetween. By the seals thus formed, the fluid passing through the valve port 13 during opening and closing operations of the reed piece 17 is prevented from leaking outside the engine part 10.<br><br>
Furthermore, by virtue of the arch-shaped portion 18a forming the second vibration suppressing means, the reed stop 18 controls oscillation of the reed piece 17 during opening and closing operations such that the maximum amplitude of oscillation occurs at a position corresponding to a central portion of the valve port 13. With this arrangement, the distance from a source of maximum vibration to the attachment groove 14 is made longer than that of the conventional reed valve 1 shown in Fig. 5. Thus, the second vibration suppressing means formed by the arch-shaped portion I8a of the reed stop 18 operates to suppress transmission of vibration from the reed piece 1? to the attachment groove 14 of the engine part 10. This may add to the sound-reducing effect of the reed valve 11.<br>
It has experimentally proved that the reed valve 11 of the present invention used in place of the conventional reed valve I is able to achieve about a 30%-reduction in the level of acceleration when measured at an upper cover of an engine while the engine is running at speeds varying in the range of 2000 to 3000 r.p.m.<br>
As thus for explained, the reed valve of the present invention can readily and surely suppress transmission of vibration from the reed piece to the engine part during repetitive opening and closing operations of the reed piece. This ensures that the engine does not produce an abnormal sound or noise resulting from operation of the reed valve.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
