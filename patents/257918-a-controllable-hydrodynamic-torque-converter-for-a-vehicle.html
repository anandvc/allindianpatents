VARIABLE K-FACTOR TORQUE CONVERTER<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	This invention relates generally to a controllable hydrodynamic torque<br>
converter, and in particular to a hydrodynamic torque converter having two controllable<br>
stators configured with different outlet angles for selectively varying the torque<br>
converter K-factor.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Automatic power transmissions used in modern vehicles typically utilize<br>
a multi-function turbomachine or device commonly referred to as a hydrodynamic<br>
torque converter. A hydrodynamic torque converter is used to automatically disengage<br>
a rotating engine crankshaft from a transmission input shaft during vehicle idling<br>
conditions to enable the vehicle to stop and/or to shift gears without stalling.<br>
Additionally, the torque converter is used as a torque multiplier for multiplying engine<br>
torque in the lower vehicle speed range until the vehicle speed nearly matches the<br>
engine speed.<br>
[0003]	Within a torque converter, a number of specially constructed internal<br>
components combine to enable an efficient fluid coupling effect between the disparately<br>
rotating engine and transmission shafts. In particular, a standard or conventional torque<br>
converter consists of an engine-driven pump or impeller, which is the driving member<br>
of the torque converter giving impetus to a stream of hydraulic fluid. The pump is<br>
connected to the engine crankshaft and therefore rotates in unison with the engine,<br>
thereby accelerating a supply of hydraulic fluid and directing the accelerated fluid to the<br>
second component, the turbine. The turbine, which is driven by the accelerated fluid<br>
discharged by the pump, is typically splined to a transmission input shaft and converts<br>
the fluid energy imparted by the fluid stream into useable mechanical energy, which is<br>
transmitted to the splined transmission input shaft to propel the vehicle. Finally, a<br>
stationary member or stator is included within the torque converter for redirecting the<br><br>
2<br>
fluid stream between the pump and turbine. The stator is connected to a fixed reaction<br>
shaft through a one-way clutch that allows the stator to free-wheel when torque<br>
multiplication is no longer possible.<br>
[0004]	Torque converters are designed to slip at lower vehicle speeds in order to<br>
enable the transmission to rotate at a slower rate than the coupled engine, with the slip<br>
rate gradually diminishing as the vehicle is accelerated. Effectively, the torque<br>
converter holds the engine speed nearly constant, allowing the transmission speed to<br>
gradually reach or approach the engine speed as the vehicle accelerates. The torque<br>
converter input speed, identical with the engine speed and stated in revolutions per<br>
minute, is an important design factor that is substantially affected by the outlet angle of<br>
the stator. The outlet angle is primarily determined by the configuration or<br>
construction of a plurality of stator blades within the stator. However, the torque<br>
converter input speed depends in large part on the engine output torque, and therefore a<br>
more descriptive variable, the "K-factor", is usually used to rate or describe an<br>
individual torque converter. K-factor refers to the input speed divided by the square<br>
root of the engine torque, as measured at any torque converter operating point. The<br>
operating point of a torque converter is most conveniently defined by the ratio of the<br>
output speed to the input speed of the torque converter. This parameter or variable is<br>
known as the torque converter speed ratio.<br>
[0005]	Vehicle fuel economy and performance is enhanced when the operating<br>
or performance characteristics of a given torque converter are automatically optimized.<br>
While a variable-blade angle stator may be used, wherein individual piston-actuated<br>
stator blades are allowed to pivot on shafts running from shell to core in order to adjust<br>
the stator blade position and angle, such variable designs tend to be intricate and<br>
therefore may be less than optimal due in part to their relative cost and complexity.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006]	Accordingly, a controllable hydrodynamic torque converter is provided<br>
for use within a vehicle, the torque converter having two stators each configured with a<br><br>
3<br>
different outlet angle, with the second stator being selectively engageable with respect<br>
to the first stator for varying the torque converter K-factor depending on throttle<br>
position.<br>
[0007]	In one aspect of the invention, the second stator is selectively engageable<br>
using a clutch when the detectable throttle level is idle or high-throttle.<br>
[0008]	In another aspect of the invention, the first outlet angle of the first stator<br>
is at least 5 degrees less than the second outlet angle of the second stator, with the first<br>
outlet angle selected from the range of 10 to 65 degrees, and the second outlet angle<br>
selected from the range of 25 to 75 degrees.<br>
[0009]	In another aspect of the invention, a vehicle is provided having an engine<br>
having an engine torque and a detectable throttle level, a transmission, a torque<br>
converter operable to transmit the engine torque to the transmission and also having a<br>
stator assembly with first and second stators, a selectively controllable clutch, and a<br>
controller configured to selectively actuate the clutch depending on the detected vehicle<br>
throttle level, wherein actuation of the clutch locks the first and second stators to<br>
thereby vary the K-factor of the torque converter.<br>
[0010]	The above objects, features and advantages, and other objects, features<br>
and advantages of the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed<br>
description of the best mode for carrying out the invention when taken in connection<br>
with the accompanying drawings.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0016]	Referring to Figure 1, wherein like reference numerals refer to like<br>
components, a vehicle 10 is shown having a plurality of wheels 26 disposed or positioned<br>
on a pair of axles 22 and 24, an engine or energy conversion system 12, a hydrodynamic<br>
torque converter 14, and a power transmission 16 having a rotatable input member (not<br>
shown) and a rotatable output member 18. The energy conversion system 12 is<br>
preferably a gasoline or diesel internal combustion engine of the type known in the art,<br>
and is operable to generate a rotational force or torque suitable for rotating a crankshaft<br>
(not shown) that is selectively connectable or engageable with the input shaft of<br>
transmission 16 through the torque converter 14. However, any energy conversion<br>
capable of powering the vehicle 10 is also useable with the invention, for example fuel<br>
cells.<br>
[0017]	By means of the torque converter 14, torque from the energy conversion<br>
system is smoothly transferred to the transmission 16, and ultimately to the wheels 26 for<br>
propulsion of the vehicle 10. The torque converter 14 is preferably automatically<br>
controllable using a controller 30, preferably part of an on-board transmission control<br>
system also configured to detect a throttle position or level represented in Figure 1 as "T"<br>
and in Figure 5 as "throttle position", and adapted to selectively engage the energy<br>
conversion system 12 with the input shaft (not shown) of transmission 16 while also<br>
acting as a torque multiplier as needed, particularly at low or reduced vehicle speeds, as<br>
explained in more detail hereinbelow.<br>
[0018]	Depending on whether a front-wheel, rear-wheel, or all-wheel drive<br>
configuration is used, one or both axles 22 and 24 may be further adapted for use as drive<br>
axles suitable for powering the vehicle 10. To this end, a front and/or rear differential<br>
20F, 20R, respectively, may be employed for transmitting output torque from the<br>
transmission 16 to either or both of the axles 22, 24, and/or for distributing output torque<br><br>
5<br>
along a common axle 22 or 24, for example to prevent slippage on slippery pavement or<br>
while the vehicle 10 is cornering.<br>
[0019]	Turning to Figure 2, the hydrodynamic torque converter 14 of the<br>
invention is shown in cutaway side view having an outer shell or cover 32 that is bolted,<br>
welded, or otherwise rigidly attached or connected to an engine flexplate (not shown),<br>
preferably using a lag 23, and having a centerline of rotation 11. The engine flexplate is<br>
ultimately attached to the engine crankshaft (not shown). The torque converter 14<br>
includes an impeller or pump 50, a turbine 52 having a hub 33, and a stator assembly 44<br>
selectively connectable to a fixed stator shaft (not shown) by means of a one-way clutch<br>
19. The one-way clutch 19 is operable to hold torque in one direction, and may take the<br>
form of, for example, a mechanical diode, latch, or other suitable one-way clutching<br>
device. The pump 50 includes a pump housing 34 that is rigidly connected to the torque<br>
converter cover 32, preferably using a lag 21 or other suitable faster device or fastening<br>
method such as welding so that the pump 50 rotates in conjunction with and at the rate of<br>
the energy conversion system 12 (see Figure 1). Torque converter 14 preferably includes<br>
a mechanical lock-up clutch 27 (see Figure 2) for selectively directing power from the<br>
energy conversion system 12 to the transmission 16 when torque converter function is not<br>
desired, for example during periods of relatively high vehicle speeds. Cover 32 and<br>
housing 34 may be constructed using any suitable combination of ferrous and/or non-<br>
ferrous materials, depending on the design requirements.<br>
[0020]	As the pump 50 rotates in conjunction with the energy conversion system<br>
12, a fluid 15 such as hydraulic oil or other suitable fluid is accelerated by and through<br>
the pump 50 and discharged or expelled into the turbine 52. The turbine 52 is<br>
operatively connected to a transmission input shaft (not shown) by means of a splined<br>
turbine hub 33, and configured to convert the fluid energy imparted by fluid 15<br>
discharged from pump 50 into mechanical energy suitable for driving or rotating the<br>
transmission input shaft. This conversion to mechanical energy is enhanced when the<br>
blades (not shown) of turbine 52 are configured to discharge fluid 15 with rotational<br>
velocity opposite that of the pump 50. A stator assembly 44 is positioned between the<br>
inlet 71 of the pump 50 and the outlet 72 of the turbine 52 to receive fluid 15 discharged<br><br>
6<br>
from the turbine 52 and conduct or redirect it back to the inlet of pump 50. Stator<br>
assembly 44 is further configured to variably and controllably redirect the fluid 15<br>
flowing between the pump 50 and the turbine 52 imparting more or less rotational<br>
velocity in the direction of that of the pump 50, thereby improving the efficiency of the<br>
torque converter 14 and increasing torque multiplication.<br>
[0021]	Stator assembly 44 includes a first stator 45, a second stator 46, and a<br>
clutching mechanism or clutch 40, with first and second stators 45 and 46 being<br>
selectively and automatically engageable or connectable with respect to each other as<br>
needed using the clutch 40. First stator 45 is operatively connected to a fixed stator<br>
shaft (not shown) by means of a one-way clutch 19, which allows the stator assembly<br>
44	to automatically freewheel when redirection of fluid 15 is not necessary. Clutch 40<br>
is preferably a controllable, hydraulically-actuated piston or other suitable clutching<br>
device adapted to selectively engage, lock, or join together the first and second stators<br>
45	and 46 in order to controllably and variably redirect fluid 15 between pump 50 and<br>
turbine 52 to thereby affect the performance of torque converter 14, as explained in<br>
more detail hereinbelow.<br>
[0022]	In accordance with the invention, fluid 15 flowing through the stator<br>
assembly 44 passes through the first stator 45, and subsequently through the second<br>
stator 46. The fluid 15 entering stator assembly 44 is forced to change direction and,<br>
upon exiting the first stator 45, enters the second stator 46 flowing in the same<br>
rotational direction as the pump 50. Depending on the position or actuation status of<br>
clutch 40, the fluid 15 may be forced to a higher speed of rotation in the same direction<br>
as pump 50, thereby conserving more or less power.<br>
[0023]	Clutch 40 is preferably powered or actuated by the pressurized fluid at 17<br>
that is isolated or separate from fluid 15 and fed to the clutch 40 through an internal fluid<br>
passage or channel 48 from a controllable pressure source, such as a positive<br>
displacement pump (not shown) or other suitably controllable pressure source. Channel<br>
48 is preferably cylindrical in shape and substantially circular in cross-sectional area, and<br><br>
7<br>
adapted to efficiently conduct or direct oil or other hydraulic fluid, and may take the form<br>
of, for example, various die or sand cast channels or passages.<br>
[0024]	Turning now to Figure 3, the plurality of first and second stator blades 60<br>
and 62, respectively, are shown in developed sections. Stator blades 60 are disposed<br>
within the first stator 45, and stator blades 62 are disposed within the second stator 46.<br>
Each of the blades 60, 62 are configured to substantially reverse the direction of rotation<br>
of the fluid 15 upon entering the stator assembly 44. Fluid 15 flowing through the stator<br>
assembly 44 (see Figure 2) passes through the first stator 45 and is acted on by the<br>
blades 60. Fluid 15 upon leaving or exiting stator 45 passes through stator 46. When<br>
clutch 40 is actuated or engaged, the fluid 15 is acted upon by blades 62. When clutch<br>
40 is not actuated or engaged, blades 62 are released and are allowed to freewheel with<br>
negligible effect on the fluid 15. When the fluid 15 is acted upon by the blades 60, it is<br>
redirected in accordance with the geometry and construction of the blades 62.<br>
[0025]	In accordance with the invention, blades 60 and 62 have different<br>
respective geometrical sections and physical features that are selected to optimize the<br>
performance of the torque converter 14 under different vehicle operating conditions, for<br>
example, during idling, light-to-moderate or low/part throttle, and heavy throttle. Stator<br>
blades 60 of first stator 45 are constructed or configured to provide a relatively low fluid<br>
outlet angle, denoted as "L" for "low" herein and represented in Figure 3 as 0L.<br>
Likewise, stator blades 62 of second stator 46 are constructed or configured to provide a<br>
relatively high fluid outlet angle, denoted as "H" for "high" herein and represented in<br>
Figure 3 as ΘH- Stator blades 62 of second stator 46 are preferably constructed or<br>
configured so as to admit fluid 15 discharged or expelled from first stator 45 at<br>
substantially the same angle, i.e. 9L, thereby minimizing losses and improving efficiency.<br>
In other words, the inlet angle of the second stator should match the outlet angle of the<br>
first stator. Once admitted into the second stator 46, the fluid 15 is redirected at the<br>
relatively high outlet angle ΘH, with the terms "relatively low/high" referring to the<br>
angular relationship between the variables ΘL and ΘH-<br>
[0026]	Turning now to Figure 4, which shows a representative set of curves 70<br>
that collectively describe torque converter efficiency, torque ratio, i.e. the output torque<br><br>
8<br>
divided by the input torque, and K-factor, as explained previously hereinabove, in terms<br>
of its speed ratio, i.e. the output speed divided by the input speed. In general terms, if the<br>
outlet angle of a stator is relatively high, such as with 9H of blades 62 (see Figure 3),<br>
the torque converter 14 will have a proportionately higher K-factor. Such a torque<br>
converter is also referred to as a "loose" torque converter or, said differently, a loose<br>
converter has a relatively high K-factor. Loose torque converters also generally<br>
multiply torque to a relatively high speed ratio. Loose torque converters generally<br>
reduce fuel consumption at idle by reducing the amount of engine power absorbed by<br>
the torque converter as a consequence of the relatively high K-factor, while enhancing<br>
vehicle performance by multiplying torque to a higher vehicle speed.<br>
[0027]	Conversely, if the outlet angle of a stator is relatively low, such as with<br>
9L of blades 60, the K-factor will also be relatively low. Such a torque converter is also<br>
referred to as a "tight" converter, i.e. one having a low K-factor. Tight torque<br>
converters improve fuel economy during part throttle acceleration by reducing engine<br>
speed as a consequence of the relatively low K-factor. Accordingly, loose and tight<br>
torque converters are each optimal under different underlying vehicle operating<br>
conditions.<br>
[0028]	As shown in Figure 4, the set of performance curves denoted with the<br>
subscript "L" describe the general performance of a "loose" torque converter and the set<br>
of performance curves denoted with the subscript "T" describe the general performance<br>
of a "tight" torque converter, as described previously hereinabove. Referring to Figures<br>
1, 4, and 5, during mode 1, i.e. when the throttle position or level T (see Figure 1) as<br>
detected by the controller 30 indicates a vehicle "idle" condition, clutch 40 is<br>
automatically actuated or engaged (i.e. "X" in Figure 4), thereby locking the second<br>
stator 46 with respect to the first stator 45. The variable K-factor of stator assembly 44 is<br>
increased to the value of the "loose" or L-curve (see Figure 4), reducing the idle fuel<br>
consumption of the energy conversion system 12.<br>
[0029]	During mode 2, i.e. when the throttle position or level T indicates light or<br>
low/part throttle driving conditions, the clutch 40 is released or disengaged, thereby<br>
permitting the second stator 46 to rotate freely or freewheel without effect. In other<br><br>
9<br>
words, the torque converter 14 will operate as if second stator 46 were not present, thus<br>
performing as a tight converter along the "T" curve collectively described by Torque<br>
Ratior, Efficiency or ET, and K-Factorr in Figure 4. The energy conversion system 12<br>
(see Figure 1) will operate at a reduced speed, thereby decreasing the engine brake<br>
specific fuel consumption (BFSC) and increasing fuel economy.<br>
[0030]	Finally, during mode 3, i.e. when the throttle position or level T indicates<br>
a "high" throttle driving condition, clutch 40 is once again engaged to lock the second<br>
stator 46 with the first stator 45, resulting in the torque converter 14 once again operating<br>
on the "loose" or L-curve. Vehicle 10 will then accelerate at a faster rate due to the<br>
higher torque multiplication afforded by the torque ratio L-curve at high speed ratios and<br>
the additional engine power permitted by the higher engine speed as a consequence of the<br>
higher K-factor L-curve. In this manner, torque converter 14 performance is optimized<br>
as the torque converter 14 is permitted to operate at its most efficient point across all<br>
three modes or throttle positions, levels, or conditions.<br>
[0031]	While the best modes for carrying out the invention have been described<br>
in detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will recognize various<br>
alternative designs and embodiments for practicing the invention within the scope of the<br>
appended claims.<br><br>

approximately 25 degree to 75 degrees.<br>
11.	A vehicle comprising:<br>
an engine having a measurable engine torque and a detectable<br>
throttle level;<br>
a transmission;<br>
a torque converter operable to transmit said engine torque to said<br>
transmission to propel said vehicle and having a stator assembly with first and<br>
second stators;<br>
a selectively actuatable clutch; and<br>
a controller configured to selectively actuate said clutch<br>
depending on said detectable throttle level of said vehicle;<br>
wherein actuation of said clutch locks said first stator with said<br>
second stator to thereby vary the K-factor of said torque converter.<br>
12.	The vehicle of claim 11, wherein said detectable throttle level is<br>
selected from the group of idle, low to part throttle, and high throttle, and<br>
wherein said actuation of said clutch occurs during said idle and said high<br>
throttle.<br>
13.	The vehicle of claim 11, wherein said first stator has a first outlet<br>
angle and said second stator has a second outlet angle, and wherein said first<br>
outlet angle is at least approximately 5 degrees less than said second outlet<br>
angle.<br><br>
13<br>
14.	The vehicle of claim 13, wherein said first outlet angle is<br>
approximately 10 to 65 degrees, and wherein said second outlet angle is<br>
approximately 25 to 75 degrees.<br>
15.	The vehicle of claim 12, wherein said clutch is hydraulically-<br>
actuated, and wherein said torque converter includes at least one internal fluid<br>
channel adapted to deliver a supply of pressurized fluid to said clutch for<br>
actuating said clutch.<br><br>
A controllable hydrodynamic torque converter is provided for use within a vehicle<br>
having a detectable throttle level, the torque converter comprising a first stator having a<br>
first outlet angle and a second stator having a higher second outlet angle. The second<br>
stator is selectively engageable with the first stator using a hydraulic clutch to thereby<br>
vary the torque converter K-factor during idle and high-throttle conditions, and is<br>
permitted to freewheel during low or part throttle conditions. The first outlet angle is<br>
at least five degrees lower than the second outlet angle. A vehicle is also provided<br>
including an engine having an engine torque and a detectable throttle level, a<br>
transmission, a torque converter operable to transmit the engine torque to the<br>
transmission and having a stator assembly with two stators, a selectively controllable<br>
clutch, and a controller configured to selectively actuate the clutch to vary the K-factor depending on the throttle level.<br></td>
