				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a class of strong, constitutive plant promoters and their uses. The promoters may be used for expression of homologous or heterologous proteins in plants or plant cells, or for the expression of active nucleic acid molecules, such as sense and/or anti-sense RNA. Provided are nucleic acid sequences having promoter activity, as well as chimeric genes, vectors and recombinant (transgenic) cells and organism comprising these. Also provided are methods for making transgenic cells and organisms, especially plants and plant cells, comprising the promoter. Further, cytosolic cysteine synthase proteins and nucleic acid sequences encoding these, arc provided.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A large number of plant promoters are known in the art, which are useful tools for expressing proteins or peptides in transgenic plants or plant cells or for silencing genes or gene families. These include constitutive promoters, inducible promoters, developmentally regulated promoters, tissue preferred or tissue specific promoters. Examples of commonly used constitutive promoters are the following: the 35S promoters or enhanced 35S promoters (the "35S promoters") of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) of isolates CM 1841 (Gardner et al, 1981, Nucleic Acids Research 9, 2871-2887), CabbB-S (Franck et al, 1980, Cell 21, 285-294) and CabbB-JI (Hull and Howell, 1987, Virology 86, 482-493); the 35S promoter described by Odell et al. (1985, Nature 313, 810-812) or in US5164316, promoters from the ubiquitin family (e.g. the maize ubiquitin promoter of Christensen et al, 1992, Plant Mol. Biol. 18, 675-689, EP 0 342 926, see also Cornejo et al. 1993, Plant Mol. Biol. 23, 567-581), the gos2 promoter (de Pater et al, 1992 Plant J. 2, 837-844), the emu promoter (Last et al, 1990, Theor. Appl. Genet. 81,581-588), Arabidopsis actin promoters such as the promoters described by An et al. (1996, Plant J. 10, 107-121), rice actin promoters such as the promoters described by Zhang et a/.(1991, The Plant Cell 3, 1155-1165) and the promoter described in US 5,641,876 or the rice actin 2 promoter as described in WO 00/70067; promoters of the Cassava vein mosaic virus (WO 97/48819, Verdaguer et al. 1998,   Plant   Mol.   Biol.   37,   1055-1067),  the  pPLEX  series   of promoters   from<br>
Subterranean Clover Stunt Virus (WO 96/06932, particularly the S7 promoter), an alcohol dehydrogenase promoter, e.g., pAdhlS (GenBank accession numbers X04049, X00581), the Figworl Mosaic Virus promoter described in US 6 051 753 and in EP 426 641, histone gene promoters, such as the Ph4a748 promoter from Arabidopsis (Plant Mol. Biol. 8: 179-191), the CoYMV (Commelina Yellow Mottle Virus) promoter (Mcdberry et al. 1992, The Plant Cell 4:185-192), or others.<br>
However, one common drawback of known constitutive promoters is that they frequently still show variation in their activity, such as organ- or developmenlally regulated expression or stress induced alterations in expression. The present inventors found that the activity of the CaMV 35S promoter in transgenic plants was sensitive to abiotic stress, especially heat stress caused when the transgenic plants were grown in the field in Spain. There is, therefore, a need to provide new constitutive promoters, which arc insensitive to one or more biotic and/or abiotic stresses. In addition, it is desirable from a regulatory point of view to use promoters derived from plants in the generation of transgenic plants.<br>
In addition, viral promoters derived from viruses capable of infecting plants are less preferred for the transformation of host plant species, as infection of the plants with the virus may cause silencing of the transgenic promoter (Seemanpillai et al., 2003, Mol Plant Microbe Interact. 16(5): 429-38; Al-Kaff et al., 2000, Nat Biotechnol. 18: 995-9). Different constitutive promoters are also needed for gene stacking approaches, as the use of several identical promoters may result in silencing (Yang et al., 2005, Plant Mol Biol. 58:351-66).<br>

GENERAL DEFINITIONS<br>
The term "nucleic acid sequence" (or nucleic acid molecule) refers to a DNA or RNA molecule in single or double stranded form, particularly a DNA having promoter activity according to the invention or a DNA encoding a protein or protein fragment. An "isolated nucleic acid sequence" refers to a nucleic acid sequence which is no longer in the natural environment from which it was isolated, e.g. the nucleic acid sequence in a bacterial host cell or in the plant nuclear or plastid genome. The terms "protein" or "polypeptide" are used interchangeably and refer to molecules consisting of a chain of amino acids, without reference to a specific mode of action, size, 3-dimensional structure or origin. A "fragment" or "portion" of a protein may thus still be referred to as a "protein". An "isolated protein" is used to refer to a protein which is no longer in its natural environment, for example in vitro or in a recombinant bacterial or plant host cell.<br>
The term "gene" means a DNA sequence comprising a region (transcribed region), which is transcribed into an RNA molecule (e.g. an mRNA) in a cell, operably linked to suitable transcription regulatory regions (e.g. a promoter). A gene may thus comprise several operably linked sequences, such as a promoter, a 5' non-translated leader sequence (also referred to as 5'UTR, which corresponds to the transcribed mRNA sequence upstream of the translation start codon) comprising e.g. sequences involved in translation initiation, a (protein) coding region (cDNA or genomic DNA) and a 3'non-translated sequence (also referred to as 3' untranslated region, or 3'UTR) comprising<br>
e.g. transcription termination sites and polyadcnylation site (such as e.g. AAUAAA or variants thereof).<br>
A "chimeric gene" (or recombinant gene) refers to any gene, which is not normally found in nature in a species, in particular a gene in which one or more parts of the nucleic acid sequence are present that are not associated with each other in nature. For example the promoter is not associated in nature with part or all of the transcribed region or with another regulatory region. The term "chimeric gene" is understood to include expression constructs in which a promoter or transcription regulatory sequence is operably linked to one or more sense sequences (e.g. coding sequences) or to an antisense (reverse complement of the sense strand) or inverted repeat sequence (sense and antisense, whereby the RNA transcript forms double stranded RNA upon transcription).<br>
A "3' UTR" or "3' non-translated sequence" (also often referred to as 3' untranslated region, or 3'cnd) refers to the nucleic acid sequence found downstream of the coding sequence of a gene, which comprises, for example, a transcription termination site and (in most, but not all cukaryotic mRNAs) a polyadenylation signal (such as e.g. AAUAAA or variants thereof). After termination of transcription, the mRNA transcript may be cleaved downstream of the polyadenylation signal and a poly(A) tail may be added, which is involved in the transport of the mRNA to the cytoplasm (where translation takes place).<br>
"Expression of a gene" refers to the process wherein a DNA region, which is operably linked to appropriate regulatory regions, particularly a promoter, is transcribed into an RNA, which is biologically active, i.e. which is capable of being translated into a biologically active protein or peptide (or active peptide fragment) or which is active itself (e.g. in posttranscriptional gene silencing or RNAi). An active protein in certain embodiments refers to a protein having a dominant-negative function due to a repressor domain being present. The coding sequence is preferably in sense-orientation and encodes a desired, biologically active protein or peptide, or an active peptide fragment. In gene silencing approaches, the DNA sequence is preferably present in the form of an antisense DNA or an inverted repeat DNA, comprising a short sequence of the target gene in antisense or in sense and antisense orientation. "Ectopic expression" refers to expression in a tissue in which the gene is normally not expressed.<br>
A "transcription regulatory sequence" is herein defined as a nucleic acid sequence that is capable of regulating the rate of transcription of a nucleic acid sequence operably linked to the transcription regulatory sequence. A transcription regulatory sequence as herein defined will thus comprise all of the sequence elements necessary for initiation of transcription (promoter elements), for maintaining and for regulating transcription, including e.g. attenuators or enhancers, but also silencers. Although mostly the upstream (5') transcription regulatory sequences of a coding sequence are referred to, regulatory sequences found downstream (3') of a coding sequence arc also encompassed by this definition.<br>
As used herein, the term "promoter" refers to a nucleic acid fragment that functions to control the transcription of one or more genes, located upstream (5') with respect to the direction of transcription of the transcription initiation site of the gene (the transcription start is referred to as position +1 of the sequence and any upstream nucleotides relative thereto arc referred to using negative numbers), and is structurally identified by the presence of a binding site for DNA-dcpcndcnt RNA polymerase, transcription initiation sites and any other DNA domains (cis acting sequences), including, but not limited to transcription factor binding sites, repressor and activator protein binding sites, and any other sequences of nucleotides known to one of skill in the art to act directly or indirectly to regulate the amount of transcription from the promoter. Examples of eukaryotic cis acting sequences upstream of the transcription start (+1) include the TATA box (commonly at approximately position -20 to -30 of the transcription start), the CAAT box (commonly at approximately position -75 relative to the transcription start), 5'enhancer or silencer elements, etc. A "constitutive" promoter is a promoter that is active in most tissues (or organs) under most physiological and developmental conditions. More preferably, a constitutive promoter is active under essentially all physiological and developmental conditions in all major organs, such as at least the leaves, stems, roots, seeds, fruits and flowers. Most preferably, the promoter is active in all organs under most (preferably all) physiological and developmental conditions. An "inducible" promoter is a promoter that is physiologically (e.g. by external application of certain compounds) or developmentally regulated. A "tissue specific" promoter is only active in specific types of tissues or cells. The promoter activity can therefore be described by referring to the circumstances under which the promoter confers transcription of the nucleic acid sequence operably linked downstream (3') of<br>
the promoter. A "promoter which has constitutive activity" or which is "constitutive" in a plant or plant cell refers, therefore, to a nucleic acid sequence which confers transcription in the plant or plant cells in most tissues (or organs) under most physiological and developmental conditions. A promoter which is "insensitive to one or more biotic and/or abiotic stresses" or whose activity "is not reduced when exposed to one or more biotic and/or abiotic stress conditions" refers to a nucleic acid sequence having promoter activity under normal physiological and developmental conditions, and whereby the activity is not, or at least not significantly, reduced quantitatively when biotic and/or abiotic stress is exerted on the organism (e.g. plant) or cells or tissues or organs comprising the promoter.<br>
"Stress" refers to conditions or pressures of physical, chemical or biological origin acting on a plant or plant cells which may result in yield loss and/or quality loss of a plant, but which is not lethal to the plant.<br>
"Non-stress conditions" refer herein to conditions under which physiology and development arc normal or optimal.<br>
"Biotic stress" refers to stress caused by biotic (live) agents, such as fungi, viruses. mycoplasma like organisms, insects, bacteria, nematodes etc. (i.e. especially plant pests and pathogens).<br>
"Abiotic stress" refers to stress caused by abiotic (non-living) agents, such as temperature stress (cold/freezing, heat), salinity (salt), wind, metals, day-length (photoperiod), water-stress (such as too little or too much water availability, i.e. drought, dehydration, water-logging, etc.), wounding, radiation, etc. As used herein, the term "operably linked" refers to a linkage of polynucleotide elements in a functional relationship. A nucleic acid is "operably linked" when it is placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. For instance, a promoter, or a transcription regulatory sequence, is operably linked to a coding sequence if it affects the transcription of the coding sequence. Operably linked means that the DNA sequences being linked are typically contiguous and, where necessary to join two protein encoding regions, contiguous and in reading frame so as to produce a "chimeric protein". A "chimeric protein" or "hybrid protein" is a protein composed of various protein "domains" (or motifs) which is not found as such in nature but which are joined to form a functional protein, which displays the functionality of the joined domains (for example a DNA binding domain or a repression of function domain<br>
leading to a dominant negative function). A chimeric protein may also be a fusion protein of two or more proteins occurring in nature. The term "domain" as used herein means any part(s) or domain(s) of the protein with a specific structure or function that can be transferred to another protein for providing a new hybrid protein with at least the functional characteristic of the domain.<br>
The term "target peptide" refers to amino acid sequences which target a protein to intracellular organelles such as plastids, preferably chloroplasts, mitochondria, or to the extracellular space (secretion signal peptide). A nucleic acid sequence encoding a target peptide may be fused (in frame) to the nucleic acid sequence encoding the amino terminal end (N-terminal end) of the protein.<br>
A "nucleic acid construct" or "vector" is herein understood to mean a man-made nucleic acid molecule resulting from the use of recombinant DNA technology and which is used to deliver exogenous DNA into a host cell. The vector backbone may for example be a binary or superbinary vector (see e.g. US 5,591,616, US2002138879 and WO 95/06722), a co-integrate vector or a T-DNA vector, as known in the art and as described elsewhere herein, into which a chimeric gene is integrated or, if a suitable transcription regulatory sequence / promoter is already present, only a desired nucleic acid sequence (e.g. a coding sequence, an antisense or an inverted repeat sequence) is integrated downstream of the transcription regulatory sequence / promoter. Vectors usually comprise further genetic elements to facilitate their use in molecular cloning, such as e.g. selectable markers, multiple cloning sites and the like (see below). A "host cell" or a "recombinant host cell" or "transformed cell" are terms referring to a new individual cell (or organism), arising as a result of the introduction into said cell of at least one nucleic acid molecule, especially comprising a chimeric gene encoding a desired protein or a nucleic acid sequence which upon transcription yields an antisense RNA or an inverted repeat RNA (or hairpin RNA) for silencing of a target gene/gene family. The host cell is preferably a plant cell, but may also be a bacterial cell, a fungal cell (including a yeast cell), etc. The host cell may contain the nucleic acid construct as an extra-chromosomally (episomal) replicating molecule, or more preferably, comprises the chimeric gene integrated in the nuclear or plastid genome of the host cell. The term "selectable marker" is a term familiar to one of ordinary skill in the art and is used herein to describe any genetic entity which, when expressed, can be used to select for a cell or cells containing the selectable marker. Selectable marker gene products<br>
confer, for example, antibiotic resistance, or more preferably, herbicide resistance or another selectable trait such as a phenotypic trait (e.g. a change in pigmentation) or a nutritional requirement. The term "reporter" is mainly used to refer to visible markers, such as green fluorescent protein (GFP), eGFP, luciferase, GUS and the like. The term "ortholog" of a gene or protein refers herein to the homologous gene or protein found in another species, which has the same function as the gene or protein, but (usually) diverged in sequence from the time point on when the species harbouring the genes diverged (i.e. the genes evolved from a common ancestor by speciation). Orlhologs of a gene from one plant species may thus be identified in other plant species based on both sequence comparisons (e.g. based on percentages sequence identity over the entire sequence or over specific domains) and functional analysis. The terms "homologous" and "heterologous" refer to the relationship between a nucleic acid or amino acid sequence and its host cell or organism, especially in the context of transgenic organisms. A homologous sequence is thus naturally found in the host species (e.g. a tomato plant transformed with a tomato gene), while a heterologous sequence is not naturally found in the host cell (e.g. a tomato plant transformed with a sequence from potato plants). Depending on the context, the term "homolog" or "homologous" may alternatively refer to sequences which are descendent from a common ancestral sequence (e.g. they may be orthologs).<br>
"Stringent hybridisation conditions" can be used to identify nucleotide sequences, which are substantially identical to a given nucleotide sequence. The stringency of the hybridization conditions are sequence dependent and will be different in different circumstances. Generally, stringent conditions are selected to be about 5°C lower than the thermal melting point (Tm) for the specific sequences at a defined ionic, strength and pH. The Tm is the temperature (under defined ionic strength and pH) at which 50% of the target sequence hybridises to a perfectly matched probe. Typically stringent conditions will be chosen in which the salt concentration is about 0.02 molar at pH 7 and the temperature is at least 60°C. Lowering the salt concentration and/or increasing the temperature increases stringency. Stringent conditions for RNA-DNA hybridisations (Northern blots using a probe of e.g. 100 nt) are for example those which include at least one wash in 0.2X SSC at 63°C for 20 min, or equivalent conditions. Stringent conditions for DNA-DNA hybridisation (Southern blots using a probe of e.g. lOOnt) are for example those which include at least one wash (usually 2) in 0.2X SSC<br>
TOat a temperature of at least 50°C, usually about 55°C, for 20 min, or equivalent conditions. Sec also Sambrook el al. (1989) and Sambrook and Russell (2001). "Sequence identity" and "sequence similarity" can be determined by alignment of two peptide or two nucleotide sequences using global or local alignment algorithms, depending on the length of the two sequences. Sequences of similar lengths arc preferably aligned using a global alignment algorithms (e.g. Needleman Wunsch) which aligns the sequences optimally over the entire length, while sequences of substantially different lengths arc preferably aligned using a local alignment algorithm (e.g. Smith Waterman). Sequences may then be referred to as "substantially identical" or "essentially similar" when they (when optimally aligned by for example the programs GAP or BESTFJT using default parameters) share at least a certain minimal percentage of sequence identity (as defined below). GAP uses the Needleman and Wunsch global alignment algorithm to align two seqiiences over their entire length (full length), maximizing the number of matches and minimizing the number of gaps. A global alignment is suitably used to determine sequence identity when the two sequences have similar lengths. Generally, the GAP default parameters are used, with a gap creation penalty = 50 (nucleotides) / 8 (proteins) and gap extension penalty = 3 (nucleotides) / 2 (proteins). For nucleotides the default scoring matrix used is nwsgapdna and for proteins the default scoring matrix is Blosum62 (Henikoff &amp; Henikoff, 1992, PNAS 89, 915-919). Sequence alignments and scores for percentage sequence identity may be determined using computer programs, such as the GCG Wisconsin Package, Version 10.3, available from Accelrys Inc., 9685 Scranton Road, San Diego, CA 92121-3752 USA, or using open source software, such as the program "needle" (using the global Needleman Wunsch algorithm) or "water" (using the local Smith Waterman algorithm) in EmbossWIN version 2.10.0, using the same parameters as for GAP above, or using the default settings (both for 'needle' and for 'water' and both for protein and for DNA alignments, the default Gap opening penalty is 10.0 and the default gap extension penalty is 0.5; default scoring matrices are Blossum62 for proteins and DNAFull for DNA). When sequences have a substantially different overall lengths, local alignments, such as using the Smith Waterman algorithm, are preferred. Alternatively percentage similarity or identity may be determined by searching against public databases, using algorithms such as FASTA, BLAST, etc.<br>
-H-In this document and in its claims, the verb "to comprise" and its conjugations is used in its non-limiting sense to mean that items following the word arc included, but items not specifically mentioned are not excluded. In addition, reference to an element by the indefinite article "a" or "an" does not exclude the possibility that more than one of the element is present, unless the context clearly requires that there be one and only one of" the elements. The indefinite article "a" or "an" thus usually means "at least one". It is further understood that, when referring to "sequences" herein, generally the actual physical molecules with a certain sequence of subunits (e.g. amino acids) arc referred to.<br>
Whenever reference to a "plant" or "plants" (or a plurality of plants) according to the invention is made, it is understood that also plant parts (cells, tissues or organs, seeds, severed or harvested parts, leaves, seedlings, flowers, pollen, fruit, stems, roots, callus, protoplasts, etc), progeny or clonal propagations of the plants which retain the distinguishing characteristics of the parents (e.g. presence of a trans-gene), such as seed obtained by sclfing or crossing, e.g. hybrid seed (obtained by crossing two inbred parental lines), hybrid plants and plant parts derived therefrom are encompassed herein, unless otherwise indicated.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
When testing transgenic plants comprising the CaMV 35S promoter (single 35S promoter, described by Franck et al, 1980, Cell 21, 285-294) in field trials in Spain it was found that the activity of the 35S promoter was influenced by high summer temperatures. In older leaves, a total loss of expression occurred. The present inventors, therefore, initiated a program for isolating plant promoters which have constitutive activity in plant cells and organs, and which are essentially insensitive to one or more biotic and/or abiotic stresses, as such a promoter is desired for controlled expression of nucleic acid sequences in transgenic plants, especially in plants which may be exposed to one or more stress conditions during their development or at maturity. Using cDNA-AFLP, genes of strong and constitutive promoters were isolated from tomato plants, which retained strong, constitutive transcription profiles under stress conditions, such as drought stress, cold stress, heat stress, pathogen stress (CMV infection), day-length variation, radiation (e.g. UV induced stress), water-stress (over watering and under watering), etc. (see Examples). By isolating the corresponding promoters, a class of<br>
promotcrs was found which conferred (or is capable of conferring) strong, constitutive expression in plants. The promoter strength was at least equivalent, and in some host species (tomato) significantly higher than that of the CaMV 35S promoter. Further, the promoters do not show reduced activity (i.e. remain strong and constitutive) when plants or plant parts comprising these are subjected to various biotic and/or abiotic stress conditions. These promoters are herein referred to as the "AA6 promoters".<br>
Nucleic acid sequences, chimeric genes and vectors<br>
In one embodiment isolated nucleic acid sequences (preferably genomic or synthetic DNA sequences), having promoter activity in plant cells, arc provided which show strong, constitutive transcriptional activity in plants and plant tissues or organs. The promoters are active in preferably all plant organs, but at least in the major organs and the promoter strength is at least essentially equal to that of 35S (or stronger) (the CaMV 35S promoter described by Franck et al., supra). Preferably the promoter activity of the nucleic acid sequences is not reduced, or at least not significantly reduced, when the transgenic plant, or plant tissue or organ, is subjected to one or more abiolic and/or biotie stresses. A significant reduction in this respect refers to a statistically significant (quantitative) reduction of promoter activity by 1% or more (e.g. 2%, 3%, 5%, 10%, etc., up to 100%) compared to the activity in the same tissues or organs under non-stress conditions. Thus, preferably the promoters remain strong and constitutive (preferably in all organs, especially at least the major plant organs) under stress conditions.<br>
In one embodiment a constitutive AA6 promoter is provided comprising SEQ ID NO: 1 ("3kb" promoter) or SEQ ID NO: 2 ("5kb" promoter), or any one of SEQ ID NO: 6-9 (SEQ ID NO: 6 and 8 are "3kb" promoters and SEQ ID NO: 7 and 9 are "5kb"promoters with some nucleotide ambiguities or slightly different sequences compared to SEQ ID NO: 1 and 2), or the promoter sequences cloned into pKG8135 (CBS120175) or pKG8137 (CBS120176), or active (functional) fragments of any of these which have promoter activity at least in plants, such as fragments of at least 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 800, 900, 1000, 1200, 1500, 2000, 2500, 2800, 2900, 3000, 3500, 4000, 4500 or more consecutive nucleotides of SEQ ID NO: 1 or 2, SEQ ID NO: 6-9, or promoters within pKG8135 (CBS120175) or pKG8137 (CBS120176). "Active<br>
fragmcnts" or "functional fragments", or "fragments having promoter activity" refer to nucleic acid fragments which arc capable of conferring constitutive transcription in plant cells, organs and plants, preferably in at least the same tissues and organs as SEQ ID NO: 1 and 2, SEQ ID NO: 6-9, or promoters within pKG8135 (CBS120175) or pKG8137 (CBS 120176). This can be tested as described below, by transforming a plant cell with such a fragment, preferably operably linked to a reporter gene, and assaying the promoter activity qualitatively (spatio-temporal transcription) and/or quantitatively.<br>
When referring herein to SEQ ID NO: 1 it is understood that reference is also made to any of SEQ ID NO: 6 or 8, or the sequence present in pKG8135 (CBS 120175) and that the sentence can be read to refer to any of these promoter sequences. Likewise, when referring herein to SEQ ID NO: 2 it is understood that reference is also made to any of SEQ ID NO: 7 or 9, or the sequence present in pKG8137 (CBS120175) and that the sentence can be read'to refer to any of these promoter sequences.<br>
In one embodiment, the strength of the promoter fragments is quantitatively essentially identical to, or higher than, that of SEQ ID NO: 1 and/or 2 (and therefore also that of 35S). As SEQ ID NO: 1 and 2 are sequences directly upstream of the translation initiation codon (AUG on the mRNA or ATG on the DNA), active fragments are preferably generated by deletions at the 5' end of SEQ ID NO: 1 and/or 2. The fragments, therefore, preferably comprise at least 200, 300, 400, 500, etc. nucleotides (as above) of the 3' region of SEQ ID NO: 1 or 2. Obviously, DNA fragments may be generated in a number of ways, e.g. using de novo DNA synthesis, or restriction enzymes, or terminal nucleases, etc.<br>
However, removal of certain cis-acting elements (such as enhancer sequences) may result in lower promoter activity. Therefore, in a different embodiment the strength of the promoter fragments is quantitatively lower than that of SEQ ID NO: 1 and/or 2 (and therefore also that of 35S). For some applications, promoters with reduced strength are preferred. A skilled person can easily determine the activity of the full length promoters and any promoter fragments using methods known in the art, and can compare the strength and tissue specificity to that of 35S or to that of the promoters provided herein.<br>
For example Medbcrry et al. (Plant Cell, 1992, Vol. 4: 185-192) describe methods for comparing promoter strength using transient expression assays.<br>
The promoters of SEQ ID NO: 1 and 2, and functional fragments thereof, arc preferably insensitive to at least one (but preferably more, most preferably any) biotic an&amp;'or abiotic stress to which the plant or plant cell(s), tissues or organs comprising the promoter may be exposed (see below). Thus, activity remains constitutive and strong during exposure to stress conditions.<br>
Also provided are "variants" of the above AA6 promoters and functional fragments of such variants. These variants include nucleic acid sequences essentially similar to SEQ ID NO: 1 and/or SEQ ID NO: 2 (and functional fragments of these variant sequences, as described above), and which have constitutive promoter activity, i.e. which are also capable of providing constitutive transcription in plants, plant cells, tissues or organs, most preferably in at least the same tissues and organs as SEQ \D NO: 1 and 2. Sequences which are "essentially similar" to SEQ ID NO: 1 and/or 2 are nucleic acid sequences comprising at least about 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99% or more nucleic acid sequence identity to SEQ ID NO: 1 and/or to SEQ ID NO: 2 (over the full length), using the Needleman and Wunsch Pairwise alignment (program "GAP" in GCG or "needle" in Embosswin, version 2.10.0) with gap creation penalty = 50 and gap extension penalty = 3) and which have promoter activity in plants or plant cells. In a preferred embodiment, the activity of the variants (and functional fragments) is strong in all of the tissues and organs, i.e. quantitatively at least as strong (or stronger) than SEQ ID NO: 1 or 2. In a further embodiment the activity of these variants (and functional fragments thereof) is insensitive to one or more biotic and/or abiotic stresses, i.e. remains strong and constitutive.<br>
It is clear that many methods can be used to identify, synthesise or isolate variants or functional fragments of the nucleic acid sequences provided herein, such as nucleic acid hybridization, PCR technology, in silico analysis and nucleic acid synthesis, and the like. For example, nucleic acid hybridization can be used to identify DNA sequences in other plant species or varieties which hybridize to SEQ ID NO: 1 or 2, or to fragments of these, under stringent or moderately stringent hybridization conditions.<br>
Alternatively, sequence databases can be screened in silico for variant sequences using known algorithms, such as BLAST, FASTA, etc. In this way it is feasible to isolate variant sequences from other plant species or other varieties of tomato, or from other organisms altogether. Especially included herein are the promoters of other alleles of the same gene (cytosolic cysteine synthase gene and orthologs thereof) found in other varieties of tomato or in other plant species, especially species of the genus Solatium, as will be described below. For example, cDNA libraries may be constructed from one or more plant species, one or more varieties, or different tissues of one species or variety. The cDNA libraries may be screened for cysteine synthase eDNAs (using e.g. probes or primers derived from SEQ ID NO: 4 (tomato cysteine synthase cDNA), or fragments or variants thereof). Equally, differential display methods (such as cDNA-AFLP) may be used to identify cysteine synthase transcripts, as described in the Examples. Methods such as TAIL-PCR (Liu et al. 1995, Genomics 25(3):674-81; Liu et al. 2005, Methods Mol Biol. 286:341-8), Linker-PCR, or Inverse PCR (IPCR) may be used to isolate the upstream transcription regulatory region of the gene.<br>
Whether a nucleic acid sequence (or fragment of variant) has constitutive promoter activity, i.e. is capable of conferring constitutive transcription in all organs, whether the activity is "strong", and whether the activity of the nucleic acid sequence is insensitive to at least one (but preferably more, most preferably any) biotic and/or abiotic stress to which the transgenic cell, tissue, organ or organisms (especially plant or plant cell), may be exposed, can be determined using various methods. Generally, one can distinguish qualitative methods and quantitative methods. Qualitative methods (such as histological GUS staining) are used to determine the spatio-temporal activity of the promoter (is the promoter active or not in a certain tissue or organ, or under certain environmental/developmental conditions?), while quantitative methods (such as fluorometric GUS assays) also quantify the level of activity, compared to controls. Suitable controls are, for example, plants transformed with empty vectors (negative control) or transformed with constructs comprising other promoters, such as CaMV 35S, or non-transgenic plants.<br>
To test and optionally quantify the relative or absolute activity, a cloned or synthetic nucleic acid molecule, such as SEQ ID NO: J, 2, or variants thereof, or fragments of<br>
In-any of these, may be opcrably linked to a known nucleic acid sequence (e.g. a reporter gene, such as gusA, or any gene encoding a specific protein) and may be used to transform a plant cell using known methods. In some embodiments the cell need not be transformed in a stable manner, i.e. transient expression assays may be used (e.g. protoplast transfection or Agroinfiltration) to determine whether the promoter is active in the cells, tissues or organs and to what degree the promoter is driving transcription. The activity of the promoter can, for example, be assayed (and optionally quantified) by detecting the level of RNA transcripts of the downstream nucleic acid sequence. This may be done using quantitative methods, such as e.g. quantitative RT-PCR or other PCR based methods, and the like. Alternatively, the reporter protein or the activity of the reporter protein may be assayed and quantified. For example, if the reporter gene is the gus gene, a fiuoromctric GUS assay may be used, as described in the Examples. In this way, the quantitative promoter activity levels of transformed plants or plant cells maintained under normal physiological (non-stress) conditions can be compared to levels of plants or plant cells which arc exposed to one or more biotic or abiotic stresses. Also, relative or absolute activity levels can be compared to constitutive control promoters, such as the 35S promoter, double-35S promoter, or SEQ ID NO: 1 and/or 2. It is understood that preferably average promoter activity levels are determined and compared using statistical methods.<br>
Thus, in which tissues or organs a promoter according to the invention is active at a certain time (spatio-temporal activity) can, for example, be tested by transforming plants or plant cells with a promoter-reporter gene construct and analyzing various tissues during various developmental stages for the RNA transcript or reporter protein (or its activity). One simple test employs for example histochemical GUS staining, whereby visual assessment of blue colour indicates activity in various tissues and at various developmental stages.<br>
As already mentioned, it is preferred that the promoter activity is constitutive and preferably also strong in plants and plant cells, especially in the host species or variety into which the sequence is introduced. Constitutive activity means that the transcript of any nucleic acid sequence operably linked to the promoter is preferably produced in most   tissues   (or   organs)   under   most   (normal,   non-stressed)   physiological   and<br>
developmental conditions. In one embodiment, the promoters according to the invention arc at least active in the tissues or organs tested in the Examples, such as leaves (young and old), roots, flowers, seeds, stems (main stem), fruit (e.g. immature and mature fruit), germinated seeds, etc.<br>
Preferably, the promoters according to the invention provide strong, constitutive activity in all plant species, both dicotyledonous species and monocotyledonous species. For example, it was found that SEQ ID NO: 1 and SEQ ]D NO: 2 provided strong, constitutive expression in various plant species, such as tomato, tobacco, Brassica, melon and lettuce (see Examples).<br>
The strength (quantitative activity) of the AA6 promoters according to the invention (including fragments or variants) in terms of its ability to drive expression of nucleic acid sequences linked downstream (3') can be determined quantitatively using various known methods. For example, the amount of transcribed transcript (mRNA) can be quantified using quantitative RT-PCR or northern blotting. Preferably, the promoter strength is at least essentially equal to that of CaMV 35S (Franck et al., supra) under normal (non-stressed) conditions. "Strong" means, thus, that the promoter strength is preferably at least about identical, but more preferably stronger than that of 35 S under normal, non-stressed conditions. Most preferably, the average quantitative promoter activity in the various tissues and organs is at least equivalent to the activity of the CaMV 35S promoter, or is at least 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 70%, 75%, or more, higher than the average activity of the CaMV 35S promoter. It is understood that the same copy number and zygosity level of transformants should be compared, e.g. hemizygous or homozygous for the transgene. Preferably, single copy transformants are identified and compared.<br>
The expression of the AA6 promoters remains constitutive and strong under stress conditions, at least under one or more stresses selected from those described elsewhere herein.<br>
Thus, the strength of the promoters according to the invention preferably remains essentially unchanged, or is at least not reduced (or not significantly reduced), when the plant tissues or organs  or plants  comprising the promoter are exposed to  stress<br>
conditions, selected at least from one or preferably several of: drought stress, heat stress, water-stress (both too much and too little water), pathogen stress (e.g. virus infection such as CMV, fungai infection, bacterial infection, etc.), pest stress (e.g. insect feeding), wounding, salt stress, radiation stress, etc. Again, quantitative tests can be used to determine this. For example, recombinant plants comprising the promoter may be transferred from a normal temperature environment to a warm environment (such as about 27°C to up to about 50oC), and the promoter activity in various tissues may be compared to the activity in the same tissues under the normal and under the warm temperature conditions.<br>
Variants of the AA6 promoters above also include any isolated nucleic acid promoter of a plant cysteine synthase gene, especially of a cytosolic cysteine synthase gene (i.e. the promoter of a plant gene encoding a cysteine synthase enzyme, especially a cytosolic isoform), which shows strong and constitutive activity in plants and is preferably essentially insensitive to one or more biotic and/or abiotic stresses. As already mentioned, it is likely that also other plant cysteine synthase genes have strong, constitutive promoters, which retain constitutive expression under one or more stress conditions. Plant cysteine synthase genes are genes which encode the enzyme cysteine synthase, also referred to as O-acetyl-L-serine[thiol]-lyase (EC 4.2.99.8). Several cysteine synthase genes have been cloned (see e.g. TC162833, referred to in the Examples), but the usefulness of their promoters for driving strong, constitutive expression of homologous or heterologous sequences in transgenic plants has not been described. The promoters of such known or as yet unknown cysteine synthase genes may thus be isolated and screened for their activity. For example, eDNA-AFLP, other PCR based methods or Northern hybridization may be used to isolate or identify other cysteine synthase genes, especially those genes which endogenously produced cysteine synthase mRNAs constitutively and also under one or more stress conditions. Those cysteine synthase genes with the desired expression pattern are then selected and their promoter can be cloned using known methods. In a preferred embodiment, the promoter is obtained from a cysteine synthase gene from a plant belonging to the family So/anaceae, such as species of the genus Solatium (including the reclassified Lycopersicon species), Nicotiana, Capsicum, Petunia, Coffea, etc.<br>
+9-The promoter according to the invention is preferably not the promoter of a weed plant, such as Arabidopsis thaliana, and is preferably not the promoter of the OASA1 gene of Arabidopsis thaliana as described in Gutierrez-Alcala et al. (J. of Exp. Botany 56, p24872494), or a fragment thereof.<br>
Apart from the cysteine synthase genes provided in SEQ ID NO: 4 (encoding the cysteine synthase enzyme of SEQ ID NO: 5), other cysteine synthase genes can be identified and their promoters isolated. Various methods may be used, as described above.<br>
Thus, in one embodiment of the invention, the promoter of a plant (cytosolic) cysteine synthase gene is provided, which has constitutive activity in plants and/or plant cells and whereby the activity is not reduced, or not reduced significantly, when the plant or plant cell, tissue or organ is exposed to one or more biotic and/or abiotic stresses, such as those described.<br>
Such promoters comprise the following: (a) any promoter which is obtainable from a plant and which drives the expression of a plant cysteine synthase gene, especially the promoter of any gene encoding a protein of SEQ ID NO: 5; (b) promoters of those plant genes which encode cysteine synthase enzymes having at least 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 95, 99%, or more, amino acid identity to SEQ ID NO: 5 (over the entire length); (c) plant promoters driving the expression of nucleic acid sequences, which encode cysteine synthase enzymes, and whereby the nucleic acid sequences comprise at least 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 95, 98, 99%, or more, nucleotide sequence identity to SEQ ID NO: 4 (over the entire length).<br>
In another embodiment the use of a promoter of a plant cysteine synthase gene for the constitutive over-expression of homologous or heterologous nucleic acid sequences in a recombinant cell or organism, especially a plant cell or plant, is provided. This use comprises operably linking the promoter to a homologous or heterologous nucleic acid sequence and transforming a plant or plant cell, as described.<br>
Although the focus above is on the use of the promoters according to the invention in plants and plant cells, it is also an embodiment of the invention to use the promoters for the expression of homologous or heterologous nucleic acid sequences in other cells and organisms, such as in any prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells or organisms, e.g. bacteria, fungi (including yeasts, such as Pichia, Ilansenula, etc.), mammals, human cells or cell lines, etc.<br>
Chimeric genes and vectors according to the invention<br>
Jn one embodiment of the invention any of the above nucleic acid sequences having promoter activity, are used to make chimeric genes, and vectors comprising these for transfer of the chimeric gene into a host cell and expression of an operably linked homologous or heterologous nucleic acid sequence in host cells, such as cells, tissues, organs or whole organisms derived from transformed cell(s).<br>
Host cells arc preferably plant cells. Any plant may be a suitable host, such as monocotyledonous plants or dicotyledonous plants, for example maize/corn (Zea species, e.g. Z. mays, Z. diploperennis (chapule), Zea luxurians (Guatemalan teosinte), Zea mays subsp. huehuetenangensis (San Antonio Huista teosinte), Z mays subsp. mexicana (Mexican teosinte), Z. mays subsp. parviglumis (Balsas teosinte), Z. perennis (perennial teosinte) and Z. ramosa, wheat {Triticum species), barley (e.g. Hordeum vulgare), oat (e.g. Avena sativa), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), rye (Secale cereale), soybean (Glycine spp, e.g. G. max), cotton (Gossypium species, e.g. G. hirsutum, G. barbadense), Brassica spp. (e.g. B. napus, B. juncea, B. oleracea, B. rapa, etc.), sunflower (Helianthus annus), tobacco (Nicotiana species), alfalfa (Medicago sativa), rice (Oryza species, e.g. O. sativa indica cultivar-group or japonica cultivar-group), forage grasses, pearl millet (Pennisetum species, e.g. P. glaucum), tree species, vegetable species, such as Lycopersicon ssp (recently reclassified as belonging to the genus Solatium), e.g. tomato (L. esculentum, syn. Solatium lycopersicum) such as e.g. cherry tomato, var. cerasiforme or current tomato, var. pimpinellifolium) or tree tomato (S. hetaceum, syn. Cyphomandra betaceae), potato (Solatium tuberosum) and other Solatium species, such as eggplant (Solatium melongena), pepino (S. tmiricatum), cocona (S". sessiliflorum) and naranjilla (S. quitoense); peppers (Capsicum annuum, Capsicum frutescens), pea (e.g. Pisum sativum), bean (e.g. Phaseolus species), carrot<br>
{Daucus carota), Lactuca species (such as Lactuca saliva, Lactuca indica, Lactuca perennis), cucumber {Cucumis sativus), melon {Cucumis melo), zucchini {Cucurbita pepo), squash {Cucurbita maxima, Cucurbita pepo, Cucurbita mixta), pumpkin {Cucurbita pepo), watermelon {Citrullus lanatus syn. Citrullus vulgaris), fleshy fruit species (grapes, peaches, plums, strawberry, mango, melon), ornamental species (e.g. Rose, Petunia, Chrysanthemum, Lily, Tulip, Gerbera species), woody trees (e.g. species of Populus, Salix, Quercus, Eucalyptus), fibre species e.g. flax {Linum usitatissinum) and hemp {Cannabis sativa). In one embodiment vegetable species, especially Solanum species (including Lycopersicon species) are preferred.<br>
Thus, for example species of the following genera may be transformed: Cucurbita, Rosa, Vitis, Juglans, Fragaria, Lotus, Medicago, Onobiychis, 'Trifolium, Trigonella, Vigna, Citrus, Linum, Geranium, Manihot, Daucus, Arabidopsis, Brassica, Raphanus, Sinapis, Atropa, Capsicum, Datura, Cucumis, Hyoscyamus, Lycopersicon, Solanum, Nicotiana, Malus, Petunia, Digitalis, Majorana, Ciahorium, Helianthus, Lactuca, Bromus, Citrullus, Asparagus, Antirrhinum, Heterocallis, Nemesis, Pelargonium, Panieum, Pennisetum, Ranunculus, Senecio, Salpiglossis, Browaalia, Glycine, Pisum, Phaseolus, Gossypuan, Glycine, Lolium, Festuca, Agrostis. A further preference is for each of Cucurbita, Brassica, Lycopersicon, Solanum, Oryza and Zea. A preference is for each of Avena, Medicago, Capsicum, Nicotiana, Lactuca, Pisum, Cucumis, Cucurbita, Brassica, Solanum (including Lycopersicon), Oryza and Zea.<br>
The construction of chimeric genes, and vectors for introduction of chimeric genes into the genome of host cells, is generally known in the art. To generate a chimeric gene the AA6 promoter sequence is operably linked to another nucleic acid sequence which is to be transcribed in the host cells, using standard molecular biology techniques. The promoter sequence may already be present in a vector so that the nucleic acid sequence which is to be transcribed is simply inserted into the vector downstream of the promoter sequence. The vector is then used to transform the host cells and the chimeric gene is preferably inserted in the nuclear genome or into the plastid, mitochondrial or chloroplast genome, so that the downstream nucleic acid sequence is expressed due to the activity of the promoter (e. g., Mc Bride et al., 1995 Bio/Technology 13, 362; US 5,693, 507).<br>
A chimeric gene, therefore, preferably comprises an AA6 promoter as described above, operably linked to a homologous or heterologous nucleic acid sequence, and optionally followed by a 3' nontranslatcd nucleic acid sequence (3'UTR). The homologous or heterologous nucleic acid sequence may be a sequence encoding a protein or peptide, or it may be a sequence which is transcribed into an active RKA molecule, such as an sense and/or antisense RNA (dsRNA) suitable for silencing a gene or gene family in the host cell or organism.<br>
The AA6 promoter-comprising chimeric gene can be stably inserted in a conventional manner into the nuclear genome of a single plant cell, and the so-transformed plant cell can be used in a conventional manner to produce a transformed plant that has an altered phenotype due to the constitutive expression of the chimeric gene.<br>
In this regard, a T-DNA vector, comprising an AA6 promoter (or variant or fragment as described above) operably linked to a further nucleic acid sequence, in Agrobacterium tumefaciens can be used to transform the plant cell, and thereafter, a transformed plant can be regenerated from the transformed plant cell using the procedures described, for example, in EP 0 116 718, EP 0 270 822, PCT publication WO 84/02913 and published European Patent application EP 0 242 246 and in Gould et al. (1991, Plant Physiol. 95,426-434). The construction of a T-DNA vector for Agrobacterium mediated plant transformation is well known in the art. The T-DNA vector may be either a binary vector as described in EP 0 120 561 and EP 0 120 515 or a co-integrate vector which can integrate into the Agrobacterium Ti-plasmid by homologous recombination, as described in EP 0 116 718.<br>
Preferred T-DNA vectors each contain an AA6 promoter operably linked to the nucleic acid sequence to be transcribed between T-DNA border sequences, or at least located to the left of the right border sequence. Border sequences are described in Gielen et al. (1984, EMBO J 3,835-845). Of course, other types of vectors can be used to transform the plant cell, using procedures such as direct gene transfer (as described, for example in EP 0 223 247, or particle or microprojectile bombardment as described in US 2005/055740 and WO 2004/092345), pollen mediated transformation (as described, for<br>
 cxamplc in EP 0 270 356 and WO 85/01856), protoplast transformation as, for example, described in US 4,684, 61], plant virus- mediated transformation, liposomc-mediated transformation (as described, for example in US 4,536, 475), and other methods such as those described methods for transforming certain lines of maize (e. g., US 6,140, 553; Fromm et al., 1990, Bio/Technology 8, 833-839; Gordon-Kamm et al, 1990, The Plant Cell 2, 603-618) and rice (Shimamoto et al, 1989, Nature 338, 274-276; Datta et al. 1990, Bio/Technology 8, 736-740) and the method for transforming monocots generally (WO 92/09696). For cotton transformation sec also WO 00/71733, and for rice transformation see also the methods described in WO 92/09696, WO 94/00977 and WO 95/06722. For sorghum transformation see e.g. Jeoung JM et al. 2002, Hereditas 137: 20-8 or Zhao ZY et al. 2000, Plant Mol Biol. 44:789-98). For tomato or tobacco transformation see also An G. et al., 1986, Plant Physiol. 81: 301-305; Horsch R.B. et al., 1988, In: Plant Molecular Biology Manual A5, Dordrecht, Netherlands, Kluwcr Academic Publishers, pp 1-9; Koornnccf M. et al., 1986, In: Ncvins D.J. and R.A. Jones, cds. Tomato Biotechnology, New York, NY, USA, Alan R. Liss, Inc. pp 169-178). Likewise, selection and regeneration of transformed plants from transformed cells is well known in the art. Obviously, for different species and even for different varieties or cultivars of a single species, protocols are specifically adapted for regenerating transformants at high frequency.<br>
Besides transformation of the nuclear genome, also transformation of the plastid genome, preferably the chloroplast genome, is included in the invention. One advantage of plastid genome transformation is that the risk of spread of the transgene(s) can be reduced. Plastid genome transformation can be carried out as known in the art, see e.g. Sidorov VA et al. 1999, Plant J. 19: 209-216 or Lutz KA et al. 2004, Plant J. 37(6):906-13.<br>
The resulting transformed plant can be used in a conventional plant breeding scheme to produce more transformed plants containing the transgene. Single copy transformants can be selected, using e.g. Southern Blot analysis or PCR based methods or the Invader® Technology assay (Third Wave Technologies, Inc.). Transformed cells and plants can easily be distinguished from non-transformed ones by the presence of the chimeric gene. The sequences of the plant DNA flanking the insertion site of the<br>
lransgcnc can also be sequenced, whereby an "Event specific" detection method can be developed, for routine use. See for example WO 01/41558, which describes elite event detection kits (such as PCR detection kits) based for example on the integrated sequence and the Hanking (genomic) sequence.<br>
In one embodiment the nucleic acid sequence which is to be transcribed, and optionally translated (if it is a coding sequence), is inserted into the plant genome so that the sequence to be transcribed is upstream (i.e. 5') of suitable 3'cnd transcription regulation signals ("3'cnd") (i.e. transcript formation and polyadenylation signals). Polyadcnylation and transcript formation signals include those of the nopalinc synthase gene ("3' nos") (Depicker et a!., 1982 J. Molec. Appl. Genetics 1, 561-573.), the octopine synthase gene ("3'ocs") (Gielen et al., 1984, EMBO J 3, 835-845) and the T-DNA gene 7 ("3' gene 7") (Velten and Scheli, 1985, Nucleic Acids Research 13, 6981-6998), which act as 3'-untranslatcd DNA sequences in transformed plant cells, and others.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the 3'end sequence used is that of a plant cysteine synthase gene, preferably from the cysteine synthase gene from which also the AA6 promoter is obtainable. Suitable 3'end sequences provided herein are SEQ ID NO: 3, or a fragment or variant thereof. A variant of SEQ ID NO: 3 includes nucleic acid sequences comprising at least 50, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 98, 99%, or more, nucleic acid sequence identity to SEQ ID NO: 3. Fragments of SEQ ID NO: 3, or of variants of SEQ ID NO: 3, include nucleic acid sequences comprising at least 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300 or more consecutive nucleotides of SEQ ID NO: 3 or of a variant of SEQ ID NO: 3. These 3' end sequences are also an embodiment as such, and may be used to construct any chimeric gene and vector, i.e. also in combination with a different promoter.<br>
The nucleic acid sequence to be expressed is in one embodiment a sequence encoding a protein or peptide, including hybrid proteins or peptides or fusion proteins. The coding sequence may be of any origin, i.e. plant, fungus (including yeast), animal, bacterial, synthetic, viral, etc. It may also comprise a sequence encoding a targeting peptide, such as a secretion signal peptide or a plastid targeting signal. A coding sequence may also<br>
be linked in-frame to a gene encoding a selectable or scorablc marker, such as for example the nco (or nptll) gene (EP 0 242 236) conferring kanamycin resistance, so that the cell expresses a fusion protein which is easily detectable. Although the coding region (cDNA or genomic DNA) of any gene may be used, examples of the coding regions of the following genes are preferably operably linked to an AA6 promoter according to the invention: 1. inverted repeat sequences of viral nucleic acid sequences (e.g. sense and antisense sequences of viral coat protein genes; see also below); 2. disease signal transduction pathway genes or disease resistance genes; 3. abiotic stress response related genes (e.g. SHINE transcription factors, or CBF/DRE13 genes); 4. secondary metabolite biosynthesis genes, including genes for the production of therapeutic and/or pharmacologically important products or industrially valuable compounds.<br>
Obviously, also other genes may be operably linked to the AA6 promoters of the invention, such as genes affecting agronomic traits, such as genes for herbicide resistance (e.g. EPSPS genes, the bar or PAT gene), genes affecting yield or quality traits (e.g. protein composition), and the like.<br>
The chimeric genes or vectors according to the invention can also be used to transform microorganisms, such as bacteria (e.g. Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas, Agrobacterium, Bacillus, etc.) or fungi or algae or insects, or the genes or vectors may be used to engineer viruses. Transformation of bacteria with nucleic acid sequence of this invention, incorporated in a suitable cloning vehicle, can be carried out in a conventional manner, preferably using conventional electroporation techniques as described in Maillon et al. (1989, FEMS Microbiol. Letters 60, 205-210.) and WO 90/06999. For expression of coding sequences in prokaryotic host cell, the codon usage of the nucleic acid sequence may be optimized accordingly (likewise, for expression of coding sequences in plant cells, codon usage of the nucleic acid sequence may be optimized as known). Intron sequences should be removed and other adaptations for optimal expression may be made as known.<br>
For obtaining enhanced expression of a nucleic acid sequence in monocot plants such as grass species, e.g. maize or rice, an intron, preferably a monocot intron, can be added<br>
to the chimeric gene. For example the insertion of the intron of the maize Adhl gene into the 5' regulatory region has been shown to enhance expression in maize (Callis et. al., 1987, Genes Develop. 1: 1183-1200). Likewise, the HSP70 intron, as described in US 5,859, 347, may be used to enhance expression. Thus, one or more introns may optionally be inserted into any of the promoter sequences according to the invention, or into the 5' UTR or the coding sequence.<br>
Jn another embodiment the AA6 promoter is used to make a chimeric gene and vector for gene silencing, whereby the promoter is operably linked to a sense and/or antisense nucleic acid sequence of a target gene (endogenous gene or gene family which is to be silenced). In yet another embodiment the target gene may also be a gene or gene family of an invading plant pathogen, such as a virus. For example, an inverted repeat sequence of a viral coat protein gene may be used for making virus resistant plants. Viral coat protein genes are for example described in WO 96/21031. "Gene silencing" refers to the down-regulation or complete inhibition of gene expression of one or more target genes. The use of inhibitory RNA to reduce or abolish gene expression is well established in the art and is the subject of several reviews (e.g. Baulcombe, 1996, Plant Cell 8: 1833-1844; Stam et al, 1997, Plant Journal 12: 63-82; Depieker and Van Montagu, 1997, Curr. Opinion Cell Biol. 9: 373-382). There are a number of technologies available to achieve gene silencing in plants, such as chimeric genes which produce antisense RNA of all or part of the target gene (see e.g. EP 0 140 308 B1, EP 0 240 208 B1 and EP 0 223 399 B1), or which produce sense RNA (also referred to as co-suppression), see EP 0 465 572 B1.<br>
The most successful approach so far has however been the production of both sense and antisense RNA of the target gene ("inverted repeats"), which forms double stranded RNA (dsRNA) in the cell and silences the target gene(s). Methods and vectors for dsRNA production and gene silencing have been described in EP 1 068 311, EP 983 370A1.EP 1 042 462 A1,EP 1071 762 A1 and EP 1 080 208 Al.<br>
A vector according to the invention may therefore comprise an AA6 promoter operably linked to a sense and/or antisense DNA fragment of a target gene. Short (sense and antisense) stretches of the target gene sequence, such as at least about 17, 18, 19, 20,<br>
21, 22, 23, 24 or 25 nucleotides of coding or non-coding sequence may be sufficient. Longer sequences arc frequently also used, such as at least about 100, 200, 250, 300, 400, 500, 1000, 1500 nucleotides, or more. Preferably, the sense and antisense fragments are separated by a spacer sequence, such as an intron, which forms a loop (or hairpin) upon dsRNA formation. Any stretch of the target gene may be used to make a gene silencing vector and a transgenic plant in which the target gene or gene family is silenced. A convenient way of generating hairpin constructs is to use generic vectors such as pHANNlBAL and pHELLSGATE, vectors based on the Gateway® technology (see Wesley et al. 2004, Methods Mol Biol. 265:117-30; Wesley et al. 2003, Methods Mol Biol. 236:273-86 and Helliwell &amp; Waterhouse 2003, Methods 30(4):289-95.), all incorporated herein by reference.<br>
By choosing conserved nucleic acid sequences of the target gene, the family members in a host plant can be silenced. Where the target gene is a gene or gene family of an invading pathogen, the pathogen's target gene will be silenced and the plant will become resistant to the pathogen. Encompassed herein are also transgenic plants comprising an AA6 promoter, operably linked to a sense and/or antisense DNA fragment of a target gene nucleic acid sequence and exhibiting a target gene silencing phenotype. The phenotype will depend on the function of the gene, and may be a chemical or molecular change, macroscopically visible or not visible. Such chimeric genes and vectors can, therefore, also be used to detennine or verify the function of genes.<br>
The chimeric genes according to the invention may be introduced stably into the host genome or may be present as an episomal unit.<br>
Transgenic cells and organisms according to the invention<br>
Transgenic cells and organisms, especially plants, plant cells, tissues or organs are provided, obtainable by the above methods. These cells and organisms are characterized by the presence of a chimeric gene in their cells or genome by the presence of an AA6 promoter according to the invention. In addition, the mRNA transcript or the translated protein, may alter the phenotype of the cells or organism, e.g. of the plant cell or plant.<br>
Although the AA6 promoter is constitutive, the position in the genome can affect the activity of the promoter and the expression level of the chimeric gene. Therefore, transiformants ("Events" or "Transformation Events") expressing high, constitutive levels of the protein or of the sense and/or antisense transcript (when silencing constructs arc used) can be selecied by e.g. analysing copy number (Southern blot analysis), mRNA transcript levels (e.g. Northern blot analysis or RT-PCR) or by analysing the presence and level of protein encoded by the nucleic acid sequence (e.g. SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis; EL1SA assays, immunocytological assays, etc). The transibrmants can also be tested for the stability of expression under one or more biotic and/or abiotic stress conditions and those events which retain high, constitutive expression under one or more of the desired conditions can be identified and selected for further use.<br>
The transgenic plants can be used in traditional breeding methods, such as crossing, sclfing, backcrossing, etc. By selfing the transformanls, plants which are homozygous for the transgene can be generated. Breeding procedures are known in the art and are described in standard text books of plant breeding, e.g., Allard, R.W., Principles of Plant Breeding (1960) New York, NY, Wiley, pp 485; Simmonds, N.W., Principles of Crop Improvement (1979), London, UK, Longman, pp 408; Sneep, J. et al., (1979) Tomato Breeding (p. 135-171) in: Breeding of Vegetable Crops, Mark J. Basset, (1986, editor), The Tomato crop: a scientific basis for improvement, by Atherton, J.G. &amp; J. Rudich (editors), Plant Breeding Perspectives (1986); Fehr, Principles of Cultivar Development—Theory and Technique (1987) New York, NY, MacMillan.<br>
Transgenic cells or organisms can also be used in cell cultures (plant cell cultures, bacterial or fungal cell cultures such as yeast cultures, human or mammalian cell cultures, insect cell cultures), for example for the large scale production of recombinant proteins. In one embodiment a cell culture is provided, comprising cells comprising an AA6 promoter according to the invention.<br>
Methods and uses according to the invention<br>
Also provided is a method for making a transgenic plant or plant cell, comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	generating a chimeric gene or a vector comprising an AA6 promoter and/or an AA6 3'UTR according to the invention, operably linked to a nucleic acid sequence to be expressed;<br>
(b)	transforming a plant or plant cell with said chimeric gene or vector; and, optionally,<br>
(c)	regenerating a transgenic plant or plants.<br>
Further, transgenic plants may be identified which provide strong, constitutive promoter activity under non-stress conditions, and whereby the promoter activity remains essentially unchanged (is at least not reduced, or not reduced significantly) when the plant is exposed to one or more biotic and/or abiotic stresses.<br>
The plants may be used in conventional agricultural and breeding methods. In particular, they may be grown in environments which subject the plants to one or more biotic and/or abiotic stress conditions, without reducing the activity of the promoter. Thus, a method for growing transgenic plants in e.g areas with high or low temperature, strong winds, high salt, high soil contaminants, high or low water levels, drought spells, areas of high disease or pest pressure, high radiation, etc. without reducing, or at least without significantly reducing the promoter activity is provided.<br>

^ Transformation vectors were incorporated into Agrobacterium tumefaciens var. GV2260.<br>
Qualitative analysis of promoter activity was carried out using histological GUS assays: Various plant parts were incubated overnight at 37°C with shaking in the presence of atmospheric oxygen with Xgluc substrate in phosphate buffer (5-bromo-4-chloro-indolyl glucuronide, 1 mg/ml, K2HPO4, 40 mM, KH2PO4, 10 mM, pH 7.4). The samples were de-stained by repeated washing with ethanol. Non-transgenic plants were used as negative controls.<br>
Quantitative analysis of promoter activity was carried out using a fluorometric GUS<br>
assay:<br>

(Na2HPO4, 77.4 mM, NaH2PO4, 22.6 mM) using metal beads followed by<br>
centrifugation and collection of the supernatant.<br>
Fluorometric GUS assays:<br>
 Protein concentration in an aliquot from each supernatant was measured using the Nano Orange Kit from Molecular Probes, Inc. Protein samples were diluted to normalize the total protein concentration. Aliquots of the protein samples were incubated overnight at 37°C with the substrate 4-methyl umbellifcryl ß-d-glucuronide (MUG) (end concentration Img/ml). Fluorescence measurements at time zero and after overnight incubation were taken by removing aliquots of the reaction mixture and adding Na2CO3 solution (end concentration 1.1M) to stop the reaction then measuring emission at 460nm caused by excitation at 355nm.<br>
Example 2 - Selection ol'a gene for promoter isolation<br>
Differential analysis was performed using cDNA-AFLP® (Volkmuth W., et a!., 2003, Genome-Wide cDNA-AFLP® Analysis of the Arabidopsis Transcriptome, OMICS, 7, 2; Vos, P. and Stanssens P., 2002, AFLP-based transcript profding, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, unit 25B.5., Ausubcl, F.M., Brent, R., Kingston, R.E., Moore, D.D., Scidman, J.G. Smith, J.A., Struhl, K., John Wiley and Sons, New York; and Vos et a/., 1995, AFLP: a new technique for DNA fingerprinting, Nucleic Acids Research 23: 4407-4414) on cDNA isolated from tomato plant material at various stages of development (young leaf, old leaf, stem, root, in vitro leaf, in vitro stem, in vitro root, callus, immature and mature green fruit, breaker stage fruit, red fruit, flowers, total seedlings). Expression profiles were produced using all possible Taql/Msel primer combinations with two selective nucleotides for the Taql primer and three selective nucleotides for the Msel primer. Subsequent gene fragment expression profiles were produced using Keygene N.V. proprietary software (Improve™) and stored in a database. Thirteen candidate transcripts corresponding to 12 Taql/Msel primer combinations were selected which showed strong, constitutive expression in all sampled tissues.<br>
Expression of the candidate genes was then measured by cDNA-AFLP® in various tissues under biotic and abiotic stresses. Three week old tomato plants (Moneyberg) were grown for 14 days with the following separate stress conditions:<br>
infection with Cucumber Mosaic Virus (CMV), high temperature (37°C day and 25"C night), low temperature (10°C day and 5°C night), drought stress (minimal water to<br>
avoid plant death, with 37°C day and 25"C night) and wounding (crushing leaves with tweezers) 2 days prior to harvest.<br>
The following material was harvested: young leaves, old leaves, stern, roots and flowerbuds. cDNA from these materials was produced and differential analysis performed using cDNA-AFLP® with the same primer combinations (and also using primer combinations with fewer selective nucleotides) required to amplify the 13 selected candidate transcripts (sec below for primer sequences). Seven transcripts were selected which continued to give strong, constitutive expression under all the above stress conditions.<br>
The primer sequences  of the (+2/+2) AFLP  primers which  amplify the  cysteine synthase gene (AA6) fragment are:<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The candidate cDNA AFLP fragments were cut from the gel, purified, cloned and sequenced. The sequence information was then used to design primers for RACE PCR.<br>
Both 5' and 3' end SMART-RACE-PCR (Clontech) was performed to produce extended gene fragments of the 7 candidate genes, these were cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) and subsequently sequenced (BaseClcar, P.O. Box 1336, 2302 BH, Leiden, The Netherlands). The extended gene fragments were assembled along with homologous ESTs from public databases. This resulted in full length cDNA sequences for 5 candidate genes.<br>
A copy count assessment for the 5 genes was performed using Southern blotting with tomato genomic DNA digested with 10 different restriction enzymes and using 5' end fragments of the cDNAs as probes. The same probes were also hybridized to an existing Moneyberg BAC library (Keygene N.V.).<br>
 One of the full length cDNAs (designated IS 158-53; SEQ ID NO: 4) showed very high homology to the tomato cytosolic cysteine synthase gene (tomato|TC 162833 homologue to UP|Q9FS27 (Q9FS27). TC162833 and SEQ ID NO: 4 both encode the same amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO: 5), but differ at the nucleic acid level in two nucleotides. Nucleotide 'C at position 207 of SEQ ID NO: 4 is a 'T' in TCI 62833, while nucleotide 'A' at position 372 of SEQ ID NO: 4 is a 'G' in TCI 62833.<br>
SEQ ID NO: 4 was expressed constitutivcly even under biotic and abiotic stress conditions, it was present in low copy number (approximately two copies) in the tomato genome and it hybridized well to BAC 9 of the Keygcne N.V. tomato BAC library, therefore isolation of its promoter was undertaken.<br>
The promoter of the gene whose full length cDNA has homology with the tomato cysteine synthase gene (SEQ ID NO: 4) was selected, as described below.<br>
Example 3 - AA6 promoter sequence isolation<br>
Primers designed on the derived sequence of the tomato gene designated as cysteine synthase (see below for primer sequences) were used to perform linker PCR using genomic DNA from BAC 9 as template. Both 5' and 3' sequence was obtained for the UTRs of cysteine synthase. The 3' UTR sequence (SEQ ID NO: 3) was obtained by long range PCR using genomic DNA of Moneyberg tomato as template.<br>
Primers designed on cysteine synthase sequence:<br>

and nested primer	5'-CAATTAAAGTTGCTAAGCGTCCTGA-3'<br>

and nested primer	5'-CAGAGAACATGACTGTGGAGCC-3'<br>
Example 4 - Transformation vector construction<br>
Two AA6 promoter DNA fragments, one of 5000bp (SEQ ID NO: 2) and one of 2986bp (SEQ ID NO: 1), of the cysteine synthase 5' upstream region were ligatcd, together with the gusA coding region, into plasmid the pKG1562 (vector backbone;<br>
containing nptll driven by the nopalinc synthase promoter) with cither the endogenous cysteine synthase terminator (SEQ ID NO: 3) or the nos terminator.<br>
The constructs were designated:<br>
pKGS135 containing (see Fig. 3):<br>
2986 bp of the 5'upstream region of cysteine synthase (SEQ ID NO: 1) : gusA : 3" nos<br>
pKG8136 containing (sec Fig. 3):<br>
5000 bp of the 5'upstrcam region of cysteine synthase (SEQ ID NO: 2): gusA : 3'nos<br>
pKG8137 containing (see Fig. 3):<br>
5000 bp of the 5'upstream region of cysteine synthase (SEQ ID NO: 2): gusA :<br>
3'cysteine synthase (SEQ ID NO: 3)<br>
A control construct was used, as follows (sec Fig. 2):<br>
pKG1700 containing: CaMV35S promoter (Franck et a!., supra): gusA : 3' nos<br>
See Figures 1-3 for vector map details of transformation vectors used.<br>
The plasmids pKG8135, pKG8136, pKG8137 and pKG1700 were incorporated into Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Tobacco (var. SRI) and tomato (var. RZ 52201) were transformed and regenerated under kanamycin selection and primary regenerants (T0) were grown to seed.<br>
Example 5 - Expression analysis of transformants<br>
Since expression of gusA is driven by the AA6 promoter, or the CaMV35S promoter, in these vectors, the level of P-D-glucuronidase (GUS) produced in the plants indicates the effectiveness of the promoter. Histological staining assays for the presence of GUS were performed using 5-bromo-4-chloro-indolyl glucuronide (XGluc) as substrate.<br>
Staining experiments were performed on leaf tissue of both tobacco and tomato Tl plants (obtained after selfing of primary transformants) at several stages of development from seedlings through to flowering plants. Additionally, histological<br>
Sustaining experiments for GUS were performed on a range of material  from mature tobacco and tomato lines, including flower buds, open flowers, flower stems (tobacco), flower stalks, apical meristem buds, leaf, leaf stalks, main stem, roots, seeds and fruit (tomato) and also on germinating seeds and seedlings.<br>
Expression of GUS was detected in all tissues tested in both tobacco and tomato when gusA was driven by either the long fragment (SEQ ID NO: 2) or short fragment (SEQ ID NO: 1) of the AA6 promoter or the CaMV35S promoter.<br>
Visual (color staining) comparison indicated that the AA6 promoter fragments performed as well as the CaMV35S promoter in both tobacco and tomato.<br>
Quantitative analysis of GUS expression was performed with a fluoromctric assay using 4-mcthyl umbcllifcryl (3-d-glucuronidc (MUG) as substrate. Expression of GUS driven by the 5000bp fragment AA6 promoter (pKG8137) was compared with expression of GUS driven by the CaMV35S promoter (pKG1700) in both tobacco and tomato young leaves.<br>
Single copy plants were selected using Southern blotting; genomic DNA from the tobacco and tomato plants which was digested with Hindlll restriction enzyme and an nptll fragment was used as probe, the process was repeated using Xbal as restriction enzyme. Since each T-DNA insert contains one copy each of nptll and gusA, the nptll copy number reflects the gusA copy number. Copy numbers were also confirmed using an Invader® assay (Third Wave Technologies, Inc.) detecting the presence and relative quantity of the nptll gene in comparison to a known tomato or tobacco internal control; application of this assay on the T1 generation allows discrimination between hemizygous and homozygous individuals.<br>
Total protein extracts were made from pKG8137 and pKG1700 hemizygous and homozygous single copy transformants and zero copy controls of tobacco and tomato plants. Protein content was measured using the NanoOrange™ Kit (Molecular Probes) and then protein concentration in the samples was normalized by dilution with extraction buffer.<br>
Aftcr addition of MUG substrate the initial fluorescence was measured (excitation filter, 355nm and emission filler, 460nm). Samples were then incubated and fluorescence due to cleaved methyl umbelliferon (MU) was measured. Increase in fluorescence per hour of incubation was calculated. Calibration curves showing GUS enzyme (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie B.V.) activity in a background of non-transgenic tobacco or tomato total protein extract (equal to the total protein content of the test samples) were produced. Concentrations of GUS enzyme (mU/mg of total plant protein extract) present in the transgenic test samples were calculated using the fluorescence data from the samples and calibration curves.<br>
Statistical analysis of duplicate experiments indicated that the levels of GUS expression driven by the AA6 promoter (pKG8137) and the CaMV35S promoter were not significantly different in tobacco, whereas in tomato, expression of GUS due to the AA6 promoter was up to 79% higher than due to the CaMV35S promoter, in homozygous single copy plants (data sets shown in Tables below).<br>
Expression of GUS in tobacco<br>

As can be seen, the average promoter activity of the AA6 promoter (5kb promoter) is essentially equal to that of the 35S promoter in transgenic tobacco leaves (both in plants hemizygous and homozygous for the transgene).<br>

per line for homozygous tomato plants with their standard.deviation and standard error of means (SEM).<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
As can be seen in Table 4, the average promoter activity of the AA6 promoter (5kb promoter) is significantly higher (in datasct 1 about 52% higher and in datasct 2 about 79% higher than 35S, when taking 35S activity as standard) in tomato compared to that of the 35S promoter in transgenic tomato leaves (both in plants hemizygous and homozygous for the transgene).<br>
Example 6 - Promoter activity in other plant species<br>
Comparison of GUS expression driven by AA6 and CaMV35S promoters in other plant species has been tested and confirmed. At present the list of species tested with AA6 promoter driven expression of a transgene includes (besides tobacco and tomato, as shown above) lettuce, melon and Brassica, in each of which constitutive expression has been shown.<br>
Example 7 - re-sequencing of the "3kb" and "5kb" AA6 promoters<br>
The nucleic acid sequences present in vectors pKG8135 and pKG8137 (Fig. 3) were re-<br>
sequenced to check the sequences and to resolve ambiguities.<br>
The ambiguous positions are indicated in the sequence listing of SEQ ID NO: 6<br>
("3kb"promoter) and SEQ ID NO: 7 ("5kb"promoter), wherein also the most likely<br>
nucleotide at the ambiguous position is identified (see also the tables below).<br>
Due to ambiguous nucleotides, minimal sequence differences exist: SEQ ID NO: 1 has 99.6% and 99.7% sequence identity to SEQ ID NO: 8 and 6, respectively (using 'needle', Gap opening = 10.0, gap extension =0.5; DNAFull matrix). SEQ ID NO: 2 has 99.6% and 99.8% sequence identity to SEQ ID NO: 9 and 7, respectively (using 'needle', Gap opening = 10.0, gap extension =0.5; DNAFull matrix).<br>
