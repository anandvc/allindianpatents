KEYBOARD APPARATUS FOR ELECTRONIC MUSICAL INSTRUMENT<br>
BACKGROUND  OF  THE   INVENTION<br>
[Technical  Field of the  Invention]<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a keyboard device for<br>
use in an electronic musical instrument.<br>
[0002]<br>
In this specification and claims, a proximal portion of<br>
an electronic musical instrument and a keyboard device<br>
thereof to a performer is defined as a front portion, and a<br>
distal portion from the performer is defined as a rear<br>
portion.<br>
[Description of the Related Art]<br>
[00031<br>
In a keyboard of an acoustic piano, a supporting part<br>
of a black key is disposed rearward from a supporting part<br>
of a white key.  Because the black key is positioned<br>
slightly rearward from the white key, shifting the position<br>
of the support part of the black key rearward relative to<br>
the support part of the white key is advantageous.  Namely,<br>
a ratio of distances from a key pressing point to the<br>
supporting part and from the supporting part to a driving<br>
point is made comparative between the white key and the<br>
black key, thereby decreasing a difference in touch feelings.<br>
 <br>
- 2 -<br>
[0004]<br>
However, in the field of an electronic keyboard<br>
instrument, it is important to simplify the structure of the<br>
keyboard device.  Thus, the key supporting part is commonly<br>
mounted without discriminating between the white key and the<br>
black key.  One exemplary key supporting part is configured<br>
to include a recess member for receiving a protrusion<br>
provided at a rear end portion of each of the white and<br>
black keys to allow the keys to pivot (Patent Reference 1,<br>
Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. H9-198036), and<br>
another exemplary key supporting part is configured to<br>
include an elastic-piece which is integrally mounted -to the .<br>
rear end portions of the white and black keys to connect the<br>
keys and which is fixed to a keyboard frame (Patent<br>
Reference 2, Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open Publication No.<br>
H3-100894).  The above-structured electronic keyboard<br>
instrument has the problems that a difference in touch<br>
feelings between the white key and the black key is<br>
increased and it is difficult for a performer to perform<br>
accurately or express delicately.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005]<br>
Therefore, the present invention has been made in view<br>
of the above problems, and it is an object of the present<br>
 <br>
3<br>
invention to provide a keyboard device for an electronic<br>
musical instrument that is capable of decreasing a<br>
difference in touch feelings between a white key and a black<br>
key.<br>
[0006]<br>
In one aspect of the present invention, the above and<br>
other objects can be accomplished by the provision of a<br>
keyboard device for use in an electronic musical instrument,<br>
comprising a keyboard frame, a plurality of keys including<br>
white keys and black keys arranged on the keyboard frame,<br>
each key having a front portion close to a performer and a<br>
rear- portion opposite to the front portion, and supporting<br>
parts mounted on the keyboard frame for supporting the keys<br>
pivotably downward and upward, wherein the supporting parts<br>
include white key supporting parts to support the white keys<br>
and black key supporting parts to support the black keys,<br>
the supporting parts being positioned at the rear portions<br>
of the keys such that the black key supporting parts are<br>
arranged rearward relative to the white key supporting parts,<br>
and wherein the keyboard frame supports an anti-floating<br>
part which extends across the rear portions of the white<br>
keys and positioned above the white key supporting parts of<br>
the white keys so as to prevent the rear portion of the<br>
white key from floating upward when the front portion of the<br>
white key is pressed downward.<br>
 <br>
- 4 -<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, the above<br>
and other objects can be accomplished by the provision of a<br>
keyboard device for use in an electronic musical instrument,<br>
comprising a keyboard frame, a plurality of keys including<br>
white keys and black keys arranged on the keyboard frame,<br>
each key having a front portion close to a performer and a<br>
rear portion opposite to the front portion, and supporting<br>
parts mounted on the keyboard frame for supporting the keys<br>
pivotably downward and upward, wherein the supporting parts<br>
include white key supporting parts to support the white keys<br>
and black key supporting parts to support the black keys,<br>
the supporting parts being positioned at the rear portions<br>
of the keys such that the black key supporting parts are<br>
arranged rearward relative to the white key supporting parts,<br>
and wherein the keyboard frame supports anti-floating parts<br>
which extend across the rear portions of the white keys<br>
above the white key supporting parts of the white keys and<br>
also extends across the rear portions of the block keys<br>
above the black key supporting parts of the black keys so as<br>
to restrict upward floating of the rear portions of the<br>
white keys and the black keys when the front portions of the<br>
white keys and the black keys are pressed downward.<br>
[0007]<br>
According to the keyboard device for use in an<br>
electronic musical instrument of the present invention, the<br>
 <br>
- 5 -<br>
supporting parts supporting the keys pivotably upward and<br>
downward include white key supporting parts to support the<br>
white keys and black key supporting parts to support the<br>
black keys.  When a proximal portion of the keyboard device<br>
to a performer is defined as a front portion, the supporting<br>
parts are positioned at rear portions of the keys, and the<br>
black key supporting parts are staggered or shifted rearward<br>
from the white key supporting parts.  In the structure that<br>
front ends of the black keys are positioned rearward from<br>
the front ends of the white keys, the black key supporting<br>
parts are displaced rearward from the white key supporting<br>
parts Accordingly,a difference of rotation radii from the<br>
respective supporting points to the respective front ends of<br>
the keys between the black keys and the white keys is small,<br>
trajectories of finger-contact points of the keys at the<br>
front end portions thereof when pressing the keys, are<br>
formed similarly between the black keys and the white keys,<br>
and a difference of touch feelings between the white keys<br>
and the black keys is made small.<br>
Further according to one aspect of the invention, the<br>
keyboard frame supports the anti-floating part which extends<br>
near an area just above the white key supporting parts over<br>
the plurality of keys to prevent rear portions of the white<br>
keys from rising off the supporting part or floating upward<br>
from the supporting part.  In a conventional keyboard device<br>
 <br>
- 6 -<br>
for an electronic musical instrument structured such that a<br>
driving portion is mounted near the front end of each key,<br>
because an area above the rear portions of the keys are in<br>
an opened state without arrangement of a mass body and<br>
interlocking members therewith, when a large pressing force<br>
is exerted on the front ends of the keys positioned forward<br>
from the driving portions, the rear portions of the keys<br>
rise and remove away from the supporting parts, and the keys<br>
become unstably supported.  To cope with this problem, the<br>
present invention is provided with the anti-floating part so<br>
as to prevent the floating of the rear portions of the keys<br>
a_nd__to stably support the___keys. Specifically, since the<br>
anti-floating part is positioned near an area just above the<br>
supporting parts of the white keys, although the white keys<br>
pivot while contacting the supporting parts, the moving<br>
degree of the anti-floating part relative to the white keys<br>
is considerably small.  Accordingly, resistance, like<br>
frictional force, to the pivoting of the white keys can be<br>
decreased to very small.  Also, since the anti-floating part<br>
is positioned near an area just above the supporting parts,<br>
although the white keys pivot while being restricted by the<br>
anti-floating part, the positions of the supporting parts<br>
which are an original pivoting center are maintained, and<br>
the positions of the keys in the longitudinal direction are<br>
hardly changed.  As a result, the operation of the keys are<br>
 <br>
— 7 —<br>
performed stably regardless of whether the rear portions of<br>
the keys rise or not, and operational performance of a<br>
switch related to the up/down movement of the keys is<br>
stabilized.<br>
Further, the anti-floating part is formed to have a<br>
width dimension extending over the plurality of keys.<br>
Accordingly, the process of mounting the anti-floating part<br>
to the keyboard frame and the process of adjusting the<br>
position of the anti-floating part relative to the white key<br>
supporting parts, can be performed quickly and easily with<br>
respect to the whole keys.<br>
 [0008]<br>
Moreover in accordance with another aspect of the<br>
invention, the keyboard frame supports the anti-floating<br>
parts which are positioned above the rear end portions of<br>
both the white keys and the black keys to respectively<br>
restrict the rise of the rear portions of the white keys and<br>
the rear portions of the black keys.  In a conventional<br>
keyboard device for an electronic musical instrument<br>
structured such that a driving portion is mounted near the<br>
front end of each key, because an area above the rear<br>
portions of the keys are in an opened state without<br>
arrangement of a mass body and interlocking members<br>
therewith, when a large pressing force is exerted on the<br>
front ends of the keys positioned forward from the driving<br>
 <br>
- 8 -<br>
portions, the rear portions of the keys rise and leave from<br>
the supporting parts, and the keys are unstably supported.<br>
To cope with this problem, the present invention is provided<br>
with the anti-floating parts so as to prevent the rising or<br>
floating of both the rear portions of the white and black<br>
keys and to stably support the keys.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0010]<br>
Various embodiments of the present invention will now<br>
be described in detail with reference to the accompanying<br>
 <br>
- 11 -<br>
drawings.  The same or like components will be denoted by<br>
the same reference numerals throughout the drawings, and the<br>
explanation thereof will be omitted.<br>
[0011]<br>
FIG. 1 shows schematically essential components of a<br>
keyboard device for an electronic musical instrument in<br>
accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The keyboard device is structured such that a plurality of<br>
white keys 1W, a plurality of black keys 1B, and a plurality<br>
of mass bodies 2 interlocking with the respective keys are<br>
supported by a keyboard frame 3.<br>
[0012]<br>
The rear end portions of the white keys 1W and the<br>
black keys 1B are respectively supported by supporting parts<br>
3W and 3B, so that the white keys 1W and the black keys 1B<br>
can pivot downward and upward in a vertical direction around<br>
the respective supporting parts in response to a touch<br>
pressure applied to the front end portion of the keys.  The<br>
white keys 1W and black keys 1B are respectively provided<br>
with driving portions 4W and 4B for the mass bodies at<br>
slightly retreated positions from the front ends of the keys,<br>
The supporting parts 3W and 3B are provided with pins 31W<br>
and 313 which extend upward from the keyboard frame 3.  The<br>
white keys 1W and the black keys 1B are formed with funnel-<br>
shaped holes 11W and 11B, into which the pins are inserted.<br>
 <br>
- 12 -<br>
By the holes 11W and 11B receiving the pins 31W and 31B, the<br>
keys are supported pivotably by the supporting parts.<br>
[0013]<br>
As shown in the drawing, the supporting part 3B of each<br>
black key 1B is shifted, deviated or staggered rearward from<br>
the supporting part 3W of each white key 1W.  Because the<br>
front end of the black key is located at a retreated<br>
position from the front end of the white key, the positions<br>
of the supporting parts 3B and 3W are determined from an<br>
aspect of decreasing a difference in rotation radii from key<br>
pressing points to the supporting parts between the white<br>
key and the black key To this end,it is preferred that<br>
the distance between two supporting parts is set to be 20 to<br>
10 0 % of the distance from the front end of the white key to<br>
the front end of the black key.<br>
[0014]<br>
Because the white key and the black key have the same<br>
constitution of the mass body 2, a switch 6 and a touch<br>
control sensor, the constitution of the white key will now<br>
be described, but the explanation of the constitution of the<br>
black key will be omitted.  The mass body 2 is rotatably<br>
supported by the keyboard frame 3 by a shaft 32 which is<br>
coupled to a portion near a front end of a rod 21.  The mass<br>
body 2 is connected to the driving portion 4W of the white<br>
key 1W at a front end portion 22, and is provided with a<br>
 <br>
- 13 -<br>
weight 23 at a rear end portion.  In a non-key pressing<br>
state, the weight 23 of the mass body 2 is positioned on a<br>
stopper 33 of the keyboard frame 3 by its own weight, and<br>
the front end portion 22 of the mass body 2 raises the white<br>
key 1W to an ascended position.  The driving portion 4W of<br>
the white key is formed with a hook 41W.  The uppermost<br>
ascended position of the white key is determined when the<br>
hook contacts the keyboard frame 3.  The switch 6 is mounted<br>
on the keyboard frame 3, just below the white key 1W.  When<br>
the white key 1W is pressed down, in response to the<br>
pressing, the switch 6 transmits a sound generating signal<br>
to a control unit  (not shown) to generate sound. The switch<br>
6 can be configured as various commonly-used types such as a<br>
contact type, a non-contact type, etc.  Also, in order for<br>
the keyboard device to have a touch control function, the<br>
keyboard device may further include a sensor to detect a<br>
velocity of the key and a contact pressure when pressing the<br>
key.  The switch and the sensor may be mounted on the<br>
operating position of the mass body.<br>
[0015]<br>
In this embodiment, a restriction member 7 is mounted<br>
as a stopper on the keyboard frame 3, which is provided with<br>
an anti-floating part 70 extending over the plurality of<br>
keys on the rear portions of the keys.  FIG. 2 shows the<br>
rear portions of the keys and the restriction member 7<br>
 <br>
- 14 -<br>
extracted from the keyboard device.  As shown in FIGs. 1 and<br>
2, the restriction member 7 has a function of supporting the<br>
anti-floating part 70 on the keyboard frame 3.  The keyboard<br>
frame 3 is provided with a standing wall 34 which extends in<br>
a vertical direction from the rear portion of the keyboard<br>
frame 3, and the restriction member 7 is fixed to the<br>
keyboard frame 3 by fitting vis screws 35 through coupling<br>
holes 74.  The restriction member 7 includes a vertical wall<br>
71 which extends upward from the standing wall 34, an upper<br>
wall 72 which extends forward from the top portion of the<br>
vertical wall, and the anti-floating part 70 which is formed<br>
at the front end portion of the upper wall In this<br>
embodiment, the restriction member 7 is formed as a metal<br>
plate, and the anti-floating part 70 is formed by curving<br>
the metal plate downward.  The lower end of the curved shape<br>
is positioned near the area just above the pin 31W.<br>
[0016]<br>
In the present invention, the position near the area<br>
just above the supporting part, on which the anti-floating<br>
part is positioned, means the area just above the supporting<br>
part and its nearby area, and means a range in which<br>
front/rear and up/down moving degrees, when viewing the key<br>
from above, during the pivoting of the key are small.<br>
Specifically, the above position means a range in which<br>
resistance to the pivoting of the key when the anti-floating<br>
 <br>
- 15 -<br>
part contacts the top surface of the key is small enough not<br>
to give a problem to the musical performance.  Preferably,<br>
the range is set to be -10 mm to 10 mm from the point just<br>
above the supporting part in the front/rear direction, and<br>
more preferably, -5 mm to 5 mm.<br>
[0017]<br>
The anti-floating part 70 is mounted to a position<br>
capable of restricting the rising of the rear portion of the<br>
white key 1W.  In other words, in the non-key pressing state,<br>
the anti-floating part 70 is in contact with the white key<br>
1W, or is positioned at a position approximate to the white<br>
key 1W with a small gap When the anti floating part 70 is<br>
in contact with the white key 1W, it can prevent the         <br>
generation of noise due to the contact with the anti-       <br>
floating part 70 when the rear portion of the white key 1W  <br>
is subject to rise.  Also, if exerting the down pressing   <br>
force of the anti-floating part 70 on the white key by using<br>
the elasticity of the restriction member 7, the contact    <br>
status can be mor stabiliezd.The down pressing force is    <br>
set to have a magnitude of an extent such that it does not<br>
hinder the white key's support at the ascended position by  <br>
the moment by the weight of the mass body 2 in the non-key<br>
pressing state.                                               <br>
[0018]                                                         <br>
When the anti-floating part 70 is disposed at a gap     <br>
 <br>
- 16 -<br>
from the white key 1W, it can avoid the resistance to the<br>
pivoting of the white key 1W, which may occur by the anti-<br>
floating part contacting the white key all the time.  If the<br>
gap is too small, there may happen the problem in that the<br>
anti-floating part contacts the white key in the non-key<br>
pressing state, caused by errors of dimensions of the<br>
components or mounting errors.  If the gap is too large,<br>
there may happen the problem in that the rising degree of<br>
the rear portion of the key until the rise is restricted<br>
becomes large and the key support becomes unstable.  From<br>
this point of view, the gap is preferably set to be smaller<br>
than the thickness of the white key, and more preferably,<br>
0.5 mm to 2 mm.<br>
[0019]<br>
The operation of the keyboard device according to this<br>
embodiment will now be described.  If applying the key<br>
pressing force to the front end portion of the white key 1W,<br>
which is positioned forward from the driving portion 4W, the<br>
key pressing force interacts with the reaction force applied<br>
to the driving portion 4W from the mass body 2, to generate<br>
the moment for raising the rear portion of the white key 1W.<br>
Specifically, if the key pressing force is abruptly applied<br>
to the key, the rear portion of the key is subject to rise<br>
by the moment.  However, the rising of the key is restricted<br>
by the contact with the anti-floating part 70.  Accordingly,<br>
 <br>
-17-<br>
the white key 1W can be stably supported.  Because the anti-<br>
floating part 70 is positioned near the area just above the<br>
pin 31W, although contacting the white key 1W, the moving<br>
degree at the contact point by the pivoting of the white key<br>
1W is considerably small, and as a result the resistance,<br>
like frictional force, to the pivoting is restricted to be<br>
small.<br>
[0020]<br>
As described above, because the black key 1B is<br>
configured such that the distance from the front end to the<br>
driving portion 4B is short, the problem hardly happens that<br>
the rear portion oi the -black key rises when pressing _the<br>
key.  If the top surface of the black key is positioned at<br>
the substantially same height as the top surface of the<br>
white key, the rising of the rear portion of the black key<br>
can also be prevented by the anti-floating part 70 extending<br>
on the black key 1B.  Besides, an additional anti-floating<br>
part for the black key 1B may be mounted.  In this case, it<br>
is preferable to arrange the anti-floating part for the<br>
black key identically to the arrangement such that the anti-<br>
floating part 70 is positioned near the area just above the<br>
pin 31W of the supporting part 3W of the white key 1W.<br>
[0021]<br>
FIG. 3 shows schematically essential components of a<br>
keyboard device for an electronic musical instrument in<br>
 <br>
- 18 -<br>
accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention,<br>
In the following description of this embodiment, the<br>
different points from the first embodiment will be primarily<br>
described, and the explanation of the same or like<br>
components will be omitted.  In this keyboard device, the<br>
black key 1B is shaped such that a portion 12B positioned<br>
below the anti-floating part 70 and another portion 13B<br>
extending to the portion 12B have a thin thickness.<br>
Accordingly, the top surface of the white key 1W is<br>
positioned higher than the top surface of the black key IB.<br>
FIG. 4 is a sectional view taken along line IV-IV in FIG. 3,<br>
which shows the white key lW,the black key 1B and the<br>
restriction member 7.  As shown in the drawing, the gap<br>
between the top surface of the black key 1B and the anti-<br>
floating part 70 is formed larger than the gap between the<br>
top surface of the white key 1W and the anti-floating part<br>
70.  In order to secure the difference between the gaps,<br>
this embodiment is configured to change the thickness of the<br>
black key 1B.  Therefore, it is unnecessary to make the<br>
difference between the heights of the supporting parts 3W<br>
and 3B, and thus the supporting parts can be easily formed.<br>
This embodiment has the following effects.<br>
[0022]<br>
As described above, the black key 1B can be structured<br>
such that the distance between the front end and the driving<br>
 <br>
- 19 -<br>
portion is shorter than that of the white key.  In such a<br>
structure, the moment which is generated when pressing the<br>
key and causes the rear portion of the key to rise is small,<br>
and the problem of the rising of the rear portion of the key<br>
hardly happens.  As a result, the anti-floating part can be<br>
eliminated under these circumstances.  Meanwhile, if the<br>
anti-floating part mounted for the white key is also<br>
positioned on the black key, there is a possibility that the<br>
following problems happen.  Because the anti-floating part<br>
70 is positioned near the area just above the supporting<br>
part 3W of the white key 1W, even when the white key 1W<br>
pivots upwardly on the supporting part 3W by any external <br>
force, the shocking contact with the anti-floating part<br>
70 hardly occurs.  On the other hand, the anti-floating part<br>
70 is positioned forward from the supporting part 3B of the<br>
black key 1B by the distance from the supporting part 3W of<br>
the white key 1W to the supporting part 3B.  Accordingly, if<br>
the black key 1B pivots upwardly on the supporting part 3B<br>
by any external force, the distance between the supporting<br>
part 3B to the anti-floating part 70 becomes a rotation<br>
radius, and there is a possibility that the black key 1B<br>
comes into shocking contact with the anti-floating part<br>
70.  Such contact may cause noise, and may hinder the<br>
musical performance.  To cope with the above problem, this<br>
embodiment is structured such that the top surface of the<br>
 <br>
- 20 -<br>
black key 1B is positioned lower than the top surface of the<br>
white key 1W in the area below the anti-floating part 70.<br>
Thus, although the black key pivots upwardly as described<br>
above, the collision of the black key with the anti-floating<br>
part 70 can be avoided by the large gap to the anti-floating<br>
part 70.  Accordingly, the occurrence of noise can be<br>
prevented.  Preferably, the difference in the heights<br>
between the top surface of the black key 1B and the top<br>
surface of the white key 1W is set to be 0.5 mm to 5 mm.<br>
The upper limit value of difference in the heights is<br>
sufficient to provide the avoidance of the collision due to<br>
 the typical upward-pivoting. If the difference is below the<br>
lower limit value, the avoidance of the collision cannot be<br>
achieved sufficiently.<br>
[0023]<br>
FIG. 5 shows schematically essential components of a<br>
keyboard device for an electronic musical instrument in<br>
accordance with a third embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In this embodiment, the black key 1B positioned below the<br>
anti-floating part 70 is supported by a supporting part 3B'<br>
whose supporting position is lowered.  Thus, the top surface<br>
of the white key 1W is positioned higher than the top<br>
surface of the black key 1B.  As a result, the gap between<br>
the top surface of the black key 1B and the anti-floating<br>
part 70 is formed larger than the gap between the top<br>
 <br>
- 21 -<br>
surface of the white key 1W and the anti-floating part 70.<br>
Also in this case, based on the difference between the gaps,<br>
this embodiment has the same effect as the second embodiment.<br>
Particularly, because it is unnecessary to partially change<br>
the thickness of the black key 1B, this embodiment has an<br>
advantage of manufacturing the black key in common with the<br>
white key in aspects of designing a shape or a strength of<br>
the key, using manufacturing equipment like a mold, or<br>
adopting the related components.<br>
[0024]<br>
Besides, it is also possible to combine the setting of<br>
the thickness of the black key 1B in the second embodiment<br>
with the setting of the supporting position of the<br>
supporting part in the third embodiment.<br>
[0025]<br>
FIG. 6 shows schematically essential components of a<br>
keyboard device for an electronic musical instrument in<br>
accordance with a fourth embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In this embodiment, the anti-floating part 70 is provided<br>
with an elastic body 73, and is in contact with the top<br>
surface of the white key 1W in the non-key pressing state.<br>
The elastic body 73 may be configured as a sponge foam, a<br>
fiber member such as felt, silicone rubber, gel, or the like,<br>
The elastic body 73 is attached to the lower surface of the<br>
front end portion of the upper wall 72 of the restriction<br>
 <br>
- 22 -<br>
member 7.  The elastic body 73 may be coupled to another<br>
member to be disposed to any one of the upper end portion,<br>
the middle portion, or the lower end portion of the anti-<br>
floating part.<br>
[0026]<br>
In this embodiment, because the anti-floating part 70<br>
is provided with the elastic body 73, it is easy to exert an<br>
adequate contact pressure on the white key 1W, and the<br>
position of the white key on the supporting part can be kept<br>
stably.  Also, since the elastic body compensates the errors<br>
of dimensions in the up/down direction, the requirement of<br>
the precision of dimensions of the components and the <br>
mounting is mitigated, and thus the manufacturing process<br>
and the mounting process can be performed easily.<br>
[0027]<br>
FIG. 7 shows schematically essential components of a<br>
keyboard device for an electronic musical instrument in<br>
accordance with a fifth embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In this embodiment, the anti-floating part 70 is provided<br>
with a pressure sensor 70a.  It is illustrated in the<br>
drawing that the pressure sensor 70a is mounted between an<br>
elastic body 70b and the upper wall 72.  The anti-floating<br>
part 70 is in contact with the top surface of the white key<br>
1W in the non-key pressing state.  According to the small<br>
change of the contact pressure by the pivoting of the white<br>
 <br>
- 23 -<br>
key 1W (shown by a dashed dotted line in the drawing) when<br>
pressing the key, the pressure sensor 70a generates a<br>
detecting signal.  The pressure sensor 70a may be configured<br>
as a variable resistance type pressure sensor, and can<br>
detect whether the white key 1W pivots or not and the<br>
pivoting degree.  Also, besides combining the pressure<br>
sensor 70a with the elastic body 70b, the pressure sensor<br>
70a itself may be formed in a unitary unit as a pressure<br>
sensitive sensor by a conductive rubber.<br>
[0028]<br>
FIG. 7 illustrates another pressure sensor 74 which is<br>
mounted tO the vertical wall 71 of the restriction member 7.<br>
When the anti-floating part 70 is pressed upwardly by the<br>
white key 1W, the restriction member 7 is elastically<br>
deformed from the upper wall 72 to the vertical wall 71, and<br>
the deformation degree is detected by the pressure sensor 74,<br>
The pressure sensor 74 may be configured as a strain gauge.<br>
Because the pressure sensor 74 detects the elastic<br>
deformation dergee due to the bending of the restriction<br>
member 7, the pressure sensor 74 can achieve the highly<br>
precise detection, and can successively or intermittently<br>
generate an accurate detecting signal according to the<br>
pivoting degree of the white key 1W.  The pressure sensor 74<br>
may be mounted to substitute for the aforesaid pressure<br>
sensor 70a, or may be mounted additionally to the pressure<br>
 <br>
- 24 -<br>
sensor 70a.  When the pressure sensor 74 is mounted<br>
additionally to the pressure sensor 70a, the pressure sensor<br>
70a can be allotted to detect whether the white key pivots<br>
or not, and the pressure sensor 74 can be allotted to detect<br>
the pivoting degree.  The pressure sensor 74 may be mounted<br>
to the upper wall 72.<br>
[0029]<br>
The pressure sensor 70a may be configured to extend<br>
successively together with the upper wall 72 over the<br>
plurality of keys.  In this case, the pressure sensor 70a<br>
generates a detecting signal by the pivoting of any key<br>
contacting thereto. Also, the preasure sensor 70a may be <br>
mounted independently to each key.  In this case, each<br>
pressure sensor 70a generates a detecting signal by the<br>
pivoting of the key corresponding thereto.  The pressure<br>
sensor 70a may be mounted independently to each black key 1B<br>
as well as each white key 1W.  Also, the upper wall 72, or<br>
both the upper wall 72 and the vertical wall 71, may be<br>
formed with a slit, to thereby make the anti-floating part<br>
70 perform independently the response operation to the<br>
pivoting of each key.<br>
[0030]<br>
The pressure sensor 74 may also be configured to extend<br>
successively over the plurality of keys, or to be mounted<br>
independently to each key, identically to the above<br>
 <br>
- 25 -<br>
description.  Even when one pressure sensor 74 is mounted to<br>
the restriction member 7 which extends successively over the<br>
plurality of keys, if the restriction member 7 is<br>
elastically deformed by the pivoting of any key, the<br>
pressure sensor 74 can generate a detecting signal, thereby<br>
simplifying the structure.<br>
[0031]<br>
As described above, by the pressure sensors 70a and 74<br>
detecting whether the key pivots or not and the pivoting<br>
degree, the detecting signal can be used for the on/off<br>
control of the sound production and the after-touch control.<br>
[0032]<br>
FIG. 8 shows schematically essential components of a<br>
keyboard device for an electronic musical instrument in<br>
accordance with a sixth embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In this embodiment, the anti-floating part 70 is provided<br>
with a non-contact type proximity sensor 75.  The proximity<br>
sensor 75 generates a detecting signal according to even a<br>
small change of a gap with the top surface of the white key<br>
by the pivoting of the white key 1W (shown by a dashed<br>
dotted line in the drawing) when pressing the key.<br>
Accordingly, the proximity sensor 75 is not needed to<br>
contact the top surface of the white key, and thus the white<br>
key can pivot without receiving resistance like frictional<br>
force due to the contact.  The proximity sensor 75 may be<br>
 <br>
- 26 -<br>
configured as an electronic inductive sensor, an<br>
electrostatic capacity sensor, a photoreflector, or the like,<br>
which can detect whether the white key 1W pivots or not and<br>
the pivoting degree.  Whether to successively extend the<br>
anti-floating part 70 over the plurality of keys or<br>
independently mount the anti-floating part 70 to each key<br>
can be determined from the identical aspect to the pressure<br>
sensor 70a as described above.<br>
[0033]<br>
The present invention is not restricted to the above<br>
embodiments, and can be variously modified.  In substitute<br>
for the structure in which the pins are supported by the.<br>
keyboard frame as illustrated in the drawings, the<br>
supporting parts of the white keys and the black keys may be<br>
modified such that the pins are supported by the keys and<br>
the keyboard frame is provided with receiving portions for<br>
receiving the pins.  The supporting parts can also be<br>
modified into other supporting structures that can pivotably<br>
support the keys.<br>
[0034]<br>
FIG. 9 shows schematically essential components of a<br>
keyboard device for an electronic musical instrument in<br>
accordance with a seventh embodiment of the present<br>
invention.  The keyboard device is structured such that a<br>
plurality of white keys 1W, a plurality of black keys 1B,<br>
 <br>
- 27 -<br>
and a plurality of mass bodies 2 interlocking with the<br>
respective keys are supported by a keyboard frame 3.<br>
[0035]<br>
The rear end portions of the white keys 1W and the<br>
black keys 1B are respectively supported by supporting parts<br>
3W and 3B, so that the white keys 1W and the black keys 1B<br>
can pivot in a vertical direction.  The white keys 1W and<br>
black keys 1B are respectively provided with driving<br>
portions 4W and 4B for the mass bodies at slightly retreated<br>
positions from the front ends of the keys.  The supporting<br>
parts 3W and 3B are provided with pins 31W and 31B which<br>
extend upward from the keyboard frame 3, The white keys 1W<br>
and the black keys 1B are formed with funnel-shaped holes<br>
11W and 11B, into which the pins are inserted.  By the holes<br>
11W and 11B receiving the pins 31W and 31B, the keys are<br>
supported by the supporting parts.<br>
[0036]<br>
As shown in the drawing, the supporting part 3B of each<br>
black key 1B is positioned rearward from the supporting part<br>
3W of each white key 1W.  Because the front end of the black<br>
key is located at a retreated position from the front end of<br>
the white key, the positions of the supporting parts 3B and<br>
3W are determined from aspects of decreasing a difference in<br>
rotation radii from key pressing points to the supporting<br>
parts between the white key and the black key and decreasing<br>
 <br>
- 28 -<br>
a difference in touch feelings between the white key and the<br>
black key.  To this end, it is preferred that the distance<br>
between two supporting parts is set to be 20 to 200 % of the<br>
distance from the front end of the white key to the front<br>
end of the black key.  If the distance is less than 20 %,<br>
the difference in rotation radii between the black key and<br>
the white key becomes large, and the difference in touch<br>
feelings between the white key and the black key cannot be<br>
decreased.  Also, if the distance is more than 200 %, the<br>
black key is extended rearward so excessively that the<br>
dimension of the keyboard device in the front/rear direction<br>
becomes large.<br>
[0037]<br>
Because the white key and the black key have the same<br>
constitution of the mass body 2, a switch 6 and a touch<br>
control sensor, the constitution of the white key will now<br>
be described, but the explanation of the constitution of the<br>
black key will be omitted.  The mass body 2 is rotatably<br>
supported by the keyboard frame 3 by a shaft 32 which is<br>
coupled to a portion near a front end of a rod 21.  The mass<br>
body 2 is connected to the driving portion 4W of the white<br>
key 1W at a front end portion 22, and is provided with a<br>
weight 23 at a rear end portion.  In a non-key pressing<br>
state, the weight 23 of the mass body 2 is positioned on a<br>
stopper 33 of the keyboard frame 3 by its own weight, and<br>
 <br>
- 29 -<br>
the front end portion 22 of the mass body 2 raises the white<br>
key 1W to an ascended position.  The driving portion 4W of<br>
the white key is formed with a hook 41W.  The uppermost<br>
ascended position of the white key is determined when the<br>
hook contacts the keyboard frame 3.  The switch 6 is mounted<br>
on the keyboard frame 3, just below the white key 1W.  When<br>
the white key 1W is pressed down, in response to the<br>
pressing, the switch 6 transmits a sound generating signal<br>
to a control unit (not shown) to generate sound.  The switch<br>
6 can be configured as various commonly-used types such as a<br>
contact type, a non-contact type, etc.  Also, in order for<br>
the keyboard device to have a touch control function, the<br>
keyboard device may further include a sensor to detect a<br>
velocity of the key and a contact pressure when pressing the<br>
key.  The switch and the sensor may be mounted on the<br>
operating position of the mass body.<br>
[0038]<br>
In this embodiment, a white key restriction member 7W<br>
is mounted near the rear portion of the white key 1W, and a<br>
black key restriction member 7B is mounted near the rear<br>
portion of the black key 1B.  FIG. 10 is a plan view showing<br>
the rear portions of the keys and the restriction members 7W<br>
and 7B, and FIG. 11 is an enlarged view of a region near the<br>
rear portions of the keys depicted in FIG. 9.  The<br>
restriction members 7W and 7B are mounted to the rear<br>
 <br>
- 30 -<br>
portion of the keyboard frame 3 in such a manner that lower<br>
end portions 71W and 71B of the restriction members 7W and<br>
7B are fixed to a horizontal wall 34 of the keyboard frame 3<br>
by using vis screws 35.  The respective restriction members<br>
7W and 7B include vertical walls 72W and 72B which extend<br>
upward from the lower end portions 71W and 71B, upper walls<br>
7 3W and 73B which extend forward from the upper end portions<br>
of the vertical walls, and anti-floating parts 70W and 70B<br>
which are mounted to the front end portions of the upper<br>
walls.  In this embodiment, the restriction members 7W and<br>
7B are formed as metal plates, and the anti-floating parts<br>
7GW and 70B are formed by curving the metal plates downward.<br>
[0039]<br>
The anti-floating parts 70W and 70B are mounted to<br>
positions capable of restricting the rising of the rear<br>
portions of the white key 1W and the black key 1B.  In other<br>
words, in the non-key pressing state, the anti-floating<br>
parts are in contact with the white key and the black key,<br>
or are positioned at positions approximate to the keys with<br>
a small gap.  When the anti-floating parts are in contact<br>
with the keys, it can be securely prevented the generation<br>
of noise due to the contact with the anti-floating parts<br>
when the rear portions of the keys are subject to rise.<br>
Also, if exerting the downward pressing force of the anti-<br>
floating parts on the keys by using the elasticity of the<br>
 <br>
- 31 -<br>
restriction members 7W and 7B, the contact status can be<br>
more stabilized.  The downward pressing force is set to have<br>
a magnitude of an extent such that it does not hinder each<br>
key's support at the ascended position by the moment by the<br>
weight of the mass body 2 in the non-key pressing state.<br>
[0040]<br>
When each anti-floating part is disposed approximately<br>
to each key at a small gap, it can avoid the resistance to<br>
the pivoting of the key, which may occur by the anti-<br>
floating part contacting the key all the time.  If the gap<br>
is too small, there may happen the problem in that the anti-<br>
float ing  part contacts the key in the non key pressing state,<br>
caused by errors of dimensions of the components or mounting<br>
errors.  If the gap is too large, there may happen the<br>
problem in that the rising degree of the rear portion of the<br>
key until the rise is restricted becomes large and the key<br>
support becomes unstable.  From this point of view, the gap<br>
is preferably set to be smaller than the thickness of the<br>
white key, and more preferably, 0.5 mm to 2 mm.<br>
[0041]<br>
The arrangement of contacting the anti-floating part to<br>
the top surface of the key or disposing the anti-floating<br>
part approximately to the top surface of the key is applied<br>
to the embodiments which will be described hereinafter.<br>
[0042]<br>
 <br>
- 32 -<br>
The anti-floating parts 70W and 70B are positioned such<br>
that contact center points with the top surfaces of the keys<br>
(lower ends of the curved shape in the drawings) are<br>
positioned respectively at distances Dw and Db from points<br>
just above the supporting parts 3W and 3B (pins 31W and 31B)<br>
The distances Dw and Db are determined so that the<br>
restriction members 7W and 7B are positioned rearward from<br>
the visible portions of the keys (portions seen from the<br>
front of the instrument).  If the distances Dw and Db are<br>
too large, the distance from the supporting part to the<br>
anti-floating part becomes a rotation radius, and there is a<br>
possibility that the key comes into shocking contact with<br>
the anti-floating part.  Accordingly, when the front<br>
direction from the supporting parts 3W and 3B is defined as<br>
"+" and the rear direction from the supporting parts 3W and<br>
3B is defined as "-", the distances Dw and Db are preferably<br>
set to be -30 mm to +30mm, and more preferably, -5 mm to<br>
+5mm.  Also, if the rear ends of the keys are shorter than<br>
the aforesaid lower limit dimension, the lower limits of the<br>
distances Dw and Db fall on the rear ends of the keys.<br>
[0043]<br>
The distances Dw and Db are almost equal to each other,<br>
such that a difference between the distances is preferably<br>
within 10 mm.<br>
[00441<br>
 <br>
- 33 -<br>
Like this, by providing a common feature to the<br>
distances Dw and Db, the operation of the white keys and the<br>
black keys can be made uniform, which will be described in<br>
detail later.  Contrarily to the above structure, FIG. 12<br>
shows an example structured such that an anti-floating part<br>
70' is mounted to the keyboard frame 3 at the same distance<br>
Lc from the rear end of the keyboard frame 3 with respect to<br>
the white key 1W and the black key 1B.  The operation of the<br>
white key 1W and the operation of the black key 1B in this<br>
structure when pressing the keys are respectively<br>
illustrated in FIG. 13 (a) and FIG. 13(b) .  If the large key<br>
pressing farce F is applied, the reaction force of  inertia R<br>
by the key and the mass body becomes also large, and a<br>
couple of forces are generated at the key to pivot the same<br>
to the left on the drawing.  This causes the rising of the<br>
rear end of the key.  The rising is restricted by the rear<br>
end of the key contacting the anti-floating part 70'.  In<br>
this case, because a distance Db' from the black key<br>
supporting part 3B to the anti-floating part 70' is larger<br>
than a distance Dw' from the white key supporting part 3W to<br>
the anti-floating part 70', a rising degree Ub of the black<br>
key from the supporting part becomes obviously larger than a<br>
rising degree Uw of the white key from the supporting part.<br>
The difference in operation between the black key and the<br>
white key has an influence on the operation of the switch 6<br>
 <br>
- 34 -<br>
and the noise generation due to the collision with the<br>
supporting parts, and as a result causes ununiformity of<br>
basic features of the keyboard.<br>
[0045]<br>
As described above, in the seventh embodiment<br>
illustrated in FIGs. 9 to 11 although the large key pressing<br>
force is applied and the rear portions of the keys rise, the<br>
anti-floating parts 70W and 70B can restrict the rising of<br>
the keys at the positions at the same distance from the<br>
supporting parts 3W and 3B.  As a result, the rising degrees<br>
from the supporting parts 3W and 3B are almost same, and the<br>
operational performance of the switch 6 is made uniform.In<br>
order to prevent the noise due to the rising, a measure of<br>
providing a soft member may be adopted.  However, because to<br>
stop the operation of the key softly may have a bad<br>
influence by making it ambiguous to perceive a boundary<br>
condition forming the sound generating state and the touch<br>
feeling, the setting of the softness must be performed very<br>
cautiously.  In relation to this, by adopting the aforesaid<br>
anti-floating parts, the rising degrees of the white key 1W<br>
and the black key 1B from the supporting parts 3W and 3B are<br>
almost equal to each other, and thus the noise prevention<br>
can be achieved accurately and effectively.<br>
[0046]<br>
If the distances Dw and Db are set to zero or a value<br>
 <br>
- 35 -<br>
approximate to zero, the anti-floating parts are<br>
respectively positioned at an area or near an area just<br>
above the white key supporting part and the black key<br>
supporting part.  In this state, although the keys pivot<br>
while being restricted by the anti-floating parts, the<br>
positions of the supporting parts which are original<br>
pivoting centers and the keys in the longitudinal direction<br>
are hardly changed.  As a result, the operation of the keys<br>
are performed stably regardless of whether the rear portions<br>
of the keys rise or not, and operational performance of the<br>
switch 6 related to the up/down movement of the keys is<br>
-stabilized.  The above-described setting of the distances Dw<br>
and Db can also be applied to the respective following<br>
embodiments.<br>
[0047]<br>
FIGs. 14 and 15 show schematically essential components<br>
of a keyboard device for an electronic musical instrument in<br>
accordance with an eighth embodiment of the present<br>
invention.  Particularly, FIG. 14 is a longitudinal-<br>
sectional view of the essential components of the keyboard<br>
device, and FIG. 15 is a plan view of the essential<br>
components of the keyboard device, in which a section taken<br>
along line VI-VI is shown in FIG. 14.  In the following<br>
description of this embodiment, the different features from<br>
the seventh embodiment will be primarily explained, and the<br>
 <br>
- 36 -<br>
explanation of the same or like parts will be omitted.<br>
[0048]<br>
In the keyboard device of this embodiment, the anti-<br>
floating parts are mounted to the restriction member 7 which<br>
extends over the plurality of keys including the white keys<br>
and the black keys.  In other words, the restriction member<br>
7 extends lengthwise in the key arranging direction, and is<br>
mounted to the rear portion of the keyboard frame 3 in such<br>
a manner that a lower end portion 71 of the restriction<br>
member 7 is fixed to a horizontal wall 34 of the keyboard<br>
frame 3 by using vis screws 35.  The restriction member 7<br>
includes avertical wall 72 which extends upward from the<br>
lower end portion 71, and an upper wall 73 which extends<br>
forward from the upper end portion of the vertical wall.<br>
The restriction member 7 is formed as a metal plate.  The<br>
anti-floating parts 70Wa and 70Ba are formed by deforming<br>
the metal plate in a downward concave shape, and the lower<br>
ends of the curved shape are positioned respectively at<br>
distances Dw and Db from points just above the supporting<br>
parts 3W and 3B (pins 31W and 31B).  The setting of the<br>
distances Dw and Db and its operational effect which have<br>
been explained with reference to the seventh embodiment can<br>
also be applied to this embodiment and other embodiments<br>
which will be described later.<br>
[0049]<br>
 <br>
- 37 -<br>
The keyboard has sections in which two white keys are<br>
consecutively arranged.  An anti-floating part 70Wa'<br>
positioned in this section can be formed in a concave shape<br>
which covers two keys.  Also, because the anti-floating part<br>
of the black key 1B is positioned rearward from the anti-<br>
floating part of the white key 1W, although it is provided<br>
with an anti-floating part 70Ba' which extends in the key<br>
arranging direction in a concave shape to cover the<br>
plurality of keys, as shown by a dashed dotted line in the<br>
drawing, the anti-floating part 70Ba' does not interfere<br>
with the anti-floating part 70Wa of the white key 1W.<br>
 [0050]<br>
According to this structure, because a plurality of<br>
anti-floating parts are formed at one restriction member 7,<br>
the mounting process to the keyboard frame and the position<br>
adjusting process with respect to the keys can be performed<br>
rapidly and easily.<br>
[0051]<br>
FIG. 16 shows schematically essential components of a<br>
keyboard device for an electronic musical instrument in<br>
accordance with a ninth embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In this embodiment, the restriction member 7 extends over<br>
the plurality of white keys and black keys, identically to<br>
the eighth embodiment shown in FIGs. 14 and 15, and an anti-<br>
floating part 7 0Wb of the white key and an anti-floating<br>
 <br>
- 38 -<br>
part 70Bb of the black key are mounted to the upper wall 73<br>
of the restriction member 7.  In other words, this<br>
embodiment is structured such that the anti-floating parts<br>
70Wa, 70Wa' and 70Ba of the eighth embodiment are<br>
substituted by the anti-floating parts 70Wb and 70Bb.  Each<br>
of the anti-floating parts 70Wb and 70Bb includes an elastic<br>
body 701 whose upper end is fixed to the upper wall 73, and<br>
a contact piece 702 which is fixed to the lower end of the<br>
elastic body 701.  The elastic body 701 may be configured as<br>
a spring, such as a coil spring or a plate spring, a sponge<br>
foam, or the like.  By such an elastic body provided at the<br>
anti-floating part, when the rear end portion of the key<br>
rises, a downward pressing force to press down the rear end<br>
portion of the key correspondingly to the rising degree can<br>
be obtained.  Accordingly, the restricting operation is<br>
stably achieved.<br>
[0052]<br>
In order to acquire the above operational effect, it is<br>
structured such that the anti-floating part and the key<br>
contact each other with elasticity.  The elastic body may be<br>
mounted to any one of the upper end portion, the middle<br>
portion, or the lower end portion of the anti-floating part.<br>
When the elastic body is mounted to the lower end portion of<br>
the anti-floating part, the contact piece 702 can be<br>
eliminated.  Alternatively, the elastic body may be mounted<br>
 <br>
- 39 -<br>
on the top surface of the key, in substitute for or in<br>
addition to the anti-floating part.<br>
FIG. 17 shows schematically essential components of a<br>
keyboard device for an electronic musical instrument in<br>
accordance with a tenth embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In this embodiment, an upper wall 73a of the restriction<br>
member 7 is formed as an elastic piece.  The restriction<br>
member 7 extends over the plurality of white keys and black<br>
keys, identically to the eighth embodiment shown in FIGs. 14<br>
and 15, and the upper wall 73a is mounted to the vertical<br>
wall 72 extending upward from the lower end portion 71 by<br>
using vis screws 74, so as to have spring characteristics.<br>
The upper wall 73a is provided with anti-floating parts 70Wc<br>
and 70Bc at the positions corresponding to the white key and<br>
the black key.  By this structure, the upper wall 73a biases<br>
the anti-floating parts 70Wc and 70Bc respectively to the<br>
white key and the black key.  According to the intensity of<br>
the elasticity of the upper wall 73, the anti-floating parts<br>
70Wc and 70Bc has elasticity or softness, or does not.  When<br>
having the elasticity or the softness, the elastic body or<br>
soft body may be configured as a sponge foam, a fiber member<br>
such as felt, silicone rubber, gel, or the like, and are<br>
attached to the lower surface of the front end portion of<br>
the upper wall 72 of the restriction member 7.  The elastic<br>
body may be coupled to another member to be disposed to any<br>
 <br>
- 40 -<br>
one of the upper end portion, the middle portion, or the<br>
lower end portion of the anti-floating part.<br>
[0053]<br>
Also in this embodiment, by the structure that the<br>
anti-floating part and the key contact each other with<br>
elasticity, when the rear end portion of the key rises, a<br>
downward pressing force to press down the rear end portion<br>
of the key correspondingly to the rising degree can be<br>
obtained, and thus the restricting operation is stably<br>
achieved.<br>
[0054]<br>
FIG. 18 shows schematica1ly essential components of a<br>
keyboard device for an electronic musical instrument in<br>
accordance with an eleventh embodiment of the present<br>
invention.  In this embodiment, rear end portions 11W and<br>
11B of the keys opposing anti-floating parts 70Wd and 70Bd<br>
are formed in circular arc shapes which have radii Rw and Rb<br>
centering on the centers of the pivoting by the supporting<br>
parts 3W and 3B, when viewing the side surfaces of the keys<br>
(viewing in the key arranging direction).  The restriction<br>
member 7 extends over the plurality of white keys and black<br>
keys, identically to the eighth embodiment shown in FIGs. 14<br>
and 15, and the anti-floating parts 70Wd and 70Bd are<br>
mounted to the positions corresponding to the white key and<br>
the black key, at small gaps from the rear end portions 11W<br>
 <br>
- 41 -<br>
and 11B of the keys.<br>
[0055]<br>
Because the rear end portions 11W and 11B of the keys<br>
are formed in the circular arc shapes, regardless of the<br>
pivoting degree of the key (descending degree of the front<br>
end portion of the key), the gaps between the rear end<br>
portions 11W and 11B of the keys and the anti-floating parts<br>
70Wd and 70Bd are maintained constantly.  Accordingly, the<br>
status that the rear end portions 11W and 11B of the keys<br>
are restricted by the anti-floating parts 70Wd and 70Bd by<br>
contacting them when the rear portions of the keys rise, is<br>
made uniform, regardless of the pivoting degree of the key.<br>
As a result, the rising degrees from the supporting parts 3W<br>
and 3B are almost the same, and the operational performance<br>
of the switch 6 related to the vertical position of the key<br>
is made uniform.  Also when adopting a measure of providing<br>
a soft member to prevent the noise due to the rising, the<br>
setting about the soft member can be achieved accurately and<br>
effectively.<br>
[0056]<br>
FIG. 19 shows schematically essential components of a<br>
keyboard device for an electronic musical instrument in<br>
accordance with a twelfth embodiment of the present<br>
invention.  This embodiment is structured such that the<br>
forming into the circular arc shape in the eleventh<br>
 <br>
- 42 -<br>
embodiment is applied to the anti-floating parts.  The lower<br>
surfaces of the anti-floating parts 70We and 70Be are formed<br>
in circular arc shapes which have radii Rw' and Rb'<br>
centering on the centers of the pivoting by the supporting<br>
parts 3W and 3B, when viewing the side surfaces of the keys.<br>
Rear end portions 12W and 12B of the keys opposing the anti-<br>
floating parts 70We and 70Be are formed in convex shapes,<br>
each having an angle portion on the top surface to point-<br>
contact the lower surface of each anti-floating part, when<br>
viewing the side surfaces of the keys.<br>
[0057]<br>
Similarly to the eleventh embodiment,because the lower<br>
surfaces of the anti-floating parts 70We and 70Be are formed<br>
in the circular arc shapes, regardless of the pivoting<br>
degree of the key, the gaps between the rear end portions<br>
12W and 12B of the keys and the anti-floating parts 70We and<br>
7 0Be are maintained constantly, and the status that the rear<br>
end portions 12W and 12B of the keys are restricted by the<br>
anti-floating parts 70we and 70Be by contacting them, is<br>
made uniform.  As a result, the operational performance of<br>
the switch 6 related to the vertical position of the key is<br>
made uniform, and the setting for preventing the noise due<br>
to the rising can be achieved accurately and effectively.<br>
[0058]<br>
In order to obtain the effects by the circular arc-<br>
 <br>
- 43 -<br>
shaped parts, as described in the fifth and twelfth<br>
embodiments, at least one of the anti-floating part and the<br>
key in the contact area therebetween is formed in a circular<br>
arc shape centering on the supporting part.  Accordingly,<br>
both the anti-floating part and the key may be formed in the<br>
complementary circular arc shapes, i.e., the convex and<br>
concave shapes of the fifth and twelfth embodiments, to<br>
contact each other when the rear portion of the key rises.<br>
[0059]<br>
As shown in FIG. 20, the circular arc-shaped contact<br>
structure can be modified into a structure that a contact<br>
member 13 is slidably inserted into a receiving hole 15<br>
formed at the rear end portion of the key 1, and an elastic<br>
body 14 is provided between the bottom of the receiving hole<br>
and the contact member 13 to bias the contact member 13 in<br>
the protruding direction.  The elastic body 14 may be<br>
configured as a spring, a sponge foam, or the like.  A<br>
contact portion of the contact member 13 to the anti-<br>
floating part 70 is formed in a circular arc shape having a<br>
radius R centering on the center of the pivot by the<br>
supporting part 3.  In the non-key pressing state, the<br>
contact member 13 is in contact with the anti-floating part<br>
70.  The contact status and the restriction receiving status<br>
in pressing the key are made uniform regardless of the<br>
pivoting degree of the key.  As a result, the operational<br>
 <br>
- 44 -<br>
performance of the switch 6 related to the vertical position<br>
of the key is made uniform, and the setting for preventing<br>
the noise due to the rising can be achieved accurately and<br>
effectively.<br>
[0060]<br>
This embodiment is structured such that the anti-<br>
floating part 70 is formed by the upper wall 73 of the<br>
restriction member 7, however it can be modified to have<br>
other types of anti-floating parts illustrated in the<br>
previous embodiments.  The structure of the slidably-mounted<br>
contact part and the elastic body can be mounted to the<br>
 anti-floating part.<br>
[0061]<br>
The present invention is not limited to the above<br>
embodiments, and can be variously modified.  In substitute<br>
for the structure in which the pins are supported by the<br>
keyboard frame as illustrated in the drawings, the<br>
supporting parts of the white keys and the black keys may be<br>
modified such that the pins are supported by the keys and<br>
the keyboard frame is provided with receiving portions for<br>
receiving the pins.  The supporting parts can also be<br>
modified into other supporting structures that can pivotably<br>
support the keys.  The anti-floating parts of the respective<br>
embodiments can be mounted to the restriction members<br>
arranged for each white key and each black key as shown in<br>
 <br>
- 45 -<br>
FIGs. 9 to 11, or can be mounted to the restriction members<br>
extending over the plurality of keys as shown in FIGs. 14<br>
and 15.<br>
