COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10, Rule 13] "A PROCESS FOR PREPARING SUBSTITUTED INDOLES"<br>
PFIZER PRODUCTS INC., a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Connecticut, United States of America, of Eastern Point Road, Groton, Connecticut 06340, United States of America,<br>
GRANTED<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br>
6-1-2005             ORIGINAL<br>
                                            954/MUMNP/2003<br><br>
The present invention relates to  a process for preparing substituted indoles.<br>
Field of the Invention This  invention  relates to  triamide-substituted  heterobicyclic  compounds.  These compounds   are   inhibitors   of   microsomal   triglyceride   transfer   protein   (MTP)   and/or apolipoprotein B (Apo B) secretion and are useful for the treatment of obesity and related diseases.   These  compounds   are  also   useful  for  the  prevention   and  treatment   of atherosclerosis and its clinical sequelae, for lowering serum lipids, and in the prevention and treatment of related diseases. The invention further relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds^and to methods of treating obesity, atherosclerosis, and related diseases and/or conditions with said compounds, either alone or in combination with other medicaments, including lipid lowering agents. Further still, the invention relates to certain processes and intermediates related thereto which are useful in the preparation of the compounds of the instant invention.<br>
Background of the Invention Microsomal  triglyceride  transfer  protein catalyzes  the  transport of  triglyceride, cholesteryl ester, and phospholipids and has been implicated as a putative mediator in the assembly of Apo B-containing lipoproteins, biomolecules which contribute to the formation of atherosclerotic lesions. Specifically, the subcellular (lumen of the microsomal fraction) and tissue distribution (liver and intestine) of MTP have led to speculation that it plays a role in the assembly of plasma lipoproteins, as these are the sites of plasma lipoprotein assembly. The ability of MTP to catalyze the transport of triglyceride between membranes is consistent with this speculation, and suggests that MTP may catalyze the transport of triglyceride from its site of synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane to nascent lipoprotein particles within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum.<br>
Accordingly, compounds which inhibit MTP and/or otherwise inhibit Apo B secretion are useful in the treatment of atherosclerosis and other conditions related thereto. Such compounds are also useful in the treatment of other diseases or conditions in which, by inhibiting MTP and/or Apo B secretion, serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels may be reduced.     Such     conditions     may     include,     for     example,     hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia,       pancreatitis,       and       obesity;       and       hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and hyperlipidemia associated with pancreatitis, obesity, and diabetes. For a detailed discussion, see for example, Wetterau et al., Science, 258, 999-1001, (1992), Wetterau et al., Biochem. Biophys, Acta., 875, 610-617 (1986), European patent application publication Nos. 0 584 446 A2, and 0 643 057 A1. the latter of which refers to certain compounds which have utility as inhibitors of MTP. Other examples of MTP inhibitors may be found in e.g.,   U.S. Patent Numbers  5,712,279,  5,741,804,  5,968,950,  6,066,653,  and 6,121,283; PCT International Patent Application publications WO 96/40640, WO 97/43257, WO   98/27979,   WO   99/33800   and   WO   00/05201;   and   European   patent   application publications EP 584446 and EP 643,057.<br><br>

In another preferred embodiment, the suitable solvent is dichloromethane. In a preferred embodiment, the mixture of C|, the amine HNR6R7, HOBt and carbodiimide is stirred for about 30 minutes to 24 hours before further processing. In an 10      embodiment, the further processing comprises an aqueous work-up to provide the compound of formula C. In a preferred embodiment, the amine HNR6R7 is N-methylbenzylamine, i.e., R6 is methyl and R7 is benzyl. In another preferred embodiment, Rp is BOC and the amine is N-methylbenzylamine, and in a more preferred embodiment thereof, the resulting compound of formula C, (tert-butyl (RS)-2-[benzyl(methyl)amino}-2-oxo-1-phenylethylcarbamate is treated 15     with trifiuorocaetic acid and triethylsiiane in dichloromethane, followed by aqueous workup to yield (RS)-N-benzyl-N-methyl-2-phenylglycinamide. In a particularly preferred embodiment, Rp is BOC and the amine is /V-methylbenzylamine, and in a more preferred embodiment thereof, the resulting optically enriched compound of formula C, (tert-butyl (S)-2-[benzyl(methyl)amino]-2-oxo-1-phenytethylcarbamate), is treated with concentrated 20      hydrochloric acid in propan-2-ol, followed by advantageous precipitation of (S)-N"-benzyl-N-methyl-2-phenylglycinamide hydrochloride monohydrate from mixtures of propan-2-ol and tert-butyl methyl ether, resulting in a useful increase in the degree of optical enrichment.<br>
A salt of the phenylglycine amide may be prepared, e.g., by treating the amide, e.g., (RS)-N-benzyl-N-methyl-2-phenylglycinamide, with di(o-toluoyl)-L-tartaric acid in a suitable 25      solvent, e.g. ethyl acetate, to provide the di(o-toluoyl)-L-tartrate) salt, e.g. (RS)-N-benzyl-N methyl-2-phenylglycinamide. Tartrate salts of the phenylglycine amides may be broken to provide the amide, which may be purified as its hydrochloride salt.<br>
In another embodiment, racemic compounds of the formula C may be resolved via the selective precipitation of one of the enatiomers as its salt with an optically enriched chiral acid, 30     of which many examples are known in the art, from suitable solvents, e.g. methanol and ethanol. Such optically enriched chiral acids may be naturally occuring or synthetic. The precipitated salts may be hydrates or solvates.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, (RS)-N-benzyl-N-methyl-2-phenylglycinamide is treated<br><br><br>
WO 03/002533<br><br>
PCT/IB02/01876<br><br>
with di{o-toluoyl)-L-tartaric acid in methanol at 20°C. The precipitated salt is filtered and washed with methanol, then dried providing (S)-A/-benzyl-/V-rnethyl-2-phenylglycinamide di(o-toluoyl)-L-tartrate with 92.7% d.e. (chiral HPLC). This material is reslurried in hot methanol, filtered, washed and dried to providing (S)-A/-benzyi-A/-methyl-2-phenylglycinamide di(o-5      toluoyl)-L-tartrate with 99% d.e. (37% overall yield).<br>
The diastereomericly enriched salts formed as described in the previous embodiments may be broken to provide optically enriched free amines C e.g. (S)-N-benzyl-N-methyl-2-phenylglycinamide, which may be advantageously purified by crystallization as-is or by the formation of a salt with an achiral acid in the presence of suitable solvents, e.g. 10      precipitation of (S)-N-benzyl-/V-methyl-2-phenylglycinamide hydrochloride from mixtures of propan-2-ol and tert-butyl methyl ether.<br>
In another embodiment, a racemic compound of the formula C may be resolved via the selective recrystallization of its salt with an optically enriched chiral acid, e.g. (RS)-N-benzyl-N-metriyi-2-phenylglycinamide di(o-toluoyl)-L-tartrate prepared as described above, 15      from a suitable solvent, to provide diastereomericly enriched salts, e.g. (S)-N-benzyl-N-methyl-2-phenylglycinamide di(o-toluoyl)-L-tartrate. Breakage of these salts delivers optically enriched free amines of the formula C, which may be advantageously isolated and used as the hydrochloride salt, e.g. (S)-N-benzyl-N-methyl-2-phenylglycinamide hydrochloride.<br>
In another embodiment, where optically enriched compunds C are preferred, the 20      unwanted enantiomer of the compound C may be recycled by racemization. In a more preferable embodiment, the racemization is applied to mother liquors from the resolutions described above by refluxing in the presence of a catalytic amount of a carbonyl compound, e.g. 2-chlorobenzaldehyde, thus allowing the isolation of second crops of diastereomerically enriched salts containing the desired enatiomer of compound C, e.g. (S)-N-benzyl-N-methyl-2-25      phenylglycinamide di(o-toluoyl)-L-tartrate with 92% d.e. in approximately 50% yield of the solute in the initial ethanolic mother liquors. In a still more preferred embodiment, the catalysed racemization is performed at a suitable temperature and concentration in-situ during the resoluton in a suitable solvent, prior to the isolation of the first crop of product; this "dynamic resolution" allows a first crop yield of product to be significantly greater than the 50% 30      available by traditional salt resolutions. Dynamic resoultions are known in the art, but are considered far from trivial and highly substrate dependant.<br>
In still another embodiment of a process for preparing an opticaly enriched compound of formula C, a homochira! amino acid, e.g. (S)-L-2-phenylglycine, is converted to the corresponding N-carboxyanhydride, e.g. (SH-pheny!-1,3-oxazolidine-2,5-dione, using 35 methods well known in the art, which, may then be combined an amine, e.g. N-methylbenzylamine. The resulting mixture is then subjected to an aqueous work-up, providing the optically enriched aminoamide, e.g. (S)-A/-benzyl-N-methyl-2-phenylglycinamide, which may be purified as-is or as a suitable salt.<br><br><br>

The terms "compound(s) of formula 1", "compound(s) of formula lb", "compound(s) of formula 2", etc. include a compound of formula 1 (or lb or 2, respectively) as defined herein and all of the embodiments, preferred embodiments, more preferred embodiments, and particularly preferred embodiments of such compounds, including the compounds named or 15      exemplified herein, each of which is a particularly preferred embodiment of the compounds defined by the formulas. Reference to "a compound of the invention" is meant to encompass any of the compounds of formula 1, formula lb or formula 2 as those terms are defined above.

The preparation of such salts is described below.<br>
The compounds of the invention that are basic in nature are capable of forming a wide variety of salts with various inorganic and organic acids. The acids that may be used to prepare pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of such basic compounds of the invention are those that form non-toxic acid addition salts, i.e., salts containing pharmacologically acceptable anions, such as the hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, nitrate, sulfate, bisulfate, phosphate, acid phosphate, isonicotinate, acetate, lactate, salicylate, citrate, acid citrate, tartrate, pantothenate, bitartrate, ascorbate, succinate, maleate, gentisinate, fumarate, gluconate, glucaronate, saccharate, formate, benzoate, glutamate, methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate and pamoate (i.e., 1,1'-methylene-bis-(2-hydroxy-3-naphthoate)) salts.<br>
The compounds of the invention that are acidic in nature, are capable of forming base salts with various pharmacologically acceptable cations. Examples of such salts include the alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salts and particularly, the sodium and potassium salts. This invention also encompasses pharmaceutical compositions containing, and methods of treating proliferative disorders or abnormal cell growth through administering, prodrugs of compounds of the invention. Compounds of the invention having free amino, amido, hydroxy or carboxylic groups can be converted into prodrugs. Prodrugs include compounds wherein an amino acid residue, or a polypeptide chain of two or more (e.g., two, three or four) amino acid residues is covalently joined through an amide or ester bond to a free amino, hydroxy or carboxylic acid group of compounds of the invention. The amino acid residues include but are not limited to the 20 naturally occurring amino acids commonly designated by three letter symbols and also includes 4-hydroxyproline, hydroxyzine, demosine, isodemosine, 3-methylhistidine, norvalin, beta-alanine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, citrulline homocysteine, homoserine, ornithine and methionine sulfone. Additional types of prodrugs are also<br><br><br>
WO 03/002533<br><br>
PCT/IB02/01876<br><br><br>
encompassed. For instance, free carboxyl groups can be derivatized as amides or alkyi esters. Free hydroxy groups may be derivatized using groups including but not limited to hemisuccinates, phosphate esters, dimethylaminoacetates, and<br>
phosphoryloxymethyloxycarbonyls, as outlined in Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews, 1996, 19, 115. Carbamate prodrugs of hydroxy and amino groups are also included, as are carbonate prodrugs, sulfonate esters and sulfate esters of hydroxy groups. Derivatization of hydroxy groups as (acyloxy)methyl and (acyfoxy)ethyl ethers wherein the acyl group may be an alkyi ester, optionally substituted with groups including but not limited to ether, amine and carboxylic acid functionalities, or where the acyl group is an amino acid ester as described above, are also encompassed. Prodrugs of this type are described in J. Med. Chem. 1996, 39,10. Free amines can also be derivatized as amides, sulfonamides or phosphonamides. All of these prodrug moieties may incorporate groups including but not limited to ether, amine and carboxylic acid functionalities.<br>
In certain combination therapies with other lipid-lowering agents, such as those described hereinbelow, e.g., HMG CoA reductase inhibitors, HMG CoA synthetase inhibitors, ACAT inhibitors, squalene synthetase inhibitors, etc., a compound of the invention may further comprise a prodrug which comprises a compound of formula 1 in a hydrolyzable linkage to another anti-cancer agent. Di-ester linkages, for example, are particularly useful for this purpose, i.e., the prodrug is in the form A1-C(0)0-L1-0(0)C-A2 , wherein A1 and A2 are the two agents, L1 is a linker such as a methylene or other (d-Ce) alkylene group (alone or further comprising a phenyl or benzyl group). The two agents may both be a compound of the invention, or one may be another agent useful for treating, e.g., obesity, as described herein. See, e.g., U.S. patent 4,342,772 - penicillins in di-ester linkages with p-lactamase inhibitors. Accordingly, a compound of the invention having an available carboxylic acid group provides just one convenient means of producing combination prodrugs of the compound of the invention, which are encompassed by this invention. Typically, the acidic conditions of the gastrointestinal tract, or enzymes localized in the cells thereof cause the hydrolysis of the prodrug, releasing both agents.<br>
Certain compounds of the invention have asymmetric centers and therefore exist in different enantiomeric forms. All optical isomers and stereoisomers of the compounds of the invention, and mixtures thereof, are considered to be within the scope of the invention. With respect to the compounds of the invention, this invention includes the use of a racemate, one or more enantiomeric forms, one or more diastereomeric forms, or mixtures thereof. Some of the compounds of the invention may also exist as tautomers, including, e.g., keto-enol tautomers. This invention relates to the use of all such tautomers and mixtures thereof.<br>
Furthermore, some compounds may exhibit polymorphism. It is to be understood that the present invention encompasses any and all racemic, optically-active, polymorphic and stereoisomeric forms, or mixtures thereof, which form or forms possess properties useful in the treatment of the conditions noted hereinabove, it being well known in the art how to prepare optically-active forms (for example, by resolution of the racemic form by<br><br><br>
WO 03/002533<br><br>
PCT/IB02/01876<br><br><br>
recrystallization techniques, by synthesis from optically-active starting materials, by chiral<br>
synthesis, or by chromatographic separation using a chiral stationary phase) and how to<br>
determine efficacy for the treatment of the conditions noted herein by the standard tests<br>
described hereinafter.<br>
5	The subject invention also relates to isotopically-labelled compounds of the invention<br>
which are identical to those recited in formula I, formula ,1b and formula 2 but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, 10     nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, fluorine and chlorine, such as 2H, 3H, 13C, 14C, 15N, 170,180, 31p 32p 35g 18F and 35Cl respectively. Compounds of the invention and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said compounds which contain the aforementioned isotopes and/or other isotopes of other atoms are within the scope of this invention. Certain isotopically-labelled compounds of the present invention, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such 15     as 3H and 14C are incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated, i.e., 3H, and carbon-14, i.e., 14C, isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., 2H, can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and, hence, may be 20     preferred in some circumstances. Isotopically labelled compounds of this invention can<br>
generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the Schemes and/or in the Examples below, by substituting a readily available isotopically labelled reagent for a non-isotopically labelled reagent.<br>

If appropriate "auxiliary" agents may also be added, which includes<br><br><br>
WO 03/002533<br><br>
PCT/IB02/01876<br><br><br>
preservatives, anti-oxidants, flavors or colorants. The compound of the invention may be<br>
formulated to provide immediate-, delayed-, modified-, sustained-, pulsed- or controlled-<br>
release dependent on the specific route of administration and the specificity of release profile,<br>
commensurate with therapeutic needs.<br>
5	The compounds of the invention can be administered, for example but not limited to,<br>
the following route: oral (including buccal, sublingual, etc.) in the forms that are well known in the art (ref.) for veterinary and pharmaceutical applications. "Oral" in this instance refers to oral mode of administration wherein the forms are explicitly provided to the animals for oral consumption i.e., on-diet, in-drinking fluid, placed directly into the oral cavity, or offered for 10     free-choice consumption. In this invention, the term "animal" includes a warm-blooded animal of the animal kingdom possessed of a homeostatic mechanism and includes mammals and birds, preferably companion animals and livestock animals, and humans. Some examples of companion animals are canines, e.g., dogs, felines, e.g., cats and horses; some examples of livestock animals are pigs, cows, sheep and the like.   Preferably, the animal is a mammal. 15      More preferably, the mammal is a companion animal or a livestock animal.<br>
Typical oral solid forms may include tablets, powders, multi-particulate preparations (granules), capsules, chews, lozenges, films, patches, etc.. Typical oral liquid (including semi¬solid and colloidal) forms may include solutions, elixirs, gels, sprays, liquid-filled chews, etc.. Other oral forms wherein the active agent is suspended in a liquid or semi-solid carrier phase. 20      for example suspensions, may also be used.<br>
The preferred oral solid, liquid and suspension forms for a compound of the invention are those that impart flexibility in dosing to the animals, wherein the method of administration is facile and the dose can be accurately and flexibly controlled in keeping with the need of the therapy. Examples of such forms include tablet preparations, solutions (and similar forms 25      thereof as described herein) and suspensions. In these examples, the dose can be easily controlled for oral administration. Particularly for solutions and suspensions, the utility of appropriate metering systems (i.e., calibrated syringes etc.) provides high flexibility in controlling the dose to facilitate administration to animal species of different sizes or to different animal species or breeds, with varying dose requirements. Additionally, the utility of 30      flavoring/palatability agents and/or texture enhancers in the said forms can promote animal acceptance and compliance, which can be particularly advantageous when dosing chronically to animals.<br>

Preferably all materials will be of at least USP grade.<br>
The compounds of formula J., 2 and 3 are most conveniently synthesized by employing procedures analogous to those known in the chemical arts for the production of similar compounds. Exemplary processes for the manufacture of compounds of formula I 2 20 and 3 as defined in detail hereinabove are provided as further features of the invention and are illustrated by the following procedures in which the meanings of generic radicals are as previously defined unless otherwise qualified. Examples of methods of preparing compounds of the present invention as described herein are provided by Schemes 1-3 below and the description that follows. In the following Schemes, unless otherwise indicated, substituents R1 25     - R15, Ra - Rc, L, X, Z1 and Z2 are as defined above.<br>
The compounds of formulas J., 2 and 3 are generally prepared by forming amide linkages between the groups A, B and £ shown in Table 1 below, wherein in compounds of formula 1, B is Bl; in compounds of formula 2, B is BJ; and in compounds of formula 3, B is B3; wherein Lc is a carboxylic acid or an activated form thereof as described further below, 30     and the amide linkages are formed between the Lc group of A and the amino group -NHR9, and between the Lc group of B and the amine -NHR5 of C, respectively It will be appreciated by those of skill in the art that there are many well-known methods of forming amide linkages, and that it is generally not important which amide linkage is formed first.   Also, it will be appreciated by those of skill in the art that the groups A, B and C are either commercially 35      available or can readily be prepared using materials and methods which are well-known in the art, as well as by the methods and procedures described herein.

Scheme 3<br><br><br><br>
WO 03/002533<br><br>
PCT/IB02/01876<br><br>
Scheme 1  illustrates a  method for preparing a compound. of formula I which<br>
comprises reacting a compound of the formula AB1. with an amine of the formula C_, or, by<br>
reacting a compound of the formula A   with an amine of the formula B1C. where Lc is a<br>
carboxylic acid, preferably, an activated carboxylic acid.    In both cases, a compound of<br>
5      formula 1 is prepared by the formation of an amide linkage.<br>
Activated carboxylic acids of the compound of formula A and AB1 are readily formed<br>
by conventional means, for example, wherein -Lc is -COOH, by reacting the free acid with a<br>
carbodiimide, e.g., 1-{3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride ("EDC") or<br>
1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole ("CDl").   EDC, if used, may advantageously be polymer-bound, as<br>
10      disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,416,193.  Preferably, the amide linkage reaction is carried out<br>
in the presence of a suitable base. An example of a suitable base for use in the coupling<br>
reaction  is a polymer bound  amine,  such  as polymer bound  morpholino-polystyrene.<br>
Preferably, the reaction is carried out in the presence of an alcohol e.g., a 0,-04 alcohol such<br>
as  methanol,  ethanol,  propanol,  isopropanol,  n-butanol  or  t-butanol.  Alternatively,  the<br>
15     carboxylic acid may be activated by conversion to its corresponding acid chloride by e.g.,<br>
treatment with oxalyl chloride in methylene chloride in the presence of a catalytic amount of<br>
DMF. Compounds A, C, AB1 and B1C. and their synthetic precursors and intermediates are<br>
each readily prepared using well-known methods for the formation of amide linkages, and also<br>
by the methods disclosed herein.<br>
20	Another example of a method for forming the amide linkage between AB1 and C,<br>
from the compound AB1 where Le is a carboxylic acid, is by combining AB1. C, and PyBroP (about 1 eq) in methylene chloride, followed by the addition of diisopropylethylamine (2-3 eq) and stirring at room temperature from about 30 minutes to 24 hours. The solvent may be evaporated and the product purified by TLC or flash chromatography using ethyl acetate / 25     hexane as the eiuting solvent.<br>
Still another example of a method for forming the amide linkage between AB1 and C,<br>
where Lc is a carboxylic acid, is to first combine the acid (ABJ.) with N.O-dimethyl<br>
hydroxylamine hydrochloride salt and PyBroP in methylene chloride followed by addition of<br>
diisopropylethylamine and stirring for several hours. The resulting N.O-dimethyl hydroxyamide<br>
30 of the acid is purified by flash chromatography and then treated with DIBAL in THF to yield the<br>
corresponding aldehyde (i.e., Lc is C(O)H). The AB1 aldehyde is then suspended in<br>
methylene chloride with C and acetic acid, and after stirring for about 30 minutes,<br>
NaB(OAc)3H and chloroform are added and the compound of formula ± purified from the<br>
organic layer, e.g., by flash chromatography using methanol/chloroform.<br>
35	The method illustrated in Scheme 1 comprising reacting a compound of the formula A<br>
with an amine of the formula B1C is advantageous in the utilization of a library of A groups, i.e., phenyl or pyridyl carboxylic acids as in Scheme 1, or other carboxylic acids. In this case, a compound of formula 1, formula lb or formula 2 may be formed between a compound of the formula B1C and a A group or other carboxyiic acid, by reacting A or the other acid with a<br><br><br>
WO 03/002533<br><br>
PCT/IB02/01876<br><br><br>
mixture comprising B1C. EDC and DMAP in methylene chloride, preferably at room temperature, followed by addition of N,N-dirnethylethylenediamine, and subsequent purification of the compound of formula 1.<br>
Scheme 2 illustrates a method of preparing compounds of formula AB1.  In Scheme<br>
5      2, a compound of formula A is reacted with a 5-amino- or 6-amino- indole of formula B_1,<br>
wherein Le is a carboxylic acid ester to form the compound AB1-e. followed by hydrolysis of Le<br>
to form the compound AB, bearing a carboxylic acid group Lc, which as described above may<br>
be used in the method of Scheme 1 directly or in the form of an activated acid. The group L*<br>
may advantageously be -COORd, wherein Rd is a (C1-C6) alkyl group or a substituted variation<br>
10      thereon; preferably Rd is methyl or ethyl, more preferably ethyl. Where -Lc is e.g., -COG, i.e.,<br>
an acid chloride, the reaction between A and B1_ may be carried out in methylene chloride and<br>
pyridine or, in a preferred embodiment, as described in Example 44.    AB1-e may be<br>
hydrolysed (or otherwise deprotected) to form AB1 by any conventional means, e.g., by<br>
addition of aqueous LiOH to a solution of the compound in THF and methanol, or, in a<br>

advantageous filtration properties, for example where Lc is -COOH and acidification is<br>
performed at elevated temperature, and preferably where Lc is -COO'K+ crystallizing as a 2.5<br>
mole hydrate.<br>
Still another embodiment of a process for making a compound of the formula 1<br>
20      wherein R10 is of the formula -OR17 is shown in Scheme 3. In this process, an amide linkage<br>
is formed between A'B1 and C, wherein A is analogous to the group R1 except that R10 is,<br>
e.g., acetyl or a thioester as exemplified by a compound such as acetylsalicoylchloride. In this<br>
process, a compound of the formula A'B1 is formed analogously to the process shown in<br>
Scheme 2, by adding to a mixture comprising about 1 equivalent of B1 (ester form, i.e. having<br>
25      "L6" at the 2-position) and diisopropylethylamine (2 eq) in methylene chloride, about one<br>
equivalent of A|, followed by hydrolysis of the ester group Le of A'B1 to produce a carboxylic<br>
acid group Lc and (preferably as part of the same step) hydrolysis of the acetyl group of A' to<br>
form an alcohol. The alcohol/acid A'B1 is then reacted with C as described above, in the<br>
presence of PyBroP to produce a hydroxy-substituted compound A'B1C whose hydroxyl group<br>
30      may then be converted to OR17 by reaction with an alcohol R17OH.<br>
Compounds of formula A are well-known, and are readily obtained commercially or prepared from commercially available biphenyl, bipyridyl or phenyl-pyridyl compounds substituted with at least a carboxylic acid group or having at least one substituent susceptible to derivatization to a carboxylic acid group. Examples of suitable groups A and methods for 35 preparing them may be found in, for example, U.S. Patent No. 6,121,283, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. A particularly preferred group of formula A is 4'-(trifluoromethyl)-2-biphenylcarboxylic acid, which is commercially available; other A groups are commercially available or readily prepared from commercially available analogues by means which are well-known in the art.<br><br><br>

Compounds of formula BJ are readily prepared from well-known or commercially available indoles, e.g., 5-nitro or 6-nitro-indole-2-carboxylic acid ethyl ester ("the indole ester")-To prepare a group BJ, wherein R4 is alkyl or alkoxyalkyl, the indole ester in a suitable solvent, e.g., DMF, may be treated with about one equivalent of sodium hydride, followed by addition of a slight molar excess of alkyl iodide or alkoxyalkyl iodide, e.g., methyl iodide, iodomethyl methyl ether, ethyl iodide, 2-iodopropane, etc., followed by quenching with acid, e.g., HCI, and suitable isolation to yield the alkyl or alkoxyalkyl indole ester. Alternatively the alkylating agent may be an alkyl sulfonate ester, e.g.  methyl tosylate, and the base may be a inorganic salt, e.g. potassium carbonate, and the product provided by an appropriate isolation, such as described in Example 44, In yet another embodiment, a group Bl. wherein R4 is akyl or alkoxyalkyl and Lc = R4, may be prepared by exposing commercially available 5-nitro or 6-nitro-indole-2-carboxylic acid to analogous conditions with adjusted stoichiometry.<br>
Independently, or after alkylation of the indole ester, a compound Bl wherein R3 is halogen, i.e., chloro, bromo or iodo, may be prepared by treating the indole ester with a N-halosuccinimide in a suitable solvent, e.g., THF, followed by neutralization and isolation.<br>
After halogenation and/or alkylation (or alkoxyalkylation) the 5-nitro or 6-nitro group of any of the resulting indole esters (i.e., R3 is H or halo and R4 is independently H, alkyl or alkoxyalkyl) may then be reduced, e.g., with hydrazine hydrate and Raney Nickel in a suitable solvent, e.g., methanol to yield the 5-amino- or 6-amino- indole ester. Alternatively, the nitro group may be hydrogenated catalytically over palladium based catalysts, e.g. palladium on carbon. Alternatively, the nitro group may be hydrogenated catalytically over palladium based catalysts. Alternatively, the nitro group may be subjected to catalytic transfer hydrogenation using palladium based catalysts and a non-gasseous hydrogen source, e.g., a salt of an amine with formic acid such as ammonium fomate, followed by an appropriate isolation, such as described in Example 44. The 5-amino- or 6-amino- indole esters BJ, may advantageously be isolated as their salts with strong acids, e.g. hydrochloric acid. Alternatively the 5-amino or 6-amino-indole esters may be retained in solution for use directly in the following synthetic step.<br>
The 5-amino- or 6-amino- indole ester may then be reacted with a compound of formula A as in Scheme 2 to form the compound AB1-e. wherein R9 is hydrogen. The amide nitrogen of AB1-e , is optionally alkylated, e.g., free radical methylation is used to produce RB = methyl, preferably before hydrolysis of the carboxyiic acid ester to the corresponding 2-carboxylic acid or activated acid form of the compound of formula BJ, used as in Scheme 1.<br>
Compounds of formula B2 are readily prepared from well-known or commercially available indoles, e.g., 5-nitro or 6-nitro-indole-1-acetic acid. Compounds of formula 2 are then readily prepared by forming amide linkages between A. B2 and C using the processes described above for linking 81 to A (or A') and C.<br>

Compounds of formula C are readily prepared by methods analogous to those described above, by forming an amide linkage between a phenyl-glycine amino acid analogue, e.g..<br><br>
and an amine of the formula HNR6R7, wherein Rp is H or a protecting group, such as tert-10      butyloxycarbonyl ("BOC").  Various embodiments of processes for preparing a compound of formula C have been described above, and illustrative examples are provided below.<br>
One example of a process for preparing a compound of formula C, where, e.g., R7 is benzyl and R8 is methyl, involves combining commercially available (S)-N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-2-phenylglycine, 1-hydroxybenzotriazole hydrate and N,N"-dicyclohexylcarbodimide in 15      dichloromethane, and after mixing, adding slowly, with stirring, N-methylbenzylamine in dichloromethane, all at 0-5"C. The resulting slurry is allowed to warm to room temperature overnight before being filtered and the solids washed with dichloromethane. The combined filtrate is preferably subjected to further washes with aqueous weak base and then with aqueous weak acid, and finally washed with water, providing a dichloromethane solution of a 20      phenyiglycine acid amide, where the phenyiglycine amino group (See Table 1, NHR5 of C) is t-butoxycarbonyl-protected. After purification, the phenyiglycine amide is deprotected, e.g., by addition of concentrated hydrochloric acid, and the monohydrate crystalline form of the product precipitated by the addition of tert-butyl methyl ether and seeding, followed by washing with tert-butyl methyl ether and drying to yield the product C with higher optical purity than its 25      /V-protected precursor. The preferred solid form of the product C is characterized by the XRD (X-ray diffraction) data shown in Table 12, as described below.<br>
Table 12 shows 2-theta values for a simulated X-ray powder diffraction pattern the intermediate       compound       (S)-N-benzyl-N-methyl-2-phenylglycinamide      hydrochloride monohydrate described in Example 44 step (e).

In another example of a process for preparing a compound of formula C, where R6 is methyl and R7 is benzyl, (RS)-N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-2-phenylglycine, commercially available or prepared from (RS)-2-phenylglycine using methods well known in the art, is combined with 5      1-hydroxybenzotriazole hydrate, commercially available N-methylbenzylamine and N-[3-<br>
(dimethylamino)propyl-N'-ethylcarbodimide hydrochloride in dichloromethane and the resulting mixture stirred for about 24 hours. The resulting mixture is subjected to an aqueous work-up similar to that described above, providing (tert-butyl (RS)-2-[benzyl(methyl)amino]-2-oxo-1-phenylethylcarbamate, which may be treated with trifluorocaetic acid and triethylsilane in 10      dichloromethane, followed by aqueous workup to yield (RS)-N-benzyl-N-methyl-2-phenylglycinamide.<br>
A salt of the phenylglycine amide may be prepared, e.g., by treating the amide, e.g., ((RS)-N-benzyl-N-methyl-2-phenylglycinamide), with di(o-toluoyl)-L-tartaric acid in a suitable solvent to provide the di(o-toluoyl)-L-tartrate) salt. Tartrate salts of the phenylglycine amides 15      may be broken to provide the amide, which may be purified as its hydrochloride salt.<br>
In still another embodiment of a process for preparing a compound of formula C, commercially available (RS)-DL-2-phenylglycine is converted to (RS)-4-phenyl-1,3-oxazo!idine-2,5-dione using methods well known in the art, which, analogous to the above examples, is then combined with commercially available /V-methylbenzylamine. The resulting 20      mixture is then subjected to an aqueous work-up, providing the phenylglycinamide, which may be purified as its hydrochloride salt as described.<br>
In another embodiment, racemic compounds of the formula C may be resolved via the selective precipitation of one of the enantiomers as its salt with an optically enriched chiral acid, of which many examples are known in the art, from suitable solvents, e.g. methanol and 25      ethanol. Such optically enriched chiral acids may be naturally occuring or synthetic. The precipitated salts may be hydrates or solvates. Breakage of these salts delivers optically enriched free amines of the formula C, which may be purified as-is or as a suitable salts using suitable solvents.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, (RS)-/V-benzyl-N-methyl-2-phenyiglycinamide (10.0g) was 30      treated with di(o-toluoyl)-L-tartaric acid (15.2g) in methanol (167mL) at 20°C. The precipitated the salt was filtered and washed with methanol, then dried providing (S)-N-benzyl-N-methy|-2-phenylglycinamide di(o-toiuoyl)-L-tartrate (11.73g, 46.6%) with 92.7%d.e. (chiral HPLC). This material (1.00g) was resiurried in hot methanol (8.8ml) to provide (S)-A/-benzyl-N-methyl-2-<br><br><br>
WO 03/002533<br><br>
PCT/IB02/01876<br><br>
phenylglycinamide di(o-toluoyl)-L-tartrate with 99% d.e. (0.79g, 79% recovery) after filtration, washing and drying. The tartrate salts formed as described maybe broken to provide the free amine of formula C, i.e. (S)-N-benzyl-N-methyl-2-phenylglycinamide, which may be advantageously purified by the formation of a salt with an achiral acid in the presence of 5      appropriate solvents, e.g. precipitation of (S)-N-benzyl-N-methyl-2-phenylglycinamide hydrochloride from mixtures of propan-2-ol and tert-butyl methyl ether as described.<br>
In another embodiment, a racemic compound of the formula C may be resolved via<br>
the selective recrystallization, from a suitable solvent, of its salt with an optically enriched<br>
chiral acid, e.g. (RS)-N-benzyl-/V-methyi-2-phenylglycinamide di(o-toluoyl)-L-tartrate prepared<br>
10      as described above, to provide diastereomericly enriched salts, e.g. (S)-N-benzyl-N-methyl-2-<br>
phenylglycinamide di(o-toluoyl)-L-tartrate. Breakage of these salts delivers optically enriched<br>
free amines of the formula C, which may be advantageoulsy isolated and used as the<br>
hydrochloride salt, e.g. (S)-N-benzyl-N-methyl-2-phenylglycinamide hydrochloride as<br>
described.<br>
15	In another embodiment, where optically enriched compunds C are preferrable, the<br>
unwanted enantiomer of the compound C may be recycled by racemization. In a more preferred embodiment, the racemization is applied to mother liquors from the resolutions described in the preceding embodiments, by (a) optionally changing the nature of the solvent and (b) refluxing in the presence of a catalytic amount of a carbonyl compound, e.g. 2-20      chlorobenzaldehyde, thus allowing the isolation of second crops of diastereomericly enriched salts containing the desired enantiomer of compound C, e.g. (S)-N-benzyl-/V-methyl-2-phenylglycinamide di(o-toluoyl)~L-tartrate with 92% d.e. in approximately 50% yield of the solute in the initial ethanolic mother liquors. In an even more preferred embodiment, the catalysed racemization is performed at a suitable temperature and concentration in-situ during 25      the resoluton in a suitable solvent, prior to the isolation of the first crop of product; this<br>
"dynamic resolution" allows a first crop yield of product to be significantly greater than the 50% available by traditional salt resolutions. Dynamic resoultions are known in the art, but suitable conditions are generally highly substrate-dependent.<br>
In still another embodiment of a process for preparing an opticaly enriched compound 30      of formula C, commercially available homochiral (S)-L-2-phenytglycine is converted to (S)-4-phenyl-1,3-oxazolidine-2,5-dione using methods well known in the art, which, may then be combined with commercially available N-methylbenzylamine. The resulting mixture is then subjected to an aqueous work-up, providing the phenylglycinamide, e.g. (S)-N-benzyl-N-methyl-2-phenylglycinamide with 43% e.e. in 49% yield, which may be purified as its 35      hydrochloride salt as described, or di(o-toluoyl)-L-tartrate salt.<br>

Inhibition of fat absorption<br>
Healthy female CF1 mice (Charles River) weighing 18-20 grams upon arrival are employed as test subjects. The mice are housed in groups of 10 in standard caging, and are 5      allowed to acclimate for one week prior to testing. Mice are fasted overnight in a separate procedure room prior to testing. Each treatment group typically consists of 5 mice.<br>
The test compound is preferably provided as a powder in a glass vial. The dosing solution (0.10ml/25g body weight) administered by oral gavage consists of an emulsion of Miglyol 812 (20%), Cremaphor (5%), Water (75%). An appropriate volume of Miglyol is first 10      added to the test compound, and the vial vortexed for approximately 1 minute. Next, the appropriate volume of Cremaphor is added, and the vial again vortexed as previously. The appropriate volume of water is then added, and the emulsion formed by vortexing and briefly sonicating.<br>
Hamster liquid diet (Bioserve F0739) (dose volume 0.5ml/25g body weight) is 15      prepared by adding (for every 10 mL needed) 2.5 grams liquid diet powder, 10 mL water and 5 microcuries glycerol-3H-trioleate (Amersham TRA191) to a laboratory blender. The mixture is then blended at high speed for approximately 1 minute. The liquid diet is stored at 4°C until use.<br>
Sample tubes are weighed (Falcon 15ml polypropylene conical). Three milliliters of 20     2.5N KOH is then added to each tube.<br>
Following overnight fasting, each mouse is dosed (see above volumes) with test<br>
compound followed immediately by liquid diet. Positive (a known potent MTP inhibitor) and<br>
negative control groups (vehicle) are included in each assay. One scintillation vial is sham<br>
dosed every 30 mice in order to determine the activity of the initial bolus.<br>
25	At two hours post dose the mice are euthanized by carbon dioxide inhalation, the<br>
abdominal cavity opened, and the small intestines removed and placed in the KOH conical tube. Each tube is then weighed.<br>
Tubes containing intestines are then placed in a 75°C water bath for 1.5-2 hours.<br>
Following saponification, the tubes are vortexed and 200uL saponate placed in a 20mL liquid<br>
30     scintillation vial. Samples are decolorized (for 30 minutes) by adding 200nL of 30% (w/w)<br>
hydrogen peroxide. Each sample is neutralized by the addition of 200nL of 3N HCL. Ten<br>
milliliters of Ready Safe® (Beckman) liquid scintillation fluid are added and the samples were<br>
counted on a Beckman Coulter LS 6500 scintillation system.<br>
The calculations are carried out as follows:<br>
35	-    weight of saponate = weight of tube (KOH + intestine) - weight of empty tube<br>
-	saponate fraction = 0.22/ saponate weight (density of the saponate = 1.1 g/mL; therefore the weight of the aliquot is equal to 0.22g)<br>
-	total DPM for the entire intestine = DPM of sample/saponate fraction<br>
The initial bolus DPM is calculated by averaging the counts from the sham dosed<br><br><br>

The fraction of bolus recovered from the intestine (percent recovery) = total DPMI bolus count.<br>
Percent recovery from each test group = average of percent recovery from each<br>

Interpretation of results:<br>
To compare efficacy of test compounds, an ED25 for intestinal fat absorption is calculated. The (average) percent triglyceride recovery (percent unabsorbed and remaining in the<br>
10      intestine) of the vehicle control group is adjusted to equal 0%, and the (average) percent<br>
recovery of the compound control group is adjusted to equal 100%. The same calculations are applied to the percent recovery values obtained for test compounds and an adjusted percent recovery is obtained (% recovery of the test sample - % recovery of vehicle control group / (% recovery of positive control group - % recovery of vehicle control group)). An ED25 is then<br>
15     calculated by plotting a graph of compound concentration vs. adjusted percent recovery.<br>
Serum triglyceride lowering<br>
Healthy female CF1 mice (Charles River) weighing 18-20 grams upon arrival are employed as test subjects. The mice are housed in groups of 10 in standard caging, and were 20     allowed to acclimate for one week prior to testing. Mice are fasted overnight in a separate procedure room prior to testing. Each treatment group typically consists of 10 mice.<br>
The test compound is preferably provided as a powder in a glass vial. The dosing solution (0.250ml/25g body weight) administered by oral gavage consists of an emulsion of Miglyol 812 (40%), Cremaphor (10%), Water (50%). An appropriate volume of Miglyol is first 25     added to the test compound, and the vial vortexed for approximately 1 minute. Next, the appropriate volume of Cremaphor is added, and the vial again vortexed as previously. The appropriate volume of water is then added and the emulsion formed by vortexing and briefly sonicating.<br>
Following overnight fasting, each mouse is dosed (see above volumes) with test 30     compound. At 1hour post dose the mice are euthanized by carbon dioxide inhalation and blood collected for triglyceride quantitation.<br>
Serum triglyceride values are quantitated using a colorimetric endpoint assay (Wako<br>
Triglyceride E kit # 432-4021) on a Spectra Max 250 plate reader with Softmax Pro software.<br>
All samples are run in duplicate.<br>
35	For comparison of triglyceride values, the percent change from control is calculated.<br>
The average triglyceride value of the test compound group is divided by the average triglyceride value of the vehicle group, multiplied by 100 and then subtracted from 100%. The ED25 value is then calculated by plotting a graph of compound concentration versus percent change from control.<br><br><br>

('S)-N-{2-[benzyl(methyl)amino]-2-oxo-1-phenylethyl}-1-methyl-5-t4,-(trifluoromethyl)[1,r-10      biphenyl]-2-carboxamido]-1H-indole-2-carboxamide<br>
(a) Ethyl 1-methyl-5-nitro-1H-indole-2-carboxyiate was prepared by methylation of ethyl 5-nitro-1H-indole-2-carboxylate using methods well known in the art (see, e.g., E.F.V. Scriven et al., J.C.S., P.T.1, (1979) p.53-59). For example, methylation may be achieved using any compatible combination of electrophiiic methylating agent, i.e., H3C-LG, where LG is a 15      leaving group, and a base, e.g., using dimethylsuifate, methyl iodide (Example 45, step (a)) or methyl tosylate, with bases such as sodium hydride, potassium t-butoxide or potassium carbonate. Preferably, methyl tosylate and potassium carbonate are used as follows:<br>
To a refluxing mixture of commercially available ethyl 5-nitro-1H-indole-2-carboxylate (420g) and potassium carbonate (272.6g) in acetonitrile (3360 mL) was added a solution of 20      methyl p-toluenesulfonate (367.3g) in acetonitrile (630 mL), and the resulting mixture refluxed for 18 hours. The mixture was then cooled to 20°C over 3 hours and water (4200 mL) added over a 3 hour period. The product was granulated, filtered, washed with a 50/50 mixture of demineralized water and acetonitrile (630 mL), demineralized water (420 mL) and then with<br><br><br>

from step (a) or commercial sources, and 10% palladium on carbon catalyst (50% wet) (42g) in ethanol (4200 mL) was added a solution of ammonium formate (541.5g) in demineralized water (840 mL) at between 25-35°C over 3 hours. The mixture was stirred for 18 hours at 20°C, and then filtered, washing the solids with ethanol (2100 mL). The combined filtrate and 10      washings were concentrated to 840 mL under vacuum at about 20°C. The resulting slurry was granulated at 5°C, filtered, washed with chilled ethanol (420 mL), and dried to give product ethyl 5-amino-1-methyl-1H-indole-2-carboxylate (316.5g, 86%).<br>
Preferred alternative B. A mixture of ethyl 1-methyl-5-nitro-1H-indole-2-carboxylate<br>
(150.0g), from step (a) or commercial sources, and 10% palladium on carbon catalyst (50%<br>
15      wet) (15.0g) in ethyl acetate (1800 mL) was hydrogenated at 3 bar at 30°C for 8 hours. The<br>
mixture was then filtered and the solids washed with ethyl acetate (300 mL). The combined<br>
filtrate and washings were partially azeotropically dried at reflux and then concentrated to 800<br>
mL to give a solution of product ethyl 5-amino-1 -methyl- 1/Y-indole-2-carboxylate in ethyl<br>
acetate.<br>
20	The acid salts of ethyl 5-amino-1-methyl-1 H-indole-2-carboxylate are also readily<br>
available via methods well-known in the art. For example, the hydrochloride salt is readily prepared by treating an ethylacetate solution of the amine with hydrochloric acid in propan-2-ol.<br>

The excess reagent was removed by atmospheric co-distillation with toluene (600ml 30      distillate removed), providing a solution of 4'-(trifluoromethyl)[1,1'-biphenyl)-2-carbonyl<br>
chloride, which was combined with ethyl 5-amino-1-methyl-1H-indole-2-carboxylate (109g) from the previous step, ethyl acetate (4660ml) and A/,A/-diisopropylethylamine (131 mL) at 18-29"C. The resulting slurry was cooled, filtered and the crude product solids were washed with propan-2-ol (330 mL). The crude product was twice reslurried in a 70/30 mixture of 35      demineralized water and propan-2-ol (2 x 1500 mL), and the solids were filtered, washed with propan-2-ol (400 mL) and dried, yielding the title compound, ethyl 1 -methyl-5-[4'-(trifluoromethyl)[1,1 '-biphenyl]-2-carboxamido]-1 H-indole-2-carboxylate (167g, 71.8%).<br>

to a solution of thionyl chloride (100.4g) and N-methylpyrrolidone (3.7g) in toluene (750 mL) at reflux. The resulting mixture was heated at reflux for 18 hrs, then the acetonitrile and excess thionyl chloride were distilled off by reducing the volume to 900 mL. Additional toluene (2250 mL) was then added before re-concentrating to provide a solution of the intermediate acid 5      chloride (4*-(trifluoromethyl)[1,1'-biphenyl]-2-carbonyl chloride) (900 mL). This solution was then diluted with ethyl acetate (2620 mL) and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (109.5g) was added. An ethyl acetate solution of ethyl 5-amino-1-methyl-1H-indole-2-carboxylate (1.07 mole equivalents), from step (b), (solution volume 800 mL) was then added in two portions at 20-25°C, seeding with product (ethyl 1-methyl-5-{4'-(trifluoromethyl)[1,1'-biphenyl]-2-10      carboxamido}-1H-indole-2-carboxylate) between portions. The crude product was granulated overnight then isolated by filtration and washed with propan-2-ol (450 mL). The crude product was twice reslurried in a 75/25 mixture of demineralized water and propan-2-ol (2 x 180 mL), and the solids were filtered, washed with propan-2-ol (450 mL) and dried, yielding product (ethyl 1 -methyl-5-[4'-(trifluoromethyl)[1,1 '-biphenyl]-2-carboxamido]-1H-indole-2-carboxylate) 15      (196g. 74.5%).
