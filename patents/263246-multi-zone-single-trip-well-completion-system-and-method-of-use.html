[0009] BACKGROUND OF TEIE INVENTION<br>
[0010] Field Of The Invention. The inventions described herein relate general!} to hydrocarbon well completion systems, and more particularly to a system tor completing multiple production zones in a single trip.<br>
[0011] Description Of The Related Art.<br>
[0012] One of the single biggest costs associated with completing a subterranean<br>
hydrocarbon well, such as a sub sea well, is the time that it takes to remove a tool<br><br>
or other well equipment from the well bore. Depending on well depth, tripping time may account for the majority of well completion costs. For a well having multiple production zones, tripping time is compounded if each /.one must be completed separately from the other zones. It is desirable, therefore, to reduce the number of trips necessary to complete the two or more production "zones in a multi-zone well.<br>
[0013] U.S. Patent No. 6,464.006 is entitled Single Trip, Multiple Zone Isolation, Well Fracturing System and discloses a device and method for "'the completion of multiple production zones in a single well bore with a single downhole trip."'<br>

While a developer's efforts might be complex and time-consuming in an absolute sense, such efforts would be. nevertheless, a routine undertaking for those of skill this art having benefit of this disclosure. The inventions disclosed and taught herein are susceptible to numerous and various modifications and alternative forms.<br>
[0045] The use of a singular term is not intended as limiting of the number of items. Also, the use of relative terms, such as. but not limited "W "top." "'bottom." "left." "right,'" "upper," "lower," "down,'" "up," "side." and the like are used herein for clarity in reference to the Figures and are not intended to limit the invention or the embodiments that come within the scope of the appended claims. "Uphoie" generally refers to the direction in which equipment is tripped out the well.  "Downhole" generally refers to the direction that is the opposite of uphoie<br><br>
for a particular well. The improved well completion systems disclosed and taught herein may be used in vertical wells, deviated wells and/or horizontal we lis.<br>
[0046] Applicants have created an improved system for completing in a single downhole trip one or more hydrocarbon bearing formations (production zones) traversed by a well bore. The improved well completion system accomplishes multiple tasks in a single downhole trip and provides for well bore operations, such as, but not limited to. formation fracturing and gravel packing operations, squeeze and circulating conditions, and real time annul us pressure monitoring, all with no production zone length restriction. The improved well completion system may comprise a completion assembly comprising two or more production zone assemblies and a production packer, and a service tool assembly,<br>

Preferably, a wash pipe is not requi:ed during formation treatments, such as. but not limited to. fracturing, or grave!-packing operations. Positive, selective production zone isolation is provided during completion, stimulation, and production operations and the improved weli completion system provides for fresh isolation seals for each /one. The improved well completion system provides physical indications of some or all system positions or conditions, with optional hydraulic verification as well.<br>
[0048] Conventional mechanical sleeve valves may access hydrocarbon production from one or more selected production zones. Additionally, multi-zone production control systems, such as. but not limited to. those disclosed in commonly owned U.S. Patent 6,397,949, U.S. Patent 6,722,440. and pending application serial numbers 10/364,941 and 10/788,833, (the disclosure of each being hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes) may be incorporated<br><br>
with the improved completion system to allow non-commingled production from two or more zones that were completed in a single downhole trip.<br>
[0049] In general, once the well bore has been established and is readv for completion, a conventional or proprietary sump packer may be nan into the weli bore to a predetermined depth and set in place. Typically, the sump packer will be used to provide a reference point for subsequent well operations, such as. but not limited to, zone perforation and completion. If desired, conventional or proprietary perforating operations may be employed to sequentially or simultaneously perforate one or more of the production zones of interest traversed by the well bore. The improved "well completion system imposes no restrictions on the length of a production zone or on the spacing between zones. If necessary, fluid loss control systems, such as, but not limited to. but not limited :•:: r;;i;. :r.a&gt; he useo lo control the perlorated zones, '-jnoe the oroduction zo'tes ••' ..;IV:TC.-.. have been e.-.'.ablished. an improved Z'ompJetio:.': system uii'i^ni :■■••.- ■■ ~ —■■'■•■.-■ aspects of the present inventions may be assembled.<br>
[0050] An improved completion system may comprise a completion assembly. which may comprise a bottom assembly, two or more production, zone assemblies and a production packer. The completion assembly may be assembled :md hung off the rig floor. A boltom assembly may comprise a indicating collet assembly for indicating position off of the sump packer: a pressure test assembly allowing internal pressurization for integrity testing purposes, and a tool activating assembly to activate a deactivated tool assembly, if used. The two nr more production zone assemblies may comprise a production screen assembly with internal production valves, such as. but not limited to. mechanical sleeves for sealing and unsealing production screen ports, a circulation valve closing profile. formation access valve assembly, a seal system, an isolation packer assembly and<br><br>
an automatic system locator assembly. The bottom assembly may be coupled to a first or lower production zone assembly, both or" which may be hung off the rig floor and pressure tested during make up.<br>
[0051] Typically, each successive production zone assembly, if used. ma&gt;<br>
comprise substantially the same components as the first or lower production zone<br>
assembly, or the successive production zone assemblies may comprise<br>
components different that than the first production zone assembly or other<br>
production zone assemblies, as required by the particulars of the well and<br>
production zones. Preferably, each production zone comprises isolated gravel<br>
pack screens, preferably with integral production sliding sleeves, a frac pack<br>
gravel pack sleeve for placing sand or proppant. a seal system, an --ottoman c<br>
system  locating  assembly  and an  isolation packer.	As  each  :J,U-::-.:.<br>
production zone assembly is made up. the completion as^n-olv ;:; i;u;u ..-■&gt;&gt; : ■-■ ■ ■_.• floor and pressure tester: for integrity. All system v-j-.es. su:h as. bin -."■: 'tir.iteo to. production valves, may be. and preferably are. am in the closed pa.vh ion to provide positive, pre-treatment zonal isolation. Once the desired number of production zone assemblies are made up and hung off the rig floor, a single gravel pack service tool may be installed below the lowermost screened interval nrd connected through a concentric inner work string to the primary work string above the top production packer. Alternately, the assembly may be run into the well on production tubing and the work string / service tool may be installed below the lowermost screened interval thereafter. In any event, the entire assembly may be run into the wellbore in a single trip.<br>
[0052] A service tool assembly for use with the improved well completion system may comprise a nosepiece. an opening tool assembly, a secondary indexing collet assembly, a closing tool assembly including a circulation valve, a cross-over<br><br>
assembly with hardened seal surfaces and a primary indexing shoulder, an automatic system locating profile and a hydraulic setting tool. For completion assemblies that utilize the typical down-to-open convention for product ;o"! valves. the opening tool preferably wall be located distally of the closing tool. The service tool assembly may comprise hardened seal surfaces, such as slick joints, that cooperate with the seal systems in each production zone assembly TO provide a positive sealing system for each zone to be completed.<br>
[00531 fit some embodiments, prior to final improved completion system make¬up, the service tool assembly may be run into the completion assembly and positioned such that the opening tool (and/or the closing tool, as desired) is located below the lowermost production sleeve in the first or lowermost production zone assembly. Once the tool assembly has been positioned within the iovvcrmos! production assembiv. a completion svstem pressure ic-.t n'&gt;T. ;.■;:■ :■;:;',■ s verify overall system integrity, including that all system valves arc closed. T;. ensure that running the service tool assembly through the production zone assemblies has not unintentionally opened one or more down-to-open valves, the opening tool may be initially deactivated, such as during run in. In a preferred embodiment, once the service tool assembly has been positioned wnh the completion assembly, the opening tool ma}' be activated by hydraulic pressure. Alternately, positioning the service tool with the completion assembly may mechanically activate the opening tool. If desired, a device may be provided to allow for verification that the opening tool has been activated, such as. but not limited to. a mock mechanical sleeve. After pressure integrity testing has been completed, the pressure test sub in the lowermost assembly may be deactivated, such as. but not limited to. by using the nose piece of the tool assembly to removing a sealing device.<br><br>
[0054] An improved well completion system (e.g.. comprising two or more production zone assemblies and a service tool assembly; may be run into to the well bore, on a work string or production tubing, and located in position relative to the sump packer or other well bore artifact. In a preferred embodiment, the lowermost production zone assembly comprises a position indicating system, such as. but not limited to. an indicating collet assembly. For example, once the improved completion system is believed to be correctly positioned relative to the sump packer, the indicating system may provide positive placement identification, such as, but not limited to, by a repeatable lifting or "snap through*' load. Once the improved completion system is properly located, with or without the aid of a position indicating system, a production packer may be set according to its design. For example, the production packer may comprise a BJ Services ConipSet II HP packer, which may be hydraulic-ally set. such as by dropping a ha!! or oilier pressurization device into the completion system and pressuring ;;;&gt; :^i:\ns. :n.. device. This pressurization may be used ic activate the hydraulic selling roci to set the packer, and thereafter release the service (ool assembly and vijit; string from the completion assembly (e.g.. the production packer).<br>
[0055] In such embodiments, once the service tool assembly has been separated from the completion assembly, any pressure-blocking device used to activate the setting tool may be disabled. In the case of the ConipSet II HP production packer. additional pressurization against a ball will move the ball out of setting tool activating position and simultaneously uncover the crossover ports in the service tool assembly and trap the ball against unwanted upward travel. Alternately, the ball may comprise polymer glass-filled lightweight ball that may be reversed out of the system, thereby eliminating the need for a "mouse trap" to capture and hold the settine ball.<br><br>
[0056] Alternately, the TIP-PT Packer available from BJ Services Compam is suitable for use with the present invention when the production assemblies are run in on the production tubing, rather than a work siring.<br>
[0057] Regardless of whether the production assemblies were run in on a work string or production tubing, the service tool assembly may be moved relative to the completion assembly to position the opening tool above a production valve, such as, but not limited to, a down-to-open production sleeve in the first or lowermost production zone assembly. Once the opening tool is positioned above the production valve, downward movement of the sendee tool assembly will cause the opening tool to engage a corresponding opening profile on the production valve and open the associated production ports, such as. but no! limited to. by moving a production sleeve. Opening of the production pom ma; be verified bvdraulicallv by pumping down the well r&gt;ore and in:o ins ::. r;a.:;;,-:";.<br>
[0058] The service tool assembly also may be moved adjacent the isolation-: packer assembly for the lowermost production zone to engage the production assembly's seals with tool assembly's hardened seal surface. Once the seal surface or slick joint is positioned in sealing arrangement, the isolation packer may be set. such as, but not limited to. by pressuring down the work string. Once the pressure integrity of the lowermost isolation packer is established, the tool assembly may be re-positioned so that the opening tool is in position to open (e.g., above) a formation access valve or frac valve in the production zone assembly. The service tool assembly may be repositioned to open the formation access valve and to position the tool assembly for well treatment operations. In a preferred embodiment, each production zone assembl} comprises an automatic locating assembly or "autolocator" that may be cycled by the service too! assembly among<br><br>
a plurality of well completion system conditions, such as. nut not limited TO. ""Run-In," "Set-down'" and "Pick-Up."<br>
[0059J In a preferred embodiment, once the service tool assembly, cycles the autolocator to the "Set-down" or frac condition, set down weight may be applied to the well completion system to maintain relative position between the service tool assembly and the completion assembly (e.g.. to maintain port alignment) during pumping treatments. The improved well completion system may also provide for real time pumping pressures to be monitored through the aiinulus during pumping operations. The well completion system may be placed in a squeeze position at any time during the pumping operation by simply repositioning the well tool assembly.<br>
[0060] A formation fracturing and'or gravel packing operation may Ix ^ra./i hy pumping down the work string and into the annuius adjacent thc^ycxluciior: screen assembly. Once the treatment is completed, the sendee tool assembly may be repositioned to a reverse position by locating the crossover assembly relative to the reversing seal in the production zone assemblies. Debris from the gravel packing treatment may be reversed out of the completion system by pumping do^n the tool assembly annuius and taking returns up through the work string. The pressures developed during reversing will not affect formation zones above the zone being completed because such upper zones are fully isolated and then-production ports are closed. The tool assembly is once again repositioned so that the end of the tool assembly is above the formation access sea! to dear any remaining debris. The formation may be monitored thereafter for pressure build up or fall off.<br><br>
(006] j The tool assembly may be repositioned so that the closing tool i; located distal or below the lowermost opened production valve. Upward movement of the tool assembly through the zone causes the closing profile on the closing tool to engage a corresponding profile on the production valve, (e.g.. a production sleeve) and causes all production valves to seal off or close their- associated production ports, thereby isolating the completed zone. Zone isolation may be verified by surface pressurization.<br>
[0062] The service tool assembly may then be repositioned into the zone above the zone just completed. The opening tool may be positioned above or proximal a production sleeve in this zone. The process described above may be repeated for each successive production zone. Once ail production zones have been completed, the service tool assembly and work siring ma; be removed h-ovi -.he well bore leaving a compieied. fully isolated. mu^ti-zone weli. rr^sj-v-: r: -.-'■ hydrocarbons from any zone may be accomplished by mechanically &gt;'^.r&gt;v.-:^ ;' c desired production valves using wire line, coiled tubing or other conventional or proprietary methods. Commingled production from multiple zones may be accomplished by opening production sleeves in multiple zones. .A preferred embodiment of the completion system contemplates a selective profile system having four, five, six or more different production sleeve profiles for selective zonal production. For example, specific profiles on the service tool assembly may-open and/or close valves in the completion assembly. Other specific profiles associated with coiled tubing tools and/or wire line tools may be used to selectively open and/or close such valves. Also, when coupled with intelligent or intervention less production control systems, such as. but not limited to. those commonly-owned systems referenced above, the improved completion system disclosed herein may provide simultaneous, non-commingled production from<br><br>
multiple zones without mechanical intervention, or a combination of mechanical and hydraulic interventions.<br>
[0063] An improved completion system utilizing one or more the present inventions may reduce or eliminate the need to run and/or retrieve packer plugs and/or gravel pack assemblies, and may eliminate multiple perforation runs. Substantial savings in rig time and money, as well as responsible formation management, may be realized by virtue of one or more of the present inventions disclosed and taught with this improved completion system.<br>

Lastly, a nosepiece 222 may complete the service tool assembly 200.<br>
[0069] Turning now to a more detailed description of embodiments and preferred embodiments of the improved completion system. FIG. 3 illustrates a cross-sectional side view of a preferred form of an automatic system locating assembly 106 or "autolocator" that may be used with the improved well completion system of the present invention. The autolocator 106 comprises an outer housing 150 and an inner housing 152. The outer and inner housings are adapted to slide reiatne to one anoiher and the interlace there between comprises an nidex^ig ^cic 15— and follower 156. The follower 156 is partially housed within ': bc-iring "5s: preferably bronze, to facilitate sliding contact (both axial and circumferential! between the inner and outer housings. 152. 150. The indexing cycle 154 is described in more detail in FIG. 4.<br>
[0070] In the particular embodiment of the autolocator illustrated in f'G. 5. a portion of the inner housing 152 comprises a plurality of collet fingers ! "0. preferably 8. At approximately the mid length of each finger 170 is an autolocator profile or groove 176 adapted to interface with the autolocator profile 210 on the service tool assembly 200. The groove 176 is preferably formed in an insert 178 that is coupled to each collet finger 170. The fingers 170 and autolocator profiles 210, 176 are preferably designed to require a snap through load of about 12 kips in the uphole direction. Because off the relatively high pass through load, it is preferred that the insert 178 be made from a beryllium copper<br><br>
alloy to provide superior anti-galling characteristics. One such alloy suitable for the insert 178 is CDA 172 alloy (ASTM Bl%). Other material systems that offer-suitable galling resistance and strength may be used.<br>
[0071] At its proximal end, the inner housing 152 has a floating detent collet 160 comprising a plurality of fingers that are held in place between a shoulder and retaining ring 151. It is preferred that the retaining ring 151 be made from a bearing material such as bronze. The retaining ring preferably comprises a debris shield to reduce the risk of debris fouling the detent collet assembly 160. The each finger has a profile 162, which corresponds to one or more grooves in the outer housing 150. Preferably, the outer housing 150 has a plurality of detent grooves, which correspond to the various positions or conditions into Nviiich the completion system may be placed. For example, detent grouse 164 mu.-coiresDond to a 'Run-In" condition, groove loo may correspond io :: "A._L■'.-,■ condition and groove 168 ma}' correspond u:&gt; '-: "Trae or Set-down" cor&gt;ii:-'iv ;ne detent collet 160 and grooves may be designed for a snap through load or"about 1 kip.<br>
[0072] As illustrated in FIG. 3. the autoiocator 106 is in die -Run-in" oration (i.e.. detent profile 162 engages groove 164). When the tool assembh 20') ha-engaged the autoiocator 106 (i.e., when profile 1 72 is engaged with grooves 1 76 j. a load of about 1 kip is required to shift the completion system iOo tor more precisely, the particular production zone assembly 108) into either the "Pick-Up' or "Set-down" condition, depending upon the state of the indexing cycle 154. The same 1-kip load is also required to return to the "Run-In" condition. As can be seen in FIG. 3, when the autoiocator 106 is in the Run-in or Pick-Up condition. the collet assembly 170 is able to deflect into recess 182 to allow the serve too! assembly 200 to snap through.    To pass the tool assembly 200 through the<br><br>
autolocator 106 in an uphole direction requires a load of about 13kips. The autolocator 106 is in the Set-down or Frac condition, the collet 170 is displaced downhole relative to outer housing 150 and collet surface 171 will be adjacent outer housing surface 173. In this condition, there is no recess for the collet to expand into and the service tool assembly may not snap through the autolocator in either direction. In the Set-down or Frac condition, the set down weight is carried by the autolocator profiles 210, 176 and set down shoulder 186. It is preferred that in Set-down condition, the collet fingers 170 are always placed in tension to avoid buckling the collet 170.<br>
[0073] It is preferred that the autolocator assembly 106 also comprises a lockout mechanism 180. such as a sleeve. The lockout sleeve 180 has closing tool profiles 181. 182 so that the closing tool 214 on the completion tool assembly 200 caii engage me 'OCKOUI sleeve 180 to mow ii lelauve io me i.viici asscm~r. : ".'. When the closing tool assembly 214 engages profile 181. the lockout mechanism 180 may be moved uphole and cause the collet assembly 170 to deflect outwardly. Therefore, the bearing inserts 178, and profiles 176 are moved out of the way and into recess 182.<br>
[0074] FIG. 4 is a laid-out illustration of the preferred indexing cycle 154 for the autolocator 106. One complete cycle is shown in FIG. 4 and it is to be understood that the indexing cycle 154 may be a continuous loop. The indexing cycle 154 comprises an engineered track 188 along which a follower 156 is constrained to travel. Although the follower 156 is shown in FIG. 4 to be in multiple positions along the track, it will be appreciated the follower 156 will reside in only one position along the track 188 at any point in time. For example, while the completion tool assembly 200 is engaged in the autolocator 106 (such as shown in FIG. 3), downhole movement of the work string will cause the completion system<br><br>
to enter the "Frac / Set-down" condition and detent collar 160 will engage detent groove 168. Thereafter, uphole movement of the tooi assembly 200 will cause the completion system to enter the "Pick-Up" condition. The follower 156 may-comprise a ring carried in a bronze bearing 158, in which the follower 156 may rotate. In a preferred embodiment, the follower 156 is not loaded in the Set-down or Pick-Up conditions, but may be load bearing in the Run-in condition.<br>
[0075] In the embodiment described in FIGS. 3 and 4. the autolocator is associated with the completion assembly and the autolocator profile is associated with the service tool assembly. Those of skill in the art will appreciate that this association may be preferred for smaller diameter completion systems. Larger diameter completions may permit this association to be reversed, in other words, the invention described herein also contemplates that the autolocuior on H!e may be associated with the completion assernbi} and the autolocator ma\ o~ :.:;:,oc;ated with the service tool assembly.<br>
[0076] FIG. 5a illustrates generally a first seal system 110 located adjacent an isolation packer assembly 112. in a preferred embodiment, the first seal system is located above the packer setting port. The seals 190 of the first seal system 110 are preferably molded elastomeric seals 192 on a metal carrier 194. although other sealing technologies, such as, but not limited to. PTFF, PEEK and/or PEKK may be used. The seal system 190 may be described as "inverted" in that the scaling surfaces 192 are exposed to the inside of the production zone assembly 108. As shown in FIG 5a. a stack of 3 seal rings may be held in a seal recess 196 by a retainer 198 (which may be a part of a safety joint). The seal system 1% is adapted to sealinglv engage a portion of the tool assembly 200, such as, but not limited to, a slick joint 230 or other seal surface. It will be appreciated that each production zone assembly 108 preferably has a first seal system 110.<br><br>
[0077] Also shown in FIG. 5a is isolation packer 112 slip system 75 to prevent or reduce uphole movement of the packer during fracturing or other pumping operations. The slip system 75 is preferably actuated by fracturing returns, which causes individual slips 76, 78 to erippingly engage a casing or well bore (not shown). This actuation may be locked in so that the slips continue gripping engagement after the actuating pressure has been release, or, more preferably, the slips may disengage the casing once actuating pressure is relieved. An isolation packer slip system 75, such at that described in FIG. 5a, may prevent a^iet\ joint or other assembly below the isolation packer (not shown) from shearing due to fracture pressure induced movement of the system. A slip system also prevents buckling of assemblies uphole from the packer, such as an adjacent zone's production screen assembly.<br>
[0078] FIG. 5b illustrates a preferred shear out safety system thai ma;.' be use-' with the well completion system. The shear out safety system 600 illustrated ir; FIG. 5b comprises first and second body portions 602. 604. These body portions are concentrically aligned and coupled together with a load-bearing system 606 and a shear out system 608. The load-bearing system may comprise a pfiralr.\ rn uogs or keys 610 between the first and second body portions 602. 604, A sleeve or piston 612 is located on the outside diameter surface of the safety system 600 and is preferably shear pinned 614 to the first and/or second bod\ portion such that the sleeve forces the dogs 610 into load bearing arrangement, as shown in FIG. 5b. The shear out system 608 may comprise a plurality of shear pins between the first and second body portions 602, 604.<br>
[0079] A preferred embodiment of the shear out safety system is designed to carry about 250,000 pounds during tripping in (as shown in FIG. 5b). To activate<br><br>
the safety system 600. such as when the completion system 100 is set adjacent the sump packer, hydraulic pressure is applied to the safety system 600 so that the sleeve 612 is moved in an axial direction (e.g.. downhole) to uncover or release the dogs 610. It will be appreciated that the dogs 610 are biased to a non-load bearing orientation when not restrained by the sleeve 612. Once the dogs are release, the load bearing capability of the safety system 600 is determined by the shear out system 608. A preferred embodiment of the shear out system 608 comprises a plurality of individual shear pins 607 and 609. which are designed to carry about 100,000 pounds after the safety system 600 has been activated.<br>
[0080J Applicants prefer that each production zone assembly 108 incorporate a shear out safety system 600. The preferred location of the safety system 600 is between the first sealing system 110 and the au? .'-locator 106. Each product zone assembly rnav have a shear out satetv svstcm 50 U THET is designed to ii'a sar^~ t-v to a different shear out load, as required or desired ty trie system des:grs. i hus. FIG. 5b illustrates a first sealing system 110 in the form of inverted seals 190. The safety system 600 also may comprise an expandable debris barrier 620. in the embodiment shown in FIG. 5b. when the sleeve 612 is activated and the dogs 6!0 are released, the sleeve 612 compresses the debris barrier 620 and cdusts it to expand radially and/or circumferentially and. preferably, contact the casing. A preferred embodiment of the debris barrier 620 comprises ANSI 316 stainless steel wire that has been "bird nested'" or woven to about a 50%, density, as ic. known in the art. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 5b. four (4) debris rings 622. 624. 626. 628 having canted surfaces are assembled about the body to the debris barrier 620.<br>
(0081 j FIG. 6a illustrates formation access valve assembly 114. or frac window. in a production zone assembly 108 and a crossover assembly 232 in a service tool<br><br>
assembly 200. Tool assembly 200 comprises a crossover assembly 21 2 having a through wall port 242 allowing fluid communication from an inside surface of the tool assembly 200 to an outside tool assembly surface. In a preferred embodiment, the through w:all port is formed on an angle of between about 45 to 150 degrees, and more preferably about 120 degrees to the tool center!ine. a downhole orientation. The crossover assembly 212 also comprises an internal sleeve 244 having a seat surface 246 adjacent the port 242. in a preferred embodiment, the sealing surface 246 is adapted to seal against a ball or other substantially spherical object that engages the seat 246. FIG. 6a illustrates a ball 248 in position on the seat 246. This ball/seat sealing arrangement mas. h«: used to activate the setting tool 208 and set the production packer 102. as is conventional. Located below the seat 246 is a circulation port 250. which allo'vs rrou'ation fmm !he tool assembly 200 annulus io the inside conduit of the ^er.";.ce luci av-se?nh!"-; il'O durms run in.<br>
[0082] The internal sleeve 244 is slidable relative to the tool assembly 200 and is held in the position shown in FIG 6a by a shear pin system 240 having combined shear strength of about 4.500 psi. which should be greater than the load generated during packer set and work string separation. The sleeve 2-14 is biased v.-, ay from the port 242. preferably in a downhole direction, by a spring or oilier device <noi shown once pin system has been sheared the sleeve inducing seal and ball are moved out of way port also may comprise a plurality finger which extend above pressure-blocking device fingers have camming surface such that when moves downward to open up crossover cammed inwardly trap as bali in position. ii is desired or other not be able migrate from its position adjacent seat during subsequent well operations. it will appreciated></noi><br>
the biasing element, such as a spring, retains the sleeve 244 in the retracted position after the pin system has been sheared and. therefore, the ball 248 is trapped in the sleeve. Because it may be possible for the ball to migrate from the seat, such as into cross-over port 242 while the fingers 243 are transiting the port 242, it is preferred that at least one finger be deflected inwardly at all times to trap the ball adjacent the seat. Also, it is preferred that the sleeve 244 comprises a debris ring 245. such as a molded rib seal, to prevent debris from fouling operation of the sleeve 244.<br>
[0083{ Alternately, and preferably, as shown in FIG 6b the crossover assembly 212 does not comprise a sleeve 244 and the port 242 is always uncovered on its inside surface. Thus, there is no seat 246 and no need to pressure up ttjahsi ? pressure-blocking device 248. As mentioned above, a lightweight ball ma; be dropped into io I he system and seat upon a structure relatively near iiv ;:•■■;niuci-r:. packer 102. Pressurtzaticn against this bali can be used to set the production packer 102. and then the lightweight ball may be reversed out of the system.<br>
[0084] Still further. FIG. 7 illustrates a hydraulic setting tool for setting the production packer 102 with a cross over assembly like that illustrated in FIG. 6b. The hydraulic setting tool 700 comprises a one-way flow conduit 702. 1 he How conduit 702 comprises a sleeve 704 biased into a no flow condition (e.g.. uphole flow) as shown in FIGs. 7a &amp; b. A sealing surface 706 on the sleeve 704 interacts with a sea! 708 to seal substantially the flow path 702. When the sleeve 704 is pressurized from the flow direction (e.g., downhole flow), the biasing force 7] 0 is overcome and the sleeve moves axially uncovering or opening the flow path 702. When the pressure is reduced to below the biasing force, the one-way valve closes, h will be appreciated that this feature of the hydraulic setting tool facilitates a wash down operation.<br><br>
[0085] Returning to FIGs. 6a and 6b. in a preferred embodiment, a portion of the crossover assembly 212 comprises hardened seal surfaces, such as. but not limited to, nitrided slick joints 247. 249 above and below- the crossover port 242. These slick joints 247, 249 interface with the first and second sealing systems 110. 116 to for a high-pressure seal for pumping and other well operations. At the distal end of the upper slick joint 247, a primary backup autolocator shoulder (not shown) may be formed for actuation of the autolocator 106 should the autolocator profile 210 be out of position.<br>
[0086] A formation access valve assembly 260. or frac window, is also illustrated for the production zone assembly 108. The formation access valve assembly 260 comprises a ihrough-waii fkm port 262 and a siding, sealing sleeve 264. The sliding sleeve has a closing profile 266 located adjacent a proximal enc mn .:■■ opening profile (noi shown) located adjacent a distal end. Suitable v:xU '-r-s provided so that the port 262 is sealed against fluid flow when the body of the sleeve 264 blocks the port 262. The port 262 is preferably elongated relative to the crossover port. 242 so that if autolocator profile 210 on sen ice tool 200 is not engaged in the insert 178 (i.e., groove 176) but rather on top of the insert I"8. fluid communication is still achieved between the crossover port 242 and the frac port 262.<br>
[0087] FIGs. 6a and 6b illustrate the well completion system in the •'Run-In" condition in that tool port 242 is not aligned with the packing port 262 and the. sliding sleeve 264 has sealed off the packing port 262. In a 'Frac .

|0088] FIG. 8 illustrates a second seal system 270 on the production zone assembly 108 located distal of the formation access valve assembh 260. In a preferred embodiment, the second seal system 270 is substantial!} the same as the first seal system 190. The seals 270 are preferably molded elastomeric seals 272 on a metal carrier 274, although other sealing technologies, such as. but not limited to. PTFE, PEEK and/or PEKK may be used. The seal system 270 may be described as "inverted" in that the sealing surfaces 272 are exposed to the inside of the production zone assembly 108. As shown in FIG 8.. a stack of 3 sea! rings is held in a seal recess 276 by a retainer 278. The seal system 270 is adapted to sealingly engage a portion of the tool assembly 200, such as. but not limited to. a slick joint. It will be appreciated that each production zone assembly 108 preferably has a second seal system 270.<br>
iSjfsgO! r[(y 9 illustrates a chcuiaiirig lo-ol shifting ^roiik: ~l'?.:-! sd: vc- ■■-incorporated into a production zone assembly 108 according TO -\y: present invention. The indicating profile 280 has a closing profile 2S'2 that closes a circulation valve 216 in the service tool assembly 200 when the completion system is changed from the 'Trac, Set-down" position to the reversing condition.<br>
(0090j FIG. 10a illustrates a portion of the service tool assembly 200 comprising a closing tool 290. Closing tool 290 comprises a plurality of collet fingers 2M2. preferably 6 to 8. spaced about an outer portion of the tool assembly; 2o0. The collet fingers 292 have a closing profile 294 located approximately mid-length, which is adapted to engage a corresponding structure on production scree r: \ ai\es. such as, but not limited to, for example, on sleeves covering ports, to close such valves when desired. The closing tool 290 further comprises a detent 296 that, in the preferred embodiment requires about a 2 kip load to displace the detent in a downhole direction and about 600 lbf. load to displace the detent in an uphole<br><br>
direction Also shown in FIG. 10a is a going-down shoulder 298 aird a: pick up shoulder 300.<br>
[0091] FIG. 10b illustrates an alternate embodiment of the closing tooi 290. The embodiment shown in FIG 10b comprises profile inserts 295 preferably fabricated from a material having superior anti-galling properties, such as. but not limited to the beryllium copper alloy discussed previously. The insert 295 may be physically fastened to the collet finger 292, such as by threaded fasteners. Additionally, and preferably, the entire collet finger / closing profile assembly may be fabricated from the anti-galling material. The opening tool profiles disclosed below will also benefit from the anti-galling inserts and/or fabrication of the entire collet finger / opening profile assembly from an anti-galling material.<br>
[0092J ilG, 10a also illustrates a circulating vat'-e ;';2 having iiow p-;-;- .

[0093] FIG. 11a illustrates secondary backup autolocator collet assembly 32n. Similarly to the primary backup autolocator shoulder, describe with reference to FIGs. 6a and 6b, the secondary backup autolocator collet 320 may be provided as a convenience measure for the improved completion system. For example, if the tool assembly 200 is pulled above the autolocator 106 while in the "Trac ' Set-down" condition, either the primary backup autolocator shoulder or the secondary backup autolocator collet 320 allows the operator to cycle the indexing system 154 back to the "Run-In" condition. Also, after a well treatment, such as. but noi limited to. a fracturing or gravel packing treatment, the completion tool assembly 200. and specifically closing tool 292. may be pulled up through the autolocator 106 and to engage the autolocator lock out sleeve 180. and specifically profile 181.  As described above, the lock out sleeve ISO moves the auieiocr-no;- "earing<br>
and activate the lock out sleeve 180, the secondary backup 320 cin ircA-cie thn, occurrence by registering a snap through load of about five kips as the collet 320 encounters the bearing 178.<br>
[O094J FIG. lib illustrates a preferred embodiment of a secondjry backup autolocator collet assembly 320. The leftmost drawing shows lite assembly 320 in the "Pick-Up' position; the middle drawing shows the assembly 320 m the "Run-In" condition: and the rightmost drawing shows the assembly 320 in the sheared condition. In the "'Run-in" condition, the collet is not supported by back¬up 321 and is able to deflect out of the way. Mien the system in the "Pick-lip"" condition, the collet 320 is backed-up and is not able to deflect out of the way. The backed-up collet 320 will carry a load dictated by the shear strength of shoulder 333. Shoulder 333 may be set of shear screws, a shear ring or a similar system.   In the preferred embodiment, the backed-up collet assembly 320 can<br><br>
carry about 60 ksi. This load carrying capacity is beneficial if debris has fouled the autolocator system 106 and more load is needed to cycle the system. If the autolocator system 106 cannot be cycled by the collet assembly 320 with 60 ksi. the shoulder 333 will shear loose and the collet 320 will once again not be backed up and free deflect at its designed load.<br>
[0095] Also shown in FIG. 11a is a mock sliding sleeve 340. The mock sleeve 340 has a opening profile 342 and is initially pinned to the lowermost production assembly 108 by shear pins 344 having a combined shear strength of about 3.9 kips. Once the opening tool 330 has been activated (as described below), the mock sleeve 340 may be used to verify that the opening tool 330 has indeed been activated.<br>
[0096] Shown in FIG. 11c is oneninc tool asseniblv 330 disposed on jorurloijoji tool assembly 200- Similar to doling lool 2'*2. opening tool 330 e^rriisc:- _; plurality of collet fingers 332. preferably 6 to 8. spaced about an outer portion of the tool assembly 200. The collet fingers 332 have an opening profile 334. and preferably a selective profile, located approximately mid-length and adapted to engage a corresponding structure on production screen valves, such as. but not limited to. for example, on sleeves covering ports, to open such vaf.es when desired. The opening tool 330 is illustrated in the "Run-hf" condition in FIG. : 1 c and is deactivated. More specifically, the opening tool 330 is coupled to nosepiece 378 and is slidable between stops 338 and 336 relative to tool portion 339. The opening profile 334 is pinned inwardly to tool portion 330. In this deactivated condition, the opening tool 330 will not engage a corresponding profile to open a valve. In a preferred embodiment, the opening tool 330 is pinned to the tool assembly 200 by shear pins 337 having combined shear<br><br>
strength of about 4.6 kips. In the Run-in condition, load is bome by the shoulder 336 and not the shear pins 337.<br>
[0097] As will be recalled from the general discussion of the improved completion system, if it is desired to run in on a work string, it is preferred 10 run the completion tool assembly 200 into the lowermost production assembly 108 while hanging off the rig floor. However, regardless of when the tool assembly 200 is run in, if the opening tool 330 is not deactivated during run in. the normally closed production screen valves may be opened as the tool 200 is lowered. After each valve is opened, the operator must reverse direction to use the closing tool 292 to re-close the opened valve. Thus, deactivating the opening tool 330 in this manner saves time, which in turn saves money. The opening tool 330 may be activated when the completion tool assembly 2o0 engages the oper.:ng :ooI activation assembh' 122. or preferably, hydraulic-ai/;. a..-, discussed bdoV<br>
[0098] FIG. 12 illustrates a portion of a bottom assembly 104 comprising an opening tool activation assembly 122 for use with the improved completion system. The activation assembly may comprise stop collet assembly 350 having a plurality of fingers 352 extending between proximal 354 and distal ?5h base rings. The proximal base ring may be and preferably is shear pinned to a sleeve 360 in the bottom assembly 108 by shear pins having a high strength, such as. but not limited to. for example, about 24 kips. The distal base ring may likewise be shear pinned to the production assembly 108 but preferably at much lower shear strength. For example, in preferred embodiment, the distal base ring is pinned at a shear strength of about 2.6 kips. In the "Run-In" condition, shown on the right half of the sectional drawings, the stop collet 350 is biased inwardly b&gt; land 358. The sleeve 360, to which the stop collet 350 is coupled, is biased by spring 363 in an upward direction.   Sleeve 360 is shear pinned to a ring 364 by a plurality of<br><br>
shear pins 366. Ring 364 limits the amount of upward travel of sleeve 360 through reaction with shoulder 368. Located on a proximal end of the sleeve 360 is an expanding ring 370 having a plurality of lugs 371. During "Run-In" the expandable ring 370 is cammed inwardly into the interior of production assembly 108 by camming surface 372.<br>
[0099] To locate the service tool assembly properly in the completion assembly and to activate the opening tool 200, the service tool assembly 220 is lowered into the completion assembly so that the nosepiece 378 contacts the lugs 371 and drives the lugs downward into the recess formed by shoulder 368 allowing the nosepiece to pass by. The service tool assembly 200 continues dow-ibde until nosepiece 378 and specifically portions 377. contact stop collet lugs 351 Further downward movement of the nosepiece 378 against the stop lugs 35! shears the ■distsi base rins 356 free as the sleeve 36" moves clownnot" w&gt;:n:'e in &gt;hc production assembly 108 and compresses spring 362 as shown in fnc ielimos: cross-section of FIG. 12. Once the stop collet 350 has been sheared tree at the disial ring 356. the lugs 351 are displaced into recess 353 and the nose is allowed to pass by the stop lugs 351. Once the nosepiece 378 by passes the stop lugs 351. the spring 362 causes the sleeve 360 to move upward]}' thereby camming ibe expandable ring 370 inwardly again and retrieving the stop lugs from recess 353.<br>
[00100]	The service tool assembly is retracted and nosepiece portions 379<br>
contact the underside portion of the stop lugs 351. Further uphole movement causes the opening tool assembly to slide relative to the tool assembh and the opening tool is deactivated by shearing pins 337 at about 4.6 kips. Further uphoie movement of the service tool assembly causes the stop lugs to displace into recess 355 and allow the nosepiece to pass by. The nosepiece then contacts the underside of ring lugs 371.   Further uphole movement causes the ring to shear<br><br>
free at bout 8 kips. Once the sleeve 360 is sheared free from the ring, the spring 362 maintains the ring lugs 317 and the stop lugs 351 in their respective recesses.<br>
[00101 [	Also shown in FIG. 12 is an additional seal system 390"-cornprismg<br>
inverted molded seals as described above. These seals may be useful if the pressure test assembly fails to hold pressure. In that event, the lowermost slick joint on the service tool assembly 200 may be lowered to engage this seal system to pressure test the well completion system. Also, as described below, these seals could be used to hydraulically activate an opening tool.<br>
[00102]	FIG. 13 illustrates a preferred embodimenl of an opening tool<br>
asseinbh 330 utilizing hydraulic activation rather than the mechanics! activation described above. Reference numbers are used for similar structures described above. FIG. :3 shows the oneninc tooi t inverted seals to facilitate pressurization of the assembly 300. In this particular embodiment, the tool body comprises a seat system 500 comprising a plurality of balls, such as six (6) 3/8" diameter stainless steel ball bearings 502. The bail may be held in the tool body 339 such that a portion of the balls 502 extend into the tool body 339 passage to form a load-bearing seat. Adjacent the scat is a seal system 540. such as an elastomeric molded seal system. A predetermined distance above the seal system 504 is a bypass/blocking shoulder system 506. A pressure-blocking device 508, such as a stainless steel ball may be placed in the work string during assembly such that it is captured between the seat formed by balls 502 and the blocking shoulder 510. It will be appreciated that downhole flow will cause the pressure device 508 to react against balls 502 and to seal<br><br>
against seal system 504. Uphole flow will cause the pressure device 508 to lift off the seal and react against blocking shoulder 510. However, bypass conduits allow uphole fluid communication.<br>
[00103]	Those of skill in the art will appreciate that the hydraulic pressure<br>
used to activate the opening tool 330 by reaction against the pressure device 508 should be less than the pressure needed to set the isolation packers in the production zone assemblies and less than the pressure to activate a shear safety system, if used. Pressuring against the pressure device 508 causes relative movement between the opening collet 330 and the tool body 399 such that the shear pins 337 are defeated and the opening tool is activated. In the particular embodiment of FIG. 13. the opening tool 330 moves relatively downho'e and uncovers debris port 514 and is locked into position relative to the tool b-.dy 33S; by locking element 516. rlvdrauiic activation also uncovers bvpa-s ~.vir.a ■:;'■'••■? ;:-;-;. which help to keen sand debris away from opening collet 330.<br>
(00104)	FIG. 14 illustrates a pressure test assembly 400 suiiabk- for use<br>
with the improved well completion system. The test sub 400 comprises a pressure-blocking device 402 across the interior of the completion assembly 100. The pressure blocking device 402 illustrated in FIG. 12 may comprise a glass disk having a bursting strength of about 2000 psi. or about four times the pressure used to test the pressure integrity testing of the completion system prior to running into the well. The pressure test sub 400 also comprises a check valve 404. A preferred embodiment of the check valve comprises ports 406 to allow fluid to communicate from the annulus exterior to the production assembly 1 
 <br>
allows well fluids to enter the production assemblies as they are being hung off the rig floor during make up.<br>
[00105]	FIG. 14 also illustrates an indicating collet assembly 125. which<br>
may be attached to the distal end of test assembly 400. The indicating collet 125 may comprise a plurality of fingers 412. such as, but not limited to. four, and each finger may have an indicating profile 414 thereon. The indicating profiles 414 are adapted to snap through reentry guide 416 on the bottom of the sump packer. The reentry guide 416 and indicating profiles 414 are adapted to provide a snap through up load of about 10 kips to positively indicate that the production assembly is correctly positioned in the well bore.<br>
{00106]	FIG. 15 illustrates a preferred nose piece 378 for the service (oo!<br>
assembly 200 ('See FIG. 13'». In (he embodiment shown in FIG. 1 5. ihe iv-e p. eee comprises a dynamic loading system 748 for facilitating rapturing the pressure blocking device 402 (FIG. 14). The dynamic loading system may comprise a pin 750 having a hardened, such as earburized, pointed surface for contacting the pressure-blocking device 402. The pin 750 is housed within .a bod} that permits the pin to move axially. or stroke, a predetermined amount, such as. for example. 2 inches. Initially, the pin 750 is shear pinned to the bod}'. In a preferred embodiment, the pin 750 is sheared pinned 752. 754 to a load of about 4.000 to 5.000 pounds. It will be appreciated that when it is desired to rupture the pressure-blocking device 402, load is applied to the service tool assembly and the pin 750 contact the device 402. If the device 402 does not rupture immediately, the load will exceed the shear strength of the shear pins 752. 754 and the pin 750 will dynamically stroke into the body causing an impact load to be imparted to the device 402.  If the device 402 still has not ruptured, the pin 750 is now" back-up in<br><br>
the body and the hardened point may be used to apply additional load to the pressure-blocking device 402.<br>
[00107]	Referring back to the general discussion of the use and operation<br>
of the improved well completion system, once the well completion system has been made up and pressure tested, and the pressure test assembly open, such as by shattering the glass disk with nosepiece 378, the well completion system may be place in the well bore and each zone sequentially or randomly completed in one downhole trip.<br>
[00108]	As noted previously, some embodiments of the present invention<br>
may comprise running in the completion assembly 100 on the actual production tubing. It will be appreciated that these embodiments are beneficial fox control line applications insofar a^ the ennipieN' and -omeiirnes nrobleman. ■.■■y-woi interface at the production packer can be eliminated. In addition, running hi on production tubing allows full wellbore isolation during substantially all phases of completion activity. FIG. 16 illustrates an embodiment of completion assembly 100 that may be run in on production tubing 810 as the assembly is hung off the rig floor 800. The production tubing and any associated control lines (not shown'1 are coupled, preferably removably, to the production packer 102 by a production tubing seal assembly 820.<br>
[00109]	FIG. 17 illustrates the completion assembly 100 of FIG. 16 after it<br>
has been run into the well on production tubing 810 and positioned relative to the sump packer 840. The production packer 102 has been set by. for example. control line activation. The service tool assembly 200 is illustrated run into position on vvorkstring 830 to treat the well, such by Frac packing thejower most /one. The formation access valve assembly 114 is shown in the opened condition<br><br>
and the ports are aligned with the service tool 200 ports. Fluid flow is illustrated entering the production screen assembly 120 from the annulus. FIG. 18 illustrates the system shown in FIG. 17 in which the lower zone has been isolated and an upper zone is being treated. FIG. 19 illustrates selective production from a lower zone for the completion system illustrated in FIGS. 16-18.<br>
[00110]	It will be appreciated that running in an  embodiment  of the<br>
production assembly 108 on production tubing rather than on a workstring / service tool may be desired in certain environments such as when one or more control line components are used in the completion system 100. Production tubing run-in allows easier and more reliable control line connections and effective)}' eliminates the detailed and complex control line connection at the production packer. Also, ihese embodiments help to minimize formation exposure time, It will be appreciated That the entire completion .iYMcr:". l~u^ 'r..r. operated with control lines, thereby eliminating the need for prima"' iperation with a sen-ice tool. If desired, back-up or emergency operation of the control line completion system with a service tool may be provided.<br>
[00111]	Returning TO a more general discussion of various embodiments<br>
incorporating aspects of the disclosed inventions, those persons of skill in the an having benefit of this disclosure will appreciate that the original service too! position may be known from the original service tool dimensional space out. For example, for those embodiments utilizing down-to-open sleeve valve designs, the open-only shifting profile or tooi may be. for example, about 21 to about 23 feet below the lowermost sleeve and the closing profile may' be about 3 to about 5 feet below the sleeve. A preferred distance between the opening and closing tools is 18 feet. Thus, the opening tool may be about 18 feet plus about 3 to about 5 feet below the lowermost sleeve. To open the sleeve, the shifting tool can be raised to<br><br>
a position somewhere above the sleeve. Downward movement of the shifting too! through the sleeve will open the sieeve. To prevent closing of the sieeve. the operator need only insure that the closing shifting tool does not move below the sleeve. The preferred spacing allows about 18 feet of movement before the closing tool reaches the sieeve. Preferred operations comprise raising the open-only shifting tool up about 3 feet to about 5 feet above the sleeve, and dropping it down about 3 to about 5 feet below the sleeve to open it. Hydraulic verification of an opened sleeve valve may be obtained by closing the annulus and pumping down the tubing to insure communication with the perforations.<br>
[00112]	The upper gravel pack position may be found by locating the<br>
autoiocater profile attached to the top of the sen ice tool in the autoiocater collet located just above the isolation packer. Preferably, the autoiocater collet pro". ides a sienificani. tor example, about 15.1*00 to about 20.000 ib. o'.crp'.tL \::.\\'.?.:']■■ v-when engaged by the autoiocater profile. It is preferred tn.';t this is the - olo ooin.t that moving the service tool through the assembly will register a significant weight increase at surface. This weight increase may occur as the indicator profile engages the corresponding profile on the autoiocater collet fingers. Once the designed overpul! is exceeded, the profile may snap through and will continue moving upward. This tool position may. and preferably should be. \called by comparing the indicating point with pipe figures. Once the profile has been pulled through the collet, downward movement may allow the profile to push the autoiocater collet downward causing it to move to a supported position. This may create a temporary restriction allowing the collet profile to shoulder against the top of the collet and support set down weight. Picking up again about 2 to ? feet and then slacking off indexes the autoiocater collet to an unsupported position allowing the service tool profile to pass through.<br><br>
[00113]	To place the system in the Frac position, the tool mav be picked<br>
up until about a 5.000 to about 8.000 lb overpul! is noted at surface. This overpulf may be used to verify engagement of the profile with the collet. Slack off weight may then be applied to insure that the collet is in the supported posiiion. If there is doubt as to the service tool position, upward pull may be applied to the tool. If the tool is in the correct position, an overpull of about 15,000 to about 20,000 lb should be required. If the tool is incorrectly positioned, there should^be. no little to not overpull required when picking up. The tool may be recycled as necessary to insure proper positioning.<br>
[00114]	One in this position,  the service tool preferably straddles the<br>
inverted seals above the packer and below the closing sleeve thereby effectively isolating the slurry port across from the Frac closing sleeve. Tubing pressure may<br>

and Frac sleeve seals. The profile and collet may support set down weights m excess of about 100.000 lbs making them suitable for use on floating work platforms such as drill ships or semi-submersibles.<br>
[00115]	To open the Frac sleeve, the open only tool may be pulled above<br>
the sleeve and moved back down through it. This is preferably accomplished bv straight pickup and set down movements. The approximate distance from the autolocater profile to the autolocater collet may be. and preferabh is. known as-well as the distance from the autolocater collet to the closing sleeve. For example, the service tool may be picked up about 48 feet to place the open-only tool about 3 feet to about 5 feet above the Frac sleeve. The tool is then moved back down and cycled back to the Frac position, thereby opening the sleeve. This opened condition may be hydraulically verified by pumping down the tubing and either taking returns up the annulus or pumping into the formation.<br><br>
[00116}	To locate the reverse position, the tool may be picked up about 8<br>
feet to about 10 feet, to place the slurry port above the top inverted seals. The lower section of the service tool preferably remains across the Frac sleeve keeping it isolated during reversing operations. This position may he hydraulically verified by pumping down the annulus and monitoring returns up the tubing.<br>
[00117J	To close a sleeve, the closing shifting tool should' be pulled<br>
upwards through the sleeve profile. The service tool may be run back down until it is below the lowest sleeve top being closed. Closing is accomplished by simply moving the service tool slowly through the sleeve. To verify' hydraulically sleeve closure, the annulus may be closed and fluid pumped down the tubing to test the system pressure integrity against the formation.<br>
[00118]	To open the Sower screen-wrapped sleeve in the nexi proximal<br>
zone, the autolocater indication point may be used as a reference to determine the service tool position. Preferably, the lower screen-wrapped sleeve will be positioned about 3 feet to about 5 feet from the top of the autolocater. Picking up the sendee tool abut 55 feet should place the opening tool above the sleeve. The service tool can hen be moved down . preferably about 10 feet to open the slee\ e. The sendee tool may then be picked up to the next convenient connection break ic allow pressure testing. Dimensional space out is not critical as the preferred 18 feet spacing between the opening and closing shifting tools allows a large range of movement while still correctly functioning the sleeve.<br>
[00119]	Embodiments utilizing some or all of the disclosed inventions may<br>
be designed for simple, user-friendly operation. For example, tool positioning for treatment may be easily mechanically identified and hydraulically verified as<br><br>
described above. Position may be maintained by simple application of set down weight. A preferred, simplified operational procedure may comprise: 1) Set sump packer: 2) Perforate one or more zones as needed; 3) Make up and pressure test each production zone assembly and service tool at rig floor: 4) Run the assembly to bottom on a work string or production tubing and locate on sump packer: 5) Set top production / gravel pack packer; 6) Release service tool if assembly run in on work string, or run in service tool: 7) Open lower zone screen wrapped production sleeve and test; 8) Locate Frac / gravel pack position and set lower zone isolation packer; 9) Open lower zone Frac pack sleeve and locate Frac /gravel pack position; 10) Frac lower zone; 11) Pick up and reverse out: 12) Close all Icwer zone sleeves: 13) Pressure test for isolation; 14) Begin next zone by opening lower zone screen wrapped production sleeve and test; 15) Repeat steps 8-13 until last zone is completed; 16) Run production seals into upper production<br>
