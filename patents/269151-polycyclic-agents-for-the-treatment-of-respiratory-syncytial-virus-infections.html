				<td>POLYCYCUC AGENTS FOR THE TREATMENT OF RESPIRATORY<br>
SYNCYTIAL VIRUS INFECTIONS<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to antiviral compounds, methods for their preparation and<br>
compositions containing them, and the use of the compounds and composition in the<br>
treatment of viral infections. In particular, the invention relates to the use of compounds<br>
of formula I for the prevention and/or treatment of respiratory syncytial virus infection and<br>
disease,<br>
Background Art<br>
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of acute upper and lower<br>
respiratory tract infection in adults, young children and infants. Serological evidence<br>
indicates that in the western world approximately 95% of all children have been infected<br>
with RSV by the age of two and 100% of children have been exposed by the time they<br>
reach adulthood (see Black, C.P,, 2003, Resp. Care 48:209-31 for a recent review of the<br>
biology and management of RSV). In most cases the RSV infections will only cause<br>
minor upper respiratory illness with symptoms resembling that of the common cold.<br>
However, severe infection with the virus may result in bronchiolitis or pneumonia which<br>
may result in hospitalization or death. In a given year, around 91,000 infants are<br>
hospitalized with RSV infection in the United States. Infants who have been born<br>
prematurely or have a pre-existing lung disease are a high risk of severe infection and<br>
complications. These infections are responsible for 40 to 50% of hospitalizations for<br>
pediatric bronchiolitis and 25% of hospitalizations for pediatric pneumonia. Since the<br>
immune response to RSV infection is not protective, RSV infections reoccur throughout<br>
adulthood. In adults and older children, RSV infection has been associated with upper<br>
respiratory infection, tracheobronchitis, and otitis media. However, RSV in the<br>
institutionalized elderly can be more serious and is characterized by severe pneumonia and<br><br>
mortality rates of up to 20 and 78%, respectively. Adults with a previous history of heart<br>
or lung conditions are at a high risk for RSV infection. The infection has been linked to<br>
exacerbation of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Significant mortality<br>
has been observed in immunocompromised patients, particularly those undergoing bone<br>
marrow transplantation. (Evans, A.S., eds., 1989, Viral Infections of Humans.<br>
Epidemiology and Control, 3rd ed„ Plenum Medical Book, New York at pages 525-544;<br>
Falsey, A.R., 1991, Infect. Control Hosp. Epidemiol. 12:602-608; and Garvie et al, 1980,<br>
Br. Med. J. 281 ;1253-1254; Hertz et al, 1989, Medicine 68:269-281).<br>
RSV is a member of the order Mononegavirales, which consists of the non-segmented<br>
negative strand RNA viruses in the Families Paramyxoviridae, Rhabdoviridae and<br>
Filoviridae. RSV of humans (often also termed RSV or HRSV) is a member of the<br>
Pneumovirus genus of the sub-family Pneutnovirinae within the Family Paramyxoviridae.<br>
Based on genetic and antigenic variations in the structural proteins, RSV is classified into<br>
two subgroups, A and B (Mufson, M. et al., J. Gen. Virol. 66:2111-2124). Other members<br>
of the Pneumovirus genus include viruses such as bovine RSV (BRSV), ovine RSV<br>
(ORSV) and pneumonia virus of mice (PVM) amongst others. The sub-family<br>
Pneutnovirinae also includes the genus Metapneumovirus which contains the recently<br>
identified and important human pathogen human metapneumovirus (hMPV).<br>
hMPV causes respiratory illness ranging from mild upper respiratory symptoms to severe<br>
lower respiratory disease such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia (van den Hoogen, B et al.,<br>
2001, Nat Med. 7:719-724). Depending on the patient population sampled, between 5 and<br>
15% of respiratory infections in young children may be attributable to hMPV infection<br>
(van den Hoogen, B. et al„ 2003, J. Infect. Dis. 188:1571-1577). hMPV is also associated<br>
with 12 to 50% of otitis media in children (van den Hoogen, et al., 2004, Pediatr. Infect.<br>
Dis. J. 23:S25-S32). In the Netherlands, 55% of tested individuals were seropositive for<br>
hMPV by age 2, and almost all individuals 5 years and older were seropositive (van den<br>
Hoogen, et al., Virology 295:119-132).<br><br>
In addition to the genome features described above, Family characteristics include a lipid<br>
envelope containing one or more glycoprotein species considered to be associated with<br>
attachment and entry of the host cell. Entry is considered to require a process by which<br>
the viral envelope fuses with the membrane of the host cell. Fusion of infected cells with,<br>
for example, their neighbours, can also result in the formation of fused multinucleate cells<br>
known as syncytia in some cases. The fusion process is believed to be glycoprotein<br>
mediated and is a feature shared with diverse enveloped viruses in other taxonomic<br>
groups. In the case of the Paramyxoviridae viruses of all genera characteristically express<br>
a fusion glycoprotein (F) which mediates membrane fusion,<br>
While a RSV licensed vaccine is not yet available, some success has been achieved in the<br>
area of prevention for infants at high risk of serious lower respiratory tract disease caused<br>
by RSV, as well as a reduction of LRI. In particular, there are two immunoglobulin-based<br>
therapies approved to protect high-risk infants from serious LRI: RSV-IGIV (RSV-<br>
immunoglobulin intravenous, also known as RespiGam™) and palivizumab<br>
(SYNAGIS®). RSV-IGIV (RespiGam, Massachusetts Public Health Biological<br>
Laboratories and Medlmmune Inc, Gaithersburg, MD) was licensed by the Food and Drug<br>
Administration in January 1996 for prevention of severe RSV lower respiratory tract<br>
disease in infants and children younger than 24 months with CLD or a history of preterm<br>
birth (535 weeks' gestation). In June 1998, the Food and Drug Administration licensed<br>
palivizumab (Medlmmune, Gaithersburg, MD) for administration as a monthly<br>
intramuscular injection for the prevention of serious respiratory disease caused by RSV in<br>
infants and children with a history of preterm birth (
The only drug currently approved for the treatment of severe RSV is the antiviral<br>
medication, Virazole, also known as Ribavirin currently licensed for therapy of RSV<br>
pneumonia and bronchiolitis (Hall et al, 1983, N. Engl. J, Med., 308: 1443 ; Hall et el,<br>
1985, JAMA, 254:3047. This agent has a broad spectrum antiviral with virustatic effects,<br>
and acts by inhibiting RSV replication. Unfortunately, the agent is toxic so that<br>
administration of the agent is confined to a hospital setting (Black, C.P., 2003, Resp. Care<br>
48(3):209-31). Its administration is further complicated by the need to follow a strict<br><br>
procedural process when administering the agent in order to minimise the likelihood of<br>
certain adverse affects. The agent has a number of adverse effects including sudden<br>
deterioration of respiratory function (bronchiospasm). The efficacy of Virazole has<br>
remained controversial and thus there is a real need to find an alternative agent for the<br>
treatment of RSV infection.<br>

It will be appreciated that compounds of formulae I and la and some derivatives thereof<br>
may have at least one asymmetric centre, and therefore are capable of existing in more<br>
than one stereoisomers form. The invention extends to each of these forms individually<br>
and to mixtures thereof, including racemates. The isomers may be separated by<br>
conventional chromatographic methods or using a resolving agent. Alternatively the<br>
individual isomers may be prepared by asymmetric synthesis using chiral intermediates.<br>
For instance, it will be appreciated that the compounds of the present invention will be<br>
chiral by virtue of the non-equivalent substituent pattern around the C-atom which bears<br>
the Ri substituent. Accordingly, the compounds of the present invention may be presented<br>
as mixtures of enantiomers, for instance, enantiomerically enriched mixtures or racemic<br>
mixtures. Preferably, however, the compounds of the present invention are<br>
"enantiomerically pure."<br>
As used herein with reference to an enantiomer the term "enantiomerically pure" means<br>
that the enantiomer is substantially free of its enantiomeric pair. Enantiomeric purity is<br>
generally expressed in terms of enantiomeric excess or % e.e. For a pair of enantiomers<br>
[(+) and (-)] wherein the mixture of the two is given as the mole or weight fractions F
and F(.) (wherein F(+) + F<. the enantiomeric excess is defined as f></.>
Accordingly, the percentage e.e, is expressed by 100 x |F(+) - F(.)|. As used herein the term<br>
"enantiomerically pure" refers to an enantiomer having a % e.e. of greater than 70%.<br>
Preferably the enantiomerically pure enantiomer has a % e.e. of greater than 80%, more<br>
preferably greater than 90%, and most preferably greater than 95%.<br><br>
The preferred stereoisomer of compounds of formula I which contains a stereogenic centre<br>
at the point of attachment of Ri is depicted by the structure below.<br><br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the absolute configuration (R or S)<br>
designation depends on the priority sequence of each group attached to the stereogenic<br>
centre according to the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog system.<br>
Where the compound has at least one carbon-carbon double bond, it may occur in Z- and<br>
E- forms and all isomeric forms of the compounds are included in the present invention.<br>
The salts of the compounds of formulae I and la are preferably phannaceutically<br>
acceptable, but it will be appreciated that non-pharmaceutically acceptable salts also fall<br>
within the scope of the present invention, since these are useful as intermediates in the<br>
preparation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>
It will be appreciated that pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives of the compounds of<br>
formulae I and la and the salts thereof, are also within the scope and spirit of the<br>
invention. Such derivatives includes pharmaceutically acceptable esters, prodrugs,<br>
solvates and hydrates of the compounds or their salts. Pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
derivatives may include any solvate, hydrate or any other compound or prodrug which,<br>
upon administration to a subject, is capable of providing (directly or indirectly) a<br>
compound of formula I or an antivirally active metabolite or residue thereof.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable salts include acid addition salts, base addition salts, salts<br>
of pharmaceutically acceptable esters and the salts of quaternary amines and pyridiniums.<br>
The acid addition salts are formed from a compound of the invention and a<br><br>
pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic acid including but not limited to<br>
hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, phosphoric, methanesulfonic, toluenesulphonic,<br>
benzenesulphonic, acetic, propionic, ascorbic, citric, malonic, fumaric, raaleic, lactic,<br>
salicyclic, sulfamic, or tartartic acids. The counter ion of quarternary amines and<br>
pyridiniums include chloride, bromide, iodide, sulfate, phosphate, methansulfonate,<br>
citrate, acetate, malonate, furaatate, suifamate, and, tartate. The base addition, salts include<br>
but are not limited to salts such as sodium, potassium, calcium, lithium, magnesium,<br>
ammonium and alkylammonium. Also, basic nitrogen-containing groups may be<br>
quaternised with such agents as lower alkyl halides, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, and<br>
butyl chlorides, bromides and iodides; dialkyl sulfates like dimethyl and diethyl sulfate;<br>
and others. The salts may be made in a known manner, for example by treating the<br>
compound with an appropriate acid or base in the presence of a suitable solvent.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be in crystalline form either as the free compounds<br>
or as solvates (e.g. hydrates) and it is intended that both forms are within the scope of the<br>
present invention. Methods of solvation are generally known within the art.<br>
The term "solvate" is a complex of variable stoichiometry formed by a solute (in this<br>
invention, a compound of the invention) and a solvent. Such solvents preferably do not<br>
interfere with the biological activity of the solute. Solvents may be, by way of example,<br>
water, ethanol or acetic acid. Methods of solvation are generally known within the art.<br>
The term "pro-drug" is used in its broadest sense and encompasses those derivatives that<br>
are converted in vivo to the compounds of the invention Such derivatives would readily<br>
occur to those skilled in the art, and include, for example, compounds where a free<br>
hydroxy group is converted into an ester derivative or a ring nitrogen atom is converted to<br>
an N-oxide. Examples of ester derivatives include alkyl esters, phosphate esters and those<br>
formed from amino acids, preferably valine. Any compound that is a prodrug of a<br>
compound of the invention is within the scope and spirit of the invention. Conventional<br>
procedures for the preparation of suitable prodrugs according to the invention are<br>
described in text books, such as "Design of Prodrugs" Bd. H. Bundgaard, Elsevier, 1985.<br><br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable ester" includes biologically acceptable esters of<br>
compound of the invention such as sulphonic, phosphonic and carboxylic acid derivatives.<br>
Thus, in another aspect of the invention, there is provided a prodrug or pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable ester of a compound of formula I or la.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, there is provided a pharmaceutical composition that<br>
comprises a therapeutically effective amount of one or more of the aforementioned anti-<br>
RSV compounds of formulae I and la, including pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives<br>
thereof, and optionally a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.<br>
Unless otherwise specified the terms "treatment" or "treating", in the context of a method<br>
or use of the invention, includes both therapeutic and prophylactic treatments.<br>
In further aspect of the present invention, there is provided the use of a compound of<br>
formula I or la, or salt thereof for the treatment (therapeutic or prophylactic) of RSV<br>
infections.<br>
Without wanting to be bound by theory it is believed that the compounds of the present<br>
invention exhibit favourable anti-RSV activity by inhibiting the RSV virus's fusion<br>
process.<br>
In a further form of the invention there is provided a process for the production of<br>
compounds of formulae I and la. These compounds may be prepared using the procedure<br>
outlined in the following methods.<br>
Scheme 1 depicts a general process for manufacture of compounds of formula III,<br>
Compounds of formula III are within the scope of the compounds of formula la where R2<br>
is H and serve as useful synthetic intermediates. Compounds of formula III may be<br>
prepared via appropriate starting materials of formula H<br><br><br>
In general, one equivalent of an appropriate keto-acid of formula II is reacted with<br>
approximately 3 equivalents of an appropriate diamine of the general formula H2N-B-C-<br>
NHfe. The mixture is heated under reflux in an inert solvent, such as 1,2-dichloroethane,<br>
toluene or xylenes in a flask that may be fitted with a Dean-Stark apparatus for 3-24 h. A<br>
catalyst, such as an acid tosylate, can be used. After this time the reaction is allowed to<br>
cool and the product filtered and recrystallised from an appropriate solvent. If no<br>
precipitate forms the solvent is evaporated and the residue recrystallised or purified using<br>
flash chromatography or preparative HPLC.<br>
Methods for the preparation of 2-(2'-oxo-2'-aryl)benzoic acids of formula II have been<br>
described by Guion T. S. et al„ 1996, Synthetic Communications, 26; 1753-1762, by<br>
Epsztajn, J. et aL, Synth. Communications, 1992, 22:1239-1247, by Bruggink A. et al.,<br>
Tetrahedron, 1975, 31:2607-2619 and by Ames, D. E. et aL, 1976, J. Chem. Soc. Perkin<br>
Trans. 1,1073-1078.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention, new methods have been developed for the preparation<br>
of certain compounds of formula II and are described herein. Scheme 2 illustrates an<br>
example of a sequence that is useful for the manufacture of keto-acids of formula II<br>
(where X=O and D is -CH2-). Generally, an appropriate aromatic o-halocarboxylic acid is<br>
suspended in tert-butanol or another suitable solvent with approximately 1.5 equivalents<br>
of an appropriate [3-diketone. To mis mixture is added approximately 0.25 equivalents of<br>
copper, copper (I) bromide or copper (I) iodide or both. The suspension is then treated<br>
with approximately 1.6 equivalents of potassium tert-butoxide or sodium ethoxide, sealed<br>
in a pressure-resistant vessel and heated in a microwave reactor with stirring at around<br><br>
180°C for approximately 1 hour. Alternatively, a solvent with a sufficiently high boiling<br>
point (such as JV.JV-dimethylacetamide) may be used and the mixture is heated at reflux in<br>
an open vessel until the substrate has been substantially converted. The resulting mixture<br>
is diluted with water, neutralised with aqueous NH»C1 and extracted with a suitable<br>
organic solvent. The organic extracts are dried and concentrated and the residue may be<br>
purified by flash chromatography. The lactone intermediate is then hydrolysed by<br>
treatment with dilute aqueous hydroxide solution using acetonitrile as a co-solvent.<br><br>
Other compounds of formula II may be prepared by substitution of an a-methylene<br>
ketone. A suitable keto-acid of formula II (where X=O and D is -[CHj],,-) and a catalytic<br>
amount of 18-crown-6 are suspended in THF and cooled to -78°C. The selected alkyl<br>
halide or dihalide (approximately 3 equivalents) and then potassium C-butoxide are added.<br>
The mixture is stirred and allowed to warm to room temperature. When the reaction is<br>
complete, the mixture is cooled again and quenched with a saturated solution of<br>
ammonium chloride and diluted with a small amount of water. The organic layer is<br>
separated and washed with brine, dried over MgSCU and concentrated. The residue may be<br>
purified by recrystallisation or by flash chromatography. This method is an adaptation of<br>
procedures described in J. Org. Chem. 1991, 56:7188-7190.<br>
Other compounds of formula I may be obtained by acylating compounds of formula HI as<br>
illustrated in Scheme 3.<br><br><br>
In one method, two equivalents of diisopropylethylamine or triethylamine are added to<br>
one equivalent of a compound of formula III in THF at 0°C. An acid chloride, or other<br>
acylating agent, is added to the mixture and the reaction monitored by HPLC. When the<br>
reaction is complete the reaction is quenched with water and the product extracted into a<br>
suitable organic solvent and worked up according to standard methods. Similar acylation<br>
may also be carried out by reacting one equivalent of the compound of formula III with<br>
one equivalent of the appropriate acid chloride in xylene at I20°C for l-24h. The reaction<br>
is then allowed to cool and the product isolated. Alternatively, compounds of formula HI<br>
may be treated with approximately 2.2 equivalents of an appropriate acid chloride or<br>
anhydride in pyridine at approximately -5°C. The mixture is allowed to warm to room<br>
temperature and after stirring for 2-24h the product is isolated by standard methods,<br>
Acylation may also be achieved by treating the appropriate compound of formula III with<br>
the appropriate carboxylic acid (3 equivalents), TFFH (3.3 equivalents) and DIEA (3,3<br>
equivalents) in DMF and heating to 45°C for approximately 14 days, After this time the<br>
product is isolated by standard methods.<br>
N-alkylated and N-sulfonylated compounds of formula I are best obtained using suitable<br>
N-substituted diamines. These may be prepared by known methods for example that are<br>
described by Kruse L. I., et al., J. Med. Chem. 1990, 33, 781-789. The appropriate keto-<br>
acid (2 equivalents) and N-substituted diamine (1 equivalent) in chlorobenzene, toluene or<br>
xylene are placed in a flask equipped with a stirrer and Dean-Stark water separator and<br>
heated at reflux until no further water is seen to separate (1 - 8 h) (Scheme 4). The solvent<br>
is then removed and the residue can be purified using standard methods.<br><br><br>
Scheme 4<br>
To prepare compounds of formula I where R2 is a urea or thiourea, one equivalent of the<br>
appropriate compound of formula III is reacted with one equivalent of the appropriate<br>
isocyanate or isothiocyanate in an inert solvent such as THF or xylene at a temperature<br>
ranging from 20-120°C for 1-24 h. The reaction is then allowed to cool and the product is<br>
filtered, washed and either recrystallised from an appropriate solvent or purified using<br>
chromatography.<br>
Other compounds of formula I can be prepared by the addition, removal or modification of<br>
existing substituents. This could be achieved by using standard techniques for functional<br>
group inter-conversion that are well known in the industry, such as those described in<br>
"Comprehensive organic transformations: a guide to functional group preparations" by<br>
Larock R. C, New York, VCH Publishers, Inc. 1989.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
The invention also pertains to therapeutic compositions for the prevention and/or<br>
treatment of RSV, containing at least one compound of formula I or la including<br>
pharmaceutical acceptable salts or prodrugs.<br>
It is contemplated that the compositions of the invention may further contain or be<br>
administered with one or more other compounds having anti-viral activity in respect of<br>
RSV, such as Virazole®, or other agents such as RespiGam™ or Synagis®.<br>
It is contemplated that the compositions of the invention may further contaia or be<br>
administered in combination with other drugs to treat symptoms of the disease, such as for<br>
example anti-inflammatory medicaments, such as diclofenac, diflunisal, etodolac,<br>
fenoprofen, flurbiprofen, ibuprofen, indomethacin, ketoprofen, ketorolac, mefanamic acid,<br>
meloxicam, nabumetone, naproxen, oxaprozin, piroxicam, salsalate, sulindac, tolmetin.<br>
It is contemplated that the compositions of the invention may further contain or be<br>
administered with other drugs to treat symptoms of the disease, such as for example,<br>
steroids such as short-acting beta-agonists: albuterol, levalbuterol, bitolterol, pirbuterol,<br>
terbutaline, ipratropium bromide, prednisone, prednisolone, and methylprednisolone;<br>
long-acting beta-agonists, such as salmeterol or formoterol; leukotriene modifiers, such as<br>
monoleukast, zafirlukast, and zileuton; theophyllines; nedocromils, and cromolyns.<br><br>
The term "composition" is intended to include the formulation of an active ingredient with<br>
conventional carriers and excipients, and also with encapsulating materials as the carrier,<br>
to give a capsule in which the active ingredient (with or without other carriers) is<br>
surrounded by the encapsulation carrier.<br>
As will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art, the route of administration and<br>
the nature of the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier will depend on the nature of the<br>
condition and the animal to be treated. It is believed that the choice of a particular carrier<br>
or delivery system, and route of administration could be readily determined by a person<br>
skilled in the art. In the preparation of any formulation containing the compounds care<br>
can be taken to ensure that the activity of the compound is not destroyed in the process<br>
and that the compound is able to reach its site of action without being destroyed. In some<br>
circumstances it may be necessary to protect the compound by means known in the art,<br>
such as, for example, micro encapsulation. Similarly the route of administration chosen<br>
can be such that the compound reaches its site of action.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions or formulations include those suitable for oral, rectal,<br>
nasal, topical (including buccal and sub-lingual), vaginal or parenteral (including<br>
intramuscular, sub-cutaneous and intravenous) administration or in a form suitable for<br>
administration by inhalation or insufflation. It is envisaged that the compositions may be<br>
provided in a form suitable for oral or nasal administration or by inhalation or insufflation.<br>
The compounds of the invention, together with a conventional adjuvant, carrier, or diluent,<br>
may thus be placed into the form of pharmaceutical compositions and unit dosages<br>
thereof, and in such form may be employed as solids, such as tablets or filled capsules, or<br>
liquids such as solutions, suspensions, emulsions, elixirs, or capsules filled with the same,<br>
all for oral use, in the form of suppositories for rectal administration; or in the form of<br>
sterile injectable solutions for parenteral (including subcutaneous) use.<br><br>
Such pharmaceutical compositions and unit dosage forms thereof may comprise<br>
conventional ingredients in conventional proportions, with or without additional active<br>
compounds or principles, and such unit dosage forms may contain any suitable effective<br>
amount of the active ingredient commensurate with the intended daily dosage range to be<br>
employed. Formulations containing ten (10) milligrams of active ingredient or, more<br>
broadly, 0,1 to one hundred (100) milligrams, per tablet, are accordingly suitable<br>
representative unit dosage forms.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be administrated in a wide variety of oral and<br>
parenteral dosage forms. It will be understood to those skilled in the art that the following<br>
dosage forms may comprise, as the active component, either a compound of the invention<br>
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a compound of the invention.<br>
For preparing pharmaceutical compositions from the compounds of the present invention,<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can be either solid or liquid. Solid form preparations<br>
may include powders, tablets, pills, capsules, cachets, suppositories, and dispensable<br>
granules. A solid carrier can be one or more substances which may also act as diluents,<br>
flavouring agents, solubilisers, lubricants, suspending agents, binders, preservatives, tablet<br>
disintegrating agents, or an encapsulating material.<br>
For example, in powders, the carrier is a finely divided solid that is in a mixture with the<br>
finely divided active component.<br>
For example, in tablets, the active component is mixed with the carrier having the<br>
necessary binding capacity in suitable proportions and compacted in the shape and size<br>
desired.<br>
The powders and tablets preferably contain from five or ten to about seventy percent of<br>
the active compound. Suitable carriers may be magnesium carbonate, magnesium<br>
stearate, talc, sugar, lactose, pectin, dextrin, starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methylcellulose,<br>
sodium carboxymethylcelhlose, a low melting wax, cocoa butter, and the like. The term<br><br>
"preparation" is intended to include the formulation of the active compound with<br>
encapsulating material as carrier providing a capsule in which the active component, with<br>
or without carriers, is surrounded by a carrier, which ia thus in association with it.<br>
Similarly, cachets and lozenges are included. Tablets, powders, capsules, pills, cachets,<br>
and lozenges can be used as solid forms suitable for oral administration.<br>
For preparing suppositories, a low melting wax, such as admixture of fatty acid glycerides<br>
or cocoa butter, is first melted and the active component is dispersed homogeneously<br>
therein, as by stirring. The molten homogenous mixture is then poured into convenient<br>
sized moulds, allowed to cool, and thereby to solidify.<br>
Formulations suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, tampons,<br>
creams, gels, pastes, foams or sprays containing in addition to the active ingredient such<br>
carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.<br>
Liquid form preparations include solutions, suspensions, and emulsions, for example,<br>
water or water-propylene glycol solutions. For example, parenteral injection liquid<br>
preparations can be formulated as solutions in aqueous polyethylene glycol solution.<br>
Sterile liquid form compositions include sterile solutions, suspensions, emulsions, syrups<br>
and elixirs. The active ingredient can be dissolved or suspended in a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier, such as sterile water, sterile organic solvent or a mixture of both.<br>
The compositions according to the present invention may thus be formulated for parenteral<br>
administration (e.g. by injection, for example bolus injection or continuous infusion) and<br>
may be presented in unit dose form in ampoules, pre-filled syringes, small volume<br>
infusion ox in multi-dose containers with an added preservative. The compositions may<br>
take such forms as suspensions, solutions, or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and<br>
may contain formulation agents such as suspending, stabilising and/or dispersing agents.<br>
Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form, obtained by aseptic isolation<br><br>
of sterile solid or by lyophilisation from solution, for constitution with a suitable vehicle,<br>
eg. sterile, pyrogen-free water, before use.<br>
Pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile injectable solutions or<br>
dispersions, and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable<br>
solutions. They can be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and may be<br>
preserved against oxidation and the contaminating action of microorganisms such as<br>
bacteria or fungi.<br>
Those skilled in the art may readily determine appropriate formulations for the compounds<br>
of the present invention using conventional approaches. Identification of preferred pH<br>
ranges and suitable excipients, for example antioxidants, is routine in the art. Buffer<br>
systems are routinely used to provide pH values of a desired range and include carboxylic<br>
acid buffers for example acetate, citrate, lactate and succinate. A variety of antioxidants<br>
are available for such formulations including phenolic compounds such as BHT or vitamin<br>
E, reducing agents such as methionine or sulphite, and metal chelators such as EDTA.<br>
The solvent or dispersion medium for the injectable solution or dispersion may contain<br>
any of the conventional solvent or carrier systems for the compounds, and may contain,<br>
for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol and liquid<br>
polyethylene glycol, and the like), suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils. The<br>
proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by<br>
the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of<br>
surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about where<br>
necessary by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example,<br>
parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, tbimerosal and the like. In many cases, it<br>
will be preferable to include agents to adjust osmolality, for example, sugars or sodium<br>
chloride. Preferably, the formulation for injection will be isotonic with blood. Prolonged<br>
absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the<br>
compositions of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminium monostearate and<br>
gelatin. Pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use may be delivered by any<br><br>
appropriate route including intravenous, intramuscular, intracerebral, intrathecal, epidural<br>
injection or infusion.<br>
Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the active compounds in the<br>
required amount in the appropriate solvent with various other ingredients such as these<br>
enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions<br>
are prepared by incorporating the various sterilised active ingredient into a sterile vehicle<br>
which contains the basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those<br>
enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable<br>
solutions, preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying or freeze-drying of a<br>
previously sterile-filtered solution of the active ingredient plus any additional desired<br>
ingredients.<br>
When the active ingredients are suitably protected they may be orally administered, for<br>
example, with an inert diluent or with an assimilable edible carrier, or it may be enclosed<br>
in hard or soft shell gelatin capsule, or it may be compressed into tablets, or it may be<br>
incorporated directly with the food of the diet. For oral therapeutic administration, the<br>
active compound may be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of ingestible<br>
tablets, buccal tablets, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, and the like.<br>
Such compositions and preparations preferably contain at least 1% by weight of active<br>
compound. The percentage of the compositions and preparations may, of course, be<br>
varied and may conveniently be between about 5 to about 80% of the weight of the unit<br>
The amount of active compound in therapeutically useful compositions can be sufficient<br>
that a suitable dosage will be obtained.<br>
The tablets, troches, pills, capsules and the like may also contain the components as listed<br>
hereafter: a binder such as gum, acacia, corn starch or gelatin; excipients such as<br>
dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid<br>
and the like; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; and a sweetening agent such a<br>
sucrose, lactose or saccharin may be added or a flavouring agent such as peppermint, oil<br><br>
of wintergreen, or cherry flavouring. When the dosage unit form is a capsule, it may<br>
contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier.<br>
Various other materials may be present as coatings or to otherwise modify the physical<br>
form of the dosage unit. For instance, tablets, pills, or capsules may be coated with<br>
shellac, sugar or both. A syrup or elixir may contain the active compound, sucrose as a<br>
sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and flavouring such<br>
as cherry or orange flavour. Any material used in preparing any dosage unit form can be<br>
pharmaceutically pure and substantially non-toxic in the amounts employed. In addition,<br>
the active compound(s) may be incorporated into sustained-release preparations and<br>
formulations, including those that allow specific delivery of the active peptide to specific<br>
regions of the gut.<br>
Aqueous solutions suitable for oral use can be prepared by dissolving the active<br>
component in water and adding suitable colorants, flavours, stabilising and thickening<br>
agents, as desired.<br>
Aqueous suspensions suitable for oral use can be made by dispersing the finely divided<br>
active component in water with viscous material, such as natural or synthetic gums, resins,<br>
methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, or other well known suspending agents.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and/or diluents include any and all solvents,<br>
dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption<br>
delaying agents and the like. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutical active<br>
substances is well known in the art. Except in so far as any conventional media or agent is<br>
incompatible with the active ingredient, use thereof in the therapeutic compositions is<br>
contemplated. Supplementary active ingredients can also be incorporated into the<br>
compositions.<br>
Also included are solid form preparations that are intended to be converted, shortly before<br>
use, to liquid form preparations for oral administration. Such liquid forms include<br><br>
solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. These preparations may contain, in addition to the<br>
active component, colorants, flavours, stabilisers, buffers, artificial and natural sweeteners,<br>
dispersants, thickeners, solubilising agents, and the like.<br>
For topical administration to the epidermis the compounds according to the invention may<br>
be formulated as ointments, creams or lotions, or as a transdermal patch. Ointments and<br>
creams may, for example, be formulated with an aqueous or oily base with the addition of<br>
suitable thickening and/or gelling agents. Lotions may be formulated with an aqueous or<br>
oily base and will in general also contain one or more emulsifying agents, stabilising<br>
agents, dispersing agents, suspending agents, thickening agents, or colouring agents.<br>
Formulations suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges comprising<br>
active agent in a flavoured base, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles<br>
comprising the active ingredient in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerin or sucrose<br>
and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active ingredient in a suitable liquid carrier.<br>
Solutions or suspensions are applied directly to the nasal cavity by conventional means,<br>
for example with a dropper, pipette or spray. The formulations may be provided in single<br>
or multidose form. In the latter case of a dropper or pipette, this may be achieved by the<br>
patient administering an appropriate, predetermined volume of the solution or suspension.<br>
In the case of a spray, this may be achieved for example by means of a metering atomising<br>
spray pump. To improve nasal delivery and retention the compounds according to the<br>
invention may be encapsulated with cyclodextrins, or formulated with other agents<br>
expected to enhance delivery and retention in the nasal mucosa.<br>
Administration to the respiratory tract may also be achieved by means of an aerosol<br>
formulation in which the active ingredient is provided in a pressurised pack with a suitable<br>
propellant such as a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) tor example dichlorodifluoromethane,<br>
tricWorofluoromethane, or dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide, or other suitable gas.<br>
The aerosol may conveniently also contain a surfactant such as lecithin. The dose of drug<br>
may be controlled by provision of a metered valve.<br><br>
Alternatively the active ingredients may be provided in the form of a dry powder, for<br>
example a powder mix of the compound in a suitable powder base such as lactose, starch,<br>
starch derivatives such as hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose and polyvinylpyrrolidone<br>
(PVP). Conveniently the powder carrier will form a gel in the nasal cavity. The powder<br>
composition may be presented in unit dose form for example in capsules or cartridges of,<br>
e.g., gelatin, or blister packs from which the powder maybe administered by means of an<br>
inhaler.<br>
In formulations intended for administration to the respiratory tract, including intranasal<br>
formulations, the compound will generally have a small particle size for example of the<br>
order of 5 to 10 microns ot less. Such a particle size may be obtained by means known in<br>
the art, for example by micronisation.<br>
When desired, formulations adapted to give sustained release of the active ingredient may<br>
be employed.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations are preferably in unit dosage forms. In such form, the<br>
preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active<br>
component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing<br>
discrete quantities of preparation, such as packeted tablets, capsules, and powders in vials<br>
or ampoules. Also, the unit dosage form can be a capsule, tablet, cachet, or lozenge itself,<br>
or it can be the appropriate number of any of these in packaged form.<br>
It is especially advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for<br>
ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to<br>
physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subjects to be treated; each unit<br>
containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired<br>
therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The<br>
specification for the dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by and directly<br>
dependent on (a) the unique characteristics of the active material and the particular<br><br>
therapeutic effect to be achieved, and (b) the limitations inherent in the art of<br>
compounding such an active material for the treatment of disease in living subjects having<br>
a diseased condition in which bodily health is impaired.<br>
The invention also includes the compounds of formula I, la, II, in the absence of carrier<br>
where the compounds are in unit dosage form,<br>
The amount of compound of formula I administered may be in the range from about 10<br>
mg to 2000 mg per day, depending on the activity of the compound and the disease to be<br>
treated.<br>
Liquids or powders for intranasal administration, tablets or capsules for oral<br>
administration and liquids for intravenous administration are the preferred compositions,<br>
Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the invention described herein is susceptible to<br>
variations and modifications other than those specifically described. It is to be understood<br>
that the invention includes all such variations and modifications which fall within the<br>
spirit and scope. The invention also includes all of the steps, features, compositions and<br>
compounds referred to or indicated in this specification, individually or collectively, and<br>
any and all combinations of any two or more of said steps or features.<br>
The reference in this specification to any prior publication (or information derived from<br>
it), or to any matter which is known, is not, and should not be taken as an<br>
acknowledgment or admission or any form of suggestion that that prior publication (or<br>
information derived from it) or known matter forms part of the common general<br>
knowledge in the field of endeavour to which this specification relates.<br>
Throughout this specification and the claims which follow, unless the context requires<br>
otherwise, the word "comprise", and variations such as "comprises" and "comprising",<br>
will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or step or group of integers or<br>

Experimental<br>
Synthetic procedures<br>
lH NMR spectra were recorded on either a Bruker Avance DRX 400, AC 200 or AM 300<br>
spectrometer. Spectra were recorded in CDCl3,&gt; d6-acetone, CD3OD or d6-DMSO using<br>
the residual solvent peak as a reference. Chemical shifts are reported on the 8 scale in<br>
parts per million (ppm) using the following conventions to assign the multiplicity: s<br>
(singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), q (quartet) m (multiplet) and prefixed b (broad). Mass<br>
spectra (ESI) were recorded on a Finnigan LCQ Advantage spectrometer. Flash<br>
chromatography was performed on 40-63um silica gel 60 (Merck No. 9385). Preparative<br>
HPLC was carried out using a Gilson 322 pump with a Gilson 215 liquid handler and a<br>
HP 1100 PDA detector. Unless stated otherwise, HPLC systems employed Phenomenex<br>
C8(2) columns using water containing 0.1% TFA and either acetonitrile or acetonitrile<br>
containing 0.06% TFA.<br>
Method A<br>
One equivalent of an appropriate keto-acid of formula II or its ester analogue is reacted<br>
with approximately 3 equivalents of an appropriate diamine of the general formula HjN-<br>
B-C-NH2. The mixture is heated under reflux in an inert solvent, such as 1,2-<br>
dichloroethane, toluene or xylene, in a flask that may be fitted with a Dean-Stark<br>
apparatus for 1-24 h or until no more water is being collected in the trap. A catalyst, such<br>
as an acid tosylate, can be used. After this time the reaction is allowed to cool and the<br>
product filtered and recrystallised from an appropriate solvent. If no precipitate forms the<br>
solvent is evaporated in vacuo and the residue recrystallised or purified using flash<br>
chromatography or preparative HPLC.<br>
This method for forming compounds of formula III is an adaptation of procedures<br>
described in US 4,058,529, Sulkowski, T.S., et al., 1967, J, Org. Chem., 32:2180-2184 and<br>

Method 8<br>
Two equivalents of diisopropylethylamine or triethylamine are added to one equivalent of<br>
a compound of formula III in THF or other suitable inert solvent at 0°C. An isocyanate,<br>
isothiocyanate, acid chloride or other aoylating agent is added to the mixture and the<br>
reaction monitored by HPLC. When complete, the reaction is quenched with water and<br>
the product extracted into EtOAc. The EtOAc is subsequently washed with solutions of<br>
1:1 sat. NH4Cl(aq)/water, 1:1 sat. Na2CO3(aq)/water and sat. Na2CO3(aq). The EtOAc is dried<br>

One equivalent of the appropriate compound of formula III is allowed to react with one<br>
equivalent of the appropriate acid chloride or alternative acylating agent in a suitable inert<br>
solvent, such as toluene, in the presence of a non-nucleophilic base, such as triethylamine,<br>
at elevated temperature until the reaction is substantially complete. An acyl transfer<br>
reagent, such as iVliV-dimethyl-4-aminopyridine, may also be added to the reaction<br>
mixture. The mixture is then allowed to cool and the product filtered and recrystallised<br>
from an appropriate solvent. If no precipitate is formed die reaction is purified using flash<br>

Method D<br>
N-substituted diamines may be prepared according to methods that will be well known to<br>
persons skilled in the art. One such procedure is outlined in Kruse L.I., et al„ 1990, J.<br>
Med. Chem., 33:781-789.<br>
An appropriate compound of Formula n (2 equivalents) and TV-substituted diamine of<br>

Method E<br>
One equivalent of the appropriate compound of formula HI is reacted with one equivalent<br>
of the appropriate isocyanate or isothiocyanate in THF or xylene at a temperature ranging<br>
from 20-120°C for 1 - 48h. The reaction is then allowed to cool and the product filtered,<br>
washed and recrystallised from an appropriate solvent. If no precipitate forms then the<br>
product may be purified using flash chromatography or preparative HPLC.<br>
Method F<br>
The appropriate isocyanate, isothiocyanate, sulfonyl chloride, acid chloride, anhydride or<br>
alternative acylating agent (2.2eq) is added directly for liquids or as a solution in pyridine<br>
(~1M) for solids to a solution of the appropriate compound of formula III (O.lmmol) in<br>
pyridine (500pL) at -5°C. The reaction is stirred and allowed to warm to room<br>
temperature for 2-24 h. The reaction is subsequently diluted with water and extracted<br>
three times with CH2CI2 or other suitable organic solvent. The combined organic extracts<br>
are washed with IN NaOH (3x) and 10% HC1 (3x). In the case of basic products the acid<br>
wash is omitted and in the case of acidic products the basic wash is omitted. For neutral<br>
or basic products the crude purity may be improved by stirring the combined CH2CI2<br>
extract in the presence of a polymer-supported base (such as MP-carbonate resin,<br>
Argonaut Technologies Inc.) for 0.5-12h. The CH2CI2 extracts are dried (MgSO,)) and the<br>
solvent evaporated in vacuo. The crude products are subsequently purified by flash<br>
chromatography.<br><br><br><br>

Biological data<br>
Method P: RSV Antiviral Assay Protocol<br>
Compounds of the invention were tested for their antiviral activity against respiratory<br>
syncytial virus. Cytopathic effect (CPE) assays were performed essentially as described in<br>
the literature (see for example Watanabe et al, 1994, J. Virological Methods, 48:257).<br>
Serial dilutions of the test compounds were made in 96 well plates. HEp2 cells (1.0 x 10*<br>
cells/well) were infected with RSV at a low multiplicity of infection (e.g. RSV A2 at an<br>
moi of ~0.01) and added to plates to assess antiviral activity. Uninfected HEp2 cells were<br>
used to assess compound cytotoxicity. Assays were incubated for 5 days at 37°C in a 5%<br><br>
CO2 atmosphere. The extent of CPE was determined via metabolism of the vital dye 3-(4,<br>
5-dimethylthiaxol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT). MTT (lmg/ml) was<br>
added to each well and plates incubated for 2 hours incubation at 37°C. Wells were<br>
aspirated, teo-propanol (200uL) was added and absorbance values read at 540/690nm.<br>
Compound concentrations that inhibited CPE by 50% (BCJO) and developed cytotoxicity<br>
(CCJO) were calculated using non-linear regression analysis.<br>
Representative data for compounds of the invention against RSV A2 are shown in Tables<br>
4 and 5 where ECso values lie in the ranges A: 
andD:&gt;5.0uM.<br><br><br><br>
Method Q: RSV Fusion Assay<br>
Selected compounds of the invention can be tested for their ability to inhibit the essential<br>
fusion processes of the respiratory syncytial virus.<br>
Generation of RSV-F constructs<br>
Single-stranded synthetic DNA oligonucleotides encoding the portions of RSV A2 F<br>
glycoprotein incorporating optimal codons and without potential poly(A) addition or<br>
splice sites were generated synthetically (Mason et al, WO0242326). A membrane-<br>
anchored full-length F was generated essentially according to the method described<br>
therein and in Morton et al.<br><br>
Syncytium formation assay<br>
Fusion activity of the RSV-F constructs was measured in 293 cells essentially according to<br>
the method described in Morton et al, 2003, Virology, 311:275. For example: cells in six<br>
well plates at approximately 80% confluency were transfected by adding plasmid DNA (2<br>
µg/well) carrying the constructs of interest in CaPO4 solution for 4 hours. After glycerol<br>
shock and wash, the transfected cells were trypsinized and 1,5 x 104 cells/well added to<br>
96-well plates containing half-log serial dilutions of the test compound. Syncytium<br>
formation was evaluated by visual inspection and quantified at 48 hours post-transfection<br>
by addition of 20 uL of CellTiter 96 One Solution (Promega) followed by incubation for 4<br>
hours at 37°C. The colour reaction was then stopped by addition of 25 uL 10% SDS to<br>
each well and absorbance values read at 540/690nm, The compound concentration that<br>
reduced absorbance relative to untreated control cultures by 50% (EC50) was calculated<br>
using non-linear regression analysis.<br>
Method R: RSV Cotton Rat Model<br>
The cotton rat model was performed essentially as described in the literature (Wyde et al,<br>
2003, Antiviral Res., 60:221). Briefly, cotton rats weighing 50-100 g were lightly<br>
anesthetized with isoflurane and dosed orally with 100 mg/kg/day of compound or vehicle<br>
control. Viral infection followed 2 hours post-treatment in similarly anesthetized rats by<br>
intranasal instillation with approximately 1000 TCID50 of RSV A2 per animal. Four days<br>
after virus inoculation, each cotton rat was sacrificed and their lungs removed and RSV<br>
titres determined by plaque assay.<br>
Method S: RSV Balb/c Mouse Model<br>
The mouse model was performed essentially as described by Cianci et al, 2004,<br>
Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy., 48:413). Briefly, eight week old female Balb/c<br>
mice were weighed, anesthetized intraperitoneally with Avertin™ and compound or<br>
vehicle administered orally 6 hours preinfection. Mice were inoculated intranasally with<br><br>
approximately 10000 TCID50 RSV A2 per animal. Three days after virus inoculation, each<br>
mouse was sacrificed and their lungs removed and RSV titres determined by plaque assay.<br><br>
