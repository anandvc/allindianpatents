				<td>Title:        Process and reactor for anaerobic waste water purification<br>
The present invention is in the area of biological waste water<br>
purification and more in particular in the use of sludge bed systems in<br>
anaerobic waste water purification.<br>
Biological wastewater treatment uses active biomass (bacteria) to<br>
convert the pollutants (organic substances) to harmless components.<br>
Basically there are two types of bacteria that can perform this<br>
treatment. For so-called anaerobic treatment (without oxygen) a consortia of<br>
anaerobic bacteria convert pollutants substantially to biogas.<br>
In aerobic treatment the pollutants are reduced under aerobic (with<br>
oxygen) conditions for a great extend to new bacteria / biomass (surplus<br>
sludge) which needs then to be separated from the treated wastewater and<br>
processed separately.<br>
Anaerobic sludge bed reactor systems utilise anaerobic bacteria to<br>
convert pollutants in wastewater to biogas. These anaerobic bacteria mainly<br>
grow in aggregates, often referred to as granular biomass. The systems are<br>
often characterised by low net biomass production (typically 2-4 % of converted<br>
COD) as a result of the low net yield of anaerobic bacteria involved.<br>
This is on one hand a big advantage, as the excess biomass<br>
developed in wastewater treatment systems has to be disposed as a solid<br>
waste, at significant cost, but it makes on the other hand a sensitive aspect to<br>
retain / maintain sufficient active biological sludge in the treatment system<br>
(reactor).<br>
The method of retaining biomass in anaerobic treatment reactors<br>
can be done in various ways. The immobilization of biomass on a fixed or<br>
mobile carrier is one method to uncouple liquid retention time from biomass<br>
retention time.<br><br>
A better and preferred method however is to make use of mainly-<br>
granulated biomass as applied in UASB, EGSB and IC reactors.<br>
To date more than 85% of any new industrial applications for high<br>
rate anaerobic treatment are based on anaerobic sludge bed technologies<br>
(Frankin R.J. (2001). Full scale experiences with anaerobic treatment of<br>
industrial wastewater. Wat Sci. Tech., 44(8), 1-6).<br>
The purification process generally comprises the use of a system<br>
wherein raw wastewater is introduced at the bottom of an upflow reactor,<br>
containing dispersed biomass in (partly purified) wastewater. During the<br>
anaerobic purification process biogas is produced and a mixture of liquid<br>
(water), solids (biomass) and gas flows upward in the reactor. Before purified<br>
wastewater can be discharged, a gas-liquid-solid separation has to take place.<br>
A typical system for such a process is based on a conditioning tank<br>
to which the raw waste water is fed. A recycle of anaerobic effluent from the<br>
reactor is also fed (normally by gravity) to the conditioning tank. From the<br>
conditioning tank the mixture is introduced into the base of an upflow reactor<br>
through a special design influent distribution system. Subsequently the water<br>
flows upwards through the dense anaerobic sludge bed. Soluble COD is readily<br>
converted to biogas which is rich in methane and an upward circulation of<br>
water and gas borne sludge is established. The specially constructed three<br>
phase separator sections at the top of the reactor first of all allow effective<br>
degasification to occur. Next the solids particles, now devoid of attached gas<br>
bubbles, sink back to the bottom of the three phase separator and are returned<br>
to the reactor.<br>
In sludge bed reactors the biomass is retained by virtue of the good<br>
settleability of such biomass and the use of a three phase separator or three<br>
phase separators in the reactor that can effectively separate (from the treated<br>
wastewater and the produced biogas) and retain such biomass in the reactor.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide an improved<br>
anaerobic wastewater treatment process based on sludge bed technology.<br><br>
This is achieved by using a process and a reactor for anaerobic<br>
wastewater treatment with one or more of the following features of the<br>
improved system, which features comprise:<br>
•    Improved sludge retention and performance by using an<br>
o   Improved anaerobic effluent recycle method<br>
o   improved three phase separator or three phase separators with:<br>
•	Tilted plates, tubes or other internals installed in the three<br>
phase separator body to increase the effective settling<br>
surface.<br>
•	In process cleaning facilities for the three phase separator<br>
or three phase separators and the internals.<br>
•	Multi plate gas separation baffles under the three phase<br>
separator or three phase separators to make the gas<br>
separation more effective.<br>
o   Improved influent distribution system(s).<br>
In a first aspect the present invention resides in an improved<br>
separation of the solids for the liquid. In this embodiment a three phase<br>
separator is used, having tilted plates, tubes or other tilted internals installed<br>
in the three phase separator body with the aim to increase the effective<br>
settling surface without changing the volume.<br>
Accordingly the invention is defined as a process for the anaerobic<br>
purification of waste water using a sludge bed system, which process<br>
comprises feeding waste water, and optionally recycle water, to the lower part<br>
of an upflow reactor, containing mainly granular biomass thus producing<br>
biogas in the treatment passing the resulting gas- liquid- solid mixture upward<br>
and separating the gas and solid from the liquid in a three phase separator<br>
and thereby generating an anaerobic effluent that is withdrawn from the-top of<br>
the separator, the improvement comprising separating the solids form the<br>
liquid in a separator, wherein, above the separation of the gas from the liquid<br><br>
phase, tilted plates, tubes or other tilted internals are installed in the three<br>
phase separator body to increase the effective settling surface.<br>
In a further embodiment thereof the invention is directed to an<br>
upflow reactor suitable for this process, which reactor comprises a reactor tank<br>
having incorporated therein three phase separators for separating gas, solid<br>
and liquid, which three phase separators are present in the upper part of the<br>
said reactor, influent distribution means for introducing a flow of waste water<br>
into the reactor, said influent distribution means being present in the lower<br>
part of the reactor, effluent withdrawal means for withdrawing anaerobic<br>
effluent from the separator and optionally recycle withdrawal means for<br>
withdrawing a recycle flow from the reactor, wherein the three phase<br>
separator has tilted plates, pipes or other tilted internals installed in the three<br>
phase separator body, above the separation of the gas from the liquid phase.<br>
A third way of defining this invention is through a three phase<br>
separator, which separator comprises a main separator body, at least one entry<br>
for a gas-liquid-solid mixture, single or multiple- biogas separation baffle<br>
plates for separating gas from the mixture, tilted plates, pipes or other tilted<br>
internals installed in the three phase separator body, above the separation of<br>
the gas from the liquid phase,, and means for withdrawing effluent and<br>
optionally also recycle water from the top of the three phase separator.<br>
The internals in the separator are positioned in an angle of typically<br>
50 to 70° to allow gravity settling of the collected solids and the free space<br>
between the plates, in the tubes or between the internals is typically at least<br>
50 mm to prevent blockage. An important aspect herein is that the gas<br>
separation is located below these internals.<br>
This can be further explained with the following example:<br>
•	Design raw wastewater flow 100 m3/h.<br>
•	Actual wastewater flow 60 m3/h<br>
•	Feed flow to the reactor 150 m3/h, so 50 m3/h anaerobic effluent recycle<br>
under design conditions<br><br>
•   The reactor has 3 three phase separators of equal lengths each of 5 m2<br>
effective settling surface, without extra internals and 25 m2 effective<br>
settling surface as a result of a package of tilted pipes ~ 100 no of pipes<br>
of 0150 mm each, the pipes are positioned under an angle of 60°) in the<br>
three phase separator body).<br>
The effective surface load on the three phase separator both for the<br>
design and actual situation is 100/15 = 6.67 m3/m2.hour in a conventional<br>
system. According to the invention the effective surface load on the three<br>
phase separator is 100/75 = 1.13 m3/m2.hour under design conditions and only<br>
60/75 = 0.S m3/m2.hour under actual operating conditions.<br>
This is a big advantage both for a more effective process (better<br>
sludge inventory, better performance and reduction rates) and to achieve lower<br>
overall investment cost.<br>
To realize the same surface load less three phase separator (surface)<br>
is required.<br>
Recirculation of part of the anaerobic effluent is beneficial for stable<br>
operation of an anaerobic sludge bed process, reactor or device. It provides<br>
stable hydraulic conditions, recycle of alkalinity and nutrients and dilution of<br>
the raw feed / wastewater (to prevent toxicity and / or local overloading). In the<br>
current anaerobic sludge bed processes, reactors or devices it is common<br>
practice to recycle (part of) the anaerobic effluent by gravity back to a<br>
conditioning tank, after it has passed the complete three phase separator or<br>
three phase separators. This results in an extra surface load (expressed as m3<br>
water / m2 three phase separator surface, hour) on the three phase separator<br>
or three phase separators, as the surface load is determined by the total feed to<br>
the reactor (= actual raw wastewater flow recirculation flow) divided by the<br>
available net surface area of the three phase separator.<br>
With the tilted internals of this invention already an important<br>
improvement is achieved. However, by combining this with an improved<br>
recycle method, even further improvement may be obtained.<br><br>
Accordingly a preferred embodiment is withdrawing the recycle<br>
water separately from the effluent, either from the top of the reactor outside<br>
the three phase separator or from the three phase separator.<br>
The novel aspect thereof is that the anaerobic effluent recycle is not<br>
taken from the three phase separator effluent, as is conventional, but from the<br>
top of the reactor outside the three phase separator, from a dedicated section of<br>
the three phase separator or preferably from the bottom of the three phase<br>
separator where the biogas has already been separated and the settled solids<br>
(from the three phase separator body) are collected.<br>
There are various ways in which the recycle water can be withdrawn<br>
from the top of the reactor or the three phase separator. In a first embodiment,<br>
the recycle water is withdrawn from the separator at a location where the gas<br>
has already been separated off. This is preferably done from the bottom of the<br>
separator, just above gas deflecting plates.<br>
In another embodiment, the recycle is withdrawn from the top of the<br>
reactor, outside the separator, i.e. from the solid-gas-liquid phase. In this<br>
embodiment it is also possible to locate the withdrawal behind a gas-deflecting<br>
device, such as a tilted plate, thereby providing some separation of the gas<br>
from the solid-gas-liquid mixture.<br>
In yet another embodiment it is also possible to dedicate one or more<br>
of the three phase separators (provided more than one is present) or part of the<br>
three phase separators for the recycle whereas the remainder of the separators<br>
or parts of the three phase separators are solely dedicated as effluent<br>
producing separators.<br>
The amount of recycle water (by volume) will generally be between<br>
&gt;0 and 95 % of the combined amount of recycle water and anaerobic effluent.<br>
Conversely, the amount of anaerobic effluent will be between 5 and 
thereof.+<br><br>
As a result the effective surface load (m3/m2.hour) on the three phase<br>
separator is always the lowest possible and directly proportional to the actual<br>
raw wastewater feed flow.<br>
Important advantages of the invention are the possibility to either<br>
design smaller three phase separators, which would reduce the investment<br>
cost, or to have a better performance of the three phase separator because of<br>
the lower hydraulic load thereof.<br>
Quite often a number of three phase separators are present in a<br>
reactor. In such a situation it is important to have an effective and equal<br>
recycle of anaerobic effluent from each three phase separator and over the<br>
length/surface of each three phase separator.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention this is achieved by<br>
accomplishing the effluent recycle by a modulating min / max flow system.<br>
Automatic open / close valves are then installed in the recycle lines /<br>
pipes from each three phase separator. In this way a full or partly recycle can<br>
be accomplished from each three phase separator or pipe separately. In other<br>
words, in this embodiment the recycle flow from each three phase separator is<br>
controlled by the valves with which the distribution of the amount of recycle<br>
from each three phase separator is determined.<br>
In the first embodiment each three phase separator contains an<br>
anaerobic effluent recirculation collection pipe at the bottom, with several<br>
openings / slots (in the three phase separator) over its lengths.)<br>
Each pipe is extended through the walls of respectively the three<br>
phase separator and the reactor tank and contains an open/close automatic<br>
valve (outside the reactor) just before all the pipes are connected to a header.<br>
This header collects the anaerobic effluent recycle flow from each<br>
three phase separator and discharges it to the conditioning tank. This can be<br>
further explained with the following example:<br>
•	Design raw wastewater flow 100 m3/h.<br>
•	Actual wastewater flow 60 m3/h<br><br>
•	Feed flow to the reactor 150 m3/h, so 50 m3/h anaerobic effluent recycle<br>
under design conditions<br>
•	Effective three phase separator surface 15 m2.<br>
•	The reactor has 3 three phase separators of equal lengths.<br>
In the prior art situation, the effective surface load on the three<br>
phase separator, both for the design and actual situation, is 150/15 = 10<br>
m3/m2.hour. According to the preferred embodiment of the invention, with the<br>
improved recycle location, the effective surface load on the three phase<br>
separator is 100/15 = 6.67 m3/m2.hour under design conditions and only 60/15<br>
= 4 m3/m2.hour under actual operating conditions.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the open / close valves in the<br>
recycle line have for example the following sequence:<br>
•	At any time 2 valves are closed and 1 is open.<br>
•	Every 5 minutes there is a change over: One of the closed valves opens<br>
and at the same time the valve which is open closes.<br>
So at any moment the full recycle flow is taken from one of the 3<br>
three phase separators at 50 m3/h under design conditions and maximum 150<br>
m3/h in case there is no raw wastewater feed flow.<br>
The result of these fluctuating flows over time is:<br>
•	(More) equal recirculation from each three phase separator and over the<br>
lengths of each three phase separator.<br>
•	Automatic cleaning of the three phase separator, with less risk for<br>
blockage.<br>
Moreover, the combination of extra settling surface and the new<br>
means for anaerobic effluent recycle results into a more effective extraction of<br>
the settled solids at the bottom of three phase separator. This also reduces the<br>
risk of blockage.<br>
In case a separator or part thereof is specifically dedicated for<br>
recycle water, it is possible to have different kind of internals than in the<br>
separators for the effluent, or to use no internals at all.<br><br>
The means of anaerobic effluent extraction gives also the possibility<br>
(or in- process cleaning of the three phase separator(s) and its internals by<br>
introduction of a back flow of water or (bio) gas recycles through the same<br>
extraction pipe and holes or slots.<br>
This is of special importance when a reactor is operated under<br>
biogas pressure (completely closed) as under such conditions it will be very<br>
inconvenient to open a reactor for inspection or cleaning purposes.<br>
The three phase separator(s) according the present invention will<br>
make use of multiple (2 to 10) biogas separation baffles plates similar as they<br>
are used in the Biothane UASB and Biobed three phase separators. The<br>
settled solids from the three phase separator will positively be returned to the<br>
reactor as a result of a by gravity difference induced circulation flow<br>
(mammouth. stream).<br>
A further important preferred feature related to this innovative<br>
anaerobic sludge bed process and reactor according to the invention is related<br>
to the improvement of the mixing and distribution of the to be treated<br>
wastewater with (all of) the available biomass.<br>
Typically the influent distribution system will be executed with 1<br>
nozzle per 1 up to 4 m2- reactor surface and having an even number of nozzles<br>
equally distributed over the reactor surface, using strings with several nozzles<br>
at one string.<br>
The special feature of this embodiment of the invention is that the<br>
reactor will be executed with several of these influent distributions over its<br>
height.<br>
Not only will this give a better distribution and mixing of the reactor<br>
feed flow with the available biomass, it will also, very effectively, break<br>
stagnant sludge layers to prevent building up of biogas in gas pockets which<br>
may result in irregular and undesired biogas production flows from the<br>
reactor.<br><br>
Preferably a reactor will have at least 1, preferably 2 to 5<br>
independent operating influent distribution systems. These systems will be<br>
located at different planes over the height of the reactor. In general the first<br>
system is located near the bottom of the reactor. The other influent<br>
distribution systems will be located above the first one at locations between 15<br>
and 55% of the height of the reactor.<br>
In a typical configuration one system is located at the bottom of the<br>
reactor and further one at respectively 2, 4 and 6 m from the bottom.<br>
The influent distribution system can be executed as a modulating<br>
min / max flow system with preferably horizontal outflow for better mixing and<br>
breaking-up of the sludge bed (to prevent biogas entrapment). Typically 0-40%<br>
of the flow is directed to one half of the nozzles and as a result 100-60% to the<br>
other half. The preferred change over from min to max is every 1 to 5 minutes.<br>
In a set-up using two influent distribution systems typically 20 to<br>
80% of the flow is directed to the bottom influent distribution system and as a<br>
result 80 to 20% of the flow to the influent distribution system at higher<br>
elevation.<br>
In case more than two influent distribution systems are used, the<br>
distribution of the influent over the systems is 20-80% to the bottom influent<br>
distribution system and the rest, so 80-20% is distributed equally over the rest<br>
of the influent distribution systems at higher elevations.<br>
This embodiment is further explained in the following example:<br>
•	Design raw wastewater flow 100 m3/h.<br>
•	Actual wastewater flow 60 m3/h<br>
•	Feed flow to the reactor 150 m3/h, so 50 m3/h anaerobic effluent recycle<br>
under design conditions<br>
•	-Reactor 600 m3, 15 m high so 40 m2 reactor surface<br>
•	The reactor has 3 influent distribution systems over its height, one near<br>
the bottom, one at 2 m and one at 4 m height<br><br>
•	Each influent distribution system is equipped with 4 strings and 10<br>
nozzles in total.<br>
•	1/2 of the reactor feed flow (so 75 m3/h) is directed to the bottom influent<br>
distribution system and 1/4 (so 37.5 m3/h) is directed to the influent<br>
distribution system at respectively 2 and 4m.<br>
•	Each Influent distribution system is operated with a min / max flow<br>
distribution of 30% / 70% as explained above.<br>
The various aspects of the invention are now elucidated on the basis<br>
of the attached figures, wherein<br>

conditioning tank,<br>

figure 6 a recycle from the top of the reactor using a gas deflecting plate.<br>
In figure 1, raw waste water 1 is fed to conditioning tank 2, where it<br>
is combined with recycle water 10 (gravity flow from the upflow reactor 5). In<br>
the conditioning tank 2 the water is conditioned (temperature, pH, nutrients<br>
addition) by means not shown. Reactor feed pump 3 pumps the conditioned<br>
water via valves 4 to the influent distribution systems 6 near the bottom of<br>
reactor 5.<br>
The waste water rises in the reactor, wherein a sludge bed is present<br>
consisting of mainly granular sludge. Due to the anaerobic breakdown of the<br>
contaminants in the waste water biogas is formed and a mixture of solid, liquid<br>
and gas develops. The mixture enters the three phase separator 8, where the<br>
gas is removed via the tilted baffles 12. The solids in the mixture settle<br><br>
through the separator and are returned to the reactor. Cleaned effluent is<br>
withdrawn through 9. The gas produced is removed through line 7. Recycle is<br>
withdrawn (by gravity) through line 10. In the alternative the recycle (all by<br>
gravity) can be withdrawn form location 10a (outside the three phase<br>
separator) or 10b (from part of the three phase separator).<br>
Figure 2a gives a detailed view of three-phase separator 8, wherein<br>
13 denotes the water flow inlet. This water further contains gas and solids and<br>
flows between the multiple biogas separation baffle plates 12. Due to the<br>
turbulent, downward flow of the mixture attached gas is separated from the<br>
solids. Part of the mixture flows down through the section between the bottom<br>
of the baffle plates and the lower gas gap 11 and part flows upward into<br>
internal section 15 of the separator 8. Internal section 15 is preferably<br>
provided with internals such as tilted tubes or titled plates to improve the<br>
liquid- solid separation. The solids settle in downward direction and flow down<br>
back into the reactor through section 16. Liquid flows upward out of the<br>
internal section 15 and via overflow launders 14 effluent is removed through<br>
line 9. The recycle can be withdrawn from the bottom part of the three phase<br>
separator 8 and next via pipe 10 gravity flow to the conditioning tank.<br>
In figure 2b a top view of the three phase separator 8 has been<br>
given, wherein the numeric indications correspond to the numeric indications<br>
in the description of figure 1 and 2a. In this figure various possibilities for<br>
tilted plates have been given. 15a denote corrugated tilted plates, 15b denote<br>
tilted tubes and 15c denote tilted flat plates.<br>
In figure 2c a top view of a three phase separator has been given,<br>
which has a specific dedicated section for collecting recycle. This section has<br>
been denoted as 16. This section can be with or without internals; The water<br>
from section 16 flows through overflow launders 14a to recycle pipe 10. The<br>
effluent flows via the launders 14 to effluent discharge pipe 9.<br><br>
In figure 3 a multiple influent distribution system has been<br>
described, having four distribution systems 6a, 6b, 6c en 6d. The amount of -<br>
water to the various discharge pipes is regulated via valves 4a, 4b, 4c and 4d.<br>

located preferably in the bottom of the three phase separator 10. Figure 4a<br>
shows the pipe having orifices 17. Figure 4b shows slots 17a.<br>
In figure 5 a top view of multiple three phase separators in an<br>
upflow reactor are shown. In this embodiment two separators have been<br>
shown, but it is also possible to include more separators. Each of the<br>
separators is connected through direct recycle pipes with the recycle line 10.<br>
The recycle pipes have been provided with valves, which can either have an<br>
open-close position or can be used to regulate the flow from 0 to 100%, either<br>
gradually or stepwise.<br>
In figure 6 a possible embodiment of a gas deflecting outside the<br>
three phase separator has been shown. This device consists of gas deflection<br>
means 19 and 20, which are located before the withdrawal means 10.<br><br>

granular biomass thus producing biogas in the treatment passing the<br>
resulting gas/liquid/solid mixture upward and separating the gas and solid<br>
from the liquid in a three phase separator and thereby generating an<br>
anaerobic effluent that is withdrawn from the top of the separator, the<br>
improvement comprising separating the solids from the liquid in a separator,<br>
wherein, above the separation of the gas from the liquid phase, tilted plates,<br>
tubes or other tilted internals are installed in the three phase separator body<br>
to increase the effective settling surface.<br>
2.	Process according to claim 1, wherein the internals are positioned in<br>
an angle of 50 to 70°.<br>
3.	Process according to claim 1 or 2, wherein recycle water is<br>
withdrawn separately from the effluent, either from the three phase separator<br>
or from the top of the reactor outside the three phase separator.<br>
4.	Process according to claim 1-3, wherein the recycle water is<br>
introduced, preferably by gravity into a conditioning tank into which also the<br>
(raw) waste water is introduced, and from which the combined flow of waste<br>
water and recycle is introduced into the reactor.<br>
