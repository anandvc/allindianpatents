				<td>HYDROCHLORIDE OF 4-( (4- ( (4- (2-CYANOETHENYL)-2,6-DIMETHYLPHENYL)AMINO)<br>
-2-PYRIMIDINYL)AMINO)BENZONITRILE<br>
The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising the<br>
hydrochloride salt of4-[[4-[[4-(2-cyanoethenyl)-2,6-dimethylphenyl]amino]-2-<br>
pyrimidinyl]amino]benzonitrile and to the preparation thereof.<br>
WO 03/16306 discloses HIV replication inhibiting pyrimidine derivatives among which<br>
4-[[4-[[4-(2-cyanoethenyl)-2,6-dimethylphenyl]amino]-2-pyrimidinyl]amino]-<br>
benzonitrile and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.<br>
WO 04/0162581 discloses processes to prepare 4-[[4-[[4-(2-cyanoethenyl)-2,6-<br>
dimethylphenyl]ammo]-2-pyrimidinyl]amino]benzonitrile.<br>
4-[[4-[[4-(2-cyanoethenyl)-2,6-dimethylphenyl]amino]-2-pyrimidinyl]amino]-<br>
benzonitrile, in particular the E-isomer, has excellent HIV replication inhibiting activity<br>
against the wild type of HIV as well as drug and multi drug resistant strains of HTV<br>
(i.e. strains which have become resistant to art-known drug(s)). The compound has<br>
thus potential to be a good candidate for the development of a medicament for the<br>
treatment of HTV infection.<br>
High pharmacological activity, a good pharmacological profile is however not the only<br>
factor which determines the drugability of a, compound.<br>
A good drug candidate should preferably also be stable chemically as well as<br>
physically; should have an acceptable toxjcity profile; should have an acceptable<br>
bioavailability.<br>
The bioavailability of the compound influences the dose of the compound required for<br>
administration in order to reach a therapeutically effective concentration of the<br>
compound in the patient. Compounds having a low bioavailability need to be<br>
administered in higher doses compared to compounds having a higher bioavailability.<br>
Possible consequences of the need for higher doses may comprise : an increased risk to<br>
adverse effects; an increase in the size of the dosage form; an increase in the frequency<br>
of administration. These factors may influence adherence to antiretroviral therapy.<br>
Therapy adherence is one of the most important factors influencing the effectiveness of<br>
HIV treatment. Increase in dosing frequency and increase in pill size may lead to<br>
reduced therapy adherence and hence reduced therapy effectiveness.<br>
Therefore, when designing a medicament for HTV treatment it is preferable to have an<br>
active compound with an acceptable bioavailability.<br>
The bioavailability of a compound intended to be administered orally, is dependent on<br>
the compounds solubility in water as well as the compounds permeability (its ability to<br>
be absorbed across the intestinal membrane).<br>
A scientific framework for classifying drug substances based on their aqueous<br>
solubility and intestinal permeability is the Biopharmaceutics Classification System or<br>
BCS. According to the BCS, drug substances are classified as follows:<br>
Class 1: High Solubility - High Permeability<br>
Class 2: Low Solubility - High Permeability<br>
Class 3: High Solubility - Low Permeability<br>
Class 4: Low Solubility - Low Permeability<br>
Compounds with a low solubility or a low permeability (class 2 to 4) may suffer from a<br>
low bioavailability when administered orally.<br>
Free base 4-[[4-[[4-(2-cyanoethenyl)-2,6-dimethylphenyl]amino]-2-pyrimidinyl]<br>
amino]benzonitrile can be classified as a BCS class 2 compound and has thus a low<br>
solubility in water. 4-[[4-[[4-(2-cyanoethenyl)-2,6-dimethylphenyl]amino]-2-<br>
pyrimidinyl]amino]benzonitrile does not only exhibit a low solubility in water, but also<br>
in an acidic environment. Consequently, when administered orally in a conventional<br>
solid dosage form, a low bioavailability may be expected.<br>
When confronted with a BCS class 2 compound intended for oral administration, a<br>
person skilled in pharmaceutical technology would turn to exploring possibilities for<br>
improving the compound's solubility, for instance by preparing an appropriate salt.<br>
This route was also followed for 4-[[4-[[4-(2-cyanoethenyl)-2,6-dime1;hylphenyl]<br>
amino]-2-pyrimidinyl]amino]benzonitrile.<br>
The prepared salts appeared to have only a slight improved solubility in water and in<br>
HC1. The prepared salts still belong to BCS class 2. Thus, also for the prepared salts a<br>
low bioavailibility could be expected.<br>
Unexpectedly, it has now been found that the hydrochloride salt of 4-[[4-[[4-(2-<br>
cyanoethenyl)-2,6-dimethylpheny]]amino]-2-pyrimidinyl]amino]benzonitrile, in<br>
particular its E-isomer, has a significant improved in vivo bioavailability compared to<br>
the free base. In fact, the present salt administered as a solid dosage form has an in<br>
vivo bioavailability which is comparable with the bioavailability of the free base<br>
administered as an oral PEG 400 solution.<br>
Because of the increased bioavailability in vivo, the hydrochloride salt may be<br>
formulated without the need of complex formulation techniques.<br>
The hydrochloride salt of the present invention was also found to be non-hygroscopic<br>
and to be chemically and physically stable in different conditions of humidity and<br>
temperatures.<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to the hydrochloride (HC1) salt of 4-[[4-[[4-(2-<br>
cyanoethenyl)-2,6-dimethylphenyl]amino]-2-pyrimidinyl]amino]benzomtrile, a<br>
//-oxide or a stereochemically isomeric form thereof.<br>
Thus, the present invention relates in particular to a compound of formula (I)<br>
a AT-oxide or a stereochemically isomeric form thereof.<br>
The Af-oxide forms of the present compound of formula (I) are meant to comprise the<br>
compounds of formula (I) wherein one or several tertiary nitrogen atoms are oxidized<br>
to the so-called Af-oxide.<br>
The term "stereochemically isomeric forms" as used hereinbefore defines all the<br>
possible stereoisomeric forms which the compound of formula (I), and the A^-oxides<br>
may possess. Unless otherwise mentioned or indicated, the chemical designation of the<br>
compound denotes the mixture of all possible stereochemically isomeric forms as well<br>
as each of the individual isomeric forms of the compound of formula (I) and the<br>
Af-oxides thereof substantially free of the other isomers. Stereochemically isomeric<br>
forms of the compound of formula (I) are obviously intended to be embraced within the<br>
scope of this invention.<br>
The compound of formula (I) may exist in 2 stereochemical configurations at the<br>
double bond of the cyanoethenyl chain, i.e. the E (Entgegen) configuration (E-isomer)<br>
and the Z (Zusammen) configuration (Z isomer).<br>
The terms E and Z are well known to a person skilled in the art.<br>
A particular embodiment of the compound of formula (I) is the E-isomer., i.e. a<br>
Another particular embodiment of the compound of formula (I) is the Z-isomer, i.e. a<br>
Whenever reference is made herein to the E-isomer, the pure E-isomer or any isomeric<br>
mixture of the E- and the Z-isomers wherein the E-isomer is predominantly present is<br>
meant, i.e. an isomeric mixture containing more than 50% or in particular more than<br>
80% of the E-isomer, or even more in particular more than 90% of the E-isomer. Of<br>
particular interest is the E-isomer substantially free of the Z-isomer. Substantially free<br>
in this context refers to E-Z-mixtures with no or almost no Z-isomer, e.g. isomeric<br>
mixtures containing as much as 90%, in particular 95% or even 98% or 99% of the Eisomer.<br>
Whenever reference is made herein to the Z-isomer, the pure Z-isomer or any isomeric<br>
mixture of the Z- and the E-isomers wherein the Z-isomer is predominantly present is<br>
meant, i.e. an isomeric mixture containing more than 50% or hi particular more than<br>
80% of the Z-isomer, or even more in particular more than 90% of the Z-isomer. Of<br>
particular interest is the Z-isomer substantially free of the E-isomer. Substantially free<br>
in this context refers to E-Z-mixtures with no or almost no E-isomer, e.g. isomeric<br>
mixtures containing as much as 90%, in particular 95% or even 98% or 99% of the Zisomer.<br>
Polymorphic forms of the present salts also fall within the ambit of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Polymorphic forms of pharmaceutical compounds may be of interest to those involved<br>
in the development of a suitable dosage form because if the polymorphic form is not<br>
held constant during clinical and stability studies, the exact dosage used or measured<br>
may not be comparable from one lot to the next. Once a pharmaceutical compound is<br>
produced for use, it is important to recognize the polymorphic form delivered in each<br>
dosage form to assure that the production process use the same form and that the same<br>
amount of drug is included hi each dosage. Therefore, it is imperative to assure that<br>
either a single polymorphic form or some known combination of polymorphic forms is<br>
present. In addition, certain polymorphic forms may exhibit enhanced thermodynamic<br>
stability and may be more suitable than other polymorpholic forms for inclusion hi<br>
pharmaceutical formulations. As used herein, a polymorphic form of a compound of<br>
the invention is the same chemical entity, but in a different crystalline arrangement<br>
Solvent addition forms (solvates) which the salts of the present invention are able to<br>
form also fall within the ambit of the present invention. Examples of such forms are<br>
e.g. hydrates, alcoholates and the like. Solvates are herein also referred to as<br>
pseudopolymorphic forms. Preferred is an anhydric salt.<br>
A particular embodiment of the present invention is a particular polymorphic or<br>
pseudopolymorphic form of a compound of formula (I-a), i.e. (E) 4-[[4-[[4-(2-<br>
cvanoethenyl)-2,6-dmiemylphenyl]ammo]-2-pyrirnidinyl]amino]benzonitrile.HCl.<br>
A first particular polymorphic form of the compound of formula (I-a) is herein<br>
designated as Form A (see Figure 1 and 2).<br>
A second particular form of the compound of formula (I-a) is herein designated as<br>
Form B. Form B can be present in two states, a dry state (polymorphic form) and a<br>
wetted state (pseudopolymorphic form). Only the characteristics of form B in the dry<br>
state are given (see Figure 3 and 4).<br>
A third particular polymorphic form of the compound of formula (I-a) is herein<br>
designated as Form C (see Figure 5 and 6).<br>
A fourth particular pseudopolymorphic form of the compound of formula (I-a) is herein<br>
designated as Form D (see Figure 7 and 8).<br>
 preferred polymorphic form of the compound of formula (I-a) is Form A.<br>
Whenever used hereinafter, the term "compound of formula (I), (I-a) or (I-b)" is meant<br>
to also include the N-oxide forms, the stereochemically isomeric forms and the<br>
polymorphic or pseudopolymorphic forms. Of special interest is a stereochemically<br>
pure form of the compound of formula (I). A preferred compound of formula (I) is a<br>
compound of formula (I-a).<br>
The compounds of formula (I), (I-a) or (I-b) can be prepared by reacting the<br>
corresponding free base with hydrochloric acid (HC1) in the presence of a suitable<br>
solvent, such as for example a suitable acid, e.g. acetic acid.<br>
The compounds of formula (I), (I-a) or (I-b) have antiretroviral activity. They are able<br>
to inhibit the replication of HTV, in particular HTV-1. HTV (Human Immunodeficiency<br>
Virus) is the aetiological agent of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) in<br>
humans. The HIV virus preferentially infects human T-4 cells and destroys them or<br>
changes their normal function, particularly the coordination of the immune system. As<br>
a result, an infected patient has an eyer decreasing number of T-4 cells, which<br>
moreover behave abnormally. Hence, the immunological defense system is unable to<br>
combat infections and neoplasms and the HIV infected subject usually dies by<br>
opportunistic infections such as pneumonia, or by cancers. Other conditions associated<br>
with HTV infection include thrombocytopaenia, Kaposi's sarcoma and infection of the<br>
central nervous system characterized by progressive demyelination, resulting in<br>
dementia and symptoms such as, progressive dysarthria, ataxia and disorientation. HTV<br>
infection further has also been associated with peripheral neuropathy, progressive<br>
generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL).and AJDS-related complex (ARC).<br>
The present compounds also show activity against drug and multidrug resistant HTV<br>
strains, hi particular drug and multidrug resistant HTV-1 strains, more in particular the<br>
present compounds show activity against HTV strains, especially HTV-1 strains, that<br>
have acquired resistance to one or more art-known non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase<br>
inhibitors. Art-known non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors are those nonnucleoside<br>
reverse transcriptase inhibitors other than the present compounds and in<br>
particular commercial non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors.<br>
The HIV replication inhibiting activity of 4-[[4-[[4-(2-cyanoethenyl)-2,6-<br>
dimemylphenyl]amuio]-2-pyrimidinyl]aniino]benzonitrile is described in<br>
WO 03/16306, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Due to their antiretroviral properties, particularly their anti-HTV properties, especially<br>
their HTV-1 replication inhibiting activity, the present compounds are useful in the<br>
treatment of individuals infected by HTV and for the prophylaxis of these infections. In<br>
general, the compounds of the present invention may be useful in the treatment of<br>
warm-blooded mammals infected with viruses whose existence is mediated by, or<br>
depends upon, the enzyme reverse transcriptase. Conditions which may be prevented or<br>
treated with the compounds of the present invention, especially conditions associated<br>
with HIV and other pathogenic retroviruses, include AIDS, AIDS-related complex<br>
(ARC), progressive generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL), as well as chronic Central<br>
Nervous System diseases caused by retroviruses, such as, for example HTV mediated<br>
dementia and multiple sclerosis<br>
Therefore, the compounds of formula (I), (I-a) or (I-b) can be used as a medicine.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may therefore be used as medicines against<br>
above-mentioned conditions. Said use as a medicine or method of treatment comprises<br>
the administration to HIV-infected subjects of an amount effective to combat the<br>
conditions associated with HTV and other pathogenic retroviruses, especially HIV-1. In<br>
particular, the present compounds may be used in the manufacture of a medicament for<br>
the treatment or the prevention of HTV infection, preferably for the treatment of HTV<br>
infection.<br>
In view of the utility of the present compounds, there is also provided a method of<br>
treating mammals, including humans, suffering from or a method of preventing warmblooded<br>
mammals, including humans, to suffer from viral infections, especially HIV<br>
infections. Said method comprises the administration, preferably oral administration,<br>
of an effective amount of a salt of the present invention to mammals including humans.<br>
Due to the higher bioavailability of the present compounds compared to the<br>
corresponding free base, therapeutic effective plasma levels may be obtained by<br>
administering a pharmaceutical composition comprising a lower amount of the salt<br>
compared to what would be needed of the corresponding free base.<br>
Therefore, the size of the pharmaceutical composition may be reduced or the frequency<br>
of dosing may be reduced.<br>
Thus, the present invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and as active ingredient a therapeutically effective<br>
amount of a compound of formula (I), (I-a) or (I-b).<br>
The present invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and as active ingredient a therapeutically effective<br>
amount of a compound of formula (I), (I-a) or (I-b) provided that the composition does<br>
not contain both emtricitabine and tenofovir diisoproxyl fumarate.<br>
In particular, the present invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition<br>
comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and as active ingredient a<br>
therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I), (I-a) or (I-b) provided<br>
that the composition does not contain one or more nucleoside reverse transcriptase<br>
inhibitors and/or one or more nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors.<br>
The present compounds of formula (I), (I-a) or (I-b) may be formulated into various<br>
pharmaceutical compositions for administration purposes. As appropriate compositions<br>
there may be cited all compositions usually employed for systemically administering<br>
drugs. To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, an effective<br>
amount of the compound of formula (I), (I-a) or (I-b) as the active ingredient is<br>
combined in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which<br>
carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired<br>
for administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are desirable in unitary dosage<br>
form suitable, particularly, for administration orally. For example, in preparing the<br>
compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be<br>
employed such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of<br>
oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, syrups, elixirs, emulsions and solutions; or<br>
solid carriers such as starches, sugars, kaolin, diluents, lubricants, binders,<br>
disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders, pills, capsules, and tablets.<br>
Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most<br>
advantageous oral unit dosage forms, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are<br>
obviously employed. For parenteral compositions, the carrier will usually comprise<br>
sterile water, at least in large part, though other ingredients, for example, to aid<br>
solubility, may be included. Injectable solutions, for example, may be prepared in<br>
which the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture of saline and<br>
glucose solution. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in which case<br>
appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. Also<br>
included are solid form preparations, which are intended to be converted, shortly before<br>
use, to liquid form preparations. In the compositions suitable for percutaneous<br>
administration, the carrier optionally comprises a penetration enhancing agent and/or a<br>
suitable wetting agent, optionally combined with suitable additives of any nature in<br>
minor proportions, which additives do not introduce a significant deleterious effect on<br>
the skin. Said additives may facilitate the administration to the skin and/or may be<br>
helpful for preparing the desired compositions. These compositions may be<br>
administered in various ways, e.g., as a transdermal patch, as a spot-on, as an ointment.<br>
The salts of the present invention may also be administered via inhalation or<br>
insufflation by means of methods and formulations employed in the art for<br>
administration via this way. Thus, in general the salts of the present invention may be<br>
administered to the lungs in the form of a solution, a suspension or a dry powder. Any<br>
system developed for the delivery of solutions, suspensions or dry powders via oral or<br>
nasal inhalation or insufflation are suitable for the administration of the present<br>
compounds.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may also be topically administered in the form<br>
of drops, in particular eye drops. Said eye drops may be in the form of a solution or a<br>
suspension. Any system developed for the delivery of solutions or suspensions as eye<br>
drops are suitable for the administration of the present compounds.<br>
WO 2004/069812 which is incorporated herein by reference, describes the ability of<br>
pyrimidine derivatives among which 4-[[4-[[4-(2-cyanoethenyl)-2,6-dimethylphenyl]-<br>
amino]-2-pyrimidinyl]aminp]ben7onitrile and pharmaceutically acceptable salts<br>
thereof, to prevent HTV infection via sexual intercourse or related intimate contact<br>
between partners. Therefore, the present invention also relates to a pharmaceutical<br>
composition in a form adapted to be applied to a site where sexual intercourse or<br>
related intimate contact can take place, such as the genitals, rectum, mouth, hands,<br>
lower abdomen, upper thighs, especially the vagina and mouth, comprising a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and as active ingredient an effective amount of a<br>
compound of formula (I), (I-a) or (I-b). In particular to a pharmaceutical composition<br>
in a form adapted to be applied to a site where sexual intercourse or related intimate<br>
contact can take place, such as the genitals, rectum, mouth, hands, lower abdomen,<br>
upper thighs, especially the vagina and mouth, comprising a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier and as active ingredient an effective amount of a compound of<br>
formula (I), (I-a) or (I-b) provided that the composition does not contain both<br>
emtricitabine and tenofovir diisoproxyl fumarate. More in particular, the present<br>
invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition in a form adapted to be applied<br>
to a site where sexual intercourse or related intimate contact can take place, such as the<br>
genitals, rectum, mouth, hands, lower abdomen, upper thighs, especially the vagina and<br>
mouth, comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and as active ingredient an<br>
effective amount of a compound of formula (I), (I-a) or (I-b) provided that the<br>
composition does not contain one or more nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors<br>
and/or one or more nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors. As appropriate special<br>
adapted compositions there may be cited all compositions usually employed for being<br>
applied to the vagina, rectum, mouth and skin such as for example gels, jellies, creams,<br>
ointments, films, sponges, foams, intravaginal rings, cervical caps, suppositories for<br>
rectal or vaginal application, vaginal or rectal or buccal tablets, mouthwashes. To<br>
prepare such pharmaceutical compositions, an effective amount of the active ingredient<br>
is combined in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which<br>
carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of administration. In<br>
order to increase the residence time of such pharmaceutical composition at the site of<br>
administration, it may be advantageous to include in the composition a bioadhesive, in<br>
particular a bioadhesive polymer. A bioadhesive may be defined as a material that<br>
adheres to a live biological surface such as for example a mucus membrane or skin<br>
tissue.<br>
Thus, the present invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and as active ingredient an effective amount of a<br>
compound of formula (I), (I-a) or (I-b) characterized in that the pharmaceutical<br>
composition is bioadhesive to the site of application. Preferably, the site of application<br>
is the vagina, rectum, mouth or skin, most preferred is the vagina.<br>
In particular, the present invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition<br>
comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and as active ingredient an effective<br>
amount of a compound of formula (1), (I-a) or (I-b) characterized in that the<br>
pharmaceutical composition is bioadhesive to the site of application provided that the<br>
composition does not contain both emtricitabine and tenofovir diisoproxyl fumarate.<br>
More in particular, the present invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition<br>
comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and as active ingredient an effective<br>
amount of a compound of formula (I), (I-a) or (I-b) characterized in that the<br>
pharmaceutical composition is bioadhesive to the site of application provided that the<br>
composition does not contain one or more nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors<br>
and/or one or more nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors.<br>
It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical<br>
compositions in unit dosage form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage.<br>
Unit dosage form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary<br>
dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated<br>
to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required<br>
pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such unit dosage forms are tablets (including<br>
scored or coated tablets), capsules, pills, powder packets, wafers, suppositories,<br>
injectable solutions or suspensions and the like, and segregated multiples thereof.<br>
The exact dosage and frequency of administration depends on the particular condition<br>
being treated, the severity of the condition being treated, the age, weight, sex, extent of<br>
disorder and general physical condition of the particular patient as well as other<br>
medication the individual may be taking, as is well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Furthermore, it is evident that said effective daily amount may be lowered or increased<br>
depending on the response of the treated subject and/or depending on the evaluation of<br>
the physician prescribing the compounds of the instant invention.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be administered at any<br>
time of the day independently of the food taken in by the subject. Preferably, the<br>
present compositions are administered to fed subjects.<br>
An interesting embodiment of the present invention concerns an oral pharmaceutical<br>
composition, i.e. a pharmaceutical composition suitable for oral administration,<br>
comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and as active ingredient a<br>
therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I), (I-a) or (I-b).<br>
In particular, the present invention concerns an oral pharmaceutical composition, i.e. a<br>
pharmaceutical composition suitable for oral administration, comprising a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and as active ingredient a therapeutically effective<br>
amount of a compound of formula (I), (I-a) or (I-b) provided that the composition does<br>
not contain both emtricitabine and tenofovir diisoproxyl fumarate, more in particular a<br>
pharmaceutical composition suitable for oral administration, comprising a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and as active ingredient a therapeutically effective<br>
amount of a compound of formula (I), (I-a) or (I-b) provided that the composition does<br>
not contain one or more nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and/or one or more<br>
nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors.<br>
In particular, the oral pharmaceutical composition is a solid oral pharmaceutical<br>
composition, more in particular a tablet or a capsule, even more in particular a tablet.<br>
A tablet according to the present invention may be formulated as a once daily tablet.<br>
Preferably, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention contain those<br>
quantities of a compound of formula (I), (I-a) or (I-b) equivalent to from about 5 to<br>
about 500 mg of the corresponding free base 4-[[4-[[4-(2-cyanoethenyl)-2,6-<br>
dimemylphenyl]ammo]-2-pyrimidinyl]amino]benzonitrile, its E or Z isomer, more<br>
preferably from about 10 mg to about 250 mg of the corresponding free base, even<br>
more preferably from about 20 mg to about 200 mg of the corresponding free base.<br>
Preferably, the present pharmaceutical compositions contain those quantities of a<br>
compound of formula (I), (I-a) or (I-b) equivalent to 25 mg, 50 mg, 75 mg, 100 mg or<br>
150 mg of the corresponding free base (base equivalent).<br>
As used hereinbefore or hereinafter, the term "about" in relation to a numerical value x<br>
means, for example, x ±10 %.<br>
The particle size of the compound of formula (I), (I-a) or (I-b) preferably is less than 50<br>
(j,m, more preferably less than 25 fim, even more preferably less than 20 um. Further<br>
preferred is a particle size of about 15 um or less, or about 12 um or less, or about 10<br>
um or less, or about 5 um or less. Most preferably, the particle size ranges between<br>
about 0.2 and about 15 um or between about 0.2 and about 10 um,<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention preferably comprise a<br>
wetting agent.<br>
As for the wetting agent in the compositions of the invention, there may be used any of<br>
the physiologically tolerable wetting agent suitable for use in a pharmaceutical<br>
composition.<br>
It is well-known in the art that a wetting agent is an amphiphilic compound; it contains<br>
polar, hydrophilic moieties as well as non-polar, hydrophobic moieties.<br>
The terms "hydrophilic" or "hydrophobic" are relative terms.<br>
The relative hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity of a wetting agent may be expressed by<br>
its hydrophilic-lipophilic balance value ("HLB value). Wetting agents with a lower<br>
HLB value are catagorized as being "hydrophobic" wetting agents whereas wetting<br>
agents with a higher HLB value are catagorized as being "hydrophilic" wetting agents.<br>
As a rule of thumb, wetting agents having a HLB value greater than about 10 are<br>
generally considered as being hydrophilic wetting agents; wetting agents having a HLB<br>
value lower than about 10 are generally considered as being hydrophobia wetting<br>
agents.<br>
The present compositions preferably comprise a hydrophilic wetting agent.<br>
It should be appreciated that the HLB value of a wetting agent is only a rough guide to<br>
indicate the hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of a wetting agent. The HLB value of a<br>
particular wetting agent may vary depending upon the method used to determine the<br>
HLB value; may vary depending on its commercial source; is subject to batch to batch<br>
variability. A person skilled in the art can readily identify hydrophilic wetting agents<br>
suitable for use in the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention.<br>
The wetting agent of the present invention can be an anionic, a cationic, a zwitterionic<br>
or a non-ionic wetting agent, the latter being preferred. The wetting agent of the<br>
present invention can also be a mixture of two or more wetting agents.<br>
Suitable wetting agents for use in the compositions of the present invention are listed<br>
below. It should be emphasized that said list of wetting agents is only illustrative,<br>
representative and not exhaustive. Thus the invention is not limited to the wetting<br>

HPMC having a methoxy degree of substitution from about 0.8 to about 2.5<br>
and a hydroxypropyl molar substitution from about 0.05 to about 3.0 are generally<br>
water-soluble. Methoxy degree of substitution refers to the average number of methyl<br>

States Adopted Name for hypromellose (see Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia,<br>
29th edition, page 1435). In the four digit number "2910", the first two digits represent<br>
the approximate percentage of methoxyl groups and the third and fourth digits the<br>
approximate percentage composition of hydroxypropoxyl groups;<br>
15 mPa.s or 5 mPa.s is a value indicative of the apparent viscosity of a 2 % aqueous<br>
solution at 20°C.<br>

Tablets of the present invention may optionally be film-coated following art-known<br>
coating procedures. Film-coated tablets are easier to swallow than uncoated tablet<br>
cores, are usually easier to distinguish from other tablets - in particular when the filmcoat<br>
contains a dye or a pigment -, may have reduced tackiness, and may furthermore<br>
have an improved stability (increased shelf-life), e.g. because the coating may protect<br>
the active ingredient from the influence of light. Preferably, the film coat is an<br>
immediate release coat. Film coatings may comprise a fihn-forming polymer and<br>
optionally a plasticizer or a pigment. An example of a suitable film-forming polymer is<br>
hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, and an example of a suitable plasticizer is<br>
polyethyleneglycol, e.g. macrogol 3000 or 6000, or triacetin. Commercially available<br>
suitable coatings for pharmaceutical tablets are well-known to a person skilled in the<br>
art. Preferably, the film coating is a non-transparant film coating. An example of a<br>
suitable coating is Opadry®, in particular coating powder Opadry® II White.<br>
Tablets of the present invention can be prepared by direct compression or wet<br>
granulation.<br>

which target different events in the viral life cycle, the therapeutic effect of these<br>
compounds can be potentiated. Combination therapies as described above exert a<br>
synergistic effect in inhibiting HTV replication because each component of the<br>
combination acts on a different site of HIV replication. The use of such combinations<br>
may reduce the dosage of a given conventional anti-retroviral agent which would be<br>
required for a desired therapeutic or prophylactic effect as compared to when that agent<br>
is administered as a monotherapy. These combinations may reduce or eliminate the<br>
side effects of conventional single anti-retroviral therapy while not interfering with the<br>
anti-viral activity of the agents. These combinations reduce potential of resistance to<br>
single agent therapies, while minimizing any associated toxicity. These combinations<br>
may also increase the efficacy of the conventional agent without increasing the<br>
associated toxicity.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may also be administered in combination with<br>
immunomodulating agents, e.g. levamisole, bropirimine, anti-human alpha interferon<br>
antibody, interferon alpha, interleukin 2, methionine enkephalin,<br>
diethyldithiocarbamate, tumor necrosis factor, naltrexone and the like; antibiotics, e.g.<br>
pentamidine isethiorate and the like; cholinergic agents, e.g. tacrine, rivastigmine,<br>
donepezil, galantamine and the like; NMDA channel blockers, e.g. memantine to<br>
prevent or combat infection and diseases or symptoms of diseases associated with HTV<br>
infections, such as AIDS and ARC, e.g. dementia.<br>
Although the present invention focuses on the use of the present compounds for<br>
preventing or treating HTV infections, the present compounds may also be used as<br>
inhibitory agents for other viruses which depend on similar reverse transcriptases for<br>
obligatory events in their life cycle.<br>

F. In vivo bioavailability study<br>
A) In order to study the in vivo bioavailability of the compound of formula (I-a), a<br>
study in male beagle dogs was performed.<br>
The bioavailability of the compound of formula (I-a) after oral administration was<br>
compared with the bioavailability of the free base after intravenous administration.<br>
The fonnulation used for intravenous administration was a 75 % PEG 400/25 % sterile<br>
water solution of (E) 4-[[4-[[4-(2-cyanoethenyl)-2,6-dirnethylphenyl]ammo]-2-<br>
pyrimidinyl]amino]benzonitrile free base administered at a dose of 1.25 mg/kg.<br>
The formulations used for oral administration were :<br>
(Table Removed)- a PEG 400 solution of (E) 4-[[4-[[4-(2-cyanoethenyl)-2,6-dimethylphenyl]amino]-2-<br>
pyrimidinyl]amino]benzonitrile free base (group I);<br>
- a capsule (size 0; red cap-red body) containing 7.67 % (w/w) of 4-[[4-[[4-(2-<br>
cyanoethenyl)-2,6-dime11iylpheny]]amino]-2-pyrirnidinyl]amino]berizonitrile (E) free<br>
base, 0.18 % (w/w) sodium lauryl sulfate, 0.18 % (w/w) silicon dioxide, 91.97 % (w/w)<br>
granulated lactose monohydrate (group II);<br>
- a capsule (size 0; red cap-red body) containing 8.36 % (w/w) of a compound of<br>
formula (I-a), 0.18 % (w/w) sodium lauryl sulfate, 0.18 % (w/w) silicon dioxide, 91.28<br>
% (w/w) granulated lactose monohydrate (group III).<br>
(the % w/w is based on the capsule content)<br>
The different formulations were orally administered at a dose level of 5 mg base<br>
equivalent/kg. The formulations were prepared based on previously determined body<br>
weights of the animals. The exact administered dose was calculated using the body<br>
weights just before dosing and amounted on average to 5 mg base equivalent/kg per<br>
formulation.<br>
Blood samples (4 ml on EDTA) were taken from a jugular vein from the dogs at 0<br>
(= predose), 0.5,1, 2,4, 6, 8, 24, 32,48 and 72 h after dose administration. After<br>
sampling, the blood samples were immediately placed on melting ice and protected<br>
from light. Blood samples were centrifuged at approximately 1900 x g for 10 minutes<br>
at 5 °C to allow plasma separation. Plasma samples were separated, transferred into a<br>
second tube within 2 h after blood sampling and stored at  -18°C until analysis. At all<br>
times, samples were protected from light and placed on melting ice or at  -18°C.<br>
Plasma levels of 4-[[4-[[4-(2-cyanoethenyl)-2,6-dimethylphenyl]amino]-2-<br>
pyrimidinyl]amino]benzonitrile (E) were determined using a qualified research<br>
LC-MS/MS method. LC-MS/MS analysis was carried out on an API-3000 MS/MS<br>
(Applied Biosystems), which was coupled to an HPLC-pump (Agilent) and<br>
autosampler (Interscience).<br>
Mean (n = 2) plasma concentrations per formulation and per sampling time were<br>
calculated. Peak plasma concentrations (Qnax), corresponding peak times (Tmsx) and<br>
AUCo-t (where t is the time point corresponding to the last measurable concentration<br>
above the quantification limit) were determined. The area under the curve extrapolated<br>
to infinity (AUCo-inf) was calculated as the sum of AUCo-t and Ct/P, where |3 is the<br>
elimination rate constant, determined by log-linear regression of the terminal plasma<br>
concentration-time data. Mean (n = 2) PK parameters were calculated for all<br>
formulations. An estimate of the absolute bioavailability (Fabs) of 4-[[4-[[4-(2-<br>
cyanoethenyl)-2,6-dimethylphenyl]amino]-2-pyrimidinyl]amino]benzonitrile(E) was<br>
obtained by dividing dose-normalised mean AUCo-mf value after oral administration by<br>
dose-normalised mean AUCo-inf value after intravenous administration and this for all<br>
From the results above it can be concluded that, when administered as a solid dosage<br>
form, the compound of formula (I-a) has a significant better bioavailability than the<br>
corresponding free base 4-[[4-[[4-(2-cyanoethenyl)-2,6-dimethylphenyl]amino]-2-<br>
pyrimidinyl]amhio]benzonitrile (E). The bioavailability is comparable with that of the<br>
free base administered as an oral PEG 400 solution.<br>
B) The oral bioavailability of the compound of formula (I-a) was also studied in vivo in<br>
humans.<br>
The healthy subjects received 2 treatments.<br>
Treatment A : a 25 mg/ml solution of free base (E) 4-[[4-[[4-(2-cyanoethenyl)-2,6-<br>
dimelhylphenyl]amino]-2-pyrimidinyl]amino]benzonitrile in 100% PEG 400.<br>
Treatment B : a tablet according to composition 2a described hereinabove.<br>
In a panel of 12 subjects, each subject received three single doses, each equivalent to<br>
100 mg of the free base (E) 4-[[4-[[4-(2-cyanoethenyl)-2,6-dimethylphenyl]amino]-2-<br>
pyrimidinyl]amino]ben2onitrile. Each dose was administered on day 1 of the<br>
respective treatment period.<br>
The subjects (n=12) were randomized to receive single doses of Treatment A under fed<br>
conditions, Treatment B in the fasted state and Treatment B under fed conditions<br>
during three sessions, each separated by a wash-out period of at least 2 weeks. A 216-<br>
hour pharmacokinetic profile for (E) 4-[[4-[[4-(2-cyanoethenyl)-2,6-dimethylphenyl]<br>
amino]-2-pyrimidinyl]atninp]benzonitrile in plasma was determined for each<br>
session after oral administration of a single 100 mg dose of (E)-4-[[4-[[4-(2-<br>
cyanoethenyl)-2,6-dimethylphenyl]aniino]-2-pyrirnidinyl]amino]benzonitrile base or<br>
equivalent. For the determination of plasma (E)-4-[[4-[[4-(2-cyanoethenyl)-2,6-<br>
dimethylphenyl]amino]-2-pyrimidinyl]amino]ben7onitrile concentrations, blood was<br>
drawn predose, and at 0.5,1,2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12,16, 24, 32,48, 72,96,120,144, 168 and<br>
216 hours after administration of the study medication (19 samples in total per subject<br>
per administration).<br>
For each subject, two of the three doses were administered under fed conditions, i.e. a<br>
standardized breakfast was consumed within 10 minutes prior to dosing with Treatment<br>
A or Treatment B, when the pharmacokinetics were investigated under fed conditions.<br>
For 'fasted' conditions, subjects had to be fasted for at least 10 hours before<br>
administration of the investigational drug. They received their first meal at lunch, 4.5<br>
hours after administration of the investigational drug, when the pharmacokinetics were<br>
investigated under fasted conditions (Treatment B only).<br>
In particular, on day -1, subjects were admitted to the testing facility and fasted<br>
overnight for at least 10 hours, except for the intake of water which was allowed until 2<br>
hours before drug intake. For subjects randomized to receive Treatment A or Treatment<br>
B under fed conditions, the trial medication was administered within 10 minutes after a<br>
standardized breakfast hi the testing facility. For subjects randomized to receive<br>
Treatment B in the fasted state, the trial medication was taken without food, after an<br>
overnight fast of at least 10 hours.<br>
The standardized breakfast consisted of four slices of bread, two slices of ham or<br>
cheese, butter, jam and two cups of decaffeinated coffee or tea with milk and/or sugar.<br>
This meal was ingested within 20 minutes under the supervision of a trial nurse or staff<br>
member.<br>
For all subjects, trial medication was administered together with approximately 200 mL<br>
of water between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m.<br>
From 2 hours after dosing, intake of water was allowed for all subjects. Lunch was<br>
served 4.5 hours after dosing and dinner was served 10 hours after dosing. After dinner,<br>
subjects were allowed to resume their usual diet.<br>
The subjects were discharged from the testing facility on Day 2 after the 24 hour postdose<br>
pharmacokinetic sample and returned to the facility 8 hours later and again on<br>
Days 3,4, 5, 6,7, 8 and 10 for further assessments. In more detail: for the<br>
determination of plasma (E)-4-[[4-[[4-(2-cyanoethenyl)-2,6-dimethylphenyl]amino]-2-<br>
pyrimidinyl]amino]benzonitrile concentrations, blood was drawn predose, and at 0.5, 1,<br>
2, 3,4, 6, 8,12,16, 24, 32,48, 72, 96,120,144, 168 and 216 hours after administration<br>
of the study medication (19 samples in total per subject per administration).<br>
For each individual subject, there was a time interval of at least 2 weeks between dose<br>
administrations. ;<br>
The bioanalysis of (E)-4-[[4-[[4-(2-cyanoethenyl)-2,6-dimethylphenyl]amino]-2-<br>
pyrimidinyl]amino]benzonitrile in human plasma was performed by a validated LCMS/<br>
MS method.<br><br><br><br><br>
