				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to imidazoS-djpyrimidines, their uses and<br>
manufacture. The invention relates specifically to antiviral compounds, in<br>
particular such compounds for the treatment of Flaviviridae and Picornaviridae.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The family of the Flaviviridae consists of 3 genera, the pestiviruses, the<br>
flaviviruses and the hepaciviruses and also contains the hepatitis G virus<br>
(HGV/GBV-C) that has not yet been assigned to a genus. Pestiviruses such as the<br>
Classical Swine Fever Virus (CSFV), the Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV) and<br>
the Border Disease Virus (BDV) cause infections of domestic livestock<br>
(respectively pigs, cattle and sheep) and are responsible for significant economic<br>
losses world-wide. BVDV, the prototypic representative of the pestivirus genus is<br>
ubiquitous and causes a range of clinical manifestations, including abortion,<br>
teratogenesis, respiratory problems, chronic wasting disease, immune system<br>
dysfunction, and predisposition to secondary viral and bacterial infections and<br>
may also cause acute fatal disease. Fetuses of cattle can be infected persistently<br>
with BVDV, these animals remain viremic throughout life and serve as a<br>
continuous sources for virus spread in herds.<br>
Vaccines are used in some countries with varying degrees of sticcess to<br>
control pestivirus disease. In other countries, animal culling and slaughter are<br>
used to contain pestivirus disease outbreaks.<br>
The World Health Organization estimates that world-wide 170 million<br>
people (3% of the world's population) are chronically infected with HCV<br>
(Hepatitis C Virus). These chronic carriers are at risk of developing cirrhosis<br>
and/or liver cancer. In studies with a 10 to 20 year follow-up, cirrhosis developed<br>
in 20 - 30% of the patients, 1 to 5% of whom may develop liver cancer during the<br>
next ten years. The only treatment option available today is the use of interferon<br>
oc-2 (or its pegylated form) either alone or combined with ribavirin. However,<br>
sustained response is only observed in about 40% of the patients and treatment is<br>
associated with serious adverse effects. There is thus an urgent need for potent<br>
and selective inhibitors of the replication of HCV in order to treat infections with<br>
HCV. Furthermore, the study of specific inhibitors of HCV replication has been<br>
hampered by the fact that it is not possible to propagate HCV (efficiently) in cell<br>
culture. Since HCV and pestiviruses belong to the same virus family and share<br>
many similarities (organization of the genome, analogous gene products and<br>
replication cycle), pestiviruses have been adopted as a model and surrogate for<br>
HCV. For example BVDV is closely related to hepatitis C virus (HCV) and used<br>
as a surrogate virus hi drug development for HCV infection.<br>
The compound 3-[((2-dipropylamino)ethyl)thio]-5H-l,2,4-triazino[5,6-<br>
b]indole has been reported to selectively inhibit the replication of BVDV and other<br>
pestiviruses (Baginski SG et. al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000 Jul<br>
5;97(14):7981-6). Currently, there is no antiviral treatment for pestiviral infections.<br>
Coxsackie viruses belong to the group of the enteroviruses, family of the<br>
Picornaviridae. They cause a heterogeneous group of infections including<br>
herpangina, aseptic meningitis, a common-cold-like syndrome, a non-paralytic<br>

systems. Ordinarily the hydrocarbons of the compounds of the formulas of this<br>
invention are single rings. Monocyclic carbocycles generally have 3 to 6 ring<br>
atoms, still more typically 5 or 6 ring atoms. Bicyclic carbocycles typically have 7<br>
to 12 ring atoms, e.g. arranged as a bicyclo [4,5], [5,5], [5,6] or [6,6] system, or 9 or<br>
10 ring atoms arranged as a bicyclo [5,6] or [6,6] system.<br>
If the number of carbon atoms is unspecified for a hydrocarbon, typically<br>
the number of carbon atoms will range from 1 to 18. except that the number of<br>
carbons typically will range from 2 to 18 for unsaturated hydrocarbons and from 6<br>
to 10 for aryL<br>

or amino groups, whether those groups are on the side chain or are free after<br>
linking the amino acid to the remainder of the compound of this invention.<br>
Optionally the amino acid residue is a hydrophobic residue such as monoor<br>
di-alkyl or aryl amino acids, cycloalkylamino acids. Optionally, the residue<br>
does not contain a sulfhydryl or guanidino substituent.<br>
NaturaHy-occutring amino acid residues are those residues found naturally<br>
in plants, animals or microbes, especially proteins thereof. Polypeptides most<br>

Generally, only one of any site in the parental molecule is substituted with<br>
an amino acid, although it is within the scope of this invention to introduce amino<br>
acids at more than one permitted site. In general, the alpha-amino or alphacarboxyl<br>
group of the amino acid are bonded to the remainder of the molecule,<br>
i.ev carboxyl or amino groups in the amino acid side chains generally are not used<br>
to form amide bonds with the parental compound (although these groups may<br>
need to be protected during synthesis of the conjugates).<br>
The arnino acid esters optionally are hydrolyzable in vivo or in vitro under<br>
acidic (pH 3) or basic (pH 10) conditions. Optionally, they are substantially<br>
stable in the gastrointestinal tract of humans but are hydrolyzed enzymatically in<br>
blood or in intracellular environments.<br>

Utilities<br>
The compounds of this invention, or the metabolites produced from these<br>
compounds in vivo, have a large number of uses. They are useful in immunology,<br>
chromatography, diagnostics and therapeutics, among other fields.<br>
The compounds of the formulas of this invention are conjugated to<br>
immunogenic polypeptides as a reagent for eliciting antibodies capable of binding<br>
specifically to the polypeptide, to the compounds or to their metabolic products<br>
which retain immunologically recognized epitopes (sites of antibody binding).<br>
These immunogenic compositions therefore are useful as intermediates in the<br>
preparation of antibodies for use in diagnostics, quality control, or the like, or in<br>
assays for the compounds of the formulas of this invention or their novel<br>
metabolic products. The compounds are useful for raising antibodies against<br>
otherwise non-immunogenic polypeptides, in that the compounds serve as<br>
haptenic sites stimulating an irr mune response which cross-reacts with the<br>
unmodified conjugated protein.<br>
Conjugates of the compounds of the formulas of this invention with<br>
immunogenic polypeptides such as albumin or keyhole limpet hemocyanin<br>
generally are useful as immunogens. The polypeptides are conjugated at the same<br>
sites denoted for amino acids. The metabolic products described above may<br>
retain a substantial degree of immunological cross reactivity with the compounds<br>
of the invention. Thus, the antibodies of this invention will be capable of binding<br>
to the unprotected compounds of the invention without binding to the protected<br>
compounds. Alternatively the metabolic products will be capable of binding to<br>
the protected compounds and/or the metabolitic products without binding to the<br>
protected compounds of the Invention, or will be capable of binding specifically<br>
to any one or all three. The antibodies desirably will not substantially cross-react<br>
with naturally-occurring materials. Substantial cross-reactivity is reactivity under<br>
specific assay conditions for specific analytes sufficient to interfere with the assay<br>
results.<br>
The immunogens of this invention contain the compound of this invention<br>
presenting the desired epitope in association with an immunogenic substance.<br>
Within the context of the invention such association means covalent bonding to<br>
form an immunogenic conjugate (when applicable) or a mixture of non-covalently<br>
bonded materials, or a combination of the above. Immunogenic substances<br>
include adjuvants such as Freirnd's adjuvant, immunogenic proteins such as viral,<br>
bacterial, yeast, plant and animal polypeptides, in particular keyhole limpet<br>
hemocyanin, serum albumin, bovine thyroglobulin or soybean trypsin inhibitor,<br>
and immunogenic polysaccharides. Typically, the compound having the<br>
structure of the desired epitope is covalently conjugated to an immunogenic<br>
polypeptide or polysaccharide by the use of a polyfunctional (ordinarily<br>
bifunctional) cross-linking agent. Methods for the manufacture of hapten<br>
immunogens are conventional per se, and any of the methods used heretofore for<br>
conjugating haptens to immunogenic polypeptides or the like are suitably<br>
employed here as well, taking into account the functional groups on the<br>
precursors or hydroly tic products which are available for cross-linking and the<br>
likelihood of producing antibodies specific to the epitope in question as opposed<br>
to the immunogenic substance.<br>
Typically the polypeptide is conjugated to a site on the compound of the<br>
invention distant from the epitope to be recognized.<br>
The conjugates are prepared in conventional fashion. For example, the<br>
cross-linking agents N-hydroxysuccinimide, succinic anhydride or alkN=C=Nalk<br>
are useful in preparing the conjugates of this invention. The conjugates comprise<br>
a compound of the invention attached by a bond or a linking group of 1-100,<br>
typically, 1-25, more typically 1-10 carbon atoms to the immunogenic substance.<br>
The conjugates are separated from starting materials and by products using<br>
chromatography or the like, and then are sterile filtered and vialed for storage.<br>
Animals are typically immunized against the immunogenic conjugates or<br>
derivatives and antisera or monoclonal antibodies prepared in conventional<br>
fashion.<br>
The compounds of this invention are useful as linkers, spacers or affinity<br>
(typically hydrophobia) moieties in preparing affinity absorption matrices. The<br>
compounds of the invention optionally are bound covalentiy to an insoluble<br>
matrix and used for affinity chromatography separations, depending on the<br>
nature of the groups of the compounds, for example compounds with pendant<br>
aryi groups are useful in making hydrophobic affinity columns.<br>
They also are useful as linkers and spacers in preparing immobilized<br>
enzymes for process control, or in making immunoassay reagents. The<br>
compounds herein contain functional groups that are suitable as sites for crosslinking<br>
desired substances. For example, it is conventional to link affinity<br>
reagents such as hormones, peprides, antibodies, drugs, to insoluble substrates.<br>
These insolublized reagents are employed in known fashion to absorb binding<br>
partners for the affinity reagents from manufactured preparations, diagnostic<br>
samples and other impure mixtures. Similarly, immobilized enzymes are used to<br>
perform catalytic conversions with facile recovery of enzyme. Bifunctional<br>
compounds are commonly used to link analy tes to detectable groups in preparing<br>
diagnostic reagents.<br>
The compounds of this invention axe labeled with detectable moieties such<br>
biotin, radioisotopes, enzymes for diagnostic purposes. Suitable techniques for<br>
accomplishing the labeling of the compounds of the formulas of this invention are<br>
well known and will be apparent to the artisan from consideration of this<br>
specification as a whole. For example, one suitable site for labeling is JR.17 or R19.<br>
- More typically, however, the compounds of the invention are employed for<br>
the treatment or prophylaxis of viral infections such as yellow fever virus, Dengue<br>
virus, hepatitis B virus; ^hepatitis G virus, Classical Swine Fever virus or the<br>
Border Disease Virus, biitmore particularly Flaviviral or Picornaviral infections,,<br>
in particular, HCV and BVDV. .<br>
The therapeutic compound(s) of this invention are administered to a<br>
subject mammal (including a human) by any means well known in the art, <br>
, intranasally, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, intradermally,<br>
irfclavenously, mtra-arterially, parenterally or by catheteiitation. The<br>
therapeutically effective amount of the compound (s) is a Flavi viral or Picomaviral<br>
growth inhibiting amount More preferably, it is a Flaviviral or Picornaviral<br>
replication inhibiting amount or a Flaviviral or Picornaviral enzyme inhibiting<br>
amount of the compounds of the formulas of this invention. This is believed to<br>
correspond to an amount which ensures a plasma level of between about lug/ml<br>
and 100 mg/ml, optionally of 10 mg/ml. This optionally is achieved by<br>
administration of a dosage of in the range of 0.001 mg to 60 mg, preferably 0.01<br>
mg to 10 mg, preferably 0.1 mg to 1 mg per day per kg bodyweight for humans.<br>
These ore starting points for determining the optimal dosage of the compound, of<br>
this invention. The actual amount will depend upon many factors known to the<br>
artisan, including bioavariability of the compound, whether it contains a prodrug<br>
functionality, its metabolism and distribution in the subject and its potency,<br>
among others. It typically is necessary to determine the proper dosing in the<br>
clinical setting, and this is well within the skill of the ordinary artisan. The<br>
therapeutically effective amount of the compound(s) of this invention optionally<br>
are divided into several sub-units per day or are administered at daily or more<br>
than one day intervals, depending upon the pathologic condition to be treated,<br>
the patient's condition and the nature of the compound of this invention.<br>
As is conventional in the art, the evaluation of a synergistic effect in a drug<br>
combination may be made by analyzing the quantification of the interactions<br>
between individual drugs, using the median effect principle described by Chou et<br>
aL in Adv. Enzyme Reg. (1984) 22:27 or tests such as, but not limited to, the<br>
isobologram method, as previously described by Elion et al. in /. Biol Chem, (1954)<br>

The compounds of the invention are employed for the treatment or<br>
prophylaxis of viral infections, more particularly Flaviviral or Picornaviral<br>
infections, in particular, HCV and BVDV. When using one or more derivatives of<br>
the formula (A) as defined herein:<br>
- the active ingredients of the compound (s) may be administered to the<br>
mammal (including a human) to be treated by any means well known in the<br>
art, i.e. orally, intranasally, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, intradermally,<br>
intravenously, intra-arterially, parenterally or by catheterization.<br>
the therapeutically effective Jimount of the preparation of the compound(s),<br>
especially for the treatment of viral infections in humans and other mammals,<br>
preferably is a Flaviviral or Picornaviral enzyme inhibiting amount. More<br>
preferably, it is a Flaviviral or Picornaviral replication inhibiting amount or a<br>
Flaviviral or Picornaviral enzyme inhibiting amount of the derivative(s) of<br>
formula (A) as defined herein corresponds to an amount which ensures a<br>
plasma level of between lug/ml and 100 mg/ml, optionally of 10 mg/ml. This<br>
can be achieved by administration of a dosage of in the range of 0.001 mg to 20<br>
mg, preferably 0.01 mg to 5 mg, preferably O.lmg to 1 mg per day per kg<br>
bodyweight for humans. Depending upon the pathologic condition to be<br>
treated and the patient's condition, the said effective amount may be divided<br>
into several sub-units per day or may be administered at more than one day<br>
intervals.<br>
The present invention further relates to a method for preventing or treating<br>
a viral infections in a subject or patient by administering to the patient in need<br>
thereof a therapeutically effective amount imidazo[4,5-d]pyrimidine derivatives<br>
of the present invention. The therapeutically effective amount of the preparation<br>
of the compound(s), especially for the treatment of viral infections in humans and<br>
other mammals, preferably is a Flaviviral or Picornaviral enzyme inhibiting<br>

condition to be treated and the patient's condition, the said effective amount may<br>
be divided into several sub-units per day or may be administered at more than<br>
one day intervals.<br>
This principle may be applied to a combination of different antiviral drugs<br>
of the invention or to a combination of the antiviral drugs of the invention with<br>
other drugs that exhibit anti-BVDV or anti-HCV activity.<br>
The invention thus relates to a pharmaceutical composition or combined<br>
preparation having synergistic effects against a viral infection and containing:<br>
Either:<br>
A) a combination of two or more of the imidazo[4,5-d]pyrimidine<br>
derivatives of the present invention/ and<br>

compositions or combined preparations of this invention include, for instance,<br>
interferon-alfa (either pegylated or not), ribavirin and other selective inhibitors of<br>
the replication of BVDV or HCV.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition or combined preparation with synergistic<br>
activity against viral infection a ccording to this invention may contain the<br>
imidazo[4,5-d]pyrimidine derivatives of the present invention over a broad<br>
content range depending on the contemplated use and the expected effect of the<br>

the present invention of the combined preparation is within the range of 0.1 to<br>
99.9% by weight, preferably from 1 to 99% by weight, more preferably from 5 to<br>

According to a particular embodiment of the invention, the compounds of<br>
the invention may be employed in combination with other therapeutic agents for<br>
the treatment or prophylaxis of Flaviviral or Picornaviral infections, optionally,<br>

(b) one or more Flaviviral or Picornaviral enzyme inhibitors as<br>
biologically active agents in respective proportions such as to provide a<br>
synergistic effect against a viral infection, particularly a Flaviviral or Picornaviral<br>
infection in a mammal, for instance in the form of a combined preparation for<br>
simultaneous, separate or sequential use in viral infection therapy, such as of<br>
HCv, BVDV and Coxsackie virus. Examples of such further therapeutic agents for<br>

inhibiting amount of derivative (a) and a Flaviviral or Picornaviral enzyme<br>
inhibiting amount of inhibitor (b). Still more particularly when the said<br>
Flaviviral or Picornaviral enzyme inhibitor (b) is a polymerase inhibitor, its<br>

acceptable compound. All salts, whether or not derived form a physiologically<br>
acceptable acid or base, are within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Isomers<br>
The term "isomers" as used herein means all possible isomeric forms,<br>
including tautomeric and stereochemical forms, which the compounds of the<br>
formulas of this invention may possess, but not including position isomers.<br>
Typically, the structures shown herein exemplify only one tautomeric or<br>
resonance form of the compounds, but the corresponding alternative<br>
configurations are contemplated as well. Unless otherwise stated, the chemical<br>
designation of compounds denotes the mixture of all possible stereochemically<br>
isomeric forms, said mixtures containing all diastereomers and enantiomers (since<br>
the compounds of the formulas of this invention may have one or more chiral<br>
centers), as well as the stereochemically pure or enriched isomers. More<br>
particularly, stereogenic centers may have either the R- or S-configuration, and<br>
double or triple bonds optionally are in either the cis- or trans-configuration.<br>
Enriched isomeric forms of a compound of this invention are defined as a<br>
single isomer substantially free of the compound's other enantiomers or<br>
diastereomers. In particular, the term "stereoisomerically enriched" or "chirally<br>
enriched" relates to compounds having a single stereoisomeric proportion of at<br>
least about 80% (Le. at least 90% of one isomer and at most 10% of the other<br>
ppsible isomers), preferably at least 90%, more preferably at least 94% and most<br>
preferably at least 97%. The terms "enantiomerically pure" and<br>
"diastereornerically pure" contain undetectable levels of any other isomer.<br>
Separation of stereoisomers is accomplished by standard methods known<br>
to those in the art One enantiomer of a compound of the Invention can be<br>
separated substantially free of its opposing enantiomer by a method such as<br>
formation of diastereomers using optically active resolving agents<br>
("Stereochemistry of Carbon Compounds," (1962) by E. L. Eliel, McGraw Hill;<br>
Lochmuller, C. H,, (1975) J- Chromatogr., 113:(3) 283-302). Separation of isomers<br>
in ft mixture can be accomplished by any suitable method, including: (1)<br>
formation of ionic, diastereomeric salts with chiral compounds and separation by<br>
fractional crystallization or other methods, (2) formation of diastereomeric<br>
compounds with chiral derivatizing reagents, separation of the diastereorrvers,<br>
and conversion to the pure enantiomers, or (3) enantiomers can be separated<br>
directly under chiral conditions. Under method (1), diastereomeric salts can be<br>
formed by reaction of enantiomerically pure chiral bases such as brucine, quinine,<br>
ephedrine, strychnine, a-methyi-b-phenylethylamine (amphetamine), with<br>
asymmetric compounds bearing an acidic functionality, such as carboxylic acid<br>
and sulfonic acid.<br>
The diastereomeric salts optionally are induced to separate by fractional<br>
crystallisation or ionic chromatography. For separation of the optical isomers of<br>
amino compounds, addition of chiral carboxylic or sulfonic acids, such as<br>
camphorsulfonic acid, tartaric acid, mandelic acid, or lactic acid can result in<br>
formation of the diastereomeric sa4ts. Alternatively, by method (2), the substrate<br>
to-be-resolved may be reacted with one enantiomer-of-a-ehiral-compound to form<br>
a diastereomeric pair (Eliel, E. and Wilen, S. (1994). Stereochemistry of Organic<br>
Compounds, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., p. 322). Diastereomeric compounds can be<br>
formed by reacting asymmetric compounds with enantiomerically pure chiral<br>
derivatizing reagents, such as menthyl derivatives, foEowed by separation of the<br>
diastereomers and hydrolysis to yield the free, enantiomerically enriched<br>
xanthene. A method of determining optical purity involves making chiral esters,<br>
s2feh as a menthyl ester or Mosher ester, a-methoxy-a-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl<br>
acetete (Jacob ffi. (1982) J, Org. Chem. 47:4165), of the racemic mixture, and<br>
analysing the NMR spectrum for the presence of the two atropisomeric<br>
diastereomers. Stable diastereomers can be separated and isolated by normaland<br>
reverse-phase chromatography following methods for separation of<br>
atropisomeric ivaphthyl-isoquJnolines (Hoye, T., WO 96/15111). Under method<br>
(3), a racerruc mixture of two asymmetric enantiorners is separated by<br>
chromatography using a chiral stationary phase. Suitable chiral stationary phases<br>
are, for example, polysaccharides, in particular cellulose or amylose derivatives.<br>
CoxruxxerciaJly available pplysaccharide based chiral stationary phases are<br>
OuralCel™ CA, OA, OB5, OC5, OD, OF, OG, OJ and OK, and Chkalpak™ AD,<br>
AS, OP(-t-) and OT(+). Appropriate eluents or mobile phases for use in<br>
combination with said polysaccharide chiral stationary phases are hexane,<br>
modified with an alcohol such as ethanol, isopropanol. ("Chiral Liquid<br>
Chromatography" (1989) W. J. Lough, Ed. Chapman and Hall, New York;<br>
Okamoto, (1990). "Optical resolution of dihydropyridine enantiomers by Highperformance<br>
liquid chromatography using phenylcarbamates of polysaccharides<br>
as a chiral stationary phase", J. of Chromatogr. 513:375-378).<br>
As used herein and unless otherwise stated, the term " enantiomer " means<br>
each individual optically active form of a compound of the invention, having an<br>
optical purity or enantiomeric excess (as determined by methods standard in the<br>
art) of at least 80% (i.e. at least 90% of one enantiomer and at most 10% of the.<br>
other enantiomer), preferably at least 90% and more preferably at least 98%.<br>
The term, "isomers" as used herein means all possible isomeric forms,<br>
_jncluding tautomeric and sterochemical forms, w^hich the compounds of the<br>
formulas of this invention may possess, but not including position isomers.<br>
Typically, the structures shown herein exemplify only one tautomeric or<br>
resonance form of the compounds, but the corresponding alternative<br>
configurations are contemplated as well. Unless otherwise stated, the chemical<br>
designation of compounds denotes the mixture of all possible stareochemically<br>
isomeric forms, said mixtures containing all diastereomers and enarvtiorners<br>
fejyice the compounds of the formulas of this invention may have at least one<br>
chiral center) of the basic molecule structure, as wel as the stereochemically pure<br>
or enriched compounds. More pajticularly, stereogenic centers may have either<br>
the R- or S-configuration, and multiple bonds may have either cis- or transconfiguration.<br>
Pure isomeric forms of the said compounds are defined as isomers<br>
substantially free of other enantiomeric or diastereomeric forms of the same basic<br>
molecular structure. In particular, the term "stereoisomerically pure" or "chirally<br>
pure" relates to compounds having a stereoisomeric excess of at least about 80%<br>
(i.e. at least 90% of one isomer and at Baost 10% of the other possible Isomers),<br>
preferably at least 90%, more preferably at least 94% and most preferably at least<br>
97%. The terms "enantioiuerically pure" and "diastereomerically pure" should be<br>
understood in a similar way, having regard to the enantiomeric excess,<br>
respectively the diastereomeric excess, of the mixture in question.<br>
Separation of stereoisomers is accomplished by standard methods known<br>
to those in the art. One enantiorner of a compound of the invention can be<br>
separated substantially free of its opposing enantiomer by a method such as<br>
formation of diastereomers using optically active resolving agents<br>
("Stereochemistry of Carbon Compounds," (1962) by E. L. Eliel, McGraw Hill;<br>
Lochmuller, C. Hv (1975) J. Chromatogr., 113:(3) 283-302). Separation of isomers in<br>
a mixture can be accomplished by any suitable method, including: (I) formation<br>
of ionic, diastereomeric salts with chiral compounds and separation by fractional<br>
crystallization or other methods, (2) formation of diastereomeric compounds with<br>
chiral derivatmng reagents, separation of the diastereomers, and conversion to<br>
the pure enantiomers^of-^J-enannomers can be separated directly under chiral<br>
conditions. Under method (1), diastereomeric salts can be formed by reaction of<br>
enantiornerically pure chiral bases such as brucine, quinine, ephedrine,<br>
strychnine, a-methyl-b-phenylethylamine (amphetamine), with asymmetric<br>
compounds bearing acidic functionality, such as carboxylic acid and sulfonic acid.<br>
The diastereomeric salts may be induced to separate by fractional<br>
crystallization or ionic chromatography. For separation of the optical isomers of<br>
amino compounds, addition of chiral carboxylic or sulfonic acids, such as<br>
camphorsulfonic acid, tartaric acid, mandelic acid, or lactic acid can result in<br>
fonnation of the diastereomeric salts. Alternatively, by method (2), the substrate<br>
to be resolved may be reacted with one enantiomer of a chiral compound to form,<br>
a diastereomeric pair {Eliel, E. and Wilert, S. (1994) Stereochemistry of Organic<br>
Compounds, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., p. 322), Diastereomeric compounds can be<br>
formed by reacting asymmetric compounds with enantiomerically pure chiral<br>
derivatizing reagents, such as menthyl derivatives, followed by separation of the<br>
diastereomers and hydrolysis to yield the free, enantiomerically enriched<br>
scamhene. A method of determining QpticzU. polity involves making crural esters,<br>
jiuch as a menthyl ester or Mosher ester, a-methoxy-a-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl<br>
acetate (Jacob EL (1982) J. Org. Cham. 47:4165), of the racemic mixture, and<br>
analyzing the NMR spectrum for the presence of the two atropisomeric<br>
diastereomers- Stable diastereomers can be separated and isolated by normal- and<br>
reverse-phase chromatography following methods for separation of atropisomeric<br>
iiaphthyl-isoquinolines (Hoye, T., WO 96/15111). Under method (3), a racemic<br>
mixture of two asymmetric enantiomers is separated by chromatography \ising a<br>
dural stationary phase. Suitable chiral stationary phases are, for example,<br>
polysaccharides, in particular cellulose or amylose derivatives. Commercially<br>
available polysaccharide based chiral stationary phases are CruralCe!™ CA, OA,<br>
OB5, OC5, OD, OF, OG, OJ and OK, and ChiralpaklM AD, AS, OP(-i-) and OT(+).<br>
Appropriate eiuents or mobile phases for use in combination-with said<br>
polysaccharide chiral stationary phases are hexane, modified with an alcohol such<br>
as ethanol, isopropanol ("Chiral Liquid Chromatography" (1989) W. ]. Lough, Ed,<br>
Chapman and Hall, New York; Okamoto, (1990) "Optical resolution of<br>
dihydropyridine enantiomers by High-performance liquid chromatography using<br>
phenyicarbamates of poly saccharides as a chiral stationary phase", J. of<br>
Chromatogr. 513:375-378).<br>
The terms cis and trans are used herein in accordance with Chemical<br>
Abstracts nomenclature and include reference to the position of the substituents<br>
on a ring moiety, The absolute stereochemical configuration of the compounds of<br>
f&amp;mula (1) may easily be determined by those skilled in the art while using wellknown<br>
methods such as, for example, X-ray diffraction.<br>
Metabolites<br>
The present invention also provides the in vivo metabolic products of the<br>
compounds described herein, to the extent such products are novel and<br>
unobvious over the prior art. Such products may result for example from the<br>
oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, amidation, esterification of the administered<br>
compound, primarily due to enzymatic processes. Accordingly, the invention<br>
includes novel and unob vious compounds produced by a process comprising<br>
contacting a compound of this invention with a mammal for a period of time<br>
sufficient to yield a metabolic product thereof.. Such products typically are<br>
identified by preparing a radiolabelled (e.g. CH or H3) compound of the<br>
invention, administering it parenterally in a detectable dose (e.g. greater than<br>
about 0.5 mg/kg) to an anifnal such as rat, mouse, guinea pig, monkey, or to man,<br>
allowing sufficient time for metabolism to occur (typically about 30 seconds to 30<br>
hours) and isolating its conversion products from the urine, blood or other<br>
biological samples. These products are easily isolated since they are labeled<br>
(others are isolated by the use of antibodies capable of binding epitopes surviving<br>
in the metabolite). The metabolite structures are determined in conventional<br>
fashion, e.g. by MS or NMR analysis. In general, analysis of metabolites is done in<br>
the same way as conventional drug metabolism studies well-known to those<br>
skilled in the art. The conversion prodvirtq, so long w they ar
found in vivo, are useful in diagnostic assays for therapeutic dosing of the<br>
-compounds of the invention even if they_passessLno^tiyiral activity of their own.<br>
Formulations<br>
The compounds of the invention optionally are formulated with<br>
conventional pharmaceutical carders and excipients, which will be selected in<br>
accord with ordinary practice. Tablets will contain excipients, glidants, fillers,<br>
binders. Aqueous formulations are prepared in sterile form, and when intended<br>
AJK 'delivery by other than oral administration generally will be isotonic.<br>
Formulations optionally contain excipients such as those set fonti in the<br>
"Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients" (1986) and include ascorbic acid and<br>
other antioxidants, chelating agents such as EDTA, carbohydrates such as dextrin,<br>
hydroxyalkylcellulose, hydroxyalkylmethylcellulose, stearic acid.<br>
Subsequently, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" as used<br>
herein means any material or substance with which the active ingredient is<br>
formulated in order to facilitate its application or dissemination to the locus to be<br>
treated, for instance by dissolving, dispersing or diffusing the said composition,<br>
and/or to facilitate its storage, transport en liandlirtg without Impairing its<br>
effectiveness. The pharmaceutically acceptable carrier may be a solid or a liquid<br>
or a gas which has been compressed to form a liquid, i.e. the compositions of this<br>
invention can suitably be used as concentrates, emulsions, solutions, granulates,<br>
dusts, sprays, aerosols, suspensions, ointments, creams, tablets, pellets or<br>
powders.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutical carriers for use in the said pharmaceutical<br>
compositions and their formulation are well Icnown to those skilled in the art, and<br>
there is no particular restriction to their selection within the present invention.<br>
They may also include additives such as wetting agents, dispersing agents,<br>
stickers, adhesives, emulsifying agents, solvents, coatings, antibacterial and<br>
antifungal agents (for example phenol, sorbic acid, chlorobutanol), isotonic agents<br>
(such as sugars or sodium chloride), provided the same are consistent with<br>
pharmaceutical practice, Le. carriers and additives which do not create permanent<br>
damage to mammals. The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention<br>
may be prepared in any known-maimerr-f or- instance by homogeneously mixing;<br>
coating and/or grinding the active ingredients, in a one-step or multi-steps<br>
procedure, with the selected carrier material. Where appropriate, the other<br>
additives such as surface-active agents are prepared by micronisation, for instance<br>
in view to obtain them in the form of microspheres usually having a diameter of<br>
about 1 to 10 gm, namely for the manufacture of microcapsules for controlled or<br>
sustained release of the active ingredients.<br>
Suitable surface-active -igents, also known as emulgent or emulsifier, to be<br>
used in the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are non-ionic,<br>
cationic and/or anionic materials having good emulsifying, dispersing and/or<br>
wetting properties. Suitable anionic surfactants include both water-soluble soaps<br>
and water-soluble synthetic surface-active agents. Suitable soaps are alkaline or<br>
alkaline-earth, metal salts, unsubstituted or substituted ammonium salts of higher<br>
fatty acids (C^C^), e.g. the sodium or potassium salts of oleic or stearic acid, or of<br>
natural fatty acid mixtures obtainable form coconut oil or tallow oil. Synthetic<br>
surfactants include sodium or calcium salts of polyacrylic acids; fatty sulphonates<br>
and sulphates; sulphonated benzimidazole derivatives and alkylarylsulphbnates.<br>
Fatty sulphonates or sulphates are usually in the form of alkaline or alkaline-earth<br>
metal salts, unsubstituted ammonium salts or ammonium salts substituted with<br>
an alkyl or acyl radical having from 8 to 22 carbon atoms, e.g. the sodium or<br>
calcium salt of lignosulphoriic acid or dodecylsulphonic acid or a mixture of fatty<br>
alcohol sulphates obtained from natural fatty acids, alkaline or alkaline-earth<br>
metal salts of sulphuric or sulphonic acid esters (such as sodium lauryl sulphate)<br>
and sulphonic acids of fatty alcohol/ethylene oxide adducts. Suitable<br>
sulphonated benzimidazole derivatives preferably contain 8 to 22 carbon atoms.<br>
Examples of alkylarylsulphonates are the sodium, calcium or alcoholamine salts<br>
of dodecylbenzene sulphonic acid or dibutyl-naphthalenesulphonic acid or a<br>
naphthalene-sulphonic acid/formaldehyde condensation product. Also suitable<br>
are the corresponding phosphates, e.g. salts of phosphoric acid ester and an<br>
adduct of p-nonylphenol with ethylene and/or propylene oxide, or<br>
phospholipids. Suitable phospholipids for this purpose are the natural<br>
(originating from animal or plant cells) or synthetic phospholipids of the cephalin<br>
or lecithin type such as e.g. phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine,<br>
phosphatidylglycerine, lysolecitliin, cardiolipin, dioctanylphosphatidyl-choline,<br>
dipalmitoylphoshatidyl -choline and their mixtures.<br>
Suitable non-ionic surfactants include polyethoxylated and<br>
f*blypropoxylated derivatives of alkylphenols, fatty alcohols, fatty acids, aliphatic<br>
amines or amides containing at least 12 carbon atoms in the molecule,<br>
aJkylarenesulphonates and dialkylsulphosuccinates, such as polyglycol ether<br>
derivatives of aliphatic and cydoaliphatic alcohols, saturated and unsaturated<br>
fatty acids and alkylphenols, said derivatives preferably containing 3 to 10 glycol<br>
ether groups and S to 20 carbon atoms in the (aliphatic) hydrocarbon moiety and 6<br>
to 18 carbon atoms in the alkyl moiety of the alkylphenpL Further suitable nonionic<br>
surfactants are water-soluble adducts of polyethylene oxide with<br>
poylypropylene glycol, ethylenediairunopolypropylene glycol containing 1 to 10<br>
carbon atoms in the alkyl chain, which adducts contain 20 to 250 ethyleneglycol<br>
ether groups and/or 10 to 100 propyleneglycol ether groups. Such compounds<br>
usually contain from I to 5 ethyleneglycol units per propyleneglycoi unit.<br>
Representative examples of non-ionic surfactants are nonylphenol -<br>
polyethoxyethanol, castor oil polyglycolic ethers, polypropylene/polyethylene<br>
oxide adducts, uibutylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol, polyethyleneglycol and<br>
octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol. patty acid esters of polyethylene sorbitan (such<br>
as polyoxyethylene sorbitan trioleate), glycerol, sorbitan, sucrose and<br>
pentaerythritol are also suitable r.on-ionic surfactants.<br>
Suitable cationic surfactants include quaternary ammonium salts,<br>
particularly halides, having 4 hydrocarbon radicals optionally substituted with<br>
halo, phenyi, substituted phenyl or hydroxy; for instance quaternary ammonium<br>

Surfactants, (Chemical Publishing Co.. New York, 1981).<br>
Compounds of the invention and their physiologically acceptable salts<br>
(hereafter collectively referred to as the active ingredients) may be administered<br>
by any route appropriate to the condition to be treated, suitable routes including<br>
oral, rectal, nasal, topical (including ocular, buccal and sublingual), vaginal and<br>
parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intradermal,<br>
intrathecal and epidural). The preferred route of administration may vary with<br>
for example the condition of the recipient.<br>
While it is possible for the active ingredients to be administered alone it is<br>
preferable to present them as pharmaceutical formulations. The formulations,<br>
both for veterinary and for human use, of the present invention comprise at least<br>
one active ingredient, as above described, together with one or more<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carriers therefore and optionally other, therapeutic<br>
ingredients. The carrier(s) optimally are "acceptable" in the sense of being<br>
compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to<br>
the recipient thereof. The formulations include those suitable for oral, rectal,<br>
nasal, topical (including buccal and sublingual), vaginal or parenteral (including<br>
subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intradermal, intrathecal and epidural)<br>
administration. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage<br>
form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of<br>
pharmacy. Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active<br>
ingredient with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients.<br>
In general the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing<br>
into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid<br>
carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.<br>
Formulations of the present invention suitable for oral administration may<br>
be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing<br>
a predetermined amount of the active ingredient; as a powder or granules; as<br>
solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or a non-aqueous liquid; or as an<br>
oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a. water-in-oil liquid emulsion. The active<br>
ingredient may also be presented as a bolus, electuary or paste.<br>
70<br>
A tablet may be made by compression or molding, optionally with one or<br>
more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by<br>
compressing in a suitable maclune the active ingredient in a free-flowing form<br>
such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert<br>
diluent, preservative, surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be<br>
made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound<br>
moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or<br>
scored and may be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the<br>
active ingredient therein. For infections of the eye or other external tissues e.g.<br>
mouth and skin, the formulations are optionally applied as a topical ointment or<br>
cream containing the active ingredient(s) in an amount of, for example, 0.075 to<br>
20% w/w (including active ingredient(s) in a range between 0.1% and 20% in<br>
increments of 0.1% w/w such as 0.6% w/w, 0.7% w/w, etc), preferably 0.2 to 15%<br>
w/w and most preferably 0.5 to 10% w/w. When formulated in an ointment, the<br>
active ingredients may be employed with either a paraffinic or a water-miscible<br>
ointment base. Alternatively, the active ingredients may be formulated in a cream<br>
with an oil-in-water cream base. If desired, the aqueous phase of the cream base<br>
may include, for example, at least 30% w/w of a polyhydric alcohol, i.e. an<br>
alcohol having two or more hydroxyl groups such as propylene glycol, butane<br>
1,3-diol, rnannitol, sorbitol/ glycerol and polyethylene glycol (including PEG400)<br>
and mixtures thereof. The topical formulations may desirably include a<br>
compound which enhances absorption or penetration of the active ingredient<br>
through the skin or other affected areas. Examples of such dermal penetration<br>
enhancers include dimethylsulfoxide and related analogs.<br>
The oily phase of the emulsions of this invention may be constituted from<br>
known ingredients in a known manner. While the phase may comprise merely an<br>
emulsifier (otherwise known as an emulgent), it desirably comprises a mixture of<br>
at least one emulsifier with a fat or an oil or with both a fat and an oil. Optionally,<br>
a hydrophilic emulsifier is included together with a lipophilic emulsifier which<br>
acts as a stabilizer. It is also preferred to include both an oil and a fat. Together,<br>
the emulsifier(s) with or without stabilizer(s) make up the so-called emulsifying<br>
wax/ and the wax together with the oil and fat make up the so-called emulsifying<br>
ointment base which forms the oily dispersed phase of the cream formulations.<br>
The choice of suitable oils or fats for the formulation is based on achieving<br>
the desired cosmetic properties, since the solubility of the active compound in<br>
most oils likely to be used in pharmaceutical emulsion formulations is very low.<br>
Thus the cream should optionally be a non-greasy, non-staining and washable<br>
product with suitable consistency to avoid leakage from tubes or other containers.<br>
Straight or branched chain, mono- or dibasic alkyl esters such as di-isoadipate,<br>
isocetyl stearate, propylene glycol diester of coconut fatty acids, isopropyl<br>
myristate, decyl oleate, isopropyl palmitate, butyl stearate, 2-ethylhexyl palmitate<br>
or a blend of branched chain esters known as Crodamol CAP may be used, the<br>
last three being preferred esters. These may be used alone or in combination<br>
depending on the properties required. Alternatively, high melting point lipids<br>
such as white soft paraffin and/or liquid paraffin or other mineral oils can be<br>
used.<br>
Formulations suitable for topical administration to the eye also include eye<br>
drops wherein the active ingredient is dissolved or suspended in a suitable<br>
carrier, especially an aqueous solvent for the active ingredient. The active<br>
ingredient is optionally present in such formulations in a concentration of 0.5 to<br>
20%, advantageously 0.5 to 10% particularly about 1.5% w/w. Formulations<br>
suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges comprising the<br>
active ingredient in a flavored basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth;<br>
pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert basis such as gelatin and<br>
glycerin, or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active<br>
ingredient in a suitable liquid carrier.<br>
Formulations for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository<br>
with a suitable base comprising for example cocoa butter or a salicylate.<br>
Formulations suitable for nasal administration wherein the carrier is a solid<br>
include a coarse powder having a particle size for example in the range 20 to 500<br>
microns (including particle sizes in a range between 20 and 500 microns in<br>
increments of 5 microns such as 30 microns, 35 microns, etc), which is<br>
administered in the manner in which snuff is taken, i.e. by rapid inhalation<br>
through the nasal passage from a container of the powder held close up to the<br>
nose. Suitable formulations wherein the carrier is a liquid, for administration as<br>
for example a nasal spray or as nasal drops, include aqueous or oily solutions of<br>
the active ingredient. Formulations suitable for aerosol administration may be<br>
prepared according to conventional methods and may be delivered with other<br>
therapeutic agents.<br>
Formulations suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as<br>
pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations containing<br>
in addition to the active ingredient such carriers as are known in the art to be<br>
appropriate.<br>
Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and<br>
non-aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers,<br>
bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of<br>
the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which<br>
may include suspending agents and thickening agents. The formulations may be<br>
presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and<br>
vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only<br>
the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injections,<br>
immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions<br>
may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind<br>
previously described.<br>
Preferred unit dosage formulations are those containing a daily dose or<br>
unit daily sub-dose, as herein above recited, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of<br>
an active ingredient.<br>
It should be understood that in addition to the ingredients particularly<br>
mentioned above the formulations of this invention may include other agents<br>
conventional in the art having regard to the type of formulation in question, for<br>
example those suitable for oral administration may include flavoring agents.<br>
Compounds of the invention can be used to provide controlled release<br>
pharmaceutical formulations containing as active ingredient one or more<br>
compounds of the invention ("controlled release formulations") in which the<br>
•^tlease of the active ingredient can be controlled and regulated to allow less<br>
frequency dosing or to improve the pharmacokinetic or toxicity profile of a given<br>
invention compound. Controlled release formulations adapted for oral<br>
administration in which discrete units comprising one or more compounds of the<br>
invention can be prepared according to conventional methods.<br>
Additional ingredients may be included in order to control the duration of<br>
action of the active ingredient in the composition. Control release compositions<br>
may thus be achieved by selecting appropriate polymer carriers such as for<br>
example polyesters, polyamino adds, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, ethylene-vinyl<br>
acetate copolymers, mettvylceUulose, carboxymethylcelluJose, protomme stilfate.<br>
The rate of drug release and duration of action may also be controlled by<br>
incorporating the active ingredient into particles, e.g. microcapsules, of a<br>
polymeric substance such as hydrogels, polylactic acid, hydroxymethylcellulose,<br>
polymethyl methacrylate and the other above-described polymers. Such methods<br>
include colloid drug delivery systems like liposomes, microspheres,<br>
microernulsions, nanoparticles, nanocapsules and so oru Depending on the route<br>
of administration, the pharmaceutical composition may require protective<br>
coatings. Pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectionable use include sterile<br>
aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous<br>
preparation thereof. Typical carriers for this purpose therefore include<br>
biocompatible aqueous buffers, etihanol, glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene<br>
glycol and mixtures thereof.<br>

combination, they do not necessarily bring out their joint therapeutic effect<br>
-jdirectly_atthe same time in me mammal to heLtreaied, Jaej:orresponding<br>
• composition may also be in the form of a medical kit or package containing the<br>
two ingredients in separate but adjacent repositories or compartments. In the<br>
latter context, each active ingredient may therefore be formulated in a way<br>
' suitable for an adcniriistration route different from that of the other ingredient,<br>
e.g. one of them may be in the form of an oral or parenteral formulation, whereas<br>
*Btt&amp; other is in the form of an ampoule for intravenous injection or an aerosol.<br>
Suitable methods for drug delivery include colloid drug delivery systems<br>
like liposomes, microspheres, microemulsions, nanoparticles, nanocapsules and<br>
so on. Depending on the route of administration, the pharmaceutical composition.<br>
may require protective coatings, Pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectionable<br>
use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the<br>
extemporaneous preparation thereof. Typical carriers for this purpose therefore<br>
include biocompatible aqueous buffers, ethanol, glycerol, propylene glycol,<br>
polyethylene glycol and mixtures thereof.<br>
SeviSrral active ingredients used in combination may not necessarily bring<br>
out their joint therapeutic effect directly at the same time in the mammal to be<br>
treated. Thus, the corresponding composition may also be in the form of a<br>
medical kit or package containing the two ingredients in separate but adjacent<br>
repositories or compartments. In the latter context, each active ingredient may<br>
therefore be formulated in a way suitable for an administration route different<br>
from that of the other ingredient, e,g. one of them may be in the form of an oral <br>
parenteral formulation whereas the other is in the form of an ampoule for<br>
intravenous injection or an aerosol.<br>

(Table Removed) The compounds of the formulas of this invention are prepared using <br>
series of chemical reactions well known, to those skilled in the art, altogether<br>
making up the process for preparing said compounds and exemplified further.<br>
The processes described further are only meant as examples and by no means are<br>
meant to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
The invention also relates to methods of making the compositions of the<br>
invention. The compositions are prepared by any of the applicable techniques of<br>
organic synthesis. Many such techniques are well known in the art. However,<br>
many of the known techniques are elaborated in "Compendium of Organic<br>
Synthetic Methods" (John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York), Vol. 1, Ian T. Harrison and<br>
Shuyen Harrison, 1971; Vol. 2, Ian T. Harrison and Shuyen Harrison, 1974; Vol. 3,<br>

Exemplary methods tor the preparation of the compositions of the<br>
yention are provided below. These methods are intended to illustrate the<br>
nature of such preparations, and are not intended to limit the scope of applicable<br>
methods.<br>
Generally, the reaction conditions such as temperature, reaction time,<br>
solvents., workup procedures, will be those common in the art for the particular<br>
reaction to be performed. The cited reference material, together with material<br>
cited therein, contains detailed descriptions of such conditions. Typically the<br>
temperatures will be -10Q°C to 200*C, solvents will be aprotic or protic, and<br>
reaction times will be 1.0 seconds to 10 days. Workup typically consists of<br>
quenching any unreacted reagents followed by partition between a water/organic<br>
layer system (extraction) and separating the layer containing the product.<br>
Oxidation and reduction reactions are typically carried out at temperatures<br>
near room temperature (about 20'C), although for metal hydride reductions<br>
frequently the temperature is reduced to 0°C to -100°Q solvents are typically<br>
aprotic for reductions and may be either protic or aprotic for oxidations. Reaction<br>
times are adjusted to achieve desired conversions.<br>
''' Condensation reactions are typically carried out at temperatures near room<br>
temperature, although for non-equilibrating, kinetically controlled condensations<br>
reduced temperatures (0°C to •WC) are also coenmon. Solvents can be either<br>
protic (common in equilibrating reactions) or aprotic (common in kinetically<br>
controlled reactions).<br>
Standard synthetic techniques such as azeotropic removal of reaction byproducts<br>
and use of anhydrous reaction conditions (e.g. inert gas environments)<br>
are common in the art and will be applied when applicable.<br>
General aspej5fjth£Sje_ex!amplary methods are described below.,_.£a.cii3f<br>
the products of the following processes is optionally separated, isolated, and/or<br>
purified prior to its. use in subsecquent processes.<br>
The terms "treated", "treating", "treatment", mean contacting, mixing,<br>
reacting, allowing to react, bringing into contact, and other terms common in the<br>
art for Indicating that one or more chemical entities' is treated in<br>
&amp;4:<br>
such a manner as to convert it to one or more other chemical entities. This means<br>
igiat "treating compound one with compound two" is synonymous with "allowing<br>
compound one to react with compound two", "contacting compound one with<br>
compound two", "reacting compound one with compound two", and other<br>
expressions common in the art of organic synthesis for reasonably indicating that<br>
compound one was "treated", "reacted", "allowed to react", with compound two.<br>
"Treating" indicates the reasonable and usual manner in which organic<br>
chemicals are allowed to react. Normal concentrations (Q.01M to 10M, typically<br>
0.1M to 1M), temperatures (-100°C to 250°C, typically -78PC to 150°C, more<br>
typically -78°C to 10Q°C, still more typically 0°C to 100°Q, reaction vessels<br>
(typically glass, plastic, metal), solvents, pressures, atmospheres (typically air for<br>
oxygen and water insensitive reactions or nitrogen or argon for oxygen or water<br>
sensitive), are intended unless otherwise indicated. The knowledge of similar<br>
reactions known in the art of organic synthesis is used in selecting the conditions<br>
and apparatus for "treating" in a given process. In particular, one of ordinary skill<br>
in the art of organic sysnthesis selects conditions and apparatus reasonably<br>
expected to successfully carry out the chemical reactions of the described<br>
processes based on the knowledge in the art.<br>
Modification of the exemplified schemes and examples leads to various<br>
analogs of the specific exemplary materials produced above. The above citations<br>
describing suitable methods of organic synthesis are applicable to such<br>
modifications.<br>
In the exemplary schemes it may be advantageous to separate reaction<br>
products from one another and/or from starting materials. The desired products<br>
of each step or series of iteps is separated and/or purified (hereinafter separated)<br>
to the. deskfid_degr.e&amp;.of homogeneity by the techmqTjes_coriQriirL.the. art,<br>
Typically such separations involve multiphase extraction, crystallization from a<br>
solvent or solvent mixture, distillation, sublimation, or chromatography.<br>
Gxrornatography can involve any number of methods including, for example, size<br>
exclusion or ion exchange chromatography, high, medium, or low pressure liquid<br><br>
qhromatography, small scale and preparative thin or thick layer<br>
chromatography, as well as techniques of small scale thin layer and flash<br>
chromatography. Such separations are desireable if addition reactions place<br>
subsrituents at both of the pyrimidine nitrogen atoms. Separation of these<br>
isomers is well within the skill of the artisan.<br>
Another class of separation methods involves treatment of a mixture with a<br>
reagent selected to bind to or render otherwise separable a desired product,<br>
unreacted starting material, reaction by product, or the like. Such reagents<br>
include adsorbents or absorbents such as activated carbon, molecular sieves, ion<br>
exchange media, or the like. Alternatively, the reagents can be adds in the case of<br>
a basic material, bases in the case of an. acidic material, binding reagents such as<br>
antibodies, binding proteins, selective chelators such as crown ethers,<br>
liquid/liquid ion extraction reagents (UX), or the like.<br>
Selection of appropriate meichods of separation depends on the nature of<br>
the materials involved. For example, boiling point, and molecular weight in<br>
distillation and sublimation, presence or absence of polar functional groups in<br>
chromatography, stability of materials in acidic and basic media in multiphase<br>
extraction. One skilled Jn the art will apply techniques most likely to achieve the<br>
desired Separation.<br>
A synthetic route to 5-beTizyl-2-phenyl-5H-imidazo[4,5"d]pyrirnidin.e arid<br>
Analogous compounds may be synthesized in the same fashion as in the<br>
foregoing schemes by varying the starting materials, intermediates, solvents and<br>
conditions as will be known by those skilled in the art.<br>
An additional method for making the compounds of this invention<br>
involves reacting a (substituted) 3,4-diaminopyrimidine (A) with B (Y-R1) to give<br>
imidazo[4,5-d]pyrimidines (C); introducing further substituents (R2, R4 and/or R5<br>
H) either a) by cylization of an appropriately substituted 3,4-<br>
diaminopyrimidine (A) or b)) by introduction of the substituent(s) onto the<br>
imidazo[4,5-d]pyrimidine (C); reacting the imidazo[4,5-c]pyrimidine (C) with an<br>
alkylating agent (D) (R3-X-R6) in an appropriate solvent under addition of a base<br>
at ambient temperature; and optionally, in the case of hydroxy, mercapto or<br>
amino substituents in position 4 or 6 of the imidazopyrimidine (Z = O, S or NR);<br>
introducing a further substituent (R25 or R26) at position 1 or 3 of the imidazo[4,5-<br>
djpyrimidine.<br>
Compounds of the invention also are conveniently prepared by a two step<br>
^process. First, a (substituted) 3,4-diammopyrimidine (A) is reacted with B to give<br>
imidaza[4,5-d3pyrimidines C (Scheme 1). If Y is COOH, then the cydization is<br>
carried out under acidic catalysis (preferably in polyphosphoric acid at a<br>
temperature between 90 and 200°C); other methods include reaction in 4N<br>
hydrochloric acid at reflux temperature or neat at a temperature between 90 and<br>
180°C (for aliphatic carboxylic acids). In the case of acid-sensitive groups like<br>
aBcoxy or thiophene, the reaction can be carried out in phosphorus oxychloride at<br>
a temperature between 70 and 120*0. Alternatively, reaction with aldehydes (Y =<br>
CHO) or their bisulfite adducts under oxldative conditions (nitrobenzene, DDQ,<br>
copper(H)a.cetate, Oy sulfur) gives umdazo[4,5-d]pyrimidirves C. Other metivods<br>
are the reaction of (substituted) 3,4-diarninopyrimidines (A) with orthoesters (Y =<br>
C(OR),), anhydrides (Y = OCOOR.) or acid halogenides (Y = COX).<br>
Further methods for the preparation of the compounds of the invention are<br>
set forth in Schemes 1-5 below.<br>
The imidazo[4,5-d]pyrtoudines C are present in four tautomeric forms (1H, 3H,<br>
4H,6H)<br>
Substituents, for example R3 and R*, are introduced by two ways: i) by<br>
cyEzation of an appropiately substituted 3,4-diaminopyrimidine or ii) by<br>
introduction of the substituent(s) onto the imidazo[4,5-d]pyrimidine. Nitroamino<br>
pyrimidines are commercially available. Reduction of the nitro group with iron in<br>
a mixture of concentrated hydrochloric acid and ethanol gives the desired<br>
substituted 3,4-diaminopyrimidine starting materials.<br>
Scheme 2:<br>
This reaction gives mixtures of four alkylation products. For example,<br>
reaction of imidazo[4,5-d]pyrimidine C (R1 = 2,6-difluorophenyl, R2 = R4= H) with<br>
2,6-difluorobenzyl bromide would be expected to give the following mixture.<br>
This mixture can be separated by column chromatography (silica gel,<br>
eluenfc mixture of dichloromethane and methanol). The structures of the isolated<br>
components can then be assigned by NMR spectroseopy by single crystal x-ray<br>
analysis. .<br>
Alternatively, the crude reaction mixture can be recrystallized from an<br>
appropiate solvent (mixture), e.g. from a mixture of diisopropyl ether and ethyl<br>
acetate, to give the pure alkylated products.<br>
Compounds of general structure E, F, G ajad H can be prepared by<br>
alkylation (for example with (cyclo)alkylbromide or (cyclo)alkyliodide) of the<br>
corresponding compounds where 2=Q, Z=S or Z=KTR or their isomers. TTn.<br>
resulting mixtures can be separated by column chromatography. The required<br>
starting materials are, for example, prepared from the corresponding chloroanalogues<br>
by nuckophilic substitution, or by ether cleavage of the corresponding<br>
ajkoxy analogues.<br>
A mixture of 4,5-diaminopyrimidine (0.500 g), 2-fluorobenzoic acid (0.700 g) and<br>
polyphosphoric acid (25 mL) was heated at 180°C for 3 hours. Then the reaction<br>
mixture was cooled and poured into water (500 mL). The solution was adjusted<br>
to pH = 8-9 by addition of solid NaOH and the resulting precipitate was collected<br>
by filtration, washed with water and dried to give 8-(2-fluorophenyl)-purine (offwhite<br>

Determination of cvtostatic effect on MDBK cells<br>
The effect of the drugs on exponentially growing MDBK cells was assessed<br>
as follows. Cells were seeded at a density of 5000 cell/well in 96 well plates in<br>
MEM medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2mM Lglutamine<br>
(Life Technologies) and bicarbonate (Life Technologies). Cells were<br>
cultured for 24 hr after which serial dilutions of the test compounds were added.<br>
Cultures were then again further incubated for 3 days after which the effect on<br>
cell growth was quantified by means of the MTS method (Promega). The<br>
concentration that results in 50% inhibition of cell growth is defined as the 50 %<br>

calf serum, 2mM L-glutamine (Life Technologies), Ix non-essential amino acids<br>
(Life Technologies); 100 HJ/ml penicillin and 100 ug/ml streptomycin and 250<br>
ug/ml G418 (Geneticin, Life Technologies). Cells were seeded at a densitiy of<br>
7000 cells per well in 96 well View Plate™ (Packard) in medium containing the<br>
same components as described above, except for G418. Cells were allowed to<br>
adhere and proliferate for 24 hr. At that time, culture medium was removed and<br>
serial dilutions of the test compounds were added in culture medium lacking<br>
G418. Interferon alfa 2a (500IU) was included as a positive control. Plates were<br>
further incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 72 hours. Replication of the HCV<br>
replicon in Huh-5 cells results in luciferase activity in the cells. Luciferase activity<br>
is measured by adding 50 ul of 1 x Glo-lysis buffer (Promega) for 15 minutes<br>
followed by 50 ul of the Steady-Glo Luciferase assay reagent (Promega).<br>
Luciferase activity is measured with a luminometer and the signal in each<br>
individual well is expressed as a percentage of the untreated cultures. Parallel<br>
cultures of Huh-5-2 cells, seeded at a density of 7000 cells/ well of classical 96-<br>
well eel culture plates (Becton-Dickinson) are treated in a similar fashion except<br>
that no Glo-lysis buffer or Steady-Glo Luciferase reagent is added. Instead the<br>
density of the culture is measured by means of the MTS method (Promega).<br>

performed at 60°C for 30 minutes, followed by inactivation of uraciJ-Nglycosylase<br>
at 95°C for 5 minutes. Subsequent PCR amplification consisted of 40<br>
cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 20 seconds and annealing and extension at 62°C<br>
for 1 minute in an ABI7700 sequence detector. For each PCR run, negative<br>
template and positive template samples were used. The cycle threshold value (Ctvalue)<br>
is defined as the number of PCR cycles for which the signal exceeds the<br>
baseline, which defines a positive value. The sample was considered to be positive<br>
if the Ct-value was 50. Results are expressed as genomic equivalents (GE).<br>
