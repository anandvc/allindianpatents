The present invention relates to silicon-containing biostable chemical gels and processes for their 5  preparation.  The gels possess properties which make them useful in the manufacture and repair of biomaterials and medical devices, articles or implants, in particular the manufacture of soft tissue implants such as breast implants and the repair of orthopaedic joints such as 10  spinal discs.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Polymer gels are semi-solid systems that respond in a liquid like fashion under certain circumstances but their<br>
15  molecules do not have motion that is independent of each other, hence they behave like solids in other circumstances.<br>
Gels can be synthesised as physical gels where a cross-linked network is swelled by a non reactive liquid.<br>
20  Without the presence of this swelling medium the cross-<br>
linked network would be a solid.  Silicone gels currently used in breast implants are physical gels where a cross-linked polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) system is swollen by a non reactive, low molecular weight PDMS.  These gels are<br>
25  inherently prone to leakage of the low molecular weight<br>
liquid PDMS and contain heavy metal catalysts such as platinum and tin which can leach out of the implant in an in-vivo situation.<br>
Hydrogels are other examples of physical gels, where 30  hydrophilic groups in the cross-linked network can attract water molecules and are swollen by them.  In a physical gel the parts by weight of the swelling medium can be as high as 90%.  This swelling medium can be extracted out of the gel by most solvents and biological fluids.<br>
35       There is a need for a gel that mimics the behaviour<br>
of a PDMS-based physical gel, but is chemically formulated so as to avoid the complications of a physical gel.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The gel of the present invention which comprises at least one silicon containing biostable polymer is a<br>
20  chemical gel.  When a cross-linked network is formulated such that the reactive groups are in a perfect balance then, during the course of the reaction, the network begins to vitrify and ends up being a hard solid.  If the reaction is not allowed to go to completion by creating an<br>
25  imbalance in the reactive groups, then an off-<br>
stoichiometric system occurs which is capable of gelation. Thus, one reactive group is in excess and remains incompletely reacted.  This excess amount acts similar to the non-reactive swelling medium in physical gels.<br>
30  However, usually lower amounts of unreacted material, in comparison to the swelling agents, can be formulated to achieve a similar effect to a physical gel and that, in turn, implies lower extractable species.  The level of extractables in the gel of the present invention is<br>
35  preferably less than 35%, more preferably less than 30%,<br>
most preferably less than 21% based on the total weight of the gel.<br><br>

PHYSICAL PROPERTY TESTS<br>
Biological Stability:  The biological stability of the 30  gels is achieved by the incorporation of large amount of silicon.<br>
Rheology:  Both the natural feel and the form stability can be related to rheological factors.  A good creep-<br>
35  recovery performance describes the feel or the elasticity.<br>
The parameters of storage modulus (G') and loss modulus (G") as measured in frequency sweep measurement on a<br><br>

-   20   -<br>
rheometer describe the form stability.  G'&gt;G" at low frequencies (0.01s-1 to 1s-1) implies form stability.<br>
Procedure for Creep Recovery &amp; Frequency Sweep Analysis<br>
5      The Creep Recovery is tested using Haake RheoStress 1 Rheometer. After the initialisation process under compressed air atmosphere, the parallel plates are subjected to zero point measurement.  The sample is loaded and the gap position set. The excess sample is trimmed and<br>
10  is ready for the experiment.<br>
The creep recovery analysis is carried out at 37°C. The sample is thermostated for 300s before the actual experiment starts to ensure temperature equilibrium. The experiment is carried at a force of 10 Pa for a duration<br>
15  of 60s and from the plot of J (l/Pa, compliance) Vs t(s), the creep recovery results can be obtained.<br>
For frequency sweep measurement, after trimming the sample, the experiment was conducted at 37°C, with similar temperature equilibrating conditions. It is carried out in<br>
20  the frequency range of 0.01 Hz to 10 Hz. The frequency sweep provides about the structural conditions of the sample. It is possible to distinguish between a particle solution, an entangled solution (paste) and a three dimensional network (gel) simply by the shape of G', G'<br>
25  (Pa) and n* (Pa s) Vs f (Hz) curves.<br>
Extractables:  The extractables in hexane as measured in the Soxhlet extraction technique over 24 hours shows an average value of around 50% for the silicone gels. 30<br>
Extraction procedure<br>
The extraction procedure involved five pieces of apparatus:  condenser, soxhlet extractor tube, extraction thimble, 250 mL round-bottom flask and a heating mantle. 3 5  The procedure was carried out as follow:<br>
• Accurately weighed the 250mL round bottom (R.B.) flask.<br><br>
WO 2006/034547	PCT/AU2005/001491<br>
-   21   -<br>
•	Poured approximately 160mL of Hexane into the R.B.<br>
flask<br>
•	Placed a known amount of gel sample into the thimble<br>
and the thimble was placed in the soxhlet extractor<br>
5       tube.<br>
•	The R.B. flask was adapted to the lower end of the<br>
soxhlet extractor tube and the condenser was adapted<br>
the top end of the tube.<br>
•	The gel sample was allowed to reflux in Hexane for 22<br>
10      hours.<br>
•	At the end of the extraction period, the extractables<br>
in Hexane were collected in the R.B. flask.<br>
•	Hexane was removed using rotary evaporator.<br>
•	The R.B. flask containing the extractable residue was<br>
15       accurately weighed<br>
•	The amount of extractable residue was calculated<br>
from the weight of the gel used for extraction.<br>
•	The results were, report as % weight loss.<br>
20  Basic Strategy<br>
The approaches used in the formulation of gels involve initiation of cross-linking by the use of various functionalities of the reactants including unsaturated or double bonds in the PDMS molecule and then making the 25  double bond reactive by using a ultraviolet light source or other techniques.<br>
Reactants used for Gel Synthesis<br>
The reactants used for synthesising the gels include 30  a di-isocyanate in the form of MDI and different hydroxyl terminated polyols of functionalities varying from 1 to 4. The reactants are set out in Table 1 below:<br>

25.22g of 1, 3, 5, 7-tetramethylcyclotetrasiloxane, and 400. OOg of of a, co-bis (hydroxyethoxypropyl) polydimethylsiloxane (MW 954) were mixed in a glass bottle containing a magnetic stirrer bar. 1.96g of<br>
10  trifluoromethanesulfonic acid was added to the mixture and the bottle sealed with an air tight cap. The mixture was stirred vigorously for 3.5 hours at room temperature after which 20g of sodium carbonate was added. The bottle was resealed and stirred for over night, after which the<br>
15  sodium carbonate was filtered off to give 417.78g of hydroxyethoxypropyl terminated (methylhydrosiloxane) (dimethyl siloxane) copolymer intermediate.<br>
In a three-neck 3L round bottomed flask equipped with a water cooled condensed equipped with a silica gel drying<br>
20  tube, a 250-mL pressure compensating dropping funnel, and a thermometer were placed 417.78g of hydroxyethoxypropyl terminated (methylhydrosiloxane)(dimethyl siloxane) copolymer intermediate given above and 3 00mL of dry toluene. The mixture was heated, whilst stirring, to 60°C.<br>
25  0.6mL of a toluene solution of Karstedt's catalyst<br>
(containing 66.04 x 10-6 moles Pt/mL) was added to the mixture. 70.48g of allylmethacrylate was added drop wise to the mixture from the dropping funnel. The addition was made over a 20 minute period during which time the<br>
30  temperature of the mixture rose to 72°C after which the reaction mixture was maintained at 70 °C for 18 hour. Silanic hydrogen content was checked by infrared spectroscopy. When no trace was detectable the reaction was considered to be complete. The reaction mixture was<br>
35  allowed to cool to room temperature and treated with 20g of activated carbon for 18 hours whilst stirring. The reaction mixture was filtered through celite to remove the<br><br>

carbon followed by filtration through a 0.2pm Teflon filter. 0.094g of MEHQ was added to the toluene solution and then the toluene was removed by rotary evaporator at 60°C under a reduced pressure of 20 torr. The mixture was 5  transferred to a kugelrohr distillation apparatus and stripped of low molecular weight species at 50°C under a reduced of 1 x 10-1 torr for 20 minutes, this process was repeated 3 times to give 403.70g of hydroxyethoxypropyl terminated 3.55%-(methylmethacryloxypropyl methyl 10  siloxane)(dimethyl siloxane) copolymer (Ie) as a pale yellow oil (x=9.56,y=0.352, MW 1039).<br>

Gel Synthesis<br>
The gels were synthesised using different processes: One Shot Process - All reactants of the gel were added and mixed together. 5  Two Stage Process - The gel synthesis in this process<br>
occurred with the formation of a di-functional isocyanate terminated pre-polymer in the first stage followed by the addition of the hydroxyl terminated multifunctional polyols.<br>
10  Slow Addition Process - All the reactants of the gel were mixed in together but the polyols are added to the diisocycanate in a drop wise fashion.<br>
Sequenced Slow Addition - This is similar to the slow addition process except that certain polyol<br>
15  functionalities are added before the others.<br>
UV Curing - For the process of curing with ultra-violet light, a formulation containing an unsaturation in the polyol segment was prepared. A photoinitiator was added to the mixture and this in the presence of an externally<br>
20  supplied, long wavelength, ultraviolet radiation resulted in the formation of a cross linked gel.<br>
EXAMPLE 1: ONE SHOT PROCESS<br>
4, 4'-Diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI) was<br>
25  accurately weighed in a paper cup. In a Schott bottle, a mixture of polyol adduct viz. polyethylene monoalcohol, polydimethylsiloxane (Mw 1000 &amp; 2000), voranol-2070 and N,N,N'-tri(2-hydroxypropyl)-N'-hydroxyethylethylenediamine (Poly Q 40-8 00) was added to the MDI in bulk and stirred 30  for 4 minutes and placed in the oven at 70°C overnight to cure.<br>

EXAMPLE 2: TWO STAGE PROCESS<br>
The gels were prepared in two steps; preparation of prepolymer with difunctional polyols to get desired NCO index (NCO/OH) followed by reaction of pre-polymer with 10  multifunctional polyols to get desired stoichiometric imbalance "r".<br>
The ratio of the reactants "r" can be compared to the stoichiometry NCO to OH group:<br>
r = Σ f. nAf/ Σ g. nBg 15<br><br>

Preparation of Prepolymer<br>
The PDMS (MW 2000) was degassed at 70°C under vacuum<br>
10  prior to synthesis. Molten MDI was placed in a three necked round bottom flask which was fitted with a mechanical stirrer and nitrogen inlet. The flask was placed in an oil bath set at 70°C. The degassed PDMS was added to MDI and was stirred by mechanical stirrer under a<br>
15  nitrogen atmosphere for 2 hours.<br>
After completion the addition of PDMS, the temperature of the oil bath was increased to 80°C. The prepolymer stirred at 100 rpm under nitrogen atmosphere for 2 h. The prepolymer was degassed for 1 hour under<br>
20  vacuum.  Prepolymers with 2% and 4% free NCO contents were made.  The free NCO% is based on the ratio of excess NCO functional group by the amount of prepolymer in weight percentage. The excess NCO functional group is determined by the amount of excess MDI which contains 33.6% by weight<br>
25  NCO group. The excess MDI is the amount which remains after reaction with hydroxyl terminated PDMS.<br>
Reaction with multifunctional polyol<br>
A mixture of polyol adducts viz. 1, 4-butanediol<br>
30  (BDO)/bis-hydroxy butyl tetramethyldisiloxane (BHTD), voranol-2070 and N, N, N'-tri (2-hydroxypropyl)-N'-hydroxyethylethylenediamine (Poly Q 40-800) stirring at 70°C.  The adduct was then added to the prepolymer and allowed to mix using a high shear mechanical stirrer for 4<br>
35  minutes at 5000rpm. The polymer was transferred into the oven and allowed to cure in a nitrogen blanketed oven overnight at 70°C.<br><br>

EXAMPLE 5: UV CURING<br>
UV-curing systems rely upon externally-supplied, long wavelength, ultraviolet radiation to produce free radicals within the material. UV light does not usually have<br>
20  sufficient energy levels to interact with the reactive<br>
groups of the molecules and generate free radicals. When a photoinitiator is added to the formulation, which when exposed to UV of a specific wavelength, absorbs the UV light and produces free radicals which start the cross<br>
25  linking process and results in virtually instant<br>
polymerisation. In the free radical formulation the reaction will only continue as long as the formulation is subjected to the UV light.<br>

15<br>
Purpose<br>
To evaluate the biocompatibility of a test article<br>
extract using an in vitro mammalian cell culture test.<br>
This study is based on the requirements of the 20  International Organization for Standardization 10993;<br>
Biological Evaluation of Medical Devices, Part 5: Tests<br>
for Cytotoxicity: in vitro Methods.<br>
Ratio of Test Material to Extraction Vehicle: 25      Material thickness less than 0.5 mm - ratio of 60 cm2:10 ml (based on the USP ratio 120 cm2-.20 ml)<br>
Extraction Vehicles:<br>
Single strength Minimum Essential Medium supplemented 30  with 5% serum and 2% antibiotics (IX MEM)<br><br>
WO 2006/034547	PCT/AU2005/001491<br>
-  45   -<br>
Extraction Conditions:<br>
The extraction conditions shall attempt to exaggerate the clinical use conditions so as to define the potential toxicological hazard; however, they should not in any 5  instance cause physical changes such as fusion or melting, which results in a decrease in the available surface area. A slight adherence of the pieces can be tolerated.<br>
Control Articles:<br>
10      Negative Control: high density polyethylene, will be prepared based on a ratio of 60 cm2:20 ml extraction vehicle. A single preparation of the material will be made, and will be extracted using the same conditions as described for the test article.<br>
15 Reagent Control: A single aliquot of the extraction vehicle without test material will be prepared using the same conditions as described for the test article.<br>
Positive Control: Current positive control material*, tin stabilized at polyvinylchoride, will be prepared based<br>
20  on a ratio of 60 cm2:20 ml extraction vehicle. A single<br>
preparation of the material will be made and extracted at 37°C for.24 hours. Serial dilutions will be prepared for an end-point titration procedure.<br>
25 *NOTE: The current positive control material has been qualified as an acceptable replacement for the USP recommended control material.<br>
Test System and Justification:<br>
30      Mammalian cell culture monolayer, L-929, mouse<br>
fibroblast cells, (ATCC CCL 1, NCTC Clone 929, of strain L, or equivalent source), will be used. In vitro mammalian cell culture studies have been used historically to evaluate cytotoxicity of biomaterials and medical devices<br>
35  (Wilsnack, et al., 1973).<br><br>
WO 2006/034547	PCT/AU2005/001491<br>
-   46   -<br>
Test System Management:<br>
L-929, mouse fibroblast cells, (ATCC CCL 1, NCTC Clone 929, of strain L, or equivalent source) will be propagated and maintained in open wells containing single 5  strength Minimum Essential Medium supplemented with 5%<br>
serum and 2% antibiotics (lx MEM) in a gaseous environment of 5% carbon dioxide (CO2) . For this study, 10 cm2 wells will be seeded, labeled with passage number and date, and incubated at 37°C in 5% CO to obtain confluent monolayers 10  of cells prior to use. Aseptic procedures will be used in the handling of the cell cultures following approved Standard Operating Procedures.<br>
Methods and Route of Administration: 15       Each culture well will be selected which contains a<br>
confluent cell monolayer. The growth medium in triplicate<br>
cultures will be replaced with 2 ml of the test extract.<br>
Similarly, triplicate cultures will be replaced with 2 ml<br>
of the reagent control, negative control extract and the 20  undiluted and each titer of the positive control. Each<br>
well will be incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 48 hours.<br>
Following incubation, the cultures will be examined<br>
microscopically (100X) to evaluate cellular<br>
characteristics and percent lysis. 25<br>
Evaluation Criteria and Statistics:<br>
The confluency of the monolayer will be recorded as<br>
(+) if present and (-) if absent. In addition, the color<br>
of the test medium will be observed and compared to the 30  negative control medium. Each culture well will be<br>
evaluated for percent lysis and cellular characteristics<br>
using the following criteria:<br>
35<br><br>
WO 2006/034547<br><br>
PCT/AU2005/001491<br><br>
-   47   -<br><br>
Grade	Reactivity	Observations<br>
0	None	Discrete intracytoplasmic granules	No lysis<br>
1	Slight	Not more than 20% of the cells are round, loosely attached, and without intracytoplasmic granules	Not more than 20% lysis<br>
2	Mild	Not more than 50% of the cells are round and devoid of intracytoplasmic granules	Not more than 50% lysis.<br>
3	Moderate	Not more than 70% of the cell monolayer contains rounded cells	Not more than 70% lysis<br>
4	Severe	Nearly complete destruction of the cell monolayer	Greater than 70% lysis<br>
For the test to be valid, the reagent control and the negative control must have a reactivity of none (grade 0) 5  and the positive control must be a grade 3 or 4. The test sample meets the requirements of the test if the biological response is less than or equal to grade 2 (mild). The test will be repeated if the controls do not perform as anticipated and/or if all three test wells do 10  not yield the same conclusion.<br>

Age:	Young adults<br>
15  Acclimation Period:	Minimum 5 days<br>
Number of Animals:	15 (per extract)<br>
Identification Method:	Ear punch<br>
Justification of Test System:<br>
20       The Hartley albino guinea pig has been used<br>
historically for sensitization studies (Magnusson and Kilgman, 1970). The guinea pig is believed to be the most sensitive animal model for this type of study. The susceptibility of the Hartley strain to a known<br>
25  sensitizing agent, l-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DNCB) has been substantiated with this method.<br>
Test and Control Article Preparation:<br>
Fresh extracts will be prepared at each phase of the<br>
30  study as previously indicated (see Test Article). If the test material is suitable for patching, a topical application of the test sample (2 cm x 2 cm patch) will be used at the challenge. The vehicle used to prepare the extract will be prepared in the same manner as the extract<br>
35  (but without test article) to serve as the control measure.<br><br>
WO 2006/034547	PCT/AU2005/001491<br>
-   50   -<br>
Methods and Route of Administration:<br>
The day prior to treatment, 15 guinea pigs per extract (10 test, 5 control) will be weighed and identified. The fur from the dorsoscapular area of the 5  animals will be removed with an electric clipper.<br>
Induction I:<br>
Three pair of intradermal injections will be administered to the animals within an approximate 2 cm x 4 10  cm area the dorsoscapular region as follows:<br>
Control Animals:<br>
a.	0.1 ml of 50:50 (v/v) mixture of Freund's Complete<br>
Adjuvant (FCA) and the chosen vehicle<br>
15  b.   0.1 ml of vehicle<br>
c.   0.1 ml of a 1:1 mixture of the 50:50 (v/v) FCA and the vehicle<br>
Test Animals:<br>
20  a.   0.1 ml of 50:50 (v/v) mixture of FCA and the chosen vehicle<br>
b.	0.1 ml of test extract<br>
c.	0.1 ml of a 1:1 mixture of the 50:50 (v/v) FCA and<br>
the test extract<br>
25<br>
To minimize tissue sloughing the 'a" and "c' injections will be slightly deeper than "b'. Site 'c" will be injected slightly more caudal than site 'b".<br>
30  Induction II:<br>
Six days later, the injection sites will be clipped free of fur again and treated with 0.5 to 1 g of a 10% (w/w) sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) suspension prepared by mixing the powdered SLS with petrolatum. The day following<br>
35  the SLS treatment, any remaining SLS residue will be gently wiped from the area with gauze.<br><br>
WO 2006/034547	PCT/AU2005/001491<br>
-   51   -<br>
A 2 cm x 4 cm filter paper patch (3MM, Whatman), saturated with 0.3 ml of the extract preparation or vehicle, will be applied over the same injection area and secured with a nonreactive tape. The trunk of each animal 5  will then be wrapped snugly with an elastic band for 4 8 hours (±2 hours).<br>
Challenge:<br>
At 13 days after unwrapping induction II wraps, the<br>
10  fur will be clipped from the sides and flanks of all<br>
guinea pigs. On the following day, a nonwoven cotton disk backed by a flexible chamber (e.g. Hill Top Chamber®) and semiocclusive hypoallergenic tape, will be saturated with 0.3 ml of freshly prepared test material extract and<br>
15  applied to the right flank or dorsum of each animal. In<br>
addition, the vehicle control will be patched to the left flank or dorsum of each animal. An approximate 2 cm x 2 cm section of test material itself (if appropriate) will be applied to the right flank.<br>
20       The trunk of each animal will be wrapped for 24 hours (±2 hours). At patch removal the sites will be wiped with gauze. At 24 hours (±2 hours) after patch removal, the challenged sites and surrounding area will be shaved. The sites will be examined for signs of ahy irritation or<br>
25  sensitization reaction, as indicated by erythema and edema at a minimum of 2 hours and a maximum of 4 hours following the shave and at 4 8 (+2 hours) and 72 (+2 hours) hours after removal of the dressings. Prior to scoring, each site will be wiped gently with a 35% isopropyl alcohol<br>
30  gauze sponge.<br>
Should the original challenge results prove to be equivocal, the animals may be rechallenged with a fresh test extract and vehicle control approximately 7 days after the first challenge patch application. The<br>
35  rechallenge will be conducted in the same manner as the<br>
challenge but at virgin sites on the opposite flank. After<br><br>
WO 2006/034547<br><br>
PCT/AU2005/001491<br><br>
-   52   -<br>
the test is completed, all animals will be handled in accordance with approved procedures.<br>
Evaluations and Statistics:<br>
5      Daily challenge scores for reactions will be recorded at 24, 48 and 72 hours after patch removal in accordance with the following Table:<br><br>
ERYTHEMA (ER)	EDEMA (ED)<br>
Reaction	Numerical Grading	Reaction	Numerical Grading<br>
No erythema	0	No edema	0<br>
Slight erythema	I	Slight edema	1<br>
Well-definded erythema	2	Well-defined edema	2<br>
Moderate erythema	3	Moderate edema	3<br>
Severe erythema to slight eschar formulation	4	Severe edema	4<br>
10      Any other observation relating to the site will be footnoted.<br>
The responses will be compared within the test animal group and between test and control conditions. Control conditions are (1) the vehicle control solution on the<br>
15  test animals and (2) the test extract, control solution and biomaterial (if applied) on the control animals.<br>
In the final analysis of data, consideration will be given to the overall pattern, intensity, duration, and character of reactions of the test as compared to the<br>
20  control conditions. Statistical manipulation of data is not applicable to this study. An effect interpreted as "irritation" is generally observed at 24 hours, but diminishes thereafter, and is also concurrently present as a transient response in the control animals. Closed<br>
25  patches typically show maximal sensitization readings 48 to 72 hours after patch removal in the test condition but not in the control condition.  Grades of 1 or greater in the test group generally indicate sensitization, provided<br><br>
WO 2006/034547	PCT/AU2005/001491<br>
-   53   -<br>
that grades of less than 1 are observed on the control animals. If grades of 1 or greater are noted on control animal then the reactions of test animals which exceed the most severe control reaction are considered to be due to 5  sensitization.<br>
Background or artifactual reactions (e.g., from fur clipping, patch chamber edge, nonspecific FCA effects) will not be considered as evidence of a sensitization response. The treatment with FCA and occlusive dressings<br>
10  may lower the threshold level for skin irritation.<br>
If the test group has a greater number of animals showing responses that are not greater than the control animals, a rechallenge may be conducted. The rechallenge will be conducted approximately 7 days after the first<br>
15 challenge at virgin sites on the opposite flank of the animals. Absence of dermal response at rechallenge may nullify earlier findings. Recurring observations in at least one of the same animals verify earlier findings.<br>

10  Justification of Test System:<br>
The intracutaneous injection test in rabbits is specified in the current ISO testing standards and has been used historically to evaluate biomaterial extracts.<br>
15  Methods and Route of Administration:<br>
The day prior to treatment, each rabbit will be weighed and clipped free of fur from the back and both sides of the spinal column to yield a sufficient injection area. The clipped area of the back will be wiped with a<br>
20  70% alcohol soaked gauze pad just before injection and allowed to dry. Due to concern with the crowding and subsequent obscuring of injection sites, the test and control sites will not be cranial and caudal on the same side of the back as defined in the ISO standards. Each<br>
25  test extract will be administered in five intracutaneous injections of 0.2 ml each on the right side of each rabbit's back. Five reagent control injections will be injected similarly on the left side of the back. No more than two test extracts and the corresponding reagent<br>
30  controls will be injected into each animal. Injections<br>
will be about 2 cm apart. The appearance of the injection sites will be noted immediately after injection.<br>
Observations for erythema and edema will be noted for each injection site at 24 (+ 2 hours),48 (±2 hours) and<br>
35  72 (±2 hours) hours after injection. Reactions will be scored on a 0 to 4 basis. Other adverse changes at the injection sites will also be noted. After the test is<br><br>

completed, all animals will be handled in accordance with approved procedures. The reactions will be evaluated according to the subjective rating scale as shown below:<br><br>
ERYTHEMA (ER)	EDEMA (ED)<br>
0	No erythema	0	No edema<br>
1	Very-slight erythema (barely	1	Very-slight edema (barely perceptible)<br>

4	Severe erythema (beet redness) to	4	Severe edema (raised approximately 1 mm,<br>
	eschar formation preventing grading		and extending beyond exposure area)<br>
	of erythema)		<br>
5<br>
Evaluations and Statistics:<br>
No statistical analysis of the data will be performed. For each animal, the erythema and edema scores obtained at each time interval will be added together and<br>
10  divided by the total number of observations. This<br>
calculation will be conducted separately for each test extract and reagent control. The score for the reagent control will be subtracted from the score for the test extract to obtain the Primary Irritation Score. The<br>
15  Primary Irritation Score of each animal will be added<br>
together and divided by the total number of animals. The value obtained is the Primary Irritation Index (PII). The Primary Irritation Index is characterized by number and description as follows: 0-0.4 (negligible), 0.5-1.9<br>
20  (slight), 2.0-4.9 (moderate), 5.0-8.0 (severe). If the response in the initial test is equivocal, additional testing may be necessary. Any adverse reaction noted in the test extract will be compared to the corresponding reagent control.<br>

-   60   -<br>
Mice will be observed for adverse reactions immediately after dosing, and at 4, 24, 48 and 72 hours after injection. Following the 72 hour observation, the animals will be weighed. Any animal found dead will be 5  subjected to a gross necropsy of the viscera. After the test is completed, all animals will be handled in accordance with approved procedures.<br>
Evaluations and Statistics:<br>
10      No statistical analysis of the data will be<br>
performed. If during the observation period none of the mice treated with the test extract show a significantly greater reaction than the corresponding control mice, then the test sample meets the test requirements. If two or<br>
15  more mice die, or if abnormal behavior such as convulsions or prostration occurs in two or more mice, or if body weight loss greater than 2 grams occurs in three or more mice, the test sample does not meet the test requirements. If any mice treated with the test extract show only<br>
20  slight signs of toxicity and not more than one mouse shows gross signs of toxicity or dies, a ten mouse retest may be required. If all ten mice treated with the test extract on the repeat test show no significant reaction greater than the control mice, then the test sample meets the current<br>
25  test requirements.<br>
Report:<br>
The final report will include a description of the methods employed, individual body weights, and any 30  observations.<br>

The extracts will be used within 24 hours of completion of the extraction process or as directed by the 5  sponsor.<br>
Control Article:<br>
A vehicle control (SC without test article) will be prepared in the same way and at the same time as the test 10  extract. A single group of common control animals may be dosed when multiple test articles are evaluated at the same time.<br>
Test System:<br>
15  Species:	Rat (Rat us norvigicus)<br>
Strain:	Hla®:(SD)CVF®<br>
Source:	Hilltop Lab Animals, Inc.<br>
Sex:	Ten male, ten female<br>
Body Weight Range:	No particular weight range<br>
2 0	is prescribed for this<br>
study, however, individual<br>
pretreatment body weights<br>
will be within 20% of the<br>
group mean for each sex<br>
25  Age:	Approximately 6 to 8 weeks<br>
old at first treatment<br>
Acclimation Period:         Minimum 5 days<br>
Number of Animals:	Twenty<br>
Identification Method:       Ear punch or tag 30<br>
Methods and Route of Administration:<br>
No more than one day prior to the first dose, rats will be weighed and randomly assigned to each treatment group. Ten rats (five male, five female) will receive an 35  injection of the test article extract once each day for 14 consecutive days. The test extract will be injected via the lateral tail vein at a dose of 10.0 ml/kg. The<br><br>
WO 2006/034547	PCT/AU2005/001491<br>
-   63   -<br>
individual daily dose will be based on the weight of each animal on the first dose day of each week. The appropriate dose volume will be calculated to the nearest 0.1 ml. An appropriate gauge needle attached to a disposable syringe 5  will be used to deliver the injection. The injection rate will be approximately 1.0 ml/10 seconds. Animals will be dosed at approximately the same time each day. Ten rats (five male, five female) will be similarly injected with the control blank. The first day of dosing will be 10  designated as day 1.<br>
Laboratory Observations:<br>
1.	Animals will be observed daily for general health. Rats<br>
15     will also be observed for any adverse reactions<br>
immediately after injection.<br>
2.	Detailed examinations for clinical signs of disease or<br>
abnormality will be conducted at randomization and on<br>
2	0     days 8 and 15.<br>
3.	Body weights will be recorded to the nearest whole gram<br>
prior to the first dose, on day 8, 14 (pre-fasted<br>
weight) and 15 (fasted weight).<br>
25<br>
4.	In the event of mortality, the following contingencies<br>
will apply:<br>
a. Should any animal die during the study, a<br>
3	0        macroscopic examination of the viscera will be<br>
conducted. Because of rapid postmortem tissue changes in small rodents, no final body weight or blood collection will be attempted. The organs and tissues designated in the Terminal Procedures 35         portion of this protocol will be collected and<br>
fixed for histopathologic evaluation. The number of<br><br>
WO 2006/034547	PCT/AU2005/001491<br>
-   64   -<br>
days the animal was on test will be considered in the final evaluation.<br>
b. Should any animal exhibit adverse clinical signs 5        or suffer from cage injury that for humane reasons necessitates euthanasia, it will be subject to the Terminal Procedures. The number of days the animal was on test will be considered in the final evaluation. 10<br>
Terminal Procedures;<br>
At the end of the workday on day 14, the animals will be weighed and food will be withheld for a maximum of 2 0 hours. On day 15, the animals will be weighed and then 15  anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine<br>
hydrochloride and xylazine (88 mg/kg + 12 mg/kg) dosed at 3.0 ml/kg. The abdomen will be opened and a blood specimen will be collected from the posterior vena cava. The blood specimens will be forwarded to a contract laboratory for 20  complete blood cell count with differential and clinical chemistry analyses. Rats will be euthanized by exsanguination while anesthetized.<br>
Following exsanguination, a macroscopic observation of the viscera will be conducted. The following organs 25  will be removed: heart, lungs, liver, spleen, thymus,<br>
kidneys (2) , adrenal glands (2), mesenteric lymph nodes, submandibular lymph nodes, gonads (2) and any tissue with visible gross lesions. The liver, spleen, thyrnus, kidneys, adrenal glands and gonads will be weighed. Paired 30  organs will be weighed together. The tissues will be<br>
preserved in 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF) until further processing. The carcasses will be discarded.<br>
After fixation, the tissues will be histologically processed (embedded, sectioned and stained in hematoxylin 35  and eosin) for microscopic evaluation by a qualified pathologist.<br><br>
WO 2006/034547	PCT/AU2005/001491<br>
-   65   -<br>
Evaluation and Statistics:<br>
Body weight data, organ weight data, organ/body weight ratios, hematology and clinical chemistry data will be evaluated statistically. Pre-fasted body weights will 5  be used to determine weight gain and the fasted body weights will be used to determine anesthetic dosages at termination and organ/body weight ratios. Descriptive statistics and group comparisons of data will be accomplished using a validated statistical software<br>
10  package. After screening the data for normality and equal variance, the appropriate parametric or nonparametric tests will be performed. Normally distributed data with equal variance will be considered parametric and evaluated using an 'unpaired t-test" for comparison of two groups.<br>
15  Jf data is nonparametric, the "Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test" is used for two group comparisons. The data to be analyzed will include: body weight, organ weight and hematological parameters. The treatment groups will be used as variables. Calculations resulting in probability (p)<br>
20  values less than 0,05 will be considered statistically significant. If directed by the evaluating pathologist, statistical evaluation of pathologic findings may be conducted.<br>
Clinical signs of systemic illness or death will not<br>
25  be analyzed statistically unless a rationale (such as frequently observed clinical signs or emergence of a pattern) for such analysis is apparent from these data. If the incidence of occurrence of any one or more observations is sufficient to warrant analysis, a<br>
30  chisquare test will be employed.<br>
Data from male and female rats for body weights will be analyzed separately until and unless a rationale exists for combining the sexes. Body weight data will be expressed as absolute values. Data from male and female<br>
35  rats for hematology parameters will be analyzed separately unless a rationale exists for combining the sexes. In the event of statistical significance for any hematologic<br><br>
WO 2006/034547	PCT/AU2005/001491<br>
-   66   -<br>
parameter, the results will be compared to a reference range to aid in determining biological significance.<br>
Report:<br>
5      The final report will include a description of the methods employed, clinical observations, body weight data, hematology and clinical chemistry data, organ weight data, organ/body weight ratios, necropsy findings, the microscopic evaluation in the histopathology report, the 10  statistical analyses and conclusions.<br>

All preparations of soluble materials will be performed the day of test. In the event the material does 10  not completely dissolve at these concentrations, serial dilutions will be prepared. The highest possible concentration that achieves complete dissolution of the material will be used for testing purposes.<br>
15  Test System:<br>
Each S. typhimurium tester strain contains a specific mutation in the histidine operon and other mutations that increase their ability to detect mutagens. The E. coli strain contains a mutation in the tryptophan operon and a<br>
20  deletion in the uvrA gene. These genetically altered S.<br>
typhimurium strains (TA9S, TA100, TA1535, and TA1537) and E. coli strain (WP2uvrA) cannot grow in the absence of histidine or tryptophan, respectively. When placed in a histidine-free (for S. typhimurium) or tryptophan.-free<br>
2	5  (for E coli) medium, only those cells which mutate<br>
spontaneously back to their wild type state (histidine independent by manufacturing their own histidine, or tryptophan independent by manufacturing their own. iryptophan) are able to form colonies. The spontaneous<br>
3	0  mutation rate (or reversion rate) for any one strain is<br>
relatively constant, but if a mutagen is added to the test system, the mutation rate is significantly increased.<br>

20  Metabolic Activation:<br>
Aroclor 1254 - induced rat liver (s9 homogenate) will be used as metabolic activation. The material is prepared from male, Sprague Dawley rats. The rats are induced with one intraperitoneal injection of Aroclor 1254 (500 mg/ml)<br>
25  5 days prior to sacrifice. The S9 homogenate is purchased from Organon Teknika Corporation, Box 15969, Durham, NC 27704-0969. Just prior to use, the S9 homogenate will be mixed with a buffer containing 0.4 M MgCl2/65 M KC1, 1.0 M Glucose-6-phosphate, 0.1 M NADP, 0.2 M sodium phosphate<br>
30  buffer and sterile water.<br>
Preparation of Tester Strains:<br>
Cultures of Salmonella typhimurium, TA98, TA10 0, TA1535 and TA1537, and Escherichia coli, WP2uvrA, will be 35  inoculated to individual Erlenmeyer flasks containing oxoid broth. The inoculated broth cultures will be<br><br>
WO 2006/034547	PCT/AU2005/001491<br>
-   71   -<br>
incubated at 37 ± 2°C in an incubator shaker operating at 115-125 rpm for 10-12 hours.<br>
Preparation of Negative Control:<br>
5      Negative control (vehicle without test material) will be utilized for each tester strain with and without S9 activation.<br>
Preparation of Positive Controls:<br>
10      A known mutagen, Dexon (paradimethylaminobenzene diazosulfonic acid sodium salt), will be used as a positive control to demonstrate that tester strains TA98, TA100, and TA1537 are sensitive to mutation to the wild type state. Por tester strain TA 1535, sodium azide will<br>
15  be used as a positive control. For tester strain TA100, 2-aminofluorene will be used as a positive control. For tester strain WP2uvrA, 2-aminoanthracene and methylmethane-sulfonate will be used as positive controls. Although metabolic activation is only required with 2-<br>
20  aminofluorene and 2-aminoanthracene to induce mutagenic<br>
results, all positive controls will be tested with and without s9 homogenate.<br>
Strain Characteristics and Strain Standard Plate Counts: 25      Strain characteristics will be verified and viable counts will be determined.<br>
Spot Plate Inhibition Screen:<br>
The extract(s) or solubilized material(s) and<br>
30  negative control(s) will be evaluated by a spot plate<br>
technique modeled after the antimicrobial zone of inhibition test. This screen is used to evaluate extract or solution concentrations for toxicity which are noninhibitory to the Salmonella strains and the E. coli 35  strain.<br>
Separate tubes containing 2 ml of molten top agar supplemented with histidine-biotin (for S. typhimurium) or<br><br>
WO 2006/034547	PCT/AU2005/001491<br>
-   72   -<br>
with tryptophan (for E. coli) will be inoculated with 0.1 ml of culture for each of the five tester strains. After mixing, the agar will be poured across the surface of separate Minimal E plates labeled with lab number, 5  appropriate tester strain, and dose level (when<br>
necessary). Once the agar solidifies, sterile filter discs will be placed in the center of the plates. A 0.1 ml aliquot of the extract or solubilized material will be added to the filter discs on each of the labeled plates.<br>
10  Parallel testing will be conducted with a negative<br>
control. To demonstrate a positive zone of inhibition, 1OX stock Dexon will be used.<br>
The plates will be incubated at 3 7 ± 2°C for 2-3 days. Following the incubation period, the zone of growth<br>
15  inhibition will be recorded. If significant inhibition of the background lawn occurs, the extract or solubilized material concentration will be adjusted by preparing one or more dilutions and repeating the inhibition screen to find a nontoxic level.<br>
20<br>
Standard Plate Incorporation Assay:<br>
Separate tubes containing 2 ml of molten top agar supplemented with histidine-biotin solution (for 3. typhimurium) or tryptophan (for E. coil) will be<br>
25  inoculated with 0.1 ml of culture for each of the five<br>
tester strains, and 0.1 ml of the test material. A 0.5 ml aliquot of SWI or S9 homogenate, simulating metabolic activation, will be added when necessary. The mixture will be poured across triplicate Minimal B plates labeled with<br>
30  lab number, appropriate tester strain, and S9 metabolic activation (when applicable). Parallel testing will be conducted on a negative control and five positive controls.<br>
Histidine-free media plates (for S. typhimurium) and<br>
35  tryptophan-free media plates (for E, coli) will be prepared in triplicate as follows:<br><br>
WO 2006/034547	PCT/AU2005/001491<br>
-   73   -<br>
1.	Extract or solubilized material with and without S9<br>

2.	Negative control with and without S9 activation<br>
3.	1X Dexon (known mutagen) with and without S9<br>
5        activation with strains TA9S, TA100, and TA1 537<br>
4.	1X 2-aminofluorene (known mutagen) with and without<br>

without S9 activation with strain WP2uvrA<br>
■ 7.   IX Methylmethane-sulfonate (known mutagen) with and without S9 activation with strain WP2uvrA<br>
15       The plates will be incubated at 37 ± 2°C for 2-3<br>
days. After the incubation period, the revertant colonies on each plate (test, negative and positive) will be counted and recorded. The mean number of revertants will be calculated.<br>
20<br>
Evaluation of Test Results:<br>
The mean number of revertants of the triplicate test plates will be compared to the mean number of revertants of the triplicate negative control plates for each of the<br>
25  five tester strains employed. The means obtained for the positive controls are used as points of reference. For a test material to be identified as a test failure or "potential mutagen" there must be a 2-fold or greater increase in the number of mean revertants over the means<br>
30  obtained from the negative control, for any/all five<br>
tester strains. If no 2-fold increase is present, the test material is considered nonmutagenic.<br>
Any apparent "positive response" will be confirmed by demonstrating a dose-response relationship using three<br>
35  nontoxic dose levels of the test material. There should be a range of concentrations that produce a linear dose response. In the event linearity cannot be established,<br><br>
WO 2006/034547	PCT/AU2005/001491<br>
-   74   -<br>
the assay will be repeated with an appropriate change in dose levels. A test material will be judged mutagenic if it causes a dose-related increase in the number of revertants over a minimum of two increasing dose 5  concentrations.<br>
Test Validity:<br>
For any assay to be considered valid, it must meet the following criteria: 10<br>
1.    Strain characteristics: All S typhimurium tester strains (TA98, TA100, TA1535, and TA1537) must exhibit sensitivity to crystal violet {rfa mutation), and ultraviolet light (uvrB), and must 15        exhibit no growth on biotin plates, and growth on<br>
histidine-biotin plates. Tester strains TA98 and TA 100 must exhibit resistance to ampicillin (R-factor); tester strains TA153 5 and TA153 7 must exhibit sensitivity to ampicillin. Tester strain 20       WP2uvrA must exhibit sensitivity to ultraviolet light, no growth on tryptophan deficient plates, growth on tryptophan supplemented media and sensitivity to ampicillin.<br>
25  2.    Strain Standard Plate Counts: A viable count on the working culture suspensions for each tester strain (TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537 and WP2uvrA) should not be less than 1 x 10 CFU/ml,<br>
30  3.    Spot Plate Inhibition Screen: Each prepared extract or solubilized material will be evaluated for inhibition or toxicity to the cells. A test sample that is noninhibitory to moderately noninhibitory to the tester strains will be tested by the standard<br>
35       plate incorporation method. In the event a test<br>
material is inhibitory, dilutions will be required to find a nontoxic level.<br><br>
WO 2006/034547	PCT/AU2005/001491<br>
-   75   -<br>
4.   Standard Plate Incorporation Assay: Each positive<br>
control mean must exhibit at least a 3-fold increase over the respective negative control mean of the 5       Salmonella tester strain employed, and at least a 2-fold increase over the respective negative control mean of the E. coli tester strain. Exceptions include conditions not intended to provoke a mutagenic response (e.g. 2-aminoanthracene and 2-<br>
10       aminofluorene without metabolic activation). The<br>
negative control results of each tester strain will exhibit a characteristic number of spontaneous revertants. Spontaneous reversion rates may vary, but should be consistent with the ranges specified<br>
15        (see Table below). The Table is meant as a guideline only. Negative control results for tester strains may fall outside of the range listed. In such an instance, the results should be evaluated with caution.<br>
