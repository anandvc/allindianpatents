[Document Name] Specification<br>
[Title of the Invention]  FRONT BODY COVER STRUCTURE FOR MOTORCYCLE [Technical Field] [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a front body cover structure for a motorcycle, in which lamps are arranged at a spacing from each other on both sides of a front cover for covering a head pipe, which steerably supports a steering stem and is provided at a front end of a body frame, and the steering stem from the front, and in which an auxiliary machine that is covered from the front by the front cover is disposed in front of the stem and the head pipe and between both the lamps. [Background Art] [0002]<br>
In a known front body cover structure for a motorcycle disclosed in Patent Document 1, in order to allow maintenance of items stored inside a front cover, and lamps, a maintenance opening is provided in the front cover between left and right lamps, and the opening is closed by a maintenance lid. [Patent Document 1] JP Patent No. 3321673 [Disclosure of the Invention] [Problem to be Solved by the Invention] [0003]<br>
However, in the structure disclosed in Patent Document 1 mentioned above, the maintenance opening is provided in the front cover at a position spaced from the inner side edges of the left and right lamps, and there is still room for<br><br>
improvement to achieve ease of maintenance such as lamp bulb replacement. One conceivable way to achieve this is to enlarge the opening so as to extend to the inner side edges of both the lamps. However, this also leads to an enlarged size of the maintenance lid to make the maintenance lid more conspicuous, so the freedom of design of the maintenance lid decreases, and also the freedom of exterior design decreases. [0004]<br>
The present invention has been made in view of the circumstances mentioned above, and accordingly it is an object of the present invention to provide a front body cover structure for a motorcycle which can enhance the ease of maintenance while enhancing the freedom of maintenance lid design and exterior design.<br>
[Means for Solving the Problem] [0005]<br>
To attain the above-mentioned object, in an aspect of the invention in Claim 1, there is provided a front body cover structure for a motorcycle, including: lamps arranged at a spacing from each other on both sides of a front cover for covering a head pipe, which steerably supports a steering stem and is provided at a front end of a body frame, and the steering stem from the front; and an auxiliary machine covered from the front by the front cover, the auxiliary machine being disposed in front of the stem and the head pipe and between both the lamps, wherein both the lamps are formed vertically elongated in front view, and the front cover includes a cover main body to which both the lamps are attached and which has a maintenance<br><br>
opening formed between inner side edges of both the lamps, and a maintenance lid that is formed by a plurality of lid component members including a first lid component member and is detachably attached to the cover main body so as to close the opening. [0006]<br>
In an aspect of the invention in Claim 2, in addition to the aspect of the invention in Claim 1, the first lid component member integrally has a pair of left and right vertically elongated portions adjacent to the inner side edges of both the lamps and extending vertically, and a connecting portion connecting between lower portions of both the vertically elongated portions so as to form an upwardly open recess between both the vertically elongated portions, and a portion of the maintenance lid excluding the first lid component member is formed in a downwardly convex shape so as to close the recess. [0007]<br>
In an aspect of the invention in Claim 3, in addition to the aspect of the invention in Claim 2, the cover main body is formed by fastening a pair of left and right side cover members, to which the lamps are attached, to a laterally central portion of the body frame below the opening, and the first lid component member is formed in a substantially Y shape and integrally has a projection projecting downward from the connecting portion so as to cover a fastening portion of both the side cover members to the body frame from the front. [0008]<br>
In an aspect of the invention in Claim 4, in addition to the aspect of the invention in Claim 3, both the side cover<br><br>
members integrally have extended portions whose distal ends are fastened to the body frame and which are arranged below lower ends of the vertically elongated portions of the first lid component member and extend on sides in close proximity to each other so as to form a lower edge of the opening, and a pair of left and right windows are formed by both lower left and right side portions of the first lid component member, lower inner side edges of both the lamps, and upper edges of both the extended portions. [0009]<br>
In an aspect of the invention in Claim 5, in addition to the aspect of the invention in Claim 4, a support stay extending through each of the windows and projected forward of the front cover is secured to the body frame, and a front license plate is attached to a front end of the support stay. [0010]<br>
In an aspect of the invention in Claim 6, in addition to the aspect of the invention in any one of Claims 1 to 5, the first lid component member is formed such that in a state with the opening covered by the maintenance lid, upper edges of the vertically elongated portions are smoothly continuous to upper edges of the lamps. [0011]<br>
It should be noted that a front cowl 36 according to an embodiment corresponds to the front cover according to the present invention, a leg shield 39 according to an embodiment corresponds to the side cover member according to the present invention, a winker 49 according to an embodiment corresponds to<br><br>
the lamp according to the present invention, and a battery 50 and a horn 51 according to an embodiment correspond to the auxiliary machine according to the present invention. [Effect of the Invention] [0012]<br>
According to the aspect of the invention in Claim 1, a maintenance opening is formed between the inner side edges of the left and right lamps, thereby facilitating maintenance of the auxiliary machine and lamps. Further, the maintenance lid is formed by a plurality of lid component members, and the first lid component member as one of those lid component members is arranged adjacent to the inner side edges of the lamps and forms an upwardly open recess. The portion of the maintenance lid excluding the first lid component member is formed in a downwardly convex shape so as to close the recess. Therefore, by dividing up the maintenance lid into smaller parts, the freedom of design of the maintenance lid is enhanced, and it is also possible to achieve a design that makes the maintenance lid look small and relatively inconspicuous. [0013]<br>
According to the aspect of the invention in Claim 2, a structure is employed in which the vicinity of the areas adjacent to the lamps is formed by the vertically elongated portions of the first lid component member that is separate from the other areas, a distinctive design that makes the lamps conspicuous can be attained, thereby making it possible to enhance the viewability of the lamps and also achieve an improvement in terms of outward appearance.<br><br>
According to the aspect of the invention in Claim 3, the fastening portion of both the side cover members to the body frame is covered by the substantially Y-shaped first lid component member; Therefore, it is possible to suppress an increase in the size of the maintenance lid while keeping the number of members constituting the maintenance lid to the absolute minimum. [0015]<br>
According to the aspect of the invention in Claim 4, a pair of left and right windows are formed by both lower left and right side portions of the first lid component member, lower inner side edges of both the lamps, and upper edges of both the extended portions of both the side cover members. Therefore, as compared with a case where windows are formed in a single member, the molding die can be simplified. Further, the lamps as heat-generating members, and the auxiliary machine received within the front cover can be cooled by the running wind introduced into the front cover from the windows. [0016]<br>
According to the aspect of the invention in Claim 5, since the front license plate is attached to the front end of the support stay extending through each of the windows, detachment of the maintenance lid is possible without detaching the support stay, so the ease of maintenance is not affected by the presence/absence of the support stay. [0017]<br>
According to the aspect of the invention in Claim 6, in a<br><br>
state with the opening covered by the maintenance lid, upper edges of the vertically elongated portions of the first lid component member are smoothly continuous to upper edges of the lamps. This can provide an effect of making the first lid component member look integral with the lamps, thereby making the maintenance lid less conspicuous.

Therefore, it is possible to enlarge the opening area of the opening 58 to allow easy maintenance of the battery 50, the horn 51, and both the winkers 49. [0043]<br>
Further, the maintenance lid 60 is formed by the plurality of lid component members, which in this embodiment are the first and second lid component members 66, 67. The maintenance lid 60 is thus divided up into smaller parts, which enhances the freedom of design of the maintenance lid 60, and also enables a design that makes the maintenance lid 60 look small and relatively inconspicuous.<br><br>
Further, the first lid component member 66 integrally has the pair of left and right vertically elongated portions 66a adjacent to the inner side edges of both the winkers 49 and extending vertically, and the connecting portion 66b connecting between lower portions of both the vertically elongated portions 66a so as to form the upwardly open recess 68 between both the vertically elongated portions 66a. A portion of the maintenance lid 60 excluding the first lid component member 66, that is, the second lid component member 67 is formed in a downwardly convex shape so as to close the recess 68. Therefore, by employing a structure in which the vicinity of the areas adjacent to the winkers 49 is formed by the vertically elongated portions 66a of the first lid component member 66 that are separate from other areas, a distinctive design that makes the winkers 49 conspicuous can be attained, thereby making it possible to enhance the viewability of the winkers 49 and also achieve an improvement in terms of outward appearance. [0045]<br>
Further, the cover main body 59 is formed by fastening the front cowl component portions 39a, which are integrally-included in the leg shields 39 and to which the winkers 49 are attached, to a laterally central portion of the body frame F below the opening 58. The first lid component member 66 is formed in a substantially Y shape and integrally has the projection 66c projecting downward from the connecting portion 66b so as to cover the fastening portion of both the front cowl component portions 39a to the body frame F from the front.<br><br>
Therefore, it is possible to suppress an increase in the size of the maintenance lid 60 while keeping the number of members constituting the maintenance lid 60 to the absolute minimum. [0046]<br>
Further, both the leg shields 39 integrally have the extended portions 39b whose distal ends are fastened to the body frame F and which are arranged below lower ends of the vertically elongated portions 66a of the first lid component member 66 and extend on sides in close proximity to each other so as to form a lower edge of the opening 58. The pair of left and right windows 85 are formed by both lower left and right side portions of the first lid component member 66, lower inner side edges of both the winkers 49, and upper edges of both the extended portions 39b. Therefore, the molding die can be simplified as compared with a case where windows are formed in a single member. Further, the winkers 49 as heat-generating members, and the battery 50 and the horn 51 received within the front cowl 36 can be cooled by the running wind introduced into the front cowl 36 from the windows 85 and, in this embodiment, noise generated by the horn 51 can be effectively emitted forward from the windows 85. [0047]<br>
Further, the support stays 53 extending through the windows 85 and projected forward of the front cowl 36 are secured to the body frame F, and the front license plate 54 is attached to the front ends of the support stays 53. Therefore, detachment of the maintenance lid 60 is possible without detaching the support stays 53, so the ease of maintenance is<br><br>
not affected by the presence/absence of the support stays 53. [0048]<br>
Further, the first lid component member 66 is formed such that in a state with the opening 58 covered by the maintenance lid 60, upper edges of che vertically elongated portions 66a are smoothly continuous to upper edges of the winkers 49. This provides an effect of making the first lid component member 66 look integral with the winkers 4 9, thereby making the maintenance lid 60 less conspicuous. [0049]<br>
While the embodiments of the present invention have been described above, the present invention is not limited to the above-mentioned embodiments but various design modifications can be made without departing from the scope of the present invention defined in the appended claims.
