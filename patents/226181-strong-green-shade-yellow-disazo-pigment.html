				<td>Title: STRONG GREEN -SHAPE YELLOW DISAZO PIGMENT<br>
This invention generally relates to novel green-shade yeHow disazo<br>
pigments and to the use of such pigments in plastics, paints and inks.<br>
Azo yellow pigments are a class of colorants that are tinctorially strong<br>
and relatively inexpensive. Monoazo yellow pigments exhibit good<br>
lightfastness and are useful as coloring agents for paints and some printing<br>
inks. In plastics, however, monoazo yellow p$ments tend to undesirably<br>
bloorrr and discolor at high temperatures, so their use is disfavored. Diarylide<br>
disazo yellow pigments, made from 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine, are much stronger<br>
tinctorially and show a much tower tendency to bloom and discolor at high<br>
temperatures. C.I. Pigment Yellow 17 is a strong green-shade diarylide<br>
yellow and has often been used for plastics. W. Herbst and K. Hunger,<br>
Industrial Organic Pigments. VCH, Mew York, 1993, p. 252, state: "The<br>
plastics industry, however, uses P.Y. 17 extensively, . . . P.Y. 17 is also<br>
frequently used in polyolefins . . Its heat stability in these media was said to<br>
be about 770 to 24Q°C." However, R Az et at reported in Dyes and<br>
Pigments, 15. 1 (1991), that diarylide yellows are degraded to potantially<br>
carcinogenic by-products (e.g., 3,3-dichlorobenzidine) in plastics processed<br>
above 200°C, a temperature lower than that used in processing most plastics<br>
(many plastics are processed at temperatures from 230°C to 330°C). in<br>
efforts to overcome these disadvantages, azo pigment manufacturers have<br>
actively pursued development of other types of azo yellows.<br>
One alternative type of azo yellows include disazo yellow pigments<br>
made by coupling bis(acetoacetamido|benzenes (BAAAB) into aniline<br>
derivatives. U.S. Patent 5,616,778 to Goldmann et al relates to coupling<br><br>
1,4-BAAAB into 2,5-dicarbomethoxyaniltne (to give C.I. Pigment Yellow 155)<br>
and heating the pigment in an organic solvent at 80-150°C for up to 6 hours.<br>
coupling (1,4-BAAAB) into dozens of antftne<br>
derivatives, but does not mention 2-ethoxyaniKne (o-phenetidine). This<br>
patent relates to processes for making alt these disazo aniline derivative<br>
pigments (with a fairly complete list of possible aniline substituents, including<br>
C1-C4 alkoxy) in the presence of nonionic surfactants having a 5-90°C cloud<br>
point to give pigments suitable for printing inks.<br>
German Offenlegungsschrift 3501199 (1981, Sandoz GmbH) relates<br>
to coupling 1,4-BAAAB into mixtures of anilines substituted with one or two<br>
carboalkoxy groups to give pigments that disperse easily into polypropylene.<br>
Canadian Patent 1135688 (1982. Hoechst AG) relates to the pigments<br>
resulting from coupling 1,4-BAAAB into anilines substituted with nitro .and<br>
carboalkoxy groups. Czech Patents 188727 (1981) and 185798 (1978)<br>
relate to the pigments resulting from coupling 1,4-BAAAB into anHines<br>
substituted with urea groups. U.S. Patents 4,146,558 and 4,103,092 to<br>
Jefferies et al relate to coupling 1,4-BAAAB into anilines substituted with<br>
quaternized aminoalkyl or aminoalkoxy groups' to give water-soluble dyes.<br>
Swiss Patent 585247 a 977. Sandoz Ltd.) relates to coupling 1,4-BAAAB<br>
into an aminoquinoline derivative and heating with N.N-dimethylformamide at<br>
140 °C to obtain a greenish yellow pigment for coloring polyvinylchoride<br>
plastics. U.S. Patent 3,978,038 to Cseh et af lists 327 Examptes of<br>
pigments resulting from coupling 1,4-BAAAB or various substituted 1,4-<br>
BAAABs into anilines substituted with nitro groups. U.K. Patents 1400533<br>
and 1396526 (1975, Ctba-Geigy AG) relate to the pigments resulting from<br>
coupling 1,4-BAAAB or various substituted 1,4-BAAABs into anilines<br>
substituted with a chlorine and methyl groups or two chlorine groups.<br>
German Offenlegungsschrift 2336915 (1973, Farbwerke Hoechst AG) relates<br>
to the pigments resulting from coupling 1,4-BAAAB or various substituted<br>
1,4-BAAABs into anilines substituted with nitro groups and other groups.<br><br>
Other alternative types of azo yellows include the metallized monoazo<br>
yellow, analogous to the matallized red pigments that exhibit high<br>
yellow, but much weaker tinctorially than CLI. Pigment Yellow 17. Another<br>
metallized monoazo yellow, described m U.S. Patent 5,669,967 to Hays, is<br>
stronger tinctorially than C.I. Pigment Yellow 17, but is an even redder<br>
yellow (though not as red as metallized medium-shade yeHows C.I.Pigment<br>
Yellows 183 and 191).<br>
Two alternative yellow pigments used by ptastrcs processors include<br>
C.I. Pigment Yellow 109 (isoindolinone) and C.I. Pigment YeHow 133<br>
(quinophthalone). These green-shade yellows are very close in hue to C.I.<br>
Pigment Yellow 17, but are much more expensive, much weaker and contain<br>
eight chlorine atoms per molecule, a potential emaromnental dtsartfcantage. in<br>
this connection, generally speaking, the-paaattMty of degradation into<br>
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and other dangerous compounds exists with<br>
aromatic compounds containing chlorine atoms.<br>
Plastics processors using diarylide yellows are particularly conscious of<br>
the increased costs of using the higher concentrations of weaker yellows<br>
required for coloring plastics to the required tinctorial strengths. Although<br>
C.L Pigment Yellow 155, a disazo pigment made from coupling 1,4-BAAAB,<br>
is available, this pigment (Sandorin 40) is much weaker and slightty redder<br>
than C.I. Pigment Yellow 17 and shows poor heal stability (seeJaaiaw) at<br>
288°C, a temperature commonly used to process polypropyleoe and other<br>
plastics. Thus, there is a need for new green-shade yellow azo pigments that<br>
exhibit strength comparable to C.I. Pigment Yellow 17, exhibit good heat<br>
stability and good light fast ness, and present little or no adverse<br>
environmental impact.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention relates to a green shade<br>
yellow pigment composition comprising a compound having the formula:<br><br><br>
wherein R1 and R2 are independently hydrogen, halogen, an alkyl group<br>
having 1 to aoout 4 carbon atoms, an alkoxy group having 1 to about 4<br>
carbon atoms, an alkoxycarbonyl group having 1 to about 6 carbon atoms,<br>
nitro, cyano, phenoxy or trifluoromethyl.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention relates to a method of<br>
preparing a green shade yellow pigment composition which comprises making<br>
a disazo pigment by coupling (i) a diazonium component made iromone or<br>
more aromatic amines wherein at least one of said amines is 2-ethoxyaniline<br>
with (ii) at least one coupling component characterized by the-formula:<br><br><br>
wherein R1 and R2 are independently hydrogen, halogen, an alkyl group<br>
having 1 to about 4 carbon atoms, an alkoxy group having 1 to about 4-<br>
carbon atoms, an alkoxycarbonyl group having 1 to about 6 carbon atoms<br>
nitro, cyano, phenoxy or trifluoromethyi.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the present mvention relates to^plastics,<br>
paints or inks containing disazo pigments according to the invention.<br>
The disazo pigments according to the present invention me very<br>
surprising because one substituent, the 2-ethoxy group, is believed to impart<br>
high tinctoftaf-and chromatic strength, food heat stability and $ood<br>
lightfastness.<br>
The present invention relates to green-shade yellow disazo pigments<br>
suitable for use as a coloring agent, methods of making and using the disazo<br>
pigment, and plastics, paints and inks containing the disazo pigments.<br>
Disazo pigments according to the present invention, made with an ethoxy<br>
group in the 2-position relative to the diazo group, exhibit unexpectedly high<br>
tinctorial strengths, even higher than that of C.I. Pigment-Yellow 17, while<br>
simultaneously exhibiting good heat stability. In addition, the disazo<br>
pigments according to the present invention exhibit a combination of<br>
unexpectedly good heat stability and good lightfastness, in comparison to<br>
different disazo pigments with substrtuents other than the 2-ethoxy group.<br>
In many embodiments, the disazo pigments according to the present<br>
invention contain little (toss than 2 or 1) or no halogen atoms per pigment<br>
molecule, so the disazo pigments are environmentally friendly. Since the<br>
ethoxy group is believed to impart instability through decomposion via E1<br>
elimination of ethylene giving an easily oxidized phenolic derivative, the<br>
stability of the disazo pigments according to the present invention is<br>
unexpected.<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention rotates to coupling 1,4-<br>
bis(acetoacetamido)benzene or substituted 1,4-bis(acetoacetamido)benzene<br><br>
into about two equivalents of 2-ethoxyaniline (o-phenetidine) to give a disazo<br>
yellow pigment having the following chemical structure:<br><br>
wherein R1 and R2 are independently hydrogen, halogen, an alky! gnmp<br>
having 1 to about 4 carbon atoms, an aikoxy group having 1 to about 4<br>
carbon atoms, an alkoxycarbonyl group having 1 to about 6 carbon atoms,<br>
nitro, cyano, phenoxy or trifluoromethyl. In one embodiment, the disazo<br>
pigment is free of halogen atoms, and free of chlorine atomes in particular.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the present invention relates to coupling<br>
1,4-bis(acetoacetamido)benzene or substituted 1,4-<br>
bis(acetoacetamido)benzene into about two equivalents of 2-ethoxyaniline (o-<br>
phenetidine) to give a disazo yellow pigment having the following chemical<br>
structure:<br><br><br>
wherein R1 and R2 are independently hydrogen, halogen, an alkyl group<br>
having 1 to about 2 carbon atoms, an atkoxy group having 1 to about 2<br>
carbon atoms, or an alkoxycarbonyl group having 1 to about 4 carbon atoms<br><br>
in another preferred embodiment, the coupling of 1,4-<br>
bis(acetoacetamido)into about two equivalents of 2-ethoxyaniline (o-<br>
phenetidine) provides the disazo yellow pigment having the formula:<br><br>
The pigments of the present invention may be prepared by initially<br>
diazotizing one or more aromatic amines wherein at toast one of said amines<br>
is 2-ethoxyaniline; and thereafter coupling the diazonium component with a<br>
coupling component comprised of a bis(acetoacetamido)benzene coupler to<br>
form the desired pigment.<br>
2-ethoxyanittne is also known as o-phenetidine. At least one of the<br>
aformmr amines is free of halogen atoms, such as chlorine atoms, and nitre<br>
groups. Mixtures of two or more aromatic amines, such as 2-ethoxyanHine<br>
and an aromatic amine that is not 2-ethoxyaniline are within the scope of this<br>
invention. Aromatic amines that are not 2-ethoxyaniline include various<br>
an^ine compounds, aminobenzoate compounds, aminobenzamide compounds,<br>
anilide compounds, aminoanthraquinone compounds, benztmidazote<br>
compounds, benzimidazolone compounds, benzimidazolethione compounds,<br>
benzoxazole compounds, benzoxazolone compounds, benzothiazole<br>
compounds, benzothiazolone compounds, indazole compounds, phthalimide<br><br>
compounds, naphthatimide compounds, benzetriazote compounds, quinoline<br>
compounds, quinazoline compounds, quinazolinone compounds, phthalazine<br>
dibenzo-phenazine compounds, quinoxzlinone compounds, carbazoie<br>
compounds, indole compounds, arrttnonaphthaiera compounds, and<br>
naphthylamino compounds. The aromatic amines from which the dtazonium<br>
components are prepared are available commercially or can be prepared using<br>
methods known in the art.	.<br>

may be carried out in the manners known to those afeMled in the art. For<br>
example, diazotization may be carried out through the use of alkali metal<br>
nitrites or lower alkyl nitrites together with an adequately strong acid such as<br>
a mineral acid. Examples of useful mineral acids include hydrochloric acid<br>
and sulfuric acid. Nitrosyl suffuric acid also can be utilized. The diazotization<br>
reaction can be conducted at a temperature in the range of from about -20 °G<br>
to about 30°C, preferably from about 0°C to about 20°C.<br>

in which R is an alley! group having from about 3 to about 20 carbon atoms<br>
and preferably from about 4 to about 13 carbon atoms.<br>
In one embodiment, it is advantageous in the diazotization reactions (and in<br>
the subsequent coupling reactions) to. include one or more appropriate organic<br>
solvents. For example, suitable organic solvents include one or more of<br>
glacial acetic acid, lower alkanols, dioxane, formamide, dimethyl formamide,<br>
dimethyl sulfoxide, pyridine or N-methyl pyrrolidone. In another embodiment,<br><br>
it is advantageous in the diazotization reactions (and in the subsequent<br>
coupling reactions) not to include one or more organic-solvents.<br>
bis(acetoacetamido)benzene and substituted 1,4-<br>
bis(acetoacetamido)benzenes. The bis(acetoacetamido)benzene couplers<br>
useful for the purposes of this invention are represented by the formula:<br><br>
wherein R1 and R2 are independently hydrogen, halogen, an alley! group<br>
having 1 to about 4 carbon atoms, an alkoxy group having 1 to about 4<br>
carbon atoms, an atkoxycarbonyJ group havMg, 1 to about-6 carbon atoms,<br>
nitro, cyano, phenoxy or trifluoromethyl. Halogens include fluorine, chlorine,<br>
bromine and iodine. These compounds are known or can be synthesized<br>
using techniques known in the-art.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the bis(acetoacetamido)benzene couplers<br>
useful for the purposes of this invention are characterized by the formula:<br><br><br><br><br><br>
bis(acetoacetamido)benzene. Mixtures of two or more of any of the<br>
bis(acetoacetamido)benzene coupler components are within the scope of this<br>
invention.<br>
The coupling reaction useful for the purposes ot theupresent invention<br>
may be effected preferably by adding the coupling components to diazonium<br>
components, but the diazonium components can be added to the coupling<br>
components. Coupling is generally effected at a temperature of from about -<br>
20°C lo about 80°C, preferably from about 0°C to about 40°C. Asinthe<br>
diazotization reaction, coupling may be carried out in the presence or absence<br>
of an suitable surface active agent and/or organic solvent, such as ait of<br>
those identified above for the diazotization reaction.<br>
In one embodiment, the coupling component is dissolved m a basic<br>
solution such as a hydroxide solution including an aqueous alkali metal<br>
hydroxide solution and reprecipitated with a dilute acid such as acetic acid.<br>
In another embodiment, generally, the diazonium component is coupled<br>
with a slight stoichiometric excess of the coupling component. That is, two<br>
equivalents of the diazonium component are coupled with slightly more than<br>
two equivalents of the coupling component. In one embodiment, the ratio of<br>
equivalents of the diazonium component to the coupling component iy frorrr<br>
about 1.7:2 to about 2.1:2. In another embodiment, the ratio of equivalents<br><br>
of the diazonium component to the coupling component is from about 1.8:2<br>
to about 2:2 and preferably from about 1.9:2 to about 2:2.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the dispersibility of<br>
the pigments of the present invention can be improved by adding aifcafr-<br>
soluble resin-tike products before, during, or after the coupling is completed.<br>
Various resin-like materials can be added for this purpose, and these include<br>
for example, rosin resins, polymeric rosins, resin soap, chemically modified<br>
rosin resins, such as rosin-maleinate resins, alkyd resins, and other synthetic<br>
hydrocarbon resins with a higher acid number, or combination of these resins.<br>
The resins may be present in a product with free carboxyl groups that are<br>
capable of forming a salt, or may be partially or completely in the form of<br>
salts, for example, with alkali metal tons. It may also be advantageous to<br>
perform the coupling reaction in the presence of a finely divided insoluble<br>
material, for example, alkaline earth metal sulphates and carbonates, titanium<br>
dioxide or ctay materials or very finely divided organic plastic materials.<br>
in most applications, it is desirable, in order to achieve the full<br>
brightness and tinctorial strength, to heat the disazo pigment. For example,<br>
the disazo pigment may be heated to reflux temperature for about 1 to 3 .<br>
hours or at temperatures above about 100°C under pressure in the presence<br>
or absence of the above-described resin soaps or other soluble resins.<br>
After completion of the reactions and optional heating, the disazo pigments<br>
are- recovered from the water-based reaction slurry by littering to form jt.<br>
presscake of pigment which is washed with hot water (e.g., from about<br>
40°C to about 60°C) so as to remove the excess acids, bases and salts<br>
formed during the coupling reaction. The presscake is typically washed with<br>
from about 10 to about 20 times its volume of hot water. The filter cake is<br>
generally washed until the filtrate gives only a slightly positive test for<br>
chloride ion. The washed presscakes can be dried, ground and used in the<br>
form of a coarse or finely divided powder. Alternatively, the disazo pigments<br>
of this invention can be dispersed into oleoresinous vehicles to prepare<br><br>
flushed bases or dispersed into aqueous vehicles to prepare aqueous dispersions.<br>
The pigment compositions of this invention provide strongjyeen-shad e<br>
yetiow piginents havtng improved colour, strength, light fastness and/or heat<br>
stability and are useful as coloring agents in plastics, paints and inks. This<br>
invention, therefore, also relates to plastic, paint and ink compositions<br>
comprising major amounts of a plastic, paint vehicle or ink vehicle and minor<br>
amounts of the disazo pigment compositions of this invention.<br>
The paint, ink and plastic compositions in which the compositions of<br>
this invention are useful are well known to those of ordinary sk\ii m the art.<br>
Examples of inks include printing inks and lacquers, and examples of plastics<br>
include thermoplastic and thermosetting materials, natural resins and<br>
synthetic resins, polystyrene and its mixed polymers, polyolefins, in particular<br>
polyethylene and polypropylene, polyacrylic compounds, polyvinyl<br>
compounds, for example polyvinyl chloride and polyvinyl acetate, polyesters<br>
and rubber, and also filaments made of viscose and cellulose ethers, cellulose<br>
esters, polyamtdes, polycarbonates, polyurethanes, polyesters, for example<br>
polyglycol terephthalates, and polyacrylonitrile. It is also useful for pigment<br>
printing and for the pigmenting of paper in the mass.<br>
Due to its excellent heat resistance, the disazo pigment is particularly<br>
suitable for the pigmenting of plastics in the mass, such as, for example, of<br>
polystyrene and its mixed polymers, polyolefins, in particular polyethylene<br>
and polypopylene and the corresponding mixed polymers and copolymers,<br>
potyvinyl chloride and polyesters in particular polyethylene terephtbalate and<br>
polybutylene terephthalate and the corresponding mixed condensation<br>
products based on polyesters, and mixtures and copolymers thereof.<br>

solution, at which point the slurry still shows excess diazo when tested with<br>
R-salrsolution; after being stirred: 30 minutes, the slurry shows no excess<br>
diazo and pH 6.6. The slurry is stirred for an hour, followed by adjusting the<br>
pH to 5.5, heating to 100°C, boiling for 30 minutes, icing to lower than<br>

During the testing of pigments, the standard pigment, to which the<br>
experimental pigments are compared, is a green-shade diarylide yellow (C.I.<br>
Pigment Yellow 17) used in plastics under product designation RX1276<br>
available from Engelhard.<br>
Several commercial green-shade yellow pigments are included for<br>
comparison: Sandorin Yellow 4G (C.I. Pigment Yellow 155), which is a<br>
commercial example of this type of disazo pigment made with 1,4-<br>
bisacetoacetamidobenzene (1,4-BAAAB) available from Sandoz; Permanent<br><br>
Yettow NCG-71 (CJ. Pigment Yellow 16), which is another kind {different) of<br>
disazo pigment (made with bisacetoacetylated 3,3'-dimethylbenzidine<br>
available from Yellow 2GL FE (C.I pigment Yellow 109) an<br>
(C.I. Pigment Yellow 138), a quinophthalone pigment available from BASF.<br>
For comparing tinctorial strength and other coioristic values, the<br>
pigments are tested initially as 1:1 (0.1 phr pigment: 0.1 phr titanium<br>
dioxide) tints in high density polyethylene injection molded drips, as follows:<br>
A mixture of 0.500 part pigment, 0.500 part titanium dkmtde-and 500 parts<br>
high density polyethylene (Solvay T50-20O0-G) is shaken, on a paint shaker<br>
for 15 seconds, then injection molded at 232°C for 1.5 minutes in a 30 ton<br>
BattenfeH machine. Spectrophotometric values of the molded chips are<br>
measured with a Macbeth Color-Eye (specular component included, large<br>
area) to give K/S apparent strength versus the standard pigment and CIE<br>
L#C*h chroma, hue angle and lightness under Illuminant D, 10 degrees, as<br>
shown in Table I. To obtain a better measure of the tinctorial strengths, the<br>
strongest of the Experimental pigments is then tested in a reduced tint as<br>
0.50:1 (50% reduction in pigment content) by repeating this procedure,<br>
except that 0.250 part pigment is used in place of the 0.500 part pigment;<br>
the K/S apparent strength and CIE L*C*h chroma, hue angle and lightness<br>
under IHuminant D, 10 degrees, of this reduced tint are measured against a<br>
1:1 tint of RX1276 wwr are shown in Table tl. Toobtaio a better measure of<br>
the tinctorial strengths, the strongest of the Experimental pigments is then<br>
tested in a reduced tint as 0.30:1 (70% reduction in pigment content) by<br>
repeating this procedure, except that 0.150 part pigment is used in place of<br>
the 0.500 part pigment; the K/S apparent strength and CIE L*C*h chroma,<br>
hue angle and tightness under Hluminant D, 10 degrees, of this reduced tint<br>
are measured against a 1:1 tint of Paliotol Yeltow K 0961 HD (C.I. Pigment<br>
Yellow 133) and are shown in Table HI. To obtain another comparison of<br>
tinctorial strengths, the strongest of the Experimental pigments is then tested<br>
in a reduced tint as a 0.20:1 tint (80% reduction in pigment content) by<br><br>
repeating this procedure, except that 0.100 part pigment is used in place of<br>
the 0.500 part pigment; the K/S apparent strength and CIE L*C*h chroma,<br>
angle and lightness under illuminant D, 10 degree, of this reduced tint<br>
are measured against a 1:1 tint of Yeltow 2GLTE (C.I&gt; Pigment Yellow 109)<br>
and are shown in Table FV.<br>
For comparing heat stabilities, the pigments are tested as above for<br>
coloristic values of 1:1 tints, except that the chips are molded and held at<br>
288° for 3 minutes. Spectroptrotometric values of toe molded chips are<br>
measured with a Macbeth Color-Eye (specular component included, large<br>
area) versus the chips molded at 232° to give CIELab delta E values, as<br>
shown in Table V.<br>
For comparing fade resr'ance, the high density polyethylene injection<br>
molded 1:1 tint chips used for coloristic values are exposed for 100 hours in<br>
an Atlas Xenon Fade-Ometer. Spectrophotomelric values of the exposed<br>
chips are measured with a Macbeth Color-Eye (specular component included,<br>
large area) versus unexposed chips to give CIELab delta E values, as shown<br>
in Table V.<br>
For comparing apparent strength and hue angles in a paint vehicle, the<br>
standard pigment and the pigments of Examples 1 arid 4 are tested as 1:1<br>
tints as follows: A mixture of 0.50 part pigment, 0,50 parts titanium dioxide<br>
(DuPont Ti-Pure R-960), 23.2 parts air-dry alkyd enamel vehicle (containing<br>
86% medium oil alkyd, 13%rnif»eral spirits and 1% driers/antiskinning agent)<br>
and 75 parts media (Zircoa Znrbeads Y13041 is stirred with a spatula to a<br>
uniform mixture, sealed with a lid and shaken on a paint shaker for 30<br>
minutes. The dispersion is separated from the media, drawn down with a<br>
0.15 mm. gap coating bar on coated cardboard (Leneta Form 2-C) and<br>
allowed to dry for 1-2 days. Spectrophotometric values are measured with a<br>
Macbeth Color-Eye (specular component included, large area) to give the<br>
apparent strength and hue angles under tlluminant D, 10 degrees, shown in<br>
Table VI.<br><br><br><br>
In Table I, the apparent strengths of the Examples, all containing the 2-<br>
ethoxy substituent and made with different surfactants, are estimated to be<br>
16-23% stronger than P.Y. 17 in 1:1 tints; even though the pigment of<br>
Example 4 is diluted abovr 20% with surfactant, it maintains its apparent<br>
strength and chroma. The hue angles of the Example tints are generally<br>
slightly higher (slightly greener) than the P.Y. 17 tint. The apparent strengths<br>
of several Comparative Examples (C.E.), containing no substituent or<br>
substituents other than 2-ethoxy, are equal to 20% stronger than P.Y. 17;<br>
however, the chroma and lightness values indicate that, except for C.E. 2,<br>
these Comparative Examples obtain their apparent strengths not from strong<br>
chromas, but from lower tightness (dirtiness). Pigment Yellow 155 (Sandorin<br>
Yellow 4G), which is like the Comparative Examples and contains<br>
carbomethoxy groups at the 2- and 5- position, is 13% weaker and slightly<br>
redder than P.Y. 17. Pigment Yellow 16 (Permanent Yellow NCG-71), which<br>
is another kind of disazo yellow (made with bisacetoacetytated 3,3'-<br>
dimethylbenzidine), is about equal in strength and hue, but shows lower<br>
chroma. Also, for comparison, P.Y. 138 (Paliotol Yellow K 0961 HO), is<br>
18% weaker and somewhat greener than P.Y. 17; P. Y. 109 (Irgazin Yellow<br>
2GLTE) is 39% weaker and somewhat greener than P.Y. 17.<br>
When the apparent strengths or weaknesses in Table I are greater than<br>
about 10%, they tend to be underestimated, as demonstrated in the<br>
following Tables.<br><br><br>
In Table II, the apparent strength of Example 1, coupled in the<br>
presence of 5% N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-ciciakjtkanube oxide, is estimated<br>
tc be +5% in a O.5:1 this means that Example 1 is more than 100%<br>
stronger than P.Y. 17. Although the apparent strength, chroma and lightness<br>
values for the 0.5:1 tint of Example 1 are close to those of 1:1 P.Y. 17, the<br>
hue angle for the 0.5:1 tint of Example 1 is significantly higher (greener),<br>
which distinguishes it from 1:1 P.Y. 17.<br><br>
in Table III, the apparent strength of Example 1, coupled in the<br>
presence of 5% N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethy1)-cocoalkylarnine oxide, is estimated<br>
to be +4% in 0.3:1 tint; this means that Example 1 is more than 3.3 times<br>
stronger than P.Y. 138. The chroma, hue angle and tightness values forthe<br>
0.3:1 tint of Example 1 indicate that it is a good match for 1:1 P.Y. 138.<br><br><br>
In Table IV, the apparent strength of Example 1, coupled in the<br>
presence of 5 % N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-oxide, is estimated<br>
to be +10% in 0.2:1 unit; this means that Example 1 is more than 5 times<br>
stronger than P.Y. 109. The apparent strength, chroma and hue angle for<br>
the 0.2:1 tint of Example 1 are higher than those of 1:1 P.Y. 109, which<br>
distinguishes the 0.2:1 tint of Example 1 from 1:1 P.Y. 109.<br><br><br><br>
In Table V, the delta Es (a measure of change) for the heat stabilities<br>
of the Examples are about the same as for P.Y. 17 and are at or lower than<br>
the delta E = 2.0, typically considered to be the upper limit for concern by<br>
plastics processors, the delta Es for the fade resistances of the Examples<br>
range from 0.7 to 2.1, with four of them being tower than the 1.4 of P.Y.<br>
17, which is considered to have fairly good fade resistance (W. Herbst and K.<br>
Hunger, ibid, p. 252, state:. "P.Y. 17 is almost as lightfast as the-somewhat<br>
redder P.Y.13 (step 6-7 at 1/3 SO).").<br>
In Table V, the delta Es for the heat stabilities of the Comparative<br>
Examples (except for the acceptable 1.0 of Comparative Example 4, with the<br>
2-m#thyl substituent) range from marginal (Comparative Example 5, with the<br>
2-chloro substituent) to extremely poor (Comparative Examples 1 and 9, with<br>
no substituent and the 2-cyano substituent). The delta Es for the fade<br>
resistances of the Comparative Examples range from a marginal 1.9<br>
(Comparative Example 7, with a 2-phenoxy substituent) to a very poor VIS<br>
(Comparative Example 13, with the 4-ethoxy substituent). The delta Es for<br>
the heat stabilities of the commercial green-shade yellow pigments range,<br>
with the exception of P.Y. 109. from poor for P.Y. 138 to very poor for P.Y.<br>
155. The delta Es for the fade resistances of the commercial green-shade<br>
yellow pigments are good (1.1; 1.5) to very good (O.F; 0.8).<br><br><br>
in Table VI, Example 1 is about 7% weaker and shows tower chroma<br>
than P.Y. 17 in 1:1 tints in-air-dry enamel. This weakness is surprising in<br>
o light of the strength of Example 1 in HOPE and may arise from poorer<br>
dispersibility of Example 1 in air-dry enamel. Example 4, which is post-<br>
treated with 20% sodium bistridecyl sulfosuccinate, is also slightly weak;<br>
however, its chroma is as ht§h as that of P.Y. 17, indicating better<br>
dispersibility in air-dry enamel, so its lower apparent strength probably<br>
derives from its higher lightness. The hue angles of the Examples tint are<br>
higher (greener) than that of the P.Y. 17 tint.<br>
When incorporated in polyolefins, the pigments obtained-according to<br>
the present invention display strong, bright greenish shade yellows in<br>
contrast to the generally weaker shades displayed by conventional pigments.<br>
The relatively high chromaticity values are consistent with the brightness of<br>
the color displayed while the high strength is reflected by a relatively high<br>
K/S values.<br>

embodiments, it is to be understood that various modifications thereof will<br>
