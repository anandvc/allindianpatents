				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to techniques in a PKI (Publk Key<br>
Infrastructure), well suited for authenticating the validity of a public key<br>
certificate which serves to verify a signature for an electronic procedure<br>
received by a certain terminal and which has been issued bv A certification<br>
authority different from one trusted by the pertinent terminal.<br>
In various organizations and parties on private and publk bases,<br>
PKIs (Public Key Infrastructures) have been introduced and made ready<br>
for use in order to electronicize manifold procedures which were taken<br>
with sheoti. of paper in the past.<br>
Fig. 12 shows the relationship among a plurality of certification<br>
authorities which exist in a prior-art PKI.<br>
As shown in the figure, the certification authorities each issuing<br>
and managing public key certificates form a group having a tree structure<br>
whose apex is the root certification authority CA1. The group is called<br>
"security domain". The root certification authority CA1 issues public<br>
key certificates to the certification authorities CA21 - CA2n which are<br>
located directly downstream of itself. Besides each of the certified on<br>
authorities CA21 - CA2n issues public key certificates to the certification<br>
authorities CA21 - CA2n whkh are located directh downstream of itself.<br>
In this manner, each certification authority located directly upstream, in<br>
the tree issues public key certificates tc the certification authorities<br>
located directlv downstream of itself. Further, each of the certification<br><br>
authorities located at the downmost stream in the tree (hereinbelow,<br>
called "terminal admitting certification authorities") CAS1 - CASnm issues<br>
public key certificates to user terminals taking electronic procedures<br>
(hereinbelow, called "end entities") EE1 - EE8.<br>
The legality of a secret key (signature key) which eat.h of the end<br>
entities EE1 - EE8 uses for the signature of an electronic document is<br>
certified by the public key certificate issued by that one of the terminal<br>
admitting certification authorities CAS1 - CASnm which admits the<br>
pertinent end entity itself. In turn, the legality of a secret key which each<br>
of the terminal admitting certification authorities CAS1 - CASnm uses for<br>
the signature of the issued public key certificate is certified by the public<br>
key certificate issued by that one of the certification authorities CA(S - 1):<br>
- CA(S - l)n(m - 1) which admits the pertinent terminal admitting<br>
certification authority itself. Accordingly, the secret key which is used<br>
for the signature by each of the end entities EE1 - EE8 is finally certified by<br>
the public key certificate issued by the root certification authority CA1.<br>
The certification authority which finally certifies the legalities of the keys<br>
respectively used for the signatures by the end entities EE1 - EE8, in other<br>
words, which is trusted by the end entities EE1 - EE8 and which is located<br>
at the upmost stream in the tree, is called "trust anchor".<br>
Referring to Fig. 12, the end entity EE1 affires a signature to an<br>
electronic document, such as a written application, to be transmitted to<br>
the end entity EE8, by using the secret key of the end entity EE1 itself.<br>
Besides, the end entity EE1 attaches to the signed electronic document a<br>
public key certificate which pairs with the above secret key and which has<br>
been issued bv the terminal admitting cert:fication authority CAS1, for<br><br>
admitting this end entitv EE1, and it transmits the document and the<br>
certificate to the end entity EE8.<br>
The end entity EEx can verify the signature of the electronic<br>
document received from the end entity EE1. by employing the public key<br>
certificate attached to this electronic document. Since, however, the<br>
public key certificate is not one issued by the terminal admitting<br>
certification authority CASnm for admitting the end entity EE8, this end<br>
entity EEx cannot immediately trust the pertinent public key certificate.<br>
In this case, the end entity EEx must authenticate that the validity of the<br>
pertinent public key certificate is certified by the root certification<br>
authority CA1 which is the trust anchor of end entity EEx itself. A<br>
validity authentication process for the public key certificate is executed bv<br>
the following steps:<br>
(1) Search for Path from Trust anchor to Certification authority<br>
which is Issue origin of Public key certificate<br>
With a trust anchor (here, the root certification authority CA1) set<br>
as a start certification authority/ the processing of inspecting the issue<br>
destinations of public key certificates issued by the start certification<br>
authority and further inspecting if any downstream certification<br>
authorities are included among the inspected issue destinations, the issue<br>
destinations of public key certificates issued by the downstream<br>
certification authorities is continued until a certification authority being<br>
the issue origin of a pertinent public key certificate (here, the terminal<br>
admitting certification authority CAS1 for admitting the end entity EE1) is<br>
included among the further inspected issue destinations. Thus a path<br>
from the trust anchor to the certification authoiity being the issue origin<br><br>
of the pertinent public key certificate is searched for.<br>
(2) Verification of Detected path<br>
There are obtained public key certificates issued from the<br>
individual certification authorities located on the path detected by the<br>
step (1), to the certification authorities located directly downstream of the<br>
respective certification authorities on the path. Besides, the processing<br>
of verifying the signature of the pertinent public key certificate to be<br>
authenticated on its validity (here, the public key certificate issued to the<br>
end entity EE1 by the terminal admitting certification authority CAS1), in<br>
the light of the public key certificate issued by the certification authority<br>
(here, the certification authority CA(S-l)1) located directly upstream of the<br>
certification authority (here, the terminal admitting certification authority<br>
CAS1) having issued the pertinent public key certificate,, and subsequently<br>
verifying if the verification holds good, the signature of the public key<br>
certificate issued by the certification authority located directly upstream,<br>
in the light of the public key certificate issued by the certification<br>
authority located directly upstream still further, is continued until the<br>
upstream certification authority reaches the trust anchor. In a cast<br>
where such signature verification has held good up to the trust anchor in<br>
due course, the validity of the public key certificate to be authenticated on<br>
its validity shall have been authenticated.<br>
The end entity EEx can authenticate the legality of the electronic<br>
document received from the end entity EE2, in suih a way that the<br>
signature of the electronic document: is verified using the public key<br>
certificate attached to the electronic document and that the validity of the<br>
public key certificate used for verifying the signature of the electrone<br><br>
document is authenticated in accordance with the steps (1) and (2) stated<br>
above.<br>
Incidentally, it is premised in the foregoing that the process for<br>
authenticating the validity of the public key nertificate is executed in the<br>
end entity. However, the certificate validity authentication process is<br>
heavy in load, and a high processing capability ;s required of the end<br>
entity for the execution of the process. It has therefore been proposed by<br>
the IETF that a server for authenticating the validity of a certificate as is<br>
connected to the end entity through a network is disposed so as to<br>
authenticate the validity of the public key certificate instead of the end<br>
entity.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A certificate validity authenticating server hitherto proposed<br>
authenticates the validity of a public key certificate by executing the steps<br>
(1) and (2) stated before, each time it accepts a request from an end entity.<br>
Therefore, a time period for executing the steps (1) and (2) is, at least<br>
expended since the request of the end entity for the authentication of the<br>
validity of the public key certificate till the obtainment of the result of the<br>
authentication.<br>
Besides, although the example of Fig 12 is premised on only one<br>
security domain, a plurality of security domains are conjectured to coexist<br>
for the reason that PKIs have been introduced and made ready for use in<br>
various organizations and parties on. private and public bases as<br>
explained before, Even among the different security domains, the<br>
process for authenticating the validity ui a public key certificate as<br><br>
indicated by the steps (1) and (2) UP be realized bv performing<br>
cross-certification in such a way that the root certification authorities of<br>
the individual security domains issue the public key certificates of the<br>
security domains opposite to each other, or by disposing a bridge<br>
certification authority which performs, such cross-certification between it<br>
and each of the root certification authorities of the individual security<br>
domains, However, when the process for authenticating the validity of a<br>
public key certificate is executed among the plurality of security domains<br>
in this manner, the number of certification authorities increases, and the<br>
relationship among the certification authorities becomes more<br>
complicated unlike the simple tree structure as shown in Fig, 12, so that a<br>
load for executing the steps (1) and (2) stated before increases. Therefore,<br>
the time period which is expended since the request of the end entity tor<br>
the authentication of the validity of the public key certificate till the<br>
obtainment of the result of the authentication is further lengthened to<br>
incur degradation in service.<br>
The present invention has been made in view of the above<br>
circumstances, and has for its object to shorten a time period which a<br>
expended since a request for the authentication of the validity' of a public<br>
key certificate till the authentication of the validity.<br>
In order to accomplish the object, according to the present<br>
invention, in a certificate validity authenticating server which is<br>
connected to pluralities of terminals (end entities) and certification<br>
authorities through a network, processing stated below is executed in<br>
compliance with a request made by a certain terminal, in order to<br>
authenticate the validity of a public key certificate issued by a<br><br>
certification authority which is different from a certification authority<br>
trusted by the terminal.<br>
Irrespective of the request of any terminal for authenticating tht<br>
validity of a public key certificate, for example, periodically, there are<br>
performed:<br>
the path search step of executing a process in which,, with any<br>
certification authority set as a start certification authority, an issue<br>
destination of a public key certificate issued by the start certification<br>
authority is checked/ and subject to any certification authority included as<br>
the issue destination, an issue destination of a public key certificate issued<br>
by the issue-destination certification authority is further checked, the<br>
process being continued until all of the issue destinations of the public<br>
key certificates become terminals, thereby to search for paths which<br>
extend from said start certification authority to terminal admitting<br>
certification authorities having issued public key certificates to any<br>
terminals;<br>
the path verification step of executing for each of the paths<br>
detected by said path search step, a process in which, with said start<br>
certification authority set at an upstream side, a signature of the public<br>
key certificate issued by the terminal admitting certification authority on<br>
the pertinent path is verified in the light of the public kev certificate<br>
issued by the certification authority located directlv upstream, and subject<br>
to the verification having held good, a signature of the public key<br>
certificate issued by the terminal admitting certification authority located<br>
directly upstream is verified in the light of the public key certificate<br>
issued by the certification authority located directly upstream still further<br><br>
the process being continued until said certification authority located<br>
directly upstream becomes said start certification authority, thereby to<br>
verify said paths; and<br>
the path registration step of registering in a database those of said<br>
paths whose verifications have held good by said path verification step.<br>
Besides/ in a case where the certain terminal has made the request<br>
for authenticating the validity of the public key certificate issued by the<br>
terminal admitting certification authority which is different from the<br>
certification authority trusted by said terminal, said validity of said public<br>
key certificate is authenticated by checking whether or not the path<br>
between said certification authority trusted by said terminal and said start<br>
certification authority and the path between the different terminal<br>
admitting certification authority and said start certification authority are<br>
held registered in the database.<br>
According to the present invention, when the request tor<br>
authenticating the validity of the public key certificate has been received<br>
from the certain terminal, the reception need not be followed by the<br>
search for the path from the trust anchor of t-he pertinent terminal to the<br>
issue-origin certification authority of the subject public key certificate and<br>
the verification of the detected path as have been mentioned as the items<br>
(1) and (2} before. It is accordingly possible to shorten a time period<br>
which is expended since the request for the authentication of the validity<br>
of the public key certificate till the authentication cf the validity.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Now, embodiments of the present invention will bp ripsrribpri.<br>
Fig. 1 Is a diagram showing the schematic architecture of a PKI<br>
system to which an embodiment of the present invention is applied,<br>
As shown in the figure, the PKI system of this embodiment is so<br>
constructed that a plurality of end entities EH which are user terminals for<br>
taking electronic procedures, or request accepting servers for accepting<br>
requests from user terminals so as to take electronic procedures for the<br>
user terminals, a plurality of certification authorities CA for issuing and<br>
managing public key certificates, and a certificate validity authentication<br>
center VC for authenticating the validity of a public key certificate in<br>
compliance with a request made by the end entity EE, are interconnected<br>
through a network MET formed of, for example, LANs, WANs and the<br>
Internet connecting them.<br>
Fig. 2 is a diagram showing an example of the relationship among<br>
the individual certification authoritioc CA in the PKI system shown in Fig.<br>
1.<br>
As shown in the figure, it is premised in the PKI system of this<br>
embodiment that a plurality of securirv domains SD (SD1 - SD3) en private<br><br>
and governmental bases are coexistent. Some of the security domains SD<br>
(SD2 and SD3 in Fig. 2) are assumed to be so related that their root<br>
certification authorities CA (CA21 and CA31 in Fig. 2) perform<br>
cross-certification by, for example, issuing public key certificates to each<br>
other. Besides, the root certification authorities CA of the respective<br>
security domains SD (CAn, CA21 and CA31 in Fig. 2) are assumed to<br>
perform cross-certification between them and a bridge certification<br>
authority CAbridge by, for example, issuing public key certificates to the<br>
bridge certification authority CAbridge and also having public key<br>
certificates issued thereto by the bridge certification authority CAbridge.<br>
In this way, a path can be formed between the certification authority CA<br>
belonging to a certain one of the security domains SD and the certification<br>
authority CA belonging to another in order that the validity of the public<br>
key certificate issued by one certification authority CA may be<br>
authenticated by the other certification authority CA.<br>
Next, there will be explained the end entity EE, certification<br>
authority CA and certificate validity authentication center VC which<br>
constitute the PKI system described above,<br>
First the end entity EE will be explained.<br>
Fig. 3 is a block diagram showing the schematic construction of the<br>
end entity EE,<br>
As shown in the figure, the end entity EE includes a processing<br>
unit 10a, a storage unit 10b. a communication unit 16 which serves to<br>
communicate with another device through the network NET, and an<br>
input/output unit 17 which inputs/outputs electronic documents created<br>
by users or electronic documents received !rom other end entities EE a<br><br><br>
user terminals, and which accepts instructions given by the users.<br>
The processing anit 10a includes a signature generation unit 14, a.<br>
signature verification unit 15, and a control unit 18 which collectively<br>
controls the various units of the end entity EE.<br>
The storage unit 10b includes an electronic document holding unit<br>
11 which holds therein the electronic documents created by the users<br>
(received from the user terminals, in the case where the end entity EE is<br>
the accepting server), a key holding unit 12 which holds therein secret<br>
keys (signature keys) and public key certificates pairing with the<br>
respective secret keys, and a verification subject holding unit 13 which<br>
holds therein signed electronic documents and public key certificates<br>
received from other end entities EE.<br>
In such a construction, when the control unit 18 has accepted from<br>
the user through the input/output unit 17 an instruction to the effect that<br>
an electronic document held in the electronic document holding unit 11 is<br>
to be transmitted to another end entity EE, it reads out the pertinent<br>
electronic document from the electronic document holding unit 11 and<br>
delivers this document to the signature generation unit 14. Then, the<br>
signature generation unit 14 generates a signature for the pertinent<br>
electronic document by using a secret key held :n the key holding unit 12.<br>
affixing the signature created by the signature generation unit 14, to the<br>
electronic document read out of the electronic document holding unit J 1.<br>
Further, it attaches a public key certificate held in the key holding unit 12,<br>
to the signed electronic document created, whereupon it transmits them to<br>
the address of the end entity EE being a transmission destination<br><br>
indicated by the user, through the communication unit 16.<br>
In addition, when the control unit 18 has received a signed<br>
electronic document and a public key certificate from another end entity<br>
EE through the communication unit 16, it causes the verification subject<br>
holding unit 13 to hold them and simultaneously notifies the holding<br>
operation to the signature verification unit 13. Then, the signature<br>
verification unit 15 verifies the signature of the signed electronic<br>
document held in the verification subject holding unit 13, by using the<br>
public key certificate received together with this electronic document.<br>
Here, only in a case where the verification has held good, the signed<br>
electronic document is dealt with as being legal, and it is outputted from<br>
the input/output unit 17 as may be needed.<br>
However, in a case where, in spite of the signature verification<br>
having held good, the public key certificate used for this signature<br>
verification has been issued by any other terminal admitting certification<br>
authority CA than the terminal admitting certification authority CA which<br>
admits the end entity EE of its own (that is, which has issued the public<br>
key certificate to the end entity EE of its own), the signature verification<br>
unit 15 transmits a request for authenticating the validity of the public<br>
key certificate used for the signature verification, to the certificate validity<br>
authentication center VC, On this occasion, if necessary, trustworthiness<br>
(policy) indicating a level of certification and/or assurance for the<br>
certification authority is contained in the authentication request. Thus.<br>
only in a case where the validity of the pertinent public certificate has<br>
been authenticated by the certificate validity authentication center VC tht<br>
signed electronic document is dealt with as being legal, and it is outputted<br><br><br>
from the input/output unit 17 as may be needed. Herein the<br>
trustworthiness is indicated by the amount of business, or the like of the<br>
electronic procedure to be taken by the signed electronic document.<br>
Besides, the trustworthiness may be indicated, for example, by the<br>
confidentiality of a document to be dealt with or the trustworthiness of a<br>
singer of the singed electronic document (such as signer's reporting<br>
himself is necessary, or the processing via a network is acceptable)<br>
Next, the certification authority CA will be explained.<br>
Fig. 4 is a block diagram showing the schematic construction of the<br>
certification authority CA.<br>
As shown in the figure, the certification authority CA includes a<br>
processing unit 20a, a storage unit 20b, a communication unit 26 which<br>
serves to communicate with another device through the network NET,<br>
and an input/output unit 27 which inputs/outputs public key certificates<br>
etc. and which accepts instructions given by users.<br>
The processing unit 20a includes an issue unit 21 which issues<br>
public key certificates, a management unit 22 which manages the public<br>
key certificates issued by the issue unit 21, and a control unit 28 which<br>
collectively controls the various units of the certification authority CA.<br>
The storage unit 20b includes a public key certificate database 2b<br>
which holds therein the public key certificates issued by the issue unit IV<br>
an issue destination management list holding unit 24 which holds theit-in<br>
an issue destination management list describing the issue destinations of<br>
the respective public key certificates held in the public key certificate<br>
database 23, and a certification revocation list holding unit 25.<br>
In such a construction, when the control unit 28 has accepted<br><br>
request for the issue of a public kev certificate through the input/output'<br>
unit 27 or the communication unit 2b, it notifies the acceptance of the<br>
request to the issue unit 21. Then, the issue unit 21 creates a secret kev<br>
(signature key) which a requester for the issue uses for the generation of a<br>
signature, and the public key certificate which pairs with the secret key,<br>
On this occasion, the issue unit 21 signs the public kev certificate by using<br>
the secret key of its own certification authority CA. Besides, if necessary,<br>
the issue unit 21 describes in the public key certificate the validity term of<br>
this public key certificate, the names of other certification authorities<br>
which are not trusted (Name Constraints), the maximum path length<br>
which is allowed for the authentication of the validity of the pertinent<br>
public key certificate (the maximum allowable number of certification<br>
authorities on a path), and the trustworthiness (policy) of a signature<br>
based on the secret key pairing with the pertinent public key certificate as<br>
is expressed by the amount of business- or the like of the electronic<br>
procedure. Thereafter, the created public key certificate and secret key<br>
are delivered to the issue requester by mail or communication through the<br>
input/output unit 27 or the communication unit 26. Also, the pertinent<br>
public key certificate is registered in the public key certificate database 23,<br>
and the information of the issue destination (that is, the issue requester) is<br>
described in the issue destination management list held in the issue<br>
destination management list holding unit 24.<br>
In addition, when the: control unit 28 has accepted a request for the<br>
revocation of a public key certificate through the input/output unit 27 or<br>
the communication unit 26, it notifies the acceptance of the request to the<br>
management unit 22. Then, the management unit 22 deletes the public<br><br><br>
key certificate to-be-revoked from the public key certificate database 23<br>
and simultaneously deletes the information of the issue destination of the<br>
pertinent public key certificate from the issue destination management list<br>
held in the issue destination management list holding unit 24. However,<br>
it is not essential to delete the public key certificate to-be-revoked from<br>
the public key certificate database 23. Further, the management unit 22<br>
periodically creates a certification revocation list (abbreviated to "CRL",<br>
and also called "ARL" short for authority revocation list) in which<br>
information items about public key certificates to-be-revoked are<br>
described, and it causes the CRL holding unit 25 to hold the CRL.<br>
Incidentally, the management unit 22 shall describe the next date and<br>
hour scheduled to create the CRL, in the created CRL.<br>
Yet in addition, when the control unit 28 has received, a query<br>
about the information of the revocation of a public key certificate from<br>
another device through the communicatiun unit 26. it searches the<br>
certification revocation list held in the CRL holding unit 25, to check<br>
whether or not the queried public key certificate has been revoked.<br>
Besides, the control unit 28 notifies the result of the check as a reply to the<br>
other device having queried, through the communication, unit 26 (a<br>
communication protocol which is used for such a query and a reply is the<br>
OCSP short for "Online Certification Status Protocol").<br>
Incidentally, the management unit 22 also executes a process for<br>
examining the validity terms of individual public key certificates stored, in<br>
the public key certificate database 23, so as to delete any public key<br>
certificate whose validity term has expired, from the public key certificate<br>
database 23, and to delete the information of the issue destination of the<br><br>
pertinent public key certificate from the issue destination management list<br>
held in the issue destination management list holding unit 24.<br>
Next, the certificate validity authentication center VC will be<br>
explained.<br>
Fig. 5 is a block diagram showing the schematic construction oi the<br>
certificate validity authentication center VC.<br>
As shown in the figure, the certificate validity authentication<br>
center VC includes a processing unit 30a, a storage unit 30b, a<br>
communication unit 36 which serves to communicate with another device<br>
through the network NET, and an input/output unit 37 which<br>
inputs/outputs public key certificates etc. and which accepts instructions<br>
given by users.<br>
The processing unit 30a includes a path search unit 32, a path<br>
verification unit 33, a validity term/revocation state examination unit 34,<br>
a validity authentication unit 35, and a control unit 38 which collectively<br>
controls the various units of the certificate validity authentication center<br>
VC. On the other hand, the storage unit 30b includes a path database 31,<br>
and a certification revocation list (CRL) creation schedule time database<br>
39.<br>
The path search unit 31 periodically searches for paths which<br>
extend from the bridge certification authority CAbridge. to the individual<br>
terminal admitting certification authorities CA having issued public key<br>
certificates to the end entities EE.<br>
Each time a path has been searched for by the path search unit 31,<br>
the path verification unit 32 verifies the path detected by the path search<br>
unit 31. Besides, the path verification unit 32 registers the path whose<br><br>
verification has held good, in the path database 31 Herein, the path is<br>
registered in association with the name of the terminal admitting<br>
certification authority CA which is located at the dowrunost stream on the<br>
path relative to the upstream bridge certification authority C Abridge, and<br>
with public key certificates obtained from the certification authorities CA<br>
on the path and issued from these certification authorities CA to the<br>
certification authorities CA which are respectively located directly<br>
downstream of them (to the end entities EE in a case where the<br>
certification authorities CA being issue origins are the terminal admitting<br>
certification authorities CA),<br>
The validity term/revocation state examination unit 34 examines<br>
the validity terms and revocation states of the public key certificates as to<br>
each of the paths registered in the path database 31. These public key<br>
certificates are ones having been issued by the certification authorities CA<br>
on the path, to the certification authorities CA which are respectively<br>
located directly downstream of the issue-origin certification authorities<br>
CA on the path (to the end entities EE in the case where the issue-origin<br>
certification authorities CA are the terminal admitting certification<br>
authorities CA). Further, the unit 34 updates the.path database 33 in<br>
accordance with the result of the examination.<br>
In addition, the validity' term/revocation state examination unit- 34<br>
registers the next CRL creation schedule times described in the CRLs<br>
(certification revocation lists) obtained from the CRL holding units 25 of<br>
the respective certification authorities CA, in the CRL creation schedule<br>
time database 39 in association with the pertinent certification authorities<br>
CA.<br><br>
In compliance with a request made by the end entity EE, the<br>
validity authentication unit 35 authenticates the validity of a public key<br>
certificate issued by any terminal admitting certification authority CA<br>
which is other than the terminal admitting certification authority CA<br>
admitting the pertinent end entity EE, for the terminal admitting<br>
certification authority CA admitting this end entity EE.<br>
Incidentally, the end entity EE, certification authority CA and<br>
certificate validity authentication center VC shown in figs. 3-5 can be<br>
respectively realized, for example, in such a way that a CPU 61 runs<br>
predetermined programs loaded in a memory 62 in a general electronic<br>
computer as shown in Fig. 6. More specifically, the electronic computer<br>
includes the CPU 61., the memory 62, an external storage device 63 such as<br>
hard disk, a read device 64 which reads information from a portable<br>
storage medium 69 such as CD-ROM, a communication device 65 which<br>
serves to communicate with another device through the network, an input<br>
device 66 such as keyboard or mouse., an output device 67 such as monitor<br>
or printer, and an interface 68 which exchanges data among the<br>
constituent devices. Thus, the communication units 16, 26 and 36 are<br>
realized in such a way that the CPU 61 utilizes the communication device<br>
65; the input/output units 17, 27 and 37 are done in such a way that the<br>
CPU 61 utilizes the input device 66, output devke 67 and read device f?4;<br>
and the storage units 10b, 20b and 30b are done in such a way that the<br>
CPU 61 utilizes the memory 62 and external storage device 63, Besides,<br>
the processing units 10a, 20a and 30a are realised as processes on the CPU<br>
61.<br>
Such predetermined programs for realizing the end entity EE.<br><br>
certification authority CA and certificate validity authentication center VC<br>
on the electronic computer, respectively, may be read out of the storage<br>
medium 69 through the read device 64 or downloaded from another<br>
server via the network through the communication unit 65 so as to be<br>
loaded into the memory 62 after being once stored in the external storage<br>
device 63 or directly without being stored in the external storage device<br>
63, whereupon they may be run by the CPU 61,<br>
Next, the operation of the certificate validity authentication center<br>
VC of the above construction will be explained<br>
The operation of the certificate validity authentication center VC<br>
in this embodiment is divided into the operation of searching for..<br>
verifying and managing paths, and the operation of authenticating the<br>
validity of a public key certificate.<br>
There will now be explained the operation of searching for,<br>
verifying and managing paths.<br>
Figs. 7 and 8 are flow charts for explaining the operation of<br>
searching for, verifying and managing paths as is executed in the<br>
certificate validity authentication renter VC m this embodiment,<br>
Referring to Fig. 7, when a predetermined time period (for<br>
example, one day) has lapsed (step S1001), the control unit 38 requests the<br>
path search unit 32 to search for paths. Then, the path search unit 32<br>
searches for paths which extend from the bridge certification authority<br>
CAbridge to the individual terminal admitting certification authorities CA<br>
(step S1002).<br>
Concretely, the path search unit 32 dresses the issue destination<br>
management list holding u lit 24 of the budge certification authority<br><br>
CAbridge so as to obtain the information items of the issue destinations of<br>
public key certificates issued by the bridge certification authority CAbridge<br>
Subsequently,, in a case where the issue destinations obtained are the<br>
certification authorities CA, the path search unit 32 accesses the issue<br>
destination management list holding unit 24 of the certification authority<br>
CA of each of the issue destinations so as to further inspect the issue<br>
destinations of public: key certificates issued by each certification<br>
authority CA. Such a process is continued until the issue destinations of<br>
public key certificates become the end entities EE, thereby to search for<br>
the paths which extend from the bridge certification authority CAbridge to<br>
the individual terminal admitting certification authorities CA. Here, in<br>
order to prevent the process from being iterated limitlessly due to the<br>
issue destination management list holding unit 24 of a certain certification<br>
authority CA include any certification authority CA which is located<br>
upstream of a partial path formed before, the process in which the certain<br>
certification authority CA is the issue destination shall not be executed.<br>
The path search process at the step S1002 will be elucidated more<br>
concretely by taking as an example the case where the individual<br>
certification authorities CA are in the relationship shown in Fig. 2.<br>
First, the path search unit 32 rtccesses the issue destination<br>
management list holding unit 24 of the bridge certification authority<br>
CAbridge so as to obtain the information items of the certification<br>
authorities CA11, CA22 and CA31 as the information items of the issue<br>
destinations of public key certificates issued by the bridge certification<br>
authority CAbridge<br><br>
Subsequently, the path search unit 32 executes the following<br>
process by noticing any of the issue destinations (certification authorities<br>
CA11, CA21 and CA31) obtained from the bridge certification authority<br>
If the noticed issue destination is the certification authority CA<br>
(hereinbelow, called "noticed certification authority CA"), the path search<br>
unit 32 sets a partial path with the bridge certification authority CAbridge<br>
located upstream, along the bridge certification authority CAbridge - the<br>
noticed certification authority CA. Subsequently,, the path search unit 32<br>
accesses the issue destination management list holding unit 24 of the<br>
noticed certification authority CA so as to further obtain the information<br>
items of the issue destinations of public key certificates issued by this<br>
noticed certification authority CA. It is assumed here thai the noticed<br>
issue destination is the certification authority CA11, so the partial path is<br>
set along the bridge certification authority CAbridge - the certification<br>
authority CA11, and that the information items of the certification<br>
authorities CAbridge, CA12 and CA13 are obtained as the information items<br>
of the issue destinations from the certification authority CA12,<br>
Subsequently, the path search unit 32 checks whether or not any<br>
certification authority CA on the partial path (hereinbelow, called "loop<br>
certification authority CA") is included among the issue destinations<br>
(CAbridge, CA12 and CA13.) obtained from the certification authority CA11.<br>
In a case where any issue destination (certification authority CA) is<br>
included, it is excluded from subjects to-be-handled. Accordingly, the<br>
certification authority CAbridge is excluded trorn the subjects to-be-handled<br>
here. Subsequently, the path search unit 32 checks whether or not any<br><br>
end entity EE is included among the issue destinations obtained from the<br>
certification authority CA11. In a case wnere the end entity EE is<br>
included/ the certification authority CA11 becomes the terminal admitting<br>
certification authority. Here, however, the end entity EE is not included<br>
among the issue destinations obtained from the certification authority<br>
CA11. Accordingly, the path search unit 32 notices either of the issue<br>
destinations except the loop certification authority CA as, obtained from<br>
the certification authority CAn (that is, the certification authorities CA12<br>
and CA11), in order to stretch up to the terminal admitting certification<br>
authority CA the partial path which has been set along the bridge<br>
certification authority CAbridge - the certification authority CA11.<br>
If the noticed issue destination is anv certification authority CA,<br>
the path search unit 32 sets a partial path connecting this noticed<br>
certification authority CA, downstream oi the partial path set before.<br>
Subsequently., the path search unit 32 accesses the issue destination<br>
management list holding unit 24 of the noticed certification authority CA<br>
so as to further obtain the information items of the issue destinations of<br>
public key certificates issued by the pertinent noticed certification<br>
authority CA, It is assumed here that the noticed issue destination<br>
(certification authority CA) is the certification authority CA12, so the<br>
partial path is set along the bridge certification authority CAbridge- the<br>
certification authority CA11 - certification authority CA12, and that the end<br>
entities EE1 and EE2 are obtained as the information items of the issue<br>
destinations from the certification authority CA11.<br>
Subsequently, the path search unit 32 checks whether or not any<br>
loop certification authority CA is included among the issue destinations<br><br>
(EE1 and EE2) obtained from the certification authority CA11. In a case<br>
where any issue destination (loop certification authority CA.) is included,<br>
it is excluded from subjects to-be-handled, Since any loop certification<br>
authority CA is not included here, the path search unit 32 shifts to the<br>
next process and checks whether or not any end entity EE is included<br>
among the issue destinations obtained from the terminal admitting<br>
certification authority CA12. Here, all the obtained issue destinations are<br>
the end entities EE, so that the certification authority CA12 is the terminal<br>
admitting certification authority. Therefore, the path search unit 32<br>
detects the partial path on which the certification authority CAu is located<br>
at the downmost stream, as the path which extends from the bridge<br>
certification authority CAbridge to the terminal admitting certification<br>
authority CA12 (CAbridge - CA11 - CA12).<br>
Subsequently, the path search unit 32 checks whether or not any<br>
issue destination (certification authority CA other than the Scop<br>
certification authority CA) which is not noticed yet is existent among the<br>
information items of the issue destinations obtained from the certification<br>
authority CA12 which is located at the downmost stream on the detected<br>
path. In the existence of such an issue destination, the unit 32 continues<br>
the above process with this issue destination as the noticed certification<br>
authority CA. On the other hand, in the nonexistence of such an issue<br>
destination, the unit 32 checks whether or not any issue destination<br>
(certification authority CA other than the loop certification authority (A)<br>
which is not noticed yet is existent among the information items of the<br>
issue destinations obtained from the certification, authority CA11 which, is<br>
located directly upstream. Further, in the existence of such an issue<br><br><br>
destination, the unit 32 continues the above process with this issue<br>
destination as the noticed certification authority CA. Here, the<br>
certification authority CA13 is not noticed yet among the information<br>
items of the issue destinations obtained from the certification authority<br>
CA11, so that the unit 32 executes the above process with the certification<br>
authority CA13 as the noticed certification authority CA. thereby to detect<br>
the path which extends from the bridge certification authority CAimdge to<br>
the terminal admitting certification authority CA13 (CAbridge - CA11 - CA13).<br>
In this manner, the path search unit 32 continues the above process<br>
as to each of all the certification authorities CA located on the detected<br>
path, until any issue destination (certification authority CA other than the<br>
loop certification authority CA) not noticed yet becomes nonexistent<br>
among the information items of the issue destinations obtained from the<br>
pertinent certification authority CA, Thus, the unit 32 detects the paths<br>
which extend from the bridge certification authority CAbridge to the<br>
respective terminal admitting certification authorities CA. As a result in<br>
the case where the individual certification authorities CA are in the<br>
relationship shown in Fig. 2, those paths from the bridge certification<br>
authority CAbridge to the respective terminal admitting certification<br>
authorities CA which are detected by the path search unit 32 become as<br>
shown in Fig. 9.<br>
Meanwhile, when the paths extending from the bridge certification<br>
authority CAbridge to the respective terminal admitting certification<br>
authorities CA have been detected by the path search unit 32, the control<br>
unit 38 of the certificate validity authentkdtion center VC requests the<br>
path verification unit 33 to verify the paths, lhen. the path verification<br><br>
unit 33 verities the paths detected by the path search unit 32 (step S1003).<br>
Concretely/ the path verification unit 33 executes the following<br>
process as to each of the paths detected by the path search unit 32.<br>
First, the path verification unit 33 accesses the public key<br>
certificate databases 23 of the individual certification authorities CA on<br>
each path so as to obtain public key certificates which these certification<br>
authorities CA have issued to the certification authorities CA to the<br>
certification authorities CA respectively located directly downstream on<br>
the pertinent path (to the end entities EE in a case where the<br>
access-destination certification authorities CA are the terminal admitting<br>
certification authorities CA).<br>
Subsequently, the path verification unit 33 verifies the signature of<br>
the public key certificate issued by the terminal admitting certification<br>
authority CA located at the downmost stream on the path, in the light of<br>
the public key certificate issued by the certification authority CA located<br>
directly upstream. In a case where the verification has held good, the<br>
unit 33 verifies the signature of the public key certificate issued by the<br>
pertinent certification authority CA located directly upstream, in the light<br>
of the public key certificate issued by the certification authority CA<br>
located directly upstream still further. Such a process is continued until<br>
the pertinent certification authority CA located diiectly upstream becomes<br>
the bridge certification authoritv CAbridge, thereby to tentatively verify the<br>
pertinent path.<br>
By way of example, in case of tentatively verifying the path which<br>
extends from the bridge certification authontj CAbnd^e to the terminal<br>
admitting certification authority CA13(CAbridge - CA11 - CA13) in Fig. 2 the<br><br><br>
signature of the public Key certificate issued by the terminal admitting<br>
certification authority CA13 is first verified using the public key certificate<br>
which the root certification authority CA11 being the certification<br>
authority CA located directly upstream ot the terminal admitting<br>
certification authority CA13 has issued to this terminal admitting<br>
certification authority CA13. Subsequently, in a case where the<br>
verification has held good, the signature cf the public key certificate<br>
issued bv the root certification authority CA11 is verified using the public<br>
key certificate which the bridge certification authority CAbridge being the<br>
certification authority CA located directly upstream of the root<br>
certification authority CA11 has issued to this root certification authority<br>
CA11. Besides, in a case where the verification has held good, the<br>
tentative verification of the path which extends from the bridge<br>
certification authority CAbridge to the terminal admitting certification<br>
authority CA13 shall have held good.<br>
Next, when the tentative verification el the path has held good, the<br>
path verification unit 33 checks whether or not the description of a<br>
constraint, such as the names of other certification authorities which are<br>
not trusted (Name Constraints) or the maximum path length which is<br>
allowed for the authentication of the validity of any public key certificate<br>
(the maximum allowable number of certification authorities on the path),<br>
is existent in the public key certificates obtained from the respective<br>
certification authorities CA on the pertinent path. In the existence of<br>
such a description, the unit 33 checks whether or not the pertinent path<br>
observes the constraint, and it decides that the verification of the<br>
pertinent path has held good, only uhtn the constraint is observed.<br><br>
By way of example, in a case whery the tentative verification of a<br>
path extending from the bridge certification authority CAbridge to a<br>
terminal admitting certification authority CA20 (CAbridge - CA31 - CA21 -<br>
CA22 - CA25 - CA26) in Fig. 2 has held good, the verification of the path<br>
shall not have held good when the certification authority CA32 is<br>
described as the name of another certification authority not trusted, in a<br>
public key certificate obtained from the certification authority CA20.<br>
Also, in the above case, the verification of the path shall not have held<br>
good when the number of certification authorities =5 is described as a<br>
path length in the public key certificate obtained from the certification<br>
authority CA26.<br>
When the respective paths detected by the path search unit 32<br>
have been verified by the path verification unit 33 as stated above, the<br>
control unit 38 once clears the registered contents of the path database 31<br>
and thereafter registers the respective paths whose verifications have held<br>
good in the path verification unit 33, in the path database 31 in association<br>
with the terminal admitting certification authorities CA located at the<br>
downmost streams on the corresponding paths and with the public key<br>
certificates obtained from the certification authorities CA located on these<br>
paths (step S1004).<br>
On the other hand, the validity term revocation state examination<br>
unit 34 checks whether or not any publk key certificate whose validity<br>
term has expired is existent among the public key certificates registered in<br>
the path database 31 (step S1005). In the existence of the validity<br>
term-expired public key certificate, the pubac key certificate database 23<br>
of the issue-origin certification authority CA cf the pertinent public key<br><br>
certificate is accessed so as to search for a public key certificate which has<br>
been issued to the issue destination of the pertinent public key certificate<br>
anew (step S1006).<br>
Besides, if such a new public key certificate is not existent in the<br>
public key certificate database 23 of the issue-origin certification authority<br>
CA, information about the path registered in association with the validity<br>
term-expired public key certificate is deleted from the path database 31<br>
(step S1007). On the other hand, if such a new public key certificate is<br>
existent in the public key certificate database 23 of the issue-origin<br>
certification authority CA, it is obtained. Further, the verification of the<br>
path registered in the path database 31 in association with the validity<br>
term-expired public key certificate is executed in accordance with the<br>
same purport as at the step S1003 by using the public key certificate which<br>
has been obtained anew instead of the validity term-expired public key<br>
certificate (step S1008).<br>
Incidentally, the path verification at the step S1008 may well be<br>
replaced with an expedient in which the signature of the public key<br>
certificate obtained anew is verified in the light of a public key certificate<br>
issued by the certification authority CA located directly upstream of the<br>
issue-origin certification authority CA of this public key certificate on the<br>
pertinent path, and in which the verification of- the pertinent path is<br>
regarded as having held good when the verification of the signature has<br>
held good.<br>
Referring to Fig. 8, in a case where the verification of the path has<br>
held good ("Yes" at a step S1039),. the validity term-expired public key<br>
certificate registered in the path database 31 in association with the<br><br>
pertinent path is substituted by the public key certificate obtained a new<br>
(step S1010). On the other hand, in a case where the verification of the<br>
path has not held good ("No" at the step S1009), the path registered in<br>
association with the validity term-expired public key certificate is deleted<br>
from the path database 3] (step S1011).<br>
Subsequently, the validity term/revocation state examination unit<br>
34 examines the certification revocation list (CRL) creation schedule time<br>
database 39 so as to search for any certification authority CA associated<br>
with a CRL creation schedule time which has already lapsed (step S1012).<br>
In the existence of such a certification authority CA ("Yes" at a step S1013),<br>
the CRL holding unit 25 of the pertinent certification authority CA is<br>
accessed so as to obtain the newest CRL issued by this certification<br>
authority CA (step S1014). Besides, the CRL creation schedule time<br>
registered in association with the pertinent certification authority CA is<br>
updated to a CRL creation schedule time described in the newest CRL<br>
obtained, in the CRL creation schedule time database 39 (step S1015).<br>
Thereafter,, the validity term/revocation state examination unit 34<br>
checks whether or not any public key certificate described in the newest<br>
CRL obtained is registered in the path database 31 (step S1016). In a case<br>
where the public key certificate is registered, information about any path<br>
associated with this public key certificate is deleted from the path<br>
database 31 (step S1017).<br>
There will now be explained the operation of authenticating the<br>
validity of d public key certificate.<br>
Figs. 10 and 11 are flow charts fur explaining the operation of<br>
authenticating the validity of a public key certificate as is executed in the<br><br>
certificate validity authentication center VC in this embodiment.<br>
Referring to these figures, when the control unit 38 has received a<br>
request for the authentication of the validity of a public key certificate,<br>
which contains a name of a terminal admitting certification authority CA<br>
admitting a certain end entity EE and which has been issued by any<br>
terminal admitting certification authority CA other than the above<br>
terminal admitting certification authority CA, from the end entity EE<br>
through the communication unit 36 (step S2001), it notifies the reception<br>
of the request to the validity authentication unit 35, Incidentally, when<br>
the name of the terminal admitting certification authority CA is not<br>
contained in the authentication request for the validity of the public key<br>
certificate, a default certification authority CA preset in the certificate<br>
validity authentication center VC is set as a terminal admitting<br>
certification authority CA admitting the end entity EE. Then, if the<br>
terminal admitting authority CA having issued the public key certificate<br>
whose validity is to be authenticated, is other than the above set terminal<br>
admitting certification authority CA, the validity authentication unit 35 is<br>
notified as such.<br>
Then, the validity authentication unit 35 checks whether or not a<br>
path associated with the terminal admitting certification authority CA<br>
having issued the public key certificate as is specified from the<br>
description of the pertinent certificate being a subject for the request and<br>
a path associated with the terminal admitting certification authority CA<br>
which admits the end entity EE being a requester, are registered in the<br>
path database 31 (step S20U2).<br>
If, as a result, it has been found that both the path associated with<br><br>
the terminal admitting certification authority CA which has issued the<br>
subject public key certificate, and the path associated with the terminal<br>
admitting certification authority CA which admits the requester end<br>
entity EE, are not registered in the path database 31, the validity<br>
authentication unit 35 notifies it to the requester end entity EE through<br>
the communication unit 36 that the subject public key certificate is not<br>
valid (step S2003).<br>
On the other hand, if it has been successfully authenticated that<br>
both the path associated with the terminal admitting certification<br>
authority CA which has issued the subject public key certificate, and the<br>
path associated with the terminal admitting certification authority CA<br>
which admits the requester end entity EE, are registered in the path<br>
database 31, the validity authentication unit 35 further cheeks whether or<br>
not the description of a constraint such as the names of other certification<br>
authorities which are not trusted (Name Constraints) or the maximum<br>
path length which is allowed for the authentication of the validity of any<br>
public key certificate (the maximum allowable number of certification<br>
authorities on the path), is existent in the public key certificates registered<br>
in the path database 31 in association with either of the two paths (step<br>
S2004).<br>
In the nonexistence of the description of such a constraint the<br>
validity authentication unit 35 shifts to a step S2006. On the other hand,<br>
in the existence of the description of such a constraint,, the validity<br>
authentication unit 35 shifts to a. step S2005, and it checks whether or not<br>
the two paths observe the constraint, in other words, whether or not it is<br>
described in the public key certificates that any certification authority on<br><br>
the two paths is not trusted, or whether or not the number of certification<br>
authorities smaller than the number of certification authorities located on<br>
each of the two paths is described as the maximum path length.<br>
Here, in the existence of such a description, the validity<br>
authentication unit 35 judges the two paths as failing to observe the<br>
constraint and notifies it to the requester end entity EE through the<br>
communication unit 36 that the public key certificate is not valid (step<br>
S2003). On the other hand, in the nonexistence of such a description, the<br>
validity authentication unit 35 judges the two paths as observing the<br>
constraint, and it shifts to the step S2006.<br>
At the step S2006, the validity authentication unit 35 checks<br>
whether or not trustworthiness (policy) which is indicated by the amount<br>
of business, or the like of the electronic procedure to be taken by the end<br>
entity EE is contained in the authentication request received from the<br>
pertinent end entity EE. In a case where the trustworthiness of the<br>
electronic procedure is contained, the unit 35 further checks whether or<br>
not the description of trustworthiness which does not satisfy the above<br>
trustworthiness of the above electronic procedure is existent in the public<br>
key certificates which are registered in the path database 31 in association<br>
with either of the two paths (step S2007).<br>
Here, in the existence of such a description, the validity<br>
authentication unit 35 judges the two paths as fail ing to be utilized for the<br>
authentication of the validity of the public kev certificate for the electronic<br>
procedure to be taken by the requester end entity EE, and this unit<br>
notifies it to the requester end entity EE through the communication unit<br>
36 that the public key certificate is not valid (step S2003).<br><br>
On the other hand, in a case where the trustworthiness of the<br>
electronic procedure to be taken by the end entity EE is not contained in<br>
the authentication request received from the pertinent end entity EE, or in<br>
a case where the trustworthiness of the electronic procedure is contained,<br>
but where trustworthiness described in the public key certificates which<br>
are registered in the path database 31 in association with either of the two<br>
paths is equal to or higher than that of the electronic procedure,, the<br>
validity authentication unit 35 judges the public key certificate as being<br>
valid and notifies it to the requester end entity EE through the<br>
communication unit 36 that the public key certificate is valid {step S2008).<br>
Thus far, one embodiment of the present invention has been<br>
described.<br>
In this embodiment, paths which extend from the bridge<br>
certification authority CAbridge to the respective terminal admitting<br>
certification authorities CA are periodically searched for and verified<br>
independently of the request of any end entity EE for authenticating the<br>
validity of a public key certificate. Besides, in a case where the request<br>
for authenticating the validity of a public key certificate has been received<br>
from a certain end entity EE, whether or not the public key certificate is<br>
valid is judged by checking with the paths searched foi and verified<br>
beforehand whether ot not a path through the bridge certification<br>
authority CAbncge can be established between the terminal admitting<br>
certification authority CA which admits the pertinent end entity EE and<br>
the terminal admitting certification authority CA which has issued thf<br>
public key certificate being a subject for the request, it is accordingly<br>
possible to shorten a time period which is expanded since the reception oi<br><br>
the request for the authentication of the validity of the public key<br>
certificate till the authentication of the validity.<br>
Besides, in this embodiment in a case where the request for<br>
authenticating the validity of a public key certificate has been received<br>
from a certain end entity EE, whether or not a path through the bridge<br>
certification authority CAbridge can be established between the terminal<br>
admitting certification authority CA which admits the pertinent end entity<br>
EE and the terminal admitting certification authority CA which has issued<br>
the public key certificate being a subject for the request is checked with<br>
the paths searched for and verified beforehand, and subject to the<br>
establishment of the path, whether or not the subject public key certificate<br>
is valid is finally judged in consideration of a constraint (such as the<br>
names of other certification authorities which are not trusted (Name<br>
Constraints), the maximum path length (the maximum allowable number<br>
of certification authorities on the path), or trustworthiness (policy)) which<br>
is described in any public key certificate issued by any certification<br>
authority on the path. It is accordingly possible to more precisely judge<br>
the validity of the subject public key certificate.<br>
Incidentally, the present invention is not restricted to the<br>
foregoing embodiment, but it can have various modifications within the<br>
scope of the purport thereof.<br>
By way of example, in the foregoing embodiment, the certificate<br>
validity authentication center VC sets the bridge certification authority<br>
CAbridge as a start certification authority, and it searches for and verifies<br>
paths which extend from the bridge certification authority CAbridge to the<br>
individual terminal admitting certification authorities CA. The present<br><br><br>
invention, however, is not restricted to such an aspect. Any other<br>
certification authority CA can also be set as a start certification authority<br>
so as to search for and verify paths extending therefrom to the individual<br>
terminal admitting certification authorities CA. As a concrete example,<br>
in the case where the certification authorities CA are in the relationship<br>
shown in Fig, 2, any of the root certification authorities CA11, CA21 and<br>
CA31 of the respective security domains SD may well be set as a start<br>
certification authority so as to search for and verify paths extending<br>
therefrom to the individual terminal admitting certification authorities<br>
CA.<br>
Besides,, in the foregoing embodiment it is assumed for the brevity<br>
of description that, as shown in Fig. 2, the terminal admitting certification<br>
authorities CA issue public key certificates to the end entities EE only.,<br>
while the other certification authorities CA issue public key certificates to<br>
the certification authorities CA only. As a matter of course, however, the<br>
present invention is similarly applicable also to a case where a PKI system<br>
includes a certification authority CA which issues public key certificates<br>
to both the end entity EE and the certification authority CA.<br>
Further, in the foregoing embodiment as the construction of the<br>
certification authority CA, it is explained that the cross-certification is<br>
performed among the root certification authorities of the individual<br>
security domains. It is not limited to the root certification authorities,<br>
but other certification authorities may perform the cross-certification.<br>
As described above, according to the present invention, it is<br>
permitted to shorten a time period which is expended since a request for<br>
the authentication of the validity of a public key certificate till the<br><br><br>
authentication of the validity.<br><br>

periodically searches for and verifies paths which extend from a bridge<br>
certification authority CAbridge to individual terminal admitting certification<br>
authorities CA, and it registers the paths whose verifications have held good, in a<br>
path database in association with the respective terminal admitting certification<br>
authorities CA. Besides, in a case where the request for the authentication of the<br>
validity of a certificate has been made by an end entity EE, whether or not a<br>
path associated with the terminal admitting certification authority CA which<br>
admits the end entity, and a path associated with the terminal admitting<br>
certification authority CA which has issued the certificate being a subject for the<br>
request are registered in the path database is checked, and the subject<br>
certificate is judged valid only when both the paths are registered.</td>
