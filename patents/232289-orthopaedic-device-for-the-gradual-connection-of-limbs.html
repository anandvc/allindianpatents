				<td>Orthopaedic Device For The Gradual Correction Of Limbs Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an orthopaedic device for the gradual correction of limbs, in accordance with the preamble of the claim 1. Background Art<br>
It is known that external fixation devices, adjustable in length and angular attitude, are commonly utilised for correcting certain angular and longitudinal deformations of long bones of limbs. Such fixation devices essentially comprise clamps which hold groups of bone screws inserted in the portions of the bone affected by defects, such clamps being slidably mounted on elements or guides longitudinally positionable externally to the limb to be treated.<br>
The correction is normally carried out gradually with the aid of compressor-distractor devices which act on the mobile clamps while the bone callous regenerates itself permitting its manipulation until the desired correction is obtained.<br>
One known device for the gradual correction of the limbs has a lateral clamp which allows an angular correction of the bone. Such known device has the drawback that the angular rotation induces a shifting of the screws in a transverse direction which renders the correction of the limb difficult. Disclosure of the Invention<br>
One principal aim of the present invention is to overcome the above described drawbacks providing an orthopaedic device which allows a complete correction in geometric planes which are also inclined with respect to the lateral and front-rear planes, in a gradual and easily controllable manner.<br>
With this principal aim and others in view, there is provided an orthopaedic device for the gradual correction of angular and longitudinal defects of elongated bones, comprising at least one first clamp for a first group of screws insertable in a proximal portion of a bone, and at least one second clamp for a second group of screws insertable in a distal portion of the bone, a longitudinal guide bar positioned externally of the limb to be corrected for slidably supporting said first and second clamps in longitudinally distanced positions, at least one of said clamps being selectively orientatable about a substantially transverse axis for carrying out angular corrections of the bone, there being provided compression/distraction means movably coupleable with said clamps for carrying out longitudinal corrections of the bone, characterised by the fact that said at least one orientatable clamp has angular adjustment means in a predetermined geometric plane, as well as transverse adjustment means for the group of bone screws carried by said clamp parallel to themselves for compensating the lateral movement induced by the angular correction.

Fig. 14 illustrates a lateral section view of the detail of Fig. 13. Best Modes for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
With reference to the cited figures, an orthopaedic device according to a preferred aspect of the invention, globally indicated by the reference numeral 1, for the gradual correction of angular and longitudinal defects of elongated bones, for example a femur F, essentially comprises a longitudinal guide bar 2 of generally semicircular cross section positioned externally to the limb to be corrected, upon which a first clamp 3 for a first group of screws 4 insertable in a proximal portion of the bone and a second clamp 5 for a second group of screws 6 insertable in a distal portion of the bone are mounted.<br>
The proximal clamp 3 comprises an attachment portion 7 movably anchorable to the bar 2, for example by means of a dovetail tenon 8 coupleable to a longitudinal cavity of the bar 2 and a blocking screw 9, upon which is mounted a bracket 10 rotatable about a first substantially longitudinal axis 11.<br>
An intermediate body 12 is hinged to the bracket 10 by means of a substantially transversal axis 13 for correcting the angular defects, and is micrometrically adjustable by means of a screw 14 having an end 15 hinged to the body 12, the opposite end 16 being provided with a hexagonal fitting and the central portion being engaged in a pivot member 17 united to the bracket 10.<br>
A substantially L-shaped support 18 is rotatably mounted on the intermediate body 12 about a substantially longitudinal second axis 19.<br>
The support 18 has two transverse spines 20 which guide a jaw 21 of the clamp and a micrometric screw adjustment mechanism 22 for promoting the controlled translation of the jaw 21 so as to compensate the lateral movements induced by the angular corrections. Fixed on the jaw 21 by means of screws is a jaw 21' of a per se known type.<br>
Expediently, there are provided stop screws 23, 24 for blocking the respective axes 11 and 19 so as to define a predetermined geometric plane for the angular correction.<br>
The device of Fig. 1 is shown in Fig. 4 but active in a front-rear plane.<br>
The second clamp 5, which is normally positioned in a distal or medial position, is of the swivelling type and is formed by a support plate 25 anchorable to the bar 2, upon which is hinged about a substantially longitudinal axis 26 a first jaw 27 of the clamp. A second jaw 28 is locked on the first jaw 26 by means of locking screws 29. Both the jaws have transverse seats of a per se known shape for accommodating the screws 6.<br>
The support plate 25 has means for connection to the bar which may be constituted by a dovetail tenon 30 engageable, before the mounting of the other clamp, in a countershaped cavity formed along the bar, and by a stop screw 31 passing through a longitudinal groove of the bar.<br>
In the alternative embodiment illustrated in the Figures 10 to 12, the connection means of the plate 25 to the bar 2 are constituted by a connecting block 32 anchored to the bar 2 by means of screws 33, 34 of which one serves to anchor the block allowing it to slide along the groove, while the other serves to block the longitudinal movement of the clamp.<br>
The plate has two end supports 35, 36 one of which has an arcuate eyelet hole 37 in which there passes a screw 38 with a hexagonal fitting 39 and also with radial holes 39' for its screwing in case of limited space for the surgeon.<br>
Thanks to its possibility of being able to swivel, the clamp 5 may be inclined allowing for the screws to be screwed into the bone also in case of notable curvature of the same, without having to move the clamp excessively towards the end of the bar.<br>
Another clamp, referenced by 40, is of an oscillating type, and is constituted by a base 41 anchorable to the bar 2 by means of a screw 42 and having a substantially flat external surface 43.<br>
A cover 44 is oscillatingly mounted on the flat base 41 about an axis 45 substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the bar.<br>
To the cover 44 there is fixed by means of a screw 46 a bracket 47 to whose end is hinged an internally threaded ring 48 in which is engaged a screw 49 having an end held axially by a sleeve 50 with a pin insertable in a hole<br>
provided in the base 25. The screw 49 has both ends with hexagonal set heads in order to allow to control it from both sides.<br>
For blocking the base 41 in the pre-established angular position, there is provided a stop 52 anchored to the base 41 by means of a screw 53 and having a cuneiform end which engages against the bottom of a circular cavity 54 with a bottom substantially countershaped with respect to the stop 52, formed on the external face of said cover. In such a manner it is possible to exert notable blocking forces rendering the orientation of the clamp more reliable and secure.<br>
The cover 44 has on its internal face which faces the base 41 five transverse seats 55 for the bone screws, with transverse cross section of greater value than the maximum diameter of the screws and with a V-shaped bottom for permitting the sliding of the screws 56 parallel to themselves in case of loosening of the cover 44.<br>
Obviously, all of the clamps have holes for the insertion of controlling ends of compressors/distractors in order to carry out an elongation of the bones.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
