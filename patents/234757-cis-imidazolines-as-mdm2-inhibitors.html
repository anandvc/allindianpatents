CIS-IMIDAZOLINES AS MDM2 INHIBITORS<br>
This invention is related to at least one compound selected from a compound of formula I<br>
and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters thereof, wherein Xi, X2, R1 and R2 are described within this application. This compound is believed to inhibit the interaction of MDM2 protein with a p53-like peptide and have antiproliferative activity<br>
p53 is a tumor suppresser protein that plays a central role in protection against development of cancer. It guards cellular integrity and prevents the propagation of permanently damaged clones of cells by the induction of growth arrest or apoptosis. At the molecular level, p53 is a transcription factor that can activate a panel of genes implicated in the regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis. p53 is a potent cell cycle inhibitor which is tightly regulated by MDM2 at the cellular level. MDM2 and p53 form a feedback control loop. MDM2 can bind p53 and inhibit its ability to transactivate p53-regulated genes. In addition, MDM2 mediates the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of p53. p53 can activate the expression of the MDM2 gene, thus raising the cellular level of MDM2 protein. This feedback control loop insures that both MDM2 and p53 are kept at a low level in normal proliferating cells. MDM2 is also a cofactor for E2F, which plays a central role in cell cycle regulation.<br>
The ratio of MDM2 to p53 (E2F) is dysregulated in many cancers. Frequently occurring molecular defects in the p 16INK4/p 19ARF locus, for instance, have been shown to affect MDM2 protein degradation. Inhibition of MDM2-p53 interaction in tumor cells with wild-type p53 should lead to accumulation of p53, cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. MDM2 antagonists, therefore, can offer a novel approach to cancer therapy as single agents or in combination with a broad spectrum of other antitumor therapies. The feasibility of this strategy has been shown by the use of different macromolecular tools for inhibition of MDM2-p53 interaction (e.g. antibodies, antisense<br>
FS/13.04.2004<br><br>
oligonucleotides, peptides). MDM2 also binds E2F through a conserved binding region as p53 and activates E2F-dependent transcription of cyclin A, suggesting that MDM2 antagonists might have effects in p53 mutant cells.<br>

The compounds of the present invention can be prepared according to the folio-wing schemes. The following definitions are provided as applicable to the synthesis schemes:<br><br>
the compounds of formula I can be prepared according to the scheme 1. Scheme 1<br><br>
Many benzonitriles of formula II are commercially available. They are converted to the imidate salts (III) using HCl gas in ethanol. The rate of the reaction depends on the substituents on the phenyl ring. In cases where Xi or X2 H, it may be necessary to run the reaction under pressure of HCl over a longer period of time. Condensation of the imidates (III) with the 1,2-diamines (IV) is carried out in ethanol at 40-100 °C in the presence or absence of a base such as triethylamine.<br>
If it is desired to prepare the compounds of formula II which are not commercially available, many synthetic methods known in the art can be employed. Suitable processes for synthesizing these benzonitriles are provided in the examples. Following schemes illustrate some of these methods.<br>
A compound of formula B (V'1 can be any suitable group such ais V\ V1, V , V , or V1) can be prepared by alkylation of a compound of formula A with V X (X = CI, Br, I) using conventional methods (scheme V). The phenoxide anion is generated by a base such as cesium carbonate or potassium carbonate. The reaction typically is carried out in refluxing acetone. V can also be introduced using Mitsunobu reaction (see for example, Hughes, D. L. Org. React. 1992, 42, 335-656).<br><br><br><br>
A compound of formula C (V"1 can be any suitable group such as V', V1 V1, V', or       can be converted into the benzonitrile D using literature procedures (Karmarkar, S. N; Kelkar, S. L.; Wadia, M. S. Synthesis 1985, 510-512; Bergeron, R. J. et al. J. Med. Chem. 1999, 42, 95-108). V group can then be introduced using V1X (X = CI, Br, I) or Mitsunobu reaction to give the benzonitrile 13 (scheme lb).<br>
S <br>
A compound of formula F can be prepared by bromination or iodination of phenol E (Scheme VII), (V'1 can be any suitable group such as V', V1 V1 V\ or V1). Reaction conditions such as A'-bromosuccinamide/tetrahydrofuran or iodine/thallium(I) acetate can be utilized (see for example, Carreno, M. C; Garcia Ruano, J. L.; Sanz, G.; Toledo, M. A.; Urbano, A. Synlett 1997, 1241-1242; Cambie, R. C; Rutledge, P. S.; Smith-Palmer, T.; Woodgate, P. D. J. Chem. Soc, Perkin Trans. 1 1976,1161-4). V1 group can then be introduced using V1X (X = CI, Br, I) or Mitsunobu reaction. Methods of converting aromatic halides to the corresponding nitriles are known in the art (see for example, Okano, T.; Iwahara, M.; Kiji, J., Synlett 1998, 243). Cyanation of the halide (X' = Br, I) can be accomplished using zinc cyanide with a catalyst such as tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium (0). Solvents such dimethylformamide can be used and the reaction temperature is between        80-1 IOC.<br><br><br>
In scheme ID, amination of aromatic halide G using HNVV1and palladium catalyst can be utilized to provide the benzonitrile of formula H (see for example, Harris, M. C; Geis, O.; Buchwald, S. L. J. Org. Chem. 1999, 64, 6019).<br>
Scheme Id<br><br>
A compound of formula D (V^1can be any suitable group such as V , V , V , V , or V^) can be prepared by nucleophilic substitution of 2-halobenzonitrile I (scheme le). (see for example, X = F: Wells, K. M.; Shi, Y.-J.; Lynch, J. E.; Humphrey, G. R.; Volante, R. P.; Reider, P. J. Tetrahedron Lett. 1996,37, 6439-6442; X = N02: Harrison, C. R.; Lett, R. M.; McCann, S. F.; Shapiro, R.; Stevenson, T. M. WO 92/03421,1992).<br>
Scheme le<br><br>
To prepare the benzonitrile of formula L wherein V', V1V1V\ or V1= OV , sequential alkylation of the diol 19 with suitable V^X (X = CI, Br, I) are used. The bromides K are then converted to the nitriles L using zinc cyanide and Pd(0) catalyst (scheme If).<br><br><br>
Scheme If<br><br>
The 1,2-diamines of formula IV are prepared using procedures as reported by ^    Shatzmiller, S.; Bercovici, S. LiebigsAnn. Chem. 1992, 1005-1009 (Scheme 2). The ketone VI is converted to the corresponding oxime ether. a-Bromination of the oxime ether with N-bromosuccinimide and reaction of the a-bromo oxime ether with ammonia in methanol gives the a-amino oxime ether VII. Reduction of VII with lithium aluminum hydride gives a mixture of cis and trans 1,2-diamine (-4-6:1 ratio of h    cisitrans). The crude 1,2-diamine is then reacted with compound of formula III to give a mixture of cis and trans products. The desired compound (formula V) can be isolated from the mixture by preparative chromatography techniques.<br><br>
When R2 = CORn, the compoiond V is converted to the compound of formula VIII using a compound of formula CICORn (a known compound or a compound prepared by known methods) in the presence of a base such triethylamine (Scheme 3).<br>

Scheme 3<br><br>
When R2 = CONR12R13, the compound of fonnula V is reacted with phosgene at 0 °C in the presence of a base such as triethylamine followed by the treatment of a compound of formula NHR12R13 (a known compound or a compound prepared by known methods) to give the compound of formula IX (Scheme 4).<br>

The reaction mixture was then poured into -1000 mL of ice water (1:1 ratio of ice and water). The product was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 x 200 mL). The organic extracts were washed with sodium bicarbonate solution until the aqueous layer had pH ~8. The organic layers were then dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and concentrated in vacuo to afford 2-hydroxy-4-methoxy-benzonitrile as a yellow oil (16.5 g, 86%).

Example 60 In Vitro Activity Assay<br>
The ability of the compounds to inhibit the interaction between p53 and MDM2 proteins was measured by an ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay) in which recombinant GST-tagged MDM2 binds to a peptide that resembles the MDM2-interacting region of p53 (Bottger et al., J. Mol. Bio. 1997, Vol. 269, pgs. 744-756). This peptide was immobilized to the surface of a 96 well plate via N-terminal biotin which binds to streptavidin-coated wells. MDM2 was added to each well in the presence of anti-MDM2 mouse monoclonal antibody (SMP-14, Santa Cruz Biotech). After removal of the unbound MDM2 protein, a peroxydase-linked secondary antibody (anti-mouse IgG, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and the amount of peptide-bound MDM2 was determined colorimetrically by the addition of a peroxydase substrate (MTB Microwell Peroxydase Substrate System, Kirkegaard &amp; Perry Labs).<br>
Test plates were prepared by coating with streptavidin (5 mg/ml in PBS) for 2 hours followed by a PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) wash and overnight blocking with 150 |il of blocking buffer containing 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Sigma) and 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma) in PBS at 4°C. Biotinylated peptide (1 pM) was added to each well in<br><br>
50 11 of blocking buffer and washed extensively after 1 h incubation. Test compounds were diluted in a separate 96 well plate and added in triplicate to a compound incubation plate containing a mix of the MDM2 protein and anti-MDM2 antibody. After 20 min incubation, the content of the plate was transferred to the test plate and incubated for an additional 1 hour. The secondary anti-mouse IgG antibody was added to the test plate proceeded and followed by a triple wash with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS. Finally, peroxydase substrate was added to each well and the absorption was read using a plate reader (MR7000, Dynatech) at 450nm. The inhibitory activity of the test compounds was measured as a percentage of the bound MDM2 in treated vs. untreated wells and IC50 was calculated.<br>
