Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to communication systems, and in<br>
particular, to a method and apparatus for determining channel quality and performing<br>
adaptive modulation/coding within a multicarrier communication system.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Multi-carrier modulation and Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing<br>
(OFDM) in particular, are attractive technologies for broadband high data-rate<br>
communications due to their robustness against long delay spread and lower<br>
complexity when compared to single carrier systems. In addition to multi-carrier<br>
modulations, Adaptive Modulation/Coding (AMC) is also a fundamental technique<br>
for wireless broadband commumcations. With AMC, the modulation and coding<br>
scheme (MCS) of a transmitted data stream for a particular receiver is changed to<br>
predominantly match a current received signal quality (at the receiver) for the<br>
particular frame being transmitted. The received signal quality is determined by the<br>
channel quality. (The terms "received signal quality" and "channel quality" can be<br>
referred to interchangeably). The modulation and coding scheme may change on a<br>
frame-by-frame basis in order to track the channel quality variations that occur in<br>
mobile communication systems. Thus, streams with high quality are typically<br>
assigned higher order modulations and/or higher channel coding rates with the<br>
modulation order and/or me code rate decreasing as quality decreases. For those<br>
receivers experiencing high quality, modulation schemes such as 16-QAM, 64-QAM<br>
or 256-QAM are utilized, while for diose experiencing low quality, modulation<br>
schemes such as BPSK or QPSK are utilized. Multiple coding rates may be available<br>
for each modulation scheme to provide finer AMC granularity, to enable a closer<br>
match between the quality and the transmitted signal characteristics (e.g., R=l/4, 1/2,<br>
and 3/4 for QPSK; R=l/2 and R=2/3 for 16-QAM, etc.). AMC typically yields higher<br>
system throughputs and higher data rates man other conventional link adaptation<br>
techniques such as power control.<br><br><br>
The performance of any system employing AMC is highly dependent upon the<br>
accuracy in determining a receiver's channel quality, and in particular the accuracy of<br>
the underlying link error probability prediction. Link error probability prediction<br>
maps the current radio conditions (channel quality) to an expected Frame Error Rate<br>
(FER). Bad link prediction severely degrades the performance of AMC. In order to<br>
achieve high system throughput, a simple link error probability predictor that<br>
accurately models coded OFDM performance or any other multi-carrier modulation is<br>
therefore critical for any multicarrier system employing AMC. Therefore, a need<br>
exists for a method and apparatus for accurately determining channel quality and<br>
performing adaptive modulation/coding within a multicarrier communication system.<br>

Detailed Description of the Drawings<br>
To address the above-mentioned need a method and apparatus for determining<br>
channel quality and performing adaptive modulation/coding within a multicarrier<br>
communication system is provided herein. More particularly, in a multi-carrier<br>
communication system employing adaptive modulation and coding, a receiver feeds<br>
back channel quality information for a "binned" group of subcarriers instead of<br>
sending an individual quality report for each subcarrier. In a first embodiment a<br>
binned group of subcarriers comprises a number of adjacent subcarriers, however in<br><br>
alternate embodiments, the subcarriers need not be adjacent. A transmitter will utilize<br>
the channel quality information received for all the bins, and determine a single<br>
modulation and coding scheme for all bins within the transmission frame, where a bin<br>
comprises a group of subcarriers.<br>
By feeding back channel-quality information for a bin of subcarriers, overhead<br>
for transmitting channel quality is greatly reduced. More particularly, since sending<br>
channel quality information for each subcarrier would require a very high overhead, a<br>
single channel quality report is sent for a group (e.g., 64) of subcarriers instead of<br>
sending an individual quality report for each subcarrier.<br>
The present invention encompasses a method for performing adaptive<br>
modulation and coding of a data stream in a multi-carrier communication system<br>
employing a plurality of subcarriers. The plurality of subcarriers are divided into bins<br>
of subcarriers. The method comprises the steps of receiving a channel-quality report<br>
comprising a value related to a mean in channel quality for at least one bin of<br>
subcarriers, determining a modulation and coding scheme for the data stream based<br>
on the received channel-quality report, and utilizing the modulation and coding<br>
scheme to transmit the data stream over the multi-carrier communication system.<br>
The present invention additionally encompasses a method for receiving<br>
adaptively modulated and coded data in a multi-carrier communication system<br>
employing a plurality of subcarriers. As discussed, the plurality of subcarriers are<br>
divided into bins of subcarriers. The method comprises the steps of determining<br>
channel quality for at least one bin of subcarriers, reporting the channel quality for the<br>
bin(s) to a transmitter, wherein the transmitter utilizes the channel quality for me<br>
bin(s) to aid in determining a modulation and coding scheme, and receiving data<br>
modulated and coded via the modulation and coding scheme.<br>
The present invention additionally encompasses an apparatus for performing<br>
adaptive modulation and coding of a data stream in a multi-carrier communication<br>
system employing a plurality of subcarriers. As discussed, the plurality of subcarriers<br>
are divided into bins of subcarriers. The apparatus comprises an MCS selector<br><br><br>
receiving a channel-quality report comprising a value related to a mean in channel<br>
quality for the at least one bin of subcarriers, the MCS selector outputting a<br>
modulation and coding scheme for the data stream based on the received channel-<br>
quality report, and a modulator/coder receiving the MCS and outputting modulated<br>
and coded data based on the modulation and coding scheme.<br>
Finally, the present invention encompasses an apparatus for receiving<br>
adaptively modulated and coded data in a multi-carrier communication system<br>
employing a plurality of subcarriers. As discussed, the plurality of subcarriers are<br>
divided into bins of subcarriers. The apparatus comprises a bin quality determiner<br>
analyzing a received signal and determining a channel quality for the at least one bin<br>
of subcarriers and reporting the channel quality for the at least one bin of subcarriers<br>
to a transmitter, wherein the transmitter utilizes the channel quality for the at least one<br>
bin to aid in determining a modulation and coding scheme, and a receiver for<br>
receiving adaptively modulated and coded data that was modulated and coded via the<br>
modulation and coding scheme.<br>
Turning now to the drawings, wherein like numerals designate like<br>
components, FIG. 1 is a block diagram of multi-carrier communication system 100.<br>
Communication system 100 comprises a plurality of cells 105 (only one shown) each<br>
having a base transceiver station (BTS, or base station) 104 in communication with a<br>
plurality of remote, or mobile units 101-103. In the preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention, communication system 100 utilizes an Orthogonal Frequency<br>
Division Multiplexed (OFDM) over-the-air protocol utilizing Adaptive Modulation<br>
and Coding (AMC). The architecture may also include the use of multi-carrier<br>
spreading techniques such as multi-carrier CDMA (MC-CDMA), multi-carrier direct<br>
sequence CDMA (MC-DS-CDMA), Orthogonal Frequency and Code Division<br>
Multiplexing (OFCDM) with one or two dimensional spreading, or may be also<br>
combined with simpler time and/or frequency division multiplexing/multiple access<br>
techniques.<br>
As one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize, during operation of an<br>
OFDM system, multiple subcarriers (e.g., 768 subcarriers) are utilized to transmit<br><br><br>
wideband data. This is illustrated in FIG. 2. As shown in FIG. 2 the wideband channel<br>
is divided into many narrow frequency bands, or subcarriers 201, with data being<br>
transmitted in parallel on subcarriers 201. At the transmission time, a transmitter is<br>
typically assigned a plurality of subcarriers.<br>
In addition to OFDM, communication system 100 utilizes AMC. With AMC,<br>
the modulation and coding format is changed to predominantly match a current<br>
received signal quality of the subcarrier at the receiver for the particular frame being<br>
transmitted. In a first embodiment, the same modulation and coding scheme is<br>
assigned for predominantly all the subcarriers, and channel coding is done in<br>
frequency, across the subcarriers. In alternate embodiments, the modulation and<br>
coding scheme may be assigned on a per-subcarrier basis or a per-group of subcarrier<br>
basis. The modulation and coding scheme may change on a frame-by-frame basis in<br>
order to track the channel quality variations that occur in mobile communication<br>
systems. Thus, streams with high quality are assigned higher order modulations<br>
and/or higher channel coding rates with the modulation order and/or the code rate<br>
decreasing as quality decreases. For those subcarriers experiencing high quality,<br>
modulation schemes such as 16-QAM, 64-QAM or 256-QAM are utilized, while for<br>
those experiencing low quality, modulation schemes such as BPSK or QPSK are<br>
utilized.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the present invention multiple coding rates are<br>
available for each modulation scheme to provide finer AMC granularity, and to<br>
enable a closer match between the quality and the transmitted signal characteristics<br>
(e.g., coding rate R=1/4,1/2, and 3/4 for QPSK; R=1/2 and R=2/3 for 16-QAM, etc.).<br>
Note that AMC can be performed in the time dimension (e.g., updating the<br>
modulation/coding every Nt OFDM symbol periods) or in the frequency dimension<br>
(e.g., updating the modulation/coding every NSC subcarriers) or a combination of both.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, AMC is performed in the time dimension only.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates how the quality of the signal can change based on frequency.<br>
More particularly, FIG. 3 shows how quality 301 of a signal may vary over frequency,<br>
or the channel bandwidth. In this example, quality 301 degrades as the frequency<br><br><br>
increases. It should be noted however that a different signal with the same average<br>
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) as signal 301 might have a very different channel quality<br>
profile. For instance, quality 302 has the same average SNR as 301, but presents<br>
much smoother variations than quality 301.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the present invention base station 104 will<br>
determine the modulation/coding scheme utilized for a particular transmitter based on<br>
its particular channel quality. However, two transmitters with signal quality 301 and<br>
302, respectively, may experience a very different frame error rate (FER) when<br>
assigned the same modulation/coding scheme although they experience the same<br>
average SNR. As discussed above, in order to achieve high system throughput, a<br>
simple link error probability predictor that accurately models instantaneous coded<br>
OFDM performance is therefore critical for any multicarrier system employing AMC.<br>
In order to achieve accurate predictions of coded OFDM performance, a modified<br>
exponential effective SNR mapping (exp-ESM) method is utilized for channel quality<br>
predictions of the multiple subcarriers in the OFDM system.<br>
The Exp-ESM Method<br>
At a given time, the frame-error rate (FER) of a transmission depends on each<br>
symbol's signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), denoted by a vector y which includes the<br>
symbol SNR for each subcarrier employed. The basic principle behind the exp-ESM<br>
method is to compute an instantaneous effective SNR, γeff, that is a function of vector<br>
γ so that<br><br>
In other words, γeff is the effective SNR that would yield the same FER in an<br>
AWGN channel. If there exists a function that can map vector γ to γeff, the link<br>
adaptation algorithm will be dependent of a single variable together with the a priori<br>
knowledge of the FER curve for an AWGN channel. The following function can be<br>
used to map γ to γeff:<br><br><br>
where N is the total number of subcarriers utilized, γi, is the symbol SNR experienced<br>
on subcarrier i and β is a parameter that must be optimized to provide the best<br>
matching. The parameter β is dependant on the code rate, the modulation and the<br>
information block size, but is independent of the channel type.<br>
The exp-ESM method with mapping equation (2) works well when the<br>
channel information is known for all subcarriers. However, for the deployment in a<br>
system such as IEEE 802.16 or 4G, the MCS selection needs to be performed at the<br>
base station with only partial channel information since sending channel quality<br>
information for all subcarriers would require too much overhead. In order to address<br>
this issue, in the preferred embodiment of the present invention a single channel<br>
quality report is sent for a group (e.g., 64) of subcarriers instead of sending an<br>
individual quality report for each subcarrier. Particularly, a mean and variance of the<br>
channel quality for the group of subcarriers is sent instead of sending an individual<br>
channel quality report for each subcarrier. Moreover, since channel variations in<br>
frequency domain are typically more significant than in time domain, the channel<br>
quality report usually captures the frequency-domain variations while assuming no<br>
variation between adjacent symbols in time domain. Note that variance σ2 and<br>
standard deviation σ describe the same second order statistics and either the variance<br>
or the standard deviation can be used equivalently.<br>
To accommodate subcarrier groupings, the total number of subcarriers used is<br>
divided into N' bins. If a bin consists of B subcarriers, then<br><br>
Although equation (3) assumes that all bins are of the same size B for convenience of<br>
description, it is understood that bins of different sizes may be used as well. Since<br><br>
 equation (2), where hi is the channel magnitude on subcarrier i and γ is<br>
the overall average symbol SNR, for each bin k the mean of N' values of hi can be<br>
found, which is denoted as µk. Then the mapping function (2) for a modified exp-ESM<br>
becomes:<br><br>
assuming each subcarrier within bin k has channel magnitude equal to µk. Note that β'<br>
in equation (4) is different from β of equation (2) in that β' has to account for the<br>
additional effect of binning. In some situations the loss of the information of the<br>
individual subcarriers may lead to a degradation of the prediction accuracy, and hence<br>
poor performance of AMC. Because of this, the present invention includes higher<br>
order statistics over a bin to better determine the channel quality of the bin. The<br>
method is referred as the "adv-ESM" method.<br>
Let µk. be the average over channel magnitude vector hk (i.e., N' values of hi)<br>
of bin k and Σ2K be the variance of hk over bin k. The mapping function can be<br>
generally defined as:<br><br>
for mapping the N' channel quality information (µk, σk) into a single value of γeff. In<br>
one example function Γ(µk,σk, β) is defined as<br><br>
where f is a parameter optimized based on the bin size. When f and β are carefully<br>
chosen, this new mapping function leads to a much smaller prediction error than the<br>
exp-ESM method with binning, especially for large bin sizes.<br><br>
Note that since the variance is included to account for the channel variation<br>
within a bin, parameter ft is the same as in equation (2), i.e., the standard exp-ESM<br>
method without frequency binning. The scaled variance is included so that with the<br>
same µk, a channel profile with higher variance is penalized and has smaller γeff, and<br>
therefore worse FER performance. The value of f is typically close to 0 for low coding<br>
rates (e.g., 1/4) and increases with the code rate. Also, for the same MCS, f is larger<br>
when the bin size increases.<br>
As an example, parameter values for a given information block size of 12032<br>
bits (approximately 1500 bytes) are shown below. The β value for three modulations<br>
and five code rates are found and tabulated in Table 1. When a bin size of 16 is used,<br>
the values of f parameter is found and tabulated in Table 2.<br><br>
Although the channel quality is measured as (µk, σk) over channel magnitude<br>
vector hk, the mean and variance of other channel quality statistics can be used to<br>
construct a function such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and signal-to-<br>
interference and noise ratio (SINR). Also, the channel quality can be determined<br>
dynamically periodically.<br><br>
Moreover, the channel quality report may comprise channel quality values<br>
determined via reciprocity in a time-division duplex (TDD) system. In this case,<br>
considering that the channel quality is the same observed from the transmitter side or<br>
the receiver side, me channel quality report may be effectively binned at the<br>
transmitter, instead of the receiver, to apply the adv-ESM method.<br>
FIG. 4 is a block diagram of multicarrier transmitter 400 utilizing AMC. As<br>
discussed above, transmitter 400 receives data that is to be transmitted to a receiver<br>
and effectively transmits me data by coding it across multiple subcarriers. A single<br>
modulation and coding scheme is used for all subcarriers and is dependent upon the<br>
channel quality of predominantly all occupied subcarriers. Thus, data enters the<br>
transmitter and is effectively modulated and coded via adaptive modulator and coder<br>
403. After proper modulation and coding, the data stream is transmitted (via<br>
transmitter 405) on a plurality of subcarriers.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the present invention modulator/coder 403<br>
utilizes a modulation and coding scheme mat is dependent upon the channel quality of<br>
the channel bandwidui. More particularly, MCS selector 407 receives µk and σk and<br>
computes a predicted channel quality (γeff) for the number of possible modulation and<br>
coding schemes available. MCS selector 407 then chooses the best modulation and<br>
coding scheme for that particular channel. In particular the transmitter typically<br>
chooses the MCS yielding the highest possible throughput, where the selected MCS<br>
usually has an expected FER lower man a target value (typically 10-2).<br>
It should be noted that instead of receiving µk and σk for each bin via a<br>
channel-quality report, transmitter 400 may simply receive γeff for whole or part of the<br>
channel bandwidui, pre-calculated by the receiver. MCS selector 407 would men base<br>
the MCS choice for the whole channel bandwidui on the received set of γeff values. It<br>
should also be noted that all real quantities will be quantized into a bit pattern for<br>
transmission over the air. Also, alternatively, the transmitter may simply receive a<br>
preferred MCS value direcdy computed by the receiver.<br><br><br>
FIG. 5 is a flow chart showing operation of the transmitter of FIG. 4. The logic<br>
flow begins at step 501 where the transmitter receives an adv-ESM channel quality<br>
report, which for at least one frequency bin, contains a value related to the mean<br>
and/or a value related to the standard deviation in quality for the bin(s). At step 503<br>
MCS selector 407 computes the effective channel quality for predominantly all the<br>
subcarriers (e.g., the effective signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)) for the MCSs that can be<br>
assigned using the method described above. At step 505 selector 407 computes the<br>
expected FER for all candidate MCS schemes. The candidate MCS scheme may be all<br>
or a subset of the available MCS schemes. Alternatively, interpolation techniques can<br>
be used to compute the expected FER for some MCSs. The MCS utilized is chosen at<br>
step 507 based on the expected FER values. In particular, the MCS that has the<br>
highest possible throughput with an expected FER lower than a target value (typically<br>
10"2) is typically chosen. At step 509 the data stream is input into transmitter 405,<br>
being appropriately modulated and coded, and the data stream is transmitted at step<br>
511.<br>
It should be noted mat while the above procedure receives a value related to<br>
the mean and a value related to the standard deviation of each bin, in an alternate<br>
embodiment, γeff for predominandy all subcarriers may be computed by the receiver<br>
for a set of MCS and simply transmitted to transmitter 400. In this situation, MCS<br>
selector 407 will base the MCS selection on me received set of γeff values.<br>
Additionally, in some situations, a user's data may be transmitted utilizing<br>
several, but not all bins. In such a situation an intermediate step is required to select<br>
the bins that cover the resources that will be assigned. These resources may be the<br>
best bins (based on channel quality), or bins mat ease multiplexing concerns. In<br>
addition to the above noted events, the following events are envisioned:<br>
• There may exist an additional step in FIG. 5 where the transmitter requests the<br>
adv-ESM channel quality report (i.e., traffic dependent scheduling), or the<br>
receiver may know when to send reports.<br><br><br>
•	The receiver may send back an adv-ESM report or some other report; the above<br>
procedure is used only when the adv-ESM report is received.<br>
•	The assigned MCS is typically the best MCS, though factors such as the data<br>
queue, available resources, and multiplexing method can influence the<br>
assignment.<br>
•	The assigned MCS may not be one of the MCS where effective SNR and expected<br>
FER are computed (i.e., interpolation could be used to select an intermediate<br>
MCS).<br>
•	There may be a further step in FIG. 5 where the transmitter sends the MCS<br>
assignment to the mobile.<br>
•	If the transmitter knows that the receiver is experiencing a channel with a<br>
coherence time less than a small number of frames, the transmitter can average<br>
together adv-ESM channel quality reports in order to pick a better MCS for the<br>
rapidly changing channel.<br>
FIG. 6 is a block diagram of multicarrier receiver 600 that received data that<br>
has been adaptively modulated and coded. During operation data is received via a<br>
plurality of subcarriers by receiver 605. The received data is demodulated and<br>
decoded via decoder 603. MCS determiner 607 receives the current MCS via a control<br>
channel, the control channel using a known MCS, and instructs demodulator/decoder<br>
to utilize the proper MCS during decoding of the data. MCS can be signaled<br>
explicitly, or calculated based on other control information (such as the information<br>
block size and the coded block size). The MCS can also be blindly detected. As<br>
discussed above, the modulation and coding scheme of decoder 603 is varied based on<br>
the received channel quality. Thus, data streams with high quality are typically<br>
assigned higher order modulations rates and/or higher channel coding rates with the<br>
modulation order and/or the code rate decreasing as quality decreases. For those<br>
receivers experiencing high quality, modulation schemes such as 16-QAM, 64-QAM<br>
or 256-QAM are utilized, while for those experiencing low quality, modulation<br>
schemes such as BPSK or QPSK are utilized. AMC typically yields higher system<br>
throughputs and higher data rates than other conventional link adaptation techniques<br>
such as power control.<br><br><br>
Bin quality determiner 609 analyzes the currently received data stream for<br>
utilized subcarriers and determines a mean and a standard deviation in channel quality<br>
for the at least one utilized bin. As discussed above, each bin comprises a plurality of<br>
adjacent or non-adjacent subcarriers, with the mean and variance of quality being<br>
determined for the plurality of adjacent or non-adjacent subcarriers. Additionally, in<br>
the preferred embodiment of the present invention a mean and variance of channel<br>
magnitude is determined, however, in alternate embodiments of the present invention,<br>
other channel quality metrics may be utilized such as SNR, SINR, and uncoded bit<br>
error probability. The mean and standard deviations for the plurality of bins utilized<br>
(at least one) are then reported back to the transmitter so that an appropriate MCS can<br>
be applied to the channel by the transmitter.<br>
As discussed above, by feeding back channel-quality information for a bin of<br>
subcarriers, channels overhead is gready reduced. For example, in a system<br>
employing 768 subcarriers and 64 subcarrier bins, only 12 bins exist. The above<br>
technique men requires only reporting 12 means and 12 variances in quality to the<br>
transmitter instead of reporting 768 quality values. This greatly reduces channel<br>
overhead. Moreover, if a γeff is reported for all 12 bins, then only one channel quality<br>
value needs to be reported per MCS.<br>
FIG. 7 is a flow chart showing operation of bin quality determiner 609. The<br>
logic flow begins at step 701 where each utilized channel is analyzed to determine its<br>
quality. At step 703 a mean and a variance for the quality of at least one bin is<br>
determined. In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, a mean and<br>
variance in channel magnitude is determined. At step 705 this mean and variance is<br>
reported back to the transmitter to aid in determining an appropriate MCS for each<br>
stream using adv-ESM. Finally, at step 707 data is received modulated and coded<br>
with the appropriate MCS. As discussed above, in an alternate embodiment of the<br>
present invention bin quality determiner may compute the value of γeff for the whole<br>
channel and report this value back instead of reporting the mean and standard<br>
deviation for the quality of the bins.<br><br><br>
Scheduling using adv-ESM<br>
Using the adv-ESM method will improve the system performance of all types<br>
of scheduling. Scheduling is the operation of partitioning an amount of radio<br>
resources and jointly assigning radio resources to each data stream of a group of date<br>
streams. As mentioned above, the adv-ESM method may be performed over some or<br>
all of the reported bins, and the bins used may be dependent on the type of scheduling<br>
planned for the user. Two types of scheduling appropriate for the adv-ESM method<br>
include:<br>
1.	Frequency non-selective. The adv-ESM method is performed over all (or a<br>
representative subset) of reported bins, and a resource assignment is provided<br>
such that does not favor the usage of any particular bin.<br>
2.	Frequency semi-selective. The transmitter picks a desirable subset of reported<br>
bins to perform the adv-ESM computation, and a resource assignment is<br>
provided that favors the use of the desired bins. The method is called semi-<br>
selective because the reported bin size may be much larger than the best bin<br>
size for the coherence frequency of the current channel.<br>
While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to<br>
a particular embodiment, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various<br>
changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and<br>
scope of the invention. For example, the invention was described for OFDM, but could<br>
be applied to any system using multi-carrier modulations. Additionally, MCS selection<br>
could be used only over a fraction of the data streams available, the other data streams<br>
using known MCS selection techniques (for instance based on the average SNR value).<br>

ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
A METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PERFORMING ADAPTIVE<br>
MODULATION AND CODING OF A DATA STREAM IN A<br>
MULTICARRIER COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
In a multi-carrier communication system (100) employing adaptive<br>
modulation and coding, a receiver feeds back channel quality information for a<br>
"binned" group of subcarriers instead of sending an individual quality report for each<br>
subcarrier. A transmitter will utilize the channel quality information for the bin to<br>
determine a set of γeff values corresponding to a set of modulation and coding scheme<br>
candidates, where γeff is an effective SNR that would yield a same FER in an AWGN<br>
channel. The transmitter utilizes the set of γeff values to aid in determining a<br>
modulation and coding scheme, and determine a single modulation and coding<br>
scheme for all subcarriers within the channel.</td>
