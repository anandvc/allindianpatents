Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel crystalline form of a cephalosporin antibiotic. More particularly, the present invention relates to novel crystalline form (Crystal B) of cefdinir of the formula (I).<br><br>
The present invention also provides  a process for the preparation of novel crystalline form (Crystal B) of cefdinir of formula (I).<br>
Background of tlie Invention<br>
Cefdinir is a third generation cephalosporin antibiotic for oral administration and has a broader antibacterial spectrum over the general gram positive and gram negative bacteria, especially against Streptococci, than other antibiotics for oral administration.<br>
US patent number 4,935,507 claims the novel crystalline form (Crystal A) of the cefdinir and a process for preparing the same. The X-ray crystallography data given in this patent is as given in the following table:<br><br>
The crystalline form (Crystal A) of cefdinir disclosed in US 4,935,507 is prepared  by   dissolving   7-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-hydroxyiminoacetamido]-3-<br><br>
vinyl-3-cephem.-4-carboxylic acid (syn isomer)(an amorphous product) in a solvent and adjusting the pH at room temperature.<br>
The dosage form that is approved for crystalline form (Crystal A) of cefdinir is capsule. The major disadvantage with the crystalline form (Crystal A) of cefdinir is that it cannot be made into any other dosage form and it has low solubility. Crystalline form (Crystal A) of cefdinir is slightly soluble in dilute hydrochloric acid and sparingly soluble in 0.1 M pH 7.0 phosphate buffer. Because of its poor solubility the crystalline form (Crystal A) is not highly bioavailable.<br>
In view of the vital antibiotic activities of cefdinir of the formula (I), the inventors of the present invention succeeded in obtaining the compound (I) in different crystal form, i.e. Crystal B, by adjusting the pH to 2.5 to 4.5 at low temperatures, which form has high solubility and more bioavailability.<br>
Objectives of the Invention<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide novel crystalline form (Crystal B) of cefdinir.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide novel crystalline form (Crystal B) of cefdinir which has very good bioavailability and useful in developing different dosage forms.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides novel crystalline form (Crystal B) of cefdinir of the formula (I)<br>

The present invention also provides a process for the preparation of novel crystalline form (Crystal B) of cefdinir of the formula (I), which comprises the steps of:<br>
i)        hydrolyzing the compound of the formula (II) using a mixture of water and water miscible solvent at a temperature in the range of 30 to 40 °C, ii)       adding EDTA to the resulting solution, iii)      cooling to 0 to 15 °C and<br>
iv)      adjusting the pH to 2.0 to 4.5 to obtain novel crystalline form (Crystal B) of cefdinir of formula (I).<br><br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the counter ion represented by M is selected from sodium, potassium, lithium, magnesium, ammonium, dicyclohexylamine, N,N'-dibenzylethylenediamine, l,8-diazabicyclo(5.4.0)undec-7-ene (DBU), l,5-diazabicyclo(4.3.0)non-5-ene, N,N'-diphenylethylenediamine, l,4-dizabicyclo(2.2.2)octane, N,N-diisopropylethylamine, N,N-diisopropylamine and the like.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the water miscible solvent used is selected from acetone, DMF, THF, dioxane, 2-butanone, methanol, isopropanol, ethanol, acetonitrile, DMAc, and the like or mixtures thereof<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the ratio of water and water miscible solvent may be in the range of 1:1 to 100:1, preferably in the range oflO:l.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the pH is adjusted using acid selected from HCl, H2SO4, phosphoric acid and the like.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the crystalline form (Crystal B) of cefdinir is a monohydrate.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the compound of formula (I) obtained is a syn isomer.<br>
The present invention is also based on our observation that if the pH of the solution is adjusted above 20 °C, the crystalline form (Crystal A) of cefdinir is obtained.<br>
The foregoing technique has been found to be markedly attractive, both from commercial point of view, as well as from manufacturing viewpoint and affords good quality of amorphous cefdinir of the formula (I).<br>
Many other beneficial results can be obtained by applying disclosed invention in a different manner or by modifying the invention with the scope of disclosure.<br><br>
The present invention is provided by the examples given below, which are provided by way of illustration only and should not be considered to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
