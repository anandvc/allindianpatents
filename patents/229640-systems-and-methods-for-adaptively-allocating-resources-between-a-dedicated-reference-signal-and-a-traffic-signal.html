QUALCOMM INCORPORATED, a company incorporated in the state of Delaware, United States of America, of 5775 Morehouse Drive, San Diego, California 92121-1714, U.S.A.,<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
WO 2005/057976â€”	PCT/US2004/040431<br>
SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR ADAPTIVELY ALLOCATING<br><br>
RESOURCES BETWEEN A DEDICATED REFERENCE SIGNAL<br><br>
AND A TRAFFIC SIGNAL<br>
BACKGROUND Field<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates generally to wireless communications systems, and<br>
more specifically, to systems and methods for optimizing the data transmission capacity of wireless communication systems.<br>
Background<br>
[0002]	The objective of a digital communications receiver is to recover the information<br>
sent by the transmitter. In most existing systems, the transmitter introduces a reference signal in the waveform together with the data-bearing signals. This reference signal, commonly referred to as a "pilot signal," is known a priori by the receiver and is used to increase the efficiency of the demodulation and decoding processes. It is common practice to broadcast the reference signal; in other words, all receivers will be using the same reference signal in their demodulation algorithms.<br>
[0003]	Since a part of the waveform is devoted to the transmission of the reference<br>
signal, the ceiling on system capacity for data transmission decreases as the amount of the reference signal increases. On the other hand, the receiver performance increases with the amount of the reference signal, which directly results in improved data capacity on given channel conditions.<br>
[0004]	One characteristic of a communication system that utilizes a reference signal is<br>
the tradeoff between the data capacity ceiling and the receiver efficiency that results from varying the portion of the waveform devoted to the transmission of the reference signal. Traditionally, the portion of the waveform devoted to the transmission of the reference signal is fixed and is chosen to be a good compromise, or optimization, between improving the receiver's performance and allocating a sufficient portion of the waveform for data transmission. This optimization is performed taking into account all possible channel conditions, which may vary greatly in propagation scenarios like the<br>

- 2 -<br>
cellular environment.   This leads to a solution which is good for the average case, but<br>
which may be far from optimal in extreme channel conditions.<br>
[0005]	Examples of systems designed to work on the cellular propagation environment<br>
are the CDMA standards for voice and data transmissions, cdma2000 and IS-856. It is a<br>
common characteristic of these systems to have dedicated traffic channels, i.e., portions<br>
of the waveform that are destined only to a particular user, where the information<br>
intended for that user is conveyed.<br>
[0006]	In view of the foregoing, benefits may be realized by systems and methods for<br>
improving the overall system capacity for data transmission.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0007]	A method in a base station for adaptively allocating at least one resource<br>
between a traffic signal and a dedicated reference signal is disclosed. A quality metric is received from a remote station. The quality metric indicates the quality of a signal transmitted from the base station and received by the remote station. The quality metric is used to allocate a resource between the traffic signal and the dedicated reference signal. The dedicated reference signal and the traffic signal are transmitted to the remote station.<br>
[0008]	In some embodiments, the resource that is allocated between the traffic signal<br>
and the dedicated reference signal may be power. Alternatively, the resource may take the form of a time slot in a time-division multiplexed signal. Other examples of resources that may be allocated will be apparent to those skilled in the art in view of the teachings contained herein.<br>
[0009]	The method may also involve transmitting a common reference signal to the<br>
remote station and to a plurality of other remote stations. The quality metric may be a signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio of the common reference signal received at the remote station. Alternatively, the quality metric may take the form of a symbol error rate of the common reference signal received at the remote station. Alternatively still, the quality metric may take the form of a frame error rate of the common reference signal received at the remote station. Other examples of quality metrics will be apparent to those skilled in the art in view of the teachings contained herein.<br><br>

signal and a dedicated reference signal is also disclosed. The base station includes a receiver that receives a quality metric from a remote station. The quality metric indicates the quality of a signal transmitted from the base station and received by the remote station. The base station also includes a resource allocation component that uses the quality metric to allocate a resource between the traffic signal and the dedicated reference signal.

The remote station also includes a signal quality measurement component that determines a quality metric of the received common reference signal.

[0026]	A wireless communication system may be designed to support one or more<br>
standards such as the "TIA/EIA/IS-95-B Mobile Station-Base Station Compatibility Standard for Dual-Mode Wideband Spread Spectrum Cellular System" referred to herein as the IS-95 standard, the standard offered by a consortium named "3rd Generation Partnership Project" referred to herein as 3GPP, and embodied in a set of documents including Document Nos. 3GPP TS 25.211, 3GPP TS 25.212, 3GPP TS 25.213, and 3GPP TS 25.214, 3GPP TS 25.302, referred to herein as the W-CDMA standard, the standard offered by a consortium named "3rd Generation Partnership Project 2" referred to herein as 3GPP2, and TR-45.5 referred to herein as the cdma2000 standard, formerly called IS-2000 MC. The standards cited hereinabove are hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0027]	The systems and methods described herein may be used with high data rate<br>
(HDR) communication systems. An HDR communication system may be designed to conform to one or more standards such as the "cdma2000 High Rate Packet Data Air Interface Specification," 3GPP2 C.S0024, Version 2, October 27,2000, promulgated by the consortium "3rd Generation Partnership Project 2." The contents of the aforementioned standard are incorporated by reference herein.<br>
[0028]	An HDR subscriber station, which may be referred to herein as an access<br>
terminal (AT), may be mobile or stationary, and may communicate with one or more HDR base stations, which may be referred to herein as modem pool transceivers (MPTs). An access terminal transmits and receives data packets through one or more modem pool transceivers to an HDR base station controller, which may be referred to herein as a modem pool controller (MPC). Modem pool transceivers and modem pool controllers are parts of a network called an access network. An access network transports data packets between multiple access terminals. The access network may be further connected to additional networks outside the access network, such as a corporate intranet or the Internet, and may transport data packets between each access terminal and such outside networks. An access terminal that has established an active traffic channel connection with one or more modem pool transceivers is called an active access terminal, and is said to be in a traffic state. An access terminal that is in the process of establishing an active traffic channel connection with one or more modem pool transceivers is said to be in a connection setup state. An access terminal may be any data device that communicates through a wireless channel or through a wired channel,<br>

for example using fiber optic or coaxial cables. An access terminal may further be any of a number of types of devices including but not limited to PC card, compact flash, external or internal modem, or wireless or landline phone. The communication link through which the access terminal sends signals to the modem pool transceiver is called a reverse link. The communication link through which a modem pool transceiver sends signals to an access terminal is called a forward link .<br>
[0029]	Figure 1 illustrates an example of a communications system 100 that supports a<br>
number of users and is capable of implementing at least some aspects of the embodiments discussed herein. Any of a variety of algorithms and methods may be used to schedule transmissions in system 100. System 100 provides communication for a number of cells 102A-102G, each of which is serviced by a corresponding base station 104A-104G, respectively. In the exemplary embodiment, some of the base stations 104 have multiple receive antennas and others have only one receive antenna. Similarly, some of the base stations 104 have multiple transmit antennas, and others have single transmit antennas. There are no restrictions on the combinations of transmit antennas and receive antennas. Therefore, it is possible for a base station 104 to have multiple transmit antennas and a single receive antenna, or to have multiple receive antennas and a single transmit antenna, or to have both single or multiple transmit and receive antennas.<br>
[0030]	Remote stations 106 in the coverage area may be fixed (i.e., stationary) or<br>
mobile. As shown in Figure 1, various remote stations 106 are dispersed throughout the system. Each remote station 106 communicates with at least one and possibly more base stations 104 on the downlink and uplink at any given moment depending on, for example, whether soft handoff is employed or whether the terminal is designed and operated to (concurrently or sequentially) receive multiple transmissions from multiple base stations. Soft handoff in CDMA communications systems is well known in the art and is described in detail in U.S. Patent No. 5,101,501, entitled "Method and System for Providing a Soft Handoff in a CDMA Cellular Telephone System," which is assigned to the assignee of the present invention.<br>
[0031]	The downlink refers to transmission from the base station 104 to the remote<br>
station 106, and the uplink refers to transmission from the remote station 106 to the base station 104. In the exemplary embodiment, some of remote stations 106 have multiple receive antennas and others have only one receive antenna.   In Figure 1, base station<br>

104A transmits data to remote stations 106A and 106J on the downlink, base station 104B transmits data to remote stations 106B and 106J, base station 104C transmits data to remote station 106C, and so on.<br>
[0032]	Figure 2 is a block diagram of a base station 204 and a remote station 206 in a<br>
wireless communication system 100. The base station 204 is in wireless communication with the remote station 206. As mentioned above, the base station 204 transmits signals to remote stations 206 that receive the signals. In addition, remote stations 206 may also transmit signals to the base station 204.<br>
[0033]	Figure 3 is a block diagram of the base station 204 and. remote station 206<br>
illustrating the downlink 308 and the uplink 310. The downlink 308 refers to transmissions from the base station 204 to the remote station 206, and the uplink 310 refers to transmissions from the remote station 206 to the base station 204.<br>
[0034]	Figure 4 is a functional block diagram illustrating an embodiment of a base<br>
station 404. The base station 404 includes a common reference source 412 that generates a common reference signal 414. The common reference signal 414 is often referred to as a common pilot signal 414. The base station 404 transmits the common reference signal 414 to all of the remote stations 106 within the communication system 100. The common reference signal 414 is an unmodulated, direct-sequence spread spectrum signal transmitted continuously by each base station 404. The common reference signal 414 is known a priori by each of the remote stations 106 in the communication system 100 and is used to increase the efficiency of the demodulation and decoding processes. The common reference signal 414 allows each user to acquire the timing of the channels transmitted by the base station 404, and provides a phase reference for coherent demodulation. The common reference signal 414 also provides a means for signal strength comparisons between base stations 404 to determine when to hand off between base stations 404 (such as when moving between cells 102).<br>
[0035]	The base station 404 also includes a dedicated reference source 416 that<br>
generates a dedicated reference signal 418. The dedicated reference signal 418 is similar to the common reference signal 414, except that the dedicated reference signal 418 is transmitted to a specific remote station 106 in the communication system 100. The dedicated reference signal 418 is known a priori by the remote station 106 that receives the dedicated reference signal 418. The dedicated reference signal 418 is used<br>
- 8 - <br>
WO 2005/057976	PCT/US2004/040431<br>
to increase the efficiency of the demodulation and decoding processes, as discussed above.<br>
[0036]	The base station 404 also includes a traffic source 420 that generates a traffic<br>
signal 422. The traffic signal 422 is a data-bearing signal other than the common reference signal 414 or the dedicated reference signal 418. The traffic signal 422 may include voice, data, overhead information, etc. Like the dedicated reference signal 418, the traffic signal 422 is transmitted to a specific remote station 106 in the communication system 100.<br>
[0037]	For simplicity, one dedicated reference source 416 and one traffic source 420 are<br>
illustrated in Figure 4. However, those skilled in the art will recognize that a base station 404 may include more than one dedicated reference source 416 and/or traffic source 420. The base station 404 generates a separate dedicated reference signal 418 and a separate traffic signal 422 for each remote station 106 in the communication system 100.<br>
[0038]	A multiplexing component 424 multiplexes the common reference signal 414,<br>
the dedicated reference signal 418, and the traffic signal 422. The multiplexing component 424 may multiplex these signals in accordance with code division multiplexing techniques, time division multiplexing techniques, frequency division multiplexing techniques, and other techniques known to those skilled in the art, including combinations thereof. The output of the multiplexing component 424 is transmitted by a transmitter 426 to a remote station 106 in the communication system 100.<br>
[0039]	The base station 404 also includes a receiver 428.    Signals received by the<br>
receiver 428 are demodulated by a demodulator 430. In some embodiments, a remote station 106 determines a quality metric 432 of the common reference signal 414 received at the remote station 106. The remote station 106 transmits this quality metric 432 to the base station 404. The quality metric 432 is recovered from the demodulated signal. Examples of different kinds of quality metrics 432 include the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR), the symbol error rate, the frame error rate, etc. Other examples of quality metrics 432 will be apparent to those skilled in the art in view of the teachings contained herein.<br>
[0040]	In embodiments disclosed herein, the base station 404 allocates a fixed amount<br>
of at least one resource to transmission of the common reference signal 414. The base<br>

WO 2005/057976                                                                                                    PCT/US200/040431<br>

station 404 also allocates a fixed amount of the at least one resource to the combination of the dedicated reference signal 418 and the traffic signal 422. In other words, when the amount of a particular resource allocated to the dedicated reference signal 418 increases, the amount of that resource allocated to the traffic signal 422 decreases, and vice versa. Examples of different types of resources that may be allocated include power, a time slot in a time-division multiplexed signal, and so forth.<br>
[0041]	As discussed above, it is desirable to allocate resources so as to optimize the<br>
system capacity for transmitting the traffic signal 422. In some embodiments, this is accomplished by using the quality metric 432 received from the remote station 106 to determine the amount of resources that are devoted to transmission of the dedicated reference signal 418, so that the system capacity for transmitting the traffic signal 422 is maximized.<br>
[0042]	The base station 404 includes a resource allocation component 434 that uses the<br>
quality metric 432 received from the remote station 106 to determine how to allocate at least one resource between the dedicated reference signal 418 and the traffic signal 422. The resource allocation component 434 provides resource allocation information 436 to the multiplexing component 424. The multiplexing component 424 then allocates at least one resource between the dedicated reference signal 418 and the traffic signal 422 in accordance with the resource allocation information 436.<br>
[0043]	In some embodiments, determining how to allocate a resource between the<br>
dedicated reference signal 418 and the traffic signal 422 may be performed in the following manner. The quality metric 432 of the common reference signal 414 is a function of certain parameters. The resource allocation component 434 uses the received quality metric 432 to determine those parameters. The resource allocation component 434 then uses those parameters in a capacity function that expresses the transmission capacity of the downlink 308. The capacity function depends on the determined parameters and also on the portion of the resource devoted to the traffic signal 422. The portion of the resource devoted to the traffic signal 422 is then determined so as to maximize the capacity function. Additional details about how this may be accomplished, including mathematical equations illustrating this technique, will be provided below.<br>
[0044]	In some embodiments, the base station 404 does not initially transmit a<br>

embodiments the multiplexing component 424 initially allocates all of at least one resource (e.g., the amount of power allocated to the combination of the dedicated reference signal 418 and the traffic signal 422) to the traffic signal 422, and none of the at least one resource to the dedicated reference signal 418. Once the base station 404 begins to receive the quality metric 432 from the remote). station 106, the resource allocation component 434 may then instruct the multiplexing component 424 to allocate some of the at least one resource to the dedicated reference signal 418 in order to optimize the system capacity for transmitting the traffic signal 422. Alternatively, in some embodiments the remote station 106 continuously reports the quality metric 432 measured over the common reference signal 418, and when the base station 404 needs to send information it does so already with the optimized resource allocation.<br>
[0045]	Figure 5 is a functional block diagram illustrating an embodiment of a remote<br>

A demultiplexing component 540 demultiplexes signals received by the receiver 538 in order to recover a received common reference signal 414', a received dedicated reference signal 418', and a received traffic signal 422'. The received common reference signal 414â€™ is the version of the common reference signal 414 that is received at the remote station 506.

[0046]	As discussed above, the common reference signal 414 and the  dedicated<br>
reference signal 418 that are transmitted by the base station 404 are known a priori by the remote station 506. In the illustrated embodiment, the remote station 506 includes a common reference source 412 and a dedicated reference source 416. The common reference source 412 generates a copy of the common reference signal 414 transmitted by the base station 404. This will be referred to as the transmitted common reference signal 414. The dedicated reference source 416 generates a copy of the dedicated reference signal 418 transmitted by the base station 404. This will be referred to as the transmitted dedicated reference signal 418.<br>

[0048]	The received common reference signal 414', the received dedicated reference<br>
signal 418', the transmitted common reference signal 414, and the transmitted dedicated reference signal 418 are each provided to a training component 546. The training component 546 compares the received reference signals (the received common reference signal 414' and the received dedicated reference signal 418') with the transmitted reference signals (the transmitted common reference signal 414 and the transmitted dedicated reference signal 418). Based on this comparison, the training component 546 "trains" the receiver 538 to compensate for signal distortions that may have resulted from noise, interference, and the like during transmission. In one embodiment the receiver 538 includes a filter (not shown), and the training component 546 determines the coefficients for the taps of the filter. To determine the coefficients for the taps of the filter, the training component 546 may utilize known adaptive algorithms such as least mean square (LMS), recursive least squares (RLS), etc.<br>
[0049]	Figure 6 is a functional block diagram illustrating another embodiment of a base<br>
station 604. Like the embodiment described previously, the base station 604 includes a common reference source 612 that generates a common reference signal 614, a dedicated reference source 616 that generates a dedicated reference signal 618, and a traffic source 620 that generates a traffic signal 622.<br>
[0050]	In the illustrated embodiment, the common reference signal 614, dedicated<br>

Specific examples of how this determination may be made will be discussed below.<br>
[0054]	The power allocation component 634 provides dedicated reference power<br>
information 658 to the dedicated reference Walsh spreading component 650. The dedicated reference Walsh spreading component 650 uses the dedicated reference power information 658 to allocate power to the Walsh code that it uses to spread the dedicated reference signal 618.<br>
[0055]	The power allocation component 634 provides traffic power information 660 to<br>
the traffic Walsh spreading component 652. The traffic Walsh spreading component 652 uses the traffic power information 660 to allocate power to the Walsh code that it uses to spread the traffic signal 622. Power is allocated to a Walsh code by means of a multiplicative factor that scales the digital signal corresponding to the particular Walsh code. At a later stage, the digital signals corresponding to all active Walsh codes are added together to form the total digital signal ready for transmission.<br>

[0073]	Figure 10 is a flow diagram illustrating an embodiment of a method 1000 for<br>
adaptive allocation of resources between a dedicated reference signal 418 and a traffic signal 422.

station 106 may determine 1006 a quality metric 432 and transmit 1008 the quality metric 432 to the base station 404 before the base station 404 transmits 1004 the traffic signal 422 to the remote station 106.<br>
[0075]	The base station 404 uses the quality metric 432 to allocate 1010 at least one<br>
resource between the traffic signal 422 and a dedicated reference signal 418. The base station 404 allocates resources so as to maximize the system capacity for transmitting the traffic signal 422. As discussed previously, examples of resources that may be allocated include power, a time slot in a time-division multiplexed signal, etc. Once resources have been allocated, the base station 404 then transmits 1012 the dedicated reference signal 418 and the traffic signal 422 to the remote station 106.<br>
[0076]	A mathematical explanation of how the quality metric may be used by the base<br>
station to maximize the system capacity for transmitting the traffic signal will now be provided. If we normalize the total amount of resources available at the transmitter of the base station to equal 1, the operation of the system may be described in the following manner. A fixed portion of those resources is constantly devoted to the common reference signal. In each remote station, a training component is constantly using the received common reference signal to train the remote station receiver. Also, in each remote station a quality measurement component is constantly using the received common reference signal to obtain estimates of a quality metric, such as the SINR. At a given moment in time, the resource allocation component at the base station will allocate another portion p of the available resources to a dedicated channel with the objective of transmitting data to a specific remote station. The problem is how to optimally allocate those p resources between a dedicated reference signal and a traffic signal, such that the data capacity is maximized.<br>
[0077]	Let us say that there exists a known function g given by equation (1):<br>
SINR = g(e0,p,exq,y ),                                            (1)<br>
Equation (1) links the SINR that would be obtained at the remote station receiver during data transmission with the scalar quantities e0,p,ec,, and the vectors q  and y. The vector q describes the type of training algorithms used. The vector y represents the (possible) dependence of SINR on the particular channel and interference conditions. More specifically, equation (1) represents the performance of the demodulation technique characterized by q, when trained over an e0 amount of a common reference<br>

signal and an exp  amount of a dedicated reference signal, applied over a (l-ex)p<br>
amount of resources allocated to a traffic signal.<br>
[0078]	Let us assume that when there is no traffic signal transmitted to the remote<br>
station the quality measurement component of the remote station determines the SINR of the received common reference signal, which is given by another a priori known<br>
function gp:<br>
SINRR=gR(e0,q,y)	(2)<br><br>
                                                                                          ( 2 )<br>
The remote station transmits its measured SINRp and possibly 0 to the base station.<br>
[0079]	Since e0 and p are known at the transmitter, if g(.) and gp(.) are such that<br>
knowledge of SINRR and q allows full description of g(.), ex may be optimized to maximize SINR during periods of data transmission. In most cases, maximizing SINR also maximizes the data capacity. The particular choice of ex used for each transmission may be explicitly conveyed to the remote station. For example, in some embodiments, the base station may transmit ex to the remote station on a dedicated control channel. Alternatively, the base station and the remote station may agree on some implicit rules for determining ex.<br>
[0080]	A specific example of some of the techniques disclosed herein will now be<br>
provided. In the forward link of release C of the cdma2000 cellular standard, a.k.a. 1x-EV-DV, the base station will transmit non-voice (data) traffic over the Packet Data Channel (PDCH). After budgeting power for all the voice users, the remaining forward link power p will be used for the PDCH. A possible mode of operation could be to schedule only one data user at a time, devoting to it the full remaining power p. We now apply some of the techniques described herein to the "single data user" case.<br>

[0083]	In the context of equations (1) and (3) we now identify q as given by equation<br>

 Accordingly, the vector arguments of gp (.) and gp (.) turn out to be scalar quantities.<br>

[0087]	After examining equations (3) and (12), we realize that if the base station<br>
possesses knowledge of SINR p   and              it may use equation (3) to determine a ,<br>
which is the only additional parameter needed in order for it to optimize me choice of<br>
ex that maximizes equation (12). One way to achieve this goal would be for the remote<br>
station to send SINRp    and             to the base station through a feedback channel.<br><br><br>
Alternatively, the parameter              may be a fixed parameter which the base station and<br>
remote station agree upon during call setup, and which does not change thereafter.<br>
