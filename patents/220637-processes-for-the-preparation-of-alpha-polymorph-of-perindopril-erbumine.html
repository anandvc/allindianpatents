CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. §119 to Provisional Application No. 60/572,402, filed May 19, 2004 and entitled "Process for the PREPARATION of ALPHA POLYMORPHS OF PERINDOPRIL ERBUMINE", and from Indian Provisional Application Number 531/MUM/2004, filed May 07, 2004, the contents of which are incorporated by reference herein BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Technical Field<br>
The present invention generally relates to improved processes for the preparation of the alpha crystalline form of perindopril erbumine.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of perindopril erbumine (also known as (2S,3^S,7|iS)-l-[(S)-N-[(S)-I-carboxy-butyI]aIanyI]hexahydro-2-indolinecarboxylic  acid,   1-ethyl  ester,  compound with  tert-butylamine  (1:1)) of<br><br>
The tert-butylamine salt of perindopril, also known as perindopril erbumine, is the form commercially sold under the trade name Aceon®. Perindopril is the free acid form of perindopril erbumine and is an ethyl ester of a non-sulfhydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Perindopril is a pro-drug and is metabolized in vivo by hydrolysis of the ester group to form perindoprilat, the biologically active metabolite. Perindopril is ordinarily used to treat hypertension.<br>
2<br><br>
It is believed that perindoprilat lowers blood pressure primarily through inhibition of ACE activity. ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes conversion of the inactive decapeptide, Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, leading to decreased vasoconstriction, increased plasma renin activity and decreased aldosterone secretion. The latter results in diuresis and natriuresis and may be associated with a small increase of serum potassium.<br>
WO 01/87835 and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2005/0059609 disclose the alpha form of perindopril erbumine and a process for its preparation, the contents of which are incorporated by reference herein. The process includes using ethyl acetate as a solvent for crystallization. Problems associated with this process includes (1) low yield of the alpha polymorph of perindopril erbumine due to impurities; (2) extra crystallization using ethyl acetate to get acceptable yields of the alpha form of perindopril erbumine; and (3) a relatively large number of impurities are formed during the erbumine salt formation in ethyl acetate at reflux temperature.<br>
Accordingly, there remains a need for improved processes for preparing the alpha crystalline form of perindopril erbumine to provide better yields and fewer impurities than the prior art processes in a convenient and more cost efficient manner on a commercial scale.<br>

In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, a process for the preparation of the alpha crystalline form of perindopril erbumine of formula I:<br><br>
is provided comprising:<br>
(a)	forming a solution comprising perindopril erbumine of formula I in one or more ketones;<br>
(b)	heating the solution to reflux; and,<br>
3<br><br>
(c) cooling the solution to a temperature sufficient to form the alpha crystalline<br>
form of perindopril erbumine.<br>

2.	production of fewer impurities in the resulting alpha crystalline form of<br>
perindopril.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention is directed towards improved processes for the preparation of the alpha crystalline form of perindopril erbumine of formula I:<br><br>
In one embodiment, the alpha crystalline form of perindopril erbumine of formula I of this invention can be obtained by (a) forming a solution comprising perindopril erbumine of formula I in one or more ketones; (b) heating the solution to reflux; and (c) cooling the solution to a temperature sufficient to form the alpha polymorph of perindopril erbumine.<br>
4<br><br>
Processes for the preparation of perindopril erbumine are known. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,914,214, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference. Generally, perindopril erbumine can be obtained by first hydrogenating indoline-2-carboxylic acid (1) in methanol over a rhodium-aluminum oxide (RI1/AI2O3) catalyst to form (2S,3aS,7aS)-octahydroindole-2-carboxylic acid of the formula (2) and then esterifying the acid of formula (2) with thionyl chloride and benzyl alcohol to yield (2S,3aS,7aS)-octahydroindole-2-carboxylic acid benzyl ester (3); which is one key intermediate of perindopril. Another key intermediate of perindopril is prepared by reacting L-norvaline (4) with thionyl chloride and ethanol to form an ethyl ester (5); reacting the ethyl ester (5) with sodium pyruvate (6) and subjecting the reaction product to hydrogenation to form N-lS-carboxyethylbutyl-(S)-alanine (7). Next, (2S,3aS,7aS)-octahydroindole-2-carboxylic acid benzyl ester (3) is then coupled with N-1S-carboxyethylbutyl-(S)-alanine (7) in presence of sodium diethyldithiocarbamate trihydrate (DCC) to yield perindopril benzylated ester (8). Perindopril benzylated ester (8) is hydrolyzed to form perindopril (9) which is reacted with tert-butylamine in ethyl acetate to form the perindopril erbumine salt (I). This reaction scheme is generally shown below in Scheme I:<br><br><br>

7<br><br>
mixture of solvents comprised of the foregoing ketones, alcohols, and nitriles to form a solution. The solution is then heated to reflux, e.g., a temperature ranging from about 55°C to about 75°C, until the solution becomes substantially clear. The solution is then cooled to a temperature sufficient to form the alpha crystalline form of perindopril erbumine. Generally, the heated solution is gradually cooled to a temperature ranging from about 25°C to about 30°C. After cooling, the perindopril erbumine alpha polymorph is present as a crystallized white solid, which can then be filtered off by conventional techniques.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of the alpha form of Perindopril erbumine. The process involves at least (1) reacting Perindopril with tert-butylamine in a halogenated hydrocarbon solvent to form perindopril erbumine; (2) forming a solution including at least perindopril erbumine of formula I in one or more of the foregoing ketones and optionally one or more of the foregoing alcohols and/or nitriles; (3) heating the solution to reflux; and (4) cooling the solution to a temperature sufficient to form the alpha polymorph of perindopril erbumine. Examples of such halogenated hydrocarbon solvents include, but are not limited to, aliphatic chlorinated solvents such as, for example, methylene chloride (also known as dichloromethane or methylene dichloride), ethylene dichloride, trichloroethylene, and chloroform; and the like and mixtures thereof with methylene chloride being the preferred halogenated hydrocarbon solvent.<br>
The alpha crystalline form of perindopril erbumine obtained from the processes of the present invention will be in relatively high purity, e.g., a purity greater than about 95% and preferably greater than about 99%. The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions (formulations) containing an effective amount of the highly purified alpha crystalline form of perindopril erbumine in combination with, for example, one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients, diluents or adjuvants in accordance with known and established practice. For example, the highly purified alpha crystalline form of perindopril erbumine may be formulated for oral, parenteral (intravenous or subcutaneous) or nasal administration, tablets, sublingual tablets, gelatin capsules, lozenges, suppositories, creams, ointments, dermal gels, injectable preparations, drinkable suspensions etc. The useful dosage can be varied according such factors as the<br>
8<br><br>
nature and severity of the disorder, the administration route and the age and weight of the patient. It may vary from 1 to 500 mg per day in one or more administrations.<br>
Thus, the alpha crystalline form of perindopril erbumine of the invention can be formulated as a liquid, powder, elixir, injectable solution, etc. Formulations for oral use can be provided as tablets or hard capsules wherein the pharmacologically active ingredient(s) are mixed with an inert solid diluent such as calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredients are mixed with water or miscible solvents such as propylene glycol (PEG); mixtures of PEG's and alcohols, e.g., ethanol, or an oleaginous medium, e.g., peanut oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil.<br>

For topical administration to the epidermis, the alpha crystalline form of perindopril erbumine of the invention can be formulated as creams, gels, ointments or lotions or as transdermal patches. Such compositions can, for example, be formulated with an aqueous or oily base with the addition of suitable thickening, gelling, emulsifying, stabilizing, dispersing, suspending, and/or coloring agents.<br>
The alpha crystalline form of perindopril erbumine of the invention can also be formulated as depot preparations. Such long acting formulations can be administered by implantation (for example subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Thus, for example, the compounds can be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives, for example as a sparingly soluble salt.<br>
The alpha crystalline form of perindopril erbumine of the invention can be formulated for parenteral administration by injection, conveniently intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous injection, for example by bolus injection or continuous intravenous infusion. Formulations for injection can be presented in unit dosage from e.g. in ampoules or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions can take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or<br>
9<br><br>
aqueous vehicles, and can contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g. sterile pyrogen-free water, before use.<br>

The aqueous suspensions can also contain one or more preservatives, e.g., ethyl-or-n-propyl-p-hydroxy benzoate, one or more coloring agents,<br>
10<br><br>
one or more flavoring agents and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose, saccharin or sodium or calcium cyclamate.<br>
The following examples are provided to enable one skilled in the art to practice the invention and are merely illustrative of the invention.  The examples should not be read as limiting the scope of the invention as defined in the claims.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Step I: Preparation of Perindopril Erbumine<br>
In a 4-necked round bottom flask, methylene chloride (750 ml) and N-l(S)<br>
carboxyethylbutyl-(S)-alanine (70.0g, 0.32M) were added and cooled to about 10°C. To this N,N'-carbonyl diimidazole (96.5g, 0.59M) was added slowly over about 45 minutes. The reaction mass was then stirred for about 2 hours at a temperature ranging from about 10°C to about 15°C. After cooling to a temperature of about 0°C, octahydroindole-lH-2-carboxylic acid (50 g, 0.295M), was added in a single lot by maintaining temperature ranging from about 0°C to about 5°C and stirred for about 2 hours. The methylene chloride was then distilled off completely under vacuum below 30°C to get an oily residue. To this oily residue, a mixture of acetic acid (36.5 g) in water (500 ml) was added at a temperature below 5°C and stirred for 30 minutes. The reaction mass was extracted with methylene chloride (500 ml). The methylene chloride layer was then washed with saturated brine solution (100 ml) and dried over sodium sulfate (50 g). The methylene chloride layer was charged in a round bottom flask and cooled to a temperature of about 5°C. Tert-butylamine (32.5 ml) was charged to the reaction mass over 30 minuets at a temperature below 10°C and stirred for 30 minutes. The methylene chloride is then distilled off to provide an oily residue of perindopril erbumine.<br>
STEP II: Preparation of alpha crystalline form of Perindopril Erbumine<br>
A mixture of isopropyl alcohol (150 ml), acetone (300 ml) and acetonitrile (300 ml) was charged to the oily residue obtained in step I and heated to a temperature ranging from about 65°C to about 70°C to obtain a clear solution.  The reaction mass was then<br>
