				<td>Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitor compounds<br>
This invention relates to novel chemical compounds, processes for their preparation,<br>
pharmaceutical formulations containing them and their use in therapy.<br>
The compounds of the invention are inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinase enzymes<br>
(MMPs).<br>
Matrix metalloproteinase enzymes play a major role in extracellular matrix component<br>
degradation and remodelling. Examples of MMPs include collagenase 1, 2 and 3,<br>
gelatinase A and B, stromelysin 1,2 and 3, matrilysin, macrophage metalloelastase,<br>
enamelysin and membrane type 1,2,3 and 4 MMP. The enzymes are secreted by<br>
connective tissue cells and inflammatory cells. Enzyme activation can not only initiate<br>
tissue damage but induce increased inflammatory cell infiltration into the tissue, leading<br>
to more enzyme production and subsequent tissue damage. For example, elastin<br>
fragments produced by MMP degradation are believed to stimulate inflammation by<br>
attracting macrophages to the site of MMP activity. Inhibition of MMPs provides a<br>
means for treating disease states wherein inappropriate metalloprotease activity results<br>
in degradation of connective tissue and inflammation.<br>

methodology described hereinafter, constituting a further aspect of this invention.<br>
A first process (A) according to the invention for preparing a compound of formula (I)<br>
wherein Z represents a bond comprises reacting a compound of formula (II):<br><br><br>
wherein R1, R1', R2, R3, R3', A, B, D, E, Q, X and Y are as previously defined for formula (I)<br>
and L represents a leaving group, with a reagent suitable to introduce the group R4, such<br>

in the presence of a suitable catalyst, for example a palladium catalyst (preferred for T =<br>
NR5H) or a copper catalyst (preferred for T = OH or SH). Suitable leaving groups<br>
represented by L include halides, especially bromide or iodide.<br>
For compounds in which Z represents SO or SO2, the compound of formula (I) may<br>
conveniently be prepared by initial preparation of the compound in which Z represents S,<br><br>
followed by oxidation of the sulphide to the sulfoxide or the sulfone. The oxidation step<br>

wherein L is a suitable leaving group. The reaction is conveniently carried out in a<br>
suitable solvent, such as an alcohol solvent, e.g. ethanol, under basic conditions, for<br>
example in the presence of an aqueous hydroxide such as sodium hydroxide. Suitable<br>
leaving groups represented by L include halides, especially bromide or iodide.<br>
A fifth process (E) according to the invention for preparing a compound of formula (I)<br>
wherein Z represents CH2, comprises reacting a compound of formula (VI):<br><br><br>
(VI)<br>
wherein Q, X, Y, R1, Rr, R2, R3, A, B, D and E are as previously defined for formula (I),<br>
with a reagent suitable to introduce the group R4CH2, such as a compound R4CH2-L,<br>
wherein L is a suitable leaving group, for example halide, suitably in the presence of a<br>
catalyst, for example a Lewis acid catalyst such as AICI3. A Friedel-Crafts reaction may<br>
accordingly be appropriate.<br>

conveniently carried out in a suitable solvent, such as an aprotic solvent, e.g.<br>
dimethylformamide, under basic conditions, for example in the presence of a base such<br>
as potassium hydride. Suitable leaving groups represented by L include halides, such as<br>
bromide or iodide, and methylsulphonyloxy groups.<br>
A seventh process (G) according to the invention comprises carrying out a process<br>
selected from processes (A) to (F) followed by interconversion of one or more functional<br>
groups. Interconversion processes include processes such as oxidation, reduction,<br>
substitution, deprotection etc., standard in the art of synthetic chemistry.<br>
Compounds of formula (II), (III), (IV). (V) and (VI) may be prepared by reaction of<br>
compounds of formula (VIII):<br><br>
wherein Q, X, Y, R1, R1', R2, R3, A, B and D are as previously defined for formula (I) and U<br>
is L in the case of compound (II), T in the case of compound (III), L(R5)(R6)CH2 in the case<br>

bromide or iodide, and methylsulphonyloxy groups. Alternatively, an activated leaving<br><br>
group L2 of the Mitsunobu type may be generated by reacting a corresponding alcohol<br>

According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided the use of a compound of<br>
formula (I) or a physiologically acceptable derivative thereof for the manufacture of a<br>
medicament for the treatment of inflammatory conditions or autoimmune disorders.<br>
In a further or alternative aspect there is provided a method for the treatment of a human<br>
or animal subject suffering from or susceptible to an autoimmune disorder or an<br>
inflammatory condition which method comprises administering to said human or animal<br>
subject an effective amount of a compound of formula (I) or a physiologically functional<br>
derivative thereof.<br>
The compounds according to the invention may be formulated for administration in any<br>
convenient way, and the invention therefore also includes within its scope pharmaceutical<br>
compositions comprising a compound of formula (I) or a physiologically acceptable<br>
derivative thereof together, if desirable, with one or more physiologically acceptable<br>
diluents or carriers.<br>
There is also provided a process for preparing such a pharmaceutical formulation which<br>
comprises mixing the ingredients.<br>
The compounds according to the invention may, for example, be formulated for oral,<br>
inhaled, intranasal, topical, buccal, parenteral or rectal administration, preferably for oral<br>
administration.<br>
Tablets and capsules for oral administration may contain conventional excipients such as<br>
binding agents, for example syrup, acacia, gelatin, sorbitol, tragacanth, mucilage of<br>
starch, cellulose or polyvinyl pyrrolidone; fillers, for example, lactose, microcrystalline<br>
cellulose, sugar, maize- starch, calcium phosphate or sorbitol; lubricants, for example,<br>
magnesium stearate, stearic acid, talc, polyethylene glycol or silica; disintegrants, for<br>
example, potato starch, croscarmellose sodium or sodium starch glycollate; or wetting<br>
agents such as sodium lauryl sulphate. The tablets may be coated according to methods<br>
well known in the art. Oral liquid preparations may be in the form of, for example, aqueous<br>
or oily suspensions, solutions, emulsions, syrups or elixirs, or may be presented as a dry<br>
product for constitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid<br>
preparations may contain conventional additives such as suspending agents, for example,<br>
sorbitol syrup, methyl cellulose, glucose/sugar syrup, gelatin, hydroxymethyl cellulose,<br>
carboxymethyl cellulose, aluminium stearate gel or hydrogenated edible fats; emulsifying<br>
agents, for example, lecithin, sorbitan mono-oleate or acacia; non-aqueous vehicles<br>
(which may include edible oils), for example almond oil, fractionated coconut oil, oily<br>
esters, propylene glycol or ethyl alcohol; or preservatives, for example, methyl or propyl p-<br><br>
hydroxybenzoates or sorbic acid. The preparations may also contain buffer salts,<br>
flavouring, colouring and/or sweetening agents (e.g. mannitol) as appropriate.<br>
Compounds according to the invention for topical administration may be formulated as<br>
creams, gels, ointments or lotions or as a transdermal patch. Such compositions may for<br>
example be formulated with an aqueous or oily base with the addition of suitable<br>
thickening, gelling, emulsifying, stabilising, dispersing, suspending, and/or colouring<br>
agents.<br>
Lotions may be formulated with an aqueous or oily base and will in general also contain<br>
one or more emulsifying agents, stabilising agents, dispersing agents, suspending agents,<br>
thickening agents, or colouring agents. They may also contain a preservative.<br>
For buccal administration the compositions may take the form of tablets or lozenges<br>
formulated in conventional manner.<br>
The compounds may also be formulated as suppositories, e.g. containing conventional<br>
suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides.<br>
The compounds according to the invention may also be formulated for parenteral<br>
administration by bolus injection or continuous infusion and may be presented in unit dose<br>
form, for instance as ampoules, vials, small volume infusions or pre-filled syringes, or in<br>
multi-dose containers with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms<br>
as solutions, suspensions, or emulsions in aqueous or non-aqueous vehicles, and may<br>
contain formulatory agents such as anti-oxidants, buffers, antimicrobial agents and/or<br>
tonicity adjusting agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for<br>
constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g. sterile, pyrogen-free water, before use. The dry<br>
solid presentation may be prepared by filling a sterile powder aseptically into individual<br>
sterile containers or by filling a sterile solution aseptically into each container and freeze-<br>
drying.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention may also be used in<br>
combination with other therapeutic agents, for example anti-inflammatory agents (such as<br>
corticosteroids (e.g. fluticasone propionate, beclomethasone dipropionate, mometasone<br>
furoate, triamcinolone acetonide or budesonide) or NSAIDs (e.g. sodium cromoglycate,<br>
nedocromil sodium, PDE-4 inhibitors, leukotriene antagonists, CCR-3 antagonists, iNOS<br>
inhibitors, tryptase and elastase inhibitors, beta-2 integrin antagonists and adenosine 2a<br>
agonists)) or beta adrenergic agents (such as salmeterol, salbutamol, formoterol,<br>
fenoterol or terbutaline and salts thereof) or antiinfective agents (e.g. antibiotics,<br>
antivirals).<br>
It will be appreciated that when the compounds of the present invention are administered<br>
in combination with other therapeutic agents normally administered by the inhaled or<br><br>
intranasal route, that the resultant pharmaceutical composition may be administered by<br>
the inhaled or intranasal route.<br>
Compounds of the invention may conveniently be administered in amounts of, for<br>
example, 0.01 to 100mg/kg body weight, preferably 0.1 to 25 mg/kg body weight, more<br>
preferably 0.3 to 5mg/kg body weight,. The compounds may be given more than once<br>
daily to be equivalent to the total daily dose. The precise dose will of course depend on<br>
the age and condition of the patient and the particular route of administration chosen and<br>
will ultimately be at the discretion of the attendant physician.<br>
No toxicological effects are expected when a compound according to the present<br>
invention is administered in the above mentioned dose range.<br>
Compounds of the invention may be tested for in vitro activity in accordance with the<br>
following assay:<br>
The fluorescent peptide substrate used in the MMP-12 assay is FAM-Gly-Pro-Leu-Gly-<br>
Leu-Phe-Ala-Arg-Lys(TAMRA), where FAM represents carboxyfluorescein, and TAMRA<br>
represents tetramethylrhodamine. MMP12 catalytic domain (residues 106-268) protein<br>
was expressed in E. coli in the form of insoluble inclusion bodies &amp; stored in concentrated<br>
solution under denaturing conditions (8M guanidine hydrochloride). Enzyme was<br>
refolded into active form in situ by direct dilution into assay reactions. The 51 µL reactions<br>
are run in NUNC-brand black.square 384-well plates, each well containing 2 µM<br>
substrate, 20 nM enzyme, and 0.001-100 µM inhibitor, in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5,150 mM<br>
NaCI, 10 mM CaCI2,1 µM ZnAc, 0.6 mM CHAPS, and 2 % DMSO. Postitive control wells<br>
contain no inhibitor. Negative control wells are effected by either pre-dispensing the<br>
EDTA quench (see below) or by omiting enyme. Reactions are incubated at ambient<br>
temperature for 120 min, then quenched by the addition of 15µL of 100mM EDTA.<br>
Product formation in each well is quantified by measuring flourescense with a Molecular<br>
Devices Acquest. The excitation wavelength is set at 485 nM, and the emmision<br>
wavelenght is 530 nM. IC50 values were obtained by first calculating the percent inhibition<br>
(%l) at each inhibitor concentration (%l = 100*(1-(I-C2)/(C1-C2)), where C1 is the mean of<br>
the positive controls, and C2 is the mean of the negative controls), then fitting the %l vs.<br>
inhibitor concentration [I] data to: %I=A+((B-A)/(1+((C/[I]ˆD))), where A is the lower<br>
asymptote, B is the upper asymptote, C is the IC50 value, and D is the slope factor. When<br>
tested in this assay, compounds of Examples 1 to 12 had IC50s below 100 micromolar.<br>
The invention may be illustrated by reference to the following examples, which should not<br>
be construed as a limitation thereto:<br>
