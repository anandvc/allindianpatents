TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
2-(PHENYL OR HETEROCYCLIC)-lH-PHENANTRHO[9s10-d]IMIDAZOLES AS mPGES-1<br>
INHIBITORS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Modulation of prostaglandin metabolism is at the center of current anti-inflammatory therapies. NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors block the activity of cyclooxygenases and their ability to convert arachidonic acid (AA) into prostaglandin (PG) H2. PGH2 can be subsequently metabolized by terminal prostaglandin synthases to the corresponding biologically active PGs, namely, PGI2, thromboxane (Tx) A2, PGD2, PGF2a, and PGE2. A combination of pharmacological, genetic, and neutralizing antibody approaches demonstrates the importance of PGE2 in inflammation. In many respects, disruption of PGE2-dependent signalling in animal models of inflammation can be as effective as treatment with NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors. The conversion of PGH2 to PGE2 by prostaglandin E synthases (PGES) may therefore represent a pivotal step in the propagation of inflammatory stimuli.<br>
Microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1) is an inducible PGES after exposure to pro-inflammatory stimuli. mPGES-1 is induced in the periphery and in the CNS by inflammation and represents therefore a novel target for acute and chronic inflammatory disorders. The rationale for the development of specific mPGES-1 inhibitors revolves around the hypothesis that the therapeutic utility of NSAIDs and Cox-2 inhibitors would be largely due to inhibition of pro-inflammatory PGE2 while the side effect profile would be largely due to inhibition of other prostaglandins.<br>
The present invention is directed to novel compounds that are selective inhibitors of the microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 enzyme and would therefore be useful for the treatment of pain and inflammation in a variety of diseases or conditions, such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and acute or chronic pain. Furthermore, by selectively inhibiting the pro-inflammatory PGE2, it is believed the compounds of the invention would have a reduced potential for side effects associated with the inhibition of other prostaglandins by conventional non-steoidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as gastrointestinal and renal toxicity.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention encompasses novel compounds of Formula I<br><br><br>
or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. These compounds are inhibitors of the microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1) enzyme and are therefore useful to treat pain and/or inflammation from a variety of diseases or conditions, such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and acute or chronic pain. Methods of treating diseases or conditions mediated by the mPGES-1 enzyme and pharmaceutical compositions are also encompassed.<br>

The phanuaceutical compositions containing the active ingredient may be in a form suitable for oral use, for example, as tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, dispersible<br><br>
powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, or syrups or elixirs. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations. Tablets contain the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. These excipients may be for example, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, for example, corn starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, for example starch, gelatin or acacia, and lubricating agents, for example, magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. The tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed. They may also be coated by the technique described in the U.S. Patent 4,256,108; 4,166,452; and 4,265,874 to form osmotic therapeutic tablets for control release.<br>
Formulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredients is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin, or olive oil.<br>
Aqueous suspensions contain the active material in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients are suspending agents, for example sodium carboxymethyl-cellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethy-cellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting agents may be a naturally-occurring phosphatide, for example lecithin, or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids, for example polyoxyethylene stearate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethylene-oxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example polyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives, for example ethyl, or n-propyl, p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents, and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose, saccharin or aspartame.<br><br>
Liquid formulations include the use of self-emulsytying drug delivery systems and NanoCrystal® technology. Cyclodextrin inclusion complexes can also be utilized.<br>
Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, for example arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as those set forth above, and flavoring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid.<br>
Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients, for example sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents, may also be present.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of an oil-in-water emulsions. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, for example olive oil or arachis oil, or a mineral oil, for example liquid paraffin or mixtures of these. Suitable emulsifying agents may be naturally-occurring phosphatides, for example soy bean, lecithin, and esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example sorbitan monooleate, and condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The emulsions may also contain sweetening and flavouring agents.<br>
Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents, for example glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol or sucrose. Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, a preservative and flavoring and coloring agents. The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butane diol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.<br><br>
Compounds of Formula I may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials are cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols.<br>
For topical use, creams, ointments, jellies, solutions or suspensions, etc., containing the compound of Formula I are employed. (For purposes of this application, topical application shall include mouth washes and gargles.)<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also utilize absorption enhancers such as tween 80, tween 20, Vitamin E TPGS (d-alpha-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate) and Gelucire®.<br>
Dosage levels of the order of from about 0.01 mg to about 140 mg/kg of body weight per day are useful in the treatment of the above-indicated conditions, or alternatively about 0.5 mg to about 7 g per patient per day. For example, inflammation may be effectively treated by the administration of from about 0.01 to 50 mg of the compound per kilogram of body weight per day, or alternatively about 0.5 mg to about 3.5 g per patient per day, preferably 2.5 mg to 1 g per patient per day.<br>
The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. For example, a formulation intended for the oral administration of humans may contain from 0.5 mg to 5 g of active agent compounded with an appropriate and convenient amount of carrier material which may vary from about 5 to about 95 percent of the total composition. Dosage unit forms will generally contain between from about 1 mg to about 500 mg of an active ingredient, typically 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg, 400 mg, 500 mg, 600 mg, 800 mg, or 1000 mg. Dosage amounts of 4 mg, 8 mg, 18 mg, 20 mg, 36 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg, 160 mg, 320 mg and 640 mg may also be employed. The following table exemplifies formulations that may be employed for the present invention.<br>
It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy.<br>
Methods of Synthesis<br>
The compounds of Formula I of the present invention can be prepared according to the synthetic routes outlined in Schemes 1 and 4 below and by following the methods described therein. The<br><br>
imidazole of Formula I may be prepared in a multi-step sequence from the requisite phenanthrenequinone i.    The phenanthrene imidazole iii is obtained by treating the phenanthrenequinone i and an appropriately substituted aldehyde ii with a reagent such as NH4OAC or NH4HCO3 in a solvent such as<br>
acetic acid. Treatement of the imidazole iii with CuCN in a solvent such as DMF or DMSO produces the mono or bis-nitrile (M = CCN) la. Subsequent functional group interconversion can be done at any of the Rl to R.8 positions. For example, if one or more of the Rl to R$ substiruents equal CI, Br or I and if M is different from CBr or CI, la could be converted to lb by placing la in the presence of a monosubstituted alkynyl, a stannane, a boronic acid, a borane or a boronate under conditions that promote cross coupling reaction, such as heating in the presence of a catalyst, such as Pd(PPh3)4 and<br>
Cul, in the presence of a base, such as sodium carbonate or diisopropylamine, and in an suitable solvent, such as THF, DMF or DME. This last exemplified step, or any other appropriate functional group transformation, can be iteratively repeated on R* to R8.<br><br>
Phenanthrenequinone i can be prepared according to the sequences outlined in Scheme 2 and 3. Deprotonation of the phosphonium salt iv (Scheme 2) in the presence of a base, such as sodium hydride or sodium methoxide, in a solvent such as DMF followed by the addition of the aldehyde v produces the stylbene vi as a mixture of E and Z isomers. Intramolecular cyclisation of this mixture upon exposition to UV light in the presence of an oxidizing agent, such as iodine, and an acid scavenger, such as propylene oxide, in a suitable solvent such as cyclohexanne produces the phenanthrene vii. This<br><br>
phenanthrene viia can be directly oxidized with an bxidizing agent, such as Cr03, in a suitable solvent,<br>
such as acetic acid, to provide the phenanthrenequinone i, or optionally, phenanthrene viia could be further elaborated to phenanthrene viib by the apprppriate interconversion of any of the functional group R.1 to R8, such as transmetallation with an organonletallic reagent, such as butyl lithium, in a suitable solvent such as THF, followed by the addition of an electrophile, such as iodine or carbon dioxide. Alternatively (Scheme 3), phenylacetic acid viii caji be condensed with the aldehyde ix in the presence of<br>
a base, such as potassium carbonate, and in the presence of acetic anhydride to afford the nitro stylbene<br>
i<br>
x. This nitro aryl x is then reduced with an appropriate reducing agent, such as iron or iron sulfate, in the presence of ammonium hydroxide in a suitable solvent, such as acetic acid, to produce the amine xi. Diazotization of this amine xi with sodium nitrite hi the presence of aqueous hydroxide, such as sodium hydroxide, followed by acidification with an acid, $uch as sulfuric acid and sulfamic acid, and cyclization in the presence of a catalyst, such as copper or a fe Tocene, generates the phenanthrene carboxylic acid xii. This phenanthrene can be oxidized and simultaneously decarboxylated using an appropriate oxidizing agent, such as chromium trioxide in suitable solvent, such as acetic acid, to afford the phenanthrenequinone i.<br><br><br><br>
As shown in Scheme 4, protection of the halophenanthrene xiii with an appropriate protecting group such as 2-(trimethylsily)ethoxy methyl in the presence of a base, such as sodium hydride or diisopropylethylamine, in a suitable solvent, such as DMF or methylene chloride, affords the protected phenanthrene imidazole xiv. This phenanthrene imidazole xiv is then carbonylated with carbon monoxide in the presence of a catalyst, such as Pd(OAc)2, and in the presence of a base, such as<br>
triethylamine, in a mixture of an alcoholic solvent, such as methanol and DMF, or any other suitable<br>
i<br>
organic solvent. Treatment of the ester xv with a nuc|eophilic reagent such as an organolithium, organocerium or Grignard reagent in an organic solvent, such as ether, THF or methylene chloride (Grinard reagent), provides the tertiary alcohol xvi. Removal of the imidazole protecting group, for example by treating xvi with a mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid or in the presence of a fluoride source such as TBAF, in an organic solvent such as IfHF, affords the unprotected imidazole xvii.<br>
Treatment of this phenanthrene imidazole xvii with QuCN in a solvent, such as DMF or DMSO,<br>
i<br>
produced the mono or bis-nitrile (M = CCN) Id. Subsequent functional group interconversion can be done at any of the R* to R8 positions. For example, if one or more of the Rl to R8 substituents equal CI, Br or I and if M is different from CBr or CI, Id could be converted to Ie by placing Id in the presence of a monosubstituted alkynyl, a stannane, a boronic acid  a borane or a boronate under conditions that promote cross coupling reaction, such as heating in th|e presence of a catalyst such as Pd(PPh3)4 and Cul,<br>
and in the presence of a base, such as sodium carbonate or diisopropylamine, in a suitable solvent, such<br><br>
as THF, DMF or DME. This last exemplified step, j or any other appropriate functional group transformation, can be iteratively repeated on Rl t
 <br>
i The imidazole secondary amine can be substituted as described in Scheme 5 by treating<br>
an appropriately functionalized phenanthrene imidazole I with a reagent such as an acylating agent or an<br>
alkylating agent such as methyl iodide in the presence of a base such as sodium hydride in a suitable<br>
solvent such as DMF.<br><br><br>

ASSAYS FOR DETERMINING BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY<br>
Inhibition of prostaglandin E synthase activity<br>
Compounds are tested as inhibitors of prostaglandin E synthase activity in microsomal prostaglandin e synthases, whole cell and in vivo assays. These assays measure prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis using either Enzymatic Immunoassay (EIA) or mass spectrometry. Cells used for microsomal preparation are CHO-K1 cells transiently transfected with plasmids encoding the human mPGES-1 cDNA. Cells used for cell-based experiments are huikian A549 (which express human mPGES-1). Guinea pigs are used to test the activity of selected compounds in vivo. In all these assays, 100% activity is defined as the PGE2 production in vehicle-treated samples. IC50 and ED50 represent the concentration or dose of inhibitor required to inhibit PGE2 synthesis by 50% as compared to the uninhibited control.<br><br>
fractions are prepared from CHO-K1 cells mPGES-1 cDNA. Microsomes are then of 5u,g/ml microsomal PGES-1 with compound rature. The enzyme reactions are performed in educed form. The enzymatic reaction is then prepared in isopropanol (3.5% final in assay well) reaction is terminated by the addition of SnCl2 in in the enzyme reaction aliquots is done by #: 901-001 from Assay Designs).<br>

Whole cells provide an intact cellular environment for the study of cellular permeability<br>
and biochemical specificity of anti-inflammatory compounds such as prostaglandin E synthase inhibitors.<br>
i To study the inhibitory activities of these compounds, human A549 cells are stimulated with lOng/ml<br>
recombinant human EL-1P for 24 hours. The production of PGE2 and PGF2a are measured by EIA at the<br><br>

samples are mixed immediately. Cells are incubaied for 24 hours and following the incubation 175|al of<br>
medium is harvested and assayed for PGE2 and PtiF2a contents by EIA.<br>
Human whole blood prostaglandin E synthase assay<br>
Rationale<br>
Whole blood provides a protein and cell-rich milieu for the study of biochemical efficacy<br>
of anti-inflammatory compounds such as prostaglandin E synthase inhibitors. To study the inhibitory<br>
activities of these compounds, human blood is stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 24 hours to induce mPGES-1 expression. The production of Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and thromboxane B2 (TxB2)<br>
are measured by EIA at the end of the incubation las readouts for selectivity and effectiveness against<br>
mPGES-1 -dependent PGE2 production.	I<br>
Methods	Human whole blood assays for njPGES-1 activity reported (Brideau, et al., Inflamm. Res., vol. 45, p. 68, 1996) are perfonned as described below.<br>
Freshly isolated venous blood from human volunteers is collected in heparinized tubes. These subjects have no apparent inflammatory conditions and have not taken any NSAIDs for at least 7 days prior to blood collection. 250 ul of blood is pre-incubated with 1 ul vehicle (DMSO) or 1 ul of test compound. Bacterial LPS at 100p.g/ml (E. Coli serotype 0111:B4 diluted in 0.1% w/v bovine serum albumin in phosphate buffered saline) is then added and samples are incubated for 24 hours at 37°C. Unstimulated control blood at time zero (no LPSf) is used as blanlc. At the end of the 24hr incubation, the<br><br>
blood is centrifuged at 3000rpm for 10 min at 4°C. JThe plasma is assayed for PGE2 and TxB2 using an EIA kit as indicated above.<br>
In vivo determination of antiinflammatory activity<br>
Rationale	The whole animal provides an integrated physiological system to confirm the antiinflammatory activity of test compounds characterised in vitro. To determine the activity of prostaglandin E synthase inhibitors in vivo, animals are dosed with compounds either prior or after inflammatory stimulus, LPS. LPS is injected into the hind paw of guinea pigs and hyperalgesia measurements are recorded 4.5 and/or 6 hrs after th$ injection.<br>
Methods<br>
Male Hartley guinea pigs, weighing 200-250 grams were used. LPS (30 mg/kg) is injected sub-plantarly into the left hind paw of the gjuinea pig to produce hyperalgesia in the injected paw. Rectal temperature and paw withdrawal latency, a measure of hypersensitivity to pain (hyperalgesia), are taken prior to LPS injection and used as the baseline. Paw withdrawal latency is determined using the thermal hyperalgesia instrument (Ugo Basile Corp.). During this determination, animals are placed in an 8"x8" plexiglas holding box atop of a glass base. A mild (223mW/cm2) infrared light is directed toward the underside of the hind pajw. The time it takes for the animal to remove its paw (indication that it feels the pain caused by the heat) is recorded. The infrared light immediately shuts off when the animal withdraws its paw from the area. The light will also shut off automatically when the time reaches 20 seconds.<br>
Predose paradigm:<br>
Test compounds are orally dosed a: 5ml/kg using an 18-gauge feeding needle. LPS (serotype 011LB4, 10 jig) or 0.9% saline is injected into the plantar region of the left hind paw at a volume of 100 p.1 using a 26 gauge needle 1 hour following compound administration. Rectal temperature and thermal paw withdrawal latency are taken 4.5 hours after LPS administration. The animals are euthanized following the measurement^ using CO2 and lumbar spinal cord, hind paw and<br>
blood samples collected.<br><br>
Reversal paradigm:<br>
Thermal paw withdrawal of each animal is determined before and 3 hours following sub-<br><br>
ed LPS and do not show a decrease in withdrawal<br>
plantar injection of LPS. Animals which have receilatency at the 3 hour time point will be removed from study and euthanized. Test compounds are dosed p.o. at 5ml/kg immediately following the thermal paw withdrawal measurement. Thermal withdrawal<br><br>
latency is taken 1.5 and 3hours following compound<br><br>
administration (4.5 and 6 hours post-LPS<br><br>
administration). After the final reading, the animals are euthanized using C02 and lumbar spinal cord and blood samples collected for prostaglandin determination by mass spectrometry and drug level, respectively.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
