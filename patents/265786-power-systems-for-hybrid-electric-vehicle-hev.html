				<td>POWER SYSTEMS FOR HYBRID ELECTRIC VEHICLE (HEV)<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
(0001 ] The present invention generally relates to hybrid electric vehicles,<br>
and more particularly relates to methods and apparatus for providing power to<br>
electrical loads used in HEV power systems.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] A hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) utilizes an electric motor/generator<br>
unit (MGU) that includes an alternating current (AC) electric motor in<br>
conjunction with an internal combustion engine (ICE), and an electronic<br>
control unit (ECU) that controls use of the MGU and the ICE to improve<br>
efficiency. In some HEVs, the ICE drives a generator which in turn powers<br>
the electric MGU to power the vehicle. In other HEVs, both the electric MGU<br>
and the ICE can provide power to drive the vehicle's transmission depending<br>
on the mode of operation.<br>
[0003] In addition to the MGU, most HEVs include an inverter-controller<br>
unit that includes an inverter module controlled by a control unit. The inverter<br>
module includes a number of inverter sub-modules. The AC electric motor<br>
includes a number of motor windings which can be coupled to the inverter<br>
sub-modules. The inverter sub-modules can be rapidly switched by a control<br>
unit to convert the DC power provided by a battery to AC power. The inverter<br>
module provides this AC power to the AC electric motor to sequentially<br>
energize the motor windings at appropriate times to produce a rotating<br>
magnetic field that causes rotation of the AC electric motor's permanent<br>
magnetic rotor and drives the AC electric motor. In addition to supplying<br>
power to the MGU when it acts as a motor, the battery can receive power from<br><br><br>
the MGU when it acts as a generator, which allows the HEV to recharge the<br>
battery with power recovered from braking or with power from the ICE.<br>
[0004] In addition to the propulsion battery, which is often high-voltage,<br>
that is more than 60 volts, many HEVs also employ a low-voltage auxiliary<br>
battery (i.e., a 12-volt car battery) to power various vehicle electrical loads.<br>
The low-voltage auxiliary battery can be recharged by an auxiliary power<br>
module (APM) that manages charge across the low-voltage auxiliary battery.<br>
The APM can function as a DC-to-DC converter that converts electric power<br>
at the higher voltage of the propulsion battery to electric power at the low-<br>
voltage of the low-voltage auxiliary battery and vehicle electrical loads.<br>
[0005J Accordingly, it is desirable to provide an HEV power system that is<br>
less expensive to manufacture and maintain. For instance, it would be<br>
desirable to eliminate the need for separate high-voltage and low-voltage<br>
batteries and/or the need to expensive components such as the APM.<br>
Furthermore, other desirable features and characteristics of the present<br>
invention will become apparent from the subsequent detailed description and<br>
the appended claims, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings<br>
and the foregoing technical field and background.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006] Embodiments of the present invention relate to hybrid electric<br>
vehicles (HEVs). According to one embodiment, a hybrid electric vehicle<br>
(HEV) power system is provided that includes a vehicle electrical system<br>
(VES), an inverter-controller unit (1CU) and an AC electric motor/generator<br>
unit (MGU). The VES includes a first DC voltage source and a second DC<br>
voltage source coupled in series with the first DC voltage source. The VES<br>
also includes a first electrical load coupled across the first DC voltage source,<br>
and a second electrical load coupled across the second DC voltage source.<br>
The ICU is coupled across the first DC voltage source and the second DC<br>
voltage source and is designed to convert DC power from the first DC voltage<br><br><br>
source and the second DC voltage source to generate AC power for the AC<br>
electric MGU.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF AN EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT<br>
[0011] As used herein, the word "exemplary" means "serving as an<br>
example, instance, or illustration." The following detailed description is<br>
merely exemplary in nature and is not intended to limit the invention or the<br>
application and uses of the invention. Any embodiment described herein as<br>
"exemplary" is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous<br>
over other embodiments. All of the embodiments described in this Detailed<br>
Description are exemplary embodiments provided to enable persons skilled in<br>
the art to make or use the invention and not to limit the scope of the invention<br>
which is defined by the claims. Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound<br>
by any expressed or implied theory presented in the preceding technical field,<br>
background, brief summary or the following detailed description.<br><br><br>
[0012] The disclosed methods and apparatus will now be described as<br>
applied to a hybrid/electric vehicle (HEV). However, it will be appreciated by<br>
those skilled in the art that the same or similar techniques can be applied in the<br>
context of other AC systems, including those using so-called "brushless DC"<br>
motors which are powered from DC voltage sources. In this regard, any of the<br>
concepts disclosed here can be applied generally to "vehicles," and as used<br>
herein, the term "vehicle" includes, but is not limited to, automobiles such as<br>
cars, trucks, sport utility vehicles, and vans, watercraft such as boats and ships,<br>
and self-propelled industrial equipment such as forklifts, front-cnd-loaders.<br>
and robots. In addition, the term "vehicle" is not limited by any specific<br>
propulsion technology such as gasoline or diesel fuel. Rather, vehicles also<br>
include hybrid vehicles, battery electric vehicles, hydrogen vehicles, and<br>
vehicles which operate using various other alternative fuels.<br>
[0013] Exemplary Embodiments<br>
[0014] FIG. 1 is a simplified block diagram of a hybrid electric vehicle<br>
(HEV) power system 100 which can be implemented in a hybrid/electric<br>
vehicle (HEV) according to one exemplary implementation of the present<br>
invention. The HEV power system 100 includes a Motor/Generator Unit<br>
(MGU) comprising a two-phase AC induction motor 12, an inverter-controller<br>
unit (ICU) comprising a closed loop motor controller (or "control unit") 16<br>
and an inverter module 30, and a Vehicle Electrical System (VES) 60.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention can provide different vehicle electrical<br>
loads of the VES 60 with independent, auxiliary, low-voltage DC sources<br>
(e.g., 12 volt batteries) while eliminating the need additional devices or<br>
circuits to manage or control the voltage of the multiple low-voltage DC<br>
sources. Vehicle electrical loads are split into different groups, and each of<br>
these groups is coupled to its own auxiliary low-voltage DC source such that<br>
the loads are "split" into separate electrical circuits. Thus, in contrast to a<br>
conventional HEV that includes a single high-voltage battery and a single 12-<br>
volt auxiliary battery, the disclosed embodiments implement two or more<br>
auxiliary low-voltage DC sources so that the electrical loads can be separated<br><br><br>
into groups and powered separately. In addition, the two or more low-voltage<br>
DC sources can be utilized to power an inverter module and AC motor of the<br>
HEV. As such, this architecture can eliminate the need for a high-voltage<br>
battery and/or expensive components such as an APM.<br>
[00151 In this particular embodiment, the MGU includes a relatively<br>
uncommon, two-phase AC induction motor 12 (sometimes also referred to as a<br>
two-phase AC motor) that includes motor windings 20a, 20b and a neutral<br>
point N where motor winding 20a is coupled to motor winding 20b. In this<br>
implementation, the current flows into and out of winding A 20a and How s<br>
into and out of winding B 20b. Phases A and B in FIG. 1 are orthogonal<br>
which allows for construction of a perfect rotating field. At times, current is<br>
"left over" from the sum of the two phases and must therefore flow into and<br>
out of the neutral N and coupling entity 20d (e.g. cable). Although not<br>
illustrated in FIG. 1, the MGU can be driven by an internal combustion engine<br>
(ICE) as an alternator, and the MGU can also function as a starter for an ICE.<br>
In one implementation, the MGU is a Belt-connected Alternator Starter<br>
(BAS), in that the ICE is connected to the MGU via a belt. In another<br>
implementation, the MGU is a Flywheel Alternator Starter (FAS), in that the<br>
ICE uses the MGU as its flywheel, on the crankshaft of the engine.<br>
[0016| The ICU includes a two-phase inverter module 30 that is coupled<br>
to the two-phase AC induction motor 12. The two-phase inverter module 30<br>
includes a capacitor 33 and two inverter sub-modules 35, 37. Although not<br>
illustrated in FIG. I, in one implementation, the inverter sub-modules 35, 37<br>
each comprise a pair of switches (e.g., two field effect transistors (FETs) and<br>
two diodes). The inverter sub-modules 35, 37 are coupled to motor windings<br>
20a, 20b of two-phase AC induction motor 12 using any techniques or<br>
mechanism known in the art. As described in more detail below, the inverter<br>
module 30 is also coupled to the VES 60 across a pair of low-voltage DC<br>
voltage sources 70, 80 connected electrically in series such that the inverter<br>
module 30 receives a compound voltage (V,N) that is the sum of the two low-<br>
voltage DC: voltage source 70. 80. As will be appreciated by those skilled in<br><br><br>
the art, the inverter sub-modules 35, 37 convert the compound direct current<br>
(DC) voltage (VIN) provided from the auxiliary low-voltage DC sources 70, 80<br>
to alternating current (AC). The outputs generated by the inverter sub-<br>
modules 35, 37 are applied to motor windings 20a. 20b of the two-phase AC<br>
induction motor 12 to drive the two-phase AC induction motor 12.<br>
[0017] The closed loop motor controller 16 or "control unit" receives<br>
motor command signals 50 from a hybrid system controller (not shown) and<br>
motor operating signals 49 from the two-phase AC induction motor 12, and<br>
generates control signals 52 for controlling the switching of switches (not<br>
illustrated) that are implemented within the inverter sub-modules 35, 37. By<br>
providing appropriate control signals 52 to the individual inverter sub-modules<br>
35, 37, the closed loop motor controller 16 controls switching of switches (not<br>
illustrated) within those inverter sub-modules 35, 37 and thereby controls the<br>
outputs of the inverter sub-modules 35, 37 that are provided to motor windings<br>
20a, 20b, respectively.<br>
[0018] The Vehicle Electrical System (VES) 60 is coupled to the inverter<br>
module 30, and to a neutral point N of the two-phase AC induction motor 12<br>
via a coupling entity 20d, such as a cable or an electrical path through the<br>
frame of the MGU to the chassis of the vehicle. In accordance with this<br>
embodiment, the VES 60 includes two independent, low-voltage DC voltage<br>
sources 70, 80, and the electrical loads 62, 72 of the VES 60 are split or<br>
divided into a high-side electrical circuit 56 and a low-side electrical circuit<br>
58. In the particular non-limiting, exemplary embodiment illustrated in FIG.<br>
1, the electrical loads 62, 72 of the VES 60 are split into two (2) equal portions<br>
(e.g., one-half each) by providing a separate high-side auxiliary battery 70 for<br>
load(s) 62 on the high-side 56, and another separate low-side auxiliary battery<br>
80 for load(s) 72 on the low-side 58.<br>
[0019] In this particular embodiment, the high-side 56 includes the low-<br>
voltage DC voltage source 70 coupled in parallel with a non-buffered load 68,<br>
a buffer filter 65, and an electrical load 62, which can either a single electrical<br>
load or a group of different electrical loads. The non-buffered load 68 and<br><br><br>
buffer filter 65 are optional components. When implemented, the buffer filter<br>
65 performs a buffering function between the electrical load 62 and the non-<br>
buffered load 68 to ensure that sudden or short-term voltage drops at the DC<br>
voltage source 70 do not significantly impact voltage at the electrical load 62.<br>
Because these arc short-term changes, the buffer filter 65 does not need to<br>
store a large amount of energy, and so it may be a typical electronic filter<br>
based on a capacitor, rather than a secondary battery. In one exemplary<br>
implementation, the buffer filter 65 comprises a diode and a capacitor (not<br>
illustrated) that takes time to charge up and temporarily holds the voltage<br>
across load 62 at its current level. The capacitor helps to ensure that the<br>
voltage across load 62 will not change dramatically when there is a voltage<br>
change, for example, across high-side auxiliary battery 70.<br>
[00201 Similarly, the low-side 58 includes the low-voltage DC voltage<br>
source 80 coupled in parallel with a non-buffered load 78, a buffer filter 75,<br>
and an electrical load 72 as described above. As above, the non-buffered load<br>
78 and the buffer filler 75 are optional, and the buffer filler 75 performs a<br>
buffering function between the electrical load 72 and the non-buffered load 78<br>
to ensure that short-term voltage drops at the DC voltage source 80 do not<br>
significantly impact voltage at the electrical load 72. A specific<br>
implementation of the non-buffered loads and buffer filters will be described<br>
below with reference to FIG. 3.<br>
[0021] In this embodiment, node G is connected to chassis ground such<br>
that the two low-voltage DC sources 70, 80 share a common ground. The<br>
chassis (not illustrated in FIG. 1) is assumed to be at approximately zero volts<br>
or "ground." The DC voltage sources 70, 80 are coupled together in series at a<br>
common node G that is maintained at (or approximately at) ground potential.<br>
In one implementation, the common node G can be coupled or connected to<br>
the HEV's chassis (not illustrated). In this implementation, the DC voltage<br>
source 70 includes a negative terminal coupled to the chassis of the HEV at<br>
the common node G, and the DC voltage source 80 includes a positive<br>
terminal coupled in series to the DC voltage source 70 at the common node G<br><br><br>
such that the voltage sources 70, 80 generate a compound voltage (VIN) equal<br>
to a sum of the voltage (Vbat) of the low-side DC voltage source 80 and the<br>
voltage (Vbat) of the high-side DC voltage source 70. This compound voltage<br>
(VIN) can be used not only for powering electrical loads, but also for powering<br>
the inverter module 30 thereby eliminating the need tor a separate propulsion<br>
battery that is commonly used in HEVs.<br>
|0022) The DC voltage sources 70, 80 can each be implemented using any<br>
energy-storing DC voltage source, which in most cases, are low-voltage, 12-<br>
volt car batteries. When the low-voltage DC sources 70, 80 are 12-volt car<br>
batteries, the low-voltage DC sources 70, 80 can be referred to as a high-side<br>
auxiliary battery 70 and a low-side auxiliary battery 80. The high-side 56 is<br>
"negatively grounded" since the negative terminal of the high-side auxiliary<br>
battery 70 is coupled to the chassis (not illustrated in FIG. 1) at node G, and<br>
the low-side 58 is "positively grounded" since the positive terminal of low-<br>
side auxiliary battery 80 is coupled to the chassis (not illustrated in FIG. 1) at<br>
node G. When the auxiliary low-voltage DC sources 70. 80 are standard 12<br>
volt car batteries, the compound voltage (VIN) drop between the high-side 56<br>
and low-side 58 is 24 volts in total. Thus, the auxiliary batteries 70, 80<br>
together effectively provide a 24-volt battery for use by the inverter module 30<br>
(and hence the two-phase AC induction motor 12) thereby eliminating the<br>
need for a separate propulsion battery that is usually required in many HEVs<br>
to power the two-phase AC induction motor 12.<br>
[0023] The electrical loads 62, 72 can generally represent any module<br>
and/or sub-module which is driven by or consumes power from the auxiliary<br>
low-voltage DC sources 70, 80. Examples of the vehicle electrical loads 62,<br>
72 include, for example, vehicle accessories, modules, devices, components or<br>
circuits, such as lights, audio systems, entertainment systems, power steering,<br>
an ECU, a starter, electrically actuated pumps, fans, sensors, controllers,<br>
actuators, valves and other electronic components. Many electrical loads 62<br>
are complex devices which depend on the nearly universal "negative-ground<br>
convention." The electrical loads 62 are connected to across the negative-<br><br><br>
ground battery 70 on the high-side 56. Other electrical loads for which the<br>
voltage direction of grounding does not matter (e.g., devices such as lamps)<br>
can be connected across either the positive-ground auxiliary battery 80 on the<br>
low-side 58 or the negative-ground auxiliary battery 70 on the high-side 56.<br>
[0024| Ideally, the electrical loads 62, 72 are divided such that the power<br>
drawn by electrical loads 62 on the high-side 56 and electrical loads 72 on the<br>
low-side 58 is approximately the same (at least on an average basis).<br>
However, because it is impossible to predict the precise usage of the electrical<br>
devices that correspond to the electrical loads 62, 72, other embodiments of<br>
provide techniques for helping to regulate the charge and hence voltage<br>
maintained across each of the auxiliary low-voltage DC sources 70, 80. For<br>
example, if load 62 is a fan and load 72 is a radio module, and the driver is<br>
running the fan, but not listening to the radio, then the charge consumed from<br>
the negative-ground battery 70 on the high-side 56 would be much more than<br>
that consumed from the positive-ground battery 80 on the low-side 58. If this<br>
usage pattern continued on a regular basis, then a large charge imbalance<br>
could result in the auxiliary batteries 70. X0.<br>
|0025| As illustrated in FIG. 1, in accordance with this embodiment of the<br>
invention, the coupling entity 20d is provided that couples a neural point N of<br>
the two-phase AC induction motor 12 to node G of the VES 60. The coupling<br>
entity 20d can be a connector, wire or any other electrically conducting entity<br>
which can be used to electrically couple or connect two points to each other.<br>
By coupling the neutral point N of the two-phase AC induction motor 12 to<br>
the common node G of the VES 60 via the coupling entity 20d, the voltage on<br>
coupling entity 20d can be controlled to regulate the respective voltages<br>
maintained at the DC voltage sources 70, 80. The average voltage across each<br>
of the low-voltage DC sources 70, 80 over time is equal to one-hall" of the<br>
compound voltage (VIN) across the inverter module 30. To explain further, the<br>
voltage across each of the low-voltage DC sources 70, 80 fluctuates over time<br>
depending on the open/close state of switches (not shown) in the inverter sub-<br>
modules 35, 37 of the inverter module 30, but is, on average, equal to the<br><br><br>
voltage (V1N) supplied to the inverter module 30 (i.e.. halfway between the <br>
inputs to the inverter module 30). In other words, the voltage of the neutral<br>
wire 20d is maintained (on average) half-way between the voltage of the<br>
positive side of the high-side auxiliary battery 70 and the negative side of the<br>
low-side auxiliary battery 80. This prevents either one of the high-side<br>
auxiliary battery 70 and the low-side auxiliary battery 80 from completely<br>
discharging.<br>
[0026] The two-phase AC induction motor 12 performs a charge balancing<br>
function to maintain levels of charge stored at the DC voltage sources 70, 80<br>
at substantially the same levels regardless of usage of the DC voltage sources<br>
70, 80 by the respective load(s) 62, 72 that are coupled across each of the DC<br>
voltage sources 70. 80. As such, the respective voltages (Vbat) at the<br>
respective DC voltage sources 70, 80 are maintained at substantially the same<br>
levels regardless of usage. Thus, by coupling the neutral point N of the two-<br>
phase AC induction motor 12 to the common node G of the VES 60, the two-<br>
phase AC induction motor 12 can keep the DC voltage sources 70, 80 charge-<br>
balanced with respect to one another so that they remain at approximately the<br>
same state of charge.<br>
[0027] In particular, the closed loop motor controller 16 controls a<br>
sequence at which the switches (not shown) in inverter sub-modules 35, 37 are<br>
turned on such that the correct amounts of power are provided to the high-side<br>
56 and low-side 58 of the electrical system VES 60 to maintain the levels of<br>
charge stored at the DC voltage source 70 and at the DC voltage source SO at<br>
substantially the same levels regardless of usage of the electrical load(s) 62<br>
and the electrical load(s) 72 so that the respective voltages at each of the DC<br>
voltage source 70 and the DC voltage source 80 are maintained at substantially<br>
the same levels regardless of power consumed by the electrical load(s) 62 and<br>
the electrical load(s) 72, respectively. For example, in some operating<br>
conditions, the closed loop motor controller 16 controls the electromagnetic<br>
wave forms that are generated at the neutral point N away from a perfect<br>
balance during motoring, generating, or both, to draw less power from the<br><br><br>
particular one of the DC voltage source 70, 80 with the weaker state of charge<br>
and and/or to send more power to that same DC voltage source 70. For<br>
example, the switches in one of the inverter sub-modules 35 can be left on for<br>
a disproportion amount of time (in comparison to the other switches in the<br>
other inverter sub-module 37) without depleting the charge at one of the DC<br>
voltage source 70, 80. For example, low-side auxiliary DC voltage source 80<br>
still receives an appropriate amount of charge to keep it charged even though<br>
load 72 is consuming more energy/power than load 62. Thus, even when the<br>
buffered loads 62, 72 are not utilized in an equal manner by the operator of the<br>
vehicle, the DC voltage source s 70, 80 will remain balanced. By controlling<br>
the individual switches (not shown) in the inverter module 30 in an<br>
appropriate manner, the high-side auxiliary DC voltage source 70 and the low-<br>
side auxiliary DC voltage source 80 will remain at substantially balanced<br>
levels of charge. Thus, by connecting the neutral wire 20b between neutral<br>
point N of two-phase AC induction motor 12 and node G in the VES 60, both<br>
the high-side auxiliary DC voltage source 70 and low-side auxiliary DC<br>
voltage source 80 remain satisfactorily charged.<br>
[0028] Moreover, no extra circuitry or devices are needed between the<br>
high-side auxiliary DC voltage source 70 and low-side auxiliary DC voltage<br>
source 80 to manage the voltage (VIN') across these DC voltage source 70, SO<br>
(e.g., to make sure that one of the DC voltage source 70, 80 does not<br>
completely discharge). Thus, the need for a separate device which performs<br>
charge balancing between batteries high-side auxiliary DC voltage source 70,<br>
low-side auxiliary DC voltage source 80 is eliminated. This reduces or<br>
eliminates the need for additional electrical components or devices, which can<br>
be relatively expensive. Thus, a low-cost hybrid system is provided that is<br>
appropriate for low-cost small cars, while offering many of the benefits of<br>
more expensive hybrid systems in an optimized cost-benefit relationship.<br>
Small cars generate relatively low amounts of power during braking, so that an<br>
MGU using 24 volts can capture a majority of the braking energy in ordinarv<br><br><br>
driving with electrical currents that are within the capacity of typical starter<br>
cables.<br>
[0029| Although FIG. I describes an implementation where the MGU<br>
utilizes a two-phase AC induction motor, in other embodiments, the MGU<br>
may be any other type of AC motor with any number of phases. For example,<br>
the MGU may alternately use a permanent-magnet rotor, either with surface-<br>
mounted or internal magnets, a type of motor which is sometimes referred to<br>
as a "brushless DC motor," especially when the inverter uses relatively simple<br>
switching sequences. The MGU may utilize one or more windings on the<br>
rotor in addition to permanent magnets (e.g., Lundel alternator) or instead of<br>
permanent magnets (e.g., wound-rotor generator). The MGU may have a rotor<br>
which, instead of or in addition to permanent magnets, windings or a<br>
combination thereof, uses a rotor with iron or other material which is attracted<br>
by the rotating magnetic field from the stator (i.e., switched-reluctance or<br>
synchronous-reluctance). At the same time, the stator may be of any type<br>
known to those skilled in the art of electric motor design, including wire-<br>
wound construction with lap windings or wave windings or bar-wound<br>
construction.<br>
[0030] Of these, specific embodiments are described below with reference<br>
to FIGS. 2A-3, where the MGU utilizes a three-phase AC induction motor. In<br>
addition, while the embodiment of FIG. 1 is illustrated as including two<br>
inverter sub-modules 35, 37, in other embodiments such as those described<br>
below with reference to FIGS. 2A-3, the inverter module 30 may be any other<br>
type of inverter-controller unit (ICU) configuration (sometimes also referred<br>
to as variable frequency drive controller) and may include any other number of<br>
inverter sub-modules. For example, as described below with reference to FIG.<br>
2A and 2B, the inverter module 30 can be implemented as a full-wave bridge<br>
inverter that includes three inverter sub-modules 135, 137, 139, or, as<br>
described below with reference to FIG. 3, the inverter module 30 can be<br>
implemented as a delta inverter that also includes three simplified inverter<br>
sub-modules. Moreover, in other embodiments, such as those described below<br><br><br>
with reference to FIG. 3, more than two (2) auxiliary batteries can be provided<br>
and the electrical loads of the VES can be split into more than two (2) equal<br>
portions (e.g., three auxiliary batteries each handling one-third of the electrical<br>
loads and providing a combined DC voltage of 36 volts for use by the inverter<br>
module and MGU).<br>
[0031] FIGS. 2A and 2B are simplified block diagrams of a hybrid electric<br>
vehicle (HEV) power system 200 which can be implemented in a<br>
hybrid/electric vehicle (HEV) according to another exemplary implementation<br>
of the present invention. In these embodiments, the main difference is that the<br>
Motor/Generator Unit (MGU) is a three-phase AC motor 112 having three<br>
motor windings 20a, 20b, 20c, and the inverter-controller unit (ICU) the<br>
includes a closed loop motor controller 16 and an inverter module 30 includes<br>
a capacitor 133 and three inverter sub-modules 135, 137, 139. In this<br>
embodiment, inverter sub-module 135 is coupled to motor winding 20a,<br>
inverter sub-module 137 is coupled to motor winding 20b, and inverter sub-<br>
module 139 is coupled to motor winding 20c. The three-phase AC motor 112<br>
includes three motor windings A, B, C (20a, 20b, 20c) that are coupled<br>
together at a neutral point N. The current into motor winding A 20a flows out<br>
motor windings B 20b and C 20c, the current into motor winding B 20b flows<br>
out motor windings A 20a and C 20c, and the current into motor winding C<br>
20c flows out motor windings A 20a and B 20b.<br>
[0032] FIG. 2B illustrates further details of the three-phase AC motor 112<br>
and the inverter sub-modules 135, 137, 139 of FIG. 2A in accordance with one<br>
implementation. In FIG. 2B, the MGU includes a star-connected (or Y-<br>
connected) three-phase electric motor 112 (sometimes also referred to as a<br>
brushless direct current motor (BDCM)), and the inverter module 30 is a full-<br>
wave bridge inverter 130.<br>
[0033] The star-connected three-phase motor 112 includes a permanent<br>
magnet rotor 16, and three stator windings 20a, 20b, and 20c connected in a<br>
wye-configuration between motor terminals A, B, and C. Phase currents la,<br><br><br>
lb, and Ic flow through respective stator windings 20a, 20b, and 20c. The<br>
phase to neutral voltages across each of the stator windings 20a-20c are<br>
respectively designated as Van, Vbn, Vcn, with the back EMF voltages<br>
generated in each of the stator windings 20a-20c respectively shown as the<br>
voltages Ea, Fb, and Ec produced by ideal voltage sources each respectively<br>
shown connected in series with stator windings 20a-20c. As is well known,<br>
these back EMF voltages Ea, Eb, and Ec are the voltages induced in the<br>
respective stator windings 20a-20c by the rotation of permanent magnet rotor<br>
18. Although not necessary for all applications, the motor 112 is also shown<br>
equipped with a rotor position sensor 22, which provides an output rotor<br>
position signal Øm representing the mechanical rotational angular position of<br>
rotor 16 relative to the stator windings 20a-20c. Position sensor 22 can be a<br>
Hall Effect sensor, or any other type position encoder known in the art. Those<br>
skilled in the art will recognize that other techniques exist for determining the<br>
angular position of rotor 18. without the use of a rotor position sensor 22 (see<br>
for example, U.S. Patent Number. 5,949,204 issued to Huggett et al.) The<br>
motor 112 is coupled to an internal combustion engine (ICE) via a drive shaft<br>
192.<br>
[0034] The full-wave bridge inverter 130 includes a capacitor 133, a first<br>
inverter sub-module 35 comprising a dual switch 24/36, 26/38, a second<br>
inverter sub-module 37 comprising a dual switch 28/40, 30/42, and a third<br>
inverter sub-module 39 comprising a dual switch 32/44, 34/46. As such, full-<br>
wave bridge inverter 130 has six solid state switching devices 24, 26, 28, 30,<br>
32, 34 and six diodes 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46 to appropriately switch compound<br>
voltage (VIN) and provide three-phase energization of the stator windings 20a,<br>
20b, 20c of BDCM 112 (sec for example, U.S. Patent No. 4,544.868 issued<br>
October 1, 1985 to Murty. and assigned to the same assignee as the present<br>
application).<br><br><br>
[00351 The closed loop motor controller 16 or "control unit'" receives<br>
motor command signals 50 and motor operating signals 49 from the motor<br>
112, and generates control signals 52 for controlling the switching of solid<br>
state switching devices 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34 within the inverter sub-modules<br>
135, 137, 139. By providing appropriate control signals 52 to the individual<br>
inverter sub-modules 135, 137, 139, the closed loop motor controller 16<br>
controls switching of solid state switching devices 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34<br>
within those inverter sub-modules 135, 137, 139 and thereby control the<br>
outputs of the inverter sub-modules 135, 137, 139 that are provided to motor<br>
windings 20a, 20b, respectively.<br>
[0036] In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, a<br>
coupling entity 20d is provided that connects a neutral point N of the motor<br>
112 to node G of the VES 60, which is at ground potential. In this<br>
embodiment, node G is connected to the chassis such that the two low-voltage<br>
DC sources 70, 80 share a common ground. The DC voltage sources 70, 80<br>
are coupled together in series at a common node G such that the voltage<br>
sources 70, 80 generate a compound voltage (VIN) equal to a sum of the<br>
voltage (Vbat) of the low-side DC voltage source 80 and the voltage (Vbat) of<br>
the high-side DC voltage source 70. This compound voltage (VIN) can be used<br>
not only for powering the electrical loads, but also for powering the ICU 130<br>
thereby eliminating the need for a separate non-auxiliary battery that is<br>
commonly used in HEVs.<br>
|0037| As illustrated in FIGS. 2A and 2B, in accordance with this<br>
embodiment of the invention, the coupling entity 20d couples a neural point N<br>
of the motor 112 to node G of the VES 60. The voltage on the coupling entity<br>
20d fluctuates over time depending on the open/close state of switches 24, 26,<br>
28, 30, 32, 34 in the inverter sub-modules 135, 137, 139 of the inverter<br>
module 130. However, on average, the voltage on the coupling entity 20d is<br>
equal to the voltage (VIN) across inverter module 130 (i.e., halfway between<br>
the +,- inputs to the inverter module 130). This prevents either one of the<br><br><br>
high-side auxiliary battery 70 and the low-side auxiliary battery 80 from<br>
completely discharging.<br>
[0038] The motor 112 performs a charge balancing function to maintain<br>
levels of charge stored at the DC voltage sources 70, 80 at substantially the<br>
same levels regardless of usage of the DC voltage sources 70, 80 by the<br>
respective load(s) 62, 72 that are coupled across each of the DC voltage<br>
sources 70. 80. By coupling the neutral point N of the motor 112 to the<br>
common node G of the VHS 60. the motor 112 can keep the DC voltage<br>
sources 70, 80 charge-balanced with respect to one another so that they remain<br>
at approximately the same state of charge. As such, the respective voltages<br>
(Vbat) at the respective DC voltage sources 70, 80 are maintained at<br>
substantially the same levels regardless of usage.<br>
[0039] The closed loop motor controller 16 controls a sequence at which<br>
the switches 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34 in inverter modules 135, 137, 139 are<br>
turned on such that the correct amounts of energy are provided to the high-side<br>
56 and low-side 58 of the electrical system VES 60 to maintain the levels of<br>
charge stored at the DC voltage source 70 and at the DC voltage source 80 at<br>
substantially the same levels regardless of usage of the electrical load(s) 62<br>
and the electrical load(s) 72 so that the respective voltages at each of the DC<br>
voltage sources 70, 80 are maintained at substantially the same levels<br>
regardless of power consumed by the electrical load(s) 62, 72, respectively.<br>
For example, in some operating conditions, the closed loop motor controller<br>
16 controls the electromagnetic wave forms that are generated at the neutral<br>
point N away from a perfect balance during motoring, generating, or both, to<br>
draw less power from the particular one of the DC voltage source 70, 80<br>
having the weaker state of charge and/or to send more power to that same DC<br>
voltage source 70. For example, the switches in one sub-module of the inverter<br>
module 130 can be left on for a disproportion amount of time (in comparison<br>
to the other switches in the other inverter sub-modules of the inverter module<br>
130) without depleting the charge at one of the DC voltage source 70, 80. For<br>
example, in one scenario, the low-side auxiliary DC voltage source 80 will<br><br><br>
still receive an appropriate amount of charge to keep it charged even though<br>
load 72 is consuming more energy/power than load 62. Thus, even when the<br>
buffered loads 62, 72 are not utilized in an equal manner by the operator of the<br>
vehicle, the DC voltage sources 70, 80 will remain balanced. By controlling<br>
the individual switches in the inverter module 130 in an appropriate manner,<br>
the high-side auxiliary DC voltage source 70 and the low-side auxiliary DC<br>
voltage source 80 will remain at a near optimal level of charge. Thus, by<br>
connecting the neutral wire 20b between neutral point N of motor 112 and<br>
node G in the VES 60, both the high-side auxiliary DC voltage source 70 and<br>
low-side auxiliary DC voltage source 80 remain satisfactorily charged.<br>
(00401 As with the embodiment in FIG. 1, no extra circuitry or devices are<br>
needed between the high-side auxiliary DC voltage source 70 and low-side<br>
auxiliary DC voltage source 80 to manage the voltage (\'i\) across these DC<br>
voltage source 70, 80 and perform a charge balancing between high-side<br>
auxiliary DC voltage source 70, low-side auxiliary DC voltage source 80. By<br>
eliminating the need for additional electrical components or devices, a very<br>
low cost hybrid system is provided that offers many of the benefits of more<br>
expensive hybrid systems.<br>
[0041 j When AC electric motors are used as a means for propulsion in<br>
HEVs, the capacity of the motors and inverters must be substantial due to the<br>
large power requirements. In such applications, the inverters can represent a<br>
significant portion of the cost, mass, and packaging size of the HEV<br>
propulsion system. In addition, the reliability of control devices using such<br>
inverters is inversely related to the required number of solid state s\vitehin»<br>
devices and diodes in the inverter. Accordingly, it would be advantageous in<br>
some embodiments if fewer solid state switching devices and diodes could be<br>
employed in the fabrication of power inverters in control devices used for<br>
driving the AC electric motor. In accordance with embodiments of the present<br>
invention illustrated in FIG. 3, a three-phase AC induction motor 113 like that<br>
in FIGS. 2A and 2B is provided that is driven by a delta-type inverter module,<br>
which employs only one-half the solid state switching devices 112, 114, 116<br><br><br>
and diodes 124, 126, 128 required in a conventional full-wave bridge type<br>
inverter module as described, for example, in FIG. 2B.<br>
[0042] FIG. 3 is a simplified block diagram of a hybrid electric vehicle<br>
(HEV) power system 300 which can be implemented in a hybrid/electric<br>
vehicle (HEV) according to one exemplary implementation of the present<br>
invention. The HEV power system 300 includes a Motor/Generator Unit<br>
(MGU) that includes a three-phase AC induction motor 113, an inverter-<br>
controller unit (ICU) comprising a closed loop motor controller 16 and a delta<br>
inverter module 102. a plurality of DC voltage sources 1 18. 120. 122 and a<br>
Vehicle Electrical System (VES) that includes a pluraliK of electrical loads<br>
162., 172, 182. Although not illustrated, the three-phase AC induction motor<br>
113 is coupled to an ICE via a drive shaft. Different vehicle electrical loads<br>
162, 172, 182 are provided with independent, auxiliary, low-voltage DC<br>
sources 118, 120, 122 (e.g., 12 volt batteries) while eliminating the need<br>
additional devices or circuits to manage or control the voltage of the multiple<br>
low-voltage DC sources 118, 120, 122. As above, the electrical loads 162,<br>
172, 182 can generally represent any module and/or sub-module which is<br>
driven by or consumes power from the auxiliary low-voltage DC sources 118,<br>
120, 122. Vehicle electrical loads 162. 172, 182 can be split into different<br>
groups, and each of these groups is coupled to its own auxiliary low-voltage<br>
DC sources 118, 120, 122 such that the loads are '-split" into separate<br>
electrical circuits. Specifically, in this embodiment, three auxiliary low-<br>
voltage DC sources 118, 120, 122 are implemented so that the electrical loads<br>
162, 172, 182 can be separated into groups and powered separately.<br>
[0043] The delta inverter module 102 is illustrated in the dotted-line<br>
triangle, and includes three inverter sub-modules 112/124, 114/128, 116/126.<br>
To supply power to the delta inverter module 102, a DC voltage source 118 is<br>
coupled between the inverter sub-modules 112/124, 116/126, another DC<br>
voltage source 120 is coupled between the inverter sub-modules 112/124,<br>
11 4/128, and another DC voltage source 122 is coupled between inverter sub-<br>
modules 114'128, 116-126. The delta inverter module 102 is coupled to the<br><br><br>
three-phase AC induction motor 113 via a bus (not illustrated). In this<br>
particular embodiment, because the MGU implements a three-phase AC<br>
induction motor 1 13, the ICU includes a three-phase delta inverter module 102<br>
that includes three inverter sub-modules 1 12/124, 1 14/128, 1 16. 126. In this<br>
embodiment, the inverter sub-modules 112/124, 114/128, 116/126 each<br>
comprise a switch (e.g., a field effect transistor (FET)) coupled in parallel with<br>
a diode. The inverter sub-modules 112/124, 114/128, 116/126 are coupled to<br>
motor windings A, B, C of three-phase AC induction motor 113 using any<br>
techniques or mechanism known in the art. The outputs generated by the<br>
inverter sub-modules are applied to motor windings A, B, C of the three-phase<br>
AC induction motor 113 to drive the three-phase AC induction motor 113.<br>
[0044] The DC voltage source 118 powers the first inverter sub-module<br>
112/124, DC voltage source 120 powers inverter sub-module 1 14/128, and DC<br>
voltage source 122 powers inverter sub-module 116/126. DC voltage source<br>
122 is also coupled to inverter sub-module I 14' 128 at a common node 108. In<br>
this embodiment, all segments of the delta inverter module 102 (and the loads<br>
162, 172, 182, supported by those segments) are electrically isolated from the<br>
chassis of the HEV. This helps prevent the DC voltage sources 118, 120, 122<br>
from being short-circuited to the chassis or structure of the vehicle by<br>
requiring that two connections be made to the chassis to establish the short-<br>
circuit. The charge and hence voltage is maintained across each of the<br>
auxiliary low-voltage DC sources 118, 120, 122 by varying the switching<br>
times of the transistors 112, 114, 116 while the MGU 113 is generating and<br>
motoring. In other words, charge balancing is achieved in this embodiment by<br>
biasing power from the MGU 113 when it is acting as a generator toward<br>
those segments of the delta inverter module 102 where applied loads 162, 172.<br>
182 are greater and by biasing power to the MGU 1 13 when it is acting as a<br>
motor away from those same segments.<br>
[0045] The DC voltage sources 118, 120, 122 can be implemented using<br>
any controllable DC voltage source, which in most cases, are low-voltage, 12<br>
volt car batteries. When each of the DC voltage sources 118, 120, 122 is a 12<br><br><br>
volt battery, the DC voltage sources 118, 120, 122 can provide, in aggregate,<br>
36 volts for driving the three-phase AC induction motor 113 (i.e., the<br>
compound voltage drop across the inverter module 102 is 36 volts in total).<br>
Thus, the auxiliary low-voltage DC sources 118, 120, 122 can together<br>
effectively provide a 36-volt battery for use by the inverter module 102 (and<br>
hence the three-phase AC induction motor 1 13) thereby eliminating the need<br>
for a high-voltage battery that is usually required in many HEVs to power the<br>
three-phase AC induction motor 113.<br>
[0046] The three-phase AC induction motor 113 that includes motor<br>
windings A, B, C. Motor winding A is coupled between inverter sub-module<br>
112/124 and DC voltage source 120 at node 106, motor winding B is coupled<br>
between inverter sub-module 114/128 and DC voltage source 122 at common<br>
node 108, and motor winding C is coupled between inverter sub-module<br>
116/126 and DC voltage source 118 at node 110. In this implementation, the<br>
current Ia into winding A flows out winding B and winding C as currents lb, Ic,<br>
respectively, the current lb into winding B flows out winding A and winding C<br>
as currents Ia, Ic, respectively, and the current Ic into winding C Hows out<br>
winding A and winding B as currents la. Ib, respectively.<br>
10047) In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in FIG. 3, the electrical<br>
loads 162, 172, 182 are split into three (3) equal portions (e.g., one-third each)<br>
by providing separate DC voltage sources 118, 120, 122 for each group of<br>
loads. The vehicle electrical loads 162, 172, 182 include a first electrical load<br>
162 (or first group of electrical loads) that is coupled to and supplied power by<br>
DC voltage source 118, a second electrical load 172 (or second group of<br>
electrical loads) that is coupled to and supplied power by DC voltage source<br>
120, and a third electrical load 182 (or group of electrical loads) is coupled to<br>
and supplied power by DC voltage source 122. The electrical loads 162, 172,<br>
182 are distributed so that the relative loads on each branch of the delta<br>
inverter module 102 are substantially equal to one another in the expected<br>
average current and power such that the DC voltage sources 1 18, 120, 122<br>
each power one-third of the total electrical loads supported by the VES.<br><br><br>
[0048] In this particular embodiment, the low-voltage DC voltage source<br>
118 is coupled in parallel with a capacitor 163, a non-buffered load 168, a<br>
buffer filter 165, and an electrical load 162, which can either a single electrical<br>
load or a group of different electrical loads. The non-buffered load 168 and<br>
buffer filter 165 are optional components. When implemented, the buffer<br>
filter 165 performs a buffering function between the electrical load 162 and<br>
the non-buffered load 168 to ensure that sudden or short-term voltage drops at<br>
the DC voltage source 118 do not significantly impact voltage at the electrical<br>
load 162. In one exemplary implementation, the buffer filter 165 comprises a<br>
diode 166 and a capacitor 164 that takes time to charge up and temporarily<br>
holds the voltage across load 162 at its current level. The capacitor 164 helps<br>
to ensure that the voltage across load 162 will not change dramatically when<br>
there is a voltage change, for example, across the DC voltage source 118. The<br>
other branches can include similar capacitor 173, 183, and buffering circuitry<br>
175/178, 185/188, respectively.<br>
|0049J The closed loop motor controller 16 or "control unit" receives<br>
motor command signals 50 and motor operating signals 49 from the three-<br>
phase AC induction motor 113, and generates control signals 52 for<br>
controlling the switching of switches Si, S2, S3 within the inverter sub-<br>
modules 112/124, 114/128, 116/126. By providing appropriate control signals<br>
52 to the individual inverter sub-modules 112/124, 114/128, 116/126, the<br>
closed loop motor controller 16 controls switching of switches (not illustrated)<br>
within those inverter sub-modules 112/124, 114/128, 116/126 and thereby<br>
control the outputs of the inverter sub-modules 112/124, 114/128, 116/126 that<br>
are provided to motor windings A, B, C, respectively.<br>
[0050] In particular, the closed loop motor controller 16 controls the<br>
timing of the switches 112, 1 14. 116 in the inverter module 102 to ensure that<br>
the amount of power supplied to each load is. on average, balanced so that the<br>
DC voltage sources 118, 120, 122 can be kept at relatively the same charge<br>
despite differing usage of the loads 162, 172, 182 across each of the DC<br>
voltage sources 118, 120, 122. The closed loop motor controller 16 controls a<br><br><br>
sequence at which the switches in inverter sub-modules 112 124, 114 128.<br>
116/126 are turned on such that the correct amounts of energy are provided to<br>
maintain the levels of charge stored at the DC voltage sources 118, 120, 122 at<br>
substantially the same levels regardless of usage of the electrical load(s) 162,<br>
172, 182 so that the respective voltages at each of the DC voltage sources 118,<br>
120, 122 are maintained at substantially the same levels regardless of power<br>
consumed by the electrical load(s) 162, 172, 182. For example, in some<br>
operating conditions, the closed loop motor controller 16 controls the<br>
electromagnetic wave forms that are generated within the three-phase AC<br>
induction motor 113 away from a perfect balance during motoring, generating,<br>
or both, to draw less power from the particular one of the DC voltage sources<br>
118, 120, 122 with the weaker state of charge and/or to send more power to<br>
that same DC voltage source 118, 120, 122. For example, in one operating<br>
scenario where the usage of load(s) 162 is greater than the usage of load(s)<br>
172, 182, the switch 112 in the inverter sub-module 112/124 can then be left<br>
on for a disproportion amount of time (in comparison to the other switches<br>
114, 116 in the other inverter sub-modules 114/128, 116/126) without<br>
depleting the charge at one of the DC voltage source 118, 120, 122. For<br>
example, auxiliary DC voltage source 118 still receives an appropriate amount<br>
of charge to keep it charged even though load 162 is consuming more<br>
energy/power than loads 172, 182. Thus, by controlling the individual<br>
switches 112, 114, 116 in the inverter module 102 in an appropriate manner,<br>
the charge levels of the auxiliary DC voltage sources 118. 120. 122 will<br>
remain balanced even when the buffered loads 162, 172, 182 are not utilized<br>
in an equal manner by the operator of the vehicle.<br>
