FORWARD CLUTCH HIGH PRESSURE HOLDING VALVE FOR HYBRID<br>
VEHICLES TO ENABLE ENGINE START-STOP-DRIVE FUNCTIONS<br>
FIELD<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to hybrid vehicles, and more<br>
specifically to transmissions for hybrid vehicles.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0003] Internal combustion engines produce drive torque that is<br>
transferred to a drivetrain. The drive torque is transferred through a<br>
transmission that multiplies the drive torque by a gear ratio. Transmissions<br>
generally include multiple gear ratios through which the drive torque is<br>
transferred. Automatic transmissions automatically shift between gear ratios<br>
based on driver input and vehicle operating conditions. Traditionally,<br>
automatic transmissions include a forward clutch and a reverse clutch for<br>
actuation between forward and reverse driving conditions through the use of a<br>
pressurized hydraulic fluid. The hydraulic fluid is typically pressurized during<br>
operation of the engine.<br>
[0004] Hybrid powertrains typically include an electric machine and<br>
an energy storage device (ESD) such as battery or super capacitor. In one<br>
mode, the electric machine drives the transmission using energy stored in the<br>
ESD. In another mode, the electric machine is driven by the engine to charge<br>
the ESD. When operated in the first mode, the hybrid vehicle may be<br>
operated without the use of the engine. When operated without the use of the<br>
engine, an auxiliary pressurizing mechanism, such as an electric pump, is<br>
typically used to pressurize the hydraulic transmission fluid to provide for<br>
engagement of the forward clutch.<br><br>
2<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0005] Accordingly, a transmission for a hybrid vehicle including a<br>
combustion engine and an electric propulsion system may include a forward<br>
clutch assembly, a fluid chamber, a fluid supply, and a forward clutch holding<br>
valve. The forward clutch assembly may include a hydraulically actuated<br>
clutch member in communication with the fluid chamber. The forward clutch<br>
holding valve may be in communication with the fluid chamber and the fluid<br>
supply. The valve may provide communication between the fluid supply and<br>
the fluid chamber when in a first position and may seal the fluid chamber<br>
when in a second position, thereby maintaining a fixed quantity of fluid within<br>
the fluid chamber.<br>
[0006] Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the<br>
description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and<br>
specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0013] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and<br>
is not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses. For<br>
purposes of clarity, the same reference numbers will be used in the drawings<br>
to identify similar elements. As used herein, the term module refers to an<br>
application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a processor<br>
(shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that execute one or more software<br>
or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit, or other suitable<br>
components that provide the described functionality.<br>
[0014] Referring now to Figure 1, an exemplary hybrid vehicle 10 is<br>
schematically illustrated. The hybrid vehicle 10 includes a combustion engine<br>
12 and an electric machine 14, which selectively drive a transmission 16.<br>
Drive torque may be transmitted from engine 12 and/or electric machine 14 to<br>
transmission 16 through a coupling device 18. Transmission 16 may be an<br>
automatic transmission and coupling device 18 may include a torque<br>
converter.<br>
[0015] Hybrid vehicle 10 may be operable in first and second<br>
modes. Control module 20 may be in communication with and may receive<br>
and send control signals to engine 12 and transmission 16 to control<br>
operation thereof in the first and second modes. In a first mode of operation,<br>
engine 12 may be operated, providing drive toque for hybrid vehicle 10 and/or<br>
charging of electric machine 14. In the second mode, engine 12 may be<br>
powered off. In the second mode, drive torque for hybrid vehicle 10 may be<br>
provided solely by electric machine 14. Whether operating in the first or<br>
second modes, drive torque is transmitted to transmission 16 in order to drive<br>
hybrid vehicle 10.<br>
[0016] With additional reference to Figure 2, a functional block<br>
diagram of transmission 16 is illustrated. Transmission 16 may include a fluid<br>
source 22 providing hydraulic fluid for transmission 16. Fluid source 22 may<br><br>
4<br>
include) a pumping mechanism powered by engine 12 for pressurizing the<br>
hydraulic transmission fluid for actuation of transmission 16, as discussed<br>
below. Fluid source 22 may be in communication with a control valve 24 and<br>
a locking valve 26. Control valve 24 may be in fluid communication with a<br>
forward clutch regulator valve 28 and a reverse clutch regulator valve 30.<br>
Control valve 24 may provide selective communication between fluid source<br>
22 and the forward and reverse clutch regulator valves 28, 30. Transmission<br>
16 may be actuated between forward, reverse, and neutral conditions by the<br>
pressurized hydraulic fluid provided by fluid source 22 during operation of<br>
engine 12. More specifically, forward and reverse clutch regulator valves 28,<br>
30 may be in fluid communication with forward and reverse clutch assemblies<br>
32, 34. Selectively providing the pressurized hydraulic fluid to forward and<br>
reverse clutch assemblies 32, 34 allows actuation between the forward,<br>
reverse, and neutral conditions.<br>
[0017] A forward clutch holding valve 36 may be disposed between<br>
and in fluid communication with forward clutch regulator valve 28 and forward<br>
clutch assembly 32. Locking valve 26 may also be in fluid communication<br>
with forward clutch holding valve 36, as discussed below. With additional<br>
reference to Figures 3 and 4, forward clutch holding valve 36 may include a<br>
valve housing 38 containing a valve 40 therein. Valve housing 38 may<br>
include an inlet port 42, an outlet port 44, and first and second valve actuation<br>
ports 46, 48. An inner bore 50 may include first and second portions 52, 54<br>
housing valve 40 therein.<br>
[0018] Valve 40 may include a central portion 56 having first and<br>
second portions 58, 60 extending therefrom. Central portion 56 may be<br>
disposed in bore second portion 54 and may have an outer diameter generally<br>
corresponding to the inner diameter of bore second portion 54. Valve first<br>
portion 58 may be disposed in bore first portion 52 and may have an outer<br>
diameter generally corresponding to the inner diameter of bore first portion 52.<br>
The outer diameter of valve first portion 58 may be less than the outer<br><br>
5<br>
diameter of valve central portion 56 creating an annular surface 62 on a first<br>
side of central portion 56. Valve second portion 60 may have an outer<br>
diameter that is less than the outer diameter of valve central portion 56<br>
creating an annular surface 64 on a second side of central portion 56. A<br>
biasing member 66, such as a spring, may extend between a first end 68 of<br>
bore second portion 54 and valve annular surface 64. The outer diameter of<br>
valve second portion 60 may be less than the outer diameter of valve first<br>
portion 58. As such, annular surface 64 on the second side of central portion<br>
56 may have a greater surface area than annular surface 62. First end 68 of<br>
bore second portion 54 may act as a first stop for valve 40, as discussed<br>
below.<br>
[0019] Valve housing inlet port 42 may extend into bore first portion<br>
52. A flow path 70 may extend from an end 72 of bore first portion 52 to outlet<br>
port 44. End 72 may act as a second stop for valve 40, as discussed below.<br>
First and second valve actuation ports 46, 48 may extend into bore second<br>
portion 54.<br>
[0020] Forward clutch assembly 32 may include a hydraulic<br>
chamber 74, a clutch piston 76, and a series of clutch plates 78. Hydraulic<br>
chamber 74 may be in communication with clutch piston 76. Clutch piston 76<br>
may be operably coupled to clutch plates 78 for selective engagement<br>
thereof, as discussed below. A first fluid path 80 extends between hydraulic<br>
chamber 74 and valve housing outlet port 44. A second fluid flow path 82<br>
extends between inlet port 42 and forward clutch regulator valve 28 and a<br>
third fluid flow path 84 extends between first valve actuation port 46 and<br>
forward clutch regulator valve 28. A fourth fluid flow path 86 extends between<br>
second valve actuation port 48 and locking valve 26.<br>
[0021] With additional reference to Figure 5, flow chart 100<br>
generally shows the operation of transmission 16. As indicated in step 110,<br>
engine 12 is initially operated to allow for pressurization of fluid source 22, as<br>
discussed above. Transmission 16 may then provide for a forward drive<br><br>
6<br>
condition by providing pressurized fluid from forward clutch holding valve 36.<br>
As indicated at step 112, forward clutch holding valve 36 may be opened to<br>
provide for engagement of forward clutch assembly 32, as indicated at step<br>
114.<br>
[0022] More specifically, as seen in Figure 3, valve 40 may be<br>
displaced to an open position, allowing fluid communication between inlet port<br>
42 and outlet port 44. Valve 40 may be displaced to the open position by<br>
pressurized fluid provided by forward clutch regulator valve 28 entering valve<br>
housing 38 at first valve control port 46 and acting upon annular surface 62 of<br>
valve 40. The force created by the pressurized fluid may be greater than that<br>
applied by biasing member 66, resulting in the opening of forward clutch<br>
holding valve 36. Pressurized fluid may therefore travel through first fluid path<br>
80 and into hydraulic chamber 74, where it acts upon clutch piston 76, urging<br>
clutch plates 78 into engagement.<br>
[0023] As indicated at step 116, and seen in Figure 4, forward<br>
clutch holding valve 36 may be closed. Operation of hybrid vehicle 10 may<br>
then be operated in an engine-off condition while maintaining engagement of<br>
the forward clutch assembly without the use of an auxiliary fluid pump or fluid<br>
source. Forward clutch holding valve 36 may be closed before the engine-off<br>
condition to maintain fluid pressure in hydraulic chamber 74. More<br>
specifically, locking valve 26 may provide pressurized fluid to bore second<br>
portion 54, resulting in a force being applied on annular surface 64 of valve<br>
central portion 56. The combination of the force applied by the pressurized<br>
fluid on annular surface 64 and the force applied by biasing member 66 may<br>
be greater than the force applied by the pressurized fluid acting upon annular<br>
surface 62, resulting in displacement of valve 40 to the closed position.<br><br>
7<br>
[0024] When in the closed position (seen in Figure 4), valve first<br>
portion 58 abuts bore end 72, sealing outlet port 44 from inlet port 42. As<br>
such, hydraulic chamber 74 is in a sealed condition, where fluid neither exits<br>
nor enters, resulting in a generally constant pressure being applied to clutch<br>
piston 76. The pressure in hydraulic chamber 74 is sufficient for engagement<br>
of clutch plates 78 by clutch piston 76 when hydraulic chamber 74 is sealed.<br>
Therefore, clutch plates 78 remain in an engaged condition when hydraulic<br>
chamber 74 is sealed.<br>
[0025] As indicated at step 118, engine 12 may then be powered off<br>
resulting in the pressure provided by locking valve 26 and forward clutch<br>
regulator valve 28 being greatly reduced. When in the engine-off condition,<br>
valve 40 may be held in the closed position through the force applied by<br>
biasing member 66 maintaining engagement of the forward clutch assembly<br>
32, as indicated at step 120. As such, forward clutch engagement may be<br>
maintained in hybrid vehicle 10 without the use of an auxiliary source of<br>
pressurized fluid.<br>
[0026] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the<br>
foregoing description that the broad teachings of the present disclosure can<br>
be implemented in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this disclosure has<br>
been described in connection with particular examples thereof, the true scope<br>
of the disclosure should not be so limited since other modifications will<br>
become apparent to the skilled practitioner upon a study of the drawings, the<br>
