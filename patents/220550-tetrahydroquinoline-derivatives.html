Tetrahydroquinoline derivatives<br>
fhe invention relates to a compound having FSH receptor modulatory activity, in )articular a tetrahydroquinoline derivative, to a pharmaceutical composition containing he same, as well as the use of said compound in medical therapy.<br>
Gonadotropins serve important functions in a variety of bodily functions including metabolism, temperature regulation and the reproductive process. Gonadotropins act on specific gonadal cell types to initiate ovarian and testicular differentiation and steroidogenesis. The hypophyseal gonadotropin FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) for example plays a pivotal role in the stimulation of follicle development and maturation whereas LH (luteinizing hormone) induces ovulation (Sharp, R.M. Clin Endocrinol. 33:787-807, 1990; Dorrington and Armstrong, Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 35:301-342,1979). Currently, FSH is applied clinically, in combination with LH or hCG, for ovarian stimulation i.e. ovarian hyperstimulation for in vitro fertilisation (TVF) and induction of ovulation in infertile anovulatory women (Insler, V., Int. J. Fertility 33:85-97,1988, Navot andRosenwaks, J. Vitro Fert. Embryo Transfer 5:3-13,1988), as well as for male hypogonadism and male infertility.<br>
The gonadotropin FSH is released from the anterior pituitary under the influence of gonadotropin-releasing hormone and oestrogens, and from the placenta during pregnancy. In the female, FSH acts on the ovaries promoting development of follicles and is the major hormone regulating secretion of oestrogens. In the male, FSH is responsible for the integrity of the seminiferous tubules and acts on Sertoli cells to support gametogenesis. Purified FSH is used clinically to treat infertility in females and for some types of failure of spermatogenesis in males. Gonadotropins destined for therapeutic purposes can be isolated from human urine sources and are of low purity (Morse et al, Amer. J. Reproduct Immunol, and Microbiology 17:143, 1988). Alternatively, they can be prepared as recombinant gonadotropins. Recombinant human FSH is available commercially and is being used in assisted reproduction (Olijve et al. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2:371,1996; Devroey et al. Lancet 339:1170, 1992).<br><br>
The actions of the FSH hormone are mediated by a specific plasma membrane receptor that is a member of the large family of G-proteio coupled receptors. These receptors consist of a single polypeptide with seven transmembrane domains and are able to interact with the Gs protein, leading e.g. to the activation of adenylate cyclase.<br>
The FSH receptor is a highly specific target in the ovarian follicle growth process and is exclusively expressed in the ovary. Blocking this receptor or inhibiting the signaling which is normally induced after FSH-mediated receptor activation will disturb follicle development and thus ovulation and fertility. Low molecular weight FSH antagonists could therefore form the basis for new contraceptives. Such FSH antagonists could give rise to diminished follicle development (no ovulation) with still sufficient estrogen production left to avoid adverse effects on e.g. bone mass. On the other hand, compounds that stimulate FSH receptor activity may serve to mimic the gonadotropic effect of the natural ligand.<br>
The present invention describes the preparation of low molecular weight hormone analogs that selectively have modulatory activity on the FSH receptor. The compounds of the invention can either be used as (partial) agonists or (partial) antagonists of the FSH-receptor.<br>
Thus, it has now been found, that the following class of tetrahydroquinoline compounds of formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, have FSH-modulatory activity:<br><br><br>
wherein<br>
R1 and R2 are H or Me;<br>
R3    is   H,    hydroxy,    (l-4C)alkoxy,    (di)(l-4C)alkylamino(2-4C)alkoxy    or   (2-<br>
6)heterocycloalkyl(2-4C)alkoxy;<br>
R4 is H, OH, (1 -4C)alkoxy or R7;<br>
R5 is H, OH, (l-4C)alkoxy or R7;<br>
with the proviso that if R4 is H, R5 is not H, OH or (l-4C)alkoxy and that if R5 is H, R4<br>
is not H, OH or (l-4C)alkoxy;<br>
R6 is (2-5C)heteroaryl, (6C)aryl,  (3-8C)cycloalkyl, (2-6C)heterocycloalkyl or (1-<br>
6C)alkyl;<br>
R7 is amino, (di)(l-4C)alkylamino, (6C)arylcarbonylamino, (6C)arylcarbonyloxy, (2-<br>
5C)heteroarylcarbonylamino, (2-5C)heteroarylcarbonyloxy, Rs-(2-4C)alkylamino, R8-<br>
(2-4C)alkoxy, R9-methylamino or R9-methoxy;<br>
R8 is hydroxy, amino, (1-4C)alkoxy, (di)(l-4C)aIkylamino, (2-6C)heterocycloalkyl, (2-<br>
6C)heterocycloalkylcarbonylamino,     (di)(l-4C)alkylaminocarbonylamino     or     (1 -<br>
4C)alkoxycarbonylamino and<br>
R9 is aminocarbonyl, (di)(l-4C)alkylaminocarbonyl, (2-5C)heteroaryl or (6C)aryl.<br>
R4 and R5 can independently be selected form each of the groups mentioned and need not be the same.<br>
The compounds according to the present invention modulate the FSH receptor function and can be used for the same clinical purposes as native FSH if they behave like agonists, with the advantage that they display altered stability properties and may be<br><br>
administered differently. If they block the FSH receptor they can be used e.g. as a contraceptive agent.<br>
Thus, the FSH-receptor modulators of the present invention may be used for treating infertility, for contraception and for treatment of hormone-dependent disorders such as breast cancer, prostate cancer, and endometriosis.<br>

Suitable methods for the preparation of the compounds of the invention are outlined below.<br><br><br>
The compounds of the present invention in which R4 and R5 are (l-4C)alkoxy, R1 and R" are methyl and R is as previously defined can be prepared starting from appropriately substituted anilines of general formula n, by means of the well-documented Sfcraup reaction, which yields 2,2,4-trimethyl-1,2-dihydroquinoline derivatives of formula m-a.<br>
Related Skraup cyclocondensations are found in literature: A. Knoeyenagel, Chem. Ber. 54:1726, 1921; R.L. Atkins and D.E. Bliss, J. Org. Chem. 43:1975, 1978; J.V. Johnson, B.S. Rauckman, D.P. Baccanari and B. Roth, J. Med. Chem. 32:1942, 1989; W.C. Lin, S.-T. Huang and S.-T. Lin, J. Chin. Chem. Soc. 43:497, 1996; J.P. Edwards, S.J. West, K.B. Marschke, D.E. Mais, M.M. Gottardis and T\K Jones, J. Med. Chem. 41:303,1998.<br>
The abovementioned reaction is typically conducted at elevated temperature in acetone or mesityl oxide in the presence of iodine or protic acid such as hydrochloric acid,p-toluenesulfonic acid or aqueous hydrogen iodide. Alternatively, l,2-dihydro-2,2,4-trimethylquinolines of formula Ill-a can be prepared by reacting the corresponding aniline of formula II with acetone in the presence of MgSC&gt;4, 4-tert-butylcatechol and iodine (L.G. Hamann, R.I. Higuchi, L. Zhi, J.P. Edwards and X.-N. Wang, J. Med. Chem, 41:623, 1998). In yet another procedure, the reaction can be performed in acetone using lanthanide triflates (e.g. scandium triflatej as catalysts. In this case, the reaction can be run at room temperature or at elevated temperatures using conventional heating or microwave irradiation (M. E. Theoclitou and L. A. Robinson, Tetrahedron Lett. 43:3907,2002).<br>
Starting materials can be either obtained directly from commercial sources or easily prepared by those skilled in the art.<br>
Compounds of formula III-b can be prepared from anilines of general formula II by reaction with methyl vinyl ketone. Related cyclizations are described in Untited States Patent 2,686,182 (Badische Anilin- &amp; Soda-Fabrik Aktiengesellschaft).<br>
Subsequent 1-iV-acetylation of compounds of formula ni-a-b wherein R1, and R2 are as previously defined, can be carried out using standard conditions. In a typical experiment, compounds of formula HI are heated under reflux in acetic anhydride or reacted in a solvent such as dichloromethane, tetrahydroftrran, toluene or pyridine with<br><br>
acetyl chloride in the presence of a base such as iV,iV-diisopropylethylamine, triethylamine or sodium hydride to give JV-acetylated 4-methyl-l,2-dihydroquinoline derivatives of formula W-a-b.<br>
Related JV-acylations of a dihydroquinoline scaffold are found in literature: G. Reddelien and A. Thurm, Chem. Ber, 65:1511, 1932; Zh. V. Shmyreva, Kh. S. Shikhaliev and E.B. Shpanig, Izv. Vyssh. Uchebn. Zaved., Khim. Khim. Tekhnol. 31:45, 1988; Zh. V. Shmyreva, Kh. S. Shikhaliev, L.P. Zalukaev, Y.A. Ivanov, Y.S. Ryabokobylko and I.E. Pokrovskaya, Zh. Obshch. Khim. 59:1391,1989.<br>
Introduction of the requisite (substituted) phenyl group at position 4 of the dihydroquinoline scaffold can be accomplished via Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene or an appropriately substituted benzene with the compounds of general structure IV-a-b. This reaction is typically conducted at elevated temperatures either in neat benzene or the appropriately substituted benzene or in an appropriate inert solvent such as heptane or hexane with benzene or the appropriately substituted benzene as reagent, under catalysis of a Lewis acid (e.g. AICI3, AlBr^FeCh or SnCLO. Friedel-Crafts alkylations with 2,2,4-trimethyl-l,2-dihydroquinolines are described in literature by B.A. Lugovik, L.G. Yudin and A.N. Kost, Dokl. Akad. Nauk SSSR, 170:340, 1966; B.A. Lugovik, L.G. Yudin, S.M. Vinogradova and A.N. Kost, Khim. Geterosikl. Soedin, 7:795,1971.<br>
Alternatively, anilines of general structure II can be reacted with an appropriately substituted 1-methylstyrene derivative and formaldehyde in acetonitrile at ambient or elevated temperature to give compounds of general structure V-b. Related cyclizations are described in literature: J.M. Mellor and G.D. Merriman, Tetrahedron, 51:6115, 1995.<br>
Compounds of general structure V-a-b can then be nitrated regioselectively at position 6 of the tetrahydroquinoline scaffold to give compounds of general structure Vl-a-b. This reaction is typically conducted at temperatures in the range of-10 °C to room temperature in dichloromethane using a mixture of nitric acid and acetic anhydride as a nitrating reagent. Alternatively, nitric acid can be added to a solution of the compounds<br><br>
of general structure V-a-b in glacial acetic acid or in a mixture of acetic acid and dichloromethane. Related regioselective nitrations of tetrahydroquinolines are described in literature: B. Golankiewicz, Pol. J. Chem., 54:355, 1980; Zh. V. Shmyreva, Kh. S. Shikhaliev, L.P. Zalukaev, Y.A. Ivanov, Y.S. Ryabokobylko and I.E. Pokrovskaya, Zh. Obshch. Khim. 59:1391,1989.<br>
Reduction of the nitro group of the compounds of general structure VT-a-b can be accomplished by a large variety of methods well known in the art for the reduction of aromatic nitro compounds such as transition metal catalyzed hydrogenation, treatment with sulfides, treatment with iron or other metals and (mild) acid, treatment with tin dichloride under acidic conditions and the like. More specifically, the reduction of the nitro group of the compounds of general formula VT-a-b can be accomplished by treatment with zinc dust and acetic acid in THF or 1,4-dioxane in the temperature range of0°Ctol00°C.<br>
Subsequent 6-iV-acylation of compounds of formula Vll-a-b can be carried out using standard conditions, well known to those skilled in the art to give compounds of general structure I-a-b. For example, compounds of formula VH are reacted in a solvent such as dichloromethane, tetrahydrofiiran, toluene or pyridine with an acyl halide (R6-C(0)-C1) or acid anhydride (R6-C(0)-0-C(0)-R6) in the presence of a base<br><br><br>
such as iV,7V-diisopropylethylamine, triethylamine, pyridine or sodium hydride to give<br>
6-iV-acylated-l,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline derivatives of formula I-a-b. Alternatively,<br>
acylation of compounds of general formula Vll-a-b to give compounds of general<br>
formula I-a-b can also be accomplished by reaction with an appropriate carboxylic acid<br>
(R6-C02H) in the presence of a coupling reagent such as 0-(benzotriazol-l-yl)-<br>
NJM,N\N'-tetemeihyluxomxmy. tetrafluoroborate (TBTU), 0(7-azabenzotriazol-l-yl)-<br>
N,N,N ',N '-tetramethyluronium	hexafluorophosphate	(HATU)	or<br>
bromotripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBrOP) and a tertiary base, e.g. N,N -diisopropylethylamine, in a solvent such as JV^-dimethylformamide or dichloromethane at ambient or elevated temperature.<br>
Compounds of the present invention wherein R3 = H, OH or (l-4C)alkoxy, R4 = OH. . R5 = OH or (l-4C)alkoxy and R1, R2 and R6 are as previously described can be prepared by demethylation reactions of compounds of general formula I-c-d. Demetbylation reactions of aromatic methyl ethers are well known to those skilled in the art. In a typical experiment, demethylation is achieved upon reaction of a compound of formula I-c-d with BBr3 in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane at low to ambient temperature to give demethylated compounds of general formula I-e-i. Alternatively, demethylation can be accomplished upon reaction of compounds of formula I-c-d with BFs'Me^S complex at ambient temperature. The degree of demethylation can be controlled to some extent by carefully controlling the reaction temperature and amount of the demethylating reagent. Generally, mixtures of mono-, di- and, if relevant, trihydroxy compounds of general formula I-e-i are obtained, which can be separated by chromatography. The demethylation reaction generally proceeds with a moderate degree of selectivity, with preferential demethylation at position 5 of the tetrahydroquinoline scaffold. The reaction rate for demethylation (dealkylation) of compounds of general formula I-c-d is 5-OMe &gt; 4-(p-OAlk-phenyl) &gt; 7-OMe,<br>
Compounds of the present invention wherein R3 is H or a (fiinctionalised) alkoxy group and R4 and/or R5 are (fiinctionalised) alkoxy groups or acyloxy groups can be prepared by realkylation or acylation reactions of the hydroxyl groups of compounds of general<br><br>
formula I-e-i with (functionalised) alkyl halides (e.g. chloroethylpyrrolidine) or acyl halides (e.g. 2-fiiroyl chloride or methyl chloroformate), respectively, under standard conditions.<br>
The compounds of the present invention in which R4 = H and R5 is connected to the tetrahydroquinoline scaffold via a nitrogen atom and R , R~ and R are as previously defined can be prepared starting from JV-Boc-l,4-phenylene diamine (VIII). The reaction sequence (a) Skraup reaction, (b) acetylation and (c) Friedel- Crafts alkylation of benzene or a substituted benzene as described before leads to the formation of compounds of general formula X-a. It should be noted that the Boc-protective group is cleaved off under the reaction conditions of the Friedel-Crafts reaction.<br>
Alternatively, N-Boc-l,4-phenylene diamine can be treated with methyl vinyl ketone, followed by acetylation and Friedel-Crafts reaction as described before to give compounds of general formula X-b.<br><br>
In yet another procedure, compounds of general formula X-b can be obtained starting with the partial reduction of 4-methylquinoline (XI) with BH3THF complex and<br><br>
sodium bis(2-methoxy-ethoxy)alumiii"ura dihydride to give 4-methyl-1,2-<br>
dihydroquinoline, followed by acetylation as described before to give compound XII.<br>
Reductions of related quinolines to 1,2-dihydroquinolines are described in literature:<br>
see, for example: D. Roberts and J. A. Joule, J. Org. Chem. 62:568, 1997; R. F. Heier,<br>
L. A. Dolak, J. N. Duncan, D. K. Hyslop, M. F. Lipton, I. J. Martin, M. A. Mauragis,<br>
M. F. Piercey, N. F. Nichols, P. J. K. D. Schreur, M. W. Smith and M. W. Moon, J.<br>
Med. Chem. 40: 639, 1997. Friedel-Crafts reaction of XII with benzene or an<br>
appropriately substituted benzene gives compounds of general formula XIII, which can<br>
be converted to compounds of general formula X-b by the regioselective 6-nitration<br>
and reduction to the corresponding 6-amino derivative using previously described<br>
conditions. Regioselective nitration reactions on similar scaffolds have been reported in<br>
literature, see for example: Zh. V. Shmyreva et al., J. Gen. Chem. USSR (Engl. Transl.)<br>
59: 1234,1989.	*   *<br>
Compounds of general formula X-a-b can then be protected with the art known 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl group (Fmoc-group), see for example: T. W. Greene and P. M. Wuts, Protective groups in organic synthesis (3rd ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1999, see especially p. 506.). The abovementioned protection is conveniently carried out using FmocCl in THF with pyridine as a base.<br><br>
Regioselective nitration at position 7 of the tetrahydroquinoline scaffold of compounds of general formula XlV-a-b, followed by reduction of the uitro group (vide supra),<br><br>
gives 7-amino-l,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline derivatives of general formula XV-a-b. Regioselective nitrations on related scaffolds with a similar substitution pattern can be found in literature; see, for example: S. H. Reich, M. A. M. Fuhry, D. Nguyen, M. J. Pino et. al9 J. Med. Chem. 35: 847, 1992; A. Ivobe, M. Uchida, K. Kamata, Y. Hotei, H. Kusama, H. Harada, Chem. Pharm. Bull. 49: 822,2001. The nitration conditions are similar to those described previously.<br><br>
Reductive alkylation of the amino group at position 7 of tetrahydroquinoline derivatives of general formula XV-a-b using appropriately substituted aldehydes and a suitable reducing agent (e.g. sodium cyanoborohydride or sodium triacetoxy borohydride) in a suitable solvent such as methanol or JV,JV-dimethylfoimamide leads to the formation of compounds of general formula XVIa-b, Generally, formaldehyde leads to the predominant formation of 7-dimethylamino tetrahydroquinoline derivatives (D = E =Me), whereas other aldehydes give rise to the predominant formation of monoalkylated compounds of general formula XVIa-b (D = H, E - (functionalized) alkyl). Reductive alkylations of aromatic amines are well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Standard cleavage of the Fmoc protective group using piperidine in dichloromethane leads to 6-amino tetrahydroquinoline derivatives of general formula XVH-a-b which can be acylated selectively at position 6 as described before to give compounds of the present invention of general formula I-j-k.<br>
In another procedure, the amino group at position 7 of tetrahydroquinoline derivatives   , of general formula XV-a-b can be acylated with (hetero)aryl carboxylic acids (G-<br><br>
CO2H) or acyl chlorides (G-C(O)-Cl) as was described previously. In the subsequent teps, the same deprotection-acylation strategy (deprotection of 6-N-Fmoc and cylation of the resulting 6-NH2) that was described previously then leads to ompounds of the present invention of general formula I-l-m.<br><br>
rhe compounds of the present invention in which R4 = H and R is connected to the etrahydroquinoline scaffold via an oxygen atom and R , R" and R6 are as previously iefined can be prepared starting from 2-meth6xy-4-nitroaniline (XVII). The reaction ;equence (a) Fmoc-protection to give XIX, (b) reduction of the nitro-group to give XX, Allowed by (c) regioselective Skraup reaction, (d) acetylation and (e) Fmoc-leprotection as described before leads to the formation of compounds of general formula XXI-a.<br>
Compounds of general formula XXI-b may be obtained by treating compound XX with aethyl vinyl ketone using the conditions described previously for the conversion of compounds of formula II to Ill-b, followed by 1-iV-acetylation and Fmoc deprotection as described before.<br>
Subsequent conversion of compounds of general formula XXI to XXHI may be effected by acylation of the 6-amino group using an appropriate acylating agent, for example acyl chloride R6-C(0)-C1, followed by Friedel-Crafts reaction with benzene or an appropriate benzene derivative using conditions described previously. Under the Lewis-acidic conditions of the Friedel-Crafts reaction concomitant demethylation of the 7-OMe function in compounds of general formula XXII occurs. The thus obtained<br><br>
free 7-OH group in compounds of general formula XXHI may be realkylated or acylated with (functionalised) alkyl halides (e.g. chloroethylpyrrolidine) or acyl halides (e.g. 2-fiiroyl chloride or methyl chloroformate), respectively, under standard conditions to provide compounds of general formula I-n-o (E = functionalized alkyl, acyl or carbamate).<br><br>
Compounds of the present invention in which R4 and R5 are connected via a nitrogen atom to the tetrahydroquinoline scaffold can be prepared from compounds of general formula XXTV, wherein PG is a nitrogen protective group, e.g. Boc, acetyl, methylcarbamate or Fmoc, via the previously described reactions e.g.: Skraup reaction or cyclocondensation with methyl vinyl ketone, 1-iV-acetylation, cleavage of the protective group, 7^-alkylation, Friedel-Crafts reaction, nitration, nitro-reduction and acylation (vide supra).<br><br><br>
Skraup reactions with acetone or mesityl oxide en compounds of general formula XXV may lead to two different regioisomeric products of general formula XXVI-a and XXVII-a, respectively. Conversion of compounds of general formula XXV using methyl vinyl ketone under previously described conditions may afford regioisomeric products with general formula XXVI-b en XXVII-b, respectively. Generally, these regioisomeric dihydroquinolines can be separated using chromatographical techniques (silicagel, HPLC) or crystallization and can subsequently be converted to compounds<br><br><br>
of the current invention via the previously described routes.<br>
Compounds of the present invention wherein R5 = H may be prepared by reductive 7-deoxygenation of compounds of general formula XXVIII or XXXI (L and/or M is appropriate (substituted) alkyl, acyl alkyloxycarbonyl or alkylaminocarbonyl) via selective 7-O-triflation and subsequent reduction of the 7-OTf (Tf = trifluoromethylsulfonyl) group. The requisite compounds of general formula XXXI are accessible from derivatives of general formula XXVTt using previously described conditions. The (regioselective)-triflation reaction may be effected under controlled conditions using Tf2N-phenyl and A^V-diisopropylethyl amine in DMF at room temperature. Generally, preferential triflation of the 7-OH group occurs. The subsequent reduction can be accomplished using a mixture of triphenyl phosphine, trietyl amine, formic acid and palladium(II) acetate as described in the literature. See for example K.A. Parker, Q. Ding, Tetrahedron 56:10249, 2000. Conversion of the thus obtained compounds with general formula XXX or XXXH using previously described conditions then leads to compounds of general formula I-p-q, in which R = H.<br>
Some of the compounds of the invention, which can be in the form of a free base, may be isolated from the reaction mixture in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts may also be obtained by treating the free base of formula I with an organic or inorganic acid such as hydrogen chloride, hydrogen bromide, hydrogen iodide, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, maleic acid, malonic acid, methanesulphonic acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, and ascorbic acid.<br>
The compounds of the present invention possess at least one chiral carbon atom and may therefore be obtained as pure enantiomers, or as a mixture of enantiomers, or as a mixture of diastereomers. Methods for obtaining the pure enantiomers are well known in the art, e.g crystallization of salts which are obtained from optically active acids and the racemic mixture, or chromatography using chiral columns. For diastereomers, straight phase or reversed phase columns may be used.<br><br>
[Tie compounds of the invention may form hydrates or solvates. It is known to those of ikill in the art that charged compounds form hydrated species when lyophilized with vater, or form solvated species when concentrated in a solution with an appropriate )rganic solvent. The compounds of this invention include the hydrates or solvates of he compounds listed.<br>
For selecting active compounds testing at 10~5 M must result in an activity of more than 20% of the maximal activity when FSH is used as a reference. Another criterion might be the EC50 value which must be 
fhe skilled artisan will recognize that desirable EC50 values are dependent on the compound tested. For example, a compound with an EC50 which is less than 10"" M is generally considered a candidate for drug selection. Preferably this value is lower than 10*7M. However, a compound which has a higher EC50, but is selective for the particular receptor, may be even a better candidate.<br>
Methods to determine receptor binding, as well as in vitro and in vivo assays to determine biological activity, of gonadotropins are well known. In general, the expressed receptor is contacted with the compound to be tested and binding or stimulation or inhibition of a functional response is measured.<br>
To measure a functional response, isolated DNA encoding the FSH receptor gene, preferably the human receptor, is expressed in suitable host cells. Such a cell might be the Chinese Hamster Ovary cell, but other cells are also suitable. Preferably the cells are of mammalian origin (Jia et al, Mol.Endocrin., 5:759-776,1991).<br>
Methods to construct recombinant FSH expressing cell lines are well known in the art (Sambrook et al,, Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, latest edition). Expression of receptor is attained by expression of the DNA encoding the desired protein. Techniques for site directed mutagenesis, ligation of additional sequences, PCR, and construction of suitable expression systems are all, by now, well known in the art. Portions, or all, of the DNA encoding the desired protein can be constructed synthetically using standard solid phase techniques, preferably to include restriction sites for ease of ligation. Suitable control elements for transcription and translation of the included coding sequence can<br><br>
be provided to the DNA coding sequences. As is well known, expression systems are now available which are compatible with a wide variety of hosts, including prokaryotic hosts such as bacteria and eukaryotic hosts such as yeast, plant cells, insect cells, mammalian cells, avian cells and the like.<br>
Cells expressing the receptor are then contacted with the test compound to observe binding, or stimulation or inhibition of a functional response.<br>
Alternatively, isolated cell membranes containing the expressed receptor may be used to measure binding of compound.<br>
For measurement of binding, radioactively labeled or fluorescently labeled compounds may be used. Also competition binding assays can be performed.<br>
Another assay involves screening for FSH receptor agonist compounds by determining stimulation of receptor mediated cAMP accumulation. Thus, such a method involves expression of the receptor on the cell surface of a host cell and exposing the cell to the test compound. The amount of cAMP is then measured. The level of cAMP can be reduced or increased, depending on the inhibitory or stimulating effect of the test compound upon binding to the receptor.<br>
Screening for FSH receptor antagonists involves incubation of FSH receptor-expressing cells with a concentration range of the test compound in the presence of a fixed, submaximally effective, FSH concentration (Le., a FSH concentration that induces approximately 80% of the maximal stimulation of cAMP accumulation in the absence of test compound). From the concentration-effect curves, the IC50 value and the percentage of inhibition of FSH-induced cAMP accumulation can be determined for each of the test compounds.<br>
In addition to direct measurement of e.g. cAMP levels in the exposed cell, cells lines can be used which in addition to transfection with receptor encoding DNA are also transfected with a second DNA encoding a reporter gene the expression of which responds to the level of cAMP. Such reporter genes might be cAMP inducible or might be constructed in such a way that they are connected to novel cAMP responsive elements. In general, reporter gene expression might be controlled by any response<br><br>
element reacting to changing levels of cAMP. Suitable reporter genes are e.g. the genes encoding p-galactosidase, alkaline phosphatase, firefly luciferase and green fluorescence protein. The principles of such transactivation assays are well known in the art and are described e.g. in Stratowa, Ch., Himmler, A. and Czernilofsky, A.P., (1995) Curr.Opin.Biotechnol. 6:574. As reference compound human recombinant FSH can be used. In the alternative also competition assays can be performed<br>
The present invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a tertrahydroquinoline derivative or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof having the general formula I in admixture with pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliaries and optionally other therapeutic agents. The auxiliaries must be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the composition and not deleterious to the recipients thereof.<br>
Compositions include e.g. those suitable for oral, sublingual, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, local, or rectal administration, and the like, all in unit dosage forms for administration.<br>
For oral administration, the active ingredient may be presented as discrete units, such as tablets, capsules, powders, granulates, solutions, suspensions, and the like.<br>
For parenteral administration, the pharmaceutical composition of the invention may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, e.g. injection liquids in predetermined amounts, for example in sealed vials and ampoules, and may also be stored in a freeze dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of sterile liquid carrier, e.g. water, prior to use.<br>
Mixed with such pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliaries, e.g. as described in the standard reference, Gennaro, A.R. et al., Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy'(2Qih Edition., Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, 2000, see especially Part 5: Pharmaceutical Manufacturing), the active agent may be compressed into solid dosage units, such as pills, tablets, or be processed into capsules or suppositories. By means of pharmaceutically acceptable liquids the active agent can be applied as a fluid composition,, e.g. as an injection preparation, in the form of a solution, suspension, emulsion, or as a spray, e.g. a nasal spray.<br><br>
For making solid dosage units, the use of conventional additives such as fillers, colorants, polymeric binders and the like is contemplated. In general any pharma-ceutically acceptable additive which does not interfere with the function of the active compounds can be used. Suitable carriers with which the active agent of the invention can be administered as solid compositions include lactose, starch, cellulose derivatives and the like, or mixtures thereof, used in suitable amounts. For parenteral administration, aqueous suspensions, isotonic saline solutions and sterile injectable solutions may be used, containing pharmaceutical^ acceptable dispersing agents and/or wetting agents, such as propylene glycol or butylene glycol.<br>
The invention further includes a pharmaceutical composition, as hereinbefore described, in combination with packaging material suitable for said composition, said packaging material including instructions for the use of the composition for the use as hereinbefore described.<br>
The tetrahydroquinpline derivatives of the invention can also be administered in the form of implantable pharmaceutical devices, consisting of a core of active material, encased by a release rate-regulating membrane. Such implants are to be applied subcutaneously or locally, and will release the active ingredient at an approximately constant rate over relatively large periods of time, for instance from weeks to years. Methods for the preparation of implantable pharmaceutical devices as such are known in the art, for example as described in European Patent 0,303,306 (AKZO Nobel N.V.).<br>
The exact dose and regimen of administration of the active ingredient, or a pharmaceutical composition thereof, will necessarily be dependent upon the therapeutic effect to be achieved (treatment of infertility; contraception), and may vary with the particular compound, the route of administration, and the age and condition of the individual subject to whom the medicament is to be administered.<br>
In general parenteral administration requires lower dosages than other methods of administration which are more dependent upon absorption. However, a dosage for humans preferably contains 0.9001-25 mg per kg body weight. The desired dose may be presented as one dose or as multiple subdoses administered at appropriate intervals<br><br>
throughout the day, or, in case of female recipients, as doses to be administered at appropriate daily intervals throughout the menstrual cycle. The dosage as well as the regimen of administration may differ between a female and a male recipient.<br>
Thus, the compounds according to the invention can be used in therapy.<br>
A further aspect of the invention resides in the use of a tetrahydroquinoline derivative compound having the general formula I for the manufacture of a medicament to be used for the treatment of disorders responsive to FSH receptor mediated pathways. Thus, patients in need thereof can be administered with suitable amounts of the compounds according to the invention.<br>
In another aspect the invention resides in the use of a tetrahydroquinoline derivative compound having the general formula I for the manufacture of a medicament to be used for the control of fertility.<br>
In yet another aspect the invention resides in the use of a tetrahydroquinoline derivative compound having the general formula I for the manufacture of a medicament to be used for the treatment of infertility.<br>
In still another aspect the invention resides in the use of a tetrahydroquinoline derivative compound having the general formula I for the manufacture of a medicament to be used to prevent fertility.<br>
