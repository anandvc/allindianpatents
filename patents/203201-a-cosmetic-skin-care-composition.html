COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10)<br>
A    COSMETIC COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING ANISE EXTRACT AND.  SKIN<br>
RETINOIDS-<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the  nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
FILED OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to cosmetic compositions containing anise extract in combination with retinoids and method of conditioning skin by the application of such compositions to the skin.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Retinol (vitamin A) is an endogenous compound which occurs naturally in the human body and is essential for normal epithelial cell differentiation. Natural and synthetic vitamin A derivatives have been used extensively in the treatment of a variety of skin disorders and as skin repair and renewal agents. Retinoic acid has been used to treat a variety of skin conditions such as acne, wrinkles, psoriasis, age spots and skin discoloration.<br>
Within the cells, retinol and retinoic acid are bound to specific cellular binding proteins, two of the major proteins are CRABP-1 and 2 (Roos et al., Pharmacological reviews : 50, 315-333,1998). These proteins act in regulating the intracellular concentration of retinoids by acting as both storage or shuttle proteins in retinoid metabolism. The levels of this protein are regulated by the amount of retinoid acid within the cells. Higher cellular levels of retinoids increase the expression of CRABP-2. Therefore, the amount of this protein in the cells, is a<br>
2<br><br>
measure of the retinoid activity of the cells. Skin cells contain CRABP-2 both in the epidermis and the dermis. CRABP-2 response to retinoid administration in fibroblasts in    vitro    is used as a reproducible measure of retinoid bioactivity that predicts human skin responses (Elder et al.    J. Invest. Dermatol., 106: 517-521, 19S6). Therefore, CRABP-2 expression of fibroblasts is a measure of retinoid activity  leading  to  various  cosmetic  skin  benefits (antiaging, anti wrinkling, skin conditioning etc.).<br>
Anise (also known as "Sweet cumin," or by the scientific name Pimpinella   anisum)    seed oil contains several volatile fragrance components.  One of the major components of anise seed oil is trans-anethole (up to 75% of the seed) (Embong MB, Hadziyev D, Molnar S., Can. J. Plant Sci, 57: 681-8, 1977) .   The other constituents of the oil,  present in amounts  of  1-5%  are  cis  anethole,   carvone,  beta caryophyllene, dihydcarvyl acetate, estragole and limonene. Agricultural Research Service database on the composition of Anise also include dianethole and photoanethole as other minor components.  Anethole, dianethole, photoanethole and estragole are known to have estrogenic activity. Essential oils including those from anise have been described as useful as insect repellents (Shukla HS, Upadhay PD, Tripathi SC, Pesticides, 23: 33-5, 1989); insecticides (Eli S, Uzi R et a1     J.     Chem.  Ecol  17:  499-504,  1991;  Craig M and Lichtenstein EP., J. Agric.  Food Chem. 30: 563-8,  1982); convulsants  (Okuyama  E,  Nakamura T and Mikio Y.,  Chem. Pharm. Bull 41:  1670-1,  1993)  and as a toxic agent for snails  (Maini P,  Morallo-Rejesus B.,  Phillipp.  J.  Sci., 121:, 391-7, 1992).<br><br><br>
WOS112792 describes the use of anethole for promoting hair growth, preventing or minimizing hair loss and enhancing hair color. Several US patents describe the use of cyclodextrin for complexing essential oils, including anise oil or anethole as components of fragrances, perfumes, oral hygiene compositions, skin care compositions, or laundry detergent compositions (e.g: US Patent No. 5543157). JP 6048934 discloses skin care compositions containing extracts of plants selected from dill, tarragon, Savi, anise, etc., in combination with skin whitening agents or in combination with at least one kind of collagen formation promoter such as retinoic acid.<br>
The present invention is based in part on the discovery that the organic solvent extract of anise seed in combination with retinol or retinyl ester enhances CRABP-2 expression in fibroblasts.<br>

The invention accordingly also provides a closed container containing a cosmetically acceptable composition as herein defined.<br>
The following specific examples further illustrate the invention, but the invention is not limited thereto. In all examples, anise seed was obtained from local health food stores. Retinoids were obtained from Sigma. The student t-test was used to calculate all p-values<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The following methods were employed:<br>
Methods:<br>
1. Preparation  of  anise  extracts:<br><br><br>
Dried star anise seeds (Pimpinella anisum.) were purchased from local markets and powdered in a dry grinder. The alcoholic extract of anise seed was prepared by stirring 1 gram of the dry anise seed powder in 10 ml of solvent selected from the list of solvents provided above (for example, ethanol) for 4 to 24 hrs at room temperature. The extracts were clarified by filtration and centrifugation, to obtain a 10% extract of anise seed in the particular solvent.<br>
2.  Cell culture method:<br>
Human adult fibroblasts obtained from sun-protected inner arm of 25-30 old year female volunteers were used. Cells were grown in 1:1 DMEM/Hams F12 media containing 10% FBS,<br>
maintained at 37*C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere under normal<br>
atmospheric oxygen tension. Third passage adult fibroblasts were grown in DMEM media with 10% FBS in 12-well plates at a seeding density of 40,000 cells/ml/well. The cells at 80% confluence were rinsed in serum free and phenol red free (PRF) DMEM media twice. Pre-treatment with anise seed extract for 4 hours was conducted and then dosed with retinoids and incubated for 48 hours. After incubation, the wells were washed twice with IX PBS and the cell monolayer was harvested in lOOpl cell lysis buffer (contains IX PBS, 1% TritonX, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS containing protease inhibitor (lOmg/ml PMSF in isopropanol, lOp1/ml)). The suspension was spun at 14000rpm for 10 minutes, the supernatant collected and an aliquot of the supernatant used for protein quantification. The protein concentration was determined using a Pierce protein kit. The remainder of the lOOpl supernatant (cell lysate) was denatured in a mixture<br><br><br>
of 40pl sample buffer (NOVEX) and 0.5-5 Eeta mercaptoethanol (3ME) by boiling the sample for 5 minutes. Equal amounts of protein were then loaded onto 16% Tris-glycine gels for protein analysis by SDS page and Western Immuno-blotting for CRABP-2 protein expression.<br>
3.   Detection of Cellular Retinoic Acid Binding Protein 2 (CRABP-2) in fibroblasts:<br>
To measure the levels of CRABP-2 in the fibroblasts prepared as described above, the cell supernatant was re-suspended in 4X sample buffer and 0.5% BME, boiled for 5 minutes and used for western blotting. Equal amounts of protein were loaded onto 16% Tris-glycine gels for CRABP-2 protein analysis by SDS page and Western Immuno-blotting. The gels were transferred to nitrocellulose blots and Western Blotting was carried out using monoclonal antibodies to CRAB2-2 accrding to standard procedures. The CRABP-2 protein band was visualized in the Wester0000n Elots using the chemiluminescence system obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (SantaCruz, CA) . The bands in the film were quantitated by densitometric scanning, the data from triplicate samples were calculated as % of control and expressed in the following tables as % increase over control (with control as 100%) +/-SD of triplicates.<br>
EXAMPLES 1-4<br>
