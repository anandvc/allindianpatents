				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention refers in particular to the structural gene sequence of the peptide antibiotic mersacidin. Sequencing revealed that premersacidin consists of an unusually long 48 amino acid leader sequence and a 20 amino acid propeptide part which is modified during biosynthesis to the mature lantibiotic.<br>
Mersacidin belongs to a group of bactericidal peptides that was designated as lantibiotics in order to signify that these peptides contain the rare amino acids lanthionine and/or 3-methyllanthionine. Additional modified amino acids such as dehydroalanine and dehydrobutyrine occur regularly, while S-aminovinylcysteine and lysinoalanine are found in some lantibiotics only (G. Jung (1991), Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 30: 1051-1068). Lantibiotics are produced by gram-positive bacteria and derived from ribosomally synthesized prepeptides. The lantibiotic structural genes have been found either on the bacterial chromosome (e.g. subtilin and cinnamycin, or are associated with movable elements like transposons (e.g. nisin) or large plasmids (e.g, epidermin and Pep5). The prepeptides consist of an N-terminal leader sequence that is cleaved off after export from the producer cell and the C-terminal propeptide, which is post-translationally modified to the mature lantibiotic (G. Jung (1991), supra). In a first step of the modification, serine and threonine residues are dehydrated to give dehydroalanine (Dha) or dehydrobutyrine (Dhb), respectively (H.-P. Well et al. (1990), Eur. J. Biochem. 194: 217-223). Subsequently the SH-groups of the cysteine residues react with the double bonds of Dha or Dhb residues to form the lanthionines or methyllanthionines, respectively.<br>
Mersacidin was isolated from the culture supernatant of Bacillus spec. HIL Y-85,54728 and gained interest because of its significant in vivo efficiency against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (S. Chatterjee et al. (1992), J. Antibiotics 45: 839-845). It is the smallest lantibiotic isolated so far (1825 Da), synthesized from a propeptide of 20 amino acids and contains 3 methyllanthionine residues, one dehydroalanine and one S-aminovinyl-2<br><br>
methyllanthionine residues, one dehydroalanine and one S-aminovinyl-2-methylcysteine (Fig. 1 A) (S. Chatterjee (1992), J. Antibiotics 45: 832-838). Mersacidin carries no net charge and has overall hydrophobic properties. Recent results indicate that mersacidin interferes with the peptidoglycan biosynthesis. This occurs most likely on the level of transglycosylation via a mechanism which differs from antibiotics currently in use against MRSA.<br>
Therefore, the present invention refers to premersacidin having the amino acid sequence as shown in Fig. 2 from amino acid No. 1 through 68 and promersacidin having the amino acid sequence as shown in Fig. 2 from amino acid No. 49 through 68.<br>
A further embodiment of the present invention are DNAs coding for premersacidin or promersacidin, in particular DNAs having the nucleotide sequence as shown in Fig. 2 from No. 22 through 225 encoding premersacidin or from No. 166 through 225 encoding promersacidin; a vector containing said DNA and a host cell containing said vector.<br>
Another embodiment is a process for producing premersacidin, promersacidin or mature mersacidin by gene technological methods generally known by a skilled person in the art, i.e. a suitable host cell containing said DNAs coding for premersacidin or promersacidin are cultured under suitable conditions followed by isolation of premersacidin, promersacidin or mature mersacidin expressed by said host cell, preferably a gram-positive bacterium, such as Bacillus, Streptomyces or Streptococcus.<br>
Finally, the premersacidin or promersacidin peptide or the genes thereof according to the present invention can be used for the production of mature mersacidin as for example described in WO 90/00558.<br><br>
As an example mature mersacidin is useful as peptide antibiotic for the preservation of foods particularly against methicillin-resistent Staphylococcus aureus or as an antibiotic to treat infections with Staphylococcus aureus in animals or humans. The invention may further be used to obtain mersacidin derivatives modified in the amino acid sequence with an extruded antibiotic spectrum or a different efficacy. Furthermore, the invention open ways to overexpress Mersacidin or its derivatives by genetic engineering.<br>

Example<br>
1.       Cloning of the structural gene of mersacidin<br>
The putative mersacidin propeptide sequence (Fig. 1B) was deduced from the structure of mersacidin and based on general information about lantibiotic biosynthesis. The depicted probe was synthesized as a 51-base guessmer based on preferred Codon usage of Bacillus on a PCR-Mate (Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, FRG) and labeled with digoxigenin (Boehringer Mannheim,<br><br>
Mannheim, FRG) (Fig. IB). The aminobutyryl residues (Abus-half of methyllanthionine) derive from threonines while the alanine residues (Alas-half of methylanthionine) are coded as cysteine in the propeptide. The-S-aminoviny-2-methylcysteine, that forms the terminal ring structure is probably formed from a methyllanthionine that has been oxidatively decarboxylated as was shown for epidermin which contains a C-terminal S-aminovinylcysteine (T. Kupke et al. (1992), J. Bacteriol. 174: 5354-5361).<br>
As plasmids could not be detected in the producer strain, chromosomal DNA was prepared as described by Marmur (J. Marmur (1961), J. Mol. Biol. 3: 208-218) except that only one chloroform extraction and precipitation were performed and that the DNA was subsequently dissolved in equilibration buffer and purified on a Qiagen-tip* 100 column (Diagen, Hilden, FRG). At 51 °C a singly 2 kb band of a chromosomal restriction digest with Hind III hybridized with the probe in a Southern blot (E. M. Southern (1975), J. Mol. Biol. 98: 503-517). The fragments ranging from 1.9 to 2.3 kb in size were cut out from the gel, eluted with a BIOTRAP® (Schleicher and Schull, Dassel, FRG) and subcloned in pUC18 (C. Yanisch-Perron et al. (1985), Gene 33: 103-109) in E. coll. The plasmids of several recombinant colonies were prepared by the Birnboim and Doly method (H. C. Birnbom and J. Doly (1979), Nucl. Acids Res. 7: 1513-1523), digested with Hind ill and probed with the guessmer. One of the clones that gave a positive signal was further analyzed by restriction digests with various enzymes and subsequent Southern blots. Finally, a 1.3 kb EcoR I -Hind III fragment was subcloned into pEMBL 18 and pEMBL 19 (L. Dente et al. (1983), Nucleic Acids. Res. 11: 1645-1655) in E. coli. Furthermore, a 0.6 kb EcoR V fragment was cloned in the vector pCUl (J. Augustin et al. (1992), Eur. J. Biochem. 204: 1149-1154) after site directed mutagenesis of the EcoR I site into an EcoR V site using the transformer site directed mutagenesis kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, USA).<br><br>
2.	Nucleotide sequence of the mersacidin structural gene, mrsA<br>
The 0.6 kb fragment was sequenced on an A.L.F. automatic DNA sequencer (Pharmacia, Brussels, Belgium) using the dideoxy chain termination method (F. Sanger et al. (1977), Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 74: 5463-5467) from double standed DNA; for priming the universal and reversal primer of the AutoRead   sequencing kit (Pharmacia, Brussels, Belgium) and two synthetic oligonucleotides 5'-TCTCTTCCA I II I II IG)3' and<br>
5'-(AAATCAAATTAACAAATAC)3' were employed. The nucleotide sequence of the mersacidin structural gene, mrsA, is shown in Fig. 2. A potential ribosome binding site (AGG GGG) was found eight base pairs upstream of the ATG start codon of the open reading frame. The C-terminal part of the sequence is in agreement with the published mersacidin primary structure (S. Chatterjee et al. (1992), J. Antibiotics 45: 832-838) and its proposed propeptide sequence. The N-terminal part consists of a 48 amino acid leader sequence (arrow In Fig. 2). The pro-mersacidin consists of 20 amino acids. Therefore, the full length of the propeptide is 68 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 7228 Da. Eight bases downstream of the TAA (ochre) stop codon a hairpin structure with a free energy value of -86,7 kJ mol'^ and a stem size of 14 base pairs was found, which could serve as a rho-independent terminator during transcription as it is followed by a TTTATT sequence (Fig. 2).<br>
3.	Characterization of the mersacidin propeptide<br>
Lantibiotics have been subdivided into two groups (G. Jung (1991), supra). Type A-lantibiotics are elongated amphiphilic peptides that form transient pores in the membranes of sensitive bacteria (H.-G. Sahl (1991), Pore formation in bacterial membranes by cationic lantibiotics, p. 347-358. In G. Jung and H.-G. Sahl (ed.), Nisin and novel lantibiotics, Escom, Leiden). Type B-lantibiotics are globular peptides that are produced by Streptomyces, have molecular masses smaller than 2100 Da and are highly homologous as to their amino acid sequence and ring structure which includes a head to tail condensation (G. Jung<br><br>
(1991), supra). Up to now mersacidin could not be classed with either group (G. Bierbaum and H.-G. Sahl (1993), Zbl. Bakt. 278: 1-22). In this respect, the connparlson of the propeptide sequence of nnersacidin with that of type A- and B-lantibiotics is of special interest.<br>
Two connnnon characteristics of lantibiotic leader sequences have been preserved in nnersacidin: i) There is no cysteine in the leader sequence (G. Jung (1991), supra), ii) A a-helix propensity is predicted for the C-terminal part of the leader sequence. Such structural elements have also been predicted and dennonstrated for the leader peptides of type A-lantibiotis by circular dichroism measurennents in trifluoroethanol/water nnixtures (A. G. Beck-Sickinger and G. Jung. Synthesis and conformational analysis of lantibiotic leader-, pro- and prepeptides, p. 218-230. In G. Jung and H.-G. Sahl (ed.), Nisin and novel lantibiotics, Escom, Leiden 1991). In every other respect the mersacidin leader sequence differs from the type A-lantibiotic leader sequences described so far: As shown in Fig, 3 it rather resembles in length and charge distribution (48 amino acids / 12 charges) the unusually long 59 amino acid leader (11 charges) of the type B-lantibiotic cinnamycin (C. Kaletta et al. (1989), Pep5, a new lantibiotic: structural gene isolation and propeptide sequence. Arch. Microbiol. 152: 16-19). In contrast, a typical highly charged type A-lantibiotic leader sequence, e.g. the Pep5 leader peptide, contains 10 charged residues in a total of only 26 amino acids (C. Kaletta et al. (1989), supra). Conserved sequences of type A-lantibiotics (e.g. the F D/N L D/E motif) are not found in the mersacidin leader peptide. The protease cleavage site of the mersacidin leader sequence (-4M - -3E - -2A --1A -+1C) differs from the conserved site of the type A-lantibiotics (Fig. 3). Here we find either the nisin type cleavage site (-1, positively charged amino acid; -2, proline; -3, negatively charged or polar and -4 hydrophobic) or the hydrophobic glycine containing cleavage sites of lacticin 481 J.-C. Piard et al. (1993), J. Biol. Chem., 268, 16361-16368 or streptococcin A-FF22 (W. L. Hynes et al. (1993),Appl. Env. Microbiol. 59: 1969-1971). The (-3A - -2F - -1A) cleavage site of cinnamycin (C. Kaletta et al. (1989), supra) conforms with the (-3A --2X --1A) rule for proteins secreted via the Sec pathway. In conclusion, the mersacidin propeptide shows no<br><br>
homologies to the conserved sequences of type A-lantibiotic leader sequences. There Is similarity to the prepeptide of cinnamycin in length and charge distribution, but no obvious sequence homology on the amino acid level. Mersacldin Is smaller than type A-lantibiotics, it is not positively charged and it does not depolarize membranes, but rather inhibits peptidoglycan biosynthesis. This, in addition to the properties of the leader peptide indicates that mersacldin Is more related to type B- than to type A-lantibiotics. Recently, the sequence and bridging pattern of another lantibiotic, actagardine, which also inhibits cell wall biosynthesis (S. Somma et al., Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 11: 396-401, 1977), have been elucidated. Comparison to mersacldin shows that one ring is almost completely conserved in both lantibiotics. In view of the strong homology of the hitherto characterized type B-lantibiotics duramycin A, B, C, ancovenin and cinnamycin, these peptides could also be regarded as strutural variants like it is observed for epidermin and gallidermin or nisin A and nisin Z. Therefore, we propose that mersacldin and actagardine should be classed with the type B-lantibiotics and that the designation type B-lantibiotic should not be exclusively reserved for strutureal variants of duramycin but comprise small, globular lantibiotics that carry a low charge and inhibit enzyme activity.<br><br><br>
