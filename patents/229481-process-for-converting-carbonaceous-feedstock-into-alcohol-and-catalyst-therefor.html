				<td>PROCESS FOR CONVERTING CARBONACEOUS FEEDSTOCK<br>
INTO ALCOHOL AND CATALYST THEREFOR<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the conversion of carbonaceous feedstock into<br>
useful products. The term "carbonaceous feedstock" as used herein includes not only<br>
organic matter that is part of the stable carbon cycle, but also fossilized organic matter<br>
such as coal, petroleum, and natural gas, and products, derivatives and byproducts<br>
thereof such as plastics, petroleum coke and the like. The first step in such processes is<br>
the gasification of the feedstock in a so-called "reformer" to a stream of hydrogen,<br>
carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and methane. This stream is referred to as syngas,<br>
and its generation is disclosed in United States Patent 4.872,886, and others. The '886<br>
patent includes an oxidation first step, in which air is used to fire a portion of the<br>
feedstock. The resulting stream is then combined with a "coal slurry" stream in a<br>
second stage of the conversion reaction. United States Reissue 35,377 discloses the<br>
anaerobic reaction of the feedstock with steam.<br>
The various ingredients in a stream of syngas can then be converted into other<br>
compounds in a so-called Fischer-Tropsch reactor. The catalyst used in the reactor, and<br>
to some extent the temperatures and pressures used, will determine what products can be<br>
obtained.<br>
The Fischer-Tropsch reaction disclosed at the bottom of page 106 in Organic<br>
Chemistry, Third Edition, by Brewster and McEwen, Â©1961 shows the conversion of<br>
carbon monoxide and hydrogen to alkanes over a cobalt-thoria catalyst. United States<br>
Patent 4,752,622 discloses and claims the use of a three component catalyst comprising<br>
molybdenum or tungsten, cobalt or nickel, and an alkali or alkaline earth promoter, to<br>
produce methanol from carbon monoxide and hydrogen. United States Patent 4,609,679<br>
selectively catalyzes for the production of methane, by using ruthenium combined with<br>
tantalum, niobium, vanadium or mixtures thereof. United States Patent 4,675,344<br>
(Canadian CA 1,267,160) controls the ratio of methanol to higher alcohols produced by<br>
using molybdenum or tungsten sulfide catalysts, and adjusting the concentration of a<br>
sulfur releasing substance in the feed.<br><br>
The conversion of methanol to ethanol and higher alcohols in the presence of<br>
carbon monoxide and hydrogen is disclosed in United States Patent 4,825,013 and its<br>
Canadian counterpart CA 1,268,189. The patent claims achieving this conversion<br>
through the use of a heterogeneous catalyst comprised of molybdenum or tungsten and<br>
an alkali or alkaline earth element.<br>
German Patent Application 32 42 697 A1 is directed towards a process<br>
for the concurrent production of methanol and ethanol by catalytically converting<br>
synthesis gas into methanol and separating the methanol from the reaction<br>
mixture. The separated methanol, along with excess gas remaining, is converted<br>
to ethanol at an increased pressure and an increased temperature, using a cobalt<br>
catalyst. In this process methanol, as well as ethanol, is produced from a single<br>
raw substance in a two-step process, using a heterogeneously catalyzed system<br>
with a homogeneously catalyzed system. Fresh synthesis gas is added if the<br>
excess gas does not contain enough carbon monoxide prior to homologization.<br>
In European patent application 849,245, natural gas is converted in a reformer to<br>
a syngas stream of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrogen and unconverted<br>
methane. This entire syngas stream is passed through a Fischer-Tropsch reactor to<br>
produce methanol. The unreacted syngas is divided into a CO, CO2 and CH4 stream,<br>
which is recycled back through the reformer; and a hydrogen rich stream, which is<br>
combined with oxygen and combusted to provide heat for the reformer.<br>
PCT patent application WO 82/02547 removes CO2 from a syngas stream and<br>
recycles it through a reformer along with steam and an incoming stream of methane.<br>
The reactants produce a syngas stream from which the CO2 is thus continuously removed<br>
and recycled.<br>
European patent application 253,540 is exemplary of art in which higher alcohols<br>
are produced in a Fischer-Tropsch reactor from feedstock (coal slurry) syngas, and any<br>
methanol produced is recycled through the Fischer-Tropsch reactor.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
One aspect of the present invention comprises a carbonaceous feedstock to<br>
alcohol conversion process in which carbon dioxide and a portion of the hydrogen<br>
produced are removed from the syngas stream issuing from a feedstock reformer, to<br>
yield a second syngas stream comprising carbon monoxide and a reduced amount of<br>
hydrogen. The hydrogen and the carbon dioxide are passed through a Fischer-Tropsch<br>
reactor which is catalyzed to favor the production of methanol. The methanol produced<br>
in the Fischer-Tropsch reactor is passed with the reduced hydrogen syngas through a<br>
second Fischer-Tropsch reactor which is catalyzed to favor the production of ethanol.<br>
In a preferred aspect of the invention, methane is at least from time to time<br>
removed from the ethanol product stream and recycled with steam through a methane<br>
reformer to form carbon monoxide and hydrogen. These are then recycled into the<br>
syngas stream from the feedstock reformer.<br>
Other aspects of the invention include, without limitation, a unique catalyst, a<br>
method for controlling the content of the syngas formed in the feedstock reformer, and a<br>
feedstock handling system. These and other features, advantages and aspects of the<br>
invention will be more fully understood and appreciated by reference to the written<br>
specification and appended drawings.	 <br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Introduction<br>
The preferred embodiment apparatus employed is conveniently divided into five<br>
"Units" in Fig. 1. In Unit I, feedstock is converted to syngas (stream 3), and carbon<br>
dioxide (stream 8) is removed from syngas stream 3. In Unit n, hydrogen (stream 10) is<br>
partially removed from the syngas stream. In Unit III, syngas and methanol are<br>
converted to ethanol. In Unit IV, removed hydrogen and carbon dioxide are converted<br>
to methanol, which is used to feed the ethanol Fischer-Tropsch reactor 300 in Unit HI.<br>
In Unit V, methane in stream 12 is reacted with steam (stream 15) to convert it to carbon<br>
monoxide and hydrogen (stream 13), which are fed into the syngas stream 5 in Unit II.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, the alcohol production process generally involves<br>
the following steps (see Fig. 1).<br>
1.	Anaerobically reacting feedstock 2 with superheated steam 1 in<br>
feedstock reformer 100 (Unit I) to generate a syngas stream 3 of<br>
hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and methane;<br>
2.	Removing the CO2 (stream 8 from Unit 0 to yield syngas stream 5,<br>
and removing a portion of the hydrogen (stream 10 from Unit II)<br>
from syngas stream 5 (and from syngas stream 13, which has been<br>
combined with syngas stream 5) to yield syngas stream 6, which<br>
comprises hydrogen, carbon monoxide and methane;<br>
3.	Passing the CO2 (stream 8) and removed hydrogen (stream 10)<br>
through Fischer-Tropsch reactor 400 in Unit IV, catalyzed to favor<br>
the production of methanol (stream 11);<br>
4.	Passing the hydrogen, carbon monoxide and methane syngas<br>
stream 6, and methanol stream 11, through a Fischer-Tropsch<br>
reactor 300 in Unit III, catalyzed to favor ethanol production;<br>
5.	Diverting from time to time at least a portion (stream 12) of the<br>
unreacted syngas stream 17, which is recycling through the ethanol<br>
reactor 300, and reforming the methane it contains with steam in<br>
methane reformer 500 (Unit V), into carbon monoxide and hydrogen<br>
(stream 13); and<br>
6.	Recycling the resulting hydrogen and carbon monoxide stream 13<br>
into Unit II along with the syngas stream 5 from the feedstock<br>
reformer 100, where they join and are compressed, and stripped of<br>
some hydrogen as discussed above, to form syngas stream 6, which<br>
is fed to ethanol reactor 300.<br><br>
Whereas prior art carbonaceous feedstock conversion processes yield about 424<br>
liters (112 gallons) of ethanol per ton of feedstock, and prior art fermentation processes<br>
yield about 379 liters (100 gallons) of ethanol per ton of feedstock, the present alcohol<br>
production process yields 757 liters (200 gallons) or more of ethanol per ton of feedstock.<br>
Unit I: The Feedstock Reformer (FR)<br>
In Unit I, feedstock 2 is anaerobically reformed in feedstock reformer 100 with<br>
superheated steam 1 into a syngas stream 3 comprising as its primary components<br>
hydrogen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and methane. Minor amounts of other<br>
ingredients may be formed. Preparation of the feedstock prior to introduction into<br>
feedstock reformer 100 is illustrated in Fig. 3.<br>
Referring to Fig. 3, feedstock preparation apparatus 20 includes a rough grinder<br>
26 which may be used depending on the consistency of feedstock. The feedstock is<br>
primarily wood and/or other organic material. Rough grinder 26 may be used if the<br>
feedstock is clumped together, in unusually large conglomerates, or if the feedstock<br>
needs to be further ground before being subjected to screen 32. After the feedstock is<br>
optionally subjected to rough grinder 26, feedstock is conveyed by first conveyor 29 to a<br>
position above screen 32. Feedstock falls off the first conveyor 29 to screen 32 where<br>
dirt 33 and iron are separated from feedstock. Iron removal is accomplished by<br>
appropriate placement of magnets. Feedstock is separated to a location 34 at the<br>
beginning of the second conveyor 36. Second conveyor 36 carries the feedstock to<br>
conveyor 37. Conveyor 37 carries feedstock to feed mill 39. Feed mill 39 comprises a<br>
grinder which grinds the feedstock to a size allowing it to pass through a 4.8 millimeter<br>
(3/16-inch) screen. After passing through the 4.8 millimeter (3/16-inch) screen, the<br>
feedstock falls into feed storage bin 41. For a plant having a feedstock feed rate of<br>
about 181 kilograms (400 lbs.) per hour, feed storage bin 41 is about 3 meters (10 feet)<br>
in diameter and about 3 meters (10 feet) tall. From feed storage bin 41, feedstock is<br>
placed in vibrating bin discharger 44. A vibrating dryer feed conveyor 47 then moves<br>
feedstock from vibrating bin discharger 44 to dryer 50, where the feedstock is dried to a<br>
moisture content of from about 5% to about 20%, more preferably from about 9% to<br>
about 15%.<br><br>
Flue gas inlet 53 feeds flue gas (stream 18 from the heat source of feedstock<br>
reformer 100) into wood dryer system 50. Rue gas inlet 53 may contain compressor 54<br>
and/or fuel gas start-up combuster 55. Fuel gas up-start combuster 55 is usually not<br>
necessary. However, if the drier has been shut down, combuster 55 ignites a stream of<br>
fuel gas which is fed into the flue gas stream at combuster 55. Any fuel may be<br>
employed.<br>
The flue gas is fed into dryer 50 and mixes with communited feedstock to dry it,<br>
purge it and heat it for further processing. The flue gas comprises about 80% nitrogen<br>
and 20% CO2. From dryer 50 fines and smaller feedstock particles are carried by flue<br>
gas out through drier stack 51 to a cyclone separator 59, while larger feedstock particles<br>
pass along a vibrating screen at the bottom of dryer 50, out through one end thereof,<br>
where they are deposited on enclosed vibrating screen conveyor 67. Cyclone separator<br>
59 separates the fines from the remaining smaller feedstock particles. The smaller<br>
feedstock particles flow down to dryer cyclone dust collector 62, and then pass from<br>
dryer cyclone dust collector 62 through solids outlet airlock 65, wherein the smaller<br>
particles of feedstock are then reunited with the larger particles of feedstock on vibrating<br>
screen feed conveyor 67.<br>
The vibrating screen feed conveyor 67 conveys the dried feedstock to blower<br>
56A, which blows the dried comminuted feedstock, along with the inert flue gas,<br>
through pipe 56. The use of flue gas as a "carrier" minimizes the introduction of air<br>
into the system. The dried feedstock particles are fed by blower 56A through feed pipe<br>
56 to bunker 82 (Fig. 4). The fines of feedstock are then vented from separator 59 and<br>
carried to bag house dust collector 69. The fines are carried by the flue gas flow,<br>
induced in part by blower 70. The fines of feedstock which fall to the bottom of bag<br>
house dust collector 69 are fed via screw conveyor 72 through rotary airlock 74. They<br>
are fed into the flow of large and small particles of feedstock being carried via a flue gas<br>
in feed pipe 56.<br>
Blower 70 and blower 54 are balanced so as to maintain a relatively neutral<br>
pressure in vibrating screen drier 50. There is just enough of a pressure difference to<br>
keep the flue gas flowing through drier 50.<br><br>
Feedstock is fed via flue gas feed pipe 56, to feed hopper or bunker 82 (Fig. 4).<br>
A purge gas inlet 83 feeds flue gas into hopper 82. Being about 80% nitrogen and about<br>
20% carbon dioxide, flue gas helps insure that the reformation process in reformer 100<br>
will be carried out anaerobically. Hopper 82 also includes a vent 84 for venting flue<br>
gas.<br>
From hopper 82, feedstock settles into tube 85, which extends from the bottom of<br>
hopper 82. The feedstock is metered by rotary valve 87 into feed tube 90, at the bottom<br>
of which it is entrained with steam under pressure entering from steam line 95. To keep<br>
feedstock flowing into the stream of steam, and in order to counter steam back pressure<br>
in pipe 90, a supply of flue gas 18 is moved through line 75 via compressor 76 to inlet<br>
91 near the top of feed tube 90 (Figs. 4 and 5). To prevent the pressure in tube 90 from<br>
blowing feedstock back into rotary valve 87, some of the flue gas is also split off from<br>
line 75 and fed to inlet 88 of rotary valve 87. Rotary valve 87 includes a central rotor<br>
having a plurality of vanes 87a which divide the interior of valve 87 into separate<br>
compartments. Opposite inlet 88 on rotary valve 87, is outlet pressure vent 89. As the<br>
rotor of valve 87 rotates counterclockwise, the compartment formed by vanes 87a at the<br>
top fill with feedstock. That filled compartment is then rotated counterclockwise until it<br>
opens to inlet 88, where it is pressurized with incoming flue gas. As the rotor rotates<br>
further, the feedstock filled and pressurized chamber opens into feed tube 90. Since the<br>
pressure in the rotor chamber is equalized with the pressure in tube 90, the feedstock<br>
falls down into tube 90. As the valve rotor continues on its counterclockwise journey, it<br>
is eventually vented through vent 89, such that when the chamber reaches feed tube 85<br>
again, it is depressurized and will not vent back up into feed tube 85. After feedstock has<br>
moved through rotary valve 87 and into feed tube 90, it feeds by gravity into mixing<br>
chamber 93 at the bottom of tube 90, where superheated steam (510Â° C. (950Â° F.)<br>
steam) from steam line 95 is mixed with feedstock.<br>
Superheated steam carries the feedstock to feedstock reformer 100 (Fig. 4). In<br>
the process of heating up the feedstock, the steam cools to approximately 204Â° C. (400Â°<br>
F.) as the superheated steam and feedstock approach wood reformer 100. Within<br>
feedstock reformer 100 a flow divider 101 distributes the cooled steam and feedstock<br>
into about 76 millimeter (3-inch) diameter tubing coils 102 through which steam and<br><br>
feedstock pass. Feedstock reformation carried out in feedstock reformer 100 is<br>
endothermic. Heat for the feedstock reformation process is provided by burners 103 at<br>
the bottom of feedstock reformer 100. Excess syngas or any other fuel can be burned in<br>
burners 103 at the bottom of reformer 100. The flue gas 18 from burners 103 passes<br>
through a heat exchanger 104, used to help superheat the incoming stream of water la to<br>
superheated steam 1, and then into flue gas lines 53, 83 and 75 (Fig. 4). For greater<br>
energy independence of the overall process, even more excess syngas can be made and<br>
used to run a turbine and generate electricity to power the compressors and other<br>
electrically driven devices.<br>
The inlet temperature of the feedstock and superheated steam 1 entering<br>
feedstock reformer 100 is about 204Â° C. (400Â° F.) The exit temperature of the syngas<br>
leaving feedstock reformer 100 is between 871Â° C. (1600Â° F.) and 1204Â° C. (2200Â° F.),<br>
preferably about 898Â° C. (1650Â° F.) to about 926Â° C. (1700Â° F.) At 1093Â° C. (2000Â°<br>
F.) and above, with a contact time of 5.0 seconds, one obtains less than one mole<br>
percent of methane and a great deal of CO2, which is an undesirable result. Pressure in<br>
feedstock reformer 100 does not appear to be critical. The reformer is preferably run at<br>
a pressure of about 241 kilopascals (KPa) (35 psig) to about 276 KPa (40 psig).<br>
For any given feedstock, one can vary the proportions of hydrogen, carbon<br>
dioxide, carbon monoxide and methane which are contained in the resulting syngas<br>
stream as a function of contact time in the reformer, temperature at exit, the amount of<br>
steam introduced, and to a lesser extent, pressure (Fig. 2). Certain proportions of<br>
syngas components are better than others for producing alcohols, while other proportions<br>
are preferred for producing alkanes. Generally speaking, if one wants to produce<br>
alkanes, one prefers a syngas stream containing more carbon monoxide and methane<br>
relative to hydrogen than is desired when one wishes to produce ethanol or methanol.<br>
Fig. 2 graphs the approximate syngas content as a function of contact time for a<br>
feedstock converter run on wood, with an exit gas temperature of 898Â° C. (1650Â° F.) to<br>
926Â° C. (1700Â° F.) Water content and the mole percents of other constituents in the gas<br>
are not shown in Fig. 2. Ninety-nine percent conversion occurs at 0.4 seconds. As can<br>
be seen, as contact time increases, the amount of hydrogen obtained increases, the<br>
amount of carbon monoxide decreases, the amount of carbon dioxide increases, and the<br><br>
amount of methane decreases slightly. By adjusting the contact time, one can optimize<br>
these ingredients for the production of alcohols. Generally speaking, one wants a<br>
contact time of from about 0.4 seconds to about 5.0 seconds, with from about 1.0<br>
seconds to about 3.0 seconds being preferred for the production of ethanol. It is most<br>
preferable to operate at an exit temperature of about 898Â° C. (1650Â° F.) to about 926Â°<br>
C. (1700Â° F.) with about 1.0 seconds to about 2.0 seconds contact time in the reformer.<br>
Contact time is calculated by dividing the internal volume of the reformer by the flow<br>
rate of the syngas exiting the reformer. Fig. 2 would, of course, look different for<br>
different operating feedstock, as well as different amounts of steam and different<br>
temperatures and pressures.<br>
The amount of superheated steam 1 used is a function of the nature of the<br>
feedstock used. Steam provides the additional hydrogen necessary to maximize alcohol<br>
production from the feedstock. In terms of the carbon to hydrogen stoichiometric ratio<br>
in lower alcohols such as methanol and ethanol, dry feedstock typically has a<br>
stoichiometric excess of carbon relative to hydrogen. Thus water, either trapped in the<br>
feedstock or in the form of superheated steam, or both, provides additional hydrogen to<br>
maximize alcohol production. Preferably, the feedstock is relatively dry, and the water<br>
necessary is provided in the form of added superheated steam. For making alcohol from<br>
wood feedstock, one preferably uses from about 0.14 kilograms (0.3 pounds) to about<br>
0.18 kilograms (0.4 pounds) of steam per pound of "dry" feedstock. Since the "dry"<br>
feedstock in our process contains about 9% to about 15% moisture, one has a total water<br>
to wood ratio of about 0.4 to 0.5. This results in a fairly efficient operation.<br>
Exemplary feedstock which can be used include: lignite, coal, red cedar,<br>
southern pine, hardwoods such as oak, cedar, maple and ash, bagasse, rice hulls, rice<br>
straw, kennaf (a weed), sewer sludge, motor oil, oil shale, creosote, pyrolysis oil from a<br>
tire pyrolysis plant, old railroad ties, dried distiller grains, corn stalks and cobs, animal<br>
excrement, and straw. The hydrogen and oxygen content for various different wood<br>
materials are shown in Table 1 below:<br><br><br>
Note 1: Oxygen is not analyzed for in the sample.<br>
Similar information is provided for several other feedstock in Table 2, except that the<br>
hydrogen and oxygen content is expressed on a "per carbon" basis:<br><br>
amaf: moisture and ash-free material.<br>
bmf: moisture-free material.<br>
Reaction (1) is an illustrative assumption of the feedstock conversion reaction:<br>
C4H6O2 + C4H6O3 + H2O â H2 + CO + CO2 + CH4 (1)<br>
The foregoing is, of course, merely illustrative, and is not expressed<br>
quantitatively. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the actual hydrocarbon<br>
analysis for wood may vary significantly from this approximation. The quantitative<br>
content of the syngas stream will be determined as a function of feedstock used, quantity<br>
of steam used, reformation temperature and contact time in the reformer, as discussed<br>
above in connection with Figure 2.<br>
Syngas stream 3 passes from feedstock reformer 100 through a heat exchanger<br>
110, where water la is preheated. The preheated water/steam then passes through heat<br>
exchanger 104, where it is further heated by flue gas from reformer 100 and becomes a<br><br>
stream of superheated steam 1 at a temperature of from about 454Â° C. (850Â° F.) to<br>
about 510Â° C. (950Â° F.) It is this superheated steam which is combined with feedstock<br>
stream 2 and is fed into feedstock reformer 100.<br>
From heat exchanger 110, syngas stream 3 passes through a gas filtering device<br>
120 and a cyclone 130, both of which are used to remove ash from syngas stream 3.<br>
Syngas stream 3 is then further washed and cooled with water in water washing unit<br>
140. Water washing unit 140 comprises a column which is packed with conventional<br>
packing materials such as copper tubing, pall rings, metal mesh or other inert materials.<br>
Syngas stream 3 passes upwardly through the water washing column while water flows<br>
down through the upcoming syngas stream. The water wash serves to further cool<br>
syngas stream 3 to ambient temperature, and to remove any ash which may escape filter<br>
120 and cyclone 130, though there should be no ash present unless there has been a rip<br>
in the filter bags of filter 120. Water from water washing unit 140 is recycled as stream<br>
4. Stream 4 is de-gassed, filtered and passed through a carbon bed to remove organics.<br>
The water is then ready for re-use as needed in the system.<br>
The syngas stream 3 at near ambient temperature passes through an oil-washing<br>
column 150. Column 150 is packed with conventional packing materials such as copper<br>
tubing, pall rings, metal mesh or other inert materials. Syngas stream 3 passes upwardly<br>
through oil washing column 150 while C-20 petroleum oil flows down through the<br>
upcoming syngas stream to remove any benzene, toluene, xylene or heavier<br>
hydrocarbons which may have been produced in feedstock reformer 100. The oil,<br>
benzene, toluene, xylene and heavier hydrocarbons exiting oil-washing column 150 are<br>
recycled as stream 16 through feedstock reformer 100.<br>
Stream 3 then passes through an amine-scrubbing unit 160, which removes<br>
carbon dioxide from syngas stream 3. A pressure swing adsorbent (PSA) unit, discussed<br>
below in connection with hydrogen removal, could be used instead of an amine scrubber<br>
to remove the carbon dioxide. In this process the syngas is scrubbed with an amine<br>
based solvent in an absorption column. The solvent is regenerated in a second column<br>
thereby releasing a high purity CO2 product. The carbon dioxide passes as stream 8 to<br>
Unit IV. Syngas stream 5, with the carbon dioxide removed, then passes on to Unit II.<br><br>
Unit II: Syngas Compression and Hydrogen Removal<br>
In Unit n, syngas stream 5 from Unit I, and syngas stream 13 from Unit V, are<br>
compressed in compressor 200, to a pressure of between 8273 KPa (1200 psi) and<br>
16,547 KPa (2400 psi). The resulting compressed, mixed syngas stream (a mixture of<br>
streams 5 and 13) is fed to a pressure swing adsorbent (PSA) unit 210, which is used to<br>
remove a portion of the hydrogen (stream 10) from syngas stream 5 and 13. Pressure<br>
swing adsorption (PSA) is an adiabatic process and is applied for partial hydrogen<br>
removal from syngas by removing some of the hydrogen by adsorption through suitable<br>
adsorbents in fixed beds contained in pressure vessels under high pressure.<br>
Regeneration of adsorbents is accomplished by countercurrent depressurization and by<br>
purging at low pressure with previously recovered hydrogen gas. To obtain a<br>
continuous flow of product, a minimum of two adsorbers is needed, such that at least<br>
one adsorber is receiving feed gas. Simultaneously, the subsequent steps of<br>
depressurization, purging and repressurization back to the adsorption pressure are<br>
executed by the other adsorber(s). After such adsorbent regeneration and<br>
repressurization the adsorber is switched onto adsorption duty, whereupon another<br>
adsorber is regenerated. For removing hydrogen, the adsorbent used is silica gel.<br>
An alternative type of hydrogen separator which might be used to separate a<br>
portion of the hydrogen from the syngas stream would be a hydrogen specific permeable<br>
membrane separator.<br>
The amount of hydrogen removed from syngas stream 5 and 13 is controlled by<br>
controlling the ratio of syngas which is fed into PSA Unit 210, to that which is diverted<br>
by valve 211 to bypass PSA Unit 210. Gas chromatographic analysis is used to<br>
determine whether the hydrogen content of syngas stream 6 feeding to ethanol reactor<br>
300 is that which is desired. Sufficient hydrogen is removed in PSA Unit 210 to leave a<br>
syngas stream 6 in which the molar ratio of hydrogen to carbon monoxide is about 1.1:1<br>
to about 1.3:1, preferably 1.1:1.0. Recycle stream 17 may also be monitored. If excess<br>
internally produced hydrogen builds up in recycle stream 17, one might have the system<br>
divert even more hydrogen to stream 10 being diverted to reactor 400.<br>
Unreacted hydrogen in ethanol reactor 300 is recycled (stream 17) and combined<br>
with syngas stream 6 as it enters ethanol reactor 300, thus increasing the molar ratio of<br><br>
hydrogen to carbon monoxide in reactor 300. Ideally, 2 moles of hydrogen react with 1<br>
mole of carbon monoxide and 1 mole of methanol to produce 1 mole of ethanol and 1<br>
mole of water.<br>
The removed hydrogen stream 10 is conveyed to Fischer-Tropsch reactor 400 in<br>
Unit IV, which is catalyzed to produce methanol. The remaining syngas stream 6 passes<br>
over scavenger beds 220, commonly referred to in the art as "guard cat beds," which<br>
remove any chlorine, sulfur or heavy hydrocarbon impurities from syngas stream 6.<br>
Exemplary materials which may be used in beds 220 include activated carbon to remove<br>
hydrocarbons, zinc oxide to remove sulfur and silica gel to remove chlorides.<br>
Unit III: Ethanol Production<br>
After leaving guard cat beds 220, syngas stream 6 passes to said ethanol<br>
catalyzed Fischer-Tropsch reactor 300, at a pressure of between about 4481 KPa (650<br>
psi) and about 13,790 KPa (2000 psi). It is joined by recycling syngas stream 17, and<br>
methanol stream 11 from methanol reactor 400. The combined stream is fed to ethanol<br>
catalyzed Fischer-Tropsch reactor 300. Syngas stream 17 is fed under pressure via<br>
compressor so that its pressure at least equals the pressure in the line feeding stream 6.<br>
Similarly, liquid methanol stream 11 is pumped into the line carrying syngas streams 6<br>
and 17. All three lines are equipped with check valves to make certain that there is no<br>
back flow into the respective lines.<br>
Fischer-Tropsch reactor 300 comprises a series of stainless steel tubes, each<br>
approximately 25 millimeters (1 inch) to 51 millimeters (2 inches) in inside diameter.<br>
The tubes are loaded with a catalyst which favors the production of ethanol. Larger<br>
diameter tubes give more production capacity, but also allow for the generation of more<br>
heat, which it is deleterious to the catalyst. Thus, the tube diameter is usually selected<br>
as a compromise between flow through capacity desired and the ease with which the heat<br>
can be controlled.<br>
The production of ethanol generates considerably more heat than does the<br>
production of methanol. One has to remove about 2.6 times as much heat from an<br>
ethanol catalyzed Fischer-Tropsch reactor as from a Fischer-Tropsch reactor catalyzed to<br>
produce methanol.<br><br>
The threshold temperature for ethanol production is about 260Â° C. at the<br>
pressures at which this reactor operates. This elevated temperature is imparted to the<br>
syngas stream in part through compression in syngas compressor 200, and in part<br>
through heat exchange with the reaction products of ethanol reactor 300 using<br>
conventional heat exchange techniques and equipment. The ethanol reactor operates at<br>
from about 300Â° C. to about 500Â° C., and a pressure of from about 4481 KPa (650 psi)<br>
to about 13,790 KPa (2000 psi). The gas hourly space velocity of the ethanol reactor is<br>
between 8,000 per hour and 50,000 per hour.<br>
In reactor 300, a great deal of heat is generated which must be removed from the<br>
interior of the reactor to keep it from overheating. In the preferred embodiment, heat is<br>
removed and temperature controlled within reactor 300 by introducing a C-20 petroleum<br>
oil directly into the reactor tubes. Jacket cooling is also employed in addition, or as an<br>
alternative, but direct oil cooling is preferred. The oil passing through the reaction tubes<br>
of reactor 300 is cooled by removing it from the reactor and passing it through a heat<br>
exchanger where it boils water to create steam for use as needed in the system. The<br>
gaseous reactants and reaction products are passing through the oil as it is pumped<br>
through the reactor.<br>
A unique ethanol catalyst is employed in the preferred embodiment. Although it<br>
probably catalyzes the formation of some methanol, the catalyst is designed to favor the<br>
production of ethanol from methanol feedstock, rather than to produce methanol in the<br>
same reactor which then converts it to ethanol. Reactor 300 relies on methanol coming<br>
from methanol reactor 400 for conversion to ethanol.<br>
The catalyst consists essentially of elemental cobalt as its primary constituent,<br>
with minor amounts of manganese, zinc, chromium and/or aluminum, and an alkali or<br>
alkaline earth promoter, with potassium carbonate being preferred for economic reasons.<br>
Preferably, it comprises on a metal elemental basis ex binder from about 65% to about<br>
75% elemental cobalt, about 4% to about 12% manganese, about 4% to about 10% zinc,<br>
about 6% to about 10% chromium and/or about 6% to about 10% aluminum.<br>
While the catalyst as used consists primarily of the above elements in their<br>
elemental form, the catalyst begins as a mixture of metal salts. Nitrates or carbonates<br>
are typically used. The catalyst goes through a "conditioning" process. In the<br><br>
conditioning process, title salts are largely reduced to their metallic elements, with some<br>
oxides remaining to form a lattice structure referred to as "spinels." The spinels help<br>
give the catalyst its overall spatial structure.<br>
The catalyst may be used in its "pure" (or concentrated) form, or it may be<br>
diluted with carbon, by loading onto carbon pellets. The latter is often referred to as a<br>
supported catalyst. A pure catalyst will tend to run hotter than a supported catalyst,<br>
creating a process cooling challenge. On the other hand, a more pure catalyst will be<br>
more active and hence can be used at lower reaction temperatures. If lower reaction<br>
temperatures can be used, the catalyst will last longer. Thus, a compromise must often<br>
be reached between the desirability of using a more active catalyst and the need to dilute<br>
it somewhat in order to facilitate temperature control.<br>
To prepare the catalyst for use in its pure form, the salts in appropriate<br>
proportions are combined with about 3% to about 4% by weight of a binder and about<br>
VA % to about % % lubricant. The salts, binder and lubricant mixture are pelletized in a<br>
pelletizer - basically a tableting machine - where pellets 4 millimeters to 6 millimeters<br>
in diameter and 6 millimeters to 10 millimeters in length are pressed at approximately<br>
262,000 KPa (38,000 psi). The pellets are then calcined by heating them at a rate of<br>
about 60Â° C. per 10 minutes, to a temperature of around 450Â° C, where they are held<br>
for about two hours under a nitrogen blanket. The pellets are then allowed to cool, prior<br>
to conditioning.<br>
A supported catalyst is prepared by slurrying carbon pellets in a solution of the<br>
catalyst salts in appropriate proportions. The surface area of the carbon pellets is<br>
typically around 1200 square meters per gram. The water is evaporated off to leave<br>
catalyst loaded pellets. This process may have to be repeated to obtain the desired ratio<br>
of catalyst to carbon pellet. The catalyst loaded carbon pellets typically comprise from<br>
about 20% to about 40% catalyst. The catalyst loaded pellets need to be small enough to<br>
be packed into the reaction tubes. One wants to avoid dust, because it packs and clogs<br>
the tubes. Preferably, the pellets are from about 2 millimeters to about 4 millimeters in<br>
diameter, and from about 4 millimeters to about 10 millimeters long.<br>
Either the pure catalyst pellets or the catalyst loaded carbon pellets must then be<br>
conditioned before being used. The conditioning process involves passing reducer-doped<br><br>
nitrogen over beds of the pellets. Initially, one begins with nitrogen doped with about<br>
1% hydrogen. The doped gas is preheated to about 200Â° C, and as it passes over the<br>
catalyst bed, a reduction process is initiated which is exothermic and causes the reaction<br>
bed to heat to about 400Â° C. The reaction is initially carried on at a pressure of about<br>
172 KPa (25 psig) to about 207 KPa (30 psig).<br>
As the process proceeds, one measures the bed temperature and the gas<br>
temperature. As the temperature falls off, one adds additional amounts of hydrogen,<br>
building up to a level of about 25% to about 30% hydrogen. Pressure is also gradually<br>
increased over time, until it reaches about 4137 KPa (600 psig) to about 6895 KPa (1000<br>
psig). After additional hydrogen ceases to be effective in maintaining temperature,<br>
carbon monoxide is added to the reaction stream. Syngas can be used as a source of<br>
carbon monoxide. Some of the hydrogen is replaced with the syngas or carbon<br>
monoxide stream.<br>
The conditioned catalyst pellets are then cooled and put into drums under an inert<br>
gas purge, e.g., a nitrogen blanket. One cannot allow air to get to the catalyst. It is<br>
important that the catalyst be substantially free of oxygen. To the extent oxygen is<br>
contained in the catalyst, it reacts with hydrogen in the ethanol reactor and releases a<br>
great deal of excess and unwanted heat. Temperatures can rise to as high as about<br>
1600Â° C.<br>
It has been found that the present method produces about 0.11 kilograms (0.25<br>
pounds) to about 0.14 kilograms (0.30 pounds) of ethanol per hour per pound of<br>
catalyst.<br>
A number of reactions occur in ethanol catalyzed reactor 300, with the primary<br>
reactions being as follows:<br>
2CO + H2 + CH3OHâ C2H5OH + CC2	(2)<br>
CO + 2H2 + CH3 OH â C2H5OH + H2O	(3)<br>
2CH3 OH â C2H5OH + H2O	(4)<br>
CO + 2H2 â CH3OH	(5)<br>
CO + H2O â CO2 + H2	(6)<br>
2CO + 2H2 â CH4 + CO2	(7)<br>
CO + 3H2 â CH4 + H2O	(8)<br><br>
The reactions of primary importance are reactions (2-5). Reactions (2) - (4) are<br>
important because they form ethanol. Reaction (5) forms methanol, some of which reacts<br>
in reactions (2), (3) and (4), and some of which is recycled from the alcohol distillation.<br>
Reactions (7) and (8) take place to some extent, requiring ultimately some conversion of<br>
methane to carbon monoxide and hydrogen in the methane reformer (also referred to as<br>
the recycle reformer), though some methane may be recycled to the feedstock reformer<br>
to minimize the ongoing generation of methane in the feedstock reformer.<br>
Notwithstanding the fact that the catalyst is designed to form ethanol, it is<br>
probable that some methanol is also being formed in the ethanol reactor. It is desirable to<br>
have methanol present in stoichiometric excess, as it tends to drive the reaction towards<br>
production of ethanol. Some higher alcohols and some alkanes are also formed. A small<br>
amount of carbon dioxide and methane are formed in ethanol reactor 300. Small<br>
amounts of methyl and ethyl formate are also formed in an equilibrium reaction.<br>
The reaction products from ethanol reactor 300 pass to cooling and separation<br>
unit 310. Here, the alcohols are cooled to liquids and are separated from the gaseous<br>
elements, hydrogen, carbon monoxide and methane. The alcohols pass as stream 7 to an<br>
alcohol distillation unit. The gases are carried on to another amine scrubbing unit 320,<br>
or a PSA unit, which separates the carbon dioxide into stream 9 from the remaining<br>
gases, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, methane and other minor amounts of gases which<br>
pass to recycle stream 17, and a portion of which are bled off as purge gas stream 12 at<br>
valve 321. The recycling methyl and ethyl formate keep more from forming during the<br>
reaction.<br>
Alcohol cooling and separation unit 310 comprises two coolers. One is a cross<br>
exchange unit and one is a water cooling tower. The cooled liquid/gas stream passes to a<br>
gas/liquid separator, with the liquid being passed by a stream 7 to the distillation column<br>
and the gas stream passing to a carbon dioxide separator 320. The separated carbon<br>
dioxide stream 9 is recycled to the methanol catalyzed Fischer-Tropsch reactor 400.<br>
Unit IV: The Methanol Reactor (MR)<br>
Hydrogen stream 10 from Unit II, carbon dioxide stream 8 from Unit I and<br>
carbon dioxide stream 9 from Unit III are fed through a surge tank 401 to Fischer-<br>
Tropsch reactor 400 which is catalyzed to favor the production of methanol (the<br><br>
methanol reactor). Its construction is the same as that of ethanol reactor 300. The<br>
catalyst used is a conventional methanol catalyst, primarily copper, with a minor amount<br>
of an alkali metal promoter. As received, they comprise copper oxide, zinc oxide,<br>
aluminum oxide and an alkali metal promoter. Copper oxide comprises about 50% to<br>
about 60%, preferably 55%, zinc oxide from about 21% to about 25%, aluminum oxide<br>
from about 8% to about 10% and the other ingredients being precedent in minor<br>
amounts. As with the ethanol catalyst, the methanol catalyst must be conditioned prior to<br>
use, such that it substantially comprises the metals in elemental form.<br>
Methanol reactor 400 is operated under a pressure of 4137 KPa (650 psig) to<br>
about 13,790 KPa (2000 psig) and at a temperature of 260Â° C. to 305Â° C. The gas<br>
hourly space velocity in the methanol reactor is from about 15,000 per hour to about<br>
110,000 per hour. The pressure in hydrogen stream 10 is adjusted as necessary to 4137<br>
KPa (650 psi) to 13,790 KPa (2000 psi). A compressor is used to pressurize carbon<br>
dioxide stream 8 coming from Unit I. Similarly, a compressor is used to compress<br>
carbon dioxide stream 9 coming from Unit III. AH three lines are thus introduced into<br>
reactor 400 at the operating pressure of reactor 400, and each line includes a back flow<br>
check valve.<br>
As they are fed from surge tank 401, carbon dioxide streams 8 and 9 are<br>
combined with hydrogen stream 10. The combined reactant streams 8 -10 are preheated<br>
to the threshold reaction temperature of 260Â° C. to 305Â° C. by heat exchange with the<br>
product stream exiting the reactor, and/or as part of a heat exchange system for the<br>
reactor itself. As with the ethanol reactor, heat in methanol reactor 400 has to be<br>
controlled by removing some of the exothermic heat of reaction. This may be<br>
accomplished in methanol reactor 400 by oil cooling, as is done in the ethanol reactor<br>
300, or by withdrawing gases from the reactor, cooling them in a heat exchanger, and<br>
returning them to the reactor.<br>
Surge tank 401 offers the operator a way of controlling peaks and valleys which<br>
may occur from time to time in the carbon dioxide content of the reaction system.<br>
Appropriate controls can be employed for accomplishing this automatically.<br>
The principle methanol reaction between carbon dioxide and hydrogen is as<br>
follows:<br>
3H2 + CO2 â CH3OH + H2O	(9)<br><br>
To some extent, other reactions also occur, but the methanol reaction (9) is predominant.<br>
The reaction products from methanol reactor 400 are passed to a cooling and<br>
separation station 410. Cooling is accomplished by heat exchange with incoming<br>
reactants, with water, and/or in a water cooling tower. The cooled liquid and gas<br>
products are separated in a liquid gas separator and the liquids are passed to a distillation<br>
column 420. Unreacted gaseous hydrogen and carbon dioxide as well as any methane<br>
which may have been formed are simply recycled back into reactor 400. Distilled<br>
methanol stream 11 is passed to Unit III where it is introduced into the ethanol reactor<br>
300. Water stream 14 is recycled to Unit I where it is joined with incoming water stream<br>
la and converted to superheated steam 1.<br>
Unit V: The Methane Reformer<br>
When the methane content in recycling syngas stream 17 reaches about 30%,<br>
valve 321 is operated to divert the syngas stream or a portion thereof, as stream 12, to<br>
methane reformer 500, via a methane surge tank 501. Surge tank 501 serves the same<br>
purpose for methane as is served by surge tank 401 for carbon dioxide. It may also be<br>
automatically controlled.<br>
Methane reformer 500 is constructed in a standard manner. In reformer 500, the<br>
methane component of syngas stream 12 is reacted with steam, fed as stream 15 into<br>
reformer 500. A conventional nickel catalyst is used. The steam used may be<br>
independently heated, or may be diverted from stream 1, generated at heat recovery unit<br>
110 and heat exchanger 104. The reaction is carried on at 843Â° C. (1550Â° F.) to 898Â°<br>
C. (1650Â° F.), 1034 KPa (150 psig) to 2758 KPa (400 psig), and a gas hourly space<br>
velocity (GHSV) of 11,000 per hour.<br>
The reaction of the steam and the methane in gas stream 12 is basically as<br>
follows:<br>
CH4 + H2O â CO + 3H2	(10)<br>
The reaction products proceed to a cooling and separation unit 510 where syngas<br>
stream 13 is separated from unreacted water (stream 19). Syngas stream 13 contains the<br>
carbon monoxide and hydrogen generated in methane reformer 500, as well as any<br>
hydrogen and carbon monoxide which was contained in entry syngas stream 12.<br>
Recovered water is recycled and converted to steam for introduction ultimately into<br>
steam stream 15 or stream 1.<br><br>
Illustrative Reaction Scheme<br>
The following is an illustrative reaction scheme. It is theoretical in nature, and<br>
does not take into consideration every reaction that is occurring in the process of the<br>
present invention. For example, the illustration ignores completely reaction (7) of carbon<br>
monoxide and hydrogen to methane and carbon dioxide, and the various reactions which<br>
form methanol in the ethanol reactor. Also, the reactions are not shown quantitatively.<br>
Accordingly, this illustration is merely for purposes of helping to illustrate how the<br>
process, flows, and is not intended and should not be interpreted as being a quantitative<br>
representation. The various reactions used in the following scheme have/been discussed<br>
above, and accordingly are labeled with the same numbers they have been given above.<br>
To help one follow the flow, the reaction scheme indicates where the various<br>
reaction products will flow. Thus of hydrogen produced in the feedstock reaction, some<br>
will be diverted to the methanol reactor at hydrogen removal unit 210. The rest will<br>
flow with the carbon monoxide and methane into the ethanol reactor. This is in keeping<br>
with the discussion above, which suggests allowing about 1 to about 1.1 parts of<br>
hydrogen per one part of carbon monoxide to continue in the syngas stream to the<br>
ethanol reactor, while diverting the rest to the methanol reactor.<br>
For each successive reaction, any ingredients or portions of ingredients which do<br>
not participate in the reaction are indicated as being recycled or as passing through the<br>
reactor. The reaction scheme includes two passes through the methanol and ethanol<br>
reactors. Obviously in actual practice, the process is ongoing such that the reactions will<br>
not flow linearly to completion of a single overall reaction.<br><br><br>
CUM RECYCLE (some H2O)<br>
The legends underneath feedstock reformation reaction (1) show the diversion of<br>
the carbon dioxide and some of the hydrogen to the methanol reactor, with the rest of<br>
the syngas stream including hydrogen, carbon monoxide and methane, going to the<br>
ethanol reactor. The reactions occurring in the methanol and ethanol reactors are<br>
numbered, illustrating different passes of the reactants through the reactors as they cycle<br>
through the process.<br>
The MEOH-1 reaction shows the reaction products going on to the ethanol<br>
reactor, with unused carbon dioxide being recycled. The ETOH-1 reactions illustrate<br><br>
several different reactions which can be occurring in the ethanol reactor at the same<br>
time. The ETOH-1 reactions illustrate how reaction (6) can produce enough hydrogen<br>
internally to supplement the conversion of carbon monoxide and methanol to ethanol in<br>
reaction (2). Reactions (2) and (3) have been combined in this illustrative reaction<br>
scheme. As illustrated, reaction (6) in ETOH-1 produces an excess of hydrogen which<br>
is then recycled in the ethanol reactor. Carbon dioxide produced in reaction (6) is<br>
removed as shown in Fig. 1 and forwarded to the methanol reactor as carbon dioxide<br>
stream 9. Carbon dioxide formed in reaction 3 is removed via scrubber 320, and the<br>
hydrogen would be part of recycle stream 17 going back through ethanol reactor 300.<br>
ETOH-1 reaction (2) illustrates the formation of ethanol from carbon monoxide<br>
and hydrogen from the syngas stream, as well as hydrogen produced in ethanol reactor<br>
300 by reaction 4, and from methanol introduced in methanol reactor 400. A portion of<br>
the water formed is shown as being diverted to the methane recycle reformer along with<br>
the methane which is indicated as being a "pass through" in the ethanol reactor. As<br>
noted above, the methane and water produced would actually recycle until such time as<br>
it is determined that some of the methane should be bled off and either diverted to the<br>
recycle reformer 500 or back to feedstock reactor 100, as discussed above. Showing a<br>
portion of the water and the methane as proceeding directly to the recycle reformer is<br>
thus only for illustrative purposes. The unreacted water shown as coming into ETOH-1<br>
from MEOH-1, along with water produced in ETOH-1, to the extent not diverted to the<br>
recycle reformer, are shown as part of the recycle stream for the ethanol reactor.<br>
The recycle reformer reaction RR (10) illustrates the conversion of methane to<br>
carbon monoxide and hydrogen by reaction with steam. The carbon monoxide and<br>
hydrogen are sent via stream 13 to syngas compression unit 200, and a portion of the<br>
hydrogen is shown as being diverted to the methanol reactor via hydrogen removal unit<br>
210, as hydrogen stream 10.<br>
MEOH-2 then shows the reaction of hydrogen which has been diverted to the<br>
methanol reactor with more of the carbon dioxide to yield additional methanol and<br>
water. These are shown as being conveyed to the ethanol reactor, via stream 11. The<br>
cumulative recycle of carbon dioxide in unit IV is also indicated.<br><br>
ETOH-2 shows a repeat of reactions (2)-(4) as well as reaction (6), based on the<br>
reactant inputs received from the various reactions discussed above. The hydrogen<br>
formed in reaction (6) in the ETOH-2 pass is used internally in reaction (2). The<br>
ETOH-2 reaction (3) forms carbon dioxide which would normally be sent to the<br>
methanol reactor.<br>
As discussed above, this reaction is illustrative only, to demonstrate how the<br>
various reactants will flow through the process. It is not shown quantitatively. In actual<br>
practice, the hydrocarbon content of the feedstock used will vary, yields will vary, and<br>
other reactions will take place in the process. The foregoing is an illustrative discussion<br>
only.<br>
Conclusion<br>
The preferred embodiments discussed above provide for efficient handling and<br>
processing of feedstock to useful end products, the preferred end product in this case<br>
being ethanol. By varying contact time and conditions in the feedstock reformer, one<br>
can optimize the syngas stream for the production of the desired end product.<br>
The syngas stream products are utilized efficiently to optimize yields. The<br>
internal production of hydrogen, the use of carbon dioxide and hydrogen to first form<br>
methanol in one reactor and then combine the resulting methanol with the remaining<br>
syngas stream in a reactor especially catalyzed to favor the production of ethanol, further<br>
help optimize ethanol production.<br>
The recycling of methane to the feedstock reformer helps minimize the<br>
generation of further methane. Alternatively, recycling the methane through a reformer<br>
with steam creates carbon monoxide and hydrogen which can be reinjected into the<br>
syngas stream to provide further raw materials for forming ethanol.<br>
Of course, it is understood that the foregoing are merely preferred embodiments<br>
of the invention and that various changes and alterations can be made without departing<br>
from the spirit and broader aspects of the invention.<br><br>
