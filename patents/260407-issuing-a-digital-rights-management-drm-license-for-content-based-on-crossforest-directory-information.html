entitled "Reviewing Cached User-Group information in Connection with Issuing a<br>
Digital Rights Management (DRM) License for Content".<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to a digital rights management (DRM) system.<br>
More particularly, the invention relates to employing a DRM system to publish<br>
digital content in an organization such as an office or corporation or the like such<br>
that rendering and use of the content within the organization may be constrained<br>
according to corresponding use or license terms. Even more particularly, the<br>
present invention relates to issuing a digital license for corresponding digital<br>
content based on group information obtained from a directory from another forest.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Digital rights management and enforcement is highly desirable in<br>
connectie n with digital content such as digital audio, digital video, digital text,<br>
digital data, digital multimedia, etc., where such digital content is to be distributed<br>
to one or more users. Digital content could be static, such as a text document, for<br>
example, or ft cou(d be streamed, such as the streamed audio/ video of a /ive<br>
event. Typical modes of distribution include tangible devices such as a magnetic<br>
(floppy) disk, a magnetic tape, an optical (compact) disk (CD), etc., and intangible<br>
media such as an electronic bulletin board, an electronic network, the Internet, etc.<br>
Upon being received by the user, such user renders or 'plays' the digitaf content<br><br>
-3-<br>
with the aid of an appropriate rendering device such as a media player on a<br>
personal computer or the like.<br>
In one scenario, a content owner or rights-owner such as an author,<br>
a publisher, a broadcaster, etc., wishes to distribute such digital content to each of<br>
many users or recipients in exchange for a license fee or some other<br>
consideration. In such scenario, then, the content may be a song, an album of<br>
songs, a movie, etc., and the purpose of the distribution is to generale the license<br>
fees. Such content owner, given the choice, would likely wish to restrict what the<br>
user can do with such distributed digitai content. For example, the content owner<br>
would like to restrict the user from copying and re-distributing such content to a<br>
second user, at least in a manner that denies the content owner a license fee from<br>
such second user.<br>
In addition, the content owner may wish to provide the user with the<br>
flexibility to purchase different types of use licenses at different license fees, wh√ºe<br>
at the same time holding the userto the terms of whatever type of license is in fact<br>
purchased. For example, the content owner may wish to allow distributed digital<br>
content to be played only a limited number of times, only for a certain total time,<br>
only on a certain type of machine, only on a certain type of media player, only by a<br>
certain type of user, etc.<br>
In another scenario, a content developer, such as an employee in or<br>
member of an organization, wishes to distribute such digital content to one or<br>
more other employees or members in the organization or to other individuals<br>
outside the organization, but would like to keep others from rendering the content.<br>
Here, the distribution of the content is more akin to organization-based content<br>
sharing in a confidential or restricted manner, as opposed to broad-based<br>
distribution in exchange for a license fee or some other consideration.<br>
In such scenario, then, the content may be a document presentation,<br>
spreadsheet, database, email, orthe like, such as may be exchanged within an<br>
office setting, and the content developer may wish to ensure that the content stays<br>
within the organization or office setting and is not rendered by non-authorized<br>
individuals, such as for example competitors or adversaries. Again, such content<br>
developer wishes to restrict what a recipi√´nt can do with such distributed digital<br><br>
-4-<br>
content. For example, the content owner would like to restrict the user from<br>
copying and re-distributing such content to a second user, at least in a manner<br>
that exposes the content outside the bounds of individuals who should be allowed<br>
to render the content.<br>
In addition, the content developer may wish to provide various<br>
recipients with different levels of rendering rights. For exampfe, the content<br>
developer may wish to allow protected digital content to be viewable and not<br>
printable with respect to one class of individual, and viewable and printable with<br>
respect to another ctass of individual.<br>
However, and in either scenario, after distribution has occurred, such<br>
content owner / developer has very little if any control over the digital content.<br>
This is especially problematic in view of the fact that practically every personal<br>
computer includes the software and hardware necessary to make an exact digital<br>
copy of such digital content, and to download such exact digital copy to a write-<br>
able magnetic or optical disk, or to send such exact digital copy over a network<br>
such as the Internet to any destination.<br>
Of course, as part of a transaction wherein the content is distributed,<br>
the content owner / developer may require the user / recipi√´nt of the digital content<br>
to promise not to re-distribute such digital content in an unwelcome manner.<br>
However, such a promise is easily made and easily broken. A content owner /<br>
developer may attempt to prevent such re-distribution through any of several<br>
known security devices, usually involving encryption and decryption. However,<br>
tnere is likely very little that prevents a mildly determined user from decrypting<br>
encrypted digital content, saving such digital content in an un-encrypted form, and<br>
then re-distributing same.<br>
A need exists, then, for providing a digital rights management (DRM)<br>
and enforcement architecture and method that allows the controlled rendering or<br>
playing of arbitrary forms of digital content, where such control is flexible and<br>
definable by the content owner / developer of such digital content. More<br>
specifically, a need exists for such an architecture that allows and facilitates such<br>
controlled rendering, especially in an office or organization environment or the √ºke<br>
where documents are to be shared amongst a defined group of individuals or<br><br>
-5-<br>
classes of individuals. Even more specifically, a need exists for such an<br>
architecture that allows content to be licensed across pre-defined divisions or<br>
√Øorests' within the organization,<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The aforementioned needs are satisfied at least in part by the<br>
present invention in which it is determined whether a user from an organization is<br>
a member of a group pre-defined within the organization, where the organization<br>
maintains a computer network comprising at least a forest A and a forest B, where<br>
forest A has a directory A and a querying entity A capable of querying directory A,<br>
and where forest B has a directory B and a querying entity B capable of querying<br>
directory B.	<br>
In the method, querying entity A receives a request from the user<br>
and decides whether to grant the request based at least in part on whether the<br>
user is a member of the group. Thus, querying entity A queries directory A of<br>
forest A to return information on the group and in response is directed to forest B.<br>
Querying entity A therefore contacts querying entity B of forest B and requests<br>
querying entity B to query directory B whether the user is a member of the group.<br>
Querying entity A receives in response from querying entity B whether the user is<br>
in fact a member of the group, and grants the request from the user based at least<br>
in part on whether the user is a member of the group.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
COMPUTER ENVIRONMENT<br>
Fig. 1 and the following discussion are intended to provide a brief<br>
general description of a suitable computing environment in which the invention<br>
may be implemented. It should be understood, however, that handheld, portable,<br>
and other computing devices of all kinds are contemplated for use in connection<br>
with the present invention. While a genera! purpose computer is described below,<br>
this is but one example, and the present invention requires only a thin cli√´nt<br>
having network server interoperability and interaction. Tnus, the present invention<br>
may be implemented in an environment of networked hosted services in which<br>
very little or minimal cli√´nt resources are implicated, e.g., a networked<br>
envkpnrrient in which the cli√´nt device serves merely as a browser or interface to<br>
the World Wide Web.<br><br>
     Although not required, the invention can be implemented via an<br>
application programming interface (API), for use by a developer, and/or included<br>
within the network browsing software which will be described in the general<br>
context of computer-executable instructions, such as program modules, being<br>
executed by one or more computers, such as cli√´nt werkstations, servers, or other<br>
devices. Generally, program modules include routines, programs, objects,<br>
components, data structures and the like that perform particulartasks or<br>
implement particular abstract data types. Typically, the functionality of the<br><br>
-8-<br>
program modules may be combined or distributed as desired in vartous<br>
embodiments. Moreover, those skiiled in the art wili appreciate that the invention<br>
may be practiced with other computer system configurations. Other wel) known<br>
computing systems, environments, and/or configurations that .may be suitable for<br>
use with the invention inciude, but are not limited to, personal computers (PCs),<br>
automated teller machines, server computers, hand-held or laptop devices, multi-<br>
processor systems, microprocessor-based systems, programmable consumer<br>
electronics, network PCs, minicomputers, mainframe computers, and the like.<br>
The invention may also be practiced in distributed computing environments where<br>
tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a<br>
Communications network or other data transmission medium. In a distributed<br>
computing environment, program modules may be located in both local and<br>
remote computer storage media including memory storage devices.<br>
Fig. 1 thus illustrates an example of a suitabJe computing system<br>
environment 100 in which the invention may be implemented, although as made<br>
clear above, the computing system environment 100 is only one example of a<br>
suitable computing environment and is not intended to suggest any limitation as to<br>
the scope of use or functionality of the invention. Neither should the computing<br>
environment 100 be interpreted as having any dependency or requirement relating<br>
to any one or combination of components illustrated in the exemplary operating<br>
environment 100.<br>
With reference to Fig. 1, an exemplary system for implementing the<br>
invention includes a general purpose computing device in the form of a computer<br>
110. Components of computer 110 may inciude, but are not limited to, a<br>
processing unit 120, a system memory 130, and a system bus 121 that couples<br>
various system components inctuding the system memory to the processing unit<br>
120. The system bus 121 may be any of several types of bus structures including<br>
a memory bus or memory controller, a periphera! bus, and a local bus using any of<br>
a variety of bus architectures. By way of exampfe, and not limitation, such<br>
architectures inciude Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) bus, Micro Channel<br>
Architecture (MCA) bus, Enhanced ISA (EISA) bus, Video Electronics Standards<br><br>
-9-<br>
Association (VESA) local bus, and Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) bus<br>
(also known as Mezzanine bus).<br>
Computer 110 typically includes a variety of computer readable '<br>
media. Computer readable media can be any available media that can be<br>
accessed by computer 110 and includes both volatile and nonvolatile media,<br>
removable and non-removable media. By way of example, and not limitation,<br>
computer readable media may comprise computer storage media and<br>
communication media. Computer storage media includes both volatile and<br>
nonvolat√ºe, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or<br>
technology for storage of information such as computer readable instructions, data<br>
structures, program modules or other data. Computer storage media includes, but<br>
is not limited to, RAM, ROM, EEPROM, flash memory or other memory<br>
technology, CDROM, digital versatile disks (DVD) or other optical disk storage,<br>
magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic<br>
storage devices, or any other medium which can be used to store the desired<br>
information and which can be accessed by computer 110. Communication media<br>
typically embodies computer readable instructions, data structures, program<br>
modules or other data in a modulated data signal such as a carrier wave or other<br>
transport mecnanism and includes any information delivery media, The term<br>
"modulated data signal" means a signal that nas one or more of its characteristics<br>
set or changed in such a manner as to encode information in the signal. By way<br>
of example, and not limitation, communication media includes wired media such<br>
as a wired network or direct-wired connection, and wireless media such as<br><br>
acoustic, RF, infrared, and other wireless media. Combinations of any of the<br>
above should also be inciuded within the scope of computer readable media.<br>
The system memory 130 inciudes computer storage media in the<br>
form of volatile and/or nonvolatile memory such as read only memory (ROM) 131<br>
and random access memory (RAM) 132. A basic input/output system 133 (BIOS),<br>
containing the basic routines that help to transfer information between elements<br>
within computer 110, such as during start-up, is typically stored in ROM 131.<br>
RAM 132 typically contains data and/or program modules that are immediately<br>
accessible to and/or presently being operated on by processing unit 120. By way<br><br>
-10-<br>
of example, and not limitation, Fig. 1 illustrates operating system 134, appiication<br>
programs 135, other program modules 136, and program data 137.<br>
The computer 110 may also include other removable/non-<br>
removable, volatiie/nonvolatile computer storage media. By way of example oniy,<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates a hard disk drive 141 that reads from or writes to non-removable,<br>
nonvolatile magnetic media, a magnetic disk drive 151 that reads from or writes to<br>
a removable, nonvolatile magnetic disk 152, and an optical disk drive 155 that<br>
reads from or writes to a removable, nonvolatife optical disk 156, such as a CD<br>
ROM or other optical media. Other removable/non-removable, volatiie/nonvolatile<br>
computer storage media that can be used in the exempiary operating environment<br>
include, but are not limited to, magnetic tape cassettes, flash memory cards,<br>
digital versatile disks, digital video tape, solid state RAM, solid state ROM, and the<br>
like. Ihe hard disk drive 141 is typically connected to the system bus 121 through<br>
a non-removable memory interface such as interface 140, and magnetic disk drive<br>
151 and optical disk drive 155 are typically connected to the system bus 121 by a<br>
removable memory interface, such as interface 150.<br>
The drives and their associated computer storage media discussed<br>
above and illustrated in Fig. 1 provide storage of computer readable instructions,<br>
data structures, program modules and other data for the computer 110. In Fig. 1,<br>
for example, hard disk drive 141 is illustrated as storing operating system 144,<br>
appiication programs 145, other program modules 146, and program data 147.<br>
Note that these components can either be the same as or different from operating<br>
system 134, appiication programs 135, other program modules 136, and program<br>
data 137. Operating system 144, appiication programs 145, other program<br>
modules 146, and program data 147 are given different numbers here to illustrate<br>
that, at a minimum, they are different copies. A user may enter commands and<br>
information into the computer 110 through input devices such as a keyboard 162<br>
and pointing device 161, commonly referred to as a mouse, trackball ortouch pad.<br>
Other input devices (not shown) may include a microphone, joystick, game pad,<br>
satellite dish, scanner, orthe like. These and other input devices are often<br>
connected to the processing unit 120 through a user input interface 160 that is<br><br>
-11 -<br>
coupled to the system bus 121, but may be connected by other interface and bus<br>
structures, such as a parallel port, game port or a universal serial bus (USB).<br>
A monitor 191 or other type of display device is also connected to<br>
the system bus 121 via an interface, such as a video interface 190. A graphics<br>
interface 182, such as Northbridge, may aiso be connected tothe system bus 121.<br>
Northbridge is a chipset that communicates with the CPU, or host processing unit<br>
120, and assumes responsibility for accelerated graphics port (AGP)<br>
Communications. One or more graphics processing units (GPUs) 184 may<br>
communicate with graphics interface 182. In this regard, GPUs 184 generally<br>
include on-chip memory storage, such as register storage and GPUs 184<br>
communicate with a video memory 186. GPUs 184, however, are but one<br>
example of a coprocessor and thus a variety of co-processing devices may be<br>
included in computer 110. A monitor 191 or other type of display device is also<br>
connected to the system bus 121 via an interface, such as a video interface 190,<br>
which may in turn communicate with video memory 186. In addition to monitor<br>
191, computers may also include other peripheral output devices such as<br>
speakers 197 and printer 196, which may be connected through an output<br>
peripheral interface 195.<br>
The computer 110 may operate in a networked environment using<br>
logical connections to one or more remote computers, such as a remote computer<br>
180. The remote computer 180 may be a personal computer, a server, a router, a<br>
network PC, a peer device or other common network node, and typically includes<br>
many or all of the elements described above relative to the computer 110,<br>
althougn only a memory storage device 181 has been illustrated in Fig. 1. The<br>
logical connections depicted in Fig, 1 include a local area network (LAN) 171 and<br>
a wide area network (WAN) 173, but may also include other networks. Such<br>
netwerking environments are commonplace in offices, enterprise-wide computer<br>
networks, intranets and the Internet.<br>
When used in a LAN networking environment, the computer 110 is<br>
connected to the LAN 171 through a network interface or adapter 170. When<br>
used in a WAN networking environment, the computer 110 typically includes a<br>
modem 172 or other means for establishing Communications over the WAN 173,<br><br>
-12-<br>
such as the Internet. The modem 172, which may be interna! or external, may be<br>
connected to the system bus 121 via the user input interface 160, or other<br>
appropriate mechanism. In a networked environment, program modules depicted<br>
relative to the computer 110, or portions thereof, may be stored in the remote<br>
memory storage device. By way of example, and not limitation, Fig. 1 iflustrates<br>
remote application programs 185 as residing on memory device 181. It will be<br>
appreciated that the network connections shown are exemplary and other means<br>
of establishing a Communications link between the computers may be used.<br>
One of ordinary skill in the art can appreciate that a computer 110 or<br>
other cli√´nt device can be deployed as part of a computer network. In this regard,<br>
the present invention pertains to any computer system having any number of<br>
memory or storage units, and any number of applications and processes occurring<br>
across any number of storage units or volumes. The present invention may apply<br>
to an environment with server computers and cli√´nt computers deployed in a<br>
network environment, having remote or local storage. The present invention may<br>
also apply to a standalone computing device, having programming language<br>
functionality, interpretation and execution capabilities.<br>
Distributed computing facilitates sharing of computer resources and<br>
services by direct exchange between computing devices and systems. These<br>
resources and services include the exchange of information, cache storage, and<br>
disk storage for files. Distributed computing takes advantage of network<br>
connectivity, allowing clients to leverage their collective power to benefit the entire<br>
enterprise. In this regard, a variety of devices may have applications, objects or<br>
resources that may interact to implicate authentication techniques of the present<br>
invention for trusted graphics pipeline(s).<br>
Fig. 2 provides a schematic diagram of an exemplary networked or<br>
dtstributed computing environment. The distributed computing environment<br>
comprises computing objects 10a, 10b, etc. and computing objects or devices<br>
11 Oa, 110b, 110c, etc. These objects may comprise programs, methods, data<br>
stores, programmabie logic, etc. The objects may comprise portions of the same<br>
or different devices such as PDAs, televisions, MP3 players, televisions, personal<br>
computers, etc. Each object can communicate with another object by way of the<br><br>
-13-<br>
Communications network 14. This network may itself comprise other computing<br>
objects and computing devices that provide services to the system of Fig. 2. In<br>
accordance with an aspect of the invention, each object 10 or 110 may contain an<br>
application that might request the authentication techniques of the present<br>
invention for trusted graphics pipeline(s).<br>
It can also be appreciated that an object, such as 11 Oc, may be<br>
hosted on another computing device 10 or 110. Thus, although the physica)<br>
environment depicted may show the connected devices as computers, such<br>
illustrat√Øon is merely exemplary and the physical environment may alternativeiy be<br>
depicted ordescribed comprising various digital devices such as PDAs,<br>
televisions, MP3 players, etc., software objects such as interfaces, COM objects<br>
and the like.<br>
There are a variety of systems. components, and network<br>
configurations that support distributed computing environments, For example,<br>
computing systems may be connected together by wireline or wireless systems,<br>
by local networks or widely distributed networks. Currently, many of the networks<br>
are coupled to the Internet, which provides the infrastructure for widely distributed<br>
computing and encompasses many different networks.<br>
In home netwerking environments, there are at least four disparate<br>
network transport media that may each support a unique protocol such as Power<br>
line, data (both wireless and wired), voice (e.g., telephone) and entertainment<br>
media. Most home control devices such as light switches and appliances may use<br>
power line for connectivity. Data Services may enter the home as broadband<br>
(e.g., either DSL or Cable modem) and are accessible within the home using<br>
either wireless (e.g., HomeRF or 802.11 b) or wired (e.g., Home PNA, Cat 5, even<br>
power line) connectivity. Voice traffic may enter the home either as wired (e.g.,<br>
Gat 3) or wireless (e.g., cell phones) and may be distributed within the home using<br>
Cat 3 wiring. Entertainment media may enter the home either through satellite or<br>
cable and is typically distributed in the home using coaxial cable. IEEE 1394 and<br>
DVI are also emerging as digital interconnects for clusters of media devices. All of<br>
these network environments and others that may emerge as protocol standards<br>
may be interconnected to form an intranet that may be connected to the outside<br><br>
-14-<br>
worid by way of the Internet. In short, a variety of disparate sources exist for the<br>
storage and transmission of data, and consequently, moving forward, computing<br>
devices will require ways of protecting content ai al) portions of the data<br>
processing pipeline.<br>
The 'Internet' commonly refers to the collection of networks and<br>
gateways that utilize the TCP/IP suite of protocols, which are well-known in the art<br>
of computer netwerking. TCP/IP is an acronym for "Transport Control<br>
Protocol/Interface Program." The Internet can be described as a system of<br>
geographically distributed remote computer networks interconnected by<br>
computers executing netwerking protocols that allow users to interact and share<br>
Information over the networks. Because of such wide-spread information sharing,<br>
remote networks such as the Internet have thus far generally evolved into an open<br>
system for which developers can design software appiications for performing<br>
specialized operations or services, essentially without restriction.<br>
Thus, the netwerk infrastructure enables a host of network<br>
topologies such as cli√´nt/server, peer-to-peer, or hybrid architectures. The "cli√´nt"<br>
is a member of a class or group that uses the services of another class or group to<br>
which it is not related. Thus, in computing a cli√´nt is a process, i.e., roughly a set<br>
of instructions or tasks, that requests a service provided by another program. The<br>
cli√´nt process utilizes the requested service without having to "know" any working<br>
details about the other program or the service itself. In a cli√´nt/server architecture,<br>
particularty a networked system, a cli√´nt is usually a computer that accesses<br>
shared network resources provided by another computer e.g., a server.   In the<br>
example of Fig. 2, computers 11Oa, 110b, etc. can be thought of as clients and<br>
computer 10a, 10b, etc. can be thought of as the server where server 10a, 10b,<br>
etc. maintains the data that is then replicated in the cli√´nt computers 110a, 110b,<br>
etc.<br>
A server is typically a remote computer system accessible over a<br>
remote network such as the Internet. The cli√´nt process may be active in a first<br>
computer system, and the server process may be active in a second computer<br>
system, communicating with one another over a Communications medium, thus<br><br>
-15-<br>
providing distributed functionality and allowing multiple clients to take advantage<br>
of the information-gathering capabilities of the server.<br>
Client and server communicate with one another utilizing the<br>
functionality provided by a protocol layer. For example, Hypertext-Transfer<br>
Protocol (HTTP) is a common protocol that is used in conjunction with the World<br>
Wide Web (WWW). Typically, a computer network address such as a Universal<br>
Resource Locator (URL) or an Internet Protocol (IP) address is used to identify the<br>
server or cli√´nt computers to each other. The network address can be referred to<br>
as a Universal Resource Locator address. For example, communication can be<br>
provided over a Communications medium. In particular, the cli√´nt and server may<br>
be coupled to one another via TCP/IP connections for high-capacity<br>
communication.<br>
Thus, Fig. 2 illustrates an exemplary networked or distributed<br>
environment, with a server in communication with cli√´nt computers via a<br>
network/bus, in which the present invention may be employed. In more detail, a<br>
number of servers 10a, 10b, etc., are interconnected via a Communications<br>
network/bus 14, which may be a LAN, WAN, intranet, the Internet, etc., with a<br>
numberof cli√´nt or remote computing devices 11 Oa, 110b, 110c, 110d, 11 Oe,'etc.,<br>
such as a portable computer, handheld computer, thin cli√´nt, networked<br>
appliance, or other device, such as a VCR, TV, oven, light, heater and the like in<br>
accordance with the present invention. It is thus contemplated that the present<br>
invention may apply to any computing device in connection with which it is<br>
desirable to process, store or render secure content from a trusted source.<br>
In a network environment in which the Communications network/bus<br>
14 is the Internet, for example, the servers 10 can be Web servers with which the<br>
clients 11 Oa, 110b, 110c, 110d, 110e, etc. communicate via any of a numberof<br>
known protocols such as HTTP. Servers 10 may also serve as clients 110, as<br>
may be characteristic of a distributed computing environment. Communications<br>
may be wired or wireiess, where appropriate. Client devices 110 may or may not<br>
communicate via Communications network/bus 14, and may have independent<br>
Communications associated therewith. For example, in the case of a TV or VCR,<br>
there may or may not be a networked aspect to the control thereof. Each cli√´nt<br><br>
-16-<br>
computer 110 and server computer 10 may be equipped with various appfication<br>
program modules or objects 135 and with connections or access to various types<br>
of storage elements or objects, across which files may be stored or to which<br>
portion(s) of files may be downloaded or migrated. Thus, the present invention can<br>
be utilized in a computer network environment having cli√´nt computers 110a,<br>
11 Ob, etc. that can access and interact with a computer network/bus 14 and<br>
server computers 10a, 10b, etc. that may interact with cli√´nt computers 110a,<br>
110b, etc. and otherdevices 111 and databases 20.<br>
Digital Rights Management (DRM) Overview<br>
As is known, and referring now to Fig. 11, digital rights management<br>
(DRM) and enforcement is highiy destrable in connection with digital content 12<br>
such as digital audio, digital video, digital text, digital data, digital multimedia, etc.,<br>
where such digital content 12 is to be distributed to users. Upon being received<br>
by the user, such user renders or 'plays' the digital content with the aid of an<br>
appropriate rendering device such as a media playeron a personal computer 14<br>
or the like.<br>
Typically, a content owner or developer (hereinafter 'owner1)<br>
distributing such digital content 12 wishes to restrict what the user can do with<br>
such distributed digital content 12. For example, the content owner may wish to<br>
restrict the user from copying and re-distributing such content 12 to a second user,<br>
or may wish to allow distributed digital content 12 to be played only a limited<br>
number of times, only for a certain total time, only on a certain type of machine,<br>
only on a certain type of media player, only by a certain type of user, etc.<br>
However, after distribution has occurred, such content owner has<br>
very little if any control over the digital content 12. A DRM system 10, then, allows<br>
the controlled rendering or playing of arbitrary forms of digital content 12, where<br>
such control is flexible and definable by the content owner of such digital content.<br>
Typically, content 12 is distributed to the user in the form of a package 13 by way<br>
of any appropriate distribution channel. The digital content package 13 as<br>
distributed may include the digital content 12 encrypted with a symmetrie<br><br>
-17-<br>
encryption / decryption key (KD), (i.e., (KD(CONTENT))), as.well as other<br>
information identifying the content, how to acquire a license for such content, etc,<br>
The trust-based DRM system 10 allows an owner of digital content<br>
12 to specify license ruies that must be satisfied before such digital content 12 is<br>
allowed to be rendered on a user's computing device 14. Such license rules can<br>
√Ønclude the aforementioned temporal requirement, and may be embodied within a<br>
digital √ºcense or use document (hereinafter 'license1) 16 that the user / user's<br>
computing device 14 (hereinafter, such terms are interchangeable unless<br>
circumstances require otherwise) must obtain from the content owner or an agent<br>
thereof. Such license 16 also includes the decryption key (KD) for decrypting the<br>
digital content, perhaps encrypted according to a key decryptable by the user's<br>
computing device.<br>
The content owner for a piece of digital content 12 must trust that the<br>
user's computing device 14 will abide by the rules and requirements specified by<br>
such content owner in the license 16, i.e. that the digital content 12 wifl not be<br>
rendered unless the rules and requirements within the license 16 are satisfied.<br>
Preferably, then, the user's computing device 14 is provided with a trusted<br>
component or mechanism 18 that will not render the digital content 12 except<br>
according to the license rules embodied in the Iicense16 associated with the<br>
digital content 12 and obtained by the user.<br>
The trusted component 18 typicaily has a license evaluator 20 that<br>
determines whetherthe license 16 is valid, reviews the license rules and<br>
requirements in such valid license 16, and determines based on the reviewed<br>
license rules and requirements whether the requesting user has the right to render<br>
the requested digital content 12 in the manner sought, among other things. As<br>
should be understood, the license evaluator 20 is trusted in the DRM system 10 to<br>
carry out the wishes of the owner of the digital content 12 according to the ruies<br>
and requirements in the license 16, and the user should not be able to easily alter<br>
such trusted element for any purpose, nefarious or otherwise.<br>
As should be understood, the rules and requirements in the license<br>
16 can specify whether the user has rights to render the digital content 12 based<br>
on any of several factors, including who the user is, where the user is located,<br><br>
-18-<br>
what type of computing device the user is using, what rendering app√ºcation is<br>
calling the DRM system, the date, the time, etc. In addition, the rules and<br>
requirements of the license 16 may limit the license 16 to a pre-determined<br>
number of plays, or pre-determined play time, for example.<br>
The rules and requirements may be specified in the license 16<br>
according to any appropriate language and syntax. For example, the language<br>
may simpty specify attributes and values that must be satisfied (DATE must be<br>
later than X, e.g.), or may require the performance of functions according to a<br>
specified script (IF DATE greater than X, THEN DO . .. , e.g.).<br>
Upon the license evaluator20 determining that the license 16 is valid<br>
and that the user satisfies the rules and requirements therein, the digital content<br>
12 can then be rendered. In particular, to render the content 12, the decryption<br>
key (KD) is obtained from the license 12 and is applied to (KD(CONTENT)) from<br>
the content package 13 to result in the actual content 12, and the actual content<br>
12 is then in fact rendered.<br>
Publishing Digital Content<br>
Fig. 3 is a functional block diagram of a system and method for<br>
publishing digital content. "Publishing," as that term is used herein, refers to a<br>
process that an application or service folIows to establish with a trusted entity a<br>
set of rights and conditions that the entity can issue for that content, as well as to<br>
whom those rights and conditions can be issued. According to the invention, the<br>
publishing process includes encrypting the digital content and associating a list of<br>
persistent enforceable rights that the author of the content intended for all possible<br>
users of the content. This process can be carried out in a secure way to prohibit<br>
access to any of the rights or to the content unless intended by the author of the<br>
content.<br>
Three entities in particular are employed to publish secure digital<br>
content: a content preparation application 302 that executes on the cli√´nt 300 and<br>
prepares the content for publish/ng, a digital rights management (DRM)<br>
applications program interface (API) 306 that also resides on the cli√´nt device<br><br>
-19-<br>
300, and a DRM server 320 that is communicativeiy coupled to the cli√´nt 300 via a<br>
communication network 330 such as the Internet, a local orwide area network, or<br>
a combination thereof.<br>
The content preparation application 302 can be any application that<br>
produces digital content. For example, the application 302 can be a word<br>
processor or other publisher that produces digital text files, digital music, video, or<br>
other such content. The content could also include streamed content, such as<br>
streamed audio/video of a iive or taped event, or example. The application 302 is<br>
provided with a cryptographic key to encrypt the digital content, thus forming an<br>
encrypted digital content file 304, and the user provides rights data to be tightly<br>
associated with the encrypted content in the digital content file 304. The rights<br>
data includes an identity for each entity that has rights in the digital content, and a<br>
set of rights and conditions for each identified entity.<br>
Such an entity can be, for example, an individual, a class of<br>
individuals, or a device. Such rights can include the right to read, edit, copy, print,<br>
etc, the digital content. Conditions may include minimum system requirements,<br>
date and time limitations, play counts, and the like.<br>
The cli√´nt API 306 passes the encrypted digital content and the<br>
rights data to the DRM server 320. Using a process that is described in detail<br>
below, the DRM server 320 determines whether it can enforce the rights data and<br>
if so the DRM server 320 signs the rights data to form a signed rights label (SRL)<br>
308. In general, however, any trusted entity can sign the rights data, preferably<br>
using a key trusted by the DRM server 320. For example, a cli√´nt can sign the<br>
righfs data using a key provided to it by the DRM server 320.<br>
The rights label 308 can include data representing the rights<br>
description, the encrypted content key, and the digital signature over the rights<br>
description and the encrypted content key. If the DRM server 320 is signing the<br>
right label, it passes the signed rights label 308 back to the cli√´nt through the<br>
cli√´nt API 306, which stores the signed rights label 308 on the cli√´nt device 300.<br>
The content preparation application 302 then associates the signed rights label<br>
308 with the encrypted digital content file 304, such as for.example by<br>
concatenation to form a 'rights managed content file 310. Note, though, that the<br><br>
-20-<br>
SRL 308 could be stored in a known iocation separate from the content file 304<br>
with a reference to the SRL 308 concatenated to the content file 304 to form the<br>
content file 310.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 4, one method for publishing rights managed<br>
digital content is shown. At step 402, the application 302 generates a content key<br>
(CK) that is used to encrypt the digital content. The content key (CK) is typically a<br>
symmetrie key although any key can be used to encrypt the digital content. As is<br>
known, a symmetrie key is employed by a symmetrie key algorithm both to encrypt<br>
and decrypt. Accordingly, (CK) should be well-hidden when shared between a<br>
sender and a receiver.<br>
At step 404, the application 302 encrypts the digital content with<br>
(CK) to form encrypted digital content 304 (i.e., (CK(content))). Additionally, rights<br>
data corresponding to (CK(content)) is generated, either by the publisher of the<br>
content or by another entity. Note that such rights data may be custom rights data<br>
or rights data as obtained from a pre-defined template. As was discussed above,<br>
the rights data can include a list of entities that will be entitled to consume the<br>
content, the specific rights that each of the entities possesses with respect to the<br>
content, and any conditions that may be imposed on those rights.<br>
At step 406, the API 306 generates a second encryption key (DES1),<br>
which is used to encrypt the content key (CK). Preferably, (DES1) is also a<br>
symmetrie key. At step 408, the API 306 encrypts (CK) with (DES1) to result in<br>
(DES1 (CK)). At step 410, the API 306 discards (CK), with the result being that<br>
(CK) can now be obtained only by decrypting (DES1(CK)). To ensure that<br>
(CK(content)) is protected to a central DRM server 320 and that all "license<br>
requests" for the content are done centrally in accordance with the rights data, the<br>
API 306T at step 412, contacts the provided DRM server 320 and retrieves the<br>
public key (PU-DRM) thereof. At step 414, the API 306 encrypts (DES1) with (PU-<br>
DRM) to result in (PU-DRM (DES1)). Thus, (CK) can be protected to (PU-DRM))<br>
to ensure that the DRM server 320 is the only entity that will be able to get access<br>
to (CK), as is required to decrypt (CK(content)). At step 416, the API 306 encrypts<br>
the rights data (i.e., the list of authorized entities and the respective rights and<br><br>
-21 -<br>
conditions associated with each authorized entities in the Hst) with (DES1) to result<br>
in (DESI(rightsdata)).<br>
In an atternative embodiment, (CK) can be used to directly encrypt<br>
the rights data to result in (CK(rightsdata)), and (PU-DRM) can be used to directly<br>
encrypt (CK) to result in (PU-DRM(CK)), thereby foregoing the use of (DES1)<br>
completely. However, using (DES1) to encrypt the rights data and (CK) allows<br>
such (DES1) to conform to any particular algorithm that might be amenable to the<br>
DRM server, whereas (CK) might be specified by an entity independent from the<br>
DRM server and might not be as amenable thereto.<br>
At step 418, the content protection application 302 submits (PU-<br>
DRM(DES1)) and (DES1(rightsdata)) to the DRM server 320 as a rights label for<br>
signing, Alternatively, the cli√´nt itself can sign the rights data in the manner set<br>
forth below. If the rights data is being submitted to the server for signing, then, at<br>
step 420, the DRM server 320 accesses the rights data and verifies that it can<br>
enforce the rights and conditions in the submitted rights label. To verify that it can<br>
enforce the rights data, the DRM server 320 applies the private key (PR-DRM)<br>
corresponding to (PU-DRM) to (PU-DRM(DESI)) to result in (DES1), and then<br>
applies (DES1) to (DESI(rightsdata)) to result in the rights data in the clear. The<br>
server 320 can then do any policy checks to verify that the users, rights, and<br>
conditions specified in the rights data are within any policy enforced by the server<br>
320. The server 320 signs the originally submitted rights label including (PU-<br>
DRM(DES1)) and (DESI(rightsdata)) to result in the signed rights label (SRL) 308,<br>
where the signature is based on the private key of the DRM server 320 (PR-<br>
DRM), and returns the SRL 308 back to the API 306. which then presents the<br>
returned SRL 308 to the cli√´nt application 302.<br>
The SRL 308 is a digitally signed document, which makes it tamper-<br>
resistant. Additionaljy, the SRL 308 is independent of the actual key type and<br>
algorithm used to encrypt the content but maintains the strong 1-1 relation to the<br>
content it is protecting. Referring now to Fig. 4A, in one embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the SRL 308 may include information on the content that is the<br>
basis of the SRL 308, including perhaps an ID of the content; information on the<br>
DRM server that signs the SRL 308, including (PU-DRM(DESI)) and referral<br><br>
-22-<br>
information such as a URL for locating the DRM server on a network and fall-back<br>
information if the URL fails; information describing the SRL 308 itself;<br>
(DES1(rightsdata)): (DES1(CK)); and a digital signature (S (PR-DRM)}, among<br>
otherthings.<br>
By ensuring that a trusted entity signs the rights data to create a<br>
signed rights label 308, the DRM server 320 is asserting that it will issue licenses<br>
for the content in accordance with the terms set forth by the publisher as<br>
described in the rights data of the rights label 308. As should be appreciated, a<br>
user is required to obtain a license to renderthe content, especially inasmuch as<br>
the license contains the content key (CK). When a user wants to obtain a license<br>
for the encrypted content, the user can present a license request including the<br>
SRL 308 for the content and a certificate verifying the user's credentials to the<br>
DRM server 320 or other license issuing entity. The license issuing entity can<br>
then decrypt (PU-DRM(DESI)) and (DESI(rightsdata)) to produce the rights data,<br>
list all the rights granted by the author (if any) to the license requesting entity, and<br>
construct a license with only those specific rights.<br>
As set forth above, upon the application 302 receiving the SRL 308,<br>
such application 302 concatenates the signed rights label 308 with the<br>
corresponding (CK(content)) 304 to form rights managed digital content.<br>
AJlernatively, the rights data is stored in a known location, with a reference to that<br>
location provided with the encrypted digital content. Thus, a rendering appiication<br>
that is DRM-enabled can discover the signed rights label 308 via the piece of<br>
content the rendering application is attempting to render. This discovery triggers<br>
the rendering application to initiate a license request against the DRM licensing<br>
server 320. Publishing application 302 can store a URL to the DRM licensing<br>
server 320, for example, or the DRM licensing server 320 can embed its own URL<br>
as a piece of metadata into the rights label before digitally signing it, so that the<br>
DRM cli√´nt API 306 called by the rendering application can identify the correct<br>
DRM licensing server 320.<br><br>
-23-<br>
Obtaining a License for the Pubiished Content<br>
Referring now to Fig. 5, a system and method for licensing rights<br>
managed digital content is shown. "Licensing," as that term is used herein, refers<br>
to a process that an appfication or service follows to request and receive a license<br>
that wiil enable an entity named in the √ºcense to consume the content in<br>
accordance with the terms specified in the license. Inputs to the licensing process<br>
can include the signed rights label (SRL) 308 associated with the content for<br>
which a license is being requested, and the public key certiflcate(s) of the entity(s)<br>
for which the license is being requested. Note that the entity requesting a license<br>
need not necessarily be the entity for which the Jicense is being requested.<br>
Typically, a license includes the rights description from the SRL 308, an encrypted<br>
key that can decrypt the encrypted content, and a digital signature over the rights<br>
description and the encrypted key to assert legitimacy and prevent tampering.<br>
Preliminarily, the cli√´nt AP1 306 forwards the signed rights label 308<br>
of the rights managed content 310 to the DRM server 320 via the communication<br>
network 330. As described above, the rights fabel 308 contains the content key<br>
(CK) encrypted according to the public key of the DRM server 320 (PU-DRM)<br>
(.e., (PU-DRM(CK))). In the process of issuing a license, then, the DRM server<br>
320 applies (PR-DRM) to (PU-DRM(CK)) to obtain (CK). It then uses the public<br>
key (PU-ENTITY) in the public key certificate that is passed up in the license<br>
request to re-encrypt (CK) (i.e., (PU-ENTITY(CK))). The newly encrypted (PU-<br>
ENTITY(CK)) is then placed into the license. Thus, the license can be returned to<br>
the caller without risk of exposing (CK), since only the holder of the private key<br>
(PR^ENTITY) corresponding to (PU-ENTITY) can recover (CK) from (PU-<br>
ENTITY(CK)). The cli√´nt APl 306 then uses (CK) to decrypt the encrypted content<br>
to form decrypted digital content 312. The cli√´nt application 302 can then use the<br>
decrypted digital content 312 according to the rights that are provided in the<br>
license.<br>
Alternatively, and as set forth below in more detail, a cli√´nt such as<br>
the publishing cli√´nt can for example issue a use license to itself to consume the<br>
content.<br><br>
-24-<br>
Turning now to Figs. 6A and 6B, a method for licensing rights<br>
managed digital content is shown. At step 602, a √ºcense issuing entity such as a<br>
DRM server 320 receives a license request including either a public key certificate<br>
or an identity for each of one or more requested licensees. Presumably, if am<br>
identity is specified, the DRM server 320 can procure a corresponding public key<br>
certificate from a directory, a database, or the like. If a √ºcense is requested for<br>
only one licensee, only one certificate or identity is named. If a license is<br>
requested for a plurality of licensees, a certificate or an identity can be named for<br>
each potential licensee. At step 604, the requesting entity (i.e., the entity making<br>
the √ºcense request) is authenticated, if desired. At step 606, it is determined<br>
whether the entity is allowed to request a license, again if desired.<br>
If, at step 608, the issuing entity determines that the public key<br>
certificate is not included in the license request, then the issuing entity uses the<br>
specified identity to perform a lookup in a directory service or database for the<br>
appropriate public key certificate. If, at step 610, the issuing entity determines that<br>
the certificate is in the directory, then, at step 612, the certificate is retrieved. If a<br>
certificate cannot be found for a given potential licensee, either in the request or in<br>
the directory, then the license server does not generate a (icense for that potential<br>
licensee and, at step 614, an error is returned to the requesting entity.<br>
Assuming the DRM server 320 has a public key certificate for at<br>
least one potential licensee, then, at step 616, such DRM server 320 validates the<br>
trust of each licensee certificate. If not validated, the DRM server 320 determines<br>
that the issuer of the licensee certificate is not in the list of trusted issuers, then<br>
the request fails for that licensee, and an error is generated at step 614. Thus,<br>
any potential licensee whose certificate is not issued by a trusted issuer would not<br>
receive a license.<br>
Additionally, the DRM server 320 preferably performs digital<br>
signature validation on all entities in the certificate chain going from the trusted<br>
issuer certificates to the individual licensee public key certificates. The process of<br>
validating the digital signatures in a chain is a well-known algorithm. If the public<br>
key certificate for a given potential licensee does not validate, or a certificate in the<br>
chain does not validate, the potential Jicensee is not trusted, and a license,<br><br>
-25-<br>
therefore, is not issued to that potential licensee. Otherwise, at step 618, a<br>
license can issue. The process repeats at step 620 until all entities forwhich a<br>
license has been requested have been processed.<br>
As shown in Fig. 6B, the DRM server 320 proceeds to validate the<br>
signed rights label 308 that is received in the license request. In one embodiment,<br>
the DRM server 320 has a masten copy of every rights label signed thereby. At<br>
license time (at step 622), then, the DRM server 320 may retrieve a copy of the<br>
master rights label. The master rights label could be more up to date than the<br>
copy of the rights label sent in the license request, and therefore will be the rights<br>
label employed to produce the requested license. If no master rights label is<br>
found the DRM server 320, at step 624, determine according to pre-defined policy<br>
whether to issue a license based on the rights label in the request. If the policy<br>
does not allow, the license request fails at step 626, and an error is retumed to the<br>
APl 306 at step 628.<br>
At step 630, the DRM server 320 validates the SRL 308 and<br>
specifica√ºy the digital signature thereof. If the SRL 308 does not validate, the<br>
license request fails at step 626, and an error is returned to the APl 306 at step<br>
628.<br>
After all the validations have occurred, the DRM server constructs a<br>
license for each approved iicense based on the SRL 308. At step 632, the DRM<br>
server 320 generales a respective rights description for the license to be issued to<br>
each licensee. For each licensee, the DRM server 320 evaluates the identity<br>
named in the public key certificate of that licensee against the identities named in<br>
the rights description in the rights label. At step 636, the DRM server 320 obtains<br>
(PU-DRM(DESI)) and (DES1(CK)) from the SRL 308 and applies (PR-DRM) to<br>
obtain (CK). The issuing entity then re-encrypts (CK) using (PU-ENTITY) from the<br>
licensee's public key certificate to result in (PU-ENTITY(CK)). At step 638, the<br>
DRM server 320 concatenates the generated rights description with (PU-<br>
ENTITY(CK)) and digitally signs the resulting data structure using (PR-DRM) (i.e.r<br>
S (PR-DRM)). The signed data structure is thus the license for this particular<br>
licensee.<br><br>
-26-<br>
At step 640, the DRM server 320 determines that there are no more<br>
licenses to generate for the particular request. The generaled licenses are then<br>
returned to the requesting entity, at step 642, aiong with an appropriate certificate<br>
chain that ties the licenses back to a trusted authority.<br>
Licensing by way of a Directory<br>
When issuing a license for protected content, the license issuing<br>
entity (hereinafter 'licensor') consults the sent SRL 308 from the content to<br>
determine which users / groups / clusters / divisions / platforms / etc. (hereinafter<br>
'entities') are to be provided with rights, and the sent certificate to identify the<br>
license requestor. Based thereon, the licensor determines which rights of those<br>
listed in the SRL 308 are to be issued to the requestor. Conceptually. the licensor<br>
inspects the entities listed in the SRL 308 and compares such entities with the<br>
requestor.   Thus, if the SRL 308 specifies that a particular group is to receive a<br>
license and the requestor is a member of such group, the requestor is granted a,<br>
license with rights as set forth for the group in the SRL 308. Likewise, if the SRL<br>
308 specifies that a particular user is to receive a license and the requestor is<br>
such user, the requestor is granted a license with rights as set forth for such ussr<br>
in the SRL 308. As may be appreciated, a particular SRL 308 may list several<br>
entities and rights therefor, and a particular requestor may be granted a license<br>
based on being a member of one or more entities.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, and as seen in Fig. 7,<br>
the requestor is identified in the sent certificate 1202 by way of an identifier 1204,<br>
where the identifier 1204 may for example be an alias through which the requestor<br>
is identified in an organizational directory 1206. Correspondingly, the SRL 308<br>
lists therein each rights-entitled entity therein according to such an identifier 1204.<br>
Thus, and as part of processing a request for a license 1208, a licensor 1210,<br>
which is typically a DRM server 320, obtains the identifier 1204 of the requestor<br>
from the certificate 1202 and compares the obtained identifier 1204 to all<br>
identifiers 1204 as iisted in the sent SRL 308. If a match is found; the licensor<br><br>
-27-.<br>
1210 issues a license 1208 tothe requestor with the rights specified in the SRL<br>
308 forthe identifier 1204 of such requestor.<br>
Moreover, with the availability of the directory 1206, the licensor<br>
1210 may also determine whether the requestor is a memberof any other entity<br>
listed in the SRL 308, presuming thatthe directory 1206 contains appropriate<br>
cross-referencing information that would refiect the requestor's membership status<br>
in each such other entity. Typically, a directory 1206 lists for each requestor not<br>
only the identifier 1204 thereof but also the identifier 1208 of each group / cluster /<br>
division / platform / other entity / etc. that the requestor is a member of. Note that<br>
the directory 1206 may include identifiers 1208 such as a mail address, an<br>
alternate mail address, an ID, an alternate ID, a group membership, a historie<br>
identifier, and/or the like.<br>
With the certificate 1202 received from the requestor with the<br>
identifier 1204 thereof therein and with the rights data from the SRL 308 received<br>
from the requestor, then, and generally speaking, the licensor 1210 issues a<br>
license 1208 to the requestor if, among other things, it can be determined from the<br>
directory 1206 that the requestor is a member of any entity listed in the SRL 308.<br>
If so, and assuming all other conditions for licensing are satisfied. the licensor<br>
1210 issues the license 1208 tothe requestor with the rights and conditions<br>
specified for the listed entity as obtained from the SRL 308.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, an entity listed in the<br>
SRL 308 represents a group or cluster or some other collection of individuals<br>
(hereinafter 'group') where such group is appropriately represented within the<br>
directory 1206. Such group could include a mail-enabled group such as a<br>
distribution list or a mail alias, or a security group such as may defined in<br>
connection with a network operating system, or the like.<br>
Notably, specifying rights in an SRL 308 according to a group and<br>
issuing a license 1208 to a requestor according to group membership thereof<br>
effectuates digital rights management in an enterprise ororganizational setting.<br>
For example, a document or email could be DRM-protected so that all members of<br>
a given department have rights to read the document or email. Assuming that a .<br>
group (e.g. email alias) for such a department exists in the directory 1206 of the<br><br>
-28-<br>
organization, which is most often the case, the author of the document or email<br>
would grant rights based on the group ratherthan individuals. As may be<br>
appreciated, advantages to such group-wise rights granting include ease of use<br>
for the author in specifying classes of individuals that have rights. In addition, by<br>
specifying rights according to a group, the specified rights do not become 'stale' as<br>
new individuals join the group and old individuals leave the group. Instead, all<br>
current members of the group are capable of exercising the rights as long as the<br>
membership of such group is kept up to date in the organizational directory 1206.<br>
Determining Whether a Requestor is a Member of a Group<br>
Typically, the directory 1206 is a repository of useful information that<br>
is of interest to the organization or a portion thereof. In particular, the directory<br>
1206 holds several important pieces of information about each user in the<br>
organization, including every group that the user holds membership in. In fact,<br>
such memberships for a user may be defmed at least in part by being listed in the<br>
directory 1206 according to the user.<br>
Note that in the situation where the organization is especially large<br>
or otherwise so requires, computing therein may divided in some logical fashion<br>
into a piurality of divisions or 'forests'. Each forest may for example be<br>
geographically based, such as for example if the organization has one office in<br>
Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania and another office in Boynton Beach, Florida, in which<br>
case each such office is provisioned with a separate forest. Altemately, each<br>
forest may for example be functionally based, such as for example if the<br>
organization has an accounting department and a production department, in which<br>
case each such department is provisioned with a separate forest. Of course,<br>
forests may be defined according to any other criteria without departing from the<br>
spirit and scope of the present invention.<br>
Significantly, it is presumed to be the case that each forest has its<br>
own directory 1206 or group of directories 1206 (hereinafter'directory 1206'), and<br>
each forest has at least one DRM server 320. Referring now to Fig. 8, two forests,<br>
forest A and forest B, are shown for an organization, where forest A has a<br><br>
-29-<br>
directory A and a DRM server A, and where forest B has a directory B and a DRM<br>
server B. As is to be appreciated, each forest acts as a protective enclave within<br>
which the corresponding directory and DRM server is deployed. Thus, DRM<br>
server A within forest A should be abfe to access information within directory A<br>
with relative ease, at least trom a security point of view, while DRM server B within<br>
forest B is nearly as able to access information within directory A within forest A<br>
with such relative ease, again at least from a security point of view. Note, though,<br>
that multiple forests that have a need to inter-operate typically replicate<br>
information therebetween and optionally can set up explicit trust relationships<br>
therebetween.<br>
Group Membership Determination Within a Forest<br>
Assuming for the moment that the totality of the organization is<br>
represented by forest A of Fig. 8 and that forest B of Fig. 8 does not exist, it is to<br>
be appreciated that directory A of forest A maintains all directory information<br>
refevant to the organization, including all users and all groups that the users<br>
belong to. Note, here, that such groups may actually comprise multiple layers of<br>
groups. Thus, and as seen in Fig. 9, it may be the case that a group 1 has as<br>
direct members a group 2 and a group 3, and group 3 may have as direct<br>
members a user 1. In such art instance, user 1 is a direct memoer of group 3, an<br>
indirect member of group 1, and not a member of gro√ºp 2. As may be appreciated<br>
then, if an SRL 308 lists rights for members of groups 1 or 3, user 1 may obtain a<br>
license 1208 based on such rights, assuming all other conditions are met, while if<br>
the SRL 308 lists rights for members of group 2 only, user 1 may not obtain such a<br>
license 1208. Put more generally, a user that is a direct or indirect member of a<br>
group named in an SRL 308 can obtain a license 1208 with whatever rights and<br>
conditions are granted to such group.<br>
As seen in Fig. 10, the record objects / records in the directory A for<br>
each of groups 1 through 3 and user 1 are shown. Note that, as is typical, each<br>
record is in the form of a listing for the respective entity that includes both all direct<br>
members of the entity, assuming the entity is a group, and all direct memberships<br><br>
-30-<br>
-30-<br><br><br>
that the entity possesses, whether the entity is a user or a sub-group of another<br>
group. Thus, group 1 has groups 2 and 3 as direct members and is not a direct<br>
member of any other group, group 2 has no members and is a direct member of<br>
group 1, group 3 has user 1 as a direct member and is a direct member of group<br>
1, and user 1 as a user has no members but is a direct member of group 3. Of<br>
course, directory A as shown in Figs. 9 and 10 is grossly over-simplified and<br>
therefore would in reality very likely be much larger with many more users and<br>
groups. Nevertheless, such directory A as shown is suitable for purposes of<br>
describing the present invention.<br>
In the course of user 1 submitting an SRL 308 to DRM server A,<br>
where the submitted SRL 308 lists one or more groups and rights therefor, then,<br>
the DRM server A decides whether to issue a license 1208 to user 1 at least in<br>
part by referring to directory A to determine whether user 1 is a direct or indirect<br>
member of any of the groups listed in the SRL 308. As may be appreciated, such<br>
a determination may be performed in one of two general manners -from the listed<br>
groups to the user, or from th√© user to the listed groups.<br>
Performing the determination from the groups to the user is a more<br>
straight-forward process, typically, but since groups can have many members, it is<br>
likely that a relatively large amount of time must be spent examining all found<br>
users to determine whether a match exists. Performing the determination from the<br>
user to the groups is a less straight-forward process, typicalJy, but since a user<br>
usually is not a member of too many groups, it is likely that a relatively small<br>
amount of time must be spent examining all found groups to determine whether a<br>
match exists. In any case, it has been found at least empiricaliy that performing<br>
the determination from the user to the groups is more economical and desirable<br>
overall.<br>
Still referring to Figs. 9 and 10, and also now referring to Fig. 12, to<br>
make a group membership determination with regard to whether user 1 is a<br>
member of group 1, then, the DRM server A proceeds as follows. Preliminarily,<br>
the DRM server A asks directory A whether group 1 exists (step 1201). As may<br>
be appreciated, if the response to such an inquiry shows that group 1 does not<br>
exist, then the process is done inasmuch as userl cannot be a member of a group<br><br>
-31-<br>
that does not exist (step 1203). Thus, despite the fact that the determination is<br>
performed from the user to the group, the preliminary step of asking whether the<br>
group exists is performed to avoid performing any additional steps if unnecessary.<br>
Of course, as shown, group 1 does Indeed exist, so the response<br>
would in actuality be yes. Thus, the DRM server A asks directory A for all groups<br>
that user 1 is a member of and directory A returns with the Information that user 1<br>
is a member of group 3 (steps 1205, 1207). Of course, group 3 is not group 1, so<br>
the DRM server A has not as yet determined whether user 1 is a member of group<br>
1 (step 1209). Nevertheless, the DRM server A must continue if it is the case that<br>
user 1 might later be found to be an indirect member of group 1 by way of being a<br>
direct member of group 3 and group 3 being a direct or indirect member of group<br>
1.<br>
The DRM server A thus continues by asking directory A for all<br>
groups that group 3 is a member of and directory A returns with the Information<br>
that group 3 is a member of group 1 (steps 1211, 1213). As a result, DRM server<br>
A has determined that user 1 is In fact an indirect member of group 1 by way of<br>
being a member of group 3 (step 1215).<br>
As should now be appreciated, the DRM server A may have to<br>
recursively query through many more groups and many more iterations to fmaily<br>
determine that user 1 is in fact a member of group 1. AJtematively, if it were the<br>
case that user 1 was not in fact a member of group 1, the DRM server A would<br>
have to query through the entirety of all possible group membership for user 1,<br>
direct and indirect, before finally determining that user 1 is not a member of group<br>
1. As will be described in more detail below, because such querying can be<br>
expensive and may be performed on a continuing basis, the results of such<br>
exploration may be stored in one or more caches.<br>
Group Membership Determination Across Forests<br>
When an organization has multiple forests deployed and the user<br>
and group membership information needs to be avaiiable across forest<br>
boundaries, there is no straightforward way to determine group membership of a<br><br>
-32-<br>
user with regard to a particular group, especially when the querying DRM server<br>
320 is in a forest that does not natively hold the required information in the<br>
directory thereof. Instead, the DRM server 320 must consult another forest where<br>
such information is indeed natively held.<br>
In particular, of special interest is the situation where a DRM server<br>
320 such as DRM server A of Fig. 8 is asked to issue a license to a user based on<br>
an SRL 308 that lists a group, where the group is not native to forest A within<br>
which DRM server A resides. Instead, such group is native to forest B and<br>
therefore has a record in directory B of forest B. As a result, a group membership<br>
determination with regard to whether the user at issue is a member of the group at<br>
issue must be made with respect to directory B of forest B inasmuch as such<br>
directory B has the record for the group at issue with the group information for<br>
such group.<br>
However, and significantly, DRM server A of forest A typically cannot<br>
directly query directory B of forest B to obtain substantive directory information<br>
since such cross-forest querying is usually limited or prevented out of security<br>
concerns. Instead, and in one embodiment of the present invention, DRM server<br>
A asks DRM server B of forest B to query directory B of forest B and to report<br>
back to DRM server A with the results of the query. Note that the DRM server B<br>
to directory B query is not a cross-forest query and therefore does not suffer the<br>
limitations thereof.<br>
It must be appreciated, though, that the DRM server A prior to<br>
asking DRM server B to perform the query must actually know that DRM server B<br>
is in fact the proper DRM server 320 to perform the query inasmuch as the group<br>
at issue is native to forest B. Put more simply, DRM server A must know that the<br>
group at issue is native to forest B prior to asking DRM server B to query directory<br>
B. However, DRM server A can only query directory A and therefore would not<br>
know of the native forest of the group at issue unless such directory A has such<br>
information.<br>
Accordingly, and in one embodiment of the present invention,<br>
directory A indeed does have such information, as is seen in Fig. 8.. In-particular,<br>
directory A has a pointer object for the group at issue that directs any querying<br><br>
-33-<br>
entity with regard to the group at issue to forest B. Such pointer object may for<br>
example include an address of forest B that is returned to querying DRM server A<br>
upon such DRM server A requesting information about the group at issue.<br>
Presumably, directory B of forest B has a record object for the group at issue.<br>
Thus, DRM server A may employ such address to find forest B and proceed from<br>
there.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the address of forest B<br>
is in particular the address of directory B within forest B. Such DRM server A with<br>
such address then contacts such directory B based thereon. However, since<br>
DRM server A is in forest A and directory B is in forest B, and as was alluded to<br>
above, directory B does not normally provide any substantive information across<br>
forests to DRM server A. Nevertheless, directory B can provide to DRM server A<br>
the address of DRM server B.<br>
Accordingly, and in one embodiment of the present invention, DRM<br>
server A receives the address of DRM server B from directory B, and based<br><br>
thereon asks DRM server B to query directory B on behalf of DRM server A. In<br>
particular, DRM server A requests DRM server B to query directory B whether the<br>
user at issue is a memoer of the group at issue, and to return the answer to DRM<br>
server A. Presumably, such request includes some sort of identification of DRM<br>
server A as a DRM server 320 within the DRM universe, such as for example an<br>
identifying certificate with a certificate chain leading back to a trusted root of<br>
authority as recognized by DRM server B. Accordingly, DRM server B executes<br>
the query of directory B on behalf of DRM server A only if the identifying certificate<br>
verifies.<br>
Presuming DRM server B indeed executes the query of directory B<br>
on behalf of DRM server A, such as in the manner set forth above with regard to<br>
Fig. 12, DRM server B eventually determines whether the user at issue is a<br>
member of the group at issue and returns such information to DRM server A as<br>
the response to the request therefrom.<br>
Note that when DRM server B asks directory B if the user at issue is<br>
a member of the group at issue, such user at issue must be represented within<br>
directory B, at least by a pointer object if not by a record object. Moreover, such<br><br>
-34-<br>
pointer object must include information regarding each group that the user at issue<br>
is a memberof, especially inasmuch as such member-of information is referenced<br>
when the group membership information is determined from the user to the group,<br>
as was described above.<br>
Turning now to Fig. 13, and to recap, DRM server A and DRM server<br>
B on behaif of DRM server A perform the following steps to determine group<br>
membership across forests;<br>
Preliminarily, DRM server A receives a request from a user for a use<br>
license 1208 corresponding to a piece of content (step 1301). The request<br>
includes a certificate identifying the user and the SRL 308 associated with the<br>
content. In response, and assuming the SRL 308 identiftes a group therewithin,<br>
and aiso assuming appropriate cached information is not present, DRM server A<br>
queries directory A to return any object for the identified group (step 1303). The<br>
present scenario assumes that the group is native to forest B so such group is in<br>
fact represented within directory A as a pointer object pointing to forest B, and<br>
DRM server A receives the pointer object pointing to forest B from directory A,<br>
thus signifying that the group is native to forest B (step 1304), and retrieves the<br>
address of forest B from the received pointer object (step 1305).<br>
Thereafter, DRM server A empioys the retrieved address to query<br>
directory B in forest B for the address of DRM server B and directory B returns<br>
such address to DRM server A in response thereto (steps 1307, 1309). The<br>
particular mechanism of getting the address of DRM server B is known or should<br>
be apparent to the relevant public and therefore need not be discussed herein in<br>
any detail. Thus, any appropriate mechanism may be employed without departing<br>
from the spirit and scope of the present invention.<br>
With the address of DRM server B, DRM server A then requests<br>
DRM server B to query directory B whether the user is a member of the group<br>
(step 1311). Again, the particular mechanism employed by DRM server A to<br>
deliver the request to DRM server B is known or should be apparent to the<br>
relevant public and therefore need not be discussed herein in any detail. Thus,<br>
any appropriate mechanism may be employed without departing from the spirit<br>
and scope of the present invention.<br><br>
-35-<br>
As with DRM server A, and again assuming appropriate cached<br>
Information is not present, DRM server B queries directory B to return any object<br>
for the identified group (step 1313). The present scenario assumes that the group<br>
is native to forest B so such group is in fact represented within directory B as a<br>
record object, and DRM server B receives the record object from directory B, thus<br>
signifying that the group is native to forest B (step 1315). Note that DRM server B<br>
may at this point review the members of the group as set forth in the received<br>
object to determine whether the user is a direct member of the group (step 1317).<br>
If so, the determination is positive and DRM server B reports same to DRM server<br>
A (step 1319). If not, DRM server B queries directory B to return any object for the<br>
user and thus proceeds to determine whether the user is a member of the group<br>
by attempting to traverse within directory B from the user to the group in a manner<br>
akin to that shown in connection with Fig. 12 (step 1323). Upon finishing the<br>
attempted traversal, DRM server B will have determined whether a member<br>
relationship exists between the user and the group, and reports same to DRM<br>
server A (step 1325).<br>
Of course, based on such determination, DRM server A decides<br>
whether to honor the request from the user as received at step 1301 (step 1327).<br>
As may be appreciated, if the user is not a member of the group, the request is<br>
denied, unless of course it is found that the user is a member of another group<br>
identified in the received SRL 308. Likewise, if the user is a member of the group,<br>
the request is honored, presuming that all other conditions for so honoring are<br>
met.<br>
Determining User Group Membership By Way of Cached Information<br>
As thus far described above, a DRM server 320 in the course of<br>
issuing a license 1208 to a user based on an SRL 308 can determine whether the<br>
user is a member of a group identified in the SRL 308 by referring to a directory<br>
1206 within the forest of the DRM server 320 or in another forest. As may be<br>
appreciated, though, referring to a directory 1206 each time a determination is to<br>
be made can become relatively expensive and cumbersome, especially in terms<br><br>
-36-<br>
of the additional network traffic and the work necessary to be performed by the<br>
directory 1206, and especially if the numberof determinations made becomes<br>
reiatively high.<br>
Accordingly, and in one embodimentof the present invention, user-<br>
group information as derived from one or more directories 1206 is cached at one<br>
or more locations that are accessible to the DRM server 320. In addition, and in<br>
one embodiment of the present invention, the DRM server 320 when making a<br>
user-group determination employs a lowest-cost-first algorithm to review multiple<br>
cache locations in order of lowest cost to highest cost prior to referring to a<br>
directory 1206. Thus, higher cost operations are postponed for as long as<br>
possible, determination speed is increased, and network traffic is reduced.<br>
Caching User-Group Information<br>
In the course of determining from a directory 1206 whether a user is<br>
a member of a group, such as was disclosed in connection with Fig. 12, a DRM<br>
server 320 potentiafly locates at least some other groups that the user is a direct<br>
or in indirect member of. Note that inasmuch as the traversal stops once a<br>
membersnip path is in fact found, it is (ikely that not all groups of the user are<br>
found. For example, if in examining the record object for the group at issue it is<br>
found that the user is a direct member of such group, then no other groups that<br>
the user is a direct or indirect member of are found. Likewise, if it is necessary to<br>
traverse from the user to the group in an attempt to find a membership path<br>
therebetween, then at least the groups that the user is a direct member of are<br>
found, but some indirect groups may not be found because a membership path<br>
was found beforehand. Nevertheless, in one embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the DRM server 320 stores whatever knowledge it has of the user and<br>
all direct or indirect group membership thereof in one or more caches for future<br>
reference should that be necessary.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 14, multiple entries 1402 of a cache 1404 are<br>
seen. In particular, it is seen from one entry 1402 in the cache 1404 that for a<br>
user 3, it has been found that such user 3 is a member, eitherdirectly or indirectly,<br><br>
-37-<br>
of groups 4, 6, and 7, and that group 4 is a member of groups 6 and 7. Similarly,<br>
it is seen from anotherentry 1402 in the cache 1404 that fora user 4, it has been<br>
found that such user 4 is a member of group 8 only. Whether such users 3 and 4<br>
and group 4 are direct or indirect members of such groups is believed to be<br>
immaterial and accordingly is not delineated, although such information may so be<br>
delineated if found to be necessary or useful. What is material is that all group<br>
memberships for a user/group are cached as any particular user-group<br>
relationship may be useful at some later time to establish a user-group<br>
reJationship for the same or different user/group.<br>
As may be appreciated, information in the cache 1404 as obtained<br>
from the directory 1206 can become 'stale' after a period of time. That is, over<br>
time, users can become deleted from the directory 1206, additional groups and<br>
group memberships can be defined, and the like, and yet the cache 1404 is not<br>
automatically updated to reflect such changed information. Accordingfy, and as<br>
seen from Fig. 14, each entry 1402 of the cache 1404 includes a time of creation.<br>
Based on such creation time, then, any querying entity querying the cache 1404<br>
can decide whether the entry 1404 is too old to be relied upon. In addition or in<br>
the altemative, the cache 1404 may on its own delete each entry 1404 therein that<br>
is deemed too old based on the creation time thereof.<br>
Turning now to Figs. 15 and 16, it is seen that the cache 1404 of Fig.<br>
14 may be implemented in a number of configurations. In one configuration, each<br>
license-issuing DRM server 320 in a forest has a cache 1404 that is a relatively<br>
basic light-weight in-memory cache, and the forest also has a dedicated cache<br>
server 1502 (Fig. 15) with a cache 1404 that is a relatively extended heavier-<br>
weight in-memory cache. In addition, the dedicated cache server 1502 may<br>
employ a database cache 1404, and/or may perform queries on the directory 1206<br>
on behalf of the license-issuing DRM servers 320.<br>
In another configuration, each license-issuing DRM server 320 in a<br>
forest has a cache 1404 that is a relatively extended heavier-weight in-memory<br>
cache (Fig. 16), and performs queries on the directory 1206. No dedicated cache<br>
server 1502 is present, although a database cache 1404 may be shared among all<br>
license-issuing DRM servers 320 in the forest. In any configuration, each basic<br><br>
-38-<br>
cache 1404 has user information only, while each extended cache 1404 has user<br>
and group information.<br>
Lowest-Cost-First Algorithm<br>
Regardless of the configuration of the caches 1404, a DRM server<br>
320 seeking to determine whether a user is a member of a group employs the<br>
lowest-cost-first algorithm of the present invention to search the caches 1404 and<br>
the directory 1206 in the order of lowest-cost to highest cost. Presumptively, the<br>
cache 1404 associated with the DRM server 320 has the lowest cost associated<br>
therewith, the cache 1404 associated with a dedicated cache server 1502 and the<br>
database cache 1404 have a higher cost associated therewith, and the directory<br>
1206 has the highest cost associated therewith. Of course, cost can be subjective<br>
and at any rate a particular entity may have any particular cost without departing<br>
from the spirit and scope of the present invention.<br>
Turning nowto Figs. 17A and 17B, it is seen thatthe main<br>
characteristic of the algorithm is that an operation believed to have a higher cost is<br>
not attempted before all operations believed to have a lower cost have been<br>
exhausted. Generally, the operations in the order of increasing cost are !ook-up in<br>
the in-memory cache 1404 of the iicensing DRM server 320, look-up in the<br>
database cache 1404 orthe cache 1404 of the dedicated cache server 1502, and<br>
look-up in the AD. In performing the algorithm, a user and one or more target<br>
groups are submitted, and a determination is made of whether the user is a<br>
member, eitherdirectly or indirectly, of any of the target groups. Essentially, the<br>
algorithm traverses from the user to any of the target groups by way of all<br>
available membership information from the caches 1404 and the directory 1206,<br>
again always performing a tower-cost operation before performing a higher-cost<br>
operation. The algorithm returns as a result a "yes" if the user is a member of one<br>
of the target groups, a "no" if the user is not a member of any of the target groups,<br>
a "user not found" if the user is not in the directory 1206, and a "no target groups<br>
are found" if none of the target groups are found in the directory 1206.<br><br>
-39-<br>
As seen in Fig. 17A, the process begins by defining the user at issue<br>
and the target group or groups (step 1701). Assuming for the moment that the<br>
DRM server 320 has a locai cache 1404 and has access to a remote cache 1404<br>
(which may be the dedicated cache server 1502 orthe database cache 1404) and<br>
the directory 1206, the algorithm as employed by the license-issuing DRM server<br>
320 empfoys a number of bins and queues, including:<br>
‚Ä¢	a target bin (T) within which resides the target group or<br>
groups;<br>
‚Ä¢	a validated target bin (V) within which will reside the target<br>
group or groups that have been validated;<br>
‚Ä¢	a search bin (S) within which will reside the groups waiting to<br>
be searched;<br>
‚Ä¢	a focal queue (Q1) within which will reside the groups to be<br>
searched for in the local cache 1404;<br>
‚Ä¢	a remote queue (Q2) within which will reside the groups to be<br>
searched for in the remote cache 1404;<br>
‚Ä¢	a directory queue (Q3) within which will reside the groups to<br>
be searched for in the directory 1206; and<br>
‚Ä¢	a discard bin (D) within which will reside the groups already<br>
processed.<br>
Thus, the algorithm proceeds by validating the target group or<br>
groups, by, for each target group in the target bin, searching to find a record or<br>
entry 1402 for the target group. Since essentially the same process is performed<br>
with regard to each storage device (S1, corresponding to the focal cache 1404;<br>
S2, corresponding to the remote cache 1404; and S3, corresponding to the<br>
directory 1206), such process need only be described with reference to a generic<br>
storage Sx.<br>
In particular, the algorithm first looks at the S1, the locaf cache 1404,<br>
and for each target group in the target bin (T), if such target group is found as an<br>
entry 1402 in the local cache 1404, the target group is removed from (T), and the<br><br>
-40-<br>
target group is placed in the validated target bin (V) and the entry 1402 thereof is<br>
placed in any lower-level caches 1404, which in this instance do not exist (step<br>
1703). Thereafter, the algohthm repeats step 1703 with respect to S2, the remote<br>
cache 1404, and for each target group remaining in (T), if such target group is<br>
found as an entry 1402 in the remote cache 1404, the target group is removed<br>
from (T), and the.target group is placed in (V) and the entry 1402 thereof is placed<br>
in any lower-level caches 1404, which in this instance is the local cache 1404.<br>
Finally, the algorithm again repeats step 1703 with respect to S3, the directory<br>
1206, and for each target group still remaining in (T), if such target group is found<br>
as a record in the directory 1206, the target group is removed from (T), and the<br>
target group is placed in (V) and the entry 1402 thereof is placed in any lower-<br>
level caches 1404, which in this instance are the local and remote caches 1404.<br>
Upon performing step 1703 for each storage device, then, the<br>
validated target bin (V) should contain all target groups that have been found to<br>
exist either in a cache 1404 orthe directory 1206. All target groups remaining in (<br>
the target bin, then, can be assume'd to be bad or no longer in existence, and<br>
therefore can be ignored. If it is the case that (V) is empty, the algorithm ends as<br>
no validated target groups exist, and the algorithm returns a "no target groups are<br>
found" (step 1705). As should be noted, by copying a record or entry 1402 from<br>
the directory 1206 or remote cache 1404 to all lower level caches 1404, such<br>
lower level caches 1404 become charged with cache information that may be<br>
employed for future determinations of whether a user is a member of a group.<br>
Thereafter, presuming at least one validated target group exists in<br>
(V), the algorithm validates the user. In particular, the algorithm searches for a<br>
record or entry 1402 for the user at issue (step 1709), first by looking at S1, the<br>
local cache 1404, then at S2, the remote cache 1404, and then at S3, the<br>
directory. Upon finding a record or entry 1402 (hereinafter, 'item') for the user at<br>
any iteration of step 1709, the algorithm places each group that the user is a<br>
member of into the search bin (S) (step 1711), and in addition populates all lower<br>
level caches 1404 with an entry 1402 for the user (steps 1713). Note that if no<br>
item for the user is found from any iteration of step 1709, the algorithm ends as no<br>
validated user exist, and the algorithm returns a "user not found" (step 1715)<br><br>
-41 -<br>
As may be appreciated, step 1709 is iterated in the order perceived<br>
to correspond to the lowest-cost operation to the highest-cost operation, which in<br>
this case is with regard to S1, then S2, then S3. Accordingly, once a user is<br>
validated, higher-cost operations are avoided. Note that the user may be<br>
validated prior to the target group or groups without departing from the spirit and<br>
scope of the present invention.<br>
Presuming that a validated user is found that is a member of at least<br>
one group as represented by such group being in (S), and at least one validated<br>
target group is found as represented by a corresponding item in (V), and turning<br>
now to Fig. 17B, the algorithm continues by determining from (S) and (V) whether<br>
any group in (S) matches any group in (V) (i.e., the validated target group or<br>
groups) (step 1723). If indeed a group in (S) is found to match an item in (V), the<br>
algorithm ends with a match, and the algorithm returns a "yes" (step 1725).<br>
Otherwise, the algorithm continues by moving all groups in (S) to the local queue<br>
(Q1) (step 1727).<br>
Thereafter, the algorithm performs an iterative process to search for<br>
a membersrup patn from (h√® user (o any target group. The fterative process<br>
requires multiple searches in the local and remote caches 1404 and the directory<br>
1206 to determine group memberships. Since essentially the same process is<br>
performed with regard to each of the queues (Q1, corresponding to the local<br>
cache 1404; Q2, corresponding to the remote cache 1404; and Q3, corresponding<br>
to the directory 1206), such process need only be described with reference to a<br>
genene (Qx) and a genene storage Sx, as is shown in Fig. 17B, where S1 is the<br>
local cache 1404; S2 the remote cache 1404, and S3 the directory 1206.<br>
In particular, and assuming for the moment that (Qx) and Sx in Fig.<br>
17B are (Q1) and S1, the local cache 1404, a determination is first made whether<br>
(Q1) is empty (step 1729). Of course, (Q1) should not initially be empty, but since<br>
the process is iterative, there may come a point at which (Q1) is indeed empty.<br>
Assuming that (Q1) is not initially empty, then, but instead has a. group therein,<br>
such a group is selected and removed from (Q1) and it is determined whether<br>
such group is already in the discard bin (D) (step 1731). Initially, of course, the<br>
group selected and removed from (Q1) is not in (D) inasmuch as the group has<br><br>
-42-<br>
not already been processed, but as the process iterates other groups may be<br>
placed into (Q1), including perhaps groups that have been previously processed,<br>
and as each group is processed it will indeed be moved into (D).<br>
If the group selected and removed from (Q1) has already been<br>
processed and is therefore in (D), the algorithm returns to step (1729), where it is<br>
again determined whether (Q1) is empty. However, if the group selected and<br>
removed from (Q1) has not already been processed and is therefore not in (D),<br>
the algorithm continues by searching for an entry 1402 for the selected group in<br>
the cache 1404 or directory 1206 corresponding to (Q1), which in thiscase is the<br>
local cache 1404 (step 1733).<br>
If no such entry 1402 for the selected group is found in the local<br>
cache 1404, the process continues by moving the group from (Q1) to the remote<br>
queue (Q2) (step 1735), and then returning to step (1729), where it is again<br>
determined whether (Q1) is empty. However, if such an entry 1402 for the<br>
selected group is found in the local cache 1404, the algorithm places each newly<br>
discovered group that the selected group is a member of into the search bin (S)<br>
and moves the selected group to the discard bin (D) (step 1739), and in addition<br>
populates all lower level caches 1404 with an entry 1402 corresponding to the<br>
selected group (step 1737). Note, of course that with regard to (Q1) and the local<br>
cache 1404, no such lower level caches 1404 exist. Thereafter, the algorithm<br>
continues by returning to step 1723, where it is determined whether any group in<br>
(S) (i.e., the newly discovered group(s)) matches any group in (V) (Ie., the<br>
validated target group or groups). Of course, if indeed a group in (S) is found to<br>
match an item in (V), the algorithm ends with a match, and the algorithm returns a<br>
"yes" as at step 1725. Otherwise, the algorithm continues by moving all groups in<br>
S to the local queue (Q1) as at step 1727, and the algorithm continues.<br>
In so doing, the algorithm by way of (Q1) develops all possible paths<br>
from the user to any of the validated target groups to the extent possible with the<br>
local cache 1404. As may now be appreciated, assuming a match is not found,<br>
(Q1) fills up with more newly discovered groups as the process iterates and<br>
empties until all groups in (Q1) are processed by way of the local cache 1404<br>
either to the discard bin (D) or to (Q2) to be processed by way of the remote<br><br>
-43-<br>
cache 1404. Thus, operations at the remote cache 1404, which are presumed to<br>
be more costly, do not occur until all possible operations at the local cache 1404<br>
are exhausted, as occurs when (Q1) is found to be empty at step 1729.<br>
When in fact (Q1) is found to be empty at step 1729, processing<br>
then turns to the remote queue (Q2) in a manner similar to that whtch occurs with<br>
regard to (Q1). In particular, and assuming now that (Qx) and Sx in Fig. 17B are<br>
(Q2) and S2, the remote cache 1404, a determination is first made whether (Q2) is<br>
empty (step 1729). Here, (Q2) is likely not initially empty, although such an event<br>
could occur in the case where the local queue 1404 can itself process all groups<br>
from (Q1). Assuming that (Q2) is not initially empty, then, but instead has a group,<br>
such a group is selected and removed from (Q2) and it is determined whether<br>
such group is already in the discard bin (D) as having been processed (step<br>
1731).<br>
If the group selected and removed from (Q2) has already been<br>
processed and is therefore in (D), the algorithm returns to step (1729), where it is<br>
again determined whether (Q2) is empty. However, if the group selected and<br>
removed from (Q2) has not already been processed and is therefore not in (D),<br>
the algorithm continues by searching for an entry 1402 for the selected group in<br>
the cache 1404 or directory 1206 corresponding to (Q2), which in this case is the<br>
remote cache 1404 (step 1733).<br>
If no such entry 1402 for the selected group is found in the remote<br>
cache 1404, the process continues by moving the group from (Q2) to the directory<br>
queue (Q3) (step 1735), and then returning to step (1729), where it is again<br>
determined whether (Q2) is empty. However, if such an entry 1402 for the<br>
selected group is found in the remote cache 1404, the algorithm places each<br>
newly discovered group that the selected group is a member of into the search bin<br>
(S) and moves the selected group to the discard bin (D) (step 1739), and in<br>
addition populates all lower level caches 1404 with an entry 1402 corresponding<br>
to the selected group (step 1737). Note, of course that with regard to (Q2) and the<br>
remote cache 1404, only local cache 1404 need be so populated. Thereafter, the<br>
algorithm continues by returning to step 1723, where it is determined whether any<br>
group in (S) (i.e., the newly discovered group(s)) matches any group in (V) (i.e.,<br><br>
-44-<br>
the validated target group or groups). Of course, if  indeed a group in (S) is found<br>
to match an item in (V), the algorithm ends with a match, and the algorithm returns<br>
a "yes" as at step 1725. Otherwise, the algorithm continues by moving all groups<br>
in S to the local queue (Q1) as at step 1727, and the algorithm continues back<br>
with (Q1) being processed.<br>
In so doing, the algorithm by way of (Q2) develops all possible paths<br>
from the user to any of the validated target groups to the extent possible with the<br>
remote cache 1404. As may now be appreciated, assuming a match is not found,<br>
(Q2) fills up with more newly discovered groups as the process iterates and<br>
empties unttl all groups in (Q2) are processed by way of the remote cache 1404<br>
either to the discard bin (D) or to (Q3) to be processed by way of the directory<br>
1404. Thus, operations at the directory 1206, which are presumed to be more<br>
costly, do not occur until all possible operations at the remote cache 1404 are<br>
exhausted, as occurs when (Q2) is empty.<br>
Significantly, any groups newly discovered by way of (Q2) and the<br>
remote cache 1404 are first processed by way of (Q1)and the local cache 1404.<br>
Thus, and again, operations at the remote cache 1404, which are presumed to be<br>
more costly, do not occur with regard to the newly discovered groups until all<br>
possible operations at the local cache 1404 are exhausted, as occurs when (Q1)<br>
fs empty.<br>
When in fact (Q2) is found to be empty at step 1729, processing<br>
then turns to the directory queue (Q3) in a manner similarto that which occurs<br>
with regard to (Q1) and (Q2). In particular, and assuming now that (Qx) and Sx in<br>
Fig. 17B are (Q3) and S3, the directory 1206, a determination is first made<br>
whether (Q3) is empty (step 1729). Here, and again, (Q3) is likely not initially<br>
empty, although such an event could occur in the case where the local and remote<br>
queues 1404 can themselves process all groups from (Q1) and (Q2). Assuming<br>
that (Q3) is not initially empty, then, but instead has a group, such a group is<br>
selected and removed from (Q3) and it is determined whether such group is<br>
already in the discard bin (D) as having been processed (step 1731).<br>
If the group selected and removed from (Q3) has already been<br>
processed and is therefore in (D), the algorithm returns to step (1729), where it is<br><br>
-45-<br>
again determined whether (Q3) is empty. However, if the group selected and<br>
removed from (Q3) has not already been processed and is therefore not in (D),<br>
the algorithm continues by searching foran entry 1402 forthe selected group in<br>
the cache 1404 or directory 1206 corresponding to (Q3), which in this case is the<br>
directory 1206 (step 1733).<br>
If no such entry 1402 forthe selected group is found in the directory<br>
1206, the process continues by moving the group out of (Q3) to (D) (step 1735),<br>
and then returning to step (1729), where it is again determined whether (Q3) is<br>
empty. Note that since there is no next queue after (Q3), the selected group<br>
cannot be further processed. However, if such an entry 1402 for the selected<br>
group is found in the remote cache 1404, the algorithm places each newly<br>
discovered group that the selected group is a member of into the search bin (S)<br>
and moves the selected group to the discard bin (D) (step 1739), and in addition<br>
populates all lower level caches 1404 with an entry 1402 corresponding to the<br>
selected group (step 1737). Note, of course that with regard to (Q3) and the<br>
directory 1206, local and remote caches 1404 need be so populated. Thereafter,<br>
the algorithm continues by returning to step 1723, where it is determined whether<br>
any group in (S) (i.e., the newly discovered group(s)) matches any group in (V)<br>
(i.e., the validated target group or groups). Of course, if indeed a group in (S) is<br>
found to match an item in (V), the algorithm ends with a match, and the algorithm<br>
returns a "yes" as at step 1725. Otherwise, the algorithm continues by moving all<br>
groups in S to the local queue (Q1) as at step 1727, and the algorithm continues<br>
back with (Q1) being processed.<br>
In so doing, the algorithm by way of (Q3) develops all possible paths<br>
from the user to any of the validated target groups to the extent possible with the<br>
directory 1206. As may now be appreciated, assuming a match is not found, (Q3)<br>
fills up with more newly discovered groups as the process iterates and empties<br>
until all groups in (Q3) are processed by way of the directory 1206 to the discard<br>
bin (D).<br>
Significantly, any groups newly discovered by way of (Q3) and the<br>
directory 1206 are first processed by way of (Q1) and the local cache 1404. Thus,<br>
and again, operations at the directory 1206, which are presumed to be more<br><br>
-46-<br>
costly, do not occur with regard to the newly discovered groups until all possibie<br>
operations at the local and remote caches 1404 are exhausted, as occurs when<br>
(Q1)and (Q2) are empty.<br>
When in fact (Q3) is found to be empty at step 1729, processing can<br>
go no further inasmuch as there is no (Q4) in this particular scenario, and is<br>
therefore complete. In particular, the algorithm ends without a match, and the<br>
algorithm returns a "no" (step 1741).<br>
It should now be appreciated that the algorithm of the present<br>
invention is designed to perform the lowest-cost operation first before performing<br>
any higher cost operation. As should be appreciated, the algorithm although<br>
disclosed in terms of three leveis of storage (i.e., the local and remote caches<br>
1404 and the directory 1206) could instead be applied to any other number of<br>
leveis of storage, including 2,4, 5, 6, 7, and the like, by defining a like number of<br>
queues. Accordingly, the algorithm of the present invention may be applied to any<br>
multi-Ievel storage arrangement of cached user-group information without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.<br>
Conclusion<br>
The programming necessary to effectuate the processes performed<br>
in connection with the present invention is relatively straight-forward and should<br>
be apparent to the relevant programming public. Accordingly, such programming<br>
is not attached hereto. Any particular programming, then, may be employed to<br>
effectuate the present invention without departing from the spirit and scope<br>
thereof.<br>
In the present invention, a digital rights management (DRM) and<br>
enforcement architecture and method allow the controlled rendering or playing of<br>
arbitrary forms of digital content, where such control is flexible and definable by<br>
the content owner / deveioper of such digital content. The architecture allows and<br>
facilitates such controlled rendering, especially in an office or organization<br>
environment or the like where documents are to be shared amongst a defined<br><br>
-47-<br>
group of individuals or classes of individuals. Such architecture allows a license<br>
for content to be obtained across forests.<br>
It should be appreciated that changes could be made to the<br>
embodiments described above without departing from the inventive concepts<br>
thereof, For example, although the present disclosure describes determining<br>
group membership from the user to the group, such determination may<br>
alternatively be made from the group to the user without departing from the spirit<br>
and scope of the present invention. It should be understood, therefore, that this<br>
invention is not limited to the particular embodiments disclosed, but it is intended<br>
to cover modifications within the spirit and scope of the present invention as<br>
defined by the appended claims.<br><br>
