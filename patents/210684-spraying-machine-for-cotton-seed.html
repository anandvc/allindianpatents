SPRAYING MACHINE FOR COTTON SEED<br>
CENTRAL INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH ON COTTON TECHNOLOGY, INDIAN COUNCIL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH, ADENW ALA ROAD, MATUNGA,<br>
MUMBAI-400 019<br>
GOVT OF INDIA<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner  in which it is to be performed.<br>
GRANTED<br><br><br>
18-10-2005<br>
18 OCT 2005<br><br>
TECHANICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to spraying system for cotton seeds, more particularly spraying system for cotton seeds<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Cottonseeds obtained during ginning of seed cotton are considered an important by-product.<br>
The cottonseed contains about 18-25% oil depending on the quality of seed and the species. The oil is primarily seed as a medium for frying and for manufacture of hydrogenated vegetable products, cooking, salad dressings and for production of soap. This is one of the important edible oils and is much superior in its nutritional value to many of the traditional oils. As per an estimate, about 60 lakh tonnes of cottonseeds produced in India can yield approximately 10 lakh tonnes of oil. The nutritional value of cottonseed is around 9 kcal/g. the average digestibility is around 97% and could be compared with that of soybean, safflower and sunflower. The refined oil with practically no gossypol is pale yellow in color and rich in Vitamin-E and can be used directly as a cooking medium and also for the manufacture of Vanaspati. The keeping quality of oil is also quite good and is comparable with other edible oils.<br>
Utilization of cottonseed oil for human consumption should receive immediate attention in our country for meeting, the shortage of edible oils. It contains more than 50% of poly - unsaturated fatty acids and is very ideal as a component in human diet. This oil is very popular in USA. However in India, it is being used to a very small extent. Therefore efforts are to be made on a war footing to popularise its use in our country which can result in stoppage of import of other edible oils.<br><br>
The seeds being rich in oil and protein are not handled properly as it should be in ginneries. When they are stored in open, there is every possibility of microbial infestation particularly when the humidity is high. The aflatoxin producing fungi makes the meal unfit for consumption by animals and this also affects its exportability; There are many methods of preventing the microbial contamination and aflatoxin production. Propionic acid spray has been found to be very effective. A miniature spraying system has been developed in order to make a uniform spray on a bed of cottonseeds.<br>
OBJECTIVE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main objective of the invention is to provide uniform spraying through this system<br>
Further invention of the invention is to provide uniform spraying through this system in economically<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
                       present invention:vsent invention provides A Spraying system for<br>
cotton seeds comprises an hopper mounted over a screw conveyer with the out let of the said hopper joined to the inlet of the said screw conveyer; an over head tank holding liquid solution for spraying over the said cotton seed passing through the said conveyer; out let of said over head tank is connected to the inlet of a pump and out let of the said pump is connected to an atomizers spraying inside the said conveyer at two locations.<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
FIG -1 shows the front view of the invention FIG-2 shows the side view of the invention<br>
DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The Miniature Spraying System for cottonseeds has been fabricated from stainless steel material except the frame (1) which is made out of mild steel. screw(3) is fitted in Screw housing (2).gland housing and(5) and Plummer block(6) is shown in the system .flexible coupling is shown in the fig by numerical(7)/The machine has a sturdy stand (14" x 3.5" x 2.5") made of mild steel and the table top made of a stainless steel sheet of 14 gauge. There is a hopper feeder(4), which can accommodate 25 kg of cottonseed at a time that is taken through screw conveyor(3) it has 6" diameter with, a pitch of 6". A 3 HP geared motor (8) is provided with a speed of 1440 rpm, the power of which is transmitted to the screw conveyor(3) with an output of 38 rpm. There is an overhead tank (ll)of 10 liter capacity to store 1% propionic acid which is taken through gravity and automized through spray nozzles (10) on to the seeds passing through the conveyor at two places (beginning and in the middle of the screw conveyor) with the help of a pump (9). The motor and pump are operated with the help of a panel board (13). The seeds from the hopper are taken out through the conveyor to a total moisture pick up of 1 % propionic acid and the treated seeds are taken out through a drain and are collected in a crates(14)<br>
WORKING OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
Cottonseed are placed in the hopper and the. propionic acid solution is stored in the overhead tank. When the-motor and pump are switched on simultaneously, the seeds are taken through the seed .conveyor while the. Pump the propionic acid on the seeds. The treated seeds are collected in the bin which can be stored in a suitable place. It is possible to adjust the speed of the conveyor and the rate of spray and the required concentration can be done at will. The system can be used to treat any type of seed with any spray, be it enzymes, seed dressing materials etc.<br>
We CLAIM:<br>
1 A spraying system for cotton seeds comprises an hopper mounted over a screw conveyer with the out let of the said hopper joined to the inlet of the said screw conveyer; an over head tank holding liquid solution for spraying over the said cotton seed passing through the said conveyer; out let of said over head tank is connected to the inlet of a pump and out let of the said pump is connected to an atomizers spraying inside the said conveyer at two locations.<br>
