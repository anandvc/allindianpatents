				<td>EVENT DATA ACQUISITION AND TRANSMISSION SYSTEM<br>
The present invention concerns a data acquisition and<br>
transfer system for transferring data via the mobile<br>
phone network. It is particularly but not exclusively<br>
concerned with the transfer of data from individuals to <br>
central reception point and it is contemplated that the<br>
data may take many different forms. However, one<br>
important feature with which the present invention is<br>
concerned is that the major telecommunications operators<br>
and electronic suppliers are at present involved in the<br>
complex and difficult process of moving from the second<br>
generation of mobile phones to the third generation. As<br>
a result of this shift major companies are going to own<br>
increasingly under-utilised second generation digital<br>
networks and manufacturing capabilities for some time to<br>
come. Thus an aspect of the present invention is<br>
concerned with providing a range of opportunities which<br>
will enable these under-utilised facilities to remain<br>
revenue generating in a profitable manner.<br>
One such opportunity lies in the field of drug testing.<br>
The process of testing new drugs in order to have them<br>
approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies can cost<br>
major drug firms up to a million dollars in lost revenue<br>
for each extra day needed to get approval.<br>
One of the reasons it takes so long to get drugs approved<br>
is the length of time it takes to get sufficient good<br>
quality data out of the trials which have to be carried<br>
out. Doctors frequently mis-record data, and doubleblind<br>
trials are expensive and take time to arrange. It<br>
is believed that schemes already exist to bypass the<br>
problems raised for example by doctors' handwriting and<br>
other vagaries in which test data is captured via the<br>
web. However errors still occur and the data is often<br>
inaccurate.<br>
Thus in accordance with one aspect of the present<br>
invention data will be collected directly from the<br>
patient and from the receptacle from which the ' trial drug<br>
is dispensed.<br>
It will, however, be appreciated that the basic inventive<br>
concept is applicable to a wide range of fields and is<br>
not necessarily limited to the concept of drug trials.<br>
Thus as will be apparent from the following description<br>
the inventive concept is applicable to monitoring the<br>
health of individuals who are not undergoing drug trials,<br>
locating or monitoring individuals for security purposes<br>
and also for carrying out regular checks on operating<br>
machinery.<br>
In order that the present invention may be more readily<br>
understood, the embodiments thereof will now be described<br>
by way of example and with reference to the accompanying<br>
drawings in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic diagram of the overall system<br>
architecture;<br>
Figure 2 is a diagram showing elements of the present<br>
invention in conjunction with the public services<br>
telephone network;<br>
Figure 3 is a block diagram of a sensor/transmitter;<br>
Figure 4 is a plan view of a pill receptacle which can be<br>
used in the system shown in Figures 1 and 2;<br>
Figure 5 is a block diagram of the active components of<br>
Figure 4;<br>
Figures 6 and 7 are flow charts showing modes of<br>
operation of the device of Figure 5;.<br>
Figure 8 shows another form of pill receptacle;<br>
Figure 9 shows a sensor bracelet; and<br>
-Figure 10 is a block diagram of data reception and<br>
polling terminal incorporating the present invention.<br>
*&gt;<br>
Referring now to the drawings, Figure 1 represents in a<br>
generic fashion a. family of monitoring and transmitting<br>
devices which will be described in greater detail<br>
hereinafter. Block 1 represents a generic sensor device<br>
for obtaining data and for transmitting the acquired<br>
data. Block 2 represents the data telecommunications<br>
networks (and their operating companies) over which the<br>
data is transmitted to the device 1 so as to trigger a<br>
response to data which, is transmitted from the device <br>
either in response to a change in the circumstances of<br>
the device, to a signal initiated by an internal clock or<br>
in response to a request received to and from a<br>
processing centre shown at 3. Blpck 4 represents a user<br>
of the system for which the data, perhaps after analysis<br>
in block 3, is eventually returned. The directions of<br>
transmission of the data are shown by the headed arrows.<br>
Turning now to Figure 2 of the accompanying drawings,<br>
this shows a conventional representation of the public<br>
services telephone network at 5. Connected to.. the PSTN 5<br>
are a number of blocks la...In each corresponding to<br>
block 1 of Figure 1. As will be appreciated these<br>
devices need not be identical and may in fact have a<br>
number of different functions. It is for this reason<br>
that some of the devices are connected to the PSTN 5 by<br>
double headed arrows indicating that they are capable of<br>
both receiving and transmitting data to the centre 3<br>
whilst other devices only have a single headed arrow<br>
indicating that they are only capable of sending data to<br>
the centre 3. As there are several different types of<br>
device 1, there may also be several different<br>
organisations each interested in acquiring data so that<br>
Figure 2 shows three such organisations 4a...4c.<br>
Turning now to Figure 3 of the accompanying drawings,<br>
this is a block diagram of circuitry which can be<br>
employed in the devices la...In. Thus the block diagram<br>
comprises a sensor 6 shown. in the figure as having two<br>
data inputs, data 1 and data 2 and adapted to send data<br>
corresponding to the two inputs to a second generation<br>
transmit/receive circuit 7. The circuit 7 operates under<br>
the control of a microprocessor CPU unit 8 which also<br>
controls a clock 9. The clock reduces power consumption<br>
of the sensor by only switching the sensor on in response<br>
to appropriate commands from the CPU 8. Thus in several<br>
of its potential functions the device has a power saving<br>
.sleep mode. Thus the sensor can sense data I and data <br>
either simultaneously or at staggered intervals which<br>
need not be the same. Because of the possibility that<br>
the sensors may be required to operate over extended<br>
periods of time the question of power usage is of<br>
considerable importance and this feature will be<br>
described in greater detail hereinafter, in conjunction<br>
with Figure 10 of the accompanying drawings. The<br>
transmit/receive circuit 7, the CPU 8, and the clock 9<br>
may all be formed as a microcircuit on a single chip.<br>
The circuit can include an optional memory 10 and also<br>
includes a power source 11 which can be any suitable<br>
small battery such as the lithium batteries used to power<br>
calculators and digital watches. It is of course<br>
entirely possible for the power source to include<br>
photocells so that electrical energy can be generated by<br>
ambient light.<br>
It will be appreciated that the nature of the sensor has<br>
not been specified and it is of course possible for the<br>
sensor to have only a single data input or a plurality of<br>
data inputs greater than two in number in accordance with<br>
the functions of the sensor within the overall system.<br>
Returning now to device la of Figure 2<br>
It will be appreciated that the device shown in Figure <br>
is essentially a generic one and that certain of the<br>
devices shown in Figure 2 have only a one-way<br>
communication path with the PSTN 5 so that they cannot be<br>
interrogated by the centre 3. In these devices the<br>
send/receive circuit 7 need of course only have a send<br>
capability so that it can be simplified. Naturally if<br>
efficiencies of scale are present it may be simpler to<br>
have a send/receive capability in every device with the<br>
receive facility only being enabled in the appropriate<br>
circumstances.<br>
One embodiment of a device such as la will now be<br>
described with regard to Figures 4 and 5 of the<br>
accompanying drawings. Thus device la is concerned with<br>
monitoring.a drug testing program in which the patient<br>
has to take a regular dosage of the drug tinder test and<br>
in which a drug company is interested in the patient's<br>
response to this dosage. In this embodiment it is<br>
accordingly necessary for the drug company to know both<br>
when a pill is taken and the response by the patient to<br>
the taking of the drug. In its simplest form the device<br>
la will merely indicate that the patient has opened the<br>
pill receptacle. On the opening of the receptacle, the<br>
sensor is intended to give an instruction to the transmit<br>
circuit to send a short text message to the processing<br>
centre 3 where the fact that the receptacle has been<br>
opened, and the timing of its opening, is logged for<br>
future analysis and transmission to the initial user,<br>
namely the drug company, for whom the data is intended.<br>
Figure 4 of the drawings shows a typical receptacle for<br>
pills in the form of a laminated strip 20 having an<br>
electro conductive metal foil surface provided with<br>
recesses 21 each holding a single pill. The sensor and<br>
its associated circuitry and power supply are located at<br>
22. When the patient breaks the laminated foil to remove<br>
a pill, this is detected by the sensor which causes the<br>
send circuit 7, shown in Figure 5, to send the<br>
appropriate message. In Figure 5 the laminated foil is<br>
again shown at 20 and provides-a conductive path between<br>
the power source 11 and the sensor 6 which path is<br>
changed each time the laminate is broken to enable the<br>
patient to remove a pill. Accordingly the sensor 6 can<br>
operate by detecting changes in the resistance or<br>
capacitance of the conductive foil. The foil and the<br>
various items of circuitry are mounted on a backing strip<br>
22 of suitable material such as thick paper or cardboard<br>
which is relatively tougher than that of the foil so that<br>
a user will preferentially break the laminate to activate<br>
the sensor. Given that the device employs a<br>
microprocessor and associated memory it is possible to<br>
pre-program the device with a schedule so that if the<br>
schedule is not followed an alert message is transmitted<br>
to the centre 3.<br>
In applications where the intervals between pills being<br>
taken are not critical to the safety of the patient, a<br>
more sophisticated embodiment of the present invention<br>
may be used. In one such embodiment, data will be<br>
transmitted to the centre 3 on the transmission of a<br>
polling request from the centre 3. In such a case the<br>
breaking of the foil might not cause the immediate<br>
transmission of a signal to the centre 3 but will merely<br>
cause the fact that the foil has been broken to be stored<br>
in memory. Accordingly, when a request is received the<br>
stored data will then be sent as before. In another<br>
variant information about the timing of each pill's<br>
removal can be stored in memory contained within the foil<br>
pack, and all such stored data may be transmitted in a<br>
single communications session, so that the battery power<br>
requirements of the foil pack, and thus its size and<br>
weight, are reduced.<br>
There will now be described a more sophisticated variant<br>
of the device just described with reference to Figures 4<br>
and 5. As already mentioned it may well be that the drug<br>
company instigating the tests will require further<br>
information in addition to the fact that a patient has<br>
been taking his/her pills at the appropriate times and<br>
logging the times at which the pills were taken. Thus it<br>
is entirely possible for the drug company to wish to be<br>
able to monitor changes in the patient's condition when<br>
undergoing the drug regime. In such a situation it may<br>
be necessary for the patient to be provided with two<br>
sensing and transmitting devices. One device could be<br>
similar to the device just described with regard to<br>
Figures 4 and 5 whilst the other device could be a more<br>
sophisticated variant of this device which is attached to<br>
the patient and which monitors factors relevant to the<br>
patient's state of health. Such factors could be blood<br>
pressure, temperature, heart rate, skin pH and<br>
perspiration rate etc. and will of course depend on the<br>
nature of the drug being tested. Accordingly in this<br>
variant of the present invention the sensor 6 will accept<br>
a number of different inputs so that the required<br>
information can eventually be transmitted to the main<br>
centre 3. Additionally in order to conserve power the<br>
sensor may only be activated in response to a request<br>
received at the circuit 7 for stored information to be<br>
sent as text messages back to the centre 3. One way of<br>
ensuring that the data is relevant would be to time the<br>
polling request appropriately in response to data already<br>
transmitted with regard to the timing of the patient's<br>
taking of the drug. In this scenario it is assumed that<br>
there is no direct linkage between the sensor monitoring<br>
the patient's condition and the sensor monitoring the<br>
taking of the drugs. However, in another variant one or<br>
other of the devices could send its stored data to be<br>
appended to the data stored in the other device so that<br>
on interrogation from the centre 3 all the appropriate<br>
data is transmitted at the same time.<br>
The device associated directly with the patient could be<br>
in the form of a bracelet worn by the patient or in the<br>
form of a patch such as one or. more electrodes attached<br>
directly to the patient's skin by suitable adhesives or<br>
taping and worn under the patient's clothing.<br>
The flow diagrams of Figures 6 and 7 show alternative<br>
ways in which the generated data can be accessed by the<br>
centre 3. In these flow diagrams 6a represents the<br>
sensor 6 shown, in Figures 4.. and 5 and 6b represents a<br>
similar sensor but monitoring health characteristics of<br>
the patient involved. It will be appreciated that both<br>
of these sensors are similar to the one described with<br>
reference to Figure 3.<br>
In the flow diagram of Figure 6 it is assumed that the<br>
sensor 6a operates in its normal manner and when a pill<br>
is taken transmits this fact at step SI. to the centre <br>
where it is received at step S2. At step S3 a computer<br>
(not shown) at centre generates a log indicating that a<br>
particular patient has taken a particular pill at a<br>
particular time. In step S4 the centre 3 sends a request<br>
to interrogate the sensor 6b and to request the latter to<br>
transmit in step S5 the data that it has acquired back to<br>
the centre 3 so that this data can be added to the log<br>
generated at step S3 . Naturally the data accessed in the<br>
transmit request step S4 can also include previous data<br>
which has been stored by the sensor 6b at appropriate<br>
intervals after the last time it was polled by the centre<br>
In the flow diagram of Figure 7 an alternative scenario<br>
is shown-in which the output of sensor 6a in response to<br>
the removal of a pill is stored in memory at step SB<br>
together with data from sensor 6b for subsequent<br>
transmission. In step S8 the centre 3 generates a poll<br>
signal to interrogate the stored data.<br>
In response to this interrogation step a step S9 makes<br>
the decision as to whether or not one or more pills have<br>
been taken since the last poll of the device. This<br>
information would of course be of importance to the<br>
company making the drug trial. Whether or not a pill has<br>
been taken data concerning the patients condition is<br>
transmitted in step S10 and the fact that a pill has been<br>
taken is flagged in step Sll. If a pill has not been<br>
taken this information is also supplied to step S12 where<br>
a .log of the available data is generated for subsequent<br>
use.<br>
It will be appreciated that the embodiment of Figure 7<br>
could be changed in a relatively simple manner by keeping<br>
the data separate in two streams in which each memory 10<br>
of each sensor device is interrogated by the centre 1<br>
with each sensor device sending its relevant data<br>
independently of the other to generate the final log at<br>
the centre 1.<br>
It will be appreciated that in the system just described<br>
the quality of data gathered is likely to be much more<br>
accurate than similar data gathered by a doctor or even<br>
from a patients own records and it would also be gathered<br>
much faster. The advantage for this for the drug company<br>
carrying out the tests is clear in that there will be<br>
reduced time delay before a successful drug can be<br>
marketed. Additionally for the telecommunication network<br>
operator the advantage is higher utilisation of their<br>
network, but with limited life span contract thus for a<br>
drug testing program each sensor might be required to be<br>
able to operate over a matter of a few weeks or months.<br>
For the electronic suppliers there will be the<br>
corresponding advantage of the opportunity to get more<br>
utilisation out of their 2g second generation cellular<br>
telephone chip set production capabilities. However, it<br>
must be appreciated that exactly the same concept may be<br>
applied when inevitable progress means a move from third<br>
generation chip sets to fourth generation chip sets and<br>
so on.<br>
It must be appreciated that the receptacle for pills<br>
disclosed in Figures 4 and 5 can take other forms. Thus<br>
Figure 8 shows the receptacle in the form of a standard<br>
pill bottle 30. In such a case the sensor 6 will merely<br>
record for transmission the removal of the led of the<br>
bottle.<br>
Figure 9 shows a bracelet 40 which can be worn by a user,<br>
in order to detect variations in the user's bodily<br>
functions. ,<br>
As already mentioned the basic sensor configuration shown<br>
in Figure 3 has the potential to carry out a wide range<br>
of functions. Thus the device shown at Ib in Figure 2<br>
could be utilised to detect the possibility of impending<br>
heart attacks in a patient. In this case, the sensor 6<br>
has appropriate sensors and embedded software that detect<br>
heart beat patterns that are known to be precursors of a<br>
heart attack. When these are detected by the CPU the<br>
transmit section will be enabled to send an appropriate<br>
message to the centre 3 so that emergency services could<br>
be alerted. It is of course possible also to alert the<br>
wearer with the risk that the shock might advance the<br>
heart attack.<br>
In an exactly equivalent manner the sensor just described<br>
could be associated with machinery rather than with<br>
individual humans so as to detect actual or imminent<br>
failure and alert owners or maintenance companies. The<br>
sensors can also provide useful data to manufacturers<br>
about the conditions under which a product fails.<br>
Sensor Ic in Figure 2 is shown as having a GPS capability<br>
and in this variant of the invention the sensor 6 is a<br>
motion location sensor and the send/receive circuit 7 can<br>
be simplified so that it is a single-use message sender.<br>
Such a device can be attached to valuable items so that<br>
if they are moved the police will be alerted. Combining<br>
this feature with the GPS capability the device will also<br>
be able to tell the police where the article is.<br>
As is apparent from the foregoing description one of the<br>
advantages of the centre 3 is that it can operate on<br>
behalf of a number of clients and that it will also<br>
generate a substantial amount of secondary data. (<br>
In all of the variants described above the question of<br>
maintaining a sufficient power supply for the sensors and<br>
their associated send/receive circuits is of considerable<br>
importance. In order to conserve power each sensor may<br>
have a sleep mode in which there is minimal power<br>
consumption in such a case the sensor might only respond<br>
to a polling signal from the centre 3 and be quiescent<br>
until the polling signal has been received.<br>
Turning now to Figure 10 of the accompanying drawings<br>
this shows in greater detail a data reception and polling<br>
terminal 40 corresponding to the centre'3 shown in Figure<br>
Figure 10 again shows the PSTN network at 5 and sensor<br>
devices la...In. As before some of these devices have<br>
only a transmit capability and others have a<br>
receive/transmit capability.<br>
In the centre of polling terminal 40 blocks 41a, 41b and<br>
41c represent receive terminals for receiving data<br>
signals from devices similar to send only device la or<br>
for both sending data to and receiving data from sensor<br>
devices such as device In. Thus terminal 4la represents<br>
a receive-only terminal, whilst terminals 41b and 41c are<br>
transmit/receive terminals. Each terminal is capable of<br><br>
at least receiving data from a large number of sensor<br>
devices, and some terminals can also transmit to a large<br>
number of sensor devices* Associated with each terminal<br>
is an electronic processor. Terminal 41a is shown<br>
connected to a processor 42 whilst terminals 41b, 41c are<br>
shown connected to a data processing system 44.<br>
Processor 42 on receipt of data from a sensor devise is<br>
programmed to recognise the source of the data and to log<br>
the data, including time of receipt, in an appropriate<br>
storage area 43.<br>
Data processing system 44 is also capable of generating<br>
outgoing data such, as polling calls and is also<br>
programmed to store in appropriate files details of all<br>
outgoing and incoming data as required by a user of the<br>
system. As already discussed power conservation is an<br>
important factor in the operation of the various sensors.<br>
Thus it will be seen that polling terminal 40 also<br>
includes a system clock which can be of any suitable<br>
type. Each processor can have its own clock or, as shown<br>
a single clock can be used. Data processing system 44<br>
also includes a storage area 46 storing Sensor Timing<br>
Data, namely the time at which each sensor which is to be<br>
polled in synchronism with that sensor's clock switching<br>
the sensor on and in addition, if there are passive<br>
sensors, the times at which data is expected to be<br>
received from the sensors. The data processing system 44<br>
also includes a stored set of hatch routines indicated at<br>
47 in order to control the polling of target sensors at<br>
appropriate times as set by the STD file 46. The<br>
batching routine can also flag if a non-polled sensor has<br>
been quiescent for too long a period in response to data<br>
stored on the same file area. Provided that each sensor<br>
clock 9 is in nominal synchronism with the system clock<br>
or its associated clock then the combination of the<br>
synchronised clocks, the STD file and the Batch routine<br>
will ensure that each device to be polled can remain in a<br>
very lower power. Mode with only its clock operational<br>
and its memory contents refreshed except when data is<br>
required. Naturally the polling times will vary with<br>
polling intervals for security sensors being shorter than<br>
those, for example, drug testing.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
