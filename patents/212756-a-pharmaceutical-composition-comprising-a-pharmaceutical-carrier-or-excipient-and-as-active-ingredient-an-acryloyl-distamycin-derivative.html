Distamycin A and analogues thereof hereinafter referred to as distamycin and distamycin-like derivatives, are known in the art as cytotoxic agents useful in antitumor therapy.<br>
Distamycm. A is an antibiotic substance wilh antiviral and antiprotozoal activity, having a polypyrrole fiamework [Nature 203:1064 (1964); J. Med Chem. 32:774-778 (1989)]. The international patent applications WO 90/11277, WO 98/04524, WO 98/21202, WO 99/50265, WO 99/50266 and WO 01/40181 (claiming priority from British patent application No, 9928703,9), all in the name of the applicant itself and herewith incorporated by reference, disclose acryloyl distamycin derivatives wherein the amidino moiety of distamycm. is optionally replaced by nitrogen-contaiuing eading groups such as, for instance, cyanamidino, N-methylamidino, guanidino, carbamoyl, amidoxime, cyano and the like, and/or wherein the polypyrrole framework of distamycin, or part of it, is replaced by varying carbocyclic or heterocyclic moieties.<br>

The present invention further provides a product comprising an acryloyl distamycin derivative of formula (I), as defined above, an antimicrotubule agent and/or an antimetabolite, as a combined preparation for simultaneous, separate or sequential use in antitumor therapy.<br><br>
A further aspect of the present invention is to provide a method of treating a mammal, including humans, suffering from a neoplastic disease state, which method comprises administering to said mammal the above acryloyl distamycin derivative of formula (I), an antimicrotubule agent and/or an antimetabolite, in amounts effective to produce a synergistic antineoplastic effect<br>
The present invention also provides a method for lowering the side effects caused by antineoplastic therapy with an antineoplastic agent in a mammal in need thereof<br><br>
including humans, the method compxising administering to said mammal a combined preparation comprising an acryloyl distamycin derivative of formula (I), an antimicrotubule agent and/or an antimetabolite, in amounts effective to produce a synergistic antineoplastic effect<br>
By the term "synergistic antineoplastic effect, as used herein, it is meant the inhibition of the growth tumor, preferably the complete regression of the tumor, by administering an effective amount of the combination comprising an acryloyl distamycin derivative of formula (I), an antimicrotubule agent and/or an antimetabolite to mammals, including humans.<br>
By the term "administered " or "administering", as used herein, it is meant parenteral and/or oral administration; the term "parenteral" means intravenous, subcutaneous and intramuscular administration.<br>
In the method of the present invention, the acryloyl distamycin derivative may be<br>
administered simultaneously with the antimicrotubule agent or with the antimetabolite.<br>
Alternatively, the two drugs may be administered sequentially in either order.<br>
When the acryloyl distamycin derivative is administered with both the antimicrotubule<br>
agent and the antimetabolite, according to an embodiment of the invention, the drugs<br>
are preferably administered sequentially, in any order.<br>
In this respect, it will be appreciated that the actual preferred method and order of<br>
administration will vary according to, inter alias, the particular formulation of the<br>
acryloyl distamycin of formula Q) being used, the particular formulation of the<br>
antimicrotubule agent and/or the antimetabolite being used, theparticular tumor model<br>
being treated as well as the particular host being treated.<br>
To administer the acryloyl distamycin derivative of formula (I),  according to the<br>
method of the invention, the course of therapy generally employed comprises doses<br>
varying from about 0.05 to about 100 mg/m2 of body surface area and, more preferably,<br>
from about 0.1 to about 50 mg/m2 of body surface area.<br>
For the administration of the taxanes, according to the method of the invention, the<br>
course of therapy generally employed comprises doses varying from about 1 to about<br><br>
1000 mg/m2 of body surface area and, more preferably, from about 10 to about 500<br>
mg/m2 of body surface area.<br>
For the administration of the vinca alkaloids, according to the method of the invention,<br>
the course of therapy generally employed comprises doses varying from about 0,1 to<br>
about 1000 mg/m2 of body surface area and, more preferably, from about 0.5 to about<br>
100 mg/m2 of body surfece area.<br>
For the administration of the antimetabolite according to the invention, the course of<br>
therapy generally employed comprises doses varying from about 0.1 to about 10 g/m2<br>
of body surface area and, more preferably, from about 1 to about 5 g/m2 of body<br>
surface area.<br>
The antineoplastic therapy of the present invention is particularly suitable for treating<br>
breast, ovary, lung, colon, kidney, stomach, pancreas, liver, melanoma, leukemia and<br>
brain tumors in mammals, including humans.<br>
In a further aspect, the present invention is directed to a composition comprising an effective amount of an acryloyl distamycin derivative of formula (I), as defined above, an antimicrotubule agent and/or an antimetabolite, in the preparation of a medicament for use in the prevention or treatment of metastasis or in the treatment of tumors by inhibition of angiogenesis.<br>
As stated above, the effect of an acryloyl distamycin derivative of formula (1) with an antimicrotubule agent and/or an antimetabolite, is significantly increased without a parallel increase of toxicity. In other words, the combined therapy of the present invention enhances the antitumoral effects of the acryloyl distamycin derivative and of the other drug, being either an antimicrotubule, an antimetabolite or a combination thereof and, hence, provides the most effective and least toxic treatment for tumors.<br>
The superadditive effects of the combined preparations of the invention are shown, for instance, by the following in vivo antitumor activity data which are intended to illustrate the present invention without posing any limitation to it.<br><br>
L   »<br>
At the dose of 15 mg/kg of gemcitabine alone (day +1 after tumor injection, 2 h after PNU166196 administration) and at the dose of 0-7 mg/kg of PNU 166196 alone (days +1,6) were associated, without toxicity, ]LS% values of 50 and 58, respectively. Combining gemcitabine and PNU 166196 at the same doses with the same schedule, an increase of activity with ILS% values of 127 were observed, thus indicating a synergistic effect<br>
