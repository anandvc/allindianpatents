				<td>Housing for storing multiple information discs<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a housing for storing multiple information discs, more particularly multiple optical discs having a central aperture such as CD's, DVD's etc., the housing comprising the following three housing parts; a hinging first housing part having the general shape of a shallow open box having a first housing part main wall, opposed first housing part lateral side walls and opposed first housing part transverse side walls; a hinging second housing part having the general shape of a shallow open box having a second housing part main wall, opposed second housing part lateral side walls and opposed second housing part transverse side walls; an intermediate third housing part arranged between the first and second housing parts and having an intermediate housing part main wall, opposed intermediate housing part lateral side walls and opposed intermediate housing part transverse side walls; four comer hinges, two for connecting the first housing part to the intermediate housing part and two for connecting the second housing part to the intermediate housing part on opposite sides of the intermediate housing part main wall so that each of the said first and second housing parts hingingly cooperates with the intermediate housing part on opposite sides; each comer hinge being formed by two hinge elements respectively, one hinge element being a hinge arm connected to one of the said three housing parts and the other hinge element being connected to another of the three housing parts.<br>
A housing of this general kind for storing multiple information discs is known from EPO 114631 Al. The known housing is designed for the storage of a number of optical discs and may be seen as a special modification of the classic Jewel Box housing for storing a single optical information disc such as a CD, a CD-ROM, a DVD, etc. The well known classic single disc Jewel Box design comprises a lid part which is hingingly connected to a bottom part in which a so called tray part is secured provided with a centrally located holding device for holding the one information disc. The multiple information disc housing according to EP 0 114631 however basically comprises three housing parts, i.e. two identical hinging housing parts which are identical to the single CD basic Jewel Box bottom part and an intermediate housing part. The intermediate third housing part has opposed lateral intermediate housing part side walls which, in the closed condition of the housing, cover the<br><br>
corresponding lateral side walls of the hinging first and second housing parts. The height dimension of this prior art multiple information disc housing is twice the height dimension of a single disc classic Jewel Box design, the remaining dimension being generally identical to the classic Jewel Box design so that the housing may be arranged next to single disc Jewel boxes in a sales display stand, a bookcase, etc..<br>
This prior art multiple information disc housing has the following disadvantages.<br>
In the absence of a lid part, there is no printed lid part insert sheet available so that a user is not enabled to immediately read information on the inside of the lid part, additionally provided to the information readable from the outside. In the standard single disc housing the lid part may be provided with a simple single sheet information insert or with a multiple page booklet. Jewel Box manufactures use automated machinery to introduce the lid part inserts in the standard Jewel Box lid parts to improve productivity. Unfortunately with the prior art multiple information disc housing, such available production machinery can not be used.<br>
In opening one of the first and second housing parts, a user not only hingingly moves the housing part relative to the remainder of the housing, but also a CD which is provided on the disc holding means of the housing part being moved. There is a risk that the CD may fall out of the housing, more particularly while the hinging housing part which is being moved has a general shape which is identical to a standard Jewel Box bottom part including an inserted tray part. In the bottom part of standard Jewel boxes, the opposed bottom part lateral side walls do not completely cover the side edges of the optical disc. Leaving out the tray parts from one or both the hinging first and second housing parts of the prior art multiple information disc housing is not an option. The tray part is needed to retain the printed insert sheets provided between the tray part and the hinging first and second housing parts respectively, even in cases that a CD would not be provided on the housing part in question.<br>
Providing an information booklet is difficult or impossible in cases wherein the intermediate third housing part main wall is provided with holding means for an optical disc at both of its opposed faces.<br>
The housing includes at least five separate parts, the three housing parts already mentioned and a tray part in each of the two hinging bottom parts and<br><br>
possibly additionally disc holding means at one or both faces of the main wall of the intermediate housing part.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the invention is to provide a housing of the kind referred to the opening paragraph in which at least one of the above indicated disadvantages is avoided. The housing according to the invention may be provided with many additional features to improve the esthetic appearance, the esthetic quality, the ease of manipulation, etc. so that a more modem and easily manipulated high quality housing for storing a number of information discs may be provided.<br>
The above object is achieved by the housing for storing multiple information discs according to the invention, which has the features as defined in claim 1. Preferably, the first housing part is a lid part and the second housing part is a bottom part.<br>
The housing for storing multiple information discs according to the invention may now be provided with a printed insert sheet or a printed multiple sheet insert booklet of the kind conventional with single disc Jewel Boxes. There is no optical disc provided on holding means on the first housing part, particularly the lid part, so that this part is light and easy to open so that any risk of detachment of an optical disc from the lid part during opening is effectively eliminated.<br>
Owing to the special positioning of the hinge arms and the hinge walls, the corner hinges which are formed lie as it were recessed with respect to the lateral contours of the housing formed by the lateral side walls of the second housing part, particularly the bottom part, the intermediate housing part and the first housing part, particularly the lid part. As a result of this the housing, more in particular the hinges thereof which are thus obtained, is more resistant to mechanical external influences caused by for example dropping or impacts then by the known classic prior art multiple disc housing. The housing according to the invention therefore is suitable for storing all kinds of disc shaped information carriers such as optical or magneto optical discs, for example provided with audio, video or data information.<br>
In this respect the multiple information disc housing according to the invention is more related to more modern Jewel Box designs, more particularly of the kind disclosed in US Patent 5 890 590, assigned to the assignee of the present patent application, the disclosure and drawings of which are incorporatedherewithby reference.<br><br>
An embodiment of the invention which is important from the point of view of ease of manipulation by a user is defined in claim 2. hi principle the said corner recesses could be provided at opposite intermediate housing part transverse side walls, which would provide a housing having essentially a zig-zag configuration. Manipulation of such a zig-zag configuration however is usually perceived more difficult a user, inducing the risk of dropping the housing or any discs present in the housing or both.<br>
A further preferred embodiment of a housing according to the invention is defined in claim 3. The main advantage of this embodiment is, that in de closed condition of the first housing part, especially the lid part, and the second housing part, especially, the bottom part, the housing may exhibit the general shape of a substantially folly closed rectangular right angled parallepiped, due to the fact that the hinge arms are positioned in pairs one over the other and the top hinge earn walls of the hinge arms are disposed substantially flush with the lid part main wall and the bottom part main wall respectively.<br>
Preferred also is a further embodiment of the invention according to claim 4. Having rounded comers, the multiple information disc housing according to this embodiment of the invention may have a much more sleek and neat outer appearance than the already discussedprior art multiple disc housing according to EP 0 114 631 A, in fact more in accordance with the more advanced single disc Jewel Box design of US 5 890 590. Also, the presence of rounded housing corners gives better protection to damaging the housing or any of its individual parts.<br>
A further embodiment of the invention is claimed in claim 5. This embodiment enables using the multiple disc housing according to the invention for storing at least three discs, one in the bottom part and two on opposite sides of the intermediate housing part main wall respectively. However, even more discs could be stored. US 6 241 089, also assigned to the present assignee and herewith incorporated by reference, discloses a holding device for co-operation with the center opening of two individual discs, stacked one over the other. With an embodiment of the invention incorporating a holding device of this known kind, for example provided centrally on the side of the intermediate housing part facing the lid part, four information discs may be stored in the multiple disc housing according to the invention. Different other embodiments, to be discussed later in the disclosure, may be used to store four or even more than four information discs in the housing according to the invention.<br>
A further embodiment of the invention is defined in claim 6. The hinge arms and the hinge walls are thus coupled to one another with hinging possibility in a simple and reliable manner which is known per se.<br><br>
To facilitate the fastening of the lid part to the intermediate housing part and the intermediate housing part to the bottom part respectively, an embodiment of the invention may be used according to claim 7. The hinge arms are preferably resilient in a direction towards one another, i.e. along a line extending between the two arms and/or away from one another whereas the hinge walls are rigid. The studs or round pins are preferably present on the hinge arms and can be easily inserted into the openings which are present in the hinge walls in this case, during the preferably automatic assembly process of the housing. After assembly the resilient property of the hinge arms ensuresthat the studs remain locked in the openings. The bottom part as well as the side of the intermediate housing part directed to the lid part usually has a box shape and is provided with vertical side walls. The recessed hinge walls are preferably formed by wall portions which are shifted to the inside with respect to the side walls in such a bottom part or intermediate housing part. Furthermore, a somewhat yielding and accordingly particularly effective protection of the comer hinges may be achieved.<br>
In accordance with an embodiment according to claim 8, the protection walls are of a resilient construction and therefore are resilient in a direction towards one another and away from one another.<br>
A further embodiment of the invention is defined in claim 9. According to this embodiment the protection walls extend entirely within the outer contours of the housing. The protection walls preferably lie in the extended directions of the side walls of the bottom parts and the intermediate housing part respectively.<br>
A further embodiment of the invention is defined in claim 10. The rounded transitions which are thus obtained are a desirable way to provide rounded angles at the comer portions of the housing adjacent to comer hinges. Rounded angles render the housing more customer friendly on account of the absence of sharp comer portions and have a improved resistance to damage in comparison to sharp angles. Preferably therefor all corners of the housing are grounded angle comers. In this respect an embodiment of the invention according to claim 11 may be used. With this embodiment, each of the protection walls has a fluent curved portion which merges into a corresponding free end portion so that in a closed condition a rounded transition is formed between corresponding lateral sides and a corresponding rear side of the intermediate housing part and the bottom part respectively.<br>
A further embodiment of the invention is defined in claim 12. The interior tags present on the lid part may be used for automated insertion of a document such as a printed<br><br>
sheet or booklet in the lid part. The tags do not interfere with the design of the lid part lateral side walls.<br>
Preferably a further embodiment of the invention according to claim 13 is used. In this way a low cost high quality product may be achieved.<br>
A farther embodiment of the invention is defined in claim 14. Preferably also the embodiment of claim 15 is used. In modem designs of single disc Jewel Box housings, information is visibly provided at all faces and sides of the housing so that the housing may be arranged in a random position on a sales stand or in a storage rack, etc. while the essential information provided may always be visible from the outside. The above latter embodiments provide identical advantages with the multiple information disc housing according to the invention. Preferably, in order to provide maximum visibility of the printed information which may be provided on any inserts included in the housing, a further embodiment of the invention may be used according to claim 16. In this respect a further interesting embodiment of the invention is defined in claim 17.<br>
Further interesting embodiment of the inventions are defined in claims 18 to 31.<br>
The intermediate housing parts of the multiple information disc housing accordingto the invention may suitably be configured in a variety of ways. One possibility is an embodiment of the invention according to claim 32. In this embodiment the intermediate housing part is not provided with an intermediate housing part retaining means or tray part which is detachably secured to the intermediate housing part, but is provided with an integrally formed intermediate housing part holding device on at least one of its opposed main wall faces.<br>
A further interesting embodiment of the invention is defined in claim 33. With this embodiment, the exterior appearance of the multiple information disc housing according to the invention may easily be made to approach as much as possible the exterior appearance of a single disc housing, so that the two kinds of housings, the single disc housing and the multiple disc housing accordingto the invention, may immediately be recognized by the customer to belong to a same category of housings, which therefore may be stored in storage compartments provided for housings of this kind, for example in a book case in a private home, in a storage compartment provided for the purpose in a motor car or in a commercial sales stand, etc. Of course the main wall of the intermediate housing part does not necessarily need to have the combined thickness dimension of a lid part stacked onto a bottom part, but may have a thickness dimension which is for example identical to the thickness dimension of<br><br>
a bottom part or a lid part. In this way more room is provided in the multiple information disc housing for the storage of multiple discs or the storage of other items such as information sheets or booklets, etc.<br>
A further interesting embodiment according to the invention is defined in claim 34. The hinging tray part which is provided as a fourth housing part according to this embodiment provides a further means for storing more information discs in the multiple information disc housing of the invention. Hinging tray parts are known per se from the prior art, see for example US Patent 5 284 243 or US Patent 5 685 425, both incorporated herewith by reference. The multiple information disc housing according to the above discussed latter embodiment of the invention comprises a special adaptation of the housing to include a hinging tray part.<br>
A further embodiment according to the invention defined in claim 35 may be interesting to prevent the presence of an open space at the rear end of the hingeable tray part.<br>
These and further and other objects and features of the invention are apparent in the disclosure which includes the above and on-going written specification with the claims and the drawings.<br>
