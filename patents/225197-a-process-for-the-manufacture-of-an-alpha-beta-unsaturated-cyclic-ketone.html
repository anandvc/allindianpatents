				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to the field of organic synthesis and<br>
more particularly to a process for the manufacture of an alpha, beta-unsaturated cyclic<br>
ketone, comprising the dehydrogenation of a secondary allylic alcohol in the presence<br>
of at least one metal carboxylate.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
It is known that many alcohols can be catalytically dehydrogenated to the<br>
corresponding carbonyl compounds (for general information see Hydlicky Milos,<br>
Oxidations in Organic Chemistry, ACS Monograph 186, American Chemical Society,<br>
Washington, DC, 1990, p. 132 and Smith M.B. and March J. Advanced Organic<br>
Chemistry, 5th edition, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York, 2001, pp. 1515-1516).<br>
Usually, dehydrogenation of alcohols allows preparation of the target carbonyl<br>
compounds with high yields and throughputs. To that end, copper, nickel, and<br>
palladium based catalysts have been typically used to carry out the dehydrogenation<br>
of alcohols.<br>
An attempt to produce alpha, beta-unsaturated cyclic ketones, such as carvone,<br>
by catalytic dehydrogenation of a corresponding secondary allylic cyclic alcohol, such<br>
as carveol, was made in 1927 (Treibs W. and Schmidt H, Ber., 1927, 60 B, pp. 2335-<br>
2341). However, this attempt failed as both copper and nickel based catalysts<br>
converted the carveol into carvacrol and tetrahydrocarvone, but not to carvone. This<br>
was due, in part, to two potential side reactions that can accompany the catalytic<br>
dehydrogenation of a secondary allylic cyclic alcohol, such as carveol. First, both the<br>
starting material and the product possess double bonds, which can react with<br>
hydrogen that is produced as a result of dehydrogenation. Secondly, these double<br>
bonds easily isomerize at high temperature in the presence of catalysts to provide an<br>
aromatic structure. The scheme below represents these side reactions that can occur<br>
during, for example, the dehydrogenation of carveol.<br>
Prior to the discovery of the present invention, most known methods for the<br>
preparation of alpha, beta-unsaturated cyclic ketones from a corresponding secondary<br>
allylic cyclic alcohol, such as the preparation of carvone from carveol. involve some<br>
type of an oxidation reaction. These methods can be divided in two categories.<br>
The first of these two methods is known as the Oppenauer oxidation, where<br>
hydrogen is transferred from carveol to an auxiliary carbonyl compound. Japanese<br>
patent JP 50/58031 describes carveol oxidation in the presence of aluminum<br>
isopropoxide as catalyst, cyclohexanone as hydrogen acceptor, and xylene as solvent.<br>
The yield of the 88% pure carvone was 82%. A better yield of carvone (91%) was<br>
obtained by employing of a complex aluminum catalyst and three equivalents of<br>
pivalaldehyde as hydrogen acceptor in a methylene chloride solution (Takashi Ooi, et<br>
al, Synthesis, 2002, No. 2, pp. 279-291). The new aluminum complex catalyst used in<br>
this method (2,7-dimethyl-l,8-biphenyldioxy)bis(diallcoxya]uminum) has to be<br>
prepared from trialkylaluminum, which imposes safety concerns on an industrial<br>
scale. Common disadvantages of all Oppenauer type oxidation methods include the<br>
catalyst sensitivity toward hydrolysis, the necessity of use of an auxiliary carbonyl<br>
compound (sometimes a large excess) and a lengthy and labor intensive work-up.<br>
The second of these methods is known as oxidation with a reagent. Above<br>
mentioned Japanese patent JP 50/58031 also describes carveol oxidation to carvone<br>
with chromic trioxide in concentrated sulfuric acid with 93% yield. Among other<br>
reagents suggested for carveol oxidation to carvone are, hydrogen peroxide in the<br>
presence of molybdenum catalyst (Trost, B.M. et al., Israel Journal of Chemistry,<br>
1984, Vol. 24, pp. 134-143); N-methybnorpholine-N-oxide in the presence of<br>
ruthenium catalyst (Sharpless K.B. et al., Tetrahedron Letters, 1976, No. 29, pp.<br>
2503-2506); hydroperoxides in the presence of molybdenum and vanadium catalysts<br>
(Lempers H.E.B. et al., J. Org. Chem., 1998, Vol. 63, pp. 1408-1413); and copper<br>
catalysts (Rothenberg G., J. Chem. Soc, Perkin Trans. 1998, No. 2, pp. 2429-2434).<br>
In most, if not all, of these reactions expensive reagents or toxic catalysts are used and<br>
a large excess of the oxidation reagent is required, which makes a reagent oxidation<br>
very unattractive for commercialization.<br>
The double bond in carvone mat is conjugated with the carbonyl group is<br>
markedly active as hydrogen acceptor. This is why under commonly used<br>
dehydrogenation conditions dihydrocarvone becomes the major product of carveol<br>
dehydrogenation (see, for example, US 4160786 which describes isomerization of<br>
cycloalkenols to cycloalkanones in the presence of copper-chromite catalysts and<br>
specifically mentions carveol conversion to dihydrocarvone). Supported palladium,<br>
platinum and ruthenium catalysts, which are frequently used in dehydrogenation<br>
reaction, afford phenols and cyclohexanones upon dehydrogenation of cycloalkenols<br>
(carveol) or cycloakenones (carvone). Examples of such transformations can be found<br>
in US 4929762 and US 5817891.<br>
In some instances a method called oxidative dehydrogenation is employed to<br>
produce alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl compounds from the corresponding allylic<br>
alcohols. Catalysts utilized in this process include metallic copper or silver. Using this<br>
process geraniol was converted to citral (US 5241122) and prenol to prenal (US<br>
6013843) at the temperature above 360°C. The name of this process - oxidative<br>
dehydrogenation - suggests that this is not a true dehydrogenation, as it requires the<br>
presence of oxygen, which could be either an oxidant or a hydrogen acceptor.<br>
Nonetheless, the oxidative dehydrogenation has never been successfully used to<br>
produce carvone, probably because it proceeds at the temperature above 360°C, which<br>
causes decomposition of carveol and carvone and leads to low yields and poor quality.<br>
In other attempts, some enzymes have been found to affect this kind of<br>
chemical transformation (Hirata, T., et al., Phytochemistry, 2000, vol. 55, No. 4, pp.<br>
297-303). The enzymatic method has mostly a theoretical interest and cannot be used<br>
for a large-scale production of carvone.<br>
In general, homogeneous catalysts are rarely used in dehydrogenation process<br>
(Blum, J., Biger, S. Tetrahedron Letters, 1970, No. 21, pp. 1825-1828). In particular,<br>
in the presence of those homogeneous catalysts that could possibly affect<br>
dehydrogenation of the allylic alcohols the isomerization to saturated carbonyl<br>
compounds but not dehydrogenation to corresponding unsaturated carbonyl<br>
compounds was observed (see review by van der Drift, R.C. et al., J. Organomet.<br>
Chem., 2000, No. 650, pp. 1-24). There are a few examples of the homogeneous<br>
dehydrogenation of alcohols. However, only saturated alcohols were used as<br>
substrates (Fragale, C. et al. J. Molecular Catalysis, 1979, Vol. 5, pp. 65-73).<br>
Interestingly, most of the reported examples were not dehydrogenation, but rather<br>
hydrogen transfer reactions, which involved hydrogen acceptors. Thus, there is no<br>
indication in the patent or scientific literature that carvone or any other conjugated<br>
alpha, beta-unsaturated cyclic ketones can be prepared by catalytic dehydrogenation<br>
of the corresponding allylic alcohol.<br>
Moreover, the homogeneous dehydrogenation catalysts that have been used<br>
are complex compounds of the transition metals chosen from groups six to ten of the<br>
Periodic Table. In contrast, the present invention further provides a method that<br>
utilizes carboxylates of the metals chosen from groups two and twelve of the Periodic<br>
Table. As discussed below, and in accordance with the present invention, these<br>
carboxylates are effective homogeneous dehydrogenation catalysts that allow for<br>
selective production of alpha, beta-unsaturated cyclic ketones from the corresponding<br>
secondary allylic cyclic alcohol via a true dehydrogenation mechanism.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Among other aspects, the present invention is based in part on the surprising<br>
discovery that carboxylates of metals from groups two and twelve of the Periodic<br>
Table can act as selective homogeneous catalysts for the dehydrogenation of a<br>
secondary allylic cyclic alcohol to form an alpha, beta-unsaturated cyclic ketone.<br>
In a first aspect, the present invention provides a process for the manufacture<br>
of an alpha, beta-unsaturated cyclic ketone, comprising the dehydrogenation of a<br>
secondary allylic cyclic alcohol in the presence of at least one metal carboxylate, in a<br>
reaction environment under conditions effective to provide an alpha, beta-unsaturated<br>
cyclic ketone.<br>
In a second aspect, the present invention further provides alpha, beta-<br>
unsaturated cyclic ketones produced by the processes described herein.<br>

the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. Further advantages of<br>
the invention will also be realized and attained by means of the elements and<br>
combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims. Thus, it is to be<br>
understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed<br>
description are exemplary and explanatory of certain embodiments of the invention,<br>
and are therefore not restrictive of the invention as claimed.<br>

particular value and/or to "about" or "approximately" another particular value. When<br>
such a range is expressed, another embodiment comprises from the one particular<br>
value and/or to the other particular value. Similarly, when values are expressed as<br>
approximations, by use of the antecedent "about," it will be understood that the<br>
particular value forms another embodiment.<br>
As used herein, Group II and XXII metals are intended to include those metals<br>
belonging to Groups II and XXII of the Periodic Table.<br>
As used herein, the term "alkyl" refers to a paraffmic hydrocarbon group<br>
which may be derived from an alkane by dropping one hydrogen from the formula.<br>
Non-limiting examples include C1 - C20 alkane derivatives such as methyl, ethyl,<br>
propyl, isopropyl, butyl, t-butyl, and isobutyl. To this end, it should be understood<br>

straight chain alkyl substituent.<br>
As used herein, the term "alkenyl" is intended to refer to a substituent derived<br>
from the class of unsaturated hydrocarbons having one or more double bonds. Those<br>
containing only one double bond are referred to as allcenes or alkenyl substituents.<br>
Those with two or more double bonds are called alkadienes (alkadienyl), alkatrienes<br>
(alkatrienyl) and so on. Non-limiting examples include ethylene, propylene, butylene<br>
and the like. To this end, it should be understood that an alkenyl substituent suitable<br>
for use in the present invention can be substituted or unsubstituted.<br>
As used herein, the term "aryl" refers to a compound or substituent whose<br>
molecules have the ring structure characteristic of benzene, naphthalene,<br>
phenanthrene, anthracene, and the like. That is to say, an aryl group typically<br>

C1 -C5 alkyl groups, C1-C5 alkenyl groups, or C6-C10 aryl groups.<br>
As used herein, by use of the term "effective," "effective amount," or<br>
"conditions effective to" it is meant that such amount or reaction condition is capable<br>
of performing the function of the compound or property for which an effective<br>
amount is expressed. As will be pointed out below, the exact amount required will<br>
vary from one embodiment to another, depending on recognized variables such as the<br>
compounds or materials employed and the processing conditions observed. Thus, it is<br>
not always possible to specify an exact "effective amount" or "condition effective to."<br>
However, it should be understood that an appropriate effective amount will be readily<br>
determined by one of ordinary skill in the art using only routine experimentation.<br>
As used herein, the term "reaction environment" refers to the medium in<br>
which the dehydrogenation reaction takes place. For example, and without limitation,<br>
the reaction environment or reaction medium in which the dehydrogenation reaction<br>
of the present invention takes place can be a secondary allylic cyclic alcohol.<br>
Alternatively, the reaction environment or reaction medium can comprise at least one<br>
optional solvent.<br>
As used herein, the term "optional" or "optionally" means that the<br>
subsequently described event or circumstance may or may not occur, and that the<br>
description includes instances where said event or circumstance occurs and instances<br>
where it does not. For example, the phrase "optionally substituted lower alkyl" means<br>
that the lower allcyl group may or may not be substituted and that the description<br>
includes both unsubstituted lower alkyl and lower alkyl where there is substitution.<br>
As set forth above, in a first aspect the present invention provides a process for<br>
the manufacture of an alpha, beta-unsaturated cyclic ketone, comprising the<br>
dehydrogenation of a secondary allylic cyclic alcohol in the presence of at least one<br>
metal carboxylate, in a reaction environment under conditions effective to provide an<br>
alpha, beta-unsaturated cyclic ketone.<br>
According to the invention, suitable secondary allylic cyclic alcohols include<br>
those alcohols having the general structure of formula (I):<br>
wherein R1 and R2 are independently selected from among straight chain or branched<br>
C1 -C5 allcyl groups, C1- C5 alkenyl groups, or C6-C10 aryl groups. In a preferred<br>
aspect of the invention, the secondary allylic cyclic alcohol is carveol and is<br>
represented by the structure of formula (HI) below:<br>
As stated above, the dehydrogenation process of the present invention<br>
proceeds in the presence of at least one metal carboxylate catalyst. The metal<br>
carboxylate catalysts are carboxylates of the metals selected from Groups II and XXII<br>
of the periodic table, including magnesium, calcium, and zinc. According to one<br>
aspect of the invention, the metal carboxylates comprise a carboxylate moiety having<br>
the general structure: <br>
wherein R3 is selected from among C1-C20 straight chain or branched alkyl groups,<br>
which groups can be further substituted by one or more additional C1-C20 straight<br>
chain or branched alkyl radicals. In one aspect, a preferred carboxylate is stearate.<br>
Alternatively, in another aspect, the carboxylate is an ethylhexanoate or octanoate.<br>
Therefore, in accordance with these aspects, suitable metal carboxylate catalyst for<br>
use in the present invention includes, without limitation, magnesium stearate<br>
(commercially available from the Aldrich company), calcium 2-ethylhexanoate<br>
(commercially available from Shepherd Chemical Company) and zinc 2-<br>
ethylhexanoate (also commercially available from Shepherd Chemical Company).<br>
As described herein, the process of the present invention is useful for the<br>
manufacture of a variety of alpha, beta-unsaturated cyclic ketones having the generic<br>
structure:<br>
wherein R1 and R2 are independently selected from among straight chain or branched<br>
C1 -C5 alkyl groups, C1- C5 alkenyl groups, or C6-C10 aryl groups. To that end, it will<br>
be understood and appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art the particular alpha,<br>
beta-unsaturated cyclic ketone desired to be manufactured will be dependent upon the<br>
starting secondary allylic cyclic alcohol as previously described herein. In one aspect,<br>
the process of the present invention is particularly useful for the preparation of<br>
carvone, an alpha, beta-unsaturated cyclic ketone having the structure as follows.<br><br>
Using appropriate reaction conditions, not only allylic but also some other<br>
alcohols could be converted to the corresponding carbonyl compounds. For example,<br>
dihydrocarveol was converted to dihydrocarvone, although the rate of this reaction<br>
was slower, which indicates that allylic alcohols undergo metal carboxylate catalyzed<br>
dehydrogenation faster than their saturated analogues.<br>
In the presence of metal carboxylates a noticeable rate of carveol<br>
dehydrogenation can be observed at about 210°C. However, to achieve a reasonable<br>
reaction rate the process should be carried out at 215-260°C. At higher temperature<br>
the selectivity of carveol dehydrogenation to carveol starts to decrease.<br>
According to present invention, dehydrogenation of carveol is carried out in<br>
the presence of metal carboxylate at elevated temperature under atmospheric or<br>
reduced pressure as a batch or semi-continuous process with an optional addition of a<br>
solvent.<br>
To this end, optimization of the process, as described herein, would be<br>
possible using only routine experimentation. For example, by controlling the residual<br>
pressure (e.g., vacuum), the reaction mixture can be refluxed at the desired<br>
temperature in the system. In addition, the choice of a desired temperature and<br>
residual pressure combination can control the carveol concentration in the system and,<br>
thus, the contact time between the catalyst and carveol. And, finally, this combination<br>
of parameters, e.g., pressure, carveol concentration, and contact time, can be used to<br>
select a feed rate of, e.g., carveol or carveol containing mixture to the system.<br>
The reaction does not require a solvent, though addition of solvent can be<br>
beneficial in achieving high yields in a batch mode or for improving heat transfer and<br>
lowering the viscosity in a semi-continuous mode. Examples of solvents include but<br>
are not limited to high boiling individual hydrocarbons and their mixtures<br>
(pentadecane, white mineral oils, etc.), ethers (diphenyl ether, tetraethylene glycol<br>
dimethyl ether, etc.) or mixtures of hydrocarbons and ethers. The amount of solvent<br>
may vary from 10% to 200% based on starting carveol. Even larger amount of solvent<br>
can be employed. However, it would lead to less effective equipment utilization.<br>
the process of the present invention as described herein can be successfully<br>
performed on virtually any scale.<br>
The amount of catalyst can be expressed in terms of the starting secondary<br>
alcohol or the total reaction mixture. For example, the amount of the carboxylate can<br>
vary from about 0.5% by weight or less to about 100% by weight or more relative to<br>
the secondary alcohol. For example, specific examples of suitable amounts can<br>
include 1, 5,10,20,30,40,50,60,70, 80 and 90 % by weight and ranges<br>
therebetween.<br>
Moreover, the amount of metal carboxylate catalyst is selected to provide the<br>
desired reaction rate and can vary depending on the reaction technique employed. For<br>
example, where the process is carried out in a batchwise mode, the carboxylate can be<br>
present in an amount of about 1% to about 4% by weight based on the starting<br>
secondary alcohol or about 0.5% to about 2 wt % based on the total reaction mixture.<br>
For processes carried out in the continuous mode, the metal carboxylate can be<br>
present in the system, based on throughput, of about 0.01 to about 1 g of secondary<br>
alcohol per 1 g of catalyst per hour.<br>
To carry out a batch dehydrogenation carveol or carveol containing streams<br>
are mixed with catalyst and possibly a solvent in any sequence. Then the resulting<br>
mixture is heated at desired temperature. It is advisable, although not required, to<br>
remove any water contained in the optional solvent or in the feed by distillation<br>
(possibly adding an azeotrope forming agent) prior to catalyst addition in order to<br>
protect the catalyst from hydrolysis. Various hydrocarbons with appropriate boiling<br>
points can serve as azeotrope forming agents. Dehydrogenation can be carried out at<br>
reflux temperature, atmospheric pressure or under vacuum. The reflux temperature<br>
can be controlled by addition of one or more solvents or by adjusting pressure.<br>
To carry out a semi-continuous process, a mixture of catalyst and solvent can<br>
be heated at the desired temperature (typically 220-250°C) and pressure (typically 10-<br>
100 mm Hg) in the still pot of a distillation column efficient enough to separate<br>
carvone from carveol. Then carveol or carveol containing stream is continuously<br>
added through the still pot at a specified rate. As carvone has a lower boiling point, it<br>
is continuously removed from the top of distillation column, while carveol remains in<br>
the pot. Addition of carveol and removal of carvone are continued until the catalyst<br>
loses its activity (typically 96-120 hours). Semi-continuous process affords better<br>
yield of carvone comparing with batch process because the product is removed from<br>
the reaction zone as soon as it is formed thus preventing formation of by-products.<br>
At high temperatures in the presence of catalyst, it is possible that the desired<br>
alpha, beta-unsaturated cyclic ketone will exists in equilibrium with its unconjugated<br>
isomer, a beta, gamma-unsaturated cyclic ketone, as illustrated below.<br><br>
In instances where the unconjugated beta, gamma-unsaturated isomer has a<br>
lower boiling point than the target conjugated alpha, beta-unsaturated cyclic ketone,<br>
the beta, gamma-unsaturated cyclic ketone would be removed first during reflux<br>
conditions. For this reason, a product of a semi-continuous dehydrogenation of a<br>
suitable secondary allylic alcohol may contain a noticeable amount of the beta,<br>
gamma-unsaturated cyclic ketone in addition to the target alpha, beta-unsaturated<br>
cyclic ketone. For example, spicatone, the unconjugated beta, gamma-unsaturated<br>
isomer of carvone, has a lower boiling point than carvone and under reflux conditions<br>
is removed first. For this reason, a product of a semi-continuous dehydrogenation of<br>
carveol can contain a noticeable amount of spicatone, an amount typically in the range<br>
of from about 4 to about 8%.<br>
A beta, gamma-unsaturated cyclic ketone, such as spicatone, can be<br>
isomerized back to the target alpha, beta-unsaturated cyclic ketone by heating the<br>
product of the dehydrogenation reaction to a temperature above 200°C or by treating<br>
the product of the dehydrogenation reaction with a sodium hydroxide solution at or<br>
above 80°C in a batch process. For example, according to the process of the present<br>
invention, the preparation of carvone from carveol can provide a minimum undesired<br>
amount of spicatone, the unconjugated alpha, gamma-unsaturated cyclic ketone<br>
isomer of carvone. By heating the product of dehydrogenation at above 200°C or by<br>
treating with a sodium hydroxide solution at above 80oC in a batch process, the<br>
spicatone can therefore be isomerized back to provide a higher yield of the desired<br>
product.<br>
After the spicatone isomerization step, semi-continuous dehydrogenation of<br>
carveol affords 97% weight yield of 95% pure carvone (the rest 5% is mostly<br>
dihydrocarvone, which by itself is a valuable component of the spearmint oil). Further<br>
fractionation affords 99.6% pure (or higher) fragrance and flavor quality carvone with<br>
90% yield based on starting carveol.<br>
It will further be appreciated upon practicing the process of the present<br>
invention that the dehydrogenation process described herein does not alter the optical<br>
activity of starting secondary allylic cyclic alcohol. Therefore, a levorotatory<br>
secondary allylic cyclic alcohol, such as 1-carveol, can be successfully converted to a<br>
levorotatory alpha, beta-unsaturated cyclic ketone, such as 1-carvone. Likewise, the<br>
same holds true if the dextrorotatory alpha, beta-unsaturated cyclic ketone is the<br>
desired product. Thus, the present invention offers a convenient, practical, selective,<br>
relatively inexpensive and environmentally friendly process for the preparation of<br>
pure optical isomers of alpha, beta-unsaturated cyclic ketones, when they possess an<br>
asymmetric center.<br>

225°C. Water was removed using a Dean-Stark trap. The reaction mixture was<br>
periodically sampled for GC analysis. After 6 hours the reaction mixture contained<br>
82% carvone and 3% carveol (97% conversion, 84% selectivity).<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
Semi-continuous dehydrogenation of I-carveoI. A mixture of 450 g mineral<br>
oil and 200 g zinc octoate (22% zinc) was heated in a 2-liter pot of a distillation<br>
column (25 theory plates) to 240°C at 50 mm Hg. Then 7080 g of 1-carveol containing<br>
mixture (10.5% 1-carvone and 72.5% 1-carveol) was added through the pot at a rate of<br>
60 g/h over 118 hours. The reflux ratio and the product take-off rate were adjusted in<br>
such a way so as to maintain pot temperature at 240-250°C and the residual carveol<br>
content in the product (distillate) below 3.5%. Total 6800 g of product of<br>
dehydrogenation was collected. It contained 4.1% spicatone, 74.3% carvone, and<br>
3.2% carveol (carveol conversion was 95.7%, and selectivity to carvone plus<br>
spicatone was 93%).<br>
Isomerization of spicatone to carvone. The product of dehydrogenation was<br>
