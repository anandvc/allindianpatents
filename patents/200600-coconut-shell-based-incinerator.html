The present invention in general relates to incinerators for effective disposal of non-metallic garbage. More particularly this invention relates to a novel coconut based incinerator comprising of a specially designed airline system which enables the efficient combustion of garbage with maximum fuel efficiency.<br>
Prior art and Objects of the Invention<br>
Incinerators generally are an ideal unit for use in Panchayats, Municipalities, Multistoned flat. Hostels, Hotel, Hospitals and Parks etc for the disposal of garbage. The high population explosion and overcrowding in towns and metropolises has led to the general headache of waste disposal. Existing incinerators are basically electricity, firewood and oil fijel based. These incinerators are capital intensive and incur substantial operational cost on account of the high fiiel prices. The fuel efficiency in these incinerators is verj' low because of low combustion ratio and heat spread.<br>
It is in this context that a new coconut shell based incinerator has been designed wherein a unique airUne system has been mooted to rotate the fire inside so as to ensure full combustion and maximum fuel efficiency. Operation cost of this Incinerator is substantially lower than other Incinerators. The fuel, coconut shell used in the said Incinerator is economically low cost and commonly available. The equipment is also very compact, maintenance free and can be operated by skilled or unskilled labours. This novel incinerator lias been designed and developed to bum wet and dry waste materials to ashes by using Coconut shells, being one among the waste materials. A specially designed airline system with pipes fixed spirally at 8 degree slant to the vertical and grate bars with baffles is also implemented inside the unit so as to simultaneously rotate the fire inside and zigzag the flue gas generated inside the incinerator so as to derive maximum combustion in a fuel efficient manner.<br>
Advantages of the Invention<br>
This coconut shell based incinerator enables to dispose off organic wastes in economic and non- polluting manner. The unique airline system incorporated into the incinerator ensures efficient combustion ration in a fuel efficient manner and conscquentiy the waste burns out fully with minimum fuel consumption. It works by using coconut shell as fuel instead of costly fuels like oil and electricit)^ and hence the operation cost is very low in comparison with existing incinerators. It does not create noise, foul smell or waste water. Another advantage of this type of incinerator is that the operation of it does not require the help of skilled labour.<br><br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The Coconut Shell Based Incinerator is a chamber with a chimney of 100 feet height. The unit comprises of feed doors, firing chamber, ash pit, maintenance doors, air holes, chimney and ash pit. The Incinerator is made up of thick M. S. Outer shell, internally lined with qualit)' fire bricks and fire cement. The chamber is fully insulated with fire insulation to prevent heat coming to the outer shell. Fully airtight doors are provided for the said insulator.<br>
Suitable number of fire grate bars, i.e., a slanted ftiel feeding grate, slanted combustion grate and the tiring grate is provided inside the unit according to the capacity of the incinerator. The baffles fixed on to the front end of the fuel feeding grate and combustion grate direct the flow of flue gas in a zigzag manner so that the draft is prolonged and heat spread and maintained within the unit ensuring complete combustion of the wastes fed. Further, air intakes pipes are fixed spirally at 8 degree slant position to the vertical to twist the incoming air in a circular motion. This accelerates the movement of air in circular morion upwards thereby increasing the quantum of air intake and the draft inside. This facilitates the contact of air and oxygen with the waste products in the incinerator, resulting in efficient and complete combustion. The spiraHty effect also prolongs the heat energy generated inside the chamber with wider coverage of the aJr column in the incinerator. This enables the maintenance of high temperature in the combustion area in a stable manner, and enables rapid and complete burning of the wastes.<br>
The waste fed from top, will initially get dried in the flue gas and subsequentiy burnt into ashes. The Incinerator is fired wdth coconut shells according to design. The negEgible discharge of smoke is safely sent through the chimney provided with canopy. The maintenance holes provided facilitate the internal cleiming and easy removal of any chocking materials. When the Incinerator is fired with coconut shells the temperamre will raise to the range of 850 to UOO C. Thus all wastes arc disposed into ashes in the high temperamre.<br>

I'he above and other features of the invention with details of construction will now be more particularly described with reference to the accompanying drawings. It will be understood that the particular invention is shown by way of illustration only and not a Hmitation of the invention. The principle and features of this invention may be employed in various and numerous embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention.<br>
Functional Descriprion of the incinerator.<br>
In the drawings-.<br>
Fig. No. 1 depicts the outer view of the incinerator. The incinerator is seated on a leg made up of MS Channel (14). The chimney (1) is provided on top affixed to the conical MS Top (6). The fuel feed door (4) for loading of coconut shells and the inspection door (3) to inspect and remove any choking materials inside the incinerator are also shown.<br>
Fig. No. 2 depicts the vertical cross sectional view of the incinerator. The<br>
air enters the incinerator through holes (13) and is made to pass through pipes designed and spirally fixed at 8 degree to the vertical (10) to the ignited fuel chamber. Here the air rotates up in between the grate bars (9, 8 &amp; 7). I'he baffles bolted on to the front end of the slanted grate bars (8) &amp; (7) direct the flow of the emanating flue gas in a zigzag manner before discharging the same through the chimney. Thus the incoming air is simultaneously made to move spirally as well as in zigzag manner inside the incinerator. I'his increases the mrbulencc and prolongs the draft within the incinerator thus prolonging and maintaining the temperamre inside so as to derive maximum combustion efficiency.<br><br>
Fig. No. 3 depicts the cross - sectional view of the incinerator at (c - d as shown in Fig 1.) showing the grate bar (7) with baffle plates designed to regulate the air flow in a zigxag manner. The baffle plates arc fixed onto the front end of the grate bar set.<br>
Fig. No. 4 depicts the cross - sectional view of the incinerator (e - f as shown in Fig 2.) showing the spirally fixed pipes at 8 degree slant to the vertical. They are provided at the bottom of the incinerator next to the fuel feeding door. These pipes twists the air passed thought it to the combustion chamber.<br>
Fig. No. 5 depicts the sectional view of Grate bar (7) &amp; (8) with baffles.<br>
Fig. No. 6 depicts the sectional view of Grate bar (9) without baffles. Partially burnt materials are piled up in this grate bar so as to avoid any choking of the system.<br>
Fig. No. 7 depicts the sectional view of the Feed Doors (4 &amp; 5) used for feeding garbage and fiacl. The doors are lined with refractor^' bricks inside.<br>
Fig. No. 8 depicts the sectional front view and top view of the Fuel Feeding Grate upon which refractory bricks are filled to avoid corrosion of the pipes fixed spirally at 8 degree slant to the vertical.<br>
Fig. No. 9 depicts an isometric view of the incinerator.<br>
Referring to the Drawing it will be seen that the illustrated Coconut Shell Based Incinerator is made up of M.S. Sheet body (2) and pyramid shaped top (6), lined with refractory bricks (11) inside the shell. Garbage Feed tray (18) and door (5) is provided to convenicndy feed all types of wastes. The Slant Grate bars (?) and (8) are provided to control the feed and to pre-drv' the wet waste in the Flue gas, before reaching the bottom Grate Bar (9) where the actual burning take place. A fuel firing grate (10) and Fuel Feed Door (4) is provided. Coconut shell is used as fuel and no electricity,' or petroleum fuel is required. The ash is collected and removed through ash pit and door (12). The body is seated on the brick basement (15) and corner M.S. Channels (14). Necessary air holes (13) are provided in the brick basement to facilitate natural draft. A chimney with canopy (1) is provided I'or emission of smoke and draft. The inspection door (3) is provided to remove chocking if any.<br><br><br>
