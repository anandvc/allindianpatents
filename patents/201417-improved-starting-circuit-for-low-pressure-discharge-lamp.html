Improved starting circuit for low-pressure discharge lamp<br>
The present invention relates to an operating circuit for a low-pressure discharge lamp. It specifically . concerns the behaviour of a low-pressure discharge lamp immediately after ignition of the discharge in a starting phase, and also a starting circuit matched to this behaviour.<br>
A particular known feature of low-pressure discharge lamps containing Hg is that the luminous flux produced ' in the discharge is highly dependent on the temperature of the lamp. For the user, this means that, after it is switched on, the lamp provides a noticeably lower luminous flux for a certain time than when it is being operated continuously. This starting behaviour is naturally irritating; however, in the field of lamps containing Hg, it has not been possible to remedy this to date with measures concerning the physics of the lamp itself.<br>
One feasible way is illustrated in German Patent Specification 195 46 588.1. In this document, the difficulty described with the starting behaviour of a low-pressure discharge lamp containing Hg has been tackled by increasing the lamp-current nominal value of a control IC that regulates the lamp current in operation during the starting phase. For further details, you are referred to the document.<br>
In practice, various difficulties have arisen with such operating circuits. In particular, increased numbers of failures have been found.<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
The invention is thus based on the technical problem of further developing an operating circuit according to the precharacterising clause of Claim 1 in terms of improved    reliability    and    improved    operating<br>
characteristics.<br>
The invention solves this problem by means of a circuit for operating a low-pressure discharge lamp with a starting circuit for controlling the lamp current during a starting phase, characterized in that the starting circuit has a sensor device for a variable which is dependent on the luminous flux or the temperature of the lamp, and controls the lamp current depending on the luminous flux or the temperature of the lamp.<br>
Although the cited document concerns compensation for excessively low luminous flux when operation starts by increasing the lamp current, the present invention is not to be understood as being restricted to this specific case. Instead, as described in the precharacterizing clause of Claim 1, it is based generally on controlling the lamp current in a starting phase of a low-pressure discharge lamp.<br>
The invention thus provides for the lamp current to be controlled in the starting phase depending on a measured parameter characterizing the operating state of the lamp. An operating state that differs from the continuous operating state and in fact characterizes the starting phase is then intended to cause the lamp current to be controlled, the result of which is a lamp luminous flux at least approximating the luminous flux in the continuous operating state. Specifically, the operating state can be detected in the starting phase by a lamp temperature which differs from the continuous operating temperature of the lamp or by a luminous flux which does not correspond to the desired continuous luminous   flux.   Particularly  with  the   starting<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
behaviour, described above, of low-pressure discharge lamps containing Hg, an excessively low lamp temperature causes an excessively low luminous flux, which can be compensated for by increasing the lamp current in the starting phase.<br>
However, the present invention - according to the characterizing part of Claim 1 - departs from the concept of the document cited above in that control of the lamp current is dependent on a measured parameter which represents the luminous flux or the lamp temperature. Specifically, in the prior art described, a time period which, although it can be set when the circuit is designed, is then permanently predefined, is used for increasing the lamp current in a manner which is equally permanently predefined. In this case, although the increased lamp current is raised with a continuous ramp and is reduced at the end of the predefined time, the whole pattern of times for increasing, maintaining and reducing the increased lamp current and for the extent of the increase in terms of current level is permanent and invariable for individual cases, irrespective of the actual operating state of the lamp.<br>
According to the invention, it has been found that this "inflexible" control of the lamp current does not merely result in relatively poor matching of the luminous flux in the starting phase. Above all, the inflexibly predefined lamp current increase whenever the lamp is started can cause the lamp or the operating circuit to be damaged. For example, when a low-pressure discharge lamp containing Hg is restarted after a short interruption in operation, the lamp is still warm from operation. Increasing the lamp current can then increase the operating temperature above the nominal temperature for continuous operation, so that the luminous flux of the lamp is reduced again on account of the excessive Hg vapour pressure.  The result is<br><br><br><br><br>
- 4 -<br>
that, for this case, the starting circuit achieves the exact opposite of the desired result. In addition, the increased temperature accelerates the deterioration and thus the probability of failure of the lamp and the electronic components in its immediate surroundings. A similar line of reasoning also applies to the rising temperature, caused by the increased lamp current, of the operating circuit even if it is not arranged immediately next to the lamp.<br>
If, owing to particular circumstances, the lamp or the operating circuit has already overheated before restart, the lamp current increase which nevertheless takes place can result in destruction. This risk is also present if the lamp is repeatedly switched on and off for brief periods even if the surrounding conditions are otherwise normal.<br>
The invention instead makes control of the lamp current  end, in the example given, the lamp current increase dependent on the (measured parameter characterizing the operating state of the lamp. Accordingly, the lamp current control can then be controlled on the basis of duration, relative increase or reduction or on the basis of sign as well as activation or deactivation. It is helpful to use one or more measured parameters which, directly or indirectly, characterize either the luminous flux of the lamp or the lamp temperature.<br>
In a preferred refinement, a temperature sensor is provided which does not measure the lamp temperature directly but measures a temperature which depends on the lamp temperature.This concerns, by way of example, measurement points in the lamp base and/or in the operating circuit or at other points which are thermally coupled to the lamp. In a specific case, such<br>
a temparature sensor is designed to be integrated with<br>
	â€”^^<br>
a control IC/for the operating circuit. Control ICs are<br><br>
preferred in this invention because the possibility<br><br>
-    5-<br>
exists for combination with a regulating circuit in the operating circuit. The starting circuit and the sensor device, I.e. the temperature sensor, can then also be integrated in the IC.<br>
In addition, a photodetector may also be used which measures the luminous flux of the lamp, in this instance, detection of the luminous flux by means of the photodetector, at least in discharge lamps containing Hg, should preferably take place in addition to the temperature being detected. Otherwise, an overheating operating state cannot reliably be distinguished from a cold start because the luminous flux decreases with an increased Hg vapour pressure in exactly the same way as with excessively low Hg vapour pressure.<br>
instead of the lamp luminous flux, the running voltage of the lamp can also be measured in the operating circuit. In discharge lamps containing Hg, the same applies here as for the dependency of the luminous flux on the lamp temperature.<br>
in a simple and effective variant of the invention, the lamp current can be controlled by varying the time period for a lamp current Increase or reduction. In the more complex case, this takes place together with variation of the extent of the current strength, but happens exclusively in the simplest case. The starting circuit controls the lamp current by varying the duration of the starting phase and duration is varied by varying the counting range of the Input of clock pulses from a clock-signal generator (TG) into a counter (Z). Deactivation can be achieved by setting the time period to zero or very much shortening it. In this case, preferred embodiments for the necessary timer circuit on the one hand, are a combination of a clock-signal generator and a counter with possible variation of the clock frequency or of the final counter reading of the counter, the said reading determining the time. The range of the clock input to the counter can also be varied, so that the counter accordingly counts at a higher point and thus reaches a value defining a ....<br><br>
â€” 6 â€”<br>
time period earlier. On the other hand, a combination comprising an RC element and a comparator is feasible, the time constant of the RC element and the threshold of the comparator again being variable.<br>
A further refinement of the invention relates to the temperature detection already mentioned above. Particularly if there is insufficient thermal coupling between the lamp and the measurement point, which, for technical reasons, may possibly desirably be outside the lamp, the measurement point can be arranged on a - component which produces heat independently of the lamp during lamp operation. This component may be, for example, part of the control IC mentioned or the entire<br><br>
IC. However, power transistors for an oscillator and similar heat-producing components are also feasible,<br>
for example.<br><br>
In the following text, a specific exemplary embodiment is described with reference to the accompanying figures, and the individual features of the exemplary embodiment may also be essential to the invention in different combinations or individually.<br>
For the sake of simplicity, this exemplary embodiment is based on the circuit described in the cited document DE 195 46 588.1. Hence, reference is made to this document with regard to the basic manner of operation, control of the lamp current in particular, and the design of the operating circuit and the control IC. The corresponding disclosure is incorporated here by way of reference.<br>
In this case, the figure corresponds to Figure 2 of the cited application and shows a functional block diagram of a control IC which has been expanded, according to the present invention, in comparison with the cited Figure 2 of the prior application.<br><br>
-    7-<br>
A new block TM for a temperature sensor has been inserted into the block diagram and detects the temperature of the silicon tC shown. The block TM Is connected by means of a new input ZE4 to the counter 2, which is already known from the cited application. Both blocks are situated in the top left-hand corner of the figure.<br>
For actually designing such a temperature sensor, various options are known to a person skilled in the art. In particular, highly temperature-dependent electrical variables (e.g. leakage currents or diode forward voltages) can be compared with temperature-compensated reference variables. Specific examples of appropriate practical transistor circuits are illustrated, for example, in "Halbleiter-schaltungstechnlk [Semiconductor Circuitry]" by U. Tletze, Ch. Schenk, 9th edition, Springer, section 26.1.5 (transistor as temperature sensor), page 897-901.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment shown, the temperature sensor TM compares the measured value with a reference value in order to determine a digital signal whose two possible values (1 or 0) represent an IC temperature above or below the reference variable. Thfs digital signal is input into the input 2E4 of the counter 2.<br>
The counter 2 reacts to the value of the signal from the temperature sensor TM by the clock pulses, predefined by the clock-signal generator TG already known from the prior application, for counting up the counter Z occurs at a different position (in terms of a multi-digit binary number) or with a different range. The clock pulses are thus not transferred to the least significant element but to an element which is more significant by a predetermined factor.<br>
The starting phase and duration is varied by varying the counting range of the input of clock pulses from a clock-signal generator (TG) into a counter (Z).<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
 The counter Z can comprise, for example, a chain of a number of flipflops (e.g. 22) whose output frequency halves the input frequency in each case.Inputting the clock pulses at the thirteenth flipflop, for example, instead of the first flipflop, effectively shortens the<br>
time by a factor of 212 until a specific counter reading is reached.<br>
However, this shortening of the time affects only the times linked to the starting phase and not the length of time for the preheating and ignition phase. To refer to Figure 4a of the cited application, the length of<br>
 time TV for the preheating phase and TZ for the ignition phase thus remains unchanged until ignition is<br>
detected.  Preheating  is  fundamentally necessary and<br>
largely   independent   of   the   general   operating<br>
temperature of the lamp.<br>
In the circuit shown in the appended figure, this means that the counting properties of the counter Z are varied by the signal from the temperature sensor TM via the input ZE4 only if the ignition detector ZE "has informed" the counter, via the input ZE3, that the preheating and ignition process has now ended.<br>
The essential advantage of the solution according to the invention is that the rest of the circuit remains completely unchanged from a technical point of view, and so the other conventional nominal value stages {illustrated in Figure 4a of the cited application) are run through so quickly that the starting phase is practically dispensed with.<br>
Reference is additionally made to the description of the cited prior application.<br><br>
