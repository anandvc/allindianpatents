				<td>LAUNDRY DETERGENT COMPOSITIONS<br>
AND METIIODS-FOR. PROVIDING <br>
SOIL RELEASE TO COTTOK FABRIC<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to laundry detergent compositions that provide<br>
soil release benefits to all fabric comprising modified polyamine cotton soil release<br>
agents and non-cotton soil release agents. The present invention also relates to a<br>
method for providing soil release benefits to cotton fabric by contacting cotton<br>
articles with a water soluble and/or dispersible, modified polyamine having<br>
functionalized backbone moieties and improved stability toward bleach. The present<br>
invention further relates to providing soil release benefits to all fabric in the laundry<br>
wash load in the presence of a bleaching agent.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION,<br>
A wide variety of soil release agents for use in domestic and industrial fabric<br>
treatment processes such as laundering, fabric drying in hot air clothes dryers, and<br>
the like are known in the art. Various soil release agents have been commercialized<br>
and are currently usexi in detergent compositions and fabric softener/antistatic articles<br>
and compositions. Such soil release polymers typically comprise an oligomeric or<br>
polymeric ester "backbone".<br>
Soil release polymers are generally very effective on polyester or other<br>
synthetic fabrics where the grease, oil or similar hydrophobic stains spread out and<br>
form a attached film and thereby are not easily removed in an aqueous laundering<br>
process. Many soil release polymers have a less dramatic effect on "blended" fabrics,<br>
that is on fabrics that comprise a mixture of cotton and synthetic material, and have<br>
little or no effect on cotton articles. The reason for the affinity of many soil release<br>
agents for synthetic fabric is that the backbone of a polyester soil release polymer<br>
typically comprises a mixture of terephthalate residues and ethyleneoxy or<br>
propyleneoxy polymeric units; the same materials that comprise the polyester fibers<br>
of synthetic fabric. This similar structure of soil release agents and synthetic fabric<br>
produce an intrinsic affinity between these compounds.<br>
Extensive research in this area has yielded significant improvements in the<br>
effectiveness of polyester soil release agents yielding materials with enhanced product<br>
performance and formulatability. Modifications of the polymer backbone as well as<br>
the selection of proper end-capping groups has produced a wide variety of polyester<br>
soil release polymers, For example, end-cap modifications, such as the use of<br>
sulfoaryl moieties and especially the tow cost isethionate-derived end-capping units,<br>
have increased the range of solubility and adjunct ingredient compatibility of these<br>
polymers without sacrifice to soil release effectiveness. Many polyester soil release<br>
polymers can now be formulated into both liquid as well as solid (i.e., granular)<br>
detergent!<br>
As in the case of polyester soil release agents, producing an oligomeric or<br>
polymeric material that mimics the structure of cotton has not resulted in a cotton<br>
soil release polymer. Although cotton and polyester fabric are both comprised of<br>
long chain polymeric materials, they are chemically very different, Cotton is<br>
comprised of cellulose fibers that consist of anhydroglucose units joined by 1-4<br>
linkages. These glycosidic linkages characterize the cotton cellulose as a<br>
polysaccharide whereas polyester soil release polymers are generally a combination<br>
of terephthalate and ethylene/propylene oxide residues. These differences in<br>
composition account for the difference in the fabric properties of cotton versus<br>
polyester fabric, Cotton is hydrophilic relative to polyester. Polyester is hydrophobic<br>
and attracts oily or greasy dirt and can easily be "dry cleaned". Importantly, the<br>
terephthalate and ethyleneoxy/propyleneoxy backbone of polyester fabric does not<br>
contain reactive sites, such as the hydroxyl moieties of cotton, that react with stains<br>
in different manner than synthetics. Many cotton stains become "fixed" and can only<br>
be resolved by bleaching the fabric.<br>
Until now the development of an effective cotton soil release agent for use in<br>
a laundry detergent has been elusive. Attempts by others to apply the paradigm of<br>
matching the structure of a soil release polymer with the structure of the fabric, a<br>
method successful in the polyester soil release polymer field, has nevertheless yielded<br>
marginal results when applied to cotton fabric soil release agents. The use of<br>
methylcellulose, a cotton polysaccharide with modified oligomeric units, proved to be<br>
more effective on polyesters than on cotton.<br>
For example, U.K. 1,314,897, published April 26,1973 teaches a<br>
hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose material for the prevention of wet-soil redeposition<br>
and improving stain release on laundered fabric. While this material appears to be<br>
somewhat effective on polyester and blended fabrics, the disclosure indicates these<br>
materiale to be unsatisfactory at producing the desired results on cotton fabric.<br>
Other attempts to produce a soil release agent for cotton fabric have usually<br>
taken the form of permanently modifying the chemical structure of the cotton fibers<br>
themselves by reacting a substrate with the polysaccharide polymer backbone. For<br>
example, U. S Patent No. 3,897,026 issued to Kearney, discloses cellulosic textile<br>
materials having improved soil release and stain resistance properties obtained by<br>
reaction of an ethylene-maleic anhydride co-polymer with the hydroxyl moieties of<br>
the cotton polymers One perceived drawback of this method is the desirable<br>
hydrophilic properties of the cotton fabric are substantially modified by this process.<br>
Non-permanent soil release treatments or finishes have also been previously<br>
attempted, U.S. Patent No. 3,912,681 issued to Dickson teaches a composition for<br>
applying a non-permanent soil release finish comprising a polycarboxylate polymer to<br>
a cotton fabric However, this material must be applied at a pH less than 3, a process<br>
not suitable for consumer use nor compatible with laundry detergents which typically<br>
have a pH greater than 85.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 3,948,838 issued to Hinton, et alia describes high molecular<br>
weight (500,000 to 1,500,000) polyacrylic polymers for soil release. These materials<br>
are used prefenbly with other fabric treatments, for example, durable press textile<br>
reactants such as formaldehyde. This process is also not readily applicable for use by<br>
consumers in a typical washing machine.<br>
U.S. Patent 4,559,056 issued to Leigh, et alla discloses a process for treating<br>
cotton or synthetic fabrics with a composition comprising an organopolysiloxano<br>
elastomer, an organosiloxaneoxyalkylene copolymer crosslinking agent and a<br>
siloxane curing catalyst. Organosilicone oligomers are well known by those skilled in<br>
the art as suds supressors<br>
Other soil release agents not comprising terephthalate and mixtures of<br>
poiyoxy ethylene/propylene are vinyl caprolactam resins as disclosed by Rupert, et<br>
alla U.S. Patent Nos. 4,579,681 and 4,614,519. These disclosed vinyl<br>
caprolactam materials have their effectiveness limited to polyester fabrics, blends of<br>
cotton and polyester, and cotton fabrics rendered hydrophobic by finishing agents.<br>
Examples of alkoxylated polyamines and quatemized alkoxylated polyamines<br>
are disclosed in European Patent Application 206,513 as being suitable for use as soil<br>
dispersents, however their possible use as a cotton soil release agent is not disclosed.<br>
In addition, these materials do not comprise N-oxides, a key modification made to<br>
the poryamines of the present invention and a component of the increased bleach<br>
stability exhibited by the presently disclosed compounds.<br>
It has now been surprisingly discovered that effective soil release agenls for<br>
cotton articles can be prepared from certain modified polyamines. This unexpected<br>
result has yielded compositions that are key to the present method for providing soil<br>
release benefits once available to only synthetic and synthetic-cotton blended fabric.<br>
The process or method of the present invention provides for soil release<br>
benefits on all cotton articles whether laundered in the presence of a bleaching agent<br>
or not. The process or method of the present invention provides for soil release<br>
benefits to all fabric in the laundry wash load, as opposed to previous methods that<br>
only provided soil release protection to synthetic and cotton-synthetic blended fabric.<br>
The present process, because of the stability of the modified polyamines disclosed<br>
herein toward bleaching agents, now provides this soil release to white cotton articles<br>
which the consumer may choose to launder in the presence of traditional bleaching<br>
agents.<br>
The process or method of the present invention is equally effective when the<br>
laundry detergent compositions disclosed herein are solid or liquid, The solid laundry<br>
detergents may be in the form of granules, flakes or laundry bars. The liquid<br>
detergents can have a wide range of viscosity and may include heavy concentrates,<br>
pourable "ready" detergents, or light duty fabric pre-treatmcnts.<br>
The modified polyamines disclosed in the present method are especially<br>
compatible with other laundry detergent additives and adjuncts.<br>

Preferred SRA's typically have hydrophilic segments to hydrophilize the surface<br>
of hydrophobic fibers such as polyester and nylon, and hydrophobic segments to<br>
deposit upon hydrophobic fibers and remain adhered thereto through completion of<br>
wiahing and rinsing cycles, thereby serving as an anchor for the hydrophilic<br>
segment*. This can enable stains occurring subsequent to treatment with the SRA to<br>
be more easily cleaned in later washing procedures.<br>

Any other anionic non-cotton soil release agent is suitable for u« in the<br>
compositions of the present invention alone or in combination, except for carboxymethylcellulose<br>
(CMC) which according to the present invention when used alone is<br>
used at a level above 02%, and preferably above 0.5%, Preferably, CMC is used at a<br>
level of from about 1% to about 10%, preferably from about 1% to about 6%, more<br>
preferably about 5%,<br>
Cotton Soil<br>
The cotton soil release agents of the present invention are water-soluble or<br>
dispersible, modified polyamines. These polyamines comprise backbones that can be<br>
either linear or cyclic. The polyamine backbones can also comprise polyamino<br>
branching chains to a greater or lesser degree, In general, the polyamine backbones<br>
described herein are modified in such a manner that each nitrogen of the polyamine<br>
chain is thereafter described in terms of a unit that is substituted, quatemired,<br>
oxidized, or combinations thereof.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention the term "modification* is defined<br>
u replacing &amp; backbone -NH hydrogen atom by an E unit (substitution), quaternizing<br>
a backbone nitrogen (quatemued) or oxidizing a backbone nitrogen to the N'-oxide<br>
(oxidized). The terms "modification" and "substitution" are used interchangably<br>
when referring to the process of replacing a hydrogen atom attached to a backbone<br>
nitrogen with an E unit. Quatemization or oxidation may take place in some<br>
circumstance* without substitution, but preferably substitution is accompanied by<br>
oxidation or quaternization of at least one backbone nitrogen.<br>
The linear or non-cyclic polyamine backbones that comprise the cotton soil<br>
release Agents of the present invention have the general formula:<br>
said backbones prior to subsequent modification, comprise primary, secondary and<br>
tertiary amine nitrogens connected by R 'linking" units. The cyclic pcfyimine<br>
backbones comprising the cotton soil release agents of the present invention have the<br>
general formula:<br>
H R<br>
said backbones prior to subsequent modification, comprise primary, secondary find<br>
tertiary amine nitrogens connected by R "linking" units<br>
For the purpose of the present invention, primary amine nitrogens comprising<br>
the backbone or branching chain once modified are defined as V or Z "terminal"<br>
units. For example, when a primary amine moiety, located at the end of the main<br>
poiyamine backbone or branching chain having the structure<br>
H2N-R].<br>
is modified according to the present invention, it is thereafter defined as a <br>
"terminal" unit, or simply a V unit. However, for the purposes of the present<br>
invention, some or ail of the primary amine moieties can remain unmodified subject<br>
to the restrictions further described herein below. These unmodified primary annine<br>
moieties by virtue of their position in the backbone chain remain "terminal" units.<br>
Likewise, when a primary amine moiety, located at the end of the main polyamine<br>
backbone having the structure<br>
-NH2<br>
is modified according to the present invention, it is thereafter defined as a Z<br>
"terminal" unit, or simply a Z unit. This unit can remain unmodified subject to the<br>
restrictions further described herein below.<br>
In • similar manner, secondary amine nitrogens comprising the backbone or<br>
branching chain once modified are defined as W "backbone" units. For example,<br>
when &amp; secondary amine moiety, the major constituent of the backbones and<br>
breaching chains of the present invention, having the structure<br>
H<br>
— {N-RJ—<br>
is modified •ccording to the present invention, it is thereafter defined as a W<br>
"backbone* unit, or jimply § W unit. However, for the purposes of the present<br>
invention, some or all of the secondary amine moieties can remain unmodified. These<br>
unmodified secondary amine moieties by virtue of their position in the backbone<br>
chain remain "backbone" units.<br>
In t further similar manner, tertiary amine nitrogens comprising the btckbone<br>
or branching chain once modified are further referred to as Y "branching" units. For<br>
eximple, when • tertiary tmino moiety, which is t chain branch point of cither the<br>
polyimine backbone or other branching chains or rings, having the structure<br>
is modified according to the present invention, it is thereafter defined as a Y<br>
"branching" unit, or simply a Y unit. However, for the purposes of the present<br>
invention, some or all or the tertiary amine moieties can remain unmodified These<br>
unmodified tertiary amine moieties by virtue of their position in the backbone chain<br>
remain "branching" units. The R units associated with the V, W and Y unit nitrogens<br>
which serve to connect the polyamine nitrogens, are described herein below.<br>
The final modified structure of the polyamines of the present invention can be<br>
therefore represented by the general formula<br>
for linear polyamine cotton soil release polymers and by the general formula<br>
for cyclic poiyamine cotton soil release polymers. For the case of polyamines<br>
comprising rings, a Y* unit of the formula<br>
R<br>
servcs as a branch point for a backbone or branch ring. For every Y1 unit there, is a Y<br>
unit having the formula<br>
tfuu will form the connection pouu of the ring to the main polymer chain or brunch.<br>
la the unique case where the backbone is a complete ring, the polyamine backbone<br>
haf the formula<br>
H<br>
therefore comprising no Z terminal unit and having the formula<br>
wherein k is the number of ring forming branching units. Preferably the polyamine<br>
backbones of the present invention comprise no rings.<br>
In the case of non-cyclic polyamines, the ratio of the index n to the index m<br>
relates to the relative degree of branching. A fully non-branched linear modified<br>
poh/amine according to the present invention has the formula<br>
that is, n is equal to 0. The greater the value of n (the lower the ratio of m to n), the<br>
greater the degree of branching in the molecule. Typically the value for m ranges<br>
from a minimum value of 4 to about 400, however larger values of m, especially<br>
when the value of the index n is very low or nearly 0, are also preferred.<br>
Each polyamine nitrogen whether primary, secondary or tertiary, once<br>
modified according to the present invention, is further defined as being a member of<br>
one of three general classes, simple substituted, quaternLred or oxidized. Those<br>
polyamine nitrogen units not modified are classed into V, W, Y, or Z units depending<br>
on whether they are primary, secondary or tertiary nitrogens. That is unmodified<br>
primary amine nitrogens are V or Z units, unmodified secondary amine nitrogens are<br>
W units and unmodified tertiary amine nitrogens are Y units for the purposes of the<br>
present invention.<br>
Modified primary amine moieties are defined as V "terminal" units having one<br>
of three forms:<br>
a) simple substituted units having the structure:<br>
E-N-R—<br>

When my position on a nitrogen is unsubstituted of unmodified, it is<br>
understood that hydrogen will substitute for E. For example, a primary tTiine unit<br>
comprising one E unit in the form of a hydroxyethyl moiety is a V termini! unit<br>
having the formula (HOCH2CH2)Hhk<br>
For the purposes of the present invention there are two types of chain<br>
terminating units, the V and Z units. The Z "terminal" unit derives from i terminal<br>
primary amino moiety of the structure -NH2- Non-cyclic polyamine backbones<br>
according to the present invention comprise only one Z unit whereas cycsc<br>
polyamines can comprise no Z units. The Z "terminal" unit can be substituted with<br>
any of the E units described further herein below, except when the Z unit is modified<br>
to fbnn an N-oxid«. In the case where the Z unit nitrogen is oxidized to in N-oxide,<br>
U nitrogen must be modified and therefore E cannot be a hydrogen.<br>
The potyamines of the present invention comprise backbone R "linking" units<br>
that serve to connect the nitrogen atoms of the backbone. R units comprise units<br>

E units do not comprise hydrogen atom when the V, W or Z units are<br>
oxidized, that is the nitrogens are N-oxides. For example, the backbone chain or<br>
branching chains do not comprise units of the following structure:<br>
H-N— R or — or N— H<br>
Additionally, E units do not comprise carbonyl moieties directly bonded to a<br>
nitrogen atom when the V, W or Z units are oxidized, that is, the nitrogens are Noxides.<br>

M is hydrogen or a water soluble cation in sufficient amount to satisfy charge<br>
balance, For example, a sodium cation equally satisfies -(CF^pCC^M, and<br>
-(CH2)qS03M, thereby resulting in -(CH2)pCO2Na, and -(CH2)qS03Nfa moieties.<br>
More than one monovalent cation, (sodium, potassium, etc.) can be combined to<br>
satisfy the required chemical charge balance. However, more than one anionic group<br>
may be charge balanced by a divalent cation, or more than one mono-valent cation<br>
may be necessary to satisfy the charge requirements of a poly-anionic radical. For<br>
example, a -(CH2)pP03M moiety substituted with sodium atoms has the formula -<br>
(CH2)pP03Na3. Divalent cations such as calcium (Ca?-4) or magnesium (Mg.^4")<br>
may be substituted for or combined with other suitable mono-valent water soluble<br>
cations. Preferred cations are sodium and potassium, more preferred is sodium.<br>
X is a water soluble anion such as chlorine (Cl"), bromine (Br) and iodine<br>

than or equal to the value of n; m has the value from 4 to about 400, n !ias the value<br>
from 0 to about 200; m + n has the value of at least 5.<br>
The preferred cotton soil release agents of the present invention comprise<br>
polyamine backbones wherein less than about 50% of the R groups comprise "oxy" R<br>
units, preferably less than about 20%, more preferably less than 5%, most preferably<br>
the R unita comprise no "oxy" R units.<br>
The most preferred cotton soil release agents which comprise no "oxy" R<br>
units comprise polyamine backbones wherein less than 50% of the R groups<br>
comprise more than 3 carbon atoms. For example, ethylene, 1,2-propylene, and 1,3-<br>
propylene comprise 3 or less carbon atoms and are the preferred "hydrocarbyl" R<br>
units. That is when backbone R units are Ci-C^ aikyiene, preferred is CvC3<br>
aikylene, mo$: preferred is ethylene.<br>
The cotton soil release agents of the present invention comprise modified<br>
homogeneous and non-homogeneous polyamine b&amp;ckbones, wherein 100% or less of<br>
the -NH units are modified. For the purpose of the present invention the term<br>
"homogeneous polyamine backbone" is defined as a polyamine backbone having R<br>
units that are the same (i.e., all ethylene). However, this sameness definition does<br>
not exclude polyamines that comprise other extraneous units comprising the polymer<br>
backbone which are present due to an artifact of the chosen method of chemical<br>
synthesis. For example, it is known to those skilled in the art that ethanolamine may<br>
be used as an "initiator" in the synthesis of polyethyleneimines, therefore a sample of<br>
polyethyleneimine that comprises one hydroxyethvi moiety resulting from the<br>
polymerization "initiator8 would be considered to comprise a homogeneous<br>
polyamine backbone for the purposes of the present invention. A polyamine<br>
backbone comprising all ethylene R units wherein no branching Y units are present is<br>
a homogeneous backbone. A polyamine backbone comprising all ethylene R units is<br>
a homogeneous backbone regardless of the degree of branching or the number of<br>
cyclic branches present.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention the term "non-homogeneous<br>
polymer backbone" refers to polyamine backbones that are a composite of various R<br>
unit lengths and R unit types. For example, a non-homogeneous backbone comprises<br>
R units that are a mixture of ethylene and 1,2-propylene units. For the purposes of<br>
the present invention a mixture of "hydrocarbyl" and "oxy" R units is not necessary<br>
to provide i non-homogeneous backbone. The proper manipulation of these "R unit<br>
chain lengths1 provides the formulator with the ability to modify the solubility and<br>
fabric subsuntivity of the cotton soil release agents of the present invention.<br>
Preferred cotton soU release polymers of the present invention comprise<br>
horoogeivxxis polyamine backbones that are totally or partiaily substituted by<br>
polyeth&gt;ieneoxy moieties, totally or partially quatemized amines, nitrogens totally or<br>
putUUy oxidized to N-oxides, and mixtures thereof However, not all backbone<br>
amine nitrogens must b« modified in the same manner, the choice of modification<br>
being left to the specific needs of the formulator. The degree of ethoxylation is also<br>
determined by the specific requirements of the formulator.<br>
The preferred polytmines that comprise the backbone of the compounds of<br>
the present invention ire generally polyiJkyieneamines (PAA's), polyalkyleneimines<br>
(PATs), preferably polyethyleneamine (PEA's), polyethyleneimines (PEFs), or PEA's<br>
or PEFn connected by moieties having longer R units than the parent PAA's, I'AI's,<br>
PEA's or PEl's. A common polyalkyleneamine (PAA) is tetrabutylenepentamine.<br>
PEA's are obtained by reactions involving ammonia and cthylene dichloride, followed<br>
by fractional distillation. The common PEA's obtained are triethylenetetramine<br>
(TETA) and teraethyienepentamine (TEPA). Above the pent&amp;mines, i.e., the<br>
hexamines, heptamines, octamines and possibly nonamines, the cogenericaily derived<br>
mixture does not appear to separate by distillation and can include other materials<br>
such as cyclic amines and particularly piperazines. There can also be present cyclic<br>
amines with side chains in which nitrogen atoms appear. See U S. Patent 2,192,312,<br>
Dickinson, issued May 14, 1957, which describes the preparation of PEA's,<br>
Preferred amine polymer backbones comprise R units that are C^ aikylene<br>
(ethylene) units, also known as polyethylenimines (PEr$). Preferred PErs haw at<br>
least moderate branching, that is the ratio of m to n is less than 4: 1, however PEFs<br>
having a ratio of m to n of about 2: 1 are most preferred. Preferred backbones, prior<br>
to modification have the general formula:<br>
wherein m and n are the same as defined herein above. Preferred PEI's, prior to<br>
modification, will have a molecular weight greater than about 200 daltons.<br>
The relative proportions of primary, secondary and tertiary amine unils in<br>
the polyamine backbone, especially in the case of PErs, will vary, depending on the<br>
manner of preparation. Each hydrogen atom attached to each nitrogen itom of the<br>
polyamine backbone chain represents a potential site for subsequent substitution,<br>
qualernization or oxidation.<br>
These poryamines can be prepared, for example, by polymerizing<br>
ethykneirnine in the presence of a catalyst such as carbon dioxide, sodium bisulfite,<br>
sutfuric acid, hydrogen peroxide, hydrochloric acid, acetic acid, etc. Specific<br>
methods for preparing these polyamine backbones are disclosed in U.S. Patent<br>

Examples of modified cotton soil release polymers of the present invention<br>
comprising PErs, are illustrated in Formulas I - IV:<br>
Formula I depicts a cotton soil release polymer comprising a PE1 backbone<br>
wherein aU substitutable nitrogens are modified by replacement of hydrogen with a<br>
polyoxyalkyieneoxy unit, -(CH^C^O^M, having the formula<br>
Formula I<br>
This is an example of a cotton soil release polymer that is fully modified by one type<br>
of moiety.<br>
Formula II depicts a cotton soil release polymer comprising a PEI backbone<br>
wherein all substitutable primary amine nitrogens are modified by replacement of<br>
hydrogen with a polyoxyalkyleneoxy unit, -(CH2CH2O)7H. the molecule is then<br>
modi6ed by subsequent oxidation of all oxidlzable primary and secondary nitrogens<br>
to N-oxides, said cotton soil release agent having the formula<br>
Formula n<br>
FormuU 133 depicts a cotton soil release polymer comprising a PEI backbone<br>
wherein all backbone hydrogen atoms are substituted and some backbone amine units<br>
are quaternized. The substituems are polyoxyalkyleneoxy units, -{CH^CHlQW or<br>
methyl groups. The modified PEI cotton soil release polymer has the formula<br>
Formula ffl<br>
Formula IV depicts a cotton soil release polymer comprising a P£I backbone<br>
wherein the backbone nitrogens are modified by substitution (i.e. by -(Cf^CHjO^H<br>
or methyl), quaternized, oxidized to N-oxides or combinations thereof. The resulting<br>
cotton soil release polymer has the formula<br>
o<br>
Formula IV<br>
In the above examples, not all nitrogens of a unit class comprise the same<br>
modification. The present invention allows the formula: or to have a portion of the<br>
secondary amine nitrogens ethoxytated while having other secondary amine nitrogens<br>
oxidized to N-oxides. This also applies to the primary amine nitrogens, in thai the<br>
formulator may choose to modify all or a portion of the primary amine nitrogens with<br>
one or more substituents prior to oxidation or quaternizat'ion. Any possible<br>
combination of E groups can be substituted on the primary and secondary amine<br>
nitrogens, except for the restrictions described herein above.<br>
The formulator may take advantage of the possibility to modify the<br>
poh/amine backbones of the present invention in a manner that affords only the<br>
minimal amount of oxidizing the substrate backbones. For example, bleach<br>
"tempering" may be accomplished prior to or after formulation. For the purposes of<br>
the present invention, the term "bleach tempering" is defined as treating the modified<br>
polyamine with sufficient bleaching agent to oxidize the backbone against the<br>
[Conditions of formulation, By way of demonstration, a polyamine backbone does not<br>
necessarily require full modification by quatemkation or N-oxidation to be stable<br>
towards bleach When a sample of modified polyamine backbone is exposed to a<br>
suitable bleaching system (eg. nbnanoyloxywnzenesulfonate/perborate) any<br>
backbone nitrogens oxidizable under these conditions will oxidized. However, due<br>
to the exact structural properties of the backbone, some or all or the pre-bleach<br>
treatment nitrogens may remain un-effected. Once this tempering has taken place,<br>
the formulator may combine the modified polyamine with the bleaching system and<br>
remain confident that the polyamine will not consume the bulk of the bleaching agent.<br>
Those skilled in the art of bleach formulation will recognize that the ble&amp;ch<br>
tempering will have its limitations and that a weaker tempering bleach should not be<br>
used in place of the formulation bleach.<br>
In another mode, the formulator may wish to add excess bleaching agent to<br>
the laundry detergent composition during formulation in order to conduct suitable in<br>
situ bleach "tempering" during storage and handling of the formulation,<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention involves the use of<br>
polyhydroxy fatty acid amide surfactants in combination with the modified<br>
polyamines described herein. This combination of nonionic surfactant and modified<br>
polyamine is especially useful at low pH formulations, that is at a pH less than about<br>
10.<br>
A preferred laundry detergent composition according to the present invention<br>
comprises the low pH formula comprising:<br>
a) at least about 0.01% to about 95% by weight, of a polyhydroxy fatty<br>
acid amide nonionic detersive surfactant;<br>
b) from about 0.01 to about 10% by weight, of an anionic soil release<br>
polymer having effective soil release on norniotton fabric;<br>
c) optionally from about 0.05 to about 30% by weight, of a bleach;<br>
d) from about 0.01 to about 10% by weight, a water-soluble or<br>
dispersible, bleach stable, modified polyamine cotton soil release agent<br>
according to the present invention; and<br>
e) the balance carrier and adjunct ingredients; wherein the composition<br>
has a pH of about 7.2 to about 8.9 when measured as a 10*/o solution<br>
in water.<br>
The poryhydroxy fatty add amidei suitable for use in the low pH<br>
embodiment of the present invention may be combined with other suitable detersive<br>
surfactants such as anionic, amphoiytic, zwitterionic surfactants, and mixtures thereof.<br>
METHOD OF USE<br>
Present invention relates to methods of providing soil release benefits to fabric. The present invention relates to providing soil release benefits to cotton fabric by contacting said cotton fabric with a laundry composition comprising:<br>
a)	at least about 0.001% by weight, a water-soluble or dispersible,<br>
bleach stable, modified polyamine cotton soil release agent according<br>
to the present invention; and<br>
b)	the balance carrier and adjunct ingredients.<br>
The present invention also relates to methods of providing soil release to ail fabrics that comprise the laundry wash load, wherein said fabric is contacted with a laundry detergent composition comprising:<br>
a)	at least 0,01% by weight, of a detersive surfactant selected from the<br>
group consisting of anionic, cationic, nonionic, zwitterionic, and<br>
amphoiytic surfactants, and mixtures thereof,<br>
b)	from about 0.01 to about 10% by weight, of a soil release polymer<br>
having effective soil release on non-cotton fabric;<br>
c)	optionally from about 0.05 to about 30% by weight, of a bleach;<br>
d)	from about 0,1 to about 10% by weight, a modified polyamine cotton<br>
soil release polymer according to the present invention; and<br>
e)	the balance carrier and adjunct ingredients.<br>
The methods of the present invention are suitable for use when the fabric being treated for soil release is also in need of bleaching. Compositions comprising bleaching agents commonly used to clean white fabrics are compatible with the cotton soil release polymers of the present invention.<br>
The present invention also provides a method for cleaning soiled cotton fabric by contacting said fabric with an aqueous solution of the laundry compositions or the laundry detergent compositions of the present invention. Because of the substantive nature of the compounds of the present invention, the methods described herein provide cotton soil release benefits for several treatments or laundry washes after the present method has been withdrawn. The process also results in cotton fabric having a cleaner appearance and in the case of white cotton fabric, a whiter appearance,<br>
For the purposes of the methods for providing cotton soil release to cotton fabric, the backbone of the polyamine does not require modification, that is no backbone nitrogens require oxidation of quaterniation. This is especially true in the case of methods that do not use bleaching materials.<br><br>
For example, a suitable cotton soil release agent has the structure<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein the polyamine backbone is substitued with polyethyleneoxy units and no backbone nitrogen units are quaternized or oxidized. However, cotton soil release agents of the above type can not be combined with bleaching agents except in the cases where these substrates are the starting materials for "bleach tempered" cotton soil release agents where the "tempered" cotton soil release agents are pre-fonned or "tempered" in situ.<br>

If used, detergent compositions will typically contain from about 0,025% to about 1.25%, by weight, of such bleaches, especially sulfonate zinc phthalocyanine.<br>
If desired, the bleaching compounds can be catalyzed by means of a manganese compound. Such compounds are well known in the art and include, for example, the manganese-based catalysts disclosed in U.S. Pat. 5,246,621, U.S. Pat, 5,244,594; U.S. Pat. 5,194,416; U.S. Pat. 5,1 14,606; and European Pat. App. Pub. Nos. 549.271A1, 549.272A1, 544.440A2, and 544.490A1; Preferred examples of these catalysts include MnIV2(u-O)3(1,4,7-trimethyl-1,4,7-triazacyclo-<br>
nonane)2(PF6)2, MnIII2(u-O)l(u-OAc)2(1,4,7-trimethyl-1,4,7--triazacydononine)2-(C104)2, MnIV4(u-O)6(l,4,7-triazacyclononane)4(CI04)4, MnIIIMnIV4(u-O)1(u-<br>
OAc)2.(1,4,7-trimethyl-l,4,7-triazacyclcnonane)2(C104)3,MnIV(lt4,7-trimethyl-1,4,7-triazacyclononane)- (OCH3)3(PF6), and mixtures thereof. Other metal-based bleach catalysts include those disclosed in U.S. Pat. 4,430,243 and U.S. Pat. 5,114,611. The use of manganese with various complex ligands to enhance bleaching is also reported in the following United States Patents: 4,728,455; 5,284,944; 5,246,612; 5,256,779; 5,280,117; 5,274,147; 5,153,161; and 5,227,034.<br>
As a practical matter, and not by way of limitation, the compositions and processes herein can be adjusted to provide on the order of at least one part per ten million of the active bleach catalyst species in the aqueous washing liquor, and will preferably provide from about 0.1 ppm to about 700 ppm, more preferably from about 1 ppm to about 500 ppm, of the catalyst species in the laundry liquor.<br>
A wide variety of other ingredients useful in detergent compositions can be included in the compositions herein, including other active ingredients, carriers, hydrotropes, processing aids, dyes or pigments, solvents for liquid formulations, solid fillers for bar compositions, etc. If high sudsing is desired, suds boosters such as the C10-C16 alkanolamides can be incorporated into the compositions, typically al 1%-10% levels, The C10-C14 monoethanol and diethanol amides illustrate a typical class of such suds boosters. Use of such suds boosters with high sudsing adjunct surfactants such as the amine oxides, betaines and sultaines noted above is also advantageous. If desired, soluble magnesium salts such as MgCl2, MgSO4, and the like, can be added at levels o£ typically, 0.1%-2%, to provide additional suds ?nd to enhance grease removal performance.<br>
Various detersive ingredients employed in the present compositions optionally can be further stabilized by absorbing said ingredients onto a porous hydrophobic substrate, then coating said substrate with a hydrophobic coating. Preferably, the detersive ingredient is admixed with a surfactant before being absorbed into the porous substrate. In use, the detersive ingredient is released from the substrate into the aqueous washing liquor, where it performs its intended detersive function.<br>
To illustrate this technique in more detail, a porous hydrophobic silica (trademark SIPERNAT D10, DeGussa) is admixed with a proteolytic enzyme solution containing 3%-5% of C13-15 ethoxylated alcohol (EO 7) nonionic surfactant. Typically, the enzyme/surfactant solution is 2.5 X the weight of silica. The resulting powder is dispersed with stirring in silicone oil (various silicone oil viscosities in the range of 500-12,500 can be used). The resulting silicone oil dispersion is emulsified or otherwise added to the final detergent matrix. By this means, ingredients such as the aforementioned enzymes, bleaches, bleach activators,<br>
bleach catalysts&gt; photoactivators, dyes, fluorescers, fabric conditioners and hydrolyzable surfactants can be "protected" for use in detergents, including liquid laundry detergent compositions.<br>
Liquid detergent compositions can contain water and other solvents as carriers. Low molecular weight primary or secondary aJcohoIs exemplified by methanol, ethanol, propanol, and isopropanol are suitable. Monohydric alcohols are preferred for solubilizing surfactant, but polyols such as those containing from 2 to about 6 carbon atoms and from 2 to about 6 hydroxy groups (e.g., 1,3-propanediol, ethylene glycol, glycerin, and 1,2-propanediol) can also be used. The compositions may contain &amp;om 5% to 90%, typically 10% to 50% of such carriers.<br>
The detergent compositions herein will preferably be formulated such that, during use in aqueous cleaning operations, the wash water will have a pH of between about 6.5 and about 1 1, preferably between about 7,5 and 10.5. Laundry products are typically at pH 9-1 1 . Techniques for controlling pH at recommended usage levels include the use of buffers, alkalis, acids, etc., and are well known to those skilled in the art,<br>
Enzymes<br>
Enzymes can be included in the present detergent compositions for a variety of purposes, Including removal of protein-based, carbohydrate-based, or triglyceride-based stains from surfaces such as textiles, for the prevention of refugee dye transfer, for example in laundering, and for fabric restoration. Suitable enzymes include proteases, amylases, lipases, cellulases, peroxidases, and mixtures thereof of any suitable origin, such as vegetable, animal, bacterial, fungal and yeast origin. Preferred selections arc influenced by factors such as pH-activity and/or stability optima, thermostability, and stability to active detergents, builders and the like. In this  respect bacterial or fungal enzymes are preferred, such as bacterial amylases and proteases, and fungal ceilulases.<br>
"Detersive enzyme", as used herein, means any enzyme having a cleaning, stain removing or otherwise beneficial effect in a laundry, hard surface cleaning or personal ore detergent composition. Preferred detersive enzymes are hydrokises such as proteases, amylases and lipases. Preferred enzymes for laundry purposes include, but are not limited to, proteases, ceUuIases, lipases and peroxidases.<br>
Enzymes are normally incorporated into detergent or detergent additive compositions at levels sufficient to provide a "cleaning-effective amount'. The term "cleaning effective amount" refers to any amount capable of producing a clearing, stain removal, soil removal, whitening, deodorizing, or freshness improving effect on substrates such as fabrics. In practical terms for current commercial preparations,<br>
typical amounts are up to about 5 mg by weight, more typically 0.01 mg to 3 mg, of active enzyme per gram of the detergent composition. Stated otherwise, the compositions herein will typically comprise from 0.001% to 5%, preferably 0.01%-l% by weight of a commercial enzyme preparation. Protease enzymes are usually present in such commercial preparations at levels sufficient to provide from 0.005 to 0 1 Anson units (AU) of activity per gram of composition. For certain detergents, it may be desirable to increase the active enzyme content of the commercial preparation in order to minimize the total amount of non-catalytically active materials and thereby improve spotting/filming or other end-resuits. Higher active levels may also be desirable in highly concentrated detergent formulations.<br>
Suitable examples of proteases are the subtilisins which are obtained from particular strains of B. subtilis and B. licheniformis. One suitable protease is obtained from a strain of Bacillus, having maximum activity throughout the pH range of 8-12, developed and sold as ESPERASE® by Novo Industries A/S of Denmark, hereinafter "Novo". The preparation of this enzyme and analogous enzymes wi described in GB 1,243,784 to Novo.

Amylases suitable herein include, for example, a-amylases described in GB 1,296,839 to Novo; RAPIDASE®, International Bio-Synthetics, Inc. and TERMAMYL®, Novo. FUNGAMYL® from Novo is especially useful. Engineering of enzymes for improved stability, e.g., oxidative stability, is known. See, for example J. Biological Chem., Vol. 260, No. 11, June 1985, pp 6518-6521. Certain preferred embodiments of the present compositions can make use of amylases having improved stability in detergents, especially improved oxidative stability as measured against a reference-point of TERMAMYL® in commercial use in 1993. These preferred amylases herein share the characteristic of being "stability-enhanced" amylases, characterized, at a minimum, by a measurable improvement in one or more of: oxidative stability, e.g., to hydrogen peroxide / tetraacetylethylenediamine in buffered solution at pH 9-10; thermal stability, eg., at common wash temperatures such as about 60°C; or alkaline stability, e.g., at u pH from about 8 to about 11, measured versus the above-identified reference-point amylase. Stability can be measured using any of the art-disclosed technical tests. See, for example, references disclosed in WO 9402597. Stability-enhanced amyiasts can be obtained from Novo or from Genencor International, One class of highly preferred amyiases herein have the commonality of being derived using site-directed mutagenesis from one or more of the Baccillus amylases, especialy the Bacillus a* amylases, regardless of whether one, two or multiple amylase strains are the immediate precursors. Oxidative stability-enhanced amylases vs. the above-identified reference aim/Use are preferred for use, especially in bleaching, more preferably oxygen bleaching, as distinct from chlorine bleaching, detergent compositions herein. Such preferred amylases include (a) an amylase according to the hereinbefore incorporated WO 9402597, Novo, Feb. 3,1994, as further illustrated by a mutant in which substitution is made, using alanine or threonine, preferably threonine, of the methionine residue located in position 197  of the B. licheniform alpha-amylase, known as TERMAMYL®, or the homologous position variation of a similar parent amylase such as B. amylollquefaciens, B.sub tilis, or B.stearothermophilus; (b) stability-enhanced amylases as described by Genencor International in a paper entitled "Oxidatively Resistant alpha-Amylases" presented at the 207th American<br>
Chemical Society National Meeting, March 13-17 1994, by C. Mitchinson. Therein it was noted that bleaches in automatic dishwashing detergents inactivate alpha-amylases but that improved oxidative stability amylases have been made by Gtuencor from B.lichemformis NCIB8061 . Metnionine (Met) was identified as the most likely residue to be modified. Met was substituted, one at a time, in positions 8, 15, 197, 256, 304, 366 and 438 leading.to specific mutants, particularly important being M197L and M197T with the M197T variant being the most stable expressed variant; (c) particularly preferred amylases herein include amylase variants having additional modification in the immediate parent as described in WO 95 10603 A and are available from the assignee, Novo, as DURAMYL®. Other particularly preferred oxidative stability enhanced amylase include those described in WO 9418314 to Genencor International and WO 9402597 to Novo. Any other oxidative stability-enhanced amylase can be used, for example as derived by site-directed mutagenesis from known chimeric, hybrid or simple mutant parent forms of available amylases. Other preferred enzyme modifications are accessible. Sec WO 9509909 A to Novo.<br>

Enzymes are further disclosed in U.S. 4,101,457, Plane et al, July 18, 1978, and in U.S. 4,507,219, Hughes, March 5.6, 1985 Enzyme materials useful for liquid detergent formulations, and their incorporation into such formulations, arc disclosed in U.S. 4,261,868, Hora et al, April 14, 1981. Enzymes for use in detergents can be stabilized by various techniques. Enzyme stabilization techniques are disclosed and exemplified in U.S. 3,600,319, August 17, 1971, Gcdge et al, EP 199,405 and EP 200,586, October 29, 1986, Venegas. Enzyme stabilization systems arc also described, for example, in U.S. 3,519,570. A useful Bacillus, sp. AC13 giving proteases, xylanases and celluloses, is described in WO 9401532 A to Novo,<br>
Enzyme Stabilizing System<br>
Enzyme-containing, including but not limited to, liquid compositions, herein may comprise from about 0.001% to about 10%, preferably from about 0,005% to about 8%, most preferably from about 0.01% to about 6%, by weight of an enzyme stabilizing system. The enzyme stabilizing system can be any stabilizing system which is compatible with the detersive enzyme. Such a system may be inherently provided by other formulation actives, or be added separately, e.g., by the formulator or by a manufacturer of detergent-ready enzymes. Such stabilizing systems am, for example, comprise calcium ion, boric acid, propylene glycol, short chain carboxylic acids, boronic acids, and mixtures thereof, and are designed to address different stabilization problems depending on the type and physical form of the detergent composition.<br>
One stabilizing approach is the use of water-soluble sources of calcium and/or magnesium ions in the finished compositions which provide such ions to the enzymes. Calcium ions are generally more effective than magnesium ions and are preferred<br>
herein if only one type of cation is being used. Typical detergent compositions, especially liquids, will comprise from about 1 to about 30, preferably from about 2 to about 20, more preferably from about 8 to about 12 millimoles of calcium km per liter of finished detergent composition, though variation is possible depending on factors including the multiplicity, type and levels of enzymes incorporated. Preferably water-soluble calcium'or magnesium saJts are employed, including for example calcium chloride, calcium hydroxide, calcium formate, calcium malate, calcium maleate, calcium hydroxide and calcium acetate; more generally, calcium sulfate or magnesium salts corresponding to the exemplified calcium salts may be used. Further increased levels of Calcium and/or Magnesium may of course be useful, for example for promoting the grease-cutting action of certain types of surfactant.<br>
Another stabilizing approach is by use of borate species. See Severson, U.S. 4,537,706. Borate stabilizers, when used, may be at levels of up to 10% or more of the composition though more typically, levels of up to about 3% by weight of boric acid or other borate compounds such as borax or orthoborate are suitable for liquid detergent use. Substituted boric acids such as phenylboronic acid, butaneboronic acid, p-bromophenylboronic acid or the like can be used in place of boric acid and reduced levels of total boron in detergent compositions may be possible though the use of such substituted boron derivatives.<br>
Stabilizing systems of certain cleaning compositions may further comprise from 0 to about 10%, preferably from about 0.01% to about 6% by weight, of chlorine bleach scavengers, added to prevent chlorine bleach species present in many water supplies from attacking and inactivating the enzymes, especially under alkaline conditions. While chlorine levels in water may be small, typically in the range from about 0.5 ppm to about 1.75 ppm, the available chlorine in the total volume of water that comes in contact with the enzyme, for example during fabric-washing, can be relatively  large; accordingly, enzyme stability to chlorine in-use is sometimes problematic. Since perborate or percarbonate, which have the ability to react with chlorine bleach, may present in certain of the instant compositions in amounts accounted for separately from the stabilizing system, the use of additional stabilizers against chlorine, may, most generally, not be essential, though improved results may be obtainable from their use. Suitable chlorine scavenger anions are widely known and readily available, and, if used, can be salts containing ammonium cations with sulfite, bisulfite, thiosulfite, thiosulfate, iodide, etc. Antioxidants such as carbamate, ascorbate, etc, organic amines such as ethylenediaminetetracetic acid (EDTA) or alkali metal salt thereof, monoethanolamine (MEA), and mixtures thereof can<br>
likewise be used, Likewise, special enzyme inhibition systems can be incorporated such that different enzymes have maximum compatibility. Other conventional scavengers such as bisulfate, nitrate, chloride, sources of hydrogen peroxide such as sodium perborate tetrahydrate, sodium perborate monohydrate and sodium percarbonate, as well as phosphate, condensed phosphate, acetate, benzoate, citrate, formate, lactate, malate, tartrate, salicylate, etc., and mixtures thereof can be used if desired. In general, since the chlorine scavenger function can be performed by ingredients separately listed under better recognized functions, (e.g., hydrogen peroxide sources), there is no absolute requirement to add a separate chlorine scavenger unless a compound performing that function to the desired extent is absent from an enzyme-containing embodiment of the invention; even then, the scavenger is added only for optimum results. Moreover, the formulator will exercise a chemist's normal skill in avoiding the use of any enzyme scavenger or stabilizer which is majorty incompatible, as formulated, with other reactive ingredients, if used. In relation to the use of ammonium salts, such salts can be simply admixed with the detergent composition but are prone to adsorb water and/or liberate ammonia during storage, Accordingly, such materials, if present, are desirably protected in a particle such as that described in US 4,652,392, Baginski et al.<br>
The compositions herein can also optionally include one or more other detergent adjunct materials or other materials for assisting or enhancing cleaning performance, treatment of the substrate to be cleaned, or to modify the aesthetics of the detergent composition (e.g., perfumes, colorants, dyes, etc.). The following are illustrative examples of such adjunct materials.<br>
Builden<br>
Detergent builders can optionally be included in the compositions herein to assist in controlling mineral hardness. Inorganic as well as organic builders can be used. Builders are typically used in fabric laundering compositions to assist in the removal of particulate soils.<br>
The level of builder can vary widely depending upon the end use of the composition and its desired physical form. When present, the compositions will typically comprise at least about 1% builder. Liquid formulations typically comprise from about 5% to about 50%, more typically about 5% to about 30%, by weight, of detergent builder. Granular formulations typically comprise from about 10% to about 80%, more typically from about 15% to about 50% by weight, of the detergent builder. Lower or higher levels of builder, however, are not meant to be excluded.<br>
Inorganic or P-containing detergent builders include, but are not limited to, the alkali metal, ammonium and alkanolammonium salts of polyphosphates<br>
(exemplified by the tripolyphosphates, pyrophosphates, and glassy polymeric meta-phosphates), phosphonates, phyiic acid, silicates, carbonates (including bicarbonates and sesquicarbonates), sulphates and aluminosilicates  However, non-phosphate builders are required in some locales. Importantly, the compositions herein function surprisingly well even in the presence of the so-called 'weak" builders (as compared with phosphates) such as citrate, or in the so-called "underbuilt" situation that may occur with zeolite or layered silicate builders.<br>
Examples of silicate builders are the alkali metaJ silicates, particularly those having a SiO2:Na20 ratio in the range 1.6:1 to 3.2:1 and layered silicates, such as the layered sodium silicates described in U.S. Patent 4,664,839, issued May 12, 1987 to H. P Rieck. NaSKS-6 is the trademark for a crystalline layered silicate marketed by Hoechst (commonly abbreviated herein as "SKS-6"). Unlike zeolite builders, the Na SKS-6 silicate builder does not contain aluminum. NaSKS-6 has the delta-Na2SiO5 morphology form of layered silicate. It can be prepared by methods such as those described in German DE-A-3,4 17,649 and DE-A-3,742,043. SKS-6 is a highly preferred layered silicate for use herein, but other such layered silicates, such as those having the general formula NaMSix02x+ryH2Owherein M is sodium or hydrogen, x is a number from 1 .9 to 4, preferably 2, and y is a number from 0 to 20, preferably 0 can be used herein. Various other layered silicates from Hoechst include NaSKS-5, NaSKS-7 and NaSKS-1 1, as the alpha, beta and gamma forms. As noted above, the delta-Na2SiO5 (NaSKS-6 form) is most preferred for use herein. Other silicates may also be useful such as for example magnesium silicate, which can serve as a crisperung agent in granular formulations, as a stabilizing agent for oxygen bleaches, and as a component of suds control systems.<br>
Examples of carbonate builders are the alkaline earth and alkali metal carbonates as disclosed in German Patent Application No. 2,321,001 published on November 15, 1973.<br>
Aluminosilicate builders are useful in the present invention. Aluminosilicate builders are of great importance in most currently marketed heavy duty granular detergent compositions, and can also be a significant builder ingredient in liquid detergent formulations. Aluminosilicate builders include those having the empirical formula:<br>
Mz(zA102)y] xH20<br>
wherein z and y are integers of at least 6, the molar ratio of z to y is in the range from 1 .0 to about 0.5, and x is an integer from about 15 to about 264.<br>
Useful aluminosilicate ion exchange materials are commercially available. These alummosilicates can be crystalline or amorphous in structure and can be<br>
naturally-occurring aluminosilicates or synthetically derived. A method for producing aluminosilicate ion exchange materials is disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,985,669, Krummel, et al, issued October 12, 1976. Preferred synthetic crystalline aluminosilicate ion exchange materials useful herein are available under the designations Zeolite A, Zeolite P (B), Zeolite MAP and Zeolite X, In an especially preferred embodiment, the crystalline aluminosilicate ion exchange material has the formula:<br>
Na12[(A102)12(Si02)12]-xH20<br>
wherein x is from about 20 to about 30, especially about 27. This material is known as Zeolite A. Dehydrated zeolites (x - 0 - 10) may also be used herein. Preferably, the aluminosilicate has a panicle size of about 0.1-10 microns in diameter<br>
Organic detergent builders suitable for the purposes of the preser.: invention include, but are not restricted to, a wide variety of polycarboxylate compounds. AJ used herein, "polycarbcocylate" refers to compounds having a plurality of carboxylate groups, preferably at least 3 carboxylates. Polycarboxylate builder can generally be added to the composition in acid form, but can also be added in the form of a neutralized salt. When utilized in salt form, alkali metals, such as sodium, potassium, and lithium, or alkanolammonium salts are preferred.<br>
Included among the polycarboxylate builders are a variety of categories of useful materials. One important category of polycarboxylate builders encompasses the ether polycarboxylates, including oxydisuccinate, as disclosed in Berg, U.S. Patent 3,128,287, issued April 7, 1964, and Lambert! et aJ, U.S. Patent 3,635,830, issued January 18, 1972. See also "TMS/TDS" builders of U.S. Patent 4,663,071, issued to Bush et al, on May 5,1987. Suitable ether polycarboxylates also include cyclic compounds, particularly alicyclic compounds, such as those described in U.S Patents 3,923,679; 3,835,163; 4,158,635; 4,120,874 and 4,102,903.<br>
Other useful detergency builders include the ether hydroxypolycarboxylates, copolymers of maleic anhydride with ethylene or vinyl methyl ether, 1, 3,5-trihydroxy benzene-2,4,6-trisulphonic add, and carboxymethyloxysuccinic acid, the various alkali metal, ammonium and substituted ammonium salts of polyacetic acids such as ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid and nitrilotriacetic acid, as well as polycarboxylates such as mellitic acid, succinic acid, oxydisuccinic acid, polymaleic acid, benzene 1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid, carboxymethyloxysuccinic acid, and soluble salts thereof.<br>
Citrate builders, e.g., citric acid and soluble salts thereof (particularly sodium salt), are polycarboxylate builders of particular Importance for heavy duty liquid detergent formulations due to their availability from renewable resources and their<br>
biodegradability. Citrates can also be used in granular compositions, especially in combination with zeolite and/or layered silicate builders. Oxydisuccinates are also especially useful in such compositions and combinations.<br>
Also suitable in the detergent compositions of the present invention are the 3,3-dicarboxy-4-oxa-l,6-hexanedi08tes and the related compounds disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,566,984, Bush, issued January 28, 1986. Useful succinic acid builders include the C5-C20 alkyl and alkenyl succinic acids and salts thereof. A particularly preferred compound of this type is dodecenylsuccinic acid. Specific examples of succinate builders include: laurylsuccinate, myrisrylsuccinate, palmitylsuccinat?, 2-dodecenylsuccinate (preferred), 2-pentadecenylsuccinate, and the like. Laurylsuccinates are the preferred builders of this group, and are described in European Patent Application 86200690.5/0,200,263, published November 5, 1986.<br>
Other suitable polycarboxylates are disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,144,226, Crutchfield et al, issued March 13, 1979 and in U.S. Patent 3,308,067, Diehl, issued March 7, 1967. See also Diehl U.S. Patent 3,723,322.<br>
Fatty acids, eg., C12-C18 monocarboxylic acids, can also be incorporated into the compositions alone, or in combination with the aforesaid builders, especially citrate and/or the succinate builders, to provide additional builder activity. Such use of fatty acids will generally result in a diminution of sudsing, which should be taken into account by the formulator.<br>
In situations where phosphorus-based builders can be used, and especially in the formulation of bars used for hand-laundering operations, the various alkali metal phosphates such u the well-known sodium tripolyphosphates, sodium pyrophosphate and sodium orthophosphate can be used. Phosphonate builders such as ethanol-hydroxy-l,l-diphosphonate and other known phosphonates (see, for example, U.S. Patents 3,159,581; 3,213,030; 3,422,021; 3,400,148 and 3,422,137) can also be used<br>

Compounds for reducing or suppressing the formation of suds can be incorporated into the compositions of the present invention. Suds suppression can be of particular importance in the so-called "high concentration cleaning process" as described in U.S, 4,489,455 and 4,489,574 ar.d in front-loading European-style washing machines.<br>
A wide variety of materials may be used as suds suppressors, and suds suppressors are well known to those skilled in the art. See, for example, Kirk Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Third Edition, Volume 7, pages 430-447 (John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1979). One category of suds suppressor of particular interest encompasses monocarboxylic fatty acid and soluble salts therein. See U.S. Patent 2,954,347, issued September 27, 1960 to Wayne St. John. The monocarboxylic fatty acids and salts thereof used as suds suppressor typically have hydrocarbyl chains of 10 to about 24 carbon atoms, preferably 12 to 18 carbon atoms. Suitable salts include the alkali metal salts such as sodium, potassium, and lithium salts, and ammonium and alkanolammonium salts.<br>
The detergent compositions herein may also contain non-surfactant suds suppressors. These include, for example: high molecular weight hydrocarbons such as paraffin, fatty acid esters (e.g., fatty acid triglycerides), fatty acid esters of monovanient alcohols, aliphatic C18-C40 ketones (e.g., stearone), etc. Other suds inhibitors include N-alkylated amino triazines such as tri- to hexa-alkylmelamines or di- to tetra-alkyldiarnine chlortriazines formed as products of cyanuric chloride with two or three moles of a primary or secondary amine containing 1 to 24 carbon atoms, propylene oxide, and monostearyl phosphates such as monostearyl alcohol phosphate ester and monostearyl di-alkali metal (e.g., K, Na, and Li) phosphates and phosphate esters. The hydrocarbons such as paraffin and haloparaffin can be utilized in liquid form. The liquid hydrocarbons will be liquid at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, and will have a pour point in the range of about -40°C and about 50°C, and a minimum boiling point not less than about 110°C (atmospheric pressure). It is also known to utilize waxy hydrocarbons, preferably having a melting point below about 100°C. The hydrocarbons constitute a preferred category of suds suppressor for<br><br>
detergent compositions. Hydrocarbon suds suppressors are described, for example, in U.S. Patent 4,265,779, issued May 5, 1981 to Gandolfo et al. The hydrocarbons, thus, include aliphatic, alicyclic, aromatic, and heterocyclic saturated or unsatur?.ted hydrocarbons having from about 12 to about 70 carbon atoms. The term "paraffin," as used in this suds suppressor discussion, is intended to include mixtures of true paraffins and cyclic hydrocarbons.<br>
Another preferred category of non-surfactant suds suppressors comprises silicone suds suppressors. This category includes the use of polyorganosiloxane oils, such as polydimethylsiloxane, dispersions or emulsions of polyorganosiioxane oils or resins, and combinations of polyorganosiloxane with silica particles wherein the polyorganosiloxane is chemisorbed or fused onto the silica. Silicone suds suppressors are well known in the art and are, for example, disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,265,779, issued May 5, 1981 to Gandolfo et al and European Patent Application No, 89307851.9, published February 7, 1990, by Starch, M.

For any detergent compositions to be used in automatic laundry washing machines, suds should not form to the extent that they overflow the washing machine. Suds suppressors, when utilized, are preferably present in a "suds suppressing amount. By "suds" suppressing amount" is meant that the formulator of the composition can select an amount of this suds controlling agent that will sufficiently control the suds to result in a low-sudsing laundry detergent for use in automatic laundry washing machines.<br>

Preferably, from about 0.5% to about 3% of fatty monocarboxylate suds suppressor is utilized. Silicone suds suppressors are typically utilized in amounts up to about 2.0%, by weight, of the detergent composition, although higher amounts may be used. This upper limit is practical in nature, due primarily to concern with keeping costs minimized and effectiveness of lower amounts for effectively controlling sudsing. Preferably from about 0.01% to about 1% of silicone suds suppressor is used, more preferably from about 0.25% to about 0.5%. As used herein, these weight percentage values include any silica that may be utilized in combination with polyorganosiloxane, as well as any adjunct materials that may be utilized.

Clay softeners can be used in combination with amine and cationic softeners as disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent 4,375,416, Crisp et al, March 1, 1983 and U.S. Patent 4,291,071, Harris et al, issued September 22, 1981.<br>
Dye Transfer Inhibiting Agents -The compositions of the present invention may also include one or more materials effective for inhibiting the transfer of dyes<br><br>
from one fabric to another during the cleaning process. Generally, such dye transfer inhibiting agents include polyvinyl pyrrolidone polymers, polyamine N-oxide polymers, copolymers of N-vinylpyrrolidone and N-vinylimidazole, manganese phthalocyanine, peroxidases, and mixtures thereof, If used, these agents typically comprise from about 0.01% to-about 10% by weight of the composition, preferably from about 0.01% to about 5%, and more preferably from about 0.05% to about 2%.<br>
More specifically, the polyamine N-oxide polymers preferred for use herein contain units having the following structural formula: R-AX-P; wherein P is a polymerizable unit to which an N-0 group can be attached or the N-0 group can form pan of the polymerizable unit or the N-0 group can be attached to both units; A is one of the following structures: -NC(0)-, -C(0)0-, -S-,-0-, -N-; x is 0 or 1 ; and R is aliphatic, ethoxylated aliphatics, aromatics, heterocyclic or alicyclic groups or any combination thereof to which the nitrogen of the N-0 group can be attached or the N-0 group is part of these groups.

These polymers include random or block copolymers where one monomer type is an amine N-oxide and the other monomer type is an N-oxide. The amine N-oxide polymers typically have a ratio of amine to the amine N-oxide of 10:1 to 1:1,000,000. However, the number of amine oxide groups present in the polyamine oxide polymer can be varied by appropriate copolymerization or by an appropriate degree of N-oxidation. The polyamine oxides can be obtained in almost any degree of polymerization. Typically, the average molecular weight is within the range of 500 to 1,000,000; more preferred<br><br>
1,000 to 500,000; most preferred 5,000 to 100,000. This preferred class of materials can be referred to as "PVNO".<br>

Preferably the PVPVI has an average molecular weight range from 5,000 to 1,000,000, more preferably from 5,000 to 200,000, and most preferably from 10,000 to 20,000. (The average molecular weight range is determined by light scattering as described in Barth, et ali., Chemical Analysis, Vol 113. "Modern Methods of Polymer Characterization", the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.) The PVPVI copolymers typically have a molar ratio of N-vinylimidazole to N-vinylpyrrolidone from 1:1 to 0.2:1, more preferably from 0.8:1 to 0.3:1, most preferably from 0.6:1 to 0.4:1. These copolymers can be either linear or branched.<br>

PVP's are known to persons skilled in the detergent fidd; sec, for example, EP-A-262,897 and EP-A-256,696, incorporated herein by reference. Compositions containing PVP can also contain polyethylene glycol ("PEG") hiving an average molecular weight from about 500 to about 100,000, preferably from about 1,000 to about 10,000. Preferably, the ratio of PEG to PVP on a ppm basis delivered in wash solutions is from about 2:1 to about 50:1, and more preferably from about 31 to about 10,1.<br>
The detergent compositions herein may also optionally contain from about 0.005% to 5% by weight of certain types of hydrophilic optical brighteners wluch also provide a dye transfer inhibition action. If used, the compositions herein will preferably comprise from about 0.01V% to 1% by weight of such optical brighteners.<br>
The hydrophilic optical brighteners useful in the present invention are those having the structural formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R1 is selected from anilino, N-2-bis-hydroxyethyl and NK-2-hydroxyeihyl; R2 is selected from N-2-bis-hydroxyethyl, N-2-hydroxyethyl-N-methylarnino, morphilino, chloro and amino; and M is a salt-forming cation such as sodium 01 potassium.<br>
When in the above formula, R1 is anilino, R2 is N-2-bis-hydroxyethyl and M is a cation such as sodium, the brightener is 4,4',-bis[(4-3rulino-6-(N-2-bis-hydroxyethyl)-s-triazine-2-yl)amino]-2,2'-sulbenedisulforuc acid and disodium salt. This particular brightener species is commercially marketed under the tradenaitie Tinopal-UNPA-GX by Ciba-Geigy Corporation. Tinopal-UNPA-GX is the preferred hydrophilic optical brightener useful in the detergent compositions herein.<br>
When in the above formula, R1 is anilino, R2 is N-2-hydroxyethyl-N-2-methylamino and M is a cation such as sodium, the brightener is 4,4'-bis[(4.-anilino-6-(N-2-hydroxyethyl"N-methylarruno)-s-triazine-2-yl)amino]2,2'-sti;benedisulfonic acid disodium salt. This particular brightener species is commercially marketed under the tradename Tinopal 5BM-GX by Ciba-Gtigy Corporation.<br>
When in the above formula, R1 is anilino, R2 is morphilino and M is a cation such as sodium, the brightener is 4,4'-bis[(4-anilino-6-morprulino-s-triazine-2-yl)amino]2,2'-stilbenedisulfonic acid, sodium salt. This particular brightener species is commercially marketed under the tradename Tinopal AMS-GX by Ciba Geigy Corporation.<br>
The specific optical brightener species selected for use in the present invention provide especially effective dye transfer inhibition performance benefits when used in combination with the selected polymeric dye transfer inhibiting agents hereinbefore described. The combination of such selected polymeric materials (e.g., PVNO and/or PVPVI) with such selected optical brighteners (e.g., Tinopal UNPA-GX, Tinopal 5BM-GX and/or Tinopal AMS-GX) provides significantly better dye transfer inhibition in aqueous wash solutions than does either of these two detergent composition components when used alone. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that such brighteners work this way because they have high affinity for fabrics in the wash solution and therefore deposit relatively quick on these fabrics. The extent to which brighteners deposit on fabrics in the wash solution can be defined by a parameter called the "exhaustion coefficient". The exhaustion coefficient is in general as the ratio of a) the brightener material deposited on fabric to b) the initial brightener concentration in the wash liquor. Brighteners with relatively high exhaustion coefficients are the most suitable for inhibiting dye transfer in the context of the present invention.<br>
Of course, it will be appreciated that other, conventional optical brightener types of compounds can optionally be used in the present compositions to provide conventional fabric "brightness" benefits, rather than a true dye transfer inhibiting effect. Such usage is conventional and well-known to detergent formulations.<br>
The modified polyamines of the present invention useful as cotton soil release agents are suitably prepared by the following methods.<br>
EXAMPLE1 Preparation of PHI 1800 E7<br>
The ethoxylation is conducted in a 2 gallon stirred stainless steel autoclave equipped for temperature measurement and control, pressure measurement, vacuum and inert gas purging, sampling, and for introduction of ethylene oxide as a liquid. A -20 tb. net cylinder of ethylene oxide (ARC) is set up to deliver ethylene oxide as a liquid by a pump to the autoclave with the cylinder placed on a scale so that the weight change of the cylinder could be monitored.<br>
A 750 g portion of polyethyieneimine (PET) (Nippon Shokubal, Epomin SP-018 having a listed average molecular weight of 1800 equating to about 0.417 moles of polymer and 17.4 moles of nitrogen functions) is added to the autoclave. The autoclave is then sealed and purged of air (by applying vacuum to minus 28" Hg followed by pressurization with nitrogen to 250 psia, then venting to atmospheric pressure)  The autoclave contents are heated to 130 °C while applying vacuum. After about one hour, the autoclave is charged with nitrogen to about 250 psia while cooling the autoclave to about 105 °C. Ethylene oxide is then added to the autoclave incrementally over time while dosely monitoring the autoclave pressure, temperature, and ethylene oxide flow rate. The ethylene oxide pump is turned off and cooling is applied to limit my temperature increase resulting from any reaction exotherm. The temperature is maintained between 100 and 110°C while the total pressure it-allowed to gradually increase during the course of the reaction. After a total of 750 grams of ethylene oxide has been charged to the autoclave (roughly equivalent to one mole ethylene oxide per PEI nitrogen function), the temperature is increased to 110 ° C and the autoclave is allowed to stir for an additional hour. At this point, vacuum is applied to remove any residual unreacted ethylene oxide.<br>
Next, vacuum is continuously applied while the autoclave is cooled to about 50 °C while introducing 376 g of a 25% sodium methoxide in methanol solution (1.74 moles, to achieve a 10% catalyst loading based upon PEI nitrogen functions). The methoxide solution is sucked into the autoclave under vacuum and then the autoclave temperature controller setpoint is increased to 130 °C. A device is used to monitor the power consumed by the agitator. The agitator power is monitored along<br>
with the temperature and pressure   Agitator power and temperature values gradually increase as methane 1 is removed from the autoclave and the viscosity of the mixture increases and stabilizes in about 1 hour indicating that most of the methanol has been removed. The mixture is further heated and agitated under vacuum for an additional 30 minutes.<br>
Vacuum is removed and the autoclave is cooled to 105 °C while it is being charged with nitrogen to 250 psia and then vented to ambient pressure. The autoclave is charged to 200 psia with nitrogen. Ethylene oxide is again added to the autoclave incrementally as before while closely monitoring the autoclave pressure, temperature, and ethylene oxide flow rate while maintaining the temperature between 100 and 130 °C and limiting any temperature increases due to reaction exotherm. After the addition of 4500 g of ethylene oxide (resulting in a total of 7 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of PEI nitrogen function) is achieved over several hours, the temperature is increased to 110 °C and the mixture stirred for an additional hour. The reaction mixture is then collected in nitrogen purged containers and eventually transferred into a 22 L three neck round bottomed flask equipped with heating and agitation. The strong alkali catalyst is neutralized by adding 167 g methanesulfonic acid (1.74 moles). The reaction mixture is then deodorized by passing about 100 cu. ft. of inert gas (argon or nitrogen) through a gas dispersion frit and through the reaction mixture while agitating and heating the mixture to 130 °C.<br>
The final reaction product is cooled slightly and collected in glass containers purged with nitrogen.<br>
In other preparations the neutralization and deodorization is accomplished in the reactor before discharging the product.<br>

The solution is cooled to~100°C and neutralized to pH 7 with methanesulfonic acid (Aldrich).

After dissolution, one drop of hydrogen peroxide (Aldrich, 30% by wt. in water) is added to oxidize traces of bisulfite. The solution is stirred for one hour. A peroxide indicator strip shows a very weak positive test. Sodium hydroxide pellets (MCB, 2.5g, 0.0625 moi) we added, followed by diethylene glycol (Fisher, 303.3g, 2,86 mol). The solution is heated at 190C° under argon overnight as water distills from the reaction mixture. A 13C-NMR(DMSO-d6) shows that the reaction is complete by the disappearance of the isethionate peaks at -53.5 ppm and -57.4 ppm. The solution is cooled to room temperature and neutralized to pH 7 with 57.4g of a 16.4% solution of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate in diethylene glycol.

The 13C-NMR spectrum of the product shows resonances at -51 ppm (-CH2SO3Na), ~60ppm (-CH2OH), and at -69 ppm, -72 ppm, and -77 ppm for the remaining four methylenes. Small resonances are also visible for the sodium p-toluenesulfonate which formed during neutralization. The<br>

The excess diethylene glycol is removed by adding 0.8 mo!% of monobasic potassium phosphate (Aldrich) as a buffer ajid heating on a Kugelrohr apparatus (Aldrich) at 150C° for ~ 3 hrs. at -I mm Fig to give the desired "SE3" (as defined herein above) as an extremely viscous oil or glass.<br>
EXAMPLE 10 Synthesis of Sodium 2-(2-[2-(2-Hydroxyethoxy)ethoxy]ethoxy}ethanesulfonate Monomer<br>
To a 1L, three neck, round bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, modified Claisen head, condenser (set for distillation), thermometer, and temperature controller (Therm-0-Watch™, I2R) is added isethionic acid, sodium salt (Aldrich, 205.0g, 1.38 mol) and distilled water (-200 ml). After dissolution, one drop of hydrogen peroxide (Aldrich, 30% by wt, in water) is added to oxidize traces of bisulfite  The solution is stirred for one hour. A peroxide indicator strip shows a very weak positive test. Sodium hydroxide pellets (MCB, 5.5g, 0.138 mol) are added, followed by triethylene glycol (Aldrich, 448.7g, 3.0 mol). Optionally, the triethylene glycol can be purified by heating with strong base such as NaOH until color stabilizes and then distilling off the purified glycol for use in the synthesis. The solution is heated at 190C° under argon overnight as water distills from the reaction mixture. A 13C-NMR(DMSO-d6) shows that the reaction is complete by the disappearance of the isethionate peaks at -53.5 ppm and ~57.4 ppm, and the emergence of product peaks at ~5lppm (-CH2SO3Na), ~60ppm (-CH2OH), and at ~67 ppm, -69 ppm, and ~72 ppm for the remaining methylenes.  The solution is cooled to room temperature and neutralized to pH 7 with methanesulfonic acid (Aldrich).  The reaction affords 650g of a 59.5% solution of sodium 2-{2-[2-(2-hydroxyethoxy)ethoxy]ethoxy}ethanesulfonate in triethylene glycol. The excess triethylene glycol is removed by adding 0.8 mol% of monobasic potassium phosphate (Aldrich) is a buffer and heating on a Kugelohr apparatus (Aldrich) at 180C° for -5.5 hrs. at -1 mm Hg to give the desired material as a brown solid. It is found that a more soluble buffer can be more effective in controlling pH during the stripping of excess triethylene glycol. One example of such a more soluble buffer is the salt of N-methylmorpholine with methanesulfonic add. Alternatively, the pH can be controlled by frequent or continuous addition of acid such as methanesulfonic add to maintain a pH near neutral during the stripping of excess glycol.<br>
The material is believed to contain a low level of the disulfonate arising from reaction of both ends of the triethylene glycol with isethionate. However, the crude<br>
material is used without further purification as an anionic capping groups for polymer preparations<br>
Other preparations use a larger excess of triethviene glycol such as 5 to 10 moles per mole of isethionate.<br>

An example of the method of the present invention is outlined below:<br>
The detergent granules comprising cotton soil release polymers are added (99.5 parts/0.5 parts by weight, respectively) together with a 6 Ib. load of previously laundered fabrics (load composition: 10 wt % polyester fabrics/50 wt % polyester-cotton/40 wt */« cotton fabrics) to a Sears KENMORE washing machine. Actual weights of detergent and soil release agent compositions are take to provide a 995 ppm concentration of the former and 5 ppm concentration of the latter in the 1.7 gallon (65 liter) water-fill machine. The water used has 7 grains/gallon hardness and a pH of 7 to 7.5 prior to (abut 9 to about 10.5 after) addition of the detergent and ester compositions.<br>
The fabrics are laundered at 35° C (95° F) for a full cycle (12 min.) and rinsed at 21° C (70° F). the fabrics are then line dried and are exposed to a variety<br>
of soils (by wear or controlled application;.   The entire cycle of laundering and soiling is repeated several limes for each of the detergent compositions. Separate fabric bundles are reserved for use with each of the detergent compositions. AJ1 cotton-containing fabrics display significantly improved whiteness during laundering compared with fabrics which have not beer, exposed to the compositions of the present invention.<br>
Cotton soil release agents of the present invention are especially useful in conventional laundry detergent compositions such as those typically found in granular detergents or laundry bars.
