				<td>The present invention relates to prostanoic acid derivatives as potent ocular hypotensives that are particularly suited for the management of glaucoma.<br><br>
Background of the Invention <br><br>
Description of Related Art <br><br>
Ocular hypotensive agents are useful in the treatment of a number of various ocular hypertensive conditions, such as post-surgical and post-laser trabeculectomy ocular hypertensive episodes, glaucoma, and as presurgical adjuncts. <br><br>
Glaucoma is a disease of the eye characterized by increased intraocular pressure. On the basis of its etiology, glaucoma has been classified as primary or secondary. For example, primary glaucoma in adults (congenital glaucoma) may be either open-angle or acute or chronic angle-closure. Secondary glaucoma results from pre-existing ocular diseases such as uveitis, intraocular tumor or an enlarged cataract. <br><br>
The underlying causes of primary glaucoma are not yet known. The increased intraocular tension is due to the obstruction of aqueous humor outflow. <br><br>
In chronic open-angle glaucoma, the anterior chamber and its anatomic structures appear normal, but drainage of the aqueous humor is impeded. In acute or chronic angle-closure glaucoma, the anterior chamber is shallow, the filtration angle is narrowed, and the iris may obstruct the trabecular meshwork at the entrance of the canal of Schlemm. Dilation of the pupil may push the root of the iris forward against the angle, and may produce pupilary block and thus precipitate an acute attack. Eyes with narrow anterior chamber angles are predisposed to acute angle-closure glaucoma attacks of various degrees of severity. <br><br><br>
Secondary glaucoma is caused by any interference with the flow of aqueous humor from the posterior chamber into the anterior chamber and subsequently, into the canal of Schlemm. Inflammatory disease of the anterior segment may prevent aqueous escape by causing complete posterior synechia in iris bombe, and may plug the drainage channel with exudates. Other common causes are intraocular tumors, enlarged cataracts, central retinal vein occlusion, trauma to the eye, operative procedures and intraocular hemorrhage. <br><br>
Considering all types together, glaucoma occurs in about 2% of all persons over the age of 40 and may be asymptotic for years before progressing to rapid loss of vision. In cases where surgery is not indicated, topical b- adrenoreceptor antagonists have traditionally been the drugs of choice for treating glaucoma. <br><br>
Certain eicosanoids and their derivatives have been reported to possess ocular hypotensive activity, and have been recommended for use in glaucoma management. Eicosanoids and derivatives include numerous biologically important compounds such as prostaglandins and their derivatives. <br><br>
Prostaglandins can be described as derivatives of prostanoic acid which have the following structural formula: <br>
EMI2.1<br><br>
Various types of prostaglandins are known, depending on the structure and substituents carried on the alicyclic ring of the prostanoic acid skeleton. <br><br>
Further classification is based on the number of unsaturated bonds in the side chain indicated by numerical subscripts after the generic type of prostaglandin [e. g. prostaglandin El (PGE1), prostaglandinE2(PGE2)], and on the <br><br><br>
configuration of the substituents on the alicyclic ring indicated bya or3 [e. g. prostaglandinF2a (PGF2p)]. <br><br>
Prostaglandins were earlier regarded as potent ocular hypertensives, however, evidence accumulated in the last decade shows that some prostaglandins are highly effective ocular hypotensive agents, and are ideally suited for the long-term medical management of glaucoma (see, for example, Bito, L. Z. Biological Protection with Prostaglandins, Cohen, M. M. , ed. , Boca Raton, Fla, CRC PressInc., 1985, pp. 231-252; and Bito, L. Z., Applied Pharmacology in the Medical Treatment of Glaucomas Drance, S. M. and Neufeld, A. H. eds. , New York, Grune &amp; Stratton, 1984, pp. 477-505. Such prostaglandins includePGF2a, PGFla, PGE2, and certain lipid-soluble esters, such as Ci to C2 alkyl esters, e.g. 1-isopropyl ester, of such compounds. <br><br>
Although the precise mechanism is not yet known experimental results indicate that the prostaglandin-induced reduction in intraocular pressure results from increaseduveoscleral outflow [Nilsson et. al. , Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. <br><br>
(suppl), 284 (1987)]. <br><br>
The isopropyl ester ofPGF2a has been shown to have significantly greater hypotensive potency than the parent compound, presumably as a result of its more effective penetration through the cornea. In 1987, this compound was described as"the most potent ocular hypotensive agent ever reported" [see, for example, Bito, L. Z. , Arch. Ophthalmol. 105. 1036 (1987), and Siebold et al., Prodrug 5 3 (1989)]. <br><br>
Whereas prostaglandins appear to be devoid of significant intraocular side effects, ocular surface (conjunctival) hyperemia and foreign-body sensation have been consistently associated with the topical ocular use of such compounds, inparticular PGF2a and its prodrugs, e. g. , its 1-isopropyl ester, in humans. The clinical potentials of prostaglandins in the management of conditions associated with increased ocular pressure, e. g. glaucoma are greatly limited by these side effects. <br><br>
In a series of co-pending United States patent applications assigned to Allergan, Inc. prostaglandin esters with increased ocular hypotensive activity <br><br><br>
accompanied with no or substantially reduced side-effects are disclosed. The co- pending USSN 596,430 (filed 10 October 1990, now U. S. Patent 5,446, 041), relates to certain 11-acyl-prostaglandins, such as11-pivaloyl, 11-acetyl, 11- isobutyryl,11-valeryl, and11-isovaleryl PGF2a. Intraocular pressure reducing 15-acyl prostaglandins are disclosed in the co-pending application USSN 175,476 (filed 29 December 1993). Similarly, 11, 15- 9, 15 and 9,11-diesters of prostaglandins, for example 11,15-dipivaloylPGF2a are known to have ocular hypotensive activity. See the co-pending patent applications USSN Nos. 385,645 (filed 07 July 1989, now U. S. Patent 4,994, 274), 584,370 (filed 18 September 1990, now U. S. Patent 5,028, 624) and 585,284 (filed 18 September 1990, now U. S. Patent 5,034, 413). Recently, we have also shown that 17-napthyl and benzothienyl prostaglandin compounds also have ocular hypotensive activity (USSN 859,770, filed 17 May 2001). The disclosures of all of these patent applications are hereby expressly incorporated by reference. <br><br>
Certain 15,15-dimethyl prostaglandins with antihypertensive, gastric acid secretion inhibition, and smooth muscle stimulant properties, are known to have improved metabolic stability. These are described byPernet et al in US Patent 4,117, 014 (filed 23 December 1976), the disclosure of which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference.<br><br><br><br>

In another aspect of this invention, certain elements of the method making the compounds of the invention are novel and unobvious. One such novel and unobvious element is the application of the use of Baker's yeast as a reducing agent as reported by Brooks and coworkers (Brooks, et.al., "Asymmetric Microbial Reduction of Prochiral 2,2-Disubstituted <br><br><br>
Cycloalkanediones", J. Org.Chem., 1987,52, 3223-3232) in the synthesis of compounds of this invention. In this novel and unobvious application of this reaction, Baker's yeast is used to carry out an asymmetric reduction of a compound of formula VII, which is a 2,2-dialkylcyclopentane-1, 3-dione, to a compound of formulaVIII, which is a 2,2-dialkyl-3 (S) -hydroxycyclopentanone. <br><br>
A compound of formula VIII is then used to prepare compounds of this invention. <br>

Formula VI Formula VII The two alkyl groups,R2 and R3 of the compounds of formula VI and VII, in this reaction are the same as those defined for compounds of Formula I above. <br><br>
In the case where the two alkyl groups are different, a mixture of diastereomers is formed, which can be separated by conventional separation methods to obtain the enantiomerically pure products. <br><br>
Preparationof 2, 2-dialkylcyclopentan-1, 3-diones is well known in the art. One convenient way that a large variety of these compounds can be prepared is by base-mediated alkylation of carbon-2 of the cyclopentane-1,3- dione using an alkyl halide or equivalent compound. This type of reaction is well known in the art. The preparation of three general types of 2,2-dialkylcyclopentan-1, 3-diones using this alkylation reaction is illustrated in Scheme 1. Compounds where one of the alkyl groups is methyl can be prepared by a simple alkylation reaction from commercially available 2- methylcyclopentan-1, 3-dione 1 (Equation 1). In the case neither of the alkyl groups in the 2,2-dialkylcyclopentan-1, 3-dione are methyl (compound 2b), these compounds can be prepared from cyclopentan-1, 3-dione by two consecutive alkylation reactions (Equation 2). In the case where the two alkyl groups in the 2,2-dialkylcyclopentan-1, 3-dione are the same, these alkylation reactions can be <br><br><br>
carried out in a one-pot procedure. In the case where the two alkyl groups to form a cyclic compound incorporating C2 of the cyclopentanone into the ring, otherwise known as a spiroketone, these compounds can be prepared by using a dihaloalkane or equivalent compound to carry out a intermolecular alkylation followed by an intramolecular alkylation (Equation 3), which could be carried out in a one or two pot process. Those skilled in the art will recognize that there are many ways to prepare 2,2-dialkylcyclopentan-1, 3-diones, and the reactions of Scheme 1 are included to illustrate that these compounds can be readily prepared or obtained by those skilled in the art, and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention in any way. <br><br>
In another novel and unobvious aspect of this invention, compounds of the invention represented by FormulaVIII are prepared by a process that comprises the following steps: <br>
EMI11.1<br><br>

All of the compounds encompassed by this invention can be prepared using the methods described above supplemented by methods known to those skilled in the art. The synthesis of several compounds of the invention is illustrated in <br><br><br>
Schemes 2-7. These Schemes that are included herein are merely illustrative and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention in any way. Although there are several ways the reduction of compounds of Formula VI to Formula VII could be incorporated into the synthesis of these compounds, one convenient way to this is shown in Scheme 2. In this Scheme, compound 2 is a compound of Formula VI and compound 3 is a compound of formula VII. <br><br>
However, those skilled in the art will recognize that there are many ways in which the reduction could be used to prepare compounds of this invention. <br><br>

The methods of screening the compounds of this invention for the desired biological activity are illustrated in the following non-limiting examples. Results for example compounds of this invention are included in Table 2. These results are presented purely for illustrative purposes and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention in any way.<br><br>
Radioligand Binding<br><br>
Cells Stably Expressing EPI,EP ?, EP4 ! and FPReceptors<br><br>
HEK-293 cells stably expressing the human or feline FP receptor, or EP1,EP2, or EP4 receptors were washed with TME buffer, scraped from the bottom of the flasks, and homogenized for 30 sec using a Brinkman PT 10/35 polytron. TME buffer was added to achieve a final 40 ml volume in the centrifuge tubes (the composition of TME is 100 mM TRIS base, 20 mM MgCl2,2M EDTA; ION HCl is added to achieve a pH of 7.4). <br><br>
The cell homogenate was centrifuged at 19000 r. p. m. for 20 min at4 C using a Beckman Ti-60 rotor. The resultant pellet was resuspended in TME buffer to give a final 1 mg/ml protein concentration, as determined by Biorad assay. Radioligand binding competition assays vs.[3H-] 17-phenylPGF2a(5 nM) were performed in a1001l1 volume for 60 min. Binding reactions were started by adding plasma membrane fraction. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 4 ml ice-coldTRIS-HC1 buffer and rapid filtration through glass fiber GF/B filters using a Brandel cell harvester. The filters were washed 3 times with ice-cold buffer and oven dried for one hour. <br><br>
[3H-] PGE2 (specific activity 180 Ci mmol) was used as the radioligand for EP receptors.[3H] 17-phenylPGF2a was employed for FP receptor binding studies. Binding studies employingEPI, EP2, EP4 and FP receptors were performed in duplicate in at least three separate experiments. A200gui assay volume was used. Incubations were for 60 min at25 C and were terminated by the addition of 4 ml of ice-cold 50 mMTRIS-HC1, followed by rapid filtration through Whatman GF/B filters and three additional 4ml washes in a cell harvester (Brandel). Competition studies were performed using a final concentration of 5nM[3H]-PGE2, or 5nM[3H] 17-phenylPGF2a and non- <br><br><br>
specific binding determined with10-5M of unlabeled PGE2, or 17-phenylPGF2a, according to receptor subtype studied. <br><br>
METHODS FOR FLIPRTM STUDIES<br><br>
(a) CELL CULTURE <br><br>
HEK-293 (EBNA) cells, stably expressing one type or subtype of recombinant human prostaglandin receptors (prostaglandin receptors expressed:hDP/Gqs5 ; hEPI ;hEP2/Gqs5 ;hEP3A/Gqi5 ;hEP4/Gqs5 ; hFP; hIP ; hTP), were cultured in 100 mm culture dishes in high-glucose DMEM medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM1-glutamine, 250Rg/ml geneticin (G418) and200, ug/ml hygromycin B as selection markers, and 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 g/ml streptomycin and 0.25, ug/ml amphotericin B. <br><br>
(b) CALCIUM SIGNAL STUDIES ON THE FLIPRTM<br><br>
Cells were seeded at a density of5x104 cells per well inBiocoat (D Poly- D-lysine-coated black-wall, clear-bottom 96-well plates (Becton-Dickinson) and allowed to attach overnight in an incubator at37 C. Cells were then washed two times with HBSS-HEPES buffer (Hanks Balanced Salt Solution without bicarbonate and phenol red, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) using a Denley Cellwash plate washer (Labsystems). After 45 minutes of dye-loading in the dark, using the calcium-sensitive dye Fluo-4 AM at a final concentration of 2RM, plates were washed four times with HBSS-HEPES buffer to remove excess dye leaving 100gel in each well. Plates were re-equilibrated to37 C for a few minutes. <br><br>
Cells were excited with an Argon laser at 488 nm, and emission was measured through a 510-570 nm bandwidth emission filter(FLIPRTM, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Drug solution was added in a 50 RI volume to each well to give the desired final concentration. The peak increase in fluorescence intensity was recorded for each well. On each plate, four wells each served as negative(HBSS-HEPES buffer) and positive controls (standard agonists: BW245C (hDP); PGE, (hEP, ;hEP2/Gqs5 ;hEP/Gqi5 ;hEP,/Gqs5) ;PGF2 (hFP); carbacyclin (hIP) ; U-46619 (hTP), depending on receptor). The <br><br><br>
peak fluorescence change in each drug-containing well was then expressed relative to the controls. <br><br>
Compounds were tested in a high-throughput (HTS) or concentration- response (CoRe) format. In the HTS format, forty-four compounds per plate were examined in duplicates at a concentration of10-5 M. To generate concentration-response curves, four compounds per plate were tested in duplicates in a concentration range between10-5 and10-11 M. The duplicate values were averaged. In either, HTS or CoRe format each compound was tested on at least 3 separate plates using cells from different passages to give an n &gt; 3. <br><br>
