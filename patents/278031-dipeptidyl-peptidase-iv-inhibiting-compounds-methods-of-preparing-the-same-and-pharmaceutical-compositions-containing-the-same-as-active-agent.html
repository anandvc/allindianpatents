				<td>DIPEPTIDYL PEPTIDASE-IV INHIBITING COMPOUNDS,<br>
METHODS OF PREPARING THE SAME, AND<br>
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THE<br>
SAME AS ACTIVE AGENT<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds having excellent inhibitory activity against dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV), methods of preparing the same and pharmaceutical compositions comprising the same as an active agent.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Diabetes has significant adverse serious effects on human health and accompanies various complications. There are two major types of diabetes: type I diabetes mellitus characterized by little or no insulin secretory capacity due to the destruction of pancreatic cells, and type II diabetes mellitus characterized by insulin<br>
deficiency and insulin resistance due to other causes. The incidence of type II diabetes mellitus accounts for 90% or more of total diabetic patients. Representative examples of diabetic complications include hyperlipidemia, hypertension, retinopathy and renal insufficiency (Paul Zimmer, et al., Nature, 2001, 414, 782). Sulfonylureas (stimulation of pancreatic insulin secretion), biguanides (inhibition of hepatic glucose production), α-glucosidase inhibitors (suppression of intestinal glucose absorption), etc. have been used as antidiabetic agents. Recently, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARy) agonists (thiazolidinediones, promotion of insulin sensitivity) are drawing a great deal of attention as promising antidiabetic therapeutics. However, these antidiabetic drugs have adverse side effects such as hypoglycemia, weight gain and the like (David E. Moller, Nature, 2001, 414, 821). To this end, there is an urgent need for development of diabetes therapeutics with decreased side effects, in particular without causing hypoglycemia and weight gain.<br>
Meanwhile, it has recently been found that dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) knockout mice maintains glucagon-like protein 1 (GLP-1) activity and high insulin levels, resulting in decreased blood glucose levels, suggesting the therapeutic feasibility of DPP-IV as an antidiabetic agent (Marguet D. et al, Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, (2000) 97, 6874-6879). GLP-1 is involved in the differentiation and growth of<br>
pancreatic ß-cells in vivo and plays an important role in the production and secretion of insulin. GLP-1 is inactivated by DPP-IV, and DPP-IV inhibitors have been reported to increase insulin secretion via the inhibition of GLP-1 inactivation. DPP-IV inhibitors are also being developed as anti-obesity drugs because GLP-1 contributes to satiety and fullness in rats and slows down intestinal digestion of food, resulting in weight loss. Further, many researchers and institutions have also demonstrated that DPP-IV inhibitors control blood glucose and lipid levels in animal model experiments (Pospislik J. A., et al, Diabetes, (2002) 51, 943-950). In this regard, DPP-IV inhibitors can be considered as potentially useful agents for the treatment of diabetic diseases.<br>
To date, much research for finding and developing beneficial DPP-IV inhibitors has focused on materials in which a cyano group is introduced to a pyrrolidine ring. For example, WO 00/34241 discloses DPP-IV inhibitors represented by the following formula.<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
wherein R is substituted adamantyl, and n is in a range of 0 to 3.<br>
Other inhibitors can be found in WO 04/064778, WO 03/004498, WO 03/082817, and the like. Disclosed in WO 04/064778 DPP-IV are DPP-IV inhibitors represented by the following formula.<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
wherein Ar is unsubstituted or substituted phenyl; R15, R16 and R17 are each independently hydrogen or alkyl; and U, V and W are each independently nitrogen, oxygen, or substituted nitrogen or carbon.<br>
In addition, WO 03/004498 suggests DPP-IV inhibitors represented by the following formula.<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
wherein Ar is unsubstituted or substituted phenyl; R18 is hydrogen or alkyl<br>
; and T is nitrogen or substituted carbon.<br>
Further, WO 03/082817 discloses DPP-IV inhibitors represented by the following formula.<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
wherein Ar is unsubstituted or substituted phenyl; R19, R20 and R21 are each independently hydrogen or alkyl; and Q is nitrogen or substituted carbon.<br>
In a DPP-IV inhibitor-related patent publication WO 06/104356 assigned to the present applicant and entitled "DIPEPTIDYL PEPTIDASE-IV INHIBITING COMPOUNDS", the present inventors have demonstrated extensive and comprehensive effects of compounds represented by Formula I' below.<br>
The compounds of Formula I' are cyclic compounds having rings connected via an amide bond, which are similar to those of DPP-IV inhibitor compounds set forth in the above-mentioned patent publications; however, the molecular structures substituted with a phenyl group, which is represented as Ar or Z in the above<br>
documents, are completely different from the structures substituted with a saturated or unsaturated, 5-membered or 6-membered cyclic moiety as in the present invention. Further, to the best of our knowledge, there is yet no disclosure in the art of DPP-IV inhibitors according to the present invention, having the molecular structure where a lactam ring is substituted at the phenyl position.<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
Further, the inventors of the present invention discovered that the compounds of Formula I' disclosed in the prior patent of the present applicant can exhibit significantly improved inhibitory activity and selectivity for DPP-IV through the introduction of amines having high DPP-IV inhibitory effects into substituent A and the introduction of various substituents (such as hydroxy or carbonyl group) into substituent B.<br>
In particular, taking into consideration recent reports demonstrating that low selectivity of the conventional art for other dipeptidyl peptidases may result in a variety of adverse effects (Lankas, G. R. et al., Potential Importance of Selectivity over Dipeptidyl Peptidases 8 and 9, diabetes, 2005, 548, 2988-1994), the present<br>
invention provides highly significant results in terms of excellent pharmaceutical efficacy and high DPP-IV selectivity of the inventive compounds. Moreover, DPP-IV inhibitor compounds of the present invention having the aforementioned chemical structure and preparation methods thereof have not been disclosed in the related art.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
As a result of a variety of extensive and intensive studies and experiments to solve the problems as described above and to find compounds having superior DPP-IV inhibitory activity and selectivity, the inventors of the present invention have discovered, as will be illustrated hereinafter, that compounds having an optionally substituted lactam ring structure are effective as DPP-IV inhibitors. The present invention has been completed based on these findings.<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to provide DPP-IV inhibitor compounds having a lactam ring structure which is optionally substituted, particularly by hydroxy or carbonyl.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide methods for preparation of the same compounds.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide pharmaceutical compositions comprising the same compounds, and methods for treating or preventing DPP-IV-related diseases, comprising administering an effective amount of the same compounds to a subject in need thereof.<br>

Specifically, a diester compound of Formula 14 is obtained via the Michael addition reaction of a compound of Formula 14 with ethyl acrylate, and a compound of Formula 16 containing an amide group is obtained via the reaction of the resulting diester with ammonia. As can be seen, the reaction proceeds toward a carbonyl group adjacent to halogen, among two esters, due to the electron attraction of one or more halogen atoms contained in the reactant compound. Finally, cyclization is carried out in ethanol in the presence of sodium ethoxide to give a salt compound having sodium attached to a nitrogen atom of an imide. Treatment of the salt<br>
compound with an anhydrous strong acid provides the desired imide compound of Formula 17. The resulting insoluble NaCl solid was removed by simple filtration.<br>

Addition of an acetic anhydride as a solvent and a reactant to the diacid compound of Formula 18 results in the formation of a highly reactive intermediate in the form of an anhydride ring. A compound of Formula 20 is produced by the ring-opening of the intermediate with ammonia. Due to the absence of a strong electron-attracting substituent group unlike in Reaction Scheme 3-1, ammonia can attack carbon atoms of both ketones and therefore two types of amino acid compounds are produced. These amino acid compounds are not detrimental to the subsequent reaction and can therefore be directly used without further separation. Finally, the desired imide compound of Formula 21 is obtained via the cyclization of<br>
compound 20 in the form of amino acid by addition of an acetic anhydride as shown in Step (a).<br>
Unless otherwise stated, starting compounds used in the present invention are known in the art or can be synthesized from known compounds by per se known methods or similar methods thereof.<br>
The compounds of Formula 1 can be isolated and purified from the reaction product by means of conventional methods such as recrystallization, ion electrophoresis, silica gel column chromatography or ion exchange resin chromatography and the like.<br>
As described above, the compounds according to the present invention, starting materials for the preparation thereof and intermediates can be synthesized by various methods, thus those methods should be interpreted to be included within the scope of the present invention in view of the preparation of the compounds of Formula 1.<br>
Further, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition for inhibiting DPP-IV, comprising a compound of Formula 1 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition may contain a compound of the present invention and other chemical components such as diluents, carriers, and the like. Therefore, the pharmaceutical composition may contain a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient, or any combination thereof, if necessary. The pharmaceutical composition facilitates in vivo administration of the compound to a subject organism. Various techniques of administering the compound are known in the art and include, but are not limited to, oral, injection, aerosol, parenteral and topical administrations.<br>
The term "carrier" means a chemical compound that facilitates the incorporation of a compound into cells or tissues. For example, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is a commonly utilized carrier as it facilitates the uptake of many organic compounds into the cells or tissues of an organism.<br>
The term "diluent" defines a chemical compound diluted in water that will dissolve a composition of interest as well as stabilize the biologically active form of the composition. Salts dissolved in buffered solutions are utilized as diluents in the art. One commonly used buffer solution is phosphate buffered saline (PBS) because it mimics the salt conditions of human body fluid. Since buffer salts can control the<br>
pH of a solution at low concentrations, a buffer diluent rarely modifies the biological activity of a compound.<br>
The term "physiologically acceptable" defines a carrier or diluent that is not detrimental to the biological activity and physical properties of the compound.<br>
The compound of the present invention can be formulated into various pharmaceutical dosage forms in accordance with intended use. In the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions in accordance with the present invention, an active agent, more specifically a compound of Formula 1 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may be mixed with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers which can be selected depending on the dosage form to be prepared. For example, the pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention can be formulated into dosage forms suitable for injection or oral administration.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be formulated in a conventional manner using known pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and excipients and presented in unit dosage forms or in multidose containers. The formulations may take such forms as solutions, suspensions or emulsions in oily or aqueous   vehicles,   and   may   contain  conventional   dispersing,   suspending   or<br>
stabilizing agents. Alternatively, the active agent may be in powder form for reconstitution with sterile pyrogen-free water, before use. The compounds of the present invention may also be formulated into suppositories containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides. Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders and granules. Preferable dosage forms are capsules and tablets. It is preferable that tablets and pills be coated. The solid dosage forms for oral administration may be obtained by mixing the compound of the present invention as an active agent with one or more inert diluents such as sucrose, lactose, starch and the like and carriers such as lubricants (for example magnesium stearate), disintegrators, binders and the like.<br>
If necessary, the compounds of the present invention and compositions comprising the same may be administrated in combination with other pharmaceutical agents, for example, other antidiabetic agents.<br>
When the formulation is presented in unit dosage form, the compound of Formula 1 as an active agent can be preferably contained in a unit dosage of about 0. 1 to 1500 mg. The dosage amount of the compound of Formula 1 will be dependent on the subject's weight and age, the nature and severity of the affliction and the judgment of the prescribing physician. For adult administration, the dosage amount<br>
required will be in the range of 1 to 500 mg a day depending on the frequency and strength of the dosage. For intramuscular or intravenous administration to adults, a total dosage amount of about 5 to 300 mg a day will be sufficient. In some patients, the daily dosage will be higher than that.<br>
The present invention provides methods for treating or preventing diseases involving inappropriate activity of DPP-IV by the use of effective amounts of the compounds of Formula 1. Representative examples of DPP-IV-related diseases include, but are in no way limited to, diabetes, obesity and the like as described above. Inter alia, the present invention is preferred to treat and prevent type II diabetes mellitus. The term "treating" means ceasing or delaying progress of diseases when the compounds of Formula 1 or compositions comprising the same are administered to subjects exhibiting symptoms of diseases. The term "preventing" means ceasing or delaying symptoms of diseases when the compounds of Formula 1 or compositions comprising the same are administered to subjects exhibiting no symptoms of diseases, but having high risk of developing symptoms of diseases.<br>

Experimental Example 1: Assay of DPP-IV inhibitory activity<br>
Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV), known as serine protease, was obtained by a modification of the known method (Tanaka T. et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, (1994) 91,3082-3086), which comprises cloning, purification by use of Baculovirus and activation steps. DPP-IV was used to test the pharmaceutical efficacy of candidate inhibitors as follows. The cloned DPP-IV was expressed in Baculovirus, which was purified by a nickel column and then subjected to dialysis. The inhibitors synthesized in Examples were tested to determine the DPP-IV inhibitory activity thereof using a fluorescent substrate, Ac-Gly-Pro-AFC. Enzymatic reactions were conducted for various concentrations of inhibitors, using 100 |J M Ac-Gly-Pro-AFC at 25°C in a buffer solution containing 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), with the concentration of DPP-IV being 7.1 nM. IC50 values of the inhibitors were determined by measuring the amount of fluorescence so emitted in a fluorescence spectrometer after allowing an enzymatic reaction for 1 hour, and then calculating the concentration of inhibitors exhibiting 50% inhibition of the total enzymatic reaction. Spectra MAX GeminiXS fluorescence spectrometer (Molecular Device Co.) was used as the fluorescence spectrometer and the excitation and<br>
