PROCESS    FOR    PREPARING    3a(β)-7a(p)-DIHYDROXY-6a(β).ALKYL-5β-CHOLANIC ACID.<br>
Description<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention  concerns a process for the preparation  of 3a-7a(p)-<br>
dihydroxy-6a(β)-alkyl-5β-cholanic acids.<br>
STATE OF THE ART<br>
Farnesoid X receptors (FXR) are initially orphan nuclear receptors, identified for<br>
the first time from a cDNA library of rat liver (B,M Forman et al., CelL 81:687-693<br>
(1995)), they are members of the family of nuclear receptors of ligand-activated<br>
transcription factors,  including the receptors of steroid,  retinoid  and  thyroid<br>
honnones(DJ. IWangelsdorf, et al, Ce//.83:841-850(1995)).<br>
Several bile acids of a natural type bind together and activate FXR in physiological<br>
concentrations as described in WOOO/37077 and in particular chenodeoxycholic,<br>
deoxycholic, litocholic acids and the relative conjugates with taurine and glycine.<br>
It is also believed that FXR are involved in the regulation of the homeostasis of bile<br>
acids and of cholesterol.<br>
WO02/072598 describes 3-a,7-a-dihydroxy-6a-alkyl-(allyl)-5p-cholanic acids with<br>
general fonnula (A)<br><br>
in which R' is ethyl, propyl or allyl which are also agonists of Farnesoid X receptors.<br><br>
In particular the compound with formula (I) in which R' = ethyl is two magnitude order more powerful than chenodeoxycholic acid, the most powerful natural FXR<br>
agonist<br>
The compounds with general formula (A), used in particular to increase HDL<br>
cholesterol, to lower triglycerides for the prevention and treatment of hepatic<br>
diseases of cholestatic origin,  are prepared with a process  comprising the<br>
following stages:<br>
i) reacting 3-a-hydroxy-7-keto-5|3-cholanic acid of formula (11)<br><br>
with dihydro pyrane to obtain the corresponding 3-a-tetrahydropyranyloxy-7-keto-5β-choIanic acid of formula (B)<br><br>
ii) reacting the compound (B) with an alkyl bromide with formula R'Br in which R' has the meanings indicated above, to obtain the compound (C)<br><br><br>
iv) hydrolysing (D) to give the compounds (A).<br>
Even though this process comprises only few stages, it presents a series of<br>
drawbacks.<br>
Firstly, in all stages the reaction products are purified on a chromatographic<br>
column, namely a very expensive separation method that cannot be realised on an<br>
industrial scale.<br>
Moreover the reaction yield in stage (ii) is extremely low (12-13%), with a<br>
considerable decrease in the global yield, which is lower than 3.5%.<br>
Moreover, still in this stage, hexamethylenphosphonamide is used as a reactant,<br>
which is a known cancerogenic agent<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The Applicant has now found a process which makes it possible to obtain both<br>
compounds with general formula (I)<br><br><br>
in which the dashed bond (—) in position 6 and 7 indicates that the substituent<br>
may be in position a or β chosen in the class consisting of;<br>
i) 3-a,7-a-dihydroxy-6-a-alkyl-5β-cholanic acid with general formula (lA)<br><br>
ii) 3-a,7-a-dihydroxy-6-β-alkyl-5|3-choIanic acid with general formula (IB)<br><br><br>
jjj) 3-a,7-β-dihyclroxy-6-a-alkyl-5β-cholanic acid with general formula (IC)<br><br>
in which R is a linear or branched C1-C5 alkyl. comprising the following stages a) esterifiying 3a-hydroxy-7-keto-5β -cholanic acid (II)<br><br>
in methanol in an acidic environment to obtain methyl 3a-hydroxy-7-keto-53-cholanate (III),<br><br><br>
b)	Silylating methyl 3a-hydroxy-7-keto-5β -Cholanate (ill) with trimethylchlorosilane<br>
to obtain the corresponding 3-a-trimethylsiloxy-7-keto-5β -cholanate (IV),<br><br>
c)	Silylating methyl 3a-trimethylsiloxy-7-keto-5(3-cholanate (IV) obtained in stage<br>
(b) with trimethylchlorosilane in the presence of a strong base to obtain methyl<br>
3a-,7a-di-trimethylsiloxy-6-en-5β -cholanate (V),<br><br>
d)	Reacting methyl 3a-Ja-di-trimethylsiloxy-6-en-5p-cholanate (V) with the<br>
aldehyde R-CHO in which R has the meanings indicated above and a Lewis<br>
acid, to obtain methyl 3a-hydroxy-6-alkylidene-7-keto-5p-cholanate (VI),<br><br><br>
e)	hydrolysis   of   methyl   3a-hydroxy-6-alkylidene-7-keto-5β -cholanate   to   3a-<br>
hydroxy-6-alkylidene-7-keto-5p-colanic acid (VII).<br><br>
f)	hydrogenating   3a-hydroxy-6-alkylidene-7-keto-5p-cholanic   in   an   aqueous<br>
alkaline environment with Pd/C to 3a-hydroxy-6|3-aIkyl-7-keto-5p-choIanic acid<br><br><br>
g) optionally heat treating the inteimediate (VIII) in an aqueous alkaline environment to obtain the corresponding 3a-hydroxy-6a-aIkyl-7-keto-5(3-cholanic (IX)<br><br>
h) reducing the ketonic group in position (7) to 7-hydroxy group of the intermediate (VIII) or (IX) according to one of the following alternative operating conditions: h') reducing 3a-hydroxy-6a-alkyl-7-keto-5p-cho!anic compound (IX) with metallic hydride to 3a-,7a-di-hydroxy-6a-alkyl -5p-cholanic acid (lA), h") reducing 3a-hydroxy-6a-alkyl-7-keto-5β -cholanic compound (IX) in the presence of sodium and alcohol and obtaining 3a-,7β -di-hydroxy-6a-alkyl-5β -colanic (IC);<br>
h'") reducing 3a-hydroxy-6p-alkyl-7-keto-5|3-cholanic (VIII) in the presence of a metallic hydride to 3a-,7a-di-hydroxy-6(3-alkyl-5β -cholanic (IB). The process according to the present invention in particular for obtaining 3a-,7a-di-hydroxy-6a-aIkyl-5|3-cholanic acids (lA) presents considerable advantages with respect to the known process described above. In fact, although it contemplates a larger number of stages, it allows the product with formula (1) to be obtained with decidedly satisfactory global yields (24.6%), in any case decidedly higher than those of the known process. Moreover, the intermediates do not need to be purified by chromatography and the use of reagents, such as the highly toxic hexamethylenphosphonamide is avoided.<br><br>
Lastly, with the process of the present invention and as shown above, it is possible to obtain the new compounds of fomiula (IB) and (IC) which may be used a hepatoprotectors in particular for the treatment and prevention of hepatic diseases of cholestatic origin.<br>
The present invention therefore concerns phamnaceutical compositions containing as active principle at least one of the acids (l-B) and (l-C) and the respective pharmaceutically acceptable salts in combination with suitable excipients and/or<br>
diluents.<br>
