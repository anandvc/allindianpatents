				<td>Technical field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a sari guard mounting structure for a motorcycle and more particularly, to a structure of suitable mounting a sari guard provided on one side of a rear wheel of a motorcycle.<br>
Related Art<br>
In a region where a motorcycle is used such that a<br>
woman dressed in long and loose clothes such as a sari sits sideways on a rear seat of the motorcycle, the motorcycle is provided with a sari guard which is disposed on one side of a rear wheel in such a manner as to extend in the vertical direction. [0003]<br>
The sari guard is occasionally provided such that a lower portion serves as a sari-side step projecting sideward, outward; an upper portion is mounted on a body portion over a rear wheel; and a lower front portion is supported by one of step holders on which steps for riding in a saddling manner are provided. [0004]<br>
An example of a structure for mounting such a step member is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Hei 9-86465.  In this example, a body frame extends obliquely, upward, rearward in a space under a seat, and step frames, which extend rearward from a front portion of a rear wheel substantially in the horizontal direction, being bent on both sides of the rear wheel, and extend upward, are mounted on a rear portion of the body frame; and passenger's steps are mounted on the step frames. [0005]<br>
[Problem to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
The sari-side step of the sari guard and the saddling steps (for riding in a saddling manner) provided on the steps holders are all used as steps for allowing the feet of a passenger to be put thereon, and accordingly, in order to improve a riding comfort, it is expected to suppress vibration by cutting off transmission of vibration from an engine or the like as much as possible. [0006]<br>
In the related art structure where the sari guard is rigidly mounted on a body side, however, vibration of an engine or the like is directly, transmitted to each of the steps.  In view of the foregoing, an object of the present invention is to improve a vibration-proof performance of each of steps. [0007]<br>
[Means for Solving the Problem]<br>
To solve the above-described problem, according to the present invention, there is provided a sari guard mounting structure for a motorcycle in which a sari guard having a step portion is disposed on one side of a rear wheel and an upper portion of the sari guard is mounted on a body portion over the rear wheel, characterized in that step holders for mounting steps for riding in a saddling manner are provided on side portions of a body in front of<br>
the rear wheel in such a manner as to extend rearward, and a front portion of the sari guard is supported on one of the step holders through an elastic member.<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a sari guard mounting structure for a motorcycle in which a sari guard having a step portion is disposed on one side of a rear wheel and an upper portion of said sari guard is mounted on a body portion over the rear wheel, characterized in that<br>
step holders for mounting the passenger's steps for riding in a saddling manner are provided on side portions of a body in front of the rear wheel in a manner as to extend rearward, and a front portion of said sari guard is supported on one of said step holders through an elastic<br>
member.<br><br>
[Effect of the Invention]<br>
Since a lower front portion of the sari guard is<br>
supported on one of the steps holders through an elastic<br>
member, the sari guard is elastically supported on the step<br>
holder. As a result, it is possible to suppress<br>
transmission of vibration to the sari-side step by the step<br>
holder, and also to suppress -transmission of vibration to<br>
the steps for riding in a saddling manner by the sari<br>
guard.	<br>
Accordingly, transmission of vibration to each step of the sari guard and steps holders can be simultaneously prevented.  In addition, by allowing the supporting portion between the upper portion of the sari guard and the body portion to be of an elastically supporting structure, the vibration-proof performance of each step can be further improved.<br>

[Embodiment of. the Invention]<br>
Hereinafter, an embodiment in which the present<br>
invention is applied to a motorcycle will be described with reference to the drawings.  Fig. 1 is a general side view of a motorcycle according to this embodiment; Fig. 2 is a plan view of the motorcycle shown in Fig. 1; Fig. 3 is a view of a sari guard mounting structure as seen from a rear side of a vehicular body (in the direction shown by an arrow A in Fig. 1); Fig. 4 is a sectional view taken on line 4-4 of Fig. 1, showing a structure of mounting an upper portion of a sari guard; Fig. 5 is a side view showing a supporting portion supported by a step holder; Fig. 6 is a sectional view taken on line 6-6 in Fig. 5; Fig. 7 is a side view of the sari guard; and Fig. 8 is a top view of the sari guard (as seen from the direction shown by an arrow B in Fig. 7). [0011]<br>
First, a schematic structure of the motorcycle will be described with reference to Figs. 1 and 2. A front wheel 1 is supported between a pair of right and left leg portions of a telescopic type front fork 2. The front fork 2 is connected to a head pipe 5 through a bottom bridge 3 and a top bridge 4. [0012]<br>
The head pipe 5 turnably supports a steering shaft 6 around which the front fork 2 is turnable.  A pipe-like<br>
main frame 7 is welded to front edge portions of the down<br>
pipes 8.<br>
[0013]<br>
A handlebar 9 is supported on the top bridge 4, and<br>
a front cowl 10 is supported in front of the top bridge 4<br>
and the bottom bridge 3. An instrument panel 11, a head<br>
lamp 12 and a horn 13 are disposed inside the front cowl<br>
10, and a number plate 14 is mounted at a lower end portion<br>
of the front cowl 10.<br>
[0014]<br>
The main frame 7 exten.ds rearward substantially in the horizontal direction, being bent downward, and is connected to a pivot bracket 15. A four-cycle engine 16 is supported by the pivot bracket 15 and the down pipes 8.<br>
[0015]<br>
Front end portions of rear swing arms 18 are turnably connected to a pivot 17 of the pivot bracket 15, and a rear wheel 19 is supported by rear end portions of the rear swing arms 18. A chain 22 is wound around a driven sprocket 20 provided coaxially with the rear wheel 19 and a drive sprocket 21 of the four-cycle engine 16. [0016]<br>
A pair of right and left seat rails 23 extend rearward from the vicinity of the bent portion of the main<br>
frame 7, and rear stays 24 are obliquely connected between<br>
intermediate portions of the seat rails 23 and the pivot<br>
bracket 15.<br>
[0017]<br>
A reinforcing plate 25 is provided in the vicinity<br>
of each of the connecting portions between the seat rails<br>
23 and the rear stays 24, and a damper 26 of a rear wheel<br>
suspension is provided between the reinforcing plate 25 and<br>
a rear portion of the rear swing arm 18.<br>
[0018]<br>
A sari guard 27 is disposed on one side surface<br>
(left side in this embodiment) of the rear wheel 19 in such a manner as to extend in the vertical direction.  An upper portion of the sari guard 27 is mounted to one of the reinforcing plates 25, and a lower portion of the sari guard 27 constitutes a sari-side step 28 projecting downward.  A bracket 29 is provided on a lower front portion of the sari guard 27. [0019]<br>
The lower front portion of the sari guard 27 is supported on a rear portion of one of step holders 30 through the bracket 29.  The step holders 30 are a pair of right and left members which are mounted on right and left sides of the pivot bracket 15 in such a manner as to be<br>
coaxial with the pivot 17 and extend longer rearward. [0020]<br>
Each of the right and left step holders 30 has a driver's step 32 mounted on its front end portion side and also has a passenger's step 31 mounted on its rear end portion side. The rear end portion of the left step holder 30 extends rearward from the passenger's step 31 and is connected to the bracket 29. [0021]<br>
In addition, the passenger's steps 31 and the driver's steps 32 are steps for riding in a saddling manner.  In the figures, reference numeral 33 indicates a carburetor; 34 is an air cleaner; 35 is a fuel tank; 36 is a tandem seat; and 37 is a rear cowl. [0022]<br>
Next, a structure of the sari guard 27 will be described.  Referring first to Figs. 7 and 8, the sari guard 27 includes a peripheral frame 40 composed of a pipe member formed into an approximately quadrilateral shape in a side view. A lower end of a mounting plate 41 is mounted on an intermediate portion of an upper side portion 40a of the peripheral frame 4 0. [0023]<br>
The mounting plate 41 is a plate-like member<br><br>
extending upward from the upper side portion 40a. An embossed portion 42 is formed at a central portion of the mounting plate 41, and elastically mounting portions 43 are formed at front and rear portions of an upper end portion of the mounting plate 41. [0024]<br>
The sari-side step 28 is formed in such a manner as to connect a portion, in the vicinity of the bracket 29, of a front side portion 4Ob to an intermediate portion of a lower side portion 40c.  The sari-side step 28 is provided with a reinforcing lower pipe .44 and wire rods 45 crossing the reinforcing lower pipe 44. With this configuration, the sari-side step 28 allows the feet of a passenger who sits sideways on a passenger space of the tandem seat 26 to be put thereon. [0025]<br>
Reinforcing vertical pipes 46a, 46b and 46c, spaced from each other at intervals in the longitudinal direction, are provided between the upper side portion 40a and the lower side portion 40c, and a plurality of wire rods 47 crossing the reinforcing vertical pipes 46a, 46b and 46c are provided between the front side portion 4Ob and a rear side portion 40d. [0026]<br><br>
Upper end portions of two pieces of the reinforcing vertical pipes 46b and 46c on the rear side are welded on a rear side of the mounting plate 41. An upper end portion of the bracket 29 is welded to the sari-side step 28, and a lower end portion of the bracket 29 projects obliquely, downward, forward.  It should be noted that the reinforcing vertical pipes 46a, 46b and 46c and the wire rods 47 are not shown in Fig. 3 for simplification; the wire rods 47 are partially shown in Fig. 8; and for the sari-guard 27 in Fig. 3, part of the peripheral frame 40 is omitted. [0027]<br>
Next, a structure of mounting the sari guard 27 will be described.  First, the upper portion of the sari guard 27 is, as is apparent from Fig. 3, rubber-mounted on the reinforcing plate 25 by the elastically mounting portions 43 provided on the upper end portion of the mounting plate 41.  The elastically mounting portions 43 are not viewed from the exterior because they are covered with a side portion of the rear cowl 37. [0028]<br>
As is apparent from Fig. 4, each of the elastically mounting portions 43 is elastically supported on the body side by placing a washer 51 on a mounting hole 50 portion, fitting a cylindrical mount rubber 52 in the washer 51 and<br><br>
the mounting hole 50, allowing a bolt 54 to pass through a flanged collar 53 inserted in the mount rubber 52, and screwing a leading end of the bolt 54 in a nut 55 previously welded on the reinforcing plate 25. [0029]<br>
As is apparent from Figs. 5 and 6, the bracket 29 is composed of two supporting plates 60 and 61 spaced from each other at a gap in the width direction of the vehicular body.  The supporting plates 60 and 61 have through-holes 62 and 63 formed at opposed positions, respectively.  One end of the supporting plate 60. is welded to the lower side portion 40c and one end of the supporting plate 61 is welded on the sari-side step 28.  The supporting plates 60 and 61 have end portions 60a and 61a bend in the width direction of the vehicular body respectively, and the end portions 60a and 6la are superimposed and integrally welded to each other. [0030]<br>
The rear end portion of the step holder 30 is inserted between the supporting plates 60 and 61.  A through-hole 64 is formed in the rear end portion of the step holder 30, and a cylindrical mount rubber 65 is previously fitted in the through-hole 64.  A collar 66 is inserted in the mount rubber 65.<br><br>
[0031]<br>
The collar 66 is matched with the right and left<br>
through-holes 62 and 63.  A bolt 67 is inserted in the through-holes 62 and 63 and the collar 66 from either of the through-holes 62 and 63 to the other thereof, and a<br>
leading end of the bolt 67 projecting from the other of the through-holes 62 and 63 is screwed in a nut 68.  Thus, the rear end of the step holder 30 is connected to the bracket 29 through the mount rubber 65.<br>
[0032]<br>
Next, the function of jthis embodiment will be described. When a passenger dressed in a sari sits sideways on the tandem seat 36, she can put her feet on the sari-side step 28.  In this case, the hem of the sari can be prevented from entering on the rear wheel 19 side by the sari guard 27. [0033]<br>
At this time, the upper portion of the sari guard 27 is elastically supported on the reinforcing plate 25 as the body side portion by the elastically mounting portions 43 of the mounting plate 41 through the mount rubbers 52, and the lower front portion of the sari guard 27 is elastically supported on the rear end portion of the step holder 30 by the bracket 29 through the mount rubber 65.<br><br>
[0034]<br>
As a result, vibration of the engine or the like is cut off by these elastically supporting members, so that transmission of the engine vibration or the like to the sari guard 27 can be suppressed. This makes it possible to improve the vibration-proof performance of the sari-side step 28, and hence to enhance the riding comfort of a passenger. [0035]<br>
At the same time, the rear end portion of one of the step holders 30 is elastically supported by the sari guard 27, so that transmission of vibration to the passenger's steps 31 is suppressed. As a result, even when a passenger rides in a saddling manner and puts the feet on the passenger's steps 31, it is also possible to improve the vibration-proof performance and hence to enhance the riding comfort. [0036]<br>
The present invention is not limited to the above embodiment and can be variously changed.  For example, the elastically mounting portions 43 of the mounting plate 41 are not necessarily elastically mounted on the body side but can be rigidly mounted thereon.  However, in the case where the elastically mounting portions 43 are elastically<br><br>
mounted on the body side, the vibration-proof performance of the entire sari guard 27 can be correspondingly enhanced. [0037]<br>
Further, as the elastically supporting structures of the elastically mounting portions 43 and the bracket 29, there may be used various known structures. For example, the mount rubbers are not necessarily used but various elastic members can be used, and the bracket 29 is not necessarily of the double structure of the supporting plates 60 and 61 but may be of. a single structure of either of the supporting plates 60 and 61.<br>
