				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
CARBOSTYRIL COMPOUND<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a carbostyril compound.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The trefoil factor family (TFF) is a group of highly<br>
stable peptides having a three-leaved clover-like structure<br>
formed from six cysteine residues. Three TFF peptides (TFF1 TFF2<br>
and TFF3) have been identified so far in humans. TFFs are present<br>
in mucus-related tissues such as the alimentary tract and are<br>
secreted mainly by mucus-secreting cells. The expression of TTF<br>
peptides is up-regulated in the vicinity of damaged mucosa and in<br>
regenerating glands. It is reported that the main functions of<br>
TFF peptides lie in the augmentation of cell migration processes<br>
(motogenic effects) protection of cells and suppression of<br>
apoptosis [Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology Vol. <br>
732(2003)].<br>
TFF2 is a peptide of 106 amino acid residues initially<br>
isolated from porcine pancreas. The TFF2 peptide is abundant in<br>
the gastric mucous neck cells the pyloric region of the stomach<br>
the mucosa surrounding ulcers the regenerative mucosa the<br>
overlying mucus layer Brunner's glands and so forth.<br>
It has been confirmed with experiments using rats that<br>
TFF2 prevents the development of colitis and gastric ulceration<br>
and also accelerates the healing thereof [Gastroenterology 108:<br>
108-116(1995) Gastroenterology 110: 489-497(1996) Alim.<br>
Pharmacol. Ther. 14: 1033-1040(2000) Gut 45: 516-522(1999)<br>
Gut 44: 636-642 1999 and J. Leukoc. Biol. Vol. 75: <br>
223(2004)].<br>
Other experiments show that indomethacin-induced<br>
gastric ulcers are exacerbated in TFF2 knockout mice [J. Clin.<br>
Invest. Vol. 109: 193-204(2002)].<br>
Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 32: 519-527(2002) discloses the<br>
ability of TFF2 to stabilize mucus.<br>
Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. Vol. 29: 458-464(2003)<br>
teaches that TFF2 might be involved in regulating the<br>
proliferation of damaged airway epithelia.<br>
It can be understood from the above that TFF2 plays key<br>
roles in protection against and repair of mucosal injury. With<br>
regard to diseases which are likely to be cured with TFF2<br>
improved therapeutic effects are expected by a promotion of<br>
endogenous TFF2 production.<br>
Gastroenterology 126: 796-808(2004) discloses that<br>
TFF3 is effective for curing alimentary tract mucositis such as<br>
stomatitis induced by the administration of carcinostatics.<br>
Science Vol. 274: 259-262(1996) and Gastroenterology 119: 691-<br>
698(2000) conclude from the fact that stomach cancer was<br>
developed in TFF1 knockout mice that the TFF1 gene may function<br>
as a tumor suppressor gene. Nature Reviews Molecular Cell<br>
Biology Vol. 4: 721-732(2003) and Int. J. Mol. Med. 12: 3-<br>
9(2003) suggest that TFF2 may act in a similar way as TFF1 and<br>
TFF3.<br>
As compounds for up-regulating TFF2 expression ligands<br>
for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-T (PPART) (e.g.<br>
indomethacin aspirin prostaglandin Ja and troglitazone) are<br>
known [FEES Lett. 488: 206-210(2001) Alim. Pharmacol. Ther. 18<br>
(suppl. 1): 119-125(2003) FEES Lett. 558: 33-38(2004) and Can.<br>
Res. 61: 2424-2428(2001)].<br>
Among various proteins keratinocyte growth factor<br>
(KGF) is reported to enhance TFF2 and TFF3 expressions in rat<br>
lower gastrointestinal tracts [Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr.<br>
Comp. Physiology. 284: R564-R573(2003)].<br>
Some studies teach pharmacological actions of the TFF<br>
peptides themselves and suggest the possibility of their<br>
application in clinical medicine (W092/14837 WO02/102403 and<br>
W002/46226).<br>
W001/002377 and WO02/051419 disclose various compounds<br>
having a substituent containing a 24-dioxo-thazolidinyl or 4-<br>
oxo-2-thioxo-thiazolidinyl moiety on a heteroaryl skeleton such<br>
as a quinoline. These documents also disclose that such compounds<br>
exhibit telomerase inhibitory activity.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>

medium) composed of 500 ml of medium (Iscove's Modified<br>
Dulbecco's Medium, manufactured by SIGMA), 50 ml of fetal<br>
bovine serum (manufactured by SIGMA) immobilized by heating<br>
20 at 56°C for 30 minutes, 5 ml of Penicillin-Streptomycin<br>
liquid (manufactured by SIGMA) and 20 ml of 200 mM L-glutamin<br>
(manufactured by SIGMA), using a culture dish having a<br>
diameter of 10 cm (CORNING Incorporated) placed in a 5% CO2<br>
incubator at 37°C. The cells were washed with buffer<br>
25 (Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline, manufactured by SIGMA)<br>
and subjected to trypsin (0.25% Tripsin-lmM EDTA'4Na,<br>
manufactured by SIGMA) treatment for suspension. The cells<br>
were suspended in the IMDM medium, stained using Trypan Blue<br>
Stain, 0.4% (tradename, Invitrogen Corporation) and the<br>
30 number of cells which did not stain was counted as live cells<br>
using a hemocytometer. The cells were washed once with<br>
buffer (Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline, manufactured by<br>
SIGMA) and 106 live cells were suspended in a solution for<br>
gene transfer (0.25 M Mannitol/0.1 mM CaCl2/0.1 mM MgCl2/0.2<br>
mM Tris-HCl, pH7.2 to 7.4) to which 10 fxg of the prepared<br>
5 plasmid pGL3-hTFF2pro and 2 ng of the plasmid pWLneo were<br>
added. The plasmid-added cell suspension was transferred to<br>
a 1mm cuvette (manufactured by Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.)<br>
and gene introduction into cells was performed by means of<br>
electroporation using an SSH-1 cell fusion apparatus<br>
10 (Shimadzu Corporation). The cells were suspended in the IMDM<br>
medium, inoculated in a culture dish having a diameter of 10<br>
cm (CORNING Incorporated) and cultured in a 5% CO2 incubator<br>
at 37°C for 2 days. Selective culturing was then carried out<br>
using IMDM medium containing 400 pig/ml of Geneticin<br>
15 (manufactured by Invitrogen Corporation). 100 \tl of the<br>
culture medium was then first inoculated into each well of a<br>
96-well plate (manufactured by BD Falcon), and proliferated<br>
cells were sequentially subjected to passaged culturing in a<br>
24-well plate (manufactured by BD Falcon) and further in a 6-<br>
20 well plate (manufactured by BD Falcon) to prepare pGL3-<br>
hTFF2pro-pWL-neo/MKN-45 #6 cells. The obtained pGL3-<br>
hTFF2pro'pWL-neo/MKN-45 #6 cells were suspended in IMDM<br>
medium containing 400 [ig/ml of Geneticin, inoculated into a<br>
96-well plate by means of limiting dilution for cloning to<br>
25 obtain single clone pGL3-hTFF2pro-pWL-neo/MKN-45 #6-2 cells.<br>
The pGL3-hTFF2prod-pWL-neo/MKN-45 #6-2 cells were<br>
proliferated in a 10 cm culture dish, harvested and<br>
cryopreserved.<br>
30 (3) The hTFF2 genetic reporter assay using pGL3-<br>
hTFF2pro • pWL-neo/MKN-45 #6-2 cell line<br>
pGL3-hTFF2pro • pWL-neo/MKN-45 #6-2 was thawed from the<br>
frozen state for use. The cells were inoculated into IMDM<br>
medium containing 400 ng/ml of Geneticin in a 10 cm culture<br>
dish and sequentially passaged every 3 to 5 days. During the<br>
5 passage culturing, the cells were washed with buffer<br>
(Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline, manufactured by SIGMA),<br>
and tripsin (0.25% Tripsin-lmM EDTA-4Na, manufactured by<br>
SIGMA) was added to separate the cells by treatment for 5<br>
minutes at 37°C. The cell suspension was collected by adding<br>
10 IMDM medium, and the cells were stained using Trypan Blue<br>
Stain, 0.4% (tradename, Invitrogen Corporation) and the<br>
number of cells which did not stain was counted as live cells<br>
using a hemocytometer. A cell survival rate of 90 % or<br>
higher was confirmed prior to the live cells being used for<br>
15 the hTFF2 genetic reporter assay.<br>
A day before test compounds were added, 100 \il of the<br>
cell suspension containing about 7.5 x 104 cells was<br>
inoculated into each well of 96-well plates (manufactured by<br>
20 COSTAR) and cultured in a 5 % CO2 incubator at 37 °C. The<br>
test compounds were prepared to have a concentration 200<br>
times the final measurement concentration with<br>
dimethylsulfoxide (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.). The<br>
test compounds having a predetermined concentration were<br>
25 respectively diluted 100 times with IMDM medium, and 100 \il<br>
of the diluted compounds was dispensed into wells of the 96-<br>
well plates. Demethylsulfoxide was diluted 100 times with<br>
IMDM medium and added to those wells to which test compounds<br>
were not added. After the test compounds were added, the<br>
30 cells were cultured in a 5 % C02 incubator at 37 °C for 24<br>
hours. When the culturing was completed, the culture<br>
supernatant was removed and the 96-well plates were frozen in<br>
a deep freezer (manufactured by SANYO Electric Co., Ltd.).<br>
The 96-well plates were thawed at room temperature when the<br>
luciferase activity was measured, and 100 (xl of PicaGene<br>
5 LT2.0 (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) diluted two times<br>
with buffer (Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline,<br>
manufactured by SIGMA) was added to each well. The plates<br>
were allowed to stand at room temperature for at least 30<br>
minutes and the luciferase activity was measured using a<br>
10 Labsystems Luminoskan (manufactured by ICN Biomedicals Inc.).<br>
Taking the average measurement of the<br>
dimethylsulfoxide-added well groups in each plate as 100%, a<br>
percentage for each test compound to the demethylsulfoxide-<br>
15 added well groups (control %) was calculated.<br>
The results are shown in the table below.<br>
In the above table, a TFF2 production promoting<br>
5 activity of 1000% or higher at a test compound concentration<br>
of 10"6 M is indicated as "++" and a TFF2 production promoting<br>
activity of 300% or higher at a test compound concentration<br>
of 10'6 M as " + ".<br>
The above results show that the concentration of<br>
10 compound of the present invention for showing 300 % or higher<br>
TFF2 production promoting activity is less than 10"5 M, and<br>
more preferably less than 10"6 M.<br>

15 Healing effects on rat models with acetic acid-induced<br>
gastric ulcers<br>
(1) Production of gastric ulcer by acetic acid<br>
Rats were fasted from the previous day. A celiotomy<br>
was done in each rat under ether anesthesia, and the<br>
acetic acid solution was injected into the submucosa at the<br>
junction of the body of the glandular stomach and the<br>
pyloric antrum using a disposable syringe to produce a<br>
gastric ulcer.<br>
(2) Test compound administration<br>
5 Each test compound was suspended in a 0.5%<br>
carboxymethylcelullose (CMC) solution at concentrations of<br>
0.75 or 2.5 mg/ml. The rats were orally administrated once a<br>
day for 8 days starting with the forth day from operation at<br>
doses of 3 or 10 mg/kg. A gastric tube and a syringe were<br>
10 used for the oral administration. The volumes of each test<br>
compound and vehicle (0.5% CMC) were 4 ml/kg.<br>
(3) Dissection<br>
On the next day the vehicle and the test compound were<br>
15 finally administrated to the rats, the rats were sacrificed<br>
by exsanguination under anesthesia with ether, and each<br>
stomach was removed. The removed stomachs were fixed in 1 <br>
formalin for 15 minutes, dissected along the greater<br>
curvature of stomach to expose the ulcer, and the ulcerated<br>
20 area was measured.<br>
(4) Measurement of the ulcerated area<br>
The ulcerated area was measured under a stereo<br>
microscope (10 x) with an ocular micrometer (1 mmVgrid), and<br>
25 the percentage healing ratio was calculated. The test<br>
results were shown in the Table 184. The percentage healing<br>
ratio was calculated by the following formula.<br>
