NOVEL STABLE BEADLETS OF LIPOPHILIC NUTRIENTS<br>
Technical Field:<br>
The present invention relates to novel beadlets of lipophilic nutrients and a process for their preparation . The present invention, particularly relates to novel and stable beadlets of lipophilic nutrients, materials or substances, particularly nutrients like carotenoids, tocopherols, tocotrienols, plant sterols and stanols, and lecithins, select omega-3 fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids, more particularly novel beadlets of lutein , lutein esters, zeaxanthin, zeaxanthin esters and a process for their preparation .<br>
The novel beadlets of the present invention are useful in the following ways . Beadlets of lipophilic phytochemicals and nutrients such as oil soluble vitamins, omega 3 fatty acids, plant sterols and plant stanols, resinoids such as guggul sterones and the like, are useful as medicines and dietary supplements. Beadlets of lipophilic nutrients like carotenoids lutein, zeaxanthin, beta-carotene, lycopene, astaxanthin, are useful as antioxidants , micronutrients or as dietary supplements. Beadlets of lutein , lutein esters, zeaxanthin, zeaxanthin esters are also useful in formulating powerful antioxidant nutrients to facilitate reduced risk of macular degeneration, cataract and several forms of cancer.<br>
The novel beadlets of the present invention obtained by coating one lipophilic nutrient, or a mixture of such nutrients, on a central inert core to obtain uniform spherical beadlets. The uniform spherical appearance of these beadlet provides excellent free flowing characteristics which are very desirable for manufacturing and formulating operations. These novel spherical beadlets are convenient to use, and have a stronger visual appeal. The novel beadlets of the present invention are further stabilized synergistically with the use of anti-oxidants and with the application of layers of polymeric materials as coatings on the beadlets as barriers to prevent penetration of light, moisture and air. The beadlets of the present invention are well suited for use as directly compressible ingredients in tablets, or in two-piece capsules.<br>
Background Art:<br>
The role of nutrients and phytochemicals in the promotion of good health through nutrition has now been extended to the likely benefits such as prevention of cancer , and protection against<br><br>
synthesize carotenoids, but many animals-who are unable to synthesize carotenoids- incorporate them from their diet.<br>
These carotenoids are lipophilic molecules which tend to accumulate in lipophilic compartments like membranes or lipoproteins. The lipophilic nature of these compounds also influences their<br>
absorption, transport and excretion in the organism.<br>
i<br>
The unique structure of carotenoids determines not only their colour , but also their potential biological functions and actions. Carotenoids contain a conjugated backbone composed of isoprene units, which are usually inverted at the center of the molecule, imparting symmetry. Changes in geometrical configuration about the double bonds result in the existence of many cis-and trans- isomers. Based on their composition, and structure which is made up at least nine conjugated double bonds responsible for their characteristic colors, carotenoids are divided in two classes, the hydrocarbon class called as carotenes containing only carbon and hydrogen atoms which are non-polar in nature, and oxycarotenoids (or, xanthophylls) which carry at least one oxygen atom in ring structures at the end of their conjugated double bond chain with polar functions like hydroxyl or keto group.<br>
More than 700 different carotenoids have been identified until now, the most common of these being carotenoids like P--carotene, a-carotene, lycopene, and xanthophylls like lutein, zeaxanthin, astaxanthin.<br>
Carotenoids have drawn attention from a health and nutritional support perspective because many epidemiological studies have revealed that an increased consumption of a diet rich in carotenoids is correlated with a diminished risk for several degenerative disorders, including various types of cancer, cardiovascular or ophthalmological diseases. Carotenoids serve as antioxidants in human beings and animals, and the so-called provitamin A carotenoids are used as a source for vitamin A.<br>
Some of the preventive and protective effects that have been associated with carotenoids have been listed below:<br>
â–¡ Antioxidant activity: Carotenoids detected in human serum and tissues, such as P-carotene, lutein zeaxanthin, lycopene and cryptoxanthin are most likely involved in the scavenging of two of the reactive oxygen species, singlet molecular oxygen(102), and<br><br>
peroxyl radicals. Further, they are effective deactivators of electronically excited sensitizer molecules which are involved in the generation of free radicals and singlet oxygen . The efficacy of carotenoids for physical quenching is related to the number of conjugated double bonds present in the molecule which determines their lowest triplet energy level.<br>
Carotenoids also influence cellular signalling and may trigger redox-sensitive regulatory pathways which have a bio-protective effect. In vitro, carotenoids exert antioxidant functions and inhibit carcinogen-induced neoplastic transformation, inhibit plasma membrane lipid oxidation, and cause upregulated expression of connexin 43. These in vitro results suggest that carotenoids have intrinsic cancer chemo-preventive action in humans.<br>
Protecting cells and tissues from oxidative damage:<br>
Age-related macular degeneration is a major cause for irreversible blindness among the elderly in the Western world and affects the macula lutea (yellow spot) of the retina, the area of maximal visual acuity . Lutein and zeaxanthin are the pigments responsible for coloration of this tissue. The occurrence of lutein and zeaxanthin in the macula has specific functions, namely protection of the cells and tissues from UV light and reduced cataract risk.<br>
When skin is exposed to UV light, erythema is observed as an initial reaction. There is evidence from in vitro and in vivo studies that 3-carotene prevents photo-oxidative damage and protects against sunburn (erythema solare). Such protective effects are also achieved with a dietary intervention using tomato paste, corresponding to a specific dose of lycopene/day. Lycopene and other carotenoids may be used as oral sun protectants and contribute to the maintenance of skin health.<br>
Prostate cancer has become a major public health issue. An important epidemiological finding has been the association between the consumption of tomato products and a lower risk of prostate cancer. Several investigators have proposed that lycopene, a carotenoid consumed largely from tomato products, may be the component responsible for lowering the risk of prostate cancer.<br><br>
Laboratory and clinical studies have been initiated with the goal of assessing the ability of pure lycopene to serve as a chemo-preventive agent for prostate cancer. Other cardio-protective functions provided by Lycopene and other antioxidant nutrients in tomatoes may include the reduction of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, homocysteine, platelet aggregation, and blood pressure.<br>
Tocopherols and Tocotrienols:<br>
Tocopherols(found as a, p, X' Y tocopherols) and tocotrienoIs(found as a, (3, x, y tocotrienols) comprise eight compounds generically called "vitamin E". Vitamin E is a very active antioxidant acting as a free radical and singlet state oxygen scavenger, playing a crucial role in the protection of the skin from free-radical-generating factors such as ultraviolet radiation. As Vitamin E acts as ; an antioxidant, it plays an important role in the stabilization of oils and fats. Vitamin E is the major fat-soluble antioxidant acting in the cellular membrane. The potential role of vitamin E in providing protection against free-radical-mediated diseases has been the subject of many studies. Tocopherol (a-Tocopherol) is the major vitamin E in vivo and exerts the highest biological activity. Tocopherols are present in polyunsaturated vegetable oils and in the germ of cereal seeds, whereas tocotrienols are found in the aleurone and subaleurone layers of cereal seeds and in palm oils. Chemically, tocopherols and tocotrienols are closely related, however, it has been observed that they have widely varying degrees of biological effectiveness. Although a-tocopherol is known as the most abundant and active form of vitamin E in vivo, the role of y-tocopherol, a major form of vitamin E in many plants and diet, has also received attention.<br>
Studies have shown that dietary supplementation with palm tocotrienols for 6 weeks lowered iipid-associated coronary heart disease risk factors significantly, i.e., total serum cholesterol by 20%, LDLâ€”by cholesterol 28% and apo-lipoprotein by 18%<br>
Vitamin E functions as a chain-breaking antioxidant, inhibiting the propagation of lipid peroxidation, and thus preventing membranes or lipoproteins from oxidative damage. This constitutes an important biological function of vitamin E, since the deterioration of cellular membranes is associated with cellular dysfunction and because oxidative modification of lipoproteins plays a role in the formation of the atherosclerotic plaque. Vitamin E is believed to play a key role in protecting red blood cells , strengthening capillary walls and decreasing<br><br>
platelet aggregation . Vitamin E plays a role in bringing nourishment to cells, maintaining muscle and nerve function, and promoting a healthy immune system.<br>
In biological sy-stems, vitamin E is thought to be regenerated by other antioxidants such as ascorbate and glutathione. In addition to antioxidant and anti-atherosclerotic activities , vitamin E exhibits a number of other biological activities, including impact on cellular signaling and prevention of infertility in animals .<br>
Plant Stanols and Sterols:<br>
These are structurally related to cholesterol, but are characterized by an extra ethyl (sitosterol) or methyl group (campesterol) in the side chain..<br>
i As they cannot be synthesized by humans, all plant sterols and stanols in the human body therefore originate from the diet. Sitosterol, campesterol and stigmasterol are the most common plant sterols in nature . Sitostanol and campestanol are saturated plant sterols, w^hich are found in nature in much smaller amounts than plant sterols. Because of their cholesterol-lowering effects, these components are incorporated nowadays into a wide variety of food products, referred to as functional foods.<br>
Different mechanisms have been suggested to explain the cholesterol-lowering activity of plant sterols and stanols. Firstly, plant sterols or stanols may displace cholesterol from mixed micelles , because they are more hydrophobic than cholesterol. This replacement causes a reduction of micellar cholesterol concentrations and consequently lowers cholesterol absorption. Furthermore, plant sterols or stanols might reduce the esterification rate of cholesterol in the enterocyte and consequently the amount of cholesterol excreted via the chylomicrons. Plant sterol and stanol esters have comparable effects on serum LDL cholesterol.<br>
Animal studies have been convincing in showing a decreased level of plaque formation in arteries after consumption of plant sterols or stanols. Whether the reduction in LDL cholesterol after consumption of plant sterol and stanol esters lowers cardiovascular risk in humans remains to be fully proven.<br>
Soybeans are, among other potentially bio-active compounds, rich in plant sterols. Populations with high intakes of soybean-based products, such as Seventh-day Adventists and Mexican<br><br>
Taramuhara Indians, have lower cancer mortality rates, especially of the colon and the prostate. It is therefore tempting to suggest that plant sterols reduce the risk for certain cancers. In vitro cell studies clearly suggested that a possible protective effect of sitosterol on colonic epithelial cell proliferation.<br>
It has also been suggested that sitosterol may beneficially affect prostate cancer. Indeed, it has been reported that men taking 20 mg sitosterol three times a day showed symptomatic improvement of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Clinical improvement was indicated by increased urine flow and decreased residual urinary volume, but no relevant reduction in prostatic volume was observed . Others have found similar beneficial clinical results in men taking 65 mg a day of a sitosterol extract.<br>
Poly-Unsaturated Fatty Acids and Omega-3 Fatty Acids:<br>
Poly-Unsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFAs) are fatty acids with more than one double bond.<br>
Several PUFAs are recognized as 'essential fatty acids' in the normal diet for preventing nutrition-related illnesses. These include linoleic acid(LA), gamma-Iinoleic acid(GLA) and , alpha-linolenic acid( ALA).<br>
Linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids, obtained from plant material in the diet are the precursors in tissues of two families of "essential fatty acids" (EFA): pentaene ( composed of arachidonic acid (AA) and eicosapentaenoic acid(EPA)) and hexaene (docosahexaenoic acid(DHA)) acids. Since these fatty acids all have double bonds three carbons from the methyl end of the chain, they are grouped under the term of  omega -3 fatty acids ( -3 fatty acids).<br>
LA, GLA, and ALA are typically supplemented in diet through products of plant origin, while AA and DHA are currently supplemented in diet through fish oils. The role of EFA such as linoleic, and y-linolenic acids obtained from plant ingredients in the diet is crucial. Without a source of A A or compounds which can be converted into A A, synthesis of PGs would be compromised, and this would seriously affect many normal metabolic processes.<br>
GLA has been claimed to play a role in development and prevention of some skin diseases, diabetes, reproductive disorders, and others .The cardiovascular health benefits of longchain co-3<br><br>
polyunsaturated fatty acids such as AA and DHA have been reported to exert at several different cellular control mechanisms. These include, effects on lipoprotein metabolism, haemostatic function, platelet/vessel wall interactions, anti-arrhythmic actions and also inhibition of proliferation of smooth muscle cells and therefore growth of the atherosclerotic plaque. Dietary supplementation with (o-3 PUFA had a beneficial effect in patients with cystic fibrosis , inflammatory bowel diseases , rheumatoid arthritis , and chronic renal diseases.<br>
Linoleic acid(LA) is abundantly found in vegetable oils and meats. The fatty acid y-linolenic acid (GLA, 18:3(1)6) appears in botanical lipids (seed oils) from Oenothera biennis (evening primrose), Borago officinalis (borage) and Ribes nigrum (black currant) . In the body, LA is converted to GLA, and then to dihomo-Gamma-Linolenic Acid(DGLA) -which plays a curcial role in the production of Prostaglandin El-a hormone-like chemical which prevents platelet aggregation, reduces inflammation, lowers blood vessel and has a role in reducing inflammation and boosting immunity.<br>
The role of arachidonic acid(AA) and docasahexaenoic acid(DHA) in the development of nervous system is well supported , and DHA is additionally related to the development of retina. In fact, several health agencies have recommended that infant feed formulae be fortified with DHA and AA . Currently the main commercial source of AA is from animal viscera, and DHA is fish oil.<br>
Ihe role of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in the proper functioning of the circulatory system is well recognized .There is growing interest in the putative involvement of EPA in some cancers and other diseases. The main commercial source of EPA is fish oil.<br>
I^ecithins:<br>
Commercial lecithin is a multifunctional, flexible and versatile surfactant composed of a number of compounds, predominantly phospholipid, which exhibit their own unique physical and chemical properties under their own optimum conditions. Lecithin is typically obtained for commercial purposes from soy-bean , though it can also be obtained from egg, and a number of other vegetable sources.<br><br>
Physiologically, lecithin is an integral part of all organs and glands. The brain itself contains 25% phospholipids on a dry weight basis. Vital organs such as the liver and reproductive tract, and muscles contain high concentration of phospholipids. Phospholipids are also among the primary building blocks of all cellular membranes. Membrane functions include cellular transport of nutrients and wastes, internal cellular pressure regulation, and ion exchange.<br>
Dietary phospholipids from various origins, particularly polyunsaturated fatty acid phospholipids, such as those of soyabean lecithin, have been reported to have a cholesterol-lowering effect in humans. Commercial soyabean lecithin is a mixture of different lipids in which phosphatidylcholine represents only 25% of the lipid lecithin. The other major lipids are triacylglycerols (20-25%) and phosphatidylethanolamine (20%).<br>
Lecithin contains a nutrient called phosphatidylcholine (PC) that is presumed to be responsible for its health-promoting effects. PC is an important building block and versatile nutrient for cell imembranes. It is crucial to the survival and function of all living cells, especially cells of the liver, one of the body's most vital organs. PC is offered commercially in the form of refined lecithins-typically standardized on PC ranging from around 20% in viscous paste form to over 90% in wax-like form.<br>
When PC is consumed, it is broken down into the nutrient choline rather than being carried directly to cell membranes. Choline acts like folate, TMG (trimethylglycine), and SAMe (S-adenosylmethionine) to promote methylation. It is also used to make acetylcholine, a nerve chemical essential for proper brain function. PC acts as a supplier of choline, which is needed for cell membrane integrity and to facilitate the movement of fats in and out of cells. It is also a component of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and is needed for normal brain functioning, particularly in infants. Although the human body can synthesize choline, additional amounts from the diet are considered essential under certain circumstances.<br>
A number of products are seen in the international market claiming the role of lecithin in supporting a number of nutritional and metabolic functions such as:<br>
-	Improved memory functioning<br>
-	Facilitate lipid metabolism and digestion of fats<br>
-	Facilitating the elimination of toxins from the liver<br>
-	Facilitate a healthy serum hpid profile and thereby protect against atherosclerosis<br>
-	Prevention of gallstones.<br><br>
Other Lipophilic Nutrients in Nutrition:<br>
Lipids are chemically compounds made of fatty acid and fatty acid derivatives. Lipids include products such as vegetable oils, oleoresins, etc. There are numerous applications of lipids in food, nutrition and pharmaceutical industries.<br>
Poly unsaturated fatty acids such as omega-6 linoleic acid and its metabolite gamma-linolenic acid are useful in the treatment of neurodermatitis, eczema and psoriasis. Hemp seed oil is an important industrial product having applications in shaving products, skin care and hair care.<br>
Major vegetable oils of commercial interest are obtained from soya, cotton, copra(coconut), palm-kernel, maize, palm, sunflower, olive, sesame, linseed, hazelnut and walnut oil. Lipophilic substances that have diuretic and cosmetic application include oils of avocado pear, blackcurrant, borage, castor, evening primrose, whea-tgerm and the like.<br>
Issues in Formulating Products With Lipophilic Nutrients:<br>
1.   Difficulty in developing dry-delivery form:<br>
Many nutritional formulations in the industry are in the form of tablets, capsules or dry-mixes. It is a major problem for formulators and manufacturers of such supplements to incorporate lipophilic nutrients such as carotenoids, vitamin E sources like tocopherols and tocotrienols, concentrated forms of PC-rich lecithins, phytosterols and plant stanols, various PUFA rich oils and omega-3 fatty acids singly or in combination with other nutrients into dry forms due to the oily, waxy or viscous nature of these products. Some options like spray dried powders , granules or gelatine beadlets work only with select products, and do not necessarily function well under tabletting systems. Some of the challenges in using lipophilic nutrients are explained below:<br>
a. Carotenoids tend to be unstable at room temperature, and prone to degradation on exposure to light, heat, air and acidic environment. Their life needs to be extended by the use of other stabilizing anti-oxidants such as natural tocopherols, ascorbic acid derivatives and citrate.<br><br>
b.	Another option for stabilizing carotenoids is by delivering the same in a oil medium<br>
to provide the protective cover of the oils within naturally present, or added anti<br>
oxidants. Dry delivery forms are considered more difficult to stabilize.<br>
c.	Tocopherols and tocotrienols are typically found in an oily medium in the presence<br>
of vegetable oils. Such oily products are difficult to use except in the smallest of<br>
doses in dry delivery forms such as tablets without the use of specialized<br>
technologies to convert them to powders, granules or beadlets.<br>
d.	Lecithins rich in the active ingredient PC(20-95%) tend to be viscous pastes or waxy<br>
masses which are not suitable for directly compressible or free-flowing powders.<br>
e.	Phytosterols and plant stanols are oily products which have typically been<br>
supplemented through fat based supplements. Incorporating these into free flowing<br>
or directly compressible dry delivery forms would significantly increase the number<br>
of options for formulators and manufacturers of nutritional supplements.<br>
f.	PUFAs, GLA and Omega-3 Fatty Acids are currently used sparingly and infrequently<br>
in tablet and capsule based supplements due to their oily nature. Conventional dry<br>
delivery conversion technologies do not provide good solutions for free flowing,<br>
directly compressible beadlets.<br>
2.   Difficulties in Stabilizing Lipophilic Nutrients :<br>
By nature , carotenoids are unstable at room temperature. Their stability is affected by light, heat, air (oxygen) and acidic environment. It is known that their stability can be enhanced by the ciddition of certain stabilizing antioxidants such as natural tocopherols, ascorbic acid derivatives and citrate.<br>
Carotenoids and other hpophilic nutrients are typically used as ingredients for nutritional supplement formulations either as dispersions in oil or as powders, granules or beadlets for making tablets or encapsulation in capsule. In the form of oil dispersion, these nutrients are generally encapsulated in soft gelatin capsules.   Some of these, such as carotenoids are also<br><br>
manufactured as cold water dispersible powder for use in fruit juices and other aqueous beverages. Out of these three forms , beadlets have the advantage of being suitable for further formulation into compressed tablets or encapsulated in hard gelatin capsules<br>
At present beadlets of carotenoids and other lipophilic nutrients are typically manufactured by spray drying a mixture of said active nutrients and gelatin along with sucrose, and stabilizers. In such beadlets the carotenoid / lipid particles are protected from light and oxygen in the matrix of gelatin and sucrose formed during the spray drying process in which matrix, the carotenoid/ lipoid particles are embedded. The spray dried product is made less cohesive by covering with starch.<br>
A typical process of preparing such beadlets, as described in US patent no. 3998753 involves following main steps:<br>
a.	Gelatin, sugar , preservatives and antioxidants are added to water and the gelatin is<br>
solubilised by hydrating overnight at about 50.degree,C.<br>
b.	An aqueous solution of ascorbic acid, EDTA, sodium lauryl sulphate is added to the<br>
resulting solution.<br>
c.	An oil phase comprising the carotenoid/ lipid , tocopherol, butylated hydroxy anisole in<br>
Chloroform is prepared by heating the above mixture to 80 degree C.<br>
d.	The oil phase is cooled to 55 degree C and is slowly added to the aqueous phase of Step<br>
b. The resulting emulsion is homogenized at 55 degree C.<br>
e.	After evaporating the solvent at 75 degree C, the emulsion is diluted with water and<br>
spray dried employing a spray drier having a revolving head and a counter rotating<br>
drum .<br>
f.	The dried emulsion is forced through the tiny orifices of the revolving spray head of the<br>
sprayer forming the beadlets .<br>
g.	The resulting beadlets come into contact with the powdery starch material which is<br>
suspended in air in the rotating drum. The mixture of starch and beadlets is allowed to<br>
stand for about an hour and then dried in an oven.<br>
There are several disadvantages associated with the gelatin based beadlets formed by the above mentioned methods as listed below:<br>
a.   The particles of the carotenoids (or the active lipophilic nutrient) at the surface of the beadlets are  unprotected  and  are  therefore  exposed  to  the  harmful  effects  of light and  air.<br><br>
Consequently the beadlets undergo degradation resulting in the loss of their    biological activities .<br>
b. When compressed into tablets, these beadlets tend to disintegrate and the carotenoid (or the active lipophilic nutrient) gets squeezed out of the gelatin matrix in to the matrix of tablet where it is exposed to the incompatible environment. The carotenoid (or the active lipohilic nutrient) may undergo undesirable chemical reaction with excipients of the tablets, or the other ingredients present therein. Consequently they undergo degradation resulting in the loss of their biological activities ,.<br>
C. During the preparation of the beadlets, the carotenoids (or the active lipophilic nutrient) are suspended in molten gelatin at a temperature above 50 deg C. At this temperature a significant portion of actives such as carotenoids get destabilized thereby resulting in their degradation resulting in the loss of their biological activities .<br>
d. The particles of carotenoids (or the active lipophilic nutrient) are embedded in a highly viscous gelatin-sucrose matrix. Upon oral administration of the beadlets, the carotenoids (or the active lipophihc nutrient) get released in the gastro-intestinal tract from these beadlets , in a slow and erratic fashion. Consequently the bioavailability of the carotenoids (or the active lipohilic nutrient)   is significantly reduced and their release is also not uniform.<br>
In addition to gelatin beadlets, lipophilic nutrients like carotenoids have also been reported to be formulated in the form of beadlets using a hydrocolloid such as in US Patent application No. 20030064133 . The carotenoids in such beadlets are affected by similar disadvantages as that of gelatin beadlets.<br>
There are other methods of preparation of the beadlets which have been reported in literature . The important and relevant methods are discussed below -<br>
US patent no. 3998753 describes a process for preparing beadlets of less than 0.1 micron by emulsifying carotenoid solution in an organic solvent with an aqueous solution contaiiung sodium lauryl sulphate, a stabilizer, a preservative, a water soluble carrier composition, by mixing them together at a high speed and high shear. Beadlets are formed upon the removal of solvent, maintaining both the high speed and high shear , forming the emulsion unto droplets ,<br><br>
collecting them in a powdery starch material, separating the carotenoids from the starch material and drying the former to obtain the beadlets.<br>
The surfaces of the carotenoid beadlets prepared by this process are not protected and therefore they are exposed to light and oxygen due to which the carotenoids may undergo degradation thereby reducing their biological activity .<br>
US patent No. 4254100 discloses a process for the preparation of dry, free flowing beadlets containing microcrystalline vitamin A acetate without containing any antioxidants, by homogenising vitamin A acetate in aqueous solution of gelatin or other water soluble ingredient, (tooling to 15 Deg C and centrifuging the microcrystals formed , isolating and suspending in aqueous solution of gelatin and sugar, warming and mixing with an oil to form fine droplets that are solidified by cooling.<br>
The drawback of this process is the inadequate protection provided to the particles at the surface of crystals that may undergo degradation on their   exposure to light and oxygen .<br>
US Patent No. 4670247 describes a method for the preparation of beadlets of vitamin A,D,E, and K in which comprises forming an emulsion of the vitamin in aqueous medium contaiiung gelatin and sugar, converting the droplets of emulsion to dry particulate form and heat treating it to form water insoluble particles are further converted into dry beadlets by cross-linking of gelatin with sugar using heat.<br>
The disadvantage of this process is that the vitamins being sensitive to high temperature undergo significant degradation during beadlet formation and cross-linking.<br>
US Patent No. 4929774 describes a stable mixture of a fat-soluble vitamin and a carotenoid, a triglyceride and a coating substance prepared by mixing the above said components and drying it.<br>
The drawback of this process is that at the surfaces of the beadlets, the carotenoids being not protected, get degraded on exposure to the harmful effects of oxygen, light and moisture.<br>
US Patent No. 5811609 describes a process for the preparation of a powdered water-dispersible carotenoid preparation in the form of discrete carotenoid microparticles by milling a carotenoid<br><br>
in an aqueous mediuni in the presence of a hydrocolloid to form a suspension, heating the suspension formed by the milling to a temperature sufficiently high to cause a total or partial melting of the carotenoid, subsequently cooling the suspension, and finely dividing and drying the suspension to form a powder.<br>
As the beadlets are prepared at high temperature, there is a possibility of significant degradation of the carotenoid during the beadlet formation .<br>
US Patent no. 6093348 describes a process for the manufacture of a solid carotenoid powder containing carotenoid beadlets, by melting an aqueous suspension containing carotenoid crystals a surfactant, a protective colloid in a heat exchanger wherein the residence time of the Carotenoid crystals in the heat exchanger is less than 60 seconds; homogenising the resulting kqueous suspension to get an emulsion by spray process converting into powders containing tarotenoid beadlets.<br>
The main drawback of this process is that the carotenoid molecules are exposed to high temperature and that the molecule at the surface of the beadlets are unprotected.<br>
US Patent No. 6582721 describes beadlets containing mixture of carotenoids, antioxidants, vegetable oil, sucrose gelatin and corn starch. These beadlets are prepared by blending and granulation of the ingredients and drying . The process steps may vary on the sequence of addition of the components , duration and conditions used the methods used for blending and granulation and drying. An inert atmosphere may be maintained. The main disadvantage of such system is the difficulty in the formulation of tablets. When compressed the carotenoid may get leached into the tablet matrix, resulting in the loss of biological activity.<br>
US Patent No. 5849345 discloses beadlets comprising a mixture of gelatin and carbohydrate having dispersed therein a pharmaceutically acceptable anti oxidant and a carotenoid. In this process also the disadvantage in this process is that the molecules of carotenoid at the surfaces of the beadlets are exposed to harmful effects of oxygen, light and moisture.<br>
US Patent application No. 20030064133 describes a process for the encapsulation of lipophilic compounds using alginate, wherein the micronised lipophilic compound is suspended in alkali metal solution of alginate and then converted to beadlet form by drop-wise addition of the solution  into Calcium salt in aqueous medium. The beadlets so formed are washed with acidic<br><br>
solution and dried. The beadlets are then coated with a polymer to provide additional stability to lipophilic compounds.<br>
The main disadvantage of alginate matrix is its inadequate stability during long period of storage ( such as 36 months). Another drawback of this technology is the use of acidic environment which is detrimental to the stability of many lipophilic compounds such as carotenoids.<br>
Im a recently published US Patent application No. 6663900, a process of preparing microcapsules having high carotenoid content between 10-50% by weight has been described, wherein the crystals of carotenoid suspended in aqueous medium are coated on crystalline sucrose particles in a fluid bed coater at 180 degree F.<br>
The main drawback of this process is that the carotenoid molecules at the surface of the microcapsule are exposed to the harmful effects of light and oxygen. Another significant disadvantage of the afore-mentioned process is that it uses an aqueous coating technique which requires a fluidization temperature as high as 180 deg F. It is well known that carotenoids are less stable in aqueous atmosphere in comparison to an organic medium. Carotenoids are much less Stable at the high fluidization temperature reported herein of 180 deg F when compared to their stability at temperatures of 80-90 deg F commonly employed during coating through an nonaqueous medium. At the high temperatures reported in this process, carotenoids are likely to undergo degradation, or isomerization into other stereo-isomeric forms or degradation products of the original carotenoid material which may not have desired beneficial properties of the original carotenoid.<br>
Yet another drawback of this process is that it employs coating on fine crystals or particles. It is Well known that when crystals are fluidised, they undergo fragmentation with sharp edges and the dust generated thereby chokes the filters used in the coater.<br>
In summing up , the beadlets produced by the hitherto known processes have the following<br>
drawbacks:<br>
i)	Since the surfaces of the beadlets are not protected against light, air and moisture , the<br>
actives contained therein undergo degradation .<br><br>
|ii) The beadlets tend to disintegrate or leach into the matrix of tablet when compressed. Here the active nutrient (such as carotenoids or lipophilic nutrient) is released into an environment where stabilizing antioxidants are absent and where there is a possibility of the active nutrient molecule chemically reacting with other components of tablets.<br>
(iii) The leaching of the active nutrients into the tablet matrix under the force of direct compression reduces the bioavailability of the active nutrients (such as carotenoids) and results in a non-uniform release in the intestines.<br>
(|iv) Leaching of the active nutrient (such as carotenoids or lipids) into tablet matrix causes discoloration of tablets and organoleptic properties such as smell and taste are adversely affected.<br>
timitatioiis of current technology:<br>
From the information given above   it is evident and very clear that  currently,   to prepare the<br>
beadlets   of  carotenoids,   lipophilic   nutrients   or  botanical  lipids  a  complex  procedure  of<br>
i eembedding the active material in a gelatin matrix and then preparing a beadlet by spray drying<br>
is explained above is being employed . The beadlets obtained by these known processes do not<br>
ensure   stability to the active material (such as carotenoids / lipids) either as such,   or when<br>
formulated into tablets. In addition, none of the hitherto known methods of making beadlets<br>
provide desirable physical characteristics , such as perfectly spherical, free flowing beadlets<br>
Suitable for tabletting or capsule filling. Further, the beadlets produced by hitherto known<br>
linethods do not prevent leaching of the active nutrients (such as carotenoids) contained in such<br>
beadlets when subjected to compression to form tablets.<br>
Limitation of excipients:<br>
Most of these processes employ gelatin , a protein isolated from the bones and muscles of the animals. In recent times, use of excipients of animal origin in herb-based nutraceuticals is considered undesirable by large section of users. Due to poor digestability, use of gelatin based formulations have a limitation for use among geriatric population. Sometimes, lactose is used as an excipient in the main beadlet matrix due to its compressible nature, but its dairy product (animal) origin makes it unacceptable to many, and is therefore, considered to be undesirable.<br><br>
At present the nutraceutical industry needs:<br>
a.	a solid form of carotenoid and lipids, such as beadlets, suitable for formulation into<br>
tablet.<br>
b.	beadlets from which the carotenoid or lipid should not get leached out when compressed<br>
into tablets<br>
c.	beadlets which are protected from light or oxygen or moisture with the help of certain<br>
coating.<br>
d.	beadlets preferably free from excipients of animal origin or dairy products,<br>
e.	beadlets which can be conveniently produced using a simple process and  equipments<br>
that are common,<br>
f.	beadlets which have an appealing, uniformly spherical appearance.<br>
Therefore in the formulation of oral delivery systems for lipophilic nutrients, particularly Carotenoids, such as lutein, lycopene, beta carotene, avoiding the above mentioned problems present a challenge to the pharmaceutical and food industries, due to the oily nature and iinstability of the carotenoids/lipids.<br>
By nature carotenoids and lipophilic nutrients are unstable in presence of oxygen and light. Therefore, they can be stabilised by the incorporation of certain stabilising antioxidants. To ilurther enhance stability , the active nutrients(eg carotenoids, or lipophilic nutrients such as tocopherols or tocotrienols etc) can be coated with polymer(s) which provide protection against Ijhe harmful effects of oxygen, light and moisture. Carotenoids and other lipophilic nutrients are iliseful as nutritional supplements for the prevention /treatment of diseases, such as , several forms of cancer, immunological disorders, eye disorders, skin manifestations, inflammation, dardio-vascular disease etc. These lipophilic nutrients are typically required to be administered daily through a suitable delivery system. There are several delivery systems such as emulsions 4nd suspensions or oily solutions, that are popularly used currently along with solid delivery fprms such as gelatin beadlets. As the tablet form is considered to be having high user-compliance, carotenoids and other lipophilic nutrients need to be facilitated for such dry delivery forms.<br>
Non-pareil seeds such as sugar spheres or globules, without the active ingredient, on which the active ingredient is coated, are a convenient form for the preparation of oral dosage forms such as tablets or hard gelatin capsule, of the active ingredient . Accordingly , in the pharmaceutical<br><br>
industry, it is a well-known practice to load sugar spheres of 200 microns to 3 mm with the active ingredient ( drug ) in a suitable solvent using a coating pan or in a Neocota or in a fluidbed system. The beadlets produced by coating the active ingredient on the non- pareil seeds are unifirmly spherical in nature and can be used in size as small as 200 microns. The drug loaded spherical beadlets may further be uniformly coated with a polymeric material to modify the release or mask the bitter taste of the drug.<br>
The major advantage of such coated non-pareil seeds is the possibility of having an uniform coating of the active nutrient. These coated non-pareil seeds (beadlets) are free-flowing and have uniform and controlled release of the active ingredient upon oral administration. Such coated non-pareils seed are more stable . If required , they can be made further stable by applying additional polymeric coating(s) so as to protect them from the harmful effects of Hght, oxygen and moisture.<br>
the above methodology is hitherto well known to be utilized for preparing beadlets of non-Vvaxy, non-oily lipophilic materials or nurients. Fluidisation of such nutrients is smooth and effective, as the active nutrients does not form a cohesive oily mass at the stage of fluidization and coating.<br>
In fluidisation process , the medium of coating can either be aqueous or organic. Attempts have been made in the past to apply fluid bed technology for preparing microcapsules of carotenoids using aqueous coatings process on crystalline sucrose. Such processes suffer from drawbacks such as use of high temperature(180.deg.F) , which are not suitable for many heat ser\sitive products such as carotenoids.<br>
Unfortunately, this method using organic solvent medium is not applicable directly for the formation of beadlets of lipophilic nutrients and carotenoids, in spite of the above said advantages , due to their oily/ waxy nature . Further these nutrients, when subjected to fluidisation, form a cohesive mass which adversely affects the fluidisation . Therefore, a process employing fluid-bed system using a non-aqueous coating medium has hitherto not been Considered possible or demonstrated, for the preparation of beadlets of lipophilic nutrients such as carotenoids. Due to the reason of non-applicability of the non-aqueous fluid-bed system for the formation of beadlets of lipids, hitherto there has been no question of employment of any Core such as non-pareil seeds or other seeds for the preparation of beadlets of lipophilic nutrients.<br><br>
We undertook scientific investigations in order to overcome the obstacles faced in the preparation of bead lets of various lipophilic nutrients, especially carotenoids, employing the hitherto known spraying processes and to take advantage of employing the coating of an inert core with lipophilic nutrients in organic solvent medium by fluidisation technique, which are successfully employed in pharmaceutical and food industries.<br>
With our sustained efforts we observed , surprisingly , that process of coating an inert core with lipophilic materials or nutrients particularly carotenoids, employing fluidised bed technique in organic solvent medium is possible . This was possible when we found that a solution of lipophilic nutrients, in a non- polar solvent when diluted with a polar solvent forms a colloidal suspension. This colloidal suspension when subjected to fluidisation using a fluid bed system employing an inert core did not form a cohesive mass and does not adversely affect the fluidisation process. On the contrary, the process resulted in the formation of the inert cores uniformly coated with the lipophilic materials or nutrients in the form of uniformly spherical beadlets.<br>
In other words , the fluidisation technique using a non-aqueous solvent which hitherto was not considered as applicable for the formation of beadlets of lipophilic nutrients , has been made possible by the process developed according to the present invention. This invention has resulted in developing a new concept enabling incorporation of oily lipophilic matter into their beadlets..<br>
The formation of stable, uniformly coated free flowing spherical beadlets of oily lipophilic nutrients is a result of synergistic combination of use of spherical inert cores (non-pareil seeds), selected stabilising antioxidants and coating the resulting synergistic combination with oxygen and moisture barrier polymers to provide additional protection.<br>
Spherical nature of beadlets has several advantages such as, free flowing property which is required during tablet compression, enables compression of tablets at as high a compression force as 10 kg/cm^ , superior release property, possibility of site specific controlled release of carotenoids and lipids, and consequently, higher bioavailability. Major advantage of using such technology is that it avoids the use of high temperature (above 50.degree.C) during preparation of beadlets and thus prevents degradation of heat-sensitive bioactive compounds. Another advantage of using spherical cores being flexibility of beadlet size which can range between a wide range of 200 microns to 3 mm.   Another advantage of the present invention is that the<br><br>
invention can be practiced using existing, hitherto well known fluid-bed technology and equipment.<br>

same in a non-polar solvent and diluting the resulting solution with a polar solvent.<br>
ii)	mixing the colloidal suspension obtained with a stabilising antioxidant<br>
(iii) spraying the resulting colloidal suspension on to inert cores present in a fluidbed system provided with bottom spray mechanism, at a temperature in the range of ambient temperature to 45 degree C , at an atomisation pressure in the range of 0 . 5 to 3 Kg / cm ^ and a spray rate in the range of 10 g / hour to 600g / hour and<br>
(iv)        drying the beadlets formed at an atomisation pressure of 0.8 to 1.2 kg/ cm 2<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention there is provided a process for the preparation of the beadlets of   lutein or any other carotenoid,   which comprises<br>
(i) forming a colloidal suspension of lutein or any other desired carotenoid by dissolving the<br>
material in a non polar solvent and diluting the resulting solution with a polar solvent<br>
(ii) mixing the colloidal suspension obtained with a stabilising antioxidant<br>
(iii) spraying the resulting colloidal suspension on to inert cores present in a fluid-bed system<br>
provided with a bottom-spray mechanism at a temperature in the range of ambient temperature<br>
to 45 degree C , at an atomisation pressure in the range of 0 . 5 to 3 kg / cm 2 and a spray rate<br>

In another preferred embodiment, the polar solvents which may be used for preparing the colloidal suspension of the lipophilic nutrient include - isopropyl alcohol, acetone, methanol, ethanol, acetonitrile or their mixtures .<br>
It may be noted that carotenoids or lipophilic nutrients are not completely soluble in polar solvent. This means that thereby that only some part of the carotenoid or liophilic nutrient may form a suspension. This suspension may not be   homogeneous   due to the presence of large<br><br>
particles of the undispersed carotenoids or lipophilic nutrients. This suspension can be filtered to remove the solid materials and the resulting colloidal suspension can be used for the fluidisation process .<br>
Although such a process is possible and envisaged within the broad scope of the present invention , the process is not economical and efficient ._When carotenoids are mixed with polar solvent directly, some portion of the carotenoid forms colloidal suspension, where as a large portion remains as a lumpy, un-dispersed solid mass. One can filter such a mixture and use orJy the colloidal dispersion portion for coating. If one follows this procedure, it is not possible to load adequate quantity of carotenoid, and therefore not economical. Therefore it is necessary to dissolve or disperse the carotenoid in non-polar solvent followed by forming a colloidal dispersion by the addition of polar solvent.<br>
The stabilising antioxidants used may include vitamin E acetate, natural tocopherols, ascorbyl palmitate, ascorbic acid , sodium ascorbate, citric acid, rosemary extract or rosemary oil, curcuminoids, green tea extract, ginger extract, carnosic acid, butylated hydroxy anisole, butylated hydroxy toluene and the like or their combinations thereof. The amount used may vary from 0.1 % to 20 % by weight of the carotenoid, lipophilic nutrient or lipid used The stabilising oxidants may also contain other stabilisers which may include sorbic acid, sodium benzoate, sodium salicylate, EDTA, and the like or mixtures thereof.<br>
Binding agents may be added to along with the stabilising antioxidants for enhancing the efficiency of the coating . The binding agents used may include gum acacia, gum tragacanth, xanthan gum, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, hydroxypropyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl methyl Cellulose or their mixtures . Their amount used may range from 0.1 to 10% of the weight of the bead lets.<br>
Disintegrating agents may also be used along with the binding agents . If such agents are used they may be selected from starch, cross-linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, cross-carmelose sodium and sodium starch glycolate or mixtures thereof. Their amount used may range from 0.1 to 5% of the weight of the beadlets.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the novel beadlets are provided a coating of a layer of  films of an oxygen barrier polymer.<br><br>
In yet another preferred embodiment of the present invention , the novel beadlets are provided with another coating over the layer of the coating of films of an oxygen barrier polymer , with a film of a moisture barrier polymer<br>
