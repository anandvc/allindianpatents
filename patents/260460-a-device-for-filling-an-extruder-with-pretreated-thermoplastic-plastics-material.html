A device for filling an extruder with<br>
pretreated thermoplastic plastics material<br>
The invention relates to a device for filling an extruder with pretreated thermoplastic<br>
plastics material, in particular PET, comprising at least one evacuatable container in<br>
which moving, in particular rotating, tools are provided for pretreatment of the material,<br>
wherein the pretreatment comprises drying and, optionally, crystallisation or partial<br>
crystallisation of the material, and wherein each container has a discharge opening for<br>
the preferably at least partly crystallised material, which discharge opening, with respect<br>
to the material, is fluidically connected to the filling opening of the extruder.<br>
A device of this type is known from AT 411235 B. This known device is very suitable for<br>
the recycling of thermoplastic plastics material, in particular PET (polyethylene<br>
terephthalate), which is mostly fed to the device in the form of comminuted bottle<br>
material, frequently in chip form. The recycled material produced by the device can be<br>
used in the food packaging industry. However, the known device has a certain apparatus<br>
and also energy requirement, and there is frequently the desire among customers to be<br>
able to use existing installation parts in a suitable manner in combination with the device.<br>
This frequently entails problems with respect to the connection of the filling device to the<br>
extruder.<br>
The invention starts from a device of the initially described type and has the object of<br>
making the device more universally usable and more easily controllable and of keeping<br>
the energy requirement lower by reducing energy losses. Lastly, it should also be<br>
possible to reduce the apparatus requirement in comparison with the known device. The<br>
invention achieves this object in that a transfer section, which maintains the flowable<br>
state of the material pretreated in the containers, is connected to the outlet opening of<br>
the containers so as to form a sealed fluidic connection for the material, the containers<br>
optionally forming a plurality of container stages, and in that this transfer section has, at<br>
' its outlet, a coupling which is directly connectable in a sealed manner to the filling<br>
opening of the extruder. A device of this type, according to the invention, still provides<br>
vacuum treatment of the material in the container, as in the initially described known<br>
device, but avoids the necessary multi-stage formation of the known device since the<br><br>
device according to the invention can also have a one-stage formation with only a single<br>
container, which will even be the case in the majority of cases. The fewer stages or<br>
containers there are, the more easily controllable the device becomes and the lower the<br>
energy losses become, in addition to the reduced apparatus requirement. The<br>
maintenance of the flowable state of the treated material as far as the extruder inlet is<br>
particularly important in the invention. The flowability of the material presupposes that<br>
the material in the containers or the container is dried and usually also at least partly<br>
crystallised and passes in this state to the common outlet of the containers, but is not<br>
plasticised and therefore not sticky. The aforementioned state of the material is therefore<br>
maintained in the entire region lying between the outlet of the containers and the<br>
extruder inlet and formed by the transfer section. Differently treated, namely plasticised<br>
material, is extremely sticky, which has a disadvantageous effect on uniform filling of the<br>
extruder. If this filling process takes place non-uniformly or even if there are more or less<br>
brief interruptions caused by agglutinations, e.g. due to poor or non-uniform<br>
crystallisation, this can lead to the feared "pumping" of the extruder, which, as<br>
experience has shown, leads to problems in the further processing installation<br>
connected to the extruder. However, if the device according to the invention ensures<br>
uniform filling of the extruder via the flowable state of the material fed to the extruder,<br>
then not only does this avoid the described difficulties, but a higher extruder throughput<br>
is usually also achieved.<br>
The transfer section also facilitates structural adaptation to the filling opening of the<br>
extruder since the local conditions are frequently such that a sometimes considerable<br>
spatial distance has to be maintained between the container and the extruder. This<br>
distance can be bridged by the transfer section without any problems.<br>
Measures for maintaining the flowable state of a plastics material are known per se.<br>
Thus it is sufficient here to mention briefly only some of the most important measures,<br>
e.g. the avoidance of an increase in the temperature of the material throughout the<br>
transfer section, or the avoidance of cross-sectional reductions in the transfer section or<br>
' of compressing members, the maintenance of correct discharge angles of hoppers, etc.<br>
Above all, however, the device according to the invention takes account of the fact that<br>
extruders frequently already exist in plastics processing operations, in particular in the<br><br>
recycling industry. Consequently, in the device according to the invention, the extruder:<br>
does not necessarily form a component of the device, i.e. the extruder does not<br>
necessarily have to originate from the same manufacturer as the parts of the installation;<br>
connected upstream of the extruder. Such extruders, which were already present at the<br>
site of the installation and by which the treated material is ultimately plasticised and<br>
supplied for further processing, will be referred to hereinbelow as "external extruders<br>
These are conventional extruders (single-screw, twin-screw or multi-screw extruders)<br>
which, however, are not immediately suitable for processing PET material to be recycled<br>
because the feedstock in conventional installations is usually moist or non-crystalline<br>
and, in this form, suffers during recycling treatment. For connection of the device<br>
according to the invention to these existing extruders, according to a further<br>
development of the invention the device itself is extruderless and is directly connectable<br>
in a sealed manner by means of the coupling to the filling opening of an extruder formed<br>
by an external extruder. Two basic variants arise here, according to whether the feed<br>
region of the filling opening of the external extruder is vacuum-tight or not. In the former<br>
case, the transfer section is evacuatable. This evacuation of the transfer section can be<br>
effected by the vacuum generated in the container. This vacuum takes effect in the<br>
vacuum-tight transfer section and also in the feed region of the extruder. If, on the other<br>
hand, the aforementioned feed region is not vacuum-tight and if this feed region also<br>
cannot be brought into a vacuum-tight state without unacceptable expenditure or if, with<br>
respect to the overall installation, the desire is to set different vacuums in the container<br>
and the transfer section, then the transfer section contains a vacuum sluice. The<br>
aforementioned vacuum-tightness of the extruder is to be understood to mean that the<br>
vacuum in the transfer section is not substantially disrupted by the extruder, with the<br>
result that there is no substantial deterioration of the flowable material passing through<br>
the transfer section because any ingress of atmospheric oxygen and/or atmospheric<br>
moisture is only small.<br>
The feed region of the extruder is to be understood as that region which is adjacent to<br>
the filling opening of the extruder, in particular on the side of the extruder remote from<br>
the extruder head, which is usually the motor side.<br>
The particular structural formation of the transfer section is dependent upon the<br>
characteristics of the intended field of application. The transfer section can have at least<br><br>
one hopper or hopper-like collecting chamber, into which the pretreated material coming<br>
from the container can flow. However, a delivery device can also be connected to the<br>
discharge opening of the container, e.g. a screw (which has to operate in a substantially<br>
compressionless manner so as not to impair the flowability of the material) or a cellular-<br>
wheel conveyor or the like. This provides the possibility, in a simple manner, of<br>
regulating the amount of material fed to the extruder inlet per unit time by providing a<br>
means for regulating the feed volume or feed weight of the delivery device. As an<br>
alternative to such a delivery device, a valve, in particular a slider, which regulates the<br>
discharge of the material from the container, can be provided between the discharge<br>
opening of the container and the transfer section within the scope of the invention.<br>
As already mentioned, the extruder can also be a twin- or multi-screw extruder. In this<br>
case, it is advantageous to form the construction according to the invention so that the<br>
transfer section has a dosing means for filling such an extruder. Twin- or multi-screw<br>
extruders only plasticise well in the partly filled (underfed) state, which condition is<br>
fulfilled by the dosing means in a simple manner. Regulation of the feed volume or the<br>
feed weight can also take place in the dosing means.<br>
The transfer section can also have at least one transfer chamber provided with a level<br>
control.<br>
As already mentioned, the invention provides advantages in those cases in which there<br>
are difficult local conditions, e.g. no space in the vicinity of the extruder or other<br>
circumstances which necessitate a considerable spatial distance between the extruder<br>
and the device. In such cases, the transfer, section can have at least one conveying<br>
means for the flowable material, e.g. a feed screw, which conveying means bridges at<br>
least a large part of the aforementioned distance.<br>
As the aforementioned pretreated material is usually sensitive to atmospheric oxygen<br>
and/or atmospheric moisture, it should be attempted, if possible, to keep the entire<br>
transfer section sealed in relation to the ambient air and to keep it evacuatable. If this<br>
cannot be reliably achieved, the vacuum in the container can be secured by a vacuum<br>
sluice, which has already been mentioned and is located in the transfer section, and the<br>
unevacuatable region can be flushed with a gaseous medium, e.g. inert gas, dry air or<br><br>
hot air, which protects the material in this region. It is advantageous to arrange such a<br>
vacuum sluice in the transfer section in the vicinity of the filling opening of the extruder or<br>
in the vicinity of the coupling so as to be able to keep a large part of the transfer section<br>
under vacuum without any problems, e.g. by also allowing the vacuum generated in the<br>
container to be effective in this part of the transfer section.<br>
Naturally, all these aforementioned variants can be used in any combination in<br>
accordance with the intended field of application.<br>
In the simplest case, however, there is also the possibility of forming the transfer section<br>
as a channel which connects the outlet opening of the container directly to the coupling.<br>
The material treated in the container is flung into this channel by the rotating tools.<br>
In all embodiments, the processed plastics material, in particular PET, is not melted or<br>
plasticised until it is in the extruder, which can be constructed with or without degassing.<br>
Single-stage formation of the device according to the invention does not necessarily<br>
mean that only a single container is provided, although this configuration is usually<br>
provided. However, it is also possible for two or more containers to feed in parallel into a<br>
common outlet, optionally alternately, from which outlet the material is fed to the extruder<br>
in the manner described. Likewise, it is possible, albeit with increased expenditure, to<br>
provide two or more container stages, through which the treated material passes in turn.<br>
Each of these container stages can comprise one or more containers. Naturally, it also<br>
applies to all these embodiments that the flowable state of the processed material is<br>
always maintained as far as the filling opening of the extruder.<br>
Embodiments of the device according to the invention are schematically shown in the<br>
drawing. Fig. 1 shows an embodiment with a level-regulated transfer hopper. Figs. 2 and<br>
3 each show an embodiment variant of fig. 1. Fig. 4 shows an embodiment with a dosing<br>
means. Fig. 5 is an embodiment variant of fig. 4. Fig. 6 shows a further embodiment with<br>
a dosing means. Figs. 7 and 8 show further embodiments in which a transfer chamber is<br>
directly connected to the filling opening of the external extruder. Figs. 9 and 10 each<br>
shown an embodiment in which the discharge from the container is controlled by a valve<br>
formed by a slider. Fig. 11 shows a particularly simple embodiment.<br><br>
In the embodiment according to fig. 1, the thermoplastic plastics material to be<br>
processed, in particular PET (polyethylene terephthalate), is fed from above to a<br>
container 1, formed as a vacuum reactor, via a vacuum sluice 2, the upper and lower<br>
ends of which are sealable by a respective slider 3. The two sliders 3 are displaced<br>
between a closed position and an open position by hydraulically or pneumatically<br>
actuatable, double-acting cylinders 4. Instead of this type of sluice, a sluice formed as a<br>
rotor can also be provided, e.g. a cellular-wheel sluice, by means of which the container<br>
1 can be continuously charged at least to some extent. The container 1 forms a single<br>
container stage 95, which does not, however, exclude the provision of a plurality of<br>
containers 1 operating in parallel in this container stage 95.<br>
The container 1 is connected to a vacuum pump 6 by a vacuum line 5. In the container,<br>
tools 7 arranged one above the other rotate about the vertical container axis in a plurality<br>
of planes and are fixed to tool carriers, preferably carrier plates 8, which are arranged<br>
spaced apart one above the other and are mounted on a common vertical spindle 9<br>
which preferably extends through the base 10 in a vacuum-tight bearing and is driven by<br>
a motor 11. By means of the rotation of the tools 7, the material, which is introduced into<br>
the container either continuously or in batches, is mixed and heated and optionally also<br>
comminuted if the tools 7 are correspondingly formed, e.g. with blades. This<br>
comminution is frequently unnecessary because the material 12 to be processed is<br>
already introduced into the container 1 in comminuted form, e.g. as granules or PET<br>
bottle chips. Although the aforementioned rotation movement of the tools 7 is to be<br>
produced in as structurally simple a manner as possible, a different type of movement of<br>
the tools 7 can also be provided for the aforementioned pretreatment of the material 12,<br>
e.g. an up and down movement of the tools 7, etc. The heating of the material in the<br>
container 1 is caused by the tools 7 and is monitored by sensors 14 connected by lines<br>
15 to a control means 16 for controlling the speed of the motor 11. In this way, the<br>
material 12 processed in the container 1 can always be held at a desired temperature<br>
level so that the material is only heated, dried and, optionally, at least partly crystallised,<br>
but not plasticised. The temperature of the material in the container 1 therefore always<br>
lies below the melting or plasticising temperature of the processed material, thereby<br>
maintaining a flowable, non-sticky material state. The individual tool carrier plates 8<br>
define, in the container 1, a plurality of treatment spaces 60 lying one above the other for<br><br>
the material 12 to be processed, which is introduced into the container 1 from above<br>
and, while being processed, gradually sinks downwards through the annular gaps 17<br>
existing between the plates 8 and the container side wall 13 and into the region of the<br>
lowermost carrier plate 8. This ensures an adequate and narrowly defined residence<br>
time of the processed material in the container 1 and thus uniform processing of all the<br>
material fed in. The lowermost plate 8 is arranged in the vicinity of the container base 10,<br>
and its tools fling the processed material into a discharge opening 18 in the container<br>
side wall 13, which opening 18 lies at approximately the same height as this plate 8 and<br>
to which is connected a transfer section 31 which maintains the crystallised state of the<br>
material 12 and leads to the extruder 36. In the embodiment shown, this transfer section<br>
31 first contains a delivery device 96 which assists the discharge of the material 12 from<br>
the container 1. This delivery device 96 has a screw housing 19, the feed opening of<br>
which is connected in a sealed manner to the opening 18. A screw 20 is rotatably<br>
mounted in the housing 19 and is formed as a simple feed screw, i.e. works<br>
compressionlessly so that the material that it picks up from the opening 18 is merely<br>
conveyed, but not or only very slightly plasticised, thereby maintaining the flowable state<br>
of the processed material. In the embodiment shown, the screw 20 is tangentially<br>
connected to the container 1 and, at is end lying on the left in fig. 1, is driven by a motor<br>
21 with a transmission 22. Instead of the tangential connection, a radial or oblique<br>
connection of the screw housing to the container wall can also be provided, optionally<br>
also a downwards connection. The screw feeds towards the right in fig. 1, so that the<br>
crystallised material issuing at its delivery end 23 flows into a hopper 24 of the vacuum-<br>
tight transfer section 31. In order to keep the material conveyed by the screw 20<br>
constantly at a desired temperature and flowable, the screw housing 19 can be provided<br>
with a temperature-control means 25, e.g. a heating device. Alternatively or additionally,<br>
a channel 26 for the passage of a temperature-control medium can be provided in the<br>
core of the screw 20. The temperature-control medium is fed into the channel 26 in a<br>
known manner via the output shaft of the transmission 22 by means of a rotary infeed. If<br>
necessary, in order to maintain the flowability of the material, the temperature of the<br>
material conveyed by the screw 20 can be monitored by means of at least one sensor<br>
61, the signal from which is fed to the control means 16 via a line 62.<br>
The state of the material 68 in the hopper 24, in particular its flowable state, can be<br>
monitored through an inspection glass 27. For monitoring the level in the hopper 24, a<br><br>
level control 33 is provided, the level probes 34 of which can be connected by lines 63 to<br>
a means 64 for controlling the speed of the motor 21 so that, in this way, the level in the<br>
hopper 24 can always be kept at a desired level. The material flows downwards from the<br>
hopper 24 into a vacuum sluice 28 which is closable in a vacuum-tight manner top and<br>
bottom by means of sliders 30 actuatable by cylinders 29 in a manner similar to that<br>
described for the sluice 2. Here too, a cellular-wheel sluice or the like can also be used.<br>
When the slider 30 is opened, the material in the vacuum sluice 28 falls downwards out<br>
of the outlet 58 thereof into a further hopper-like chamber 32 of the transfer section 31,<br>
which chamber 32 is also formed with a level control 33 with level probes 34. The<br>
signals from these level probes 34 can control the actuation of the lower slider 30 of the<br>
vacuum sluice 28. This is not shown in detail. The outlet of the chamber 32 is connected<br>
to the filling opening 35 of the extruder, which is formed by an external extruder 36, by<br>
means of a preferably air-tight coupling 69 formed in any manner, e.g. as a flanged joint.<br>
The feed region of the external extruder 36, adjacent to the filling opening 35, does not<br>
necessarily have to be vacuum-tight since the vacuum sluice 28, which is<br>
advantageously located in the transfer section 31 in the vicinity of the filling opening 35,<br>
ensures maintenance of the vacuum in the main region of the transfer section 31<br>
between the container 1 and the vacuum sluice 28, and the region of the transfer section<br>
31 lying between the vacuum sluice 28 and the filling opening 35 is only short, with the<br>
result that the material 12 only resides in this region for a short time, thereby avoiding<br>
substantial deterioration of the material. In the housing 37 of the external extruder 36 is<br>
arranged a screw 38, which is driven by a motor 39 and provided with a compression<br>
zone 40 so that the material conveyed by the screw 38 is plasticised and extruded in this<br>
state through at least one nozzle 41 of an extruder head 42 and supplied for further<br>
processing (e.g. granulation or injection into a mould).<br>
The processed material is under vacuum from the vacuum sluice 2, the sluice chamber<br>
67 of which can also be connected to the vacuum pump 6 by a vacuum line 43, as far as<br>
the outlet 58 of the vacuum sluice 28, thus avoiding any deterioration of the processed<br>
material 12 by the action of atmospheric oxygen and atmospheric moisture. In order to<br>
avoid such deterioration as much as possible also' in the region between the vacuum<br>
sluice 28 and the extruder 36, the chamber 32 can be closed as tightly as possible and<br>
be provided with a supply line 44 for flushing with dry and preferably hot inert gas<br>
supplied from a gas source 45. Flushing with dry hot air may also be sufficient since<br><br>
complete air-tightness cannot be achieved if the external extruder is not gas-tight, which<br>
is frequently the case. However, the residence time of the material in the chamber 32 is<br>
short, with the result that the slight deterioration of the material is negligible in practice.<br>
In order to make it easier to charge the screw 38 of the external extruder 36, the feed<br>
opening 35 is advantageously arranged in the top of the housing 37 of the external<br>
extruder 36 so that the supplied material automatically flows into the interior of the screw<br>
housing 37 under the effect of gravity. The material 68 in the chamber 32 forms a<br>
material pad in the chamber 32, which contributes towards uniform charging of the<br>
external extruder 36.<br>
However, as fig. 2 shows, the outlet 58 of the vacuum sluice 28 of the transfer section 31<br>
can also be directly connected to the feed opening 35 of the extruder 36 by means of the<br>
coupling 69. This type of expenditure-reducing embodiment can be used if a particular<br>
method of charging the extruder 36 does not have to be taken into consideration, i.e. if<br>
its screw 38 can also be fully charged, which is carried out e.g. by opening the lower<br>
slider 30 if the vacuum sluice 28 is correspondingly filled.<br>
In the two previously described embodiment variants, it was presupposed that the<br>
container 1 can be constructed in the vicinity of the extruder 36, which is formed in<br>
particular by an external extruder, so that the described connections are easily<br>
implementable. However, if there is insufficient space in the region of the external<br>
extruder for such a construction or if one wishes to arrange the container or containers 1<br>
so as to be spatially separated from the external extruder 36, then a construction<br>
according to fig. 3 can be used. It differs from the construction according to fig. 1<br>
principally in that the processed material 12 flows out of the outlet 58 of the vacuum<br>
sluice 28 and into a further chamber 70 forming a collecting vessel, from which the<br>
material is fed by a conveying means 71 to the desired point above the external extruder<br>
36, advantageously to a point lying above the external extruder 36, so as to be able to<br>
convey the material 12 further under the effect of gravity. The conveying means 71 can<br>
e.g. be a screw mounted in a housing, or a pressure or suction conveyor. The conveying<br>
means 71 can be constructed so that a substantial ingress of air to the material 12<br>
transported by it is avoided. For this purpose, the conveying means can be flooded e.g.<br>
with inert gas or, or if the material transported by it only resides in it for a short time, with<br><br>
hot dry air. In order to avoid the substantial ingress of air to the processed material, the<br>
chamber 70 is connected by a line 72 to the protective-gas source 45. This line 72 can<br>
also be used for the afore-mentioned process of flushing the conveying means 71 with<br>
protective gas. This is represented by the connecting line 73. The conveying means 71<br>
advantageously extends into the base region of the chamber 70 in a sealed manner in<br>
order to be able to convey the material reliably from that point, even when the level in<br>
the chamber 70 is low. The level of the material 12 in the chamber 70 is monitored by a<br>
level probe 34, the signal from which is fed to the means 64 for controlling the speed of<br>
the motor 21.<br>
The conveying means 71 is driven by a motor 74 and a transmission 75 and feeds the<br>
material via a transfer chamber 76 into a connecting piece 77, through which the<br>
material flows into the chamber 32 of the transfer section 31. From this point on, the<br>
construction corresponds to that according to fig. 1.<br>
In the embodiment according to fig. 4, the vacuum sluice 28 is connected directly to the<br>
housing 19 of the feed screw 20 by a pipe bend 65, i.e. the hopper 24 shown in fig. 1<br>
has been omitted. In order to achieve dosability for charging the extruder 36, the plastics<br>
material, which is crystallised but not plasticised in the container 1 and which is<br>
conveyed by the screw 20 only in a flowable state, falls out of the outlet 58 of the<br>
vacuum sluice 28 and into the closed chamber 32 of the transfer section 31, in which a<br>
level control means 33 monitors the level by means of level sensors 34. The signals<br>
from the probes 34, which monitor the minimum and maximum levels in the chamber 32,<br>
are fed to the means 64 for controlling the speed of the motor 21 in order to regulate the<br>
volume conveyed by the screw 20 as a function of the level in the chamber 32. A further<br>
sensor 86 is provided in the region of the pipe bend 65; its signal is also fed to the<br>
control means 64 via the line 87. In this way, the pipe bend 65 is prevented from being<br>
overfilled with material.<br>
The outlet opening of the hopper-like chamber 32 is fluidically connected to the feed<br>
opening 47 of a dosing means 46 formed by a feed screw 49 which is rotatably mounted<br>
in a housing 48 and driven by a motor 50. This motor is powered by a control means 51<br>
which regulates the speed of the feed screw 49 and thus effects dosing, which can be<br>
weight- or volume-dependent. At the delivery end of the screw 49, the housing 48 of the<br><br>
feed screw 49 has, in its underside, an outlet opening 52, through which the flowably<br>
maintained plastics material falls into the feed opening 35 of the external extruder 36 via<br>
a connecting piece 53. The dosing means 46 permits highly uniform charging of the<br>
extruder 36, which is important in particular when the feed screw turns of the extruder 36<br>
must not be completely filled, which is the case in particular for twin- or multi-screw<br>
extruders.<br>
In order to prevent deterioration of the plastics material by the action of air along the<br>
path between the vacuum sluice 28 and the feed opening 35 of the extruder 36, both the<br>
sealed chamber 32 and the likewise sealed connecting piece 53 are connected to a gas<br>
source 45 by lines 44. A hot inert gas can be used for this purpose. However, flushing<br>
with hot dry air is also sufficient if deterioration of the material, which is low due to the<br>
short residence time, can be accepted.<br>
The embodiment according to fig. 5 differs from that according to fig. 4 in that, in a<br>
manner similar to that described for the embodiment according to fig. 3, a conveying<br>
means 71 is provided in the transfer section 31 and bridges the spatial distance between<br>
the container 1 and the vacuum sluice 28 connected thereto and the dosing means 46<br>
connected to the external extruder 36. The construction and the drive of this conveying<br>
means 71 can correspond to the construction described in connection with fig. 3. The<br>
signals from the level probes 34 can control not only the motor 21, but also the motor 74<br>
of the conveying means 71 via lines 88.<br>
A further essential difference between the embodiments according to figs. 1, 2 and 3 on<br>
the one hand and those according to figs. 4 and 5 on the other hand is that, in the first-<br>
mentioned embodiments, the hopper 24 and the sluice 28 effect predosing in the<br>
transfer section 31 and are vacuum-tight. In contrast, in the embodiments according to<br>
figs. 4 and 5, the dosing means, which is substantially formed by the chamber 32 and<br>
the screw 49, does not necessarily have to be under vacuum, but it is advantageous at<br>
least to flush the chamber 32 with dry air or protective gas in order to protect the treated<br>
material.<br>
In the embodiment according to fig. 6, the container 1 is filled by a conveying means 55<br>
via the vacuum sluice 2 and a filling hopper 54. A conveyor belt or a feed screw can be<br><br>
used for this purpose. The vacuum sluice 28 in figs. 1 to 5 has been omitted, with the<br>
result that the installation is under vacuum from the container 1 as far as the interior of<br>
the housing 37 of the external extruder 36, which presupposes that the feed region of<br>
the external extruder 36 is vacuum-tight or can be brought into this state during<br>
assembly of the device. For this purpose, it is usually only necessary to form the motor-<br>
side seal 56 of the housing 37 of the external extruder 36 in a vacuum-tight manner.<br>
Measures suitable for this are known and do not require further explanation here.<br>
In this embodiment, the feed screw 20 conveys the material, in a manner similar to that<br>
described for the embodiment according to fig. 1, into a hopper 24 of the transfer section<br>
31, the hopper 24 being provided with a level control 33, the level probes 34 of which<br>
sense the level in the hopper 24. This effects dosing in that the signal supplied by the<br>
probes 34 is fed via lines 57 to the control means 21 which regulates the speed of the<br>
drive motor 22 of the feed screw 20. The motor-side seal 56 of the housing 48 of the<br>
screw 49 must be vacuum-tight. The screw 49 conveys the flowably maintained plastics<br>
material, preferably controlled by weight or by volume, into the connecting piece 53,<br>
whence it falls downwards into the filling opening 35 of the housing 37 of the extruder<br>
36. It is also advantageous to monitor the maximum level in the connecting piece 53 by<br>
means of a probe 59 in order to prevent overfilling of the connecting piece 53. The signal<br>
from this probe 59 can e.g. influence the control means 51 via a line 66.<br>
Although the vacuum generated in the container 1 by the vacuum pump 6 would<br>
continue into the transfer hopper 24 via the housing 19 of the screw 20 and from there<br>
into the extruder 36 via the housing 48 of the feed screw 49, it is more advantageous if<br>
the transfer hopper 24 and the connecting piece 53 are also evacuated via lines 5.<br>
Separate vacuum sources 6 can optionally be provided for this purpose, but for<br>
economical reasons a common vacuum source 6 is likely to be used.<br>
A conveying means 71, as shown in figs. 3 and 5, can also be used in the embodiment<br>
according to fig. 6 in order to be able to arrange the container 1 with spatial separation<br>
from the external extruder 36. In fig. 6, this conveying means would advantageously be<br>
interposed between the hopper 24 and the dosing means 46. Its construction can<br>
correspond to the previously described construction, although in a vacuum-tight<br>
configuration.<br><br>
In the embodiment according to figs. 7 and 8, the outlet opening of a hopper 24 of the<br>
transfer section 31 is directly connected in a sealed manner to the filling opening 35 of<br>
the external extruder 36 by means of the coupling 69, the hopper 24 surrounding a<br>
transfer chamber 78. The previously described vacuum sluice 28 has been omitted here.<br>
According to fig. 7, the hopper 24 is filled by a conveying means 79 formed here as a<br>
compressionless screw 20 which is connected to the container 1 in a manner similar to<br>
that shown in fig. 1. The level of the material falling into the transfer chamber 78 at the<br>
delivery end 23 of the screw 20 is monitored in the transfer chamber 78 by a level<br>
control 33 comprising at least one level probe 34 for this level. The level signal thus<br>
obtained is evaluated by a control means 80 which is connected by a line 81 to the<br>
motor 21 of the feed screw 20. In this way, the level control 33 regulates the speed of<br>
the screw 20 in such a way that a predetermined, desired level of the material 68 is<br>
always maintained in the transfer chamber 78.<br>
According to fig. 8, the transfer chamber 78 formed by the hopper 24 is directly<br>
connected to the discharge opening 18 of the container 1, i.e. the conveying means 79<br>
has been omitted. Instead, the dosing means 46 is arranged between the container 1<br>
and the transfer chamber 78 and is formed here by a valve 82, e.g. a sliding valve. Its<br>
slider is moved by a pneumatic or hydraulic unit 83 which is controlled by the control<br>
means 80 of the level control 33. This is carried out so that the desired level of the<br>
material 68 is always maintained in the hopper 24. In this case, the transfer chamber 78<br>
is filled by the material, which is set into rotation in the container 1 by the tools 7, being<br>
flung into the discharge opening 18 of the container 1 by centrifugal action or, if the tools<br>
7 are formed accordingly, also by a spatula effect. The slider of the valve 82, which is<br>
shown in the half-open position, can be set so that the transfer chamber 78 is<br>
continuously charged with flowable material from the container 1, i.e. without<br>
interruption. Instead, the transfer chamber 78 can also be charged batchwise if the slider<br>
of the valve 82 is only intermittently opened from its closed position.<br>
As the treated material only resides in the transfer chamber 78 for a relatively short time,<br>
additional evacuation of the transfer chamber 78 or flushing with protective gas is not<br>
absolutely necessary here, in particular if the hopper 24 surrounding the transfer<br>
chamber 78 is sealed and if the feed region of the external extruder 36 is at least<br><br>
 substantially vacuum-tight. If this is not the case, the previously described measures can<br>
be used. For example, it is shown in fig. 7 that the hopper 27 is connected to the vacuum<br>
pump 6 by a line 85.<br>
In figs. 7 and 8, only a single carrier plate 8 with tools 7 is shown for reasons of<br>
simplicity. However, it is preferable if embodiments according to figs. 7 and 8 are also<br>
formed with a plurality of carrier plates 8 or other tool carriers.<br>
In figs. 7 and 8, the motor-side end of the screw 38 of the external extruder 36 is<br>
provided in a manner known per se with a sealing thread 84, the feed direction of which<br>
is the same as that of the screw 38. However, the pitch and depth of the sealing thread<br>
84 are smaller than those of the screw 38. This type of sealing thread can, of course,<br>
also be used in the other embodiments.<br>
In the embodiment according to fig. 9, a valve 82 provided with a slider regulates the<br>
discharge of the material 12 from the container 1 in a manner similar to that described in<br>
fig. 8. The material flung out of the container 1 by the tools 7 is collected in the hopper<br>
24. The level in the hopper 24 is monitored by means of the level probe 34, which<br>
controls the sliding valve 82 in a manner similar to that described for fig. 8. A vacuum<br>
sluice 28 is connected to the outlet end of the hopper 24. Its two sliders are actuated by<br>
means of cylinders 29 connected to a control means 89, to which are fed the signals<br>
from two level probes 90 monitoring the level in a further hopper 91 which is arranged<br>
downstream of the vacuum sluice 28 and is connected by means of the coupling 69 to<br>
the filling opening 35 of the extruder 36. In this embodiment, the hopper 91 does not<br>
necessarily have to be vacuum-tight, which is indicated by the broken line representing<br>
its wall. The resulting low deterioration of the material can be accepted as the material<br>
only resides in the hopper 91 for a very short time.<br>
The embodiment according to fig. 10 is similar to that according to fig. 6, but in fig. 10<br>
the valve 82 controlling the discharge from the container 1 takes the place of the feed<br>
screw 20. The two probes 34 monitoring the level in the hopper 24 deliver their signals 4<br>
to a control means 92 which controls the unit 83 of the valve 82 in a manner similar to<br>
that shown in fig. 9.<br><br>
The embodiment according to fig. 11 is structurally particularly simple: the transfer<br>
section 31 is simply formed by a channel 93 defined by a pipe 94 which directly connects<br>
the discharge opening 18 of the container 1 to the filling opening 35 of the extruder 36 in<br>
a sealed manner. The material processed in the container 1 is discharged by the<br>
centrifugal effect of the tools 7. The flowability of the material ensures that the material in<br>
the pipe 94, which is inclined towards the extruder 36, passes reliably to the filling<br>
opening 35. In this embodiment, the feed region of the extruder 36 and the transfer<br>
section 31 have to be gas-tight, since otherwise the vacuum in the container 1 is<br>
disrupted.<br>
In all embodiments, the processed plastics material, in particular PET, is not melted or<br>
plasticised until it is in the extruder 36. This can be a single-screw extruder or a multi-<br>
screw extruder and can be constructed with or without degassing.<br>
In particular if the extruder 36 is a multi-screw extruder, the variants with a dosing means<br>
46 are used. This has procedural advantages. Namely, twin screws also, plasticise well<br>
when they are only partly filled (underfed), and regulating the throughput to provide a<br>
constant throughput is possible simply by means of the regulation carried out by the<br>
dosing means. As partly filled screw turns allow atmospheric oxygen to act greatly upon<br>
the plasticised hot plastics, evacuating the dosing means 46 and the external extruder<br>
36 or flushing them with inert gas is preferable over flushing with dry air for these<br>
applications.<br><br>
