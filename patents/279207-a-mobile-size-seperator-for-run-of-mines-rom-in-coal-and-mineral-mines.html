				<td>The present invention relates to a mobile size separator for run-of-mines (ROM) in coal and mineral mines. ROM is the product of blasting and contains different sizes. The present invention particularly relates to a mobile size separator for run-of-mines (ROM) which may be used in coal and mineral mines to separate the different sizes of the run of mines (ROM). This invention also relates the parameters like weight to size ratio, which is an index of size gradation for ore/coal, and that is the ultimate requirement of the users and the equipment utilizing the same.<br>
In a mine the site of the mining keeps changing as per availability of mineral/coal, so it is very difficult to establish a fixed size separator plant at site which requires a lot of investment. In the field of ROM separation, size separator is quintessential in general, but mobile size separator will certainly fulfill the basic requirements of ROM user industries as well as ROM cost for mining industries.<br>
In industry requirement of specified particular size of raw mineral is always in demand. For inadequate sizes of the raw material purchased by the users, they have to size the material for the feed of their plant. In this process the users have to suffer not only wastage of time and initial cost invested in sizing equipment but also the material which is not suitable for their plants. For example, over size feed for boilers create much more burden on the furnace. As size of ROM coal decreases the ash content also decreases. So, high grade coal is desirable in steel plant for better quality steel production. Also less ash percentage in coal provides less wastage and increases the heat capacity of the furnace. Good quality coal also saves the liner material of furnace. Hence, ROM duly separated in different sizes can be used directly in industry where the weight to size ratio of raw material is known.<br>
The present invention provides the sizing of the run-of-mines and meets the requirements of the user industries.<br>
ROM is the product of blasting and the lump size is hammered, so it contains different sizes. Prime coal is directly sent to steel plants, whilst, coal with relatively high ash content is supplied to thermal power plants. So specific size of ROM coal is increasingly in demand by the user industries.<br>
Prior art search reveals inventions such as in the field of fluid separation, food separation, gas separations, dust separation, but not a mobile size separator for run-of-mines (ROM) in coal and mineral mines. Herein below is given the worldwide status in the field of size separator.<br>
Reference may be made to US patent No. 3,724,656, entitled as "Separating and Sorting Apparatus", as shown in figure 1 of the drawings accompanying this specification. The synopsis of this invention is given below:<br>
Apparatus for sequentially separating and distributing items from a mixed relatively compact mass of items having appendages so intertwined as to make separation difficult, comprising tandemly arranged separators for successively operating on the mass. Each separator apparatus has a hopper and an elevator. The elevator in the first separator loosens items from the initially compact mass and transfers random complements to the hopper of the second separator where they collect in the form of a loose mat. The elevator of the second separator loosens the items in the mat and transfers continuous complements to the hopper of a sorting apparatus. The hopper of each apparatus has a sloping bottom so that the mass gravitates toward its lower end and the elevator of each separator comprises a conveyor situated at the lower end of the hopper which extends upwardly relative to the bottom<br>
and has fixed to it a plurality of spaced parallel flights operable by movement upwardly relative to the bottom of the hopper to effect oscillation of the mass so as to loosen items in the mass. Eccentrics are mounted in engagement with the bottoms of the hoppers for effecting vibration thereof.<br>
As this invention, US patent No. 3,724,656, is for sequentially and distributing items from a mixed relatively compact mass of items having appendages to intertwine as to make separation difficult, comprising tandemly arranged separator for successively operating on the mass with the help of a hopper and an elevator. The function of elevator is to loosen the mass, whilst, the hopper of second separator receives loose mat in succession. This invention is not suitable for size separation of ROM, because ROM is loose mass. So function of elevator may help the ROM to fly in the air.<br>
Reference may be made to US patent No. 3,804,247, titled: "Method and Apparatus for Washing and Sizing Materials", as shown in figure 2 of the drawings accompanying this specification. The abstract is as below:<br>
Particulate material to be washed and sized is fed downwardly into the tank through the vertical perforated feed passageway and onto the perforated cone member and the surrounding perforated separator plate. Water under pressure discharged radially outwardly from the rotating nozzle mounted within the cone member and particulate material conveyed thereby is directed in a generally semi-circular path by the arcuate walls of the tank and impacts against the outer surface of the perforated passageway breaking up agglomerates of sticky clay containing mineral values and forcing water and small particles of material through the perforations in the passageway and back into the interior of the feed passageway. Small, sized particles pass downwardly<br>
through the perforations in the separator plate and cone member and into a sump while large particles which cannot pass through the perforations collect on the floor of the tank outwardly of the separator plate.<br>
This invention, US patent No. 3,804,247, particulates as well as washes the material with the help of perforated parts of equipments and high pressurized water coming from nozzles fitted in the cone wall, helps clay material in separating through the perforation, whilst small particle falls downward. First of all this invention is not suitable for size separation of ROM because the size of ROM is not fixed and lump size may choke the apparatus. This apparatus looks like a complete washing plant. As the site of mining is changed it does not suitable. Handling of the waste material of washery may creates a major problem of its disposal. In this invention water under pressure plays a critical role in washing. Mines are themselves facing a lot of water handing problem. Handling of entire water (mine water plus waste water of washery) may jeopardize the running of mines.<br>
Reference may be made to US patent No. 5,403,235, titled: "Device for Separating and screening of Bulk materials and a Self-propelled combine with such a Device", as shown in figure 3 of the drawings accompanying this specification. The device for separating and screening bulk materials, in particular crop materials, is formed by a zig-zag separator (9) with separation conduits (14) which are diverted once or several times in the vertical direction and through which a separator air stream (SL) flows, and its top and bottom which is covered by the bulk material (6, 7)-crop material-forms a screening surface (9a). The zig-zag separator (9) forms a cross flow orientation of the rising separator air flow (SL) at the bends (14a) of its separator conduits (14) and a rotating material vortex (GW) in the separator conduits (14), by means<br>
of which the light chaff/stalk parts (7) are moved upward and the grain (6) is released downward.<br>
This device, US patent No. 5,403,235, is for separating and screening bulk materials in particular crop material. Crop materials are light in comparison to ROM. So this device is not suitable for separating ROM in sizes.<br>
Reference may be made to US patent No. 5,344,576, entitled as "Continuous Particle Separation Process", as shown in Figure 4 of the drawings accompanying this specification, wherein is disclosed a continuous process for the separation of small particles from larger particles in a biological preparation passes a liquid stream of the preparation through a first filter or screen, which retains larger particles, passing smaller particles in the liquid. The large particles have retained on their surfaces wetting water, in which are entrained some of the small particles. The large particles are directed to a liquid having a concentration of smaller particles lower than the concentration of smaller particles in the wetting water, and mixed therein. The smaller particles separate from the larger particles in the mixed suspension, which is then directed to a second filter or screen, for further separation. The smaller particle/liquid stream may be recycled to the biological preparation stage, the liquid suspension for the large particles, or to a separator means where the smaller particles are separated off from the liquid stream. As the system is susceptible of being practiced as a continuous closed system, given an adequate liquid supply, the filtering steps may be repeated any number of times. When separated at the filters or screens, at least a portion of the stream of small particles and liquid must be directed to the separation means, so that said small particles may be eventually separated.<br>
This invention, US patent No. 5,344,576, is meant for the separation of small particles continuously from large particles in a biological passes a liquid stream of the preparation through a first filter or screen, which retains larger particles, passing smaller particles in the liquid. This device is not suitable at all for size separation of ROM because the size of ROM is not fixed and lump size may choke the apparatus.<br>
Reference may be made to US patent No. 4,185,746, entitled as "Particulate Size separator and Method of Operating", as shown in figure 5 of the drawings accompanying this specification, wherein: Size separation is effected upon coal, ores, pellets of various sizes and other particulates by depositing the particulate material in an inclined rotating separator vessel having a flat bottom with a central orifice and peripheral sidewalls. As the separator vessel rotates the particulates are carried upwardly and churned by the movement of the vessel. The larger particulates accumulate upon the top of the body of particulates in the separator and eventually overflow over the lip of the vessel while the smaller particulates accumulate in the lower portion of the body of particulates and are then carried up by the movement of the vessel and pass out of the vessel through the central orifice.<br>
This invention, US patent No. 4,185,746, depicts that the particulate material are carried upward as the separator vessel rotates and churned by the movement by the movement of the vessel. The larger particulates gather upon the top of the vessel and eventually overflow over the lip of the vessel, whilst, the smaller particulates accommodate in the lower portion of the body of particulates and are then carried up by the movement of the vessel and pass out of the vessel through the central orifice. This device does not separate the size in equality rather than mingled. It only separate in two sizes<br>
smaller and larger. So this device is not pertinent for size separation of ROM because it is unable to meet the demands of industries, especially for those who used a particular size material.<br>
Reference may be made to patent No. WO2006107913 entitled as 'Mobile Sorting Unit', wherein is disclosed a mobile sorting unit and method separates commingled material by both size and at least one other characteristic, such as mass. The unit may include a platform adapted for mobile transport and a sorting unit supported on the platform. The sorting unit includes an inlet hopper, an oversize separator station for separating oversized material from the commingled material, and an undersize separator station for separating undersize material from the commingled material. A mass separator station is adapted to receive the material exiting the undersize separator station outlet and direct light material toward a light material discharge area and heavy material toward a heavy material discharge area.<br>
This device separate only three sizes of material. This device is not pertinent for size separation of ROM because it is unable to meet the demands of industries, especially for those who used a particular size material.<br>
Reference may be made to US patent No. 6,827,222 entitled as 'Gravel sorter', which describes a mobile gravel sorter, which is arranged to move in a direction of travel along a road, comprising a gathering unit which is arranged to gather up granular material from a roadway as the gravel sorter moves in the direction of travel, a sorting unit (30) for sorting and supplying to the roadway the amount of the material that is smaller than a given grain size, and a collecting unit for collecting material exceeding said given grain<br>
 <br>
size. The sorting unit (30) comprises a substantially circular drum which is arranged after the gathering unit in the direction of travel and which has a center axis (32), an inlet means in connection with the gathering unit and an outlet means which is arranged in connection with the collecting unit and separated from the inlet means in the longitudinal diction of the drum, at least one scerw conveyor (34, 35) which extends in the drum between the inlet means and the outlet means about a helical axis which is substantially concentric with the center axis (32) of the drum, and a screen cloth means (37) which is arranged to cover openings in the circumferential surface of the drum.<br>
This device seems to be suitable for building / road construction application and not to separate the different sizes in equality rather than mingled. So this device is not pertinent for size separation of ROM because it is unable to meet the demands of industries, because lump size may jam the drum screw conveyor which works with a particular size-range material.<br>
Reference may be made to US patent No. 6,220,426 entitled as 'Mobile item-sorting unit having an endless belt provided with an item-restraining curb structure1, the item-sorting unit includes a mobile frame movable in a direction of motion, and a driven endless belt mounted on the frame for rotation in a cross direction extending transversely relative to the direction of frame motion. An outer surface of the belt includes one or more upstanding curbs extending parallel to the cross direction. The curb(s) is formed of a flexible high-friction material and functions to resist movement of carried items relative to the belt.<br>
This device is not a continuous separator because it lifts material from ground in the direction of motion only. So this device is not pertinent for size<br>
separation of ROM because it is unable to meet the demands of industries, especially for those who used a particular size material.<br>
All the aforesaid inventions are not suitable for the size separation of ROM due to their limitations as explained herein above. As the ROM is the post-blasting product which contains different sizes, but the requirement of the customers of the mining industry are material of specified particular sizes, the mining industry has to supply the mingled size ROM at depreciated costs. Hence, to meet the need of mining industry in providing good quality ROM product to the user industries entails a device to be invented.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a mobile size separator for run-of-mines (ROM) in coal and mineral mines, which obviates the drawbacks of the hitherto known prior art as detailed herein above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a mobile size separator for run-of-mines (ROM) in coal and mineral mines, which is capable of providing size by weight ratio of run-of-mines in terms of size gradation of supply material.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a mobile size separator for run-of-mines (ROM) in coal and mineral mines, which can be utilized from site to site at any spot or any position of a belt conveyor.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a mobile size separator for run-of-mines (ROM) in coal and mineral mines, to save the cost of feed material to user industries.<br>
Still yet another object of the present invention is to provide a mobile size separator for run-of-mines (ROM) in coal and mineral mines, which will help in saving cost of individual size separator equipment where particular size raw material is used as feed.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide a mobile size separator for run-of-mines (ROM) in coal and mineral mines, which will obviate damage to equipment due to usage of mingled different sizes of raw material at the receiving end.<br>
In the present invention there is provided a mobile size separator for run-of-mines (ROM) in coal and mineral mines, wherein size separation is effected on run-of-mines (ROM) by controlling the ROM feed coming from conveyor belt by means of a vertical steel telescopic column mounted horizontal blade capable of vertical movement and depositing through a hopper the particulate material coming from conveyor belt onto continually vibrating perforated-screen trays. A series of different aperture perforated-screen trays is made to vibrate by connecting these with a cam shaft which is rotated about vertical axis by a motor. The rotary motion of the cam shaft is converted into reciprocating motion by means of a connecting link to the said perforated-screen trays which creates vibration. Oversize of different perforated-screen trays is collected in different receiving bins/trays which are placed one-by-one just beneath the different size separating perforated-screen trays, whilst, under size material is deposited in next perforated-screen tray through a chute. The entire combination being mounted on the chassis of a heavy duty wheeled vehicle which makes it mobile.<br>
The mobile size separator of the present invention for run-of-mines (ROM) in coal and mineral mines, is illustrated in figure 6 of the drawings accompanying this specification. The size separator of the present invention used for separation of run-of-mines (ROM) is mounted on chassis platform (11) of a heavy duty wheeled vehicle (1). The ROM feed (7) coming from conveyor belt (5) is controlled by a horizontal blade (6) capable of up and down movement by means of a long vertical steel telescopic column (8) mounted on the chassis platform (11) of heavy duty wheeled vehicle (1). Size separation is effected on run-of-mines (ROM) by controlled deposition through a hopper (4) of particulate material of the ROM feed (7) coming from conveyor belt (5) by means of by a long vertical steel telescopic column (8) mounted horizontal blade (6) capable of up-down movement. The particulate material (7) coming from conveyor belt (5) is dropped through hopper (4) onto a continually vibrating series of vertically placed different aperture perforated-screen trays (2) each having a bottom chute. The top tray having the largest aperture. Oversize of each of the perforated-screen trays is collected in adjacent receiving bin/trays (3) which are placed one-by-one just beneath the different size separating perforated-screen trays, whilst, under size material is deposited in next perforated-screen tray through the bottom chute. The series of different aperture perforated-screen trays (2) is made vibrating by connecting each of the trays through a connecting link (12) and a spring (13) with a rotatable vertical cam shaft (10) which is rotated about vertical axis by a prime mover, such as a motor (9). The rotary motion of the cam shaft (10) is converted into reciprocating motion by means of a connecting link (12) to a spring (13) under loaded perforated-screen tray which creates vibration. To measure the weight of size separated material, a weighing sensor (14) is suitablely placed at the bottom of each of the receiving bins (3).<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a mobile size separator for run-of-mines (ROM) in coal and mineral mines, which comprises in combination a size separator for run-of-mines (ROM) mounted on chassis platform (11) of a heavy duty wheeled vehicle (1); characterized in that the said vehicle (1) chassis platform (11) mounted size separator for run-of-mines (ROM) consists in combination a vertical telescopic column (8) mounted horizontal blade (6) capable of feeding ROM (7) from conveyor (5) onto a hopper (4) being fixed above a series of vertically placed descending order aperture perforated-screen trays (2) each having a bottom chute and an adjacent receiving bin/tray (3) provided with a weighing sensor (14) being placed one-by-one just beneath the different size separating perforated-screen trays; each of the said series of vertically placed descending order aperture perforated-screen trays (2) being connected through a connecting link (12) and a spring (13) to a vertical cam shaft (10) capable of being rotated about vertical axis by a prime mover (9).<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the series of vertically placed descending order aperture perforated-screen trays (2) each having a bottom chute being movably fixed on a vertical column mounted on the chassis platform (11) of the heavy duty wheeled vehicle (1).<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the series of adjacent receiving bin/tray (3) provided with a weighing sensor (14) being placed one-by-one just beneath the different size separating perforated-screen trays is fixed onto a vertical column mounted on the chassis platform (11) of the heavy duty wheeled vehicle (1).<br>
 <br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the series of adjacent receiving bin/tray (3) capable of collecting the oversize of each vibrating tray is stationary and imperforated.<br>

single cam shaft operated by a single motor.<br>
(c)	Receiving bins with weight measurement system are arranged in<br>
a single vertical column to collect the output.<br>
The mobility to size separator for run-of-mines (ROM) of the present invention is provided by a heavy duty wheeled vehicle/truck having mounted on its chassis. The size separator for run-of-mines (ROM) of the present invention consists of a series of vertically placed descending order aperture perforated-screen trays which are capable of vibrating. The combination of vertically placed perforated trays are mounted one after another in different levels on a vertical column fixed onto the truck chassis. All the vertically<br>
 <br>
placed vibratory perforated trays being connected by means, such as connecting link and spring with a vertical cam shaft capable of rotating on its vertical axis.

The following examples are given by way of illustration of the working of the invention in actual practice and should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention in any way.<br>
Example-1<br>
A prototype of the mobile size separator for run-of-mines (ROM) in accordance with the present specification was fabricated. In the Dhanbad coal belt area, trials of the device were carried out at a mine site. Approximately one tonne coal coming from conveyor belt which was at a height of 4m from the ground, was cut off by the horizontal blade fitted by means of telescopic column, and poured into the hopper of the truck mounted size separator. The prototype was provided with five sets of perforated screens having aperture 100mm, 75mm, 50mm, 25mm &amp;10mm, respectively. The vibratory movement to the perforated screens was provided by means of the cam shaft duly attached by connecting links. +100mm<br>
coal/ROM was collected at the upper receiving bin, whilst, -10mm size in the lowest bin. In between the top and bottom most bins bins, the other sizes of particulate namely +25mm, +50mm, +75mm were collected in the bins placed just beneath the respective size separating screens.<br>
The sensors for weight duly attached in the bottom of the receiving bins were found to be working satisfactorily. And the weight of the size separated coal was checked with the general weighing machine. The error was within permissible limit of ±1%. So weight to size ratio which is an index of coal grade was successfully ascertained.<br>
The new results achieved due to the inventive steps are:<br>
(a)	It can work at any required site without disturbing the running production<br>
process.<br>
(b)	Feed control mechanism to hopper from running conveyor belt.<br>
(c)	Weighing the particular size separated continuously accumulated in the<br>
receiving bin.<br>
(d)	Instant size separation of particulate material with display of analyzed<br>
output.<br>
The main advantages of the present invention are:<br>
1.	To provide a mobile size separator used for parting the run-of-mines in<br>
different sizes.<br>
2.	To provide size by weight ratio of run-of-mines in terms of grade of supply<br>
material.<br>
3.	Applicable from site to site at any spot or any position of a belt conveyor.<br>
4.	To save the cost of particular size feed material to user industries.<br>
5 To save the initial installation cost of the size separator equipment where particular size raw material is used as feed.<br>
6. To save the equipments which has adverse effect due to usage of mingled different sizes of raw material.<br>
