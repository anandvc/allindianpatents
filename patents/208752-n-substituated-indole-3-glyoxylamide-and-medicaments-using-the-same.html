Inhibition of the "late phase" eosinophilia in the BAL 24 hours after allergen challenge in guinea pigs<br>
Male guinea pigs (200 - 250 g, Dunkin Hartley Shoe) were actively sensitized subcutaneously with ovalbumin (10  g of ovalbumin + 1 mg of A1(OH)3) and boosted 2 weeks later. One week after boosting with ovalbumin, the animals were exposed to an inhalation challenge with ovalbumin (0.5 % strength solution) for 20 - 30 seconds. 24 hours later, the animals were killed by means of an overdose of urethane, exsanguinated and a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was carried out using 2 x 5 ml of 0.9 % strength physiological saline solution.<br>
The lavage fluid was collected and centrifuged at 400 g for 10 minutes, and the pellets were suspended in 1 ml of 0.9 V strength physiological saline solution. The eosinophile were counted microscopically in a Neubauer chamber after staining by means of Beeton Dickinson test kit No. 5877. This test kit contains Phlox in B as a selective stain for eosinophils. The eosinophils in the BAL was [sic] counted here for each animal and expressed as eosinophils (millions/animal). For each group the mean value and standard deviation were determined. The percentage inhibition of eosinophilia for the group treated with test substance was calculated according to the following formula:<br>
(A - B) - (B - C) / (A - C) x 100 = % inhibition<br>
in this formula A eosinophils correspond to the untreated challenge group, B eosinophils to the treated group and C eosinophils to the unchallenged control group.<br>
The animals were treated with a histamine H, antagonist (azelastine; 0.01 mg/kg p.o.) 2 hours before allergen challenge to avoid death. The administration of the test substances or of the vehicle was carried out 4<br><br>
-  8-<br>
hours after allergen challenge. The percentage inhibition of eosinophilia in the BAL was calculated on groups of 6 - 10 animals.<br>

Assays for the determination of peptidylprolyl iaomerase (PPIaae) activity and inhibition<br>
The PPIase activity of the cyclophilins was measured enzymatically according to Fischer et al. (1984). After isomerization of the substrate by the peptidyl prolyl isomerase, this is accessible to chymotrypsin, which cleaves the chromophore p-nitroaniline. For the determination of inhibition of the PPIase activity by substance, recombinant human Cyp B was used. The interaction of Cyp B with a potential inhibitor was carried out as follows:<br>
A certain concentration of purified Cyp B was incubated with 1  M substance for 15 min. The PPIase reaction was started by addition of the substrate solution to the reaction mixture which contains HEPES buffer, chymotrypsin and either test or control samples. Under these conditions, first-order kinetics were obtained with a constant Kobserved = Ko + Kent, where Kc is the spontaneous isomerization and Kent is the rate of isomerization of the PPIase activity. The extinction values which correspond to the amount of the chromophore cleaved were measured using a Beckman DU 70<br><br>

spectrophotometer at a constant reaction tempareture of<br>
The observed rasidual activity in the presence of various substances was compared with the cyclophilins only treated with solvent, The results were given in % residual activity. Cyclosporin A (CsA) was used as the reference  compound. The inhibition of the PPIase activity was additionally checked by SDS-PAGE.<br>
Colorimetric assay (based on the MTT test) for the non-<br>
radioacfcive quantification, of cell proliferation and survival ability<br>
MTT is used for the quantitative determination of cell proliferation and activation, for example, in the reaction on growth factors and cytokines such as IL-2 and IL-4 and also for the quantification of the<br>
antiproliferative or toxic effects.<br>
The assay is based on the cleavage of yellow tetrazolium salt MTT to give purple-red formazan crystals by metabolically active cells.<br>
The cells, cultured in a 96-hole tissue culture plate, are incubated for about 4 h with yellow MTT solution. After this incubation time, purple-red formazan salt crystals are formed. These salt crystals are insoluble in aqueous solutions, but can be dissolved by addition of solubilizer and by  incubation of  the  plates<br>
The dissolved formazan product is quantified spectrophotometrically  using  an  ELISA  reader.  An<br>
increase in the number of living cells results in an increase in the total metabolic activity in the sample. This increase correlates directly with the amount of the purple-red formazan crystals, formed, which are [sic] measured by the absorption.<br><br>

- 21 -<br>
General procedure for the preparation of the compounds of the general formula 1 according to Scheme 2<br>
1st stage:<br>
The indole derivative dissolved in a solvent, such as given  above  for  oxalyl  chloride,  which  can  be unsubstituted or substituted on C-2 or in the phenyl ring, is added dropwise at a temperature between -5°C and +5°C to a solution of a simply molar up to 60% excess  amount  of  oxalyl  chloride prepared under a nitrogen atmosphere in an aprotic or nonpolar solvent, such as, for example, in diethyl ether, methyl tert-butyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane or alternatively dichloromethane. The reaction solution is then heated for a to 5 hours to a temperature between 1O°C and 120°C, preferably between 20°C and 80°C, particularly between  30°C  and  60°C,  and  the  solvent  is  then evaporated.  The residue of the  (indol-3-yl)glyoxylic acid chloride which remains is dissolved or suspended in  an  aprotic  solvent,   such  as,   for  example, tetrahydrofuran,  dioxane,  diethyl ether,  toluene or alternatively in a dipolar aprotic solvent, such as, for example,  dimethylformamide,  dimethylacetamide or dimethyl sulfoxide,  cooled to a temperature between -10°C and +10°C, preferably to -5°C to 0°C, and treated with a solution of the primary or secondary amine in a diluent in the presence of an acid scavenger. Possible diluents are the solvents used for the dissolution of the   "indolyl-3-glyoxylic   acid   chloride".   Acid scavengers    used    are    triethylamine,    pyridin, dimethylaminopyridine,  basic  ion  exchanger.  sodium carbonate,  potassium  carbonate,  powdered  potassium hydroxide  and  excess  primary  or  secondary  amine employed for the reaction. The reaction takes place at a  temperature  from  0°C  to  12O°C,  preferably  at 20 - 80°C, particularly between 40°C and 60°C. After a reaction time of 1  - 4 hours and standing at room temperature for 24 hours, the precipitate is digested<br><br>
- 22 -<br>
with water, and the solid is filtered off with suction and dried in vacuo. The desired compound is purified by recrystallization in an organic solvent or by column chromatography on silica gel or alumina. The solvent used is, for example, a mixture of dichloromethane and ethanol (10:1, vol/vol).<br>
2nd staoe<br>
The "indol-3-ylglyoxylamide" obtained according to the<br>
abovementioned 1st Stage procedure is dissolved in a<br>
protic,  dipolar aprotic or nonpolar organic solvent,<br>
such as, for example, in isopropanol, tetrahydrofuran,<br>
dimethyl   sulfoxide,    dimethylformamide,   dimethyl-<br>
acetamide,  N-methylpyrrolidone,  dioxane,  toluene  or<br>
methylene chloride and added dropwise to a suspension<br>
of  a base  such  as,  for  example,  sodium  hydride,<br>
powdered potassium hydroxide, potassium tert-butoxide,<br>
dimethylaminopyridine or sodium amide in a suitable<br>
solvent, in a molar amount or in excess prepared in a<br>
3-necked  flask  under  an N2  atmosphere.  The  desired<br>
alkyl, aralkyl or heteroaralkyl halide is then added<br>
either in undiluted form or in a diluent which was also<br>
used,   for  example,   to  dissolve  the   "indol- 3 -yl<br>
glyoxylamide",  if  appropriate  with  addition  of  a<br>
catalyst, such as, for example, copper, and the mixture<br>
is allowed to react for some time, e.g. 30 minutes to<br>
12 hours, and the temperature is kept within a range<br>
between 0°C and 120°C,  preferably between 3 0°C and<br>
80°C,   particularly  between   50   and  70°C.   After<br>
completion of the reaction,  the reaction mixture  is<br>
added to water, the solution is extracted, for example,<br>
with diethyl ether, dichloromethane, chloroform, methyl<br>
tert-butyl ether, tetrahydrofuran or N-butanol and the<br>
organic phase obtained in each case is dried using<br>
anhydrous sodium sulfate.<br>
The organic phase is concentrated in vacuo, the residue which remains is crystallized by trituration or the oily residue is purified by distillation or by column<br><br>
- 23 -<br>
chromatography or flash chromatography on silica gel or alumina. The eluent used is, for example, a mixture of methylene chloride and diethyl ether in the ratio 8:2 (vol/vol) or a mixture of methylene chloride and ethanol in the ratio 9:1 (v/v).<br>
Working Examples<br>
