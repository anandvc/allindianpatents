				<td>COLORED NANOLITHOGRAPHY ON GLASS AND PLASTIC SUBSTRATES<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to Colored Nanolithography on glass and plastic substrates.<br>
Particularly, the present invention relates to a simple, versatile and inexpensive method of<br>
generating submicron-scale color pattern on various surfaces such as overhead projector<br>
paper (OHP) and glass. More particularly, the present invention relates to method for<br>
generating colored parallel lines with submicron scale spacing between each other and<br>
microarrays of ink spots positioned at predetermined angles and spacing. The method of<br>
the present invention has enormous application potential in information storage, in storing<br>
hidden information in currency notes, in sensors, and in so called "E-paper" for displays.<br>
The use of flexible plastic material like OHP paper enhances the possibility of storing<br>
designs in foldable substrates.<br>
Background Art<br>
Generating fast, easy, inexpensive, high resolution two and three dimensional patterned<br>
structures on solid surfaces has been a challenge leading to the discovery of a number of<br>
methods for imprinting patterns in addition to photolithography. Important among them are<br>
soft lithography and micropen lithography. In soft lithography, different micromolding<br>
techniques are used to generate structures at multiple length scales and dimensions using a<br>
variety of substrates and imprint materials. Molecular self-assembly has helped improve<br>
the resolution of structures further. All these methods are guided by applications such as<br>
microreactors, sensors, microelectromechanical systems, electronic devices at micro and<br>
nano scales.<br>
Reference can be made to Xia, Y Whitesides, G. M. Angew, Chem. Int. Ed. 1998,37,550<br>
wherein soft lithographic methods were discussed. Reference of micropen lithography can<br>
be found in Fan, H.; Lu, Y.; Stump, A.; Reed, S. T.; Baer, T.; Schunk, R.; Perez-Luna, V.;<br>
Lopez, G. P., Drinker, C. J. Nature 2000, 405, 56. However, none of the above methods<br>
has emphasized the generation of colored pattern that has enormous application potential in<br>
information storage, sensors, the so-called "E - paper" for displays. Storage of information<br>
in "true" colors is expected to shorten the processing time for retrieval of information<br>
considerably. Also, imprinting of patterns on flexible plastic materials might enhance the<br>
versatility towards material application. Although, ink-jet printing has been used to obtain<br>
organic light emitting devices of doped polymers, there have been no reports of generating<br>
patterns on color at the submicron scale.<br>
The drawback of the present method of nanolithography by using a stamp is that it<br>
employs only non-colored stamping of materials on different substrates. Thus there is no<br>
example of colored nanolithography in the form of stamping otherwise known as soft<br>
lithography in the literature. The fundamental drawback of the present method is that there<br>
is no scope of storing colored information (image) in this method. Thus storage and<br>
retrieval of colored information (picture etc.) is either not possible or not specified at all.<br>
Indeed there is a need for new methods of generation of colored nanolithography that will<br>
be useful for storing colored information, sensors, catalysts etc, In addition, there is no<br>
example of stamping with nanometer resolution on plastic substrates. This is important as<br>
one could store information in the form of electronic materials made of plastic substrates.<br>
There is a need to have colored nanolithographic patterns on plastic substrates and glass.<br>
Objects of the Invention<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide Colored Nanolithography on glass<br>
and plastic substrate, which obviates the drawbacks as, detailed above.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides for the first time a method for nanolithography in colour<br>
using the principle of soft lithography. As demonstration of the present method, the<br>
Inventors have used permanent marker pen ink of various colors as the "ink" and<br>
components of commercially available compact disk as the mold (stamp) to store<br>
information.<br>

Detailed Description of the Present Invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for generating colored<br>
nanolithography patterns of parallel lines or cross pattern lines on a glass or plastic<br>
substrate, said process consisting the steps of pressing a polycarbonate or aluminium mold<br>
obtained from a compact disk on a previously inked glass or plastic surface for one or<br>
more times to create lithographic patterns of parallel coloured lines or cross pattern lines.<br>
More particularly, the present invention provides a process for generating colored<br>
nanolithography patterns of parallel lines or cross pattern lines on a glass or plastic<br>
substrate, said process consisting the steps of:<br>
(a) inking the glass or plastic substrate using a permanent marker ink;<br>
(b) allowing the ink to get semi-dried by keeping the substrate in air for about 30 to 90<br>
seconds;<br>
(c) pressing a polycarbonate or aluminium mold obtained from a compact disk on the<br>
semi-dried inked glass or plastic substrate for one or more times, and<br>
(d) drying the glass or plastic substrate.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the polycarbonate or aluminium mold is<br>
pressed at predetermined angle to create cross pattern lines on the glass or plastic substrate.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the substrate is inked using permanent<br>
marker ink.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the polycarbonate or aluminium<br>
mould is pressed on the inked surface after the inked surface has dried for about 1 minute<br>
in air.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the polycarbonate or aluminium<br>
mould is pressed on the glass or plastic substrate either manually or using a pressing<br>
machine.<br>
In one more embodiment of the present invention, the polycarbonate or aluminium mould<br>
is pressed on the glass or plastic substrate for at least 5 seconds to impart the pattern of<br>
parallel lines or cross pattern lines.<br>
In a one another embodiment of the present invention, the plastic substrate is an overhead<br>
projector (OHP) sheet.<br>
The present invention introduces a simple, versatile and inexpensive method of generating<br>
submicron-scale color patterns on various surfaces. Permanent marker pens of various<br>
colors are used to write on overhead projector (OHP) paper. The molds used were the<br>
polycarbonate disk and aluminum foil line patterns in an ordinary compact disc (CD). A<br>
line mark was made with the help of an OHP pen on the OHP paper and then the mold was<br>
placed on the mark after about a minute, finger pressed before the ink had completely<br>
dried. The Inventors have used marker pens with various colors of ink for generating<br>
patterns of various colors. The same procedure was used for generating pattern on a glass<br>
slide.<br>
A compact disk is typically made of polycarbonate plastic, about 1.2mm thick. Patterns are<br>
drilled in the form of a single spiral track on polycarbonate disk. This gives rise to<br>
microscopic bumps on polycarbonate disk. A thin, reflective aluminum layer is sputtered<br>
onto the disk covering the bumps. Then a thin acrylic layer is sprayed over the aluminum<br>
to protect it. The typical width and depth of each line in the spiral track on polycarbonate<br>
disk is 0.8 and O.Sum respectively, and separation between two such lines is about, 6um<br>
(Figure 1). As the diameter of a typical CD is much larger than the separation between two<br>
lines, under an optical microscope the lines appear parallel with nearly infinite radii of<br>
curvatures. The aluminum coating on the polycarbonate membrane also has the structural<br>
patterns that appear as parallel lines under an optical microscope. The polycarbonate disk<br>
and the aluminum foil are separated and are independently used as molds for generating<br>
two-dimensional pattern. For experiments the Inventors have used parts of both the<br>
aluminum foil and the polycarbonate disk to imprint patterns. Optical micrographs of<br>
patterns found in polycarbonate disk and aluminum foil in a CD are shown in Figure 2. It<br>
is clear from the optical micrographs that even after the CD is dismantled, the original<br>
lines remain intact and hence could be used as molds. It may be mentioned here that there<br>
are in general two kinds of CD available in the market. The first one is a permanent CD<br>
and has a pattern shown in Figure 1. While the second one is a recordable CD and does not<br>
contain bumps but has continuous lines as shown in-figure 2. The Inventors have used a<br>
recordable CD in the examples of the present invention. However, a person of ordinary<br>
skill in the art can also use a pre-recorded CD having pattern as shown in figure 1 to<br>
generate pattern on the plastic or glass substrate.<br>
A schematic view of the present method of imprinting patterns on various surfaces is<br>
shown in Figure 3. Ordinary lines drawn using blue, green, and red permanent marker pens<br>
on OHP paper or glass surface and optical micrographs of each of them after imprints of<br>
pattern from molds are shown in Figure 4(A-C). The colors in the micrographs are true<br>
colors of the imprints. As clear from the figures, just pressing the disk onto the ink could<br>
draw distinct parallel lines of submicron scale. Similar procedure can be adopted while<br>
using aluminnium foil as a mold. Cross-patterns can also be generated on glass by a<br>
polycarbonate mold. In each case, at first the marker pen drew a single line on a glass slide.<br>
The polycarbonate mold was then pressed onto the line to make parallel microlines as<br>
before. The mold was then placed on the line at an angle different from the first position<br>
and then pressed. The result was the production of a microarray of ink dots positioned at<br>
angles determined by the relative angles of positioning of the molds. Arrays, shown in<br>
Figure 4(D), were generated by positioning the mold perpendicular with respect to initial<br>
imprints.<br>
The Inventors were also successful in generating patterns on already dried inked surfaces.<br>
The same has been achieved by making the ink wet by keeping the surface in an ethanol<br>
chamber. A substrate having overnight dried permanent ink mark (for example a line) was<br>
kept in an ethanol or toluene chamber for about 10 seconds. The ethanol chamber was<br>
made of a beaker with a cap containing about 5 ml of ethanol soaked with ordinary filter<br>
paper for about two hours prior to use. After about 10 seconds, the substrate is removed<br>
from the ethanol or toluene chamber and the polycarbonate or alluminium mould was<br>
pressed on the inked surface to impart the nanolithographic pattern. The surface was dried<br>
to obtain the colored nanolithographic image. Figure 5 shows the optical micrograph<br>
obtained by following the aforesaid procedure.<br>
The resolution of the patterned lines could be increased using a mold with lines and<br>
patterns of higher resolution. The same principle could be used for imprinting designed<br>
arrays of various materials on plastic and glass substrates in accordance with their use.<br>
The main advantages of the present invention are:<br>
1. Introduction of the concept of nanolithography in colour using the principle of soft<br>
lithography.<br>
2. The use of flexible plastic material like OHP paper enhances the possibility of<br>
storing designs in foldable substrates.<br>
3. Storage of information in "true" colors may help shorten the processing time for<br>
retrieval of information considerably.<br>
4. Manufacturing of arrays of colored materials for applications in sensors, displays<br>
etc.<br><br><br><br><br>
