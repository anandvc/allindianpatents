2-Thio-substituted imidazole derivatives and their use in pharmacy<br>
The present invention relates to 2-thio-substituted imidazole derivatives having immunomodulating and cytokine-release-inhibiting action, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds and to their use in pharmacy.<br>
Pharmacologically active imidazole compounds with antiinflammatory activity are<br>
already known.<br>
Thus, inter alia, compounds having 4,5-di(hetero)arylimidazole moieties have been<br>
examined more closely, and various pharmaceutical actions thereof have been<br>
described. Also known are compounds which are substituted in the 2-position.<br>
US patent 4,585,771 discloses 4,5-diphenylimidazole derivatives which are<br>
substituted in the 2-position by a pyrrolyl, indolyl, imidazoly! orthiazolyl radical and<br>
which have antiinflammatory and antiallergic activity.<br>
US patents 4,528,298 and 4,402,960 describe 4,5-di(hetero)arylimidazole derivatives<br>
which are substituted in the 2-position via a thio, sulfinyl or sulfonyl group by a<br>
phenyl, pyridyl, N-oxypyridyl, pyrimidyl. thiazolyl orthienyl radical and which have<br>
antiinflammatory and antiallergic activity.<br>
US patents 4,461,770 and 4,584,310 describe 4-{5-aryl)-5-(4-heteroaryi)imidazole<br>
derivatives which are substituted in the 2-position via a thio, sulfinyl or sulfonyl group<br>
by a substituted or unsubstituted aliphatic hydrocarbon and which, inter alia, have<br>
antiinflammatory action.<br>
DE 198 42 833 relates to 4-heteroaryi-5-phenylimidazole derivatives which are substituted in the 2-position by a phenylalkylthio group. These compounds act as antiinflammatories and inhibitors of cytokine release. WO 99/03837 and WO 93/14081 describe 2-substituted imidazoles which inhibit the synthesis of a number of inflammatory cytokines. The compounds described in WO 93/14081 have in the 2-position. attached via a sulfur atom, a phosphorus-containing substituent or an aryl or heteroaryl substituent. WO 91/10662 describes imidazole derivatives which inhibit the acyl-CoA: cholesterol 0-acyl transferase and binding of thromboxane TxA2. WO 95/00501 describes imidazole derivatives which can be used as cyclooxygenase inhibitors. The imidazole derivatives described in DE 28 23 197 A have antiinflammatory, antiallergic and immunostimulating action,<br>
J. Med. Chem. 1996, 39, 3927-37 describes compounds having 5-Iipoxygenase- and cyclooxygenase-inhibiting action, 2-(4-methylsulfinylphenyl)-4-{4-fluorophenyl-5-{pyrid-4-yl)imidazole also having cytokine-inhibiting action.<br><br>
It has been found that the known compounds are unstable and difficult to process, or that their efficacy is low.<br>
In spite of the fact that numerous compounds are known, there is therefore still a need for compounds having antiinflammatory action which inhibit cytokine release.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide such compounds.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that certain 2-substituted imidazole derivatives provide stable compounds which are readily processible and which have high immunomodulating and/or cytokine-release-inhibiting activity.<br>

Variant 1<br>
The synthesis of the substituted imidazole-2-thiones is carried out according to the course of the reaction of scheme 1, using ethyl isonicotinate and 4-fluorophenyl-acetonitrile as starting materials.<br>
The starting materials are converted in a condensation reaction with the aid of metallic sodium in an alcohol, for example ethanol, into 2-cyano-2-(4-fluorophenyi)-1-(4-pyridyl)ethanone (compound 1). The cyano group is then removed by hydrolysis, for example with hydrobromic acid, and decarboxylation, giving 2-(4-fuorophenyl)-1-{4-pyridyl)ethanone (compound 2). In the next step, compound 2 is nitrosated in the 2-position using, for example, nitrites, such as sodium nitrite or isoamyl nitrite.<br><br>
This gives the compound of the formula (3), the oxime 2-(4-fluorophenyl)-1-(4-pyridyl)-a-hydroxyiminoethane.<br>
Using this intermediate, cyclization giving an imidazole derivative of the formula (4), a substituted 5-(4-fluorophenyi)-4-(4-pyridyl)imidazole N-oxide which carries the substituent R^ at the nitrogen atom in 3-position, is carried out by reaction with an imine of the general formula H2C=NRi, which is present as a 1,3,5-trisubstJtuted hexahydro-1,3,5-triazine. in an alcoholic solvent, such as ethanol, and at elevated temperature (50-90°C). The imidazole N-oxide of the formula (4) is then reacted with 2,2.4,4-tetramethyl-3-thiocyclobutanone in a chlorinated solvent to give the corresponding 3-substituted 5-(4-fluorophenyl)-4-(4-pyridyl)imidazole-2-thione (compound 5; compound of the formula I where R2 = H).<br><br>
Scheme 1:<br>
Synthesis route for the thiones according to the invention (variant 1)<br><br><br>
Variant 2<br>
Initially, the oxime compound of the formula (3), 2-(4-fluorophenyl)-1-(4-pyridyl)-a-hydroxyiminoethane, is prepared as described in variant 1 (scheme 1, steps 1 to 3). Using this starting material, the synthesis of the substituted imidazoie-2-thiones is carried out according to scheme 2.<br><br><br>
2-(4-Fluorophenyl)-1-(4-pyridyl)-α-hydroxyiminoethane is, according to scheme 2, reacted with the selected amine of the general formula NH2-R1 and formaldehyde, giving, with ring closure, a compound of the formula (6), i.e. a 1-substituted 4-(4-fluorophenyi)-5-(4-pyhdyi)imida2ol-2-one. This is reacted with an excess of phosphorus oxychloride, resulting in a compound of the formula (7), i.e. a 1-substituted 4-(4-fluorophenyl)-5-(4-pyridyi)imidazole 2-chloride being formed. From this compound, the corresponding 1-substituted 4-(4-fluorophenyl)-5-{4-pyridyl)-imidazole-2-thione (compound 5) is obtained by reaction with 4-chlorobenzylthiol in a polar aprotic solvent and at elevated temperature (lOO-ISO^C).<br>
2) Preparation of the 2-thioimidazole compound<br>
The thione compounds (5) obtained according to variant 1 or 2 are converted by substitution of the sulfur atom in the 2-position into the compounds of the formula I according to the invention where R^ ^ H, The substitutions can be carried out in a known manner by a nucleophilic substitution reaction, as shown in an exemplary manner for some compounds in scheme 3. Here, compound 5 is reacted with R^-X in an inert polar solvent, such as an alcohol. X is a readily exchangeable group, such as Hal, in particular CI. Br. 1, methylsulfonyl, tosyl etc.<br>
2-Thioimida2o(e compounds in which the sulfur atom [lacuna] 2-position is substituted by a vinyl radical can be obtained by nucleophilic addition of compound 5 to a triple bond. To this end, 5 is reacted with a base, for example an alkali metal alkoxide in the corresponding alcohol, and then with an excess of the compound with the triple bond.<br>
The corresponding bisaryl thioethers are prepared from the 3-substituted 2-chloro-4-(4-fluorophenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)imidazole (compound 7 from scheme 2). The compounds (7) are reacted with two equivalents of the appropriate thiophenol in an aprotic solvent, such as dimethylformamide, giving compounds of the formula (12).<br>
The corresponding regioisomeric compounds can be prepared in accordance with scheme (5). Starting with 1-(4-fIuorophenyl)-2-(4-pyridyl)-α-hydroxyiminoethanone (obtained analogously to scheme 1), compounds of the formula 15 are obtained analogously to the process of scheme 1 by reaction with the appropriate imines. Compound (13) can be prepared by the process described in WO 93/14081.<br><br>
Scheme 3:<br><br><br>
Scheme 4: Bisaryl thioethers<br><br><br><br>
These compounds can be reacted further as described in scheme 3.<br>
The imidazolethiols which carry a C1-C4-alkyl group in the 4-position are obtained from the corresponding α-hydroxyiminoethanones (compound 17/19 in scheme 6 below), analogously to schemes 1 and 2.<br><br><br>
These compounds can be reacted further according to schemes 3 and 4. The corresponding regioisomeric compounds can be prepared analogously to scheme 5.<br>
Compounds of the formula I which carry a C1-C4-alkylsulfanyl radical can be oxidized by known processes, using a suitable oxidizing agent, such as m-chloroperbenzoic acid, hydrogen peroxide, benzoyl peroxide, etc., to give the corresponding C1-C4-alkylsulfinyl or C1-C4-alkylsulfonyl compound, see scheme 7.<br><br><br>
The preparation of the compounds in which R4 is an amino- or amido-substituted heterocyclic radical, in particular a pyridyl radical, is carried out according to scheme 8, where the preparation is illustrated using 2-substituted 4-pyridine compounds as examples (compounds in which R4  is an alkyl-substituted heterocyclic radical are prepared by the processes mentioned above using appropriately substituted starting materials):<br><br>
Scheme 8:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The amino group of the starting material 2-amino-y-picolin (24) is protected, for example by introduction of an acetyl group using acetic anhydride. The methyl group of the compound (25) is then oxidized to the carboxyl group using, for example, potassium permanganate in an aqueous medium at from 20 to 90°C.<br>
The reaction of the resulting pyridinecarboxylic acid (26) with 4-fluorophenyl-acetonithle to give compound (27) and the subsequent removal of the nitrile group are carried out in accordance with variant 1. This also results in the removal of the acetyl group on the amino group of the pyridine compound, with the compound (28) being formed.<br>
In the next step, the amino group is again protected, for example by introducing an acetyl group using acetic anhydride. The resulting compound (29) is. in accordance with variant 1 or 2 (shown in scheme 8 using variant 1), converted into the thiono compound (32). Into this compound, the desired radical R2 is introduced as described in schemes 3. 4 and 7.<br>
To introduce the desired substituent into the pyridyl group, the acetyl group is initially removed hydrolytically, for example using aqueous acid, giving the amino compound (35). An acyl radical is introduced by acylation, in particular with the corresponding acid chloride R5COCI in an inert solvent, such as an ether, for example tetrahydrofuran or dioxane. or in a chlorinated hydrocarbon, for example methylene chloride or 1,2-dichloroethan, etc. The acylation is generally carried out in the presence of a base, for example triethylamine, in an at least equimolar amount.<br>
To prepare the substituted amine compounds, compound (35) is reacted with one or two molar equivalents of an alkyl bromide or phenylalkyi bromide in an inert solvent, such as dimethylformamide, in the presence of a base, such as sodium hydride, to give the compounds (37) or (38). Alternatively, the amide compounds (34) or (36) can be reduced with lithium aluminum hydride, for example in tetrahydrofuran, to give compound 39.<br>
In vitro and in vivo, the compounds according to the invention show immunomodulating and cytokine-release inhibiting action. Cytokines are proteins such as TNF-a and IL-p which play an important role in numerous inflammatory disorders. The compounds according to the invention are, owing to their cytokine-reiease-inhibiting action, suitable for treating disorders which are associated with a disturbance of the immune system. They are suitable, for example, for treating<br><br>
autoimmune disorders, cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, septic shock, osteoporosis, neuropathic; pain, the spread of HIV, HIV dementia, viral myocarditis, insulin-dependent diabetes, periodontal disorders, restenosis, alopecia. T-cell depletion associated with HIV infections or AIDS, psoriasis, acute pancreatitis, rejection reactions of allogenic transplants, allergic pneumonia, arteriosclerosis, multiple sclerosis, cachexia, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, ictus, colitis ulcerosa, morbus Crohn, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), ischemia, congestive heart failure, pulmonary fibrosis, hepatitis, glioblastoma, Guillain-Barre syndrome, systemic lupus erythematodes. adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory distress syndrome.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can be administered either as individual therapeutically active compounds or as mixtures with other therapeutically active compounds. The compounds can be administered on their own; in general, however, they are formulated and administered in the form of pharmaceutical compositions, i.e. as mixtures of the active compounds with suitable pharmaceutical carriers or diluents. The compounds or compositions can be administered orally or parenterally; preferably, they are administered in oral dosage forms.<br>
The type of pharmaceutical composition or carrier or diluent depends on the desired administration form. Oral compositions, for example, can be present as tablets or capsules and may comprise customary excipients, such as binders (for example syrup, gum arable, gelatin, sorbitol, tragacanth or polyvinylpyrrolidone), fillers (for example lactose, sugar, cornstarch, calcium phosphate, sorbitol or glycerol), glidants (for example magnesium stearate. talc, polyethylene glycol or silica), disintegrants (for example starch) or wetting agents (for example sodium lauryl sulfate). Liquid oral preparations can assume the form of aqueous or oily suspensions, solutions, emulsions, syrups, elixirs or sprays and the like. They can also be present as a dry powder which is reconstituted using water or another suitable carrier. Such liquid preparations may comprise customary additives, for example suspending agents, flavors, diluents or emulsifiers. For parenteral administration, it is possible to use solutions or suspensions with customary pharmaceutical carriers.<br>
The compounds or compositions according to the invention can be administered to mammals (man or animal) in a dose of from about 0.5 mg to 100 mg per kg of body weight per day. They may be administered in one individual dose or in a plurality of doses. The activity spectmm of the compounds as inhibitors of cytokine release was examined using the test systems below, as described by C. Donat and S. Laufer in Arch. Pharm. Pharm. Med. Chem. 333.

The test substance is added to samples of human potassium-EDTA whole blood (of 400 |jl each) and the samples are preincubated in a CO2 incubator (5% CO2; 95% moisture-saturated air) at 37 for 15 min. The samples are then stimulated with 1 pg/ml of LPS {E.coli 026:B6) at 37°C in a CO2 incubator (5% CO2; 95% moisture-saturated air) for 4 hours. The reaction is stopped by placing the samples on ice, adding DPBS buffer and then centrifuging at 1 000*g for 15 min. The amount of IL-β and TNFa in the plasma supernatant is then determined by ELISA.<br>
In vitro test with PBMCs<br>
The mononuclear ceils (PBMCs) from human potassium-EDTA whole blood, diluted 1:3. are isolated by density gradient centrifugation (Histopaque®-1.077). The cells are washed twice with DPBS buffer, resuspended in macrophage SFM medium and adjusted to a cell count of 1*10^ cells/ml.<br>
The resulting PBMCs suspension (samples of in each case 390 pi) and the test substance are preincubated at 37°C in a CO2 incubator (5% CO2; 95% moisture-saturated air) for 15 min. The samples are then stimulated with in each case 1 pl/ml of LPS {E.coli 026:B6) at 37°C in a CO2 incubator (5% CO2; 95% moisture-saturated air) for 4 hours. The reaction is stopped by placing the samples on ice, adding DPBS buffer and then centrifuging at 15 880*g for 12 min. The amount of IL-lβ and TNFa in the plasma supernatant is then determined by ELISA.<br>
