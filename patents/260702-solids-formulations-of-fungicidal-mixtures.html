				<td>Solids formulation of fungicidal mixtures<br>
The invention relates to solids formulations (in particular water-dispersible granules) of mixtures of trifloxystrobin (TFS) with tebuconazole or tolylfluanid (Euparen M), to a process for their preparation, and to their use for applying the active substances which they contain.<br>
EP-A-0831698 discloses mixtures of TFS with tebuconazole, but only teaches WG formulations with an active substance content of 15% by weight. The preparation of mixtures with higher concentrations is only disclosed in the form of powders or as a suspension concentrate.<br>
The preparation of highly concentrated WG formulations with the formulation auxiliaries mentioned in the prior art gives formulations which have undesirable properties. Thus, the low melting point of the active substance mixture results in the formation of large amounts of wet-screening residues which, when the spray mixture is later applied, lead to plugging of the nozzles. Surprisingly, it has now been found that the present, highly concentrated formulations have particularly advantageous properties. Thus, their preparation only generates very small amounts of wet-screening residues, they can be extruded readily and they have particularly high suspension stability.<br>
The present invention accordingly provides compositions containing:<br>
•	trifloxystrobin (component I)<br>
•	at least one further active substance selected from tebuconazole and tolylfluanid (component II)<br>
•	at least one dispersant selected from the group consisting of Baykanol ® SL, Reax ® 907 and<br>
Reax ® 88B<br>
In the compositions according to the invention, components I and II are present in weight ratios of from 1 : 30 to 12 : 1, preferably 1 : 20 to 5 : 1, especially preferably 1 : 15 to 1 : 1. If the composition according to the invention contains tebuconazole and tolylfluanid, these substances together are considered as component II.<br>
Components I and II together are hereinbelow referred to as active substance. A preferred embodiment of the invention are compositions containing<br>
•	50 - 75%, preferably 60 - 75%, especially preferably 65 - 75% active substance<br>
•	5 - 20%, preferably 10 - 20%, especially preferably 10 - 15% at least one dispersant selected<br>
from the group consisting of Baykanol ® SL, Reax ® 907 and Reax ® 88B<br><br>
Unless otherwise specified, percentages are understood as being per cent by weight.<br>
An embodiment of the invention which must be emphasized are those compositions in which Baykanol ® SL is employed as the dispersant.<br>
A further embodiment of the invention which must be emphasized are those compositions in which Baykanol ® SL is employed as the dispersant and tebuconazole as component II.<br>
A further embodiment of the invention which must be emphasized are those compositions in which Baykanol ® SL is employed as the dispersant and tolylfluanid as component II.<br>
It has also been found that the compositions according to the invention can be prepared by moistening a pulverulent mixture consisting of the active substances and the formulation auxiliaries, subsequently granulating it by means of low-pressure extrusion and then drying the moist granules. The relevant apparatuses for moistening, extrusion and drying are known to the skilled worker. During the preparation, care must be taken in particular that the temperatures to which the product is exposed are kept at lower than 60°C, and preferably lower than 50°C, in all process steps.<br>
This process is also subject matter of the invention.<br>
Finally, it has been found that the compositions according to the invention are highly suitable for the application of the agrochemical active substances present on plants and/or their environment. This method is also subject matter of the invention.<br>
If appropriate, the compositions according to the invention contain further formulation auxiliaries, for example if appropriate substances from the groups of the emulsifiers, the anionic or nonionic surfactants, the antifoam agents, the preservatives, the antioxidants, the colorants and/or the inert fillers.<br>

The examples which follow illustrate the subject matter of the invention without limiting it.<br>
mples<br>
hi an experimental series, samples of the following general composition:<br>
25% by weight trifloxystrobin 50% by weight tebuconazole 15% by weight dispersant 10% by weight kaolin<br>
were extruded using a Fuji Paudal laboratory extruder type DG-1 and then subjected to comparative examinations.<br>
Preparation:<br>
In the first step of the preparation, a pulverulent mixture of the above composition is prepared by mixing the starting components and subsequently subjecting the mixture to air-jet grinding using an 8 inch air-jet mill. Thereafter, the powder is moistened in a Braun kitchen blender by portionwise addition of water and vigorous mixing until the powder is homogeneously moist. The amount of water whose addition allowed the best-possible extrusion in each case had been determined for each powder mixture in preliminary experiments. Depending on the dispersant used, the added water amounted to between 13 and 24% by weight, based on the amount of powder. The moistened powder is subsequently extruded by means of the laboratory extruder, and the moist granules are dried in a fluidized-bed dryer at an inlet air temperature of 60°C and a waste air temperature of approximately 35°C, the product temperature not exceeding 40°C. The drying time varies between 2 and 12 minutes. The residual water content of the samples is between 0.3 and 1.7% and is determined via the weight loss at 70°C using a Mettler infrared dryer moisture analyzer type LP 16.<br><br>
Test:<br>
Wet screening: The residues were tested on a screen with a mesh size of 150 urn. The wet-screening residues are of particular importance in the preparation of WG formulations by extrusion of low-melting active substances because the extrusion process can, as the result of compaction and temperature stress, give rise to product fractions which upon the intended use in water do not redisperse into the primary particles and lead to plugging of the filters in apparatuses used in agricultural practice. As a result, spraying may have to be interrupted and the filters subjected to laborious cleaning. The wet-screening test is a laboratory test for assessing the nondispersing fractions in the formulation, hi this test, the screen residue should preferably be less than 0.05% and especially preferably less than 0.02%.<br>
A 2-litre glass beaker equipped with stirrer is charged with 1000 ml of tap water, and 50 g of the WG formulation are introduced while stirring at 500 revolutions per minute. The mixture is stirred for 150 seconds and the suspension is then poured onto a screen with a mesh size of 150 urn, the residues in the glass beaker are rinsed off with a small amount of tap water and the mixture is washed with a jet of water (rubber hose with an internal diameter of approx. 10 mm; flow rate of the tap water: approx. 4-5 1/min). During this process, the fines are rinsed through the screen. After the screen has been rinsed for several (not more than ten) minutes, it is left to drip, and, using demineralized water, the residue is transferred from the screen into a previously weighed evaporating pan and dried at 70°C to constant weight. After cooling, the residue is weighed and the percentage of the residue based on the 50 g of formulation which have been employed is determined.<br>
Assessment of the extrudability: The assessment of the extrudability of a mixture is based on the observations made during preparation of the sample. Factors which are taken into consideration are, for example, flowability of the moistened powder, formation of the extrudate, disintegration of the extrudate, heating and the like. Promising scale-up requires an assessment of "good" or at least "satisfactory". "Moderate" means insufficient granulation, and "poor" means that the mixture cannot be extruded with a laboratory extruder.<br>
Suspension stability: The suspension stability is a measure for the suspendability of the insoluble constituents of the formulation in the spray mixture. Good suspension stability ensures a homogeneous distribution of the product and thus the uniform dosage when the product is applied. The suspension stability should generally amount to &gt;/= 75%. A 1% strength suspension of the formulation is prepared in a 250-ml graduated cylinder by placing the calculated amount of granules into water, leaving the mixture to stand for 4 minutes and, after sealing the graduated cylinder with a rubber stopper, inverting the former 30 times by 180° within 1 minute. The rubber<br><br>
stopper is removed, and the suspension is left to stand quietly at room temperature for precisely 30 minutes. Then, the upper 9/10 of the suspension are pipetted off and the bottom tenth is transferred into a weighed evaporating pan using distilled water. The content of the pan is dried at 70°C to constant weight, which is how the sediment is determined. The amount of suspension (suspension stability) is calculated using the formula:<br>
Amount of suspension = (100 - sediment) x 1.11<br>
Unless otherwise specified, percentages in the following tables are taken to mean per cent by weight.<br>
Table 1;<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The results of an experimental series in which different dispersants are used are compiled in Table 1. The samples differ greatly regarding the wet-screening residues and the assessment of the extrudability. Only Examples 1,10 and 11 meet the requirement of preferably less than 0.05% wet-screening residues. Only Examples 1 and 11 additionally have "good" extrudability. Only Example 1 has the especially preferred wet-screening residues of less than 0.02% while simultaneously exhibiting "good" extrudability.<br>
Table 2:<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Table 3:<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Table 2 compiles various formulations of trifloxystrobin in mixture with tolylfluanid. The preparation was accomplished as described further above, using a Fuji Paudal laboratory extruder type DG-1. Table 3 gives the test results of the exemplary formulations with regard to suspension stability and wet-screening residues. The tests were performed using the methods described further above. "Preparation" means that the test was performed shortly after the preparation (as a rule after not more than five days and storage at ambient temperature) of the sample, while "2W/54°C" and "4W/40°C" means that the samples were stored for 2 weeks at 54°C or for 4 weeks at 40°C and then tested. The test results after storage over a relatively short period at higher temperatures permit an estimate of the stability of the formulation after storage at conventional ambient temperature over a prolonged period.<br>
In compositions containing a combination of trifloxystrobin and tolylfluanid, not only the screen residues after wet screening, but also the suspension stability present a problem. The results show that only those samples which have been prepared using the dispersants Baykanol® SL and Reax 907 (Examples 17-20) exhibit satisfactory suspension stability and wet-screening residues, especially after storage at elevated temperatures. Baykanol® SL is particularly preferable.<br>
