characteristic points information signals; and<br>
i -   processing means for processing the sequence of video data signals into video data<br>

10	In addition, the invention relates to a method of generating a sequence of<br>
; information signals concerning characteristic points in a sequence of video data signals<br>
: comprising pictures of an intra-picture type coded without reference to other pictures and<br>
i pictures of an inter-picture type coded with reference to other pictures, in which for a<br>
characteristic point a block of information is generated, the block of information comprising:<br>
IS	-   position data defining a position of the characteristic point in the sequence of<br>
video data signals; and size data providing information related to a size of an I-picture selected from the pictures of j the intra-picture type.<br>
' Furthermore, the present invention relates to a record carrier provided with the sequence of 20     video data signals and the sequence ofcharacteristic points information signals.<br>
The CPI (Characteristic Point Information) table maps the time axis (the moment a certain picture or scene is shown in the program) on the location (byte number) in 25     the file, which contains the bytes from the program. This is especially important if the bit rate is not known or not constant. The characteristic points make it possible to have random access, based on presentation time, in the recorded program. Figure 1 shows schematically location of characteristic points (CP) in the file. The axis P r^resents position in the file. In figure 2 a schematic view is given of the layered structure of a storage 30 ; device.<br>
: Files created in ttie AV-Application (APP) are sent to the File System layer (FS). Here a i mqjping of the bytes fi-om the files on the logical address space which is delivered by the Bit Engine (BE) is made. This mapping is stored in the FS database.<br><br>
3 In the Bit Engine the mapping of the logical address space on the physical address space is carried out. The files, which are created in the AV-application, are: the real-itime jBles, which contain the content of the AV program and an AV database. The AV j database contains the navigation data for access to the real-time files. The CPI table is part of 5    I the navigation data and it is stored in the AV data base file.<br>
Characteristic points m case of an MPEG2 coded AV signal, on tiie time axis jare:<br>
* -the start of a so-called I-picture(intra-picture), i -thestartofaP-picture, 10    ; - the start of an Audio access unit (in case of an Audio only signal).<br>
During operation the CPI table of the program, which is presented, is stored in 15    i (DRAM) memory of the Application layer. That is why the size of the CPI table should be I limited. CPI tables can be very large, as is explained in next example.<br>
The address &amp;om the position in the file is represented by the source packet number in that file. With an MPEG2 Transport Stream, each source packet consists of the j Transport Stream packet of 188 bytes and a Time stamp of 4 bytes. With a capacity of 25 20   : Gbytes we need 28 bits to represent this address of a characteristic point in file program. The accuracy on the time access should be less than the duration of access i units. With an accuracy of 5 msec and a total playing time of 24 hours we need 25 bits to j represent the timing information.<br>
The CPI table from a stored program might contain a lot of entries. The 25     duration of a Group-Of-Pictures (GOP) is less than half a second. Each GOP starts with an I-picture. If an entry in the CPI table is made for all I-pictures, tiien there are for every hour playing time at least 7200 entries. The playing time of a large capacity disc could be very large (e.g. 12 hours), which results in about 100.000 entries.<br>
With 4 bytes for the address and another 4 bytes for the presentation time we 30     end up at a size of 800 Kbytes.<br>
The CPI table is also used for trick play like fast forward and reverse. In trick play not all pictures can be presented. Very often only the I-pictures (T), or some of the I-pictures, are presented as shown in figure 3. So not all source packets have to be read but<br><br>
4 I only those which are used for presentation. The size of the I-picture is not fixed, size could be !tens or hundreds of Kbytes.<br>
Readmg of redundant information costs time, in that tune another I-picture I could have been read. This improves the trick play performance because more pictures per 5    j second could have been presented.<br>
In some other systems this is solved by having for each entry in the CPI table i not only the presentation time and the address in the file but also the size of the I-picture or ' the address of the source packet, which contains the last byte fixim the I-picture. The size of ; the I-picture is measured in source packets with a size of 192 bytes. The size of an Ipicture 10 could be several hundreds of Kbytes. More than 10 bits are needed to indicate the size of the I-picture. This would result in another 2 bytes for the entry in the table. The size of the table is increased and it is not 4 byte aligned anymore.<br>
15	hi the drive only units ofECC blocks (B) can be read. Ifonly a few bytes are<br>
J needed jfrom a certain ECC block then still the whole ECC bbck has to be read.<br>
It is of no use to indicate very accurately the size of the I-picture. This, is ; schematically shown in figure 4. It is enough if it is known that only two ECC blocks have to be read instead of 5 ECC blocks. In the following paragr^h some numbers are given which 20    j might occur in practice.<br>
Bit rate of tiie MPEG Transport Stream is 8 Mbps (1 Mbytes per second).<br>
One GOP is 0.5 second, so the average size of the GOP is 0.5 Mbytes.<br>
The size of an ECC block is 64 Kbytes, so one GOP is in average 8 ECC<br>
blocks.<br>
25	The maximum size of an I-picture is taken equal to the decoding buflGa: (-225<br>
Kbytes, ~4 ECC blocks).<br>
The average size of the I-picture is much less, it might be in the order of 100 Kbytes (
If it is indicated that the size of the I-picture is 
The aim of this proposal is to have an indication for the size of the I-picture. So not more ECC blocks are read than is needed. But also to keep the number of bits for the i size of the I-pictuie as low as possible.  For this purpose we can use following property.<br><br>
If the video type mdicates that it is an entry for a P-picture, then the size is not ! important. P-pictures for trick play are only important at low speeds. Here either the egd of ; the picture can be found while reading and as soon as the end is found a jump is made to the j start of the next picture, or the whole stream is read.<br>
5   \	These considCTations have led to the structure of one entry in the C3&gt;I table<br>
j shown in figure 5. Presentation time stamp (PTS) specifies a tune during presentation of the sequence of video data when a particular picture is to be presaited and a source packet ; number (SPN) specifies an address in the sequence of video data where the characteristic point is located. TYP contains information related to a type of the entry and a size of the I-10     picture. In this example the entry in the CPI table has a size of 4 bytes: 4-bits for TYP, 11-! bits for PTS and 17-bits for SPN.<br>
In the 4 bits firom TYP, the type of the video entry is presented together with ; the size of the I-picture. The type of the entry is given by bits I b0..b3:<br>
15   i Ixxx	I-picture with sequence headCT, XXX represents the size of the picture.<br>
■ Oyyy	I-picture without sequence header, yyy represents the size of the I-^icture.<br>
i At least one of the bits in yyy is '1'<br>
j 0000	P^icture<br>
Examples of values for xxx and yyy are given in Table 1, where k is the 20   \ scaling factor.<br><br>
xxx	yyy	Size of I-picture<br>
000	000	not relevant<br>
001	001	<k></k>
010	010	k*sl.. k*s2<br>
on	on	k*s2.. k*s3<br>

101	101	k*s4.. k*s5<br>
110	no	k*s5.. k*s6<br>
111	111	&gt;k*s6<br>
As an example:<br>
For standard definition TV (SD-TV): k=l<br><br>
6<br>
For high definition TV (HD-TV): k=2<br>
and	sl= 64 kB<br>
s2= 128 kB s3=192kB s4=256kB s5=320kB s6=384kB<br>
10 I	In another example k=l and: sl=128 kB, s2=256 kB, s3=384 kB, s4=576 kfi,<br>
i   s5=896kB,s6=1280kB.<br>
In yet another example TYP can have length of 3-bits with only 1 -bit carrying i  information related to the I-picture size. Its value can be binary' 1' for I-pictures with size t  smaller than 128 kB and binary '0' for cases when the size is not specified.<br>

Fig. 6 shows an embodiment of the apparatus for recording a sequence of video data signals, in accordance with the invention. The apparatus comprises an input I terminal 1 for receiving video data signals and a video data signals processing unit 100. The : signals processing unit 100 receives the video data signals via the input tenninal 1 and 30 i processes the video data signals into a sequence of video data signals for recording the sequence of video data signals on a record carrier 3. Further, a read/write unit 102 is available. The read/write unit 102 comprises a read/write head 104, which is in the present example an optical read/write head for reading/writmg the sequence of video data signals and a corresponding CPI fix)m/on the record carrier 3. Further, positioning means 106 are present<br><br>
10 i<br>
15  I<br><br>
for positioning the head 104 in a radial direction across the record carrier 3. A read/write amplifier 108 is present in order to amplify the signal to be recorded and amplifying the signal read from the record carrier 3. A motor 110 is available for rotating the record carrier 3 in response to a motor control signal suppUed by a motor control signal generator unit 112. A microprocessor 114 is present for controlling all the circuits via control lines 116,118 and 120.<br>
The signals processing unit 100 is further ad^ted to generate the corresponding CPI for the sequence of video data signals. To that purpose, the signals processing unit 100 is, as an example, capable of identifying position and size of an I-picture in the sequence of video data signals. Further, the signals processing unit 100 is capable of generating a block of information for a characteristic point corresponding to this I-picture, consisting of TYP, PTS and SPN as defined in above examples.<br>
The CPI can be temporarily stored in a memory 132, until liie processing of the video data signals into the sequence of video data signals an4 eventually, the subsequent recording on the record carrier 3, has been completed. Next, the CPI stored in the memory 132 can be recorded on the record carrier 3.<br><br><br><br><br>
