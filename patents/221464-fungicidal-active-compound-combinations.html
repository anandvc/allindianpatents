				<td>active compound combinations<br>
The present invention relates to novel active compound combinations which consist of the known N-[l-(4-chIoro-phenyl)-ethyI]-2,2-dichloro-l-ethyl-3-methyl-cyclopropanecarboxamide, on the one hand, and other known fungicidal active compounds on the other hand, and which are very well suited for controlling phytopathogenic fungi.<br>
It has already been disclosed that N-[l-(4-chloro-phenyl)-ethyl]-2,2-dichloro-l-ethyl-3-methyl-cyclopropanecarboxamide possesses fungicidal properties (cf. EP-A 0 341 475). While the activity of this compound is good, it leaves something to be desired in a number of cases when low application rates are used.<br>
Il has furthermore been disclosed that a large number of triazole, imidazole and pyrrole derivatives can be employed for controlling fungi (cf. DE-A 2 201 063, EP-A 0 206 999, EP-A 0 236 272 and US-A 3 991 071). However, the effect of these compounds is not always satisfactory, either, when low application rates are used.<br>
ll has now been found that the novel active compound combinations consisting of<br>

Surprisingly, the fungicidal effect of the active compound combinations according to the invention is substantially greater than the sum of the effects of the individual active compounds. It is, therefore, a matter of an unforeseeable, genuine synergistic effect and not simply of an addition to the effect.<br>
It is apparent from the structural formula for the active compound of the formula (I) that the compound exhibits three asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms.. The product can, therefore, be present as a mixture of different isomers or else in the form of a single component. The compounds<br>
N-(R)-[l-(4-chloro-phenyl)-ethyl]-(lS)-2,2-dichIoro-l-ethyl-3t-methyI-lr-cyclo-propanecarboxamide of the formula<br>
(Figure Remove) <br>

are particularK preferred   The compound of the formula (I) and its individual isomers aie known (cf RP-A 0 341 475)<br>
The fomiula (II) includes the compounds I -( T-diloi op iriioxv )-!  i-dmu'tlivl-1 -( I 2,-l-ti ia/n -1 -vl )-butan-2-o   of the formula<br><br><br>

The  triazole  derivatives  of the  formula  (II)  are  likewise  known  (cf. DE-A 2 201 063),<br>
The formula (III) includes the compounds 4-(2,3-dichloro-phenyl)-1 H-pyrrole-3-carbonitrile of the formula<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
and<br>
4-(2,2-difluoro-l ,3»benzodioxol-4-yl)-l M-pyrrole-3-carbonitrile of the formula<br><br><br>
(Figure Remove)<br><br>
The pyrrole derivatives of the formula (III) are likewise known (cf. EP-A 0 206 999 and EP-A 0 236 272).<br>
The imidazole derivative of the formula (IV) is N-[2-(2,4,6-trichlorophenoxy)-cthyll-N-propyl-lH-imidazole-1-carboxamide, which is known under the name of prochloraz (cf. US-A 3 991 071).<br>
In addition to the active compound of the formula (I), the active compound combinations according to the invention contain at least one active compound from the compounds of groups (A) to (C). Over and above this, they may also contain additional, admixed, fungicidally active components.<br>
The synergistic effect is exhibited particularly clearly when the active compounds are present in particular weight ratios in the active compound combinations according to the invention. However, the weight ratios of the active compounds in the active compound combinations may be varied over a relatively wide range. In general, from 0.1 to 10 parts by weight, preferably from 0.2 to 5 parts by weight, of active compounds from groups (A) to (C) are allotted to 1 part by weight of active compound of the formula (I).<br>
The active compound combinations according to the invention possess very good fungicidal properties and can be employed for controlling phytopathogenic fungi such as Plasmodiophoromycetes, Oomycetes, Chytridiomycetes, Zygomycetes, Ascomvcctcs, Bnsidiomvcelcs, Deuteromycetes, etc.<br>
Die active compound combinations according to the invention are particularly well -anted tot controlliim I'vricularia, Pellicularia, f'ochliobolus, Gibberella. Rhi/.oc-tonia and hisariiim spp<br>
The active compound combinations according to the invention may, in particular, be used for controlling fungi on rice and cereals, such as wheat and barley.<br>
The good toleration by plants of the active compound combinations, at the concentrations required for controlling plant diseases, permits treatment of above-ground parts of plants, of vegetative propagation stock and seeds, and of the soil. The active compound combinations according to the invention may be employed for application to leaves or as dressing agents.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention can be converted into the customary formulations, such as solutions, emulsions, suspensions, powders, foams, pastes, granules, aerosols, very fine capsules in polymeric substances and in coaling compositions for seed, as well as ULV formulations.<br>
These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the active compounds or the active compound combinations with extenders, that is, liquid solvents, liquefied gases under pressure, and/or solid carriers, optionally with the use of surface-active agents, that is, emulsifying agents and/or dispersing agents, and/or foam-forming agents. In the case of the use of water as an extender, organic solvents can, for example, also be used as auxiliary solvents. As liquid solvents, there are suitable in the main: aromatics, such as xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes,  chlorinated  aromatics  or chlorinated  aliphatic  hydrocarbons, such as chlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes or methylene chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for example mineral oil fractions, alcohols, such as butanol or glycol as well as their ethers and esters, ketones, such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents, such as dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulphoxide, as well as water.  By  liquefied gaseous extenders or carriers are meant liquids which  are gaseous   at   normal   temperature  and   under  atmospheric   pressure,   for  example aerosol propellants, such as butane, propane, nitrogen and carbon dioxide. As solid earners there are suitable: for example ground natural minerals, such as kaolins, c ays, laic, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or cliatomaceous earth, and giound synthetic minerals, such as highly-disperse silica, alumina and silicates. As solid carriers tor granules there are suitable: for example crushed and Iractionated natural   rocks  Mich  as calcite,  marble,  pumice, sepiolite and  dolomite, as well  as sviithetic   manules   of   inoruanic   and   oruamc   meals,   and   uranulcs   of   organic<br>
material such as sawdust, coconut shells, maize cobs and tobacco stalks. As emulsifying and/or foam-forming agents there are suitable: for example non-ionic and anionic emulsifiers, such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, for example alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, alkylsulphonates, alkyl sulphates, arylsulphonates as well as albumen hydrolysis products. As dispersing agents there are suitable: for example lignin-sulphite waste liquors and methylcellulose.<br>
Adhesives such as carboxymethylcellulose and natural and synthetic polymers in the form of powders, granules or latices, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl  acetate, as well as natural phospholipids, such as cephalins and Uvilliins, and  synthetic phospholipids,  can be used in the formulations.  Other . additives can be mineral and vegetable oils.<br>
It is possible to use colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide, titanium oxide and Prussian Blue, and organic dyestuffs, such as alizarin dyestuffs, azo dyestuffs and metal phthalocyanine dyestuffs, and trace nutrients such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum and zinc.<br>
The formulations in general contain between 0.1 and 95 per cent by weight of active compound, preferably between 0.5 and 90%.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention can be present in the formulations as a mixture with other known active compounds, such as fungicides, insecticides, acancides and herbicides, as well as in mixtures with fertilizers and plant, growth regulators.<br>
The active compound combinations can be used as such or in the form of their formulations or the use forms prepared therefrom, such as ready-to-use solutions, emulsifiable concentrates, emulsions, suspensions, wcttable powders, soluble powders and granules. They arc used in the customary manner, for example by watering, sprayinu, atomi/ing, scattering, spreading, dry seed dressing, wet dressing, liquid dressing, slurry treatment of seeds or encrustation.<br>
In the treatment of parts of plants, the active compound concentrations in the use forms can be varied within a substantial range. They are, in general, between 1 and 0.0001% by weight, preferably between 0.5 and 0.001%.<br>
In the treatment of seed, amounts of active compound of 0.001 to 50 g per kilogram of seed, preferably 0.01 to 10 g, are generally required.<br>
For the treatment of soil, active compound concentrations of 0.00001 to 0.1% by weight, preferably 0.0001 to 0.02% by weight, are required at the place of action.<br>
The fact that the active compound combinations according to the invention have a good fungicidai. effect is evident from the examples which follow. Whereas the individual active compounds exhibit weaknesses in their fungicidai effect, the combinations have an effect which goes beyond a simple summation of effects.<br>
In fungicides, a synergistic effect is always present when the fungicidai effect of the active compound combinations is greater than the sum of the effects of the individually applied active compounds.<br>
