				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD	<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to an interlayer film<br>
for a laminate glass which is excellent in transparency,<br>
heat-shielding property, and electromagnetic wave<br>
transmittance in the case of use for a laminate glass and<br>
is not deteriorated in the initial optical properties even<br>
after a light stability test and a laminate glass obtained<br>
by using the interlayer film for a laminate glass.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
Since a laminate glass is scarcely scattered in<br>
debris even if being broken by receiving outside impact and<br>
is thus safe, the laminate glass has been used widely for a<br>
window glass of vehicles such as automobiles; aircrafts;<br>
buildings and the like. Examples of such a laminate glass<br>
are those which are obtained by inserting an interlayer<br>
film for a laminate glass comprising polyvinyl acetal resin<br>
such as polyvinyl butyral resin plasticized by a<br>
plasticizer between at least one pair of glasses and<br>
uniting such a film with glasses.<br>
[0003]<br>
Although the laminate glass using such an interlayer<br>
film for a laminate glass is excellent in safety, it has a<br>
disadvantageous point that it is inferior in heat-shielding<br>
property. Generally, infrared ray (IR) with wavelength at<br>
shortest 780 nm, which is longer than that of visible light,<br>
among the light rays, has energy dose as low as about 10%<br>
of that of ultraviolet (UV) ray but has a significant<br><br><br>
thermal effect and if once absorbed in a substance, IR is<br>
released in form of heat to result in temperature increase<br>
and therefore, it is called as thermal beam. Accordingly,<br>
among light rays coming in through a front glass or side<br>
glass of an automobile, if IR having significant thermal<br>
effect is shielded, the heat-shielding effect is increased<br>
and the temperature increase in the inside of the<br>
automobile can be suppressed.<br>
[0004]<br>
As such a glass which shields IR having significant<br>
thermal effect, for example, a heat ray-cutting glass has<br>
been commercialized. The heat ray-cutting glass is<br>
developed aiming to shield direct sun lights and obtained<br>
by forming a multilayer coating of metal/metal oxide on the<br>
surface of a glass plate by metal evaporation, sputtering<br>
or the like. However, such a multilayer coating is<br>
susceptive of scratching from the outside and inferior in<br>
chemical resistance, so that a method of obtaining the<br>
laminate glass laminating an interlayer film of a<br>
plasticized polyvinyl butyral resin film or the like has<br>
been employed.<br>
[0005]<br>
However, the heat ray-cutting glass has problems that<br>
the glass is expensive, deteriorated in the transparency<br>
(visible light transmittance) because of thick thickness of<br>
the multilayer coating, and highly colorized because of<br>
absorption in a visible light region. Further, there are<br>
other problems that the adhesion between the multilayer<br>
coating and the interlayer film is decreased to cause<br>
separation and whitening of the interlayer film and that<br>
the multilayer coating layer inhibits transmittance of<br>
electromagnetic wave and interferes with communication<br>
functions of a mobile phone, a car navigation system, a<br>
garage opener, an electronic toll collection system, and<br>
the like.<br><br><br>
[0006]<br>
For example, Patent Document No. 1 and Patent<br>
Document No. 2 proposes a laminate glass obtained by<br>
inserting a polyester film on which a thin film of a metal<br>
and/or metal oxide is formed or evaporated between<br>
plasticized polyvinyl butyral resin sheets. However, these<br>
laminate glasses have a problem in the adhesion between the<br>
plasticized polyvinyl butyral resin sheets and the<br>
polyester film to result in not only separation in the<br>
interfaces but also insufficiency of electromagnetic wave<br>
transmittance.<br>
[0007]<br>
Further, Patent Document No. 3 discloses a method of<br>
obtaining electromagnetic wave transmittance by dispersing<br>
a metal oxide having heat-shielding property in the<br>
interlayer film. However the laminate glass comprising<br>
such an interlayer film for a laminate glass obtained by<br>
the described method has a problem that the laminate glass<br>
is discolored to be yellow to decrease the visible light<br>
transmittance after a durability test to light in some<br>
cases and thus it is expected that the laminate glass is<br>
scarcely allowed for use as an automotive front glass whose<br>
visible light transmittance is regulated in the lower limit.<br>

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROBLEMS WHICH THE INVENTION IS TO SOLVE<br>
[0009]<br>
In view of the above-mentioned state of the art, the<br><br><br>
present invention aims to provide an interlayer film for a<br>
laminate glass which is excellent in transparency, heat-<br>
shielding property, and electromagnetic wave transmittance<br>
in the case of use for a laminate glass and is not<br>
deteriorated in the visible light transmittance and the<br>
initial optical properties even after a durability test to<br>
light and provide a laminate glass comprising the<br>
interlayer film for a laminate glass.<br>
MEANS FOR SOLVING THE OBJECT<br>
[0010]<br>
The present invention is directed to an interlayer<br>
film for a laminate glass which comprises at least each one<br>
layer of a heat-shielding layer and an UV-shielding layer.<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be described<br>
in detail.<br>
[0011]<br>
An interlayer film for a laminate glass of the<br>
present invention comprises at least each one layer of a<br>
heat-shielding layer and an UV-shielding layer.<br>
On the basis of results of intensive investigations,<br>
inventors of the present invention have found that a cause<br>
of decrease of visible light transmittance of a laminate<br>
glass comprising an interlayer film containing a heat-<br>
shielding metal oxide dispersed therein after a durability<br>
test to light is attributed to the chemical change of the<br>
metal oxide itself by UV rays and the resin matrix affected<br>
by the chemical change.<br>
That is, it is supposed that when light directly<br>
comes in from outside, the heat-shielding layer of the<br>
interlayer film for a laminate glass of the present<br>
invention is discolored to cause decrease of the visible<br>
light transmittance owing to the light with a wavelength in<br>
UV region having a high energy.<br>
However, since the interlayer film for a laminate<br><br><br>
glass of the present invention comprises the above-<br>
mentioned UV-shielding layer having a function of shielding<br>
the UV rays, UV rays of the light coming in the above-<br>
mentioned heat-shielding layer from the UV-shielding layer<br>
side are considerably decreased and thus the discoloration<br>
of the above-mentioned heat-shielding layer by UV rays can<br>
be suppressed. Accordingly, the laminate glass obtained<br>
using the interlayer film for a laminate glass of the<br>
present invention is suppressed from decrease of the<br>
visible light transmittance after the durability test to<br>
light and is not deteriorated in the initial optical<br>
qualities.<br>
[0012]<br>
The interlayer film for a laminate glass of the<br>
present invention is preferable to comprise three layers<br>
composed of at least a heat-shielding layer and UV-<br>
shielding layers formed on both faces of the above-<br>
mentioned heat-shielding layer. With respect to the<br>
interlayer film for a laminate glass with such a structure,<br>
even if light comes in from both sides of the heat-<br>
shielding layer, the light comes in while being transmitted<br>
through the above-mentioned UV-shielding layers, UV rays<br>
are considerably decreased and thus discoloration of the<br>
above-mentioned heat-shielding layer to be yellow can be<br>
prevented. Accordingly, the visible light transmittance is<br>
not decreased even after the durability test to light and<br>
the initial optical qualities are not deteriorated in the<br>
case where the interlayer film for a laminate glass with<br>
the above-mentioned structure is used to obtain a laminate<br>
glass.<br>
[0013]<br>
With respect to the interlayer film for a laminate<br>
glass of the present invention, the above-mentioned heat-<br>
shielding layer is preferable to have an electromagnetic<br>
wave shield capability of 10 dB or lower at a frequency of<br><br><br>
0.1 MHz to 26.5 GHz in the case where the heat-shielding<br>
layer is inserted between two plates of glasses selected<br>
from a group consisting of clear glasses, green glasses,<br>
high heat ray absorption glasses, and UV absorption glasses<br>
to obtain a laminate glass. If it exceeds 10 dB, the<br>
electromagnetic wave transmittance of the laminate glass<br>
comprising the interlayer film for a laminate glass of the<br>
present invention may be decreased in some cases.<br>
[0014]<br>
The above-mentioned heat-shielding layer is<br>
preferable to have a haze of 1.0% or less in form of the<br>
above-mentioned laminate glass. If it exceeds 1.0%, the<br>
transparency of the laminate glass comprising the<br>
interlayer film for a laminate glass of the present<br>
invention may be so low as to cause adverse effects on<br>
practical use in some cases.<br>
[0015]<br>
The above-mentioned heat-shielding layer inserted in<br>
the above-mentioned laminate glass is preferable to have a<br>
visible light transmittance of 70% or higher. If it is<br>
lower than 70%, the transparency of the laminate glass<br>
comprising the interlayer film for laminate glass of the<br>
present invention may be so low as to cause adverse effects<br>
on practical use in some cases. The above-mentioned<br>
visible light transmittance may be measured, for example,<br>
by measuring visible light transmittance (Tv) of the<br>
laminate glass to the light rays with wavelength of 380 to<br>
780 nm according to [Testing method on transmittance,<br>
reflectance and emittance offlat glasses and evaluation of<br>
solar heat gain coefficient] of JIS R 3106 (1998) by a<br>
recording spectrophotometer (manufactured by Hitachi Ltd.,<br>
U 4000) .<br>
[0016]<br>
The above-mentioned heat-shielding layer inserted in<br>
the above-mentioned laminate glass is preferable to have a<br><br><br>
sun light transmittance 85% or lower of the above-mentioned<br>
visible light transmittance in a wavelength region of 300<br>
to 2100 nm. If it exceeds 85%, the heat-shielding property<br>
of the laminate glass comprising the interlayer film for a<br>
laminate glass of the present invention is sometimes<br>
insufficient. The above-mentioned sun light transmittance<br>
may be measured, for example, by measuring sun light<br>
transmittance (Ts) of the laminate glass to the light rays<br>
with wavelength of 300 to 2100 nm according to [Testing<br>
method on transmittance, reflectance and emittance offlat<br>
glasses and evaluation of solar heat gain coefficient] of<br>
JIS R 3106 (1998) by a recording spectrophotometer<br>
(manufactured by Hitachi Ltd., U 4000) .<br>
[0017]<br>
The above-mentioned heat-shielding layer is<br>
preferable to contain a transparent resin and a heat-<br>
shielding agent.<br>
The above-mentioned transparent resin is not<br>
particularly limited and, for example, resins known as<br>
transparent resins for interlayer films for a laminate<br>
glass can be exemplified. Practical examples of the resin<br>
are polyvinyl acetal resin; polyurethane resin; ethylene-<br>
vinyl acetate resin; acrylic copolymer resin comprising<br>
acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, or their derivatives as<br>
composing units; and vinyl chloride-ethylene-glycidyl<br>
methacrylate copolymer resin. These resins can be produced<br>
easily by known methods or so.<br>
[0018]<br>
As the above-mentioned transparent resin, polyvinyl<br>
acetal resin is preferable. The above-mentioned polyvinyl<br>
acetal resin is not particularly limited if it is obtained<br>
by acetalization of polyvinyl alcohol with an aldehyde. As<br>
the above-mentioned polyvinyl alcohol, a polyvinyl alcohol<br>
obtained by saponification of poly(vinyl acetate) and<br>
having a saponification degree of 80 to 99.8% by mole may<br><br><br>
generally be used.<br>
In the case where the above-mentioned polyacetal<br>
resin is used for the present invention, the molecular<br>
weight and molecular weight distribution are not<br>
particularly limited, however in terms of the formability<br>
and physical properties, the lower limit of the<br>
polymerization degree of the polyvinyl alcohol resin to be<br>
a raw material is preferably 200 and the upper limit is<br>
preferably 3,000. If it is lower than 200, the resistance<br>
to penetration of the laminate glass to be obtained tends<br>
to be decreased and if it exceeds 3,000, the formability of<br>
the resin film tends to be worsened and the toughness of<br>
the resin film tend to be too high, resulting in inferior<br>
processibility. The lower limit is more preferably 500 and<br>
the upper limit is more preferably 2,000.<br>
[0019]<br>
As the above-mentioned aldehyde, aldehydes with 1 to<br>
10 carbon atoms may be used and examples of such aldehydes<br>
are n-butylaldehyde, isobutylaldehyde, n-varelaldehyde, 2-<br>
ethylbutylaldehyde, n-hexylaldehyde, n-octylaldehyde, n-<br>
nonylaldehyde, n-decylaldehyde, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde,<br>
and benzaldehyde. Among them, n-butylaldehyde, n-<br>
hexylaldehyde, and n-varelaldehyde are preferable and<br>
butylaldehyde with 4 carbon atoms is particularly<br>
preferable.<br>
[0020]<br>
As the above-mentioned polyvinyl acetal, polyvinyl<br>
butyral obtained by acetalization with butylaldehyde is<br>
preferable. Further, these acetal resins may be properly<br>
combined and blended on consideration of the required<br>
physical properties. Further, co-polyvinyl acetal resin<br>
obtained by combining aldehyde at the time of acetalization<br>
may be used properly. The lower limit of the acetalization<br>
degree of the above-mentioned polyvinyl acetal resin to be<br>
used for the present invention is preferably 40% and the<br><br><br>
upper limit is 85%, and the lower limit is more preferably<br>
60% and the upper limit is more preferably 75%.<br>
[0021]<br>
The above-mentioned heat-shielding layer is<br>
preferable to contain a plasticizer.<br>
As the above-mentioned plasticizer, any plasticizer<br>
to be used commonly for the interlayer film for a laminate<br>
glass may be used without any particular limit and examples<br>
of the plasticizer are organic type plasticizers such as<br>
monobasic organic acid esters, polybasic organic acid<br>
esters; and organophosphoric acid type plasticizers such as<br>
organophosphoric acid type, organophosphorous acid type<br>
ones. These plasticizers may be used alone or two or more<br>
of them may be used in combination and on consideration of<br>
the compatibility with the above-mentioned transparent<br>
resin, these plasticizers are properly used depending on<br>
the types of the resin.<br>
[0022]<br>
The above-mentioned monobasic organic acid ester type<br>
plasticizers are not particularly limited and examples<br>
thereof may include glycol type esters obtained by reaction<br>
of glycols such as triethylene glycol, tetraethylene glycol,<br>
tripropylene glycol or the like and a monobasic organic<br>
acid such as butyric acid, isobutyric acid, caproic acid,<br>
2-ethylbutyric acid, heptylic acid, n-octylic acid, 2-<br>
ethylhexylic acid, pelargonic acid (n-nonylic acid), or<br>
decylic acid. Among them, triethylene glycol monobasic<br>
organic acid esters such as triethylene glycol dicaproic<br>
acid ester, triethylene glycol di-2-ethylbutyric acid ester,<br>
triethylene glycol di-n-octylic acid ester, and triethylene<br>
glycol di-2-ethylhexylic acid ester are preferable to be<br>
used.<br>
[0023]<br>
The above-mentioned polybasic organic ester type<br>
plasticizers are not particularly limited and examples<br><br><br>
thereof may include esters of polybasic organic acids such<br>
as adipic acid, sebacic acid, or azelaic acid and straight<br>
chain or branched alcohols with 4 to 8 carbon atoms. Among<br>
them, dibutyl sebacic acid ester, dioctyl azelaic acid<br>
ester, dibutylcarbitol adipic acid ester are preferable to<br>
be used.<br>
[0024]<br>
The above-mentioned organic phosphoric acid type<br>
plasticizers are not particularly limited and examples<br>
thereof may include tributoxyethyl phosphate,<br>
isodecylphenyl phosphate, triisopropyl phosphate and the<br>
like.<br>
[0025]<br>
Practical examples of the above-mentioned<br>
plasticizers are triethylene glycol diethylbutyrate,<br>
triethylene glycol diethylhexoate, triethylene glycol<br>
dibutylsebacate and the like.<br>
[0026]<br>
In the above-mentioned heat-shielding layer, the<br>
addition amount of the above-mentioned plasticizers is not<br>
particularly limited and for example, in the case where the<br>
above-mentioned transparent resin is polyvinyl acetal resin,<br>
the lower limit is preferably 20 parts by weight and the<br>
upper limit is preferably 100 parts by weight to 100 parts<br>
by weight of the polyvinyl acetal resin. If it is less<br>
than 20 parts by weight, the resistance to penetration is<br>
sometimes decreased and if it exceeds 100 parts by weight,<br>
bleeding out of the plasticizers probably occurs to lead to<br>
deterioration of the transparency and adhesion of the heat-<br>
shielding layer and significant optical distortion of the<br>
laminate glass to be obtained. The lower limit is more<br>
preferably 30 parts by weight and the upper limit is more<br>
preferably 60 parts by weight.<br>
[0027]<br>
The above-mentioned heat-shielding layer is<br><br><br>
preferable to contain an adhesion adjustment agent.<br>
The above-mentioned adhesion adjustment agent is not<br>
particularly limited and an alkali metal salt and/or an<br>
alkaline earth metal salt is preferable to be used. As the<br>
above-mentioned alkali metal salt and/or the alkaline earth<br>
metal salt is not particularly limited and examples thereof<br>
are salts of potassium, sodium, magnesium, and the like.<br>
An acid forming the above-mentioned salt is not<br>
particularly limited and examples of the acid include<br>
organic acids, for example, carboxylic acids such as<br>
octylic acid, hexylic acid, butyric acid, acetic acid, and<br>
formic acid and inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid,<br>
nitric acid.<br>
[0028]<br>
Among the above-mentioned alkali metal salts and/or<br>
alkaline earth metal salts, alkali metal salts and alkaline<br>
earth metal salts of organic acids having 2 to 16 carbon<br>
atoms are more preferable and magnesium carboxylate having<br>
2 to 16 carbon atoms and potassium carboxylate having 2 to<br>
16 carbon atoms are further preferable.<br>
[0029]<br>
The above-mentioned magnesium carboxylate or<br>
potassium carboxylate of organic acids having 2 to 16<br>
carbon atoms' is not particularly limited and for example,<br>
magnesium acetate, potassium acetate, magnesium propionate,<br>
potassium propionate, magnesium 2-ethylbutanate, potassium<br>
2-ethylbutanate, magnesium 2-ethylhexanate, and potassium<br>
2-ethylhexanate are preferable to be used. These salts may<br>
be used alone or two or more of them are used in<br>
combination.<br>
[0030]<br>
The addition amount of the above-mentioned alkali<br>
metal salt and/or alkaline earth metal salt is not<br>
particularly limited in the above-mentioned heat-shielding<br>
layer and for example, in the case where the above-<br><br><br>
mentioned transparent resin is polyvinyl acetal resin, the<br>
lower limit of the addition amount is 0.001 parts by weight<br>
and the upper limit is 1.0 part by weight to 100 parts by<br>
weight of the polyvinyl acetal resin. If it is less than<br>
0.001 parts by weight, the adhesion strength may possibly<br>
be decreased in the circumferential part of the interlayer<br>
film in highly humid atmosphere and if it exceeds 1.0 part<br>
by weight, the adhesion strength becomes too low and the<br>
transparency of the interlayer film is lost in some.cases.<br>
The lower limit is more preferably 0.01 parts by weight and<br>
the upper limit is more preferably 0.2 parts by weight.<br>
[0031]<br>
The above-mentioned heat-shielding agent is not<br>
particularly limited if it is a substance capable of giving<br>
heat-shielding property to the heat-shielding layer and for<br>
example, tin-dope indium oxide fine particles (hereinafter,<br>
referred to as ITO fine particles) are preferable to be<br>
used.<br>
The above-mentioned ITO fine particles are preferable<br>
to be finely and evenly dispersed in the above-mentioned<br>
heat-shielding layer so as to sufficiently exhibit the<br>
effect. Practically, to be finely and evenly dispersed<br>
means the state that the ITO fine particles are dispersed<br>
without causing agglomeration to the extent that the<br>
transparency decrease owing to ITO fine particle addition<br>
cannot be confirmed in the case of observation of the<br>
above-mentioned heat-shielding layer with eyes, in other<br>
words, to the extent that light scattering by the ITO fine<br>
particles scarcely takes place in the visible light region.<br>
More particularly, the above-mentioned ITO fine<br>
particles are preferable to have an average particle<br>
diameter of 80 nm or smaller. If the average particle<br>
diameter exceeds 80 nm, the visible light scattering by the<br>
ITO fine particles becomes significant and the transparency<br>
of the interlayer film for a laminate glass of the present<br><br><br>
invention to be obtained may possibly be deteriorated. As<br>
a result, in the case of using the film for a laminate<br>
glass, the haze may be worsened and, for example, highly<br>
advanced transparency required for an automotive front<br>
glass or the like cannot be obtained.<br>
[0032]<br>
The above-mentioned ITO fine particles are preferable<br>
to be dispersed so as to satisfy one or less particle with<br>
a particle diameter of 100 nm or larger per 1 µm2. It<br>
means the dispersion state that in the case where the<br>
above-mentioned heat-shielding layer is photographed and<br>
observed by a transmission electron microscope, no ITO fine<br>
particle with a particle diameter of 100 nm or larger is<br>
observed or when ITO fine particles with a particle<br>
diameter of 100 nm or larger are observed and if one ITO<br>
fine particle with a particle diameter of 100 nm or larger<br>
is set in the center of a frame of 1 µm2, no other ITO<br>
particle with a particle diameter of 100 nm or large is<br>
observed within the frame. Accordingly, if the interlayer<br>
film for a laminate glass of the present invention is used<br>
for a laminate glass, the laminate glass is provided with a<br>
low haze and is excellent in transparency and the entire<br>
interlayer film for a laminate glass of the present<br>
invention is provided with high heat-shielding property.<br>
The observation with the transmission electron microscope<br>
may be carried out, for example, at an acceleration voltage<br>
of 100 kV by employing H-7100 FA model transmission<br>
electron microscope manufactured by Hitachi Ltd.<br>
[0033]<br>
The addition amount of the above-mentioned ITO fine<br>
particles in the above-mentioned heat-shielding layer is<br>
not particularly limited and for example, in the case where<br>
the transparent resin is polyvinyl acetal resin, the lower<br>
limit is preferably 0.1 parts by weight and the upper limit<br>
is preferably 3.0 parts by weight to 100 parts by weight of<br><br><br>
the polyvinyl acetal resin. If it is less than 0.1 parts<br>
by weight, no sufficient IR cutting effect may be obtained<br>
and if it exceeds 3.0 parts by weight, the transparency to<br>
the visible light is decreased and the haze is increased in<br>
some cases.<br>
[0034]<br>
In general, the above-mentioned ITO fine particles<br>
are evenly dispersed in an organic solvent and then added<br>
to the above-mentioned polyvinyl acetal resin to finely<br>
disperse the particles in the above-mentioned polyvinyl<br>
acetal resin, and it is preferable that a plasticizer of a<br>
similar type to that of the above-mentioned plasticizer to<br>
be used for the plasticization of the above-mentioned<br>
polyvinyl acetal resin is used as a main dispersant for the<br>
even dispersion.<br>
[0035]<br>
The heat-shielding layer is preferable to further<br>
contain a dispersion stabilizer.<br>
As the above-mentioned dispersion stabilizer, for<br>
example, a coordination compound comprising at least one<br>
kind of atom selected from group consisting of nitrogen,<br>
phosphorus, and chalcogen type atom group as a coordinating<br>
atom of ITO is preferable. Such the coordination compound<br>
is not particularly limited and examples of the<br>
coordination compound are anionic surfactants such as<br>
carboxylate salts, sulfonic acid salts, sulfuric acid ester<br>
salts, phosphoric acid ester salts, polymer type<br>
macromolecules, and condensate polymer type macromolecules;<br>
nonionic surfactants such as ethers, esters, ester ethers,<br>
and nitrogen-containing compounds; cationic surfactants<br>
such as primary to tertiary amine salts, quaternary<br>
ammonium salts, and polyethylene polyamine derivatives; and<br>
amphoteric surfactants such as carboxybetaine,<br>
aminocarboxylic acid salts, sulfobetaine, aminosulfuric<br>
acid esters, and imidazoline. Among them, at least one<br><br><br>
selected from a group consisting of sulfuric acid type<br>
ester compounds, phosphoric acid ester type compounds,<br>
ricinoleic acid, polyricinoleic acid, polycarboxylic acid,<br>
polyhydric alcohol type surfactants, polyvinyl alcohol, and<br>
polyvinyl butyral is particularly preferable to be used<br>
since it can efficiently prevent agglomeration of the ITO<br>
fine particles.<br>
[0036]<br>
The addition amount of the above-mentioned dispersion<br>
stabilizer is not particularly limited and for example, in<br>
the case where the transparent resin is polyvinyl acetal<br>
resin, the lower limit is preferably 0.001 parts by weight<br>
and the upper limit is preferably 5.0 parts by weight to<br>
100 parts by weight of polyvinyl acetal resin. If it is<br>
less than 0.001 parts by weight, the effect of the<br>
dispersion stabilizer is scarcely obtained. If it exceeds<br>
5.0 parts by weight, foaming occurs at the time of the<br>
interlayer film formation or foaming occurs and the<br>
adhesion strength between the interlayer film and a glass<br>
becomes too high in the case of a laminate glass formation.<br>
The lower limit is more preferably 0.05 parts by weight and<br>
the upper limit is more preferably 1.0 part by weight, to<br>
1.0 part by weight of the ITO fine particles.<br>
[0037]<br>
With respect to the above-mentioned heat-shielding<br>
layer, the haze can be improved further by adding a<br>
chelating agent and a compound having at least one carboxyl<br>
group to the main dispersant. In this case, the chelating<br>
agent and the compound having at least one carboxyl group<br>
may be mixed with the main dispersant or added separately<br>
to the polyvinyl acetal resin without being mixed with the<br>
main dispersant.<br>
[0038]<br>
The above-mentioned chelating agent is not<br>
particularly limited and EDTAs and J3-diketones such as<br><br><br>
acetylacetone, benzoyltrifluoroacetone, dipivaloylmethane<br>
can be exemplified and those having good compatibility with<br>
the plasticizer and polyvinyl acetal resin are preferable.<br>
Among them, the above-mentioned β-diketones are preferable<br>
and particularly acetylacetone is preferable. The effect<br>
of addition of these chelating agents is considered that<br>
the agents are coordinated with the above-mentioned ITO<br>
fine particles and therefore, the ITO fine particles are<br>
prevented from agglomeration to result in good dispersion<br>
state and improvement of the haze.<br>
[0039]<br>
The addition amount of the above-mentioned chelating<br>
agent is not particularly limited and for example, in the<br>
case where the above-mentioned transparent resin is<br>
polyvinyl acetal resin, the lower limit is preferably 0.001<br>
parts by weight and the upper limit is preferably 2 parts<br>
by weight to 100 parts by weight of polyvinyl acetal resin.<br>
If it is less than 0.001 parts by weight, the effect of the<br>
addition is scarcely expected and if it exceeds 2 parts by<br>
weight, foaming may occur at the time of film formation or<br>
foaming may occur at the time of a laminate glass<br>
production. The lower limit is more preferably 0.01 parts<br>
by weight and the upper limit is more preferably 1 part by<br>
weight.<br>
[0040]<br>
The above-mentioned compound having one or more<br>
carboxyl groups is not particularly limited and for example,<br>
aliphatic carboxylic acids, aliphatic dicarboxylic acids,<br>
aromatic carboxylic acids, aromatic dicarboxylic acids, and<br>
hydroxyacids can be exemplified. Practically, benzoic acid,<br>
phthalic acid, salicylic acid, ricinoleic acid or the like<br>
may be used. Among them, aliphatic C2 to C18 carboxylic<br>
acids are preferably used and aliphatic C2 to C10 carboxylic<br>
acids are even more preferably used. Practically, acetic<br>
acid, propionic acid, n-butyric acid, 2-ethylbutyric acid,<br><br><br>
n-hexanoic acid, 2-ethylhexanoic acid, and n-octanoic acid<br>
can be exemplified.<br>
[0041]<br>
The addition amount of the above-mentioned compound<br>
having one ore more carboxylic groups is not particularly<br>
limited and for example, in the case where the above-<br>
mentioned transparent resin is polyvinyl acetal resin, the<br>
lower limit is preferably 0.001 parts by weight and the<br>
upper limit is preferably 2 parts by weight to 100 parts by<br>
weight of polyvinyl acetal resin. If it is less than 0.001<br>
parts by weight, the effect of the addition is scarcely<br>
expected and if it exceeds 2 parts by weight, discoloration<br>
of the heat-shielding layer may possibly occur and the<br>
adhesion strength of a glass and heat-shielding layer may<br>
be decreased. The lower limit is more preferably 0.01<br>
parts by weight and the upper limit is more preferably 1<br>
part by weight.<br>
[0042]<br>
The above-mentioned heat-shielding layer is<br>
preferable to contain an antioxidant.<br>
The above-mentioned antioxidant is not particularly<br>
limited and for example, as a phenol type, 2, 6-di-tert-<br>
butyl-p-cresol (BHT) (manufactured by Sumitomo Chemical Co.,<br>
Ltd., Sumilizer BHT), tetrakis-[methylene-3-(3',5'-di-tert-<br>
butyl-4'-hydroxyphenyl)propionate]methane (manufactured by<br>
Ciba-Geigy Corp., Irganox 1010) can be exemplified. These<br>
antioxidants may be used alone or two or more of them can<br>
be used in combination.<br>
[0043]<br>
The addition amount of the above-mentioned<br>
antioxidant is not particularly limited and for example, in<br>
the case where the above-mentioned transparent resin is<br>
polyvinyl acetal resin, the lower limit is preferably 0.01<br>
parts by weight and the upper limit is preferably 5.0 parts<br>
by weight to 100 parts by weight of polyvinyl acetal resin.<br><br><br>
If it is less than 0.01 parts by weight, the oxidation<br>
prevention effect is scarcely expected and if it exceeds<br>
5.0 parts by weight, foaming may occur at the time of film<br>
formation of interlayer film or foaming may occur at the<br>
time of a laminate glass production.<br>
[0044]<br>
In the interlayer film for a laminate glass of the<br>
present invention, the above-mentioned UV shielding layer<br>
is preferable to have an UV transmittance of 60% or,lower<br>
measured in accordance with SAE J1796 in the case where the<br>
UV-shielding layer is inserted between two plates of<br>
glasses selected from a group consisting of clear glasses,<br>
green glasses,' high heat ray absorption glasses, and UV<br>
absorption glasses to obtain a laminate glass. If it<br>
exceeds 60%, the visible light transmittance is decreased<br>
after a durable test to light in the case of a laminate<br>
glass comprising the UV-shielding layer and the laminate<br>
glass cannot be used for an automotive front glass whose<br>
visible light transmittance has an allowable lower limit<br>
and may not be used practically. It is more preferably 30%<br>
or lower and even more preferably 10% or lower.<br>
[0045]<br>
The above-mentioned UV-shielding layer is preferable<br>
to contain transparent resin and an UV-cutting agent.<br>
The above-mentioned transparent resin is not<br>
particularly limited and for example, those similar to the<br>
transparent resin for the above-mentioned heat-shielding<br>
layer can be exemplified.<br>
[0046]<br>
The above-mentioned UV-cutting agent is preferably at<br>
least one UV absorbent selected from a group consisting of<br>
metal type, metal oxide type, benzotriazole type,<br>
benzophenone type, triazine type, benzoate type, malonic<br>
acid ester type, and oxalic acid anilide type ones. These<br>
UV absorbents may be used alone or two or more of them are<br><br><br>
used in combination.<br>
[0047]<br>
The above-mentioned metal type UV absorbent is not<br>
particularly limited and examples of the agent include<br>
platinum ultrafine particles, fine particles obtained by<br>
coating the surface of platinum ultrafine particles with<br>
silica, palladium ultrafine particles, and fine particles<br>
obtained by coating the surface of palladium ultrafine<br>
particles with silica.<br>
[0048]<br>
The above-mentioned metal oxide type UV absorbent is<br>
not particularly limited and examples of the agent include<br>
zinc oxide and/or titanium oxide, cerium oxide and the like.<br>
Among them, zinc oxide and/or titanium oxide is preferable.<br>
[0049]<br>
The above-mentioned metal oxide type UV absorbent is<br>
preferably coated with an insulating metal oxide on the<br>
surface so as to suppress deterioration of the interlayer<br>
film for a laminate glass of the present invention.<br>
The above-mentioned insulating metal oxide is not<br>
particularly limited and for example, those having a band<br>
gap energy of 5.0 eV or higher such as silica, alumina, and<br>
zirconia are exemplified and among them, silica is<br>
preferable to be used.<br>
[0050]<br>
As above-mentioned the metal oxide type UV absorbent<br>
coated with silica, usable examples thereof may be those<br>
which are commonly commercialized and those which are<br>
obtained by treating the above-mentioned metal oxide type<br>
UV absorbent with a reagent capable of forming a silica<br>
layer on the surface by reaction with the surface of the<br>
agent. The above-mentioned reagent capable of forming a<br>
silica layer on the surface is not particularly limited and<br>
for example, tetraethoxysilane, silicon chloride or the<br>
like can be exemplified.<br><br><br>
[0051]<br>
Further, the above-mentioned metal oxide type UV<br>
absorbent is preferable to be coated with a hydrolyzable<br>
organosilicon compound on the surface.<br>
As the metal oxide type UV absorbent coated with the<br>
hydrolyzable organosilicon compound on the surface, usable<br>
examples thereof may include those which are commonly<br>
commercialized and those which are obtained by treating the<br>
surface of the above-mentioned metal oxide type UV<br>
absorbent with a silane coupling agent.<br>
[0052]<br>
Further, the above-mentioned metal oxide type UV<br>
absorbent is preferable to be coated with a silicone type<br>
compound on the surface.<br>
As the metal oxide type UV absorbent coated with the<br>
silicone type compound on the surface, usable examples<br>
thereof may include those which are commonly commercialized<br>
and those which are obtained by treating the surface of the<br>
above-mentioned metal oxide type UV absorbent with Methicon,<br>
Dimethicon and the like.<br>
[0053]<br>
As the above-mentioned benzotriazole type UV<br>
absorbent, examples thereof include benzotriazole type ones<br>
such as 2-(2'-hydroxy-5'-methylphenyl) benzotriazole<br>
(manufactured by Ciba-Geigy Corp., Tinuvin P), 2-(2'-<br>
hydroxy-3',5'-di-tert-butylphenyl)benzotriazole<br>
(manufactured by Ciba-Geigy Corp., Tinuvin 320), 2-(2'-<br>
hydroxy-3'-tert-butyl-5'-methylphenyl)-5-<br>
chlorobenzotriazole (manufactured by Ciba-Geigy Corp.,<br>
Tinuvin 326), and 2-(2'-hydroxy-3',5'-di-<br>
amylphenyl)benzotriazole (manufactured by Ciba-Geigy Corp.,<br>
Tinuvin 328) ; and hindered amine type ones such as LA-57<br>
manufactured by Adeka Argus Chemical Co., Ltd.<br>
[0054]<br>
As the above-mentioned benzophenone type UV absorbent,<br><br><br>
examples thereof may include octabenzone (manufactured by<br>
Ciba-Geigy Corp., Chimassorb 81).<br>
[0055]<br>
As the above-mentioned triazine type UV absorbent,<br>
examples thereof may include 2-(4,6-diphenyl-l,3,5-triazin-<br>
2-yl)-5-[(hexyl)oxy]-phenol (manufactured by Ciba-Geigy<br>
Corp., Tinuvin 1577 FF).<br>
[0056]<br>
As the above-mentioned benzoate type UV absorbent,<br>
examples thereof may include 2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl-3,5-<br>
di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzoate (manufactured by Ciba-Geigy<br>
Corp., Tinuvin 120).<br>

absorbent, commercialized examples thereof may include<br>

ester (manufactured by Clariant Inc., Hostavin PR-25).<br>
[0058]<br>
As the above-mentioned oxalic acid anilide type UV<br>
absorbent, commercialized examples thereof may include 2-<br>
ethyl-2'-ethoxyoxyanilide (manufactured by Clariant Inc.,<br>
Sanduvor VSU).<br>
[0059]<br>
The above-mentioned malonic acid ester type and<br>
oxalic acid anilide type UV absorbents have an UV<br>
absorption region in UV-B and in consideration of that the<br>
wavelength of UV rays causing deterioration of various<br>
transparent resins is in 300 to 320 nm, it can be said that<br>
these agents are suitable UV absorbents for protection of<br>
the resins from UV rays. Further, since the molar<br>
absorption is extremely high, as compared with a<br>
conventionally known UV absorbent, the UV absorption amount<br>
for the same addition amount is much higher and further<br>
since the molecular weight is low, the addition amount can<br>
be saved to result in cost down.<br><br>
[0060]<br>
As the above-mentioned UV-cutting agent, use of the<br>
above-mentioned malonic acid ester type and/or oxalic acid<br>
anilide type UV absorbent can keep the decrease of visible<br>
light transmittance of the interlayer film for a laminate<br>
glass of the present invention in a prescribed range or<br>
lower after the durability test to light, which will be<br>
described later.<br>
[0061]<br>
The addition amount of the above-mentioned UV-cutting<br>
agent is not particularly limited and the lower limit is<br>
preferably 0.01 parts by weight and the upper limit is<br>
preferably 5.0 parts by weight to 100 parts by weight of<br>
the transparent resin. If it is less than 0.01 parts by<br>
weight, the UV absorption effect is scarcely obtained and<br>
if it exceeds 5.0 parts by weight, a problem of weathering-<br>
resistance deterioration of the resin may occur in some<br>
cases. The lower limit is more preferably 0.05 parts by<br>
weight and the upper limit is more preferably 1.0 part by<br>
weight.<br>
[0062]<br>
The above-mentioned UV-shielding layer may further<br>
contain, for example, an antioxidant and various types of<br>
photostabilizers as other additives to prevent<br>
deterioration by heat in an extruder. Further, based on<br>
the necessity, modified silicone oil and a surfactant as an<br>
adhesion strength adjustment agent, a flame retarding agent,<br>
an antistatic agent, an adhesion strength adjustment agent,<br>
a moisture resistance agent, a heat ray reflecting agent,<br>
and a heat ray absorbent may be added as additives.<br>
[0063]<br>
The above-mentioned photostabilizers are not<br>
particularly limited and may include hindered amine type<br>
ones, for example, Adeka Stab LA-57 manufactured by Asahi<br>
Denka Co., Ltd.<br><br>
[0064]<br>
The above-mentioned modified silicone oil is not<br>
particularly limited and may include, for example, epoxy-<br>
modified silicone oil, ether-modified silicone oil, ester-<br>
modified silicone oil, amine-modified silicone oil, and<br>
carboxyl-modified silicone oil disclosed in Japanese Kokoku<br>
Publication Sho-55-29950. These modified silicon oils are<br>
generally liquids obtained by reaction of polysiloxanes<br>
with compounds for modification. The above-mentioned<br>
modified silicone oils may be used alone and two or more of<br>
them are used in combination.<br>
[0065]<br>
The lower limit of the molecular weight of the above-<br>
mentioned modified silicone oil is preferably 800 and the<br>
upper limit is preferably 5,000. If it is lower than 800,<br>
the localization on the surface is sometimes lowered and if<br>
it exceeds 5,000, the compatibility with the resin becomes<br>
inferior to result in bleeding out of the oil to the film<br>
surface and decrease of adhesion strength to the glass.<br>
The lower limit is more preferably 1,500 and the upper<br>
limit is more preferably 4,000.<br>
[0066]<br>
The addition amount of the modified silicone oil is<br>
not particularly limited and, for example, in the case<br>
where the above-mentioned transparent resin is polyvinyl<br>
acetal resin, the lower limit is preferably 0.01 parts by<br>
weight and the upper limit is preferably 0.2 parts by<br>
weight to 100 parts by weight of the polyvinyl acetal resin.<br>
If it is less than 0.01 parts by weight, the effect for<br>
preventing whitening owing to moisture absorption is<br>
scarcely obtained and if it exceeds 0.2 parts by weight,<br>
compatibility with the resin becomes inferior to result in<br>
bleeding out of the oil to the film surface and decrease of<br>
adhesion strength to the glass. The lower limit is more<br>
preferably 0.03 parts by weight and the upper limit is more<br><br>
preferably 0.1 parts by weight.<br>
[0067]<br>
The above-mentioned surfactant is not particularly<br>
limited and, for example, sodium laurate and<br>
alkylbenzenesulfonic acid can be exemplified.<br>
[0068]<br>
The interlayer film for a laminate glass of the<br>
present invention comprising at least each one layer of<br>
such heat-shielding layer and UV-shielding layer is,, that a<br>
visible light transmittance decrease is preferably 1.0% or<br>
lower measured in accordance with JIS Z 8722 and JIS R 3106<br>
(1998) after the interlayer film is inserted between two<br>
plates of glasses selected from a group consisting of clear<br>
glasses, green glasses, high heat ray absorption glasses,<br>
and UV absorption glasses to obtain a laminate glass; and<br>
Super Xenon 100-hours radiation test is run for the<br>
laminate glass. If it exceeds 1.0%, the visible light<br>
transmittance decrease after the durability test to light<br>
is too significant and it results in a problem for-<br>
practical use.<br>
[0069]<br>
Further, the interlayer film for a laminate glass of<br>
the present invention comprising at least each one layer of<br>
such heat-shielding layer and UV-shielding layer is that a<br>
visible light transmittance decrease is preferably 3.0% or<br>
lower measured in accordance with JIS Z 8722 and JIS R 3106<br>
(1998) after the interlayer film is inserted between two<br>
plates of glasses selected from a group consisting of clear<br>
glasses, green glasses, high heat ray absorption glasses,<br>
and UV absorption glasses to obtain a laminate glass; and<br>
Super UV 300-hours radiation test is run for the laminate<br>
glass. If it exceeds 3.0%, the visible light transmittance<br>
decrease after the durability test to light is too<br>
significant and it results in a problem for practical use.<br>
The upper limit is more preferably 2.0% and even more<br><br>
preferably 1.0%.<br>
[0070]<br>
Further, in the case where a laminate glass is<br>
produced using the interlayer film for a laminate glass of<br>
the present invention, the increase ratio of yellow index<br>
(YI) and the alteration ratio of b* value of CIE color<br>
system are preferable to be low after the Super Xenon 100-<br>
hours radiation test and Super UV 300-hours radiation test.<br>
If the alteration ratios of the yellow index (YI) and the<br>
b* value of CIE color system are higher, the heat-shielding<br>
agent of such as ITO fine particles and/or the transparent<br>
resin contained in the above-mentioned heat-shielding layer<br>
is considerably deteriorated and the optical properties,<br>
mechanical properties, and physical properties of the<br>
interlayer film for a laminate glass of the present<br>
invention cannot be sometimes maintained after the above-<br>
mentioned test.<br>
[0071]<br>
The thickness of the interlayer film for a laminate<br>
glass of the present invention is not particularly limited<br>
and in terms of the lowest limits of needed penetration<br>
resistance and weathering-resistance, the lower limit is<br>
preferably 0.3 mm and the upper limit is preferably 0.8 mm.<br>
Based on the necessity of improvement of the penetration<br>
resistance or the like, the interlayer film for a laminate<br>
glass of the present invention and an interlayer film for a<br>
laminate glass other than the former may be laminated for<br>
combination use.<br>
[0072]<br>
A method of producing the interlayer film for a<br>
laminate glass of the present invention is not particularly<br>
limited and there are methods, for example, involving<br>
forming the above-mentioned heat-shielding layer and the<br>
UV-shielding layer in sheet-like form by conventional film<br>
formation method such as an extrusion method, a calender<br><br>
method, a press method and then laminating obtained sheets<br>
and a more preferable method is an extrusion method<br>
involving extrusion in biaxial direction and according to<br>
such a method, the haze of the interlayer film for a<br>
laminate glass to be obtained can further be improved.<br>
[0073]<br>
The method for obtaining the above-mentioned heat-<br>
shielding layer is not particularly limited, however a<br>
method involving adding a dispersion containing the heat-<br>
shielding agent such as ITO fine particles evenly dispersed<br>
in an organic solvent to the transparent resin and then<br>
kneading the mixture may be generally employed.<br>
The organic solvent for the above-mentioned<br>
dispersion is not particularly limited and a plasticizer of<br>
a similar type to the plasticizer to be used is preferable.<br>
The apparatus to be used for mixing the ITO fine<br>
particles and the organic solvent is not particularly<br>
limited and, for example, a planetary type stirring<br>
apparatus, a wet mechanochemical apparatus, a Henshel mixer,<br>
a homogenizer, an ultrasonic radiation apparatus and the<br>
like is used commonly.<br>
[0074]<br>
The apparatus to be used for kneading is not<br>
particularly limited and, for example, an extruder, a<br>
plastograph, a kneader, a Bumbury's mixer, a calender roll,<br>
or the like can be exemplified. Among them, in terms of<br>
continuous production, the extruder is preferable.<br>
[0075]<br>
The method for obtaining the above-mentioned UV-<br>
shielding layer is not particularly limited and in general,<br>
a method of adding an UV-cutting agent in place of the<br>
heat-shielding agent of ITO fine particles and the like in<br>
the above-mentioned method for obtaining the heat-shielding<br>
layer may be employed.<br>
[0076]<br><br>
Since the interlayer film for a laminate glass of the<br>
present invention comprises at least each one layer of the<br>
heat-shielding layer excellent in transparency, heat-<br>
shielding property, and electromagnetic wave transmittance<br>
and UV-shielding layer excellent in the UV-shielding<br>
efficiency, use of the interlayer film for a laminate glass<br>
of the present invention makes it possible to obtain a<br>
laminate glass excellent in transparency, heat-shielding<br>
property, and electromagnetic wave transmittance and<br>
scarcely deteriorated in the initial optical properties<br>
even after a light stability test.<br>
The present invention also provides a laminate glass<br>
comprising the interlayer film for a laminate glass of the<br>
present invention.<br>
[0077]<br>
With respect to the laminate glass of the present<br>
invention, in general, the interlayer film for a laminate<br>
glass of the present invention is preferable to be disposed<br>
in such a manner that the UV-shielding layer is in the<br>
outside light incident side in relation to the heat-<br>
shielding layer.<br>
As described above, the weathering-resistance of the<br>
above-mentioned heat-shielding layer is rather considerably<br>
affected by the weathering-resistance of the heat-shielding<br>
agent such as ITO fine particles contained therein.<br>
Therefore, when the outside light rays directly enter in<br>
the above-mentioned heat-shielding layer, it may be<br>
considered that the heat-shielding agent such as above-<br>
mentioned ITO fine particles and the dispersion stabilizer<br>
causes chemical change owing to the light rays with<br>
wavelength in the UV wavelength region having high energy,<br>
and at the same time affects even the resin matrix in the<br>
peripheral parts to result in weathering-resistance<br>
decrease. Accordingly, arrangement of the above-mentioned<br>
UV-shielding layer in the outside light ray incident side<br><br>
in relation to the above-mentioned heat-shielding layer<br>
decreases the dose of the light rays with wavelength in the<br>
UV wavelength region which enter in the above-mentioned<br>
heat-shielding layer and thus prevents the weathering-<br>
resistance deterioration of the heat-shielding layer. As a<br>
result, deterioration of the weathering-resistance of the<br>
laminate glass of the present invention can be suppressed.<br>
[0078]<br>
The glass to be used for the laminate glass of the<br>
present invention is not particularly limited and for<br>
example, commonly used a transparent plate glass can be<br>
exemplified. Particularly, a heat ray absorption glass<br>
with total transmittance of 65% or less in the wavelength<br>
region of 900 to 1,300 nm is preferable. It is because the<br>
IR-cutting property of the ITO fine particles is better in<br>
a wavelength region longer than 1,300 nm and relatively low<br>
in a wavelength region of 900 to 1,300 nm and accordingly,<br>
a combination of the interlayer film for a laminate glass<br>
of the present invention with the above-mentioned heat ray<br>
absorption glass can lower the solar radiation<br>
transmittance and increase the solar radiation cutting<br>
ratio for the same visible light transmittance as compared<br>
with a combination of the interlayer film with clear<br>
glasses.<br>
[0079]<br>
The laminate glass of the present invention may<br>
include combination of the interlayer film for a laminate<br>
glass of the present invention and a plastic film. In<br>
particular, for example, combinations of the interlayer<br>
film for a laminate glass of the present invention with<br>
transparent plastic films of polycarbonates, poly(methyl<br>
methacrylate), and the like having no metal coating layer<br>
are exemplified. Such a laminate glass is obtained using<br>
the interlayer film for a laminate glass of the present<br>
invention and thus is excellent in transparency, heat-<br><br>
shielding property, and electromagnetic wave transmittance<br>
and scarcely causes deterioration of the initial optical<br>
properties even after the light stability test and<br>
additionally, since the laminate glass comprises the<br>
plastic film, the crime prevention and penetration<br>
properties can be improved.<br>
Further, a rigid body other than a glass, for example,<br>
a metal, an inorganic material, or the like may be used as<br>
vibration suppressing material by laminating it on the<br>
interlayer film for a laminate glass of the present<br>
invention.<br>
[0080]<br>
The laminate glass of the present invention can be<br>
used for an automotive front glass, a side glass, glass<br>
parts for vehicles such as aircrafts and trains, glasses<br>
for buildings, and the like. Further, as the interlayer<br>
film for a laminate glass, multilayer type interlayer film<br>
for a laminate glass having a multilayer structure can be<br>
used and for example, the multilayer type interlayer film<br>
for a laminate glass can be used as a multilayer type<br>
sound-insulating interlayer film for a laminate glass and a<br>
functional laminate glass.<br>
EFFECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0081]<br>
Since the interlayer film for a laminate glass of the<br>
present invention comprises at least each one layer of<br>
heat-shielding layers and UV-shielding layers, the<br>
interlayer film for a laminate glass is excellent in the<br>
transparency, the heat shielding property, and<br>
electromagnetic wave transmittance in the case of use for a<br>
laminate glass and scarcely causes visible light<br>
transmittance decrease even after a durable test to light<br>
and doesnot deteriorate the initial optical quality.<br><br>
