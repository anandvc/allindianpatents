EPOXY RESIN COMPOSITION FOR PRINTED WIRING BOARD, RESIN<br>
COMPOSITION VARNISH, PREPREG, METAL CLAD LAMINATE, PRINTED<br>
WIRING BOARD AND MULTILAYER PRINTED WIRING BOARD<br>
[TECHNICAL FIELD]<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to an epoxy resin composition, a prepreg, a metal clad<br>
laminate and a printed wiring board used as materials for printed wiring boards and a<br>
multilayer printed wiring board produced by using these materials.<br>
[BACKGROUND ART]<br>
[0002]<br>
Epoxy resin composition-containing prepregs have been known as the adhesive<br>
materials used in production of printed wiring boards. Such a prepreg is produced by<br>
impregnating a substrate such as glass cloth with a varnish of epoxy resin composition<br>
and drying the resulting substrate.<br>
[0003]<br>
And, a printed wiring board is produced by forming a metal clad laminate by means of<br>
preparing a laminated sheet by piling a particular number of the prepregs and placing a<br>
metal foil additionally on at least one outermost layer and heat press-molding the<br>
laminated sheet under, forming holes for through holes in the clad laminate obtained for<br>
example by drilling, forming through holes by plating the holes, and forming a<br>
particular circuit pattern on the metal clad laminate surface by etching the metal foil<br>
thereon.<br>
[0004]<br>
The multilayer printed wiring board is obtained by using such a printed wiring board<br>
and a prepreg. Specifically, a multilayer printed wiring board is obtained by placing a<br>
particular number of prepregs on one or both faces of the printed wiring board and<br>
additionally a metal foil on the outermost layers and heat press-molding the laminate.<br>
[0005]<br>
Holes are formed in the multilayer printed wiring board; throughholes are formed by<br>
plating the holes; and a multilayer printed wiring board having a circuit on the<br>
outermost surfaces is prepared by forming a circuit pattern on the metal foil on the<br><br>
metal clad laminate surface by etching.<br>
[0006]<br>
Dicyandiamidebased curing agents have been used widely as the curing agent for the<br>
epoxy resins used in preparing such a prepreg. However, unfavorably, epoxy resins<br>
cured by using such a dicyandiamide-based curing agent were less heat resistant and<br>
thus, the resulting printed wiring boards were lower in heat resistance.<br>
[0007]<br>
It is known to use a phenolic curing agent such as cresol novolak resin, phenolic novolak<br>
resin, or bisphenol A-based epoxy resin as the curing agent for epoxy resin for<br>
improvement of the heat resistance of printed wiring boards (see, e.g., Patent Document<br>
1).<br>
[0008]<br>
However, epoxy resin compositions containing a phenolic curing agent as the curing<br>
agent for epoxy resin had a problem of low moldability, compared to epoxy resin<br>
compositions containing a dicyandiamide-based curing agent from the following<br>
reasons:<br>
[0009]<br>
Specifically, it is difficult to keep the board thickness constant, because the resin<br>
components contained in the prepreg prepared by using a phenolic curing agent as the<br>
curing agent epoxy resin is too low in viscosity. It is also difficult to adjust the timing<br>
of pressurization during curing, because the resin becomes very viscous, giving a gel by<br>
three-dimensional crosslinking, at a particular time point. As a result, there was a<br>
problem that the range of the moldable curing (gel time) is narrow (the range of<br>
favorable molding condition is limited).<br>
[0010]<br>
An epoxy resin composition for printed wiring board containing an imidazole-silane<br>
compound, prepared by using a phenolic curing agent containing a bifunctional or lower<br>
phenolic curing agent in an amount of 20 to 50% is known as a method of improving the<br>
moldability of the phenolic curing agent-containing prepregs (see e.g., Patent Document<br>
2).<br>
[0011]<br>
However, although the prepreg obtained by using the epoxy resin composition for<br>
printed wiring board described in Patent Document 2 was improved in moldability, the<br>
adhesiveness between prepregs and also between the prepreg and circuit formed for<br><br>
example with copper foil was insufficient, unfavorably.<br>

[0018]<br>
The object, characteristics, aspects, and advantages of the present invention will<br>
become more evident in the following detailed description.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0019]<br>
Hereinafter, favorable embodiments of the present invention will be described.<br>
[0020]<br>
The epoxy resin composition for printed wiring board in the present embodiment is<br>
characterized by including (A) an epoxy resin component containing an epoxy resin<br>
(A-1) having nitrogen and bromine atoms in the same molecule, (B) a phenolic curing<br>
agent component containing a phenol resin (B-l), and (C) a curing accelerator<br>
component containing an imidazole-silane compound (C-1).<br>
[0021]<br>
The epoxy resin component (A) contains the epoxy resin (A_l) having nitrogen and<br>
bromine atoms in the same molecule. Such an epoxy resin (A-1) is relatively higher in<br>
polarity because it contains nitrogen and bromine atoms, and thus superior in<br>
adhesiveness to substrates such as glass cloth and metal foils. It also shows higher<br>
adhesiveness, if used in combination with an imidazole-silane compound (C-1) described<br>
below.<br>
[0022]<br>
Typical examples of the epoxy resins (A_1) having nitrogen and bromine atoms in the<br>
same molecule include epoxy resin represented by the following General Formula (1)<br>
having oxazolidone rings and bromine atoms in the same molecule.<br>
(in Formula (l), R1 represents a bivalent hydrocarbon group having bromine atoms and<br>
aromatic rings, and X1 represents a bivalent hydrocarbon group or the derivative group<br>
thereof).<br><br>
[0024]<br>
The bromine atom content in the epoxy resin (A-l) is preferably 10 to 20 mass % for<br>
preservation of sufficient flame resistance.<br>
[0025]<br>
Alternatively, the epoxy equivalence of the epoxy resin (A-l) is preferably,<br>
approximately 230 to 370 g/eq.<br>
[0026]<br>
The number of epoxy groups in 1 mole of the epoxy resin (A-l) is preferably 1.9 to 2.8,<br>
for improvement of the toughness of the resulting prepreg and the adhesiveness<br>
described above.<br>
[0027]<br>
Typical examples of the epoxy resins (A-l) include "AER4100" and "AER5200"<br>
manufactured by Asahi Kasei Chemicals Corp., "DER593" manufactured by Dow<br>
Chemical Company, and the like that have oxazolidone rings and bromine atoms in the<br>
same molecule,<br>
[0028]<br>
The epoxy resin component (A) may contain an epoxy resin other than the epoxy resin<br>
(A-l) above.<br>
[0029]<br>
Typical examples of the epoxy resins other than the epoxy resin (A-1) include epoxy<br>
resins such as brominated bisphenol A type epoxy resins, cresol novolak-type epoxy<br>
resins, bisphenol F-type epoxy resins, phenolic novolak-type epoxy resins and<br>
dicyclopentadiene-type epoxy resins. These resins may be used alone or in<br>
combination of two or more.<br>
[0030]<br>
The content of the epoxy resin (A-l) in the epoxy resin component (A) is preferably 20 to<br>
80 mass %, more preferably 40 to 80 mass %. The blending ratio above is favorable,<br>
because it give an product particularly superior in heat resistance and adhesiveness.<br>
[0031]<br>
The content of the epoxy resin component (A) is preferably 20 to 90 mass %, more<br>
preferably 40 to 80 mass %, in the total amount of the epoxy resin composition.<br><br>
[0032]<br>
The epoxy resin composition in the present embodiment contains a phenolic curing<br>
agent component (B) as the curing agent of epoxy resin component (A). Use of a phenolic<br>
curing agent component (B) as the curing agent of epoxy resin (A) enables improvement<br>
in heat resistance larger than use of an amine-based curing agent such as<br>
dicyandiamide-based curing agent.<br>
[0033]<br>
The phenolic curing agent component (B) includes a phenol resin (B-l).<br>
[0034]<br>
Typical examples of the phenol resins (B-l) include phenolic novolak resins, bisphenol A<br>
novolak resins, cresol novolak resins, tetrabromobisphenol A novolak resins, and the<br>
like.<br>
[0035]<br>
The phenolic curing agent component (B) preferably contains a bifunctional or lower<br>
phenolic curing agent, in addition to the phenol resin (B-l). Typical examples of the<br>
bifunctional or lower phenolic curing agents include bisphenol A, phenol,<br>
tetrabromobisphenol A, and the like, as well as the derivatives thereof. The phenolic<br>
curing agent component (B), if it contains a bifunctional or lower phenolic curing agent,<br>
improves the moldability of the resulting prepreg.<br>
[0036]<br>
The content of the bifunctional or lower phenolic curing agent is preferably 20 to 50<br>
mass % in the total amount of the phenolic curing agent component (B). If the content is<br>
the range above, the curing agent composition provides a wider range of gel time<br>
suitable for molding and thus improves molding efficiency.<br>
[0037]<br>
The phenolic curing agent component (B) preferably contains the phenolic curing agent<br>
component (B) in an amount of 0.6 to 1.3 phenolic hydroxyl group equivalences to 1<br>
epoxy group equivalence of the epoxy resin contained in the epoxy resin component (A).<br>
[0038]<br>
The epoxy resin composition in the present embodiment contains (C) a curing<br>
accelerator component containing an imidazole-silane compound (CM) as the<br>
accelerator of the epoxy resin component (A). It is possible to obtain a prepreg superior<br>
in adhesiveness, by using such an imidazole-silane compound (C-l) and the epoxy resin<br>
(A-1) in combination.<br><br>
[0039]<br>
The imidazole-silane compound (CM) is a compound having both imidazole and<br>
alkoxysilyl groups in the molecule.<br>
[0040]<br>
The content of the imidazole-silane compound (CM) is preferably 0.05 to 2 mass % in the<br>
total amount of the epoxy resin component (A), the phenolic curing agent component (B)<br>
and the curing accelerator component (C). The imidazole-silane compound (CM), if<br>
contained in the range above, gives a prepreg superior both in heat resistance and<br>
adhesiveness.<br>
[0041]<br>
The imidazole-silane compound (CM) is preferably a trialkoxysilyl-type imidazole silane<br>
not containing a secondary hydroxyl group, represented by the following General<br>
Formula (2), especially for improvement in compatibility of the resin component and<br>
consequently for uniform impregnation of the resin composition varnish during<br>
production of prepreg.<br>
[0042]<br>
[Formula 2]<br><br>
(in Formula (2), R2 to R4 each independently represent an alkyl group such as methyl,<br>
ethyl or propyl, and X2 represents a bivalent hydrocarbon group such as linear<br>
alkylene).<br>
[0043]<br>
The epoxy resin composition in the present embodiment preferably contains an<br>
inorganic filler (D) additionally.<br>
[0044]<br>
The inorganic filler is, for example, a known inorganic filler traditionally blended in<br>
epoxy resin compositions, and examples thereof include spherical silica, aluminum<br>
hydroxide and the like. Among these fillers, aluminum hydroxide is particularly<br>
favorable, because drill abrasion is lower when holes are formed in the produced printed<br><br>
wiring board by drilling, and that having an average diameter of 5 to 2 μm is more<br>
preferable, for sufficient reduction of the thermal expansion coefficient. Spherical<br>
inorganic fillers such as spherical silica, particularly those having an average diameter<br>
of 2.0 to 0.3 μm, are also preferable, for sufficient reduction of thermal expansion<br>
coefficient and preservation of superior moldability.<br>
[0045]<br>
The content of the inorganic filler is preferably 5 to 120 parts by mass with respect to<br>
100 parts by mass of the total of the epoxy resin component (A), the phenolic curing<br>
agent component (B), the curing accelerator component (C) and the inorganic filler (D),<br>
for preservation of superior moldability and sufficient reduction of thermal expansion<br>
coefficient.<br>
[0046]<br>
The epoxy resin composition in the present embodiment can be prepared by blending<br>
the various components and agitating the mixture uniformly, for example, in a mixer or<br>
blender.<br>
[0047]<br>
An epoxy resin composition varnish is prepared by dissolving or dispersing the obtained<br>
epoxy resin composition in a solvent.<br>
[0048]<br>
Examples of the solvents include methylethylketone, methoxypropanol, cyclohexanone,<br>
and the like. These solvents may be used alone or in combination of two or more.<br>
Particularly among the solvents above, a solvent containing cyclohexanone in an<br>
amount of 20 mass % or more is preferable, because there is less surface irregularity<br>
caused by resins on the surface of the prepreg produced, and thus, a surface-smooth<br>
prepreg is obtained.<br>
[0049]<br>
Impregnation of a substrate for prepreg (prepreg-forming substrate) with the resin<br>
varnish prepared and subsequent drying of the substrate under heat in a dryer at 150 to<br>
180°C for 2 to 10 minutes gives a prepreg in the semi-cured state (B stage).<br>
[0050]<br>
Typical examples of the prepreg-forming substrates include glass fiber cloths such as<br>
glass fabric, glass paper and glass mat, and also, Kraft paper, linter paper, natural fiber<br>
fabrics, organic fiber fabrics, and the like.<br><br>
[0051]<br>
The content of the resin composition in the prepreg is preferably 35 to 80 mass %.<br>
[0052]<br>
A metal clad laminate is prepared by laminating a particular number of the prepregs<br>
thus obtained, placing a metal foil additionally on at least one outermost layer and<br>
molding the composite under heat and pressure.<br>
[0053]<br>
As for the heat pressure-molding condition, the temperature is for example 160 to 180°C,<br>
the molding pressure is 1.5 to 4.0 MPa and the molding time is 30 to 120 minutes.<br>
Heating and pressurization under such a condition gives a metal clad laminate used for<br>
production of printed wiring boards and others.<br>
[0054]<br>
Examples of the metal foils for use include copper foil, aluminum foil, stainless steel foil,<br>
and the like.<br>
[0055]<br>
A circuit pattern is formed on the surface of the metal clad laminate thus obtained by<br>
leaving circuit pattern-forming regions and removing the other regions thereof by a<br>
known circuit-forming method, such as etching by subtractive process. In this way, a<br>
printed wiring board carrying a circuit on the surface is prepared.<br>
[0056]<br>
The printed wiring board obtained can be used as an internal-layer circuit board.<br>
[0057]<br>
A multilayer printed wiring board is prepared by laminating a particular number of the<br>
prepreg on one or both sides of the internal-layer circuit board and a metal foil<br>
additionally thereon and molding the composite under heat and pressure. A multilayer<br>
printed wiring board carrying a circuit on the surface is prepared by forming a circuit<br>
pattern on the metal foil of the surface layer of the multilasrer printed wiring board, for<br>
example, by subtractive process.<br>
[0058]<br>
The multilayer printed wiring board thus obtained is superior in heat resistance and<br>
also in reliability, because the interlayer adhesiveness is higher.<br>
[0059]<br><br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in more detail with reference to<br>

A glass cloth (product of Nitto Boseki Co., Ltd., "2116 Type Cloth") was impregnated<br>
with the resin varnish at room temperature. It was then heated at approximately 130 to<br>
170°C for removal of the solvent in the varnish, and the resin composition was<br>
semi-cured, to give a prepreg. The amount of the resin in the prepreg was adjusted to<br>
100 parts by mass with respect to 100 parts by mass of the glass cloth. The properties of<br>
the prepreg obtained were determined by the following evaluation tests.<br>
[0070]<br>
[Moldability l]<br>
Four prepregs obtained (340 mm x510 mm) were held and laminated between<br>
surface-roughened faces of two copper foils (thickness- 35 um, JTC foil, product of Nikko<br>
Gould Foil Co., Ltd.), to give a prepreg laminate sheet. The prepreg laminate sheet was<br>
then molded under heat and pressure, to give a copper foil-laminated sheet for printed<br>
wiring board. The heating/pressurization condition then was a mold temperature of<br>
170°C, an applied pressure of 2.94 MPa, and a pressurized period of 90 minutes. During<br>
heat pressure molding, the number of the sheets molded on the stage was 20.<br>
[0071]<br>
The copper foil on the copper foil-laminated sheet obtained was removed by etching. The<br>
thickness of the copper foil-laminated sheet after removal of the copper foil was<br>
determined at any 9 points on the surface with a micrometer. Presence of voids on the<br>
surface was also evaluated by visual observation. The range of the gel time of a void-free<br>
prepreg having a difference between maximum and minimum thickness of 0.05 mm or<br>
less was determined. A wider range of gel time is considered that the moldability is<br>
better.<br>
[0072]<br>
[Moldability 2]<br>
The internal-layer circuit board used was an internal-layer circuit board (product of<br>
Matsushita Electric Works, Ltd., "CR1766": copper foil thickness: 35 μm) having a<br>
thickness of 0.2 mm that is blackened and carries an copper foil with a lattice-like<br>
pattern formed on both surfaces (circuit width: 1 mm, circuit interval: 2 mm). A prepreg<br>
was placed on both surfaces of the internal-layer circuit board and additionally a copper<br>
foil thereon, to give a multilayer laminate sheet. The multilayer laminate sheet was<br>
molded under heat and pressure, to give a multilayer printed wiring board. The<br>
condition of the heat pressure molding was a mold temperature of 170°C, an applied<br>
pressure of 2.94 MPa, and a pressurized period of 90 minutes. The number of the<br>
molded sheets on the stage during heat pressure molding was 20.<br><br>
[0073]<br>
The copper foil on the copper foil-laminated sheet obtained was removed by etching. The<br>
thickness of the copper foil-laminated sheet after removal of the copper foil was<br>
determined with a micrometer, at any 30 points on the surface where the lattice-like<br>
pattern is formed. Presence of voids on the surface was also evaluated by visual<br>
observation. The range of the gel time of a void-free prepreg having a difference between<br>
maximum and minimum thickness of 0.05 mm or less was determined. A wider range of<br>
gel time is considered that the moldability is better.<br>
[0074]<br>
[Interlayer adhesive strength: adhesion strength at the resin interface]<br>
A glass cloth in the copper foil-laminated sheet obtained in the "moldability 1" test was<br>
peeled off, for determination of its 90° peel strength (JIS C6481).<br>
[0075]<br>
[Copper foil adhesive strength: adhesion strength at the interface between copper foil<br>
and resin]<br>
A copper foil in the copper foil-laminated sheet obtained in the "moldability 1" test was<br>
peeled off, for determination of its 90° peel strength (JIS C6481).<br>
[0076]<br>
[Oven heat-resistance temperature]<br>
A copper foil-laminated sheet having a thickness of approximately 0.4 mm was prepared<br>
in a similar manner to the copper foil-laminated sheet obtained in the "moldability 1"<br>
test. The copper foil"laminated sheet obtained was heated in an oven set to various<br>
temperatures respectively for 60 minutes. The oven heat-resistance temperature is the<br>
maximum temperature at which there is no expansion or separation of the copper<br>
foil-laminated sheet after heating.<br>
[0077]<br>
[Thermal decomposition temperature]<br>
A resin was separated from a molded copper foil-laminated sheet and analyzed in a<br>
thermogravimetric and differential thermal analyzer (TG-DTA). The programmed<br>
heating rate was 5°C/minute. The thermal decomposition temperature was a<br>
temperature at which the weight of the sample decreased by 5% from the initial weight.<br>
[0078]<br>
[Glass transition temperature]<br>
The glass transition temperature (Tg) of a multilayer printed wiring board obtained was<br><br>
determined by the TMA method (thermo mechanical analysis) specified in JIS C6481.<br>
[0079]<br>
[Thermal expansion coefficient (CTE)]<br>
The thermal expansion coefficient in the board thickness direction of a multilayer<br>
printed wiring board obtained was determined at a temperature of Tg or lower by the<br>
TMA method (thermo-mechanical analysis) specified in JIS C6481.<br>
[0080]<br>
[Prepreg surface irregularity by resin: resin smoothness]<br>
The surface of each prepreg obtained was observed visually, for evaluation of the surface<br>
smoothness and the resin deposition unevenness. A prepreg with favorable surface<br>
smoothness was designated as "good", while that with more uneven surface, "bad".<br>
[0081]<br>
[Drill abrasion resistance]<br>
A copper foil-laminated sheet having a thickness of approximately 0.4 mm was prepared<br>
in a similar manner to the copper foil-laminated sheet obtained in the "moldability 1"<br>
test. Five copper foil-laminated sheet obtained were laminated and used for 3000-hit<br>
drill processing with a drill, and the abrasion wear of the drill was examined.<br>
[0082]<br>
As for the criteria for evaluation of the drill abrasion wear, when the initial blade area<br>
at the edge of the drill is expressed as 100%, an abraded blade area after 3000-hit drill<br>
processing of less than 40% was judged "good", that of less than 50% and 40% or more,<br>
"normal", and that of 50% or more, "bad".<br>
[0083]<br>
[Flame resistance]<br>
The flame resistance of a molded laminated sheet was evaluated by the method<br>
specified in UL Standard.<br>
[0084]<br>
[Varnish transparency]<br>
The transparency of a varnish was evaluated by visual observation. A highly<br>
transparent varnish was judged "good", a slightly opaque varnish as "normal", and an<br>
opaque varnish, as "bad".<br>
[0085]<br>
Test results of the test items above are summarized in Tables 1 to 3.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
[0089]<br>
The results in Tables 1 and 2 show that the prepregs of Examples 1 to 21 are superior<br>
both in adhesiveness and heat resistance.<br>
[0090]<br>
Specifically, the test results of the interlayer adhesiveness and the copper foil<br>
adhesiveness of the prepregs of Examples 1 to 21 were all high at 1.0 kN/m or more, and<br>
the oven heat-resistance temperatures thereof are 250°C or higher.<br>
[0091]<br>
On the other hand the test results of the prepregs of Comparative Examples 1 to 4,<br>
which did not contain the epoxy resin (A-l) having oxazolidone rings and bromine atoms<br>
in the same molecule but contains a phenolic curing agent (B) as curing agent and an<br>
imidazole silane compound (CM) as accelerator, shown in Table 3 show that the oven<br>
heat resistances was high at 280°C and the heat resistance was also high, but the<br>
interlayer adhesiveness was low at 0.7 to 0.8 kN/m and also, the adhesiveness was low.<br>
[0092]<br>
In addition, the prepreg of Comparative Example 5, which did not contain the epoxy<br>
resin (A_l) but contained dicyandiamide as curing agent, had a high interlayer<br>
adhesiveness of 1.3 kN/m but also a very low oven heat-resistance temperature of<br>
235°C.<br>
[0093]<br>
Further, the prepregs of Comparative Examples 6 to 7, which contained the epoxy resin<br>
(A-l) and a phenol resin as curing agent, but did not contain an imidazole-silane<br>
compound (C-l), had a low interlayer adhesiveness of 0.9 kN/m.<br>
[0094]<br>
Further, the prepregs of Comparative Examples 8 and 9, which contained the epoxy<br>
resin (A-l) but not the phenol resin as curing agent, had a low oven heat resistance of<br>
225 to 230°C.<br>
[0095]<br>
As described above, prepregs superior both in adhesiveness and heat resistance could be<br>
obtained in Examples 1 to 21, in which an epoxy resin composition containing the epoxy<br>
resin (A-l), the phenol resin (B-l), and imidazole-silane compound (C-l) (C) was used.<br>
[0096]<br>
As described above in detail, an aspect of the present invention is an epoxy resin<br><br>
composition for printed wiring board, characterized by including (A) an epoxy resin<br>
component containing an epoxy resin (A-l) having nitrogen and bromine atoms in the<br>
same molecule, (B) a phenolic curing agent component containing a phenol resin (B_l),<br>
and (C) a curing accelerator component containing an imidazole-silane compound (Ol).<br>
The epoxy resin (A'l) having nitrogen and bromine atoms in the same molecule, which<br>
is a resin component relatively higher in polarity, is superior in adhesiveness to<br>
substrates such as glass cloth and metal foils. Combined use of the epoxy resin (A'l) and<br>
the imidazole-silane compound (CM) raises the adhesiveness of the prepreg further. It is<br>
also possible to preserve favorable heat resistance by using a phenolic curing agent<br>
component (B) as curing agent component.<br>
[0097]<br>
The epoxy resin (A-l) is preferably a resin containing 1.9 to 2.8 epoxy groups in the<br>
molecule on average. The epoxy resin having such a number of epoxy groups is effective<br>
in improving the toughness and also the adhesiveness of the resulting prepreg.<br>
[0098]<br>
In addition, the epoxy resin (A-l) is preferably an epoxy resin having oxazolidone rings<br>
and bromine atoms in the same molecule. The epoxy resin having oxazolidone rings and<br>
bromine atoms in the same molecule is effective in raising the glass transition point<br>
(Tg) of the epoxy resin component and thus in improving the heat resistance.<br>
[0099]<br>
The epoxy resin composition for printed wiring board preferably contains bromine<br>
atoms in an amount of 10 mass % or more, with respect to the total amount of the epoxy<br>
resin component (A), the phenolic curing agent component (B) and the curing<br>
accelerator component (C).<br>
[0100]<br>
Also in the epoxy resin composition for printed wiring board, the content of the epoxy<br>
resin (A-l) in the epoxy resin component (A) is preferably 20 to 80 mass %. Favorably if<br>
the content is in the range above, the epoxy resin composition is superior in the balance<br>
of adhesiveness and heat resistance.<br>
[0101]<br>
Preferably in the epoxy resin composition for printed wiring board, the phenol resin<br>
(B-l) contains a bisphenol A novolak resin. The bisphenol A novolak resin, if contained<br>
in the phenol resin (B-l), improves the toughness and also the adhesiveness of the<br>
resulting prepreg.<br><br>
[0102]<br>
Also favorably in the epoxy resin composition for printed wiring board, the phenolic<br>
curing agent component (B) contains bisphenol A. Presence of bisphenol A improve the<br>
moldability further.<br>
[0103]<br>
Preferably in the epoxy resin composition for printed wiring board, the content of the<br>
imidazole-silane compound (Ol) is preferably 0.05 to 2 mass % in the total amount of<br>
the epoxy resin component (A), the phenolic curing agent component (B) and the curing<br>
accelerator component (C). The imidazole-silane compound (CM), if contained in an<br>
amount in the range above, allows preservation of the favorable adhesiveness and heat<br>
resistance at the same time.<br>
[0104]<br>
The epoxy resin composition for printed wiring board preferably contains an inorganic<br>
filler (D) additionally. Addition of the inorganic filler is effective in giving a prepreg<br>
having a lower thermal expansion coefficient and higher heat resistance.<br>
[0105]<br>
Favorably in the epoxy resin composition for printed wiring board, the inorganic filler<br>
(D) contains a spherical inorganic filler. Such a resin give a prepreg superior in<br>
moldability and also heat resistance.<br>
[0106]<br>
Also favorably in the epoxy resin composition for printed wiring board, the inorganic<br>
filler (D) contains aluminum hydroxide. The epoxy resin preferably contains aluminum<br>
hydroxide as the inorganic filler (D), because abrasion of a drill, when used in drill<br>
processing of produced printed wiring board, is lower.<br>
[0107]<br>
Another aspect of the present invention is an epoxy resin composition varnish for<br>
printed wiring board, prepared by dissolving or dispersing the epoxy resin composition<br>
for printed wiring board in a solvent containing cyclohexanone in an amount of 20<br>
mass % or more. It is possible to obtain a prepreg resistant to generation of the<br>
irregularity on the prepreg surface causes by resin deposition by using a solvent<br>
containing cyclohexanone in an amount of 20% or more in preparation of the varnish.<br>
[0108]<br>
Yet another aspect of the present invention is a prepreg, produced by impregnating a<br>
prepreg-forming substrate with the epoxy resin composition varnish for printed wiring<br><br>
board and drying the resulting substrate. Such a prepreg is superior in adhesiveness to<br>
substrates such as glass cloth and metal foils and also in heat resistance, and thus the<br>
printed wiring board obtained with such a prepreg is higher in reliability.<br>
[0109]<br>
Yet another aspect of the present invention is a metal clad laminate for printed wiring<br>
board, produced by laminating a particular number of the prepregs and a metal foil<br>
additionally on at least one outermost layer and heat pressure-molding the formed<br>
prepreg laminate sheet. In the metal clad laminate thus obtained, the prepregs and also<br>
the prepreg and the metal foil are bonded to each other by large adhesive strength.<br>
[0110]<br>
Yet another aspect of the present invention is a printed wiring board, produced by<br>
forming a particular circuit pattern on the surface metal foil on the metal clad laminate<br>
above. Such a printed wiring board is a substrate superior in the adhesiveness and heat<br>
resistance and higher in reliability, and used favorably in production of multilayer<br>
printed wiring boards.<br>
[0111]<br>
Yet another aspect of the present invention is a multilayer printed wiring board,<br>
produced by heat pressure-molding a multilayer laminate sheet including the prepregs<br>
and/or the printed wiring board according to Claim 15 containing the prepregs and the<br>
printed wiring boards. Such a multilayer printed wiring board is superior in heat<br>
resistance and also in interlayer adhesiveness and thus, shows high reliability.<br><br>
