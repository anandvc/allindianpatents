METHOD FOR HAVING LASER LIGHT SOURCE IN STANDBY STATUS<br>
Technical field<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a method of causing standby (including a method of turning ON and OFF at a high speed) of a<br>
laser light source that uses optical fiber amplifiers to perform light<br>
amplification of laser light generated from semiconductor lasers and<br>
then the forms deep ultraviolet light by means of a wavelength<br>
conversion optical system that uses wavelength conversion elements.<br>
Background art<br>
[0002]<br>
Laser light has been used for a variety of applications in recent<br>
years, for example, it performs metal cutting and processing, it is<br>
used as the light source of photolithography apparatuses in<br>
semiconductor fabrication apparatuses, it is used in various<br>
measuring apparatuses, and it is used in medical operation and<br><br>
treatment apparatuses such as in surgery, ophthalmology and<br>
dentistry.<br>
[0003]<br>
In the case in which a solid state laser (in the present<br>
specification, a semiconductor laser (used as a concept that includes<br>
diode lasers)) is used as such a laser light source, the wavelength of<br>
the laser light that is emitted from the solid state laser is from the<br>
visible range to the infrared range, and a method of directly<br><br>
generating ultraviolet light has not been established. For example, it<br>
is not suitable for use in inspecting apparatuses, since the<br>
wavelength is too long. Therefore, a method of using such long<br>
wavelength light emitted from a solid state laser by converting it into<br>
a deep ultraviolet light of a short wavelength (for example, an eighth<br>
harmonic: wavelength of 193 nm) by using nonlinear optical crystals<br>
has been developed, for example, as described in Japanese Patent<br>
Application Publication No. 2001-353176 (Patent Document 1). BBO<br><br>
crystals, LBO crystals and CLBO crystals are known nonlinear<br>
optical crystals used for such a purpose.<br>
[0004]<br>
In an such a laser light source, for example, in general, laser<br>
light generated from a DFB-LD is amplified using a plurality of<br>
optical fiber amplifiers (FDFA) and is then made into deep ultraviolet<br>
light by means of a wavelength conversion optical system such as the<br>
above.<br>
Patent Document l: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application<br>
Publication No. 2001-353176<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Problems to Be Solved by the Invention<br>
[0005]<br>
Optical fiber amplifiers used for such a purpose, particularly<br>
optical fiber amplifiers that amplify light with a wavelength of 1.55<br>
µm to which Er has been added, generate a large amount of heat<br><br>
during high output operations. In addition, when such optical fiber<br>
amplifiers are turned ON and OFF, large temperature changes are<br>
generated, and, at such times, various unstable statuses are caused.<br>
When such optical fiber amplifiers are used in compact packages, the<br>
temperature of the housing increases due to the heat generation of<br>
the optical fiber amplifiers of subsequent stages of high output<br>
operations, and, in conjunction with this, the temperatures of optical<br>
fiber of the preceding stages of low output operation, in which heat<br>
generation is not performed, also increase. When the temperature of<br>
the optical fiber increases, in conjunction with this, the status of<br>
polarization of the light output from the optical fiber amplifiers<br>
changes. When the status of polarization changes, there is a problem<br>
in that the conversion efficiency in the wavelength conversion optical<br>
system, into which the output from the optical fiber amplifiers is<br>
input, changes, and the laser output light ultimately obtained<br>
fluctuates.<br><br>
[0006]<br>
Therefore, conventionally, a method has been employed in<br>
which, before usage of such a laser light source starts, a warm up of a<br>
considerable time is performed, thermal equilibrium is established,<br>
fluctuation of the laser output light ultimately obtained is held<br>
within an allowable range and then usage is started. However, there<br>
are cases in which approximately 24 hours would be necessary until<br>
thermal equilibrium is established, and that length of time has been<br>
a problem.<br>
[0007]<br>
As a countermeasure for this, a method in which the laser light<br>
source is always put into the output status even while the output<br>
light from the laser light source is not being used is conceivable.<br>
However, when the laser light source is put into an ON status, the<br>
wavelength conversion elements, which are used in the deep<br>
ultraviolet light generating portion, or optical elements such as a<br><br>
lenses are damaged, so there is a problem in that maintaining an<br>
output status until the time when output light is not used is linked to<br>
shortening of the lifespan of the laser light source. As another<br>
countermeasure, blocking the laser light using a mechanical shutter<br>
before light from the optical fiber amplifiers enters the wavelength<br>
conversion optical system is conceivable. However, in this case, the<br>
thermal equilibrium of the wavelength conversion optical system<br>
breaks down, and, as a result, there is a problem in that fluctuation<br>
of the laser output light ultimately obtained cannot be avoided.<br>
[0008]<br>
The present invention takes such circumstances into account<br>
and has as its problem the provision of a laser light source standby<br>
method that is able to optically amplify laser light generated from<br>
laser oscillating parts using optical fiber amplifiers and then shorten<br>
the start up time of a laser light source that performs wavelength<br>
conversion by means of a wavelength conversion optical system that<br><br>
uses wavelength conversion elements, as well as a method of turning<br>
ON and OFF at a higher speed.<br>
Means to Solve Problems<br>
[0009]	<br>
The first means for solving the above problems is a laser light<br>
source standby method that causes standby of a laser light source<br>
that performs wavelength conversion of laser light generated from<br>
laser oscillating parts by means of a wavelength conversion optical<br>
system that uses wavelength conversion elements; characterized in<br>
that it reduces the wavelength conversion efficiencies of the<br>
wavelength conversion elements during standby.<br>
[0010]<br>
When the wavelength conversion efficiencies of the wavelength<br>
conversion elements are reduced, there is a reduction in the output of<br>
the converted frequency light that is generated, and, particularly,<br>
deep ultraviolet light is hardly generated at all any longer. Therefore,<br><br>
there comes to be extremely little damaging of the wavelength<br>
conversion elements by deep ultraviolet light. In changing the laser<br>
light source from a standby status to a usage status, a usage status is<br>
promptly set by returning the wavelength conversion efficiencies of<br>
the wavelength conversion elements to their original settings.<br>
[0011]<br>
Note that, in the present specification and the Scope of Patent<br>
Claims, "reduces the wavelength conversion efficiencies of the<br>
wavelength conversion elements" is used with a meaning that<br>
includes the case in which they become completely 0.<br>
[0012]<br>
The second means for solving the above problems is the first<br>
means; characterized in that the wavelength-converted laser light is<br>
deep ultraviolet light.<br>
[0013]<br><br>
The third means for solving the above problems is the first<br>
means; characterized in that the method of reducing the wavelength<br>
conversion efficiencies of the wavelength conversion elements is<br>
setting the temperature that controls the oscillation wavelength of at<br>
least one of semiconductor lasers that comprise the laser oscillating<br>
parts to a temperature that differs from the temperature of the case<br>
in which the laser light source is always being used.<br>
[0014]<br>
Note that, in the present specification and the Scope of Patent<br>
Claims, "the laser light source is always being used" refers to the<br>
desired laser light being output from the laser light source.<br>
[0015]<br>
During standby, when the temperatures of the semiconductor<br>
lasers are temperatures different from the temperatures in a case in<br>
which the laser light source is always being used, the wavelengths of<br>
the laser light (fundamental harmonic) generated from the<br><br>
semiconductor lasers change. Even if this is done, the output of the<br>
optical fiber amplifiers is maintained to be nearly constant and<br>
enters the wavelength conversion optical system, so thermal<br>
equilibrium of the optical fiber amplifiers and the wavelength<br>
conversion optical system is maintained at the same level as when a<br>
laser light source is used. The output from the optical fiber<br>
amplifiers is sent as-is to the wavelength conversion optical system,<br>
but wavelength conversion efficiencies drop due to the wavelengths<br>
being different, and, particularly, deep ultraviolet light is hardly<br>
generated at all any longer. Therefore, there comes to be extremely<br>
little damaging of the wavelength conversion elements by deep<br>
ultraviolet light. In the case in which there is a shift from a standby<br>
status to a usage status, the temperatures of the semiconductor<br>
lasers should be returned to their original settings. Temperature<br>
changes need only be slight, and the thermal capacities of the<br><br>
semiconductor lasers are small, so the shift from standby to a usage<br>
status is promptly performed.<br>
[0016]<br>
The fourth means for solving the above problems is the first<br>
means; characterized in that the method of reducing the wavelength<br>
conversion efficiencies of the wavelength conversion elements is to<br>
make the temperature of at least one of the temperature-controlled<br>
wavelength conversion elements among the wavelength conversion<br>
elements temperature that differs from the temperature in the case<br>
in which the laser light source is always being used.<br>
[0017]<br>
When the laser light source is set to a standby status, the<br>
temperatures of the wavelength conversion elements are changed<br>
from the temperature when the laser light source is always being<br>
used. By doing so, the phase matching status of the wavelength<br>
conversion elements breaks down, wavelength conversion efficiency<br><br>
drops, and, particularly, deep ultraviolet light is hardly generated at<br>
all. Therefore, there comes to be extremely little damaging of the<br>
wavelength conversion elements by deep ultraviolet light. In the case<br>
in which there is a shift from a standby status to a usage status, the<br>
temperatures of the wavelength conversion.elements should be<br>
returned to their original settings. Temperature changes need only be<br>
slight, and the thermal capacities of the wavelength conversion<br>
elements are small, so the shift from standby to the usage status is<br>
promptly performed. Particularly, it is preferable that the<br>
temperatures of the temperature phase matching crystal used in<br>
preceding stages of the wavelength conversion optical system be<br>
changed.<br>
[0018]<br>
The fifth means for solving the above problems is the first<br>
means; characterized in that the wavelength conversion elements are<br>
nonlinear optical crystals, and the method of reducing the<br><br>
wavelength conversion efficiencies of the wavelength conversion'<br>
elements is to make the angle formed by the crystal axes of the<br>
nonlinear optical crystals and the optical axis an angle that differs<br>
from the angle in the case in which the laser light source is always<br>
being used.<br>
[0019]<br>
The sixth means of solving the above problems is the first<br>
means; characterized in that the laser light source is one that<br>
optically amplifies laser light using optical fiber amplifiers.<br>
[0020]<br>
The seventh means for solving the above problems is a method<br>
of causing standby of a laser light source that forms deep ultraviolet<br>
light from laser light generated from a plurality of laser oscillating<br>
parts by means of a wavelength conversion optical system that uses<br>
wavelength conversion elements; characterized in that, during<br>
standby, the relative relationship of the timing of the pulsed laser<br><br>
light generated from the respective laser oscillating parts is shifted<br>
from the relative relationship in the case in which the laser light<br>
source is always being used.<br>
[0021]<br>
In a laser light source that forms deep ultraviolet light from<br>
laser light generated from a plurality of laser oscillating parts by<br>
means of a wavelength conversion optical system that uses<br>
wavelength conversion elements, wavelength conversion is performed<br>
by matching the phases of the pulsed laser light generated from these<br>
respective laser oscillating parts to the same optical axis and causing<br>
them to be incident to the wavelength conversion elements. Therefore,<br>
when the relationship of the timing of pulses generated from the<br>
respective laser oscillating parts is shifted from the timing in the<br>
case in which these laser light sources are always being used, the<br>
phases thereof no longer match, the conversion efficiencies of the<br>
wavelength conversion elements drop, and, particularly, deep<br><br>
ultraviolet light is hardly generated at all any longer. In the case in<br>
which there is a shift from a standby status to a usage status, it is<br>
possible to extremely promptly shift to a usage status by making the<br>
phases match.<br>
[0022]<br>
Note that, in the present means, control is performed by<br>
shifting the timing of the pulses generated from the laser oscillating<br>
parts, so control on the nsec order is possible. Therefore, the time of<br>
the "standby" status can be made extremely short, and the concept<br>
includes time on the nsec order, for example. Therefore, through the<br>
present means, turning ON and OFF in pulsed units, generation of<br>
any pulse pattern, and control of pulse energy become possible.<br>
[0023]<br>
The eighth means of solving the above problems is the seventh<br>
means; characterized in that the laser oscillating parts have<br>
semiconductor lasers and electrooptical elements (EOMs), and the<br><br>
relative relationship of the timing of the pulsed laser light generated<br>
from the respective laser oscillating parts is the relative relationship<br>
of the pulsed laser light generated from the semiconductor lasers or<br>
the relative relationship of the timing of the pulsqd laser light pulse-<br>
extracted by the EOMs.<br>
[0024]<br>
The ninth means for solving the above problems is the seventh<br>
means! characterized in that the laser light source is one that<br>
optically amplifies the respective laser lights using optical fiber<br>
amplifiers provided to correspond to the respective laser oscillators.<br>
Effects of the Invention<br>
[0025]<br>
Through the present invention, it is possible to provide a laser<br>
light source standby method that optically amplifies laser light<br>
generated from the laser oscillating parts using optical fiber<br>
amplifiers and then shortens start up time of a laser light source that<br><br>
performs wavelength conversion by means of a wavelength conversion<br>
optical system that uses wavelength conversion elements, as well as a<br>
method of turning ON and OFF at a higher speed.<br>

Preferred Embodiment of the Present Invention<br>
[0028]<br>
Examples of embodiments of the present invention will be<br>
described below using drawings. Figure 1 is a drawing that describes<br>
the standby method of a laser light source that is an embodiment of<br>
the present invention, and it is a drawing that shows an overview of<br>
the laser light source.<br>
[0029]<br>
Laser light (fundamental harmonic) emitted from a first<br>
semiconductor laser 1 (DFB-LD) is amplified by a first optical fiber<br>
amplifier 2 (FDFA) and is incident to a wavelength conversion optical<br><br>
system. The light that has entered the wavelength conversion optical<br>
system is, first, condensed to a second harmonic generator 4<br>
»<br>
comprised of LBO by means of a condenser lens 3, and a second<br>
harmonic is generated from second harmonic generator 4 along with<br>
the fundamental harmonic. These lights are condensed to a third<br>
harmonic generator 6 comprised of LBO by means of a condenser lens<br>
5, and a third harmonic is generated from third harmonic generator 6<br>
along with a second harmonic. These lights are condensed to a fifth<br>
harmonic generator 8 comprised of BBO by means of a condenser lens<br>
7, and a fifth harmonic is generated from a fifth harmonic generator<br>
8.<br>
[0030]<br>
On the other hand, laser light (fundamental harmonic) emitted<br>
from a second semiconductor laser 9 (DFB-LD) is amplified by a<br>
second optical fiber amplifier 10 (FDFA) and is incident to a<br>
wavelength conversion optical system. The light that has entered the<br><br>
wavelength conversion optical system"is, first, condensed to a second<br>
harmonic generator 12 comprised of LBO via a mirror M by means of<br>
a condenser lens 11, and a second harmonic is generated from second<br>
harmonic generator 12 along with the fundamental harmonic. These<br>
lights pass through a condenser lens 13 and a dichroic mirror 14 and<br>
are condensed to a seventh harmonic generator 16 comprised of CLBO.<br>
First, a fifth harmonic generated from fifth harmonic generator 8<br>
passes through a condenser lens 15, is reflected by the dichroic<br>
mirror 14, and is converged to the seventh harmonic generator 16. A<br>
seventh harmonic is generated from seventh harmonic generator 16,<br>
but the fundamental harmonic that has entered seventh harmonic<br>
generator 16 along with a second harmonic passes through seventh<br>
harmonic generator 16 as-is, and a seventh harmonic and the<br>
fundamental harmonic are converged to an eighth harmonic<br>
generator 17 comprised of CLBO. An eighth harmonic is generated<br><br>
from eighth harmonic generator 17, and this becomes laser light<br>
source output.<br>
[0031]<br>
In the first embodiment, when such a laser light source is<br>
caused to standby, the temperatures of semiconductor laser 1 and<br>
semiconductor laser 9 are changed by approximately 3°C from the<br>
normal temperature (normal temperature is approximately room<br>
temperature) when laser light (eighth harmonic) is output from the<br>
laser light source (when the laser light source is being used).<br>
Semiconductor laser 1 and semiconductor laser 9 are respectively<br>
temperature-controlled by LD temperature controllers 18 and 19, so<br>
it is possible to easily achieve temperature changes by changing the<br>
set temperatures thereof. At a temperature change of approximately<br>
3°C, the wavelengths of the laser light generated from semiconductor<br>
lasers 1 and 9 change by approximately 0.3 nm. This change has<br>
hardly any effect on optical fiber amplifier 2 and optical fiber<br><br>
amplifier 10, but the conversion efficiencies in the respective<br>
wavelength conversion elements of the wavelength conversion optical<br>
system are changed, and, particularly, deep ultraviolet light is hardly<br>
generated at all any longer. Therefore, the wavelength conversion<br>
elements are no longer damaged even while the laser light has been<br>
made incident to the wavelength conversion optical system.<br>
[0032]<br>
When shifting from a standby status to a usage status (a status<br>
that outputs laser light (eighth harmonic)), the settings of LD<br>
temperature controllers 18 and 19 may be varied to return the<br>
temperatures of semiconductor laser 1 and semiconductor laser 9 to<br>
their original settings, but only approximately one minute or less is<br>
needed until the temperatures are returned to their original settings,<br>
so the warm up time can be set to one minute or less. Note that<br>
changing of the temperature during standby need not be for both<br><br>
semiconductor laser 1 and semiconductor laser 9, and there will be<br>
effects even with only either one of these.<br>
[0033]<br>
What extent of temperature change should be provided varies<br>
according to the wavelength conversion optical system, so, in the<br>
wavelength conversion optical system, temperature changes such that<br>
deep ultraviolet is no longer generated to the extent of becoming a<br>
problem should be experimentally determined and provided. In terms<br>
of shortening the warm up time, it is preferable to make the<br>
temperature change as small as possible.<br>
[0034]<br>
In the second embodiment, when such a laser light source is<br>
caused to standby, the temperatures of second harmonic generator 4,<br>
third harmonic generator 6 and second harmonic generator 12 are<br>
changed approximately 1°C from the temperature when the laser<br>
light source is always being used. Second harmonic generator 4, third<br><br>
harmonic generator 6 and second harmonic generator 12 are<br>
comprised of LBO, which is a temperature phase matching crystal,<br>
and they are used for making infrared light into visible light and for<br>
making visible light into visible light with a shorter wavelength.<br>
These wavelength conversion elements are temperature-controlled<br>
(normally 120°C ~ 150°C) by crystal temperature controllers 20, 21,<br>
so changing the temperature is easy (note that other wavelength<br>
conversion elements are also temperature-controlled, but drawings of<br>
the temperature controllers have been omitted).<br>
[0035]<br>
When the temperature is shifted by approximately 1°C, the<br>
phase matching statuses of these temperature phase matching<br>
crystals break down, and wavelength conversion efficiency drops.<br>
Therefore, generation of deep ultraviolet light greatly drops, and it is<br>
possible to prevent damage of wavelength conversion elements 16 and<br>
17, which handle deep ultraviolet light.<br><br>
[0036]<br>
When shifting from a standby status to an operation status, the<br>
settings of crystal temperature controllers 20 and 21 may be changed<br>
to return the temperatures of second harmonic generator 4, third<br>
harmonic generator 6 and second harmonic generator 12 to their<br>
original settings, but only approximately one minute or less is needed<br>
until the temperatures are returned to their original settings, so the<br>
warm up time can be set to one minute or less. Note that changing of<br>
the temperature during standby need not be for all of second<br>
harmonic generator 4, third harmonic generator 6 and second<br>
harmonic generator 12, and there will be effects even with only any<br>
one or two among these. Even if the temperature of the seventh<br>
harmonic generator 16 were changed, there would be effects to a<br>
certain extent. However, it is more effective to change the<br>
temperature of a harmonic generator of the most preceding stage<br>
possible.<br><br>
[0037]<br>
What extent of temperature change.should be provided varies<br>
according to the wavelength conversion optical system, so, in the<br>
wavelength conversion optical system, temperature changes such that<br>
deep ultraviolet is no longer generated to the extent of becoming a<br>
problem should be experimentally determined and provided. In terms<br>
of shortening the warm up time, it is preferable to make the<br>
temperature change as small as possible.<br>
[0038]<br>
In the third embodiment, when such a laser light source is<br>
caused to standby, the timing of the pulse generated from<br>
semiconductor laser 1 and the timing of the pulse generated from<br>
semiconductor laser 9 are shifted by shifting the output timing of a<br>
pulse generator 22 that supplies signals to the respective<br>
semiconductor lasers 1, 9. In the wavelength conversion optical<br>
system, with the timing at which a fifth harmonic formed from the<br><br>
fundamental harmonic generated from semiconductor laser 1 is<br>
reflected by the dichroic mirror 14 and is incident to seventh<br>
harmonic generator 16 and the timing at which the fundamental<br>
harmonic generated from semiconductor laser 9 and a second<br>
harmonic formed therefrom pass through the dichroic mirror 14 and<br>
are incident to seventh harmonic generator 16 being the same, a<br>
second harmonic and a fifth harmonic from among these are<br>
superposed, thereby generating a seventh harmonic with good<br>
efficiency. When the timing of the pulse generated from this<br>
semiconductor laser 1 and the timing of the pulse generated from<br>
semiconductor laser 9 are shifted from the usage moving, there is less<br>
rsuperposing of a second harmonic and a fifth harmonic or there is no<br>
longer superposing at all. Through this, the seventh harmonic<br>
generation efficiency drops, or a seventh harmonic is no longer<br>
generated. Therefore, deep ultraviolet light generation drops, and<br><br>
there is no damage to seventh harmonic generator 16 and eighth<br>
harmonic generator 17.<br>
[0039]<br>
In returning from a standby status to a usage status, the<br>
relative relationship of the pulse generation timing should be<br>
returned to its original setting, and it is possible to instantly return<br>
to a usage status. Figure 2 is a drawing that shows an eighth<br>
harmonic pulse waveform when the pulse generation timing has been<br>
shifted in this way. In this case, an eighth harmonic is generated at<br>
500 nsec intervals, but there is a place along the way in which one<br>
pulse is missing. This location is a location in which the relative<br>
relationship of the pulse generation timing has been shifted from a<br>
normal usage status. Specifically, in this case, it is understood that,<br>
at 500 nsec, there is a shift from a standby status to a usage status.<br>
In addition, if such a method is used, it is also possible to generate<br><br>
any pulse array pattern and to control the energy of the individual<br>
pulses.<br>
[0040]<br>
In addition, electrooptical elements (EOMs) may be respectively<br>
arranged in the vicinity of semiconductor laser 1 and semiconductor<br>
laser 9, and the timing of extracting pulsed laser lights of the<br>
electrooptical elements may also be relatively shifted in order to<br>
relatively shift the timing of the pulsed laser light generated from<br>
the respective electrooptical elements. The description relating to the<br>
wavelength conversion optical system in this case is similar to that of<br>
the third embodiment.<br>
[0041]<br>
In the above, descriptions have been given with respect to three<br>
embodiments, but the present invention is one that may be achieved<br>
if the wavelength conversion efficiencies of the wavelength<br>
conversion elements are reduced by any method. For example, in the<br><br>
case in which the wavelength conversion elements are nonlinear<br>
optical crystals, it is possible to realize the present invention even<br>
with a method such that the angle formed by the crystal axes thereof<br>
and the optical axis is changed.or such that the positional<br>
relationship of the respective elements of the wavelength conversion<br>
optical system is changed.<br><br>
We claim:<br>
1. A method of controlling a laser light source that generates, in an operation<br>
status, deep ultraviolet light from laser light generated from a plurality of laser<br>
oscillating parts (1, 9) by means of a wavelength conversion optical system that<br>
uses wavelength conversion elements (4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 17), characterized in that<br>
the method provides a standby status for the laser light source, during which the<br>
wavelength conversion efficiencies of the wavelength conversion elements are<br>
reduced compared to the operation status such that deep ultraviolet light is hardly<br>
generated at all any longer, wherein reducing the wavelength conversion<br>
efficiency during the standby status comprises:<br>
setting the temperature that controls the oscillation wavelength of<br>
at least one of a plurality of semiconductor lasers (1,9) that comprise the<br>
laser oscillating parts (1, 9) to a temperature that differs from the<br>
temperature of the respective semiconductor laser during the operation<br>
status, or<br>
setting the temperature of at least one of a plurality of<br>
temperature-controlled wavelength conversion elements among the<br>
wavelength conversion elements (4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 17) to a temperature that<br>
differs from the temperature of the respective temperature-controlled<br>
wavelength conversion element during the operation status, or<br>
making the angle formed by the crystal axes of nonlinear optical<br>
crystals acting as the wavelength conversion elements and the optical axis<br>
an angle that differs from the angle during the operation status, or<br>
shifting the relative relationship of the timing of the pulsed laser<br>
light generated from the respective laser oscillating parts (1,9) from the<br>
relative relationship during the operation status.<br>
2. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein reducing the wavelength<br>
conversion efficiency during the standby status comprises shifting the relative<br>
relationship of the timing of the pulsed laser light generated from the respective<br>
laser oscillating parts (1,9) from the relative relationship during the operation<br>
status, and wherein the laser oscillating parts (1,9) have semiconductor lasers (1,<br>
9) and electrooptical elements, and the relative relationship of the timing of the<br>
pulsed laser light generated from the respective laser oscillating parts is the<br>
relative relationship of the timing of the pulsed laser light generated from the<br>
semiconductor lasers or the relative relationship of the timing of the pulsed laser<br>
light pulse extracted by the electrooptical elements.<br><br><br>
METHOD FOR HAVING LASER LIGHT SOURCE IN STANDBY<br>
STATUS<br><br><br>
ABSTRACT<br><br>
When the laser light source is caused to standby, the temperatures of semiconductor laser 1<br>
and semiconductor laser 9 are changed by approximately 3°C from the temperature when<br>
the laser light source is always being used. With a temperature change of approximately<br>
3°C, the wavelength of the laser light generated by semiconductor lasers 1 and 9 change<br>
approximately 0.3 run. This change hardly has any effect at all on optical fiber amplifier 2<br>
and optical fiber amplifier 10, but the conversion efficiencies at the respective wavelength<br>
conversion elements of the wavelength conversion optical system change, and, particularly,<br>
deep ultraviolet light is hardly generated at all any longer. Therefore, even while the laser<br>
light has been made incident to the wavelength conversion optical system, there is no longer<br>
damaging of the wavelength conversion elements. Therefore, it is possible to provide a laser<br>
light source standby method that is able to shorten the start up time of the laser light source.</td>
