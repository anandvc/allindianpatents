				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a process for the preparation of a shelf-stable pre-cooked dal in the form of small granules/noodles which can be instantaneously converted into liquid or semiiliquid dal by addition and stirring with warm/hot water or even with tap water.<br>
Pulses (Dais) are the mainstay of the Indian vegetarian diet as a source of protein. These are traditionally prepared by washing, pre-soaking in excess water and or directly cooking by boiling for considerable periods or under pressure (15 psi) for 10-15 minutes. Such cooked dais get spoiled rapidly at room temperature and can be stored only for 2-3 days. To prevent spoilage and to make dal as quick-cooking, dehydration of cooked dais is practiced or dal is flaked prior to dehydration.<br>
In one of the process known in the art, for preparing quick-cooking dal or dal flakes, dal is soaked in water for 2-3 hours and pressure cooked for 10-15 minutes at pressure of 15-20 psi. Cooked dal is dehydrated by drying at 70°C-80°C in a hot air cabinet dryer or fluidized bed drier or in any other improved drier to a low moisture content of 508%. For preparation of dal flakes, dal is flaked before carrying out dehydration. The dried dal is seasoned with spices and mixed with vegetable fat and packed in polypropylene or other packaging materials.<br>
The disadvantage of the above process is that there is considerable case hardening case hardening due to migration of solubles to the surface of the dal.<br>
Another disadvantage of the process is that reconstitution of dehydrated dal is time-consuming requiring about 1-20 minutes of boiling for satisfactory reconstruction.<br>
Further disadvantage of the above known process is that hot water above 85°C is<br>
always necessary to reconstitute the dehydrated dal or dal flakes.<br>
In another process known in the art, dehydrated quick cooking dal is prepared by soaking the dal in a solution containing various salts such as sodium bicarbonate, sodium phosphate and sodium citrate. Dal after soaking is pressure cooked for 10-15 minutes in a conventional hot air drier. The dried dal is suitably seasoned and packed in pouches.<br>
The above-mentioned process has also the same disadvantages associated with the process described earlier. In addition this process has the further disadvantage that the salt treatment leads to adverse effect on taste, colour and flavour.<br>
The primary and the main object of the present invention is to propose a process for preparation of concentrate/mash out of cooked dal with or without spices.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose a process for preparation of pre-cooked dal concentrated/mash, which can be reconstituted, to liquid or semi-liquid by stirring with warm/hot water or even with tap water.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to propose a process for preparation of pre-cooked dal concentrate/mash, which is shelf-stable for several months.<br>
Further object of the invention is to propose a process which leads to pre-cooked dal concentrate/mash which for reconstitution into liquid or semi-liquid dal, does not require hot water at temperature of 80-90°C which is required in the known processes.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to propose a process for preparation of pre-cooked dal concentrate/mash which can be instantly reconstituted as compared to the known process which require 15-20 minutes of boiling for satisfactory reconstitution.<br>
These and other objects and advantages of the present invention would be more clearly understood from the ensuing description<br>
According to this invention there is provided a process for the preparation of shelf-stable pre-cooked dal in the form of soft small granules/noodles which can be instantly converted into liquid/semi liquid dal by stirring with warm/hot water or even with tap water comprising soaking the dal in the water, cooking said soaked dal under steam pressure characterized in that salt and acidulant as herein described being mixed with said cooked dal, subjecting said mix to the step of homogenisation and packing, and then subjecting said packets to the step of heat treatment at a temperature of 80-90°C.<br>
In accordance with the process proposed in this invention, pre-cooked readily reconstitutionable dal concentrate/mash is prepared by first cooking the soaked dal under steam pressure of for example 15 psi. The cooked dal is mixed with sodium chloride, acidulant<br>
like acetic acid, tartaric acid or citric acid. The mass is made homogenous by passing it through a food mincer using 4mm die. sieve plate. This act of mincing renders the cooked mass homogenous with respect to the added food ingredients and presents the product, in the form of short noodles or granules. The extruded product is then asceptically filled into pre--ster.il ised polyethylene bags or laminated flexible pouches which are then heat sealed,, A small sealed sachet of mixed spices, tossed in vegetable fat, is included in the main pack or dal concentrate and spices mixture can be packed in two different compartments of the same pack. To enhance further the shelf life of the product,, the iil I e d a. n d s e a 1 e d b a g s a r e s u b. j e c t e d to a t e m p e r a t u r e o f 85 C for 10 minutes in a hot air oven or a microwave oven. The product obtained is soft and crushable and readily disperses in water at any temperature. The moist. dal granules with or without spices can be instantly reconstituted by stirring in water at any t e m p e r a t u r e . R e h y d r a t i. o n c a. n also be d o n e w i t. h i n t h e p 1 a s t i c p o u c h b y i. n t r o d u c ing m e a s u r e d a m o u n t o f w a t e r ,, 2 times the weight of dal, and gently pressing the pouch between fingers and shaking the contents. The product<br>
can be also be used for many other dal based preparations. The process is one of the most convenient method to obtain a homogenous dal base for quick preparation into liquid or semi-liquid dal.<br>
Specifically., the process for the preparation of pre-cooked dal concentrate/mash comprises in the step of cleaning and washing the dal and soaking it in water for in the presence or absence of sodium salt*<br>
The? soaked dal is cooked under steam pressure of for example 15 psi for a pre-determined time.<br>
The cooked dal obtained of step (b) is mixed with sodium chloride and acidulant like acetic acid, t a r t a r i. c a c i d o r- c e t r i. c a c i. d „<br>
The mass obtained by step (c) is homogenized by passing it through a food mincer having, for example, 4mm dia sieve plate.<br>
The extruded product obtained by step (d) is f i lied int. o p r e—s t e r i 1 i. s e d p o 1. y e t h y 1 e n e or pa p e r— aluminium foil polyethylene laminated iPFP) bags.<br>
Mixed spices with vegetable fat is filled in a small sachet and sealed.<br><br>
The small sachet obtained by (f) is incorporated into the main pack obtained by step (e) and sealed.<br>
The  whole  packet is subjected  to  a  post.	<br>
packing heat treatment to 30-90 C preferably at 85 C in a hot air oven or in a microwave oven for about 10 minutes. This is an optional treatment to further increase the shelf life.<br>
This  invention will now be illustrated  with the   fallowing   example  which  is  intended   to   be specific,   example without limiting, in any way, on the scope of the present invention. EXAMPLE<br>
10 kg of dal is soaked in 2O 1 of water to obtain approximate moisture content of 487.. The soaked dal is pressure cooked at 15 psi. The cooked dal is extruded throuh 8mm hole disc in a meat mincer (Hobart type) for homogenisation„ The extruded dal is mixed with ingredients like salt and acetic acid (fat and spices are optional) and re-extruded through a perforated disc (hole dia 4mm),, It is packed and sealed. A post-packing heat, treatment is given briefly<br>
by  holding  the pouches at 80-85°C  for  5-10  minutes. Sachets  of spice mix if not homogenised with  dal  mash may  be introduced into the main pack before sealing  or the  two could be packed in 2 different  compartments  of the same packet.<br>
It is to be understood that the process of the proposed invention is susceptible to considerable rnodificationsAadaptations by those skilled in the art, such modifications are intended to be within the scope of the present invention which is set forth with by the claims,<br><br><br><br><br><br>
