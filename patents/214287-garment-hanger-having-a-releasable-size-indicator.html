				<td>GARMENT HANGER HAVING A REMOVABLE SIZE INDICATOR<br>
The present invention relates generally to a garment<br>
hanger of the type having a removable size indicator and, more<br>
particularly, to a garment hanger having a size indicator<br>
which may be removed by way of a tool which engages a pivoting<br>
latch.<br>
U.S. Patent 3,949,914 illustrates a hanger with a<br>
modified hook which accepts a size indicator which clips onto<br>
one of the flunges which define the hook structure.<br>
U.S. Patent 4,115,940 illustrates a hanger having a<br>
size indicator or sizing tab which attaches to a tab mounting<br>
member mounted between the hanger hook and the hanger body.<br>
Hangers having size indicators mounted in this position are<br>
generally referred to in the trade as side sizers.<br>
U.S. Patent 4,322,902 illustrates a hanger having a<br>
display portion formed at the top of the hook which may accept<br>
two different types of size indicators. One type fastens to<br>
the display portion like a tie-tac, and the other slips over<br>
the top of the display portion. Hangers having size<br>
indicators; mountea in this position are generally referred to<br>
in the trade as top sizers.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,485,943 is typical of a number of<br>
patents ehich disclose one or more means to prevent<br>
inadvertent removal of the side sizer by blocking access to<br>
the edges of the side sizer, thereby preventing young children<br>
from obtaining "finger purchase" on the edge of the side sizer<br>
to pry it off.<br>
U.S. Patents 5,469,995; 5,778,575; 5,469,995;<br>
5096,101; 5 950,883; 5,683,018; 5,642,840; 5,611,469; and<br>
5,407,105" all illustrate hangers having various means to make<br>
the side sizer "substantially unremovable" or "irremovable"<br>
once the sizing tab engages the tab holder on the hanger. The<br>
intent is to make the hanger and sizing system "child proof",<br>
and thereby prrvent a clild from inadvertently removing the<br>
tab, and swallowing or choking on the side sizer.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,449,099 is one of several patents on a<br>
hanger and side sizer system that provides a tool for removing<br>
the side sizer if it is inadvertently applied, or if the<br>
hanger is later used to hang a garment of a different size.<br>
Multiple cuts are provided through the security rib and the<br>
attachment, member to enable a special tool to pry the<br>
indicator from the hanger.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,687,887 illustrates another design for<br>
a hanger and side sizer that enables a special tool to slide<br>
through cuts in the security rib and thereby remove the side<br>
sizer.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,794,363 illustrates a hanger hook<br>
adapted to top sizer, which hanger hook, has a<br>
resiliernt detent engagement means for securing the top sizer<br>
which erables the top sizer to be automatically removed for<br>
re-use of the hanger.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide<br>
a garment hanger with a novel size indicator and indicator<br>
attachment mechanism.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to<br>
provide a garment hanger with a removable size indicator.<br>
rt ia yet a further object of the present invention<br>
to provide a garment manger with removable size indicator<br><br>
that may be mounted on the top of the hook or at the side of<br>
the hook.<br>
It is still yet a further object of the present<br>
invention to provide a garment hanger with a removable size<br>
indicator that is securely affixed to the hanger during use,<br>
and is thereby "child proof, yet which may be quickly and<br>
easily removed with a tool when it is desired to re-use the<br>
hanger with garment of a different size.<br>
Accordingly, a garment hanger having a removable<br>
size indicator is provided. The garment hanger comprises: a<br>
hanging leans for suspending the hanger on a support and a<br>
body contected to the hanging means,- the hanger having at<br>

garment ranger of the present invention, the pivoting latch is<br>
defined by a slot cut through the web, the slot having a shape<br>
defined by at least two sides, the pivoting latch being<br>
further defined by a living hinge closing the shape of the<br>
slot. Preferablv. the slot is two sided and the living hinge<br>
closes tne shape of the slot thereby forming a triangular<br>
shaped pivoting latch. The pivoting latch further having an<br>
engagement means for facilitating the pivoting of the pivoting<br>
latch. Preferably, the engagement means comprises a<br>
cantilevered end of the pivoting latch which when a releasing<br>
force is applied thereto provides a mechanical advantage for<br>
pivoting the pivoting latch out of engagement with at least<br>
one engagement .butment and finger means of the size<br>
indicator the wee rurther has a guard extending across the<br>
web and below the size indicator, the guard having a down-<br>
turned portion which follows the contours of the cantilevered<br>
end. The guard protects the cantilevered end from inadvertent<br>
actuatic The cantileveredend preferably has engagement<br>
means adapted to receive a tool used for application of the<br>
releasing force. The engagement means is preferably a dimple<br>
formed on a side of the cantilevered end.<br>
In a preferred implementation of the garment hanger<br>
of the present invention, the size indicator preferably has a<br>
face and two sides depending therefrom, each of the sides<br>
terminating in a foremost edge, the foremost edges being<br>
configured such that the cantilevered end of the pivoting<br><br>
latch is exposed when the size indicator is secured on the<br>
web. The finger means of the size indicator preferably<br>
comprises an inwardly facing ridge disposed at each of the<br>
foremost and projecting inwards towards the channel.<br>
The at least one engagement abutment is preferably disposed on<br>
each of an inner surface of the two sides between the face and<br>
the foremost edge.<br>
In yet another preferred implementation of the<br>
garment hanger of the present invention, the web further<br>
comprisess an outermost edge having an outermost portion of a<br>
predetermined cross-section, the size indicator having a pair<br>
of spaced projections projecting from an inner surface of the<br>
face and substantially configured to receive an outermost<br>
portion of the web therebetween for preventing a lateral<br>
movement of the size indicator when the size indicator is<br>
secured on the web.<br>
In still yet another preferred implementation of the<br>
garment hanger of the present invention, the web further<br>
comprises locating quides for locating the size indicator in a<br>
predetermined position on the web. The locating guides<br>
preferably comprise first and second guides disposed on each<br>

between the guides when it is applied. Preferably each of the<br>
first and second guides do not extend the full length of the<br>
side of the size indicator.<br>
still yet provided is a size indicator to be<br>
removabLy secured to a web of a garment hanger. The size<br>
indicator comprises a face and two sides depending therefrom<br>
defining a channel, each of the sides terminating in a<br>
foremost edge inner surface of the face having a pair of<br>
spaced projections substantially configured to receive an<br>
outermost, portion of the web therebetween for preventing a<br>
lateral movement of the size indicator when the size indicator<br>
is secured on the web. Each of the sides have at least one<br>
engagement amounted disposed between the face and foremost<br>
edge and an inwardly facing ridge disposed at each of the<br>
foremost edges and projecting inwards cowards the channel for<br>
engaging a fixed ridge and a pivoting ridge on the web. The<br>
cross section of the size indicator enables the size indicator<br>
to be extruded and then cut into sections. The indicators may<br>
be printed before or after cutting. This process<br>
substantially lowers the cost of producing size indicators as<br>
compared to the cost of producing indicators which muse be<br>
individually molded.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, a hanger hook is<br>
provided which has provisions for receiving either a side<br>
sizer cr a top sizer as desiied. This reduces the inventory<br>
of hangers required for a garment manufacturer who ships to<br>
both types of: retail environments, i.e., retail stores which<br>
desire siide eizers, and those who desire top sizers.<br>
Alternetely if desired both could be affixed to the hook.<br>
In this embodiment, the top sizer is longer than the side<br>
sizer to provide greater visibility and visual harmony with<br>
other top sizer hangers, although the top web and the side web<br>
could be formed to receive the same length of size indicator,<br>
thereby allowing the manufacturer to use the same size<br>
indicator as either a side sizer or a top sizer.<br>

indicator l08a, 111a therebetween and to center the size<br>
indicator 108a, 111a during application thereof on the web<br>
106a. Preferably, the first and second guides 146a, 146b do<br>
not extend the full length of the side edges 146a, 148b of the<br>
size indicator but define elongate openings 150a, 150b which<br>
expose the side edges 148a, 148b of the size indicator.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 6a and 7a, the operation of<br>
the garment hanger 100a of the present invention will be<br>
explained with regard to size indicator 108a. Size indicator<br>
108a is mounted on the web 106a by sliding it over web 106a in<br>
the direction of arrow C. While being mounted in the<br>
direction of arrow C, the pivoting latch 112 pivots in the<br>
direction of arrow A until the inwardly facing ridges 134a,<br>
134b of finger means 134 pass over the fixed and pivoting<br>
ridges ll0, 112a which, the inwardly facing fingers<br>
134a, 134b snap into place in an area defined by the guide 136<br>
and a bottom edge of the fixed and pivoting ridges 110, 112,<br>
the area being referenced by reference numeral 152<br>
(illustrated in FIGS. 4 and 5). As such, the size indicator<br>
108a is releasably secured on the web 106a.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 6b and 7b, the operation of<br>
the ganue it hanger 100a of the present invention will be<br>
explained with regard to second version of the first<br>
embodiment: of the size indicator 111a. Similar to the manner<br>
in which size indicator 108a is mounted, size indicator 111a<br>
is mounted on the web 106a by sliding it in the direction of<br>
arrow C over web 106b. While being mounted in the direction<br>
of arrow C, the pivoting latch 112 pivots in the direction of<br>
arrow A until the inwardly facing ridges 134a, 134b of finger<br>
means 134 pass over the fixed and pivoting ridges 110, 112.<br>
After which, the facing fingers 134a, 134b snap into<br>
place in an area defined by the guide 136 and a bottom edge of<br>
the fixed and pivoting ridges 110, 112, the area being<br>
referenced by reference numeral 152 {illustrated in FIGS. 4<br>
and 5) . Simultaneously, the engagement abutments 126a and<br>
128a touch and engage with a face of the fixed and pivoting<br>
latches, 110, 112, respectively. As such, the size indicator<br>
11a is releasably secured on the web 106a,<br>
To release the size indicators 108a, 111a from the<br>
web 106a, a releasing force (F) is applied to the cantilevered<br>
end 122 of the pivoting latch 112, preferably by engaging the<br>
dimple 140 thereon with a release tool (not shown) . The<br>
release force of results in the pivoting latch 112 to pivot<br>
about the living hinge 120 in the direction of arrow A. As<br>
can be seen in FIGS. 7a and 7b planar side wall of the<br>
pivoting Latch 112 causes the inner ridge 134a of the finger<br>
means 134 of size indicators 108a, 111a to extend past the<br>
furthest extending portion of the fixed latch 110. At this<br>
point, the size indicator 108a, 111a may be manually removed<br>
from the web 106a.<br>
Preferably the size indicators 108a, 111a are<br>
fabricated from a resilient material and thereby the sides<br>
126, 12 8 may be slightly biased towards each other. Thus,<br>
when the side 126 of the size indicator 108a, 111a extends<br>
past the furthest extending portion of the fixed latch 110 the<br>
resilient bias of the size indicator 108a, 111a pops the size<br>
indicator off of the web automatically, without further manual<br>
intervention.<br>
Preliminary testing of the releasable size<br>
indicators 108a, 111a of the present invention has indicated<br>
that a ferce of approximately 25-30 pounds is needed to pull<br>
the size indicators from the latches of the web. Thus, the<br>
size indicators 111a of the present invention are<br>
considered to be child-proof, since industry standards require<br>
a minimun force of 15 pounds to pull off a size indicator from<br>
a hanger for the size indicator to be considered child-proof.<br>
