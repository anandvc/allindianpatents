Description<br>
LEADFRAME HAVING A HEAT SINK SUPPORTING RING,<br>
FABRICATING METHOD OF A LIGHT EMITTING DIODE<br>
PACKAGE USING THE SAME AND LIGHT EMITTING DIODE<br>
PACKAGE FABBRICATED BY THE METHOD<br>
Technical Field<br>
[1]	The present invention relates to a leadframe, a method of fabricating a light<br>
emitting diode package using the leadftame, and the light emitting diode package<br>
fabricated by the method, and more particularly to a leadframe having a heat sink<br>
support ring capable of fixing a heat sink to a leadframe to prevent the heat sink from<br>
being separated from a package body, a method of fabricating a light emitting diode<br>
package using the leadframe, and the light emitting diode package fabricated by the<br>
method.<br>
Background Art<br>
[2]	The luminous power of the light emitting diode (hereinafter referred to as LED) is<br>
substantially proportional to the input power. Therefore, high luminous power can be<br>
obtained by increasing the electric power input to the LED. However, the increase of<br>
the input power results in the increase of the junction temperature of the LED. The<br>
increase of the junction temperature of the LED causes the loss of photometric<br>
efficiency which represents the conversion rate of input energy into visible light.<br>
Therefore, it is required to prevent the junction temperature of the LED from rising due<br>
to the increased input power.<br>
[3]	One example of an LED package employing a heat sink to prevent the increase of<br>
the junction temperature of an LED is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,274,924 entitled<br>
surface mountable LED package. According to the USP 6,274,924, the thermal<br>
coupling of the heat sink to a LED die enables the LED die to maintain a low junction<br>
temperature. Therefore, relatively higher input power can be supplied to the LED die<br>
to obtain higher luminous power.<br>
[4]	However, the prior LED package is not structurally stable, since the heat sink can<br>
be easily separated from the package body. When the heat sink is separated from the<br>
package body, bonding wires electrically connecting the leads and the LED die<br>
mounted on an upper portion of the heat sink are cut off to bring an irreparable damage<br>
to the LED package. Consequently, the LED package capable of preventing the<br>
separation of the heat sink from the package body is required.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br><br>
2<br>
WO 2006/065007	PCT/KR2005/001043<br>
Technical Problem<br>
[5]	Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide an LED package<br>
capable of preventing the increase of junction temperature of an LED die under high<br>
input power, thereby obtaining high luminous power, and a method of fabricating the<br>
same.<br>
[6]	Another object of the present invention is to provide an LED package capable of<br>
preventing a heat sink from being separated from a package body, and a method of<br>
fabricating the same.<br>
[7]	A further object of the present invention is to provide a leadframe suitable for easily<br>
fabricating a structurally stable LED package with good heat dissipation charac-<br>
teristics.<br>
[8]<br>
Technical Solution<br>
[9]	In order to achieve these and other objects, the present invention provides a<br>
leadframe having a heat sink supporting ring, a method of fabricating a light emitting<br>
diode package using the leadframe, and the light emitting diode package fabricated by<br>
the method.<br>
[10]	In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a leadframe is provided. The<br>
leadframe includes a heat sink supporting ring for supporting a heat sink An outer<br>
frame is spaced apart from the heat sink supporting ring, and encloses the heat sink<br>
supporting ring. At least one supporting lead connects the heat sink supporting ring and<br>
the outer frame to support the supporting ring. At least one separated lead is extended<br>
from the outer frame toward the heat sink supporting ring, and is spaced apart from the<br>
heat sink supporting ring. Accordingly, since a package body can be formed using an<br>
insertion molding technique after a heat sink is inserted into the leadframe, a<br>
structurally stable LED packagecan be fabricated with ease.<br>
[11]	The heat sink supporting ring may be a C-type ring, that is a ring a portion of which<br>
is cut. The separated lead can be extended to the cut portion of the heat sink supporting<br>
ring.<br>
[12]	At least two supporting leads may connect the heat sink supporting ring and the<br>
outer frame. The supporting leads are disposed at opposite sides of the heat sink<br>
supporting ring to stably support the heat sink supporting ring against the outer frame.<br>
[13]	Also, at least twp separated leads are extended from the outer frame toward the heat<br>
sink supporting ring; At least two separated leads are spaced apart from the heat sink<br>
supporting ring. The separated leads are disposed at another opposite sides of the heat<br>
sink supporting ring.<br>
[14]	In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a method of fabricating<br><br>
3<br>
WO 2006/065007	PCT/KR2005/001043<br>
a light emitting diode package is provided. The method comprises preparing a<br>
leadfirame and a heat sink. The leadframe includes a heat sink supporting ring for<br>
supporting a heat sink. An outer frame is spaced apart from the heat sink supporting<br>
ring, and encloses the heat sink supporting ring. At least one supporting lead connects<br>
the heat sink supporting ring and the outer frame to support the supporting ring. At<br>
least a separated lead is extended from the outer frame toward the heat sink supporting<br>
ring, and is spaced apart from the heat sink supporting ring. The heat sink is prepared<br>
so as to be inserted and fixed to the heat sink supporting ring. The heat sink is inserted<br>
and fixed to the heat sink supporting ring. Then, a package body supporting the heat<br>
sink, the supporting lead and the separated lead is formed using an insertion molding<br>
technique. The package body has an opening exposing a portion of each of the leads<br>
and an upper surface of the heat sink. At least one light emitting diode die is mounted<br>
on an upper surface of the heat sink, and bonding wires electrically connecting the<br>
LED die and at least two of the leads are formed. Then, an encapsulant covering the<br>
light emitting diode die is formed. As such, it is possible to fabricate the LED package<br>
capable of preventing the heat sink from being separated from the package body.<br>
[ 15]	Meanwhile, the package body may have notches elongated from the upper edge<br>
portions thereof to the opening. The notches serve as an air vent for gas when forming<br>
an encapsulant using the molding technique. As such, an encapsulant having a lens<br>
shape is easily formed using a mold. The notches may be elongated from the opposite<br>
upper edge portions of the package body toward the opening.<br>
[16]	The supporting lead and the separated lead are cut from the outer frame to form<br>
connecting leads. The connecting leads may be bent at an exterior of the package body.<br>
[17]	The term supporting lead herein means a lead for connecting the outer frame and<br>
the heat sink supporting ring in the leadframe to support the heat sink supporting ring<br>
against the outer frame. The term separated lead herein means a lead extended from the<br>
outer frame toward the heat sink supporting ring but spaced apart from the supporting<br>
ring. In the meantime, the term connecting lead herein means a lead of the LED<br>
package to be electrically connected to an external circuit. The supporting lead and the<br>
separated lead may be used as a connecting lead of the LED package.<br>
[18]	In accordance with another aspect of the present, a light emitting diode package is<br>
provided. The package comprises a heat sink supporting ring. A heat sink is inserted<br>
into the heat sink supporting ring. At least two connecting leads are disposed at both<br>
sides of the heat sink supporting ring to be electrically isolated from each other. A<br>
package body is attached to the heat sink and connecting leads to support them. The<br>
package body has an opening exposing a portion of the each connecting lead and an<br>
upper surface of the heat sink. According to the another aspect of the invention, the<br>
heat sink supporting ring supports the heat sink to prevent the heat sink from being<br><br>
4<br>
WO 2006/065007	PCT/KR2005/001043<br>
separated from the package body.<br>
[19]	All of the connecting leads may be spaced apart from the heat sink supporting ring.<br>
Otherwise, one of the connecting leads may be connected to the heat sink supporting<br>
ring.<br>
[20]	The heat sink supporting ring may be a C-type ring, that is a ring a portion of which<br>
is cut. In this case, one of the connecting leads spaced apart from the supporting ring is<br>
extended to the cut portion of the heat sink supporting ring. As such, the connecting<br>
lead can be disposed closer to the heat sink.<br>
[21]	A lower surface of the heat sink is exposed outwardly. Therefore, heat is dissipated<br>
through the lower surface of the heat sink. The heat sink may have a base and a<br>
protrusion protruding upward from a center portion of the base. The protrusion is<br>
inserted into the heat sink supporting ring. As such, the size of the LED package can be<br>
reduced, with a surface area of the heat dissipation maintained.<br>
[22]	The heat sink may further have a supporting-ring holding groove for holding the<br>
support ring at a side of the protrusion to fasten the heat sink supporting ring. The<br>
supporting-ring holding groove may be a spiral groove. The heat sink supporting ring<br>
is fastened in the holding groove to firmly fix the heat sink.<br>
[23]	The package body is a plastic resin formed by an injection molding of thermosetting<br>
or thermoplastic resin, after the heat sink is inserted into the heat sink supporting ring.<br>
As such, a complicated package body can be easily formed, and the heat sink is firmly<br>
fixed to the package body.<br>
[24]	The package body may further have notches elongated from upper edge portions of<br>
the package body to the opening. The notches may be elongated from opposite upper<br>
edge portions of the package body to the opening.<br>
[25]	The package body may further have a lens holding groove on an upper surface<br>
thereof along an outer periphery of the upper surface. The lens holding groove<br>
increases a contact area between the package body and the lens to prevent the lens<br>
from being released from the package body.<br>
[26]	At least one light emitting diode die is mounted on the upper surface of the heat<br>
sink. The light emitting diode die is electrically connected to the connecting leads via<br>
bonding wires. Additionally, an encapsulant covers the light emitting diode die. The<br>
encapsulant protects the LED dies from external force and environment such as<br>
moisture. The encapsulant has hardness in the range of Durometer Shore 10A to<br>
Durometer Shore 70D so as to relieve mechanical and thermal stresses on the LED die.<br>
[27]	In addition, a phosphor may be disposed over the LED die to convert the<br>
wavelength of the light emitted from the LED die. The phosphor may be incorporated<br>
in the encapsulant.<br><br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[36]	Reference will now be made in detail to preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
[37]	Fig. l is a perspective view of a leadframe according to one embodiment of the<br>
present invention.<br>
[38]	Referring to Fig. 1, a leadframe 10 includes a heat sink supporting ring 13 into<br>
which a heat sink can be inserted. The supporting ring 13 may be formed in a circular<br>
ring shape as shown in Fig. 1, which is not limited thereto, but may be formed in a<br>
polygonal ring shape.<br>
[39]	The supporting ring 13 is enclosed by an outer frame 11. The outer frame 11 is<br>
spaced apart from the supporting ring 13. The outer frame 11 may be formed in a<br>
square shape as shown in Fig. 1, which is not limited thereto, but may be formed in a<br>
circular shape or polygonal shape.<br>
[40]	The outer frame 11 and the supporting ring 13 are connected to each other via at<br>
least one supporting lead 15a and/or 15b. The supporting ring 13 is fixed to the outer<br>
frame 11 by the supporting lead. As shown in Fig. 1, the supporting leads 15a and 15b<br>
can be disposed at opposite sides of the supporting ring 13 to fix the supporting ring 13<br>
to the outer frame 11. In addition to the supporting leads 15a and 15b, the supporting<br><br>
6<br>
WO 2006/065007	PCT/KR2005/001043<br>
ring 13 may be connected to the outer frame 11 via additional supporting leads.<br>
[41]	Furthermore, at least two separated leads 17a, 17b, 17c, 19a, 19b and 19c are<br>
extended from the outer frame 11 towards the supporting ring 13. The separated leads<br>
are spaced apart from Hie supporting ring 13. As shown in Fig. 1, the separated leads<br>
17a, 17b, 17c, 19a, 19b and 19c may have a longitudinal end with a wider area in the<br>
vicinity of the supporting ring 13. Meanwhile, the separated leads may be disposed at<br>
opposite sides of the supporting ring 13.<br>
[42]	The required number of the separated leads is determined by the type and the<br>
number of  LED dies to be mounted and the connective configuration of bonding wires.<br>
Howerver, the leadframe 10 may include multiple separated leads to fabricate various<br>
kinds of packages. The separated leads may be disposed in a direction perpendicular to<br>
the supporting leads 15a and 15b, as shown in Fig. 1.<br>
[43]	Although six separated leads are shown in Fig. 1, fewer separated leads may be<br>
disposed, or additional separated leads may be further disposed.<br>
[44]	The leadframe 10 according to one embodiment of the present invention may be<br>
fabricated by pressing a plate of phosphorous bronze with a die. Although one<br>
leadframe 10 is shown in Fig. 1, a plurality of leadframes 10 may be manufactured and<br>
arranged on one phosphorous bronze plate. In particular, a plurality of leadframes 10 f<br>
abricated on one phosphorous bronze plate are used to mass-produce the LED<br>
packages.<br>
[45]	Fig. 2 is a process flow depicting a method of fabricating an LED package<br>
according to one embodiment of the present invention. Figs. 3 through 14 are<br>
perspective views depicting a method of fabricating an LED package according to one<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[46]	Referring to Fig. 2, the leadframe 10 described above with reference to Fig. 1 is<br>
prepared (S01). The leadframe 10 is fabricated by pressing the phosphorous bronze<br>
plate, or a plurality of leadframes 10 may be fabricated and arranged on one<br>
phosphorous bronze plate.<br>
[47]	Referring to Figs. 2 and 3, a heat sink 20 which can be inserted and fixed to the<br>
supporting ring 13 of the leadframe 10 is prepared(S03). The heat sink 20 has an upper<br>
surface on which the LED die is mounted. Preferably, the size of the upper surface of<br>
the heat sink 20 is smaller than the inner diameter of the supporting ring 13 to easily<br>
insert the heat sink into the supporting ring 13. Also, the side of the heat sink 20 has an<br>
outer diameter larger than the inner diameter of the supporting ring 13.<br>
[48]	Also, the heat sink 20 may have a supporting-ring holding groove 23a to fasten to<br>
the supporting ring 13. Furthermore, the supporting-ring holding groove 23a may be<br>
provided with a spiral groove to easily fasten to the supporting ring 13.<br>
[49]	The heat sink 20 has a base 21 and a protrusion 23 protruding upward from a center<br><br>
7<br>
WO 2006/065007	PCT/KR2005/001043<br>
portion of the base 21. In this case, the supporting-ring holding groove 23a is formed at<br>
a side of the protrusion 23. The base 21 and the protrusion 23 may have a cylindrical<br>
shape, as shown in the drawings, which is not limited thereto, but may have a shape of<br>
a polygonal casing. The protrusion 23 is formed in the shape similar to an internal<br>
shape of the supporting ring 13, but the present invention is not limited thereto. That is,<br>
although the supporting ring 13 has a shape of a circular ring, the protrusion 23 may<br>
have a shape of a rectangular casing.<br>
[50]	The heat sink 20 may be made of metal having a high thermal conductivity or a<br>
thermal conductive resin through pressing or molding technique. Also, the heat sink 20<br>
is made by separate processes as those for the leadframe 10. Hence, the step S01 of<br>
preparing the leadframe 10 and the step S03 of preparing the heat sink 20 may be<br>
executed in reverse order or simultaneously.<br>
[51]	Referring to Figs. 2 and 4, the heat sink 20 is inserted into and fixed to the<br>
supporting ring 13 of the leadframe 10 (S05). Since an outer diameter of the side of the<br>
heat sink 20 is larger than the inner diameter of the supporting ring 13, the heat sink 20<br>
may be forcibly inserted and fixed to the supporting ring 13.<br>
[52]	When the heat sink 20 is formed with the supporting-ring holding groove 23a, the<br>
supporting ring 13 is accepted into the supporting-ring holding groove 23a to support<br>
the heat sink 20. In this case, it is preferable that a portion of the supporting ring 13 is<br>
accepted into the supporting-ring holding groove 23a, and the remaining portion of the<br>
supporting ring 13 protrudes outward from the protrusion 23, as shown in the<br>
drawings. When the supporting-ring holding groove 23a is a spiral groove, the heat<br>
sink 20 is inserted into the supporting ring 13 by rotating the heat sink 20.<br>
[53]	Referring to Figs. 2 and 5, after the heat sink 20 is fixed to the leadframe 10, a<br>
package body 30 is formed using an insertion molding technique(S07). The package<br>
body 30 may be formed of thermosetting or thermoplastic resin through an injection<br>
molding.<br>
[54]	The package body 30 is formed at the circumference of the heat sink 20 to support<br>
the support ring 13, the supporting leads 15a and 15b, the separated leads 17a, 17b,<br>
17c, 19a, 19b and 19c, and the heat sink 20. The package body is attached to the heat<br>
sink and the leads. The supporting leads and separated leads partially protrude outward<br>
from the package body 30. Furthermore, the package body 30 has an opening that<br>
exposes an upper end of the heat sink 10 and the leads.<br>
[55]	Referring to Fig. 5, the supporting ring 13 and the leads are exposed through the<br>
opening. Otherwise, as shown in Fig. 6, the package body 30a may cover most portions<br>
of the heat sink 20, the supporting ring 13 and the leads except for the upper end of the<br>
heat sink 20 and portions of the separated leads 17a, 17b, 17c, 19a, 19b and 19c. To<br>
this end, several openings may be provided.<br><br>
8<br>
WO 2006/065007	PCT/KR2005/001043<br>
[56]	Meanwhile, the package body 30a may have notches 30n on its upper surface, as<br>
shown in Fig. 7. The notches are elongated from the upper edge portions of the<br>
package body 30 opposite to each other to the opening. The notches may have a<br>
bottom that is higher near the opening of the package body 30 and lower far from the<br>
opening of the package body 30.<br>
[57]	Also, a lower surface of the heat sink 20 is outwardly exposed. Additionaly, a side<br>
of the base 21 may be exposed. As such, heat dissipation through the heat sink 20 is<br>
accelerated.<br>
[58]	The package body 30 is formed in a cylindrical shape, as shown in Figs. 5, 6 and 7,<br>
which is not limited thereto, but may be formed in the shape of a polygonal casing (e.g.<br>
rectangular casing).<br>
[59]	Since the package body 30 is shaped by injection molding the thermosetting or ther-<br>
moplastic resin after the heat sink 20 is coupled to the leadframe 10, the heat sink 20 is<br>
firmly coupled to the package body 30.<br>
[60]	Referring to Figs. 2 and 8, the supporting leads 15a and 15b protruding outward<br>
from the package body 30 are cut and removed (S09). Consequently, the cut<br>
supporting leads 16a and 16b are left on the package body 30, and the supporting leads<br>
16a and 16b prevent the heat sink 20 from being separated from the package body 30.<br>
[61]	While the supporting leads are cut, the separated leads protruding outward from the<br>
package body 30 may be cut and removed except for the leads that will be used as<br>
current paths. As shown in Fig. 9, when only two separated leads 17c and 19c are<br>
required, the remaining separated leads 17a, 17b, 19a and 19b are cut and removed.<br>
Also, as shown in Fig. 10, when four separated leads 17a, 17c, 19a and 19c are<br>
required, the remaining separated leads 17b and 19b are cut and removed.<br>
[62]	The process of cutting and removing the separated leads is performed when the<br>
number of separated leads provided on the leadframe 10 is more than the number of<br>
the separated lead required for the LED package. If the number of the separated leads<br>
required for the LED package equals the number of the separated leads provided on the<br>
leadframe 10, the process of cutting and removing the separated leads is not<br>
performed. Also, even if extra separated leads are left out, they do not influence the<br>
operation of the LED package. Hence, the process of cutting and removing the extra<br>
separated leads can be skipped.<br>
[63]	Referring to Figs. 2 and 11, LED dies 40 are mounted on the upper surface of the<br>
heat sink 20(S11). Each of the LED dies 40 may be a so-called 1 bond-die having<br>
electrodes on the upper and lower surfaces thereof or a so-called 2 bond-die having<br>
two electrodes on the upper surface thereof.<br>
[64]	If any one of the LED die 40 is 1 bond-die, it is preferable that the heat sink 20 be<br>
made of conductive metal, and that the 1 bond LED die 40 be mounted on the heat sink<br><br>
9<br>
WO 2006/065007	PCT/KR2005/001043<br>
20 by conductive adhesive such as silver (Ag) epoxy. If all of the LED dies 40 are 2<br>
bond-dies, it is not necessary to make the heat sink 20 of conductive metal. Also, the<br>
LED dies 40 may be mounted on the heat sink 20 by other conductive adhesive, as<br>
well as the silver (Ag) epoxy.<br>
[65]	A plurality of LED dies 40 may be mounted on the heat sink 20. In this case, the<br>
LED dies 40 may emit light of different wavelengths. For example, three LED dies 40<br>
may be mounted, as shown in Fig. 11. The three LED dies 40 may emit light of red<br>
(R), green (G) and blue (B) colors respectively. As such, it is possible to provide a<br>
LED package radiating full colors of light using the LED dies 40.<br>
[66]	Referring to Figs. 2 and 12, the LED dies 41,43 and 45 are electrically connected to<br>
the separated leads 17a, 17b, 17c, 19a, 19b and 19c by bonding wires (S13). When the<br>
LED dies 41,43 and 45 are all 2 bond-dies, each of the LED dies is electrically<br>
connected to two separated leads through two bonding wires. As shown in the<br>
drawings, each of the LED dies 41,43 and 45 may be electrically connected to a<br>
different pair of separated leads. Also, one common separated lead (for example, 17b)<br>
is electrically connected to each of the LED dies by bonding wires, and other different<br>
separated leads (for example, 19a, 19b, 19c) opposite to the common separated lead are<br>
electrically connected to the LED dies by other bonding wires. In this case, each LED<br>
die may be operated by each different current, respectively.<br>
[67]	Referring to Fig. 13, a 1 bond-die 41a and 2 bond-dies 43 and 45 may be mounted<br>
together. In this case, one of the separated lead 17b is electrically connected to the heat<br>
sink 20 via a bonding wire. Hence, the separated lead 17b is electrically connected to<br>
the lower surface of the 1 bond-die 41a through the bonding wire and the heat sink 20.<br>
Various combinations of the 1 bond-die and the 2 bond-die are possible, and a method<br>
of connecting the bonding wires may be selected in variety.<br>
[68]	Also, a method of connecting the separated leads and the LED dies may be selected<br>
in variety, and a plurality of the LED dies may be connected to each other in series,<br>
parallel or series-parallel.<br>
[69]	Meanwhile, after the LED dies 41,43 and 45 are electrically connected to the<br>
separated leads by the bonding wires, the LED dies 41,43 and 45 are sealed by an en-<br>
capsulant (not shown in the diagram) (S15). The encapsulant protects the LED dies<br>
from external force and environment such as moisture. To relieve mechanical or<br>
thermal stresses on the LED dies, the encapsulant is selected to have hardness in the<br>
range of Durometer Shore 10A to Durometer Shore 70D. The opening of the package<br>
body 30 is filled with the encapsulant to seal the LED dies and the bonding wires.<br>
[70]	Also, the encapsulant may incorporate a phosphor. For example, the phosphor may<br>
convert blue light into yellow light, or green light and red light. Therefore, when blue<br>
emitting LED die is mounted, a portion of light emitted from the LED is converted into<br><br>
10<br>
WO 2006/065007	PCT/KR2005/001043<br>
yellow, or green and red to provide an LED package that emits white light externally.<br>
The phosphor is not limited to the ones that convert the light emitted by LED into<br>
above colors, and may be selected to provide an LED package for radiating the color<br>
wanted by the user, in addition to the white light. Also, the phosphor is not limited to<br>
being incorporated in the encapsulant, and may be deposited on the LED.<br>
[71]	Furthermore, the encapsulant may incorporate a diffuser. The diffuser diffuses the<br>
light emitted from the LED dies to prevent the LED dies and the bonding wires from<br>
being shown from the exterior and to uniformly radiate the light outward.<br>
[72]	After the LED dies are sealed by the encapsulant, a lens (not shown in the diagram)<br>
is formed on the package body 30 (SI7). The lens is made of a transparent resin, such<br>
as epoxy resin or silicon resin, through a molding technique. In this case, the notches<br>
30n formed on the upper portion of the package body 30 function as an air vent, as<br>
shown in Fig. 7. The lens is used to radiate the light in a constant orientation angle, and<br>
may be omitted, if it is not required. The encapsulant may be formed in a lens shape to<br>
function as the lens. In this case, a process of forming the lens is skipped.<br>
[73]	Referring to Figs. 2 and 14, the separated leads 17a, 17b, 17c, 19a, 19b and 19c are<br>
cut from the outer frame 11 and bent (SI9). As a result, connecting leads to be<br>
electrically connected to an external circuit are completed, and a surface-mountable<br>
LED package is provided. The step of cutting and removing the supporting leads (S09)<br>
may be performed together in step (SI 9) of cutting the separated lead from the outer<br>
frame 11.<br>
[74]	The LED package according to one embodiment of the present invention will now<br>
be described with reference to Figs. 14 and 15.<br>
[75]	Again referring to Fig. 14, the LED package includes a heat sink supporting ring 13.<br>
The heat sink supporting ring 13 may be made of copper alloy such as phosphorous<br>
bronze. The supporting ring 13 is formed in a circular ring shape, as shown in Fig. 14,<br>
which is not limited thereto, but may be formed in a polygonal ring shape. Cut<br>
supporting leads 16a and 16b are extended outward from the supporting ring 13. The<br>
cut supporting leads 16a and 16b may be disposed at the opposite sides of the<br>
supporting ring 13.<br>
[76]	The heat sink 20, which is described referring to Fig. 3, is inserted into the<br>
supporting ring 13. Meanwhile, at least two connecting leads 17a, 17b, 17c, 19a, 19b<br>
and 19c are disposed at both sides of the supporting ring and are spaced apart from the<br>
supporting ring 13 and the heat sink 20. The connecting leads may be bent to be<br>
surface- mounted.<br>
[77]	Additionally, the package body 30 is molded to support the heat sink 20 and the<br>
connecting leads. The package body 30 has an opening at an upper portion thereof to<br>
expose an upper surface of the heat sink 20 and a portion of the connecting lead.<br><br>
11<br>
WO 2006/065007	PCT/KR2005/001043<br>
Meanwhile, the connecting leads penetrate a side wall of the package body 30 and<br>
protrude outward.<br>
[78]	As described referring to Fig. 5, the supporting ring 13 and the supporting leads 15a<br>
and 15b are partially exposed through the opening. Hence, the upper portion of the<br>
package body 30 is formed with a groove. Also, as described referring to Fig. 6, the<br>
package body (30a in Fig. 6) may cover major portions of the heat sink 20 except for<br>
the upper end of the heat sink 20 and portions of the connecting leads. To this end,<br>
several openings may be provided. Furthermore, the package body 30 has notches 30n<br>
elongated from the upper edge portions to the opening, as shown in Fig. 15.<br>
[79]	The package body 30 is a plastic resin formed by an injection molding of ther-<br>
mosetting or thermoplastic resin, after the heat sink 20 is inserted and fixed to the<br>
supporting ring 13.<br>
[80]	Meanwhile, LED dies 41,43 and 45 are mounted on the upper surface of the heat<br>
sink 20. Although the LED dies shown in Fig. 14 are so-called 2 bond-dies, which are<br>
not limited thereto, but the LED dies may be any one of so-called 1 bond-dies or<br>
combination of the 1 bond-die(s) and 2 bond-die(s).<br>
[81]	The LED dies are electrically connected to the connecting leads through bonding<br>
wires. If the LED dies are the 2 bond-dies, each of the LED dies is electrically<br>
connected to two connecting leads via two bonding wires. If at least one of the LED<br>
dies is the 1 bond-die, the heat sink is electrically connected to at least one connecting<br>
leads via the bonding wire.<br>
[82]	Various method of connecting the LED dies and the connecting leads is possible,<br>
and may be selected in variety depending on the desired characteristics of the LED<br>
package.<br>
[83]	Meanwhile, the LED dies are sealed by an encapsulant (not shown in the diagram).<br>
Grooves formed on the upper portion of the package body 30 are filled with the en-<br>
capsulant. Also, the encapsulant may incorporate a phosphor and/or a diffuser. The en-<br>
capsulant may be formed in a lens shape. Alternatively, a lens (not shown in the<br>
diagram) may be formed on the package body 30 to cover the encapsulant.<br>
[84]	According to this embodiment, the heat sink 20 is inserted into the heat sink<br>
supporting ring 13, so that it is possible to prevent the heat sink 20 from being<br>
separated from the package body 30.<br>
[85]	In the LED package as described above, the connecting leads 17a, 17b, 17c, 19a,<br>
19b and 19c are spaced apart from the supporting ring 13. The present invention is not<br>
limited thereto, and one of the connecting leads may be connected to the supporting<br>
ring 13. The LED package according to another embodiment of the present invention<br>
will now be described, in which one of the connecting leads may be connected to the<br>
supporting ring 13.<br><br>
12<br>
WO 2006/065007	PCT/KR2005/001043<br>
[86]	Figs. 16 and 17 are a perspective view and a top plan view depicting an LED<br>
package 50 according to another embodiment of the present invention, respectively.<br>
Fig. 18 is a cross-sectional view depicting the LED package 50 in Fig. 16, on which an<br>
LED die and a lens 75 are mounted. Figs. 19 and 20 are top plan views depicting<br>
leadframes usable for fabricating the LED package 50 according to another<br>
embodiment of the present invention, respectively.<br>
[87]	Referring to Figs. 16 through 18, the LED package 50 includes a heat sink<br>
supporting ring 53, a heat sink inserted into the supporting ring 53, connecting leads 55<br>
and 57, and a package body 70.<br>
[88]	The heat sink supporting ring 53 may be a C-type ring, that is a ring a portion of<br>
which is cut, as shown in Fig. 19, which is not limited thereto, and the supporting ring<br>
may be formed in a closed ring as a supporting ring 83 shown in Fig. 20.<br>
[89]	The connecting lead 55 is extended outward from the supporting ring 53. Also, the<br>
connecting lead 57 is spaced apart from the supporting ring 53 and disposed in the<br>
vicinity of the supporting ring 53. If the supporting ring 53 is the C-type ring, the<br>
connecting lead 57 may be elongated to the cut portion of the supporting ring 53.<br>
Hence, the end of the connecting lead 57 can be disposed at a position relatively close<br>
to a center of the supporting ring 53. As a result, compared to the leadframe shown in<br>
Fig. 20, the size of the package body 70 can be reduced using the leadframe having C-<br>
type supporting ring 53 . Preferably, a portion removed from the supporting ring 53 is<br>
below 1/4 the size of the entire supporting ring. That is, as the removed portion gets<br>
smaller, an interface between the supporting ring 53 and the heat sink 60 is increased<br>
to strengthen electrical connection.<br>
[90]	As shown in Fig. 19 or Fig. 20, the connecting lead 55 originates from a supporting<br>
lead 55a which connects the supporting ring 53 and the outer frame (11 in Fig. 1)<br>
enclosing the heat sink supporting ring. The connecting lead 57 originates from a<br>
separated lead 57a extended from the outer frame toward the supporting ring 53.<br>
Therefore, the supporting ring 53 and the leads 55a and 57a can be fabricated together<br>
by pressing one plate of phosphorous bronze. In addition to the supporting lead 55a,<br>
the supporting ring 53 may be connected to the outer frame by other supporting leads.<br>
The separated leads 57a as well as additional separated leads spaced apart from the<br>
supporting ring 53 can be disposed. Meanwhile, The separated lead 57a may have a<br>
longitudinal end with a wider area in the vicinity of the supporting ring 53, as the<br>
separated leads shown in Fig. 1, to prevent the separated lead from being separated<br>
from the package body 70. As shown in the drawings, the separated lead may be<br>
formed with a through-hole 57c. The through-hole 57c accepts a portion of the package<br>
body 70 to prevent the separated lead 57a from being released from the package body.<br>
[91]	The heat sink 60 is inserted and fixed to the supporting ring 53. The heat sink 60<br><br>
13<br>
WO 2006/065007	PCT/KR2005/001043<br>
has a base and a protrusion protruding upward from a center portion of the base and<br>
inserted into the supporting ring 53, as shown and described in Fig. 3. Also, the<br>
protrusion is formed with a supporting ring holding groove at a side thereof. The<br>
holding groove may be formed in a circular shape along an outer side of the protrusion<br>
or formed with a spiral groove. The heat sink having the spiral groove 60a is shown<br>
herein. Since the heat sink has the spiral groove, the heat sink 60 can be inserted into<br>
the supporting ring by rotational motion. The heat sink 60 is directly electrically<br>
connected to the connecting lead 55 via the supporting ring 53.<br>
[92]	The heat sink 60 can be formed with a latching groove at a side 60b of the base. The<br>
latching groove may be formed at one portion of the side 60b of the base, or be con-<br>
tinuously formed along the side of the base. When a bottom surface of the heat sink 60<br>
is wider, the heat dissipation is promoted. Therefore, a lower end of the base side may<br>
be exposed to the exterior, as shown in Figs. 16 and 18. However, the latching groove<br>
and the side of the base above the latching groove are covered by the package body 70.<br>
Hence, the latching groove accepts a portion of the package body 70, thereby further<br>
preventing the heat sink 60 from being released from the package body 70.<br>
[93]	The heat sink 60 is made of conductive material, for example, copper (Cu),<br>
aluminum (Al) or an alloy thereof. The heat sink 60 may be formed by molding or<br>
pressing technology.<br>
[94]	The package body 70 is attached to the heat sink 60 and the connecting leads 55 and<br>
57 to support them. After the heat sink 60 is inserted into the supporting ring 53, the<br>
package body 70 is formed by an insertion molding of thermosetting or thermoplastic<br>
resin. Hence, the package body 70 fills the latching groove of the heat sink 60, and is<br>
attached to the heat sink 60 and the connecting leads 55 and 57 to join them.<br>
[95]	Also, the package body 70 has an opening that exposes an upper end of the heat<br>
sink 60 and a portion of the connecting lead 57. Also, the opening may expose a<br>
portion of the connecting lead 55. In this case, the protrusion of the heat sink 60 may<br>
protrude from the upper surface of the package body 70, as shown in Fig. 18. The<br>
package body 70 may be provided on the upper surface thereof with a lens holding<br>
groove 70h along the outer periphery. The lens holding groove 70h holds a lens 75 to<br>
prevent the lens 75 from being separated from the package body 70. In addition, the<br>
package body 70 is provided on the upper surface thereof with a notch 70n. The<br>
notches 70n may be positioned at opposite sides, as shown in Fig. 15.<br>
[96]	Again referring to Fig. 18, an LED die 71 is mounted on the heat sink 60. The LED<br>
die 71 may be fabricated of a compound semiconductor such as (Al, In, Ga)N, and be<br>
selected to emit light of desired wavelength. For example, the LED die 71 is a<br>
compound semiconductor emitting light of blue color.<br>
[97]	The LED die 71 may be a so-called 1 bond-die having electrodes on its upper and<br><br>
14<br>
WO 2006/065007	PCT/KR2005/001043<br>
lower surfaces, respectively. The lower electrode is adhered to the heat sink 60 by a<br>
conductive adhesive such as silver (Ag) epoxy. Since the heat sink 60 is directly<br>
electrically connected to the connecting lead 55, the LED die 71 is electrically<br>
connected to the connecting lead 55 via the heat sink. Hence, the bonding wire for<br>
connecting the LED die 71 and the connecting lead 55 may be omitted. Meanwhile, the<br>
upper electrode of the LED die 71 is electrically connected to the connecting lead 57<br>
via the bonding wire 73.<br>
[98]	In contrast, the LED die 71 may be a so-called 2 bond-die having two electrodes on<br>
a same surface. In this case, two electrodes are electrically connected to the connecting<br>
leads 55 and 57 via the bonding wire, respectively. However, since the connecting lead<br>
55 is directly electrically connected to the heat sink 60, the LED die 71 may be<br>
connected to the heat sink 60 by using the bonding wire. Hence, a wiring process of<br>
connecting the LED die 71 and the heat sink 60 using the boding wire is easily<br>
performed than the prior art.<br>
[99]	Meanwhile, the LED die is sealed by an encapsulant. The encapsulant may be an<br>
epoxy resin or a silicon resin. Also, the encapsulant may incorporate a phosphor<br>
capable of converting a wavelength of light emitted from the LED die 71. For example,<br>
in the case where the LED die 71 emits blue light, the encapsulant incorporates a<br>
phosphor capable of converting the blue light into yellow light, or green light and red<br>
light. As a result, the LED package emits white light outward.<br>
[ 100]	The encapsulant is covered by the lens 75. The lens 75 may have a convex lens, as<br>
shown in Fig. 18, such that the light is emitted from the LED die 71 in a constant<br>
orientation angle. The lens 75 may be formed by molding a transparent resin such as<br>
silicon resin or epoxy resin. The lens 75 fills the lens holding groove 70h. Hence, the<br>
adhesion between the lens 75 and the package body 70 is increased to prevent the lens<br>
from being released from the LED package.<br>
[101]         Meanwhile, the encapsulant may be formed in a lens shape, and thus the en-<br>
capsulant may be integrally formed with the lens 75. In this case, the encapsulant fills<br>
the opening and lens holding groove 70h of the package body 70.<br>
[ 1021	While the present invention has been described and illustrated herein with reference<br>
to the preferred embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that<br>
various modifications and variations can be made therein without departing from the<br>
spirit and scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present invention covers<br>
the modifications and variations of this invention that come within the scope of the<br>
appended claims and their equivalents.<br>

forming a package body exposing upper and lower surfaces of the heat sink; and<br>
mounting at least one light emitting diode die on the upper surface of the heat<br>
sink.<br>

cutting the supporting lead and the separated lead from the outer frame to form<br>
connecting leads.<br>
[20]	The method as claimed in claim 18, further comprising;<br>
forming an encapsulant covering the light emitting diode die.<br><br>
19<br><br><br>
There are provided a leadframe, a method of fabricating a light emitting diode package using the leadframe, and<br>
the light emitting diode package fabricated by the method. The leadframe includes a heat sink supporting ring for supporting a heat<br>
sink. An outer frame is spaced apart from the heat sink supporting ring, and encloses the heat sink supporting ring. At least one<br>
supporting lead connects the heat sink supporting ring and the outer frame. A separated lead is extended from the outer frame toward<br>
 the heat sink supporting ring, and is spaced apart from the heat sink supporting ring. Consequently, since the package body can be<br>
formed by an injection molding after a heat sink is inserted into the leadframe, a LED package having structural stability and good<br>
 heat dissipation can be fabricated with ease.</td>
