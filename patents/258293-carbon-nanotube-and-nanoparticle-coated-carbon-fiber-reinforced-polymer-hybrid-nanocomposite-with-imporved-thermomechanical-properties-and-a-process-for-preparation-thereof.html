				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to carbon nanotube and nanoparticle<br>
coated carbon fiber reinforced-polymer hybrid nanocomposite \vith<br>
improved thermomechanical properties and a process for preparation<br>
thereof.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Various types of composite materials, i.e., polymer matrix including<br>
thermoplastic and thermosetting, ceramic matrix, carbon matrix, metal<br>
matrix, etc are available for the last 50 years. These composite materials<br>
have many advantages over the conventional materials like high strength<br>
to weight ratio properties, exceptional temperature and corrosion<br>
resistance, high fatigue strength, excellent impact resistance, excellent<br>
solvent and wear resistance, very low internal friction coefficient, ability<br>
to engineer for use of structural, mechanical and thermal response, very<br>
good thermoformability, large-volume production capabilities, no harmful<br>
emission during production, etc. These are widely used through out our<br>
daily life including construction industries. But very few items are used<br>
in aerospace, automobile and medical industries due to the specified<br>
mechanical properties, which are not sufficient in these high tech<br>
applications. At the same time the inexpensive production techniques<br>
suitable for down to earth industries are not available.<br>
Conventional carbon nanotube polymer composites are prepared by two<br>
ways. One root is the addition of carbon nanotube in the polymer matrix<br>
using costly mixer, if the matrix is available in the solid form. Otherwise<br>
it is done by sonication if the matrix material is available in liquid form.<br>
In both cases the uniform dispersion of carbon nanotube is a major<br>
problem. Researchers did not find any substantial improvement in<br>
mechanical properties, thermal stability, electrical resistivity, magnetic<br>
properties using this technique. Other root is the mixing of carbon<br>
nanotube in the precursor of fibers, i.e., pitch in the case of pitch based<br>
carbon fiber then extruding the fiber through a spinneret. Researchers<br>
have made composites using this fiber and polymer matrix. Again they<br>
did not find any substantial improvement in all these properties, i.e.,<br>
mechanical, thermal stability, electrical resistivity, magnetic, etc due to<br>
the uneven distribution of carbon nanotube. Keeping this in mind a<br>
process in this invention has been developed where the carbon fiber is<br>
coated with carbon nanotubes through out the surface and then hybrid<br>
nanocomposites are prepared using this carbon nanotube coated carbon<br>
fiber. In this the question of distribution of carbon nanotube does not<br>
arise. In this case we find an excellent improvement is found in<br>
mechanical properties, electrical resistivity and thermal stability, etc.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Pitch-based carbon fibers, having a highly ordered morphology, are well<br>
known in the art. That is, when heated, pitch materials form an isotropic<br>
mass. As heating continues, spherical bodies begin to form. The<br>
spherical bodies are of an anisotropic liquid crystalline nature as viewed<br>
under polarized light. These spheres continue to grow and coalesce until<br>
a dense continuous anisotropic phase forms, which phase has been<br>
termed the "mesophase." Thus, the mesophase is the intermediate phase<br>
or liquid crystalline region between the isotropic pitch and the semi-coke<br>
obtainable at higher temperatures. Mesophase pitch is extruded into<br>
fibers, oxidatively stabilized, and carbonized at high temperatures to<br>
form mesophase pitch-based carbon fibers.<br>
As compared to PAN-based carbon fibers, these mesophase pitch-based<br>
carbon fibers have a relatively high tensile modulus but a relatively low<br>
tensile strength and a relatively low compressive strength. That is, the<br>
highly graphitic structure of these polymers is responsible for their high<br>
modulus and high thermal conductivity, but also for their low strength.<br>
The structured, crystalline morphology that provides for the high tensile<br>
modulus also allows for the brittle failure of the fibers caused by the<br>
propagation of even minute flaws.<br>
In order to reduce the tendency of carbon fibers to fail through flaw<br>
propagation as described above, a variety of prior art patents have<br>
provided methods for producing such fibers with a less ordered, more<br>
random microstructure. To date, these efforts have focused on the<br>
method by which the fiber is extruded, including modification of the<br>
geometry of the die through which the fiber is extruded, rather than on<br>
composition modification.<br>
Carbon nanotubes, multilayer tubules by evaporating carbon in an arc<br>
discharge were first reported in 1991 by lijima (1). These linear fullerenes<br>
are attracting increasing interest as constituents of novel nanoscale<br>
materials and device structures. Defect-free nanotubes are expected to<br>
have remarkable mechanical, electronic and magnetic properties that will<br>
be tunable by varying the diameter, number of concentric shells, and<br>
chirality of the tube.<br>
Later on in 1993, lijima and Ichihashi (2) and Bethune et al. (3, 4)<br>
independently discovered a single-wall nanotube by vaporizing carbon<br>
together with a transition metal such as iron or cobalt in an arc<br>
generator. These syntheses produced low yields of non-uniform<br>
nanotubes mixed with large amounts of soot and metal particles.<br>
Subsequently Richard Quo et al. (5) disclose a process for making singlewall<br>
nanotubes having diameters of about 1 nm and lengths of several<br>
microns. The nanotubes aggregated into "ropes" in which many tubes<br>
were held together by van der Waals forces. The nanotubes produced<br>
were remarkably uniform in diameter.<br>
Significant improvement in yield of 70 to 90% and the 10, 10<br>
configuration (a chain of 10 hexagons around the circumference of the<br>
nanotube) was reported by Rao et. al (6) . The product consisted of fibers<br>
approximately 10 to 20 nm in diameter and many micrometers long<br>
comprising randomly oriented single-wall nanotubes, each nanotube<br>
having a diameter of about 1.38 nm.<br>
Liu et al. (7) reported single-wall fullerene nanotubes that are converted<br>
from nearly endless, highly tangled ropes into short, open-ended pipes<br>
that behave as individual macromolecules. Also described therein is the<br>
termination of the open ends of the nanotubes with carboxylic acid<br>
groups after treatment in acid. This is followed by reaction with SOCb at<br>
room temperature to form the corresponding acid chloride.<br>
This single wall carbon nanotube has an outstanding strength of<br>
~37GPa, stiffness of -640 GPa, Young's modulus of ~ 2.8 to 3.6 TPa,<br>
specific gravity of ~ 1.30, electrical conductivity of ~ 106 S/m, thermal<br>
conductivity of ~ 2000 W/mK, specific surface area of 1350 m2/g, etc.<br>
Researchers are trying to utilize these outstanding properties through<br>
several roots.<br>
One group of researchers dispersed carbon nanotube into a wide range of<br>
polymeric materials to produce composites with unique properties<br>
ranging from high performance engineering materials to additives for<br>
accelerating chemical reactions. The dispersion is achieved by either<br>
shear mixing using a Haake Polylab unit or Brabender Labstation or by<br>
the use of a high energy ultrasonic probe when dispersion into a liquid is<br>
required. The polymeric materials are polyamine (8), polyether (8)<br>
bisphenol A (9), epoxy (10), poly(m-phenylene vinylene-co-2,5-dioctoxy-pphenylene<br>
vinylene (11), polymethylmethacrylate (12, 13), polyimide<br>
(14,15), poly(vinylidene fluoride) (16) and poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (16),<br>
acrylic polymers (17), fluoropolymers (17), polycarbonates (17),<br>
polycyanurates (17), polyesters (17), polysiloxanes (17), polyurethanes<br>
(17), polythiophenes (18), polyvinylcarbazole (19), polyimides (20),<br>
polysulfonamides (20), polythiophenylenes (20), polyureas (20),<br>
polyurethanes (20), elastomers (21), silicones (21), fluorinated polymers<br>
(21), polysulfones (22, 23), polyoxyalkylenes (24), etc.<br>
Another group of researchers (25-27) mixed carbon nanotube before<br>
polymerization of monomer to improve the dispersion of carbon nanotube<br>
into polymer matrix.<br>
Another group of researchers (28-36) mixed carbon nanotube into the<br>
precursor of fiber or polymer and then extrude into fiber for further<br>
improvement in dispersion of carbon nanotube into matrix material and<br>
to get the best mechanical properties.<br>
Another group of researchers wrote few review papers based on the<br>
carbon nanotube polymer composites (37-45).<br>
Because of their outstanding properties, further progress towards better<br>
distribution of carbon nanotube in matrix material is desirable.<br>
Keeping this in mind, the present invention is to synthesis carbon<br>
nanotube on the surface of carbon fiber to eliminate the problem of<br>
uneven distribution of carbon nanotube in the matrix material. This<br>
carbon nanotube coated carbon fiber will be used to make a polymer<br>
composite material for high tech application.<br>

The invention also provides compositions used to coat catalyst and<br>

microscopy, X-ray diffraction studies, storage modulus, loss modulus,<br>
loss tangent and thermal stability in various atmosphere, etc. have been<br>
conducted on appropriately designed specimens to characterize the<br>
materials.<br>
The hybrid nanocomposite is prepared in three steps, which are<br>
described below with the help of different embodiments, which are to be<br>
taken as example without restricting the scope of the invention to the<br>
same.<br>
(1) Coating of Catalyst on the Surface of Carbon Fiber/Fabric<br>
The preparation and deposition of catalyst on the substrate are critical<br>
steps. A uniform and optimum thickness of catalyst is essential to get a<br>
niform and good coating of carbon nanotubes through out the surface<br>
of carbon fiber/fabric.<br>
Embodiment-1<br>
Catalyst is coated on the surface of carbon fiber by dip coating technique<br>
using an acidic bath shown in Figure 1. The compositions of bath are<br>
given in Table 1. The bath is prepared by first dissolving the required<br>
amount of oxidizing agent in de-ionized water and subsequently other<br>
chemicals are added in the solution. The mixture is continuously stirred<br>
for -30 minutes to ensure the proper mixing of all chemicals. Finally this<br>
green colored solution is used in the dip-coating set-up, Figure 1 to<br>
deposit catalyst on the surface of carbon fiber/fabric. The coating is<br>
produced by the controlled chemical reduction of metallic ions onto a<br>
catalytic surface. For the further detail reference may be made to<br>
claim 20 and 21.<br>
After dipping the carbon fiber in the bath it is placed in an oven at a<br>
temperature of 100°C for -20 min.<br>
The temperature of electroless nickel solutions is one of the important<br>
factors affecting the rate of deposition. The rate of deposition is low at<br>
temperatures below 65°C, and increases with an increase in<br>
temperature. This is true for almost all the systems. The operating<br>
temperature for this study is about 65-75°C. All the elements of group<br>
VIb and VIII are applicable to this invention.<br>
Embodiment-2<br>
Metal catalyst is prepared by mixing of metal nitrate (for example iron<br>
nitrate) and metal carbonate (for example iron carbonate). 50 g of metal<br>
nitrate is dissolved in 500 ml of de-ionized water. When metal nitrate is<br>
fully dissolved in water, an equal amount of metal carbonate was added<br>
in the solution. The resulting brown colored solution is stirred<br>
continuously till it turned into a semi solid mass. This semisolid mass is<br>
kept in an oven at a temperature of 120°C for -12 hrs to vaporize all<br>
water. Then the resulting mass is kept in furnace at 500°C for 8 hrs.<br>
After cooling down to room temperature the brown colored mass was<br>
ground in an agate mortar. The resulting brown colored powder is used<br>
as catalyst to grow carbon nanotubes. The coating of this catalyst on the<br>
surface of carbon fiber/fabric is done by spraying the solution of brown<br>
colored powder. The solution was prepared by mixing the -10 g of<br>
powder in 500 ml of methyl alcohol. It is stirred at room temperature for<br>
-30 min. After spraying this solution on carbon fiber the fiber is placed<br>
in an oven at a temperature of 100°C for -30 min. For the further<br>
details reference may be made to claim 22.<br>
(2) Coating of Nanomaterials and Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) on the<br>
Surface of Carbon Fiber Fabric<br>
The coating of carbon nanotubes was conducted in a tubular reactor<br>
placed horizontally, and the schematic diagram of the experimental setup<br>
was shown in Figure 2. This reactor had a quartz tube of 84 cm length<br>
with outer diameter of 49 mm and inside diameter of 45 mm. It was<br>
constructed in such a way that the carbon fiber/fabric loaded quartz<br>
boat could be easily inserted and removed from the reactor. The reactor<br>
was heated in a three zone tubular furnace. A proportional temperature<br>
controller controls the furnace temperature in each zone. The<br>
temperature was kept around 700 to 900°C in the mid zone of furnace to<br>
facilitate the decomposition of precursor gases just above the quartz<br>
boat. The inlet and outlet temperatures were maintained at 300-600°C.<br>
Nitrogen, hydrogen, methane, ethane, propane, carbon dioxide, ethylene<br>
and acetylene were used as precursor gases. Each gas has its own<br>
function. Acetylene / methane / ethylene / propane / carbondioxide / ethane<br>
acts as a source of carbon, hydrogen acts as a reducing gas to reduce the<br>
catalytic layer and nitrogen acts as a carrier gas and also provides the<br>
inert atmosphere inside the reactor. The catalyst coated carbon<br>
fiber/fabric was kept in the middle zone of the reactor. The reactor was<br>
connected to a vacuum line and then pumped down to less than 200 mm<br>
Hg. The gases entered in the reactor through three different non-return<br>
valves. The flow rates of gases were measured by rotometers, as shown in<br>
Figure 2. Gases are first deoxygenated by passing them through an<br>
alkaline pyrogallol solution and subsequently moisture is removed by<br>
passing them through a silica gel bed. The gases were mixed before<br>
entering into the reactor. The water circulation arrangement was made at<br>
inlet and exit of the reactors tube to keep the temperature at desired<br>
level. Water is also used as a coolant in the condenser. Any condensable<br>
in the reactor effluent was collected in a liquid collector where as<br>
noncondensables were sent to the exit flow, which was recorded by the<br>
pressure indicator dial and then vented to the atmosphere. The different<br>
conditions used in each run to grow carbon nanotubes.<br>
Embodiment- I<br>
140 X 30 mm/mm catalyst coated fabric or catalyst coated carbon fiber<br>
having 3 to 300 micrometer in diameter is kept in a quartz boat. The<br>
fabric or fiber loaded quartz boat is inserted in a reactor shown in Figure<br>
2. As the reactor is connected to a vacuum line the gas of reactor was<br>
pumped down to less than 200 mm Hg to remove oxygen from the<br>
reactor, i.e., to make an inert atmosphere. After that nitrogen was<br>
inserted in the reactor. When it comes to the atmospheric pressure again<br>
it was pumped down to less than 200 mm Hg. This process is continued<br><br>
10 times till free of oxygen. In the next step the temperature of reactor<br>
was increased up to 600°C in an environment of nitrogen. The rate of<br>
nitrogen flow was kept constant at 120 ml/min. At this temperature the<br>
temperature of reactor is kept constant for 30 minutes to break the<br>
coating of catalyst to nanoparticles in nitrogen atmosphere. After 30<br>
minutes of holding time the reactor temperature is raised to 770°C in the<br>
same nitrogen atmosphere. When the temperature becomes constant at<br>
770°C, acetylene was allowed to flow at the rate of 25 ml/min along with<br>
the flow of nitrogen gas. The reaction was carried out at this temperature<br>
for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes of holding time the reactor was allowed<br>
to cool to room temperature and samples were taken out from the<br>
furnace for characterization of carbon nanotube and fabrication of<br>
nanocomposites.<br>
Embodiment- 2<br>
All conditions used in embodiment -1 of coating of nariomaterials and<br>
carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on the surface of carbon fiber/fabric are same<br>
except the growth time and the flow rate of acetylene. Flow rate of<br>
acetylene is kept at 25 ml/min. and the growth time is increased up to<br>
In this run the growth time is further increased to 30 min. All other<br>
conditions are same as embodiment -1 of coating of na.nomaterials and<br>
carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on the surface of carbon fiber/fabric.<br>
Embodiment -4<br>
In this condition to grow the carbon nanotubes on the surface of carbon<br>
fiber/fabric, the hydrogen gas is used as reducing gas to reduce the<br>
catalytic layer. Here, first the temperature of reactor is increased up to<br>
600°C in nitrogen atmosphere with a flow rate of 120 ml/min. Then the<br>
flow of H2 is started and kept constant at 15 ml/min. for 30 minutes to<br>
reduce the catalytic layer. After this the reactor is heated up to 800°C<br>
and the flow of acetylene is started and held constant at 25 ml/min. for<br>
25 minutes. At the end of reaction the reactor is allowed to cool to room<br>
temperature. After cooling the samples were removed from the furnace<br>
for characterization.<br>
(3) Fabrication of Polymer Hybrid Nanocomposites:<br>
Embodiment -1<br>
The carbon fabric is cut in right shape using the template from<br>
nanomaterial and carbon nanotube coated carbon fiber. The matrix used<br>
to prepare the hybrid nanocomposites is polyester resin. The weight ratio<br>
of polyester resin:catalyst:hardner is 100:2:2. Total number of layers<br>
used to prepare the hybrid nanocomposites was 3. The composite was<br>
prepared by conventional hand lay up technique. The preform was<br>
loaded in hydraulic press. The pressure cycle was 3.5 kg/cm2. The<br>
preform was allowed to cure at a temperature of 50°C for 16 hours. The<br>
volume fraction of fiber was -45%. After curing the hybrid<br>
nanocomposites were removed from hydraulic press and was used for the<br>
characterization of volume fraction of fibers, storage modulus, loss<br>
modulus, glass transition temperature, etc. Reference may be made to<br>
claim 2 for the fabrication of nanocomposite.<br>
Embodiment 2<br>
The carbon fabric is cut in right shape using the template from asreceived<br>
carbon fabric, i.e., uncoated carbon fabric. All other conditions<br>
are same as mentioned in embodiment 1 of fabrication of polymer hybrid<br>
nanocomposite.<br>
The potentially outstanding mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes<br>
(Young's modulus -1.25 TPa, Tensile strength -lOOGPa) will be of little<br>
value unless they can be incorporated in a matrix to make a composite<br>
material. Composite materials containing carbon fibers are, of course,<br>
lready widely used in application ranging from aerospace to sports<br>
equipments. In such materials the matrix can be plastic, epoxy, metal or<br>
carbon. The incorporation of carbon fiber into matrix not only confers<br>
strength and elasticity to the material but also greatly enhances<br>
toughness that is its ability to resist cracking. In this context the carbon<br>
nanotubes are an ideal candidate for further improvement of all these<br>
above properties in high performance composite structures. But the<br>
ability to disperse nanotubes into polymer is a major problem for<br>
controlling the properties. Nanotubes that are in clumps or agglomerated<br>
with other carbonaceous materials create defect and initiate failure. In<br>
addition, they limit the efficiency with which nanotubes carry load. This<br>
limitation has been illustrated explicitly in both polymer and ceramic<br>
matrix composites. In this scenario an attempt is made to grow the<br>
carbon nanotube on the surface of carbon fiber that will help to make a<br>
very strong composite material in the world. Keeping this in mind the<br>
carbon fiber was coated with various catalysts over a period of time,<br>
temperature and composition of bath using dip coating shown in Figure<br>
1. Now the catalyst coated carbon fiber was used to grow the<br>
nanomaterials and carbon nanotubes on its surface using a special type<br>
of reactor shown in Figure 2. During the growth of nanomaterials and<br>
carbon nanotube, the temperature, time and volumetric flow rate of<br>
carbon, containing gas, inert gas and reducing gas were varied. The<br>
carbon fiber, and nanomaterial and carbon nanotube coated carbon fiber<br>
were characterized through thermogravimetric analysis over a range of<br>
temperature, environment (i.e.oxygen and nitrogen) and heating rate;<br>
dynamic mechanical analysis; scanning electron microscopy;<br>
transmission electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction studies to find<br>
out optimum condition for formation of nanomaterial carbon nanotubes<br>
on the surface of carbon fiber.<br>
The compositions of coating solution are the major parameter affecting in<br>
the coating process of catalyst; however, in addition to this, other<br>
parameters like pH, temperature, bath loading factor, and the surface<br>
area of the substrate also affect the thickness of coating on the<br>
substrate. Four different types of compositions are studied in this work.<br>
The compositions of coating solution are summarized in Table 1. The<br>
catalyst-coated carbon fibers were characterized using XRD, SEM, TGA<br>
and DTA analysis. It was found that the coating was possible for the<br>
compositions 3 and 4 while in others (1 and 2) the coating was not<br>
possible.<br>
The nanomaterials and carbon nanotubes were coated on the<br>
surface of carbon fiber using hot furnace. After the coating of<br>
nanomaterials and carbon nanotubes on the surface of carbon fibers,<br>
XRD analysis was performed on the nanomaterials and carbon<br>
nanotubes coated carbon fibers to see the change in XRD pattern of<br>
carbon fibers. Figure 3 shows the XRD pattern of carbon fiber before and<br>
after the coating of nanomaterials and carbon nanotubes. The XRD<br>
pattern of nanomaterials coated carbon fiber is also included, here. The<br>
peak, around 20 = 26° is the characteristic peak of carbon fiber due to its<br>
graphitic structure. The location and broadness of this peak indicate that<br>
carbon fibers have a coke like character. The peak around 20-34° shows<br>
nanomaterials (Here it is nickel. Because nickel sulphate and sodium<br>
hypophosphite were used as an oxidizing and reducing agent to coat<br>
nickel on carbon fiber respectively). Figure 3 also shows that the carbon<br>
basal planes of the carbon structure are not changed by naiioscaled<br>
coating because not change in the nature of peak corresponding to 20=<br>
26°. The increase in noise is also observed after the growth of carbon<br>
nanotubes. But this noise may be because of the high temperature<br>
exposure of carbon fiber during the coating of nanomaterials and carbon<br>
nanotubes.<br>
Surface morphology of as-received carbon fiber, nanomaterials and<br>
carbon nano tube-coated carbon fiber has been analyzed through<br>
scanning electron microscope (SEM). The micrograph of as-received<br>
carbon fiber is shown in Figure 4. The fiber surface is very smooth and<br>
there is no pit mark on the surface of carbon fiber. The diameter- of<br>
carbon fibers is calculated from this micrograph. It is seen that the<br>
diameter of fibers at a magnification of 8000X is varied from 4 to 6 urn.<br>
Figure 5 shows EDAX analysis of as received carbon fiber.<br>
SEM micrographs of carbon fiber coated with nariomaterials and<br>
carbon nanotubes have been shown in Figure 6 at a magnification of<br>
3000. The micrograph shows a good and uniform coating of carbon fiber<br>
surface by nanomaterials and carbon nanotubes. To calculate the length<br>
and diameter of carbon nanotubes, a single strand of carbon nanotube is<br>
carefully chosen from Figure 4 and shown in Figure 7 at a magnification<br>
80000X. The length and diameter of the carbon nanotubes, measured<br>
from these micrographs is -15,000 nm and -40 nm respectively. Figure<br>
7 also shows that the carbon nanotube has a helical structure. This<br>
helical morphology comes from the anisotropic properties of catalyst<br>
particles. These observations are further supported by TEM analysis,<br>
which will be discussed in the next section.<br>
TEM study gives detailed information about the nanostructure of<br>
carbon nanotubes. Figure 8 shows a typical micrograph of as-received<br>
carbon fiber. This micrograph has been taken at a voltage of 120 kVA.<br>
The diameter calculated from this micrograph confirms the result<br>
obtained through SEM measurements. Figure 9 shows a TEM<br>
micrograph of carbon nanotube coated carbon fiber. It shows a rough<br>
surface as compared to the as-received carbon, fiber micrograph shown in<br>
Figure 8 because of the presence of carbon nanotubes on. the surface of<br>
carbon fiber. Another micrograph of carbon nanotube coated on the<br>
surface of carbon fiber is shown in Figure 10. It shows the bundles of<br>
carbon nanotubes. The kinks in the structure of carbon nanotube are<br>
also clearly visible in the micrograph. These kinks are may be due to the<br>
coiled structure, helical structure or presence of pentagon/ heptagon<br>
bonds in the structure of carbon nanotubes. The corresponding selective<br>
area diffraction (SAD) pattern is also shown in Figure 11. It shows the<br>
crystalline nature of carbon nanotubes. The ring patterns show that the<br>
carbon fibers are not only crystalline but. are also somewhat graphitic.<br>
The brightest ring corresponds to the (002) reflection of hexagonal<br>
graphite. The next continuous ring seen in the diffraction pattern<br>
corresponds to the (110) reflection of hexagonal graphite. There is no<br>
difference in the intensity for this particular diffracted ring, which<br>
suggests that there is no preferred orientation along the a*- or b*-axes. I t<br>
is observed from the micrographs that the nanotubes present near the<br>
carbon fiber surface contains more nanoparticles than the ones situated<br>
far from the surface i.e. there are more nanoparticles observed at the<br>
base of carbon nanotubes. This is may be because of base growth<br>
mechanism of carbon nanotubes where the metal nanoparticles remain<br>
at the base of growing nanotubes. This can be also observed from the<br>
micrographs shown in Figure 12. The diameter and length of carbon<br>
nanotubes measured from these micrographs and comes out. to be -40<br>
run and -15,000 nm respectively. This confirms the previous<br>
measurements done with the help of SEM micrographs (Figure 4). The<br>
rope like structure of bundles of carbon nanotubes can also be observed<br>
from these micrographs.<br>
The coating of nanomaterials and carbon nanotubes on the surface<br>
of carbon fiber is to be carried out at a temperature of 400-1500°C. TGA<br>
analysis of as-received carbon fiber, and coated carbon fiber is essential<br>
to know the degradation behavior of these fibers with respect to<br>
temperature and environment. The thermal analysis was carried out<br>
under nitrogen and oxygen environments over a temperature range of 50-<br>
900°C. The degradation behavior of as-received carbon fiber,<br>
nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes coated carbon fiber in nitrogen<br>
atmosphere is shown in Figure 13. There is a significant decrease in<br>
weight loss of carbon fibers observed after coating of nanoparticles and<br>
carbon nanotubes on its surface. It is decreased by -14% after the<br>
coating of nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes as compared to weight<br>
loss of as-received carbon fiber for the given temperature range of 900°C<br>
and nitrogen environment. The coated carbon fibers degrade very slowly<br>
through out the entire temperature range unlike the as-received carbon<br>
libers, which degrades at a faster rate after 300°C. To find out the<br>
degradation temperature where the rate of weight loss is maximum, a<br>
derivative curve i.e. weight loss with respect, to time was measured and<br>
shown in Figure 14. It shows the derivative (% weight/ minutes.) of asreceived<br>
carbon fiber, and nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes coated<br>
carbon fibers in nitrogen environment. The derivative curves for coated<br>
carbon fiber is almost a straight line and no peak is observed in the<br>
curves corresponding to these samples because the weight loss is<br>
gradual and very less through out the given temperature range of 900°C<br>
and environment (Figure 13).<br>
The DTA analysis of all these samples i.e. as-received carbon fiber,<br>
and nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes coated carbon fiber are shown<br>
in Figure 15. The heat flow first increases with an increase of<br>
temperature until a plateau is reached, i.e. the temperature of ~407"C for<br>
as-received carbon fibers and then starts decreasing on further<br>
increasing the temperature up to 900°C. The nature of degradation<br>
reaction is endothermic but the peak for the curves corresponding to<br>
nanomaterials and carbon nanotubes coated carbon fiber is shifted<br>
toward left i.e., ~380°C as compared to the curves corresponding to asreceived<br>
carbon fiber. The temperature corresponding to these peaks are<br>
given in Table 2. It is also observed from, this Figure 15 that the area<br>
enclosed by the curves corresponding to as-received carbon fiber is lower<br>
than the area enclosed by the curves corresponding nanomaterials and<br>
carbon nanotubes coated carbon fiber which suggests that the heat<br>
required by nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes coated carbon fibers is<br>
higher than as-received carbon fiber. This is may be because of the<br>
presence of nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes on the surface of<br>
carbon fiber in these samples. This requires extra heat to degrade these<br>
samples which results in larger heat flow for these samples. The1 same<br>
nature of heat flow curves indicates that the type of degradation reaction<br>
is same.<br>
The degradation reaction depends on the environment. To<br>
understand the stability of nanomaterials and carbon nanotubes coated<br>
carbon fiber, TGA analysis is carried out for as-received carbon fiber and<br>
nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes coated carbon fiber in oxygen<br>
atmosphere. The results are shown in Figure 16. The thermal stability is<br>
more for nanomaterials and carbon nanotubes coated carbon fiber. The<br>
starting degradation temperature is found to be ~600°C. The sudden<br>
fluctuation in temperature is also found in TGA analysis of nanoparticles<br>
and carbon nanotubes coated carbon fibers in oxygen atmosphere as<br>
shown in Figure 16. The derivative of weight loss with respect to time as<br>
a function of temperature for as-received carbon fiber and nanoparticles<br>
and carbon nanotubes coated carbon fiber is shown in Figure 17. The<br>
degradation temperature for as-received carbon fiber is observed at<br>
~560°C in oxygen atmosphere. But the degradation temperature for<br>
nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes coated carbon fiber is ~700°C. This<br>
indicates the higher thermal stability of this coated fiber as compared to<br>
as-received carbon fiber sample.<br>
The DTA analysis of as-received carbon, fiber, and nanoparticles<br>
and carbon nanotubes coated carbon fiber in oxygen environment is<br>
shown in Figure 18. It follows the same endotherrnic trend as observed<br>
earlier. The peak temperature is tabulated in Table 3.<br>
A small secondary peak is also observed iri the heat flow curves.<br>
This peak is due to the change in microstructure as shown in weight, loss<br>
curves (Figure 16). To analyze this statement the heat flow data is<br>
plotted with respect to time and shown in Figure 19. The nature of the<br>
peak is same as shown in Figure 18.<br>
To evaluate the performance of hybrid nanocomposite the dynamic<br>
mechanical analysis was carried out. The analysis was done within a<br>
temperature range of 30-170°C and at a frequency of 1 Hz under bending<br>
mode. The variation of storage modulus with respect to temperature is<br>
shown in Figure 20. A significant improvement is observed in storage<br>
modulus for nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes coated carbon fiber<br>
hybrid nanocomposite as compared to as-received carbon fiber<br>
composites. The storage modulus for nanoparticles and carbon<br>
nanotubes coated carbon fiber hybrid nanocomposite found to be<br>
increased by -75% at a temperature of 30°C. The storage modulus<br>
decreases with an increase in temperature but at any temperature the<br>
storage modulus is higher for nanomaterials and carbon nanotubes<br>
coated carbon fibers hybrid nanocomposites as compared to as-received<br>
carbon fiber composites. Now the improvement in storage modulus is<br>
explained with respect to the relative storage modulus. This relative<br>
storage modulus is defined as the modulus ratio of coated to as-received<br>
carbon fiber. Figure 21 shows the relative storage modulus of<br>
nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes coated carbon fiber hybrid<br>
nanocomposite with respect, to storage modulus of as-received, carbon<br>
fiber. The relative storage modulus increases with increasing<br>
temperature through out the temperature range of 90°C for<br>
nanomaterials and carbon nanotube coated carbon fiber hybrid<br>
nanocomposite respectively. Then it decreases with an increase in<br>
temperature. The increase in modulus can be explained by the<br>
increase in kinetic energy (G = v k T) where G, v, k and T are modulus,<br>
cross link density, Boltzmann's constant and temperature respectively.<br>
But the decrease in modulus with respect to temperature is due to the<br>
decrease in intermolecular force of attraction in composite materials. In<br>
addition to this the decrease of coefficient of friction between molecules<br>
decreases the modulus value a higher temperatures.<br>
The variation of loss modulus and relative loss modulus with<br>
increasing temperature is shown in Figures 22 and 23 respectively. The<br>
loss modulus for nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes coated carbon<br>
fiber hybrid nanocomposite is higher than the as-received carbon fiber<br>
composite at each, temperature. It is also observed that the loss modulus<br>
reduces with increasing temperature for nanoparticles and carbon<br>
nanotubes coated carbon fiber hybrid nanocomposite and as-received<br>
carbon fiber composite. The same nature is also observed in relative loss<br>
modulus data for all these composites (Figure 23).<br>
Figure 24 shows the variation of Tan 8 with respect to temperature<br>
for as-received carbon fiber composite, and nanoparticles and carbon<br>
nanotubes coated carbon fiber hybrid nanocomposite. The value of Tan f&gt;<br>
first increases with an increase in temperature and then decreases on<br>
further increasing the temperature. For as-received carbon fiber the Tan<br>
8 increases up to a temperature of ~80°C and then starts decreasing as<br>
temperature is further increased, whereas for nanoparticles and carbon<br>
nanotubes coated carbon fiber hybrid nanocomposites it occurs at a<br>
temperature of ~65°C. The peak corresponding to this temperature is<br>
glass transition temperature (Tg). The glass transition temperature of all<br>
these composites has been listed in Table 4. It is observed from the<br>
Table 4 that the glass transition temperature of polyester carbon fiber<br>
composite deceases after the coating of nanoparticless and carbon<br>
nanotubes on the surface of carbon fiber.<br>
Main advantages of the Invention;<br>
Advantage 1: This is the first time in the world we have prepared hybrid<br>
nanocomposites using long carbon fiber coated with nanomaterials i.e.<br>
various type of metals, i.e., cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), ruthenium (Ru),<br>
rhodium (Rh), palladium (Pd), iridium (Ir), platinum (Pt) chromium (Cr),<br>
tungsten (W); and carbon nanotubes on the surface of carbon fiber and<br>
going to report in the literature.<br>
Advantage 2: In case of conventional composite materials it is very<br>
tough/difficult to disperse the nanomaterials in the matrix. If it is carbon<br>
nanotube again it is difficult due to its lightweight. Keeping this in mind<br>
we have developed a process where distribution of nanomaterials and<br>
carbon nanotube is uniform through out the surface of carbon fiber. This<br>
carbon nanotube coated carbon fiber could be used to make any<br>
composite materials for structural application.<br>
Advantage 3: It is possible to get a uniform coating of nanoma.teria.ls<br>
i.e., cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), ruthenium (Ru), rhodium (Rh), palladium<br>
(Pd), iridium (Ir), platinum (Pt) chromium (Cr), tungsten (W) on the<br>
surface of individual long carbon fiber in the range of 1 to 80 nm.<br>
Advantage 4: Even though it is possible to get a uniform coating of<br>
mixed nanomaterials i.e., combination of any two of the following metals,<br>
i.e., cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), ruthenium (Ru), rhodium (Rh), palladium<br>
(Pd), iridium (Ir), platinum (Pt) chromium (Cr), tungsten (W) on the<br>
surface of individual long carbon fiber in the range of 1 to 80 nm.<br>
Advantage 5: It is possible to get a uniform coating of carbon<br>
nanotube on the surface of individual long carbon fiber in the density<br>
range of 1 to 90%.<br>
Advantage 6: It is possible to get a uniform coating of carbon<br>
nanotube on the surface of individual long carbon fiber in the density<br>
range of 1 to 80%.<br>
Advantage 7: The length of carbon nanotubes on the surface of carbon<br>
fiber can be varied within the range of 10 to 20,000 nm.<br>
Advantage 8: The diameter of carbon nanotubes on the surface of<br>
carbon fiber within the range of 1 to 40 nm.<br>
Advantage 9: The carbon nanotube grown on the surface of carbon fiber<br>
is helical in structure. This helical structure helps to improve the strain<br>
at breaking point of composite materials. This is again another<br>
breakthrough.<br>
Advantage 10: The thermal stability of nanomaterial and carbon<br>
nanotube coated carbon fiber has been improved significantly. 1.5%<br>
weight loss is observed when the carbon fiber is coated with carbon<br>
nanotube in the temperature range of 25 to 900°C in nitrogen<br>
atmosphere where as 16% in the uncoated carbon fiber.<br>
Advantage 11: The storage modulus of hybrid nanocomposites prepared<br>
by carbon nanotube coated carbon fiber at room temperature, i.e., 25°C<br>
is improved by 75% with respect to the uncoated carbon fiber. Where as<br>
at high temperature, i.e., 150°C the improvement is 300% with respect to<br>
the uncoated carbon fiber's composites.<br>
Advantage 12: Generally storage modulus decreases with increasing<br>
temperature. This is a conventional fact in case of all composite<br>
materials. But when the carbon fiber is coated with nanomaterials and<br>
carbon nanotube, storage modulus increases with increasing<br>
temperatures upto 100°C.<br>
Advantage 13: 50% improvement in loss modulus is observed in hybrid<br>
nanocomposites when the carbon fiber is coated with carbon nanotube.<br>
Advantage 14: 50% improvement in damping is observed in hybrid<br>
nanocomposites when the carbon fiber is coated with carbon nanotube.<br>
Advantage 15: The glass temperature of hybrid nanocomposite is shifted<br>
to the high temperature, ie., from 65 to 85°C when the carbon fiber is<br>
coated with carbon nanotube.<br>
Advantage 16: This fabrication process of hybrid nanocomposites is an<br>
insitu process. As it is insitu process, this technique does not require<br>
any mixer, which is very costly equipment in conventional process.<br>
Advantage 17: The processing cost is less as it does not require mixture<br>
compared to the conventional process.<br>
Advantage 18: The new technique has a great potential in the<br>
manufacture of fiber reinforced nanocomposites for high tech<br>
applications, i.e., aerospace, automobile, etc.<br>
This new hybrid nanocomposites has promise for wide range of<br>
applications, viz., automobile, aircraft, space craft, sports, etc.<br>
ddering the current and future needs it is the interest to initiate a<br>
ig research programme in this area to foster the industries to adopt<br>
;r processing routes for manufacturing their products with superior<br>
ifications and also introduce new products based on unique<br>
ierties of this class of new generation materials. Again due to the<br>
lability of various types of high molecular weight polymers, in near<br>
re this advanced hybrid materials is likely to increase the production<br>
her reinforced plastic components satisfactorily. This will in turn<br>
ance the interest of laboratories and industries. Further, fiber<br>
forced plastic technology is labor incentive and India is in a much<br>
er shape to compete with developed countries<br>
main advantage of this invention is that use can be made of the<br>
standing mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes i.e. Young's<br>
lules of-1.25 TPa, and Tensile strength of -100 GPa in a structural hybrid<br>
icomposites. In this invention it does not need to add carbon nanotube during the<br>
cation of nanocomposite in the polymer matrix which is much more difficult to<br>
disperse in the matrix. In addition to this the carbon nanotube is grown on the surface of<br>
carbon fiber, i.e. it is an insitu process. The resulting hybrid nanocomposite shows<br>
excellent thermal stability and mechanical properties.<br>
It is to be understood that the process of the present invention is<br>
susceptible to modification, changes, adaptations by those skilled in the<br>
art. Such modifications, changes adaptations are intended to be within,<br>
the scope of the present invention which is further set forth under the<br>
