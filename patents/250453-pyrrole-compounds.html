PYRROLE COMPOUNDS AS INIBITORS OF ERK PROTEIN KINASE, SYNTHESIS THEREOF AND INTERMEDIATES THERETO<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims priority to United States Provisional Patent Application 60/571,309 filed May 14, 2004, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to compounds useful as inhibitors of protein kinases. The invention also provides pharmaceutically acceptable compositions comprising the compounds of the invention and methods of using the compositions in the treatment of various disorders.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] The search for new therapeutic agents has been greatly aided in recent years by a better understanding of the structure of enzymes and other biomolecules associated with target diseases. One important class of enzymes that has been the subject of extensive study is protein kinases.<br>
[0004] Protein kinases constitute a large family of structurally related enzymes that are responsible for the control of a variety of signal transduction processes within the cell (See, Hardie, G. and Hanks, S. (1995) The Protein Kinase Facts Book, I and II, Academic Press, San Diego, CA). Protein kinases are thought to have evolved from a common ancestral gene due to the conservation of their structure and catalytic function. Almost all kinases contain a similar 250-300 ammo acid catalytic domain. The kinases may be categorized into families by the substrates they phosphorylate (e.g., protein-tyrosine, protdn-serine/threonine, lipids, etc.). Sequence motifs have been identified that generally correspond to each of these kinase families (See, for example, Hanks, S.K., Hunter, T., FASEB I, 9:576-596 (1995); Knighton et al.,<br>
I<br><br>
WO 2005/113541	PCT/US2005/016902<br>
Science, 253:407-414 (1991); Hiles et al., Cell, 70:419-429 (1992); Kunz et al., 0611,73:585-596 (1993); Garcia-Bustos et al., EMBO J., 13:2352-2361 (1994)). [0005] In general, protein kinases mediate intracellular signaling by effecting a phosphoiyl transfer from a nucleoside triphosphate to a protein acceptor that is involved in a signaling pathway. These phosphorylation events act as molecular on/off switches that can modulate or regulate the target protein biological function. These phosphorylation events are ultimately triggered in response to a variety of extracellular and other stimuli. Examples of such stimuli include environmental and chemical stress signals (e.g., osmotic shock, heat shock, ultraviolet radiation, bacterial endotoxin, and H2O2), cyto]dnes (e.g., interleukin-1 (TL-1) and tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a)), and growth factors (e.g., granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)). An extracellular stimulus may affect one or more cellular responses related to cell growth, migration, differentiation, secretion of hormones, activation of transcription factors, muscle contraction, glucose metabolism, control of protein synthesis, and regulation of the cell cycle. [0006] Many diseases are associated with abnormal cellular responses triggered by protein kinase-mediated events. These diseases include autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, bone diseases, metabolic diseases, neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, allergies and asthma, Alzheimer's disease and hormone-related diseases. Accordingly, there has been a substantial effort in medicinal chemistry to find protein kinase inhibitors that are effective as therapeutic agents. However, considering the lack of currently available treatment options for the majority of the conditions associated with protein kinases, there is still a great need for new therapeutic agents that inhibit these protein targets. [0007] Mammalian cells respond to extracellular stimuli by activating signaling cascades that are mediated by members of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase family, which include the extracellular signal regulated kinases (ERKs), the p38 MAP kinases and the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JTSTKs). MAP kinases (MAPKs) are activated by a variety of signals including growth factors, cytokines, UV radiation, and stress-inducing agents. MAPKs are serine/threonine kinases and their activation occur by dual phosphorylation of threonine and tyrosine at the Thr-X-Tyr segment in the activation loop. MAPKs phosphorylate various substrates including transcription factors, which in turn regulate the expression of specific sets of genes and thus mediate a specific response to the stimulus.<br>

10008] ERK2 is a widely distributed protein kinase that achieves maximum activity when both Thrl 83 :uid Tyrl 85 are phosphorylated by the upstream MAP kinase kinase, MEK1 (Anderson et aL, 1990, Nature 343, 651; Crews et al., 1992, Science 258, 478). Upon activation, ERK2 phosphorylates many regulatory proteins, including the protein kinases Rsk90 (Bjorbaek et al., 1995, J. Biol. Chem. 270, 18848) and MAPKAP2 (Rouse et al., 1994, Cell 78,1027), and transcription factors such as ATF2 (Raingeaud et al., 1996, Mol. Cell Biol. 16,1247), Elk-1 (Raingeaud et al. 1996), c-Fos (Chen et al., 1993 Proc, Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90, 10952), and c-Myc (Oliver et al., 1995, Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 210,162). ERK2 is also a downstream target of the Ras/Raf dependent pathways (Moodie et al., 1993, Science 260, 1658) and relays the signals from these potentially oncogenic proteins. ERK2 has been shown to play a role in the negative growth control of breast cancer cells (Frey and Mulder, 1997, Cancer Res. 57, 628) and hyperexpression of ERK2 in human breast cancer has been reported (Sivaraman et al., 1997, J Clin. Invest. 99, 1478). Activated ERK2 has also been implicated in the proliferation of endothelin-stimulated airway smooth muscle cells, suggesting a role for this kinase in asthma (Whelchel et al., 1997, Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 16, 589). [0009] Overexpression of receptor tyrosine kinases such as EGFR and ErbB2 (Arteaga CL, 2002, Semin Oncol. 29, 3-9; Eccles SA, 2001, J Mammary Gland Biol Neoplasia 6:393-406; Mendelsohn J &amp; Baselga J, 2000, Oncogene 19, 6550-65), as well as activating mutations; in the Ras GTPase proteins (Nottage M &amp; Siu LL, 2002, Curr Pharm Des 8, 2231-42; Adjei AA, 2001, J Natl Cancer Inst 93, 1062-74) or B-Raf mutants (Davies H. et al., 2002, Nature 417, 949-54; Brose et al., 2002, Cancer Res 62, 6997-7000) are major contributors to human cancer. These genetic alterations are correlated with poor clinical prognosis and result in activation of the Raf-1/2/3 -MEK1/2 - ERK1/2 signal transduction cascade in a broad panel of human tumors. Activated ERK (i.e. ERK1 and/or ERK2) is a central signaling molecule that has been associated with the control of proliferation, differentiation, anchorage-independent cell survival, and angiogenesis, contributing to a number of processes that are important for the formation and progression of malignant tumors. These data suggest that an ERK1/2 inhibitor will exert pleiotropic activity, including proapoptotic, anti-proliferative, anti-metastatic and anti-angiogenic effects, and offer a therapeutic opportunity against a very broad panel of human tumors.<br>

WO 2005/113541	PCT/US2005/016902<br>
[0010] There is a growing body of evidence that implicates constitutive activation of the ERJEC MAPK pathway in the oncogenic behavior of select cancers. Activating mutations of Ras are found in -30% of all cancers, with some, such as pancreatic (90%) and colon (50%) cancer, harboring particularly high mutation rates (ref). Ras mutations have also been identified in 9-15% of melanomas, but B-Raf somatic missense mutations conferring constitutive activation are more frequent and found in 60-66% malignant melanomas. Activating mutations of Ras, Raf and MEK are able to oncogenically transform flbroblasts in vitro, and Ras or Raf mutations in conjunction with the loss of a tumor suppressor gene (e.g. pl6INK4A) can cause spontaneous tumor development in vivo. Increased ERIC activity has been demonstrated in these models and has also been widely reported in appropriate human tumors. In melanoma, high basal ERK activity resulting from either B-Raf or N-Ras mutations or autocrine growth factor activation is well documented and has been associated with rapid tumor growth, increased cell survival and resistance to apoptosis. Additionally, ERK activation is considered a major driving force behind the highly metastatic behavior of melanoma associated with increased expression of both extracellular matrix degrading proteases and invasion-promoting integrins as well as the downregulation of E-cadherin adhesion molecules that normally mediate keratinocyte interactions to control melanocyte growth. These data taken together, indicate ERK as promising therapeutic target for the treatment of melanoma, a currently unbeatable disease.<br>

[0016] As used herein, the term "prodrug" refers to a derivative of a parent drug molecule that requires transformation within the body in order to release the active drug, and that has improved! physical and/or delivery properties over the parent drug molecule. Prodrugs are designed to enhance pharmaceutically and/or pharmacokinetically based properties associated with the parent drug molecule. The advantage of a prodrug lies in its physical properties, such as enhanced water solubility for parenteral administration at physiological pH compared to the parent drug, or it enhances absorption from the digestive tract, or it may enhance drug stability for long-term storage. In recent years several types of bioreversible derivatives have been exploited for utilization in designing prodrugs. Using esters as a prodrug type for drugs containing carboxyl or hydroxyl function is known in the art as described, for example, in "The Organic Chemistry of Drug Design and Drug Interaction" Richard Silverman, published by Academic Press (1992). [0017] As described herein, compounds of the invention may optionally be substituted with one or more substituents, such as are illustrated generally above, or as exemplified by particular classes, subclasses, and species of the invention. It will be appreciated that the phrase "optionally substituted" is used interchangeably with the phrase "substituted or unsubstituted." In general, the term "substituted", whether preceded by the term "optionally'5 or not, refers to the replacement of hydrogen radicals in a given structure with the radical of a specified substituent. Unless otherwise indicated, an optionally substituted group may have a substituent at each substitutable position of the group, and when more than one position in any given structure may be substituted with more than one substituent selected from a specified group, the substituent may be either the same or different at every position. [0018] Combinations of substituents envisioned by this invention are preferably those that result in the formation of stable or chemically feasible compounds. The term "stable", as used herein, refers to compounds that are not substantially altered when subjected to conditions to allow for their production, detection, and preferably their recovery, purification, and use for one or more of the purposes disclosed herein.<br>

[0034] The compounds of this invention may be prepared or isolated in general by synthetic and/or pseudo-synthetic methods known to those skilled in the art for analogous compounds and as illustrated by the general Schemes I, U and IIIbelow and the preparative examples that follow.<br>

WO 2005/113541	PCT/US2005/016902<br>
Reagents and conditions; (a) i Id, CH2CL2) ii NaOMe, MeOH; (b) PG-CI, DMAP, triethylamine; (c) Pd(dppf); (d) R]-NH2; (e) Pd(PPh3)4) 4; (f) deprotection/saponification; (g) coupling conditions.<br>
[0035] General Scheme I above shows a general method for preparing the compounds of the present invention. At step (a), the pyrrole compound 1 is iodinated and esterified to form 2. At step (b)., the pyrrole moiety is optionally protected at the -NH- with a suitable amino protecting group to form 3. Amino protecting groups are well known in the art and are described in detail in Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, Theodora W. Greene and Peter G. M. Wuts, 1991, published by John Wiley and Sons, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference. The iodo moiety of compound 3 is displaced by an appropriate boronic acid or ester. As depicted above, bis(pinacolato)diborane is used to form compound 4 however other boronic esters or acids are amenable to this reaction and would be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
[0036] Because the present compounds relate to a multi-substituted pyridine moiety, the order of reaction is considered and methods of activating positions on the<br>
I3<br><br>
WO 2005/113541	PCT/US2005/016902<br>
pyridine are utilized to direct the regiochemistry. In step (d) above, the first leaving group L' may be displaced by an alcohol, amine or thiol as desired. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that various L1 leaving groups are amenable to this reaction. Examples of such .groups include, but are not limited to, halogen and activated ethers. This reaction may be followed, at step (e), by the replacement of a second leaving group L2 through either a metal catalyzed coupling reaction or a nucleophilic displacement to form compound 7. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that various L2 leaving groups are amenable to this reaction. Examples of such groups include, but are not limited to, halogen, activated ethers, boronic acid, or boronic ester.<br>
[0037] At step (f), the protecting group on the pyrrole moiety is removed by methods suitable for removing the amino protecting group used. Depending on which ammo protecting group is used, the conditions suitable for removing it may simultaneously saponify or otherwise provide the carboxylate moiety as depicted above for compound 8. If the; conditions suitable for removing the amino protecting group are not suitable for prodding the carboxylate compound 8, then another step may be employed. Compounds of formula I are prepared from 8 by coupling the resulting carboxylate with a desired amine as depicted at step (g). One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that a variety of conditions are useful for said coupling reaction and can include the step of activating the carboxylate moiety of compound 8 prior to or simultaneously with treatment with the desired amine. Such conditions include, but are not limited to, those described in detail in the Examples section below.<br><br>
Reagents and conditions: (a) Ac2O/H2O2; (b) HNO3/H2SO4; (c) R'-NH2; (d) L2. [0038] Scheme U above depicts an alternate route to prepare intermediate compound 6 useful for preparing compounds of the present invention. At step (a), the N-oxide of compound 9 is prepared by treatment with peroxide. The N-oxide<br>
14<br><br>
WO 2005/113541	PCT/US2005/016902<br>
compound 10 is then treated with nitric acid to form the nitro compound 11. The L1 group of 11 is displaced with the desired amine R'-NIfe to form 12 and then the L2 group is introduced at step (d) to afford intermediate 6. Compound 6 may then be utilized to prepare compounds of the present invention according to the general Scheme I above and the Examples provided below.<br><br>
[0039] Scheme m above shows an alternate method for preparing compound 7 from 6. In this method, the L group of the pyridinyl compound 6 is displaced by an appropriate boronic acid or ester derivative to form 13, wherein Rx and Ry have the meanings as defined for compounds of formula A infra. This boronate moiety is then displaced by the L3 leaving group of the pyrrole depicted above, wherein L3 is a suitable leaving group, to form compound 7. Compound 7 is then used to prepare compounds of the present invention by methods set forth above in Schemes I and II, by those described in the Examples section and by methods known to one of ordinary skill in the art<br>

[0011] In order to prolong the effect of a compound of the present invention, it is often desirable to slow the absorption of the compound from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the compound then depends upon its rate of dissolution that, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered compound form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the compound in an oil vehicle. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the compound in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of compound to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of compound release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the compound in liposomes or microemulsions that are compatible with body tissues. [0012] Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable non-irritating excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which are solid at ambient temperature but liquid at body<br>

[0096] Compounds are assayed for the inhibition of ERK1 by a spectrophotometric coupled-enzyme assay (Fox et al (1998) Protein Sci 7,2249). In this assay, a fixed concentration of activated ERK1 (20 nM) is incubated with various concentrations of the compound in DMSO (2.0 %) for 10 minutes at 30°C in 0.1 M HEPES buffer, pH 7.6, containing 10 mM MgCl2, 2.5 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 200<br>
#####M NADH, 30 Ug/mL pyruvate kinase, 10 ####g/mL lactate dehydrogenase, and 150 ###M erktide peptide. The reaction is initiated by the addition of 140 uM ATP (20####L). The rate of decrease of absorbance at 340 nM is monitored. The K; is evaluated from the rate data as a function of inhibitor concentration.<br>
