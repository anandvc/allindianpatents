				<td>MRI BIOPSY DEVICE<br>
Cross Reference to Related Applications<br>
The present application is a continuation in part of U.S. Pat. Appln. Ser. No. 11/103,959,<br>
"MRI BIOPSY DEVICE LOCALIZATION FIXTURE" to Hughes et al., filed on 12<br>
April 2005, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates, in general, to a method of imaging assisted tissue sampling<br>
and, more particularly, to an improved method for positioning a biopsy probe with respect<br>
to a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) breast coil for acquiring subcutaneous biopsies<br>
and for removing lesions.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Core biopsy devices have been combined with imaging technology to better target a lesion in<br>
breast tissue. One such commercially available product is marketed under the trademark<br>
name MAMMOTOMEâ„¢, by Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. An embodiment of such a<br>
device is described in U.S. Patent No. 5,526,822 issued to Burbank, et al., on June 18,<br>
1996, and is hereby incorporated herein by reference. Its handle receives mechanical and<br>
electrical power as well as vacuum assist from a remotely positioned control module that<br>
is spaced away from the high magnetic field of a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)<br>
machine.<br>
As seen from that reference, the instrument is a type of image-guided, percutaneous coring,<br>
breast biopsy instrument. It is vacuum-assisted, and some of the steps for retrieving the<br>
tissue samples have been automated. The physician uses this device to capture "actively"<br>
(using the vacuum) the tissue prior to severing it from the body. This allows the sampling<br>
of tissues of varying hardness. In addition, a side opening aperture is used, avoiding<br>
having to thrust into a lesion, which may tend to push the mass away, cause a track<br>
metastasis, or cause a hematoma that, with residual contrast agent circulating therein, may<br>
mimic enhancement in a suspicious lesion. The side aperture may be rotated about a<br>
longitudinal axis of the probe, thereby allowing multiple tissue samples without having to<br>
otherwise reposition the probe. These features allow for substantial sampling of large<br>
lesions and complete removal of small ones.<br>
1.<br>
 <br>
Vacuum assisted core biopsy devices have been adapted to be safe and compatible with<br>
various imaging modalities, including Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). In particular,<br>
portions of a biopsy system placed near the magnet core of an MRI machine need to be<br>
nonresponsive to the strong magnetic field to prevent becoming drawn toward the magnet<br>
core or to malfunction. Further, the MRI machine depends upon sensing extremely weak<br>
radio frequency (RF) signals emanated by tissue after being excited by a strong change in<br>
the magnetic field. Components placed in the RF shielded MRI suite need to avoid<br>
producing electromagnetic interference (EMI) and need to avoid having materials that<br>
would distort RF signals sufficient to create artifacts in the MRI scan data.<br>
A successful approach has been to segregate motive power generation, graphical user<br>
interface, vacuum assist, and closed loop control in a control module that has typically<br>
been placed about 6 feet away from the magnet core to mitigate detrimental interaction<br>
with its strong magnetic field and/or sensitive radio frequency (RF) signal detection<br>
antennas. An intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) provides a range of preprogrammed<br>
functionality incorporated into a control module to efficiently use time in an MRI suite to<br>
take tissue samples.<br>
As an example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,752,768, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by<br>
reference in its entirety, a control button may be depressed to change a mode of operation<br>
of a core biopsy device with this mode displayed remotely on a display.<br>
While a full function GUI has numerous clinical benefits, the clinician may find the control<br>
module inconveniently remote during hands-on portions of the procedure. In addition,<br>
some MRI machines have such increased sensitivity and/or increased magnet field<br>
strength that it is desirable to increase the distance of the control monitor (e.g., 30 feet)<br>
from the MRI machine. Further, even if the control monitor is sufficiently close, some<br>
clinicians prefer a simplified user interface to simplify training familiarity.<br>
Consequently, a significant need exists for a biopsy system compatible for use in an MRI<br>
suite with biopsy controls with enhanced convenience and intuitiveness.<br>
Brief Summary of the Invention<br>
The invention overcomes the above-noted and other deficiencies of the prior art by providing<br>
a handpiece of a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compatible core biopsy system that<br>
2.<br>
 <br>
includes a graphical user interface that facilitates user control even with vacuum, power<br>
generation, and control processing components remotely positioned away from the MRI<br>
magnet and sensitive radio frequency (RF) receiving components. Thereby, a clinician<br>
may have the full functionality of vacuum assisted core biopsy systems yet not be<br>
inconvenienced by the distance from a remotely positioned control module.<br>
These and other objects and advantages of the present invention shall be made apparent from<br>
the accompanying drawings and the description thereof.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
An MRI biopsy device advantageously includes is partially disposable for sterility purposes<br>
with a reusable portion for economy. Inconvenience of mechanical, electrical, and<br>
pneumatical coupling to a remotely placed control portion, necessitated by a strong<br>
magnetic field and sensitive RF receiving components of an MRI machine, is mitigated.<br>
First, proximal detachable intuitive controls and displays on the MRI biopsy device give<br>
interactive control even after insertion into localizing and guiding structures. Second,<br>
binding of mechanical coupling to the MRI biopsy device is sensed prior to equipment<br>
damage or malfunction. Third, mechanical coupling is moved closer to engagement<br>
points between the MRI biopsy device and guiding structures to reduce torque loads,<br>
especially those transferred through its distal probe. Fourth, a single mechanical drive<br>
cable drives a fixed ratio transmission that translates and rotates a cutter of the distal<br>
4.<br>
 <br>
probe to realize an effective fixed ratio translation/rotation sampling cut without the<br>
encumbrance of two mechanical drive cables.<br>
Turning to the Drawings, wherein like numerals denote like components throughout the<br>
several views, in FIGS. 1-3, a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) compatible biopsy<br>
system 10 has a control module 12 that typically is placed outside of a shielded room<br>
containing an MRI machine (not shown) or at least spaced away to mitigate detrimental<br>
interaction with its strong magnetic field and/or sensitive radio frequency (RF) signal<br>
detection antennas. As described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,752,768, which is hereby incorporated<br>
by reference in its entirety, a range of preprogrammed functionality is incorporated into<br>
the control module 12 to assist in taking these tissue samples. The control module 12<br>
controls and powers an MRI biopsy device ("handpiece") 14 that is positioned and guided<br>
by a localization fixture 16 attached to a breast coil 18 that is placed upon a gantry (not<br>
shown) of the MRI machine.<br>
A cable management spool 20 is placed upon a cable management attachment saddle 22 that<br>
projects from a side of the control module 12. Wound upon the cable management spool<br>
20 is a paired electrical cable 24 and mechanical cable 26 which are bundled into<br>
sheathed cable 27 for communicating control signals and cutter rotation/advancement<br>
motions respectively. In particular, electrical and mechanical cables 24, 26 each have one<br>
end connected to respective electrical and mechanical ports 28, 30 in the control module<br>
12 and another end connected to a reusable holster portion 32 of the MRI biopsy device<br>
14. An MRI docking cup 34, which may hold the holster portion 32 when not in use, is<br>
hooked to the control module 12 by a docking station mounting bracket 36.<br>
An interface lock box 38 mounted to a wall provides a tether 40 to a lockout port 42 on the<br>
control module 12. The tether 40 is advantageously uniquely terminated and of short<br>
length to preclude inadvertent positioning of the control module 12 too close to the MRI<br>
machine. An in-line enclosure 44 may advantageously register the tether 40, electrical<br>
cable 24 and mechanical cable 26 to their respective ports 42, 28, 30 on the control<br>
module 12.<br>
Vacuum assist is provided by a first vacuum line 46 that connects between the control<br>
module 12 and an outlet port 48 of a vacuum canister 50 that catches liquid and solid<br>
debris. A tubing kit 52 completes the pneumatic communication between the control<br>
5.<br>
 <br>
module 12 and the MRI biopsy device 14. In particular, a second vacuum line 54 is<br>
connected to an inlet port 56 of the vacuum canister 50. The second vacuum line 54<br>
divides into two vacuum lines 58, 60 that are attached to the MRI biopsy device 14. With<br>
the MRI biopsy device 14 installed in the holster portion 32, the control module 12<br>
performs a functional check. Saline is manually injected into biopsy device 14 to serve as<br>
a lubricant and to assist in achieving a vacuum seal. The control module 12 actuates a<br>
cutter mechanism (not shown) in the MRI biopsy device 14, monitoring full travel.<br>
Binding in the mechanical cable 26 or within the biopsy device 14 is monitored with<br>
reference to motor force exerted to turn the mechanical cable 26 and/or an amount of<br>
twist in the mechanical cable 26 sensed in comparing rotary speed or position at each end<br>
of the mechanical cable 26.<br>
Just proximal to a display area 61 on the reusable holster portion 32, a remote keypad 62,<br>
which is detachable from the reusable holster portion 32, communicates via the electrical<br>
cable 24 to the control module 12 to enhance clinician control of the MRI biopsy device<br>
14, especially when controls that would otherwise be on the MRI biopsy device 14 itself<br>
are not readily accessible after insertion into the localization fixture 16 and/or placement<br>
of the control module 12 is inconveniently remote (e.g., 30 feet away). An aft end<br>
thumbwheel 63 on the reusable holster portion 32 is also readily accessible after insertion<br>
to rotate the side from which a tissue sample is to be taken.<br>
Left and right parallel upper guides 64, 66 of a localization framework 68 are laterally<br>
adjustably received respectively within left and right parallel upper tracks 70, 72 attached<br>
to an under side 74 and to each side of a selected breast aperture 76 formed in a patient<br>
support platform 78 of the breast coil 18. A base 80 of the breast coil 18 is connected by<br>
centerline pillars 82 that are attached to the patient support platform 78 between the breast<br>
apertures 76. Also, a pair of outer vertical support pillars 84, 86 on each side spaced about<br>
a respective breast aperture 76 respectively define a lateral recess 88 within which the<br>
localization fixture 16 resides.<br>
In FIGS. 1-2, a selected breast is compressed along an inner (medial) side by a medial plate<br>
90 downwardly received into a medial three-sided frame 92 of the localization framework<br>
68. The breast is compressed from an outside (lateral) side of the breast by a lateral fence<br>
94 downwardly received into a lateral three-sided frame 96 of the localization framework<br>
6.<br>
 <br>
68, defining an X-Y plane. The X-axis is vertical (sagittal) with respect to a standing<br>
patient and corresponds to a left to right axis as viewed by a clinician facing the<br>
externally exposed portion of the localization fixture 16.<br>
Perpendicular to this X-Y plane extending toward the medial side of the breast is the Z-axis,<br>
which typically corresponds to the orientation and depth of insertion of a probe 98 of a<br>
disposable probe assembly 100 of the MRI biopsy device 14 or of a sleeve trocar 102<br>
with inserted introducer obturator 104. For clarity, the term Z-axis may be used<br>
interchangeably with "axis of penetration", although the latter may or may not be<br>
orthogonal to the spatial coordinates used to locate an insertion point on the patient.<br>
Versions of the localization fixture 16 described herein allow a nonorthogonal axis of<br>
penetration to the X-Y axis to a lesion at a convenient or clinically beneficial angle. An<br>
origin of the spatial coordinates may be imaging the dents imparted to the tissue by the<br>
lateral fence 94. Alternatively, a disposable fiducial pointer 106 held by a fiducial holder<br>
108 is filled with an MRI imagable material (e.g., KY jelly, saline, gadolinium) and<br>
sealed with a cap 110.<br>
The probe 98, sleeve trocar 102 and fiducial pointer 106 are guided by the localization fixture<br>
16. With particular reference to FIG. 2, a lateral fence supported pedestal 120 spatially<br>
positions left and right primary targeting rails 121,122 that in turn guide the fiducial<br>
pointer 106, the sleeve / trocar 102, or the probe 98 of the biopsy device 14 (FIG. 1). The<br>
primary targeting rails 121,122 each include an attachment axle 124 that receives in<br>
either a left or right side axle hub 125 of a (Y-axis) height yoke 126 that is vertically<br>
adjustable upon a pedestal main body 128, that in turn is laterally adjustable upon the<br>
lateral fence 94. Alternatively, a breast coil may enable mounting the pedestal main body<br>
on the medial plate 90 for accessing medially. The pedestal main body 128 includes a<br>
proximal upright rectangular column 132 with a thinner wall 134 projecting from its<br>
distal side that flares laterally outward (defining left and right vertical rectangular slots<br>
136,138) as part of a bracket 140 with top and bottom hanger arms 144, 146 that slide<br>
laterally respectively on a top track 148 and a proximally open lower track 150 formed in<br>
the lateral fence 94. A lateral (X-axis) adjustment lever 151 may be raised to lift its distal<br>
end 149 out of engagement with a bottom track 147 formed in the lateral fence 94 as the<br>
lateral adjustment lever 151 is repositioned to the left or right to a desired location with<br>
reference to a lateral measurement guide 145.<br>
7.<br>
 <br>
The height yoke 126 is a rectangular cuff interrupted in a mid-portion of a distal side to form<br>
locking left and right hands 152 respectively which ride vertically in the left and right<br>
vertical rectangular slots 136,138. The locking left and right hands 152 have respective<br>
ridged proximal surfaces (not shown) that are selectively drawn proximally into locking<br>
engagement by a height locking lever 156 with a ridged surface 158 on a proximal side of<br>
each vertical rectangular slot 136,138. Lifting the height locking lever 156 takes the<br>
height yoke 126 out of locking engagement to the pedestal main body 128 as the height<br>
yoke 126 is vertically repositioned. For height adjustment, the proximal top surface of the<br>
height yoke 126 serves as a sight 160 to read a height measurement scale 162 presented<br>
on a proximal surface of the height locking lever 156.<br>
The attachment axle 124 allows rotation so that an axis of penetration may include an upward<br>
or downward trajectory. In the illustrative version, proximal corners of the height yoke<br>
126 include angle detents 164 (e.g., -15Â°, 0Â°, +15Â°) that are selectable by an angle lock<br>
lever 166. The primary targeting rail 122 includes a distal detent 167 that serves as a<br>
home reference for the fiducial holder 108 (FIG. 1).<br>
In FIGS. 3-4, a guidance assembly 200, that may be attached to the lateral fence supported<br>
pedestal 120 of FIG. 2, includes a cradle 202 whose upper lateral side 202a flares<br>
upwardly to engage a bottom channel 203 of the primary targeting rail 122. A lower<br>
lateral side 202b flares horizontally to provide a holster guide track 204 that underlies the<br>
axis of penetration. To provide additional guidance to the MRI biopsy device 14 (FIG. 1),<br>
a secondary targeting rail 206 includes a lateral channel 208 that is guided along a<br>
longitudinal guide tab 210 of the primary targeting rail 122. When fully engaged thereon,<br>
a pawl 212 pivoting under urging of a pawl spring 214 about a vertical pawl pin 216 in a<br>
lateral window 218 proximally positioned in the secondary targeting rail 206 drops into a<br>
proximal detent 220 proximally positioned on the primary targeting rail 122. The pawl<br>
spring 214 may maintain the pawl 212 in a neutral position that serves in both assembly<br>
and later removal of the secondary targeting rail 206 or comprises a pair of opposing pawl<br>
springs (not shown) for that purpose.<br>
In FIGS. 4-5, the sleeve trocar 102 includes a hollow shaft (or cannula) 223 that is proximally<br>
attached to a cylindrical hub 224 and has a lateral aperture 226 proximate to an open<br>
distal end 228. The cylindrical hub 224 has an exteriorly presented thumbwheel 230 for<br>
8.<br>
 <br>
rotating the lateral aperture 226. The cylindrical hub 224 has an interior recess 232 that<br>
encompasses a duckbill seal 234, wiper seal 236 and a seal retainer 238 to provide a fluid<br>
seal when the shaft 223 is empty and for sealing to the inserted introducer obturator 104.<br>
The introducer obturator 104 advantageously incorporates a number of components with<br>
corresponding features. A hollow shaft 242 includes a fluid lumen 244 that communicates<br>
between an imageable side notch 246 and a proximal port 248. The hollow shaft 242 is<br>
longitudinally sized to extend when fully engaging a piercing tip 249 out of the distal end<br>
228 of the sleeve trocar 102. An obturator handle 250 encompasses the proximal port 248<br>
and includes a locking feature 252, which includes a visible angle indicator 254, that<br>
engages the sleeve thumbwheel 230 to ensure that the imageable side notch 246 is<br>
registered to the lateral aperture 226 in the sleeve trocar 102. An obturator seal cap 256<br>
may be engaged proximally into the obturator handle 250 to close the fluid lumen 244.<br>
The obturator seal cap 256 includes a locking or locating feature 258 that includes a<br>
visible angle indicator 259 that corresponds with the visible angle indicator 254 on the<br>
obturator thumbwheel cap 230. The obturator seal cap 256 may be fashioned from either<br>
a rigid, soft, or elastomeric material.<br>
Returning to FIGS. 3, 4, the sleeve trocar 102 is guided, during penetration of tissue, by a<br>
sleeve mount 260 having a sleeve hub 262 that receives the cylindrical hub 224 of the<br>
sleeve trocar 102. The sleeve mount 260 has a lateral sleeve hub channel 264 that slides<br>
along top and bottom guide flanges 266,268 of the secondary targeting rail 206, each<br>
having an aligned and recess ridged, ratcheting surface 270 that interacts with a<br>
respective top and bottom ratcheting feature 272, 274 on respective top and bottom rail<br>
lock rocker latches 276,278 that are engaged by respective top and bottom latch pins<br>
280, 282 in respective sides of the sleeve mount 260. The ratcheting features 272, 274<br>
are proximally ramped such as to allow distal movement. Distal portions of each rail<br>
lock rocker latches 276, 278 are biased away from the sleeve mount 260 by respective<br>
rail lock compression springs 284,286 to bias the ratcheting features 272,274 into<br>
contact with the ridges surfaces 270 of the guide flanges 266, 268. Simultaneous<br>
depression of the rail lock rocker latches 276,278 allow the sleeve mount 260 to be<br>
drawn proximally, withdrawing any sleeve trocar 102 supported therein, until the sleeve<br>
mount 260 reaches a proximal end of the secondary targeting rail 206, whereupon the<br>
sleeve mount 260 rotates the pawl 212 clockwise (as viewed from the top) and is thus<br>
9.<br>
 <br>
engaged to the secondary targeting rail 206 as the secondary targeting rail 206 is<br>
unlocked from the primary targeting rail 122, causing removal therefrom with continued<br>
proximal movement.<br>
Before mounting the secondary targeting rail 206 onto the primary targeting rail 122 in the<br>
first place, the sleeve mount 260 is advantageously adjustably positioned on the<br>
secondary targeting rail 206 to set a desired depth of penetration. In particular, a depth<br>
guide 290 is formed by a crescent-shaped depth indicator 292 having a lateral channel<br>
296 shaped to engage the top and bottom guide flanges 266,268. Forward ramped<br>
surfaces 298 on the top and bottom of the lateral channel 296 are positioned to engage<br>
the ridged ratcheting surfaces 270 on the secondary targeting rail 206, allowing assembly<br>
by inserting the depth indicator 292 from a distal end of the secondary targeting rail 206.<br>
Frictional engagement thereafter resists further proximal movement and strongly<br>
opposes any distal movement, especially from a depth lead screw 300 of the depth guide<br>
290, whose distal end 302 rotates within an outboard hole 304 in the depth indicator 292<br>
and whose proximal end deflects laterally as a depth actuator lever 305 is used to rotate<br>
and longitudinally position the depth lead screw 300 therein. A mid portion of the depth<br>
lead screw 300 is received in a longitudinal through hole 306 formed in the sleeve mount<br>
260 outboard of its lateral channel 208. For coarse depth adjustment, outer lead threads<br>
307 on the depth lead screw 300 selectively engage the sleeve mount 260 until top and<br>
bottom coarse adjust buttons 308, 310 are inwardly depressed into the sleeve mount 260,<br>
compressing respective top and bottom coarse adjust compression springs 312, 314.<br>
Each coarse adjust button 308, 310 includes a respective vertically elongate aperture<br>
316, 318 whose inward surface presents a worm gear segment 320, 322 to engage the<br>
outer lead threads 307 on the depth lead screw 300 when urged into engagement by<br>
relaxed coarse adjust compression screws 312, 314.<br>
Returning to FIG. 3, the thumbwheel 230 is depicted as engaged to the sleeve hug 262 of the<br>
sleeve mount 260 with other portions of the sleeve trocar 102 omitted. Application s<br>
consistent with the present invention may include a probe of an MRI biopsy device that<br>
includes a piercing tip or that otherwise is used without passing through a hollow shaft<br>
(cannula) 223. As such, the thumbwheel with similar sealing members may be<br>
incorporated into the sleeve mount 260.<br>
10.<br>
 <br>
In FIGS. 6-7, the MRI biopsy device 14 has the disposable probe assembly 100 depicted<br>
detached from the reusable holster portion 32 and with the remote keypad 62 released<br>
from the reusable holster portion 32. The sheathed cable 27 is joined to an underside of<br>
the reusable holster portion 32 distal to the aft end thumbwheel 63 to enhance balance and<br>
support of the reusable holster portion, which in turn may be engaged to the holster guide<br>
track 204 (FIG. 4) by an I-beam shaped holster rail 324 whose upper surface 326 is<br>
engaged within a bottom channel 328 of a holster base plate 330. A ridged member 331<br>
upon the holster base plate 330 guides the disposable probe assembly 100 during<br>
engagement. A narrowed upper distal surface 332 of the holster rail 324 also engages<br>
downward gripping flanges 334 extending downward just proximal to a distal<br>
thumbwheel 336 of the disposable probe assembly 100. An under slung shell 337 is<br>
fastened to the proximal undersurface portion of the holster base plate 330.<br>
The disposable probe assembly 100 also has an undersurface that backwardly slides into<br>
engagement with the reusable holster portion 32. In particular, a narrowed proximal end<br>
338 is formed into an upper cover 340 with a distal locking arm 342 separated from the<br>
upper cover 340 on each side except proximally to present an unlocking button 344 on an<br>
exposed surface 346 of the upper cover 340 that is depressed to disengage a locking<br>
surface 348 (FIG. 6) from a distal lip 350 of a distally open receiving aperture 352 in the<br>
reusable holster portion 32 of the holster plate 330.<br>
A recessed deck 354 in an upper proximal surface of a proximal top cover 356 of the reusable<br>
holster portion 32 is shaped to receive the remote keypad 62. A lower shell 358 mates to<br>
the proximal top cover 356. The proximal top cover 356 also defines the upper portion of<br>
the receiving aperture 352. The recessed deck 354 has a front guide hole 360 and a back<br>
locking aperture 362 registered to respectively receive a front tooth 363 and a flexing<br>
unlock tab 364 at an aft end of the remote keypad 62 to selectively engage and disengage<br>
the keypad 62 from the reusable holster portion 32. The keypad 62 also includes a<br>
translation rocker button 366 that has a distal advance, a default neutral, and an aft retract<br>
command position. An aft button 368 may be programmed for mode functions such as<br>
saline flush.<br>
With particular reference to FIG. 6, the disposable probe assembly 100 has a plurality of<br>
interconnections presented on an aft docking end 370. A rightward canted vacuum hose<br>
11.<br>
 <br>
nib 372 is positioned to receive a vacuum conduit (not shown) that would be gripped by a<br>
friction clip 373 extending under and aft thereof to prevent inadvertent release. A right<br>
side slot 374 is distally open and formed between the holster base plate 330 and proximal<br>
top cover 356 to receive such a vacuum conduit as the disposable probe assembly 100 is<br>
engaged to the reusable holster portion 32. A center splined driveshaft 375 engages the aft<br>
end thumbwheel 63 and communicates with the distal thumbwheel 336 to rotate a side<br>
aperture 376 in probe 98 to a desired side, as visually confirmed by an arrow indicator<br>
378 on the distal thumbwheel 336. A right splined driveshaft 380 effects cutter translation<br>
and a left splined driveshaft 382 effects cutter rotation.<br>
The distal thumbwheel 336 and probe 98 are mounted to a cylindrical hub 384, which is a<br>
distal portion of the lower shell 358 that extends beyond the mating with the upper cover<br>
340. A sample through hole 386 communicates through the cylindrical hub 384 for<br>
receiving a rotating and translating cutter tube 388 (FIG. 9) that enters the probe 98 and<br>
for receiving tissue samples (not shown) deposited by a retracting cutter tube 388. As the<br>
cutter tube 388 fully retracts into a carriage cavity 390 formed between the upper cover<br>
340 and proximal portion of the lower shell 358, a distally extending tip 392 from a<br>
vacuum tube 394 encompassed by the cutter tube 388 dislodges the retracted tissue<br>
sample onto a sample retrieval platform 396, which is a relieved area between the upper<br>
cover 340 and the cylindrical hub 384.<br>
In FIG. 8, it should be appreciated that the sheathed cable 27 connects to the holster base<br>
plate 330 and communicates a single mechanical drive rotation to a fixed ratio<br>
transmission 398 mounted to the holster base plate 330 and electrically communicates<br>
with an encoder 400 coupled to the fixed ratio transmission 398 aft of the receiving<br>
aperture 352. The sheathed cable 27 also communicates electrically with the display area<br>
61 via a wire bundle (not shown) and with the keypad 62 via a cable assembly 402, the<br>
latter including a strain relief bracket 404 that grips a keypad cable 406 and is fastened<br>
proximate to the sheathed cable 27. The fixed ratio transmission 398 has a pass-through<br>
port 408 that receives a distal end the center splined driveshaft 375 (FIG. 6) to rotatingly<br>
engage a proximally received beveled shaft 410 distally presented by the aft end<br>
thumbwheel 63 and sealed by an O-ring 412. A right port 414 distally presented by the<br>
fixed ratio transmission 398 engages for rotation the right splined driveshaft 380 from the<br>
disposable probe assembly 100 for advancing and retracting ("translation") the cutter tube<br>
12.<br>
 <br>
388. A left port 416 distally presented by the fixed ratio transmission 398 engages for<br>
rotation the left splined driveshaft 382 from the disposable probe assembly 100 for<br>
rotating the cutter tube 388 when a distal cutting edge of the cutter tube 388 slides past<br>
the side aperture 376 of the probe 98.<br>
In FIGS. 9-10, the carriage cavity 390 of the disposable probe assembly 100 includes a cutter<br>
carriage 418 having a threaded longitudinal bore 420 that encompasses an elongate<br>
translation shaft 422 whose proximal termination is the right splined driveshaft 380<br>
supported by an aft right cylindrical bearing 424 received in an aft wall 425 of the lower<br>
shell 358. A race about the outer circumference of the cylindrical bearing 424 receives an<br>
O-ring 426. A distal end 428 of the threaded translation shaft 422 rotates within a distal<br>
right cylindrical bearing 430 engaged to a forward wall 432 of the lower shell 358. A race<br>
about the outer circumference of the cylindrical bearing 430 receives an O-ring 434. A<br>
threaded central portion 436 of the elongate translation shaft 422 resides between an<br>
unthreaded distal over-run portion 438 and an unthreaded proximal over-run portion 440,<br>
both sized to allow the threaded longitudinal bore 420 of the cutter carriage 418 to<br>
disengage from the threaded central portion 436.<br>
A distal compression spring 442 and a proximal compression spring 444 respectively reside<br>
on the unthreaded distal and proximal over-run portions 438, 440 to urge the threaded<br>
longitudinal bore 420 of the cutter carriage 418 back into engagement with the threaded<br>
central portion 436 upon reversal of rotation of the elongate translation shaft 422. In<br>
particular, the cutter carriage 418 includes a top longitudinal channel 446 that slidingly<br>
engages an undersurface of the upper cover 340 (not shown) and a bottom longitudinal<br>
guide 448 that engages a longitudinal track 450 on a top surface of the lower shell 358.<br>
Thus rotationally constrained, rotation of the elongate translation shaft 422 causes<br>
corresponding longitudinal translation of the cutter carriage 418 with distal and aft pairs<br>
of gripping flanges 452,454 maintained laterally to the left to engage respectively distal<br>
and proximal races 456, 458 formed on each side of a toothed portion 460 of a cutter spur<br>
gear 462, which has a longitudinal bore for applying vacuum.<br>
To that end, the vacuum hose nib 372 is attached to a mounting structure 464 that is gripped<br>
between the upper cover 340 and the lower shell 358 to present an orifice 466 within the<br>
13.<br>
 <br>
carriage cavity 390 that is aligned with the longitudinal bore of the cutter gear 462 and<br>
that is in fluid communication with the vacuum hose nib 372.<br>
With particular reference to FIG. 10, the proximal end of the vacuum tube 394 is received in<br>
the orifice 466. A rectangular guide 467 supports the distally extending tip 392 of the<br>
vacuum tube 394 and is engaged between the upper cover 340 and the lower shell 358.<br>
The cutter tube 388 encompasses and translates relative to the vacuum tube 394. A seal<br>
cap 468 attached to a proximal end of the cutter gear 462 dynamically seals to the outer<br>
circumference of the vacuum tube 394 so that vacuum pressure supplied proximate to the<br>
distally extending tip 392 is not released within the carriage cavity 390. The cutter tube<br>
388 is advanced around the open distal end of the vacuum tube 394, across the sample<br>
retrieval platform 396 to seal against a back seal 470 that substantially closes a proximal<br>
opening 472 into a sleeve union 474 that rotates within the cylindrical hub 384. The<br>
sleeve union 474 has a distal end 476 engaged for rotation with the distal thumbwheel<br>
336. Distal and proximal O-rings 478,480 reside respectively within distal and proximal<br>
races 482, 484 that straddle a lateral passage 486 of the sleeve union 474 to provide a<br>
degree of frictional resistance against inadvertent rotation and advantageously seal the<br>
lateral passage 486 for vacuum assistance to prolapse tissue and to retract samples. A<br>
noncircular opening 488 is centered in a distal face of the distal thumbwheel 336. A<br>
proximal end of a probe tube 490 of the probe 98 extends through the noncircular opening<br>
488 to receive a distal end of the cutter tube 388. A lateral tube 492 attached along its<br>
length to the probe tube 490 communicates with the lateral passage 486 of the union<br>
sleeve 474. The lateral tube 492 defines a lateral lumen that communicates with the a<br>
cutter lumen defined by the probe tube 490 / cutter tube 388 below the side aperture 376<br>
through lumen holes 494 (FIG. 9).<br>
The center splined driveshaft 375 that is turned by the aft end thumbwheel 63 rotates in turn a<br>
shaft 496 whose keyed distal end 498 in turn is engaged to and rotates a pinion gear 500<br>
that is in gear engagement to a proximal spur gear 502 that forms an outer proximal<br>
circumference of the sleeve union 474. A cylindrical distal tip 504 of the keyed distal end<br>
498 rotates within an axle hole (not shown) in the lower shell 358. Rotation of the aft end<br>
thumbwheel 63 thus rotates the probe 98.<br>
14.<br>
 <br>
A distal elbow pneumatic fitting 506 is supported in the lower shell 358 to have an upper end<br>
508 communicating with the lateral passage 486 of the sleeve union 474 and an aft end<br>
510 attached to a vent pneumatic conduit 512 supported by the lower shell 358. The other<br>
end of the vent pneumatic conduit 512 is attached to a distal end 514 of a proximal elbow<br>
pneumatic fitting 516 whose lateral end 518 is open to atmosphere. Sizing of various<br>
components that vent atmospheric pressure through the lumen holes 494 from the lateral<br>
end 518 are such that a tissue sample may be withdrawn through the probe tube 490. Yet<br>
a greater pneumatic draw of air through the vacuum hose nib 372 prior to severing a<br>
tissue sample results in a sufficient low pressure at the side aperture 376 to prolapse tissue<br>
for severing.<br>
An elongate rotation shaft 520 proximally terminates in the left splined driveshaft 382 that is<br>
supported for rotation by a left aft cylindrical bearing 522 having a race about an outer<br>
circumference that receives an O-ring 524 and is received in the aft wall 425 of the lower<br>
shell 358. A distal end 526 of the elongate rotation shaft 520 is received for rotation in a<br>
left distal cylindrical bearing 528 having a race about an outer circumference that receives<br>
an O-ring 530 and that is received within the front wall 425 of the lower shell 358. As the<br>
cutter carriage 418 advances to position the cutter tube 388 to slide past the side aperture<br>
376, the cutter spur gear 460 engages a spur gear portion 532 of the elongate rotation<br>
shaft 520. Rotating the cutter tube 388 in proportion to an amount of rotation advantages<br>
secures an effective severing of tissue. Eliminating rotation when not severing<br>
advantageously enhances retraction of tissue sample retraction.<br>
In use, in FIG. 11, the localization fixture 16 has been installed into the breast coil 18. The<br>
guidance assembly 200 has been preset for a desired insertion point, a desired axis of<br>
penetration, and a depth of penetration. After the sleeve trocar 102 / introducer obturator<br>
104 have been inserted and imaged to confirm placement, the introducer obturator 104 is<br>
removed and the probe 98 of the biopsy device 14 is inserted, as depicted in FIG. 12. The<br>
shape of the sleeve trocar 102 aligns the probe 98, visually assisted by lining up the arrow<br>
indicator 378 on the distal thumbwheel 336 with the visible angle indicator on the<br>
thumbwheel 230 of the sleeve trocar 102. The surgeon may effect operation of the biopsy<br>
device 14 by depressing the translation rocker button 366 and aft button 368 on the<br>
keypad 62 while referencing status information about the biopsy device 14 on the display<br>
area 61. In FIG. 13, the display area 61 advantageously includes a cutter position bar<br>
15.<br>
 <br>
graph 534 having distal and proximal indications 536, 538 that may be compared with<br>
how many light segments 540 have been illuminated to indicate progress of the cutter<br>
tube 388 relative to the side aperture 376. The aft button 368 may be toggled to cycle the<br>
biopsy device 14 through three modes, indicated by a position LED indicator 542, a<br>
sample LED indicator 544, and a clear LED indicator 546 with a corresponding label that<br>
graphically depicts operation of the biopsy device in that mode. In particular, a position<br>
mode depiction 548 illustrates that the cutter tube 388 may be advanced and retracted, for<br>
instance, closing the side aperture 376 prior to insertion of the probe 98 into the sleeve<br>
trocar 102. In a sample mode depiction 550, vacuum assistance is implemented, drawing<br>
sufficient air through the cutter tube 388 to prolapse tissue into the open side aperture 376<br>
that is maintained while translating the cutter tube 388. In a clear mode depiction 552,<br>
vacuum is maintained while fully retracting the cutter tube 388 to retract a tissue sample.<br>
In FIG. 14, a marker device 548 is deployed through the sample through hole 386 in the<br>
cylindrical hub 388.<br>
It should be appreciated that any patent, publication, or other disclosure material, in whole or<br>
in part, that is said to be incorporated by reference herein is incorporated herein only to<br>
the extent that the incorporated material does not conflict with existing definitions,<br>
statements, or other disclosure material set forth in this disclosure. As such, and to the<br>
extent necessary, the disclosure as explicitly set forth herein supersedes any conflicting<br>
material incorporated herein by reference. Any material, or portion thereof, that is said to<br>
be incorporated by reference herein, but which conflicts with existing definitions,<br>
statements, or other disclosure material set forth herein, will only be incorporated to the<br>
extent that no conflict arises between that incorporated material and the existing<br>
disclosure material.<br>
While the present invention has been illustrated by description of several embodiments and<br>
while the illustrative embodiments have been described in considerable detail, it is not the<br>
intention of the applicant to restrict or in any way limit the scope of the appended claims<br>
to such detail. Additional advantages and modifications may readily appear to those<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
For example, while closed loop feedback sensing of a component that is related to cutter tube<br>
position has various advantages, determination of cutter position may be achieved in<br>
16.<br>
 <br>
other ways consistent with the present invention. For instance, loading on drive<br>
components may be sensed at either full advancement and/or full retraction which are<br>
used to calibrate an estimate cutter position based on duration of a translation command.<br>
As another example, rather than discrete LED indicators and labeled depictions, applications<br>
consistent with aspects of the invention may include a graphical display (e.g., organic<br>
liquid crystal display) that is capable of interactive presentations of intuitive instrument<br>
status information. Alternatively or in addition, a touch screen capability may be<br>
incorporated to allow instrument control input as well as display.<br>
For another example, applications consistent with aspects of the present invention may be<br>
used in conjunction with different diagnostic imaging modalities (e.g., ultrasonic,<br>
computed tomography (CT).<br>
