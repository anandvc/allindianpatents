IMPROVED CONTROL AND OPTIMIZATION OF PROCESS FOR MAKING<br>
ETHYLENE OXIDE<br>
CROSSrREFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
This application claims the benefit of US Provisional Application Serial No. 60/841,767, filed September 1, 2006. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The instant invention relates toprocesses for the manufacture of ethylene oxide. The production of ethylene oxide by the reaction of oxygen or oxygen-containing gases with etiiylene in the presence of a silver-containing catalyst at elevated temperature is a key process in the chemical industry. Due to the ■flammable nature of oxygen, these processes-rely on precise and accurate control of oxygen, and particularly, the "Limiting Oxygen Value" CXOV"), also known as the Maximum Allowable Oxygen Concentration "(MAOC").    The LOV is the oxygen concentration at which a combustion reaction will propagate through ethylene oxide process gas. Those of skill in the art are familiar with formulas for the calculation of LOV. Using too much oxygen can result in a catastrophic ignition, while using too little can result in poor yield. Independent reactor inlet and outlet oxygen analyzers are also used for automatic safety shutdown and isolation of oxygen feeds. If the capabihty to monitor inlet oxygen concentration continuously is lost, oxygen and hydrocarbon feeds must be immediately shut off If the capability to monitor outlet oxygen concentration continuously is lost, either (a) the affected reactor must be shut down immediately or (b) the inlet oxygen concentration must be kept below the outlet operating limit. If alternative (b) is chosen, the reactor must be shut down immediately if the inlet oxygen concentration exceeds an offset ftom the LOV to ensure that a safety tnargin can be maintained. The size of the offset depends on the system geometry and past history of decompositions. For example, the shut down could be triggered where the oxygen concentration exceeds outlet LOV + 1 voi% (based on LOV calculations before loss of capability to monitor). (Many commercial ethylene oxide plants would choose not to operate under this option (b). Therefore, it is very important to.control the LOV at the reactors with a high degree of accuracy and precision. In fact, most ethylene oxide facilities deihand that analyzer systems and instrumentation have full redundancy.<br>
Currently, the best practice in the industry is to use an oxygen measurement based on a paramagnetic analyzer. Limitations in the measurement itself can dramatically affect the<br><br>
ability to control the LOV at its optimum, and therefore limit the overall efficiency and'yietd of an ethylene oxide plant, There are seveiral drawbacks to use of paramagnetic analyzers for controlling LOV:<br>
(1)	Many non-oxygen components of reaction system gas depress the oxygen concentration indicated by a paramagnetic analyzer, causing a paramagnetic offset. There are two ways to compensate for this offset. The first is to calibrate concentration at the midpoint of the range of the non-target gases. A disadvantage to this approach is that the compensation will be an average "of the offset and the uncertainty of the measurement increases. The second is to compensate with "live" input from a gas chromatograph or gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer.   Disadvantages to this approach are that the data is not real-time and that the reliability of the mass spectrometer is not as high as using other methods.<br>
(2)	Oxygen is reactive. Questions arise concerning sample integpty when the sample is transported through 10-100 meters of tubing to an analyzer in an analyzer shelter, such as with the paramagnetic analyzers.<br>
(3)	The process tempeialures in the ethylene oxide streams can be as high as 330<br>
°C, but the temperature limit for a paramagnetic analyzer is about 130°C. Thus, the sample<br>
temperature must be reduced prior to analysis.<br>
(4)	The process pressures in the ethylene oxide streams can be as high as 350 psig, whereas the pressure limit for a paramagnetic analyzer is about 50 psig. Thus, the sample pressure must be decreased prior to analysis.<br>
(5)	The paramagnetic analyzers become fouled by the solids/liquids in the streams, causing mirrors to coat and cells to short. Thus, the samples can destroy or compromise the measurements.<br>
(6)	The paramagnetic analyzers take time to transport the sample to the sheltered analyzer and take additional time to condition the sample (reduce temperature, decrease pressure).<br>
(7)	The paramagnetic analyzers cell vents are connected to a cell vent header and<br>
require pressure compensation. Variability in the pressure compensation leads to<br>
uncertainty in the oxygen measurements-<br>
All of these drawbacks to paramagnetic analyzers result in introducing variability<br>
into the control of LOV. Thus, there is a need in the art for a method to more quickly.<br><br>
accurately and precisely measure oxygen in ethylene oxide processes than the best practice in use today.<br>
The development of the tunable near-infrared diode laser and absorption spectroscopy approach for the determination of oxygen, carbon monoxide, and oxides of nitrogen in the combustion gas from a coal fired utility boiler, a waste incinerator as well as from jet engines are summarized in Section 11.4.3, Sensors for Advanced Combustion Systems, Global Climate &amp;. Energy Project, Stanford University, 2004, by Hanson et al.. In Thompson et al., US Patent Application Publication US 2004/0191712 Al, a tunable near-infrared diode laser and absorption spectroscopy system to was applied to combustion applications in the steelmaking industry.<br>
Kitchen, et al., US6258978, discloses a method of making vinyl acetate by contacting ethylene, acetic acid, and oxygen in the presence of a catalyst to producean outlet stream. The concentration of oxygen in the outlet stream is maintained at or near its flammability limit.   Kitchen points out that paramagnetic analyzers cannot be used where high temperature and pressure conditions are encountered, for example, adjacent to the reactor outlet. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The instant invention is a solution, at least in part, to the above-stated problem of the need for a more precise, reliable and representative analysis of oxygen concentrations in an ethylene oxide reaction system. Singly or in combination, and preferably in combination, the instant invention can also solve the problem of the need for a more reliable and representative oxygen analyzer safety shutdown system. The instant invention uses tunable near-infrared diode laser and absorption specfroscopy technology for the determination of oxygen concentration, in the inlet and outlet of an ethylene oxide reactor.   The method is ■ performed by sample extraction.<br>
More specifically, the invention is a method for control of a Limiting Oxygen Value (LOV)of a reactor for producing ethylene oxide, the reactor having an inlet and/or outlet, comprising the steps of: (a) extracting a process sample through a close-coupled extractive   . sample loop wherein an analyzer is located in proximity to the sampling point; (b) directing a wavelength modulated beam of near infrared light from a tunable diode laser through a gas cell containing the process sample to a near infrared light detector to generate a detector signal; (c) analyzing the detector signalfor spectroscopic absorption at wavelengths<br><br>
characteristic for oxygen to determine its concentration in the sample; and optionally (d) adjusting the oxygen level in the ethylene oxide reactor inlet and/or outlet in response to the concentration of the oxygen of step (c).<br>
The invention also includes a method for control of an oxygen analyzer safety shiitdown of oxygen feed and reaction system of a reactor for producing ethylene oxide, the reactor having an inlet and/or outlet, comprising the steps of: (a) extracting a process sample through a close-coupled extractive sample loop wherein an analyzer is located in proximity to the sampling point; (b) directing a wavelength modulated beam of near infrared light from a tunable diode laser through a gas cell containing the process sample to a near infrared light detector to generate a detector signal; (c) analyzing the detector signal for spectroscopic absorption at wavelengths characteristic for oxygen to determine its concentration in the sample; and optionally (d) adjusting the oxygen level in the ethylene oxide reactor inlet and/or outlet in response to the concentration of the oxygen of step (c) or shutting down the oxygen feed and reaction system if the oxygen measurement exceeds an oxygen concentration shutdown setpoint.<br>
In one embodiment, the wavelength of the near infrared light from the tunable diode laser is in the range of from about 760-764 nm. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>

The reaction conditions for carrying out the vapor phase oxidation of ethylene with molecular oxygen are well-known and extensively described in the prior art. This applies to reaction conditions, such as, temperature, pressure, residence time, concentration of<br><br>
reactants, diluents {e.g., nitrogen, methane and CO2), inhibitors (e.g.. ethylene dichloride) and the like. Examples of inhibitors, such as nitrogen oxides and nitrogen oxides generating compounds are described in Law, et al., U.S. Patent Nos. 2,279,469 and 2,279i470, incorporated herein by reference. Other gases fed to the reaction may include a gaseous efficiency-enhancing member of a redox-half reaction pair such as NO, NO2, N2O3, Nz04, N2O5 or any gaseous substance capable of forming one of the aforementioned gases, particularly NO and NO2, under epoxidation conditions, and mixtures thereof with one or more of PH3, CO, SO3, SO2, P2O5, and P3O3. See, e.g., EP 3642 and Liu et al„ U.S. 6,511,938, each incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In addition, the desirability of recycling unreacted feed, or employing a single-pass system, or using successive reactions to increase ethylene conversion by employing reactors in series arrangement can be readily determined by those skilled in the art. The particular mode of operation selected will usually be dictated by process economics.<br>
Generally, the commercially-practiced processes for producing ethylene oxide are carried out by continuously introducing a feed stream containing ethylene and oxygen to a catalyst-containing reactor at a temperature of &amp;om about 20O to 300°C, and a pressure which may vary from about 10 atmospheres to about 30 atmospheres depending upon the mass velocity and productivity desired. Most commercially practiced processes operate at temperature greater than about 210°C and at a pressure above 15 barg._Residence times in large-scale reactors are generally on the order of about 5-15 seconds (or Gas Hour Space Velocities around 3000 hr"' to 7000 hr"'). Oxygen may be supplied to the reaction in an oxygen-containing stream, such as air or as commercial oxygen. The resulting ethylene oxide is separated and recovered from the reaction products using conventional methods. A usual gas recycle encompasses carbon dioxide recycle in the concentrations, e.g., of about 0.5 to 10 volume percent.<br>
An excellent discussion on ethylene oxide, including a detailed description of commonly used manufacturing process steps, for both air and oxygen based processes is found in Kirk-Othmer's EncyclopedJa.of Chemical Technology. 4*' Ed.(] 994) Volume 9, pages 915 to 959). Typical air and oxygen process test conditions are described in US 5,187,140 arid 5,102,848, each incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Fig. 1 shows the ethylene oxide reactor(s) 1 through 6 and cycle gas loop 7, oxygen supply inlet 10, ethylene supply inlet 11, and absorber 12. The desired locations at which to<br><br>
sample and to ineasure oxygen concentration (sampling points) are located at the inlet 8 and outlet 9 of the reactors..The desire is to measure oxygen concentration at the common reactor inlet piping 8 and on the common reactor outlet piping 9. Both measurements should be as close as possible to the reactor for the most representative measurement.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a traditions! extractive oxygen analyzer sample system. The process piping 13 is representative of all connections for the reactor inlet 8 and reactor outlet 9 oxygen analyzers depicted in Fig. 1. A fast loop sample 14 transports the sample about 50 or more meters from the sampling location to an entrainment separation device 15 which conditions the sample for analysis. The bulk of the fast loop 16 continues on to a low pressure vessel 17. A small sample stream 18 is extracted from the entrainment separation device 15 and transported to the paramagnetic oxygen analyzer 19. Then the sample stream" 20 is returned to the low pressure vessel 17.<br>
Fig. 3 depicts one embodiment of a close-coupled tunable diode laser oxygen analyzer sample system 25 and light detector system 26. The process piping 46 is representative of all connections for the reactor inlet 8 and reactor outlet 9 oxygen analyzers depicted in Fig. 1. A fast loop sample 20 transports the sample about 0 to about 5 meters from the sampling point to the tunable diode laser sample cell 21. The fast loop sample 22 is then returned to the low pressure vessel 47 and the process. The laser transmitter 23 emits abeam of infrared light which traverses the length of the sample cell 21 and is captured by the receiver 24 for a nearly real-time measurement of the sample (cycle gas) oxygen concentration. Alignment plates 30 and 41 are shown for reference.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 4, there is shown a more detailed view of the tunable diode laser system 25 and light detector system 26 shown in Fig. 3. The'system shown in Fig. 4 includes a laser module 28 containing the tunable diode laser. A control unit 29 contains the central processing unit programmed for signal processing as well as the temperature and current control for the tunable diode laser and a user interface and display. Alignment plate 30 and adjustment rods 31 allow alignment of the laser beam 32. Windows 33 are mounted in a pipe flange 34. The space 35 between the windows 33 is purged with nitrogen under pressure. The flange 34 is mounted through the wall of the cycle gas pipe (not shown).<br>
Referring still to Fig. 4, the laser beam 32 is passed through windows 36 to a near infrared light detector 37. The windows 36 are rnounted across a pipe for an in situ measurement.    The space 40 between the windows 36 is purged with nitrogen under<br><br>
pressure. The flange 39 is mounted through the wall of the cycle gas pipe (not shown). Alignment plate 41 and adjustment rods 42 allow alignment of the detector optics with the laser beam 32. Detector electronics 43 are in electrical communication with the control unit 29 by way of cable 28. The control unit 29 is also in electrical communication with the process control system 44 (by way of electrical cables 45) for controlling the reactor 10. The optical path length of the iaser beam 32 is the length of cell sample 21 for close coupled installations (Fig 3). The system shown in Fig. 3 is commercially available irom Analytical Specialties of Houston, Texas.<br>
The system shown in Fig. 4 operates by measuring the amount of laser ligjit that is absorbed (lost) as it travels through the sample of cycle gas.   Oxygen has a spectral absorption that exhibits unique fine structure. The individual features of the spectra are seen at the high resolution of the tunable diode laser module 28. The tunable diode laser 28 is modulated (that is scanned or tuned irom one wavelength to another) by controlling its input current from the control unit 29.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 5, therein is shown a spectrum in the region where oxygen absorbs the modulated beam of near infrared light from the tunable diode laser. The absorbance shown in Fig. 5 is proportional to the concentration of oxygen in the process gas.<br>
Referring again to Fig. 1, the oxygen LOV control can be controlled to optimize the oxygen concentrations in the ethylene oxide cycle gas in response to the tunable diode laser spectroscopic analysis of oxygen outlined above.<br>
