ANTIMICROBIAL DEVICES AND COMPOSITIONS<br>
RELATED APPLICATION<br>
This application claims the priority of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/592,535, filed July 30,2004, which is herein incorporated in its entirety.<br>
HELD OP THE INVENTION<br>
The invention pertains to antimicrobial devices and compositions comprising metal compounds, such as silver. In particular, the methods and devices can be used in applications where an antimicrobial environment is useful<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Silver is known to possess broad spectrum antimicrobial activity and has been incorporated in a variety of medical care products such as dressings, hydrogels, hydrocolloids, foams, creams, gels, lotions, catheters, sutures, bandages, and positioning devices. Though specifically not recognized, the antimicrobial properties of silver were known and exploited since the times of ancient Mediterranean and Asiatic cultures. References have been made to the use of silver vessels to prevent spoilage of water during storage and of silver foil or plates in the treatment of wounds and bone fractures.<br>
Von Nageli first systematically studied the lethal effects of metals, including silver, on bacteria and other life forms and coined the term "oligodynamic effect" for the phenomenon (C.Von Nageli, Denkschriftcn der Schweiz Naturforsch. Ges., Vol. 33, pp 1 (1893)). Generally speaking, the oligodynamic effect is limited to solutions in which metal ion concentration is several orders of magnitude below that which would be harmful to the patient's tissue. In the case of silver, this value is about 10-6 to 10-9 molar.<br>
A silver compound that can maintain a silver ion concentration of at least 10-9 molar can function as antimicrobial agent. The majority of known silver salts are sparingly soluble, i.e., possess very low solubility product KsP, and thus, the silver ion concentration in solutions are generally very low. An exception is silver nitrate, which is completely ionized at all concentrations but is prone to the loss of silver ions by de-activation by surfaces contacting the solution. Despite the slow dissolution in water due to low solubility of silver salts, not all silver compounds are useful as antimicrobial agents because of silver's adverse properties. These<br>
1<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/015317	PCT/US2005/027260<br>
include a short half-life, the rapid inactivation of silver by protein or compounds having thiol groups, and light-or heat- mediated discoloration.<br>
The antimicrobial activity and action of silver was reviewed in Russell and Hugo (Prog. Medicinal Chemistry, Vol. 31, pp 351 (1994)). It is believed that the lelnal activity of silver towards microbes is due to silver's multi-site attack on microbial cells. Silver ions possess high affinity for thiol, amino and carboxyl groups and oligonucleotide bases and bind irreversibly to these groups, disrupting cells normal growth cycles and killing them. Because of silver's ability to target multiple sites on cells, the risk of microbes developing resistance to silver is extremely unlikely. Therefore, silver has found widespread use as a germicidal agent With the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium in recent years, the focus has increasingly shifted to the use of silver as a more robust and reliable antimicrobial agent.<br>
Many silver compounds have been found to be useful. Silver nitrate has been used in eye drops to treat neonatal eye infections. In stick form, silver nitrate has been used to treat warts and in lotions to treat lesions. Silver nitrate combined with ammonia has been used as a antimicrobial dental protective. Several other silver salts such as acetate, citrate, lactate, picrate and methylene bis naphthalene sulfonate have found use in different therapeutic compositions -eye lotions, dust powder for wounds, in astringents and antiseptic, in treating vaginal trichomonoiasis and candidiasis and in treating burns, varicose ulcers and pressure sores. Silver protein complexes have also been widely used in preparations such as creams, lotions and ointments. In creams and lotions, a sulfonamide derivative, silver sulphadiazine, has been successful in the treatment of burns and acute and chronic wounds. However, there have been reports of microbes in hospital settings developing resistance to sulphadiazine thus bruiting its widespread use.<br>
Medical devices containing silver must meet the same requirements as other antimicrobial medical devices to be commercially successful. Silver-containing devices must maintain the same aesthetic appearance and feel and provide antimicrobial function for prolonged periods. Unfortunately, most currently available devices incorporating silver compounds are only able to fulfill the requirements to some degree, i.e. they are able to provide antimicrobial effect on sustained basis but they discolor over time. A few devices are able to fulfill both requirements but are not biocompatible at effective concentrations.<br>
Silver-containing medical devices are prone to light and heat-induced discoloration. Often these products in contacting body parts or skin cause undesirable staining. At worst,<br>
2<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/015317	PCT/US2005/027260<br>
repeated staining can lead to permanent discoloration, a condition known as argyria. The light and thermal instability of these products may also cause reliability problems in the manufacture and shelf life storage. Efforts have been tried to overcome these problems, but they have been unsuccessful, due to toxicity, continued light sensitivity or other issues.<br>
While various approaches may be somewhat successful in imparting light stability to some products, most approaches are not broadly applicable. Silver compounds that possess good light stability do not necessarily have good thermal stability, which is often useful because in manufacturing, drying steps or sterilization operations may involve high temperatures.<br>
None of the current silver stabilization procedures are practical to implement in preparing medical devices, such as traditional dressings, with antimicrobial property such as cotton or polyester blended cotton gauzes or sponges, or other devices. For example, in treating a cotton gauze, moderate amount of salts (chlorides) may be tolerated but excess salts tend to make a gauze material stiff giving it a crispy feel. However, with only moderate amount of salts, the light protective action may not be as effective. Occlusion by polyethylene glycols may not appropriate as it could be expensive and the presence of copper salts stain the gauze yellow. In the alternative, cotton gauzes can be rendered antimicrobial with antibiotics or other chemical agents (biguanides and chlorohexidine derivatives) but they don't perform as well.<br>
Therefore, there is a need for antimicrobial products, including traditional dressings, such as gauze products, that provide antimicrobial characteristics from the presence of silver and provide sustained release but do not discolor under light, heat and sterilization conditions, and which are relatively inexpensive and straightforward to manufacture.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The present invention comprises methods and compositions comprising metals, such as zinc, copper and silver. In particular, the metal, such as silver, zinc or copper, is found in association with an anion or in a complex, referred to herein as a ligand, where the ratio of the metal to a ligand is less than 1 to 1 (i.e., Metal(Ag);Ligand where Ligand &gt; MetaI(Ag) on a molarity basis. For brevity sake, compounds disclosed herein are referred to as silver compounds, but it is to be understood that silver, copper or zinc compounds arc contemplated by the disclosed compounds, compositions and devices. Silver compounds contemplated by the present invention are disclosed herein. The silver compounds taught herein are may be used in antimicrobial compositions and devices, including, but not limited to, medical products such as wound care products or patient care products. Particular compounds include metal salts of<br>
3<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/015317	PCT/US2005/027260<br>
copper, zinc and silver of saccharin derivatives wherein the substituent on imide nitrogen is hydrogen, silver complex compounds such as silver benzodiazepines complexes and benzodiazepine derivatives, and polymeric silver compounds are also contemplated by the present invention.<br>
Methods of using the compounds as antimicrobial agents in compositions and in treating surfaces and medical devices and in wound care products are taught herein as are methods of making and using the antimicrobial compositions and devices.<br>
The antimicrobial devices of the present invention resist discoloration induced by light or thermal exposure. The silver compounds of the present invention are generally sparingly soluble in water and this low solubility and inertness to light and heat allows the devices incorporating such compositions to maintain antimicrobial activity over long periods of time and yet not discolor. The ability to resist discoloration by light or heat distinguishes the present invention from prior silver-based antimicrobial agents. The stability of the silver compounds of the present invention against heat and light precludes the need for stabilization chemistry and saves costs in the preparation of antimicrobial compositions and devices.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention comprises methods and compositions for making and using antimicrobial devices and compositions comprising metallic compounds. The antimicrobial character of the devices and compositions is provided by metals, including silver, copper and zinc. The compositions and devices of the present invention are useful because they are resistant to discoloration by exposure to heat or light and do not stain skin, tissues or other surfaces which they contact.<br>
Methods for making many of the metal compounds of the present invention are known to those skilled in the art or may be derived using chemical techniques. In general, the silver compounds of the present invention may be prepared by mixing stoichiometric amounts of solutions of a silver salt such as silver nitrate or acetate with a corresponding alkali or alkaline earth metal salt of an organic anionic compound. Slight excess over stoichiometry of alkali or alkali earth metal compounds is also contemplated by the invention. Solutions of soluble silver salts can be mixed with corresponding organic compounds directly rather than in their alkali or alkaline earth metal salts, and especially those organic compounds that are acidic -NH compounds. When preparing silver compounds dispersed on carrier supports, the mixing step may be carried out in the presence of insoluble carrier materials.<br>

Silver compounds of the present invention can be admixed or combined into many different compositions to render such compositions antimicrobial. Such compositions include, but are not limited to, suspensions, lotions and creams, ointments, jellies, gels, pessaries, compositions based on inorganic carriers such as porous glasses, oxides, silicates, talc, mica, silica, titania, zirconia, insoluble polymeric microspheres, hydroxy apatite, cellulose powder, chitin, chitosan, and cross-linked polymers. For example, a composition may comprise a fine suspension of a silver compound with or without surfactant, dispersant or stabilizing agent. In another example, the composition may be a topical gel that provides moisturizing, soothing and bio-burden reducing action over long periods of time and be minimally or completely non-staining.<br>
Compositions of the present invention may comprise one or more silver compounds, or may comprise one or more active agents, such as other antibiotics. For example, in addition to the silver compounds taught herein, other active agents such as antibiotics or silver compounds already known in the prior art can also be included in the antimicrobial compositions. Other active agents include, but are not limited to, antimicrobial agents, antifungal agents antiviral agents, growth factors, angiogenic factors, anaesthetics, mucopolysaccharides and wound healing proteins. The compositions may further comprise additives such as fragrances, colorants, emollients, surfactants, dispersants, moisturizers, viscosity modifiers, acids and bases for adjusting pH, gelling agents, opacifiers, fillers, humectants, polymers, oligomers, waxes, mineral oils, petrolatum bases or other ingredients, excipients, diluents or needed components to improve or impart specific formulation properties. Additives, such as those known to be used in formulations, may be used in the compositions with the proviso that their inclusion should have minimal effect on the compositions with respect to discoloration by light or heat and that the antimicrobial property may not be affected adversely during the preparation, storage and use. Those skilled in the art will recognize silver stabilized compositions comprising silver compounds of the present invention can be formulated with an ordinary amount of experimentation.<br>
Compositions of the present invention may comprise carriers or supports which are useful for increasing the bulk of a composition. Carriers or supports may be used for used for finely dispersing the silver compounds of the present invention and are generally physiologically inert and stable in an aqueous environment. Suitable carriers or supports materials include oxides of titanium, magnesium, aluminium, silicon, cerium, zirconium, hafnium, niobium,<br>

WO 2006/015317	PCT/US2005/027260<br>
tantalum, calcium hydroxyapatite and barium sulphate. The list presented here is for illustration and by no means limiting or exhaustive.<br>
Compositions of the present invention may be used in the treatment of disruptions of the integumentary system, the skin, coverings of organs, mucous membranes, and other coverings of body surfaces, including, but not limited to, wounds, diabetic ulcers, bums, bum wounds and ulcers, skin lesions, and infections of skin and mucous membranes. Compositions and devices .of the present invention may be used on living and nonliving surfaces to provide an antimicrobial environment, and may be used for humans, animals and plants.<br>
Antimicrobial compositions and devices with varying durations of antimicrobial activity are provided by the present invention. The activity may last from a few hours to several days. When included in antimicrobial compositions, the amount of silver compounds is dictated by several factors. If long term application is contemplated then the amount of silver compounds is increased to a level that will provide an effective amount of silver on the last day of the expected duration of use. However, the amount of silver compounds cannot be increased arbitrarily so as to exceed a level that will cause cytoxicity to the mammalian cells. Antimicrobial compositions incorporating therapeutically effective amounts of silver compounds without causing undesirable cytotoxicity and unwanted discoloration or staining are contemplated by the present invention.<br>
The present invention comprises antimicrobial medical devices and wound care products comprising silver compounds, uses and methods of preparation of such devices and products. Light and heat stable silver compounds are combined with medical and wound care devices to render such medical and wound care devices antimicrobial, while maintaining light and heat stability. Examples of medical devices rendered antimicrobial using the silver compounds of the present invention include, but are not limited to, dry or wet matrices, hydrophobic or hydrophilic matrices such as cellulose ether derivatives, hydroxyl allcyl cellulose ether derivatives, hydroxyl allcyl cellulose derivatives or mixtures thereof, cotton, rayon, acrylics, acetate fibers, alginates and other synthetic and natural polymers and their blends, hydrocolloid dressings, dressings used in wet therapy, superabsorbent foams, hydrophilic polyurethane foams, activated charcoal dressings, compresses, xeroform petrolatum dressings, venous, urinary and pain management system catheters, stents, guidewrres, shunts, cannulae, catheter adapters and other solid and hollow tubular devices, sutures, incontinence pads, ostomy pouches and plugs, haemostats, urine collection bags, and other waste collection containers.<br>

Preparation of silver compounds<br>
The present invention comprises methods of preparation of antimicrobial silver compounds. In one embodiment, silver compounds are identified as ionic salts. Silver compounds M+X- under group A can be prepared in relatively straightforward manner. Compounds with imides having an increased acidic proton or decreased solubility in water are useful. To illustrate one method, the preparation of silver saccharinate from sodium saccharinate is provided. The following chemical reaction takes place.<br>
 <br>
To a solution of sodium saccharinate of appropriate molarity (0.125 or more), a solution of soluble silver nitrate of the same or slightly lower molarity (5 to 10% lower molarity) was added to precipitate weakly soluble silver saccharinate that was recovered by washing with deionized water which dried to a white powder in good yields (&gt; 80%). An advantage of working with silver saccharinate is the preparation steps can be carried out in ambient light. No protection against light is needed as silver saccharinate powder is not very light sensitive.<br>
Silver saccharinate can be also prepared directly from saccharin. This method is described in US Patent No. 3,152,904 where silver saccharin was formed by treating a solution of saccharin in hot xylene with aqueous silver nitrate in a two-phase reaction system. Other aprotic solvents such as THF can also be used in place of xylene. In general, in the preparation<br>
39<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/015317	PCT/US2005/027260<br>
of silver compounds MX of group A type, silver from soluble salt is exchanged with alkali or alkaline earth cation or hydrogen to yield insoluble silver salt of the imide. Neat solvents or the mixtures of water, lower alkyl alcohols, lower branched alcohols, THF, acetone and other suitable solvents may be used in the preparation. Generally the preparation is carried out at ambient temperature but different temperatures may also be employed.<br>
The preparation of silver compounds MX of groups B and C are quite similar to those of group A. For example, thiobarbitutric acid (group B) is first converted to its alkali metal salt and mixed with solution of silver nitrate to precipitate insoluble silver thiobarbiturate (see chemical reactions below) that is recovered after filtration and drying, likewise, silver behenate (Group C) can be readily formed by mixing sodium behenate and silver nitrate solutions according to a method described in example 5 in US Patent No. 3,152,904 which is fully incorporated herein by reference.<br>
 <br>
For simplicity, the compounds have been identified as complexes.<br>
 <br>
The silver complexes M[Y] are readily prepared by known precipitation methods. For instance, silver benzimidazole complex was prepared by mixing an alcoholic solution of<br>
40<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/015317	PCT/US2005/027260<br>
benzimidazole and an aqueous solution of silver nitrate in stoichiometric proportion. Upon mixing a white precipitate was formed that is recovered after filtration and drying. The white powder remained unchanged even after prolonged exposure to room light Solvents suitable for use in the preparation of silver complexes include but are not limited to water, lower alkyl alcohols, lower alkyl branched alcohols, THF, acetone, toluene, xylene or their mixtures in desired proportions.<br>
Generally in any of the above preparations, ambient temperatures 25°C to 35°C are preferred but higher temperatures may also be employed without departing from the scope of the invention. To compensate for any exothermic reaction, preparation may also be carried out below room temperature.<br>
The mixing of the organic compound or its salt and silver nitrate can be carried out in any order. Though, the addition of silver salt solution to the organic compound or its salt is preferred. Stirring may be used. Stoichiometric proportions of the reagents may be generally employed but slight excess in favor of the anion providing the compound or the complexing compound is favored for more complete conversion of silver cations to weakly soluble form.<br>
From reaction mixtures, the silver compounds may be recovered in solid form or may be used as suspension in subsequent steps. In solid form, it is not important for the practice of the invention that the compounds be recovered as crystals or as amorphous powder. However, it is useful that in solid form the silver compounds be present as finely dispersed particles.<br>
The silver compounds taught herein may be used individually or in combination with other compounds taught herein, and with other active agents. Such compounds, alone or in combination with active agents, may be admixed with compositions and such compositions may be used as treatment devices, or may be added to medical devices. The compounds taught herein, singly or in combination with active agents, alone or in compositions, may be added to fibers, substrates or other surfaces to render such surfaces antimicrobial. Such antimicrobial surfaces may be wound care devices, medical devices, patient care devices or other devices or surfaces where microbial growth is not desired.<br>

ganciclovir, iatrocbnazole miconazole, zinc-pyrithionc, heavy metals including but not limited to platinum or gold, and their combined forms including salts such as halides, saccharinates and complexes with carriers and other forms, or nanoparticles of silver, zinc and copper.<br>
Silver polymer compounds may be prepared from many known methods. Polymers having saccharin, benzimidazole and imidazole moieties are useful for making silver compounds of the present invention. For example, the silver polymeric compounds can be prepared from any end group terminated polymer capable of coupling with amine group and a saccharin sodium salt derivative having an amine group on the aromatic ring. Pre-polymers capable of further reactions are available commercially. Suitable groups reactive to amines are isocyanate, isothiocyanate, carboxylic acid, halocarbonyl and others. Pre-polymers can be polyurethanes, polyethers, polyacrylates, polysiloxanes or others. Amino saccharin can be prepared following the procedure described by Rose &amp; Sanford (J. Chemical. Edu., Volume 47 (no.9), p649-50 (1970) and fully incorporated herein by reference. The resulting polymer with saccharin moiety can be then converted to silver containing polymer by treatment with a silver salt solution (e.g. silver nitrate or perchlorate).<br>
Alternatively, amino saccharin can be treated with a polymer having an acid chloride group containing a polymer to link the saccharin moiety to the polymer via amide link. By treating with a soluble silver salt solution, the resulting polymer can be converted to incorporate bound silver. By treating chloromethyl groups containing polymer with benzimidazole or imidazole attaches the heterocyclic moieties to the polymer. Subsequent treatment with silver salt solution adds silver to the polymer.<br>
Maleic anhydride homopolymers or copolymers can be converted to corresponding maleimide polymers that then can be incorporated with silver by treating them with silver salt solution. It is to be understood that, none of above examples are to be taken as limiting the scope of the invention. To the contrary, the selection of a given prep-polymer or given coupling chemistry is merely to illustrate one element of an embodiment of the invention. For preparation of other compounds see U.S. Patent Nos. 3,689486; 3,142,904; 3,933,507; 4,260,677; 5,863,864, all of which are herein incorporated in their entirities. Antimicrobial Wound Care Devices<br>
Generally stated, any wound care device can be rendered antimicrobial using the silver compounds of the present invention. Devices may be dry, as in not containing moisture, or may contain moisture. In use, the devices may be placed in a moisture rich environment or in environments where some moisture may be available, which allows for the release of<br>
42<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/015317	PCT/CS20O5/027260<br>
antimicrobial silver. Such devices may comprise hydrophilic matrices comprising, for example, cellulose ether derivatives, hydroxyl alkyl cellulose ether derivatives, hydroxyl alkyl cellulose derivatives or mixtures thereof, cotton, rayon, acrylics, acetate fibers, alginates and other synthetic and natural polymers and their blends, moisture containing wound dressings, skin contact devices such as monitor leads, wound dressings, hydrated plastic implants, hydrocolloid dressings, dressings used in wet therapy, superabsorbent foams, hydrophilic polyurethane foams, activated charcoal dressings, compresses, xeroform petrolatum dressings, venous, urinary and pain management system catheters, stents, guidewires, shunts, cannulae, catheter adapters and other solid and hollow tubular devices, molded articles such as trachea] tubes, contact lens cases, nebulizers, sutures, incontinence products and feminine hygiene products, ostomy pouches and plugs, respiratory and feeding appliances, contact lenses, hearing aids, haemostats, and urine collection bags as examples.<br>
An aspect of the present invention comprises antimicrobial traditional woven cotton gauzes, and other suitable woven materials like polyesters, rayon, acetate, nylon and nylon blends with cotton can also be used. Gauzes are used in wound management for example to wrap the bandages that cover the wound or clean and prepare a wound for routine cleaning and washing treatment. Gauzes help keep the bandages in place and absorb any excess wound exudate that may leak from wounds. Gauzes may be single ply or multi-ply. The numbers of ply are not limiting in the practice of the present invention, and any woven or nonwoven material, used in this fashion, that can be rendered antimicrobial using the methods of the present invention, are contemplated herein. Gauze material may be dyed with color or bleached plain white. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the ply number of cotton gauze material is immaterial to the practice of the invention. Though the preferred gauze material has ply number between 1 and 6 (both inclusive). However this range of gauze ply number should not be construed as limiting. Silver treated gauze materials with higher ply numbers are also within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Antimicrobial treatment of the gauze materials such as woven or non-woven can be carried out by different methods. One illustrative method used is as follows. Dry cotton gauze material was soaked in the aqueous solution of silver nitrate, blotted to remove excess liquid then soaked in the second solution of sodium saccharinate, re-blotted to remove excess liquid and dried. Dipping in the second solution precipitated fine silver saccharinate particles onto the gauze fibers. The method can be applied to treat woven or non-woven materials made from rayon, acrylics, polyester and their blends with cotton. In the alternative, for instance, the gauze<br>
43<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/015317	PCT/US2005/027260<br>
material can be treated first with sodium saccharinate and then treated with silver nitrate solution with the blotting steps remaining unchanged. In another method of preparing antimicrobial gauze material, a suspension of silver saccharinate was pre-made by mixing solutions of silver nitrate and sodium saccharinate in the presence of surfactants such as polysorbates. Dry gauze material was then dipped in the silver suspension, blotted and dried in the oven.<br>
In these methods, silver nitrate solution concentrations may range from about 0.001 M to about 2.0M, from about 0.01 M to about 0.5M, from about 0.05 M to about 1.5 M, from about 0.01 to about 1.0 M, from about 0.001 to about 1.0 M, and from about 1.0 M to about 2.0 M, and from 0.001 to about 0.5 M. Sodium saccharinate concentration scan range from about 0.0008 M to about 3.0 M, from about 0.01 M to about 0.75 M, from about 0.001 to about 2 M, from about 0.01 to about 1 M, from about 0.0001 to about 0.01 M, and from about 2 M to about 3 M.<br>
Surfactants play a useful role in the preparation of the suspension as the surfactants help keep the particles of silver saccharinate below certain size and also prevent or retard their agglomeration. Surfactants can come from classes other than polysorbates but are surfactants that are generally soluble in water or in water-organic solvent mixtures are useful. Surfactants include polysorbates such as Twecn 20. Surfactant concentration in silver saccharinate suspension can vary between 0.5 gm/liter and 100 gm/liter and is preferably between 2 gm/liter and 8 gm/liter with a range of 4 to 6 gm/liter being most suitable. The mode of contact of gauze material with the silver salt solution and sodium saccharinate solution is not limited to soaking. The contact can be made in various ways that are known to those ordinarily skilled in the art. For example, solutions can be sprayed or dripped onto the gauze. Further, the blotting step described here to remove excess liquid from gauze is also not limiting. Liquid removal can be carried out by squeezing the gauze between pair of rollers or by centrifuge operation and other processes used in the textile industry. Besides sodium, other saccharinates of potassium, calcium, lithium can be used. As a source of silver ions, many soluble silver salts including but not confined to those of nitrate, acetate, lactate, citrate, and perchlorate can be used. Generally, a molar excess of saccharinate over silver is used to ensure complete conversion of silver to the silver saccharinate complex, though less than or equal to a stoichiometric amount can also be used. If a very low mole ratio of sodium saccharinate to silver salt is used, the treated device may show some discoloration upon light exposure from residual silver nitrate. Therefore, mole ratios of saccharinate to silver less than 0.8 may not be suitable for some treatments of gauze materials. Typically the present invention contemplates a molar excess ratio between 0.8 and 2.0 though ratios higher than 2.0 are not outside the scope of the invention. A useful mole ratio<br>
44<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/015317	PCT/US2005/027260<br>
is between 1 and 1.5. Hie use of water as a solvent in the preparation of salt solutions is also not restrictive, and any solvent that adequately dissolves the compounds is contemplated by the invention.<br>
Many materials used for medical and wound care products are intended to gel in the presence of water. This property interferes with methods of making the material antimicrobial using water-containing solutions, and can be overcome by using a non-aqueous vehicle during the treatment of the materials with silver compounds. Solvents that can be used in mixtures with water in the practice of the invention are lower alkyl straight chain and branched alcohols (Cl to C5), acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, diacetone alcohol, ethyl acetate and tetrahydrofuran. Other solvents that are generally miscible with water can be also employed. Organic solvents alone (without water) can also be used in the present invention. Useful solvents are water, ethanol, isopropanol and acetone. The composition of water and organic solvents mixture, such as water and ethanol, water and isopropanol, or water and acetone, can vary from 0 % water to 100% water with water between 0 % and 50 % useful.<br>
The silver loading, or the amount of silver in a finished product, whether it is a device or composition, of a given antimicrobial device is generally determined by how the amount of time the device will be in use. Thus it is desirable to control the duration over which the sustained release of antimicrobial silver is effective. The need for activity over 5 days of use requires higher amounts of total silver than a device used for a shorter amount of time. In an antimicrobial medical device of the present invention, silver content can vary between 50 ppm to 50,000 ppm (ppm as measured based on the weight of the device), though even higher amounts can be considered within the scope of the invention. Silver content for cotton gauze materials for sustained release activity for 5 to 7 days may be between 2000 and 10,000 ppm. The ply number of cotton gauze material is immaterial to the practice of the invention.<br>
Methods of drying gauze materials by exposure to high temperature environments are also not limiting. Other types of drying processes such as infrared, contact drying, steam drying, and freeze drying can be employed in the practice of the invention. The drying temperature is determined by the reasonable duration available for drying and the sensitivity of the silver compound impregnating the gauze material to heat. The drying temperature for silver containing gauze material is between 25° C and 135° C. In the case of silver saccharinate containing gauze materials, brief exposure to higher temperatures up to 150°C can be tolerated.<br>
Examples of successful silver treatment of fabric materials rendered antimicrobial used the commercially available products Bulkee II®, Avant® cotton/rayon drain sponges, Sofform<br>

® polyester bandages, Ready Bath® body wipe cloth from Medline Industries, Mundelein EL and Curity® gauze from Tyco Healthcare Company, Mansfield, MA as the stock matrix.<br>
The antimicrobial activity can be imparted to a variety of wound care devices having different end uses. One can treat collagen based matrix, superabsorbent dressing materials such as carboxy methyl cellulose/alginate fiber sheets, acrylate-based super absorbents used in diapers and other incontinence devices, alginate fibers sheets and tows, modified cellulose fiber materials, bamboo fiber materials, alginate foam sheets, hydrophilic polyurethane foams, alginate powder and chitosan powder. Select examples that are commercially available include Maxorb® carboxy methyl cellulose/alginate fiber sheets from Medline Industries, alginate fiber sheets from AMS of UK and DeRoyal Inc of Tennessee, alginate fiber tow from MedTrade Ltd of UK, DeRoyal Inc. of Tennessee, Tegagen® from 3M of Minnesota, alginate foam sheets from Kuraray Industries of Japan, alginate powder from Sigma-Aldrich Co. and hydrophilic foam materials Rynel 562 from Rynel Corporation, Maine and Prepol® based foams from Lendell Manufacturing Inc. of Michigan. Example of collagen based matrix amenable to silver treatment by the present invention is Integra® bilayer matrix wound dressing from Integra Iifesciences New Jersey.<br>
In the treatment of the aforementioned matrices with the exception of collagen and polyurethane foams matrices, the salt solutions are preferably made in non-aqueous solvents or predominantly non-aqueous solvents because of the tendency of these matrices to absorb water. Those familiar with these matrices will recognize that once the matrices absorb water their mechanical integrity is modified (i.e. they generally become permanently stiff and warped). They also completely lose their ability to return to their original fluffy state and their ability to absorb water is irreversibly lost. However, collagen matrix can generally be treated the same way as gauze material using aqueous salt solutions.<br>
The methods of the present invention can also be used for devices other than wound care devices. For example, a device comprises a contact lens. Lenses were treated first with silver nitrate solution, briefly rinsed with water and then soaked in a sodium saccharinate solution to form the silver saccharinate complex in the hydrophilic lens matrix. After rinsing the lens were dried in ambient atmosphere. In testing, the treated lenses were found to be antimicrobial.<br>
The present invention comprises catheters having surfaces comprising silver compounds. The catheters can be made of silicon based polymers, polyurethanes, latex based, polyvinyl chloride or other biocompatible polymers. Catheters may or may not possess lubricious surfaces and can be treated to deposit silver, which then can be released in a sustained release fashion<br>
46<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/015317	PCT/US2005/027260<br>
from the surface. Catheters having hydrophilic (Iubricious) surfaces can be treated in manner similar to gauze materials. The methods of the present invention deposit fine particles of silver saccharinate in the hydrophilic lubricious coating on the catheter. It is to be understood that the use of silver saccharinate is not to be construed as limiting.<br>
5	In another embodiment, catheters can be made antimicrobial using silver compounds<br>
disclosed herein, by coating them with silver containing compositions, See Example 23.<br>
Instead of dipping, coatings may also be applied by spraying the solution or by<br>
dispensing solution in patterns from syringes under pressure in commercially available<br>
dispensing devices. Coating compositions containing silver compounds may be non-aqueous or<br>
&gt; aqueous. They may contain mixtures of polymers that may be synthetic or natural. The synthetic polymers may be polyurethane resins, acrylatc resins, acetal resins, polyimides, polyamides, polyacarbonates and other known to those skilled in developing and formulating coating compositions. The synthetic polymers may be homopolymers or copolymers and natural polymers may be further chemically modified. Examples of natural polymers are cellulose ethers, rosins, casein and others.<br>
The present invention comprises methods for making hydrocolloid dressings antimicrobial using silver compounds of the present invention. Examples are Flexigel® dressing from commercially available from Smith &amp; Nephew Inc. of Largo, Florida, various hydrogel type sheet products (Aquadapt® hydrogel foam) from Hydromer Lie of New Jersey. Dressings can be in continuous sheet form or strands. In one method, the dressing was hydrated successively with sodium saccharinate solution and silver nitrate solution to precipitate silver saccharinate inside and on the dressing surface. In an alternative method, the silver saccharinate was precipitated in fine particle form in the polymerization mixture and subsequently cross-linked, formed and dehydrated. This method is described in detail in US Patent No. 6,605,751 which is incorporated herein by reference. Similarly the silver saccharinate can be precipitated in situ during the preparation of Aquadapt® foam. To illustrate the construct of silver containing Aquadapt® foam, silver saccharinate suspension was formed by mixing equal volumes of 0.1M aqueous solutions of silver nitrate and sodium saccharinate to the mixture disclosed in example 5 of US 5,420,197. The amount of silver saccharinate suspension can be controlled depending upon the silver content desired in the finished foam.<br>
In various embodiments disclosed herein, silver compounds are formed in situ for incorporation into medical devices. Silver saccharinate or other silver compounds of the present invention can be added in solid form as dry powder or in many other forms ordinarily known to<br>
47<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/015317	PCT/US2005/027260<br>
those skilled in the art. For example, silver compounds of the present invention can be dispersed on physiologically inert supports, and porous filler materials, both inorganic (silicate powders) and organic (silicone microspheres) can be impregnated with silver compounds, that then can be incorporated into different medical devices and dressings following normal production methods. In another method, silver compounds can be encapsulated in micro-particles and then utilized as reservoirs of silver by blending the silver microparticles in lotion and cream formulations. Such an approach may yield a matrix that in addition to providing a silver ion reservoir may also not discolor in response to light and heat In yet another approach, silver compounds may be deposited by vapor or vacuum deposition techniques similar to those disclosed in US Patent No. 4,728,323.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is an improved hydrocolloid dressing containing silver saccharinate that does not discolor with time. For example, HexigeKD dressings commercially available from Smith &amp; Nephew Inc. of Largo, Florida after incorporation of silver saccharinate may slowly discolor to brown over time. Such dressing can be improved to resist discoloration by light by hydrating the dressing with hydrogen peroxide. To have the intended effect, the concentration of hydrogen peroxide in the dressing may be between 0.01 % and 10.0 % and is preferably 
Another class of dressings that are amenable to antimicrobial treatment using silver compounds is the wet therapy dressing. In wound management, such dressings facilitate the debridement of wounds. The dressing usually is composed of hydrated layer of polyacrylate based cross-linked polymer having high water absorbency that is held in a polypropylene cloth pouch. In rendering the dressing antimicrobial using the methods of the present invention, TenderWet® Active dressing (4"x4")was first wet with a pre-formed suspension of silver saccharinate followed by the addition of Ringer's solution (an aqueous mixture of sodium chloride, potassium chloride and calcium chloride). The total amount of liquids added per dressing was approximately 30 gm and the amount of silver in the liquids was varied between 0.007% w/w to 1% w/w with preferred amount of silver between 0.01% and 0.025%. By maintaining at least 0.01% w/w of silver in the soaking liquids, antimicrobial activity was sustained for over 3 days. Following steam sterilization under 122° C for over 90 minutes, the dressing with silver saccharinate showed no discoloration. Continuous light exposure for 24 h also did not cause any graying of the dressing. In contrast, the dressing made with silver chloride at the same silver content discolored after sterilization step and also after light exposure.<br>

Medical devices in the form of silver containing adhesive films having antimicrobial activity can be formed using silver compounds of the present invention. One embodiment comprises a laminated construct of polyurethane film having an adhesive layer containing antimicrobial silver. An example of such construct without silver is an OpSite® dressing commercially available from Smith and Nephew. By incorporating silver saccharinate in the adhesive and depositing the adhesive on the polyurethane layer, one can impart antimicrobial activity to the film construct. When used to cover incision sites or IV sites, such constructs can potentially reduce infection related incidents after surgery. Such constructs are transparent and non-discoloring due to the presence of more light stable silver can allow for inspection of wounds or any reddening of underlying skin. This would be a significant advance over the prior art where the silver containing adhesive films are not white but brown in color (Arglaes® silver film from Medline Industries, Mundelein, IL). See Example AD24. Antimicrobial Compositions<br>
Compositions of the present invention comprise the silver compounds taught herein. Composition comprise a suspension of the silver compound in an aqueous or nonaqueous solution, or can be a mixture or admixture of the silver compound in a formulation that is generally known for treatment of skin, dermal, topical, covering, or other surfaces treatments. The present invention comprises compositions comprising creams and lotions, gels, ointments, pessaries, impregnated inorganic and organic carriers, and coatings (aqueous and non-aqueous). Compositions may be used in treating minor infections of sldns, acute and chronic wounds, pressure sores, burns, burn wounds and ulcers, other skin lesions, infections of mucous membranes and other infections or maladies caused by bacteria, viruses, yeasts, fungi, molds, mildew, protozoa and microbes. The antimicrobial property can be imparted to cosmetics products such as skin wraps, compresses for acne and blemishes, scar reduction, tattoo removal and laser resurfacing; to personal and skin care products such as hand creams or lotions, conditioners, barrier creams, lubricating preparations. Compositions comprising said silver compounds may be also used to treatment wounds of all types in animals and in control of infection in animals.<br>
The methods of preparation of compositions such as creams and lotions are well known in the literature. An antimicrobial cream comprising silver saccharinate was prepared and is taught in Example AD25. In general, to a pre-made dermal cream base, appropriate amounts of a sodium saccharinate solution and a silver nitrate solutions were added and blended to form an in situ silver saccharinate precipitate. To a petrolatum base, a preformed suspension of silver<br>
49<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/015317	PCT/US2005/027260<br>
sacchaririate was added and mixed to uniformity. When compared to similar creams made with 6ilver chloride, the compositions of the present invention weie not only antimicrobial but also resisted light discoloration for a longer period of time. Antimicrobial creams, lotions and ointments prepared from oil/water and water/oil emulsions and petrolatum base are also contemplated by the present invention. The antimicrobial compositions of the inventions are not limited to non-aqueous creams or lotions, but can also be prepared as amorphous aqueous gel.<br>
A variety of cellulose derivatives may be used in formulating gels into which silver compounds of the present invention can be incorporated. Examples are cellulose derivatives from Dow Chemical and Hercules Inc sold under Methocel®, Natrasol®, and Aqualon® brands. Antimicrobial gel compositions comprising natural polymers or gum such as xanthan gum, guar gum, carageenan, locust bean gum, pectin, alginates, gellan gum or their mixtures with other water soluble polymers are also contemplated by the present invention. Gels may also contain multiple silver compounds or may contain active agents in addition to one or more silver compounds. Additives such as surfactants, emulsifiers, emollients, colorants, humectants, oxidizing agents, pH adjusting agents to promote galvanic reaction with silver may also be present in gel compositions. Gels in which antimicrobial activity is a concomitant property and not the main functionality are encompassed by the present invention.<br>
Gels may comprise synthetic homopolymers and copolymers formed using acrylic acid,<br>
methacrylic acid and their sodium salts, acrylamide, methacrylamide, acrylamide or<br>
methacrylamide with alky] substituents on nitrogen, hydroxyalkyl acrylates, maleic anhydride,<br>
- vinyl pyrrolidone, vinyl 2-ethyl oxazoHne, methyl vinyl ether. These polymers are<br>
commercially available from a variety of sources.<br>
Gel compositions exhibiting sustained release of antimicrobial silver compounds of the present invention may comprise varying amounts of the said compounds depending on the end use. For minor cuts and wounds, daily application of gels may be needed thus requiring only small amounts of silver. Hand sanitizing gels also may comprise of only a small amount of silver, from 100 ppm to 500 ppm based on gel weight. On the other hand in situations where wound bandages are changed every few days, gels having a greater amount of silver are required to maintain antimicrobial levels in the wound site. The amount of silver compounds can vary from 10 ppm to 50,000 ppm and from between 50 ppm and 20,000 ppm and values ranging between 500 ppm and 10000 ppm, based on gel weight.<br>
Adhesives compositions having antimicrobial activity for use in skin bandages and other similar bandages may contain silver compounds of the present invention in dispersed form in the<br>
50<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/015317	PCT/US2005/027260<br>
adhesive. In one embodiment, silver containing adhesive was compounded as follows. To an adhesive in a non-aqueous solvent, stabilized silver saccharinate suspension was added and mixed to nniformity and a thin film of adhesive mixture was applied on polyurcthane film and dried to remove the solvent and finally covered with release liner. See Example 24. Other methods commonly known in the art can be employed to prepare an adhesive composition and laminated film construct, without departing from the scope of the invention. The class of adhesives is generally not important to formulating the adhesive composition. However, base adhesives that are biocompatible and have a low glass transition temperature such as, polyacrylates {crosslinked or linear) and polyurethanes are contemplated. However base adhesive compositions are not limited to synthetic polymers. Natural polymers such as casein or starch can also be used in formulating silver containing adhesive compositions. Other ingredients may be added to improve characteristics of the adhesive compositions without affecting the antimicrobial property. For instance, humectants such as glycerol, propylene glycol may be added to increase water retention. Stabilizers such as copper chloride or other cupric salts, citrate, or lactate may be added for improving stability against light discoloration. Surfactants may be added to increase the stability of the composition and prevent ingredients from separating out. The amount of silver in adhesive compositions comprising silver compounds of the present invention is typically between 10 ppm and 50000 ppm or a range between 500 ppm and 20000 ppm or a range between 1000 ppm and 10000 ppm.<br>
Antimicrobial formulations for the application to devices may be aqueous or non-aqueous, and where such formulations are used to coat devices or surfaces are referred to herein as coatings. An aqueous composition may be made of any water soluble polymer wherein any of the silver compounds disclosed may be dispersed or formed in situ. Besides the polymeric component, other ingredients may be added to for stability, dispersibility, compatibility wet lubricity, and improving plasticity. Ingredients that are self cross-linkable or cross-link with other components may be present. The resulting dry coating, while improving wet lubricity, can be hydrated in water (moist or humid air environment) but is incapable of self dissolution and can act as the reservoir for silver for slow sustained release for persistent antimicrobial action on the surface.<br>
Coatings comprising non-aqueous solvents and silver compounds are also contemplated by the present invention. Such coatings may offer the advantage of drying quickly after application. Often such coating compositions comprise a polymeric ingredient that may possess some affinity for water. After application, the dried coating may be able to absorb enough water<br>

WO 2006/015317	PCT/US2005/027260<br>
from the ambient atmosphere to maintain an inhibitory level" of silver ions to prevent growth of microbes on the surfaces. Such coating compositions may be useful to coat inside of HVAC ducte, shower curtains, surgery room drapes or simply sprayed as a mist wherever one wants to leave an antimicrobial coat to prevent microbial growth. For example, Buch coating compositions may be well suited in the preparation of antimicrobial contact lens cases. Coating compositions of the present invention do not necessary have to contain polymeric ingredient Compositions may simply be in form of a stabilized suspension that may be sprayed in the form of mist and wiped down e.g. on table tops, medical lab benches, surgery room carts to make surfaces germ free.<br>
Dental or oral hygiene compositions comprising silver compounds of the present invention are contemplated. Dental compositions include temporary dental cements, fillings and adhesives or bases for holding dentures in place. Oral hygiene compositions in the prevention and control of bad breath may include the silver compounds of the present invention. Those ordinarily skilled in the art will readily recognize that the amount of silver must be optimized to meet the specific requirement of each application in the dental compositions and products. Preferred amount of silver in the dental or oral hygiene compositions of the present invention is below 50000 ppm.<br>
Silver compounds of the present invention may also be used in variety of household products. Gels for bathroom use, mops for floor cleaning, scouring pads may be incorporated with silver compounds and rendered antimicrobial.<br>
Other compositions that may utilize silver compounds of the present invention are aqueous ink compositions. Inks may be dye based or stabilized pigment based. More specifically, the ink compositions that are used in drop on demand ink jet printers such Epson Stylus® and HP desk jet® series printers. Silver compounds can readily provide sufficient antimicrobial activity to prevent fungi and bacteria from growing and improving ink cartridge shelf life.<br>

Example 8 Chitosan powder<br>
In a cup, chitosan powder (0.5g), EPA (2 ml) and de-ionized water (18 ml) were mixed and stirred. In a test tube, silver saccharinate was precipitated by successively adding sodium saccharinate (1 ml, 0.125 M) and silver nitrate (1 ml, 0.1 M). The silver saccharinate suspension was dripped into the stirred suspension of chitosan powder. After completing addition of silver saccharinate, the chitosan powder suspension was stirred for 0.5 h and then filtered. The filtered solids were washed with 100 ml of water and dried overnight in oven at 45° C.<br>
Example 9 Ointment<br>
In a test tube, Tween 20 (0.05g) was weighed and dissolved in de-ionized water (0.25 ml). Sodium saccharinate (0.45 ml, 1M) solution was added to a test tube followed by silver nitrate (0.355 ml, 1M) to form silver saccharinate. The test tube contents were added to 12 g of petrolatum base (Plastibase brand, Mike's Pharmacy, Vancouver, WA) in a cup and vigorously mixed to a uniform cream with slight white opacity. No color change due to 24h continuous lab light exposure was observed.<br>
Example 10 Ointment using water in oil (w/o) base<br>
The silver containing cream was prepared exactly as in example 9 except the ointment base was a w/o base (Dermabase brand, Mike's Pharmacy, Vancouver, WA). With respect to 24 h lab light exposure results similar to example 9 were observed.<br>
Example 11 Talc powder<br>
Talc powder (3g) was dispersed in IPA/water mixture (5 ml/30 ml). Sodium saccharinate solution (0.06 g/5 ml) in water was added to the stirred suspension. Silver nitrate (0.25 ml, 1 M) was added drop wise to the stirred mixture to precipitate silver saccharinate. The suspension was stirred for 15 minutes. Talc powder with dispersed silver saccharinate was recovered after filtering and drying at 60-65° C.<br>

 <br>
WO 2006/015317	PCT/US2005/027260<br>
Example 12 Cotton Clause<br>
The method of example 1A was modified. 1 foot long cotton gauze (Bulkee brand, Medline Industries, Mundelein, IL) was dipped in a suspension of silver saccharinate prepared by mixing 60 ml of 0.1 M silver nitrate solution and 60 ml 0.125 M sodium saccharin, blotted and dried at 110°C for 12 minutes.<br>
Example 13 Drain sponge<br>
A pair of drain sponges (Avant brand, Medline Industries, Mundelein, IL) was soaked for 1-2 minutes in a suspension of silver saccharinate prepared from 30 ml silver nitrate solution (0.1 M) and 30 ml sodium saccharinate solution (0.125 M). Sponges were blotted to squeeze out excess fluid, dried at 110°C for 12 minutes to yield slightly cream colored silver containing prototypes.<br>
Example 14. Antimicrobial efficacy of devices and compositions of present invention<br>
The antimicrobial activity of the devices and compositions made in the Examples above was verified by standard zone of inhibition microbiology assay using Staphyloccocus aureus bacteria. Disks of 5-7 mm size were cut from treated and untreated gauze and placed on a Mueller Hinton Agar (MHA) plate that was inoculated with bacteria and incubated overnight at 37DC. Treated gauze samples with silver ions showed a clear zone of inhibition around it Untreated gauze and Silvasorb served as negative and positive control, respectively. Other antimicrobial devices were prepared using silver saccharinate. The results from zone of inhibition assay on prepared devices are presented in Table 5. Antimicrobial activity is consistently seen in diverse substrates such as simple cotton gauze, synthetic polymer foam products or collagen sheet.<br>
To verify sustained release of silver from different substrates a serial time transfer test was carried out. The same test gauze disks were transferred to a freshly inoculated MHA plate each day and corresponding zones of inhibition from each successive transfer were measured until there was no activity. From the results presented in Table 6 sustained release of effective amounts of silver for 3 to 7 days is seen depending on silver concentration. Release up to as much as 14 days is observed for collagen sheet demonstrating an important aspect of the present invention. Similar sustained release activity lasting about 7 days against gram negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa is also seen (Table 7).<br>

 <br>
WO 2006/015317	PCT/US2005/027260<br>
Several substrates were also tested for broad-based activity against a set of microbes including gram positive, gram negative, yeast and fungi. In all cases silver saccharinate containing substrates were active (Table 8).<br>
The thermal and light discoloration resistance of various gauzes prepared using silver saccharinate can be assessed from the results in Table 9. The thermal resistance is important because often these products undergo drying steps in manufacturing where they are exposed to higher temperatures. In addition to thermal resistance, resistance to discoloration is not only important for aesthetic reasons but also for allowing the packaging operations a time interval to operate without having to take special measures to protect from light A 24 h time window could be considered reasonable for packaging operations. The results show that various gauze samples impregnated with silver saccharinate are not discolored after 24 h light exposure. In contrast the samples made identically but with silver chloride are badly discolored. Further, gauze subjected to 135° C for 12 minutes did not discolor even after additional 24 h exposure (total 48 h). Some of the substrates made with silver saccharinate as active ingredient were tested for cytotoxicity using agarose overlay test. The results indicated that samples with

Four (1x1") pieces of 1.6 mm thick polyurethane (PU) foam (Medical grade 562-6) from Rynel Corporation of Boothbay, ME were soaked in silver saccharinate suspension. To prepare the suspension, Tween 20 (0.05 g) and hydrogen peroxide (0.5 mL, 30%) were added to the sodium saccharinate (5.5 mL, 0.125M) solution, followed by silver nitrate (5.5 mL, 0.1M). After mixing few minutes on vortex mixer, the suspension was poured on four foam pieces laid out in a 6" petri-dish and allowed to soak for a brief period. After blotting away excess liquid with paper, the foam samples were dried at 45C for 0.5h. The samples left out on bench for 24h ambient light exposure and observed for color change. The exposed sample discolored to purple black but those protected from light were unchanged and in all respect identical to untreated foam. The silver treated foam was found to be antimicrobial and showed sustained ionic silver release. An assortment of PU foam samples from Lendell Manufacturing Company of St. Charles, MI were impregnated with silver saccharinate in a similar fashion. Each foam sample was antimicrobial against Staphylococcus aureus strain. Upon light exposure, the silver impregnated foams became discolored turning light rust colored, purple black and ash grey. Unexposed silver impregnated foam samples did not discolor and in color were no different from the untreated foam.<br>
