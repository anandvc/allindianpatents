SANOFI-SYNTHELABO,   of  174,  Avenue  de  France,   F-75013  Paris, France,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
WO 01/05776<br><br>
1<br><br>
PCT/FR00/01995<br><br>
AMINOTHIAZOLE DERIVATIVES AND THEIR USE AS CRF RECEPTOR<br>
LIGANDS The present invention relates to novel branched aminothiazole derivatives, to a process for 5  preparing them and to pharmaceutical compositions<br>
containing them. These novel thiazole derivatives have<br>
antagonist activity towards CRF (corticotropin<br>
releasing factor) and can thus constitute active<br>
principles for pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
10	Corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) is a<br>
peptide whose sequence of 41 amino acids was characterized by W. Vale et al. in 1981 (Science, 1981, 213, 1394-1397). CRF is the main endogenous factor involved in regulating the hypothalamo-hypophyso-15  adrenal axis (release of adrenocorticotropic hormone: ACTH) and its pathologies, as well as in the depressive syndromes arising therefrom. CRF also brings about the secretion of P-endorphin, P-lipotropin and corticosterone. CRF is thus the physiological regulator 20 of the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and more generally of peptides derived from propiomelanocortin (POMC). Besides its location in the hypothalamus, CRF is also widely distributed in the central nervous system, as well as in extra-neuronal<br>
25 tissues such as the adrenal glands and the testicles. The presence of CRF has also been demonstrated in the course of inflammatory processes.<br><br>
2<br>
Numerous animal experiments have shown that the central administration of CRF causes various anxiogenic effects such as modification of the behaviour in general: for example neophobia, reduction 5  in sexual receptivity, decrease in food consumption and in slow-wave sleep in rats. The intracerebroventricular injection of CRF also increases the excitation of the noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus which is often associated in animals with a state of anxiety. In 10 rats, the central or peripheral administration of CRF or of similar peptides (for example urocortine or sauvagine) induces, in addition to central effects such as heightening consciousness and emotional reactivity towards the environment, modifications in gastric 15  drainage, in acid secretion, in intestinal transit and in faecal excretion, as well as tension effects. CRF is also involved in the complex regulation of inflammatory responses, firstly with a pro-inflammatory role in certain animal models, and secondly as an inhibitor of 2 0  the effects induced by increasing the vascular permeability following inflammation.<br>
The use of a peptide antagonist, alpha-helical CRF (9-41) (oc-CRF) or of specific antibodies (Rivier J. et al., Science, 1984, 224, 889-891)<br>
25 confirms the role of this peptide in all of these<br>
effects. These experiments also confirmed the important role of CRF in man in the integration of the complex<br><br>
3<br>
responses observed during a physiological, psychological or immunological stress both in neuroendocrinal and visceral as well as behavioural terms (Morley J.E. et al., Endocrine Review, 1987, 8, 5  3, 256-287; Smith M.A. et al., Horm. Res., 1989, 31, 66-71). In addition, clinical data argue in favour of the effective involvement of CRF in the many disorders resulting from a condition of stress (Gulley L.R. et al., J. Clin. Psychiatry, 1993, 54, 1, (suppl.), 16-10  19), for example:<br>
-	the existence of the CRF test (i.v. administration)<br>
in man has made it possible to demonstrate the<br>
modification of the ACTH response in depressive<br>
patients (Breier A. et al., Am. J. Psychiatry, 1987,<br>
15  144, 1419-1425),<br>
-	the discovery of a hypersecretion of endogenous CRF<br>
in certain pathologies, for example an elevated level of CRF in the cephalorrachidian fluid in non-medicated patients who are depressed or suffering from a dementia 20 such as Alzheimer's disease (Nemeroff C.B. et al., Science, 1984, 226, 4680, 1342-1343; Regul. Pept., 1989, 25, 123-130), or a decreased density of CRF receptors in the cortex of suicide victims (Nemeroff C.B. et al., Arch. Gen. Psychiatry, 1988, 45, 577-579),<br>
25 - the dysfunctioning of CRF-dependent neurons is even suggested in severe pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's chorea and<br><br>
4<br>
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (De Souza E.B., Hospital<br>
Practice, 1988, 23, 59).<br>
The central administration of CRF in many animal species produces behavioural effects similar to 5  those obtained in man under stress conditions. When they are repeated over time, these effects may result in various pathologies such as: fatigue, hypertension,<br>
cardiac and tension disorders, modification of gastric<br>
)	drainage or of faecal excretion (colitis, irritable<br>
10  bowel), modification of acid secretion, hyperglycaemia, retarded growth, anorexia, neophobia, migraines, reproductive disorders, immunosuppression (inflammatory processes, multiple infections and cancers) and various neuropsychiatric disorders (depression, anorexia 15 nervosa and anxiety).<br>
The intracerebroventricular injection of the reference peptide antagonist, oc-CRF, prevents the effects obtained either by administration of exogenous CRF or by the use of stress-inducing agents (ether, 20  restraint, noise, electric shock, ethanol withdrawal<br>
symptoms or surgery) which are capable by themselves of inducing an increase in the level of endogenous CRF. These results are confirmed by the study of many antagonist peptide molecules that are structurally 25 similar to CRF and that have a prolonged duration of action relative to cc-CRF (Rivier J. et al., J. Med. Chem., 1993, 36, 2851-2859; Menzaghi F. et al., J.  .-<br><br>
5<br>
Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 1994, 269, 2, 564-572; Hernandez J.F. et al., J. Med. Chem. , 1993, 36, 2860-2867).<br>
Such CRF-antagonist peptide compounds are described, for example, in US patents 5 109 111,<br>
5  5 132 111 and 5 -245 009 and in patent applications WO 92/22576 and WO 96/19499.<br>
In addition, preliminary studies have shown that tricyclic antidepressants can modulate the level of CRF as well as the number ef "CRF receptors in the 10 brain (Grigoriadis D.E. et al.,<br>
Neuropsychopharmacology, 1989, 2, 53-60). Similarly, benzodiazepine anxiolytic agents are capable of reversing the effect of CRF (Britton K.T. et al., Psychopharmacology, 1988, 94, 306), although the 15 mechanism of action of these substances has not been entirely elucidated. These results reinforce, if necessary, the growing need for non-peptide antagonist molecules for CRF receptors.<br>
It is also important to point out three 2 0 possible consequences of conditions of chronic stress, namely immunodepression, fertility disorders and the development of diabetes.<br>
CRF exerts such effects by interacting with specific membrane receptors which have been 25 characterized in the pituitary gland and the brain of many species (mice, rats and man) as well as in the<br><br>
6<br>
heart, the skeletal muscle (rats and mice) and in the myometrium and the placenta during pregnancy.<br>
A large number of 2-aminothiazole derivatives are already known. Patent application EP 462 264 5  describes 2-aminothiazole derivatives, in which the<br>
tertiary amine in position 2 comprises two substituents each containing at least one hetero atom including an amine derivative. These compounds are platelet ■ activation factor antagonists' (PAF-acether) and find 10  their applications in the treatment of asthma, certain allergic or inflammatory conditions, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension and various renal pathologies, or alternatively as contraceptive agents.<br>
Patent application GB 2 022 285 describes 15 compounds with regulatory activity on the-immune<br>
response and with anti-inflammatory properties. These are thiazole derivatives substituted in position 2 with secondary amine groups.<br>
Certain 2-acylaminothiazole derivatives have 20 been described in patent application EP 432 040. These compounds are antagonists of cholecystokinin and gastrin.<br>
2-Amino-4,5-diphenylthiazole derivatives with anti-inflammatory properties are also known (patent<br>
25 application JP-01 75 475).<br>
2-Amino-4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)thiazole<br>
derivatives which are useful as synthetic intermediates<br><br>
7<br>
for the preparation of 2,2-diarylchromenothiazole derivatives are also known (patent application EP 205 069).<br>
2-(N-Methyl-N-benzylamino)thiazole 5 derivatives are also described in J. Chem. Soc. Perkin, Trans. 1, 1984, 2, 147-153 and in J. Chem. Soc. Perkin, Trans. 1, 1983, 2, 341-347.<br>
Patent application WO 94/01423 describes 2-<br>
aminothiazole derivatives. These compounds are used as 10  insecticides; .they carry no substitution in position 5 of the heterocycle.<br>
Similarly, patent application WO  96/16650<br>
describes compounds derived from 2-aminothiazole. These<br>
compounds are used as antibiotics.<br>
15	Patent application EP 283 390 describes,<br>
among other thiazole derivatives, 2-(N-alkyl-N-<br>
pyridylalkylamino)thiazole derivatives in which the<br>
amine in position 2 is substituted with an unbranched<br>
pyridylalkyl radical.<br>
2 0	These compounds in particular have<br>
stimulatory activity on central cholinergic transmission. They can thus be used as muscarine receptor agonists and find their applications in the treatment of memory disorders and senile dementias.<br>
25	2-Aminothiazole derivatives in which the<br>
amine in position 2 is a tertiary amine bearing a branched alkyl or aralkyl substituent have been<br><br>
8<br>
described in EP 576 350 and in EP 659 747 as having<br>
affinity for the CRF receptors. None of these compounds<br>
carries a substituted phenyl as a substituent of the<br>
tertiary amine in position 2 of the thiazole nucleus.<br>
5	US patent 5 063 245 describes CRF antagonists<br>
which allow the in vitro  displacement of the binding of<br>
CRF to its specific receptors at a concentration in the<br>
region of one micromole. Numerous patent applications<br>
regarding non-peptide molecules have since been<br>
10 published, for example patent applications WO 94/13643,<br>
WO 94/13644, WO 94/13661, WO 94/13676, WO 94/13677,<br>
WO 94/10333, WO 95/00640, WO 95/10506, WO 95/13372,<br>
WO 95/33727, WO 95/33750, WO 95/34563, EP 691 128 or<br>
EP 729 758.<br>
15	It has now been found according to the<br>
present invention that certain branched aminothiazole<br>
derivatives, which are the subject of the present<br>
invention, have excellent affinity towards CRF<br>
receptors. Furthermore, given their structure, these<br>
2 0 molecules have good dispersibility and/or solubility in<br>
solvents or solutions commonly used therapeutically<br>
which gives them pharmacological activity, and also<br>
allow the easy preparation of oral and parenteral<br>
pharmaceutical forms.<br>
25	This is surprising and unexpected, since the<br>
compounds of the invention are more active in vivo  than compounds of similar structure, in particular by a more<br><br>
9<br>
significant inhibition of the response induced by CRF in the hypothalamo-hypophyso-adrenal axis.<br>

5	The compounds of the invention in free form<br>
generally have weakly basic properties. However, depending on the nature of the substituents, some of them may show acidic properties.<br>
The salts of the compounds of formula (I) 10 with pharmaceutically acceptable acids or bases (when this is possible) are the preferred salts, but those<br>

20 known to those skilled in the art, by the action of c<br><br>

15  in Bull. Chem. Soc. Japan, 1987, 60, 1159-1160 and 2667-2668, or (iii) alternatively by the action of cupric bromide in an organic solvent, such as a mixture of chloroform and ethyl acetate, according to J. Org. Chem. 1964, 29, 3451-3461. As a variant, the compounds 20 of formula (III) can be obtained by the action of 2-bromopropionyl bromide on a substituted benzene of formula:<br><br>
21<br><br><br><br>
in which Ri, R2 and R3 are as defined for (I) , by a<br>
Friedel-Crafts reaction.<br>
5	The ketones mentioned above are generally<br>
known products or commercially-available products. These compounds can be prepared by Friedel-Crafts reaction, in the presence of a Lewis acid, according to methods that are well known to those skilled in the 10  art.<br>

The compounds of formula (I) above also comprise those in which one or more hydrogen or carbon 20 atoms have been replaced with their radioactive<br><br>
23<br>
isotope, for example tritium or carbon-14. Such<br>
labelled compounds are useful in research, metabolism<br>
or pharmacokinetic studies, or alternatively in<br>
biochemical assays as receptor ligands.<br>
5	The compounds of the present invention have<br>
undergone biochemical and pharmacological studies. They show highly advantageous pharmacological properties. The compounds of the invention displace, at concentrations of less than 10 \M,   the binding of CRF 10 or of related iodinated peptides (urotensine,<br>
sauvagine) , for example 125I-tyrosine CRF, to the<br>
receptors present on brain membranes or on cells in<br>
culture, according to the method described by E.B. De<br>
Souza (J. Neurosci., 1987, 7, 1, 88-100).<br>
15	The antagonist activity of the compounds<br>
according to the invention was demonstrated by their ability to inhibit certain activities associated with CRF. In particular, the compounds of formula (I) are capable of inhibiting the secretion of 2 0 adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) induced by CRF. The study on the secretion of ACTH induced by CRF was carried out, in vivo  on conscious rats, according to a method adapted from C. Rivier et al., Endocrinology, 1982, 110 (1), 272-278.<br>
25	CRF is a neuropeptide which controls the<br>
activity of the hypothalamo-hypophyso-adrenal axis.<br><br>
24<br>
This factor is responsible for stress-related<br>
behavioural and endocrine responses.<br>
Specifically, it has been demonstrated that CRF can modulate behaviour and also certain functions 5 of the autonomic nervous system (G.F. Koob, F.E. Bloom, Fed. Proc, 1985, 44, 259; M.R. Brown, L.A. Fisher, Fed. Proc, 1985, 44, 243). More particularly, CRF induces the secretion of corticotropin (ACTH), P~ endorphins and other peptides derived from pro-10 opiomelanocortin (A. Tazi et al., Regul. Peptides,<br>
1987, 18, 37; M.R. Brown et al., Regul. Peptides, 1986, 16, 321; C.L. Williams et al., Am. J. Physiol., 1987, G 582, 253).<br>
The compounds of the invention may thus, be 15 useful in regulating the secretion of these endogenous substances. They find their applications more especially as active principles of medicinal products<br>
for reducing the response to stress (behaviour, emotional states, gastrointestinal and cardiovascular<br>
20  disorders, disorders of the immune system) and more generally in pathologies involving CRF, for example psychiatric disorders, anxiety, depression, anorexia nervosa, epilepsy, sexual activity disorders and fertility disorders, Alzheimer's disease or the like.<br>
25	The compounds of the invention are very<br>
stable and are thus particularly suitable for forming the active principle of medicinal products.<br><br>
25<br>
The invention also extends to pharmaceutical<br>
compositions containing, as active principle, a compound of formula (I) or one of the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, optionally in combination 5 with one or more inert and suitable excipients.<br>
In each dosage unit, the active principle of formula (I) is present in amounts that are suited to the daily doses envisaged. Each dosage unit is appropriately adjusted according to the dosage and the 10  type of administration envisaged, for example tablets, gel capsules and the like, sachets, ampoules, syrups<br>
and the like, drops, transdermal or transmucosal patches, such that such a dosage unit contains 0.5 mg to 800 mg of active principle, preferably 0.5 mg to<br>
15  200 mg.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can also be used in combination with another active principle which is useful for the desired treatment, such as, for example, anxiolytic agents,<br>
2 0 antidepressants or anorexigenie agents.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) are relatively non-toxic; their toxicity is compatible with their use as medicinal products for treating the above disorders and diseases.<br>
25	The compounds of formula (I) can be<br>
formulated in pharmaceutical compositions for<br><br>
26<br>
administration to mammals, including man, for the treatment of the abovementioned diseases.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions thus obtained are advantageously in various forms such as, for<br>
5 example, injectable or drinkable solutions, sugar-coated tablets, tablets or gel capsules. The pharmaceutical compositions containing, as active principle, at least one compound of formula (I) or one of the salts thereof are useful in particular for 10 preventively or curatively treating stress-related<br>
conditions and more generally in the treatment of any pathology involving CRF, such as, for example: Cushing's disease, neuropsychiatry disorders such as depression, anxiety, panic, obessive compulsive 15  disorders, mood disorders, post-traumatic stress, behavioural disorders, aggressiveness, anorexia,, bulimia, hyperglycaemia, premature labour, at-risk pregnancy, retarded growth, sleeping disorders, epilepsy, and all types of depression; Alzheimer's 20 disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's chorea; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; vascular, cardiac and cerebral disorders; sexual activity disorders and fertility disorders; immunodepression, immunosuppression, inflammatory processes, multiple 25 infections, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, uveitis, psoriasis and diabetes; cancers; gastrointestinal functional disorders and inflammations<br><br>
27<br>
arising therefrom (irritable and inflammatory bowel, diarrhoea); pain-perception disorders, fibromyalgias which may or may not be associated with sleeping disorders, fatigue or migraine; symptoms associated 5 with (alcohol) dependency and withdrawal from drugs. The dosage can vary widely as a function of the age, weight and state of health of the patient, the nature and seriousness of the complaint, as well as the route of administration. This dosage comprises the 10 daily administration of one or more doses of<br>
approximately from 0.5 mg to 800 mg, preferably approximately from 0.5 mg to 200 mg.<br>
In the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention for oral, sublingual, subcutaneous, 15 intramuscular, intravenous, transdermal, transmucosal, local or rectal administration, the active principle can be administered in unit forms of administration, as a mixture with conventional pharmaceutical supports, to animals and to human beings. The appropriate unit forms 2 0 of administration comprise oral-route forms such as tablets, gel capsules, powders, granules and oral solutions or suspensions, sublingual and buccal administration forms, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intranasal or intraocular administration<br>
25 forms and rectal administration forms.<br>
When a solid composition is prepared in the form of tablets, the main active principle is mixed<br><br>
28<br>
with a pharmaceutical vehicle such as gelatin, starch, lactose, magnesium stearate, talc, gum arabic or the like. The tablets can be coated with sucrose or other suitable materials, or alternatively they can be 5  treated such that they have sustained or delayed activity and such that they continuously release a predetermined amount of active principle.<br>
A preparation as gel capsules is obtained by mixing the active principle with a diluent and pouring 10  the mixture obtained into soft or hard gel capsules. A preparation in  syrup or elixir form can contain the active principle together with a sweetener, preferably a calorie-free sweetener, methyl paraben and propyl paraben as antiseptic agents, as well as a 15  flavour enhancer and a suitable colorant.<br>
The water-dispersible powders or granules can contain the active principle as a mixture with dispersants or wetting agents, or suspending agents, such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, as well as with 2 0 sweeteners or flavour enhancers.<br>
For rectal administration, use is made of<br>
suppositories which are prepared with binders that melt<br>
at the rectal temperature, for example cocoa butter or<br>
polyethylene glycols.<br>
25	Aqueous suspensions, isotonic saline<br>
solutions or sterile, injectable solutions which contain pharmacologically compatible dispersants and/or<br><br>
29<br>
wetting agents, for example propylene glycol or butylene glycol, are used for parenteral, intranasal or intraocular administration.<br>
For transmucosal administration, the active 5 principle can be formulated in the presence of a promoter such as a bile salt, a hydrophilic polymer such as, for example, hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, hydroxyethy1cellulose, ethylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, dextran, 10 polyvinylpyrrolidone, pectins, starches, gelatin,<br>
casein, acrylic acids, acrylic esters and copolymers<br>
thereof, vinyl polymers or copolymers, vinyl alcohols,<br>
alkoxy polymers, polyethylene oxide polymers,<br>
polyethers or a mixture thereof.<br>
15	The active principle can also be formulated<br>
in the form of microcapsules, optionally with one or more supports or additives.<br>
The active principle can also be in the form<br>
of a complex with a cyclodextrin, for example a-, (3- or 2 0 Y_cycl°dextrin, 2-hydroxypropyl-0-cyclodextrin or methy1-0-cyclodextrin.<br>
The examples which follow, which are given in a non-limiting manner, illustrate the invention.<br>
The methods for synthesizing the various<br>
25 intermediates for obtaining the compounds of the invention are described in the preparations. These<br><br>
30<br>
intermediates are all obtained according to methods that are well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The melting points were measured according to the Micro-Kofler technique and are expressed in degrees 5  Celsius.<br>

A solution of 2.5 g (5.9 mmol) of Compound II'.1  in 30 ml of dimethylformamide is stirred at 0°C 10 and 260 mg (6.5 mmol) of sodium hydride in 60% in oil are added. The reaction mixture is stirred for 2 0 minutes at 0°C, followed by addition of 0.83 ml (7.5 mmol) of an 80% solution of propargyl bromide in toluene. The reaction mixture is stirred for one hour 15 at 10°C, followed by addition, at 0°C, of 2 ml of ethanol and then 50 ml of water. The mixture is extracted with 200 ml of ethyl acetate. The organic phase is washed with water and then with saturated sodium chloride solution, dried over anhydrous sodium 2 0  sulphate and then evaporated to dryness. The crude, residue is chromatographed on a column of silica gel, eluting with 9/1 (v/v) cyclohexane/ethyl acetate.<br>
