Electrical cable coupling for rail/track vehicles<br>
The invention pertains to an electric cable coupling as per the generic term of claim 1.<br>
Such a type of cable coupling is known from DE 29 22 439 A1 (No Indian Patent Available) . The cable coupling is arranged on a carrier below the close coupling. The mechanical central buffer coupling is formed as a close coupling to be connected manually, the two coupling halves of which are joined by means of a coupling sleeve. On the carrier, which consists of two carrier plates arranged vertically to the coupled axle which is placed on the left and right of the coupling pole and joined by means of two tension rods, bores of the bearing are made in the carrier plates for longitudinally sliding bearings of the guiding poles/rods. Besides, the centering organs on the carrier plates are truly aligned. Aligning of the ends of both coupled poles is provided for. The ends of the coupled poles have beads/ rolls, which are overlapped by the coupling sleeve with positive and non-positive fit. Half the cable coupling assigned to every coupled pole, is held by means of springs in the back of the face of the de-coupling position in the mechanical coupling half, and can be pushed in the front in the coupling position for coupling.<br>
When coupling of electrical cable couplings one has to pay attention that only the contacts on the vertical central longitudinal level are coupled properly without any further measures. Contacts of the cable coupling of a vehicle end which are arranged to the left and right of this level, normally lie on the opposite side in case of an end of a neighbouring vehicle that has to be coupled. This problem for e.g. is solved by the fact that the contacts are made redundant, i.e. to the left and right of the vertical, central longitudinal level, similar functioned contacts are placed symmetrically on both sides. For cable couplings that find application only in close couplings to be joined manually, easy/light cable couplings should be provided, which are quick and simple to couple and decouple. However, the reduction in the weight and the construction size are very greatly dependant on the number of contacts located in the contact carrier. The need for<br><br><br>
the present two complete longitudinally moveable cable coupling halves also does not seem justified, when in purely manually operating close couplings, the advantage of saving on personnel and time is not present, when compared with operation of fully automatic central buffer couplings.<br>
A similar cable coupling is known from DE 41 34 322 A1 (No Indian Patent Available), which shows the same disadvantages.<br>
The function of the invention is to improve upon the generic cable coupling for rail vehicles in such a way that the redundant contacts arranged symmetrically to the vertical central longitudinal level is avoidable, and the cable coupling is easier and simpler to make.<br>
The cable coupling described in claim 1 fulfills this function.<br>
Further developments are given in the sub claims 2 to 5.<br>
The advantage of the cable coupling as per the invention as compared to the level of technology is contained especially therein, that instead of having two longitudinally sliding cable coupling halves, only one compact adapter box is sufficient in order to electrically couple two vehicles. Due to the fact that the adapter box component contains special connectors which are arrranged within the adapter box in such a way that a proper connection of the connectors to both the rail vehicles to be coupled takes place, the otherwise necessary double contact arrangement is avoided.<br>
Due to the two-part formation of the longitudinal guide to both sides of the coupling separating point, it is possible to select axial longitudinal sliding of the adapter box to both sides of the coupling separation point, as well as a central placement below, above and/or in free selection at the level of the coupling separation point of the central buffer coupling.<br><br>
Through provision of locking in the area of the coupling separation point, a fixed positioning of the adapter boxes is ensured during operation, while the locking enables a range of sliding position of the vehicle, without the adapter box being able to unnecessarily slide from the longitudinal guide and being possibly damaged during grinding.<br>
Through the formation of a split/column between both the parts of the longitudinal guide in the coupling level, damaging of the longitudinal guide when the coupling halves of the mechanical coupling come together is definitely avoided.<br>
For purposes of repair and especially when an adapter box is placed on both coupling halves of the mechanical coupling that have to be coupled, it is better when it is completely removable from the longitudinal guide.<br>
The invention is explained in detail below on the basis of examples with reference to drawings.<br>
It shows:<br>

buffer coupling and placement of an adapter box below the coupling separation point;<br>
Fig.2	a side view of the adapter box in a sliding position with the assigned<br>

Fig. 4	a diagram presentation of the adapter box in a top view in part section<br>
with internally crossed connections.<br>
A cable coupling for rail vehicles shown in detail in one of the Figs. 1 to 4, is held in a longitudinal sliding position on a mechanical central buffer coupling, especially a so-called close coupling, and shows a compact, longitudinal sliding adapter box 1. The connection of the connectors 2 from the adapter box 1 to both the rail vehicles to be coupled, is done through inter-changeable plug connectors 3 or fixed cables with one plug connector 3 each. The adapter box contains the necessary electrical connector 4, for proper side and function connection of the connectors 2 to the rail vehicles to be coupled, arranged crossed within the adapter box 1, in such a way that it is arranged in a connection 2 to the left of the vertical central longitudinal level and end of the adapter box 1, on the opposite end of the adapter box 2 , symmetrically right to the vertical central longitudinal level and one to the right of the vertical central longitudinal level connection 2, corresponding to the other end of the adapter box 1 to the left.<br>
The longitudinal ability to slide of the adapter box 1 is caused by the two-part linear guide 5, which is preferably placed under the mechanical coupling. The first part 5a of the linear/longitudinal guide 5 is the first central buffer coupling 6a and the second part 5b of the linear guide 5 is the second central buffer coupling 6b of the neighbouring vehicle to be coupled and fixed.<br>
Through this formation a selective, axial longitudinal sliding of the adapter box 1 to both sides of the coupling separation point is possible, as also placement in the coupling level, especially below the coupling separation point of the central buffer couplings 6a and 6b.<br>
For ensuring the middle position of the adapter box on the coupling separation point and/or the sliding/displacement position on the central buffer couplings 6a and 6b respectively, it is provided with a locking device 7. This can for e.g. be done by means<br><br><br>
of a grid or locking elements, which are placed on the coupled poles of the central buffer couplings 6a and 6b, and assigned corresponding counterparts on the adapter box 1.<br>
Both the parts 5a and 5b of the linear guide are slightly pushed back on the opposite side of the vertical level on the coupling separation point and form a split/column 8, in the coupled position of the central buffer couplings, so that damage to the linear guide 5 in case of axial impact of the central buffer couplings 6a and 6b is avoided.<br>
In case of repairs, or if an adapter box 1 is present on both the central buffer couplings 6a and 6b that have to be coupled, then the adapter box 1 and the linear guide 5 are made in such a way that the adapter box 1 can be removed completely from the linear guide 5.<br>
The coupling process takes place through the manual connection of the central buffer couplings 6a and 6b. In the described model example as also in the present level of technology, in the given coupling type the connection takes place by means of a coupling sleeve 9.<br>
An adapter box 1 present on one of the central buffer couplings, for e.g. coupling 6b is pushed towards the coupling separation point on the linear guide 5 and placed preferably symmetrically to the coupling separation point In this position, the adapter box 1 is fixed by means of the locking device 7.<br>
Then the second connection 2 of the vehicle to be coupled is joined with the second side of the adapter box 1 by means of a plug connector 1. If on the coupling point of both the central buffer couplings 6a and 6b there is an adapter box 1 present, then one cane be drawn out from the linear guide 5 and put away. The remainder connection 2 is then joined with the adapter box 1 left<br><br><br>
The decoupling process accordingly takes place in similar steps in a reverse sequence. During this, the adapter box 1 is pushed to the linear guide 1 for mechanical coupling of a vehicle and locked there, before mechanical decoupling. The connectors 2 for the other vehicle remain on the other vehicle or can be removed in case there is a plug connection 3 provided.<br>
The invention can also be used for cable couplings which are meant to also or only connect beam waveguides e.g. glass fibre cables. These type of connectors are covered by the term electrical cable coupling, connector 2 and link connectors 4. It is also possible to connect pneumatic connectors of two vehicles as per the object of this invention, through a modified adapter box 1.<br>
