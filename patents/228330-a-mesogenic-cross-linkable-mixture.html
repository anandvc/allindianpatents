THE	FOLLOWING	SPECIFICATION<br>
PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED. 1<br><br>
The present invention relates to mesogenic, cross-linkable mixtures comprising at least one cross-linkable liquid crystalline host compound and at least one novel chiral or achiral rod shaped compound as additive component, to novel chiral or achiral rod-shaped compounds used for the preparation of these mixtures, to mixtures according to the invention in form of an elastomer, polymer gel, polymer network or polymer film, to polymer networks and liquid crystalline polymer films prepared from these mixtures and to optical or electro-optical components comprising polymer networks and liquid crystalline polymer films prepared from such mixtures. More particularly, it relates to the use of the chiral or achiral rod shaped compounds as components of a cross-linkable liquid crystalline mixture in the production of orientated liquid crystalline polymers, to liquid crystalline mixtures comprising these compounds, to liquid crystalline polymers and liquid crystalline polymer networks prepared from such liquid crystalline mixtures, and to liquid crystalline devices comprising these compounds.<br>
Liquid crystalline polymers (LCPs) are used in the manufacture of optical devices and components such as for example waveguides, optical gratings, filters, retarders, coatings, films, piezoelectric cells and non-linear optical cells. The right choice of the LCP used in any one of the aforementioned optical devices and components depends upon its associated optical properties such as the optical anisotropy, refractive index, transparency and dispersion. Optical filters, for example, contain LCPs having a large anisotropy (∆n) and a low dispersion (n = f(X.)).<br>
Usually LCPs are manufactured by orientating a layer of a cross-linkable liquid crystalline (LC) single compound or of a mixture of different cross-linkable liquid crystalline single compounds on a substrate provided with an orientation layer [e.g. a substrate provided with an orientation layer obtained through rubbing or linear photo-polymerization (LPP)] or by shearing a single cross-linkable liquid crystalline compound or a mixture of different cross-linkable liquid crystalline single compounds along a preferential direction, followed by cross-linking the liquid crystalline layer to form a anisotropic polymer network. In the manufacture of optical components using LCPs, the orientation quality in relation to crucial process parameters, like orientation time, backing temperature, etc, plays a predominant role. The orientation quality is directly related to material parameters, in principle mainly to the macromolecular<br>
2<br><br>
packing in the liquid crystalline state which itself is largely determined by the viscosity of the applied material. It is believed that sub-optimal material parameters are one of the major reasons for preventing good orientation (alignment), for example in the preparation of LCPs films aimed to have a high thickness, or when using materials comprising high molecular weight components (such as dimers, oligomers, etc). Typical orientation defects frequently observed and known to the skilled person are for example schlieren texture, focal conical fan texture, zigzag defects, pre-tilt mono-domain variability, etc. The elimination of these defects can be attempted for example through thermal post backing processes. However, in general these steps are insufficient and do not lead to the required qualities, even when applied over extended time periods (which by itself is clearly a major disadvantage for use in industrial manufacturing processes). LC starting materials having a high-viscosity profile are less suitable for the quick and easy manufacture of oriented films and coatings of high quality.<br>
Cross-linkable liquid crystalline compounds used in the manufacture of LCPs must be chemically and thermally stable, stable to electromagnetic radiation, soluble in standard solvents and miscible with other liquid crystalline components, and should exhibit liquid crystalline properties in the range of - 30 °C to + 150 °C, preferably in the range of 0 °C to 120 °C. The configuration imposed by the orientation layer on the polymerizable liquid crystalline single compounds or mixtures of liquid crystalline single compounds gets frozen in once the LCP network is formed by cross-linking. The resulting LCP films and coatings should preferably have a high viscosity profile and should be stable when exposed to mechanical stresses, elevated temperatures and light.<br>
There is therefore a need for liquid crystalline single compounds or mixtures of liquid crystalline compounds having a broad thermal liquid crystalline range and which can be easily orientated on a substrate prior to cross-linking in such a way that the orientation of the liquid crystalline single compounds or mixtures of liquid crystalline single compounds on the substrate remains stable over the entire time period required for producing the LCP network.<br>
Doping liquid crystalline mixtures with small amounts of certain additives, such as paraffins, offers to a certain extent a known way to optimize the mixture's orientation<br>
3<br><br>
potential without introducing major changes to the physical properties of the underlying key components of the mixture. However, due to incompatibilities occurring at the molecular level between the liquid crystalline compounds and the aforementioned known additives the thermodynamic behavior of the resulting mixture often exhibits unwanted properties, such as a depression of the clearing point, a reduction of the thermal liquid crystalline range, etc, when compared to the host mixture. A further disadvantage frequently seen is the occurrence of miscibility problems between the different components of the mixture, which often leads to difficulties in achieving a uniform orientation of the liquid crystalline materials.<br>
In order to overcome these difficulties the inventors of the present invention have developed a novel class of chiral or achiral additive components comprising at least one polymerizable group. The general molecular architecture of these novel additive components is based on a rod shaped rigid core connected to at least one residue, the latter being responsible for the partial or total suppression of the crystalline or liquid crystalline macromolecular order within the pure (i.e. bulk) additive component. This means that in their pure state the novel chiral or achiral additive components do exhibit low transition temperatures to the isotropic state. The preferred low transition temperatures to the isotropic state of the new additive components according to the invention are equal or below 40 °C. In the context of the present invention the term "pure" for pure additive component should be understood in such a way that the purity level of the material is £ 98 %, when assessing the transition temperature to the isotropic state.<br>
The term "transition temperature to the isotropic state" as used in the context of this invention is defined as the temperature at which the novel additive components change their state from the crystalline or liquid-crystalline state to the isotropic state.<br>
When added in appropriate concentrations to cross-linkable liquid crystalline compounds or to mixtures of cross-linkable liquid crystalline compounds, some structural elements of the novel chiral or achiral additive components according to the invention tend to segregate from the highly polar part of the LC compounds due to the molecular recognition. This in turn is leading to a reduction of the intermolecuiar interactions and as a consequence of this also to a better interaction with the orientation layer and thus to the formation of a monodomain.<br>
4<br><br>
For the sake of illustration purposes and easy reference those parts of the molecular structure of the novel additive components which are believed to be responsible for the partial or total suppression of the crystalline or the liquid crystalline macromolecular order within the pure additive components are indicated with dotted circles in the structure formulas of the schemes and examples listed below.<br>
By doping various cross-linkable LC compounds or cross-linkable LC compound mixtures with appropriate amounts of the newly developed chiral or achiral additive components highly successful results were obtained in the subsequent orientation and cross-linking steps. In fact perfect transformation into thick LCP single layer films were achieved while leaving the optical performance and properties of the underlying (i.e. non-treated) host LC compounds or host LC compound mixtures unchanged. On top of this a considerable enhancement of the orientation speed could be achieved in comparison with the non-doped host LC compounds or host LC compound mixtures, this being a tremendous advantage in large-scale manufacturing processes. Another benefit is the improvement of the reciprocal compatibility of the components of the host mixtures due to the addition of the new additive components. Furthermore, when added to cholesteric mixtures the novel additive components strongly contribute to the fast formation of a helical pitch (P), i.e. to the fast formation of the cholesteric phase.<br>
Thus, the invention provides in a first aspect mixtures, hereinafter also called mixtures of the invention, comprising at least one cross-linkable liquid crystalline compound and at least one chiral or achiral rod shaped novel additive component as described above, wherein the additive component has a rigid core comprising at least two fused or linked, optionally substituted, non-aromatic, aromatic, carbocyclic or heterocyclic groups, and has at least one optionally substituted alkyl residue, and has at least one polymerizable group.<br>
The invention provides in a second aspect novel chiral or achiral rod shaped compounds as additive components, as described above, wherein the additive component has a rigid core comprising at least two fused or linked, optionally substituted, non-aromatic, aromatic, carbocyclic or heterocyclic groups, and has least one optionally substituted alkyl residue, and has at least one polymerizable group.<br>
5<br><br>
The term "optionally substituted" as used in the context of this invention is defined in the subsequent descriptive chapters.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the invention is directed to mesogenic, cross-linkable mixtures comprising:<br>
i)	a cross-linkable liquid crystalline host comprising at least one cross-linkable<br>
liquid crystalline compound, and<br>
ii)	at least one chiral or achiral rod shaped compound as additive component,<br>
wherein said additive component has a rigid core and comprises at least two fused or linked, optionally substituted, non-aromatic, aromatic, carbocyclic or heterocyclic groups, and also comprises at least one optionally substituted alkyl residue, and at least one polymerizable group and wherein the additive component has a transition temperature to the isotropic state of 40 °C or lower.<br>
In another preferred embodiment the invention is directed to mixtures of the invention wherein the additive component has a transition temperature to the isotropic state of 20 °C or lower.<br>
In another preferred embodiment the invention is directed to mixtures of the invention wherein the additive component has a transition temperature to the isotropic state of 0 °C or lower.<br>
In another preferred embodiment the invention is directed to mixtures of the invention wherein the mixtures have a clearing temperature of 30 °C or higher.<br>
In another preferred embodiment the invention is directed to mixtures of the invention wherein the mixtures have a clearing temperature of 50 °C or higher.<br>
In another preferred embodiment the invention is directed to mixtures of the invention wherein the liquid crystalline host has a clearing temperature of 50 °C or higher.<br>
When added to a cholesteric mixture the novel additive components are of particular importance and interest with regard to the quick formation of the cholesteric phase.<br>
6<br><br>
Based on their specific molecular structure the chiral or achiral additive components according to the invention possess a distinctly pronounced ability to shorten the time up to the completion of the formation of the cholesteric phase (in comparison with the time needed for the formation of the cholesteric phase of the reference or host cholesteric mixture).<br>
In the context of this invention the terms "cross-linkable LC host", "host LC compounds", "host LC compound mixtures" or "host cholesteric mixtures" mean LC compounds, LC compound mixtures or cholesteric mixtures prior to the addition of additive components according to the invention.<br>
The term "cross-linkable LC host" as used herein may represent any cross-linkable LC host material such as a cross-linkable LC host compound, cross-linkable LC host compound mixtures and the like.<br>
The term "clearing temperature" as used in the context of this invention means the temperature at which the transition to the isotropic state occurs.<br>
In order to avoid strong clearing point depression in the final LC compound mixtures [i.e. the mixtures comprising the host LC compounds or host LC compound mixtures plus one or more of the additive components according to the invention] the preferred rod shaped additive components are characterized in having molecular structures compatible with or related to the molecular structures of the main components of the underlying host LC compounds or host LC compound mixtures. Speaking in general terms: seen from the molecular structure level the new rod shaped additive components are preferably compatible with the known liquid crystalline compounds used by the persons skilled in the art.<br>
Therefore additive components of formula (I) are the subject of this invention:<br>

8<br><br>
The terms "alkyl" and "alkylene", as used in the context of the present invention, include straight-chain and branched groups, as well as saturated and unsaturated groups.<br>
The terms "polymerizable group" and "polymerization" as used herein are explained and characterized in the following: Usually two main processes are used to convert monomers into polymers, namely a) chain-growth polymerization and b) step-growth polymerization. For the manufacture of anisotropic films based on LC monomers, chain-growth polymerization is the commonly used process. Here all monomers have only one kind of reactive group that can react to give an active center, which rapidly adds to another monomer molecule, then to another, regenerating the active center each time. This is a typical example of a chain reaction and generally continues until two active centers encounter one other (deactivation). In order to generate an active center, through mild conditions, polymerizable monomers should carry a highly reactive functional group. Furthermore, the active center must add exclusively and rapidly to the same polymerizable group of a neighboring monomer. To ensure these two polymerization conditions, both radical and cationic mechanisms are typically mediating chain-growth polymerization processes. These are employing smooth radical respectively cationic initiators that are producing radical or cationic starting residues through intramolecular decomposition by thermal or by light activation. Such initiators are for example those used in photo-resist polymerization processes, e.g. Irgacure® and its derivatives. Polymerizable groups that are able to undergo rapid, selective and efficient radical or cationic processes are generally consisting of an activated carbon-carbon double bond, such as in methacrylates, acrylates, vinyl acetates, vinyl ethers or of double bonds activated by oxidation. Here the activation is ensured through an electron donor group (oxygen, sulfur, etc) or an electron acceptor group (such as carbonyl, nitrile, carboxy, double bonds, aromatic groups, etc.) directly connected to the double bond.<br>

Cross-linkable liquid crystalline compounds which may be used as components of polymerizable liquid crystalline mixtures together with compounds according to the invention are well known to the skilled person. Suitable compounds are described e.g. in patent publications EP 0 331 233, WO 95/24454, US 5,567,349, US 5,650,534, WO 00/04110, WO 00/07975, WO 00/48985, WO 00/55110, WO 00/63154.<br>
At least one of the cross-linkable liquid crystalline compounds used in the mixtures comprising an additive component according to the invention possesses at least one polymerizable group in the chemical structure in order to enable cross-linking. For improving the cross-linking capacity the addition of compounds incorporating two or more polymerizable groups, so called cross-linkers, may also be considered. Furthermore, known stabilizing agents such as e.g. phenol derivatives for stabilization purposes may be added. Furthermore initiators like e.g. Irgacure®are in general part of the reaction mixture.<br>
The appropriate form of the liquid crystalline material will depend upon the application for which it is to be used and may be present as a liquid crystalline mixture, (co)polymer, elastomer, polymer gel or polymer network. Polymer networks have been found to be of particular use and in a further preferred embodiment of the invention there is a polymer network provided comprising one or more compound(s) of formula (I). The polymer network comprises at least two components, at least one of which is an additive component of formula (I).<br>
The polymer network may be prepared by polymerization of a mesogenic mixture comprising:<br>
i)	one or more chiral and/or achiral mesogenic polymerizable compounds<br>
ii)	one or more chiral and/or achiral additive components of formula (I)<br>
iii)	an initiator<br>
iv)	optionally one or more chiral additives<br>
v)	optionally one or more dyes<br>
vi)	optionally one or more cross-linkers<br>
vii)	optionally one or more stabilizers<br>
viii)	optionally one or more plasticizers<br>
39<br><br>
The chiral or achiral mesogenic polymerizable compounds may be selected from known mesogenic materials such as from those referred to above and also from other mesogenic materials. Preferably the chiral or achiral polymerizable compounds include the nematic phase in their thermotropic sequence.<br>
The polymer network may optionally comprise further components. As outlined above this may include further polymerizable compounds, stabilizers and dyes. The further polymerizable compounds may be plasticizers having at least one polymerizable functional group, or cross-linkers having at least one polymerizable functional group, especially diacrylate groups.<br>
Any suitable stabilizer that prevents undesired spontaneous polymerisation, for example during storage of the mixture, may be used in the liquid crystalline mixture according to the invention. A broad range of these compounds is commercially available. Typical examples include 4-ethoxyphenol or 2,6-di-ferf-butyl-4-methylphenol (BHT).<br>
If color filters are required, dyes may be added to the mixture. In a preferred embodiment of the invention the liquid crystalline polymer mixture contains no dye.<br>
The chiral or achiral polymerizable, cross-linkable mesogenic compound(s) may be present in an amount of 0.01 to 99% by weight of the liquid crystalline polymer mixture, preferably 50 to 95% by weight.<br>
The additive component(s) of formula (I) may be present in an amount of 0.1 to 50% by weight of the liquid crystalline polymer mixture, preferably in an amount of 1 to 30% by weight, even more preferably in an amount of 1 to 10 % by weight.<br>
The initiator is preferably a photo-initiator and may be a radical or cationic initiator that is present in an amount of 0.1 to 5% by weight of the liquid crystalline polymer mixture, preferably in an amount of 0.2 to 2% by weight.<br>
In case the cross-linkable liquid crystalline compound mixture further comprises a stabilizer, the latter is generally present in an amount of 0.01 to 5% by weight of the liquid crystalline mixture, preferably in an amount of 0.1 to 1% by weight.<br>
40<br><br>
These cross-linkable, polymerizabie liquid crystalline mixtures may be formed into liquid crystalline polymer (LCP) films and a further aspect of the invention provides an LCP film comprising a compound of formula (I). LCP films may be readily prepared by UV polymerization of a liquid crystalline polymer mixture according to the invention: a film comprising the liquid crystalline mixture according to the invention is formed on a substrate and polymerized using UV light to give a cross-linked liquid crystalline polymer (LCP) film. The film is resistant when exposed to light and temperature and can be used in the manufacture of devices such as waveguides, optical gratings, filters, retarders, polarizers, piezoelectric cells or thin films exhibiting non-linear optical properties.<br>
Different methods can be used for the formation of the desired LCP networks, starting from the polymerizabie liquid crystalline mixtures as described above. Transparent substrates such as glass or plastic substrates, coated with indium tin oxide (ITO) may be used. For the preparation of LCP films, it is particularly important to avoid the formation of defects or inhomogenities. Thus preferred substrates include glass or plastic, especially those including a layer of rubbed polyimide or polyamide or a layer of photo-oriented photopolymers (LPP). Said layers are used to facilitate uniform orientation of the liquid crystalline mixture. Uniform orientation can also be achieved by forming the polymerizabie liquid crystalline mixture into a thin film using standard coating methods known per se on the aforementioned substrates and shearing the obtained film over a small distance or over the coated distance until a homogeneous orientation is obtained; or by capillary filling the polymerizabie liquid crystalline mixture between two of said substrates; prior to curing, for example by UV light, preferably in the presence of a photo-initiator, such as Irgacure®.<br>
A further aspect of the invention provides an unstructured or structured optical or electro-optical component and multi-layer systems comprising a polymer network or a liquid crystalline polymer film comprising a compound of formula (I). The optical or electro-optical component may be a waveguide, an optical grating, a filter, a retarder, a piezoelectric cell or a non-linear optical cell or film.<br>
In the following the invention will now be described with reference to Examples 1 to 11. Variations of these examples failing within the scope of the invention will be apparent to a person skilled in the art.<br>

Advantages of using compounds of formula l\) for improving the manufacture of LCP-films are demonstrated in the following examples by comparison.<br>
For the orientation of the LCP layers photo-orientated (LPP) layers were used. These photo-oriented layers were obtained through application of the linearly photo-polarizable aligning (LPP) technique (contact-free alignment of LPP-mixtures suitable for linear photo-polymerization, using polarized light).<br>
The LPP layers used herein below were produced according to the following procedure:<br>
The cleaned glass substrate was coated with a 2-3 % cyclpentanone solution of Staralign 2110 (LPP mixture commercially available from Vantico). The solution was spin-coated at a speed of 2000 rpm which resulted in a thin polymer layer of about 40 nm. Then the layer was annealed at 180 °C for 10 minutes followed by irradiation with linear polarized UVB light (approx. 1 J/cm2).<br>
EXAMPLE 9<br>
Demonstrating acceleration of orientation due to additive components according to the invention<br>
a)     The following polymerizable cholesteric mixture(l) was formulated:<br>
-	4 % Chiral compound LC756 (commercially available from BASF)<br>
-	95 % LCP compound LC242 (commercially available from BASF)<br>
-1 % Irgacure 184 (Photoinitiator, commercially available from Ciba)<br>
The aforementioned host mixture did not contain an additive compound according to the invention and thus was used as comparative example.<br>
The mixture was dissolved in Anisole (Merck) (50 % by weight) and spin-coated on a glass substrate provided with above quoted LPP-orientation layer. Spin-<br>
58<br><br>
coating  parameters: 700 UpM/1 Minute resulting in a 4.5 urn thick layer. Then the sample was heated to 85 °C and the remaining solvent was allowed to evaporate.<br>
This treatment created a polydomain film with a dense net of disclination lines leading to a strongly scattering texture. These disclination lines were reduced during annealing and a yellow color appeared. But the layer remained strongly scattering even after 15 minutes of annealing.<br>
b)	In the next experiment the 95 % LC242-component of mixture(l) was replaced by<br>
85 % LC242 pjus 10 % of Additive No. 2, (R,S)-2-[(4'-cyano-1,1'-biphenyl-4-<br>
yl)oxy] propyl 2- methylacrylate (Example 2), while keeping the concentrations of<br>
the other compounds constant. Then the treatment as described above under<br>

EXAMPLE 10<br>
Demonstrating improvement of film Quality due to additive components according to the invention<br>
a)     The following polymerizable cholesteric mixture(ll) was formulated:<br>
-13 % 1,2-Bis-{2,5-bis-[4-(6-acryloyloxyhexyloxy)benzoyloxy]benzoic acid}-diisopropyl L-tartarylester (described in WO 01/47862, Example 1)<br>
- 86 % 10-[(4'-cyano-1,1'-biphenyl-4-yl)oxy]decyl 2,5-bis-[4-(6-acryloyloxyhexyloxy) benzoyloxy]benzoate (described in WO 00/55110, method of manufacture similar to Example 1)<br>
-1% irgacure 184 (Photoinitiator, commercially available from Ciba)<br>
The aforementioned host mixture did not contain an additive compound according to the invention and thus was used as comparative example.<br>
The mixture was dissolved in Anisole (Merck) (42 % by weight) and spin-coated on a glass substrate provided with above quoted LPP-orientation layer. Spin-coating  parameters: 700 rpm for 1 minute, resulting in a 4.0 urn thick layer. Then the sample was heated to 82 °C and the remaining solvent was allowed to evaporate.<br>
This treatment created a polydomain film with a dense net of disclination lines leading to a strongly scattering texture. These disclination lines were reduced during annealing, however, they did not disappear completely even after about<br>
61<br><br>
15 minutes. The film showed a cholesteric long pitch reflection band around 850 nm.<br>
In the next experiment the 86 % of LCP compound 10-[(4'-cyano-1,1'-biphenyl-4-yl)oxy]decyl 2,5-bis-[4-(6-acryloyloxyhexyloxy) benzoyloxy]benzoate of mixture (II) was replaced by 76 % of LCP compound 10-[(4'-cyano-1,1'-biphenyi-4-yl)oxy]decyl 2,5-bis-[4-(6-acry!oyloxyhexyloxy) benzoyloxy]benzoate plus 10 % of Additive No. 2, (R,S)-2-[(4'-cyano-1.1'-biphenyl-4-yl)oxy] propyl 2-methylacrylate (Example 2), while keeping the concentrations of the other compounds constant. Then the treatment as described above under 10a) was repeated.<br>
In this case a weakly scattering transparent film was generated within 3 minutes exhibiting a red reflection band around 650 nm.<br>
The following polymerizable cholesteric mixture(lll) was formulated:<br>
-11 % 1,2-Bis-{2,5-bis-[4-(6-acryloyloxyhexyloxy)benzoyloxy]benzoic acid}-diisopropyl L-tartarylester (described in WO 01/47862, Example 1)<br>
-	62 % 10-[(4'-cyano-1,1'-biphenyl-4-yl)oxy]decyl<br>
2,5-bis-[4-(6-acryloyloxyhexyloxy)benzoyloxy]benzoate<br>
(described in WO 00/55110, method of manufacture similar to Example 1)<br>
-	26 % LCP compound LC242 (commercially available from BASF)<br>
-1 % Irgacure 184 (Photoinitiator, commercially available from Ciba)<br>
The aforementioned host mixture did not contain an additive compound according to the invention and thus was used as comparative example.<br>
The mixture was dissolved in Anisole (Merck) (50 % by weight) and spin-coated on a glass substrate provided with above quoted LPP-orientation layer. Spin-coating parameters: 700 rpm for 1 minute, resulting in a 4.0 nm thick layer. Then the sample was heated to 82 °C and the remaining solvent was allowed to evaporate.<br>
This treatment created a polydomain film with a dense net of disclination lines leading to a strongly scattering texture. These disclination lines were reduced<br>
62<br><br>
during annealing, however, they did not disappear completely even after about 15 minutes. A long pitch reflection band around 760 nm was generated.<br>
d)     In the next experiment the 62 % of LCP compound 10-[(4'-cyano-1,1'-biphenyl-4-yl)oxy]decyl 2,5-bis-[4-(6-acryloyloxyhexyloxy) benzoyloxy]benzoate was replaced by 52 % of LCP compound 10-[(4'-cyano-1,1'-biphenyl-4-yl)oxy]decyl 2,5-bis-[4-(6-acryloyloxyhexyloxy) benzoyloxyjbenzoate plus 10 % of Additive No. 2, (R,S)-2-[(4'-cyano-1,1'-biphenyl-4-y!)oxy]propyl 2-methylacrylate (Example 2), while keeping the concentrations of the other compounds constant. Then the treatment as described under 10c) was repeated.<br>
In this case a weakly scattering transparent film was generated within 3 minutes with a red reflection band around 650 nm.<br>
EXAMPLE 11<br>
Demonstrating improvement of compatibility of the components due to additive components according to the invention<br>
a)     The following polymerizable cholesteric mixture(IV) was formulated:<br>
-10 % 1,2-Bis-{2,5-bis-[4-(6-acryloyloxyhexyloxy)benzoyloxy]benzoicacid}-<br>
diisopropyl L-tartarylester (described in WO 01/47862, Example 1) - 89 % LCP compound LC242 (commercially available from BASF) -1 % Irgacure 184 (Photoinitiator, commercially available from Ciba)<br>
The aforementioned host mixture did not contain an additive compound according to the invention and thus was used as comparative example.<br>
The mixture was dissolved in Anisole (Merck) (50 % by weight) and spin-coated on a glass substrate provided with above quoted LPP-orientation layer. Spin-coating  parameters: 700 rpm for 1 minute, resulting in a 4.5 |xm thick layer.<br>
63<br><br>
Then the sample was heated to 85 °C and the remaining solvent was allowed to evaporate.<br>
This treatment created a polydomain film with a dense net of disclination lines leading to a strongly scattering texture. These disclination lines vanished slowly during annealing and disappeared nearly completely after about 5 minutes. The procedure resulted in a weakly scattering film exhibiting a green reflection band. Then the sample was cooled down to room temperature; thereafter it was confirmed that the film remained homogeneously oriented. The sample was then irradiated with UV-light (5 mW around 360 nm for 5 minutes in N2 atmosphere) to fix the orientation by cross-linking. After this treatment the sample scattered light due to phase separation which was induced by polymerization.<br>
b)     In the next experiment the 89 % LC242-component of mixture(IV) was replaced by 79 % LC242 ejus 10 % of Additive No. 2. (RlS)-2-[(4,-cyano-1,1,-biphenyl-4-yl)oxy] propyl 2-methyiacrylate (Example 2), while keeping the concentrations of the other compounds constant. Then the treatment as described above under 11 a) was repeated.<br>
In this case no sign of phase separation was observed. This clearly shows that the addition of Additive No. 2 improves the compatibility of different components, in the case of the example the compatibility of chiral compound 1,2-Bis-{2,5-bis-[4-(6-acryloyloxyhexyloxy)benzoyloxy]benzoic acid}- diisopropyl L-tartarylester and LCP compound LC242.<br>
