BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
This invention is directed to the inhibition of cell proliferation and/or cell matrix production and/or ceil movement (chemotaxis) and/or T cell activation and proliferation using of quinoline/quinoxaline compounds which are useful protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors (Takes).<br>
Cellular signaling is mediated through a system of interactions which include cell-cell contact or cell-matrix contact or extracellular receptor-substrate contact. The extracellular signal is often communicated to other parts of the cell via a tyrosine kinase mediated phosphorylation event which affects substrate proteins downstream of the cell membrane bound signaling complex. A specific set of receptor-enzymes such as the insulin receptor, epidermal grouch factor receptor (EGF-R) or platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGF-R) are examples of tyrosine kinase enzymes which are involved in cellular signaling. Autophosphorylation of the enzyme is required for efficient enzyme-mediated phosphorylation of substrate proteins containing tyrosine residues. These substrates are known to be responsible for a variety of cellular Qvenis including cellular proliferation, cellular matrix production, cellular migration and apoptosis to name a few.<br>
It is understood that a large number of disease states are caused by either uncontrolled reproduction of cells or overproduction of matrix or poorly regulated programmed cell death (apoptosis). These disease states involve a variety of cell types and include disorders such as leukemia, cancer, glioblastoma, psoriasis, inflammatory diseases, bone diseases, fibrotic diseases, atherosclerosis and rest enosis occurring subsequent to angioplasty of the coronary, femoral or kidney arteries or, fibroproliferative disease such as in arthritis, fibrosis of the lung, kidney and liver. In addition, deregulated cellular proliferate conditions follow from coronary bypass The inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity is believed to have utility in the control of uncontrolled reproduction of cells or overproduction of matrix or poorly regulated programmed cell death (apoptosis).<br>
It is also known that certain tyrosine kinase inhibitors can interact with more than one type of tyrosine kinase enzyme. Several tyrosine kinase enzymes are critical for the normal function of the body. For instance, it would be undesirable to inhibit insulin action in most normal circumstances. Therefore, compounds which inhibit PDGF-R tyrosine kinase activity at concentrations less than the concentrations effective in inhibiting the insulin receptor kinase could provide valuable agents for the<br><br>
selective treatment of diseases characterized by cell proliferation and/or cell matrix prediction and/or cell movement (chemotaxis) such as rest enosis.<br>
This invention relates to the modulation and/or inhibition of cell signaling, cell proliferation, extracellular matrix production, chemotaxis, the control of abnormal cell growth and cell inflammatory' response. More specifically, this invention relates to the use of substituted quinoxaline compounds which exhibit selective inhibition of differentiation, proliferation or mediator release by effectively inhibiting platelet-derived growth factor-receptor (PDGF-R) tyrosine kinase activity and/or Lck tyrosine kinase activity.<br>
2.	Reported Developments<br>
A number of literature reports describe tyrosine kinase inhibitors which are selective for t&gt;T0sine kinase receptor enzymes such as EGF-R or PDGF-R or non-receptor cytosolic tyrosine kinase enzymes such as v-abl, p56lck or c-src. Recent reviews by Spada and Myers {Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents 1995, 5(8). 805) and Bridges {Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents 1993. 5(12), 1245) summarize the literature for tyrosine kinase inhibitors and EGF-R selective inhibitors respectively. Additionally Law and Lydon have summarized the anticancer potential of r\Tosine kinase inhibitors {Emerging Drugs: The Prospect For Improved Medicines 1996, 241-260).<br>
Known inhibitors of PDGF-R tyrosine kinase activity includes quinoline-based inhibitors reported by Maguire et al. (./ Med. Chem. 1994, i7,,2129). And by Dolle et al. (./ Med. Chem. 1994, 372627) A class of phenylamino-pyrimidine-based inhibitors was recently reported by Traxler et al. in EP 564409 and by Zimmerman, J.: and Traxler, P. et al. {Biorg. &amp; Med. Chem. Lett. 1996, 6(11), 1221-1226) and by Buchdunger, E. et aL {Proc. Nat. Acad. ScL 1995, 92. 2558). Despite the progress in the field there are no agents from these classes of compounds that have been approved for use in humans for treating proliferative disease.<br>
The correlation between the multifactorial disease of restenosis with PDGF and PDGF-R is well-documented throughout the scientific literature. However, recent developments into the understanding of fibrotic diseases of the lung (Antoniades, H. N.; et al: 7. Clin. Invest.  1990, 86. 1055), kidney and liver (Peterson, T. C. Hepatolog}\ 1993, 77, 486) have also implicated PDGF and PDGF-R as playing a role. For instance glomerulonephritis is a major cause of renal failure and PDGF has been identified to be a potent mitogen for mesangial cells in vitro as demonstrated by Shultz et a!. {Ant J. Physiol. 1988, 255, F674) and by Floege, et al. {Clin. Exp. Immun. 199L 86, 334). It has been reported by Thornton, S. C; et al. {Clin. Exp. Im/nnn. 1991. 86, 79) that TNF-alpha and PDGF (obtained from human rheumatoid arthritis patients) are the major cytokines involved in proliferation of synovial cells. Furthermore, specific tumor cell types have been identified (see Silver, B. J., BioFactors, 1992, 3, 217) such as glioblastoma and Kaposi's sarcoma which overexpress either the PDGF protein or receptor thus leading to the uncontrolled growth of cancer cells via an autocrine or paracrine mechanism. Therefore, it is anticipated that a PDGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor would be useful in treating a variety of seemingly unrelated human disease conditions that can be characterized by the involvement of PDGF and or PDGF-R in their etiologv.<br>
The role of various non-receptor tyrosine kinases such as p56'*'* (hereinafter "Lck") in infiammation-related conditions involving T cell activation and proliferation has been reviewed by<br><br>
t<br>
Hanke, et al {Inflamm. Res. 1995, 4 357) and by Bolen and Brugge (Ann. Rev. Immunol., 1997, 75, 371). These inflammatory conditions include allergy, autoimmune disease, rheumatoid arthritis and transplant rejection. Another recent review summarizes various classes of tyrosine kinase inhibitors including compounds having Lck inhibitory activity (Groundwater, et. al Progress in Medicinal Chemistry, 1996, 33, 233). Inhibitors of Lck tyrosine kinase activity include several natural products which are generally non-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as staurosporine, genistein, certain flavones and erbstatin. Damnacanthol was recently reported to be a low nM inhibitor of Lck (Faltynek, et, al. Biochemistry, 1995, 34, 12404). Examples of synthetic Lck inhibitors include: a series of dihydroxy-isoquinoiine inhibitors reported as having low micromolar to submicromolar activity (Burke, et. al J. Med Chem. 1993, 36, 425); and a quinoline derivative found to be much less active having an Lck ICsoof 610 micromolar. Researchers have also disclosed a series of 4-substituted quinazolines that inhibit Lck in the low micromolar to submicromolar range (Myers et al, W095/] 5758 and Myers, et.al Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1997, 7,417). Researchers at Pfizer (Hanke, et. al y. Biol Chem. 1996, 271, 695) have disclosed two specific pyrazolopyrimidine inhibitors known as PPl and PP2 which have low nanomolar potency against Lck and Fyn. (another Src-family kinase). No Lck inhibitory has been reported regarding quinoline or quinoxaline based compounds. Therefore, it is anticipated that a quinoline or quinoxaline based inhibitor of Lck tyrosine kinase activity could be useful in treating a variety of seemingly unrelated human disease conditions that can be characterized by the involvement of Lck tyrosine kinase signaling in their etiology.<br><br><br><br>

The compounds of formula 1 as described herein inhibit inhibition of ceil proliferation and/or cell matrix production and/or cell movement (chemotaxis) via inhibition of PDGF-R tyrosine kinase activity. A large number of disease states are caused by either uncontrolled reproduction of cells or overproduction of matrix or poorly regulated programmed cell death (apoptosis). These disease states involve a variety of cell types and include disorders such as leukemia, cancer, glioblastoma, psoriasis, inflammatory diseases, bone diseases, fibrotic diseases, atherosclerosis and occurring subsequent to angioplasty of the coronar\'. femoral or kidney arteries or, fibroproliferative disease such as in arthritis, fibrosis of the lung, kidney and liver. In particular, PEXjF and PDGF-R have, been reported to be implicated in specific types of cancers and tumors such as brain cancer, ovarian cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer lung cancer. Kaposi's sarcoma and malignant melanoma. In addition, deregulated<br><br>
cellular proliferative conditions follow from coronary bypass surgery. The inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity is believed to have utility in the control of uncontrolled reproduction of cells or overproduction of matrix or poorly regulated programmed cell death (apoptosis).<br>
This invention relates to the modulation and/or inhibition of cell signaling, cell proliferation and/or cell matrix production and/or cell movement (chemotaxis), the control of abnormal cell growth and cell inflammatory response. More specifically, this invention relates to the use of substituted quinoline and quinoxaline compounds which exhibit selective inhibition of differentiation, proliferation, matrix production, chemotaxis or mediator release by effectively inhibiting platelet-derived gro\\4h factor-receptor (PDGF-R) tyrosine kinase activity.<br>
Initiation of autophosphoiylation, i.e., phosphorylation of the growth factor receptor itself, and of the phosphorylation of a host of intracellular substrates are some of the biochemical events which are involved in cell signaling, cell proliferation, matrix production, chemotaxis and mediator release.<br>
By effectively inhibiting Lck tyrosine kinase activity, the compounds of this invention are also useful in the treatment of resistance to transplantation and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid aithritis, multiple sclerosis and systemic lupus eiythematosus, in transplant rejection, in graft vs. host disease, in hyperprolifcrative disorders such as tumours and psoriasis, and in diseases in which cells receive pro-inflammatory signals such as asthma, inflammatory' bowel disease and pancreatitis.  In the treatment of resistance to transplantation, a compound of this invention may be used either prophylacticaliy or in response to an adverse reaction by the human subject to a transplanted organ or tissue. When used prophylacticaliy, a compound of this invention is administered to the patient or to the tissue or organ to be transplanted in advance of the transplantation operation. Prophylactic treatment may also include administration of the medication after the transplantation operation but before any signs of adverse reaction to transplantation are observed. When administered in response to an adverse reaction, a compound of this invention is administered directly to the patient in order to treat resistance to transplantation after outward signs of the resistance have been manifested.<br>

The compositions may be presented in the form of tablets, piils, granules, powders, aqueous solutions or suspensions, injectable solutions, elixirs or syrups, and may contain one or more agents chosen from the group comprising sweeteners such as sucrose, lactose, fructose, saccharin or Nutrasweet*, flavorings such as peppermint oil, oil of wintergreen, or cherry or orange flavorings, colorings, or stabilizers such as methyl--or propylparaben in order to obtain phannaceutically acceptable preparations.<br>
The choice of vehicle and the content of active substance in the vehicle are generally determined in accordance with the solubility and chemical properties of the product, the particular mode of administration and the provisions to be observed in pharmaceutical practice. For example, excipients such as lactose, sodium citrate, calcium carbonate, dicalcium phosphate and disintegrating agents such as starch, alginic acids and certain complex silica gels combined with lubricants such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate and talc may be used for preparing tablets, troches, pills, capsules and the like. To prepare a capsule, it is advantageous to use lactose and liquid carrier, such as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. Various other materials may be present as coatings or to otherwise modify the physical form of the dosage unit. For instance, tablets, pills, or capsules may be coated with shellac, sugar or both. When aqueous suspensions are used they may contain emulsifying agents or agents which facilitate suspension. Diluents such as sucrose, ethanoL polyols such as polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol and glycerol, and chloroform or mixtures thereof may also be used. In addition, the active compound may be incorporated into sustained-release preparations and formulations.<br>
For oral administration, the active compound may be administered, for example, with an inert diluent or with an assimilable edible carrier, or it may be enclosed in hard or soft shell gelatin capsules, or it may be compressed into tablets, or it may be incorporated directly with the food of the diet, or may be incorporated with e.xcipient and used in the form of ingestible tablets, buccal tablets, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, and the like.<br>
For parenteral administration, emulsions, suspensions or solutions of the compounds according to the invention in vegetable oil, for example sesame oil, groundnut oil or olive oil, or aqueous-organic solutions such as water and propylene glycol, injectable organic esters such as ethyl oieate, as well as sterile aqueous solutions of the pharmaceutically acceptable salts, are used. The injectable forms must<br><br>
be fluid to the extent that it can be easily syringed, and proper fluidity can be maintained, for example. by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by use of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin. The solutions of the salts of the products according to the invention are especially useful for administration by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. Solutions of the active compound as a free base or pharmacologically acceptable salt can be prepared in water suitably mixed with a surfactant such as hydroxypropyl-cellulose.  Dispersion can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and mixtures thereof and in oils. The aqueous solutions, also comprising solutions of the salts in pure distilled water, may be used for intravenous administration with the proviso that their pH is suitably adjusted, that they are judiciously buffered and rendered isotonic with a sufficient quantity of glucose or sodium chloride and that they are sterilized by heating, iiTadiation, microfiltration, and/or by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens. chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal. and the like.<br>
Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the active compound in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various of the other ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the various sterilized active ingredient into a sterile vehicle which contains the basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above.  In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and the freeze drying technique which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from previously sterile-filtered solution thereof.<br>
Topical administration, gels (water or alcohol based), creams or ointments containing compounds of the invention may be used. Compounds of the invention may be also incorporated in a gel or matrix base for application in a patch, which would allow a controlled release of compound through transdermal barrier.<br>
For administration by inhalation, compounds of the invention may be dissolved or suspended in a suitable carrier for use in a nebulizer or a suspension or solution aerosol, or may be absorbed or adsorbed onto a suitable solid carrier for use in a dry powder inhaler.<br>
Solid compositions for rectal administration include suppositories foiTOulated in accordance with known methods and containing at least one compound of formula I.<br>
Compositions according to the invention may also be formulated in a manner which resists rapid clearance from the vascular (arterial or venous) wall by convection and/or diffusion, thereby increasing the residence time of the viral particles at the desired site of action. A periadventitial depot comprising a compound according to the invention may be used for sustained release. One such useful depot for administering a compound according to the invention may be a copolymer matrix, such as ethylene-vinyl acetate, or a polyvinyl alcohol gel surrounded by a Silastic shell. Alternatively, a compound according to the invention may be delivered locally from a silicone polymer implanted in the adventitia.<br>
An alternative approach for minimizing washout of a compound according to the invention during percutaneous, transvascular delivery comprises the use of nondiffusible, drug-eluting microparticles. The microparticles may be comprised of a variety of synthetic polymers, such as<br><br>
polylactide for example, or natural substances, including proteins or polysaccharides. Such microparticles enable strategic manipulation of variables including total dose of drug and kinetics of its release. Microparticles can be injected efficiently into the arterial or venous wall through a porous balloon catheter or a balloon over stent, and are retained in the vascular wall and the periadventitial tissue for at least about two weeks. Formulations and methodologies for local, intravascular site-specific delivery of therapeutic agents are discussed in Reissen et al. (J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 1994; 23: 1234-1244), the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
A composition according to the invention may also comprise a hydrogel which is prepared from any biocompatible or non-cytotoxic (homo or hetero) polymer, such as a hydrophilic polyacrylic acid polymer that can act as a drug absorbing sponge. Such polymers have been described, for example, in application WO93/08845, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. Certain of them, such as, in particular, those obtained from ethylene and/or propylene oxide are commercially available.<br>
In the use of compounds according to the invention for treating pathologies which are linked to hyperproliferative disorders, the compounds according to the invention can be administered in different ways. For the treatment of restenosis, the compounds of the invention are administered directly to the blood vessel wall by means of an angioplasty balloon which is coated with a hydrophilic film (for example a hydrogel) which is saturated with the compound, or by means of any other catheter containing an infusion chamber for the compound, which can thus be applied in a precise manner to the site to be treated and allow the compound to be liberated locally and efficiently at the location of the cells to be treated. This method of administration advantageously makes it possible for the compound to contact quickly the cells in need of treatment.<br>
The treatment method of the invention preferably consists in introducing a compound according to the invention at the site to be treated. For example, a hydrogel containing composition can be deposited directly onto the surface of the tissue to be treated, for example during a surgical intervention. Advantageously, the hydrogel is introduced at the desired intravascular site by coating a catheter, for example a balloon catheter, and delivery to the vascular wall, preferably at the time of angioplasty. In a particularly advantageous manner, the saturated hydrogel is introduced at the site to be treated by means of a balloon catheter. The balloon may be chaperoned by a protective sheath as the catheter is advanced toward the target vessel, in order to minimize drug washoff after the catheter is introduced into the bloodstream.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention provides for a compound according to the invention to be administered by means of perfusion balloons. These perfusion balloons, which make it'possible to maintain a blood flow and thus to decrease the risks of ischaemia of the myocardium, on inflation of the balloon, also enable the compound to be delivered locally at normal pressure for a relatively long time, more than twenty minutes, which may be necessary for its optimal action. Alternatively, a channelled balloon catheter ("channelled balloon angioplasty catheter", Mansfield Medical, Boston Scientific Corp., Watertown, MA) may be used. The latter consists of a conventional balloon covered with a layer of 24 perforated channels which are perfused via an independent lumen through an additional infusion orifice. Various types of balloon catheters, such as double balloon, porous balloon, microporous balloon, channel<br><br>
balloon, balloon over stent and hydrogel catheter, all of which may be used to practice the invention, are disclosed in Reissen et al. (1994) , the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
The use of a perfusion balloon catheter is especially advantageous, as it has the advantages of both keeping the balloon inflated for a longer period of time by retaining the properties of facilitated sliding and of site-specificity of the hydrogel, are gained simultaneously.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound according to the invention and poloxamer, such as Poloxamer 407 is a non-toxic, biocompatible polyol, commercially available (BASF, Parsippany, NJ).<br>
A poloxamer impregnated with a compound according to the invention may be deposited directly on the surface of the tissue to be treated, for example during a surgical intervention. Poloxamer possesses essentially the same advantages as hydrogel while having a lower viscosity.<br>
The use of a channel balloon catheter with a poloxamer impregnated with a compound according to the invention is especially advantageous. In this case, the advantages of both keeping the balloon inflated for a longer period of time, while retaining the properties of facilitated sliding, and of site-specificity of the poloxamer, are gained simultaneously.<br>
The percentage of active ingredient in the compositions of the invention may be varied, it being necessary that it should constitute a proportion such that a suitable dosage shall be obtained. Obviously, several unit dosage forms may be administered at about the same time. A dose employed may be determined by a physician or qualified medical professional, and depends upon the desired therapeutic effect, the route of administration and the duration of the treatment, and the condition of the patient. In the adult, the doses are generally from about 0.001 to about 50, preferably about 0.001 to about 5, mg/kg body weight per day by inhalation, from about 0.01 to about 100, preferably 0.1 to 70, more especially 0.5 to 10, mg/kg body weight per day by oral administration, and from about 0.001 to about 10, preferably 0.01 to 10, mg/kg body weight per day by intravenous administration. In each particular case, the doses are determined in accordance with the factors distinctive to the patient to be treated, such as age, weight, general state of health and other characteristics which can influence the efficacy of the compound according to the invention.<br>
The compounds/compositions according to the invention may be administered as frequently as necessary in order to obtain the desired therapeutic effect. Some patients may respond rapidly to a higher or lower dose and may find much weaker maintenance doses adequate. For other patients, it may be necessary to have long-term treatments at the rate of 1 to 4 doses per day, in accordance with the physiological requirements of each particular patient. Generally, the active product may be administered orally 1 to 4 times per day. Of course, for other patients, it will be neccssar&gt;' to prescribe not more than one or two doses per day.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may also be formulated for use in conjunction with other therapeutic agents such as agents or in connection with the application of therapeutic techniques to address pharmacological conditions which may be ameliorated through the application of a compound of formula 1. such as in the following:<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be used in the treatment of restenosis post angioplasty using any device such as balloon, ablation or laser techniques. The compounds of the present invention may be used in the treatment of restenosis following stent placement in the vasculature either<br><br>
as !) primary treatment for vascular blockage, or 2) in the instance where angioplasty using any device fails to give a patent artery. The compounds of the present invention may be used either orally, by parenteral administration or the compound could be applied topically through the intervention of a specific device or as a properly formulated coating on a stent device.<br>
For topical application as a coating on a stent device, the coated stent device is prepared by applying polymeric materia! in which the compound of the invention is incorporated to at least one surface of the stent device.<br>
Polymeric materials suitable for incorporating the compound of the invention include polymers having relatively low processing temperatures such as polycaprolactone, poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) or poly(vinyl acetate or silicone gum rubber and polymers having similar relatively low processing temperatures. Other suitable polymers include non-degradable polymers capable of carrying and delivering therapeutic drugs such as latexes, urethanes. polysiloxanes, styrene-ethylene/burylene-styrene block copolymers (SEBS) and biodegradable, bioabsorbable polymers capable of carrying and delivering therapeutic drugs, such as poly-DL-lactic acid (DL-PLA), and poly-L-lactic acid (L-PLA), polyorthoesters. polyiminocarbonates, aliphatic polycarbonates, and polypiiosphazenes.<br>
A porosigen may also be incoi-porated in the drug loaded polymer by adding the porosigen to the polymer along with the therapeutic drug to form a porous, drug loaded polymeric membrane. "Porosigen" means as any moiety, such as microgranules of sodium chloride, lactose, or sodium heparin, for example, which will dissolve or otherwise be degraded when immersed in body fluids to leave behind a porous network in the polymeric material. The pores left by such porosignes can typically be a large as 10 microns. The pores formed by porosignes such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), polyethylene oxide/polypropylene oxide (PEO/PPO) copolymers, for example, can also be smaller than one micron. although other similar materials which form phase separations from the continuous drug loaded polymeric matrix and can later be leached out by body fluids can also be suitable for foi-ming pores smaller than one micron. Tlie polymeric material can be applied to the stent while the therapeutic drug and porosigen material are contained within the polymeric material, to allow the porosigen to be dissolved or degraded by body fluids when the stent is placed in a blood vessel, or alternatively, the porosigen can be dissolved and removed from the polymeric material to form pores in the polymeric material prior to placement of the polymeric material combined with the stent within a blood vessel.<br>
If desired, a rate-
In another aspect, the coating on the stent device can be formed by applying the compound of the invention to at least one surface of the stent device to form a bioactive layer and then applying one or<br><br>
more coats of porous polymeric material over the bioactive layer, such that the porous polymeric material has a thickness adequate to provide a controlled release of the compound.<br>
The porous polymeric material is composed of a polyamide, paiylene or a parylene derivative which is applied to the stent device by catalyst-free vapor desposition. "Parylene" refers to a polymer based on p-xylyiene and made by vapor phase polymerization as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,824,049, incorporated herein by reference.<br>

More preferably, the monomer is preferably an addition photopolymerizable polyethylenically unsaturated acrylic or methacrylic acid ester containing two or more acrylate or methacrylate groups per molecule or mixtures thereof. Representative examples of such multifuntional acrylates are ethylene glycol diacr&gt;'iate. ethylene glycol dinielhacrylate, trimethylopropane triacrylate, trimethylopropane trimethacrylate, pentaerythritol tetraacrylate or pentaerythritol tetramethacrylate, 1,6-hexanediol dimethacrylate, and diethyleneglycol dimethacrylate.<br>
Also useful in some special instances are monoacrylates such as n-butyl-acrylate, n-butyl methacrylate, 2-ethylhexyl acrylate. lauryi-acrylate, and 2-hydroxy-propyl acrylate. Small quantities of amides of (meth)acrylic acid such as N-methylol methacrylamide butyl ether are also suitable, N-vinyl compounds such as N-vinyl pyrrolidone, vinyl esters of aliphatic monocarboxyiic acids such as vinyl oleate. vinyl ethers of diois such as butanediol-l,4-divinyl ether and allyl ether and allyl ester are also suitable. Also included are other monomers such as the reaction products of di- or polyepoxides such as butanediol-1, 4-digIycidyl ether or bisphenol A diglycidyl ether with (meth)acrylic acid. The characteristics of the photopolymerizable liquid dispersing medium can be modified for the specific purpose by a suitable selection of monomers or mixtures thereof<br>
Other useful polymer systems include a polymer that is biocompatible and minimizes irritation to the vessel wall when the stent is implanted. The polymer may be either a biostable or a bioabsorbable polymer depending on the desired rate of release or the desired degree of polymer stability. Bioabsorbable polymers that could be used include poly(L-lactic acid), polycaprolactone. poly(lactide-co-glycolide), poly(hydroxybutyrate), poly (hydroxybutyrate-co-valerate), polydioxanone, polyorthoester, polyanhydride. poly(glycolic acid), poly(D, L-lactic acid), poly(glycolic acid-cotrimethyiene carbonate), polyphosphoester, polyphosphoester urethane, poly(amino acids), cyanoacrylates, poly(trimethylene carbonate), poly (iminocarbonate). copoly(ether-esters) (e.g., PEO/PLA), polyalkylene oxlates, polyphoosphazenes and biomolecules such as fibrin, fibrinogen, cellulose, starch, collagen and hyaluronic acid. Also, biostable polymers with a relatively low chronic tissue response such as polyurethanes. silicones, and polyesters could be used and other polymers could<br><br>
also be used if they can be dissolved and cured or polymerized on the stent such as poiyolefins, polyisobutylene and ethyiene-alphaolefine copolymers; acrylic polymers and copolymers, vinyl halide polymers and copolymers, such as polyvinyl chloride; polyvinyl ethers, such as polyvinyl methyl ether; polyvinylidene haJides, such as polyvinylidene fluoride and polyvinylidene chloride: polyacryionitrile, polyvinyl ketones, polyvinyl aromatics, such as polyst&gt;Tene, polyvinyl esters, such as pol}"vinyl acetate; copolymers of vinyl monomers with each other and olefins, such as ethylene-methyl methacrylate copolymers, acrylonitril-styrene copolyers.

In addition to plasma deposition and vapor phase deposition, other techniques for applying the various coatings on the stent surfaces may be employed. For example, a polymer solution may be applied to the stent and the solvent allowed to evaporate, thereby leaving on the stent surface a coating of the polymer and the therapeutic substance. Typically, the solution can be applied to the stent by either spraying the solution onto the stent or immersing the stent in the solution.<br>

p56'* Tyrosine kinase inhibition activity is determined according to a procedure disclosed in United States Patent No. 5,714,493, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In the alternative, the tyrosine kinase inhibition activity is determined according to the following method. A substrate (tyrosine-containing substrate, Biot-(p Ala)vLys-Val-Glu-Lys-lle-Gly-Glu-Gly-Thr-Tyr-Glu-Val-Val-Tyr-Lys-1H2) recognized by P56'*''. 1 ^M) is first phosphorylated in presence or absence of a given concentration of the test compound, by a given amount of enzyme (enzyme is produced by expression of P56'^ gene in a yeast construct) purified from a cloned yeast (purification of the enzyme is done by following classical methods) in the presence of ATP (lOfiM) MgC12( 2.5mM), MnCI2 (2.5mM), NaCl (25mM), DTT (0.4mM) in Hepes 50mM, pH 7.5, over 10 min at ambient temperature. The total reaction volume is 50pl, and the reactions are performed in a black 96-weII fluoroplate. The reaction is stopped by addition of 150|il of stopping buffer (I OOmM Hepes pH7.5, KF 400mM, EDTA 133 mM, BSA Ig/I.) containing a selected anti tyrosine antiboxly labelled with the Europium cryptate (PY20-K) at O.Sfig/ml and allophycocyanine-labelled streptavidin (XL665) al 4pg/ml The labelling of Streptavidin and anti-tyrosine antibodies were perfonned by Cis-Bio International<br><br>
(France). The mixture is counted using a Packard Discover&gt;' counter which is able to measure time-resolved homogeneous fluorescence transfer (excitation at 337 nm, readout at 620 nm and 665 nm). The ratio of the 665 nm signal / 620nm signal is a measure of the phosphorylated tyrosine concentration. The blank is obtained by replacing enzyme by buffer. The specific signal is the difference between the ratio obtained without inhibitor and the ratio with the blank. The percentage of specific signal is calculated. The IC50 is calculated with 10 concentrations of inhibitor in duplicate using Xlfit soft. The reference compound is staurosporine (Sigma) and it exhibits an IC50 of 30± 6 nM (n=20).<br>
