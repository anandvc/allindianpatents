4,6-Dichloro-5-(2-methoxy-phenoxy)-2-(pyridin-4-yl)-pyrimidine (described in EP 0 799 209) can be transformed to the intermediate of general formula (III) - according to scheme 1 - on reaction with an appropriate sulfonamide of general formula (II), wherein R1 is as defined in claim 1, in a suited solvent such as DMSO or DMF at room temperature or at elevated temperature and in the presence of a suited base such as potassium carbonate.<br>
The corresponding sulfonamides can also be applied in above reaction in form of their pre-formed sodium or potassium salts.<br>
Compounds of formula (III) can be further transformed to compounds of general formula (I) by treatment with sodium methylate in a solvent such as methanol.<br><br>
The heterocyclic sulfonamides of general formula (II) are either already known in the literature, prepared in a manner analogous to established procedures and/or can be derived from corresponding mercapto derivatives in analogy to a known reaction sequence comprising oxidation with Cl2  in an acidic aqueous medium, such as diluted aqueous HCl, to yield the corresponding sulfonyl chlorides which can be transformed with liquid ammonia or aqueous ammonium hydroxide to the sulfonamides. The corresponding sodium or potassium salts can be obtained on treatment with sodium or potassium alkoxide in an appropriate solvent such as methanol.<br><br>
Alternatively, compounds of general formula (I) can be prepared - according to scheme 2 - starting from 4-[4,6-dichloro-5-(2-methoxy-phenoxy)-pyrimidin-2-yl]-pyridine-1-oxide (preparation described in EP 0 799 209) in a reaction sequence analogous to that of scheme 1, to give compounds of general formula (V).<br>
Pyridine-N-Oxide reduction of compounds of general formula (V) can be accomplished with a reagent system such as TiCU/Nal in analogy to a method described in Chem. Ber. 123, 647 (1990), or with a trialkylsilyl chloride (for example, f-butyldimethylsilyl chloride) in the presence of a suited base, such as triethylamine, and with acetonitrile as a solvent. Other methods for pyridine-N-Oxide deoxygenation are known per se and comprise, for example, catalytic hydrogenation or reduction with reducing agents such as trivalent phosphorus compounds or metals in acid.<br><br>
The intermediates of above formula (III) and formula (V), wherein R is as defined above 1, preferably wherein R1 is 5-methyl-pyridine-2-yl or 5-isopropyl-pyridine-2-yl, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are new and are also subject of the present invention.<br><br>
The inhibitory activity of the compounds of formula (I) on endothelin receptors can be demonstrated using the test procedures described hereinafter:<br>
I.       Inhibition oFendothelin binding to recombinant human ETa  receptors expressed in Baculovirus-infected insect cells<br>
A cDNA coding for human ETA receptors of human placenta was cloned (M. Adachi, Y.-Y. Yang, Y. Furuichi and C. Miyamoto, BBRC180, 1265-1272) and expressed in the Baculovirus-insect cell system. Baculovirus-infected insect cells from a 23 1 fermenter are centrifuged off (3000 x g, 15 minutes, 4°C) 60 hours after the infection, re-suspended in Tris buffer (5 mM, pH 7.4,1 mM MgCb) and again centrifiiged. After a further re-suspension and centrifugation the cells are suspended in 800 ml of the same buffer and freeze-dried at -120°C. The cells disintegrate when the suspension in this hypotonic buffer mixture is thawed. After a repeated freeze-drying/thawing cycle the suspension is homogenised and centrifuged (25000 xg, 15 minutes, 4°C). After suspension in Tris buffer (75 mM, pH 7.4, 25 mM MgCK, 250 mM sucrose) 1 ml aliquots (protein content about 3.5 mg/ml) are stored at -85°C.<br>
For the binding assay, the freeze-dried membrane preparations are thawed and, after centrifugation at 20°C and 25000 g for 10 minutes, re-suspended in assay buffer (50 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.4, containing 25 mM MnCla, 1 mM EDTA and 0.5% bovine serum albumin). 100 J.ll of this membrane suspension containing 70 [.ig of protein are incubated with 50 i-il of '"^I-endothelin (specific activity 2200 Ci/mMol) in assay buffer (25000 cpm, fmal concentration 20 pM) and 100 |.il of assay buffer containing varying concentrations of test compound. The incubation is carried out at 20°C for 2 hours or at 4°C for 24 hours. The separation of free and membrane-bound radio- ligands is carried out by filtration over a glass fibre filter. The inhibitory activity of compounds of formula (1) determined in this test procedure is given in Table 1 as the IC50, i.e. as the concentration [nM] which is required to inhibit 50% of the specific binding of'125I-endothelin.<br>
Table 1.<br><br><br>
II.      Inhibition of endothelin-induced contractions in isolated rat aorta rings<br>
Rings with a length of 5 mm were cut out from the thorax aorta of adult Wistar-Kyoto rats. The endothelium was removed by lightly rubbing the internal surface. Each ring was immersed at 37°C in 10 ml of Krebs-Henseleit solution in an isolated bath while gassing with 95% O2 and 5% COi. The isometric stretching of the rings was measured. The rings were stretched to a pre-tension of 3 g. After incubation for 10 minutes with the test compound or vehicle cumulative dosages of endothelin-1 were added. The activity of the test compound was ascertained by the observed shift to the right of the dosage-activity curve of endothelin-1 in the presence of different concentrations of antagonist. This shift to the right (or "dose ratio", DR) corresponds to the quotient from the EC50 values of endothelin-1 in the presence and in the absence of antagonist, with the EC50 value denoting the endothelin concentration required for a half-maximum contraction.<br>
The corresponding pA2 value, which is a measure of the activity of the test compound, was calculated using a computer programme according to the following equation from the "dose ratio" DR for each individual dosage-activity curve.<br>
pA2 = log(DR-l)-log(antagonist-concentration)<br>
The EC50 of endothelin in the absence of test compounds is 0.3 nM.<br>
The pA2 values obtained with compounds of formula (I) are given in the following Table 3.<br><br>
III.    Pharmacokinetics of the endothelin receptor antagonists<br>
The pharmacokinetics of the newly synthesised endothelin receptor antagonists were assessed in Wistar rats. The test compounds were dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 5 mg/mL and administered orally by gavage at a dose of 1 mL/kg body weight corresponding to 5 mg/kg body weight. Two rats were administered per test compound. Blood samples were collected from the retro-orbital sinus at 1 and 5 h post dose in one rat, and at 3 and 7 h post dose in the other rat. In addition a terminal 24 h blood sample was collected from both rats by heart puncture. Blood was collected on<br><br>
EDTA-NaF. Plasma was derived by centrifugation at 2000 g at +4°C for 15 min. Plasma samples were assayed for active drug related material with a bioassay, based on the binding competition of tested compounds and '*^I ET-1 on recombinant ETA receptors. Quantitation of plasma samples was by comparison to a calibration curve build up from control rat plasma spiked with known concentrations of the test compounds. Selected findings are summarised in the following table:<br><br><br>

Example 4<br>
a) A suspension of 0.4 g of 5-methyl-thiazole-2-sulfonic acid [6-methoxy-5-(2-methoxy-phenoxy)-2-(l-oxy-pyridin-4-yl)-pyrimidin-4-yl]-amide in acetonitile (5 ml)<br><br>
was treated subsequently with 1.12 ml of triethylamine and 1.243 g of r-butyldimethylsilyl chloride at RT. The mixture was stirred 5 minutes at RT, its pH adjusted to neutral (by addition of trietylamine), and then heated to reflux for 60 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to RT and concentrated on a rotary evaporator. The residue was taken up in CH2CI2, which was subsequently washed with acetic acid and water. The organic layer was dried over MgSOa and the solvent removed in vacuo. The residue was applied to a silica gel column with AcOEt/MeOH: 4/1 as eluent. Combination of the purified fractions and concentration in vacuo gave the desired 5-methyl-thiazole-2-sulfonic acid [6-methoxy-5-(2-metho.Ky-phenoxy)-2-pyridin-4-yl-pyrimidin-4-yl]-amide as a beige crystalline solid. ISN mass spectrum, m/e 484.2 (M-1 calculated for C21H19N5O5S1: 484).<br>
Preparation of the starting material:<br>
b) 2.23 g of 5-methylene-thiazolidine-2-thione (preparation described in: Liebigs Ann. Chem., 1985, 58-64) were dissolved in 36% aqueous HCl (150 ml), cooled to -20°C and Cli was bubbled through the solution for 0.5 h while keeping its temperature below -20°C. Ether (400 ml cooled to -15°C) was then added and after stirring for 5 minutes the layers were separated. The organic layer was treated with liquid NH3 (200 ml) and the mixture allowed warming slowly to RT. The solvent was removed in vacuo to give 5-methyl-thiazole-2-sulfonic acid amide as an off-white solid. EI mass spectrum, m/e 178 (M calculated for C4H6N2O2S2: 178).<br>
