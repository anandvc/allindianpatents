				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a vibration based non-contact slag detection<br>
method and system. The vibration-based system indicates the arrival of slag<br>
from the ladle to the tun dish.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Liquid steel/slag enters the tundish via a refractory tube attached to the<br>
bottom of the ladle, called shroud.<br>
The passage of liquid steel through the shroud causes it to vibrate in a<br>
pattern which changes considerably as the slag starts to flow through it. At<br>
present the detection system is based on electromagnetic sensor, which<br>
detects the arrival of slag by determining the change in magnetic flux as the<br>
fluid through the nozzle changes from steel to slag. Such a system requires<br>
electromagnetic sensor to be fitted in each of the ladle and is thus highly<br>
susceptible to thermal and physical damages. The ladle must be specifically<br>
adapted to accept the coil and as each ladle arrives at the teeming position, a<br>
cable connection must be performed which could be hazardous in view of<br>
possible ladle reactions. Steel penetration in the nozzle block can damage<br>
the coil or impede its operation. The ladle is removed from the operation<br>
cycle to replace the damaged or malfunctioning coil.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main object of the present invention therefore is to provide a low cost<br>
and low maintenance effort vibration based non-contact slag detection<br>
system.<br>
This object is achieved by locating the sensing device away from the<br>
harmful conditions of the ladle shroud and manipulator arm.<br>
The non-contact slag detection system comprises of a sensing arrangement,<br>
which is located away from the harmful conditions of the ladle shroud and<br>
its manipulator arm. A laser sensor is positioned on the shroud, which<br>
measures the velocity of the vibration using the Doppler effect. That is, it<br>
measures the wavelength of the laser beam as it is reflected from the<br>
vibrating receiver. The laser is capable of remote measurement of the<br>
velocity of vibration between the range of 10 to 1000mm/sec situated at a<br>
distance of 200 meters. The system reads the vibration signature and<br>
analyses the change that occurs at the onset of slag arrivaLThe system is thus<br>
able to discriminate between steel flow and slag flow through the ladle<br>
shroud. This is a complete application with versatile as well as user friendly<br>
graphical user interface. Here, user can interact with the main application by<br>
giving different constant parameters (e.g. initial threshold value, initial'<br>
mean value, variance and change of mean value).<br>
Thus the present invention provides a vibration based non-contact slag<br>
detection system comprising a velocity transducer 1 for sensing a vibration<br>
signal from an oscillating ladle shroud 8 and a processor 5 located away<br>
from said ladle shroud 8 for receiving signals from said laser velocity<br>
transducer 1 and said laser distance meter 2 and performing tun dish level<br>
calculation for detecting the arrival of slag.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying<br>
drawings where :<br>
Figure 1 shows in schematic form the non-contact slag detection system of<br>
the present invention;<br>
Figure 2 shows the flow diagram of the method of slag detection of the<br>
present invention.<br>
The arrangement of the non-contact slag detection system of the present<br>
invention is schematically represented in Fig. 1.<br>
A ladle 9, after receiving liquid steel tapped into it from the basic oxygen<br>
furnace, is brought onto the continuous casting floor. The molten liquid<br>
steel from the ladle 9 is poured into a refractory lined container called<br>
tun dish (not shown). The role of the tundish is to maintain a continuous<br>
supply of liquid steel to the mould even when the ladle 9 is changed. The<br>
ladle rests on a device called turret, which comprises two arms and has the<br>
rotation feature (about the vertical axis). One of the turret arms brings the<br>
filled steel ladle 9 over the tundish while the other arm of the turret, holding<br>
the empty tun dish, swings out the ladle from over the tundish to facilitate its<br>
removal and replacement by another filled ladle. In order to ensure a good<br>
quality of continuously cast product - it is important that the molten steel surface, during its transfer from ladle into the tundish, is completely insujted<br>
from coming into contact with the atmospheric air. This objective is achieved<br>
by providing a refractory tube called a shroud 8 at the bottom of the ladle 9.<br>
The other end of the shroud is dipped into the molten steel in the tundish to<br>
ensure complete insulation of falling stream from atmospheric contact. The<br>
ladle nozzle opening and closing is achieved by means of a slide gate<br>
mechanism of a hydraulic cylinder, a refractory moving plate and a fixed<br>
plate. The fixed and the movable plate both having an opening (bore) cut on<br>
them. The closed state of the ladle is achieved by moving the bore of the<br>
movable plate away from the fixed plate" bore while the open state of the<br>
ladle is achieved by aligning both the bores. The movement of the movable<br>
plate is done with the help of slide gate cylinder.<br>
The system architecture includes a laser velocity transducer I like an<br>
OMETRON VS-100 transducer for sensing the vibration signal. This is an<br>
industrially engineered interferometer, which functions as a non-contacting<br>
velocity transducer capable of remote measurement of the velocity of a<br>
continuously moving solid surface. The primary instrument output is an<br>
analog voltage proportional to surface velocity, which can be fed to external<br>
signal analysis equipment.<br>
A laser distance meter 2 is provided focused on a target plate mounted on<br>
the slide gate cylinder piston. This is needed to know the extent of slide gate<br>
opening/closure.<br>
A voltage to current converter 3 like the one from M/s Analog Devices, USA is<br>
needed for converting the signals generated by the laser velocity transducer<br>
before it is fed to current to voltage converter. This enables the proper<br>
transmission of velocity transducer signal to a long distance.<br>
A milli ampere to voltage converter 4 like the one from M/s Analog Devices,<br>
USA is used for converting the current signals obtained from the voltage to<br>
current converter to voltage signals before it is fed to a processor.<br>
A processor 5 receives voltage signals from both the level measurement<br>
velocity transducer 1 and the distance meter 2. The tundish level calculation<br>
is performed (as given below) which can then be displaced in a man/machine<br>
interface display unit 7 located in the caster control room. The processor 5<br>
can be a Motorola 68000 processor from Pep Modular Computer, Germany<br>
with an inbuilt analog to digital converter.<br>
A 422/232 converter 6 like ADAM 4520 can be used for transmitting the<br>
output of the laser distance meter 2 obtained in the serial data form to a long<br>
distance before it is fed into the processor 5.<br>
The method of detecting the arrival of slag in the present invention has been<br>
illustrated comprehensively in Fig. 2. The steps include generating a vibration<br>
signal from an oscillating shroud 8 using a laser velocity transducer I. A signal<br>
is then generated using a laser distance meter 2 indicating the extent of<br>
opening/closure of slide gates of said ladle shroud 8. The signals from both<br>
the laser velocity transducer I and the laser distance meter 2 are then<br>
transmitted long distance before feeding to a processor 5 for<br>
performing tun dish level calculations and detect the arrival of slag in the<br>
ladle shroud 8.<br>
For transmitting the signals to long distance a voltage to current and a<br>
current to voltage converter are used in the case of the laser velocity<br>
transducer 1. A 422/232 converter 6 is used in the case of the signal from<br>
said laser distance meter 2.<br>
The vibration signal of the oscillating shroud 8 is obtained with the help of<br>
laser velocity transducer 1. During casting operation a number of noise<br>
signals get superimposed on the basic shroud vibration. These noise signals<br>
are captured (e.g. slide gate movement, turret movement, tundish movement<br>
etc) as digital input signals in to the system and are handled appropriately.<br>
The detection module is based on a fault detection and diagnosis one based<br>
on the statistical framework. When the signals are corrupted with noise that<br>
is random in nature its values are assumed in a particular probability density<br>
function. The basic approach of the calculation is to obtain "CUSUM"<br>
(cumulative sum) by calculating "log-likelihood ratio" from the vibration<br>
signals. The calculated CUSUM is compared with its threshold value.<br>
Whenever the CUSUM value exceeds the prefixed threshold value, alarm is<br>
generated that the fault (slag) has arrived. The calculation for detection is<br>
given below :<br>
Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) of log likelihood ratio statistics, Sk is defined as,<br><br>
where Yk is the random sequence with probability density P? (y) and ? is the<br>
scalar parameter,<br><br>
where, ? = ?1<br>
and i represents a notation of a particular value of vibration signal displayed in<br>
serial data form, fed into the processor.<br>
The aim is to detect and estimate this change in the parameter 9.<br>
The algorithm is based on single statistics, the<br>
log-likelihood ratio.<br>
Let and denote expectation of the random variables under two<br>
distributions P?0 and P?0 respectively.<br><br>
A change in 0 is reflected as change in sign of the mean value of the log<br>
likelihood ratio.<br>
