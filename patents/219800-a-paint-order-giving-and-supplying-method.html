Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
A toned-paint order-giving and supplying method of the present invention includes a first invention method to fourth invention method. First, the first invention method is described below.<br>
The first invention method includes the following steps (1) to (4). Step(1)<br>
Step (1) is a step of allowing a paint orderer such as a repair painter to input the colorimetric data of a reference color with which the color of a paint should be matched through toning, the type of the paint, and a necessary quantity of the paint, and if necessary, the date of dehvery, the gloss of a paint film, micro-briUiant-feeling data, and a toning class to a computer terminal.<br>
In the case of repair painting such as automobile repair painting, when forming a paint film by painting a toned paint, it i&amp; necessary that the difference between cobrs of the paint film of a repair painting portion and the pain film nearby the repair painting portion cannot be easily visually observed. Therefore, it is usuaEy preferable that the above reference color is the color of the surfe.ce of a paint film nearby the repair painting portion.<br>
It is allowed that the colorimetric data of a reference color is the data measured by a colorimeter that performs measurement at one angle. However, it is more preferable to use the data measured by a multi-angle colorimeter because it is possible to obtain higher-accuracy data.<br><br>
A paint color is measured by a multi-angle colorimeter under two or more angular conditions, that is, different incident angles of measuring light or different light-receiving angles each of which is an angle formed between a mirror reflection axis and a Mght-receiving axis. The mirror reflection axis is an axis for forming a reflection angle when an incident angle is equal to the reflection angle such as an axis having a reflection angle of 45° when an incident angle is equal to 45".<br>
To change light-receiving angles, the angular conditions are not restricted. However, the following angular conditions are preferable because it is possible to easily correspond to visual determination of a color: in the case of two angular conditions, the above light-receiving angles must be equal to one angle in the range between 15" and 30° and one angle in a range between 75" and 110°; in the case of three angular conditions, the above hght-receiving angles must be equal to one angle in a range between 15° and 30°, one angle in a range between 35" and 60°, and one angle in a range between 75° and 110°; and in the case of four angular conditions, the above Hght-receiving angles must be equal to one angle in a range between 15° and 30°, one angle in a range between 35° and 60", one angle in a range between 70" and 80°, and one angle in a range between 90° and 110".<br>
It is allowed that measured values (angular criterion measured values) obtained by measuring the above reference color under various angular conditions are any values as long as the values can specify a color, that is, the values can show or compute lightness, chroma, and hue. For example, the values can be shown by the XYZ color system (X,Y,Z), Hunter Lab color system (L, a, and b values), L*C*h color system (L* value, C* value, and h value) specified in the CIE (1994), or Munsell color system (H, V, and C). Above all, the display according to the L*a*b * color system or L*C*h color system is generally used for the color display in industrial fields including the automobile repair painting field.<br>
The gloss of a paint film input according to necessity is measured according to necessity when it is a frosting paint film,<br><br>
which shows the specular gloss specified in JIS K-5400 7,6 (1990) and can be measured by a glossimeter at various light reflection angles.<br>
The micro-brilliant-feeling data input according to necessity is input according to necessity in the case of the color of a paint having a brilliant feeling and containing a briUiant material such as a briUiant pigment having a glittering feeHng and an interference action such as scaly aluminum powder, deposited aluminum powder, colored aluminum powder, mica-like iron oxide, mica powder, metal-oxide-covered mica powder, metal-oxide-covered silica flake, or brilliant graphite. The micro-briUiant feeUng denotes a specific brilliant texture revealed in the color of a paint containing a briUiant material such as aluminum powder or brilliant mica powder.<br>
It is possible to measure micro-brilliant-feeling data by, for example, a micro-brilliant-feeling measuring instrument and moreover, compare micro-brUliant-feeUng sample-color tags with a reference color, select a color tag having a very-similar micro-briUiant feeling, and obtain the micro-briUiant-feeling data of a purposed paint film from the color tag. The micro-briUiant-feeling sample-color tags can be sample-color tags in which color tags obtained by applying briUiant-material-containing paints prepared by changing qualities, particle diameters, and blending quantities of briUiant materials and blending the materials to a substrate and drying the substrate are systematicaUy arranged.<br>
As specific examples of the micro-brUliant-feeUng sample-color tags, it is possible to use a booklet and cards showing paint colors of domestic and foreign automobiles classified every fiscal year and automobile maker.<br>
Because micro-briUiant-feeUng data, color numbers, or color names are entered in micro-brUUant-feeling sample-color tags, it is possible to extract micro-briUiant-feeUng data from the color numbers or color names. Various types of micro-brilliant-feeling data are considered. The present inventors describe in the specification of Japanese Patent AppUcation No. 28414/2000 that micro-briUiant feelings are weU matched each other when two briUiant-feeUng<br><br>
parameters such as a parameter "MGR" showing particle feeling {perception emitted from irregular non-oriented pattern (random pattern) caused by orientation and overlap of brilliant pigments in paint film} and a parameter "MBV" obtained by digitizing a glittering feeling (perception of irregular fine brightness caused by light regularly-reflected from brilUant pigments in paint film) coincide with each other. Though not restricted, it is possible to preferably use these parameters as micro-brilhant-feeling data.<br>
The above toning class input according to necessity decides a matching degree of a toned-paint color to a reference color (allowable range) and it is possible to change prices of a toned paint in accordance with a toning class. A toning class can be, for example, a color difference between the colorimetric data of a reference color and the paint-color data of a toned paint plate formed by a toned paint.<br>
A paint orderer inputs the colorimetric data of the reference color, type of a toned paint and a necessary quantity of the toned paint, and if necessary, the gloss of a paint film, micro-briUiant-feeling data, and a toning class to a computer terminal.<br>
Before entering a toning job, a paint orderer can estimate an allowable limit of toning by a designated type of paint in accordance with computer toning using a colormatching computation logic about the colorimetric data of the reference color, change the colorimetric data of the reference color in the toning job to data within an allowable limit of toning by the designated type of paint or change types of paints when it may be difficult to prepare a purposed toned paint with the designated type of paint. It is possible to perform the computer toning using the color-matching computation logic by a computer toning function installed in the computer of the paint orderer and moreover, use the computer toning function of a server computer by connecting the computer of the paint orderer to the server computer.<br>
Step (2)<br><br>
Step (2) is a step of allowing a paint orderer to select a toning person and give an order for a toning job to the selected toning person.<br>
For a paint orderer to select a toning person, it is possible to use either of the methods described in the following Items (a) and (b).<br>
(a)	A method of retrieving order backlogs of a plurality of toning persons by a computer system and selecting a toning person out of the retrieved contents. The above order-backlog data is updated at any time or regularly whenever the data is changed.<br>
(b)	A method of opening a toning job to a plurality of toning persons by a computer system, accepting tenders by the computer system, and selecting a toning person in accordance with a tender result.<br>
An order for a toning job is given to the toning person selected as described above by appending the data of an allowable limit of toning by and blending of a designated type of paint through the computer toning using the colorimetric data of a reference color, the type of a paint and a necessary quantity of the paint, and if necessary, the date of delivery, the gloss of a paint film, micro-brilliant-feeling data, toning class, and a color-matching computation logic according to necessity.<br>
An order for a toning job is given by connecting the computer of a paint orderer to that of a toning person. In the case of the above method (a), it is generally necessary to append the above data when giving an order for a toning job. In the case of the above method (b), when the above data is opened to the public together with a toning job by a computer system, it is allowed to omit the appendance of the colorimetric data of the above reference color when giving an order for the toning job.<br>
Step (3)<br>
Step (3) is a step of allowing a toning person to communicate the order-receiving approval of a toning job to a paint orderer and prepare a toned paint.<br><br>
A toning person checks in the above step (2) whether an error or the like is present in a toning job transmitted from a paint orderer according to necessity. If an error is present, the toning person communicates the error to the paint orderer to obtain a correct toning job. When occasion demands, the toning person can decline the toning job. A method for a toning person to approve order reception of a toning job for a paint orderer is not restricted. However, it is possible to preferably approve order reception by transmitting the order reception approval through a computer.<br>
The toning person can prepare a toned paint matched to the toning job whose order is approved in accordance with a conventionallypubliclyknown paint toning method.<br>
To prepare a toned paint, it is also possible to previously decide a toning-end-point allowable range in accordance with a toning class or the like and display that a computer toning system is present at the toning end point when a measured value of a toned paint plate comes into a toning-end-point allowable range.<br>
Moreover, it is preferable to obtain the colorimetric data of a toned paint plate painted with a final toned paint prepared for toning, painting conditions when preparing the toned paint plate, and if necessary, the gloss of a paint film and micro-brilliant-feeiing data.<br>
Step (4)<br>
Step (4) is a step of supplying the toned paint obtained in the above step (3) to a paint orderer. to supply the paint to the paint orderer, it is possible to append a toned paint plate painted with a final toned paint, the colorimetric data of the toned paint plate, painting conditions when preparing the toned paint plate, the gloss of a paint film, micro-brilliant-feeling data, and the data for an MSDS according to paint blending and safety indication. To supply the toned paint to the paint orderer, it is possible to preferably use a home delivery service of packages.<br>
Then, a second invention method is described below.<br><br>
The second invention method is a method including the change of toning jobs when it is difficult to prepare a toned paint according to a toning job in step (2) of the first invention method. The second invention method is the same as the first invention method except that the following step (2a) is included after step (2) and a toning job whose order is given to a selected toning person in step (3) is used as the change-approved toning job in the following step (2a). When the change of the toning job cannot be approved, it is possible to dechne the toning job. The second invention method is performed when an allowable limit of toning by a designated type of paint is not previously estimated in step (l) about the colorimetric data of a reference color through the computer toning using a color-matching computation logic.<br>
Step (2a)<br>
Step (2a) is a step of allowing a toning person to estimate an allowable hmit of toning by a designated type of paint through the computer toning using a color-matching computation logic about the content of a toning job, transmit the data of the allowable Umit of toning by the designated type of paint to a computer terminal of a paint orderer when it is difficult to prepare a toned paint by the toning job, and receive the approval of change to a toning job within the allowable limit of toning. Before computer-toning the content of the toning job sent firom the paint orderer, the toning person checks whether an error is present in the toning job according to necessity. If an error or the like is present, the toning person can communicate the error to the paint orderer and obtain a correct t»ning job.<br>
In the case of the second invention method, the toning person prepares a toned paint suitable for the change-approved toning job in step (3) after the above step (2a).<br>
The second invention method includes the same steps as steps (3) and (4) after the above step (2a).<br>
It is possible to include the following step (5) after step (4) in both the above fist and second invention methods.<br><br>
Step (5)<br>
Step (5) is a step of determining a toned paint suppUed by the above step (4). That is, step (5) is a step of allowing a painter (usually, a paint orderer or a person to whom painting is requested from the paint orderer) to prepare a test paint plate by test-painting the plate with the supplied toned paint, obtain the colorimetric data of the test paint plate, compare the colorimetric data of the test paint plate with a reference color, and determine whether the criterion of the toning end point is satisfied. The above test painting simulates the full-scale painting and therefore, the test painting must be test painting capable of reproducing a paint color in the full-scale painting. Painting conditions for the test painting are not restricted but the conditions can be standard painting conditions when performing painting with the above paint. For example, it is preferable that the above conditions are the same as the painting conditions when preparing the toned pain in the above step (3).<br>
Moreover, the colorimetric data of a reference color used to determine whether a test paint plate satisfies the criterion of the toning end point is the colorimetric data of a reference color for a toning job. For determination, it is also possible to use the data obtained by measuring a reference plate again for convenience' sake. The colorimetric data of a test paint plate is compared with a reference color to determine whether the criterion of the toning end point is satisfied. The criterion can be a criterion (toning class or the like) of the toning end point agreed by both a paint orderer and a toning person.<br>
When a determination result in the above step (5) does not satisfy the criterion of the toning end point, the following step (6) is executed. However, it is impossible to satisfy the criterion of the toning end point even by step (6), it is possible to make the toning person perform toning again.<br>
Step (6)<br>
Step (6) is a step of allowing a computer to display painting conditions for satisfyiag the criterion of the toning end point<br><br>
and allowing a painter (usually, a paint orderer or person to whom painting is requested from the paint orderer) to prepare a retest paint plate by test-painting the plate with a toned paint in the same step as the above step (5) under the painting conditions, compare the colorimetric data of a retest paint plate with a reference color by a computer, and determine whether the criterion of the toning end point is satisfied. When a determination result in step (6) does not satisfy the criterion of the toning end point, it is possible to repeat step (6) until the criterion is satisfied. Moreover, when it is impossible to satisfy the criterion of the toning end point even by step (6), it is possible to make a toning person perform re-toning.<br>
Painting conditions for satisfying the criterion of the above toning end point include a dilution ratio (painting viscosity), a spray air pressure for spray painting, a distance between a spray gun and a nozzle, an attached quantity of a paint, and a setting time after painting, and it is possible to obtain the above conditions in accordance with the paint-color change data due to the fluctuation of the painting conditions of the toned paint. Moreover, it is possible to obtain the above painting conditions in accordance with the paint-color change data due to the fluctuation of painting conditions of the same type of a paint of a similar color having been accumulated so fer instead.<br>
Also in both the first and second invention methods, it is possible to obtain perform full-scale painting after step (4). However, it is preferable to perform full-scale painting under predetermined painting conditions after it is determined that the criterion of the toning end point is satisfied in the above step (5) or (6),<br>
A third invention method includes the following steps (1) to (5).<br>
Step (1)<br>
Step (1) is a step of allowing a paint orderer such as a repair painter to input the colorimetric data of a reference color with which the color of a paint should be matched through toning, the type and a necessary quantity of the paint, and if necessary the date of<br><br>
delivery, gloss of a paint film, micro-brilliant-feeling data, and a toning class to a computer terminal, connect the computer terminal to a server computer of an agent, and enter a toning job.<br>
A step of obtaining measured data of the reference color in step (1) of the third invention method can be executed similarly to the step of obtaining the measure data of the reference color in step (1) of the above first invention method,<br>
A paint orderer inputs the colorimetric data of the above reference color, the type and a necessary quantity of a toned paint, and if necessary the date of delivery, gloss of a paint film, micro-briUiant-feeling data, and a toning class to a computer terminal, connects the terminal to a server computer of an agent, and enters a toning job.<br>
Before entering the toning job, the paint orderer estimates an allowable limit of toning by a designated type of paint through the computer toning using a color-matching computation logic about the colorimetric data of the above reference color. When it may be difficult to prepare a purposed toned paint by the designated type of paint, it is possible to change the colorimetric data of the above reference color in the toning job to data within the allowable limit of toning by the designated type of paint. The computer toning using the above color-matching computation logic can be performed by using a computer toning function installed in the computer of the paint orderer and moreover, it is possible to use the computer toning function by connecting the computer to the server computer of the agent.<br>
Step (2)<br>
Step (2) is a step of allowing an agent to select a toning person and give an order for a toning job to the selected toning person. Before giving the order to the toning person, the agent checks in the above step (1) whether an error is present in the toning job sent from a paint orderer according to necessity. When an error is present, the agent communicates the error to the paint orderer to obtain a correct<br><br>
toning job. When occasion demands, the agent can decline the toning job.<br>
For an agent to select a toning person, it is possible to use either of the methods described in the following Items (a) and (b).<br>
(a)	A method of retrieving delivery states between a plurality of toning persons and a paint orderer and order backlogs of the toning persons by a computer system and selecting a toning person in accordance with the retrieval contents. The data of the above delivery states and order backlogs is updated at any time or regularly whenever the data is changed.<br>
(b)	A method of opening a toning job to a plurality of toning persons by a computer system, accepting tenders by the computer system, and selecting a toning person in accordance with a tender result.<br>
An order for a toning job is given to the toning person selected as described above by appending the data of an allowable Umit of toning by and blending of a designate type of a paint through the computer toning using the colorimetric data of a reference color, the type and a necessary quantity of the paint, and if necessary a toning class, date of delivery, and color-matching computation logic according to necessity.<br>
A method for giving an order for a toning job is not restricted. However, it is preferable to give the order by connecting a server computer of an agent to a computer terminal of a toning person. In the case of the above method (a), it is normally necessary to append the above data to give an order for a toning job. In the case of the above method (b), when the above data is opened to the public together with a toning job by a computer system, it is allowed to omit the appendance of the colorimetric data of the above reference color.<br>
Step (3)<br>
Step (3) is a step of allowing an agent to obtain an order-receiving approval fix&gt;m a toning person and transmit an order-receiving decision to a computer terminal of a paint orderer. Though a method for an agent to obtain an order-receiving approval from a<br><br>
toning person is not restricted, it is preferable to obtain the approval by connecting a computer terminal of the toning person to a server computer of the agent.<br>
When the agent cannot obtain the order-receiving approval from the toning person, it is possible to negotiate order-receiving conditions with the toning person or select other toning person in the above step (2).<br>
Step (4)<br>
Step (4) is a step of allowing a toning person to prepare a toned paint corresponding to the content of the above toning job whose order receiving is approved. It is possible to prepare the toned paint in accordance with the conventionally-publicly-known paint toning method.<br>
To prepare the toned paint, by previously deciding a toning-end-point allowable range in accordance with a toning class or the like, it is possible to display that a computer toning system is present at the toning end point when the measured value of a toned paint plate comes into a toning-end-point allowable range.<br>
Moreover, it is preferable to obtain the colorimetric data of a toned paint plate painted with a final toned paint prepared for toning, painting conditions when preparing the toned paint plate, and if necessary, the gloss of a paint film and micro-briUiant-feelLng data.<br>
Step (5)<br>
Step (5) is a step of supplying the toned paint obtained in the above step (4) to a paint orderer. When supplying the toned paint to the paint orderer, it is preferable to append not only the toned paint but also the data of the colorimetric data of a toned paint plate painted with a final toned paint, painting conditions when preparing the toned paint plate, the gloss of a paint film, micro-brUliant-feeling data, MSDS according to paint blending, and safety indication. To supply the toned paint to the paint orderer, it is possible to preferably use a home delivery service of packages.<br><br>
Then, a fourth invention method is described below.<br>
The fourth invention method is a method including the change of toning jobs when it is difficult to prepare a toned paint by the toning job in step (1) in the above third invention method. The fourth invention method is the same as the third invention method except that the following step (la) is further included after step (1) and a toning job whose order is given to a selected toning person is regarded as a toning job whose change is approved in the following step (la). When change of the toning job is not approved, it is possible to decline the toning job. The fourth invention method is normally executed when an allowable limit of toning by a designated type of paint is not previously estimated in step (19 of the third invention method about the colorimetric data of a reference color by the computer toning using a color-matching computation logic.<br>
Step (la)<br>
Step (la) is a step of allowing an agent to estimate an allowable limit of toning by a designated type of paint through the computer toning using a color-matching computation logic, transmit the data of an allowable limit of toning by the specified type of the paint to a computer terminal of a paint orderer when it is difficult to prepare a toned paint by a toning job, and receive the approval of change to a toning job within the allowable limit of toning from the paint orderer. The agent checks in step (l) whether an error is present in the toning job sent from the paint orderer according to necessity before applying computer toning t the content of the toning job. When an error is present, it IB possible communicate the error to the paint orderer and obtain a correct toning job.<br>
In the case of the fourth invention method, an agent selects a toning person in step (2) after the above step (la) and gives an order for a toning job whose change is approved in the above step (la) to the selected toning person. This order giving can be performed by a computer system after connecting a server computer of the agent with a computer terminal of the selected toning person. To perform the order giving, it is possible to transmit the computer<br><br>
toning data estimating the above allowable limit of toning to the toning person.<br>
The fourth invention method includes the same steps as steps (3), (4), and (5) of the above third invention method after the above step (2).<br>
The above third and fourth invention methods can include the following step (6) after step (5).<br>
Step (6)<br>
Step (6) is a step of determining the toned paint suppUed by the above step (5). That is, step (6) is a step of allowing a painter (usually, a paint orderer or a person to whom painting is requested from the paint orderer) to prepare a test paint plate painted by test-painting the plate with the supplied toned paint, obtaki the colorimetric data of the test paint plate, compare the colorimetric data of the test paint plate with a reference color by a computer, and determine whether the criterion of the toning end point is satisfied. The test painting simulates full-scale painting and it is necessary that the test painting can reproduce a paint color in the full-scale painting. Painting conditions for the test painting are not restricted but it is preferable that the painting conditions can be the standard painting conditions for painting with the paint and are conditions same as the painting conditions used to prepare the toned paint in the above step (4).<br>
Moreover, the colorimetric data of a reference color used to determine whether the criterion of a test-painting-plate toning end point is satisfied is the colorimetric data of the reference color in a toning job. For the above determination, it is also possible to use the data obtained by measuring a reference plate again for convenience' sake. The colorimetric data of a test paint plate is compared with a reference color by a computer to determine whether the criterion of the toning end point is satisfied. In this case, the criterion can be the criterion of the toning end point agreed between a paint orderer and a toning person.<br><br>
When the determination result in the above step (6) does not satisfy the criterion of the toning end point, the following step (7) is executed. However, it is impossible to satisfy the criterion of the toning end point even by step (7), it is possible to make a toning person perform re-toning.<br>
Step (7)<br>
Step (7) is a step of allowing a computer to display painting conditions for satisfying the criterion of the toning end point and allowing a painter (usually, a paint orderer or a person to whom painting is requested from the paint orderer) to prepare a retest paint plate by test-painting the plate with a toned paint in the same step as the above step (6) under the painting conditions, compare the colorimetric data of the retest paint plate with a reference color by the computer, and determine whether the criterion of the toning end point is satisfied. When a determination result does not satisfy the criterion of the toning end point in step (7), it is possible to repeatedly execute step (7) until the criterion is satisfied. Moreover, when it is impossible to satisfy the criterion of the toning end point even by step (7), it is possible to make a toning person perform toning again.<br>
Painting conditions for satisfying the above criterion of the toning end point are conditions such as a dilution ratio (painting viscosity) by a solvent, a spray air pressure for spray painting, the distance between a spray gun and a nozzle, an attached quantity of a paint, and setting time after painting, which can be obtained in accordance with the data for change of paint colors due to the fluctuation in painting conditions of the above toned paint. Moreover, the painting conditions can be obtained in accordance with the data for change of paint colors due to the fluctuation of the same type of paints of similar colors having been accumulated so far.<br>
In the case of the third and fourth invention methods, it IB also possible to perform fuU-scale painting after step (5). However, it is preferable to perform full-scale painting under predetermined painting conditions after it is determined that the criterion of the toning end point is satisfied in the above step (6) or (7).<br><br>
