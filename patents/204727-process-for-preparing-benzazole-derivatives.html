COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13] <br>
"PROCESS FOR PREPARING BENZAZOLE DERIVATIVES"<br>
APPLIED RESEARCH SYSTEMS ARS HOLDING N.V., of Pietermaai 15, Curacao, The Netherlands Antilles,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention is related to benzazole derivatives and its tautomers for use as pharmaceutically active compounds, as well as pharmaceutical formulations containing such benzazole derivatives. In particular, the present invention is related to benzazole derivatives displaying a sabstantial modnlatry, notably an inmbitory activity of the JNK (cJun-N-tenninal Kinase) pathway and which are therefore particularly useful in the treatment of disorders of the autoimmune and the neuronal system. The present invention is furthermore related to novel benzazole derivatives as well as to methods for their preparation and pharmaceutical compositions containing them.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Apoptosis denotes the complex contortions of the membrane and organelles of a cell as it undergoes the process of programmed cell death. During said process* the cell activates an intrinsic suicide program and systematically destroys itself. The following series of events can be observed:<br>
•	The cell surface begins to bleb and expresses pro-phagocytic signals. The whole apo-ptotic cell then fragments into membrane-bound vesicles that are rapidly and neatly disposed of by phagocytosis, so that there is rninimal damage to the surrounding tissue.<br>
•	The cell then separates from its neighbors.<br>
The nucleus also goes through a characteristic pattern of morphological changes as it commits genetic suicide, the chromatin condenses and is specifically cleaved to fragments ofDNA.<br>
Neuronal cell death plays an important role in ensuring that the nervous system develops normally. It appears that the death of developing neurons depends on the size of the target that they innervate: cells with fewer synaptic partners are more likely to die than those which have formed multiple synapses. This may reflect a process, which balances the<br><br>
relative number of pre- to post-synaptic neurons in the developing nervous system. Although neuronal cell death was assumed to be apoptotic, it was only recently that neurons in developing rodent brain were conclusively shown to undergo apoptosis as classified by morphology and DNA fragmentation. As cell death during development is clearly not a pathological process, it makes sense that cells actually cease to exist.<br>
Neuronal death occurs via either apoptotic or necrotic processes following traumatic nerve injury or during neurodegenerative diseases. Multiple components are emerging as key players having a role in driving neuronal programmed cell death. Amongst the components leading to neuronal apoptosis are members of the SAPK/JNK being a subfamily of MAP Kinases (MAPKs).<br>
MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinases) are serine/threonine kinases that are activated by dual phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine residues. In mammalian cells, there are at least three separate but parallel pathways that convey information generated by extra¬cellular stimuli to the MAPKs. Said pathways consist of kinase cascades leading to activa¬tion of the ERKs (extracellular regulated kinases), the JNKs (c-Jun N-terminal kinases), and the p38/CSBP kinases. While both the JNK and p38 pathways are involved in relaying stress-type extramolecular signals, the ERK pathway is primarily responsible for transducing mitogenic/differentiation signals to the cell nucleus.<br>
SAPK cascades represent a sub-family of the mitogen-activating protein kinase family, that are activated by different external stimuli including DNA damage following UV irradia¬tion, TNFα, IL-β, ceramide, cellular stress, and reactive oxygen species and have dis¬tinct substrate specificities. Signal transduction via MKK4/JNK or MKK3/p38 results in the phosphorylation of inducible transcription factors, c-Jun and ATF2, which then act as either homodimers or heterodimers to initiate transcription of down-stream effectors.<br>
c-Jun is a protein that is forming homodimers and heterodimers (with e.g. c-Fos) to produce the transactivating complex AP-1 which is required for the activation of many genes (e.g. matrix metalloproteinases) involved in the inflammatory response. The JNKs were<br><br>
discovered when it was found that several different stimuli such as UV light and TNF-a stimulated phosphorylation of c-Jun on specific serine residues in the N-terminus of the protein.<br>
In a recent publication of Xie X et al, {Structure 1998, 6 (8); 983-991) it has been sug¬gested that activation of stress-activated signal transduction pathways are required for neuronal apoptosis induced by NGF withdrawal in rat PC-12 and superior cervical ganglia (SCG) sympathetic neuronal cells. Inhibition of specific kinases, namely MAP kinase kinase 3 (MKK3) and MAP kinase kinase 4 (MKK4), or c-Jun (part of the MKK-4 cas¬cade) may be sufficient to block apoptosis (see also Kumagae Y et al, in Brain Res Mol Brain Res, 1999, 67(1), 10-17 and Yang DD et al in Nature, 1997,389 (6653); 865-870). Within a few hours of NGF deprivation in SCG neurones, c-Jun becomes highly phos-phorylated and protein levels increase. Similarly in rat PC-12 cells deprived of NGF, JNK and p38 undergo sustained activation while ERKs are inhibited. Consistent with this JNK3 KO mice are resistant to excitotoxicity induced apoptosis in the hippocampus and more importantly they display greatly reduced epileptic like seizures in response to excito¬toxicity as compared to normal animals (Nature 1997,389, 865-870).<br>
More recently, it has been reported that the JNK signalling pathway is implicated in cell proliferation and could play an important role in autoimmune diseases {Immunity, 1998,9, 575-585; Current Biology, 1999,3,116-125) which are mediated by T-cell activation and proliferation.<br>
Naive (precursor) CD4+helper T (Th) cells recognise specific MHC-peptide complexes on antigen-presenting cells (APC) via the T-cell receptor (TCR) complex. In addition to the TCT-mediated signal, a costimulatory signal is provided at least partially by the ligation of CD28 expressed on T-cells with B7 proteins on APC. The combination of these two signals induces T-cell clonal expression.<br><br>
After 4-5 days of proliferation, precursor of CD4+ T cells differentiate into armed effector Th cells that mediate the functions of the immune system. During the differentiation process, substantial reprogramming of gene expression occurs.<br>
Two subsets of effector Th cells have been defined on the basis of their distinct cytokine secretion pattern and their immunomodulatory effects: Thl cells produce JPNy and LT (TNF-P), which are required for cell-mediated inflammatory reactions; Th2 cells secrete JX-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10 and JX-13, which mediate B cell activation and differentiation. These cells play a central role in the immune response. The JNK MAP Kinase pathway is induced in Thl but not in Th2 effector cells upon antigen stimulation. Furthermore, the differen-tiation of precursor CD4+ T cells into effector Thl but not Th2 cells is impaired in JNK2-deficient mice. Therefore, in recent years it has been realized that the JNK kinase pathway plays an important role in the balance of Thl and Th2 immune response through JNK2.<br>
With the objective of inhibiting the JNK kinase pathway, WO/9849188 teaches the use of a human polypeptide, i.e. JNK-interacting protein 1 (UP-1), which is a biological product and which has also been assayed for overcoming apoptosis related disorders.<br>
Although such human polypeptides have been confirmed to have an inhibitory effect onto the JNK kinase pathway, a whole variety of drawbacks are associated with their use :<br>
•	The preparation of peptides or proteins may be expensive.<br>
•	The peptides or proteins may display poor membrane penetration and may not cross the blood brain membrane,<br>
•	The oral administration of peptides or proteins may not be available because of decomposition through hydrolysis by the acid medium of the stomach.<br>
•    Peptides or proteins may cause an autoimmune response.<br><br>
Hence, it was an objective of the present invention to provide relatively small molecules that avoid essentially all of the above-mentioned drawbacks arising from the use of bio-peptides or bio-proteins, however, which are suitable for the treatment of a variety of diseases, in particular of neuronal or the autoimmune system related disorders. It was notably an objective of the present invention to provide relatively small molecule chemical compounds being able to modulate, preferably to down-regulate or to inhibit the JNK (Jun kinase) pathway so to be available as a convenient method of treating a host of diseases. Moreover, it was an objective of the present invention to provide methods for preparing said small molecule chemical compounds. It was furthermore an objective of the present invention to provide a new category of pharmaceutical formulations for the treatment of a host of diseases. It was finally an objective of the present invention to provide a method of treating diseases that are caused by disorders of the autoimmune and/or the neuronal system.<br>

A further aspect of the present invention is related to the use of the benzazole derivatives according to formula I for the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions for the modu¬lation - notably of the inhibition - of the JNK pathway associated disorders, in particular of neuronal disorders and/or of disorders of the immune system as well as said pharmaceutical compositions themselves. Preferred JNK pathways are those involving JNK2 and/or JNK3.<br>
As pointed out above, the compounds of formula I are suitable to be used as a medicament. Hence, it is herein reported the compounds of formula I and its tautomers are suitable for use in treating a whole variety of diseases. Said diseases include disorders of the auto¬immune system and neuronal system of mammals, notably of human beings. More specifically, the compounds according to formula I, alone or in the form of a pharma¬ceutical composition, are useful for the modulation of the JNK pathway, more specifically for the treatment or prevention of disorders associated with abnormal expression or activity of JNK, notably of JNK2 and/or 3. Such an abnormal expression or activity of JNK could be triggered by numerous stirouli (e.g. stress, septic schock, oxidative stress, cytokines) and could lead to out-of-control apoptosis or autoimmune diseases that is frequently involved in the below enumerated disorders and diseases. Hence, the compounds according to formula I could be used for the treatment of disorders by modulating the JNK pathways. Said<br><br>
modulation of the JNK pathway could involve its activation, but preferably it involves the inhibition of the JNK pathways, notably of the JNK2 and/or 3. The compounds according to formula I could be employed alone or in combination with further pharmaceutical agents.<br>
Specifically, the compounds pursuant to formula I are useful for the treatment and/or prevention of immuno- and/or neuronal-related diseases or pathological states in which inhibition of JNK2 and/or JNK3 plays a role such as epilepsy; neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease; retinal diseases; spinal cord injury; head trauma, autoimmune diseases including multiple sclerosis, inflam¬matory bowel disease (IBD), rheumatoid arthritis; asthma; septic shock; transplant rejec¬tion; cancers including breast, colorectal, pancreatic and cardiovascular diseases including stroke, cerebral ischemia, arterosclerosis, myocordial infarction, myocordial reperfusion injury.<br>
Quite surprisingly it turned out that the compounds according to formula I do show a con¬siderable activity as inhibitors of JNK2 and/or 3. According to a preferred embodiment, the compounds according to the invention are essentially inactive in view of 2 further MAP Kinases, i.e. p38 and/or ERK2, belonging incidentally to the same family as JNK2 and 3. Hence, the compounds according to the present invention offer the possibility to selectively modulate the INK pathway, and in particular to come to grips with disorders related to the JNK pathways, while being essentially inactive with regard to other targets like said p38 and ERK2, so that they could indeed be viewed as selective inhibitors. This is of considerable significance, as these related enzymes are generally involved in different dis¬orders, so that for the treatment of a distinct disorder, it is desired to employ a correspon¬dingly selective medicament.<br>
Still a further object of the present invention is a process for preparing the novel benzo-thiazole derivatives according to formula I. A general synthetic access to the compounds according to formula I is the following :<br><br><br><br>

In a preferred method, the starting com¬pounds are shaken at 25 °C in solution in DMSO in the presence of potassium carbonate.<br>
Electrophiles are either commercially available or can be prepared fiom known compounds by conventional procedures known by one skilled in the art. Preferred electrophiles as start¬ing materials include methyl iodide and acetyl chloride.<br>
If the above set out general synthetic methods are not applicable for the obtention of com¬pounds of formula I, suitable methods of preparation known by a person skilled in the art should be used.<br>
A final aspect of the present invention is related to the use of the compounds according to formula I for the modulation of the JNK pathway, the use of said compounds for the pre¬paration of pharmaceutical compositions for the modulation of the JNK pathway as well as<br><br>
the formulations containing the active compounds according to formula I. JNK is believed to be involved in numerous disease states. Therefore, modulating the level of JNK, notably of JNK2 and/or JNK3 provides a variety of therapeutic applications, including epilepsy; neurodegenerative diseases mcluding Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease; retinal diseases; spinal cord injury; head trauma, autoimmune diseases including multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), rheumatoid arthritis; asthma; septic shock; transplant rejection; cancers including breast, colorectal, pancreatic and cardiovascular diseases including stroke, cerebral ischemia, arterosclerosis, myocordial infarction, myocordial repermsion injury.<br>
As used herein, "treating" refers to inhibiting or arresting the development of a disease, disorder or condition and/or causing the reduction, remission or regression of the symptoms of a disease, disorder or condition. Those of skill in the art will understand that various methodologies and assays may be used to assess the development of a disease, disorder or condition, and similarly, various methodologies and assays may be used to assess the reduction, remission or regression of the symptoms of a disease, disorder or condition.<br>
As used herein, the term "prevention of disease conditions mediated by JNK" refers to preventing a disease, disorder or condition from occurring in a subject who may be at risk for the disease, but has not yet presented any symptoms thereof. Those of skill in the art will understand that a variety of methods may be used to determine a subject at risk for a disease and that whether a subject is at risk for a disease will depend on a variety of factors known to those of skill in the art, including genetic make-up of the patient, age, body weight, sex, diet, general physical and mental health, occupation, exposure to environ¬mental conditions and the like, of the subject.<br>
When employed as pharmaceuticals, the benzazole derivatives of the present invention are typically administered in the form of a pharmaceutical composition. Hence, pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of formula I and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, dtiuent or excipient therefore are also within the scope of the present invention. A person skilled in the art is aware of a whole variety of such carrier, diluent or excipient<br><br>
compounds suitable to formulate a pharmaceutical composition. Also, the present invention provides compounds for use as a medicament. In particular, the invention provides the compounds of formula I for use as JNK inhibitor, notably for JNK2 and JNK3, for the treatment of disorders of the immune as well as the neuronal system of mammals, notably of humans, either alone or in combination with other medicaments.<br>
The compounds of the invention, together with a conventionally employed adjuvant, car¬rier, diluent or excipient may be placed into the form of pharmaceutical compositions and unit dosages thereof, and in such form may be employed as solids, such as tablets or filled capsules, or liquids such as solutions, suspensions, emulsions, elixirs, or capsules filled with the same, all for oral use, or in the form of sterile injectable solutions for parenteral (including subcutaneous use). Such pharmaceutical compositions and unit dosage forms thereof may comprise ingredients in conventional proportions, with or without additional active compounds or principles, and such unit dosage forms may contain any suitable effective amount of the active ingredient commensurate with the intended daily dosage range to be employed.<br>
When employed as pharmaceuticals, the benzazole derivatives of this invention are typi¬cally administered in the form of a pharmaceutical composition. Such compositions can be prepared in a manner well known in the pharmaceutical art and comprise at least one active compound. Generally, the compounds of this invention are adniinistered in a pharmaceu-tically effective amount. The amount of the compound actually administered will typically be determined by a physician, in the light of the relevant circumstances, including the con¬dition to be treated, the chosen route of administration, the actual compound administered, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, the severity of the patient's sym¬ptoms, and the like.<br>

Formulation 5 - Injection<br>
A benzazole compound of formula I is dissolved in a buffered sterile saline injectable<br>
aqueous medium to a concentration of approximately 5 mg/ml.<br>
Example 9: Biological assays<br>
Those of skill in the art can readily identify a variety of assays that can be used to assess the activity of benzazole compounds of the invention. The below specified assays are cited as examples to assess the suitability of the benzazole compounds of the invention for the modulation of INK and thus to modulate apoptosis.<br><br>
/JNK2 and 3 enzyme assay: JNK3 and/or JNK2 assays are perfonned in 96 well MTT plates, by incubation of 0.5 u.g of recombinant, pre-activated GST-JNK3 or GST-JNK2 with 1 \xg of recombinant, biotinylated GST-c-Jun and 2 uM 33y-ATP (2 nCi/ul), in the presence or absence of one or more benzazole inhibitors and in a reaction volume of 50 pi containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 10 mM MgCl2; 1 mM Dithiothreitol, and 100 uM NaV04. The incubation is performed for 120 min. at R.T and stopped upon addition of 200 p.1 of a solution containing 250 u.g of Streptavidine-coated SPA beads (Amersham, Inc.)*, 5 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100 and 50 uM ATP, in phosphate saline buffer. After incu¬bation for 60 minutes at RT, beads are sedimented by centrifugation at 1500 x g for 5 minutes, resuspended in 200 ul of PBS containing 5 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-l 00 and 50 uM ATP and the radioactivity measured in a scintillation p counter, following sedimen¬tation of the beads as described above. By substituting GST-c Jun for biotinylated GST-i ATF2 or myelin basic protein, this assay can be used to measure inhibition of preactivated p38 and ERK MAP Kinases, respectively.<br>
Representative values for some exemplary compounds are given in the table shown below:<br><br><br><br>
The values indicated in respect of JNK2 and 3, p38 and ERK2 refer to the IC50 (nM), i.e. the amount necessary to achieve 50% inhibition of the target (e.g. JNK2 or 3). The compound no. denotes a test compound as set out with its number in the above examples. From the above table it could be derived that the test compounds do have a significant effect both on JNK2 and more notably on JNK 3, but virtually no effect onto p38 and ERK2, thus delivering a quite selective inhibitory effect.<br>
The tested compounds according to formula I display an inhibition (IC50) with regard to JNK3 of less than 10 uM, more preferred less than 0.1 uM.<br>
In the following, the in vitro and in vivo assays are set out to which the compounds according tc the present invention may be subjected to confirm their JNK inhibitory and thus apoptosis regulating (i.e. inhibitory) activity.<br>

Jurkat cells, a human T cell leukemia cell line (American Type Culture Collection # TIB 152) were cultured in RPMI1640 medium (Gibco, BRL) supplemented with 30% of heat-activated FCS, Glutamine and Penstrep. The cell suspension in the medium is diluted to give 2.106 cells/mL. The cells were plated (2.10s cells/well) on a 96-well plate containing different concentration of test compound (final concentration of compounds, 10, 3,1,0.3, 0.1 uM). This mixture is incubated 30 minutes at 37°C in a humidified CO2 atmosphere. Cells were then treated with 10 ul PMA + Ionomyciue (0.1 uM and 1 uM final concen¬tration) in all wells except negative control. In wells without compounds, 10 ul of RPMI 2% DMSO (=0.1% final) is added.
