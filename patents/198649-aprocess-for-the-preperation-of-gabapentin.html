Field of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing Gabapentin Form-Ill and its use for the preparation of Gabapentin Form-IL<br>
Background of the Invention:<br>
Gabapentin (i.e. 1-aminomethyl-l-cyclohexaneacetic acid), of the Formula-1<br><br>
is the active principle mainly used for the treatment of convulsive type cerebral disorders, such as epilepsy, hypokinesia including fainting and other brain trauma and in general, it is deemed to produce an improvement in the cerebral functions. Commercially available Gabapentin is crystalline and exhibits various polymorphic forms such as monohydrate; Form-II and Form-Ill characterized by their typical IR and X-ray diffraction patterns.<br>
Several processes for the preparation of Gabapentin are reported in literature; US Patent Nos. US 4,087,544 and US 4,024,175 discloses some preparation methods starting from cyclohexane-1, 1-diacetic acid. They also discloses an acid salt Gabapentin hydrochloride hydrate in a stoichometric ratio of 4:4:1 and a sodium salt of Gabapentin hydrate in a stoichometric ratio of 2:1. US Patent No. US 4,894,476 and US Patent No. US 4,960,931 discloses a method for converting the hydrochloride salt into a crystalline monohydrate by eluting the aqueous solution through a basic ion-exchange resin, producing a slurry from the elute, adding an alcohol to the slurry and isolating the final product by centrifuging followed by drying.<br>
Our co-pending Indian Patent Application No 330/MAS/2003 discloses a method for the conversion of Gabapentin acid addition salts into Gabapentin Form-II directly by neutralization with base in a solvent at specified temperatures.<br><br>
PCT Publication WO 98 / 28,255 discloses a method for the preparation of Gabapentin Form-Ill from Gabapentin hydrochloride. The process involves the dissolution of Gabapentin hydrochloride salt in an organic solvent (Iso-propyl alcohol) by mixing at 25 oC for 30 min. followed by the addition of carbon, subjected to mixing for 2 hrs, followed by removal of inorganics by filtration. The solvent is then removed from the filtrate to obtain the solid so obtained is dried in vacuum at temperature not to exceed 35 oC. The dried residue is then treated with a second solvent and a base, mixed for 2hrs at 25 oC followed by filtration and drying yielding Gabapentin Fom&gt;IIL<br>
Form-Ill is converted to Form-II either by suspending Form-Ill in methanol at 25 oC for about 14 hrs followed by filtration and drying under vacuum at 35 oC or by suspending the humid cake of Form-Ill in methanol, refluxing followed by cooling to 34 oC, Crystallization is induced by seeding with pure Form-II for 60 min. followed by cooled to 25 oC, evaporating off the methanol in vacuum at temperature below 25 oC, cooling to 0 oC - 10  oC and maintaining the system at the temperature for 2hrs, followed by filtration and vacuum drying at 35 oC.<br>
The method of conversion of Gabapentin hydrochloride to Form-Ill as disclosed in PCT Publication WO 98 728,255 involves extensive work-up procedures such as complete distillation of the first solvent up to dryness under vacuum at low temperature, followed by the treatment using a second solvent and a base and finally isolating Form-Ill. Such multi step processes increase the number of solvents to be handled thereby enhancing cost of production. Further conversion of Form-Ill to Form-II by the published process involves long processing time and extensive operations such as seeding with pure Form-II to induce crystallization followed by removal of methanol under vacuum at 25 oC, isolation of the product by cooling, maintaining the system at specified temperatures for long periods, filtration and drying.<br>
There is a long-standing need in industry to develop operationally cost effective processes for the preparation of Gabapentin Form-Ill and its conversion to Gabapentin Form-II.<br><br>
Summary of the invention:<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide an elegant techno-commercially feasible process for the preparation of Gabapentin Form-Ill.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a process for the preparation of Gabapentin Form-Ill from Gabapentin hemisulphate hemihydrate.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a novel process for the preparation of Gabapentin Form-Ill from Gabapentin hydrochloride.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to explore processes for the conversion of Gabapentin Form-Ill to Gabapentin Form-II.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide an elegant process for the preparation of Gabapentin Form-II from the Gabapentin hydrochloride via Gabapentin Form-Ill.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide an elegant process for the preparation of Gabapentin Form-II from the Gabapentin hemisulphate hemihydrate via Gabapentin Form-Ill.<br>
Thus in accordance of this invention, 1,1-Cyclohexane diacetic acid monoamide is reacted with alkali hypo halite followed by acidification with acids in presence of an organic solvent to extract the liberated acid salts into that solvent followed by the addition of an ante solvent to crystallize the Gabapentin acid salts.
