DESCRIPTION<br>
ANTHRACENE       DERIVATIVE       AND       ORGANIC       ELECTROLUMINESCENCE DEVICE USING THE DERIVATIVE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a novel organic compound and an organic electroluminescence (electroluminescence will be referred to as EL,<br><br>
hereinafter) device using the organic compound. More particularly, the present invention relates to an anthracene derivative used as a material constituting an organic EL device and an organic EL device which uses the anthracene derivative and exhibits a high efficiency of light emission and excellent heat resistance.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Electroluminescence devices which utilize light emission in the electric field show high self-distinguishability because of the self-emission and are excellent in impact resistance because they are completely solid devices. Therefore, organic EL devices are used in the field of the back light of thin film display devices and liquid crystal displays and the planar light source.<br>
EL devices practically used at present are EL devices of the dispersion type. Since EL devices of the dispersion type require an alternating voltage of several tens volts or higher and 10 kiloHerz or higher, driving circuits of the EL devices are complicated.<br>
Therefore, organic EL devices which can be driven at a voltage of 10<br><br>
volts or lower and can achieve light emission of a high degree are actively studied. For example, organic EL devices having a laminate structure of a transparent electrode / a hole injection layer / a light emitting layer / a back face electrode are proposed (Appl. Phys. Lett., Volume 51, Pages 913 to 915 (1987) and Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. Showa 63(1988)-264629). In these organic EL devices, holes are efficiently injected into the light emitting layer through the hole injecting layer disposed in the organic EL devices. The light emitting layer used in the organic EL devices may be a single layer. However, an excellent balance between the electron transporting property and the hole transporting property cannot be achieved by the single layer structure. Improvement in the properties of the organic EL devices has been made by using a multi-layer laminate structure.<br>
Forming a laminate structure causes problems in that the process for producing the organic EL devices is complicated and the time required for the production increases and that restrictions such as the necessity for forming each layer into a sufficiently thin film arise. Moreover, in recent years, a lower driving voltage is required since information instruments are required to have a decrease size and to be portable. Therefore, development of a light emitting material and a hole transporting material which contribute to a decrease in the weight and a decrease in the driving voltage has been conducted. It is known that anthracene can be used as the light emitting material. However, forming a uniform thin film of anthracene is not easy. Therefore, introduction of various substituents into anthracene has been attempted. For example, condensed multi-ring aromatic hydrocarbons are proposed for the light emitting material of<br><br>
organic EL devices (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Nos. Heisei 4(1992)-178488, Heisei 6(1994)-228544, Heisei 6(1994)-228545, Heisei 6(1994)-228546, Heisei 6(1994)-228547, Heisei 6(1994)-228548, Heisei 6(1994)-228549, Heisei 8(1996)-311442, Heisei 8(1996)-12600, Heisei 8(1996)"12969 and Heisei 10(1998)-72579).<br>
However, organic EL devices using the above compounds have a problem in that the efficiency of light emission and heat resistance are not sufficient.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been made under the above circumstances and has objects of providing a novel compound which exhibits a high efficiency of light emission and excellent heat resistance when the compound is used as a material constituting an organic EL device and an organic EL device using the compound.<br>
As the result of extensive studies by the present inventors to achieve the above objects, it was found that the objects can be achieved by anthracene derivatives having specific structures. The present invention has been completed based on the knowledge.<br>

It is also preferable that the sheet resistivity of the cathode is several hundred Q/D or smaller. The thickness of the cathode is, in general, selected in the range of 10 nm to 1 μm and preferably in the range of 50 to 200 nm.<br>
In the organic EL device of the present invention, it is preferable<br>
that a layer of a chalcogenide, a metal halide or a metal oxide is disposed<br>
on the surface of at least one of the pair of electrodes prepared as described<br>
above.     Specifically,  it is preferable  that a  layer  of a  chalcogenide<br>
(including an oxide) of a metal such as sihcon and aluminum is disposed on<br>
the surface of the anode at the side of the light emitting medium layer and<br>
a layer of a metal halide or a metal oxide is disposed on the surface of the<br>
cathode at the side of the light emitting medium layer.    Due to the above<br>
layers, stability in driving can be improved.<br>
Preferable examples of the chalcogenide include SiOx (l<x></x>
AlOx (1<x sion and sialon. preferable examples of the metal></x>
halide include CsF, LiF, MgF2, CaF2 and fluorides of rare earth metals.<br>
Preferable examples of the metal oxide include CS2O, Li2O, MgO, SrO,<br>

As the light emitting layer in the organic EL of the present invention, a layer having the combination of the following functions is<br>
preferably used.<br>
(1)   The injecting function: the function of injecting holes from the anode<br>
or the hole injecting layer or injecting electrons from the cathode or the<br><br>
electron injecting layer when an electric field is applied.<br>
(2)	The transporting function: the function of transporting injected<br>
charges (electrons and holes) by the force of the electric field.<br>
(3)	The light emitting function: the function of providing the site for<br>
recombination of electrons and holes and emitting light generated by the<br>
recombination.<br>
The easiness of injection of holes may be different from the easiness of injection of electrons. The ability of transporting holes expressed by the mobility of holes may be different from the ability of transporting electrons expressed by the mobility of electrons. It is preferable that either holes or electrons are transported. The above anthracene derivative represented by any of general formulae (I), (II), (IF) and (III) satisfies the above three conditions and the light emitting layer can be formed by using the anthracene derivative as the main component.<br>
As one of the materials constituting the light emitting layer of the organic EL device, a substance forming a recombination site can be used. The substance forming a recombination site is a substance which positively provides a site for recombination of electrons and holes injected from the both electrodes or a substance which provides a site where a recombination energy is transported and light is emitted although the recombination of electrons and holes does not take place. Therefore, when the substance forming a recombination site is used in combination, electrons and holes are recombined at portions more concentrated around the center of the light emitting layer and the luminance of light emission can be increased in comparison with the single use of the anthracene derivative.<br>
From the standpoint of the above phenomenon, it is preferable that<br><br>
a substance having a higher quantum yield of fluorescence is used as the substance forming a recombination site in the light emitting layer of the organic EL device of the present invention. In particular, it is more preferable that the substance has a quantum yield of fluorescence of 0.3 to 1.0. As the substance forming a recombination site, a compound selected from styrylamine compounds, quinacridone derivatives, rubrene derivatives, coumarine derivatives, perylene derivatives, pyrane derivatives and fluoranthene derivatives or a mixture of compounds selected from these compounds is used. Further examples of the substance forming a recombination site include conjugated macromolecular compounds such as polyarylenevinylene derivatives and polyarylene and vinylene derivatives substituted with alkyl groups and alkoxy groups having 1 to 50 carbon atoms.<br>
It is preferable that the substance forming a recombination site is selected in accordance with the color of light emitted from the light emitting layer. For example, when emission of blue light is desired, it is preferable that perylene, a styrylamine derivative or a distyrylarylene derivative substituted with an amino group is used. When emission of green light is desired, it is preferable that a quinacridone derivative or a coumarine derivative is used. When emission of yellow light is desired, it is preferable that a rubrene derivative is used. When emission of orange light or reddish orange light is desired, it is preferable that a dicyanomethylpyrane derivative is used.<br>
In the present invention, it may be preferable that the anthracene derivative represented by any of general formulae (I), (II), (II) and (III) of the present invention is used as the substance forming a recombination<br><br>
site.<br>
In the organic EL device of the present invention, the amount of the substance forming a recombination site used in the device is decided in accordance with the luminance of light emission and the color of emitted light of the light emitting layer. It is preferable that the amount is in the range of 0.1 to 20 parts by mass per 100 parts by mass of the organic compound described above. When the amount of the substance forming a recombination site is less than 0.1 parts by mass, the luminance of light emission tends to decrease. When the amount exceeds 20 parts by mass, heat resistance tends to decrease. Therefore, to maintain an excellent balance between the luminance of the light emission and the heat resistance in the organic EL device, it is preferable that the amount is 0.5 to 20 parts by mass and more preferably 1.0 to 10 parts by mass per 100 parts by mass of the organic compound described above.<br>

When there are a plurality of these groups, the groups may be bonded to each other and form a saturated five-membered or six-membered group. In the compound, it is preferable that the bond is formed at the para-position of phenyl group, phenylene group and naphthyl group since the bonding is rigid and a smooth film is formed by vapor deposition without chemical decomposition.

As for the process for preparing the organic EL device of the present invention, the organic EL device can be prepared by forming the anode, the light emitting layer and, where necessary, the hole injecting layer and the electron injecting layer using the above materials in accordance with the above process, followed by forming the cathode. The organic EL device may be prepared in the reverse order, i.e., by preparing the cathode first<br><br>
and the anode last.<br>
As an embodiment, preparation of an organic EL device having the construction in which an anode, a hole injecting layer, a light emitting layer, an electron injecting layer and a cathode are formed on a substrate transmitting light in this order will be described in the following.<br>
The anode is formed first. A thin film of an anode material is formed on the substrate transmitting light in accordance with a process such as the vapor deposition process or the sputtering process so that the formed thin film has a thickness of 1 \im or smaller and preferably in the range of 10 to 200 nm. The hole injecting layer is then formed on the anode. As described above, the hole injecting layer may be formed in accordance with a process such as the vacuum vapor deposition process, the spin coating process, the casting process and the LB process. The vacuum vapor deposition process is preferable since a uniform film can be obtained and the formation of pin holes can be suppressed. When the hole injecting layer is formed in accordance with the vacuum vapor deposition process, the conditions of the vacuum vapor deposition process are different depending on the compound used (the material of the hole injecting layer) and the crystal structure and the recombination structure of the hole injecting layer to be formed. In general, it is preferable that the temperature of the source of the vapor deposition is selected in the range of 50 to 450°C, the degree of vacuum is selected in the range of 10-7 to 10-3 torr, the rate of vapor deposition is selected in the range of 0.01 to 50 nna/second, the temperature of the substrate plate is selected in the range of -50 to 300°C and the thickness of the film is selected in the range<br>
of 5 nm to 5 μm.<br><br>
The light emitting layer is formed on the hole injecting layer. Using a desired organic light emitting material, a thin film of the organic light emitting material is formed in accordance with a process such as the vacuum vapor deposition process, the sputtering process, the spin coating process and the casting process. The vacuum vapor deposition process is preferable since a uniform film can be obtained and the formation of pin holes can be suppressed. When the light emitting layer is formed in accordance with the vacuum vapor deposition process, the conditions of the vacuum vapor deposition process is different depending on the compound used. In general, the conditions can be selected in the same ranges as those described above in the formation of the hole injecting layer.<br>
The electron injecting layer is formed on the light emitting layer formed above. Similarly to the formation of the hole injecting layer and the light emitting layer, it is preferable that the vacuum vapor deposition process is used since the formation of a uniform film is necessary. The conditions of the vacuum vapor deposition process can be selected in the same ranges as those described in the formation of the hole injecting layer and the light emitting layer.<br>
The process for adding the anthracene derivative of the present invention is different depending on the layer in which the anthracene derivative is comprised. When the vacuum deposition process is used, the anthracene derivative can be vacuum vapor deposited simultaneously with other materials. When the spin coating process is used, the anthracene derivative can be used as a mixture with other materials.<br>
The cathode is laminated in the final step and the organic EL device can be obtained.    The cathode is constituted with a metal and the vacuum<br><br>
vapor deposition process or the sputtering process can be used for the formation. The vacuum vapor deposition process is preferable since formation of damages in the organic layers formed in previous steps during the formation of the cathode can be prevented.<br>
It is preferable that the steps for preparing the organic EL device from the formation of the anode to the formation of the cathode are conducted after the pressure in the apparatus for the preparation is reduced and while the pressure is maintained at the reduced pressure.<br>
When the organic EL device is used, the light emission can be observed when the anode is connected to the positive electrode (+) and the cathode is connected to the negative electrode (-) and a voltage of 3 to 40 V is applied. When the anode is connected to the negative electrode (-) and the cathode is connected to the positive electrode (-I-), the light emission is not observed at all. When an alternating voltage is applied, a uniform emission of light is observed only when the anode is connected to the positive electrode (-1-) and the cathode is connected to the negative electrode (-).    The wave form of the applied alternating voltage is not limited.<br>

Example 25    (Preparation of an organic EL device)<br>
A device was prepared in accordance with the same procedures as those conducted in Example 5 except that the light emitting layer was formed by using compound E44 in place of compound El. Using the prepared device, the properties of light emission were confirmed and the chromaticity coordinates were obtained. The results are shown in Table 1.<br>
Comparative Example 3	(Preparation of an organic EL device)<br>
A device was prepared in accordance with the same procedures as those conducted in Example 5 except that the light emitting layer was formed by using compound H2 expressed by the following formula in place of compound El. Using the prepared device, the properties of light emission were confirmed and the chromaticity coordinates were obtained. The results are shown in Table 1.<br><br><br>
Comparative Example 4	(Preparation of an organic EL device;)<br>
A device was prepared in accordance with the same procedures as those conducted in Example 5 except that the light emitting layer was formed by using compound H3 expressed by the following formula in place of compound El. Using the prepared device, the properties of light emission were confirmed and the chromaticity coordinates were obtained. The results are shown in Table 1.<br><br><br><br>
As shown in Table  1, the organic EL devices having the light emitting layers formed by using the anthracene derivatives of the present<br><br>
invention exhibited high efficiencies of light emission, small decreases in the luminance and high heat resistances. These properties were exhibited because these anthracene derivatives had high glass transition temperatures of 140oC or higher and the property of emitting strong fluorescence in the blue to green region. It is also shown that the organic EL devices of the present invention could emit blue light having more excellent purity of color than the light emitted by the devices of the Comparative Examples.<br>
In contrast, the organic EL devices of Comparative Examples 1, 3 and 4 exhibited low efficiencies of light emission. Moreover, the organic EL devices of Comparative Examples 1 and 4 exhibited strongly greenish light and could not be used as a device emitting blue light.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLTCARTLITY<br>
The anthracene derivative of the present invention is useful as the material constituting organic EL devices. In particular, when the anthracene derivative is used as a light emitting material, an excellent efficiency of light emission and excellent heat resistance (life) are exhibited and the obtained device is used as the device having the property of emitting fluorescence in the blue to green region.<br><br><br>
