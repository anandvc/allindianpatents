[Title of the Invention] MOTORCYCLE FRONT COWL STRUCTURE<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a front cowl structure covering an   area around a headlight in a motorcycle and more particularly to one which does not form a visible gap behind the headlight even during headlight optical axis adjustment as viewed sideways. [Background Art] [0002]<br>
It is known that as a front cowl structure in the vicinity of a motorcycle headlight in related art, a headlight cover is provided separately from a front vehicle body cover behind the headlight which constitutes a front cowl and this headlight cover is fitted to the headlight. [Patent Document 1] JP-A No. 2007-186128 [Disclosure of the Invention] [Problem to be Solved by the Invention] [0003]<br>
In the above related art, since an optical axis adjustment of the headlight is made by turning the front cowl together with the headlight integrally with the front cowl, a headlight fitting, harness and so on are exposed during optical axis adjustment due to a gap in the front cowl as the vehicle is viewed sideways and care must be taken to prevent deterioration in the appearance as the vehicle is viewed sideways.  Also there is a problem that<br><br>
in an attempt to hide the gap by a larger front cowl, care<br>
must be taken not to cause the front cowl to interfere \vith<br>
a vehicle body member, for example, a cowl when adjusting<br>
the headlight angle and the angle adjustment range is thus<br>
limited.<br>
[Means for Solving the Problem]<br>
[0004]<br>
In order to address the above problem, the invention in Claim 1 concerning a motorcycle front cowl structure is characterized in that a motorcycle front cowl structure includes a headlight fitted to a body frame with its optical axis angle adjustable, and a headlight cover integrally fitted to the headlight, the headlight cover constituting at least part of a front cowl covering an area around the headlight, where a front body cover with a front opening is fitted to the body frame behind the headlight in a way to cover an area around a head pipe transversely, a back extension extending backward is provided on the headlight cover's back, the back extension is inserted through the front opening into the front body cover, and the back extension overlaps the front body cover as viewed sideways in an optical axis angle adjustment range of the headlight. [0005]<br>
The invention in Claim 2 is characterized in that in Claim 1, the back extension covers a top of an angle adjusting shaft which supports the headlight in a vertically turnable manner and permits an optical axis<br><br>
angle adjustment to be freely made. [0006]<br>
The invention in Claim 3 is characterized in that in Claim 1, the headlight cover's transverse width is larger than the front opening of the front body cover as viewed frontally. [0007]<br>
The invention in Claim 4 is characterized in that in Claim 1, the front body cover can be split into left and right parts and the angle adjusting shaft is located inside the front body cover. [0008]<br>
The invention in Claim 5 is characterized in that in Claim 1, a backward extending rib extending backward is integrally provided on the bottom of the back of the headlight cover and this backward extending rib is located between winkers on left and right sides of a vehicle body to make the backward extending rib and the winkers overlap as viewed sideways. [0009]<br>
The invention in Claim 6 is characterized in that in Claim 1, the back extension is formed integrally with the upper part of the back of headlight cover^ [0010]<br>
The invention in Claim 7 is characterized in that in Claim 5, the backward extending rib is formed integrally with the bottom of the back of the headlight. [Effect of the Invention]<br><br>
[0011]<br>
According to the invention in Claim 1, part of the front of the body cover fitted in a way to cover the area around the head pipe is open and a back extension provided on the top of the back of the headlight cover is inserted through this open space into the body cover, so the back extension of the headlight unit and the body cover overlap as the vehicle is viewed sideways.  Therefore, when an angle adjustment is made for optical axis adjustment of the headlight, the headlight cover and the front body cover always overlap in the angle adjustment range, which prevents formation of a visible gap between the headlight cover and the front body cover as viewed sideways. Furthermore, since the front body cover is open on its front side, interference between the headlight unit and the body cover is prevented while a wide angle adjustment range of the headlight is assured. [0012]<br>
According to the invention in Claim 2, the back extension covers the top of the angle adjusting shaft, so the gap and the back of the headlight are invisible to the rider and the appearance is improved.  Moreover, in rainy weather, rain water from above is prevented from reaching the back of the headlight. [0013]<br>
According to the invention in Claim 3, the joint between the headlight cover and the front body cover is invisible as viewed frontally, so the appearance is<br><br>
improved.  In addition, during a run, entry of foreign matter, dust or the like through the joint is prevented. [0014]<br>
According to the invention in Claim 4, the front body cover can be split into left and right parts, maintenance of the angle adjusting shaft can be done simply by removing the front body cover.  In addition, the angle adjusting shaft is located inside the front body cover, which prevents entry of foreign matter, dust or the like from outside. [0015]<br>
According to the invention in Claim 5, during angle adjustment of the headlight, formation of a gap between an area under the headlight and the vehicle body is prevented and the appearance is improved as the vehicle is viewed sideways.  Furthermore, the backward extending rib covers the area under the headlight, which protects the headlight from dust or foreign matter coming from the tire. [0016]<br>
According to the invention in Claim 6, the back extension is integrally provided on the top of the back of the headlight cover, so the degree of freedom in forming the back extension is increased. [0017]<br>
According to the invention in Claim 7, the backward extending rib can be integrally formed on the bottom of the back of the headlight, so the backward extending rib can be easily formed and the number of components is decreased.<br><br>
[Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention] [0018]<br>
Next, one embodiment will be described referring to drawings.  Fig. 1 is a side view of a motorcycle according to this embodiment.  A front wheel 1 and a rear wheel 2 are supported by a body frame 3.  The upper parts of a pair of left and right front forks 4 supporting the front wheel 1 at their lower ends are turnably supported on a head pipe 5 provided at the front end of the body frame 3 and steered by a handlebar 6 at the upper ends of the front forks 4. [0019]<br>
A storage box 7 is supported on the body frame 3 behind the head pipe 5 and a seat 8 is located behind it and a fuel tank 9 is located under the seat 8.  The fuel tank 9 is supported on a seat rail 10 and the seat 8 is turnably fitted on the upper face of the fuel tank 9 by a hinge so that when the seat 8 is opened by turning it upward, a fueling cap is exposed to allow fuel supply to the fuel tank 9.  As the seat 8 is closed by turning it backward, it covers the top of the fuel tank 9.  A grab rail 11 is located at the rear end of the seat 8 and supported on the rear end of the seat rail 10. [0020]<br>
A water-cooled engine 12 is located between the front wheel 1 and rear wheel 2 and supported by the body frame 3. The engine 12 is cooled by a radiator 13 located ahead and obliquely above it.  The radiator 13 is located near the head pipe 5 and behind and obliquely above the front wheel<br><br>
1 and supported under the body frame 3.  The front of the cylinder 12a of the engine 12 is covered by a cylinder cover 12b.  The cylinder 12a is located in the front upper part of a crankcase 12c and tilted forward. [0021]<br>
The cylinder 12a of the engine 12 takes in air from an air cleaner 15 located under the fuel tank 9 through a carburetor 14 behind it and air is discharged through an exhaust pipe 16 extending toward the front part of the cylinder 12a.  The exhaust pipe 16 extends backward from the front part of the cylinder 12a through an area under the crankcase 12 to join a muffler 17 located on a lateral side of the rear wheel 2.  A heat tube 18 which contains catalyst is located in front of the muffler 17 and its top is covered by guard wire 19. [0022]<br>
The front end of a rear swing arm 20 is attached to the rear of the body frame 3 in a vertically swingable manner and a rear cushion 21 is vertically located between its middle part and the seat rail 10.  The rear wheel 2 is rotatably supported on the rear end of the rear swing arm 20.<br>
The rear wheel 2 has a driven sprocket 22 which is driven by a chain 24 put around a drive sprocket 23. [0023]<br>
Reference numeral 25 represents a headlight, 26 a front winker, 27 a screen, 28 a meter and 29 a tail lamp.<br>
A pair of left and right front winkers 26 are located<br><br>
on the both sides of the head pipe 5 behind the headlight<br>
25	and supported by the body cover.<br>
The tail lamp 29 is located under the grab rail 11 and supported on the rear end of the seat rail 10. [0024]<br>
The headlight 25 is located in front of the head pipe 5 and supported by the head pipe 5 and a screen 27 is provided above it and a headlight cover 30 is attached on the back side of the headlight 25 and screen 27.  The headlight 25, screen 27 and headlight cover 30 are integrated, constituting a headlight unit 31.  The screen 27 and headlight cover 30 constitute a front cowl which covers the vicinity of the headlight as part of the body cover.  This front cowl and the body cover (which will be described later) are made of resin. [0025]<br>
The body cover which covers the vehicle body behind the headlight unit 31 includes: a handlebar cover 32 which covers an area around the handlebar 6 and the meter 28; an upper cowl 33 which covers space between the front winkers<br>
26	under it; a side cowl 34 which covers lateral sides of<br>
the radiator 13 and storage box 7 and functions as a<br>
radiator shroud; a front side cover 35 which detachably<br>
covers a side opening in the side cowl 34; a center cover<br>
36	which lies behind the front winkers 26 and covers space between the upper cowl 33 and the side cowl 34; a box lid<br>
37	on the center cover 36 which covers the top of the storage box 7 in a way that it can be freely opened or<br><br>
closed; and   a   side covers 38 behind the side cowl 34   which covers the right (or left) side of the vehicle body.  The upper cowl 33 is equivalent to the front body cover in the present invention. [0026]<br>
Fig. 2 is a side view of the body frame 3.  The body frame 3 includes: a pair of main frames 40 which extend obliquely downward and backward while expanding left and right from the head pipe 5 at its front end; a pair of left and right seat rails 10 which are welded to their rear ends, extending obliquely upward and backward; a pair of left and right center frames 41 which curve downward from the rear ends of the main frames 40 and extend obliquely downward and backward; and a rear frame 42 which obliquely connects the rear ends of each center frame 41 and each seat rail 10. [0027]<br>
The main frame 40 has a gusset 43 welded between the front end and the head pipe 5; stays 44, 45; and an engine hanger 46 for supporting the engine.<br>
The seat rail 10 has a stay 47 for supporting the fuel tank at its front side and a stay 48 for supporting the grab rail at its rear end.<br>
The center frame 41 has a pivot pipe 41a through which a pivot shaft (not shown) for attachment of the front end of the seat rail 10 is to be passed.<br>
An engine hanger 49 and so on are provided at the lower end of the rear frame 42. [0028]<br><br>
Fig. 3 shows brackets and the like (not shown in Fig. 2) provided on the front part of the head pipe 5 where a stay 50 protruding obliquely upward and forward is provided on the front lower part of the head pipe 5 and a vertical stay 51 tilting obliquely upward and forward is supported on its front end.<br>
The upper end of the stay 51 supports the central part of an aiming shaft 52 as an angle adjusting shaft located horizontally in the vehicle width direction (left-right or transverse direction) where both the ends extend left and right with a bracket 53 attached to each tip.  54 represents a nut for fitting the headlight which is located along an extension of the aiming shaft 52.  55 represents a nut for fitting a front winker. [0029]<br>
A stay 55 extending forward and obliquely downward is provided on the front lower part of the stay 51 with its lower end supporting the lower part of the headlight in a longitudinally adjustable manner.  The middle part of a supporting wire 57 is supported on the lower end of the stay 51.  The supporting wire 57 extends left and right and each of its ends curves obliquely downward and backward with a bracket 58 at its tip.  The bracket 58 has a through hole 58a on which the front end of the side cowl is supported in a vibration-proof manner. [0030]<br>
Next, the structure of the vicinity of the headlight will be described.  Fig. 4 is an enlarged side view of the<br><br>
vicinity of the headlight, Fig. 5 is a front view thereof. Fig. 6 is a plan view thereof, and Fig. 7 is an exploded view including side views of components.  In these figures, the screen 27 is placed along and on the upper edge of the headlight 25 and the headlight cover 30 lies over the back of the screen 27 and the top of the back of the headlight 25. [0031]<br>
The headlight cover 30 is a cover located behind the screen 27 and the headlight 25 and has a back extension 60 which covers the gap between the screen 27 and headlight 25, and the upper cowl 33 behind them.<br>
The back extension 60 has a ceiling part 62 and side walls 63 which integrally extend long backward from a front part 61 with part of the rear end of the back extension 60 inserted inside the front part of the upper cowl 33.  The front part 61 of the headlight cover 30 is fitted to the back sides of the screen 27 and headlight 25. [0032]<br>
Projections 64, 64a integrally extending backward are provided on the top of the back of the headlight 25 and the projection 64a is coupled with the side wall 63 of the back extension 60 and the projection 64 is fitted to the aiming shaft 52 by putting it on a boss 54 of the bracket 53 and fastening with a bolt 54a (Fig. 7).<br>
The projections 64a and 64 are formed integrally but at different heights along the vehicle width direction so that they are vertically arranged as a one-piece rib-like<br><br>
member.<br>
The aiming shaft 52 is located inside the back extension 60 with its left and right sides surrounded by the upper cowl 33 and its top covered by the ceiling part 62 so that it is invisible to the rider.<br>
A backward extending rib 65 which extends backward is located on the bottom of the back of the headlight 25 with its rear part inserted inside the front part of the front winker 26. [0033]<br>
The upper cowl 33 is equivalent to the front body cover in the present invention; and the lower edge of its arm part 33a lies over the upper edge 26a of the front winker 26 and the arm part 33a's front end part 33b located near the back of the headlight 25 is detachably attached through its boss with a bolt 66 over the outside of a fitting projection 67 formed integrally with the front winker 26 and by removing the bolt 66 and unscrewing other parts, only the upper cowl 33 can be removed (Fig. 7).  The fitting projection 67, protruding upward from the upper edge of the front winker 26, is fitted to the nut 55 (Fig. 3) of the bracket 53 with a bolt 55a (Fig. 7). [0034]<br>
As apparent from Fig. 4, the gap between the back of the headlight 25 and the front parts of the upper cowl 33 and front winker 26 is closed by the headlight cover 30 and backward extending rib 65 and a rear housing 68 protruding toward the back of the headlight 25 as viewed sideways so<br><br>
that there is no visible gap as viewed sideways.  The rear housing 68 protrudes backward so that it overlaps the inside of the fitting projection 67.<br>
As shown in the enlarged sectional view of Fig. 4, the upper cowl 33 is open forward through a front opening 77 rimmed with a front edge 33d and the rear side of the ceiling part 62 constituting the back extension 60 extends through the front opening 77 into the inside of the upper cowl 33 and the rear end 62a of the ceiling part 62 is located more backward than the front edge 33d.<br>
Also, the ceiling part 62 extends obliquely upward in front of the front opening 77, closing the front opening 77 as viewed frontally. [0035]<br>
As shown in Fig. 5, the headlight cover 30 is larger than the front opening 77 of the upper cowl 33 as viewed frontally and the gap in the joint between the headlight cover 30 and the upper cowl 33 is invisible.  Particularly, regarding the transverse width of the headlight cover 30, it stretches left and right so that it is larger than the front opening of the upper cowl 33 as viewed frontally. Consequently, the joint between the headlight cover 30 and the upper cowl 33 is invisible as viewed frontally and the appearance is thus improved.  In addition, this prevents entry of foreign matter, dust or the like through the joint during running. [0036]<br>
The front opening 77 is surrounded by the front edge<br><br>
33d of the upper cowl 33 and the line indicating the contour of the front opening 77 follows the front edge 33d, going from a point designated by reference numeral 33d in the upper part of the figure through points designated by reference symbols A, B, C and D down to the front end part 33b.  The top of the front opening 77 is in a higher position than the rear end of the ceiling part 62 of the headlight cover 30 and transversely it is almost as wide as the headlight 25 with its left and right ends located outside the side walls 63.   Due to the presence of the front opening 77, which is widely open forward as described above, the back extension 60 of the headlight cover 30 can be housed inside the upper cowl 33 and with it thus housed, the headlight cover 30 can oscillate longitudinally during aiming adjustment. [0037]<br>
The headlight 25 is virtually V-shaped as viewed frontally and is of the two-lamp type and the virtually V-shaped lower end 69 of the screen 27 lies over a bump part 25a formed on the upper end edge of the headlight 25 from outside.<br>
Visor covers 70, which are plastic decorative members approximately parallel in the vertical direction, lie over the left and right sides of the screen 27 surface and are fastened with screws 71 screwed into the lower ends of the visor covers 70 from ahead, together with the screen 27 and visor stay 72 (Fig. 4) .  The upper parts of the visor covers 70 are fixed from the back of the screen 27 with<br><br>
screws 71 (Fig. 7). [0038]<br>
The headlight 25 has a pair of left and right bulbs 73 on the left and right.  The front winkers 26 are located on the left and right of the headlight 25 where their upper parts come inside the left and right sides of the headlight 25 and position lamps 74 and winker lamps 75 are vertically arranged and these are located outward left and right of the headlight 25 as viewed frontally and are visible. [0039]<br>
The front ends 2 6b of the front winker 26 are located almost in the center of the vehicle width at the lower part of the headlight 25 and there is space between the left and right front ends 2 6b with the center of the lower part of the headlight 25 protruding downward in this space.<br>
The arm parts 33a extending forward on the left and right of the upper cowl 33 stretch along the left and right edges of the screen 27 and headlight 25 above the front winkers 26 with their front ends inserted inside the headlight 25. [0040]<br>
In Fig. 6, the upper cowl 33 can be split into left and right parts and the left and right parts are joined along vehicle body centerline CL and integrally connected at two (front and rear) points with a fastener 76a and a screw 76b.  Its upper surface including the joint forms a virtually flat part 33c.  The front edge 33d of the virtually flat part 33c, in combination with the left and<br><br>
right arm parts 33a, forms a large front opening 77.  The width of the front opening 77 is large enough to embrace the back extension 60 of the headlight cover 30.  The rear end of the ceiling part 62 stretches under the virtually flat part 33c, as wide as the width of the front edge 33d and rear end 62a.<br>
Therefore, the gap between the screen 27 and the front edge 33d of the upper cowl 33 is closed by the ceiling part 62 as viewed from above.  Also, part of the side wall 63 forms a side wall rear part 63a protruding outward from the front part 61 and covers the front opening 77. [0041]<br>
Fig. 8 is a side sectional view which schematically shows the aiming adjusting mechanism of the headlight 25. The headlight unit 31 is turnably supported on the head pipe 5 side by the aiming shaft 52, and a guide plate (described later) at the bottom of the headlight unit 31 is located in a way to be longitudinally adjustable with respect to the lower end of the stay 56 with an adjust bolt 79 (Fig. 7), so that by tightening the adjust bolt 79, the position of the headlight unit 31 is fixed and the optical axis angle is fixed.<br>
Conversely, by loosening the adjust bolt 79, the guide plate can be freely moved longitudinally with respect to the stay 56, so the optical axis of the headlight unit 31 can be freely turned on the aiming shaft 52 vertically and the optical axis angle can be freely adjusted.<br><br>
[0042]<br>
Imaginary line A in the figure indicates a condition that the headlight unit 31 is in its most upright position or the optical axis angle (elevation angle with respect to the horizontal line) is the minimum.  The solid line indicates its standard position corresponding to an optical axis angle in a finished vehicle which complies with law. Imaginary line B indicates a condition that the headlight unit 31 is most tilted backward or the optical axis angle is the maximum.<br>
The optical axis of the headlight unit 31 can be adjusted in the range from imaginary line A to B by the aiming adjusting mechanism.  An optical axis adjustment can be easily made by operating the adjust bolt 79 with a hand inserted through the space under the headlight 25 between the left and right front winkers 26. [0043]<br>
Furthermore, as indicated by the turning trajectory of contour line C of the back of the headlight unit 31 as viewed sideways during aiming adjustment (CO corresponds to standard position, CI corresponds to A or minimum angle, C2 corresponds to B or maximum angle), the contour line C overlaps contour line D of the front ends of the upper cowl 33 and front winkers 26, fixed on the vehicle body and immovable, as viewed sideways and the contour line C of the back of the headlight unit 31 as viewed sideways never goes forward beyond the contour line D during aiming adjustment; therefore, there is no possibility of a gap being formed<br><br>
between the back of the headlight unit 31 and the contour line D and no visible gap is formed on the back of the headlight unit 31 during aiming adjustment as viewed sideways, permitting maintenance of a good appearance.  The elements which constitute the contour line C as viewed sideways are the back side parts of the headlight cover 30 and headlight 25; in particular the ceiling part 62 and the backward extending rib 65 largely influence the upper portion and lower portion respectively. [0044]<br>
Fig. 9 is a sectional view taken along the line 9-9 in Fig. 4.  Projections 64a protruding backward are integrally formed on the left and right sides of the headlight 25 and the rear parts of the side walls 63 of the headlight cover 30 lie over the outside of the rear ends and integrally connected with tapping screws 80 from outside.  The side walls 63 are each located between the headlight 25 and the arm part 33a, closing the gap between the headlight 25 and the arm part 33a. [0045]<br>
Fig. 10 is a sectional view taken along the line 10-10 in Fig. 4.  Projections 64 protruding backward 64 are integrally formed on the left and right sides of the back of the headlight 25 with their rear ends turnably fitted to both axial ends of the aiming shaft 52 with bolts 54a.  The bolts 54a are concentric with the aiming shaft 52 and the headlight 25 can freely turn around the bosses 54 with respect to the axial center line of the aiming shaft 52.<br><br>
The gap between the headlight 25 and the front winker 26 in the axial direction of the aiming shaft 52 is closed by the arm part 33a.  The position of the arm part 33a is determined by putting it on the step part 26c of the front winker 2 6. [0046]<br>
The front end of the stay 56, extending downward (forward in the figure) from the aiming shaft 52, is coupled with a guide plate 78 provided in the rear housing 68.<br>
Reference numeral 81 in the figure represents a mounting seat for the headlight cover 30 and visor stay 72 and a concavo-convex part is provided ahead of the mounting seats 81 in the center so that the inwardly curved fitting end (not shown) formed on the central lowest end of- the screen 27 is inserted and fitted in it. [0047]<br>
Fig. 11 is a sectional view taken along the line 11-11 in Fig. 4, where the backward extending rib 65, extending backward from the bottom of the headlight 25, stretches to a more backward position than the line E connecting the left and right upper edges 26a, closing the gap between the headlight 25 and the upper edge 26a of the front winker 26 as viewed sideways.  The backward extending rib 65, integrally formed with the rear housing 68 of the headlight 25, extends backward and expands in the vehicle width direction, a groove 82 is formed along the vehicle centerline CL and the guide plate 78 is placed on the<br><br>
groove 82.  The groove 82 enables longitudinal movement of the headlight 25 during optical axis adjustment as seen in the figure. [0048]<br>
As shown in Fig, 12, a sectional view taken along the line 12-12 in Fig. 11, the guide plate 78's vertical wall part 78a at its front end is fitted to the headlight 25 with a screw 78b and a part stretching backward with a radius from the vertical wall part 78a constitutes a guide part 78c where a guide groove 78d in the form of a long groove is formed in the direction of the vehicle center line CL (Fig. 10). [0049]<br>
On the other hand, the lower end of the stay 56 forms a receiving part 56a which bends and extends forward and a through hole 56b and a weld nut 83 are concentrically provided here.  This receiving part 56a is placed over the guide part 78c and fastened with the weld nut 83 by passing the adjust bolt 79 through the guide groove 7Bd and through hole 56b from under, so the guide plate 78 is coupled with the receiving part 56a in a longitudinally adjustable or movable manner. [0050]<br>
Fig. 13 is a front view of the headlight 25, Fig. 14 is a plan view of it, and Fig. 15 is a sectional view taken along the line 15-15 in Fig. i4.  In these figures, the rear housing 68 is integrally formed with a housing peripheral part 68a and the periphery of a lens 68b is<br><br>
fitted to the housing peripheral part 68a (Fig. 15). [0051]<br>
As apparent from Fig. 14, the backward extending rib 65 is formed on the lower part of the back of the housing peripheral part 68a as curved in the shape of a downward convex and open upward and the aiming adjusting mechanism is located inside and above the backward extending rib 65 in a way to shut out mud, water or the like from under or obliquely from under.<br>
Bosses 84 are formed above the backward extending rib' 65 and on the step part at the central lower part of the back of the headlight 25 and the vertical wall 78a of the guide plate 78 is screwed thereon.  The left and right ends of the backward extending rib 65 are high enough to reach the vicinity of a socket 85 of the rear housing 68. [0052]<br>
Fig. 16 is a front view of the headlight cover 30 combined with the visor stays 72.  The headlight cover 30 has horn-like front parts 61 protruding left and right upward with a notch 61a made in the bottom of each front part 61.<br>
A support plate 86 for the visor stay 72 lies inside this notch 61a.  The support plate 86 is a vertically long plate member inserted in the notch 61a with cylindrical nuts 87, protruding forward, fixed on its top and bottom. A through hole 61b is made in the upper part of each front part 61. [0053]<br><br>
The front parts 61 contact and support the screen; the front parts 61 are screwed by placing the back of the screen over them and tightening screws 71 (Fig. 17) from the front side of the screen through the nuts 87.  The upper one of the upper and lower screws 71 is tightened with rubber inserted for vibration absorption.  The screen is screwed by inserting tapping screws from behind through the through holes 61b provided in the upper ends of the front parts 61 (see Fig. 7). [0054]<br>
As apparent from Fig. 16, a bottom part 30a, continuous with the left and right side walls 63, is provided inside the left and right front parts 61 and this bottom part 30a is a virtually flat part tilting down forward in a stepwise pattern with a boss 30b formed on its tip.  A tip edge 30c, located more forward than the boss 30b, has a convexo-concave shape and is to be engaged with the center bottom of the screen.<br>
The rear of the bottom part 30a is continuous with a back wall 30d and the space between the left and right side walls 63 is closed by the back wall 30d.  The top of the back wall 30d is continuous with the ceiling part 62.<br>
The ceiling part 62, extending backward, has a virtually wavy rear end and its left and right sides constitute side wall rear parts 63a protruding outside of the front parts 61, [0055]<br>
The visor stay 72 includes an oblique arm part 88a, a<br><br>
horizontal arm part 88b, and a stay 89, and the left and right support plates 86 are supported by the top parts of the left and right oblique arm parts 88a expanding upward, and the lower end of each oblique arm part 88a is coupled with the horizontal arm 88b placed horizontally in the vehicle width direction.  The rear end of the stay 89 is welded to the center of the lower part of the horizontal arm part 88b.<br>
Since the support plate 86 faces the notch 61a, the front end face of the nut 87 can be approximately flush with front part 61 but the horizontal arm part 88b can be placed under the bottom part 30a with the oblique arm part 88a inside the notch 61a. [0056]<br>
Fig. 17 shows the positional relation between the visor stay 72 and the headlight cover 30 as viewed sideways The horizontal arm part 88b stretches curving forward and the stay 89 provided on its bottom stretches further forward and its tip 89a, bending upward in a stepwise pattern, is in contact with the lower face of the bottom part 30a, causing the boss 30b and the nut 8 9b to coincide with each other.<br>
By putting the nut 89b on the mounting seat 81 (Fig. 10) together with the bottom part 30a to bring the nut 89b to the mounting seat 81 and tightening the bolt from above the boss 30b, the bolt, having passed through the boss 30b and the mounting seat 81, is fastened to the nut 89b, so that three members, the headlight cover 30, headlight 25<br><br>
and visor stay 72, can be fastened together without any nut<br>
on the mounting seat 81 and boss 30b.<br>
[0057]<br>
Fig. 18 is a front view of the upper cowl 33 where the upper cowl 33 forms a large opening 77 which is surrounded by the left and right arm parts 33a and the virtually flat parts 33b on its top and left and right sides and is open downward and forward/backward.  The upper cowl 33 is connected at the joint 90 along the vehicle body center CL with the screws 76 (Fig. 6).  95 represents the point of connection. [0058]<br>
Fig. 19 is a view illustrating the connection structure of the left and right virtually flat parts 33b; a depressed step part 92 is formed on one of the virtually flat parts 33b along a joint edge 91 and a seat 93 is formed there.<br>
The seat 93, which is depressed from the surface like the step part 92, includes a through hole 93a and a ring part around it. [0059]<br>
The joint edge 94 of the other virtually flat part 33b has a thin bottom so that when it lies over the step part 92, it is flush with the virtually flat part 33b on the step part 92 side and a connection 95 to engage with the seat 93 is formed and a through hole 95a is formed there.<br>
The through hole 95a is concentric with the through<br><br>
hole 93a and has a smaller diameter than it; a screw 76 is passed through it for connection.  As indicated by screws 76 in Fig. 6, there are two connections 95, a front one and a rear one, where the rear connection is fastened to the center cover 36 with the screw 76 together. [0060]<br>
Therefore, by removing the front and rear screws 76 passed through the through holes 95a and removing the bolts 66 fixing the front ends of the arm parts 33a on the fitting projections 67 of the front winkers 26, the left and right virtually flat parts 33b can be removed separately, so the upper cowl 33 can be independently attached or detached without affecting the front winkers 26, headlight cover 30 and so on.  Maintenance of the aiming shaft 52 and maintenance of the front winkers 26 can be done.  Particularly, regarding the front winkers 26, bulb replacement can be easily done since the bulb is horizontally installed and designed to be attached or detached from inside the vehicle body. [0061]<br>
Next, how this embodiment functions will be explained. In order to make an optical axis adjustment of the headlight 25, as shown in Fig. 8, the adjust bolt 79 is loosened from under the headlight 25 and the headlight 25 is vertically turned on the aiming shaft 52; when a prescribed optical axis angle is reached, the headlight 25 is fixed by tightening the adjust bolt 79 to finish the optical axis adjustment.<br><br>
[UUbZJ<br>
At this time, when the headlight 25 turns, the whole headlight unit 31 also turns; however, part of the front of the upper cowl 33 is open and constitutes a front opening 77 and the back extension 60 on the top of the back of the headlight cover 30 is inserted through this open space into the upper cowl 33, so the back extension 60 of the headlight cover 30 and the upper cowl 33 overlap as the vehicle is viewed sideways.<br>
[0063]<br>
Therefore, when an angle adjustment is made for optical axis adjustment of the headlight 25, the headlight cover 30 and the upper cowl 33 constituting a front body cover always overlap in the angle adjustment range, which prevents formation of a visible gap between the headlight unit 31 and the upper cowl 33 as viewed sideways.<br>
Furthermore, since the upper cowl 33 is open on its front side, interference between the headlight unit 31 and the upper cowl 33 is prevented while a wide angle adjustment range of the headlight 25 is assured.<br>
[0064]<br>
Since the ceiling part 62 of the back extension 60 covers the top of the aiming shaft 52, the gap and the headlight back are invisible to the rider and the appearance is improved.  Besides, in rainy weather, rain water from above is prevented from reaching the back of the headlight.<br>
[0065]<br><br>
Also as shown in Fig. 5, since the gap in the joint between the headlight unit 31 and the upper cowl 33 is invisible as viewed frontally, the appearance is improved. In addition, during a run, entry of foreign matter, dust or the like through the joint is prevented.<br>
[0066]<br>
Furthermore, since the upper cowl 33 can be split into left and right parts as shown in Figs. 18 and 19, maintenance of the aiming shaft 52 and surrounding parts can be easily done simply by removing the upper cowl 33 as shown in Fig. 4.  In addition, since the aiming shaft 52 is located inside the upper cowl 33, entry of foreign matter, dust or the like from outside is prevented.<br>
[0067]<br>
Also, the backward extending rib 65 is provided to close the space between the lower part of the headlight 25 and the front part of the front winker 26 behind it, which prevents formation of a gap between the area under the headlight 25 and the vehicle body side including the front winker 26 during angle adjustment and improves the appearance as the vehicle is viewed sideways.  Furthermore, the backward extending rib 65 covers the area under the headlight 25, which protects the headlight 25 from dust or foreign matter coming from the tire.<br>
[0068]<br>
In addition, since the back extension 60 is integrally provided on the top of the back of the headlight cover 30, the back extension 60 can be formed separately<br><br>
from the headlight 25, increasing the degree of freedom in forming the back extension 60.<br>
Also, since the backward extending rib 65 is integrally formed on the bottom of the back of the headlight 25, the backward extending rib 65 can be easily formed and there is no need to form a separate member and the number of components is thus decreased. [0069]<br>
The present invention is not limited to the above embodiments but can be modified or applied in various ways within the principle of the invention.  For example, it is not always necessary that the headlight cover 30 is separate from the headlight 25, but the headlight cover 30 may be integrally formed as part of the rear housing 68 of the housing of the headlight 25.  In this case, the back extension 60 protrudes backward integrally with the headlight 25.<br>
Alternatively the backward extending rib 65 may not be formed integrally with the bottom of the back of the headlight 25; instead, another member, for example, part of the headlight cover 30 extends downward.<br>
Furthermore, the front vehicle cover housing the back extension 60 is not limited to the upper cowl 33 but it may be the front winker 26, side cowl 34 or the like depending on the vehicle structure.
