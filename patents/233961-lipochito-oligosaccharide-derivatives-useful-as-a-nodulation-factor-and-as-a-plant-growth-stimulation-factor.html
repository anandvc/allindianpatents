				<td>Synthetic compounds useful as Modulation agents of leguminous plants and preparation<br>
processes thereof<br>
I. DESCRIPTION<br>
The present invention relates to synthetic compounds that are active on plants, especially as legume nodulation factors, and also as plant growth stimulators, and to methods for preparing such compounds.<br>
It is known that the process of nitrogen fixing by legumes is based on symbiosis between these plants and soil bacteria, the Rhizobia. The Rhizobium-legume symbiosis produces each year, by means of the root nodules, more ammonium than all of the nitrogen fertilizer industry. This symbiosis thus plays a considerable agronomic role. Legumes are very rich in proteins and produce about one third of the plant proteins consumed worldwide, by virtue of pulses such as soybean, pea, horse bean, groundnut, bean and lupin, and forage plants such as alfalfa and clover.<br>
The formation of nitrogen-fixing nodules starts with an exchange of molecular signals, flavonoids secreted by the plant and nodulation factors {Nod factors) synthesized by the bacterium. These factors consist of an oligosaccharide fragment and a lipid chain attached to this skeleton on the non-reducing end. They have structural attributes (substitutions on the sugars at the two ends and variability of the chain) that make them specific to the legume-bacterium couple . (Figure Removed)<br><br>
These lipochito-oligosaccharides (LCO) may be either isolated directly from a particular culture of rhizobia, synthesized chemically, or obtained chemo-enzymatically. Via the latter method, the oligosaccharide skeleton may be formed by culturing of recombinant Escherichia coli bacterial strains in a fermenter, and the lipid chain may then be attached chemically.<br>
Treatment of the seeds of legumes, for instance soybean, with Nod factors at very low concentrations, may result in a large increase in the number of nitrogen-fixing root nodules and a significant increase in the yields, under agronomic conditions. It is thus clear that, in the future, compounds of Nod factor type will be produced industrially for large-scale agronomic use. However, the industrial preparation and conditioning of natural Nod factors presents two<br><br>
types of drawback: (1) the natural Nod factors are difficult to assay via simple methods such as spectrometric methods; (2) they are unstable in the presence of plants or in soils, in particular because they have a -CO-NH- bond that may be broken by plant or microbial enzymes present in the rhizosphere.<br>
One of the aspects of the present invention is to propose a process for preparing compounds of Nod factor type, some of these compounds constituting another aspect of the invention. Specifically, certain biologically active compounds show strong absorption in the ultraviolet range, which makes them easy to assay during their industrial preparation and allows them to be detected and assayed easily in the product intended for marketing, and allows their stability and storage in such products to be tested. In addition, some of these synthesized compounds show higher stability than the natural Nod factors.<br>
The compounds described may be used to treat plants or plant parts. The term "plants" means wild plants and also crop plants (including future crop plants). The crop plants may be derived either from conventional variety-selection methods, from genetic engineering methods, or from a combination of these two methods. The term "plant parts" means all the aerial or subterranean plant parts or organs, such as flowering-plant seed, root, tuber, rhizome, germ, stalk, leaf and flower. Also included in the category of plant parts are the harvest products and also the reproductive vegetative or germinative material, such as rhizome, tuber, seed, bud or graft.<br>
The compounds described may be used to treat plants or plant parts directly or via the action of their environment or of their culture or storage medium. The usual treatment methods are, for example, dipping, vaporization, evaporation, spraying, spread and application, and for the reproductive material, in particular for the seeds, simple or multilayer coating.<br>
In the case of treating the reproductive material, especially seeds, the compounds described may be applied alone or in combination with other active molecules such as fungicides, insecticides, acaricides, nematicides, growth regulators and herbicides. The compounds described and their combinations with active molecules belonging to the abovementioned families may be applied directly or using a suitable formulation. This formulation may be diluted or film-forming agents may be added thereto before use. The use may take place at any of the steps of handling of the seeds between harvesting and sowing, including during self-seeding. Suitable formulations and processes for treating seeds are known to those skilled in the art and are described, inter alia, in the following documents: US 4,272,417 A, US 4,245,432 A, US 4,808,430 A, US 5,876,739 A, US 2003/0176428 A1, WO 2002/080675 A1, WO 2002/028186 A2.<br>
The formulations usually used may be solutions, emulsions, suspensions, powders, spraying powders, pastes, soluble pastes, gels, granules, concentrated suspo-emulsions, natural or<br><br>
synthetic impregnated materials, and also microencapsulation using polymers. These formulations are commonly prepared, for example, by mixing the compounds described and/or combinations thereof with other active molecules with solid or liquid formulation supports, using, where appropriate, emulsifying and/or dispersing and/or foaming surfactants. They may also contain a dye such as mineral pigments.<br>
The target Nod factor is especially the factor associated with alfalfa (1) as described above. Among all the existing legumes, alfalfa and vetch have been the subject of numerous studies. By virtue of several activity tests performed with various Nod factor analogs, it has been possible to establish a relationship between the structure of the LCD and the plant response. The isolated nodulation factor that is most active on alfalfa is a tetramer sulfated in position 6 of the reducing sugar, acetylated in position 6 of the sugar located at the nonreducing end and acylated with a chain of 16 carbons containing two unsaturations (C16:2A2E,9Z) (1)                  (Figure Removed)It has been shown that the absence of acetate, the addition of a glucosamine unit, or the loss of one of the two unsaturations produce only a moderate reduction in activity. A test of variation of the chain length revealed maximum activity for a chain of 16 carbons. Finally, the sulfate is of prime importance for recognition of the Nod factor by alfalfa, but, on the other hand, its absence is necessary for action in vetch.<br>
Studies have shown that the conjugated unsaturation present at 2 of the lipid chain was important for nodulation, since an analog acylated with a C16:1A92 chain is less active (by just<br>
under a factor of 10).<br>
From these results, a series of analogs for which the conjugated amide bond is mimicked by a<br>
benzamidS bond have been prepared. These compounds constitute one of the aspects of the<br>
present invention. Another series of analogs containing a function of benzylamine type<br>
constitute another aspect of the invention.<br>
Such compounds are capable of causing or promoting the phenomenon of nodulation in<br>
legumes and of stimulating plant growth and development.<br>
The compounds that are plant nodulation factors according to the invention are preferably<br>

It is known that a chitin oligomer not containing a lipid chain is not active, and that the degradation of the Nod factors by breaking the amide bond in the rhizosphere thus leads to a loss of activity.<br>
In order to limit, or even prevent, this degradation, a series of analogous compounds, some of which are more stable than the natural Nod factors, was prepared.<br>
11-1. STRUCTURE OF COMPOUNDS ACCORDING TO THE INVENTION<br>
Compounds containing a meta-substituted benzamide group were prepared. It is preferred to keep identical the total number of atoms along the chain (16) and also the unsaturation of cis type in position 9. In practice, for the production of the starting materials, the lipid chain may be linked to the aromatic ring via an oxygen atom. (Figure Removed)<br>
(Figure Removed) R8 = H	    3<br>
nd also an N-acetylated analog 5, which makes it possible to regain the overall charge of the natural product, were also synthesized. These analogs were prepared in the sulfated series.(Figure Removed)Two other sulfated analogs, one containing a fully saturated chain and the other an unsaturated chain of alkyne type, make it possible to study the effect of the unsaturation of Z type in position 9 present on the natural product.Finally, two sulfated analogs, the substitution on the aromatic ring of which is in the ortho position for one and in the para position for the other, make it possible to study the effect of the unsaturation of trans type located in position 2 on the natural product.(Figure Removed)Finally, an analog, derived from a fucosyl pentamer, bearing a meta substitution on the chain, was prepared.(Figure Removed) <br><br>
The references for the biological tests are the following compounds: (Figure Removed) <br>
11-2. SYNTHESIS OF THE VARIOUS AROMATIC CHAINS<br>
For the benzamide LCOs, the coupling with the amino tetramer is performed with a benzoyl chloride (acylation) and for the benzyl LCOs, with a benzaldehyde (reductive alkylation).<br>
11-2.1. Synthesis of aromatic chains meta-substituted with the undec-4Z-enyloxy chain<br>
According to the reaction scheme below, the methyl ester 15 is prepared, from which reduction to the aldehyde or saponification to the acid (acyl chloride precursor) may be envisaged.<br>
To do this, 1-iodoundec~4Z-ene 13 is used to alkylate methyl 3-hydroxybenzoate. The ester 15 is isolated in a yield of 76%.<br>
(Figure Removed)   Conversion of the ester to the aldehyde 17 is performed in two steps.<br>
(Figure Removed) Moreover, the acyl chloride 19 is obtained by saponification of the ester 15 followed by reaction with oxalyl chloride.<br>
-2.2. Synthesis of aromatic chains meta-substituted with undecanyloxy and undec-4-ynyloxy chains<br>
The same procedure with 1-bromoundecane or 1-iodoundec-4-yne in anhydrous DMF, followed by saponification and formation of the chloride, lead to the acid chlorides 23 and 27.<br>
(Figure Removed) <br>
II-2.3. Synthesis of aromatic chains ortho- or para-substituted with the undec-4Z-enyloxy chain The acid chlorides 31 and 35 are similarly prepared from 29 and 33, which are obtained as previously by Williamson coupling of 1-iodoundec-4Z-ene 13 with methyl 2-hydroxybenzoate 28 (or methyl salicylate) in a yield of 66%, and with methyl 4-hydroxybenzoate 32 in a yield of 79%.<br><br><br>
The saponifications and conversions to chloride are quantitative in both cases.<br>
11-3. N-acylation of the sulfated tetramer CO-IV(NH2. S) with the various benzoyl chlorides( Figure Removed)<br>
-3.1. Coupling with 3-(undec-4Z-enyloxy)benzoyl chloride 1933(Figure Removed) The coupling may be performed by dissolving the starting material in a DMF-water mixture in the presence of sodium hydrogen carbonate. Under these conditions, only the free amine is acylated. With 6 equivalents of chloride and after reaction for 18 hours, a conversion of about 6.0% is achieved, but the reaction is highly selective. 33% of desired product 3 are thus isolated. The purity of the product is checked by HPLC.<br>
The ultraviolet (UV) absorption spectrum of product 3 is substantially different from that of the reference compound 12, especially due to the presence in 3 of an absorption peak at 289 nm. Such a peak, due to the benzamide group, does not exist for compound 12. This perfectly illustrates the UV properties of some of the compounds according to the invention making them easy to assay, in contrast with the natural Nod factors.<br>
In contrast with compound 12, compound 3 also has a characteristic fluorescence at 345 nm when it is excited at 289 nm.<br>
11-3.2. Coupling with 3-(undecanyloxy)benzoyl chloride 23 and 3-(undec-4-ynyloxy)benzoyl chloride 27<br>
The same procedure as for the preceding derivative is repeated, i.e. dissolution in a DMF-water mixture and use of several equivalents of chloride. Under these conditions, the saturated analog 6 is obtained in a yield of 32% (and 47% conversion) and the analog containing a triple bond 7 in a yield of 31% (and 70% conversion). The purity is also checked by HPLC.<br>
II-3.3. Coupling with 2-(undec-4Z-enyloxy)benzoyl chloride 31 and 4-(undec-4Z-enyloxy)benzoyl chloride 35<br>
For these two analogs, by adopting a similar protocol, a yield of 48% is obtained for the ortho-substituted derivative 8 and a yield of 40% is obtained for the para-substituted derivative 9. For the two reactions, 4 equivalents of chloride were used. The purity is also checked by HPLC.<br>

II-7. ACTIVITY TESTS<br>
11-7.1 Activity tests on temperate legumes of the Galegoid group<br>
Temperate legumes of the Galegoid group are nodulated by rhizobia that produce Nod factors with the hydrophobic chain having a double bond conjugated to the carbonyl group. This group includes important legume crops such as alfalfa, pea, broad bean, chickpea and clover.<br>
The sulfated products are tested on alfalfa for induction of the formation of root nodules, and on the model legume Medicago truncatula for induction of the expression of a symbiotic gene coding for an early nodulin.<br>
11-7.1. 1 Nodulation tests on alfalfa<br>
Alfalfa plantlets are grown under axenic conditions in test tubes on a nitrogen-poor agar medium (Demont-Caulet et a!., Plant Physiol., 120, 83-92, 1999). Untreated plantlets serve as control. Natural Nod or synthetic LCO factors are added at the concentrations indicated.<br>
11-7.1.1.1 Results of nodulation tests<br>
The benzamide derivative 3 meta-substituted with the undec-4Z-enyloxy chain shows advantageous activity, the activity being similar to that of the sulfated tetramer 11. acylated with the reference C16:1A9Z chain. (Figure Removed)<br><br>
A: 11; B: 3; Control: no LCO<br>
The benzyl derivative 4 has moderate activity relative to the benzamide derivative 3.<br><br>
Number of nodules<br>
Control<br><br>
A: 11; B: 3; C: 4; Control: no LCO<br>
Finally, the N-acetylation of the benzyl derivative 4 leads to an improvement in the response, but the activity remains lower than that of the benzamide derivative 3.<br>
A.to 10'7M; B: 4 to 10'7M; C: 5 to 1CT7M; D: H to 1CT7M; E: H to 10'9M; Control: no LCO<br>
These results indicate the importance of the amide bond. The results obtained with these benzamide derivatives confirm the effect of the amide-double bond conjugation present on the natural compound.<br>
The benzamide 7 meta-substituted with the undec-4-ynyloxy chain shows activity comparable to that of the benzamide derivative 3, whereas the benzamide compound 6 substituted with the fully saturated chain shows slightly lower activity. These results indicate that an unsaturation in position 4 may lead to an increase in activity. A; B: 9; C: 8; D: 7; E: 6; Control: no LCO<br>
The tests relating to the benzamide derivatives 8 and 9 ortho- and para-substituted with the undec-4Z-enyloxy chain reveal analogs that are less active than the meta-substituted benzamide derivative 3. The meta substitution is thus preferred as mimic for an unsaturation of trans type.<br>
U-7,1.2. Tests of induction of early nodulin on Medicago truncatuta   •<br>
These tests are performed to determine whether the synthetic LCOs induce symbiotic responses by activation of the same signal transduction pathway as the natural Nod factors. The tests are performed on the model legume Medicago truncatufa. The activity of the sulfated benzamide derivative 3, meta-substituted with the undec-4Z-enyloxy chain, which is the most active synthetic compound in the nodulation test on alfalfa, is studied on "wild-type" plants and on a mutant in the gene DM11 which is altered in the transduction of the Nod factor signal (Catoira et al. Plant Cell, 12,1647-1665, 2000). The compound that serves as reference is the sulfated tetramer 12 acylated with the C16:2A2E,9Z chain, which is an analog of the natural Nod factor. The control is the plant cultivated in the absence of LCO.<br>
{1-7.1.2.1 Reporter gene<br>
It is generally difficult to determine the regulation of expression of a particular gene, during a biological process, since most of the specific products of these genes are not readily detectable<br><br>
or measurable. To overcome this problem, a technique of fusion with "reporter genes" is used, i.e. genes coding for a readily assayable protein. The fusion consists in combining the DNA sequence containing the gene regulatory regions that it is desired to study, with the DNA sequence of the reporter gene. The assembly is then reintroduced into the plant by transformation. Thus, if the target gene is expressed, the reporter gene is automatically expressed. It is then a matter of assaying the reporter gene protein.<br>
In order to avoid a negative interaction with the activity of the plant, reporter genes that do not<br>
code for any enzyme normally formed by the plants are used. One of the enzymes most<br>
commonly used is p-glucuronidase (GUS) from Escherichia coli, a hydrolase that catalyzes the<br>
cleavage of a large variety of p-glucuronides. As commercial substrate of this enzyme, it is<br>
possible to use:<br>
X-Gluc (Sigma B-4782): 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl glucuronide; the anion formed has a blue<br>
color.<br><br><br>
(Figure Removed) he genes for the legumes involved in modulation may be classified into two major types: early nodulin genes (ENOD), which are activated in the first days of the infection and activation of the nodulation process;<br>
late nodulin genes, which are not activated until several days after the application of the bacteria, and do not intervene until the period of maturation of the nodules.<br>
A new gene of Medicago truncatula, MtENODH, coding for an RPRP (Repetitive proline-rich protein), and transcribed during the first steps of infection of nodulation on the nodule roots and tissues was identified (Journet et al. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact., 14, 737-748, 2001). Using the transgenic Medicago truncatula plant expressing the fusion MtENOD11::GUSA, it is possible to determine whether a Nod factor analog added to the culture medium of the plant has induced transcription of the ENOD11 gene.<br>
For the ENOD11 transcription tests, a Fahraeus medium is used as for the modulation tests, but without agar. The seedlings are placed on paper in pockets containing the culture medium. The<br>
responses of two types of transgenic plants bearing the MtENOD11::GUS: fusion are compared: a "wild-type" (WT) Jemalong plant and a plant bearing a mutation in the DM11 gene, which is incapable of transducing the Nod factor signal. The plants are left to grow for 5 days and the plantlets are then treated with various concentrations of LCO. After 6 hours, the plantlets are removed and placed in aqueous medium containing X-Gluc for 1 to 2 hours. The number of roots giving a characteristic blue response is then counted.<br>
This test is relatively sensitive, to the extent that it is possible to work at LCO concentrations that are lower than those for the nodulation tests.(Figure Removed) A: 3; B: 12; Control: no LCO<br>
It is found that the benzamide derivative 3 is approximately 10 times less active than the reference compound, the acylated tetramer 12. Moreover, as for the reference compound 12, the benzamide derivative 3 does not induce any response in the plants bearing the DM11 mutation. It may thus be concluded that the synthetic compound of benzamide type activates the transcription of the ENOD11 gene via the same transduction pathway as that activated by the natural Nod factors.<br>
11-7.2 Activity tests on other legumes<br>
Sulfated benzamide derivatives have been shown to have similar biological activity on the roots of Medicago species than the major natural sulfated Sinorhizobium meliloti Nod factor which is N-acylated with a C16:2 chain. It has been hypothesized that the benzamide derivative is a good structural mimic of the natural S. meliloti Nod factors having an amide bond between the chitin oligomer backbone and the hydrophobic chain with a double bond conjugated to the carbonyl group. This type of alpha-beta conjugated double bond is characteristic of Nod factors from rhizobia that nodulate temperate legumes such as alfalfa, clover, pea, broad bean, chickpea, etc... In contrast, rhizobium that nodulate legumes of tropical origin such as soybean, peanut, bean, cowpea, etc... produce Nod factors in which the carbonyl group is not conjugated to a double bond. It was thus important to determine whether a benzamide analog of a natural Nod factor with no conjugated double bond would also exhibit biological activity on the cognate legume.<br>
This question was addressed by using the Lotus corniculatus root hair deformation bioassay. Lotus corniculatus is a forage crop which is nodulated by rhizobia which produce Nod factors quite similar to those produced by rhizobia which nodulate soybean: the chitin oligomer backbone has five glucosamine residues, the N-acyl chain is essentially vaccenic acid (C18:1) and the reducing glucosamine residue is not sulfated and is O-substituted by a fucosyl residue. Lotus corniculatus was chosen as a model system because seeds and seedlings are small sized and convenient to handle.<br>
11-7.2.1 Root hair deformation assay on Lotus corniculatus<br>
Seeds of Lofus corniculatus (cv Rodeo) were sterilized. Germinated seeds with rootlets about 1 cm long were aseptically transferred onto Farhaeus soft agar plates. Plates were sealed with Parafilm and placed vertically for two days in a plant growth chamber (at 25°C, with a 16-hr light period, a relative humidity of 75%, OsramVFIuora L 77 as the type of light, and light intensity at the level of the top of the plates of 30uE.m-2.s-1) to allow plant growth and root hair development. Then 2 ml of a Nod factor derivative sterile solution was poured to cover the Lotus root system, and after 30mn, excess liquid was removed. A further incubation was performed for 16 hr in the plant growth chamber. The roots of the five plants were transferred between slide and cover slip and observed by bright field microscopy after staining by methylene blue.<br>
(Figure Removed) air deformation (Had) activity was estimated by a limit dilution method. Nod factor derivatives were applied at concentrations ranging from 10-7 M to 10-11 M. The activity of two DPS chitin derivatives were compared, the soybean Nod factor and its benzoylated analog 10. Both compounds were 0-fucosylated at the reducing end, but differed by the N-substitution on the terminal non-reducing glucosamine residue, either C18:1 N-acylated like the soybean Nod factor or N- benzoylated. Each compound was dissolved in water/ethanol 50/50 ; 0,01% Chaps was added at a concentration of 1mM. These stock solutions were then diluted in water. To estimate the plant response, a criterion of clear-cut hair branching was chosen (numerous branching at more than one site on the root system), and plants exhibiting these pronounced reactions were classified as « + ». The statistical significance (at the P = 0.05) of the proportion of « + » responses was calculated using the ratio comparisons based on the Fisher's « Exact» test (SAS software). Experiments were carried out twice. Data are given in the following Table:<br>
Table: Root hair deformation assay on Lotus corniculatus<br><br>
(Table Removed)  plants were used for each treatment and each dilution. Sixty six untreated control plants were used to estimate the intrinsic plant variability for the Hair deformation character. The responses were classified "+" when the proportion of Had+ was significantly higher (at the probability level P = 0.05) among the treated plants compared with the untreated control. Data were analysed using the Fisher's "Exact" test.<br>
These experiments show that the benzamide derivative 10 has a high activity on the Lotus corniculatus root hair bioassay, with a significant activity at nanomolar concentration. It may thus be concluded that benzamide derivatives could be used to stimulate symbiotic activity on legumes that are nodulated by rhizobia which produce Nod factors that have no alpha-beta conjugated double bonds on the acyl chain, such as soybean.<br>

The various fractions are passed through a Dowex 50x8-100 resin (H+), and then pooled and concentrated. The residue is successively washed with EtOAc (3 x 1mL) and then H2O (3 x tmL), and then redissolved in H2O/CH3CN (1/1,10 ml) by heating to 56°C, and then by sonication. The solution is then freeze-dried, and the expected product is obtained in the form of a white powder (2.5 mg, 28%).<br>
The starting material retained on the acid resin is then eluted (2.3 mg, 31%) using aqueous ammonia solution (H2O, 2%).<br>
