				<td>FLAVOURING COMPOSITION<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a flavouring composition and more particularly relates to<br>
a flavouring composition comprising dimethyl sulphide and a cellulose ether derivative.<br>
Background and Prior Art<br>
Frozen minced fish, which is commonly referred to as "frozen surimi", is typically<br>
produced by the process in which fish meat, such as pollack, is firstly minced, the minced<br>
fish is subjected to two or more washes with fresh water to remove undesirable fish<br>
odours, a small amount of common salt is added to the fresh water in the final wash step,<br>
the skin is removed where necessary, a screw-press is used to remove water from the<br>
product, sugars or sugar alcohols are mixed with the dried product and, finally, the<br>
product is packed and stored under refrigeration at - 20°C to - 40°C.<br>
One problem with this process is that the repeated washing steps remove not only<br>
undesirable flavours but also many of the desirable flavours. Therefore, replacement<br>
flavours must typically be added back into the surimi to achieve the desired flavour<br>
profile.<br>
Flavour compositions that can be used for adding back the desired flavour profile contain<br>
dimethyl sulphide (referred to herein as "DMS") as a major component because it delivers<br>
a desirable sulphury, vegetal, crab-like top note.<br>
However, DMS is a volatile component that evaporates undesirably quickly upon storage<br>
such that product containing it lose a significant part of the crab-like tope note.<br>
Additionally, DMS is often incompatible with various other ingredients used for adding<br>
back flavour into surimi products. This results in the presence of an undesirable film,<br>
comprising the DMS, which is visible on the surface of the flavour composition.<br>
One approach to stabilize DMS in surimi products is to generate an emulsion of the DMS,<br>
which is hydrophobic, with certain hydrophilic ingredients. However, emulsions are<br>
intrinsically unstable, especially upon storage over longer periods and/or at elevated<br>
temperatures and, once the emulsion separates, the known problems identified above can<br>
recur.<br>
Furthermore, emulsion manufacture is often an expensive and time-consuming process<br>
requiring harsh processing conditions, such as high pressure, high shear or both This is<br>
undesirable since the large amount of heat generated by such processing risks driving off<br>
the volatile DMS component.<br>
Thus, it is an objective of the present invention to address one or more of the<br>
abovementioned problems and/or to provide one or more consumer desirable benefits.<br>
We have now found that the addition of certain cellulose ether derivatives at the correct<br>
dosage can address one or more of these problems.<br>
The use of hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose has been described in "Surimi and Surimi<br>
Seafood", Second Edition by Jae W. Park, publisher: Food Science and Technology) as<br>
an ingredient which can improve the texture of surimi. However, this requires very high<br>
levels of the ingredient. In the present invention, much lower levels of the cellulose ether<br>
derivative are required in order to stabilise die flavouring composition comprising DMS.<br>
In US 5'958'502 (Fulger et al), there is described a process for incorporating a volatile<br>
component into a matrix. The volatile component can be any component having a low<br>
boiling point, such as DMS and the matrix can be selected from a large number of<br>
materials, including cellulose ether derivative. The product is a glassy carbohydrate<br>
matrix and there is no disclosure or suggestion of using DMS together with a specific<br>
cellulose ether derivative.<br>
In Pangborn R M et al., Journal of Texture Studies, vol. 4, No. 4, 1974, pages 467 to 482,<br>
table 1 on page 468 discloses a composition comprising, amongst other ingredients, DMS<br>
and hydroxpropylcellulose. The amount of DMS is at most 0.0006 g/lOOml water, which<br>
is far below the amount used according to the present invention.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a flavouring composition for a minced-Fish<br>
product comprising:<br>
(a) 0.1 to 30wt% of dimethyl sulphide, based on the total weight of the flavouring<br>
composition, and<br>
(b) a cellulose ether derivative,<br>
wherein the weight ratio of (a) to (b) is 8:1 or less and the cellulose ether derivative<br>
comprises at least 2.5ft by weight of hydroxyalkyl substituents.<br>
The invention further provides a minced-fish product comprising the flavouring<br>
composition.<br>
In a further aspect, the invention provides the use of a cellulose ether derivative in a<br>
flavouring composition comprising dimethyl sulphide to stabilise the composition.<br>
In yet another aspect, the invention provides a process for the preparation of a stable<br>
flavouring composition comprising the step of mixing:<br>
(a) from 0.1 to 30wt% based on the total weight of the flavouring composition of<br>
dimethyl sulphide together with<br>
(b) a cellulose ether derivative comprising at least 2.5% by weight of hydroxyalkyl<br>
substituents,<br>
wherein the weight ratio of (a) to (b) is 8:1 or less.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a flavouring composition comprising DMS.<br>
DMS is a flavouring ingredient of formula (CH2)2S that, together with other seafood<br>
flavouring ingredients, is used in minced-fish products to provide a characteristic sea-<br>
food aroma and taste.<br>
It is a volatile compound having a boiling point of 83oC and is effective at delivering the<br>
desired aroma in minced-fish products, even at very low levels. However, when present<br>
in amounts significantly above the threshold detection level, it is undesirably pungent.<br>
For this reason, it is vital that the amount of DMS does not exceed 30wt%, based on the<br>
total weight of the flavouring composition. Preferably, the amount of DMS is from 0.1 to<br>
15wt%, more preferably from 0.5 to 12wt%, most preferably from 1 to Swt% based on<br>
the total weight of the flavouring composition.<br>
Cellulose Ether Derivative<br>
The flavouring composition of the invention comprises a small quantity of a cellulose<br>
ether derivative. It has been found that this material stabilises the dimethyl sulphide in<br>
the composition in spite of the incompatibility of DMS with other flavouring components.<br>
It is believed that the DMS is typically unstable because of the aqueous environment of<br>
the flavour composition and that the cellulose ether derivative stabilises the DMS by<br>
encouraging emulsification to provide, in the dispersed phase, the DMS. The continuous<br>
phase is thus aqueous, typically comprising the water-soluble flavour components.<br>
Surprisingly, unlike other emulsion aids, the cellulose ether derivative achieves stability<br>
over a long period. For instance, lecithin can be used to form an emulsion of DMS but<br>
the emulsion is typically observed to coalesce after only 24 hours storage at 20°C.<br>
The cellulose ether derivative is preferably a hydroxy alkyl cellulose comprising one or<br>
more pendant alkyl groups.<br>
Preferred alkyl groups include CI to C5 more preferably C2 to C4 alkyl chains. The alkyl<br>
chain may be branched or unbranched.<br>
The percentage by weight of hydroxyalkyl substituent is preferably greater than 2.5, more<br>
preferably from 3 to 20, more preferably from 4 to 18, most preferably from 5 to 15%,<br>
e.g. from 7 to 12%.<br>
It has been found that where the amount of hydroxyalkyl substituent is below 2.5wt%, a<br>
less stable DMS emulsion is formed. For this reason, the cellulose ether derivative is not<br>
methyl cellulose since this material has been found not to provide the desired emulsion<br>
characteristics.<br>
It has been found through experimentation that hydroxyalkyl methyl cellulose is highly<br>
preferred since the DMS emulsions formed using this material are highly stable even<br>
upon long term storage at elevated temperatures. Most preferably, the alkyl group is a<br>
propyl moiety.<br>
Where the cellulose ether derivative is hydroxyalkyl methyl cellulose, the percentage by<br>
weight of methoxyl substituent is preferably greater than 25, more preferably it is from 25<br>
to 35, even more preferably from 26 to 34, most preferably from 28 to 30.<br>
The modified cellulose is preferably present in an amount of from 1 to 20wt% more<br>
preferably from 1 to 15wt%, most preferably from 1 to 7wt%, e.g. I to 4wt%, based on<br>
the total weight of the flavouring composition.<br>
Surprisingly, at these very low levels excellent retention of DMS is achieved.<br>
Advantageously, due to the high retention level upon storage achieved in this<br>
composition, the higher amounts of DMS conventionally required to compensate for the<br>
evaporation of the DMS during storage are no longer required. Moreover, such levels are<br>
found to deliver an overpowering sulphury note undesirable to consumers. Thus, the<br>
incorporation of a small amount of the cellulose ether derivative also enables a significant<br>
reduction in the amount of DMS required.<br>
In order to provide an excellent emulsion, the weight ratio of DMS to cellulose ether<br>
derivative is preferably 8:1 or less, more preferably in the range of from 1:2 to 8:1, even<br>
more preferably from 1:1 to 5:1, most preferably from 2:1 to 4:1.<br>
When the weight ratio is above 8:1, it is found that the emulsified DMS does not remain<br>
stable upon storage.<br>
Below about 1:2, the viscosity of the mixture is extremely high and is significantly more<br>
difficult to process, for instance, pumping the mixture becomes problematic.<br>
Thus, it is preferred that the viscosity of the flavouring composition is less than<br>
1800mPa.s at 100s"1 and 20°C.<br>
It has also been found that if the viscosity of the flavouring composition is too low, the<br>
risk of creaming of the droplets of DMS increases. Therefore, the viscosity should be<br>
sufficient to avoid this. Accordingly, it is preferred that the viscosity of the flavouring<br>
composition is greater than 900mPa.s at 100s-1 and 20°C.<br>
Other Ingredients<br>
The flavouring composition typically comprises additional flavouring ingredients suitable<br>
for use in an aqueous medium and for providing crab-like notes. For instance, fish paste<br>
or shrimp paste are well known ingredients suitable for use in a minced-fish product.<br>
Salt, especially sodium chloride, is typically added to the flavour composition. The<br>
amount of salt present should generally be less than 1% by weight based on the total<br>
weight of the flavour composition, more preferably less than 0.7%. It has been found that<br>
the presence of salt reduces the solubility of the cellulose ether derivative and so<br>
adversely affects its ability to stabilise the DMS.<br>
In order to improve emulsification, a solvent, especially an alcohol, can be in the<br>
composition. Particularly preferred are ethanol and/or propylene glycol. Typically these<br>
can be used in an amount of from 5 to 50% by weight based on the total weight of the<br>
flavouring composition, more preferably from 10 to 35%, most preferably from 20 to<br>
30%.<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to the following examples. It is to be<br>
understood that the examples are illustrative of the invention and that the scope of the<br>
invention is not limited thereto.<br>
All amounts are % by weight unless otherwise indicated.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of crab flavour using lecithin<br>
A crab flavour was prepared by shearing together the following ingredients at 60°C until<br>
the product appeared homogenous.<br>
Table 1<br><br><br>
* 58.3% DMS, 34.8% ethanol, 6.9% propylene glycol<br>
The composition was stored at 20°C. After 24 hours, a film of DMS was visible on the<br>
surface of the flavour. This demonstrates that the DMS component of the flavour is<br>
unstable when emulsified using a conventional emulsification agent.<br>
Example 2<br>
Preparation of a crab flavour containing a cellulose ether derivative<br>
Various crab flavours were prepared using cellulose ether derivatives given in the table<br>
below.<br>
Table 2<br><br>
*Melhocel® (ex Dow Chemicals)<br>
Each cellulose ether derivative was incorporated into the following flavouring<br>
composition:<br>
Table 3<br><br><br>
* see table 1<br>
** 72% crab or shrimp seafood liquid flavour respectively, 10% salt and 18% native<br>
tapioca starch<br>
* * * grade A, E or K respectively<br>
The compositions were prepared by firstly dispersing the cellulose ether derivative in the<br>
propylene glycol. The water was then added with stirring until the cellulose ether<br>
derivative had completely dissolved, after which the citric acid was incorporated. The<br>
crab topnote was then added with further stirring followed by the crab paste or shrimp<br>
paste. The mixture was stirred until a homogeneous solution formed. All mixing was<br>
performed under very low shear conditions and at room temperature.<br>
The resulting flavour compositions were stored at room temperature for 1 week, after<br>
which time the stability of the compositions was observed. The results are given in the<br>
following table.<br>
Table 4<br><br>
Example 3<br>
Effect of Varying the Amount of Cellulose Ether Derivative<br>
A crab flavour according to composition 1 in table 3 was prepared using grade E except<br>
that the cellulose ether level was 0.8% and the propylene glycol level was 25.7%.<br>
The composition formed a cream layer upon storage demonstrating that the weight ratio<br>
of DMS to cellulose ether should be about 8:1 or less.<br>
The results demonstrate that the compositions according to the invention can be prepared<br>
simply and inexpensively and avoid the need for harsh processing conditions.<br>
