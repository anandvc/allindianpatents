LOCK HAVING DIMPLE KEY<br>
(a)	JOSHIPRABHAKAR ANANT<br>
an Indian National                                    of J-61, MIDC, Bhosari, Pune 411 026, Maharashtra, India;<br>
and<br>
(b)	JOSHI SALIL PRABHAKAR<br>
an Indian National                                            of J-61, MIDC, Bhosari, Pune 411 026, Maharashtra, India,<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION DESCRIBES THE INVENTION.<br><br>
This invention relates to locks which can be operated with the help of a dimple key.<br>
Particularly, this invention relates to mortise locks.<br>
Still particularly, this invention relates to a Euro-profile cylinder Dimple Key Lock whose outside dimensions conform to the outside dimensions of the internationally used Euro-profile cylinder lock.<br>
The main aim of a lock manufacturer is to design and manufacture good quality locks having high security; large number of key combinations; different key arrangements like individual customer key, master key, grand master key and emergency key. Lock should be extremely difficult to open without the use of its original key. It should be possible to manufacture the lock &amp; keys in large quantities without big expenses and difficulty of extremely fine tolerances, without requiring very complex and expensive machines or processes.<br>
Original YALE locks have single-row pin-tumbler locking arrangement and flat keys having v-notches on one edge of key. These are fairly secure locks, but have the disadvantage of limited key combinations.<br>
Dimple key locks having pin-tumbler on three sides in which two side rows are inclined below the horizontal axis have the disadvantage of the key getting lighted up because of the partial vertical force on the key, from two sides. In such locks having more number of locking pins per row and smaller pitch between 2 holes, the maximum depth of dimple (counter-sunk hole) or oval slot is comparatively less. Hence such locks have low security because of shallow dimples and thinner locking pins<br>
2<br><br>
making locks having master and grand-master key has limitations because of shallow depths of dimples.<br>
This lock is fitted on the Mortise Lock for the entrance doors.<br>
The main object of the invention is to provide a Euro-profile cylinder lock with a Dimple Key which has smaller external diameter and other dimensions confirming to the international standards, for fitting on Mortise Locks on doors and also to make it very difficult to make or illegally copy the original key.<br>
The invention includes an improved Euro-profile cylinder lock with Dimple Key. The key is flat, has rectangular cross section with 2 sides and 2 edge surfaces. The lock has a stator, a sleeve and rotating cylinder, which rotate in the sleeve and lock housing. In the cylinder a rectangular slot extends axially to receive the key blade for operating the lock. Totally 3 rows of pin-tumblers are located in the said lock housing, sleeve and cylinder, out of which two rows are located in vertical plane on opposite sides of key face and the third in horizontal plane on the top side of the key. The flat key has, on each of its 2 flat surfaces, and top face, a row of countersunk holes receiving pin tumblers.<br>
This design leads to a smaller diameter of the lock housing conforming to international standards of Euro-profile lock and makes it more difficult to illegally copy the key.<br>
3<br><br>
The lock in accordance with this invention is a Euro-profile cylinder lock consisting of a lock having outside dimensions conforming to the internationally used Euro-profile cylinder locks. It also has a sleeve and a rotating cylinder. The lock is operated by a reversible-use Dimple Key, which is flat and has dimples (countersunk holes) on two flat faces and side edges.<br>
This lock has very high security because of Dimple Key locking. The Dimple Key has millions of possible key combinations and is very difficult to copy for making duplicate key, in the absence of original key.<br>
In accordance with this invention there is provide an improved, compact profile cylinder lock and key whose outer dimensions conform to the outer dimensions of the existing internationally used Euro-profile cylinder lock, which is fitted in the mortise locks having handle. The lock has a Dimple Key having dimples (countersunk holes) on two flat sides and one side edge. The key has rectangular cross section on the shank, which is inserted in the lock and rotated to open the lock. The key is reversible in use whereby it can be used on either side by rotating by 180°. The lock has a rotating cylinder, which is housed in a sleeve, which is fixed inside the lock housing. The cylinder has an axially extending key slot. Rows of longitudinally spaced radially movable, locking pins and pressure pins are assembled in the cylinder sleeve and housing. Two rows of locking pins and pressure pins lie in common plane on opposite side of the key slot and a third row is substantially at 90° to the coplanar rows. Thus the configuration of the locking pins is orthogonal with respect to each other. A lock and key, according to claim 1,wherein the planes containing the locking pins are aligned with each other and inclined at<br>
4<br><br>
equal angles of 90° on opposite sides of the horizontal plane and perpendicular to the edge side of the key.<br>
The key slot opens on the outer surface of the cylinder and the key is used as a turning key and is provided with dimples symmetrically arranged on two flat faces and the edge face. A sleeve is assembled between the cylinder and housing, in which pressure pins and lock springs are fitted on the opposite sides of the flat face of the flat key. The springs rest on the inside diameter of the lock housing.<br>
This invention relates therefore relates to a Euro-profile cylinder lock of the type having two parts pin tumbler i.e. locking pin and pressure pin and flat Dimple Key for use in combination with the lock. Where the pins are in rows orthogonal to each other and particularly the key is inserted horizontally i.e. operatively parallel to the ground.<br>
This invention describes and shows Euro-profile pin cylinder lock, which circumvents the disadvantages of existing locks.<br>
The pin-tumbler arrangement is on a rotary cylinder lock whose flat key has dimples (counter-sunk holes) on two flat faces and edge. The dimples on two flat faces are on the same axis at 180° and not on inclined axis.<br>
5<br><br>
Mechanical advantages of lock having locking pins at 180° are as follows -<br>
1) Smooth lock functions as pins are operating on same axis. There is no vertical thrust.<br>
2)	Greater depths of dimples. It results in greater rigidity to lock.<br>
3)	Larger numbers of key combinations.<br>
4)	Very large number of master and grand-master keys. Key is positioned in horizontal plane and not along vertical axis. It has following advantages -<br>
I)	Key rests flat in horizontal position. Hence it does not get lifted<br>
up by the weight of the key and other keys in key ring.<br>
II)	Because of larger resting area the wear on key is less<br>
over long-term use.<br>
III)	Easier insertion and withdrawal of key.<br>
In order to understand the manner in which the above mentioned objectives are attained the design features will be described with reference to the enclosed drawings, which form a part of this specification: -<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS: -<br>
FIG. 1 is an isometric view of the complete Euro-profile cylinder lock assembly with the Dimple Key inserted in it.<br>
7<br><br>
This lock is operated by key from either of two sides. By rotating the key the cam is rotated, which in turn, operates the latch bolt of the mortise lock, which is fitted on door.<br>
FIG.3 LOCK ASSEMBLY:-<br>
The lock assembly consists of a stationary housing part 1, rotating cylinder 3 and stationary sleeve 2.The cylinder 3 has rectangular key slot, which lies in horizontal plane in its normal rotational position for receiving the key. In FIG.3C the flat key 8 is shown inserted in the lock. The lock is provided with 3 pin tumbler rows shown in FIG. 3E, 3F and 3G, which are parallel to the axis of the cylinder 3. Each pin tumbler set consists of 2 parts comprising locking pins 9 and 12 mounted in radial holes of cylinder 3 and pressure pins 4 and 10 located in the radial holes of sleeve 2. Locking springs 7 and 11 rest outwardly against lock housing 1 and give compression load to pressure pins 4 &amp; 10.<br>
The two pins tumbler rows in FIG. 3F and 3G are operating in vertical plane on the flat sides of key 8 and the pin tumbler row in FIG. 3E is operating in horizontal plane on the narrow edge of the key 8. The pin tumblers are located parallel to the longitudinal axis of the key.<br>
In FIG. 4C on the narrow side of flat key 8, a row of dimples (countersunk holes) is provided in the longitudinal direction along the shank of the key for receiving the locking pins 12 associated with the narrow side of the key.<br>
8<br><br>
In FIG. 4B on the 2 flat sides of the key, a row of dimples (countersunk holes) is provided on longitudinal direction along the shank of the key for receiving the locking pins 9 and 13 associated with the flat sides of the key.<br>
The tumbler planes of two pin tumbler rows 9 and tumbler plane of pin tumbler row 12 intersect in FIG 3F and 3G at the rotation axis of cylinder 3 and therefore also in the horizontal plane in FIG. 3C of the inserted flat key 8 on a common straight line coinciding with the cylinder axis, because the cylinder 8 is positioned coaxially to the cylindrical housing 1 of the pin cylinder lock.<br>
Key channel of the lock cylinder is made as an open slot towards the horizontal surface of the cylinder 3. Cylinder 3, in its insertion or withdrawal position for key 8, in which the rectangular key channel points horizontally side wards.<br>
The common planes of the two pin tumbler rows 9 and pin tumbler row 12 are longitudinally offset by half of the row separation (pitch) along the axis of the lock assembly.<br>
In FIG. 4A, an isometric view of flat key 8 is shown. It has dimples (countersunk holes) on all four sides of the key receiving the tumbler pins 9 and 12. In FIG. 4C the dimples on edge face of the key are shown. In FIG.4B the dimples on the flat face of the key is shown.<br>
9<br><br>
The key shown in this lock can be inserted in either of two positions at 180° angular rotations. The key will open and close the lock in either position with equal effect.<br>
FIG. 5 shows enlarged cross sectional view of shank of flat key 8. The cross section is rectangular. Two different depths of edge dimples are designated by T1and T2 rotational axis AXK of flat key 8 inserted in key channel and located in its central longitudinal horizontal plane coincides with the rotational axis AXL of cylinder lock (See FIG. 3E). Vertical plane of key edge forms the reference plane for dimensioning different depths T1 and T2.<br>
Similarly, FIG. 6 shows four different depths T1 to T4 for the side dimples of flat key 8. The horizontal plane of the flat face of key 8 is the reference plane for dimensioning depths T1 to T4. The angle 'A' between two lateral sides of the dimple is 90° corresponding to the cone angle 90° of cylinder pin 9 and 12 of FIG. 3.<br>
FIG. 7 shows the lock housing 1, which is the main body of the lock, in which the complete lock assembly is housed. It has one row of holes, which are in alignment with the dimples on the flat side of the key 8 shown in FIG. 4B. Top locking pins 13, pressure pins 4, springs 7 and sealing pins 6 are assembled one above the other. Springs 7 exert pressure on pressure pins 4 and top locking pins 13.<br>
FIG. 8 shows the sleeve 2 (FIG. 3C), which is an important part of this lock. Its outer diameter matches with the bore of the lock housing 1 and<br>
10<br><br>
the inner diameter matches with the outside diameter of the lock cylinder 3(FIG. 3C).<br>
Radial holes are drilled on three axes at 90° FIG.8B. Lock springs 11 and pressure pins 10 are assembled in these holes FIG. 3C and FIG. 3D.<br>
FIG. 9 shows the rotating cylinder 3,which rotates within the sleeve 2. Parallel key slot is milled along the axis of the cylinder (FIG. 9B) to receive the flat key 8.<br>
Radial holes are drilled on three axes at 90° (FIG. 9E).<br>
These rows of holes match with the corresponding holes on the sleeve 2 and dimples on the key 8. Locking pins 9 and 13 are assembled in these holes. When the key 8 is inserted in the lock, all locking pins are activated by the corresponding dimples on the key 8 and they are radially pushed outwards so that their curved head come in alignment with the outside diameter of cylinder. The cylinder now will be free to rotate and the lock is opened by rotating the key 8. The planes containing the three axis of the radial holes and the three axis of the dimples in the key intersect on the rotational axis of the cylinder and key.<br>
