				<td>APPARATUS AND PROCESS FOR BEER PREPARATION<br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and process for beer preparation.<br>
A wort kettle is known for example from DE-C-43 04 383. The known wort kettle contains a<br>
tank body in which a so-called internal boiler is located to heat up the wort. The internal boiler is<br>
made as a steam-heated heat exchanger with vertically running passage ducts for the wort, so<br>
that the wort rises upwards from the base of the tank through the heating in the heat<br>
exchanger. Above the heat exchanger, the internal boiler contains an accumulation cone with a<br>
cylindrical outlet pipe through which the thermoflow of the wort is bundled and conveyed<br>
upwards above the liquid level of the wort in the tank body. Above the mouthpiece opening of<br>
the cylindrical outlet pipe, a guide screen is provided in the form of a conical baffle surface<br>
which picks up the wort emerging from the cylindrical outlet pipe and diverts it downwards again<br>
towards the liquid level. The known wort kettle contains moreover a pipe with a pump for a<br>
forced flow of the wort in the tank body, whereby the wort is drawn off out of the tank body<br>
outside the internal boiler and pumped back into the tank body directly underneath the internal<br>
boiler. The area underneath the internal boiler and around the mouth of the pipe is shut off from<br>
the rest of the tank body, so that it is ensured that the wort passed by forced flow through the<br>
pipe only enters the internal boiler and does not escape at the side into the tank body.<br>
However, it has been found that the known wort kettle can be improved yet further in terms of<br>
its efficiency.<br>
The object of the invention is therefore to provide an apparatus and process of this type with<br>
improved efficiency.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an apparatus for beer preparation, in particular a<br>
wort kettle having a tank body for receiving a wort stock, an internal boiler which is disposed<br>
in the tank body and is provided with a heat exchanger and a guide screen, and a forced wort<br>
circulation which is connected to a pump and passes through the boiler characterised in that<br>
the forced wort circulation comprises a thin film distribution device for the wort, which<br>
distribution device has a piping section which is connected to the pump which piping section<br>
opens out into the tank body above the guide screen, via an orifice of reduced cross-sectional<br>
area, and which has, above the orifice, a flow-guiding baffle surface, which is impinged by flow<br>
from below and is for deflecting the liquid in the direction towards the wort stock.<br><br>
Because of the thin-film distribution device provided and arranged according to the invention<br>
with its reduced outlet cross-section and the baffle surface above it, the energy passed into the<br>
wort through the pump in addition to the heat flow is used advantageously to feed the wort, in<br>
addition to the normal wort cycle and the distribution by the internal boiler, into a second cycle<br>
with fine distribution through which, for example, the steaming out of undesired flavours is<br>
further improved.<br>
Admittedly, a thin-film distribution device is already known, for example, from WO 00/00583,<br>
but there it replaces the boiler.<br>
Moreover, it is known for example from EP-A-605 783 that an internal boiler for a wort kettle is<br>
provided with two wort guide screens lying vertically above each other, whereby the lower wort<br>
guide screen is provided with a central opening through which the thermoflow caused by the<br>
heat exchanger can enter upwards, so that two distribution bells for the wort are formed, which,<br>
however, because of the relatively low flow speed, are less effective.<br>
In contrast, the mouth cross-section, reduced according to the invention, of the pipe supplied by<br>
a pump ensures that a smaller volume of the wort emerges at the same time from the mouth<br>
opening, the speed of which, however, is much higher than a pure flow of heat. In this way, the<br>
baffle surface creates a wort bell with a considerably smaller layer thickness, which greatly<br>
improves in particular the steaming out of undesired flavours.<br>
Advantageous further developments of the invention are described hereinafter.<br>
An additional feed device is particularly advantageous, since this increases the flow rate<br>
through the thin-film distribution device and at the same time accelerates the flow through the<br>
internal boiler, which increases the throughput and reduces fouling. This applies in particular for<br>
an automatic suction since, in this way, the full throughput capacity is reached.<br>
The form of the baffle surface is particularly important in relation to the formation of the thinnest<br>
possible layer. Preferably, the baffle surface should be already provided in the mouth opening,<br>
and from there it runs, gently curved, at an angle upwards to the outside.<br>
Shaping the mouth opening as a circular gap which can if necessary be adjusted in size also<br>
promotes the formation of a thin layer.<br><br>
The invention also provides a process for beer preparation, in particular wort boiling,<br>
characterized by the development of a first and a second wort circulation the first wort<br>
circulation being a thermal flow circulation, and the second wort circulation proceeding via a<br>
forced wort circulation having a pump and a thin film distribution device.<br>
Embodiments of the invention are explained in more detail in the following using the<br>
accompanying drawings. The following are shown:<br>
Fig. 1 shows a wort kettle formed according to the invention in a highly diagrammatic<br>
illustration, and<br>
Fig. 2 shows detail "A" from Fig. 1 in a section, and<br>
Fig. 3 shows a further embodiment of the invention.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a device for brewing beer in the form of a wort kettle 1, especially a whirlpool pan,<br>
as used for the manufacture and preparation of wort in beer manufacture. The wort kettle 1<br>
contains a normal tank body 2 with side walls 2a, a base 2b and a cover 2c which can be of the<br>
normal shape. In the embodiment illustrated, the tank body 2 has a circular cross-section and is<br>
erected with a vertical axis. The tank body 2 holds a sufficient quantity of the wort stock 3.<br>
In the axial middle of the tank body 2, an internal boiler 4 is positioned which, as is normal for<br>
these internal boilers, has a heat exchanger 5 and an accumulation cone 6. The heat<br>
exchanger 5 has a large number of pipes 5a, which are installed with vertical axes and open<br>
ends and are heated preferably by steam or hot water, whereby the devices for supplying<br>
steam and other devices necessary for the operation of the internal boiler 4 and the wort kettle<br>
1 are known and are not shown here to give greater clarity. The pipes 5a are arranged with<br>
their open, lower ends at a sufficient distance above the base 2b and end with their open, upper<br>
ends underneath the liquid level 3a of the wort stock 3 in tank body 2.<br>
In the present description, the terms "top" and "bottom" are defined with reference to the<br>
direction of gravity in the installation position of the respective device in operation.<br>
The accumulation cone 6 has, in the present embodiment, a cylindrical area 6a, the lower edge<br>
of which has a larger diameter than the heat exchanger 5, so that there is, between the heat<br>
exchanger 5 and the cylindrical area 6a of the accumulation cone 6, an opening 7, through<br><br>
which wort can pass. The cylindrical area 6a is continued upwards through a conical area 6b,<br>
which reaches to above the liquid level 3a and then leads into a second cylindrical area 6c<br>
which reaches from the conical area 6b far enough upwards to bundle and even out the<br>
thermoflow of the wort from the heat exchanger 5. The cylindrical area 6c has the same cross-<br>
section between the conical area 6b and its mouth opening 6d. Above the mouth opening 6d of<br>
the accumulation cone 6 and at a distance from it, one of the normal flow guide screens 8 is<br>
provided which is bent like a spherical calotte, i.e. near the axial centre, has its highest point<br>
above the mouth opening 6d and falls down on all sides with increasing radial distance.<br>
The internal boiler 4, as it has been described so far, also functions like a normal internal boiler,<br>
i.e. the heating in the heat exchanger 5 sets up a heat cycle, i.e. the wort rises within pipes 5a<br>
upwards into the accumulation cone 6, is bundled there into a laminar flow and aligned and<br>
pressed through the mouth opening 6d upwards against the guide screen 8, which passes the<br>
heated wort in an outlet bell back into the wort stock 3, as is designated by the heat flow 9.<br>
Furthermore, a small proportion of the flow can leave the accumulation cone 6, also indicated<br>
by a heat flow 9, through the opening 7, which creates additional turbulence in the wort stock 3.<br>
The flow along the heat flow 9 forms the main flow inside the wort kettle 1.<br>
At the wort kettle 1, a forced wort circulation 10 is furthermore provided, which comprises at<br>
least a pipe 11 and a preferably frequency-controlled pump 12. The pipe 11 emerges in the<br>
lower third in the area of the wort stock 3 from the side wall 2a of the tank body 2, runs via<br>
pump 12 and if necessary via a control valve 12a (if the pump 12 is not frequency-controlled)<br>
and is passed back in the axial centre regarding the internal boiler 4 through the base 2b of the<br>
tank body 2. The pipe 11 continues vertically upwards in the inside of the tank body 2 as a riser.<br>
If the forced wort circulation 10 contains several pipes 11, these are taken via a common pump<br>
and if necessary a common control valve into a common riser. The riser contains a first pipe<br>
subsection 11a, which runs vertically upwards from the intake of the pipe 11 into the tank body<br>
2 through the heat exchanger 5, and a second pipe subsection 11b connected to it, which<br>
projects beyond the heat exchanger 5 and goes through the remaining internal boiler 4, i.e. the<br>
accumulation cone 6 and the guide screen 8 and projects beyond the guide screen 8. Here, the<br>
second pipe subsection 11b is open on the end to form an orifice 13 which is essentially<br>
horizontal.<br>
Above the orifice 13, a guide device 14 is located with a baffle surface 15 facing downwards.<br>
The baffle surface 15 dips into the orifice 13 or begins there, near the axial centre of the orifice<br>
13 and rises from there, gently curved at an angle upwards and outwards, whereby the curve of<br><br>
the baffle surface 15 is formed in-such away that near to the orifice 13 the axial parts of the<br>
curve predominate, but that these decrease in the further course of the curve, until the radial<br>
parts of the curve predominate. In the outer edge region of the guide device 14 at its greatest<br>
radial distance from the centre line, the curve can show axial parts again, i.e. the outer edge of<br>
the baffle surface 15 can be slightly curved downwards again. Preferably, the baffle surface 15<br>
can be formed as a rotation surface of a hyperbola- or parabola-type curve section.<br>
The part of the baffle surface 15 dipping into the pipe subsection 11b gives the orifice 13<br>
directly at the upper edge of the pipe subsection 11 b a considerably decreased outlet cross-<br>
section, whereby the orifice 13 becomes ring-shaped. The outlet cross-section of the orifice 13<br>
can, if there is a corresponding curve in the baffle surface 15, be adjusted in its size through an<br>
axial displacement of the guide device 14.<br>
Through the pump 12, wort is sucked from the wort stock 3 via the pipe 11 and pushed into the<br>
riser, and, accelerated due to the reducing outlet cross-section of the orifice 13 directly at the<br>
end of the pipe subsection 11b, but reduced in terms of volume, is conveyed with a high level of<br>
energy against the baffle surface 15 so that the wort is distributed there in the form of a thin-<br>
layer bell along arrows 16 and passes again into the wort stock 3. The pump, the orifice 13<br>
with reduced cross-section and the baffle surface 15 thus form a thin-film distribution device 17.<br>
The thin-film distribution device 17 contains furthermore an additional feed device 18 which is<br>
also shown in Fig. 2. The feed device 18 comprises an area 19 of the pipe subsection 11b with<br>
a reduced cross-section which is located below the liquid level 3a in the wort stock 3 and within<br>
the accumulation cone 6. The area 19 with reduced cross-section forms a suction opening 20,<br>
which is covered towards the top by a conical apron 21, so that the suction opening 20 is only<br>
accessible from underneath at an angle, i.e. from the direction of the outlet pipes 5a of the heat<br>
exchanger 5. In the embodiment shown, the pipe subsection 11b is divided into two to form the<br>
feed device 18 and contains a lower pipe piece 22, which forms the connection to the lower<br>
pipe subsection 11a and passes into the area 19 with reduced cross-section, and an upper pipe<br>
piece 23, which is arranged coaxially to the area 19 and runs as far as the orifice 13, whereby<br>
the pipe piece 23 essentially has the same internal diameter as the riser in the first pipe<br>
subsection 11a.<br>
The area 19 with reduced cross-section creates, according to the water jet pump principle, a<br>
flow which sucks additional wort from the area above the heat exchanger 5 and conveys it into<br>
the inside of the pipe subsection 11b. In this way, on the one hand, the flow quantity 16 is<br><br>
increased and, on the other hand, the through flow of the heat exchanger 5 is improved, so that<br>
the transfer of heat can be improved and fouling in the boiler reduced.<br>
During the operation of the wort kettle 1 according to the invention, the internal boiler 4 of the<br>
wort stock 3 is heated, whereby the heating in the heat exchanger 5 ensures a first cycle of the<br>
wort 3 along the heat flow 9. At the same time, through pump 12 and one or preferably several<br>
pipes 11 leading out of the tank body 2, wort is sucked for a second cycle along the arrows 16<br>
and pushed into the riser. Because the pipe subsection 11a runs through the heat exchanger 5,<br>
the flow caused by the pump is overlaid by a flow of heat, so that the wort is pushed with<br>
increasing energy through the feed device 18, where in addition wort is sucked in above the<br>
heat exchanger 5. Subsequently, the pumped and sucked in wort is passed through the orifice<br>
13 with reduced cross-section against the baffle surface 15 and taken from there back into the<br>
wort stock 3 distributed in a bell with a low layer thickness.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a further embodiment of a wort kettle 1' formed according to the invention, which<br>
corresponds to the wort kettle 1 in Figs. 1 and 2 apart from the details described in the<br>
following, so that these do not need to be explained again.<br>
The embodiment according to Fig. 3 is particularly intended for the retrofitting of existing beer<br>
brewing devices. For this purpose, the pipe 11 of the forced wort circulation 10 leading into the<br>
base 2b of the tank body 2 is connected via a connector piece 24 with one or more ducts or<br>
pipes 5a of the heat exchanger 5 in such a way that two heat exchanger areas 5.1 and 5.2<br>
essentially separated from each other are formed in the heat exchanger 5. The heat exchanger<br>
area 5.1 is connected as normal with the wort stock 3 in the tank body 2, whilst the heat<br>
exchanger area 5.2 is supplied by the forced wort circulation 10. At the upper outlet of the heat<br>
exchanger 5, a further connector piece 25 is provided which passes from the heat exchanger<br>
area 5.2 into the pipe subsection 11b. Here, the connector piece 25 can be formed at the same<br>
time as the lower pipe piece of the infeed device 18 (see Fig. 2).<br>
The two wort cycles 9 and 16 are also formed with this embodiment according to Fig. 3.<br>
As a modification of the described and drawn embodiment, the invention can be used with wort<br>
kettles of any structural design, working unpressurised or under pressure and with any known<br>
construction of an internal boiler but also, for example, with heated forward flow containers or<br>
similar.<br><br>
