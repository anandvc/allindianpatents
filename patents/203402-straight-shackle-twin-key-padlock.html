COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (See Section 10)<br><br><br>
STRAIGHT SHACKLE TWIN KEY PADLOCK<br><br>
GODREJ &amp; BOYCE MFG. CO. LTD. of LOCKS DIVISION PLANT-18 PIROJSHANAGAR, VIKHROLI, MUMBAI - 4 00 079, MAHARASHTRA, India, INDIAN Company hereby declare : -<br>
22-12-2003<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br><br>
STRAIGHT SHACKLE TWIN KEY PADLOCK<br>
This invention relates to the Twin Key Padlock and more particularly Straight Shackle Twin Key Padlock.<br>
This invention relates, to two key operated padlock having different combinations and specifically used for Access Control. Heretofore , it was known to make padlock having single key which, was operated by a single person for locking and unlocking. Due to the single key / person control, these locks are susceptible for key duplication and to avoid this usually demands for very high technology , this has made the inventor to split the control / restrict the access to open lock by single person. This will enhance the security of the lock irrespective of the lock technology. This is a very useful feature , generally required in banks (safe deposit vaults), post offices, government offices, hotels , shops, departmental stores, joint custodian areas where the permission of the supervisor / common controller is required in addition with the individual to open the lock.<br>
In the existing single actuated key locks , there is also a possibility of key loss or key not returned by the customer in case at the hotel ,. wherein the whole lock is required to be replaced to avoid the access to unknown person or to the old customer. This has made the inventor to invent a lock, which can be rekeyed and will avoid replacement of the whole lock as well as access with old key. The same invention can<br>
- 2 -<br><br>
be offered with single key system as an another embodiment of the invention for normal application were the security requirement is not very high.<br>
Now in the present invention there is provided dual key operating system , which does not allow any person to operate the lock with single key. The lock is to be operated with two keys simultaneously by two different persons having agreement on opening the lock with each other, thereby providing the access control and security feature of dual controlâ€¢<br>
Accordingly it is an object of the invention to provide a split control / restricts the.access to padlock opening , which will enhance tUe padlock security and avoid the key duplication by a single person.<br>
It is further object of the invention to provide a lock with rekeying facility in which the same lock will be rekeyed to avoid the access by a person with old key.<br>
It is still further object of the present invention is to provide a padlock which has a higher safety and security as compared with the known padlock and at the same time is of simple construction and ease to manufacture.<br>
It is still further object of the invention is to provide a straight shackle fully enclosed inside the body thereby making it difficult to cut by a hack - saw and to open by a crow bar or similar object.<br>
- 3 -<br><br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a lock with two key operating system for requirements of Access Control or to avoid the opening of the lock by a single person with single key.<br>
The novel features of the present invention are set forth in particular in the appended claims. The invention itself will be best understood From the following description of preferred embodiment taken together with the accompanying drawings.<br>
The invention  will  now  be  described with reference to Figures 1 - 4 in the accompanying drawings.<br>
Fig. 1 : Shows the isometric view of the present invention.<br>
Fig. 2 : Shows the basic views of the present invention.<br><br><br><br>
Fig. 3 : Shows the sectional view of the present invention along the line AA.<br>
Fig. 4 : Shows the exploded view of the present invention.<br>
To illustrate the preferred embodiments of the invention.the Straight Shackle Twin Key Padlock comprising of the housing assembly (100) and pin cylinder lock assembly (200) . The housing assembly further comprises of the case (1) having two holes (2) &amp; (3) to slideably receive the locking member (shackle) (4) having a recess (5) adapted to be engaged by driving crank (13) of pin cylinder assembly (2 00) to provide the locking and unlocking of the straight shackle twin key -<br>
- 4 -<br><br>
padlock. The housing has a recess (6) to receive the pin cylinder assembly (200), which is integrated with the housing by rivet (7). The shackle is slideably retained by a rivet (8) riveted to pousing (1) , which is normally retained in protracted (unlocked) position by spring (9).<br>
The pin cylinder assembly (200) comprises of housing (10) having axial slots to receive cylinder (11) &amp; (12) which are<br><br><br>
tf<br>
o\W<br>
engaged with the driving crank (13) and rotatably retained<br>
in the housing (10) by circlips (14). The crank (13) adapted<br>
to be engaged radially in the recess__4_of--a shackle<br>
thereby providing the locking and unlocking of the Straight<br>
Shackle Twin Key Padlock.	<br>
The cylinder (11) &amp; (12) has a plurality of holes to retain operating pins (15) and driver pins (16) adapted to be engaged with the keys (17) &amp; (18) and retain its position by springs (19) , the plug"s (20) are riveted into the housing to retain the springs into the holes of the housing (10) . The operating pins (15) and driver pins (16) are aligned along with the shear line oi the cylinder and housing when the keys are inserted into the respective cylinders, hence, allowing cylinder to rotate along with the crank thereby providing the locking and unlocking of the Straight Shackle Twin Key Padlock.<br>
The pin cylinder assembly (200) is further provided with a ball (21) and a spring (22) to retain the cylinders in particular position thereby allowing to insert or retract the key.<br>
- 5 -<br><br>
The material, shape and size of the component may vary according to requirement and application.<br>
From the foregoing , it will be seen that this invention is one well adapted to attain all of the ends and objects herein above set forth, together with other advantages which are obvious and which are inherent in the lock.<br>
It will be understood that certain features and sub combinations are of utility and may be employed without reference to other features and sub combinations. This is contemplated by and is within the scope of the claims.<br>
As many possible embodiments may be made of the invention without departing from the scope thereof, it is to be understood that all matters herein set forth or shown in the accompanying drawings is to be interpretated as illustrative and not in a limited sense.<br>
