				<td>MANUFACTURE OF POLYGLUTAMATE-THERAPEUTIC AGENT<br>
CONJUGATES<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a process for scaled-up manufacture of polyglutamate-<br>
therapeutic agent conjugates for clinical development.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The antitumor agent paclitaxel shows increased efficacy and decreased toxicity<br>
when administered to tumor-bearing hosts as a polygJutamic acid conjugate compared<br>
with the unconjugated form of the drug (U.S. Serial No. 08/815,104, allowed; Li et al,<br>
Cancer Res. 58:. 2404, 1998). The polyglutamic acid-paclitaxel conjugate shows<br>
increased water solubility, a slower clearance from the body, and an increased<br>
accumulation in the tumor. Conjugates of polyglutamic acid and various other therapeutic<br>
agents are expected to provide clinically useful alternatives to the presently available<br>
formulations.<br>
For research purposes, the polyglutamic acid-therapeutic agent conjugates can be<br>
produced by the method disclosed in Li et al, ibid. In that method, the conjugate is<br>
prepared as a sodium salt, dialyzed to remove low molecular weight contaminants and<br>
excess salt and then lyophilized. The method is not well-suited for large-scale<br>
manufacture of quantities of conjugates for clinical development and use, however. In<br>
particular, the use of dialysis to remove impurities is time-consuming and lowers final<br>
product yield. In addition, although many pharmaceuticals have more favorable<br>
properties when prepared as salts (e.g., improved solubility, storage, and handling), this is<br>
not true of the polyglutamate-therapeutic agent conjugates of the present invention. The<br>
Attorney Docket No. 1402<br>
salt forms of the conjugates are electrostatic solids, not free flowing powders. They are<br>
more difficult to package, more susceptible to dust contamination and more likely to<br>
contaminate the workplace with cytotoxic agents than are free flowing powders.<br>
Therefore, there is a need for an improved process of manufacture of polyglutamic acid-<br>
therapeutic agent conjugates that can be used to produce gram to hundreds of gram<br>
quantities of these conjugates in high yields and in a manner that provides for improved<br>
materials handling and packaging.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention satisfies this need by providing an improved process for<br>
preparing a polyglutamic acid-therapeutic agent conjugate that is capable of providing<br>
gram to hundreds of gram quantities of pharmaceutical grade conjugate with yields of<br>
between 85 and 98%.<br>
In one embodiment, the process comprises the steps of:<br>
(a) providing the protonated form of a polyglutamic acid polymer and a<br>
therapeutic agent for conjugation thereto;<br>
(b) covalently linking said agent to said polyglutamic acid polymer in an inert<br>
organic solvent to form a polyglutamic acid-therapeutic agent conjugate;<br>
(c) precipitating said polyglutamic acid-therapeutic agent conjugate from solution<br>
by addition of an excess volume of aqueous salt solution; and<br>
(d) collecting said conjugate as a protonated solid-<br>
Additional removal of residual low molecular weight contaminants can be carried out<br>
between step (c) and step (d) or after step (d).<br>
In another embodiment, which is preferred for the large-scale manufacture of<br>
polyglutamic acid-2'paclitaxel conjugate, the process comprises the steps of:<br>
(a) providing an aqueous solution of the sodium salt of poly-L-glutamic acid;<br>
(b) acidifying the solution to a pH of about 2 to 4, thereby converting the sodium<br>
salt of poly-L-glutamic acid to the protonated form and precipitating it from<br>
solution;<br>
(c) collecting the poly-L-glutamic acid precipitate and washing with water;<br>
(d) drying the poly-L-glutamic acid to a water content of between 7% and 21%<br>
by weight;<br>
(e) contacting the poly-L-glutamic acid with paclitaxel under standard coupling<br>
conditions for sufficient time to conjugate paclitaxel tothe polyglutamic acid polymer via<br>
an ester linkage formed between the 2'-OH group of paclitaxel and a carboxy group of<br>
poly-L-glutamic acid;<br>
(f) cooling the reaction mixture from between 0°C to 10"C while slowly adding<br>
aqueous salt solution to the reaction mixture;<br>
(h) acidifying the resulting suspension;<br>
(i) collecting the conjugate as a protonated solid; and<br>
(j) extracting impurities from the protonated solid.<br>
Any polyglutamic acid-therapeutic agent conjugate can be prepared by the<br>
processes described herein. In one preferred embodiment, the therapeutic agents are<br>
antitumor agents, e.g., paclitaxel, docetaxel, etoposide, teniposide, epothilones,<br>
gemcitabine, 20(S)(+) camptothecin, 9-aminocamptothecin, 9-nitrocamptothecin, 7-ethyl-<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Definitions<br>
As used herein, "a polyglutamic acid" or "polyglutamic acid polymer " includes<br>
poly (1-glutamic acid), poly (d-glutamic acid) and poly (dl-glutamic acid). Preferably the<br>
polyglutamic acid polymer comprises at least 50% of its amino acid residues as glutamic<br>
acid, and more preferably, 100%. The polyglutamic acid polymer can be substituted up<br>
to 50% by naturally occurring or chemically modified amino acids, preferably<br>
hydrophilic amino acids, provided that when conjugated to a therapeutic agent, the<br>
substituted polyglutamic acid polymer has improved aqueous solubility and/or improved<br>
efficacy relative to the unconjugated therapeutic agent, and is preferably<br>
nonimmunogenic.<br>
The molecular weight of the polyglutamic acid polymer used in the preparation of<br>
the conjugate by the methods described herein is typically greater than 5000 daltons,<br>
preferably from 20kd to 80kd, more preferably from 30 kd to 60kd (as determined by<br>
viscosity). Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the molecular weight values may<br>
be different when measured by other methods. These other methods include, for<br>
example, gel permeation, low angle light scattering, multiple angle laser light scattering,<br>
refractive index and combinations thereof.<br>
As used herein, a "polyglutamic acid -therapeutic agent conjugate" refers to a<br>
polyglutamic acid polymer that is covalently bonded to the therapeutic agent by a direct<br>
linkage between a carboxylic acid residue of the polyglutamic acid and a functional group<br>
of the therapeutic agent, or by an indirect linkage via one or more bifunctional spacer<br>
groups. Preferred spacer groups are those that are relatively stable to hydrolysis in the<br>
circulation, are biodegradable and are nontoxic when cleaved from the conjugate. Of<br>
course, it is understood that suitable spacers will not interfere with the antitumor efficacy<br>
of the conjugates. Exemplary spacers include amino acids (e.g., glycine, alanine, leucine,<br>
isoleucine), hydroxyacids, diols, aminothiols, hydroxythiols, aminoalcohols, and<br>
combinations of these. A therapeutic agent can be linked to the polymer or spacer by any<br>
linking method that results in a physiologically cleavable bond (i.e., a bond that is<br>
cleavable by enzymatic or nonenzymatic mechanisms that pertain to conditions in a living<br>
animal organism). Examples of preferred linkages include ester, amide, carbamate,<br>
carbonate.acyloxyalkylether.acyloxyalkylthioether, acyloxyalkylester, acyloxyalkylamide,<br>
acyloxyalkoxycarbonyl, acyloxyalkylamine, acyloxyalkylamide, acyloxyalkylcarbamate,<br>
acyloxyalkylsulfonamide, ketal, acetal, disulfide, thioester, N-acylamide,<br>
alkoxycarbonyloxyalkyl, urea, and N-sulfonylimidate.<br>
Methods for forming these linkages are well known to those skilled in synthetic<br>
organic chemistry, and can be found for example in standard texts such as J. March,<br>
Advanced Organic Chemistry, Wiley Interscience, 4th Edition.<br>
The degree of loading of therapeutic agent on the polymer (i.e., the" loading<br>
density") may be expressed as the number of molecules per polyglutamic acid polymer<br>
chain or preferably as a % of total weight of the conjugate ("% loading"). Any desired %<br>
loading can be obtained by adjusting the ratios of the therapeutic agent and polymer. The<br>
optimal loading density for a given conjugate and given use is determined empirically<br>
based on the desired properties of the conjugate (e.g., water solubility, therapeutic<br>
efficacy, pharmacokinetic properties, toxicity and dosage requirements). The loading<br>
density ranges from between 1% to about 60%, preferably from 5% to 55%, and even<br>
more preferably, from 20% to 55% for the conjugates that are specifically described<br>
herein.<br>
The % loading is typically determined by three methods: (1) calculated weight %<br>
(2) uv spectrophotometry; and (3) NMR ratio method.<br>
(1). The calculated weight % is based on the known weight of the polyglutamic<br>
acid starting material and the weight of the therapeutic agent. For all conjugates, the<br>
conversion to conjugate form is 100% complete, as determined by TLC on silica.<br>
(2) The uv spectrophotometry method is based on the weight % of the therapeutic<br>
agent as measured by uv absorbance, as exemplified for a paclitaxel-polyglutamic acid<br>
conjugate. The conjugate is dissolved in deionized water (2.5 or 5 mg/ml), centrifuged at<br>
500g for 15 minutes to remove particulate matter if present, and the clear solution is<br>
diluted lOOx to 200x with deionized water. The uv absorption is read against the diluent<br>
at 228nm. A solution of the same lot of polyglutamic acid used to prepare the conjugate<br>
is dissolved at the same nominal concentration as the conjugate and its absorbance is read<br>
against the diluent at 228nm. A linear calibration curve is prepared by measuring the<br>
absorbance at 228nm of solutions of known concentrations of the paclitaxel dissolved in<br>
methanol. To calculate the percent loading, the absorbance of the polyglutamic acid<br>
solution (corrected to account for the theoretical loading of polyglutamic acid in the<br>
polyglutamic acid-paclitaxel solution) is subtracted from the polyglutamic acid-paclitaxel<br>
absorbance. This corrected absorbance is compared to the paclitaxel standard curve to<br>
obtain the paclitaxel concentration (w/v) in the conjugate solution. The percent loading is<br>
the ratio of the paclitaxel concentration to the polyglutamic acid-paclitaxel conjugate<br>
concentration times 100.<br>
(3) The NMR ratio method is based on the weight % of therapeutic agent as<br>
measured by the ratio of the peaks in the spectra resulting from the polymer in relation to<br>
the peaks from the therapeutic agent. This is illustrated below for polyglutamic acid-<br>
paclitaxel conjugate.<br>
Attorney Docket No. 1402<br>
The area between 4.5 and 6.5 ppm is totalled and divided by the number of<br>
protons (7). This number is then compared to the area between 3.8 to 4.4 ppm for the<br>
polymer backbone and is corrected for 2 protons from paclitaxel that overlap.<br>
The two areas per proton are compared taking into account the molecular weights of the<br>
paclitaxel and the polymer.<br>
A= area per proton for polymer -s-area per proton for paclitaxel =<br>
21.36/1.98=10.79.<br>
MW paclitaxel =837; MW of polyglutamic acid monomer is 129.<br>
% loading = (837 /(10.79 x 129) + 837) x 100 = 37.6%.<br>
The processes described herein are generally useful for preparing conjugates of<br>
polyglutamic acid with any therapeutic or diagnostic agent that is appropriately<br>
functionalized for linking to the polyglutamic acid, as described herein. The conjugates<br>
that are exemplified herein are intended to illustrate the invention, but not to limit its<br>
scope.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the therapeutic agents comprise drugs that are<br>
effective in treating cancerous conditions that are expected to benefit from the unique<br>
pharmacokinetic properties of these conjugate (e.g., enhanced permeability and retention<br>
in tumor tissue, sustained release of active agent, long biological half life compared with<br>
the unconjugated agent, and others). Presently preferred agents include, by way of<br>
example, taxanes (e.g., paclitaxel, docetaxel), etoposide, teniposide, epothilones,<br>
gemcitabine, 20(S)(+) camptothecin, 9-aminocamptothecin, 9-nitrocamptothecin, 7-ethyl-<br>
10-hydroxycamptothecin, 9-dimethylaminomethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin, 10,11-<br>
methylenedioxycamptothecin, 7-methylpiperizinomethyl-10,l 1-<br>
ethylenedioxycamptothecin, flavopiridol, geldanamycin, 17-(allylamino)-17-<br>
demethoxygeldanamycin, ecteinascidin 743, phthalascidin, CT-2584 (1-(11-<br>
(dodecylamino)-10-hydroxyundecyl)-3,7-dimethylxanthine, CT-4582 (1-(1 l-(N-methyl<br>
N-dodecyl amino)-10-hydroxyundecyl)-3,7-dimethylxanthine), doxorubicin,<br>
adriamycinone, melphalan, fludarabine, daunomycin, verapamil, 5-fluorouraci],FUDR,<br>
cyclosporin, retinoic acids and others.<br>
The therapeutic agent must be capable of attachment to the polymer by means of a<br>
functional group that is already present in the native molecule or otherwise can be<br>
introduced by well-known procedures in synthetic organic chemistry without altering the<br>
activity of the agent, to the examples given herein, the agent is relatively water-insoluble<br>
in the unconjugated form and shows greatly improved solubility following conjugation.<br>
However, water-soluble drugs are also expected to show advantages following their<br>
conjugation to polyglutamic acid (e.g., improved pharmacokinetics and retention at the<br>
site of action compared to the unconjugated agent).<br>
Reactions performed under "standard coupling conditions" are carried out in an<br>
inert solvent (e.g., DMF, DMSO, N-methylpyrrolidone) at a temperature from -20°C to<br>
150°C, preferably from 0°C to 70°C, more preferably from 5°C to 30°C, in the presence<br>
of a coupling reagent and a catalyst. Of course, the temperature used will depend on<br>
factors such as the stability of the therapeutic agent and the reactivity of the attaching<br>
group. Suitable coupling reagents are well-known in synthetic organic chemistry and<br>
include, but are not limited to, carbodiimides, alkyl cbloroformate and triethylamine,<br>
pyridinium salts-tributyl amine, phenyl dichlorophosphate, 2-choro-l,3,5-trinitrobenzene<br>
and pyridine, di-2-pyridyl carbonate, polystyryl diphenylphosphine,<br>
(trimethylsilyl)ethoxyacetylene, 1,1' -carbonylbis(3-methylimidazolium)triflate,<br>
diethylazodicarboxylate and triphenyl phosphine, N,N' carbonyldiimidazole,<br>
methanesulphonyl chloride, pivaloyl chloride, and the like. Suitable catalysts for alcohol<br>
coupling include, e.g., 4-N.N dimethylaminopyridine and 4-pyrollidinopyridine.<br>
As used herein, the term "inert solvent" means a solvent inert under the conditions<br>
of the reaction being described in conjunction therewith [including, for example, benzene,<br>
toluene, acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran ("THF'), dimethylformamide ("DMP'), chloroform<br>
("CHCI3"), methylene chloride (or dichloromethane or "CH2C12"), diethyl ether, ethyl<br>
acetate, acetone, methylethyl ketone, dioxane, pyridine, dimethoxyethane, t-butyl methyl<br>
Attorney Docket No. 1402<br>
ether, and the like]. Unless specified to the contrary, the solvents used in the reactions of<br>
the present invention are inert solvents.<br>
If multiple functional groups are present on the therapeutic agent, selective<br>
attachment of a particular group of the agent to the polyglutamic acid polymer will<br>
require the use of a suitable protecting group. The term "protecting group" or "blocking<br>
group" refers to any group which when bound to one or more hydroxyl, thiol, amino or<br>
carboxyl groups of the compounds prevents reactions from occurring at these groups and<br>
which protecting group can be removed by conventional chemical or enzymatic steps to<br>
reestablish the hydroxyl, thiol, amino or carboxyl group. See, generally, T.W. Greene &amp;<br>
P.G.M. Wuts "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis," 3rd Ed, 1999 , John Wiley and<br>
Sons, N.Y.<br>
The particular removable blocking group employed is not critical and preferred<br>
removable hydroxyl blocking groups include conventional substituents such as allyl,<br>
benzyl, acetyl, chloroacetyl, thiobenzyl, benzylidine, phenacyl, t-butyl-diphenylsilyl,<br>
t-butyldimethylsilyl, triethylsilyl, MOM (methoxymethyl), MEM (2-<br>
methoxyethoxymethyl) and any other group that can be introduced chemically onto a<br>
hydroxyl functionality and later selectively removed either by chemical or enzymatic<br>
methods in mild conditions compatible with the nature of the product.<br>
Preferred removable amino blocking groups include conventional substituents<br>
such as t-butyoxycarbonyl (t-BOC), benzyloxycarbonyl (CBZ),<br>
fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (FMOC), allyloxycarbonyl (ALOC) and the like, which can be<br>
removed by conventional conditions compatible with the nature of the product.<br>
Preferred carboxyl protecting groups include esters such as methyl, ethyl, propyl,<br>
t-butyl etc. which can be removed by mild hydrolysis conditions compatible with the<br>
nature of the product.<br>
Nomenclature<br>
Exemplary conjugates prepared according to the embodiments of the invention<br>
described herein are shown in Figure 1. The conjugates in the Examples below are<br>
named in the same way as the conjugates of Figure 1.<br>
Description of Preferred Embodiments<br>
In general, the process of manufacturing polyglutamate-therapeutic agent<br>
conjugates on a scale that is suitable for clinical development and pharmaceutical use<br>
comprises the steps of:<br>
(a) providing the protonated form of a polyglutamic acid polymer and a<br>
therapeutic agent for conjugation thereto;<br>
(b) covalently linking said agent to said polyglutamic acid polymer in an inert<br>
organic solvent to form a polyglutamic acid-therapeutic agent conjugate;<br>
(c) precipitating said polyglutamic acid-therapeutic agent conjugate from solution<br>
by addition of an excess volume of aqueous salt solution; and<br>
(d) collecting said conjugate as a protonated solid.<br>
The protonated form of the polyglutamic acid polymer in step (a) is obtained by<br>
acidifying a solution containing the salt of the polyglutamic acid to be used as a starting<br>
material, and converting the salt to its acid form. After separating the solid by<br>
centrifugation, the solid is washed with water. (When DMAP is to be used in step (b), it<br>
is preferred to wash the solid until the aqueous phase is pH 3 or greater). The<br>
polyglutamic acid is then dried, preferably by lyophilization and preferably to a constant<br>
weight comprising between 7% and 21% of water, prior to conjugation to a desired<br>
therapeutic agent (step (b)).<br>
The therapeutic agent of step (b) may require modification prior to conjugation,<br>
e.g., the introduction of a new functional group, the modification of a preexisting<br>
functional group or the attachment of a spacer molecule. Such modifications may require<br>
the use of protecting groups, which are described above.<br>
Attorney Docket No. 1402<br>
Reaction schemes I-HI illustrate methods that were used for linking various<br>
exemplary therapeutic agents to poly-L-glutamic acid (PG), either directly or through<br>
glycine spacer molecules. The conditions shown in these schemes and described in the<br>
Examples may be varied, as will be readily appreciated by those skilled in synthetic<br>
organic chemistry. As noted previously, the exact conditions that are used for conjugating<br>
a particular therapeutic agent to polyglutamic acid may be based on the stability of the<br>
therapeutic agent to the reaction conditions, the reactivity of the linking groups, other<br>
factors pertinent to the manufacturing process (e.g., safety and regulatory issues), and the<br>
like. As described previously, various types of linkages may be used in preparing the<br>
conjugates, depending on the functional groups on the therapeutic agent and the spacer<br>
molecule, if a spacer is used. Thus the therapeutic agent may be conjugated to<br>
polyglutamic acid and/or spacer molecules by linkages other than ester and amide bonds.<br>
Spacers other than glycine, and coupling reagents other than those exemplified herein,<br>
can also be used. The exact conditions used for preparing the conjugates that illustrate<br>
the practice of embodiments of the present invention are described below in the<br>
Examples.<br>
In step (c), an aqueous salt solution is added to the reaction mixture to precipitate<br>
the polyglutamic acid-therapeutic agent conjugate from solution. Any water soluble<br>
inorganic salt can be used for this purpose (e.g., NaCl, KC1, NH4C1, sodium sulfate,<br>
ammonium sulfate, etc.). Preferably, 10-15% salt solution is used in lx-4x volume. In<br>
one preferred embodiment, a 2.5x volume of 10% NaCl is used. The salt solution is<br>
added slowly to the reaction mixture, which is cooled during the addition. For optimum<br>
yield of conjugate, the temperature is preferably kept between 0°C and 10°C. The<br>
precipitation step separates the polyglutamic acid-therapeutic agent conjugate from<br>
starting materials and reaction byproducts that are wholly or partially soluble under the<br>
conditions used for precipitation of the conjugate.<br>
In step (d), the conjugate is collected as the protonated solid. The suspension<br>
obtained in step (c) is preferablyacidified. Depending on the stability of the drug<br>

i i<br>
molecule to acid conditions, a pH in the range of pH 1- 4 can be used. For preparation of<br>
polyglutamic acid-paclitaxel conjugates, however, acidification below pH 2 results in the<br>
decomposition of paclitaxel, and acidification is typically carried out at about pH 2.5.<br>
Preferably, for the removal of DMAP, HC1 is used in step (d). The suspension can be<br>
filtered or centrifuged, preferably filtered, to collect the conjugate.<br>
Unreacted starting materials, byproducts and other impurities can be removed<br>
prior to, or after acidification to yield the final protonated conjugate (illustrated in<br>
Examples 2 and 3 below, and Figs 2 and 4). For example, after addition of the salt<br>
solution, the solid can be collected and resolubilized, then either filtered or extracted with<br>
an appropriate solvent in which the contaminants are soluble but the conjugate is not<br>
(e.g., ethyl acetate). The solution is then acidified and the protonated form of the<br>
conjugate is collected as described above.<br>
Alternatively, the solid can be lyophilized, then slurried with an appropriate<br>
solvent, e.g., acetonitrile(MeCN), to remove impurities from the final protonated<br>
conjugate product.<br>
In an alternative preferred embodiment, step (c) above is replaced by step (c1),<br>
which comprises:<br>
(c') separating said polyglutamic acid-therapeutic agent conjugate from unreacted<br>
starting materials and byproducts and precipitating said polyglutamic acid-therapeutic<br>
agent conjugate from solution by addition of an organic solvent in which unreacted<br>
starting materials and byproducts are soluble.<br>
In addition to ethyl acetate and acetonitrile, examples of other solvents that can be<br>
used to purify the conjugate include chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, toluene, 2-<br>
butylmethyl ether, and the like.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
In the following examples, the intermediates in the production of the conjugates<br>
were characterized by 'NMR. The molecular weights of the polyglutamic acid (Na salt)<br>
used to prepare the conjugates exemplified below ranged from 20kd to 50 kd, as specified<br>
by the supplier (Sigma) based on viscosity measurements. The average loading density of<br>
the conjugates was 37%.<br>
Example 1. Preparation of poly-L-glutamic acid<br>
Poly-L-glutamic acid sodium salt (85.9 g) (Sigma Chemical Co., 37kd MW<br>
determined by viscosity measurement) was dissolved in USP purified water (534 mL; 6.2<br>
mL/gm), and the solution was cooled to between (0oC- 5° C. Dilute hydrochloric acid<br>
solution (1M) was added dropwise with vigorous stirring keeping the temperature 
Attorney Docket No. 1402<br>
until the pH was between pH 2-2.5. During the addition, the poly-L-glutamic acid<br>
separated out of solution. The reaction mixture was warmed to room temperature and<br>
stirred for 1 hour. The suspension was centrifuged at 2700 x g for 10 minutes. The upper<br>
aqueous layer was removed and the solid was resuspended in 560 ml USP purified water<br>
and recentrifuged for 10 minutes. The upper aqueous layer was removed and the pH was<br>
measured. Washing was continued if necessary until the pH of the aqueous layer was &gt;<br>
3.0. The wet solid was lyophilized on a Labconco freeze dry system until a constant<br>
weight was obtained. The wt % sodium was no greater than 7000 ppm as determined by<br>
ICP.<br>
Example 2. Preparation of poly-L-glutamic acid-2'-paclitaxel conjugate<br>
Poly-L-glutamic acid (16.82 g), prepared as described in Example 1 above, was<br>
suspended in anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (180 mL), paclitaxel (9.923 g, 11.6<br>
mmol) and N,N-dimethylaminopyridine (283 mg, 2.32 mmol). The reaction mixture was<br>
stirred for 30 minutes. A solution of N,N-diisopropylcarbodiimide (1.903 g, 15.08<br>
mmol) in N,N-dimethylformamide (50 mL) was added over a period of 3 hours using a<br>
syringe pump. After the addition, the reaction was stirred until complete (about 4 hours<br>
at room temperature). The reaction was cooled to 5°C -10 °C and 10% sodium chloride<br>
solution (345 mL) was added slowly to precipitate out the poly-L-glutamic acid-<br>
paclitaxel conjugate. The precipitate was separated by transferring the mixture to a<br>
centrifuge flask and centrifuging it at 1500 g. The wet solid was resuspended in water<br>
(150 mL) and 1 M sodium bicarbonate solution (120 mL) was added slowly with<br>
vigorous stirring to bring the pH of the solution to pH 7. The reaction was stirred for an<br>
hour and filtered through a 0.2 micron filter to remove impurities. The filtrate was cooled<br>
to 0°C - 5° C and HC1 (IN) was added slowly with vigorous stirring until the pH of the<br>
solution was brought to pH 3. Stirring was continued for 30 minutes. The precipitated<br>
solid was centrifuged at 1500 g, and the wet solid was washed twice by suspending in<br>
water (150 mL) and centrifuging. The product was lyophilized to yield 24 g of poly-L-<br>
glutamic acid-paclitaxel conjugate (90% yield).<br>

In the above procedure, the filtration step can be omitted by washing the solution<br>
with ethyl acetate (250 ml, 2x) to remove impurities.<br>

Example 3. Preparation of poly-L-glutamic acid-2'-paclitaxel conjugate<br>
(manufacturing process)<br>
Poly-L-glutamic acid (42 g), prepared as described in Example 1 above, was<br>
added to a three-necked three liter round bottom flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer,<br>
addition funnel and a thermo probe. N, N-dimethylformamide (350 ml) was added and<br>
stirred for 10 minutes. Paclitaxel (24.66 g) and N,N-dimethyIaminopyridine (0.70 g) was<br>
added and stirred for 10 minutes. A solution of N, N-diisopropylcarbodiimide (4.73 g) in<br>
N, N-dimethylformamide (143 ml) was added at room temperature over a period of 1 hr<br>
using the addition funnel and was stirred for four hours. The reaction mixture was cooled<br>
to 5cC-10 ° C and a cooled solution of 10% sodium chloride (1.2 L) was added dropwise<br>
using the addition funnel and keeping the temperature at 5°C-10°C by cooling the flask in<br>
an ice-salt mixture. After the addition of sodium chloride solution, IN solution of<br>
hydrochloric acid (35 ml) was added dropwise until the pH of the reaction reached 2.5.<br>
The reaction mixture was stirred for 30 minutes at 5°C-10°C and the precipitated poly-L-<br>
glutamic acid-paclitaxel conjugate was collected by filtration. The solids were washed<br>
three times with water and freeze dried in a lyophilizer for 24 hours. The dried solid was<br>
powdered into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle. The finely powdered poly-L-<br>
glutamic acid -paclitaxel conjugate was suspended in acetonitrile (1000 ml) and stirred<br>
for 2 hrs, then filtered and the solid was washed with 2 x 200 ml of acetonitrile. The solid<br>
was dried under vacuum for 24 hrs to give poly-L-glutamic acid-paclitaxel conjugate (60<br>
g). Yield (90%).<br>

Example 7. Biological Assay<br>
Antitumor activity was assayed in mice implanted subcutaneously with Lewis<br>
lung carcinoma cells (LL/2). Tumors were produced in the muscle of the right<br>
interscapular region by subcutaneously injecting 2.5 x 105 murine Lewis Lung (LL/2)<br>
carcinoma cells (ATTC CRL-1642) in a volume of 0.25 ml PBS + 2% FBS. Test<br>
compounds and vehicle control were injected ip 7 days after tumor cell implantation<br>
when the tumors had grown to 20 ± 20 mm3 (average of 230 tumors). A single dose of<br>
polyglutamic acid-therapeutic agent conjugate in 0.1 N Na2HP04 was administered at a<br>
lx-4x the maximum tolerated equivalent dose of the unconjugated agent, which was<br>
typically administered in 8.3% cremophore EL/8.3% ethanol in 0.75% saline. Each<br>
treatment group consisted of 10 mice randomly allocated to each group. Initially, tumor<br>
growth was monitored every 3 to 4 days. When tumor sizes approached the arbitrarily set<br>
upper limit of 2500 mm3, tumor sizes were determined daily. Tumor volume was<br>
calculated according to the formula (length x width x height)/2. Mice with tumors equal<br>
to or greater than 2500 mm3 were euthanized by cervical dislocation. Efficacy of the<br>
various treatments was expressed in terms of days for tumor to reach a volume of 2500<br>
mm3 (i.e., TGD, tumor growth delay) compared with maximum tolerated dose of the<br>
unconjugated therapeutic agent.<br>
The PG-therapeutic agent conjugates described in Examples 2, 3, 5 and 6 above<br>
were tested and found to be active in this assay.<br>
