Mumbai 400 001 Maharashtra, India<br>
PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner<br>
in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the conditioned air distribution ducts used for demisting and defrosting of vehicles and more particularly it relates to the defrost air distribution system for vehicles.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
The conventionally known distribution ducts are meant for guiding the hot air onto the windshield and side window of the vehicle. Air distribution is desired in automotive vehicles in order to direct conditioned air coming out of heating, ventilation and air conditioning unit (HVAC) of the vehicles. The conditioned air is directed towards the windshield and the side window glasses using the distribution system. The purpose of directing hot air generated by HVAC to the windshield is to clear the mist formed from inside the vehicles during rainy season and to clear ice on the outside of the windshield during colder seasons. Rear view mirror visibility is also a concern while driving and a part of heated air from HVAC is directed towards the side window glasses in order to clear the rear view mirror visibility zones.<br>
One of the prior art 'US 5113748' structure for hot air distribution is shown in Figure- 1 and 2. In figure-1 shown is the HVAC unit 1 comprising of a heater core inside, 3 is the HVAC outlet for hot air. The inlet 2 of the distribution system 20 is mounted over the HVAC outlet 3. The distribution system 20 comprises of left and right sections 22 and 22 for front windshield defrost and side ducts 25 and 25 for side glass window defrost. The left and right sections 22 and 22 are used to direct hot air from HVAC outlet 3 to the windshield. The inlet 21 of the distribution system is divided into three parts 21a, 24 and 21 a. 21a and 21a are the inlets for left and right sections (22, 22) and placed on the opposite ends of inlet 21 along the vehicle width direction. The left and right<br><br><br>
section (22,22) has a gap 23 on the instrument panel for providing a mounting 15 on the instrument panel. The side ducts (25,25) are disposed under the recessed portion 23 on HVAC outlet 3.<br>
The inlet 24 for side ducts (25,25) is placed centrally between 21a and 21a for directing air to side ducts 25 and 25. Side ducts (25, 25) are integrated within major body 20 along vehicle width direction in such a way that they carry conditioned air from inlet 24 to the side window glasses for demist/defrost action. At the longitudinal centre of inlet 24 a wedge shaped air flow guide 28 (refer Figure 3) is provided to divide flow for left and right side ducts. In figure 1, 30 indicate the brackets used for mounting the distribution system inside instrument panel of the vehicle.<br>
With this construction the hot air 'a' flows from the HVAC unit (1) to the HVAC outlet (3) and supplied to the inlet 21 of the distribution system '20' where it gets distributed at inlet 21a, 21a for front windshield sections 22,22 and at inlet 24 for side ducts. At inlet 24, hot air again gets divided by the wedge for left and right side ducts (25, 25) and directed to not shown extendable ducts for side window panels.<br>
The flow from inlet (21a, 21a) passes through the sections 22, 22 without any diversions against the windshield and the flow can clear the windshield zones that lie in the projection of outlets at sections 22, 22. So it renders the invention to be specific or limited to one particular vehicle application where the gap 23 is not considerable.<br>
The direction of flow from section 22, 22 is shown by arrows al and al. Quite clearly the construction predicts that the flow would be clearing the central portion of windshield effectively in this embodiment but it does not address regarding the variations of the said gap 23 depending on the space and<br><br><br>
packaging requirement due to styling constraints of instrument panel for different versions of vehicles. This disadvantage makes the usage of this construction very specific and not feasible in a variety of vehicle constructions.<br>
Apart from this the construction of the prior art invention is acquiring more space in the longitudinal vehicle direction as the side ducts 25,25 are placed behind the front defroster ducts 22,22. This makes it complex to use due to space constraints in vehicles.<br>
OBJECT OF INVENTION<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide defrost air distribution system for vehicles.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide defrost air distribution system for vehicles which clears the windshield in less time.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide the defrost air distribution system of vehicles which combines windshield demist / defrost system as well as side window demist/defrost systems.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide defrost air distribution system for vehicles, which guides the flow of air using integrated baffles to the windshield target zone including central zone of windshield.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide defrost air distribution system for vehicles where division of airflow towards side ducts happens inside the HVAC unit by using a baffles integral with the major body.<br><br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring now to the drawings wherein the showings are for the purpose of illustrating a preferred embodiment of the invention only, and not for the purpose of limiting the same,<br>
Now referring to Figure 4 to 8 , defrost air distribution system comprises; HVAC unit(l), major body (3) which is mounted on said HVAC unit (1) and mounting means (5), said major body comprises air inlet(2), left portion and right portion (3', 3') separated by gap (6), front windshield inlet (9),wherein each said portions comprises front windshield outlets(4,4), side ducts(7,7),side duct inlets(8,8), first group of baffles( 11,11) and second group of baffles (12,12).<br>
The said air inlet (2) of distribution system is placed along the lateral direction of the vehicle i.e. the vehicle width direction. The said major body (3) has left and right portions (3', 3,) elongated along the opposite vehicle width direction. The said portions are used for directing conditioned air to the windshield. The said portions comprises combined front windshield inlet (9), individual front windshield outlets (4, 4) and second group of baffles (12,12) all placed along the lateral vehicle direction. The said outlets (4, 4) are separated by a gap (6) on the instrument panel (13) for styling and packaging purpose and to provide mountings means     (5)     for    this     construction    inside    instrument panel   (13).   The<br><br><br>
construction of said major body (3) is V-shaped in the gap (6) so that the flow from said inlet (9) gets divided for the said left and right portions of major body (3).<br>
The said side ducts (7,7) are placed below the said major body (3) and extended along the opposite vehicle width direction and thus the space occupied by this construction in the longitudinal vehicle direction is much less than that provided by the prior art construction. Wherein each said left and right portions of said major body (3) comprises divergent cross section and said front windshield outlet (4,4) are oblong hollow channel cross section. Said side ducts (7, 7) are having hollow cross section.<br>
Wherein each said left and right portions of said major body (3) comprises mounting means (5) for mounting said major body. Said mounting means (5) are provided in the said gap (6) between said left and right portions of said major body (3). Said first group of baffles (11,11) and second group of baffles (12,12) are fixed baffles and integral with the said major body.<br>
The hot air flow 'c' from the said HVAC unit (1) flows to the said air inlet (2) of the said major body (3) where it gets divided for said side ducts (7 and 7) and said front windshield outlets (4 , 4). The air flow for said side ducts (7,7) gets divided inside the HVAC unit (1) by the first group of baffle (11, 11) as the ends of said baffles (11,11) are slightly inside the said HVAC unit. This arrangement ensures that a considerable flow of conditioned air is diverted towards the said side ducts (7, 7). The flow of conditioned air coming out of said side ducts (7, 7) is denoted by c" and c". This flow of conditioned air is then supplied to not shown extendable ducts so that it reaches the target visibility zones of rear view mirror on vehicle front door glass windows.<br><br><br>
The side ducts inlets are denoted as inlets (8, 8). The said inlets (8, 8) lie on the opposite side of said front windshield inlet (9) for front windshield flow along the lateral vehicle width direction.<br>
In prior art invention inlet 24 is used for supplying air to side ducts 25,25 and is in between 21a, 21a inlets for defroster nozzles whereas in present invention the front windshield inlet (9) is used for front windshield outlet (4,4) and side inlets (8,8) are used for said side ducts (7,7). The said inlets for side ducts (8, 8) and said front windshield inlets (9) is just opposite to the respective inlets in the prior art construction.<br>
The main air flow path 'c' is divided at inlet (9) placed at the longitudinal centre of said inlet (2) and in between said inlets (8, 8) for side ducts. The said inlet (9) is for front windshield flow from said outlets (4, 4). The front windshield outlets (4, 4) of said major body (3) are separated by a gap (6) for the styling and packaging and to provide mounting means (5) on the instrument panel (13) for the construction. Due to this gap (6) the flow tends to move away from the centre of windshield and creates a no flow zone at the centre of windshield. To prevent this, second group of baffles (12 ,12 ) are used inside the said major body (3) so that the conditioned air flow from front windshield inlet (9) gets further divided into sub paths by using baffles (12) inside said major body (3) in such a way that the conditioned air flow coming out (shown by arrows c' and c') of said front windshield outlets (4,4) covers the entire windshield effectively including the centre zone that does not lie in the path projection of outlets (4 ,4). The said second group of baffles (12,12) are integral with the said major body (3) and are positioned inside said major body (3) in such a way that the conditioned air flow coming out at windshield outlets ( 4,4) covers the entire windshield area including centre zone of windshield. The construction of the present invention differs heavily in this respect from prior art construction as in case of prior art the flow for the windshield goes<br><br><br>
without any diversions and the flow coming out can clear the projected zone of outlets only, whereas in present invention second group of baffles are used to direct the flow in such a way that it covers the entire windshield including centre zone.<br>
The flow direction shown by arrows c' and c' covers almost the entire part of windshield and thus results in a better and effective air flow distribution over the windshield as well as provide an efficient performance for demisting and defrosting of the windscreen in all the visibility zones. Apart from this the present invention is versatile enough to take care of the variations of the said gap (6) between said front windshield outlets (4, 4) on the said instrument panel (13). So this can be used on a variety of vehicle platforms in which the styling and packing constraints of instrument panel(13) are such that the said gap (6) is considerable enough and due to this the flow gets diverted towards the sides of the windshield creating a no flow zone at the centre.<br>
The foregoing description is a specific embodiment of the present invention. It should be appreciated that this embodiment is described for purpose of illustration only, and that numerous alterations and modifications may be practiced by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. It is intended that all such modifications and alterations be included insofar as they come within the scope of the invention as claimed or the equivalents thereof.<br><br>
