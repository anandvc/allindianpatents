3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
COMPLETE<br>
Following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
4. DESCRIPTION. Technical field of invention:<br>
The invention relates generally to direct current electrical linear motor and more specifically, this invention relates to electrical homopolar linear motor, which functions on DC voltage means acyclic direct current without a commutator.<br>
Use:<br>
An electrical homopolar linear motor provided in accordance with the present invention render significant advantages over prior electrical linear motors. The homopolar motor described hereinafter are capable of operating on higher D. C. voltages &amp; current without the need of a commutator and further because the armature and power carrying conductors being generally on the stator does not require power collection slip rings and brush gear, therefore the motor becomes simple, reliable and more power efficient compared to hitherto reported electrical linear motors.<br>
This type of motor have many application in linear actuator, solenoid valve actuator, electric traction, launcher and many more industrial, domestic, space application where ever linear force actuators are desired.<br>
These and other advantages will be more readily understood by referring to the following detailed description for a typical linear homopolar motor with reference to the accompanying drawings and which are generally applicable to other homopolar motor disclosed herein having typical armature and magnetic field arrangements to fulfill particular application illustrated hereinafter. <br>
Background of the invention:<br>
Electro-magnetic machine is classified by the purpose for which it is used, such as; for generating electrical energy from mechanical energy is known as "electrical generator," for converting electrical energy into mechanical energy is known as "electrical machine," and transforming electrical energy from one voltage-current level to other voltage-current levels is known as "electrical transformer." Further the electrical machine is classified on the basis of its mechanical motion such as; if the electrical machine operation is related to rotating mechanical motion then it is called a "rotating electrical machine," if its operation is related to linear mechanical motion it is called "electrical linear machine" and if there is no mechanical motion involved in its operation, then it is called "static machine" or "electrical transformer." As per famous Faraday induction law "Whenever the total net magnetic flux through a closed circuit varies there is a voltage induced in the circuit whose magnitude is proportional to the rate of change of the flux through the circuit so as to oppose the change." Whether acting as a generator, or a motor, or a transformer; electrical machines also known as electro-magnetic machines function because of a relative motion between electrical conductor and magnetic field and/or rate of change of magnetic flux linkage between electrical turns and magnetic field such that the magnetic field may be physically stationary and the electric conductors/turns traverse through it, or the electrical conductors/turns may be stationary and the magnetic field may traverse through them, or electrical turns may be stationery and the associated magnetic field, being time dependent, may vary through them. It is also possible for both the conductors/turns and the acyclic or cyclic magnetic field to be in a relative motion in functioning electro-magnetic machine.<br>
In case of a generator, the interaction due to relative motion between the electrical conductors/turns and the magnetic field produces an induced force, sometimes called "EMF" or voltage, and an associated current in the active conductors/turns. Conventionally magnetic fields are of two types that is north polarity generally known as "N" pole and south polarity known as "S" pole. An electro-magnetic machine, where magnetic fields are arranged in such a manner that electrical conductors/turns traverse through "N" pole and then "S" pole alternatively or in cyclic order, is called heteropole or multipole electrical machine. Generally, in such machines the electro-magnetic field (EMF) and current that are produced are cyclic or alternating in electrical polarity, and so sometimes a "commutator" is used to make the electrical current unidirectional in the external circuit of the electric machine; whereas an electro-magnetic machine, where magnetic fields or poles are arranged in such a manner that electrical conductors/turns traverse solely or acyclically through "N" pole or "S" pole, then it is called homopolar or unipolar electrical machine. The EMF and current that are produces are not alternating hence such machine does not have a "commutator" and these types of magnetic machines are sometimes also called "acyclic machines."<br>
In a electro-electrical machines, having "m" coaxial electrical conductors, the instantaneous EMF "E" induced in conductors, each having a length, "1", moving with a relative velocity, "v", within and perpendicular to a magnetic flux density, 'B', is generally expressed as: E = B.l.v.m,<br>
which is the well-known Faraday induction Jaw for the relative motion between the electrical conductors and magnetic flux.<br>
A generalized voltage induction equation, applicable to all types of electrical machines including a homopolar machine, is expressed by Faraday/Lenz law of induction as:<br>
E= -dФ/dt + B.l.v.m, Where (J) is the magnetic flux, which may be dependent in time, And Ф = B.A where "A" is the area of the magnet.<br>
Because of the construction of typical homopolar motors, the turns/conductors on the armature are always adapted to interact with magnetic flux in the same direction whence voltage "E" due to a change of flux linkage associated with such interaction can be explained by:<br>
E= -n.(dФ/dt),<br>
Where dФ/dt is rate of change of flux and n.(dФ/dt) is rate of change of flux linkage associated with 'n' turns. It will be readily recognized by those with skill in the art that a machine where there exists a constant rate of change of flux linkage will generate a constant DC or acyclic voltage. See, e.g., L. V. Bewley, Flux linkages and Electromagnetic Induction, Chapter IV. p. 21. The Macmillan Company, 1952.<br>
For the machine under disclosure, the induced EMF can be expressed as:<br>
E= -n.(dФ/dt) = -n.A.(dB/dt) =-n.A.B.u,<br>
Where "A " is the area of magnet and "u" is the rate of relative displacement per unit time, may be it an angular or a linear displacement/motion. Due to the typical arrangements of the proposed homopolar machine, the generated EMF and the current flow are steady and in the same direction at all the time which eliminates the need of a commutator and which further avoids the difficulties which arise from reactance voltages.<br>
Problem to be solved:<br>
With the hitherto reported homopolar machines, where the lengths of several individual conductors are usually short due to mechanical constraints, only low voltages and high currents can be reproduced. Thus, such homopolar machines have had low DC voltage ratings of 2 to3 volts at high current of the order of 4000 to 6000 amps, for example. Similar homopolar machines producing higher voltages have been reported using multiple conductors, each connected by pair of current collecting slip rings with external brush-gear and it has been found to be far more difficult to collect current satisfactorily from multiple slip rings apart from being inefficient, hence not preferred in industrial application. By a novel arrangement of conductors <br>
and magnetic pole arrangement the described motors operates at higher DC voltage which will be more clear as we go through further details.<br>
Solution provided by present invention:<br>
The proposed electrical homopolar linear motor works within the principles of Faraday induction law and provides a simple solution to above mentioned problems since it operates on wide range of acyclic voltage and current and dispenses with interpole, compensating winding, commutator, brush-gear and power semiconductor devices with associated electronic control.<br>
Object:<br>
The primary object of this invention is to provide an electrical linear homopolar motor which is capable to operate on wide range of acyclic voltage and dispenses with interpole, compensating winding, commutator, brush-gear and power semiconductor devices with associated electronic control..<br>
Further object of this invention is to provide an electrical linear homopolar motor in which armature and power carrying conductors being generally on the stator does not require power collection slip rings and brush gear, therefore the motor becomes simple, reliable and more power efficient compared to hitherto reported electrical linear motors.<br>
Another object of present invention is to provide a device which can satisfactorily work within the principle of faraday induction law and therefore provide simple solution to problems faced by present homopolar motors.<br>
Other objects, features and advantages will become apparent from the detail description and appended claims to those skilled in the art.<br>

magnetic shunts and the remaining portion of the magnetic flux passes through remaining section of the armature sector to the remaining yoke or magnetic shunt and then the magnetic fluxes return in the same manner through the sections of another identically placed armature sector of other parallel and coaxial armature bars and then magnetic flux returns through air gap back to the excitation system and so when the plunger traverses through the stator, each armature sectors assembly is substituted one after another or sequentially by the magnetic pole shoe pair with associated flux and during such operation, the armature sector assembly magnetic circuit gets divided into two magnetic circuits on either side of the plunger and due to the geometry of the magnetic circuit at that instant, the distribution of the magnetic flux depends upon the relative position of the exciter on plunger with respect to armature sectors assembly, means the shorter section of the armature sectors assembly, comprising armature sector therein, generally carries more flux as compared to the longer section of armature sector therefore when pole shoe pair traverses through the armature sector assembly, the relative position between armature sector and e keeps oiterxcn changing thereby causing a change of flux linkage between armature coil comprising conductor turns and the magnetic flux of pole shoe pair and since the rate of change of flux linkage is a function of relative velocity of stator and rotor, mechanical force is created in each armature sector assembly coil, and therefore the electrical homopolar linear motor can produce direct mechanical force when in operation.<br>
6. The electrical homopolar linear motor under disclosure as recited in claim 1 comprising plurality of armature sector assemblies arranged in the form of bars and plunger comprising magnetic poles disposed coaxially within the armature and while the movement of plunger, the plurality of armature sector assemblies means the magnetic circuits thereof, comprising armature conductors or coils, are periodically substituted by the magnetic flux of the magnetic poles thereby<br>
causing rate of change of flux linkages so that the electrical homopolar linear motor can produce direct force when in operation.<br>
