FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a class of compounds that potently inhibit in vivo and hi vitro production of TNF-α. Also this invention relates to the therapeutic utility of such compounds or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof in inflammatory and imrnunological disorders mediated through TNF-α.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine discovered decades ago. TNF-α is produced by diverse types of cells in response to inflammatory and immunological stimuli. [Trends Cell. Biol. vol 5, 392-399 (1995)] For example, monocytes treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) significantly increases the production of TNF-α. Although TNF-a was also known to shrink tumors through apoptosis, it plays a central role in inflammation and immunology.<br>
Abundant presence of TNF-α has been observed in a variety of immunological disorders including but not limited to rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, eczema, Crohn's disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), sepsis, endotoxin shock, multiple sclerosis, chronic hepatitis, and so on. [J. Med. Chem. vol 42, 2295-2314 (1999); Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. vol 153, 633-637 (1996); Lupus vol 11, 102-108 (2002); Hepatogastroenterology. vol 47, 1675-1679 (2000)]<br>
Blockade or neutralization of the TNF-α activity by a TNF-a monoclonal antibody has been found effective in treating immunological disorders including but not limited to rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease and psoriatic arthritis, as seen with the cases of infliximab (Remicade™) and adalimumab (Humrra™). [Remicade™ (infliximab) Prescribing Information. Centocor Inc. September 2005; Humira™ (adalimumab) Prescribing Information. Abbott Late October 2005.] Etanercept (Enbrel™) is a fusion protein with the decoy receptor part for TNF-a and therefore neutralizes the biological activity of TNF-a. Etanercept is<br><br>
indicated for rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing	spondylitis, psoriasis, and psoriatic<br>
arthritis   in   the  US.   [Enbrel™ (etanercept)	Prescribing  Information.   Immunex<br>
Corporation. July 2005.]   These protein drugs	are currently available by injectable<br>
formulations only.<br>
To date many biological targets are known to inhibit the cellular production of TNF-α. Pro-TNF-α is cleaved into the aetive soluble form of TNF-α by TNF-α converting enzyme (TACE). [Nature vol 385, 729-733 (1997)] Production .of TNF-α is decreased by an increase in the cytosolic level of cAMP. Since inhibition of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) increases the cytosolic level of cAMP, PDE4 inhibitors, such as rolipram, cilomilast and roflumilast, attenuate the production of TNF-α. [Curr. Pharm. Design vol 8, 1255-1296 (2002)] Adenosine receptor A2a is coupled with adenylate cyclase and its agonists, such as CGS21680 and NECA, inhibit the synthesis of TNF-α. [Drug Devel Res. vol 45, 103-112 (1998)] Kinases such as NIK, IKK, and PKB, which are involved in the signaling of NF-KB, are known to suppress the production of TNF-a if inhibited. IKK inhibitors such as BMS-345541 block phosphorylation on 1KB and inhibit the NFjcB-dependent transcription. [/. Biol. Chem. vol 278, 1450-1456 (2003)] 5-aminosalicylic acid is known to inhibit IKK. at therapeutically relevant dose for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). - Aspirin, a traditional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, is also known to inhibit IKK at high dose level. [Nature vol 396, 77-80 (1998)] Inhibition of MAP kinases such as p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (INK) suppresses the TNF-a production. - p38 inhibitors such as VX-745 and SB203580 inhibited TNF-a production in cells treated with LPS, and showed therapeutic effect in animal models for rheumatoid arthritis. [Curr. Opin. Investig. Drugs vol 5, 566-571 (2003)] Thalidomide is indicated for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), although thalidomide weakly inhibits the synthesis of TNF-α at cellular level. It appears that thalidomide destabilizes TNF-α mRNA to decrease the TNF-α production. [Clin. Exp. Immunol. vol 110, 151-154 (1997)] Steroids also potently inhibit production of TNF-α. [/. Exp. Med. vol 172, 391-394 (1990)]<br>
Reflecting that TNF-a plays a central role in inflammation and immunology, agents inhibiting the biological activity or production of TNF-α-are expected to show therapeutic effect in a variety of disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, atopic dermatitis, inflammatory bowel disease including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, ankylosing spondylitis, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), sepsis, endotoxin shock, hepatitis, Type I diabetes, and so on. Some types of agents were found more<br>
effective for some disorders than others, depending on the mode of action and their physiochemical properties. PDE4 inhibitors such as roflumilast and cilomilast, for example, have been heavily developed for COPD. On the other hand, anti-TNF-α biologies were initially indicated for rheumatoid arthritis, and their indications are expanding to include ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, and Crohn's disease. 5-aminosalicylic acid and sulfasalazine are used to treat moderate to mild inflammatory bowel disease, while steroids and anti-TNF-α biologies are indicated for severe cases. There have been attempts to treat inflammatory bowel disease using PDE4 inhibitors. [Am. Rev. Med. Cliem. vol 38,141-152 (2003)] Although p38 inhibitors such as VX-702 were evaluated for human rheumatoid arthritis, their therapeutic utility remains to be established for MAP Kinase inhibitors. [Curr. Opin. Drug Discov. Devel. vol 8, 421-430 (2005)] Steroids are initially effective for diverse kinds of immunological disorders, however, their long term use is strongly limited due to adverse events.<br>
Although anti-TNF-a biologies such as infliximab, adalimumab and etanercept are widely used to treat immunological disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, these protein drugs are doomed to be expensive and administered by injection. In this regard, small molecules inhibiting the action or production of TNF-α are in strong demand due to cost and convenience of avoiding injection.<br>

Terms and abbreviations used in this invention are illustrated in Table 1. Table 1.    Definition of the terms and abbreviations used in the present invention.<br>

Synthesis of Compounds of Formula I<br>
Compounds of Formula I are prepared as summarized in scheme 1, in which RI and Ra are as defined for Formula I. In some cases, there are minor modifications applied during executions of scheme 1, and these modifications are considered to be obvious to a skilled person and are provided where applicable.<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
2-cyclopenten-l-one derivative A is halogenated by treatment of a halogen complex of either triethylamine or pyridine in carbon tetrachloride to yield 2-halo cyclopenten-1-one B. [Tetrahedron Lett, vol 33, 917-920 (1992)] Suzuki coupling of the halide compound with an aromatic boronic acid afforded the coupling product C, which is then condensed into a compound of Formula .1 by reacting with hydroxylamine hydrochloride in pyridine. [Chem. Rev. vol 95, 2457-2483 (1995)]<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
2-cyclopenten-l-one derivative A of scheme 1 is prepared by three different methods as described in scheme 2. In one method, an alkyl or cycloalkyl metal (M = Li, MgBr or MgCl) reagent is added to 2-cyclopenten-l-one, and the resulting allylic alcohol is subjected to oxidative rearrangement using pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) to afford a 2-cyclopenten-l-one derivative A. [Tetrahedron Lett, vol 30, 1033-1036<br>
 (1989)] Another method is to react either 3-ethoxy-2-cyclopenten-l-one or 3-methoxy-2-cyclopenten-l-one with an alkyl or cycloalkylmetal (M = Li, MgBr or MgCl) reagent and to convert the resulting adduct to the 2-cyclopenten-l-one derivative A by treating with hydrochloric acid. [J. Am. Chem. Soc. vol 110, 4625-4633 (1988)] In the third method, 1,4-addition of an alkyl or cycloalkyl cuprate to the 3-alkoxy-2-cyclopenten-1-one is facilitated by trimethylsilyl chloride (TMSC1) in the presence of hexamethyl phosphoramide (HMPA), and the resulting adduct is converted to the 2-cyclopenten-1-one derivative A by treating with hydrochloric acid. [Tetrahedron vol 45, 349-362 (1989)]<br>
Alternatively, compounds of Formula I are also prepared as described in scheme 3, where key intermediate cyclopenten-1-one derivative C is obtained by an intermolecular Pauson-Khand reaction between alkyne D and ethylene. [Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. vol 39, 636-638 (2000) and references therein] Alkyne D is synthesized by a palladium catalyzed coupling of alkyne and aryl halide. [CJiem. Rev.-vol 103, 1979-2017 (2003)] The Pauson-Khand reaction of alkyne D is effected under high pressure carbon monoxide and ethylene in the presence of a non-stoichiometric amount of dicobalt octacarbonyl and dimethylsulfoxide as a promoter. Cyclopentenone C is then converted to a compound of Formula I according to scheme 1.<br>
