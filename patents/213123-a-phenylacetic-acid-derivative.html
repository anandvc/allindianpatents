Moreover, the invention relates to processes and intermediates for the preparation of these compounds and to compositions com¬prising them for controlling animal pests and harmful fungi.<br><br>
Phenylacetic acid derivatives for use in pest control have al¬ready been disclosed in the literature (EP-A 422 597, EP-A 463 488, EP-A 370 629, EP--A 460 575, EP-A 472 300, WO-A 90/07,493, WO-A 92/13,830, WO-A 92/18,487, WO-A 95/18,789, WO-A 95/21,153, WO-A 95/21,154).<br>
It was an object of the present invention to provide novel com¬pounds having an improved action.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by the phenylacetic acid derivatives I defined at the outset. Moreover, we have found processes and intermediates for their preparation, as well as compositions comprising them for controlling animal pests and harmful fungi and their use for this purpose.<br>
The compounds I can be obtained by various routes by processes known per se from the literature.<br>
In principle, it is irrelevant when synthesizing the compounds I whether the group -C(X)-COYR1 or the group<br><br>
is constructed first.<br>
The construction of the group -C(X)-CO2R- is disclosed, for example, in the literature cited at the outset.<br>
1. To synthesize the compounds of the formula I, a procedure is generally followed in which a benzyl derivative of the formu¬la II is reacted with a hydroxyimine of the formula III.<br><br><br>
L- in formula II is a nucleophilically exchangeable leaving group, eg. halogen or sulfonate groups, preferably chlorine, bromine, iodine, mesylate, tosylate or triflate.<br>
The reaction is carried out in a manner known per se in an inert organic solvent in the presence of a base, eg, sodium hydride, potassium hydroxide, potassiumn carbonate, and tri-ethylamine, following the methods described in Houben-Weyl, Vol. E 14b, p. 370 et seq. and Houben-Weyl, Vol. 10/1, p. 1189 et seq..<br>
The hydroxyimines III required are obtained, for example, as described in Equation 1 by a series of nitrosation, alkyla-tion and oximation reactions from appropriate carbonyl com¬pounds XIV.<br>
Equation 1<br><br><br>
Basic or acidic catalysis allows the a-keto-oxime XV to be prepared from the ketone XIV and an organic nitrite following the methods described in Houben--Weyl Vol. 10/4, p. 17 et seq. .<br><br>
The keto-oxime ether XVH which is required is obtained, for example, by reacting XV with a nucleophilically substituted reagent XVI,<br>
L- in formula XVI is a nucleophilically exchangeable leaving group, eg. halogen or sulfonate groups, preferably chlorine, bromine, iodine, mesylate, tosylate or triflate.<br>
The reaction is carried out in a manner known per se in an inert organic solvent in the presence of a base, eg» potas¬sium carbonate- potassium hydroxide, sodium hydride, tri-ethylamine and pyridine, following the methods described in Houben-Weyl, Vol. 14b p. 307 et seq., p. 370 et seq. and p. 385 et seq.; Houben-Weyl Vol. 10/4 p. 55 et seq., p. 180 et seq. and p. 217 et seq.; Houben-Weyl Vol. E5, p. 780 et seq.<br>
Basic or acidic catalysis allows the a--keto-oxime IV to be prepared from the ketone XVII and an organic nitrite follow¬ing the methods described in Houben-Weyl Vol. 10/4 p. 17 et seq. .<br><br><br>
The hydroxyimine III which is required is obtained, for exam¬ple/ by reacting an appropriate α-keto-oxime IV with an oxya-mine XVIIIa or a salt thereof XVIIIb. Q© in formula XVIIlb is the anion of an acid, in particular of an inorganic acid, eg. halide, such as chloride.<br>
The reaction is carried out in a manner known per se in an inert organic solvent following the methods described in EP-A 513 580; Houben-Weyl Vol, 10/4 p. 73 et seq.; Houben-Weyl Vol. E14b p. 369 et seq. and p. 385 et seq..<br>
L.l Alternatively, the compounds I can also be obtained by first reacting the benzyl derivative II with the carbonylhydroxy-imino derivative IV to give a corresponding benzyloxyimine of the formula V, and this is subsequently reacted with the hy-droxylamine Via or a salt thereof VIb to give I,<br><br><br>
The reaction is carried out in a manner known per se in an inert organic solvent following the methods described in Houben-Weyl, Vol. E 14b, p. 369 et seq,; Houben-Weyl, Vol. 10/1, p. 1189 et seq. and Houben-Weyl, Vol. 10/4, p. 73 et seq. or EP-A 513 580.<br>
.2 A further possibility for preparing the compounds I is to react the benzyl derivative II with N-hydroxyphthalimide fol¬lowed by hydrazinolysis to give the benzylhydroxylamine Ila and to further react Ila with a carbonyl compound VII.<br><br><br>
Compounds I are preferably obtained by first converting a compound IV with a lactone IX to give the corresponding ben¬zoic acid X, following the methods described in EP'-A 493 711, and converting X into the cyanocarboxylic acids XI via the corresponding halides, and these cyanocarboxylic acids XI are converted into the a-keto-esters XII via a Pinner reaction (Angew. Chem. 94, 1 (1982)) and the product is further reacted to the α-keto-amides XIII (cf. EP 348 766, DE 37 05 389, EP 178 826, DE 36 23 92; Houben-Weyl Vol. E5 p. 941 et seq,).<br><br><br><br>
The α-keto-esters XII and the α-keto-amides XIII can be converted into the compounds I by customary methods (cf. EP-A 178 926, EP-A 513 580, DE-A 36 23 921, EP-A 398 692).<br>
Compounds I where R- is hydrogen are obtained by this process by hydrolyzing the esters XV and subsequently reacting the product to give I.<br><br>
The compounds I where Y 'is NH can also be obtained from the corresponding esters (Y = O) by reacting them with amines of the formula R-NH2.<br>
Those compounds II which are not already known (EP-A 513 580, EP-A 477 631, EP-A 463 488, EP-A 251 082, EP 400 417, EP 585 751) can be prepared by the methods described in these publications.<br>
Due to their C=C and C=N double bonds, the compounds I may be ob¬tained from their preparation in the form of E/Z isomer mixtures which can be separated into the individual compounds in the cus¬tomary manner, for example by crystallization or chromatography.<br>
If isomer mixtures are obtained from the synthesis, it is, howev¬er, generally not absolutely necessary to separate them since the individual isomers can be converted into each other in some cases during formulation for use or upon use (for example under the ac¬tion of light, acid or bases). Analogous conversions can also take place after use, for exeimple in the treated plant when plants are treated, or in the harmful fungus or animal pest to be controlled.<br>
In relation to the C=X double bond, the E-isomers of the com¬pounds I are preferred with a view to their activity (configura¬tion based on the -OCH3 or the -CH3 group relative to the -CO2R-group).<br>
In relation to the -C(R3)=NOCH2- double bond, the cis-isomers of the compounds I are preferred with a view to their activity (configuration based on the radical R- relative to the -OCH2-group).<br>

The compounds I are suiTable for use as fungicides.<br>
The compounds I are distinguished by an outstanding activity against a wide spectrum of phytopathogenic fungi, in particular from the classes of the Ascomycetes, Phycomycetes and Basidiomy-cetes. Some of them act systemically and can therefore be employed in crop protection as foliar- and soil-acting fungi¬cides .<br>
They are especially important for controlling a large number of fungi in a variety of crop plants such as wheat, rye, barley, oats, rice, maize, grass, cotton, soybeans, coffee, sugar cane, grapevine, fruit species, ornamentals and vegeTable species such as cucumbers, beans and cucurbits, and in the seeds of these plants.<br>
They are particularly suiTable for controlling the following plant diseases: Erysiphe graminis (powdery mildew) in cereals, Erysiphe cichoracearum and Sphaerotheca fuliginea in cucurbits, Podosphaera leucotricha in apples, Uncinula necator in grapevines, Puccinia species in cereals, Rhizoctonia species in cotton, rice and lawns, Ustilago species in cereals and sugar cane, Venturia inaequalis (scab) in apples, Helminthosporium species in cereals, Septoria nodorum in wheat, Botrytis cinerea (gray mold) in strawberries, vegeTable species, ornamentals and grapevines, Cercospora arachidicola in groundnuts, Pseudo-cercosporella herpotrichoides in wheat and barley, Pyricularia oryzae in rice, Phytophthora infestans in potatoes and tomatoes, Fusarium and Verticillium species in a variety of plants, Plasmopara viticola in grapevines, Alternaria species in vegeTables and fruit.<br>
The compounds I are moreover suiTable for controlling harmful fungi in the protection of materials (eg. wood, paper, fibers or fabrics) and in the protection of stored products.<br><br>
The compounds I are used by treating the fungi, or the plants, seeds, materials or the soil to be protected against fungal in¬fection, with a fungicidally active amount of the active ingredi-ents. Application is effected before or after infection of the materials, plants or seeds by the fungi.<br>
They can be converted into the customary formulations, such as solutions, emulsions, suspensions, dusts, powders, pastes and granules. The use form depends on the intended purpose; in any -ase, it should ensure fine and uniform distribution of the com¬pound according to the invention. The formulations are prepared in a manner known per se, eg. by extending the active ingredient with solvents and/or carriers, if desired using emulsifiers and iispersants, it also being possible to use other organic solvents as auxiliary solvents if water is used as the diluent. SuiTable auxiliaries are essentially: solvents such as aromatics (eg. xy¬lene ), chlorinated aromatics (eg. chlorobenzenes), paraffins (eg• mineral oil fractions), alcohols (eg. methanol, butanol), ketones (eg. cyclohexanone), amines (eg. ethanolamine, dimethylformamide) and water; carriers such as ground natural minerals (eg. kaolins, -lays, talc, chalk) and ground synthetic minerals (eg. highly-disperse silica, silicates); emulsifiers, such as non-ionic and anionic emulsifiers (eg. polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, alkylsulfonates and arylsulfonates) and dispersants such as lig-nosulfite waste liquors and methylcellulose.<br>
The fungicidal compositions generally comprise from 0.1 to 95, preferably from 0.5 to 90, % by weight of active ingredient.<br>
rhe rates of application for use in crop protection are from 0,01 to 2.0 kg of active ingredient per ha, depending on the nature of the desired effect.<br>
In the treatment of seeds, amounts of 0.001 to 0.1 g, preferably 0.01 to 0.05 g, of active ingredient are generally required per kilogram of seed.<br>
When used in the protection of materials or stored products, the rate of application of active ingredient depends on the nature of the intended use and the desired effect. Usual rates of applica¬tion for the protection of materials are, for example, 0.001 g to 2 kg, preferably 0.005 g to 1 kg, of active ingredient per cubic meter of material treated.<br><br>
When using the agents according to the invention as fungicides, they can be present, in the use form, together with other active ingredients, eg. with herbicides, insecticides, growth regula¬tors, fungicides or else with fertilizers.<br>
In many cases, a mixture with fungicides results in a widened fungicidal spectrum of action.<br>

Synthesis examples<br>
The protocols given in the synthesis examples which follow were used for obtaining other compounds I by choosing suiTable differ¬ent starting materials. The resulting compounds are listed in the Tables which follow together with physical data.<br>
Example 1<br>
Synthesis of pentane-2,3-dione 2-oxime<br>
250 ml of hydrogen-chloride-saturated diethyl ether are added dropwise at -20°C  to 66.2 g (0.77 mol) of 3-pentanone in 300 ml of toluene.<br>
A solution of 88 g (0.85 mol) of n-butyl nitrite in 250 ml of diethyl ether is carefully added dropwise at -20°C  to this mix¬ture, and stirring of the entire reaction mixture is continued for two hours at 0°C  and a further 12 hours at room temperature. After 250 ml of water has been added, the organic phase is separ¬ated and extracted three times using in each case 200 ml of IN sodium hydroxide solution. This aqueous phase is brought to a pH of 4 by adding IN hydrochloric acid and extracted three times using in each case 200 ml of dichloromethane. After the organic phase has been dried over sodium sulfate, it is evaporated in vacuo. This gives 56 g of an oil (63 %), which crystallizes rapidly.<br>
Melting point: 58-60°C <br>

Example 2<br>
Synthesis of pentane-2,3-dione 2-(0-methyloxime)<br>
49.7 g (0.35 mol) of methyl iodide are added dropwise at room temperature to a solution of 40.2 g (0.55 mol) of pen-tane-2,3-dione 2-oxime and 52.0 g (0.38 mol) of potassium carbon¬ate in 400 ml of acetone, and stirring is continued for 12 hours at this temperature.<br>
After the inorganic salts have been removed by filtration, the acetone solution is evaporated in vacuo, the residue is parti¬tioned between methyl tert-butyl ether and water, and the organic phase is washed with water, dried over sodium sulfate and concen¬trated. This gives 37.7 g (83 %) of an oil.<br><br>

10.3 g (0.1 mol) of n-butyl nitrite and then 54 g of a 30 % strength solution of sodium methylate in methanol are carefully added dropwise at 10°C  to a solution of 12.9 g (0.1 mol) of pen-tane-2,3-dione 2-(0-methyl oxime) in 120 ml of methanol. The mix¬ture is allowed to come to room temperature and is stirred for 12 hours at this temperature. The mixture is worked up by adding dilute hydrochloric acid to a pH of 7 and subsequent evaporation in vacuo. The residue is taken up in 100 ml of water and ex¬tracted twice using in each case 100 ml of diethyl ether. The or¬ganic phase is dried over sodium sulfate and evaporated in vacuo. This gives 7.7 g (49 %) of an oil.<br>
1H NMR (CDCL3): δ = 1.99, 2.11 (2s, 6H); 4.05 (s, 3H); 10,40 (s, IH).<br>
Example 4<br>
Synthesis of pentane-2,3,4-trione 3,4-bis-(O-methyl<br>
oxime)-2-oxime<br>
4.7 ml (0.06 mol) of pyridine and 1.7 g (0.02 mol) of 0-methylhy-droxylamine hydrochloride are added at room temperature to a sol¬ution of 3.2 g (0.02 mol) of pentane-2,3,4-trione 4-(O-methyl oxime)-2-oxime in 60 ml of methanol. After the mixture has been stirred for two hours at room temperature, it is concentrated in vacuo, the product is taken up in 50 ml of diethyl ether, and the mixture is washed twice using in each case 20 ml of dilute hydro¬chloric acid and twice using in each case 20 ml of water, dried over Na2SO4 and evaporated in vacuo. Column chromatography on sil¬ica gel (cyclohexane/ethyl acetate: 99:1 -+ 95:5) gives two diastereomers as oils.<br><br>

Example 5<br>
Synthesis of    Methyl [2-(2,3-bismethoxyimino-1-methyl-<br>
butylideneaminooxymethyl)phenyl]methoxyimino-acetate<br>
I.4 g (4.8 mmol) of methyl 2-methoxyimino-2-(2-bromomethyl)-phenylacetate are added to a solution of 0.9 g (4.8 mmol) of pen-tane-2,3,4-trione 3,4-'bis(0-methyl oxime)-2-oxime and 0.4 g of potassium hydroxide in 20 ml of dry dimethylformamide and the mixture is stirred for 30 minutes at room temperature. The mixture is worked up by adding 50 ml of ice-water and then by three extractions using in each case 20 ml of diethyl ether. The combined organic phases are dried over sodium sulfate and evapor¬ated in vacuo. The residue is recrystallized from diisopropyl ether. This gives 0.6 g (32 %) of white crystals with a melting point of 105°C .<br>
1H NMR (CDCl3):δ = 1.88, 2.02 (2s, 6H); 3.83, 3,91, 3.93, 4.02 (4s, 12H); 5.05 (s, 2H)? 7.15 (m, IH); 7.39 (m, 3H).<br>
Example 6<br>
Synthesis of    N-methyl-[2-(2,3-bismethoxyimino-l-methyl-<br>
butylideneaminooxymethy1)phenyl]methoxyimino-acetamide<br>
2 ml of 40 % strength aqueous methylamine solution are added to a solution of 0.6 g (1.5 mmol) of methyl [2-(2,3-bismethoxyimi-no-l-methylbutylideneaminooxymethyl)phenyl]methoxyiminoacetate in 10 ml of tetrahydrofuran, and the mixture is stirred for 12 hours at room temperature. For working up, the reaction mixture is evaporated in vacuo, taken up in 20 ml of diethyl ether, washed using 20 ml of water, dried over sodium sulfate and evaporated in vacuo. This gives 0.6 g (98 %) of an oil.<br><br>

Activity against Plasmopara viticola<br>
Leaves of grapevines cv. -Miiller-Thurgau- in pots were sprayed with an aqueous spray mixture comprising 80% of active ingredient and 20% of emulsifier in the dry matter. To be Table to assess the duration of action of the active ingredients, the plants were placed in the greenhouse for 8 days after the spray coating had dried on. Only then were the leaves infected with a zoospore suspension of Plasmopara viticola (downy mildew of grapevines). Then, the grapevines were first placed in a water-vapor-saturated chamber at 24°C  for 48 hours and subsequently in a greenhouse at from 20 to 30°C   for 5 days. After this period, the plants were re¬turned to the humid chamber for 16 hours to accelerate the erup¬tion of sporangiophores. The extent of the fungal eruption was then assessed in % diseased area on the undersides of the leaves.<br><br><br><br>
