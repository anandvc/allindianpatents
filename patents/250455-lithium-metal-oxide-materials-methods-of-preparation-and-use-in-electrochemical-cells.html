LITHIUM METAL OXIDE MATERIALS<br>
AND METHODS OF SYNTHESIS AND USE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to lithium metal oxide compositions as well as electrochemical devices utilizing such compositions and, in particular, to lithium-magnesium nickel oxide compositions suitable as components of lithium-ion electrochemical devices.<br>
2.	Description of Related Art<br>
Rechargeable lithium and lithium-ion batteries can be used in a variety of applications, such as cellular phones, laptop computers, digital cameras and video cameras, and hybrid electric vehicles etc., due to their high energy density.<br>
Commercially available lithium-ion batteries typically consist of graphite-based anode and LiCoO2-based cathode materials. However, LiCoO2-based cathode materials can be expensive and typically have relatively low capacity, approximately 150 mAh/g.<br>
Alternatives to LiCoO2-based cathode materials include LiNiO2-based cathode materials, which can be less expensive. Typical LiNiO2-based cathode materials can include compositions having a formula LiNi08Co02O2 or LiNio sCo0.15Al0.05O2. These materials are relatively more expensive than cobalt-free LiNiO2-based cathode material because of the relatively higher cost of cobalt relative to nickel. Furthermore, LiNiCoO2-based cathode materials usually have lower safety, cyclability, and first cycle efficiency over LiCoO2-based cathode materials because of the lower structural stability and higher surface reactivity of LiNiO2 type cathodes.<br>
Li(Ni, Co)O2-based cathode materials have also been disclosed. For example, Lecerf et al., in U.S. Patent No. 4,980,080, disclosed a process of making a cathode material for a secondary battery having a formula LiyNi2-yO2 or Li1-xCoxO2. Xie et al., in U.S. Patent No. 5,750,288, disclosed modified lithium nickel oxide compounds for electrochemical cathodes and cells based on LixMyOz materials, where M is a non-transition metal selected from the group consisting of aluminum, gallium, tin and zinc. Mayer, in U.S. Patent No. 5,783,333, disclosed a LixNiyCozMnO2 material. Mayer also disclosed, in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,007,947 and 6,379,842, cathode materials having a formula LixNiyCozMnO2 or<br><br>

LixMn2-rMlr04 where M is a metal selected from the group consisting of aluminum, titanium, tungsten, chromium, molybdenum, magnesium, tantalum, silicon, and combinations thereof and Ml is one of chromium, titanium, tungsten, nickel, cobalt, iron, tin, zinc, zirconium, silicon, or a combination thereof. Kumta et al, in U.S. Patent No. 6,017,654, disclosed cathode materials having a formula Li1+xNi1-yMyNxO2(i+x) anci LiNi1-yMyNxOp where M is a transition metal selected from the group consisting of titanium, vanadium, chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, and aluminum and N is a Group II element selected from the group consisting of magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, and zinc. Sunagawa et al., in U.S. Patent No. 6,040,090, disclosed a positive electrode material based on Li-Ni~Co-Mn-O2. Peres et al., in U.S. Patent No. 6,274,272, disclosed an active cathode material having a formula LiLNi(1-C-A-M)CocAl AMgMO2. Gao et al., in U.S. Patent No. 6,277,521, disclosed a lithium metal oxide material containing multiple dopants with a formula LiNi1_xCoyMaM'bO2 where M is a metal selected from the group consisting of titanium, zirconium, and combinations thereof and M' is a metal selected from the group consisting of magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, and combinations thereof. Mao et al., in U.S. Patent No. 6,071,649, disclosed LiCoO2-coated LiNiO2 or Li(Ni,Co)O2 materials. None of these disclosed Li-Mg-Ni-CVbased cathode materials.<br>
Matsubara et al, in U.S. Patent No. 6,045,771, disclosed a cathode material having a formula Liy_xiNi1-x2MxO2, where M is a metal selected from the group consisting of aluminum, iron, cobalt, manganese, and magnesium, x - xl+x2, 0 
Multiple companies are also commercially fabricating cathodes utilizing materials with a general formula LiNiCoMO2. TODA (earlier Fuji Chemical) manufactures products CA5, CA1505N, and NCA. Honjo-FMC and Nichia (both of Japan) also provide nickel-cobalt-based cathodes. These products typically suffer from low safety properties, and relatively low rate capability.<br>

batteries or lithium-ion batteries, as well as methods of preparation and use, utilizing, for example, the compositions of the invention.

In accordance with one or more embodiments, the present invention provides a lithium metal oxide composition having a first metal substantially associated with an a-site and a second metal substantially associated with a b-site in a crystalline lattice. The a-site can be crystallographically referred to as the 3a site and the b-site can be referred to as the 3b site in a R3m crystal lattice. In accordance with some embodiments of the invention, the first metal can be associated at the 3 a site along with, for example, lithium, and the second metal can be associated at the 3b site.

In accordance with further embodiments, the present invention provides a particle comprising a core or interior layer having one or more layers of a metal oxide coating applied thereon   The coating layer can comprise a second lithium intercalating material including, for example, a compound having a formula Li2CobO2, where 0.7 
In accordance with still further embodiments, the invention can be characterized as providing a particle comprising a lithium magnesium nickel oxide core having a lithium cobalt oxide coating layer. The amount of the coating layer can range from about 0.01 wt % to about 30 wt% of the particle.<br>
The present invention further provides one or more synthesis techniques that provides a first metal having a preferential association with the 3a site and, in some cases, provides a second metal having a preferential association with the 3b site. In accordance with still other embodiments, the present invention provides synthesis techniques that can decrease any tendency by the second metal to associate with the 3a site.<br>
The first metal can provide crystalline stability to the lithium mixed metal oxide material during lithium intercalation/de-intercalation cycling processes. Thus, the techniques of the present invention can provide a chemically stable material that may be suitable as components, e.g. cathodes, in electrochemical devices and be characterized as having high capacity, low cost as well as high voltage and high rate with improved cycle life.<br>
In accordance with one or more embodiments, the techniques of the present invention can utilize precursor compounds that can form a lithium metal oxide, preferably a lithium metal oxide doped with a crystal lattice stabilizing metal. In accordance with other embodiments, the techniques of the present invention can provide or promote processing<br><br>
WO 2005/1J4768	PCT/US2005/017548<br>
-8-<br>
conditions that favor the formation of ionic species from precursor compounds that can preferentially become associated with specific crystallographic sites. The processing conditions of the present invention can promote formation of metal oxide species as well as association of such species with a particular, predetermined crystallographic site. For example, the techniques of the present invention can utilize one or more lithium donor compounds, one or more metal donor compounds that preferentially can become associated with a 3a crystallographic site, and in some cases, one or more metal donor compounds that<br>
preferentially become associated with a 3b crystallographic site. Thus, in accordance with<br>
i one or more embodiments, the present invention can utilize a lithium donor compound, a<br>
magnesium metal donor compound, and a nickel metal donor compound; the processing conditions can promote ionic species formation, intermingling, and crystallization to form a lithium mixed metal oxide wherein a first metal can be preferentially associated with a 3a crystallographic site and a second metal can be preferentially associated with a 3b site.<br>
In accordance with further embodiments, the techniques of the present invention can provide a lithium magnesium nickel oxide composition. For example, one or more techniques can utilize precursor compounds including, for example, those selected from the group consisting of a lithium donor, a magnesium donor, and a nickel donor. In some cases,. one or more oxidizing agents or compounds can also be utilized. Thus, the precursor compound mixture can comprise, for example, a lithium source, an oxidizing agent, a first metal donor, and a second metal donor. The lithium source, the oxidizing agent, the first metal donor, and the second metal donor, preferably, can undertake one or more phase changes or phase transitions at about the same processing conditions, e.g. at about the same processing temperature range. Preferably, the elements of the selected precursor compounds can maintain their respective predetermined valences until, or in some cases through, the phase change. Likewise, the processing conditions utilized inhibit or at least do not promote any valance changes. Thus, in accordance with one or more preferred embodiments of the present invention, the precursor compounds, or oxides of the respective donor components, can be subject to processing conditions that promote or maintain chemical stability until reaction to a desired phase.<br>
The lithium donor or source can comprise lithium hydroxide, lithium carbonate, or mixtures thereof. The oxidizing agent can comprise lithium nitrate or nickel nitrate or mixture thereof. In some cases, the lithium source can comprise or consist of lithium nitrate as well as lithium hydroxide. The first metal donor can comprise magnesium hydroxide,<br><br>
WO 2005/114768	PCT/US2005/017548<br>
-9-<br>
magnesium carbonate, magnesium oxide, or mixtures thereof. The second metal donor can comprise nickel hydroxide, nickel sulfate, nickel nitrate, nickel oxide, or mixtures thereof.<br>
The precursor compounds can have any form that facilitates mixing into the precursor mixture   For example, the precursor mixture can comprise a powder mixture of each of the precursor compounds or a slurry of each of the precursor compounds. Moreover, the precursor compound can be a masterbatch comprising hydroxides of lithium, the first metal donor, and/or the second metal donor. The oxidizing agent can be incorporated into the masterbatch as desired to facilitate processing and storage before utilization. In accordance with one or more embodiments, the precursor compounds can have desired a structure that, preferably, promotes efficient utilization of the lithium metal oxide materials of the present invention. Thus, the synthesis techniques of the invention can provide morphologically desirable lithium metal oxide materials.<br>
The precursor compounds can have a variety of shapes that can be transformed to a material that can coat or be coated to form a component of an electrochemical device. For example, one or more of the precursor powder compounds can be spherically-shaped. Other shapes can be utilized as desired to accommodate or suit an end-user preference. Preferably, the synthesis process of the present invention can maintain, at least partially, the spherical shape throughout the processing or synthesis steps to provide, for example, a lithium magnesium nickel oxide material suitable as a cathode electrode in, for example, rechargeable electrochemical devices. Thus, in accordance with one or more preferred embodiments, the precursor mixture comprises a nickel donor, such as but not limited to nickel hydroxide, having a spherical shape. However, any shape and form of the starting materials of the composition of the present invention can be utilized.<br>
In accordance with still further embodiments, the nickel donor can comprise a high density, e.g. high tap density, nickel hydroxide.<br>
The LixMgyNiO2 compositions of the present invention can be prepared by utilizing precursor compounds with pre-defined or pre-selected particle sizes and morphologies. Any particle size can be utilized to create the composition of the present invention. For example, the particle size of a nickel donor precursor such as Ni(OH)2 can be in the range of about 2 urn to about 20 urn.<br>
In accordance with one or more embodiments, the material molar ratios of the precursor compounds can be selected to provide a composition having the general material formula LixMgyNiO2, where O.K x 
 <br>
WO 2005/114768	PCT/US2005/017548<br>
-10-<br>
cases, the ratios can be selected to so that 0.9 
In yet other embodiments in accordance with the present invention, the LixMgyNi02 or Li1-yMgyNiO2 materials can have any one of the following formula: Li1.05Mg0 005NiO2, Li1.05Mg0.01NiO2, Li1.05Mg0.02NiO2 Li1.05sMg0.025NiO2, Li1.05Mg0l03oNi02, Li1.05Mg0.04NiO2, and Li1.05Mg0.05NiO2. Thus, the precursor compounds can be selected in such ratios that provide such compositions.<br>
The precursor compounds are typically pre-mixed to allow homogeneous mixing. In still further embodiments, the materials of the present invention can be crystallized by, for example, heating to sinter and facilitate crystallization into the compositions of the present invention.<br>
The synthesis process can comprise mixing the precursor compounds into a substantially homogeneous mixture. The synthesis process can further comprise heating the precursor mixture in one or more heating stages or steps, e.g. two or more heat soaks, according to a predetermined heating profile. The synthesis process typically promotes oxidation, or oxyhydroxide formation, of the corresponding donor components; mixing, typically ionic mixing, of such components; and crystallization into a lithium metal oxide composition, wherein the first metal of the composition, e.g. magnesium, is associated with a 3a site and the second metal, e.g. nickel, is associated with the 3b site. For example, in a lithium-magnesium-nickel oxide composition, the mixture can be heated to a first heating temperature that promotes preferential formation of Ni3+over Ni2+.<br>
In accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention, the first heating step or stage can involve heating the green, precursor mixture to allow oxide formation and/or ion mixing without, or at least minimal, valance changes of the donor compounds. For example, the precursor mixture can be heated to a heat soak temperature of about 450° C in a first heating step. This first heat soaking temperature can range from about 350 °C to about 700° C. The second heating step can comprise heating to promote crystallization of the transformed oxide mixture by, for example, heat soaking at a second heat soak temperature of about 700° C. The second heat soaking temperature can range from about 600° C to about 800° C.<br>
Preferably, the first soaking temperature is maintained until the precursor compounds have been substantially transformed into their oxide counterparts. For example, the first soaking temperature can be maintained for about one hour but can be maintained for as long<br><br>
WO 2005/134768	PCT/US2005/017548<br>
- 11 -<br>
as about six hours. In accordance with other embodiments, the first heat soak condition can be maintained for any duiation such that the synthesis procedure can proceed to the next heating stage to commence or promote crystallization, i.e., without maintaining a first soaking temperature. The second soaking temperature can be maintained, for example, until the lithium metal oxide has crystallized to a desired extent. Thus, for example, the second heat soak can be maintained for about one hour but can be maintained for as long as about six hours.<br>
Heating, as well heat soaking, can be performed with exposure to an oxidizing atmosphere such as air or pure oxygen.<br>
The first heating step can comprise raising the temperature at a rate sufficient to promote oxide formation while reducing any tendency to destabilize the precursor morphology. For example, the precursor mixture can heated at a rate of about 20° C per minute, about 10° C per minute, or even about 5° C per minute. Control of the heating rate may depend on several factors including, but not limited to, the amount being processed, the desired relative composition, as well as the effective area exposed to the oxidizing atmosphere. The second heating stage can comprise raising the temperature sufficient to facilitate crystallization such that the first metal tends to be associated with the 3 a site and the second metal tends to be associated with the 3b site. For example, the oxide mixture can be heated at a rate of about 10° C per minute, about 5° C per minute, or even about 2° C per minute.<br>
After heat treatment, the materials can be allowed to cool naturally to room temperature by, for example, natural convection. Heat and soaking can be performed in any suitable equipment. For example, a furnace or oven accommodating the mixture can be utilized. The furnace can be supplied with air and/or oxygen.<br>
The sintered, crystallized material can be ground in any suitable grinding apparatus.<br>
For example, a mortar grinder (e.g., Model RM100 grinder available from Retsch/Brinkmann<br>
or Brinkmann Instruments, Inc., Westbury, New York) fitted with an agate mortar and pestle,<br>
can be utilized to grind the crystallized composition to render it with a desired particle size. Other suitable grinding methods or systems can include, for example, ball milling, jet milling, attritor mill, hammer mill and pin mill. The desired particle size can vary and can depend on the specific application or use. Thus, in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention, the LixMgyNiO2 composition can be formed as particles by grinding for about five<br><br>
WO 2005/114768	PCT/US 2005/017548<br>
- 12 -<br>
minutes until a mean particle size of about 2 µm to about 20 urn, preferably about 5 µm to about 10 µm, is achieved.<br>
In accordance with one or more preferred embodiments of the present invention, the LixMgyNiO2 composition, typically as particles, can further comprise a coating layer that further improves a first cycle efficiency, life, and/or safety or even reduces gassing when the composition is utilized as a cathodic material in electrochemical devices. In accordance with still further embodiments of the invention, the LixMgyNiO2 particles further comprise one or more coating layers that reduces any gelling tendencies when the particles are prepared as an electrode paste. For example, the particles can be coated to reduce the likelihood of gelling in a mixture comprising NMP, PVDF, LixMgyNiO2, and conductive carbon, which is yet another advantage over non-coated nickelates<br>
In accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention, the coating layer can comprise a composition having a formula LiCoO2. The coated LixMgyNiO2 particles can be prepared by mixing therewith a lithium salt solution or mixture such as, but not limited to LiNO3, LiOH, LiAc, Li2SO4, Li2CO3, with a cobalt containing salt solution. In accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention, the lithium salt can comprise LiNO3 and the cobalt salt can comprise Co(NO3)26H2O. The molar ratio of Li/Co can vary but typically ranges from about 0.6 to about 1.4. Preferably, the Li/Co molar ratio ranges from about .0.95 to about 1.05 so that the molar ratio of the Co content, in the coating layer, to the Ni content, in the core layer, ranges from about 0.01 to about 0.4, more preferably from about 0.05 to about 0.15.<br>
If any water, which is typically carried with the salts, is present, it is preferably allowed to evaporate utilizing any suitable techniques. For example, mixture can be heated on a hot plate with stirring until dry, or in a rotating drying oven.<br>
The precursor-coated material can then heated or sintered in air using any suitable<br>
apparatus, such as a muffle furnace to facilitate oxidation and/or crystallization of the coating layer on the core. For example, the coating layer can be synthesized by raising the temperature of the precursor coated LixMgyNiO2 particles at any suitable rate, such as about 5° C per minute, and maintained or soaked at a temperature of about 450° C for about one hour. A second soaking temperature can be utilized by raising the temperature at a rate of about 2° C per minute and maintained at a temperature of about 700° C for about two hours to promote crystallization of the coating layer. Such an exemplary sintering treatment can provide a coated material having a concentration gradient structure wherein more cobalt can<br><br>
WO 2005/114768	PCT/US2005/017548<br>
- 13 -<br>
be present at or near the outer surface compared to the region a or near the core layer. Other techniques may be utilized that provides a coated core material having the composition of the present invention.<br>
The drying stage can be performed until the mixture is sufficiently dry. For example, drying can be performed by heating at a rate of about 2° C per minute to a temperature of about 110° C. The drying temperature can be maintained as long as necessary and may last from 0 minutes to one or more hours.<br>
The first heating rate to produce the one or more coating layers can vary and may range from about 2° C per minute to about 10° C per minute. The first heat soaking temperature can range from about 300° C to about 500° C. This first heat soaking temperature can be maintained until the sufficient or desired oxide conversion has been achieved. It can be maintained from 0 minutes to one or more hours. The second heating rate can vary from about 2° C per minute to about 10° C per minute. The second heat soaking temperature can range from about 650° C to about 750° C. It is believed that higher soaking temperatures may promote degradation of the core layer to other than the preferred crystallographic arrangement. The coated particles can be allowed to cool to room temperature.<br>
Any suitable equipment may be utilized in the drying/heating/soaking process including, for example, any oven or furnace that provides an appropriate oxidizing atmosphere.<br>
The sintered, coated material can be further processed to obtain a particle sized between about 8 um to about 12 urn. For example, the sintered, coated material can be ground for about five minutes in a mortar grinder fitted with an agate mortar and pestle.<br>
Examples<br>
The function and advantages of these and other embodiments of the present invention can be more fully understood from the examples below. The following examples illustrate the benefits and/or advantages of the compositions and techniques of the present invention but do not exemplify the full scope of the invention.<br>
In the examples, the following test protocols were performed.<br><br>
WO 2005/114768	PCT/US2005/017548<br>
- 14-<br>
Protocol 1. Rate capability test and formation -1st cycle efficiency<br>
A coin cell was used for material life test utilizing lithium metal as the counter electrode. The positive electrode of the coin cell was made from a composite cathode prepared in accordance with Example 2. The electrolyte was EC/DEC (1 :l)-LiPF6, 1 M (available from EM Industries, Inc., Hawthorne, New York) and the separator was a glass fiber material (available from Fisher Scientific).<br>
The cell was fully charged and discharged at a rate of C/20 for first cycle efficiency measurements, which is the ratio of the discharge capacity vs the charge capacity. Thereafter the cell was cycled at rates of about C/5, C/2, 1C, 2C, 3C, and 5C from about 2.7 volts to about 4.2 volts.  1C rate was defined as about 150rnAh/g discharge in 1 hour.<br>
Protocol 2. Life cycle test.<br>
A coin cell was used for material life test. The positive electrode of the coin cell was made from a composite cathode, and the negative was made from a composite anode, consisting of graphite as mesophase carbon microbeads (MCMB 2528, 90 wt%), PVDF binder (7 wt%) and carbon black (3 wt%). The electrolyte was EC/DEC (l:l)-LiPF6,1 M (available from EM Industries, Inc., Hawthorne, New York) and the separator was a glass fiber material (available from Fisher Scientific).<br>
The cell was initially fully charged and discharged for 3 cycles at about C/5 rate, deep cycle. The deep cycles consisted of charging to about 4.2 V (fully charged) and discharging to about 2.7 V (fully discharged). The cell was fully charged, to about 4,2 V (100 % state-of-charge (SOC)), cell was then discharged to about 20 % of full capacity at about 1C rate current to reach about an 80 % SOC. Then the cell was cycled discharging about 10% (to about 70 % SOC) and charged 10% (to about 80 % SOC) at about 1C rate current, typically referred to as a shallow cycle.<br>
A deep cycle was performed after every 200 shallow cycles. This test provided an indication of the effective life of the cell under evaluation.<br>
Protocol 3. Area Specific Impedance (ASI) Measurement.<br>
The ASI, in Ocm2, at various starting SOC conditions was determined by pulse discharging a coin cell. ASI was calculated according to:<br><br>
WO 2005/114768	PCT/US2005/017548<br>
- 15-<br>
ASI = A   (?V/I),<br>
where A is the electrode area in cm2, where I is the discharge current pulse at a rale of about 6C. The voltage variation (AV) is the voltage change during the discharge pulse.<br>
For example, at a SOC = 90 %, the initial voltage is measured. The cell is discharged at a rate of 6C and the final voltage is measured after 18 sec.<br>
ASI can con-elate to the potential available power and allows for a comparison of power capability between materials and formulations for Li-ion cells. This can be particularly important for high pulse power applications.<br>

The homogeneous precursor powders (precursor compounds) were placed in alumina crucibles and sintered.<br>
Sintering was performed by heating at a rate of about 5° C/minute to about 450° C and held at about 450° C for about four hours. The temperature was then raised at about 2° C/minute to about 700° C and held for about four hours.<br>
The sample was then allowed to cool naturally to room temperature. The cooled sample was ground for about five minutes to break up any agglomerates. The powder material was sieved through a No. 270 mesh to remove larger particles and to ensure a desired 10 urn particle size.<br>

Additional NMP (n-methyl pyrrolidone) was added to produce a desired viscosity and promote mixing.<br>
The solution was mixed in a 250 ml jar with about 50 steel balls on a paint shaker for about 30 minutes. The mixed slurry was coated onto an aluminum foil, about 20 µim thick, with a doctor blade having about a 100 µm micron coating gap.<br>
The coated foil was dried at about 130° C for about thirty minutes. The dried, coated foil was then densified by passing the dried, coated foil through pressurized calender rolls, about 3 inch diameter, set at about 100 psi. The densified, dried, coated foil was cut into about 2 cm disks for use as electrodes. The active material weight on the disk electrodes was typically about 20 mg. The disk electrode was dried at about 80° C under vacuum for about sixteen hours before cell assembly.<br>
A coin cell (Hosen type #2025) was assembled by utilizing the disk electrode as the cathode. The coin cell was comprised of a glass fiber separator containing EC/DEC (1:1)-LiPFe, 1 M electrolyte (available from EM Industries, Inc., Hawthorne, New York) and a lithium metal anode. All assembly operations were performed in an argon-filled glove box wherein water and oxygen levels were less than about 2 ppm.<br>
The assembled coin cell was evaluated using a cycler/tester (available from Maccor, Inc., Tulsa, Oklahoma) for capacity, efficiency, rate capability, power and cyclability, according to protocols 1, 2, and 3, described above.

Similar to the cathode, an anode was prepared with formulation of MCMB:PVDF (93:7) was coated on a copper foil and cut to form 60 x 50 mm flag electrodes. These were similarly densified by calendering at 175 psi. The flag electrodes were dried at about 80° C, under vacuum for about sixteen hours.<br>
A two-electrode bag cell was assembled. The cell was comprised of the dried anode and cathodes, separated by a glass fiber separator with a rectangular size of about 65 x 55 mm2. About 1.6 ml of EC/DEC (l:l)-LiPF6, 1 M electrolyte was allowed to soak into the electrodes and separator and the assembly was compressed between two 70 x 60 mm2 glass plates. The whole assembly was put into an aluminum- laminated bag, approximately 80 x<br>
70 mm , and sealed under vacuum. *    ~ <br>
All assembly operations were performed in an argon-filled glove box wherein water and oxygen levels were less than about 2 ppm.<br>
The bag cells were charged and discharged at about C/10 current rate, between about 4.1 V to about 2.7 V, then charged at about C/5 current rate to a capacity of about 180 mAh/g to about 200 mAh/g.<br>
The cells with charged composite cathode were disassembled in an argon-filled glove box. The composite cathode powder was removed from the aluminum current collector. The composite electrode powder, with EC/DEC(1: l)-LiPF6, 1 M electrolyte in a weight ratio of<br><br>

water  To which, about 1000 g of the Li1.05Mg0.025NiO2 powder substantially prepared as described in Example 1 was added.<br>
The excess water was removed by evaporation on a hot plate with stirring until the mixture became a thick slurry. The slurry was poured into an alumina crucible and sintered under the following heating profile: heat at a rate of about 2° C/min to about 110° C, hold for about one hour at about 110° C, heat at a rate of 5° C/min to about 450° C, heat soak for about one hour at about 450° C, heat at a rate of about 2° C/min to about 700° C, and heat soak for about two hours at about 700° C.<br>
The prepared sample was allowed to cool naturally to room temperature. Once cooled, it was ground for about five minutes to break up any agglomerates and sieved through a No. 270 mesh screen<br>
XRD analysis shows that the prepared coated composition had a gradient profile, with no visible impurities, as can be seen in the copy of the XRD plot presented in FIG. 5 represented here by 5 rnol % LiCoO2 coated LiMg0.025NiO2. A copy of an SEM photomicrograph for the same sample, FIG. 4, shows that the coated powder composition maintained its spherical, about 10 µm, morphology.<br>

The gradient coating was detected by studying the increasing degree of asymmetry in the Bragg reflections. In particular, the peak 104 at about 44.4 degrees in 2-theta was used (FIG. 11) to show how the asymmetry of peak 104 continuously increased with the amount of LiCoO2. The respective XRD patterns in FIG. 11 have been adjusted for 2-theta zero point position<br><br>

Three gradient coated Li1.05NiO2 materials were synthesized and coated with 5 %, 10 % and 15 % LiCoO2 using the methods as substantially described in Examples 4 and 7. The coated samples were tested electrochemically for rate capability and first cycle efficiency as described above and protocol 1. The specific capacity results, listed in Table 2, show that lithium cobalt oxide coated lithium nickel oxide compounds of the present invention can provide better or at least equal performance capacity compared to non-coated compounds.<br>
FIG. 9 shows the ASI of a cell utilizing the LiCoO2-coated Li1. 05NiO2 material, measured according to protocol 3 above and FIG. 10 shows several ASI measurements of a cell utilizing nncoated LiMgNiO2 material. As shown in FIGS. 9 and 10, the performance, in terms of potential available power, of the lithium-cob alt-oxide coated lithium-nickel-oxide cells is comparable, if not better than cells utilizing the uncoated lithium-nickel-oxide materials. FIG. 12 shows the capacity retention at a discharge rate of about 1C of cells utilizing various active materials including lithium-nickel oxide, lithium magnesium nickel oxide, lithium-cobalt-oxide coated lithium magnesium nickel oxide, LiNi0.8Co0. 15Al0.05O2 (CA1505 cell available from TODA Co., Japan), and LiCoO2 (C-5 grade available from Nippon Chemical Industrial Co., LTD., Tokyo, Japan). The results presented in FIG. 12 indicate that the cells utilizing the coated and uncoated lithium-magnesium-nickel oxides of the invention can have better performance compared to cells utilizing lithium cobalt oxide. FIG. 13 is a graph showing the differential scanning calorimetry of the uncoated and lithium-cobalt oxide-coated lithium-magnesium-nickel oxide material of the present invention compared to a commercially available lithium-nickel-cobalt oxide material at about a 100 % state of charge and shows that the coated and uncoated materials are more thermally stable.<br>
