The novel dyes are outstandingly suitable for dyeing and printing textile materials containing hydroxyl and amide groups, for example those of cellulose, wool or synthetic polyamides. They are employed in accordance with customary methods.<br>
The dyeings and prints have an outstanding level of fastness.<br>
The novel reactive dyes can be employed both as a powder or granules and as aqueous concentrated solutions. The invention furthermore relates to textile products comprising materials containing hydroxyl or amide groups which have been dyed using dyes of the formula (1).<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the dyes are used as granules. The granules of the dyes can be obtained in the following steps:<br>
Mixing granulation<br>
In this case, the dye powder is moistened with 15 to 55% of water - based on the<br>
mixture of the powder - and the mixture is then shaped in a mixing granulator and<br>
subsequently dried, and the dust is removed, the dust removal agent being sprayed onto the granules as an aerosol mixture.<br>
Spray granulation<br>
In this case, the synthesis solution or suspension is simultaneously dried and<br>
granulated in a fluidizing spray dryer.<br>
The dye powder or dye granules in general comprise (in % by weight) 30 to 80% of a reactive dye of the formula (1) and 5 to 15% of water, in each case based on the total composition. In addition, they can also comprise inorganic salts, such as alkali metal chlorides or alkali metal sulfates, dispersing agents and dust removal agents.<br>
Preferred mixtures of solids additionally comprise buffer substances which give a pH of 3.5 to 7.5, in particular 4.5 to 6.5, when the mixtures are dissolved in 20 times the amount of water (based on the weight of the dye finished form). These buffer mixtures are added in amounts of 3 to 50, in particular 5 to 15% by weight, based on the total weight.<br>
Aqueous reactive dye solutions in general comprise 5 to 50% of a dye of the formula (1) (based on the total weight of the solution).<br>
Preferred aqueous reactive dye solutions additionally comprise buffer substances and have a pH of 3.5 to 7.5, in particular 4.5 to 6.5. These buffer substances are preferably added in amounts of 0.1 to 50%, in particular 1 to 20% by weight, based on the total weight.<br>
The buffers used are inert toward the reactive groups. Examples of buffers are: sodium dihydrogen phosphate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, potassium dihydro-gen phosphate, dipotassium hydrogen phosphate, sodium acetate, potassium acetate, sodium borate, potassium borate, sodium oxalate, potassium oxalate and sodium hydrogen phthalate. These buffers can be used by themselves or as a mixture.<br>
The dyes according to the invention are particularly suitable for dyeing textile products, specifically for dyeing materials containing hydroxyl or amide groups.<br>
Materials containing hydroxyl groups are those of natural or synthetic origin, such as, for example, cellulose fiber materials or regenerated products thereof and poly-vinyl alcohols. Cellulose fiber materials are preferably cotton, but also other plant fibers, such as linen, hemp, jute and ramie fibers; regenerated cellulose fibers are, for example, viscose staple and filament viscose. Materials containing carb-oxamide groups are, for example, synthetic and naturally occurring polyamides and polyurethanes, in particular in the form of fibers, for example wool and other animal hair, silk, leather, nylon 6,6, nylon 6, nylon 11 and nylon 4.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can be applied to and fixed on the substrates mentioned, in particular on the fiber materials mentioned, by the application techniques known for water-soluble dyes, in particular by those known for water-soluble fiber-reactive dyes.<br>
Thus, very good color yields are obtained with them on cellulose fibers by the exÂ¬haustion process from a long liquor using the most diverse acid-binding agents and if appropriate neutral salts, such as sodium chloride or sodium sulfate. Dyeing is preferably carried out in an aqueous bath at temperatures between 60 and 105Â°C, if appropriate at temperatures up to 120Â°C, under pressure and if appropriate in the presence of customary dyeing auxiliaries. A procedure can be followed here in which the material is introduced into the warm bath, which is gradually heated to the desired dyeing temperature, and the dyeing process is brought to completion at this temperature. If desired, the neutral salts, which accelerate exhaustion of the dye, can alternatively be added to the bath only after the actual dyeing temperature has been reached. The dyes are distinguished by more harmonious properties in uptake owing to the neutral salt and the subsequent addition of the acid-binding agent.<br>
Excellent color yields with a very good appearance of the goods are likewise obtained on cellulose fibers by the padding process because of the better solubility compared with pure vinylsulfone dyes, it being possible for the dyes to be fixed in the customary manner by batching at room temperature or elevated temperature, for example up to about 60Â°C, by steaming or with dry heat.<br>
Deep prints with a good contour status and a clear white background are likewise obtained by the customary printing processes for cellulose fibers, which can be<br>
carried out in one phase - for example by printing with a printing paste comprising sodium bicarbonate or another acid-binding agent and subsequent steaming at 100 to 103Â°C - or in two phases - for example by printing with a neutral or weakly acidic printing ink and subsequent fixing, either by passing through a hot electrolyte-containing alkaline bath or by overpadding with an alkaline electrolyte-containing padding liquor with subsequent batching or steaming or dry heat treatment of the material overpadded under alkaline conditions. The quality of the prints depends only little on varying fixing conditions.<br>
Hot air of 120 to 200Â°C is used for fixing by means of dry heat by the customary thermofixing processes. In addition to the customary steam of 101 to 103Â°C, superheated steam and compressed steam with temperatures of up to 160Â°C can also be employed.<br>
The agents which are acid-binding and effect fixing on the cellulose fibers are, for example, water-soluble basic salts of the alkali metals and likewise the alkaline earth metals of inorganic or organic acids or compounds which liberate alkali under the influence of heat. The alkali metal hydroxides and alkali metal salts of weak to moderately strong inorganic or organic acids may be mentioned in particular, alkali metal compounds preferably meaning the sodium and potassium compounds. Such acid-binding agents are, for example, sodium hydroxide, potasÂ¬sium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium formate, sodium hydrogen phosphate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, sodiÂ¬um trichloroacetate, water-glass or trisodium phosphate.<br>
The compounds (dyes) according to the invention are bonded chemically to the cellulose fiber by the treatment of the compounds according to the invention with the acid-binding agents, if appropriate under the action of heat; on these fiber materials, they are distinguished by a high fixing yield when used in the dyeing and printing processes. After customary after-treatment by rinsing to remove non-fixed portions of dye, the cellulose dyeings show excellent wet-fastnesses, especially since non-fixed portions of dye can easily be washed out because of their good solubility in cold water.<br>
The dyeings and prints produced with the compounds according to the invention are distinguished by very clear shades. In particular, the dyeings and prints on<br>
cellulose fiber materials have a good fastness to light and very good wet fastÂ¬nesses, such as fastnesses to washing, milling, water, seawater, cross-dyeing and acid and alkaline perspiration, and furthermore a good fastness to pleating, fastÂ¬ness to ironing and fastness to rubbing.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can furthermore also be used for fiber-reactive dyeing of wool. Wool which has been given a non-felting or low-felting treatment (cf, for example, H. Rath, Lehrbuch der Textilchemie [Textbook of Textile Chemistry], Springer-Verlag, 3rd Edition (1972), pages 295 to 299, in particular treatment by the so-called Hercosett process (page 298); J. Soc. Dyers and Colourists 1972. 93 to 99, and 1975. 33 to 44) can also be dyed with very good fastness properties.<br>
The process for dyeing on wool is carried out here in the customary and known dyeing procedure from an acid medium. Thus, for example, acetic acid and/or amÂ¬monium sulfate or acetic acid and ammonium acetate or sodium acetate are added to the dyebath in order to obtain the desired pH. To achieve a usable levelness of the dyeing, it is advisable to add customary leveling auxiliaries, such as, for example, those based on a reaction product of cyanuric chloride with 3 times the molar amount of an aminobenzenesulfonic acid and/or of an amino-naphthalenesulfonic acid, or based on a reaction product of, for example, stearyl-amine with ethylene oxide. Thus, for example, dyeing is first carried out by the exhaustion process from an acid dyebath having a pH of about 3.5 to 5.5, while controlling the pH, and, toward the end of the dyeing time, the pH is then shifted into the neutral or, if appropriate, weakly alkaline range up to a pH of 8.5, in particular to bring about complete reactive bonding with the fiber to achieve good depths of color. At the same time, the dye content which is not bonded reactively is dissolved off.<br>
The procedure described here also applies to the production of dyeings on fiber materials of other naturally occurring polyamides or of synthetic polyamides and polyurethanes. As a rule, the material to be dyed is introduced into the bath at a temperature of about 40Â°C and is agitated therein for some time, the dyebath is then adjusted to the desired weakly acid, preferably weakly acetic acid, pH and the actual dyeing is carried out at a temperature between 60 and 98Â°C. However, the dyeings can also be carried out at the boiling point or in closed dyeing<br>
apparatus at temperatures up to 106Â°C. Since the water-solubility of the compounds is very good, they can also advantageously be employed in customary continuous dyeing processes.<br>
The formulae shown are those of the corresponding free acids. The dyes were in general isolated and employed for dyeing in the form of alkali metal salts, in particular the Na salts.<br><br>
Example 1<br>
115 g of chloro-aluminum phthalocyanine were introduced into 600 ml of chloro-sulfonic acid in the course of 30 minutes, at room temperature and while stirring. The mixture was then stirred at 136 to 138Â°C for 8 hours and the cooled melt was poured onto ice. The suspension was filtered with suction and the solid product washed with ice-water until largely free from sulfate and acid. In the form of the free acid, the moist paste isolated essentially corresponded to the formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Ice-water was added to the material on the suction filter, and 11 g of ammonium chloride and 95 g of 2,4-difluoro-6-(3-aminophenyl)aminopyrimidine were then stirred in. The pH of the suspension or solution was brought to 9.8 to 10.0 in the course of 2 hours by addition of sodium hydroxide solution, the temperature simultaneously being increased to 25Â°C. After the reaction solution had been stirred at this temperature for a further 8 hours, it was brought to pH 7 with dilute hydrochloric acid and salted out with sodium chloride. The dye was filtered off with suction and dried in vacuo at 60Â°C. The dye essentially corresponded, in the form of its free acid, to the formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
and dyed cotton in clear greenish-tinged turquoise blue shades, or gave a greenish-tinged turquoise blue print on cotton.<br>
Example 2<br>
The procedure was as in Example 1, but omitting the addition of ammonium chloride. A dye of the formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
resulted which likewise dyed cotton in clear greenish-tinged turquoise blue color shades.<br>
The degree of sulfonation and the content of sulfonamide groups in the dyes of Examples 1 and 2 can be controlled in a known manner by slight variation of the sulfochlorination conditions or by variation of the amounts of amino compounds employed.<br>
Example 3<br>
The reactive dyes of Examples 1 and 2 were also prepared by reaction of 0.1 mol of a dye intermediate product of the formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
with 0.08 to 0.15 mol of 2,4,6-trifluoropyrimidine in 250 ml of water at 40 to 50Â°C.<br>
