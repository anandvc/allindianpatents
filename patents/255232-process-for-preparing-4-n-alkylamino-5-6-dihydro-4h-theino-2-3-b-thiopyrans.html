PROCESS FOR OBTAINING 4-(N-ALKYLAMINO)-5,6-DIHYDRO-4H-THIENO-<br>
[2,3-b]-THIOPYRAN DERIVATIVES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to certain compounds useful as<br>
intermediates in the enantioselective synthesis of drugs, such<br>
as dorzolamide for example, as well as processes for obtaining<br>
them. It also relates to dorzolamide synthesis processes<br>
passing through these intermediates.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are used in the treatment<br>
of ocular hypertension (cause of the onset of glaucoma).<br>
European patent EP 296 879 Bl describes that, among other<br>
compounds, 4-(N-alkylamino)-5,6-dihydro-4H-thieno-[2, 3-b] -<br>
thiopyran-2-sulfonamide-7,7-dioxides of general formula (VII)<br><br>
wherein R1 is an alkyl and R2 is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl,<br>
have carbonic anhydrase inhibitory activity when topically<br>
administered.<br>
Among  such  compounds,   the  compound   (4S,6S)-4-(W-<br>
ethylamino)-5,6-dihydro-6-methyl—4H-thieno-[2, 3-b]-thiopyran-<br>
2-sulfonamide-7,7-dioxide,  also  known  as  dorzolamide,  of<br>
formula:<br><br><br>
2<br>
stands out.<br>
Patent documents and applications EP 296 879 Bl, US<br>
5,157,129, EP 617 037 and WO 02/20529 describe several<br>
synthetic routes for obtaining dorzolamide and analogues.<br>
Documents US 5,157,129 and WO 02/20529 describe<br>
enantioselective routes in which the sulfonamide group in<br>
position 2 is introduced in the final steps of the synthesis<br>
without affecting the stereochemistry of the intermediates.<br>
One of the key intermediates in both cases is the compounds<br>
with an amino group in position 4, of formula (II):<br><br>
and its diastereoisomers.<br>
To obtain it, US patent 5,157,129 starts from a hydroxyl<br>
group in position 4, which is subjected to a tosylation<br>
reaction and subsequent nucleophilic substitution with an<br>
alkylamine:<br><br>
However, the introduction of the tosyl group is hindered<br>
due to the lack of reactivity of the hydroxyl group.<br>
Furthermore, once the compound is tosylated, as this is in a<br>
benzyl position, it is unstable and therefore susceptible to<br>
producing lateral reactions, such as the elimination,<br>
substitution with a chlorine group in the reaction conditions<br>
(if tosyl chloride is used) and if a compound is involved<br>
which has a sulfone group in position 6, even the substitution<br><br>
3<br>
thereof with an oxygen for the sulfonyl group can occur.<br>
There are few methods for converting a benzyl alcohol<br>
into the corresponding alkylamine in a completely<br>
diastereoselective manner. For example, US patent 5,391,772<br>
describes the introduction of an azide group on similar<br>
structures, also starting from a hydroxyl group in position 4,<br>
by means of the use of a phosphoryl azide group which results<br>
in inverting the configuration. In this case, however, prior<br>
synthesis of the phosphoryl azide is required, and the use of<br>
azides entails a certain hazard at the industrial level due to<br>
their toxicity and because they are potentially explosive.<br>
Therefore, according to the state of the art, obtaining<br>
the alkylamines of formula (II) has several drawbacks because<br>
it involves at least 3-4 synthesis steps, some of which are<br>
hazardous. All this may further affect the<br>
diastereoselectivity in the subsequent amination, as well as<br>
the occurrence of byproducts.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is aimed at stable intermediates and<br>
reactions for diastereoselectively preparing the<br>
aforementioned 4-(N-alkylamino)-5,6-dihydro-4H-thieno-[2, 3-b]-<br>
thiopyrans solving the aforementioned drawbacks.<br>
So in an aspect the invention is aimed at a compound of<br>
formula (I):<br><br>
wherein:<br>
n is 0, 1 or 2,<br>
R1 is a linear or branched alkyl group,<br><br>
4<br>
R2 is selected from a substituted or non substituted<br>
alkyl group, substituted or non substituted aryl qroup,<br>
substituted or non substituted aralkyl group,<br>
substituted or non substituted heterocyclyl group,<br>
substituted or non substituted heterocyclylalkyl group,<br>
their stereoisomers and/or mixtures thereof.<br>
In another aspect the invention is aimed at a process<br>
for obtaining these compounds of formula (I) comprising the<br>
reaction, resulting in inverting the configuration of the<br>
carbon atom in position 4, of a compound of formula (III)<br><br>
wherein n is 0, 1 or 2,<br>
with a compound of formula (IV)<br><br>
wherein R1 and R2 are those previously defined,<br>
in  the  presence  of  a  phosphine  and  a  dialkyl<br>
azadicarboxylate.<br>
The invention is also aimed at a process for obtaining a<br>
compound of formula (II)<br><br>
5<br><br>
its stereoisomers or mixtures thereof, wherein n and R1 are<br>
those previously defined, comprising deprotecting the amino<br>
group of a compound of formula (I) as it was previously<br>
defined. One variant of the process is aimed at obtaining<br>
alkylamines with a trans stereochemistry.<br>
Finally in another aspect, the invention is also aimed<br>
at a process for the synthesis of (4S, 6S)-4-(N-ethylamino)-<br>
5,6-dihydro-6-methyl-4H-thieno-[2,3-b]-thiopyran-2-<br>
sulfonamide-7,7-dioxide (Dorzolamide) comprising at least one<br>
of the two previously defined processes.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The inventors have found a new synthetic route for<br>
diastereoselectively preparing 4-(N-alkylamino)-5,6-dihydro-<br>
4H-thieno-[2,3-b]-thiopyrans of general formula (I), useful<br>
for forming drugs for controlling ocular hypertension, such as<br>
dorzolamide for example. Starting from a hydroxyl group with a<br>
defined configuration (cis or trans, preferably cis) in<br>
position 4, the corresponding alkylamines with the opposite<br>
configuration {trans or cis, preferably trans) are obtained by<br>
means of a transformation of the following type:<br><br>
6<br><br>
Surprisingly, the sulfonamide intermediates of general<br>
formula (I) are stable and solid that do not give rise to<br>
decomposition products. Furthermore the first reaction is<br>
completely diastereoselective with inversion of the<br>
configuration. An additional advantage is that the reaction<br>
conditions are mild and the reagents are not at all hazardous.<br>
The two-step synthesis reaction has very high yields and the<br>
obtained products are easy to purify.<br>
Although Mitsunobu conditions have been used to convert<br>
alcohol to amines beforehand, in the case of the structures at<br>
hand the formation of elimination byproducts and the loss of<br>
stereochemical control on the carbon involved would be<br>
expected, as mentioned in US 5,391,772 (col. 2, 1. 44-col. 3,<br>
1. 10), resulting in mixtures requiring complicated<br>
purifications and therefore will little industrial<br>
application. Despite this fact, it has surprisingly been found<br>
that the amination reaction using nitrobenzenesulfonylamines<br>
occurs quickly and cleanly with the inversion of the<br>
configuration and with high yields giving rise to a stable<br>
compound which can be easily isolated, having the N directly<br>
protected by means of a group that can subsequently be easily<br>
eliminated.<br>
Therefore an object of the invention is the compounds of<br>
formula (I):<br><br>
7<br><br>
wherein n is 0, 1 or 2, R1 is a linear or branched alkyl<br>
group, R2 is selected from a substituted or non substituted<br>
alkyl group, substituted or non substituted aryl group,<br>
substituted or non substituted aralkyl group, substituted or<br>
non substituted heterocyclyl group, substituted or non<br>
substituted heterocyclylalkyl group, their stereoisomers<br>
and/or mixtures thereof.<br>
In a variant of the invention the compound has n = 0 or<br>
2, n is preferably 2. In this case the intermediate is<br>
especially useful for preparing dorzolamide.<br>
In another variant the group R1 is an alkyl group with 1-<br>
4 carbon atoms, preferably ethyl.<br>
In another variant of the invention, R3 is a substituted<br>
or non substituted aryl group. Preferably R2 is a benzene<br>
group such as 2-nitrobenzene or 4-nitrobenzene.<br>
The compounds of the invention are especially useful<br>
when they have the trans configuration, including the<br>
corresponding enantiomers or mixtures thereof.<br>
The following compounds are particularly preferred among<br>
the compounds of the invention:<br>
4-[N-ethyl-N-(2-nitrobenzenesulfonyl)amino]-5,6-dihydro-<br>
6-methyl-4-H-thieno-[2,3-b]-thiopyran-7,7-dioxide,<br>
4-[N-ethyl-N-(4-nitrobenzenesulfonyl)amino]-5,6-dihydro-<br>
6-methyl-4-H-thieno-[2,3-b]-thiopyran-7,7-dioxide,<br>
4-[N-ethyl-N-(2-nitrobenzenesulfonyl)amino]-5,6-dihydro-<br>
6-methyl-4-H-thieno-[2,3-b]-thiopyran,<br>
their stereoisomers or mixtures thereof.<br>
As previously mentioned,  the  trans stereoisomers  of<br><br>
8<br>
these compounds are preferred, i.e.:<br>
trans-4-[N-ethyl-N-(2-nitrobenzenesulfonyl)amino]-5,6-<br>
dihydro-6-methyl-4-H-thieno-[2,3-b]-thiopyran-7,7-dioxide,<br>
trans-4-[N-ethyl-N-(4-nitrobenzenesulfonyl)amino]-5,6-<br>
dihydro-6-methyl-4-H-thieno-[2,3-b]-thiopyran-7,7-dioxide,<br>
trans-4-[N-ethyl-N-(2-nitrobenzenesulfonyl)amino]-5,6-<br>
dihydro-6-methyl-4-H-thieno-[2,3-b]-thiopyran,<br>
as well as their enantiomers or mixtures thereof.<br>
A compound that is particularly preferred due to its<br>
direct usefulness for the synthesis of dorzolamide is:<br><br>
wherein R2 has the previously mentioned meaning.<br>
In  this  description,  the  following  terms  have  the<br>
-indicated meaning:<br>
"Alkyl" refers to a saturated, linear or branched,<br>
hydrocarbonated chain radical that can have between 1 and 12<br>
carbon atoms and is joined to the rest of the molecule by<br>
means of a single bond, for example, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl,<br>
i-propyl, n-butyl, t-butyl, n-pentyl, etc. If they are<br>
substituted, they can be substituted by one or more<br>
substituents such as aryl, halogen, hydroxyl, alkoxyl,<br>
carboxyl, cyano, carbonyl, acyl, alkoxycarbonyl, amino, nitro,<br>
mercapto, alkylthio, etc. If it is substituted by aryl, a<br>
radical "aralkyl", such as benzyl and phenethyl, is obtained.<br>
If it is substituted by heterocyclyl, a radical<br>
"heterocyclylalkyl" is obtained.<br>
"Aryl" refers to single-ring and multi-ring radicals,<br>
both separated and condensed. Typical aryl groups contain from<br>
1 to 3 separated or condensed rings and from 6 to about 18<br>
ring carbon atoms,  such as  a radical phenyl,  naphthyl,<br>
diphenyl, indenyl, phenanthryl or anthracyl, among others. If<br><br>
9<br>
it is substituted, it can have one or more substituenrs, such<br>
as hydroxyl, mercapto, halogen, alkyl, phenyl, alkoxyl,<br>
haloalkyl, nitro, cyano, dialkylamino, aminoalkyl, acyl,<br>
alkoxycarbonyl, etc.<br>
"Heterocyclyl" refers to a stable radical having a 3 to<br>
15 member ring consisting of carbon atoms and from one to five<br>
heteroatoms selected from the group consisting of nitrogen,<br>
oxygen and sulfur, preferably a 4 to 8 member ring with one or<br>
more heteroatoms and, more preferably, a 5 or 6 member ring<br>
with one or more or heteroatoms. It may or may not be<br>
aromatic.<br>
As previously mentioned, another object of the invention<br>
is a process for preparing the compounds of formula (I),<br>
comprising the reaction, resulting in inverting the<br>
configuration in the carbon atom in position 4, of a compound<br>
of formula (III)<br><br>
wherein n is 0, 1 or 2, with compound of formula (IV)<br><br>
wherein R1 and R2 are those previously defined,<br>
in the presence of a phosphine and a dialkyl azadicarboxylate.<br>
The carbinol of formula (III) is known and can be<br>
obtained, for example, according to the methodologies<br>
described in US 5,157,129 and US 5,760,249.<br>
In a variant of the process of the invention,  the<br><br>
10<br>
phosphine is triphenylphosphine (PPh3) . In another variant,<br>
dialkyl azadicarboxylate is diisopropyl azadicarboxylate<br>
(DIAD) or diethyl azadicarboxylate (DEAD), although DIAD,<br>
which is more stable, is preferred.<br>
Regarding the sulfonamide (IV) used, it can be easily<br>
obtained by reacting a sulfonyl chloride with the<br>
corresponding alkylamine. For example, N-ethyl-2-<br>
nitrobenzenesulfonamide is preferably obtained by reacting 2-<br>
nitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride with aqueous ethylamine at 0-<br>
5°C.<br>
The reaction of 4-hydroxy-5,6-dihydro-4H-thieno-[2,3-b]-<br>
thiopyran (III) with sulfonamide (IV) is preferably carried<br>
out under nitrogen atmosphere in an aprotic solvent such as<br>
acetonitrile, methylene chloride, tetrahydrofuran, toluene,<br>
etc. The preferred solvent is toluene, given that some<br>
compounds of general formula (I) can precipitate in the<br>
reaction medium and can be isolated by simple filtration,<br>
preventing extractions or other more complicated separations.<br>
In the described reaction, it is, preferably that the<br>
reaction temperature be about -35°C to 200C. A preferred range<br>
is from -30°C to 0°C.<br>
Once the reagents are added, the reaction is maintained<br>
under stirring until the transformation has concluded. If a<br>
precipitate forms it can be filtered, the solid washed for<br>
example with cold toluene, acetonitrile or methylene chloride<br>
and dried.<br>
The process of the invention described above is<br>
characterized by being completely diastereoselective, such<br>
that if the center 4 has configuration S in compound (III), a<br>
compound (I) with configuration R is obtained in position 4.<br>
And if cis- (III) is used as a starting material, trans-(I) is<br>
obtained. This is very important for obtaining pure<br>
pharmaceutical products by preventing mixtures of<br>
diastereomeros requiring additional separation steps and<br>
reducing the process yield.<br><br>
11<br>
An additional object of the invention is also the<br>
process of deprotecting the compounds of formula (I), i.e. a<br>
process for obtaining a compound of formula (II)<br><br>
its stereoisomers or mixtures thereof, wherein n and R1 are<br>
those previously defined, comprising deprotecting the amino<br>
group of a compound of formula (I) as previously defined.<br>
This reaction is conditioned by the R2 residue. The<br>
suitable selection of this substituent allows the deprotection<br>
reaction to occur easily in mild conditions known in organic<br>
synthesis.<br>
When R- is, for example, 2-nitrophenyl or 4-nitrophenyl,<br>
deprotection is carried out by reaction with potassium<br>
phenylsulfide. In a typical process a solution of benzenethiol<br>
in acetonitrile is prepared and treated with an aqueous<br>
solution of potassium hydroxide at 0°C to 10°C. The compound<br>
of formula (I) is loaded in the resulting mixture and heated<br>
at 40-50°C, until the transformation has concluded. During the<br>
transformation the reaction mixture goes from being a<br>
suspension to a solution. Once the transformation has<br>
concluded the mixture is treated with water, the volatiles are<br>
distilled and then the compound of formula (II) is extracted<br>
with an organic solvent, preferably ethyl acetate. The<br>
compound of formula (II) is isolated in said extraction.<br>
Alternatively, the compound of formula (II) can be<br>
isolated, if desired, as an organic or inorganic acid salt by<br>
means of adding the corresponding organic or inorganic acid in<br>
the suitable solvent.<br>
As can be seen, the intermediate (I) and the processes<br>
of the invention previously described are particularly useful<br><br>
12<br>
in the synthesis of dorzolamide. Therefore, an additional<br>
object of the invention is the use of a compound of formula<br>
(I) in a dorzolamide synthesis process and in a dorzolamide<br>
synthesis process comprising a reaction step for reacting a<br>
carbinol (III) and a sulfonamide (IV) as previously described,<br>
or a deprotection step as previously described. In a preferred<br>
variant the process comprises both steps.<br>
The invention is additionally illustrated by means of<br>
the following examples which cannot be interpreted as being<br>
limiting on the scope of the claims.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1: N-ethyl-4-nitrobenzenesulfonamide<br>
70% ethylamine in water (12.7 mL) and methanol (50 mL)<br>
are mixed. It is cooled to 0 - 5°C. 4-nitrobenzenesulf onyl<br>
chloride (10 g) is added portion-wise maintaining the<br>
temperature under 50C. It is stirred for 15 minutes,<br>
maintaining the temperature, until the transformation is<br>
complete. Water (100 mL) is added. It is stirred for 30<br>
minutes maintaining the temperature under 5°C. The reaction<br>
mixture is filtered, the isolated solid is washed with water<br>
and dried, obtaining 8.99 g of N-ethyl-4-nitrobenzene-<br>
sulfonamide.<br>

phosphine (8.42 g) are mixed under nitrogen atmosphere. The<br>
mixture is cooled to under -20°C and diisopropyl<br>
azadicarboxylate (5.9 mL) is added, maintaining the<br>
temperature under -20°C. The temperature is allowed to rise to<br>
20 - 25°C. The obtained mixture is treated with 5% NaOH (125<br><br>
13<br>
mL) and the resulting organic phase is vacuum distilled to<br>
dryness. The residue is chromatographed in a column (ethyl<br>
acetate / heptane, 2/1), obtaining 4.97 g of trans-4-[N-<br>
