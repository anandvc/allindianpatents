FIELD OF THE INVENTIONi:<br>
This invention is related to an effective method for the preparation of attrition resistant binder matrix containing non-templated zeolites useful for fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) addtive composition specfically non-templated pentasii shape selective zeolites having fault structure as one of the active component dispersed in silica-alumina phosphate-clay matrix. The invention more specficaliy related to a method for the preparation of active FCC additive composite comprising crystalline non-templated pentasii zeolites, aluminium phosphate and clay components having improved thermal / hydrothermal stability with high degree of attrition resistance which are particularly effective in catalytic cracking of high molecular hydrocarbon feedstocks to produce more LPG (liquifled Petroleum Gas) with high C4 &amp; C3 yield. Broadly, this invention contemplates a FCC additive which comprises a non-templated zeolite pentasii type with stacking disorders in Its framework structure, alumina phosphate and clay components formulated and spray dried and a specific heat treatment to get stabilized surface areaof about 50 m2./g which does not change on steaming and also retains the structure and texture of ts (addtive) constituents.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
FCC additives containing zeolites are widely used In the petroleum refining<br>
Industries to Increase/enhanced gasoline octane and yelld light olefins. At present, various complexes of alumina, alumina-silicate compounds, silica, magnesia, chromia, zirconia, gallium, germinium etc., are the materials most widely employed as binders. Those skilled In the art also with appreciate that regardless of the specffic catalytic duties to which a given binder material Is put in a given fluid catatytic  process, elutratin losses with occur when particles of<br><br>
different sizes, shapes and/or velocities undergo inter-particle impacts. Such impacts tend to shatter or otherwise damage the matrices of all such materials, Hence smaller and smaller fragments are constantly being formed and subsequently lost via cyclone elutration of the resulting smaller particles. Fragments having diameters of less than about 20 microns are especially susceptible to elutration losses.<br>
Other losses occur as a result of differences of two or more catalyst species used in the same fluid process, I.e. to say that many modern catalytic processes, It Is not at ail uncommon to have number of different kinds of catalyst species simultaneously circulating through a reaction system In order to carryout distinctly different catalytic functions. Consequently, classification and sequestration are often caused by action of mass of reaction vapors sweeping through and separating different kinds of catalyst particles according to their densfty differences. Consequently, use of the very same binder material to make different catalyst species is a widely employed practice since it tends to create like densities in different particle species.<br>
Synthetic zeolites comprise a large group of catalytic materials of great Interest to commercial operations. The pentasii group of zeolites are by far most important catalysts in petroleum cracking operations. In such operations, zeolites are generally combined with one or more amorphous catalyst or binder In the same particle.<br>
Pentasii class zeolites are typically medium pore (5.0-5.8 A pore dia) high silica, microporous crystalline materials. These are generally synthesized fol;owing (emplated as well as non-templated process methods. Generally, non-templated<br><br>
methods produce Intergrowths or stacking disorders generated during hydrothermal synthesis step. It Is well known that even small number of planar faults can have a dramatic effect on a zeolite's microscopic properties. The product distribution obtain from certain catalytic test reactions, such as hydrocracklng. also depend on the geometries of the pore spaces within which they occur. Cartain different reaction studies have been reported [(1) Acta Phys. Chem. 31, 487 1986 and (iO Zeolites 9, 423, 1989] and catalytic data also been related quantitatively to Intergrowth occurrence In the pentast family (Stud. Surf. Scl. Catal. No. 33,1987. Amsterdam: Elsevier).<br>
US Patent No. 63S5S91 diseases a process for the preparatton of fluid catalytic cracking catalyst additive composition comprising 4 to 20 wt % aiuminum phosphate composite, 1 to 40wt % crystalline molecular sieve zeolites and 40 to 90 wt % clay. The catalyst is prepared by the steps of reacting aiuminum metal powder withh phosphoric add to obtain aluminum phosphate; and the aluminum phosphate is then dried and calcined at a temperature of 538°C for 1 hour. The calcined aluminium phosphate thus obtained is mixed with a slurry containing clay and zeoltte slurry, under high sheer mixing to obtain a slurry, followed by spray drying, and calcining the same to obtain the catalyst micropores. Therefore, It uses aluminium powder to lead to the aluminium phosphate sol/gel which Is then dried, calcined and then used for further steps. Further, the ^uid sol fills up the mkcropores of the penfasil crystalline voids which reduces the efficiency of the Pentasil catalyst in reactions.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of this invention is to propose a process for the preparation of an improved zeolite based additives for increasing LPG yield during catalytic cracking of vacuum gas oil.<br><br>
Another object of this Invention Is to propose a process for the preparation of an Improved zeolite based additives for increasing LPG yield during catalytic craclcing of vacuum gas oil comprising defect structure Pentasil/.alumlna phosphate and clay which is resistant to attrition and selective for the production of LPG (liquid petroieum gas).<br>

Having described the basic aspects of the present invention the following specific examples are given to illustrate specific preferred embodiments.<br>
Example 1<br>
This example describes the preparation of FCC additive containing synthetic zeolite Pentasll type modified power formed into an attrition resistant material using alumino phosphate/Clay binder. The synthetic zeolite Pentasll is our commercial product (NUZ005) having defect structure features and silica to alumina mole ratio of 50, BET surface area 415 m2/g and particle density 0.5 g/cc and the Kaolin clay (Cannary grade) was obtained from Thapar group company. India.<br>
9.03 Kg. of aluminium-nitrate nonahydrate were dissolved &amp; diluted with 15 Kg of deionised water to get about 60 weight percent AI(N03)3 solution. 14.6 Kg of the above diluted Al-nitrate solution were withdrawn and mixed with 4.01 Kg. of 85% orthophosphoric acid (H3P04) under high shear stirring. There was an immediate increase in the viscosity of the resulting aluminum—phosphate sol/gel slurry which was then aiiowed to pass through the colloidal mill for three times at 5,10 &amp; 15 settings (Frigmairies/lndia). The pl-l of the resulting slurry (1) was 2.0 4.2 Kg<br><br>
of H- Penfasll zeoitte powder were added to 19.8 Kg of deionised wafer under stirring and to this slurry (11) 19.55 Kg of dry meta-Kaolln clay was added wittt constant stirring. Finally both the slurries i &amp; 11 were mixed together and again allowed to pass through the colloidal mill and the pH of the slurry was 4.0. The slurry was spray dried (Alro(herm-india) to produce particles of approximately 60—65 micron size. The spray dried product (about 35 Kg) was calcined in air for one hour at 600°C The calcined FCC additive particles were then tested for their resistance to attrition and found to have an Attrition Index of 1.5 Particle density was found to be 0.65 g/cc.<br>
Example 2<br>
In order to improve the particle density this example demonstrate the use of calcined dealuminated Kaolin Clay as one of the component/ingredient In FCC additive matrix. 20 Kg of Cannery grade Kaolin clay was treated with 0.1 N Hydrochloric acid at room temperature and then washed with sufficient deionised water till free of chioride ions and dried at 120°C for 5 hours. The acid treated Kaolin was calcined in air at 770°C for one hour.<br>
Example  3<br>
FCC additive containing high silica: Alumina ratio (SiO2/AbO3=150) Pentasil zeolite with defective co-crystaliised phase.<br>
11.0 kg of aluminum nitrate nonanhydrate were dissolved in 20.0 Kg of deionised water to yield about 55 wt % AI(N03)3 solution. 4.5 kg of 85% FbP04 was directly added to the above AI(N03)3 solution under strong stirring. The resulting highly viscous gel was allowed to aged to room temperature for 12 hours and then allowed to pass through the colloidal mill under the conditions described in<br><br>
example 1. The pH of the resuting slurry (I) was 1.9 6.0 kg of H-Pentasll (SAR 150) zeolte powder were slurried by adding 30 kg of delonlsed water under stirring and to this slurry (II) 25 kg of dry preacidified Kaolin clay was added with constant stirring.<br>
Both slurry (I) &amp; (II) were mixed at room temperate and allowed to pass through the coliotdal mill and pH value of the resulting homogenised gel was adjusted to 4.8 ±0.23. The spray dried product of the above slurry was calcined at 650°C for 2 hours. The FCC additive formulated matrix particles were then tested for their resistance to attrition and found to have an index of 1.2 with particle denstly of 0.7 g/cc.<br>
Example 4<br>
This example illustrates the preparation of FCC additive containing 15 wt % of ammonium exchanged form of Pentasli (SAR 80, NH3+ form) zeolite formed Ho a spray dried product using alumina phosphate and Kaolin.<br>
The procedure and composition for the formulation of FCC additive in this example was same a per example 1, except 15 wt % of NH3 Pentasli powder having silica: alumina mole ratio of 80 was used replacing H- Pentasli of ratio 50.<br>
The calcined spray dried particles of FCC additive had an attrition resistance Index of 1.8 having BET surface area of 47 m2/g.<br>
Example 5<br>
256 g of about 60 wt % of AI(N03)3 9 H2O solution were added to 100 g of 42% of Orthophosphoric acid solution under stirring until mixed to yield homogenised<br><br>
ge!. The pH of me gel was less than 1.0 80 g of zeolite Pentasil (SiO:::Al203 40 ratio), 320 g of preacididfied Kaolin clay and 336 g of DM water were all together addded to previously made slurry of alumino-phosphate under high shear stirring. The pH of resulting slurry was adjusted to a value of 6.0+ 0.2 by adding 25% liquid ammonia The entire slurry was then passed through colloidat mill thrice as illustrated at example 1. The physico-chemical properties of spray dried and calcined FCC additive produced are presented in Table 1.<br><br>
Examples 6 to 10<br>
These examples illustrates the effect of different composition of alumino-phosphate in terms of their At; PO4 ratios on the physico-Chemical properties of final FCC additive products obtained. The method of preparation was same as adopted at example 1. The relevant data is presented In Table 2. The data reveals that as the AI:P04 mole ratio in alumino-phosphate compcslticn increases i.e. to say moles of PO4 decreases then it weakens the binding ability during the formulation which in turn affects attrition a density properties of FCC additive composite. By optimizing the Al; PO4 ratio, it was possible to get the required attrition index and the density of the final product.<br><br><br>
Example 11<br>
This example illustrates the use of FCC addltrve samples selected from example 9 along with FCC catalyst for cracking test procedure as per in accordance with ASTM D 3907-80. Cracking conditions were 485°C, 3:1 Caialyst:oil ratio, 5.0 gms of catalyst used, 1. 25 minute feed Injection followed by a 10 minute nitrogen purge. The feed was a gas oil having a bolting range 370°C -490°C at atmospheric pressure. Test results are summerized in Table 3.<br><br>
Table-3 MAT Conversion Data as per ASTM Procedure A-100% FCC- Catalyst (Commerical) and B-4% additive +96% FCC catalyst Feed -VGO (standard feed-IBP-250°C, FBR-170°C)<br><br>
Test data at Table 3 clearly show that the FCC additive has contributed in boosting LPG yield to the tune of 36.13 wt% as compared to 18.08 wt% from FCC catalyst without additive.<br><br><br><br>
