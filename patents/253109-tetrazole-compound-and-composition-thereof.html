				<td>TETRAZOLE COMPOUNDS AND THEIR USE AS METABOTROPIC GLUTAMATE<br>
RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a new class of compounds, to pharmaceutical compositions containing said compounds and to the use of said compounds in therapy. The present invention further relates to processes for the preparation of said compounds and to new intermediates used in the preparation thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). Glutamate produces its effects on central neurons by binding to and thereby activating cell surface receptors. These receptors have been divided into two major classes, the ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors, based on the structural features of the receptor proteins, the means by which the receptors transduce signals into the cell, and pharmacological profiles.<br>
The metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are G protein-coupled receptors that activate a variety of intraceUular second messenger systems following the binding of glutamate. Activation of mGluRs in intact mammalian neurons elicits one or more of the following responses: activation of phospholipase C; increases in phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis; intraceUular calcium release; activation of phospholipase D; activation or inhibition of adenyl cyclase; increases or decreases in the formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP); activation of guanylyl cyclase; increases in the formation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP); activation of phospholipase Az; increases in arachidonic acid release; and increases or decreases in the activity of voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels. Schoepp et ai, Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 14:13 (1993), Schoepp, Neurochem. Int. 24:439 (1994), Pin etal,Neuropharmacology 34:1 (1995), Bordi and Ugolini, Prog. Neurobiol. 59:55 (1999).<br>
Eight distinct mGluR subtypes, termed mGluRl through mGluRS, have been identified by molecular cloning. Nakanishi, Neuron 73:1031 (1994), Pin et al, Neuropharmacology 34:1 (1995),KnopfelÂ«rfl/., J. Med. Chem. 35:1417 (1995). Further receptor diversity occurs via expression of alternatively spliced forms of certain mGluR subtypes. Pin et al.,<br><br>
PNAS89:10331 (1992), Minakami et al, BBRC 199:1136 (1994), Joly et al, J. Neurosci. 15:3910 (1995).<br>
Metabotropic glutamate receptor subtypes may be subdivided into three groups, Group I, Group II, and Group III mGluRs, based on amino acid sequence homology, the second messenger systems utilized by the receptors, and by their pharmacological characteristics. Group I mGluR comprises mGluRl, mGluRS and their alternatively spliced variants. The binding of agonists to these receptors results in the activation of phospholipase C and the subsequent mobilization of intracellular calcium.<br>
Neurological, psychiatric and pain disorders.<br>
Attempts at elucidating the physiological roles of Group I mGluRs suggest that activation of these receptors elicits neuronal excitation. Various studies have demonstrated that Group I mGluRs agonists can produce postsynaptic excitation upon application to neurons in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and thalamus, as well as other CNS regions. Evidence indicates that this excitation is due to direct activation of postsynaptic mGluRs, but it also has been suggested that activation of presynaptic mGluRs occurs, resulting in increased neurotransmitter release. Baskys, Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 15:92 (1992), Schoepp, Neurochem. Int. 24:439 (1994), Pin et al.,Neuropharmacology 34:1(1995}, Watkins et al, Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 75:33 (1994).<br>
Metabotropic glutamate receptors have been implicated in a number of normal processes in the mammalian CNS. Activation of mGluRs has been shown to be required for induction of hippocampal long-term potentiation and cerebellar long-term depression. Bashir et al., Nature 363:347 (1993), Bortolotto et al, Nature 368:140 (1994), Aiba et al, Cell 79:365 (1994), Aiba et al, Cell 79:311 (1994). A role for mGluR activation in nociception and analgesia also has been demonstrated. Meller et al, Neuroreport 4: 879 (1993), Bordi and Ugolini, Brain Res. 871:223 (1999). In addition, mGluR activation has been suggested to play a modulatory role in a variety of other normal processes including synaptic transmission, neuronal development, apoptotic neuronal death, synaptic plasticity, spatial learning, olfactory memory, central control of cardiac activity, waking, motor control and control of the vestibule-ocular reflex. Nakanishi, Neuron 13: 1031 (1994), Pin et al, Neuropharmacology 34:1, Knopfel et al, J. Med. Chem. 38:1417 (1995). Further, Group I metabotropic glutamate receptors have been suggested to play roles in a variety of acute and chronic pathophysiological processes and disorders affecting the CNS. These include stroke, head trauma, anoxic and ischemic injuries, hypoglycemia, epilepsy,<br><br>
neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, psychiatric disorders and pain. Schoepp etal, TrendsPharmacol. Sci. 14:13 (1993), Cunningham etal, LifeSci. 54:135 (1994), Hollman et al.,Ann. Rev. Neurosci. 77:31 (1994), Pin et al., Neuropharmacology 34:\ (1995), Knopfel et al, J, Med. Chem. 35:1417 (1995), Spooren et al., Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 22:331 (2001), Gasparini et al. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2:43 (2002), Neugebauer Pain 98:1 (2002). Much of the pathology in these conditions is thought to be due to excessive glutamate-induced excitation of CNS neurons. Because Group I mGluRs appear to increase glutamate-mediated neuronal excitation via postsynaptic mechanisms and enhanced presynaptic glutamate release, their activation probably contributes to the pathology. Accordingly, selective antagonists of Group I mGluR receptors could be therapeutically beneficial in all conditions underlain by excessive glutamate-induced excitation of CNS neurons, specifically as neuroprotective agents, analgesics or anticonvulsants.<br>
Recent advances in the elucidation of the neurophysiological roles of metabotropic glutamate receptors generally and Group I in particular, have established these receptors as promising drug targets in the therapy of acute and chronic neurological and psychiatric disorders and chronic and acute pain disorders.<br>
Gastro intestinal disorders<br>
The lower esophageal sphincter (LES) is prone to relaxing intermittently. As a consequence, fluid from the stomach can pass into the esophagus since the mechanical barrier is temporarily lost at such times, an event hereinafter referred to as "reflux".<br>
Gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) is the most prevalent upper gastrointestinal tract disease. Current pharmacotherapy aims at reducing gastric acid secretion, or at neutralizing acid in the esophagus. The major mechanism behind reflux has been considered to depend on ahypotonic lower esophageal sphincter. However, e.g. Holloway &amp; Dent (1990) Gastroenterol. Clin. N. Amer. 19, pp. 517-535, has shown that most reflux episodes occur during transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations (TLESRs), i.e. relaxations not triggered by swallows. It has also been shown that gastric acid secretion usually is normal in patients with GERD.<br><br>
The novel compounds according to the present invention are assumed to be useful for the inhibition of transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations (TLESRs) and thus for treatment of gastro-esophageal reflux disorder (GERD).<br>
The wording "TLESR", transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations, is herein defined in accordance withMzY/a/, R.K., Holloway, R.H., Penagini, R., Blackshaw, L.A., Dent, J., 1995; Transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxation. Gastroenterology 109, pp. 601-610.<br>
The wording "reflux" is herein defined as fluid from the stomach being able to pass into the esophagus, since the mechanical barrier is temporarily lost at such times.<br>
The wording "GERD", gastro-esophageal reflux disease, is herein defined in accordance with van Heenvarden, M.A., Smout A. J. P.M., 2000; Diagnosis of reflux disease. Bailliere's din. Gastroenterol. 14, pp. 759-774.<br>
Because of their physiological and pathophysiological significance, there is a need for new potent mGluR agonists and antagonists that display a high selectivity for mGluR subtypes, particularly the Group I receptor subtype.<br>

Methods of Preparation<br>
Another aspect of the present invention provides processes for preparing compounds of formula I, or salts, solvates or solvated salts thereof. Processes for the preparation of the compounds in the present invention are described herein.<br>
Throughout the following description of such processes it is to be understood that, where appropriate, suitable protecting groups will be added to, and subsequently removed from, the various reactants and intermediates in a manner that will be readily understood by one skilled in the art of organic synthesis. Conventional procedures for using such protecting groups as well as examples of suitable protecting groups are described, for example, in "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", T.W. Green, P.G.M. Wuts, Wiley-Interscience, New York, (1999). It is also to be understood that a transformation of a group or substituent into another group or substituent by chemical manipulation can be conducted on any intermediate or final product on the synthetic path toward the final product, in which the possible type of transformation is limited only by inherent incompatibility of other functionalities carried by the molecule at that stage to the conditions or reagents employed in the transformation. Such inherent incompatibilities, and ways to circumvent them by carrying out appropriate transformations and synthetic steps in a suitable order, will be readily understood to the one skilled in the art of organic synthesis. Examples of transformations are given below, and it is to be understood that the described transformations are not limited only to the generic groups or substituents for which the<br><br><br>
transformations are exemplified. References and descriptions on other suitable transformations are given in "Comprehensive Organic Transformations - A Guide to Functional Group Preparations" R. C. Larock, VHC Publishers, Inc. (1989). References and descriptions of other suitable reactions are described in textbooks of organic chemistry, for example, "Advanced Organic Chemistry", March, 4th ed. McGraw Hill (1992) or, "Organic Synthesis", Smith, McGraw Hill, (1994). Techniques for purification of intermediates and final products include for example, straight and reversed phase chromatography on column or rotating plate, recrystallisation, distillation and liquid-liquid or solid-liquid extraction, which will be readily understood by the one skilled in the art. The definitions of substituents and groups are as in formula I except where defined differently. The term "room temperature" and "ambient temperature" shall mean, unless otherwise specified, a temperature between 16 and 25 Â°C.<br>
The term "reflux" shall mean, unless otherwise stated, in reference to an employed solvent using a temperature at or above the boiling point of named solvent.<br>
Methods of Preparation of Compounds of Formula I<br>
The non-limiting synthetic paths given below, are useful for further preparation of intermediates and of compounds of formula I. Other starting materials used in the preparation of compounds of Formula I are either commercially available or can be prepared via methods described in the literature.<br>
Compounds of formula v are prepared through condensation between aldehydes of formula ii, for example cinnamaldehyde or glyoxalic acid, with arylsulphonylhydrazines iii, such as 4-toluensulfonylhydrazine, in a suitable solvent, for example methanol, ethanol, DMF or dialkylethers, at a temperature between 0 to 100 Â°C, alternatively without solvent under microwave irradiation. Similarly, arylhydrazones of formula vi may be formed from the reaction of arylhydrazine iv, with aldehydes of formula ii. [J. Med. Chem.1980, 23, 631-634; Monatshefte flier Chemie 2001, 403-406; J.Med.Chem. 2000, 43, 953-970; J. Med Chem. 1978,21, 1254-60]<br><br><br>
Diazonium salts of formula viii are available from a suitably substituted aryl or heteroaryl amine of formula vii using well known methods, via diazotization using a nitrite source such as sodium nitrite or isoamyl nitrite in the presence of a suitable acid source such as hydrochloric acid or tetrafluoroboric acid in a solvent such as water at a temperature between -10 to 0 Â°C. In the case where a less soluble counter ion X" is employed, such as tetrafluoroborate, the diazonium salt thus formed may be collected by precipitation and used in subsequent reactions under non-aqueous conditions. Soluble diazonium salts formed using other acid sources may be precipitated by the addition of a suitable reagent such as tetrafluoroboric acid or sodium tetrafluoroborate [Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2004,43,897-900].<br>
Tetrazoles of formula ix wherein G is an electron withdrawing group, such as an olefm, carbonyl or aryl group, may be prepared by 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of a diazonium salt onto an aryl sulfonyl hydrazone followed by elimination of the arylsulfmic acid to generate the tetrazole ring, in protic solvents such as water and alcohol or mixtures thereof, in basic aprotic solvents such as pyridine, or mixtures of these solvents with protic solvents used to generate the diazonium salt. [J.Med.Chem. 2000, 43, 953 - 970] (R1)<br><br>
G<br><br><br>
Tetrazoles of formula ix may also be prepared from the reaction of an arylhydrazone of formula vi with an aryl azide of formula xi, in a suitable solvent such as ethanol or pyridine. [J. Med Chem. 1978, 21, 1254-60] Aryl azides of formula xi may be formed using sodium azide with an aryl diazonium salt of formula x, which may in turn be prepared as described above from an aryl amine, for example aniline or 2,4,6-tribromoaniline. The aryl azide may be considered as a nitrogen transfer reagent since cycloaddition onto the hydrazone is followed by elimination to regenerate the aryl amine precursor to diazonium salt x.<br><br><br>
Typically, G is a group which may be employed as a precursor to the X1-X2-Q(R2)P moiety in compounds of formula I, such as an olefin or carboxylic acid or acid derivative. When G is an aryl olefinic compound of formula xii, derived for example from cinnamaldehyde where R3 is H, the olefin group can be cleaved to provide an aldehyde of formula xiii directly in a one-pot process using a reagent such as ozone or via the diol using a dihydroxylation reagent such as osmium tetroxide followed by subsequent cleavage using a reagent such as lead (IV) acetate. When a substituted cinnamaldehyde is employed the reaction to produce compounds of formula xii, such as a-methylcmnamaldehyde wherein R3 is methyl, a ketone would result from the cleavage of the olefin. [J.Med.Chem. 2000, 43, 953 - 970; Adv. Synth. Catal. 2002, 344, 421-433; "Oxidations in Organic Chemistry", M. Hudlicky, ACS Monograph 186, (1990)]<br>
Aldehydes of formula xiii wherein R  is H may be reduced to primary alcohols of formula xv wherein R3 and R'1 are H, using well known reducing agents such as sodium or lithium borohydride, in a solvent such as methanol, THF or DMF at temperatures between 0-80 Â°C. Secondary alcohols wherein R is not H may also be formed from aldehydes of<br><br>
formula xiii via addition reactions of an organometallic reagent, for example Grignard reagents R4MgX, in a solvent such as THF at temperatures between-78 Â°C to 80 Â°C, and are typically perfornied between 0 Â°C and room temperature. Similarly, ketones of formula xiii, wherein R3 is not H, may be employed to form secondary or tertiary alcohols of formula xv by reduction or addition of an organometallic reagent. Primary alcohols of formula xv, wherein R3 and R4 are H, are also available from compounds of formula xiv, by reduction of acid or ester derivative using reducing agents such as lithium borohydride in a suitable solvent such as THF or DMF at temperatures in the range of 20 - 80 Â°C. Ketones of formula xiii are obtained by treatment of carboxylic acid esters with the appropriate carbon nucleophile, such as Grignard reagents R3MgX according to standard protocols. [J. Med Chem. 1978, 21, 1254-60; J.MedChem. 1993, 36, 2676-2688; Can. J. Chem. 1995,73,885-895]<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Enantiornerically pure or enriched products, as depicted in scheme 4a (R7 is Me or Et; X3 and X as defined in formula I) are obtained by kinetic resolution of racemic or scalemic secondary alcohols using enzyme-catalyzed acetylation with for example polymer bound Candida Antarctica Lipase (Novozyme 435Â®), or other esterases, for example Candida rugosa or Pseudomonaxfluorescens, in organic solvents such as toluene, tert-butyl methyl ether, tert-butanol or DCM at temperatures from 0 to 90 Â°C, using acetylating reagents such as vinyl acetate, other substituted alkyl acetates, pentafluorophenyl acetate or nitro- o halopheny) acetates, which yields the enriched (-R)-acetate and the enriched (S)-alcohol.<br><br>
The (jR)-acetate may be hydrolyzed to the corresponding alcohol by e.g. lithium hydroxide in mixtures of THF and water or by any other methods as described herein below, to yield the opposite enantiomerically enriched or pure alcohol.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Alcohols of fonnula xv may be converted by standard methods to compounds of formula xvi wherein LG is a leaving group. Compounds of formula xvi wherein LG is a halide are formed by the use of reagents such as triphenylphosphine in combination with a halide source such as iodine, N-bromosuccinimide or N-chlorosuccinimide, or alternatively by treatment with tribromophosphine or thionyl chloride. The alcohol moiety in compounds of formula xv may also be transformed to leaving groups LG such as mesylates or tosylates by employing the appropriate sulfonyl halide or sulfonyl anhydride in the presence of a non-nucleophilic base to obtain the corresponding sulfonates. Chlorides or sulfonates can be converted to the corresponding bromides or iodides by treatment with bromide salts, for example LiBr., or iodide salts, such as Lil.<br>
Amine intermediates of formula xvii may be formed using compounds of fonnula xvi. wherein LG represents a leaving group, by displacement of said leaving group using a primary amine, NH2R3 or source of ammonia when R3 is H, or may be formed using the corresponding carbonyl compounds of formula xiii via reductive animation using an<br><br>
amine, NH2R3, in the presence of a suitably mild reducing agent such as NaBt^CN or NaBH(OAc)3 in a suitable solvent such as THF, methanol or 1,2-dichloroethane.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Compounds of formula xxiii containing the dihydro[l,2,4]triazole-3-thione ring may be prepared by initial N-acylation of a 4-alkylthiosemicarbazide of formula xix, using any suitable acylating agent of formula xviii in a suitable solvent, for example pyridine DMF, DCM, THF, or acetonitrile at a temperature from -20 to 100 Â°C. A pre-formed acylating agent such as an acid halide may be employed, or an acid may be activated in situ by the treatment with standard activating reagents such as DCC, DIG, EDC1 or HBTU, with or without the presence of co-reagents such as HOBt or DMAP. Formation of the acyclic intermediate xxii is followed by alkaline ring closure either spontaneously under the conditions of the acylation, or by heating at 50 to 150 Â°C in pyridine or in aqueous solvents in the presence of a base, such as NaOH, NaHCOa or Na2CC&gt;3, with or without co-solvents such as dioxane, THF, MeOH, EtOH or DMF. The acyclic intermediate of formula xxii can also be formed by treatment of an acyl hydrazide of formula xx with a suitable isothiocyanate of formula xxi in a suitable solvent, for example 2-propanol, DCM, THF or the like at temperatures in the range of-20 to 120 Â°C.<br>
Compounds of formula xxiii may be converted to compounds of formula xxv by initial alkylation of the sulphur atom to form intermediates of formula xxiv using primary alkyl halides such as Mel and EtI (alkyl is Me and Et respectively) in MeOH, EtOH, THF, acetone or the like at -30 to 100 Â°C, followed by oxidation of intermediates xxiv using for example KMnO* in mixtures of water and acetic acid, or MCPBA in DCM, at -20 to 120 Â°C, or by using any other suitable oxidant.<br>
3-Amino[l,2,4]triazole compounds of formula xxix, wherein the Rx and Rx groups are equivalent to R2 and R3 in compounds of formula I wherein Q is a monocyclic triazole ring or may together form a ring leading to compounds of formula I wherein the Q group is a bicyclic system containing a fused triazolo ring, may be obtained by treating isothioureas of formula xxvi with either an acyl hydrazide of formula xxvii or in a stepwise manner by treatment with hydrazine followed by an acylating agent of formula xviii. The intermediates of formula xxviii may form a triazole ring by heating at 50 to 200 Â°C in a suitable solvent such as pyridine or DMF. Due to the possibility for cyclization of both<br><br><br>
NHRX groups in compounds of formula xxviii, this reaction works best when symmetrical thioureas are used to avoid a mixture of isomers that may occur when the Rx groups are not identical. When unsymmetrical thioureas are used, the isomers may be separated by chromatographic purification.<br>
The reaction of isothioureas of formula xxvi, in which the S-alkyl (for example S-Me or S-Et) moiety acts as a leaving group upon treatment with hydrazine or acyl hydrazide nucleophile, may be carried out in solvents such as pyridine, methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, THF or the like at temperatures between -20 to 180 Â°C. In the two-step process, the acylation may be carried out in suitable solvent such as THF, pyridine or DMF at -20 to 100 Â°C. As described above, the leaving group LG in acylating agent xviii may include chloro or any other suitable leaving group such as that generated by in situ treatment of the corresponding acid with standard activating reagents. Isothioureas of formula xxvi may be obtained by S-alkylation of the corresponding thioureas with an alkyl halide, for example Mel or EtI, in a suitable solvent such as acetone, EtOH, THF, DCM or the like at temperatures between-100 to 100 Â°C.<br>
Carbon-substituted triazoles of formula xxxiii may be prepared in a similar manner by employing an amide of formula xxx. The amide group may be activated using a reagent such as POCla or Me3OBF4 to generate compounds of formula xxxi such as chloroimidates (LG=C1) or methoxyimidates (LG=OMe). Similar to isothioureas of formula xxvi above, compounds of formula xxxi may react with an acyl hydrazide or hydrazine followed by an acylating agent to generate intermediate xxxii, which may be closed to the triazole spontaneously or by heating. Fused [l,2,4]triazoles wherein the Rx and Rx' groups together<br><br>
form a 5-7 membered ring may be obtained by employing a suitable cyclic lactam instead of an acyclic amide. Such lactam imidates are available from their corresponding lactams by treatment with Me3OBF4 or dimethylsulfate.

Compounds of formula xxiii may be converted to compounds of formula xxxiv by reduction of the thione moiety using a suitable reducing agent such as Raney Nickel, hi a suitable solvent such as ethanol at a temperature between 50 to 100 Â°C, and are typically carried out at 65 Â°C. Compounds of formula xxxv are available from compounds of formula xxxiv by treatment with an aldehyde, for example formaldehyde, in a suitable solvent such as water at a temperature between room temperature to 100 Â°C, and are typically carried out at 37 Â°C when aqueous formalin is used as the source of formaldehyde. The resulting alcohols of fonnula xxxv may be oxidized to provide aldehydes or ketones of formula xxxvi using oxidation procedures well known to the one skilled in the art, such as the employment of MnOa as oxidant, or by Swern oxidation. Alternatively, compounds of formula xxxvii wherein leaving group such as a halide may be prepared from compounds of formula xxxv as described above for alcohols of formula       ^<br><br><br>
Examples of compounds of fonnula I wherein Q is comprised of a monocyclic group include bis amines such as piperazine and homopiperazine, that are connected to X1 or X2 by one N atom in the ring Q. Bis amines such as N-mono-substituted piperazines or piperazines which contain the R2 moiety may be commercially available or may be prepared using methods known to one skilled in the art. Such compounds that are not available commercially may be prepared from amino acids via intermediates such as diketopiperazines, which may be reduced to amines such as piperazines. In certain reactions known to one skilled in the ait, protection of the bis amine of Q is not required and the free amino compound may be used directly, for example in the displacement of the leaving group in compounds of formula xvi. In such cases, or in cases when the protecting group is removed, the free amine may be used to introduce the R2 substituent in compounds of formula xxxviii, since such amines may be employed as nucleophiles in reactions with many types of electrophiles, such as alkyl halides, acid chlorides or anhydrides, chloroformates, carbamoyl chlorides, sulfonyl chlorides, isocyanates, isothiocyanates and the like. Compounds of formula xxxviii may also be obtained from carbonyl compounds of formula xiii using reductive amination conditions as described above for formation of compounds of formula xvii.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
When Q hi formula I is a cyclic diamine such as piperazine and R3 is aryl or heteroaryl, the required nucleophilic reagents (W=H or protecting group) may be prepared by coupling to an aryl halide with the cyclic diamine nucleophile, as shown in Scheme 12a. When the aryl group contains an activating group such as the presence of an adjacent N such as hi 2-<br><br>
pyridine (X=N, other=CR), 2-pyrimidine (X=X5=N or X=X3=N) or 2-pyrazine (X=X4=N), the reaction is facilitated and may occur under heating without additional catalyst. In the presence of additional activating electron withdrawing groups such as ortlio or para NO2 or CN, the reaction may occur at a lower temperature. Aromatic nucleophilic displacement with less reactive phenyl halides may be accomplished by addition of a suitable catalyst / ligand system {Urgaonkar, S.; Xu, J.-H.; Verkade, J.G. J. Org. Chem. 2003, 68, 8416; Urgaonkar, S.; Nagarajan, N.; Verkade, J.G. Org. Lett. 2003, 5, 815).<br>
The Q ring may be constructed from compounds of formula xvii containing a primary amine moiety via any compatible method. One such method wherein the Q ring is a monocyclic bis amine such as piperazine involves ring construction by displacement of two leaving groups from a compound such as that shown in formula xxxix [Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2002, 12,791 - 794; Bioorg. Med. Chern. Lett. 2002, 12, 3195 - 3198; Synthesis 1990, 10, 925-930; J. Org. Chem. 1990, 55,1684-1687].<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Compounds of formula xvii containing a secondary amine are ideally suited for construction of 3-amino-[l,2,4]triazoles asymmetrically substituted on the 3-amino substituent and the 4-N of the triazole ring. Amines of formula xvii may be converted to a wide variety of thioureas of formula xxxxi by reaction with a suitable isothiocyanate in a suitable solvent such as methanol, ethanol and the like, at a temperature between room<br><br>
temperature and 100 Â°C, and are typically carried out at 60 Â°C. Thioureas of formula xxxxi may be converted to compounds of formula xxxxii by conversion to an isothiourea, followed by reaction with an acyl hydrazine and cyclization to the amino triazole as was described above for xxix. In this case since the required (R )m-P-CR R4 group from formula I is already contained in the amine and the amine is secondary, the triazole cyclization has only one option to react through the NHR2 moiety forming compounds of formula xxxxii and not the isomeric triazole.<br><br><br><br><br>
(Figure Removed) <br>
Compounds of formula xxxxii (wherein X2 as drawn in formula I is NR3) may also be prepared by displacement of the leaving group from compounds of formula xvi using a suitable 3-amino[l,2,4]triazole of formula xxix, including those monocyclic triazoles wherein Rx groups become R3 and R2 and those fused triazoles wherein both Rx groups together form a ring, with a strong base such as sodium hydride, in a solvent such as DMF at temperatures between room temperature to 100 Â°C, and are typically performed between 60 - 80 Â°C.<br><br>
N<br><br>
Similarly, compounds of formula xxxxiii (wherein X2 as drawn in formula I is S) may also be prepared by displacement of the leaving group in compounds of formula xvi using a suitable nucleophile such as the dihydro-[l,2,4]triazole-3-thiones which react through their tautomeric [l,2,4]triazole-3-thiol form in the presence of a base such as potassium<br><br>
carbonate or triethylamine, in a suitable solvent such as acetonitrile or DMF, at temperatures between room temperature to 100 Â°C, and are typically performed at room temperature.<br><br>
Compounds of formulae xxxxv and xxxxvi (wherein X2 as drawn in formula I is CR3R4) may also be prepared by displacement of the leaving group in compounds of formula xvi or addition to the carbonyl moiety in compounds of formula xiii using a suitable carbon nucleophile such as contained in a compound of formula xxxxiv, M-CR3R4-Q-(R2)P wherein M is a metal containing species such as Li or MgBr. Such a carbanion may be generated by deprotonation when Q is able to stabilize said carbanion, such as when Q is an aromatic heterocycle such as triazole, using a stronger base, such as n-butyllithium or tert-butyllitliium, or from a insertion of a metal into a carbon-halogen bond such as occurs when a Grignard reagent is created from a compound of formula xvi (LG=Br). Carbanions may be generated and used in ethereal solvents such as THF and diethyl ether alone or as mixtures with alkanes such as pentane or hexane, at temperatures ranging from -78 Â°C to 80 Â°C, and are typically initiated at -78 Â°C and gradually allowed to warm to room temperature after addition of the compound of formula xvi. The reaction of a carbanion with a benzylic mesylate or halide leaving group may be facilitated by addition of a copper salt to generate an organocuprate, whereas a Grignard reagent favors 1,2-addition to a carbonyl even when other options are possible. Similarly alcohols of formula xxxxix may be prepared by the addition of a Grignard reagent of formula xxxxvii, available from compounds of formula xvi (LG=Br), to a carbonyl compound of formula xxxxviii, which for example is equivalent to compounds of formula xxxvi when Q is a tria/ole.<br><br><br><br><br>
Compounds of formula 1 wherein X1 is a C2-alkenyl and X2 is a bond, may be prepared from Wittig reagents generated by treatment of compounds of formula xvi (LG=Br) with a phosphorus reagent such as PPha, in a solvent such as toluene at a temperature between 50 to 100 Â°C, typically at 80 Â°C, followed by treatment of the resulting phosphonium bromide salt with a carbonyl compound of formula xxxxviii, for example when Q is triazole a compound of formula xxxvi, in the presence of a base such as DBU, in a solvent such as DMF at a temperature between 50 to 100 Â°C, typically at 80 Â°C. similarly to the above reactions of Grignard and aldehyde to produce xxxxvi and xxxxix, the partners may be reversed, resulting in this case the same compound 1 due to the symmetry of the bond forming reaction.<br><br><br><br>
Olefmic compounds of formula 1 may be reduced by employing hydrogen in the presence of a metal catalyst such as palladium on carbon in a suitable solvent such as ethyl acetate<br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br>
or ethanol. Alternatively, such olefinic compounds may be reduced by the addition of a suitable reagent, such as dialkylboranes R2BH or trialkylsilylane R3SiH, to the olefm, followed by reductive cleavage of the newly formed bonds. Such intermediates may also be employed in other reactions such as oxidation to generate alcohols of formula xxxxvi or xxxxix.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Analogous compounds of formula lii and liii may also be available by reduction of the alcohol moiety in compounds of formula xxxxvi and xxxxix using a suitable reducing agent, for example a trialkyl- or triaryl-silane in the presence of an acid such as trifluoroacetic acid, either neat or in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane or benzene at a temperature between room temperature and 80 Â°C, preferably at 40 Â°C.<br><br>
(Figure Removed) <br><br><br><br><br>
Compounds of formula liv (wherein X2 is 0 as drawn in formula I and RS^Me or Et and R4=H) may be prepared by bond formation through nucleophilic replacement of a leaving group such as alk-SOs from compounds of formula xxv wherein Q is triazole, by an alcohol or alkoxide nucleophile under basic conditions. The base used may include strong hydridic bases, for example, NaH or milder bases, such as Cs2CO3, at temperatures from 0 to 80 Â°C in polar aprotic solvents such as DMF or acetonitrile, whereas for enantiomerically enriched or pure compound xv (R4=H) the preferred base is CsaCOs in<br><br>
order to obtain enantiomerically pure products liv directly. Other suitable leaving groups may include halogens, such as chloro or bromo.<br><br><br><br>
Compounds of formula Iviii wherein the tetrazole ring is reversed compared to all previous compounds described and X1 and X2 are both CR3R4, may be prepared by nucleophilic reactions of a suitably substituted aryl tetrazole of formula Iv with a suitable electrophilic reagent of formula Ivi. When such an intermediate is available, it may be employed directly in the reaction with the aryl tetrazole of formula Iv, producing compounds of formula Ivii directly. [J.Med.Chem. 1967,10,400-402, Pharm.Chem.J. (English Translation) 1993,27, 204-209]. When such an intermediate is not available, other electrophilic reagents wherein G is a group which may later be converted to the Q-(R2)P moiety may be employed leading to intermediates of formula Ivi. [J.Med.Chem. 1995, 38, 4786-4792; J.Med.Chem. 1992, 35,1191-1200; J.Med.Chem, 1992; 35,1200-1209] For example, an aryl tetrazole of formula Iv may add in the 1,4- or Michael sense to an olefmic compound conjugated to an electron withdrawing G group for example, nitrile, aldehyde, ester and the like, yielding a compound of formula Ivii, wherein some of the R3 and R4 substituents may be H due to the valency requirements of the olefin or the reactivity of said electrophilic olefmic. Several non-limiting examples of electrophiles are listed in the scheme below containing a true leaving group LG such as a mesylate or halide. In such cases, G may also be a -CJ^OPG group (or an equivalent thereof). Alternatively, an internal leaving group X such as an epoxide or activated aziridine wherein the X group is retained in the compound of formula Ivii may be employed. When Q contains a triazole ring, methods that have been described for preceding examples may be employed.<br><br><br><br><br>
It is to be understood by one skilled in the art that when incompatible functional groups are present, such groups may be suitably protected to allow the reaction to proceed. It is also to be understood that products of formula I can also be converted to other products of formula I when suitable functional groups are present. Several non-limiting examples are listed here. When X2 is S, the sulfide of formula I may be oxidized to the sulfoxide and sulfone. When an aryl halide such as iodide or bromide is present, transition metal catalysts such as palladium (0) tetrakis triphenylphosphine may effect transformation of such aryl iodides and bromides to groups such as cyano, alkenyl and aryl or heteroaryl in the presence of suitable coupling agents. When a suitable alcohol or secondary or primary amine is present in formula I, such groups may be alkylated or acylated.<br>

Pharmacology<br>
The pharmacological properties of the compounds of the invention can be analyzed using standard assays for functional activity. Examples of glutamate receptor assays are well known in the art as described in for example Aramori et al, Neuron 8:757 (1992), Tanabe et al., Neuron 8:169 (1992), Miller et al, J. Neuroscience 15: 6103 (1995), Balazs, et al, J. Neurochemistiy 69:151 (1997). The methodology described in these publications is incorporated herein by reference. Conveniently, the compounds of the Invention can be studied by means of an assay that measures the mobilization of intracellular calcium, [Ca2+]j in cells expressing niGluRS.<br>
For FLIPR analysis, cells expressing human mGluRSd as described in WO97/05252 were seeded on collagen coated clear bottom 96-well plates with black sides and analysis of [Ca2+]j mobilization was done 24 h after seeding.<br>
FLIPR experiments were done using a laser setting of 0.800 W and a 0.4 second CCD camera shutter speed. Each FLIPR experiment was initiated with 160 ul of buffer present in each well of the cell plate. After each addition of the compound, the fluorescence signal was sampled 50 times at 1 second intervals followed by 3 samples at 5 second Intervals. Responses were measured as the peak height of the response within the sample period. ECso and ICso determinations were made from data obtained from 8-point concentration response curves (CRC) performed in duplicate. Agonist CRC were generated by scaling all responses to the maximal response observed for the plate. Antagonist block of the agonist challenge was normalized to the average response of the agonist challenge in 14 control wells on the same plate.<br>
We have validated a secondary functional assay for mGluRSd as described in WO97/05252 based on Inositol Phosphate (IPs) turnover. IPs accumulation is measured as an index of receptor mediated phospholipase C turnover. GHEK cells stably expressing the human mGluR5d receptors were incubated with [3H] myo-inositol overnight, washed three times in HEPES buffered saline and pre-incubated for 10 min with 10 mM LiCl. Compounds (agonists) were added and incubated for 30 min at 37Â°C. Antagonist activity was determined by pre-incubating test compounds for 15 min, then incubating in the<br><br>
presence of glutamate (80^M) or DHPG (30 uM) for 30 min. Reactions were terminated by the addition of perchloric acid (5%). Samples were collected and neutralized, and inositol phosphates were separated using Gravity-Fed Ion-Exchange Columns.<br>
A detailed protocol for testing the compounds of the invention is provided in the assay below.<br>
Assay of Group I receptor antagonist activity<br>
For FLIPR analysis, cells expressing human mGluRSd as described in WO97/05252 were seeded on collagen coated clear bottom 96-well plates with black sides and analysis of [Ca2"1"]; mobilization was performed 24 h following seeding. Cell cultures in the 96-well plates were loaded with a 4 (jM solution of acetoxymethyl ester form of the fluorescent calcium indicator fluo-3 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oregon) in 0.01% pluronic. All assays were performed in a buffer containing 127 mM NaCl, 5 mM KC1, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.7 mM NaH2PO4,2 mM CaCl2, 0.422 mg/ml NaHCO3, 2.4 mg/ml HEPES, 1.8 mg/ml glucose and 1 mg/ml BSA Fraction IV (pH 7.4).<br>
FLIPR experiments were done using a laser setting of 0.800 W and a 0.4 second CCD camera shutter speed with excitation and emission wavelengths of 488 nm and 562 run, respectively. Each FLIPR experiment was initiated with 160 \d of buffer present in each well of the cell plate. A 40 |^1 addition from the antagonist plate was followed by a 50 pL addition from the agonist plate. After each addition the fluorescence signal was sampled 50 times at 1 second intervals followed by 3 samples at 5 second intervals. Responses were measured as the peak height of the response within the sample period. ECso/ICso determinations were made from data obtained from 8 points concentration response curves (CRC) performed hi duplicate. Agonist CRC were generated by scaling all responses to the maximal response observed for the plate. Antagonist block of the agonist challenge was normalized to the average response of the agonist challenge in 14 control wells on the same plate.<br>

Cells were incubated overnight (16 h), then washed three times and incubated for<br><br>
1 h at 37Â°C in HEPES buffered saline (146 mM NaCl, 4.2 mM KCl, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1% glucose, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) supplemented with 1 unit/ml glutamate pyruvate transaminase and 2 mM pyruvate. Cells were washed once in HEPES buffered saline and pre-incubated for 10 min in HEPES buffered saline containing 10 mM LiCl. Compounds (agonists) were added and incubated at 37Â°C for 30 min. Antagonist activity was determined by pre-incubating test compounds for 15 min, then incubating in the presence of glutamate (80 uM) or DHPG (30 uM) for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.5 ml perchloric acid (5%) on ice, with incubation at 4Â°C for at least 30 min. Samples were collected in 15 ml Falcon tubes and inositol phosphates were separated using Dowex columns, as described below.<br>

Screening for compounds active against tlesr<br><br>
Adult Labrador retrievers of both genders, trained to stand in a Pavlov sling, are used. Mucosa-to-skin esophagostomies are formed and the dogs are allowed to recover completely before any experiments are done.<br>
Motility measurement<br>
In brief, after fasting for approximately 17 h with free supply of water, a multilumen sleeve/sidehole assembly (Dentsleeve, Adelaide, South Australia) is introduced through the esophagostomy to measure gastric, lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and esophageal pressures. The assembly is perfused with water using a low-compliance manometric perfusion pump (Dentsleeve, Adelaide, South Australia). An air-perfused tube is passed in the oral direction to measure swallows, and an antimony electrode monitored pH, 3 cm above the LES. All signals are amplified and acquired on a personal computer at 10 Hz.<br>
When a baseline measurement free from fasting gastric/LES phase III motor activity has been obtained, placebo (0.9% NaCl) or test compound is administered intravenously (i.v., 0.5 ml/kg) in a foreleg vein. Ten min after i.v. administration, a nutrient meal (10% peptone, 5% D-glucose, 5% Intralipid, pH 3.0) is infused into the stomach through the central lumen of the assembly at 100 ml/min to a final volume of 30 ml/kg. The infusion of the nutrient meal is followed by air infusion at a rate of 500 ml/min until an intragastric pressure of 10Â±1 mmHg is obtained. The pressure is then maintained at this level throughout the experiment using the infusion pump for further air infusion or for venting air from the stomach. The experimental time from start of nutrient infusion to end of air insufflation is 45 min. The procedure has been validated as a reliable means of triggering TLESRs.<br>
TLESRs is defined as a decrease hi lower esophageal sphincter pressure (with reference to intragastric pressure) at a rate of &gt;1 mmHg/s. The relaxation should not be preceded by a pharyngeal signal
