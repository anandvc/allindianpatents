125I-α-Bungarotoxin (BTX) binding to rat hippocampal membranes. Rat hippocampi were homogenized in 20 volumes of cold homogenization buffer (HB: concentrations of constituents (mM): tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane 50; MgCl2 1; NaCl 120; KC1 5: pH 7.4). The homogenate was centrifuged for 5 minutes at 1000 x g, the supernatant was saved and the pellet re-extracted. The pooled supematants were centrifuged for 20 minutes at 12,000 x g, washed, and resuspended in HB. Membranes (30-80 |ig) were incubated with 5 nM [125rjα-BTX, 1 mg/mL BSA (bovine serum albumin), test drug, and either 2 mM CaCl2 or 0.5 mM EGTA [ethylene glycol-bis(p-aminoethylether)] for 2 hours at 21°C, and then filtered and washed 4 times over Whatman glass fibre filters (thickness C) using a Brandel cell harvester. Pretreating the filters for 3 hours with 1% (BSA/0.01% PEI (polyethyleneimine)) in water was critical for low filter blanks (0.07% of total counts per minute). Nonspecific binding was described by 100 uM (~)-nicotine, and specific binding was typically 75%.<br>
Test B - Assay for affinity to the α4 nAChR subtype<br>
[3H7-(-)-nicorine binding. Using a procedure modified from Martino-Barrows and Kellar (Mol Pharm (1987) 31:169-174), rat brain (cortex and hippocampus) was homogenized as in the [125I]α-BTX binding assay, centrifuged for 20 minutes at 12,000 x g, washed twice, and dien resuspended in HB containing 100 μM diisopropyl fluocophosphate. After 20<br><br>
minutes at 4°C, membranes (approximately 0.5 mg) were incubated with 3 nM [3H]-(-)-nicotine, test drug, 1 μM atropine, and either 2 mM CaCl2 or 0.5 mM EGTA for 1 hour at 4°C, and then filtered over Whatman glass fibre filters (thickness C) (pretreated for 1 hour with 0.5% PEI) using a Brandel cell harvester. Nonspecific binding was described by 100 μM carbachol, and specific binding was typically 84%.<br>

IC50 values and pseudo Hill coefficients (nH) were calculated using the non-linear curve fitting program AJLLFIT (DeLean A, Munson P J and Rodbard D (1977) Am. J. Physiol., 235:E97-E102). Saturation curves were fitted to a one site model, using the non-linear regression program ENZFITTER (Leatherbarrow, R.J. (1987)), yielding KD values of 1.67 and 1.70 nM for the 125[H-α-BTX and [3H]-(-)-nicotine ligands respectively. Kj values were estimated using the general Cheng-Prusoff equation:<br>
Ki-[IC50]/((2+([ligand]/[KDJ)n),/n - 1)<br>
where a value of n=l was used whenever nH1.5. Samples were assayed in triplicate and were typically ±5%. Ki values were determined using 6 or more drug concentrations. The compounds of the invention are compounds with binding affinities (Ki) of less than 1000 nM in either Test A or Test B, indicating that they are expected to have useful therapeutic activity.<br>

The residue was purified by reverse phase HPLC on a C-18 column using a gradient of 0-50% acetonitrile and 0.1 % aqueous trifluoroacetic acid as the eluant. The product-containing fractions were evaporated and the product was dissolved in a small volume of methanol (ca. 5 ml), and excess hydrogen chloride (1 M solution in ether, appr. 5 ml) was added.
