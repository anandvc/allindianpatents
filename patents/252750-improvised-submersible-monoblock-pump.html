Here, enameled copper wire Is substituted for PVC insulated winding wires. A lightweight die cast aluminum rotor is used In place of the copper rotor. In conventional pumps, gun metal bushes are used, which wear out fast. To overcome this drawback, ball bearings have been used here, which gives better life and eliminates sound pollution.

				<td>This invention relates to the improvements incorporated in a submersible monoblock pump.<br>
In this IMPROVISED SUBMERSIBLE MONOBLOCK PUMP', the wmdings and bearings are oil lubricated, contrary to the conventional Submersible Monoblock Pumps, which are lubricated by water. Oil is the most suitable lubricating agent and accordingly the lubricating properties of transformer oil has been made use of in this 'IMPROVISED SUBMERSIBLE MONOBLOCK PUMP'. Accordingly, the pump has been suitably amended to incorporate the oil lubricating system, through a duct emanating from the transformer for lubricating the enameled copper wire, ball bearings and the aluminum die casting rotor. Transformer oil absorbs heat that is created inside the motor thereby increasing the life of the motor. In the conventional pumps, water must be filled in the motors in order to lubricate the windings of the bearings. This would normally result in carry over of water to the other parts of the system in spite of seals being used, which would result in rapid rust formation, corrosion and deterioration of the various accessories early. However, in this IMPROVISED SUBMERSIBLE MONOBLOCK PUMP', because of the oil lubrication system, these draw backs have been overcome.    Further,   as   a  matter   of abundant  safety,   to   ensure<br>
- 2 -<br><br>
that silts do not enter the motor, oil seals have been provided at the ^propriate places.<br>
Enameled copper wire is used in this IMPROVISED SUBMERSIBLE MONOBLOCK PUMP in place of the PVC insulated winding wires, which are used in the conventional pumps.<br>
In the conventional pumps, gunmetal bushes are used which wear out fast. In order to overcome this drawback, ball bearings are used which have a better life and this has also resulted in total elimination of the sound pollution. Further, the use of the ball bearings in place of gunmetal bushes aids in proper torque maintenance, which ensures free run of the motor. This results in good performance of the IMPROVISED SUBMERSIBLE MONOBLOCK PUMPS as the discharge is good and the performance is higher than the conventional ones. Discharge has been found to be up to 20,000 liters per hour<br>
In this IMPROVISED SUBMERSIBLE MONOBLOCK PUMP, there is no necessity for any bushes, as the design of the pump is such. Wherein,<br><br>
the use of bushes is a must in the conventional submersible monoblock pumps. Use of bushes means frequent wear and tear, which consequents in frequent replacement of bushes. This anomaly has been overcome in this IMPROVISED SUBMERSIBLE MONOBLOCK PUMP.<br>
In case of Conventional Submersible Pumps, the rotor is made of copper and consequently the rotor is very heavy, because of which it becomes difficult handling at the time of overhaul. However, in this IMPROVISED SUBMERSIBLE MONOBLOCK PUMP, the rotor is die cast out of aluminum, which is of lighter weight, consequent to which overhauling of the pump is easier now. Further, this has resulted in considerable weight reduction of the entire submersible monoblock pump unit, which goes a long way in easy installation of the pump.<br>
The use of enamel winding in place of PVC insulated wires in this IMPROVISED SUBMERSIBLE MONOBLOCK PUMP is ideal for low voltage and can also withstand voltage fluctuations, consequent to which the savings on power is to the tune of 50%. Further, this system is suitable for both, single phase and three phase connections.<br><br>
In this IMPROVISED SUBMERSIBLE MONOBLOCK PUMP*, the<br>
rotor of the pump could be pulled out from the back, which is very ideal for easy overhaul, which results in a considerable saving of time at the time of overhaul.<br>
The various parts that from this IMPROVISED SUBMERSIBLE MONOBLOCK PUMP' have been sketched in the accompanying drawing sheet. (1) depicts the cast iron doom and (2) is the cast iron front cover. (3) is the rubber *'0" ring and (4) is the ball bearing, which has been used in place of gun metal bushes. (5) is an eyebolt made of mild steel, which secures the seamless pipe motor body (8) in place. (6) depicts the die cast rotor made of aluminum, in place of copper rotors that are used in the conventional ones. (7) is the silicon stator and (8) the seamless pipe motor body. (9) is the M. S. End Ring and (10) is the S. S. ShaA. (U) is the copper winding which has been used in place of the PVC insulated winding wires. (12) is the S. S. Stud and (13) is the cast iron back cover, which has to be dismantled for taking the rotor out. (14) is the Nylon wire guard and (16) the Nylon cap. (15) is the three core flat cable and (17), the M. S. Leg. (18) is the transformer oil which has been used as  the   lubricating   agent   in   place   of water,   as   compared<br>
- 5 -<br><br>
with the conventional pumps.	(19) is a cast iron impeller and (20) the cast Iron<br>
Suction flange.    (21) is the	Nylon sand guard, which prevents sand from<br>
entering inside of the motor.	(22) is the rubber oil seal and (23) the cast iron<br>
delivery flange.<br>
The incorporation of all these features in this IMPROVISED SUBMERSIBLE MONOBLOCK PUMP has not only increased the efficiency of the system substantially, but also has reduced the pumping time and the power consumption. Further, cost wise it is 50% less than that of wet type submersible monoblock pumps, in spite of providing so manv facilities<br><br><br>
1 Claim,<br>
1)    An   IMPROVISED SUBMERSIBLE MONOBLOCK PUMP',<br>
wherein the rotor (6) of the pump is mounted on ball bearings (4) and the lubrication for such ball bejffings is through a duct provided from the transformer to the ball bearings in such a manner that transformer oil (18) itself is used for lubricating the ball bearings.<br><br></td>
