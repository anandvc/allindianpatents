				<td>Network Device Configuration<br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention relates to connecting to the internet via a data connection which connection is remotely configurable as to access permissions. The connection may be via a modem or via a direct network connection.<br>
Background Art<br>
Connection of network devices to a network typically require the attendance of a person on site to cany out the initial configuration of the device. For example, connection of a users business to the internet for access by internal parties may be by ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line) or some other connection protocol. Such a connection is typically via an ADSL modem and may include a router to route incoming data packets and a firewall to stop attempts to intrude into the users data. Typically the configuration of the router and firewall is done on site and will need to be changed on site to cater for variations over time in the users business. This involves a smaller user in expense as it requires specialised IT personnel to come on site to carry out the configuration.<br>
Connections for higher volume users also typically include routers and firewalls connected via a plurality of modems for internet access. Currently these are mainly configured on site by the users skilled personnel. It is known, once the initial configuration is carried out, that the device may be remotely connected to via the network and final configuration carried out.<br>
Typically such a network device will include an operating system of some sort which will be accessible by using an external name and password. Once the correct name and password is entered the remote user may modify the device settings, including settings for any router and firewall. This provides security problems, since it is possible for someone with knowledge of the name and password to alter the modem settings without authority.<br><br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a network device which does not require any on site attendance for configuration of the network device but which is secure or which will at least provide the public with a useful choice.<br>
Prior Art<br>
It is known to provide remotely configured routers to avoid attendance on site, for instance US patent US 6,012,088 shows one such router, however such routers may provide a security problem in that if access is gained to them from one of the networks the router configuration can be changed, and may be changed in such a manner as to compromise security.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an internet connection which does not require on site attendance for configuration of router or firewall but which does provide complete security of the configuration or which will at least provide the public with a useful choice.<br>

Preferably the two network devices are routers. Preferably the routers form part of ADSL modems.<br><br>
The invention may also broadly be said to consist in the parts, elements and features referred to or indicated in the specification of the application, individually or collectively, and any or all combinations of any two or more of the parts, elements or features, and where specific integers are mentioned herein which have known equivalents, such equivalents are incorporated herein as if they were individually set forth.<br>
Brief Description of Drawings<br>
One preferred form of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which,<br>
FIGURE 1     shows a block diagram of one form of network device.<br>
FIGURE 2     shows a flow diagram of the initial mediation procedure which downloads to the network device.<br>
Detailed Description<br>
With reference to Figure 1, the diagram shows a network device consisting of an ADSL connection via a modem 101 to a firewall 102 and router 103 which distributes the data to devices such as PC's 104. The modem acts to convert packets from the firewall router into a form suitable for carrying information over the internet. The firewall 102 acts to restrict what information packets may be transferred into the users system and the router 103 acts to distribute packets to an internal user in accordance with the packet address.<br>
In practice the modem, firewall and router may be combined into a single item of equipment with the configuration data held in a common internal location.<br>
According to the current invention the modem, or firewall or router, has configuration information, which is internally held, but this information is not capable of being changed by any routine or subroutine held in the modem. The only way in which this information can be altered is to download an updated configuration from a remote authority. The only remote authority which the modem recognises are ones which are<br><br>
hard coded into the internal software, and the only action the modem can take as regards configuration is to contact the remote authority in a secure manner. This action can occur either at power on or if an intrusion is detected, or it can be triggered by a specific remote query.<br>
Thus the modem may have instructions in read only memory (ROM) which instruct it to call an address such as 203.17.209.32 upon initial power on, but to otherwise provide no routing of incoming or outgoing data packets. Once the designated address is called and a verification established for the network device from a verification service a secure connection between the modem and the address is set up, preferably by the exchange of encrypted passwords through a secure sockets layer (SSL), and the modems' required configuration is downloaded from a configuration server. This provides the routing configuration required and leaves the modem in a secure state.<br>
The configuration may include any connection data and passwords for connecting the modem to an internet service provider (ISP), and the modem may automatically carry out the connection once configured.<br>
Where the connection between the modem and the server is such that it does not support full public key encryption the authentication for the modem may be provided by a removable key, for instance a USB key.<br>
Should an attempt be made to configure or reconfigure the modem without using the correct encryption from the correct address the modem initialisation software is intended to be re-triggered, resulting in a complete download of the required configuration.<br>
Figure 2 shows how the equipment on powering on at 201 searches for an internet connection at, and on detecting one sends a particular data stream to the remote verification authority at 202, 203 which detects the identity of the calling equipment, and from this can look up the customers identity, the equipments current state, and its desired state as required by the customer. The remote authority then connects a configuration server and initiates the procedure to securely update the equipment at 204 with the desired configuration changes and with the software required to carry out the desired functions. The remote configuration authority can then continue to receive operation reports from the equipment at scheduled intervals.<br><br>
In accordance with the present invention the modem, firewall and router are normally provided as a single equipment item which may also include a hub or switch. This item is installed on the users premises, provided with a connection to the internet and powered up. On detecting the internet connection the equipment identifies itself to the remote verification authority, the only action it is capable of taking.<br>
The remote authority will detect the identification of the calling equipment and validate this against a database of equipment whose setups are stored. If the equipment ID is found the remote authority may then, in secure mode, connect the calling equipment to a configuration service and download to the equipment such configuration details and software as will allow it to perform the desired router/firewall functions.<br>
Preferably the equipment configuration template is held by the remote authority, who may either make changes in it or allow the user to make changes in it via secure internet access. Such changes may be downloaded to the equipment in the same manner as the initial configuration data, though in most instances the remote authority will send a code to the equipment which forces it to reload the configuration.<br>
The firewall and router may maintain the normal statistics of packets passed, addresses sent to or received from, intrusion attempts etc. and may, either on prompting or on schedule, send these details to the configuration authority for storage and possible analysis.<br>
The firewall or router may be set up to pass information through desired ports and may be set to configure these ports on call. Thus if a client requires a VPN connection between two locations which do not have a specific allocated IP address (as for instance a small office served by an ADSL without a fixed address) the client requests the VPN connection from the remote authority, which will have stored the network address of any modem of the inventive type. The remote authority then notifies the network devices of the required connection and the devices then create the VPN connection. Thus a VPN connection can be established between two modems which did not initially know each others addresses..<br>
While the invention is described in relation to an ADSL modem the invention is equally as applicable to the configuration of a PC, a router of any type, a mobile phone or PDA or other similar equipment.<br><br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
The invention is applicable to the guaranteeing of the configuration of a network device, to prevent the compromising of data passing through that device, or the extraction of data in an unintended manner by that device.<br>
Thus it can be seen that at least the preferred form of the invention provides an item of equipment which can be remotely configured for network device set up purposes.<br><br>
