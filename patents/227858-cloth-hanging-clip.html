				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a clothes hanging clip. More particularly this invention concerns to interlocking of clip. These clips are used for holding clothes for drying or otherwise on wire or rope so that they may not fall due to wind and not get dirty.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is known to hang up clothes provided with a pair of elements between which the clothes can be clipped on the wire or rope.<br>
It is also known to hang up a clothes with a clip which has a pair of jaws that can be moved apart so as to grip the cloth on wire or rope.<br>
Many different clips with different locking systems are well known in the Art. But the known clips in the Art fails to hold the clothes properly with adequate force so that clothes may not fall. These prior art clips has poor locking mechanism of pair of elements because of holding these elements from outside.<br>
Further more these outer locking mechanisms of prior art clips gets twisted or distorted while clipping the clothes on rope or wire. It is due to poor design of these types of locking mechanisms. It is also easy for child or otherwise to pull the outer locking mechanism and thereby detach or twist the pair of mating elements which ultimately renders the clip useless.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an improved clothes hanging clip.<br>
Another object is to provide a clip which can hold the clothes firmly on wire or rope.<br>
Yet another object is the provision of such a locking mechanism which is not easy to remove and internally built.<br>
Yet another object is to provide such a mechanism which can provide adequate force for clamping.<br>
Yet another object is to provide a cost effective clip which is not easily twistable.<br>
Therefore there is provided in this clip a specially designed spring to hold the jaws of upper and lower elements or parts apart or together around pivotal points of the elements. One end of the spring is inserted diagonally in the hole on the upper element or part and another end of the spring is inserted diaginally in the hole on the lower element or part.<br>
Prior-art clips can be seen in German Pat. Nos. 1961243 , 2337644 and US 2007007313,CN 1155600, WO9212621 etc.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the present invention in a clothes-hanging clip comprising of a moulded lower element or part (2) having a pivotal part (2a) and an identical<br>
upper moulded element or part (1) having pivotal part (la). A special spring or securing means (3) is braced between these elements or parts such that crocodile jaws of the upper and lower element or part (end A) are pulled towards and pressed against each other. The spring (3) is held in the notches (2b,lb) provided on the moulded lower and upper elements or parts at the pressing end (B).One end of the spring (3) is diagonally inserted in to hole (5) on the lower element or part (2) and another end is diagonally inserted in to hole(4) on the upper element or part (l).The spring (3) is held internally in the notches and not easily removable and along with that it provides adequate force at the jaws for clipping the clothes on the rope or wire. The special spring or securing means held in notches (lb,2b) along with pivotal parts (la,2a) actually forms the novel locking mechanism.<br>
The novel features which are considered as characteristic for the invention are set forth in particular in the appended claims. The invention itself, however, both as to its construction and its method of operation, together with additional objects and advantages thereof, will be best understood from the following description of a specific embodiment when read in connection with the accompanying drawing.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
FIG. 1 is a clip according to this invention;<br>
FIG. 2 is vertical section view of lower element or part of the clip;<br>
FIG. 3 is vertical section view of upper element or part of the clip;<br>
FIG.4 is specially desgin spring used in the clip;<br>
FIG. 5A,B are side and top view of the spring;<br>
FIG.6 and 7 shows vertical section view of prior art clip and its locking element;<br>
FIG. 8 and 9 also shows prior art clip and its locking element; DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
FIG. 1 shows cloth-hanging clip comprising of a moulded lower element or part (2) having a pivotal part (2a) and an identical upper moulded element or part (1) having pivotal part (la). A special spring or securing means(3) is braced between these elements or parts such that crocodile jaws of the upper and lower elements(end A) are pulled towards and pressed against each other. The spring (3) is held in the notches (2b,lb) provided on the moulded lower and upper elements or parts at the pressing end (B).One end of the spring (3) is diagonally inserted in to hole (5) on the lower element or part (2) and another end is diagonally inserted in to hole(4) on the upper element or part(l).The spring (3) is held internally in the notches and not easily removable and along with that it provides adequate force at the jaws for clipping the clothes on the rope or wire.<br>
FIG.2 &amp; 3 shows moulded upper and lower elements or parts (1,2) having holes(4,5) for insertions of the two ends of the spring (3) and thereby holding them there itself.Pivots (2a,la) are also shown whereabouts the lower and upper elements rotates to open the clip for clipping the clothes. Nothches (lb,2b) are provided on each element to hold the spring inside there. One end (A)of these element have serrations making it crocodile jaw so as to avoid slippage on the clothes and other end (B) is meant for pressing so that crocodile jaws can be opened for clipping the cloth. There is further provided notch just after the serrations to hold the wire or rope inside.<br>
The elements or parts 1 and 2 are moulded out of plastic or polymer or may be of some other material which is light in weight and economical.<br>
FIG.4 shows specially designed spring for holding the elements or parts together and also which could effectively provide the adequate force at jaws for holding the clothes on the rope or wire. Two legs or ends of the spring are not in the same plane and are folded at 90 degree so that they may be diagonally inserted in to upper and lower elements or parts.<br>
FIG. 5 A &amp;5B shows the front and top views of the spring.<br>
The spring (3) held in notches (lb,2b) and pivots (2a,la) forms the novel locking mechanism which makes the clip rigid in construction and not easily twistable. Further it also makes the spring not easily removable.<br>
FIG.6 &amp; 7 depicts the vertical setion view of prior art clip and the locking element used in these clips s 1 !G.6 also shows that how this locking element of FIG 7 is placed on the upper and lower elements or parts so as to hold them together and provide force for clipping the cloth.<br>
FIG.8 &amp; 9 shows o her prior art clip and its locking element. This can easily be seen that a child may easily remove these locking elements and which can ultimately render the clip useless.<br>
In use it is possible fir a user to hang a shirt or jacket on a hanger or wire and then the cuffs of a pair of trousers can be forced into the jaws.<br><br>
It will be understood that each of the elements described above, or two or more together, may also find a useful application in other types of applications.<br>
While the invention has been illustrated and described as embodied in a clothes-hanging clip, it is nut intended to be limited to the details shown, since various modifications and structural changes may be made without departing in any way from the spirit of the present invention.<br>
Without further analysis, the foregoing will so fully reveal the gist of the present invention that others can, by applying current knowledge, readily adapt it for various applications without omitting features that, from the standpoint of prior art, fairly constitute essential characteristics of the generic or specific aspects of this invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
