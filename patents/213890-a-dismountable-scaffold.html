The invention relates to a dismountable scaffold, in particular to a facade scaffold, in accordance with the preamble of patent claim 1.<br>
In a known scaffold of this kind (DE 196 33 091 Al),  catches are provided at the end fittings of the individual floor panels which, on mounting of a floor panel on the associated rail section, ensure the end fittings latch so that a lifting of the end fittings from the associated rail section is only pos¬sible after pivoting of the catch into a release position. A design of this kind admittedly ensures that a floor panel is held at the rail section se¬cured against lifting even without a cross brace which contacts its end fit¬tings from above. It is, however, disadvantageous that a movable element in the form of a catch must be provided for this purpose, has to be actu¬ated by suitable measures of the operator for the lifting operation and can be damaged during rough operation on a building site and thereby made partly or wholly inactive.<br>
The object of the present invention thus consists in providing a scaffold of the initially named kind in which the floor panels can, on the one hand, be mounted without problem onto the rail sections and removed from them without the use of movable elements at the rail section and at tlie end fit¬ting, and, on the other hand, in which an undesired lifting, for example by wind or other lifting forces acting from below, is avoided in the mounted position* without the end fittings having to be secured by cverlying cross braces of the scaffold.<br><br>
In order to satisfy this object there are provided the features of the char¬acterizing part of patent claim 1.<br>
The concept underlying the invention is thias to be seen in the fact that, on the one hand, a simple mounting and removal of the floor panels is possible with respect to the associated rail sections solely by a sequence of suitable shifts of a floor panel in the horizontal and vertical direction, and in the fact that, on the other hand, the floor panels are secured in the mounted state against upwaird lifting by wind forces or other forces. The lifting of the floor panel required to render the means providing security against shifting inoperative preferably takes place at one ©ide, and indeed in particular at the front,<br>
The means providing security against lift-out and/or the means providing security against shifting are preferably formed by abutments in accor¬dance with claims 2 and/or 3 <br>
The depth of insertion of each floor panel is advantageously restricted by the measures of claim 4, with the restriction of the depth of insertion be¬ing preferably ensured for the la©t floor panel, when using a plurality of floor panels arranged behind one another, by the vertical support and for each floor panel in front of it by the respective floor panel behind it.<br>
The means for providing security against lift-out is expediently realized in accordance with claim 5. This is a linearly operating bayonet connection between the end fitting and the associated rail section, A preferred practi¬cal embodiment for the abutments providing security against shifting can be found in the claims 6 to 8.<br><br>
An abutment in accordance with claim 9 serving for the positioning is also provided in the pullout direction, at least for the frontmost floor panel, so that on pulling out the floor panel without particular attention by the op¬erator, that position is found in which the means providing security against lift-out has been rendered inoperative. This abutment is preferably formed in accordance with claim 10 by the forwardly disposed vertical support.<br>
The embodiment of claim 11 is provided so that it id possible to bring the abutments providing security against shifting out of engagement, while the abutments providing security against lift-out are still active.<br>
Although the different abutments could in principle be provided on the same side of the rail section, it is however preferred if these abutments are arranged in accordance with claim 12, because then the abutments which provide security against shifting can be conveniently executed between the rail sections as plates, which preferably consist of sheet metaL<br>
Although a single floor panel can basically be provided between two verti¬cal supports and designed in accordance with the invention, it is however advantageous to provide preferably two or more floor panels of like design behind one another in accordance with claim 13, because here easier ma¬nipulation is possible, particularly at a large height, because of the lower weight of the individual floor panels.<br>
In so far as a plurality of floor panels are provided behind one another, the abutments of the rear floor panel, which provide security against shifting, are expediently differently designed from those of the front floor panel in accordance with claim 14.<br><br>
Whereas the abutments of the front floor panel providing security against shifting are so positioned relative to one another that when they come into engagement a lifting of the front floor panel is still not possible, the abutment plates of the rail sections disposed further to the rear are so ar¬ranged that on coming into engagement with the positioning abutments of the end fittings, the means providing security against lift-out has already been rendered inoperative. This design is possible and expedient because, as long as the front floor panel has not yet been removed, the floor panels lying further to the rear are secured by the same measures as the front floor panel against shifting towards the insertion side into a position which makes the lifting possible.<br>
A particularly advantageous further embodiment in accordance with claim 15 signalizes to the operator during the insertion of the floor panels in a particularly forceful maimer whether these have already latched in or are not yet latched in. As long as the abutments providing security against shifting are located on the abutment plates providing security against shifting, between the rail sections, the floor panel sea-saws during han¬dling to the front and to the rear so that the operator gets the feeling that the relevant plate is not yet located in its desired position. Only when the abutment of the end fitting providing security against shifting drops from the abutment plate at the rear into the lowered position does the sea-sawing cease and a signal is given to the user in this way that the floor panel is now located in its final desired position- With a plurality of floor panels arranged behind one another it is sufficient when the frontmost abutment plate providing security against shifting is correspondingly de¬signed.<br><br>
Through the embodiment of claim 16 it is ensured that the floor panels can also extend into the region alongside the vertical supports, so that a broader surface which can be walked on is present. Here the design of the invention proves to be particularly expedient because through the design of claim 16, a certain projection of the floor panels beyond the support surfaces on the rail sections is present, which, if walked on, exerts a tilt¬ing moment onto the floor panels about their longitudinal axis in the sense that they attempt to lift from the rail sections. This is however effec¬tively avoided by the means providing security against lift-out provided in accordance with the invention, so that the projection of the floor panels to the front and to the rear beyond the rail sections does not impair the se¬curity in use.<br>
It is ensured through the embodiment of claim 17 that the opening in the region of the end cutouts with two floor panels arranged contacting one another is secured at the bottom by the positioning plate, which has the advantage that articles falling through this opening are stopped by the abutment plate.<br>
It is made possible, through the embodiment of claim 18, for the means providing security against lift-out to be rendered inoperative by downward swinging of the floor panel about one of the rail sections, whereby the rele¬vant floor panel can be lifted off without shifting in the direction of the rail section but rather by simple downward pivoting* A placement of the floor panel onto the rail section is also poeeible in the reverse sense, The downward or upward pivoting of the floor panels CBJI be made possible by the elastic pushing apart of two neighboring vertical support pairs.<br><br>
Through the embodiment of claim 19 a situation is achieved in which a maximum support surface is made available between the end fittings and the associated rail sections.<br>
Claim 20 characterises a further advantageous design.<br>
The design of claim 21 facilitates the placement of a floor panel obliquely from below onto a cross brace in that the abutment providing security against shifting forms a lock with the rail section which has to be corre¬spondingly dimensioned, with the lock preventing a shifting of the end fit¬ting beyond the cross brace and thus a dropping down of the relevant end of the floor panel.<br>

In all figures the same reference numerals designate corresponding com¬ponents.<br>
In accordance with Fig. 1, a facade scaffold is being built up at a building construction. Four vertical supports 11 ai-e supported via vertically ad¬justable spindle arrangements 28 on the ground 27, in an arrangement with a rectangular base surface, the longer side of which extends parallel to the front of the building construction 37, and are complemented into a<br><br>
basic frame 41 capable of carrying loads by cross braces 30 provided above head height, by longiti:idinal supports 29 and also by diagonal struts 38, with the basic fr&amp;me 41 being continued to the right in suitable manner in Fig. 1, which is not, however, shown in detail. The basic frame 41 has no cross braces in the lower region, i.e. beneath standing height, so that a passageway can be provided there, for example for pedestrians.<br>
Whereas the rear vertical supports 11 continue upwardly, the front verti¬cal supports 11 are displaced rcarwardly above the transverse beams 30 so that the spacing between the front and rear vertical supports 11 is more than halved. The vertical supports 11, which consist of individual, plugged together elements IT arranged in series, form, together with hori¬zontal cross braces 12 extending between them in a vertical spacing, end frames 32 which, as one can see in Fig, 1 at the top left, are of asymmetric design and can be plugged onto one another. In this manner numerous end frames 32 can be plugged together, optionally through the intermedi¬ary of individual elements IT not connected by cross braces 12, so that one cross brace 12 is respectively provided for each vertical support pair in the vertical spacing of the storeys A, B, C, D and F that are provided. Along the building construction 37, a total of seven end frame arrange¬ments consisting of end frames put together vertically above one another and each having a number of cross braces 12 lying at the same height are provided along the construction 37 at uniform intervals.<br>
The narrow ends of rectangular floor panels 13 provided with end fittings 15 are respectively releasably mounted onto two cross braces 12 disposed alongside one another in front of the building construction 37 in the man¬ner described in detail with reference to Figs. 2 to 11.<br><br>
The facade scaffold has, furthermore, two forwardly projecting auxiliaiy scaffolds 33 and 34 respectively.<br>
The front vertical supports 11 at the corners of the basic frame 41 can be used for the attachment of further suitable carrying elements.<br>
In order to secure persons 42 working on the floor panels 13, railings 39, 40 are secured to the vertical supports 11 at a suitable height and also at the ends.<br>
Curb strips 36 are releasably secured to the side of the floor panels 13 remote from the building construction 37 in particular and also^ if re¬quired, at the side adjacent the building construction 37 and at the ends, at the bottom, preferably at the cross braces 12, and are intended to pre¬vent tools lying on the floor panels 13 being pushed sideways beyond the floor panels 13 and falling from the facade scaffold when walking on the floor panels.<br>
In accordance with Fig, 1, the storeys A, B, C, D have already been fin¬ished while the storeys E, F are being erected.<br>
In accordance with Figs. 2 to 4, the cross braces 12 consist of two rail sections 14, 14' which are mounted spaced apart and parallel to one an¬other by welding or by a releasable type of mounting on two individual elements IT located behind one another of vertical supports 11* The rail sections 14, 14' have a substantially C-shapcd or reversed, C-shaped crose-eection and compriee a vertical strip part 14a, I4'a respectively, a lower, shorter, horizontal reinforcement flange 14b and 14'b respectively, and an upper horizontal flange 17 which has a greater width than the re¬inforcement flange 14b, 14'b. In principle the two rail sections 14, 14'<br><br>
could also be connected by an elongate plate shown in broken lines in Fig. 3 in order to form a constructional unit.<br>
The flanges 14b, H'b and 17 respectively of the two rail sections 14, 14' extend in opposite directions.<br>
In accordance with Fig, 2 the rail sections 14, 14' are welded at their ends at a spacing K to one vertical support 11 in each case. The mounting could also, for example, be made releasable via mounting roses provided at the vertical supports 11.<br>
An abutment plate 18 providing security against shifting and a positioning plate 18' which, in accordance with Fig. 4, can extend substantially hori¬zontally or rise slightly from the insertion side 21 towards the building site 22, extend in accordance with Figs. 3, 4 between the vertical flat strip parts 14a, 14'a of the two rail sections 14, 14' approximately at half height at a horizontal spacing. The plates 18, 18' arc firmly connected at both ends to the rail sections 14, 14*, for example by welding. Apart from the function of the plates 18, 18' described further below, the cross braces 12 consisting of the rail sections 14, 14' are reinforced in tliis manner.<br>
Cutouts 20 are provided behind one another in the upper, oppositely ex¬tending, horizontal flanges 17 of the rail sections 14, 14', with a cutout 20 in each case being located relatively close to the insertion side 21 and a further cutout 20 in each case lying close to the building side 22.<br>
End fittings IS, 15' are secured to the narrow ends of the floor panels 13, are of substantially hook-like design in accordance with Fig. 3, and have, at the side adjacent the floor panel 13, a vertical strip part 15a, 15'a re¬spectively, which is fixedly connected to the floor panel 13, a substantially<br><br>
horizontally extending and substantially flat roof part 15b, 15*b and an outer strip pai't 15c, 15'c in such a way that the end fittings 15, 15' es¬sentially have an inverted U-cross section.<br>
In order to be able to reliably distinguish the components shown in Fig* 1, the rail sections 14, 14' are provided with hatching extending from the top left to the bottom right and the end fittings 15, 15' arc provided with a hatching extending from the top right to the bottom left.<br>
In accordance with the invention, projections 16 providing security against lift-out and extending horizontally beneath the horizontal flange 17 in the direction towards the associated rail sections 14, 14' are provided at the lower edge of the strip parts 15a, 15'a, Downwardly projecting abutments 19 providing security against shifting are provided at the strip parts 15c, 15'c lying between the rail sections 14, 14' and cooperate with rear abut¬ment edges 23, 23' of the abutment plate 18 providing security against shifting, or with the positioning plate 18' respectively,<br>
The vertical spacing G between the projections 16 providing security against lift-out and the horizontal flange is greater in the mounted state of the floor panels 13 is greater in accordance with the invention than the vertical degr^ee of overlap between the plates 18, 18' and the abutments 19 providing security against shifting.<br>
The surface 24 of the abutment plate 18 serves as a sliding surface for an abutment 19 providing security against shifting, which has been lifted onto it.<br>
The abutment plate 18 and the abutments 19 are positioned relative to one another in the horizontal direction such that when the projection 19<br><br>
strikes against the rear edge 23 of the abutment plate 18, the projection 16 of the end fittings 15, 15' providing security against lift-out is still lo¬cated beneath the horizontal flange 17 and in any event still clearly behind the cutout 20, so that on lifting of the end fittings 15, 15' in this state, the projections 19 are admittedly lifted onto the surface 24, but the projection 16 providing security against lift-out cannot yet pass upwardly throvigh the cutout 20, This is first possible when the downwardly projecting abutments 19 have been shifted sufficiently on the surface 24 in the di¬rection towards the insertion side 21 that the end fittings 15, 15' come into abutment at the front vertical support 12 in the region of the front cutouts 25. The length in the direction of insertion of the abutment plate 18 and of the abutments 19 providing security against shifting is such that the abutments 19 providing security against shifting which have been lifted onto the surface 24 of the abutment plate 18 slidingly contact the surface 24 until the associated end fitting 15 and 15' respectively strikes the front vertical support 11 on being pulled out forwardly,<br>
In accordance with Figs. 2 to 4, two identically formed floor panels 13 are<br>
mounted behind one another on a rail section 14 and 14* respectively in each case. The rear floor panel 13 abuts the rear vertical support 11 in the region of a cutout 26 provided at the end fittings 15, 15'. At the center the two floor panels 13 likewise have a small spacing 31 or preferably abut against one another.<br>
A&amp; one cein see particularly clearly from Figs. 2 and 4, the horizontal spacing H of the projection 19 of the rear floor panel 13 providing security against shifting and the rear edge 23' of the rear positioning plate 18' is significantly larger than the smallest possible spacing 35 between the abutment 19 of the front end fitting IS providing security against shifting<br><br>
and the rear edge 23 of the abutment plate 18, which is only intended to lie in the range of necessary tolerances*<br>
In Fig. 2 bores 44 are also indicated in the end region of the rail sections 14, 14', which serve for the insertion of non-illustrated retaining bolts of the curb strips 36 (Fig. 1). In the region of the rear vertical supports ]. 1, the bores 44 are generally unnecessary because curb strips 36 are not prescribed at the side adjacent the building construction. In accordance with the invention, the non-illustrated vertical bolts of the curb strips 36, which are inserted into the front bores 44, represent an additional secur¬ing against shifting of the floor panels 18 to the front. The bores 44 ai'e thus to be correspondingly provided.<br>
At the left of Fig. 4 it is further indicated how plug-in spigots 11" provided at the individual elements 11' are inserted in telescope-like manner into an adjacent individual element 1 r in order in this way to form a vertical support 11 formed of numerous individual elements IT.<br>
Further features and details of the invention can be seen from the follow¬ing functional description with additional reference to the Figs. 5 to 11.<br>
In accordance with Figs. 2 to 4, two end fittings 15, 15 and 15', 15' re¬spectively of two floor panels 13 are respectively arranged behind one an¬other on the two rail sections 14, 14', and indeed in such a way that be¬tween the floor panels 13 there remains the smallest possible spacing 31, which has to be so small that no components or tools can drop down through it. The size of the spacing is determined by the tolerances neces¬sary in the erection of such a scaffold.<br><br>
At the building side 22 the end fittings 15, 15' located there abut in the region of the cut-out 26 against the rear vertical supports 11, whereby the depth of insertion of two floor panels 13 arranged behind one another is determined. The abutments 19 of the end fittings 15, 15' disposed towards the insertion side 21 forming a security against shifting each engage be¬hind the rear edge 23 of the plate 18 providing security against shifting, and indeed while leaving the small spacing 35, which should be as small as possible, and which is determined by the usual tolerances in such scaffolds. In this manner, both floor panels lying behind one another are also secured against slippage towards the insertion side 21.<br>
Should now, for example, wind forces acting from below on the floor pan¬els 13 attempt to lift them from the rail sections 14, 14'. then this is pre¬vented by the projections 16 providing security against lifting which en¬gage beneath the horizontal flanges 17, A corresponding situation applies if any form of tilting moments should occur about the longitudinal axis of the floor panels 13, for example by treading onto the front or rear edge re¬gion of the floor panels 13 projecting beyond the support region on the rail sections 14, 14'.<br>
If the floor panels 13 are to be lifted from the rail sections 14, 14', then the curb strips 36 are first taken out of the holding bores 44 for the safety curb. Thereafter, in accordance with Figs. 5 and 7, one of the front floor panels 13 is lifted sufficiently that the downwardly projecting abutment 19 providing security against shifting is lifted to the level of the svirfacc of the abutment plate 18 providing security against shifting and the floor parxel 13 can be shifted in the direction of the arrow P towards the insertion side 21, with the abutment 19 being able to slide on the surface 24. Through the lifting of the abutment 19 providing security against shifting to the<br><br>
level of the surface 24 the sliding lock formed by the abutment plate 18 providing security against shifting and the abutment 19 providing security against lifting is cancelled.<br>
The relevant floor panel 13 is then shifted in the direction of the arrow P to such an extent that the edge of the front cut-out 25 abuts against the rear side of the front vertical support 11 in which position the projection 16 providing security against lifting is vertically aligned with the cut-out 20 in the horizontal flange 17, whereupon the end fittings 15 and 15' respec¬tively can be lifted upwardly without problem from the associated rail sec¬tion 14, In order to release the front floor panel 13, a quite consciou&amp; movement of the floor panel 13 first vertically upwardly and then for-wardly is thus necessaiy and could not be produced by chance, for exam¬ple by wind forces, so that, as a result of the measures of the invention, an extensive securing of the front floor panels 13 against chance lifting is present and, on the other hand, however, a conscious removal is also pos¬sible without problem.<br>
After one of the two front floor panels 13 has been removed in accordance with Figs. 8 to 10, the rear floor panel 13, which is no longer restricted by another floor panel 13, can likewise he shifted forwardly in the direction towards the Insertion side 21 until the abutment 19 providing security against shifting and provided at its end fittings 15, 15' strikes against the rear edge 23' of the rear positioning plate 18' (Fig. 10). Now, in contrast to the conditions for the front floor panels 13 - the projections 16 providing security againat lifting and the cut-outs 20 in the horizontal flanges 17 are vertically aligned with one another, so that, in accordance with Fig. 9, the end fitting 15 can be lifted from the associated rail section 14. For the rear floor panels 13 the abutments 19 providing security against shifting atid<br><br>
the positioning plate 18' only serves an indicator through which an indi¬cation is given to the operator when the two components 18', 19 strike against one another that the floor panel 13 is now ready for lifting from the rail section 14.<br>
After the abutment 19 providing security against shifting has been lifted above the level of the surface 24' of the positioning plate 18', the rear floor panel 13 can now be pulled out forwardly in the direction of the arrow R and the abutment 19 providing security against shifting can optionally slide on the surface 24'.<br>
The mounting of the floor panels onto the rail sections 14, 14' takes place in the reverse sequence as follows:<br>
First of all, the rear floor panel 13 is mounted from the insertion side 21 in such a manner that the abutment 19 providing security against shifting is placed onto the rear positioning plate 18' and the floor panel 15 with the end fittings 15, 15' is pushed towards the building side 22, with the abutment 19 providing security against shifting sliding rearwardly on the surface 24' of the positioning plate 18' until it finally passes behind the end edge 23', whereupon the end fitting 15 falls downwardly until it con¬tacts the horizontal flange 17 over its full length. During this, the projec¬tions 16 providing security against lifting moves through the cut-out 20 beneath the level of the horizontal flange 17, whereupon the floor panel 13 with the end fitting 15 is shifted rearwardly into the position which can be seen from Figs. 5 to 7 until the end fitting 15 comes into contact against the rear vertical support in the region of the cut-out 26. The rear floor panel 13 is now in its desired position*<br><br>
In order to facilitate the sliding of the abutment 19 providing security against shifting onto the positioning plate 18', the latter can either itself be formed as a ramp which rises towards the rear, or it can have such a ramp 18" at its end adjacent the insertion side 21. In this manner, the abutment 19 providing security against shifting comes into sliding en¬gagement with the surface of the ramp 18" solely by pushing the floor panel 13 rearwardly without the floor panel 13 having to be lifted for in¬sertion, so that the end fitting 15 on further shifting of the floor panel 13 towards the side 22 of the building is lifted until finally the abutment 19 providing security against shifting enters behind the end edge 23' of the positioning plate 18* and tlie end fitting 15 drops downwardly in the above described manner, whereupon the roof parts 15b, 15'b lie on the flange 17 as can, for example, be seen in Fig. 3. Thereafter, the shifting of the end fittings 15, 15' into the desired position evident from Figs. 2 to 7 takes place.<br>
The front floor panel 13 is now mounted as follows:<br>
The front floor panel 13 is first placed onto the associated rail section 14, so that the end fitting 15 abuts in the region of the front cut-outs 25 against the front vertical supports 11 from the rear. In this position, the projections 16 providing security against lifting and the cut-outs 20 in the horizontal flanges 17 are aligned vertically with one another, so that the end fitting 15 can be moved so far downwardly that the abutments 19 providing security against shifting come into contact with the surface 24 of the abutment plate 18 providing security against shifting. As a result of the dimensioning in accordance with the invention the projections 16 pro¬viding security against lifting now come to lie lower than the horizontal flanges 17 so that, on shifting the floor panel 13 in the direction of the ar-<br><br>
row S in Fig. 7, the projections 16 providing security against lifting already engage beneath the horizontal flanges 17 before the abutment 19 provid¬ing security against shifting and sliding on the surface 24 finally enters behind the rear edge 23 of the abutment plate 18 providing security against shifting, whereupon the floor panel 13 together with the end fit¬tings 15, 15' drops downwardly into its desired position shown in Figa. 2 to 4 where the roof parts 15b, 15'b of the end fittings 15 come to lie on the horizontal flanges 17.<br>
The abutments 19 providing security against shifting are to be arranged in the region of the center of the end fittings IS, IS*, so that, when the pro¬jections 19 providing security against shifting contact the abutment plates IS, 18' providing security against shifting, the floor panel 13 adopts an unstable position in which it can be sea-sawed abut its longitudinal axis during handling, which is a sign for the operator that the floor panel 13 is not yet located in its end position, A stable, no longer sea-sawing position is first achieved when the abutments 19 providing security against shifting have slid off rearwardly from the plates 18 providing security against<br>
shifting.<br>
In accordance with Fig. 11 the rail sections 14, 14' and also the end fit¬tings 15, 15' together with their various projections and cut-outs are di¬mensioned such that a downward pivoting of each floor panel is possible out of the position secured against lifting, and indeed in such a way that, for example on pivoting of the floor panel 13 downwardly abut the rail section 14', a lifting in the direction of the arrow T in Fig. 11 is possible without prior horizontal shifting of the floor panel 13. In the reverse se¬quence, each floor panel 13 csixi thus also be placed onto the rear sections 14, 14' in the inclined position and then, however, a lifting in the above<br><br>
described sense must first take place at the opposite side. As soon as the end of the floor panel 13 has been lifted there from its associated rail sec¬tion 14, 14', the end frames 32 {Fig. 1) located there can be resiliently pushed together with the vertical supports 11 and the cross braces 12 away from the floor panel 13 somewhat, whereupon a tilting of the floor panel 13 downwardly in accordance with Fig* 11 is possible. On the placement of a floor panel in the tilted state in accordance with Fig. 11 the other end must subsequently be lifted with resiliently pressed apart end frames 32, beyond the level of the rail section there and subsequently placed in the above described sense onto the rail section.<br>
It is thus particularly advantageous that, on the tilting of a floor panel 13 in accordance with Fig. 11, none of the parts movable relative to one an¬other come into engagement with one another so that they could be dam¬aged or destroyed.<br>
As a result of the design in accordance with the invention any desired front floor panel 13 can be dismaritled and installed independently of the remaining floor panels 13. For the removal of one of the rear floor panels 13 it is only necessary to first shift the floor panel 13 lying in front of it forwardly, and indeed until the frontmost floor panel strikes against the front vertical support 11.<br>
The insertion of the floor panel 13 in accordance with the invention is in particular facilitated and made more secure by the design of the invention, because the operator has to get a feel both for the non-latched position and also for the latched position of each floor panel 13,<br>
Since the retaining bores 44 for the safety curb are located, in accordance with the invention, relatively close to the front and rear edges of the floor<br><br>
panels 13, i.e. of the end fittings 15, 15', a further indication for a prob¬lem-free positioning of the floor panels 13 which have been set in place can be seen from the fact that the retaining bores 44 for the safety curb are exposed to receive the holding pins of the curb strips 36. By inserting the vertical pins of the curb strips into the bores 44, the floor panels 13 are in particular additionally secured against a shift towards the front.<br>
The abutments 19 providing security against shifting have the further ad¬vantage that when the lower side of a floor panel 13 is placed obliquely (Fig. 11) onto a rail section 14, 14', and is then shifted in its longitudinal direction until vertical alignment of the upper end fitting 15, 15' with the associated rail section 14, 14', at least the downwardly projecting abut¬ment 19 providing security against shifting engages behind the associated rail section 14, 14' and the longitudinal shifting is thus terminated at the<br>
instant at which the end fitting 15, 15' with the associated rail section 14, 14' adopts the relative position necessary for a holding engagement.<br><br>
