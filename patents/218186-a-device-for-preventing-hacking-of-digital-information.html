				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to a Device for preventing hacking of digital information using Chaos based Real Permutation Matrix<br>
PRIOR ART:<br>
Cryptanalysis or hacking is the science of recovering the plaintext of a message from the ciphertext without access to the key. In cryptanalysis, it is always assumed that the cryptanalyst has full access to the algorithm.<br>
If an algorithm is presumed to be perfect, then the only method of breaking it relies on trying every possible key combination until the resulting ciphertext makes sense, this type of attack is called a brute-force attack. The field of parallel computing is perfectly suited to the task of brute force attacks, as every processor can be given a number of possible keys to try, and they do not need to interact with each other at all except to announce the result. A technique that is becoming increasingly popular is parallel processing using thousands of individual computers connected to the Internet. This is known as distributed computing. Many cryptographers believe that brute force attacks are basically ineffective when long keys are used. An encryption algorithm with a large key (over 100 bits) can take millions of years to crack, even with powerful, networked computers of today. Besides, adding a single extra key doubles the cost of performing a brute force cryptanalysis.<br>
Cryptography is the science of devising methods that allow information to be sent in a secure form in such a way that the only person able to<br>
retrieve this information is the intended recipient. Encryption is based on algorithms that scramble information into unreadable or non-discernable form. Decryption is the process of restoring the scrambled information to its original form. A key is a value that causes a cryptographic algorithm to run in a specific manner and produce a specific ciphertext as an output. The key size is usually measured in bits. The bigger the key size, the more secure will be the algorithm.<br>
Single Key Cryptodevices:<br>
Suppose we have to encrypt and send the following stream of binary<br>
data (which might be originating from voice, video, text or any other<br>
source)<br>
0110001010011111 ....<br>
We can use a 4-bit long key, x - 1011, to encrypt this bit stream.   To<br>
perform encryption, the plaintext (binary bit stream) is first subdivided<br>
into blocks of 4 bits.<br>
0110     0010     1001      111 1....<br>
Each sub-block is XORed (binary addition) with the key, x = 1011.  The<br>
encrypted message will be<br>
1101      1001     0010     01 00....<br>
The recipient must also possess the knowledge of the key in order to<br>
decrypt the message.   The decryption process is fairly simple in this<br>
case.  The ciphertext (the received binary bit stream) is first subdivided<br>
in to blocks of 4 bits.  Each sub-block is XORed with the key, x = 1011.<br>
The decrypted message will be the original plaintext<br>
0110     0010     1001     111 1....<br>
Just one key is used both for encryption and decryption.  Because there<br>
is just one key which is used for encryption and decryption, this kind of<br>
technique is called symmetric cryptography or single key cryptograpny or secret key cryptography. The problem with this technique is that the key has to be kept confidential. Also, the key must be changed from time to time to ensure secrecy of transmission. This means that the secret key (or the set of keys) has to be communicated to the recipient. This might be done physically.<br>
Public key cryptodevices:<br>
In order to overcome the problems of communicating the key, the concept of public key cryptography was developed by Difie and Hellman. This technique is also called the asymmetric encryption. There are two keys, one is held privately and the other one is made public. What one key can lock, the other key can unlock. Suppose we want to send an encrypted message to recipient A using the public key encryption technique. To do so we will use the public key of the recipient A and use it to encrypt the message. After the recipient receives the message, recipient A decrypts it with his private key. Only the private key of recipient A can decrypt a message that has been encrypted with his public key. Similarly, recipient B can only decrypt a message that has been encrypted with his public key. Thus, no private key ever needs to be communicated and hence one does not have to trust any communication channel to convey the keys. Suppose we want to send somebody a message and also provide a proof that the message is actually from us (a lot of harm can be done by providing bogus information, or rather, misinformation!). In order to keep a message private and also provide the authentication (that it is indeed from us), we can perform a special encryption on the plain text with our private key,<br>
then encrypt it again with the public key of the recipient. The recipient uses his private key to open the message and then use our public key to verify the authenticity. This technique is said to use digital signatures. One-way function: it is basically a non-reversible quick encryption method. The encryption is easy and fast, but the decryption is not. Suppose we send a document to recipient A and want to check at a later time whether the document has been tampered with. We can do so by running a one-way function, which produces a fixed length value called a hash (also called the message digest). The hash is the unique signature of the document that can be sent along with the document. Recipient A can run the same one-way function to check whether the document has been altered.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION:<br>
1.	One of the objects of the present invention is to        propose a<br>
device and method of encryption of digital information such that a<br>
hacker not only has to identify the original location of the coded<br>

onthis coded information.<br>

encryption of digital informationsuch that the proposed encryption<br>
and decryption technique is easily realizable in real time.<br>

The present invention proposes an RN generation device to excue me chaos functions with different and randomly chosen initial conditions over time. In addition, we randomly choose different chaos functions and perform random number of iterations on the selected initial conditions.<br>
Chaos based random numbers:<br>
The present invention is based on chaotic equations. By chaos we mean an irregular, seemingly random change in time. The function is excited with an initial value or initial condition. The output of the function is fed back as an input to the same function, successively, to generate a stream of "random" numbers. One example of a chaos function is the logistic map given by<br>
For a chaos function we note that:<br>
•	Given    two    inputs    that    are    reasonably    close    together,<br>
corresponding outputs have a disproportionately large variation<br>
(exponential sensitivity to initial conditions)<br>
•	The sequence of numbers generated by the chaos function are<br>
highly unpredictable without the knowledge of the exact initial<br>
condition.<br>
We consider a set ot cnaos runctions i.e. me cnaos runcuon pooi. of initial values is associated with each chaos function. Only a few initial values are suitable for generating random numbers. Note: Not all initial values to chaos functions result in generation of random values. The number of iterations with respect to any chaos functions is fixed else there will be cycles.<br>
Permutation Matrix:<br>
A permutation matrix is any matrix which can be created by rearranging<br>
the rows and/or columns of an identity matrix.<br>
Pre-multiplying a matrix A by a permutation matrix P results in a<br>
rearrangement of the rows of A. Post-multiplying by P results in a<br>
rerrangement of the columns of A.<br>
Let A be an n x n matrix. If the matrix P is obtained by swapping rows /<br>
and ;' of the n x n identity matrix ln, then rows / and j of A will be swapped<br>
in the product PA, and columns / and j of A will be swapped in the<br>
product AP.<br>
A permutation matrix can alternately be viewed as a matrix p,y obtained<br>
by permuting the rth and yth rows of the identity matrix with / 
row and column therefore contains precisely a single 1, and every<br>
permutation corresponds to a unique permutation matrix. There are<br>
(2) therefore    2 permutation matrices of size n, where A? is a binomial<br>
coefficient.<br>
A permutation matrix is nonsingular,  so the determinant is always<br>
nonzero. In addition, a permutation matrix satisfies<br>
where I is the identity matrix. Applying to another matrix, p,y A gives A<br>
with the /th and yth rows interchanged, and Apg gives A with the /th and<br>
/th columns interchanged.<br>
Interpreting the 1s in an n x n permutation matrix as rooks gives an<br>
allowable configuration of non-attacking rooks on an n x n chessboard.<br>
However, the permutation matrices provide only a subset of possible<br>
solutions.<br>
The proposed method encrypts the data using a combination of two techniques:<br>
•	Scaling<br>
•	Permuting<br>
Both of these tasks are carried out by the Real-Permutation Matrix (RPM). The RPM is constructed using the standard permutation matrix except that the 1's are replaced by values generated using the chaos number generator. The hacker not only has to guess the original location of the original symbols but also the actual values. The Real-Permutation Matrix based on chaos functions, which performs permutation and scaling, has not been found in literature.<br>
Fast encoding and decoding by matrix multiplication:<br>
The proposed encryption and decryption technique is easily realizable in real-time. The fast encoding and decoding methodologies are given below:<br>
Encoding:<br>
uME = Mu * MRPM<br>
FMu : Uncoded Matrix<br>
FME : Encoded Matrix<br>
FMRPM : Real Permutation Matrix<br>
Decoding:<br>
uMD = ME * (MRPM)T FMo : Decoded Matrix<br>
The strength of the algorithm depends on two factors, which are described below:<br>
Strength of the technique due to the permutation operation:<br>
Determining the RPM is an NP hard problem, that is, the mathematical complexity that grows faster than polynomial time as we increase the size of the permutation matrix. This gives us a very simple way to increase the mathematical complexity of breaking into the device. For an N * A/ RPM, the hacker would need N\ (factorial A/) attempts.<br>
Strength of the technique due to the scaling operation:<br>
The non-zero elements of the RPM come from the chaotic random-number generator. This chaotic random-number generator consists of a bank of chaos functions and a set of good seed values. The level of security offered by scaling depends on the precision of the floating point<br>
arithmetic used. I hus tne level or securny can oe increased oy increasing the precision of arithmetic. Let the floating point arithmetic used use a precision of m decimal places after the decimal point. Thus an element of the permutation matrix can be represented as o.x}x2x3...xm<br>
where *, e {o,i,2,...,9}for / = 1 ,2, . . . ., m. For a brute-force attack, the hacker would need iom-i distinct attempts.<br>
Both of these strength factors work simultaneously. A hacker must guess/estimate the RPM exactly in order to break into the cryptodevice.<br>
Application/ Usage:<br>
The proposed device is ideal for any secure Cryptographic Communication device. The device is not only mathematically robust and secure but also simple.<br>
