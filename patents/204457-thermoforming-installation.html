Thermoforming installation Prior art<br>
The invention proceeds from a thermoforming installation of the generic type of Claim 1. In a known thermoforming installation of this type, a packaging-material web which contains depressions is conveyed cyclically, by means of an advancement roller, from a perforation device to a punching device, the latter punching individual blister strips out of the packaging-material web. The perforating device is horizontal, and the punching device is vertical and arranged beneath the perforating device. Since the device drive units, which are each located beneath the two devices, require a certain amount of space, there is a need for a relatively large distance to the advancement roller, which is arranged between the two devices. The result of the relatively large distance between the two devices is that, in order to compensate for the shrinkage length of the packaging-material web as it travels from the perforating device to the punching device, there is a need for a large adjustment range for at least one of the two devices, to enable the tolerances between the perforation and the stamping contour to be maintained. The large adjustment range is necessary, in particular, after a break in production, when, on account of complete cooling, the packaging-material web has a large shrinkage length. In the known thermoforming installation, the necessary adjustment range is ensured by a perforating device whose position can be changed.<br>
Advantages of the invention<br>
In contrast, the thermoforming installation according to the invention with the characterizing features of Claim 1 has the advantage that the arrangement of the perforating/stamping device with respect to the punching device shortens the distances over which the packaging-material web travels between the perforating/stamping device and the punching device. This means that, for the purpose of compensating for the shrinkage<br><br>
length of the packaging-material web, only a small adjustment range is necessary in order to ensure the tolerances between the perforation/stamping and the punching contour. This small adjustment range can be easily achieved by the advancement roller being designed such that its position can be changed, with the result that the construction of the thermoforming installation according to the invention is thus simplified and is particularly compact, and that both the perforating/ tamping device and the punching device are arranged in a fixed manner.<br>
Further advantages and advantageous developments of the thermoforming installation according to the invention can be gathered from the subclaims and the description.<br>
Drawing<br>
An exemplary embodiment of the invention is illustrated in the drawing and is explained in more detail in the following description. The single figure, Figure 1, shows a simplified side view of part of the thermoforming installation.<br>
Description of the exemplary embodiment<br>
In Figure 1, 10 designates a blister web which comprises a bottom web, which contains depressions 1, and a cover-foil web which has been sealed on said bottom web. An upstream filling device (not illustrated) introduces pharmaceutical products, such as tablets, coated tablets or the like, into the depressions 1. The blister web 10 designed in this way passes into the region of a fixed perforating/stamping device 11, which comprises a top part 12 and a bottom part 13 of which can be displaced towards said top part. Perforating/stamping cutters 14 are arranged in the top part 12, and a perforating/stamping die 16, which interacts with the perforating/stamping cutters 14, is arranged in the bottom part 13. The drive unit 15 of the perforating/stamping device 11 is arranged beneath the bottom part 13, which is<br><br>
directed towards the depressions 1. A cyclically driven advancement roller 17 adjoins the perforating/stamping device 11. Recesses 19 are formed in the lateral surface 18 of the advancement roller 17, one beside the other and one behind the other as seen in the advancement direction of the blister web 10, and interact with the depressions 1 for the purpose of advancing the blister web 10. X designates the distance between the centre of the perforating/stamping device 11 and the centre of those first recesses 19 in the advancement roller 17 which are first to engage with the corresponding depressions 1 for the purpose of advancing the blister web 10.<br>
The essential factor is that the perforating/stamping device 11 is not horizontal, but rather is inclined by an angle of, which is approximately eight degrees, with respect to the horizontal, with the result that the drive unit 15 is oriented away from the advancement roller 17.<br>
The advancement roller 17, which deflects the blister web 10 vertically downwards, by about 90 degrees, from the horizontal, is adjoined by a punching device 23 which is arranged vertically in a fixed manner, comprises, in turn, a top part 21 and a bottom part 22 which can be displaced towards said top part, and is intended for separating individual blister strips out of the blister web 10. A second drive unit 25, which is assigned to the bottom part 22 and belongs to the punching device 23, is oriented in the direction of the drive unit 15 of the perforating/stamping device 11, although it does not come into contact with the drive unit 15. Y designates the distance between the centre of the punching device 23 and the last recesses 19 of the advancement roller 17 which engage with the depressions 1.<br>
In order to adapt the distances X and Y for the purpose of compensating for any shrinkage lengths of the blister web 10, for example after a break in production of the thermoforming installation, in order to maintain the tolerances between the perforation and the punching contour of the blister strips, the advancement roller 17<br><br>
is arranged in an adjustable manner. The advancement roller 17 is adjusted along an axis 2 6 which is inclined by about 45 degrees with respect to the horizontal. If, then, the advancement roller 17 is adjusted away from the two drive units 15, 25, the two distances X, Y are correspondingly increased simultaneously.<br>
It should also be mentioned that the distance X between the advancement roller 17 and the perforating/stamping device 11 and the distance Y between the advancement roller 17 and the punching device 23 should be selected from the outset to be as small as possible, that is to say that the two drive units 15, 25 are not quite in contact, and that transportation of the blister web 10 by the advancement roller 17 is always ensured.<br>
It should additionally be mentioned that it is also possible to adjust the distances X, Y by exchanging the advancement roller 17 for an advancement roller with a different external diameter•<br>
As a modification of the exemplary embodiment, it is also conceivable for the punching device 23 to be inclined correspondingly instead of the perforating/stamping device 11, or for both the perforating/stamping device 11 and the punching device 23 to be inclined correspondingly, in order to provide additional space for the two drive units 15, 25, with the result that it is possible to minimize the distances X, Y without the two drive units 15, 25 coming into contact.<br>
It is, furthermore, conceivable to replace the two drive units 15, 25 by a common gearbox, in which the drives both of the perforating/stamping device 11 and of the punching device 23 are arranged. Even in the case of the common gearbox, it is possible, by inclining one of the two devices, to provide additional space for the drives, with the result that the distances X and Y can be minimized.<br><br><br><br>
