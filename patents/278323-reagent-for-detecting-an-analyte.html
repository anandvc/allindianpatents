				<td>REAGENT FOR DETECTING AN ANALYTE<br>
The present invention relates to a reagent for use in<br>
detecting an analyte, to a dye compound suitable for use in<br>
such a reagent, to a method of detecting or measuring an<br>
analyte using such a reagent and to a complex of an analyte<br>
and such a reagent.<br>
The method of detecting or measuring an analyte relies on<br>
FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer).<br>
FRET is a distance-dependent interaction between the<br>
electronic excited states of two dye species in which<br>
excitation energy is transferred from a donor to an acceptor<br>
without emission of a photon.<br>
The efficiency of FRET is inversely dependent on the<br>
sixth power of 'the intermolecular separation. [Refs. 1. B.<br>
Wieb Van der Meer, G. Coker III, S.-Y. Simon Chen, Resonance<br>
energy transfer; Theory and data, VCH publishers, 1994; 2.<br>
Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy, Joseph R. Lakowicz<br>
(Ed.), 2. edition, Plenum Press, New York 1999]. Detection of<br>
FRET can therefore be used to determine the distance between<br>
a species labelled with the donor and a species labelled with<br>
the acceptor. This may be used for example to determine<br>
whether the two species are bound to one another.<br>
The requirements for FRET are:<br>
- Donor and acceptor must be in close proximity<br>
(typically 10-100 A).<br>
- The absorption spectrum of the acceptor must overlap<br>
the fluorescence emission spectrum of the donor.<br>
- Donor and acceptor transition dipole orientations must<br>
be approximately parallel.<br>
FRET causes a decrease in intensity and lifetime of donor<br>
fluorescence. If the acceptor is fluorescent, FRET may also<br>
cause an increase in intensity of acceptor fluorescence.<br>
Where the donor and acceptor are the same, FRET causes<br>
fluorescence depolarization.<br>
FRET may be detected by illuminating a sample with light<br>
in the absorption spectrum of the donor and measuring any of<br>
these properties.<br>
A simple FRET assay may be carried out by labelling an<br>
analyte with a donor and labelling an analyte binding agent<br>
with an acceptor (or vice versa) . When the analyte is not<br>
bound to the analyte binding agent, the distance between the<br>
donor and acceptor is large and no FRET occurs.<br>
When the analyte is bound to the analyte binding agent,<br>
the distance between the donor and acceptor is small.and FRET<br>
occurs.<br>
Therefore, detection of FRET may be used to determine<br>
whether analyte is present and/or analyte concentration.<br>
A competitive FRET assay may be carried out where<br>
labelled analyte competes with non-labelled analyte. In this<br>
case, as the concentration of non-labelled analyte increases,<br>
there will be less bound labelled analyte. This means that<br>
less FRET will occur.<br>
Therefore, again detection of FRET may be used to<br>
determine analyte concentration.<br>
An assay of this type may be used for the measurement of<br>
glucose concentration. Glucose binds reversibly 'to a class<br>
of proteins called lectins. Concanavalin A is an example of<br>
a lectin. The components of the assay are for example<br>
labelled concanavalin A (the analyte binding reagent) and<br>
labeled glucose or labelled glucose analogue. Dextran is a<br>
suitable glucose analogue. When glucose (the analyte) binds<br>
to concanavalin A, it displaces labelled glucose or dextran,<br>
and less FRET will occur.<br>
Alternatively, the donor and acceptor may be attached to<br>
the same species to form a single FRET reagent. An example<br>
of such a reagent is a "molecular beacon".<br>
A molecular beacon consists of a single stranded<br>
polynucleotide or polynucleotide analogue sequence with a<br>
donor attached to one end of the sequence. A complementary<br>
acceptor is attached to the other end of the sequence.<br>
The unbound molecular beacon exists as a stem-and-loop<br>
structure. The sequences at the ends of the molecular beacon<br>
match and bind, creating the stem, while the rest of the<br>
probe is unmatched and unbound, creating the loop. While<br>
folded this way, .the donor at one end of the probe is next to<br>
the acceptor at the other end. The proximity of the donor and<br>
acceptor allows FRET to occur.<br>
When the probe recognizes and binds to a target, the<br>
molecular beacon structure unfolds. This separates the<br>
acceptor from the donor so that FRET cannot take place.<br>
Therefore, FRET may be used to determine whether a<br>
particular target is present.<br>
Molecular beacons may be used to detect complementary<br>
single stranded polynucleotide sequences. Alternatively,<br>
they may be used to detect other non-nucleotide species.<br>
Such molecular beacons are called aptamers. For example,<br>
aptamers may be used to detect proteins.<br>
The molecular beacon has the potential disadvantage that<br>
it relies on FRET occurring while the beacon is unbound.<br>
During an in vivo assay the beacon sequence may be cleaved by<br>
enzymes in the body. This will reduce the FRET. The<br>
reduction in FRET caused by beacon degradation cannot be<br>
distinguished from the reduction in FRET caused by beacon<br>
binding to the target, and the results obtained may therefore<br>
be unreliable.<br>
An alternative to a molecular beacon which deals with<br>
this problem is a dual probe. This comprises two single<br>
stranded polynucleotide or polynucleotide analogue sequences,<br>
one labelled with an energy donor and one with a<br>
complementary energy acceptor. The dual probe is used to<br>
detect a single stranded polynucleotide target sequence which<br>
is complementary to the sequences of both parts of the dual<br>
probe. When the parts of the dual probe are both bound to<br>
the target, FRET occurs. Since FRET does not occur when the<br>
dual probe is unbound, dual probe degradation will not affect<br>
the occurrence of FRET. Therefore, degradation- will not<br>
cause the results to be unreliable.<br>
Reagents similar to molecular beacons can be formed from<br>
polypeptides.FRET can also be used in immunoassays.<br>
The choice of donor and acceptor used in FRET is<br>
important, and the following factors need to be taken into<br>
account.<br>
The donor should have a high quantum yield.<br>
A suitable acceptor must have an absorption spectrum<br>
overlapping the emission spectrum of the donor. For example,<br>
QSY 21™ is a suitable donor for use with Alexa Fluor 21™. It<br>
is desirable for an acceptor to have a wide absorption<br>
spectrum so that it can be used with a variety x&gt;f donors.<br>
If the acceptor is also a fluorescent species it is<br>
possible that background fluorescence resulting from direct<br>
acceptor excitation will occur and be detected as well as<br>
donor fluorescence. Filtering of the acceptor emission may<br>
result in loss of the donor fluorescence signal where<br>
filtering is not sharp enough. Non-fluorescent acceptors<br>
such as dabcyl and QSY  can be used to avoid this problem.<br>
Alternatively, the problem can be avoided by choosing an<br>
acceptor whose emission spectrum is remote from that of the<br>
donor.<br>
The emission spectrum of some donors and absorption<br>
spectrum of some acceptors (for example QSY 21) are shifted<br>
when the dor.or or acceptor is conjugated to an analyte or<br>
analyte binding agent. This is undesirable.<br>
Where FRET assays are to be used in vivo, it is desirable<br>
for donors to fluoresce at 550 to around 600 nm and for<br>
acceptors to absorb light at around 650 nm. This avoids<br>
overlap between the donor fluorescence and in vivo<br>
autof luorescence at lower wavelengths. '"" Fluorescein<br>
fluoresces at 495 nm and is therefore not ideal for in vivo<br>
use.<br>
Alexa Fluor 594 is a dye with a suitable emission<br>
spectrum for use in vivo. This dye absorbs at 594 nm and<br>
fluoresces at 620 nm.<br>
The present inventors have now provided a new class of<br>
acceptors (HMCV dyes) for use in FRET. The acceptors are<br>
stabilized carbenium ions which are structurally related to<br>
crystal violet and malachite green. The acceptors can be<br>
derived from intermediates in the synthesis of<br>
trioxatriangulenium systems described in Bo W. Laursen et<br>
al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1998, 120, 12255-12263.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides in a first<br>
aspect a reagent for use in detecting an analyte, comprising<br>
a fluorescent energy donor and an energy acceptor, the energy<br>
donor and the energy acceptor being such that when they are<br>
sufficiently close to one another energy is non-radiatively<br>
transferred from the energy donor following excitation<br>
thereof to the energy acceptor quenching fluorescence of the<br>
energy donor, wherein the energy acceptor is of the general<br>
formula:<br>
wherein:<br>
R1, R2 and R3 are each independently H, electron donating<br>
substituents, or electron withdrawing substituents or R3<br>
is attached to a linker structure, provided that at<br>
least two of R1, R2 and R3 are electron donating groups;<br>

and/or R9 and Ris is a bridging group consisting of aryl,<br>
alkylene, O-alkylene, S-alkylene or N-alkylene<br>
optionally substituted with one or more of S03", P03<br>
OH, 0-alkyl, SH, S-alkyl, COOH, COO', ester, amide,<br>

SO3-alkyl, CN, secondary amine or tertiary<br>
araine, provided that not all of R10, R11, R12, R13, R14 and<br>
R1S are hydrogen;<br>
and wherein the distance between the energy donor and<br>
the energy acceptor of the reagent is capable of<br>
modulation by a suitable analyte to be detected.<br>
As used herein, the term "electron donating substituent"<br>
includes but is not limited to amino, primary amine,<br>
secondary amine, alkyl, 0-alkyl, S-alkyl, amide (NHCOR),<br>
ester (OCOR), OH, SH and electron rich aryl.<br>
As used herein, the term "electron withdrawing<br>
substituent" includes but is not limited to NO, N02, CN,<br>

S02-alkyl, S02NH2, S02NH-alkyl, S02N-dialkyl, SO3-<br>
alkyl, and electron deficient aryl.<br>
Electron rich/deficient aryls may be defined as aryls<br>
having electron-donating or -withdrawing substituents<br>
respectively.<br>
As used herein, the term "alkyl" and "alkylene" include<br>
linear, branched and cyclic groups, saturated and unsaturated<br>
groups (including groups containing triple bonds), groups<br>
containing one or more substituents, and groups containing<br>
one or more heteroatoms. Ci to Cg alky groups are<br>
preferred.<br>
As used herein, the term "0-alkylene", "N-alkylene" and<br>
"S-alkylene" each include groups wherein the heteroatom is at<br>
any position within the group. Ci to C7 O-alkylene, Nalkylene<br>
and S-alkylene and C2 to C7 alkylene are preferred.<br>
Where an ester substituent is referred to, the<br>

R(C=0)OR) or via the alkoxy portion, (as RO(C=0)R).<br>
Similarly, where an amide substituent is referred to, the<br>
substituent may be linked via the carbonyl portion (as<br>

In one preferred embodiment, the energy donor and energy<br>
acceptor are linked together by non-covalent binding. The<br>
non-covalent binding may exist between an analybe binding<br>
agent linked to one of the energy donor and the energy<br>
acceptor and an analyte analogue linked to the other of the<br>
energy donor and the energy acceptor, the non-covalent<br>
binding being disruptable by a suitable analyte so as to<br>
increase the distance between the energy donor and the energy<br>

is a lectin and/or the analyte analogue is a glucose<br>
analogue. For example, the analyte analogue may be dextran.<br>
This system can be used for glucose detection and/or<br>
measurement as discussed above.<br>
It is preferable for the lectin to be bound to the<br>
energy donor and the analyte analogue to be bound to the<br>
energy acceptor (e.g. Dextran-HMCV and Concanavalin A-Alexa<br>
Fluor 594) . Dextran can be more heavily labelled than<br>
Concanavalin A. If dextran is labelled with a fluorophore<br>
there will be excess fluorescence which dilutes the signal in<br>
a lifetime based assay.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the energy donor and<br>
energy acceptor are linked together by a covalent linkage.<br>
The covalent linkage between the energy donor and energy<br>
acceptor may be cleavable to increase the distance between<br>
the energy donor and the energy acceptor of the reagent.<br>
Suitably, the energy donor and energy acceptor are linked via<br>
a polynucleotide sequence or a polynucleotide analogue<br>
sequence or a polypeptide sequence, the sequence having a<br>
conformation which is capable of modulation by a suitable<br>

the energy donor and the energy acceptor of the reagent. In<br>
this case, the reagent is a "molecular beacon" as discussed<br>
above.<br>
In a further alternative embodimejit, the energy donor<br>
and the energy acceptor are not linked in the absence of<br>
analyte. This reagent may be the "dual probe" discussed<br>
above.<br>
Preferably, a linker structure is attached to the energy<br>
acceptor at R3, or where a bridging group is present<br>

and/or R9 and R15 is a bridging group consisting of alkylene ,<br>
O-alkylene, S-alkylene or N-alkylene optionally substituted<br>
with one or more of S03~, PO3<br>
2~, OH, O-alkyl, SH,' S-alkyl,<br>
COOH, COO', ester, amide, halogen, SO-alkyl, S02-alkyl,<br>
SO2NH2, SO2NH-alkyl, S02N-dialkyl, CN, secondary amine or<br>
tertiary amine.<br>

by reaction of a linker element selected from an active<br>
ester, an isothiocyanate, an acid chloride, an aldehyde, an<br>
azide, an a-halogenated ketone and an amine with a reaction<br>
partner. Suitably, the reaction partner is selected from a<br>
polysaccharide, polynucleotide or a protein. Suitably, the<br>
linker element is an active ester, and is selected from<br>
succinimidyl and pentafluorophenyl active esters.<br>
Suitably, the energy donor is Alexa Fluor 594W.<br>
The reagent may be used for in vivo detection of an<br>
analyte. For example, the reagent may be contained within a<br>
sensor which is implanted into the body. Suitably, the<br>
sensor is implanted within the epidermis so that it will be<br>
shed from the body over time. Suitable sensor constructions<br>
are described in detail in W002/30275. In this case, it<br>
should be possible to illuminate the reagent and measure<br>
reagent fluorescence through the layers of the skin above the<br>
implanted sensor.<br>
Alternatively, the reagent may be contained within a<br>
sensor which is partially implanted within the body but<br>
extends outside the body. Such a sensor may take the form of<br>
a needle. In this case, the reagent may be illuminated down<br>
the bore of the needle and reagent fluorescence may be<br>
detected in the same way without light passing through layers<br>
of the skin.<br>
The sensor should be permeable to analyte.<br>

Example<br>
Preparation of Dye Compound 4<br>
Synthetic Methods and Materials<br>
All reagents used were standard grade unless otherwise<br>
mentioned. Ether and THF were dried by distillation from<br>
sodium/benzophenone under nitrogen. Benzene was dried by standing<br>
over sodium. NMR spectra were on a 250 or 400 MHz spectrometer.<br>
FABMS spectra were obtained using 1,4-dicyanobutane as matrix.<br>
Elemental analysis was done at the University of<br>
Copenhagen, Department of Chemistry, Elemental Analysis<br>
Laboratory, Universitetsparken 5, 2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.<br>
Tris (2,4, 6-trimethoxyphenyl) carbenitun Tetrafluoroborate (1-<br>
BP4) . A solution of phenyllithium was prepared by addition of<br>
bromobenzene (24.5 g, 156 mmol) in dry ether (50 raL) to<br>
lithium wire (2.30 g, 328 mmol) in dry ether (100 ml).<br>
1,3,5-Trimethoxy-benzene (25.1 g, 149 mmol) in dry benzene<br>
(100 mL) was added, and the reaction mixture was stirred at<br>
room temperature under argon for 70 h. Diethyl carbonate<br>
(5.30 g, 45 mmol) in dry benzene (150 mL) was added , and the<br>
reaction mixture was refluxed for 3 days. The cooled reaction<br>
mixture was poured into NaOH solution (300 mL, 1 M) . The<br>
phases were separated, and the water phase was extracted with<br>
ether. The combined organic phases were dried over MgS04 and<br>
filtered yielding a clear yellow solution. Addition of<br>
aqueous HBF4 solution (12 mL, 50% approximately 100 mmol)<br>
resulted in immediate precipitation of the deep blue<br>
carbenium salt. The dark purple precipitate was filtered off,<br>
washed thoroughly with dry ether, and dried over solid KOH to<br>
yield 26.0 'g (96%) of the crude product. Reprecipitation by<br>
addition of water to an acetonitrile solution followed by<br>
recrystallisation from methanol gave the pure compound in 70%<br>
overall yield. 1H NMR (250 MHz, CDC13) ; 8 6.05 (6H,s), 3.99<br>

with 15.0 g of 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene). Instead of HBF4,<br>
gaseous HC1 was bubbled through the hydrolysed and dried<br>
reaction, mixture. The dark purple crystalline precipitate was<br>
filtered off, washed thoroughly with dry ether, and dried<br>
over aolid KOH to yield 10.1 g (66%) of the crude product.<br>

Synthesis of HMCV-3:<br>
Synthesis of the HMCV-3 precursor 4c has been accomplished by<br>
two synthetic routes. A: by a "one-pot" procedure analogous<br>
to the one used in the synthesis of HMCV-1 and HMCV-2, where<br>
the linker carrying atnino group (4-(N-methylamino)-butanic<br>
acid) is introduced first, followed by the two sulfonic acid<br>
substituted amino functions (N-methyl-taurine) (Scheme 3). In<br>
method B the sequence is reversed and performed in two steps<br>
with isolation of the double substituted product 3c (Scheme<br>
4).<br>

acid hydrochloride (0.275 g; 1.8 mmol) , 1 (1.0 g; 1.7 mmol) ,<br>
and diisopropylethylamine (I mL) in DMSO (25 mL) was stirred<br>
for 20 h. at room temperature before sodium N-methyltaurine<br>
(2.0 g, 12 mmol) , diisopropylethylamine- (1 mL) and DMSO (20<br>
mL) was added. The reaction mixture was then stirred for two<br>
days at about 70 °C and two days at room temperature. The<br>
reaction mixture was filtered through silica followed by<br>
thoroughly washing with methanol. The blue filtrate was<br>
concentrated and the crude product precipitated, as a sticky<br>
blue wax, by addition of ethyl acetate. Column chromatography<br>
(silica, MeCN/MeOH 5:2)' gave a blue solid (first blue<br>
fraction/band), which was further purified by dissolution in<br>
hot ethanol followed by filtration (hot). After cooling the<br>
ethanol solution was filtered again and the precipitate was<br>
washed with ethanol (leaving a white material) . The blue<br>
ethanol solution was evaporated yielding 0.3 g of 4c (18%) .<br>

acetate (approx. 500 mL) gave a blue precipitate (and a red<br>

Attachment of KMCV-1 to Aminodextran<br>
Aminodextran (130 mg, Mw 110.000, 0.5 mmol NH2/g dextran) was<br>
dissolved in 6.5 mL aqueous sodium carbonate (15 mM, pH = 8.5<br>
to give a solution with dextran concentration 182 uM, 20<br>
mg/mL) . To 3.0 mL of this solution under stirring was added<br>
HMCV-1 (5.65 mg in 200 uL DMSO) in 10 uL portions over 10<br>
minutes. The solution was stirred at room temperature for 1<br>
hour and dialysed.(3 mL dialysis slide, 12-14.000 MwCO<br>
membrane) extensively against an aqueous phosphate buffer (10<br>
mM H2P04"/HPO4<br>
2', 4 mM K+, 145 mM Na+, 0 . 1 mM Ca2*, 0 . 1 mM Mr.2*,<br>

from the dilution during dialysis. The degree of labelling<br>
(the DOL- value) was determined from a series of UV-Vis<br>
spectra of the resulting solution (3.2 mL, concentration of<br>
dextran 168 uM, DOL = 10) .<br>
Attachment of Alexa Fluor 594™ to Concanavalin A (ConA)<br>
A solution of Con A (Type III, Sigma) was made as follows.<br>
Methyl -a-D-mannopyranoside (0.97 g) , 30 uL aqueous CaCl2 (0.1<br>
M) and 30 p,L aqueous MnCl2 (0.1 M) were mixed in 20 mL 0.5 M<br>
Na2CO3 buffer (pH = 8.5). Then ConA (1.00 g ~ 150 mg protein)<br>
was added and the suspension stirred vigorously for 1 h. The<br>
solution was centrifuged and the supernatant collected.<br>
To 13.0 mL of this solution was added Alexa Fluor 594™ (10.0<br>
mg in 800 mL dry DMSO) in 20 \iL portions over 10 min. The<br>
resulting blue solution was stirred for 1 h and then succinic<br>
anhydride (18.2 mg in 867 uL dry DMSO) was added in 20 [iL<br>
portions over 10 min. The solution was stirred for another<br>
1.5 h after which it was transferred to a 15 mL dialysis<br>
slide and dialysed against the same buffer as described for<br>
the HMCV-1-Dextran synthesis. To the buffer was added 2 mM<br>
NaN3 to prevent growth. (15.4 mL, concentration of protein<br>

Use of analyte binding reagent labelled with Dye Compound 4<br>
in FRET assay<br>
The glucose measurement assay chemistry of the preferred<br>
embodiment is based on the competition between binding of<br>
dextran and glucose to Concanavalin A (Con A) as discussed<br>
above.<br>
Con A is labelled with Alexa Fluor 594 (AF594) (donor)<br>
and dextran is labelled with a non-fluorescent dye, HMCV-1<br>
(acceptor), absorbing within the emission band of AF594.<br>
The fluorescence lifetime is measured by frequencydomain<br>
fluoritnetry. The intensity of the excitation light is<br>
modulated causing the excited donor to emit light modulated<br>
with the same frequency and delayed by the lifetime of the<br>
excited state. This results in a phase shift between the<br>
excitation light and the emitted fluorescence.<br>
We chose AF594-labelled (ConA) as the sugar binding<br>
lectin and the HMCV-1 labelled dextran as a glucose analogue.<br>
The bulk concentrations of the donor and acceptor dyes used,<br>
[AF594] and [HMCV-1] were constant during the whole<br>
experiment and their ratio was 1: 6. This is consistent with<br>
the Forster theory condition that the donor concentration is<br>
much smaller than the acceptor concentration. [Ref. : C.J,<br>
Rolinski, D.J.S. Birch, L.J. McCartney, J.C. Pickup, J.<br>
Photochem. Photobiol. B: Biol. 54, 26-34, 2000] It is our<br>
finding that the Forster theory is best fulfilled when ConA<br>
is labelled with the donor and the poly-sugar dextran is<br>
labelled with the acceptor.<br>

(50 mK PBS-buffer, pH = 7.4, ionic strength adjusted<br>
to 150 mM with NaCl) were mixed so that the final<br>
concentration in the assay chemistry of ConA was 20 /xM and<br>
the concentration of dextran was 50 fiM. The molar ratio<br>
([ConA]/[Dex] ) was 0.40 and the concentration ratio<br>
([AF594]/[HMCV-1]) was 0.16. Two hollow cellulose fibres<br>
(Spectrum Laboratories, Inc., regenerated cellulose, fibre<br>
outer diameter 216 /J.mf fibre inner diameter 200 ^m, MWCO 13<br>
kDa Reorder No. 132294) were filled with assay chemistry, and<br>
were then mounted in a custom-made holder placed in a<br>
fluorescence cell containing PBS-buffer.<br>
The phase excitation shift was measured using a phase<br>
and modulation fluorimeter (Koala from ISS, Inc., Champaign,<br>
Illinois). The light source was a yellow LED. A XF1067 band<br>
pass filter, which transmits light from 540 to 590 rim (Glenn<br>
Spectra Ltd) was placed in the excitation channel as well as<br>
in the reference channel. The emission channel was fitted<br>
with a XF3061 band pass filter, which transmits light from<br>
610 to 690 nm (Glenn Spectra Ltd) .<br>
The glucose dose-response was measured by successive<br>
replacement of the PBS buffer with PBS buffer containing<br>
increasing glucose concentration from 0 mM to 50 mM glucose.<br>
The results are shown in Table 1 and in Fig. 1.<br>
(Table Removed)The above assay system was tested in vivo in a clamped pig<br>
experiment. The assay was loaded in a hollow fiber which by a<br>
needle was placed in the subcutus of the skin. The results<br>
from the phase measurements showed a slight phase shift<br>
compared with the in vitro experiment but could be correlated<br>
very well with reference values for whole blood glucose.<br>
The acceptors of the preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention have a number of advantages over known acceptors.<br>
First, the HMCV acceptors have a broad and intense<br>
absorption spectrum (550 to 700 nm) . This means that they<br>
can be used with a variety of donors (See Fig. 2) .<br>
Second, the acceptors absorb at high wavelengths. This<br>
means that they are suitable for in vivo use at wavelengths<br>
where autofluorescence does not interfere with the<br>
measurements.<br>
Third, the center carbon atom of the dyes is shielded by<br>
ortho substituents on the aromatic moities prohibiting<br>
degradation processes that initiates by either reductive,<br>
oxidative or nucleophilic attack at this position.<br>
Fourth, the absorption spectrum of the acceptors is not<br>
significantly affected by conjugation to analyte or analyte<br>
binding reagent. This means that the performance of the<br>
acceptors is predictable.<br>
Fifth, the acceptors do not fluoresce and will not<br>
contribute to background fluorescence signal.<br>
