The present invention relates to a displacement device for the horizontal displacement of heavy loads according to the preamble of Patent Claim 1.<br>
The main field of application of such displacement devices is that of rerailing technology, in whi-ch derailed locomotives, carriages, etc. can be lifted back onto the track using displacement devices of this type.<br>
Traditional displacement devices of rerailing technology are characterized in that the lifting cylinder is able to be displaced only in one direction by means of a dis¬placement cylinder, the piston rod of which is displace¬ment cylinder being supported on a support by means of a claw engaging on the top side of the said support. If the piston rod is fully extended, an operator has to remove the claw engaging on the support, displace the piston rod and re-insert it at the next recess along in the direc¬tion of displacement. Furthermore, in case of the Deutsche Bundesbahn, for example, only breakdown trains are equipped with such rerailing equipment, which has to be expressly requested in case of need, i.e. in the event of a derailment. In such cases, moreover, cable winches<br>
 .-   in some circumstances result in damage to the running wheels and to mountings of the locomotive or carriage.<br>
a displacement \init which can be used specifically in the event of "minor" derailments, i.e. derailments close to the track, in the form, so to speak, of a compact appli¬ance, without a breakdown train needing to be reqpiested from the railway company.<br>
This object is achieved, with the displacement device of<br><br>
the generic type, by virtue of the features of the defining clause of Patent Claim 1.<br>
The invention allows a compact appliance to be used, which enables the load to be displaced without an oper ator having to make his way beneath the load so as to alter the supporting of the piston rod relative to the support in terms of its position. The displacement device here can be designed such that it can be operated either in one direction only or preferably, indeed, in two opposite directions.<br>
For the securement of the displacement position of the load, a locking valve is expediently provided according to Claim 2.<br>
The displacement cylinder arrangement can be realized in the form of a synchronous cylinder or, where appropriate, a telescopic synchronous cylinder. The latter has the advantage that the displacement length can be addition¬ally enlarged relative to the overall length of the device. Both ensure a movement of the cylinder in both directions.<br>
The use of a friction plate, which is displaceable relative to the slide, enables non-linear displacement of the load, for example along a circular arc, thereby enabling distortions and resaitant perilb OJ. xiit.LcxLj.l-ities of the load to be effectively precluded.<br>
Expediently, the friction plate and slide are placed one  on the other, simply using a correeponding projection and a correspondingly dimensioned recess.<br>
A possible variation of the displacement path of the displacement device according to the invention can additionally be afforded by Fhe fact that on the top side of the slide there is provided a multiplicity of recesses into which the friction plate can optionally be inserted.<br><br>
The support expediently comprises two sc[uare tubes, which are spaced apart and are interconnected by a fastening plate or fastening part and between which there is located the displacement cylinder arrangement or the synchronous cylinder.<br>
The support can advantageously be configured as a one-piece casting, especially an aluminium casting. The fastening of the displacement cylinder arrangement is effected by means of a respective end plate provided on each side.<br>
For the compensation of height tolerances, different spacers can be insertable on the top side of the friction plate, expediently at a corresponding recess for this purpose.<br>
The slide-material discs according to Claim 13 work, on the one hand, by lowering the slide resistance between the slide and the support, whilst simultaneously, on the other hand, constantly cleaning the surface of the support.<br>
The subject of Claim 11 has the advantage that the structural height can be chosen independently of the top edge of the rail arrangement, which, in traditional rerailing devices, forms the support for corresponding cross-beams.<br>
The supply of hydraulic oil to the displacement cylinder is expediently effected by means of the piston rod. The displacement cylindLer and lifting cylinder are respect ively acted on by a dedicated pump, which is driven either manually or else by motor power, thereby increas¬ing the reliability of the system.<br>
Claim 16 shows an expedient embodiment of the diepla^&amp;e-ment device according to the invention as a two-point displacement device. The displacement device according to<br><br>
the invention is particularly well suited to this by virtue of its design.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a displacement device for the horizontal displacement of heavy loads, such as derailed rail vehicles or the like, comprising a lifting cylinder and a hydraulically driven displacement cylinder arrangement having a piston rod, which allows the position of the load raised by means of the lifting cylinder to be altered, characterized in that the lifting cylinder is carried by a slide which is horizontally movable in two opposite directions, the slide is disposed displaceably on the surface of a support and the piston rod of a displacement cylinder arrangement is fixedly connected to the support, the displacement cylinder arrangement is movable along the piston rod, and the displacement cylinder arrangement is in engagement with the slide.<br><br><br>
A plurality of embodiments of the displacement device according to the invention are explained in greater detail below with reference to the drawings, in which:<br>
Fig. 1 shows an expedient embodiment of the displacement device according to the invention in part-section representation;<br>
Fig. 2 shows the displacement device according to Fig. 1 in side view, likewise in part-section;<br>
Fig. 3 shows the displacement device according to Figs. 1 and 2 in top view, depicting the pumps provided for operating purposes;<br>
Fig. 4 shows a further embodiment of the displacement device according to the invention, using a sup¬port in the form of a casting, both in side view and in front-side representation of the casting inclusive of the slide;<br>
Fig. 5 shows a side-view representation of two displace¬ment units, which are coupled together by a linkage, for ensuring two-point lifting; and<br>
Fig. 6 shows a heavily simplified, diagrammatic repre¬sentation of the use of a spacer.<br>
The reference symbol 1 in Fig. 1 identifies the displace¬ment device in its entirety. It comprises a conventional lifting cylinder 2, which is disposed on the top side of a slide 6 having downwardly running lateral edges 28, 29, which slide is movable along a support. Between the lifting cylinder 2 and the slide 6 there is a friction plate 7.<br>
1 8 JUL 2002<br><br>
The support is formed by two square tubes 4, 5, which are iisposed at a distance apart on a fastening plate 22 and an whose top sides there are provided slide-material iiscs 8 for increasing the sliding ability of the slide 6. On the bottom side of the displacement device 1 according to this embodiment there is provided a separate base 12, for example in the form of a metal or wooden block.<br>
Between the two square tubes 4, 5 there is a so-called "synchronous cylinder" 2, preferably a telescopic syn¬chronous cylinder, which moves the slide 6 in the hori¬zontal plane by means of projections 9 and 10, which are disposed axially one behind the other, are provided on the top side and engage in a recess 13 on the said slide 6.<br>
As can be seen from Fig. 2, the respective end of the piston rod 11 is fastened to a transverse-running end plate 17 or 18, which respectively forms, at the same time, the extremity of the two scpaare tvibes 4, 5.<br>
The friction plate 7 has a holding projection 14, which engages in a corresponding recess 15 on the slide 6. The dimensioning of the recess 15 is chosen such that displa-ceability of the friction plate 7 relative to the slide 6 is ensured. By virtue of this design, the friction plate-7 can only be inserted with its holding projection 14 into the recess 15 on the top side of the slide 6.<br>
On the top side of the slide 6, additional recesses (not represented in the figures) can be provided in specific arrangement in order to increase further the displacement variability.<br>
As can be seen from Fig. 2, the synchronous cylinder 3 is connected to the slide 6 by a total of two projections 9 and 10.<br><br>
According to Fig. 3, the synchronous' cylinder 3 and lifting cylinder 2 is respectively operated by means of separate, i.e. mutually independent puinps l9 and 20.<br>
Each of the pumps 19, 2 0 is equipped with a fixing valve 26 and 21 in order to ensure a secure fixing of the load in the respective displacement and lifting states. The two pumps 19, 20 can be constructed either as hand pumps or as motor-driven pumps.<br>
It also becomes clear from Fig. 3 that the supply of hydraulic oil to the synchronous cylinder 3 is effected axially by means of the piston rod 11. The displacement device 1 is provided with two laterally disposed handles 16, whereby the displacement device 1, in the capacity, as it were, of a mobile displacement device 1, can be very easily transported and handled.<br>
In a modification of the embodiment according to Figs. 1 3,  Fig. 4 shows a displacement device 1 having a support in the form of a casting 27, which is positioned on two chocks disposed in the end region.<br>
Fig. 5 shows an arrangement having two displacement devices, connected by a linkage 25, for ensuring two-point lifting. It is here sufficient if only one dis¬placement device 1 is driven in opposition to the dis¬placement device 24.<br>
For the adjustment of the desired height of the lifting cylinder 2, according to Fig. 6 a spacer 2 3 of the necessary size can be inserted between the friction plate 7 and the lifting cylinder 2. To this end, on the top side of the friction plate 7 there can expediently be provided a cavity for the insertion of the spacers in question.<br>
The invention permits the use of an easily transportable and easy-to-handle displacement device, in which there is<br><br>
no need for the displacement device to be reset by operating staff during the displacement operation. It therefore represents a particular benefit in the relevant field of technology.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
