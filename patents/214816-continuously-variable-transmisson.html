[ T7U f. U J<br>
When the rotational speed of the input shaft.23 is increased, the centrifugal weights 55 are moved radially outward by centrifugal forces applied to the centrifugal<br>
„<br>
weights 55, and both the cam faces 26lf 54a are pressed by the centrifugal weights 55. As a result, the cam member 54 is moved in the right direction against an elastic force of the spring 64, so that the second cone holder 56 connected to the cam member 54 through the ball bearing 58 and the<br><br>
axially sliding the first cone holder 31 in accordance with a rotational speed of the input shaft 23. The centrifugal mechanism 51 includes a sleeve 52 fixed around the outer periphery of the input shaft 23 , a cam member 54 slidably fitted around the outer periphery of the sleeve 52 through a bush 53, and a plurality of centrifugal weights 55 disposed between a fixed cam face 26! formed on the right face of the inner gear half 26 of the driven gear 25 and a movable cam face 54 j formed on the left face of the cam member 54. The outer periphery of the second cone holder<br>
56	covering the centrifugal mechanism 51 is fixed by a clip<br>
57	at the right end of the first cone holder 31, and the<br>
inner periphery of the second cone holder 56 is supported<br>
by the cam member 54 through a ball bearing 58.<br>
The first and second cone holders 31, 56 co-.. operates to define a space surrounding the transmission main shaft 21. The space contains the driven gear 25, the drive face 29, and the centrifugal mechanism 51.  The space is also communicated to the inner space of the casing 1 through the window 312 to which the tooth face of the driven gear 25 faces and the windows 31 1 supporting the double cones 39.<br>
windows 33.! formed in the first cone holder 31. A double cone 39 is rotatably supported by each double cone supporting shaft 37 through needle bearings 38. The double cone supporting shafts 37 are disposed along a cone generating line centered on the axial line L of the transmission main shaft 21, and cross a gap between the contact portion 29a of the drive face 29 and the contact portion 30! of the driven face 30.  Each double cone 39 includes a first cone 40 and a second cone 41 which have a common bottom face. The contact portion 29i of the drive face 29 is brought in contact with the first cone 40, while the contact portion 30i of the driven face 30 is brought in contact with the second cone 41.   <br>
A window 312 is opened in the upper portion of the first cone holder 31 facing to the crank shaft 6. The tooth face of the driven gear 25 contained in the first cone holder 31 faces to the window 312, and the drive gear<br>
i<br>
12 meshes with the driven gear 25 through the window 312.<br>
A centrifugal mechanism 51 is provided on the right side of the driven gear 25 for changing the speed change ratio of the continuously variable transmission T by<br>

A pressure adjusting cam mechanism 67 is provided between the right end of an output gear 66 spline-connected to the left end of the output shaft 22 and fixed thereto by a cotter 65 and the left end of the driven face 30. As can be seen from Fig. 4, the pressure adjusting cam mechanism 67 is so configurated that balls 68 are each held between a plurality of recessed portions 66j formed at the. right end of the output gear 66 and a plurality of recessed portions 303 formed at the left end of the driven face 30, and a disc spring 69 for imparting a rightward biasing pre-load to the driven face 30 is interposed 'between the output gear 66 and the driven face 30. When the driven face 30 is applied with a torque and relatively rotated with respect to the output gear 66, it is biased in the direction. being separated from the output gear 66 (right direction, in the figure ) .<br>
Referring again to Fig. 1, a third reduction gear 71 is rotatably supported by the left casing 3 through a ball bearing 70, and the left end of the output shaft 22 is coaxially supported by the 'third reduction gear 71 through<br>
a needle bearing 72 and a ball bearing 73. A reduction shaft 75 is supported by the left casing 3 and the center casing 2 through a pair of ball bearings 74, 74, and first and second reduction gears 76, 77 provided on the reduction shaft 75 mesh with the output gear 66 and the third reduction gear 71, respectively. A drive sprocket 79, around which an endless chain 78 is wound, is provided at the leading end of the shaft portion of the third reduction gear 71 projecting outward from the left casing .4. The rotation of the output shaft 22 is thus transmitted to a drive wheel through the output gear 66, the first, second, third reduction gears 76, 77, 71, the drive sprocket 79, and the endless chain 78.<br>
An oil passage 42 formed in the right casing 4 is communicated to an oil passage 22! axially passing through the output shaft 22, and each portion of the continuously variable transmission T is lubricated by an oil supplied<br>
i<br>
from the oil passage 22 l to the inner space surrounded by the first and second cone holders 31, 56.<br>
Next, the function of the embodiment of the present invention having the above-described configuration will be<br>
described.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, a distance A between the contact portion 29 1 of the drive face 29 and the axial line L of the transmission main shaft 21 is constant, while a distance B between the contact portion 29 i of the drive face 29 and the double cone supporting shaft 37 is variable (BL, BT) . A distance C between the contact portion 30i of the driven face 30 and the double cone supporting shaft 37 is variable (CL, CT) , while a distance D between the contact portion 30i of the driven face 30 and the axial line L of the transmission main shaft 21 is constant.<br>
A speed change ratio R is given by<br>
R = NDR/NDN =   (B/A)X(D/C)<br>
where NDR is a rotational speed of the drive face 29 and NDN is a rotational speed of the driven face 30. •[0027]—<br>
When the engine E is rotated at a low speed, the rotational speed of the driven gear 25 driven by the drive gear 12 is low.  At this time, as shown on the  upper half in Fig. 2, since centrifugal forces applied to the centrifugal weights 55 of the centrifugal mechanism 51 are<br>
low, the second cone holder 56 and the first cone holder 31 are moved in the left direction by the elastic force of the spring 64. As the first cone holder 31 is moved in the left direction, the contact portion 29 i of the drive face 29 is moved on the bottom face side of the first cone 40 of the double cone 39 and thereby the distance B is increased to the maximum value BL, while the contact portion 30 1 of the driven face 30 is moved on the vertex side of the second cone 41 of the double cone 39 and thereby the distance C is decreased to the minimum value CL.<br>
When the distance B is increased to' the maxim value BL and the distance C is decreased to "the minimum value CL as described above (the distances A, D are constant), the speed change ratio R is increased into a LOW ratio.<br>
On the other hand, when the engine E is rotated at a high speed, the rotational speed of the driven gear 25 driven by the drive gear 12 is high. At this tjjne, as shown on the lower half in Fig. 2, since centrifugal forces applied to the centrifugal weights 55 of the centrifugal mechanism 51 are high, the second cone holder 56 and the first cone holder 31 are moved in the right direction<br>
against the elastic force of the spring 64 by the action of the centrifugal weights 55 moved radially outward by the centrifugal forces. As the first cone holder 31 is moved in the right direction, the contact portion 29i of the drive face 29 is moved on the vertex side of the first cone 40 of the double cone 39 and thereby the distance B is decreased to the minimum value BT, while the contact portion 30i-of the driven face 30 is moved on the bottom face side of the second cone 41 of the double cone 39 and thereby the distance C is increased to the maximum value<br>
When the distance B is decreased to the minimum value BT and the distance C is increased to the maximum value CL as described above (the distances A, D are constant), the speed change ratio R is decreased into a TOP ratio .<br>
In' this way, the speed change ratio of the continuously variable transmission T can be continuously changed between the LOW and TOP sides in accordance with the rotational speed of the engine E.  Furthermore, since the speed change ratio is automatically controlled by the<br>
centrifugal mechanism 51, it becomes possible to reduce the cost due to simplification of the structure and to reduce the size of the continuously variable transmission T as compared with the case of provision of a speed change controller for manually controlling speed change from the outside of the casing 1 or of provision of ah electronic speed change controller.<br>
The rotation of the drive dace 29 is thus transmitted at a specified speed change ratio R to the driven face 30 through the double cones 39 and the rotation of the driven face 30 is transmitted to the output gear 66 through the pressure adjusting cam mechanism 67. At this time, when a relative rotation is generated between the driven face 30 and the output gear 66 by a torque applied to the driven face 30, the driven face 30 is biased in the direction being separated from the output gear 66 by the pressure adjusting cam mechanism 67. The biasing force<br>
i<br>
generates, in co-operation with the biasing force by the disc spring 69, a face pressure for pressing the contact portion 29i of the drive face 29 to the first cone 40 of the double cone 39 and a face pressure for pressing the contact portion 30]. of the driven face 30 to the second<br>
cone 41 of the double cone 39<br>
Incidentally, while the biasing force by the pressure adjusting cam mechanism 67 presses the output gear 66 in the left direction, the leftward pressing force is transmitted to the output gear 22 because the left end of the output gear 66 is fixed to the left end of the output shaft 22 by the cotter 65. Furthermore, while the biasing force by the pressure adjusting cam mechanism 67 presses the driven face 30 in the right direction, the rightward pressing force is transmitted from the driven face 30 to the right end of the output shaft 22 through the double cones 39, the drive face 29, the inriet gear half 26, the sleeve 52, the ball bearing 62, the collar 59, the ball bearing 60, and the cotter 61.<br>
Accordingly, the load applied from the pressure adjusting cam mechanism 67 to the output gear 66 and the driven face 30 for respectively pressing them in the left and right directions, acts as a tensile load for the output shaft 22, and the tensile load is canceled by an internal stress of the output shaft 22.  As a result, the pressing load of the pressure adjusting cam mechanism 67 is not<br>
transmitted to the casing 1. This eliminates the need of reinforcing the strength of the casing 1 to such an extent as to withstand the pressing load, thereby reducing the weight of the continuously variable transmission T. Furthermore, since the drive face 29 and the driven face 30 are biased only by one pressure adjusting cam mechanism 67, it is possible to reduce the number of parts and the cost as compared with the case where they are biased by separate pressure cam mechanisms 67 respectively.<br>
Although the first cone holder 31 is intended to be rotated around the transmission main shaft 21 by a reaction force to the transmission torque of :the drive face 29 upon speed change operation by the continuously variable transmission T, the reaction force to the transmission torque is received by engagement between the roller 36 of the torque cam mechanism 33 supported by the first cone holder 31 and the guide groove 4i formed in the right<br>
•"'	t<br>
casing 4, and consequently the first cone holder 31 can be slid in the axial direction without any rotation.<br>
When an engine torque is rapidly increased for rapid acceleration during running of a veh'icle, a reaction<br>
force to a transmission torque, which is applied to the first cone holder 31, is increased with the rapid increase in the engine torque. As a result, as shown in Fig. 3, the roller 36 is brought in press-contact with the wall face of the inclined guide groove 4j by a load F, and the first cone holder 31 is biased on the left side (on the LOW ratio side) in Fig. 2 by a component F! of the load F applied in the direction of the guide groove 4i- Namely, the speed change ratio is automatically changed on the LOW ratio side by the action of the torque cam mechanism 33, so that the so-called kick-down effect is exhibited and the vehicle can be effectively accelerated.<br>
Furthermore, the speed change ratio control upon kick-down can be automatically performed by the torque cam mechanism 33 in accordance with a change in engine torque without the need of provision of any special speed change controller, so that it is possible to reduce the cost due to simplification of the structure and to reduce the size of the continuously variable transmission T.  In addition, the change characteristic of the speed change ratio can be easily adjusted only by changing the shape of the guide groove 4i of thfe torque cam mechanism 33.<br>
Although the lower portions of the first and second cone holders 31, 56 of the continuously variable transmission T are immersed in oil stored in the bottom portion of the casing 1, a large amount of oil does not permeate from the bottom portion of the casing 1 into the inner space surrounded by the first and second cone holders 31, 56 because the windows 31i for supporting the double cones 39 and the window 32j to which the gear tooth of the driven gear 25 faces are positioned higher than an oil level OL of the oil (see Fig. 2). Even if a lubricating oil is supplied from the oil passage 22j passing through the output shaft 22 into the inner space surrounded by the first and second cone holders 31, 56, the oil is scattered outward by the centrifugal force generated by rotation of the driven gear 25. As a result, the minimum oil required for lubrication is held in the inner space surrounded by the first and second cone holders 31, 56.<br>
Since the driven gear 25 stirs only a small amount of oil as described above, it is possible to suppress a loss in power due to stirring of unnecessary oil at minimum.  Furthermore, since the oil permeation is<br>
preventive by the first and second cone holders 31, 56, it is possible to eliminate the need of provision of any special oil preventive member and hence to reduce the number of parts.<br>
As described above, the arrangement of the driven gear 25 in the space defined by the first and second cone holders 31, 56 makes it possible to reduce oil stirring resistance as compared with the case of arrangement of the driven gear 25 outside the space. Furthermore, the arrangement of the drive face 29 and the centrifugal mechanism 51 on the right and left sides of the driven gear 25 respectively makes it possible td make use of the capacity of the space and hence to make compact the continuously variable transmission T.

While the embodiment of the present invention has been described in detail, such description is for<br>
_,-	i<br>
illustrative purposes only, and it is to be understood that changes and modifications may be made without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention. <br>
For example, although the roller 36 is provided on<br>
the first cone holder 31 side and the roller groove 4i is provided on the casing 1 side in the torque cam mechanism 33 of the embodiment, such a positional relationship may be reversed. [6043]-<br>
[Effect of the Invention]<br>
As described above, according to the invention described in claim 1, a torque cam mechanism has a guide groove and a guided member, wherein the guide member is provided on one of a casing and cone holders in such a manner as to be inclined to the axial line and the guided member is provided on the other of the casing and the cone holders in such a manner as to be erigaged with the guide groove. Consequently, it is possible to automatically control a speed change ratio of the continuously variable transmission in accordance with a torque transmitted-to the cone holders without the need of manual speed change operation or without the need of provision of an electric controller with a complex structure, and to easily adjust the speed change characteristic by suitably setting the shape of the guide groove. [0044]<br>
According to the invention described in claim 2, a<br>
centrifugal mechanism has a fixed cam face provided on the<br>
t<br>
back side of a drive face and fixed along the axial line, a movable cam face provided opposite to the fixed cam and movable together with cone holders along the axial line, and centrifugal weights disposed between both the cam faces. Consequently, it is possible to automatically control a speed change ratio of the continuously variable transmission in accordance with an input rotational speed of a transmission main shaft without the need of manual speed change operation or without the need of provision of an electric controller with a complex structure, and to reduce the axial size of the continuously variable transmission by reasonable lay-out df^the centrifugal mechanism.<br>
According to the invention described in claim 3, since the speed change of the continuously variable transmission can be automatically controlled in accordance with a torque transmitted to the cone holders and an input rotational speed of the transmission main shaft, it is possible to provide a continuously variable transmission suitable for a vehicle at a low cost.<br>
