				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to halogenated 4-aminophenols and to halogenated 4-(phenyl-diazenyl)phenols, to a process for their preparation and to the use of the halogenated 4-hydroxy-phenols for preparing active ingredients, especially in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals.<br>
Halogenated phenols, especially fluorinated phenols, are valuable starring materials for the preparation of active ingredients in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, since the fluorine substituents increase the lipophilicity and therefore the membrane permeability of the entire active ingredient molecule. For example, fluorinated 4-hydroxyanilines are particularly suitable as starting materials for preparing active ingredients which are used for treating chronic bronchitis (see also WO 03/08413 and PCT/03/02154).<br>
The preparation, for example, of 2,5-difluoro-4-hydroxyaniline is typically effected by nitrating 2,5-difluorophenol and subsequently reducing (see JP-A 63 310850).<br>
A disadvantage of this synthetic route is that the nitration reaction does not proceed selectively and the 4-nitrophenol desired as an intermediate is obtainable only in poor yields.<br>
There is therefore a need to provide a process which enables the preparation of halogenated 4-aminophenols in good yields and in a simple manner.<br>
A process has now been found for preparing compounds of the formula (I) (Formula Removed)<br>

Afterwards, at 5° - 0°C, 95.2 g (1.38 mol) of sodium nitrite (dissolved in 283 ml of water) are added dropwise and the solution is stirred for another 60 minutes on completion of addition. Excess sodium nitrite is destroyed with amidosulphuric acid.<br>

The above freshly prepared diazonium salt solution is added to this solution at such a rate that the internal temperature does not rise above 5°C. During the addition, the pH is monitored regularly. On completion of addition, the mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature, and stirred for a further 60 minutes, and the suspension is then adjusted to pH 4 using 2N HC1. The product is filtered off and washed repeatedly with water. After the drying in a vacuum drying cabinet, 182 g (quantitative yield) of the desired orange-brown azo compound are obtained.<br>

Example 4<br>
Preparation of 4-amino-2,3-difluorophenol<br>
61 g (0.26 mol) of 2,3-difluoro-4-(phenyldiazenyl)phenol from Example 3 and 1 g of Pd/C (10%) are initially charged in 800 ml of ethanol. The solution is degassed and aerated with hydrogen. The mixture is stirred at room temperature under a 1 bar hydrogen atmosphere for 18 hours. On completion of hydrogen uptake, the catalyst is filtered off and the filtrate is concentrated on a rotary evaporator, in the course of which the product already crystallizes out. The resulting solid is filtered off, washed with a little cold ethanol and dried under high vacuum for 4 hours. 28 g (74%) of the desired compound are obtained as a light brown powder.<br>
1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6) δ = 4.72 (s, 2H, NH2), 6.39 (t, 1H, Ar-H), 6.51 (t, 1H, Ar-H), 9.13 (s, 1H, OH);<br>
EI-MS: m/z 145 [M]+<br>
Example 5<br>
Preparation of 2,5-difluoro-4-(phenyldiazenyl)phenol<br>
At 0°C, 17.5 ml (0.19 mol) of aniline are added dropwise with vigorous stirring to 185 ml of HC1 (semiconc). Afterwards, at 5° - 0°C, 13.9 g (0.2 mol) of NaN02 (dissolved in 50 ml of water) are added dropwise and, on completion of addition, the solution is stirred for another 20 minutes.<br>
In a further flask, 25 g (0.19 mol) of 2,5-difluorophenol are dissolved in 190 ml of 2N NaOH and precooled to 0°C. The above freshly prepared diazo solution is added to this solution at such a rate that the internal temperature does not rise above 5°C. During the addition, the pH is monitored regularly and, if necessary, made alkaline again by means of Na2CO3. On completion of addition, the mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature, stirred for a further 30 minutes, and the suspension is then adjusted to pH 3-4 using 2N HC1. The product is filtered off and washed repeatedly with water. After drying in a vacuum drying cabinet at 50°C, 42 g (93%) of the desired orange-coloured azo compound are obtained.<br>
EI-MS: m/z 234 [M]+<br>
Example 6<br>
Preparation of 4-amino-2,5-difluorophenol<br>
42 g (0.18 mol) of 2,5-difluoro-4-(phenyldiazenyl)phenol from Example 5 and 1 g of Pd/C (10%) are initially charged in 650 ml of ethanol. The solution is degassed and aerated with hydrogen. The mixture is stirred at room temperature under a 1 bar hydrogen atmosphere for 18 hours. On completion of hydrogen uptake, the catalyst is filtered off and the filtrate distilled under reduced pressure, and dried under high vacuum at 70°C for 4 hours. The residue (24 g) is recrystallized from ethanol and dried. 15 g (60%) of 4-amino-2,5-difluorophenol are obtained as orange-brown powder.<br>
1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-ds) δ = 4.68 (s, 2H, NH2), 6.58 (m, 2H, Ar-H), 9.05 (s, 1H, OH);<br>
EI-MS: m/z 145 [M]+<br>
Example 7<br>
Preparation of 2-trifluoromethoxy-4-(phenyldiazenyI)phenol<br>
At 0°C, 10.23 ml (0.11 mmol) of aniline are added dropwise with vigorous stirring to 50 ml of HC1 (semiconc). Afterwards, at 5° - 0°C, 8.1 g (0.117 mol) of NaN02 (dissolved in 30 ml of water) are added dropwise and, on completion of addition, the solution is stirred for a further 20 minutes.<br>
In a further flask, 20.0 g (0.12 mol) of 2-trifluoromethoxyphenol are dissolved in 140 ml of 2N NaOH and precooled to 0°C. The above freshly prepared diazo solution is added to this solution at such a rate that the internal temperature does not rise above 5°C. During the addition, the pH is monitored regularly and, if necessary, made alkaline again by means of Na2CO3. On completion of addition, the mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for a further 30 minutes, and the suspension is then adjusted to pH 3-4 using 2N HC1. The product is filtered off with suction and washed repeatedly with water. After drying in a vacuum drying cabinet, 26g (81%) of the desired light brown azo compound are obtained.<br>
Example 8<br>
Preparation of 4-amino-2-trifluoromethoxyphenol<br>
25 g (0.09 mol) of 2-trifluoromethoxy-4-(phenyldiazenyl)phenol from Example 7 and 1 g of Pd/C (10%) are initially charged in 350 ml of ethanol. The solution is degassed and aerated with hydrogen. The mixture is stirred at room temperature under a 1 bar hydrogen atmosphere for 72 hours. On completion of hydrogen uptake, the catalyst is filtered off and the filtrate concentrated on a rotary evaporator, in the course of which the product already crystallizes out. The resulting solid is filtered off with suction, washed with a little cold ethanol and dried under high vacuum for 4 hours. 8.5 g (50%) of the desired compound are obtained as a light brown powder.<br>
1'H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6) δ = 4.72 (s, 2H, NH2), 6.42 (d, 1H, J = 8.6 Hz, Ar-H), 6.5 (s, 1H, Ar-H), 6.72 (d, 1H, J = 8.6 Hz, Ar-H), 8.9 (s, 1H, OH);<br>
