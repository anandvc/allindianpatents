FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention, in general, is related to Television (TV) systems. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method by which a television automatically plays a radio station on receiving no video signal.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
Currently there are scenarios of TV signal interruption from the broadcasters as well as from the cable TV operators. During these occurrences of signal interruption, the TV set doesn't display anything. Broadcast signal interruptions and cable operator signal interruptions do happen in Television and during those instances; the TV doesn't display anything on the screen. In older televisions we do observe the white dotted screen occurring when there is no signal. In a normal or conventional television, the other side of the TV screen is coated with Phosphor, which emits visible light when exposed to radiation. An electron beam traverses this coating for an image to appear on the screen. The intensity of the pixel is controlled by the intensity of the electron beam that falls on a screen on a pixel by pixel basis. The electron beam traverses in a fashion as depicted in fig 1 to display a frame of telecast at a particular instant of time. A composite video signal that is transmitted from the broadcaster has<br><br>
three components namely Intensity, Horizontal retrace and Vertical retrace as described in the figure 2.<br>
On a typical composite video signal, the intensity varies between 0.5v to 2 V for different levels of grey i.e. 0.5 for black and 2v for white. At the moment when there is no video signal, a signal of strength of 2v is fed to the electron gun. The Gun in turn emits an electron beam of full strength that is made to hit the coating to emit white. The same happens as the electron beam traverses and we get the white dotted screen when there is no video signal. In recent color televisions, instead of white dotted screen we obsen/e a blue screen appearing on the screen. Currently available TV sets don't have means to entertain the viewer when the TV signal goes off abruptly.<br>
US 3643167 discloses TV sets with a feature that provides an automatic system for turning off a television receiver when there is no signal on the channel to which the television set is tuned. This system is sensitive only to the FM sound carrier so that the turning off of the set will occur only in the absence of an audio signal.<br>
The drawback with the related art or in the current day television is that they do not provide an alternative option for the user when there is no video signal. It gives an unpleasant experience when the signal goes off<br><br>
abruptly. The user now has to either wait for reception of television signal or he has to switch off the television.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to television systems. More specifically, it relates to a television set that entertains a viewer when the television signals are not present. Generally a white dotted screen or a blue screen appears during an interruption in the broadcast. The present invention provides alternate content to entertain the viewer during the interruption. The alternate content provided by the television set of the present invention during the absence of signals or interruption of broadcast can be a radio tuner, a video player, or display of images stored in a secondary storage device such as internal memory of the television or hard disk of a personal computer.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a method for providing alternate content to the television viewer during the absence of signals or during the interruption of signals, wherein the alternate content is provided by a radio tuner, a video player or display of images stored in a secondary storage device such as internal memory of the television or hard disk of a personal computer or an external hard drive or any such external storage device known in the market.<br><br>
In the method according to the present invention the alternate content is provided by playing a radio station when there is no video signal or during video signal interruption, wherein the radio tuner is included in the television set, wherein every channel is allotted with a different frequency to differentiate between the channels, wherein the frequency tuner on television tunes to the selected channel, wherein the interruption in video signal is detected and the radio tuner for the preset frequency is selected.<br>
In the method according to the present invention when there is an interruption, the sound signal that comes along with the composite television signal is suppressed and the sound signals from the radio tuner are fed to the television amplifiers which in turn are fed to the television loudspeakers.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide alternate content by means of a video player, wherein the video player associated with the television set is switched on by sending sequence of instruction to the video player when the interruption in video signal is detected in video signal. The video player can be any conventional video player such as VCR, VCP or any other video player known in the market.<br>
Accordingly the invention explains a method for providing alternate content in  a television device during the absence of signals or during the<br><br>
interruption of signals, wherein the alternate content is provided by a radio tuner, a video player or display of images stored in a secondary storage device.<br>
The secondary storage device is an internal memory device in the television device. The secondary storage device is an external memory outside the television device. The alternate content is provided by playing a radio station using a radio tuner in the television device. Each channel in the television device is allotted with a specific frequency in a radio tuner and on detection of interruption of signals the specific frequency associated with a radio tuner is selected. On detection of interruption, sound signals that comes along with a composite television signal is suppressed and sound signals from the radio tuner are fed to the television device. On detection of interruption the television device is adapted to be configured to provide alternate content by means of a video from a video player associated with the television device.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
