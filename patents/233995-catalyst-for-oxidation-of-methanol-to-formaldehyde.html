				<td>CATALYST FOR OXIDATION OF METHANOL TO FORMALDEHYDE<br>
The present invention relates to a catalyst for oxidation of methanol<br>
to formaldehyde, to the method for preparing the catalyst, and to its use in<br>
processes for preparing formaldehyde.<br>
Catalysts used industrially in processes for oxidation of methanol to<br>
formaldehyde (commonly termed iron molybdates, since Fe2(Mo04)3 is one<br>
of the main active components), comprise both Fe2(Mo04)3 and<br>
molybdenum trioxide (M0O3), uniformly distributed within the mass of the<br>
catalyst.<br>
In fresh catalysts, the Fe/Mo ratio is generally higher than 1.5 and not<br>
higher than 5; however, it is subject to changes during oxidation due to<br>
losses of M0O3, which occur mainly at the inlet of the fresh reagents in the<br>
catalytic bed and in hot spot temperature regions (maximum temperature<br>
inside the reactor).<br>
The loss of M0O3 determines decreases in the performance of the<br>
catalyst. This requires, after a more or less long period of use, the<br>
replacement of the catalyst, which is a long and expensive operation.<br>
The loss of M0O3 causes, in addition to a reduction in the<br>
performance of the catalyst, the collapse of the catalytic bed and the<br>
consequent increase in load losses.<br>
The need is therefore felt for a catalyst capable of providing constant<br>
performance for sufficiently long periods of time.<br>
A catalyst has now been unexpectedly found which meets the above<br>
cited requirements and comprises, in addition to the Fe2(Mo04)3/Mo03<br>
mixtures (hereinafter termed "basic catalyst"), in which the Mo/Fe atomic<br>
ratio is higher than 1.5 and does not exceed 5, also a compound of cerium,<br>
molybdenum and oxygen (hereinafter cerium molybdate) in a quantity of<br>
0.2-10% by weight expressed as cerium. Preferably, the basic catalyst has a<br>
composition Fe2(Mo04)3 2Mo03, and cerium molybdate is present in<br>
quantities from 0.2 to 5% by weight as cerium.<br>
The cerium molybdate is added as molybdate of cerium in which<br>
cerium can be tri- and/or tetravalent. During the activation of the catalyst<br>
and/or during use, the starting cerium molybdate can undergo<br>
transformations.<br>
An X-ray diffractogram recorded on the finished catalyst in high-<br>
resolution conditions (using a high signal-to-noise ratio, a 40-KV copper<br>
tube, 40 microamperes, with CuKa=1.540 598A, range of 2 theta angle of 5<br>
to 125, step 0.01 and collection time of 15 seconds/step) shows, at relatively<br>
low cerium concentrations (3000 ppm), diffraction lines at lattice distances<br>
d=8.44A, d=6.69A and d=4.79A, which do not appear in the diffractogram<br>
of the catalyst without cerium, and, at higher cerium concentrations (17000<br>
ppm), lines which appear at shorter lattice distances and specifically at<br>
distances d=4.7A, d=4.29A, d=3.37A, d=3.04A, and d=2.75A, while the<br>
lines observed at concentrations of 3000 ppm shift to higher lattice<br>
distances, i.e., d=8.53A, d=6.74A and d=4.82A.<br>
The addition of cerium molybdate has the effect of lowering<br>
significantly the hot spot temperature with respect to a catalyst without<br>
cerium molybdate, thus increasing the stability of the catalytic bed and<br>
therefore its life. The other catalyst performances, such as conversion of<br>
methanol and selectivity to formaldehyde, remain practically unchanged.<br>
The catalyst is prepared starting from an aqueous suspension which<br>
contains the base catalyst, obtained according to known methods such as for<br>
example precipitation from a solution of a soluble ferric salt (FeCl3,<br>
Fe(NO3)3 and similar soluble salts), mixed with a solution of a soluble<br>
molybdate, such as a molybdate of an alkaline metal and/or ammonium<br>
(suspension 1) and from a suspension of cerium molybdate (suspension 2)<br>
obtained by reacting, while hot, an aqueous mixture of molybdenum trioxide<br>
(M0O3) and cerium carbonate with a cerium title of 42% by weight, with a<br>
Mo/Ce molar ratio of 1.5 to 3, preferably 1.6-2.1, until the generation of CO2<br>
)    ceases.<br>
As an alternative, the suspension 2 can be obtained by mixing a<br>
suspension of a molybdate of an alkaline metal and/or of ammonium with a<br>
solution of a soluble trivalent cerium salt using a Mo/Ce ratio of 1.5 and<br>
washing with water the resulting suspension until the undesired ions (NIV,<br>
Na+ and the like) disappear.<br>
The cerium molybdate can also be prepared and added to in the base<br>
catalyst as tetravalent cerium molybdate by reacting a cerium salt and a<br>
molybdate in an aqueous solution.<br>
Suspensions 1 and 2 are then mixed together and the final product is<br>
dried by spray drying so as to obtain a powder suitable to form pellets,<br>
generally in the form of cylinders with a through bore or cylinders with a<br>
three-lobed cross-section, provided with through bores at the lobes, which<br>
have axes that are parallel to the axis of the granule, or having other shapes.<br>
The granules have a height of generally 2 to 7 mm.<br>
The granules are then activated by calcination in an oxidizing<br>
atmosphere (air) at temperatures from 450° to 600 °C, preferably from 480°<br>
to 580 °C.<br>
Calcination lasts generally four or more hours.<br>
The final catalyst has a specific surface (BET) of 1-7 m2/g, preferably<br>
3-6 m7g.<br>
It is also possible, but it is not one of the preferred methods, to mix<br>
uniformly a powder of tri- and/or tetravalent cerium molybdate with a<br>
powder or slurry of the base catalyst.<br>
It has been found, and this is an additional aspect of the catalysts<br>
according to the present invention, that said catalysts, particularly those<br>
having a specific surface of 3-6 m2/g, can be used conveniently to form the<br>
layer of the catalytic bed wherein the hot spot temperature is reached which<br>
is in contact with the fresh reagents. Use of this layer allows to reduce<br>
significantly the hot spot temperature in the catalytic bed.<br>
The oxidation of the methanol is performed according to known<br>
methods.<br>
The gas mixtures comprise methanol in concentrations from 6 to 10%<br>
by volume and oxygen in concentrations from 9 to 13% by volume, the<br>
remainder being inert gas (for example nitrogen).<br>
The reactor is of the bundle-tube type and the reaction heat is<br>
removed by a cooling liquid, which circulates outside the pipes.<br>
The linear velocity of the gases is comprised from 1 to 2 Nm/sec; the<br>
temperature of the bath is from 250 to 320 °C.<br>
Preferably, the gas mixture is fed into the reactor at a temperature<br>
comprised from 120 to 160 °C.<br>
The following examples are given to illustrate but not to limit the<br>
scope of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
A pilot plant used for catalytic tests of methanol oxidation to<br>
formaldehyde is constituted by a tubular reactor immersed in a molten salt<br>
bath. The reactor is 1950 mm long and has an inside diameter of 20.4 mm.<br>
The catalyst is placed in the central part of the reactor so as to ensure<br>
maximum isothermicity.<br>
The supply gases are introduced from the top of the reactor. The air<br>
and nitrogen are dosed by mass-flow and methanol is dosed by means of a<br>
constant-flow pump and is first sent to an evaporator.<br>
The stream exiting the reactor and the gases after the purging column<br>
are analyzed by gas chromatography.<br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of cerium molybdate<br>
Reagents:<br>
418.6 g cerium carbonate (Ce=42%)<br>
271.0 g molybdenum trioxide<br>
In a reactor with a capacity of approximately 10 liters, provided with<br>
efficient mechanical agitation, temperature measurement and control<br>
system, gas inlet and exit tube, the necessary demineralized water<br>
(approximately 4 liters) and the molybdenum trioxide are loaded. Heating is<br>
performed under agitation up to the temperature of 70 °C; cerium carbonate<br>
is added over approximately 60 minutes and agitation and heating are<br>
continued for approximately 5 hours. A dense and voluminous yellow<br>
precipitate is formed. The amount of the obtained cerium molybdate is<br>
sufficient to prepare approximately 58.6 kg of catalyst containing<br>
approximately 0.3% cerium.<br>
Example 2<br>
Preparation of cerium molybdate<br>
Reagents<br>
2.5 kg cerium carbonate (Ce=42%).<br>
1.62 kg molybdenum trioxide<br>
In a reactor with a capacity of approximately 20 liters, equipped with<br>
efficient mechanical agitation, temperature control and measurement<br>
system, gas inlet and exit tube, the necessary demineralized water<br>
(approximately 12 liters) is loaded together with the molybdenum trioxide.<br>
Heating is performed under agitation up to the temperature of 70 °C; cerium<br>
carbonate is added over approximately 60 minutes and agitation and heating<br>
continue for approximately 5 hours. A dense and voluminous yellow<br>
precipitate is formed. The resulting quantity of cerium molybdate is<br>
sufficient to prepare approximately 61 kg of catalyst containing<br>
approximately 1.7% cerium.<br>
Comparison example 1<br>
Preparation of a catalyst which does not contain cerium<br>
Reagents:<br>
23.8 kg molybdenum trioxide<br>
40.0 kg sodium molybdate dihydrate<br>
35.2 kg ferric chloride hexahydrate<br>
In a container with a capacity of approximately 2.5 m3, equipped with<br>
a mechanical agitator, a temperature measurement and control system,<br>
approximately 1 m3 of demineralized water, the molybdenum trioxide and<br>
the sodium molybdate are loaded. Heating is performed to 60 °C until the<br>
solids dissolve completely.<br>
The solution of ferric chloride, prepared separately (approximately<br>
0.5 m3), is added over 90 minutes, keeping the reaction temperature constant<br>
at 60 °C.<br>
Once the addition of the ferric chloride has ended, agitation is<br>
continued for 10 minutes, the mass is brought to the volume of 2 m3 with<br>
demineralized water, agitation is stopped and cooling is allowed until room<br>
temperature is reached.<br>
After decantation of the precipitated solid, the supernatant clear liquid<br>
is made to overflow and then the solid is filtered on a fabric filter, and<br>
washed with demineralized water to eliminate the chlorides that are present.<br>
The resulting filtration cake is poured into an appropriate tank and<br>
converted into a slurry by mechanical agitation.<br>
The slurry is then fed to a spray-dryer, to convert it into dry powder.<br>
The resulting powder is converted, after lubrication, into pellets having the<br>
shape of a perforated cylinder. Calcination of the pellets at 500 °C for 4<br>
hours leads to the formation of the catalyst used in the oxidation of<br>
methanol to formaldehyde.<br>
Example 3<br>
Preparation of a catalyst containing cerium<br>
Reagents<br>
23.8 kg molybdenum trioxide<br>
40.0 kg sodium molybdate dihydrate<br>
35.2 kg ferric chloride hexahydrate<br>
In a container with a capacity of approximately 2.5 m3, equipped with<br>
a mechanical agitator, and with temperature measurement and control<br>
system, approximately 1.0 m3 of demineralized water, the molybdenum<br>
trioxide and the sodium molybdate are loaded. Heating is performed up to<br>
the temperature of 60 °C until the solids dissolve completely.<br>
The solution of ferric chloride prepared separately (approximately 0.5<br>
m3) is added over a period of 90 minutes, keeping the reaction temperature<br>
constant at 60 °C.<br>
Once the addition of the ferric chloride has ended, agitation is<br>
continued for 10 minutes, the mass is brought to the volume of 2 m3 with<br>
demineralized water, agitation is stopped and cooling is allowed until room<br>
temperature is reached.<br>
After decantation of the precipitated solid, the supernatant liquid is<br>
overflowed and then the solid fraction is filtered on a fabric filter, and<br>
washed with demineralized water to eliminate the chlorides that are present.<br>
The resulting filtration cake is poured into an appropriate tank and<br>
converted into a slurry by mechanical agitation. The resulting slurry is<br>
added with the suspension of cerium molybdate prepared according to<br>
Example 1. After vigorous agitation for at least 30 minutes, the resulting<br>
suspension is fed to a spray dryer, to obtain a dry powder. The resulting<br>
powder is converted, after lubrication, into cylindrical pellets which have a<br>
three-lobed cross-section and are provided with through bores at the lobes.<br>
The calcination of the pellets at 500 °C for four hours leads to the formation<br>
of the catalyst containing 0.3% by weight of cerium (from chemical<br>
analysis), in the form of cerium molybdate.<br>
Preparation of a catalyst containing cerium<br>
Reagents:<br>
23.8 kg molybdenum trioxide<br>
40.0 kg sodium molybdate dihydrate<br>
35.2 kg ferric chloride hexahydrate<br>
In a container with a capacity of approximately 2 m3, provided with a<br>
mechanical agitator, temperature measurement and control system,<br>
approximately 1 m3 of demineralized water, the molybdenum trioxide and<br>
the sodium molybdate are loaded. Heating is performed up to the<br>
temperature of 60 °C, until complete dissolution of the solids is achieved<br>
with consequent formation of sodium dimolybdate.<br>
The solution of ferric chloride prepared separately (approximately 0.5<br>
m3) is added over a period of 90 minutes, keeping the reaction temperature<br>
constant at 60 °C.<br>
Once the addition of the ferric chloride has ended, agitation is<br>
continued for 10 minutes, the mass is brought to the volume of 20 m3 with<br>
demineralized water, agitation is stopped, and cooling to room temperature<br>
is allowed.<br>
After decantation of the precipitated solid, the supernatant clear liquid<br>
is overflowed and then the solid is filtered on a fabric filter and washed with<br>
demineralized water to eliminate the chlorides that are present. The resulting<br>
filtration cake is poured into an appropriate tank and converted into a slurry<br>
by mechanical agitation.<br>
The resulting slurry is added with the suspension of cerium<br>
molybdate prepared according to Example 2.<br>
The two products are mixed uniformly by vigorous agitation for at<br>
least 30 minutes and then fed to a spray dryer, which allows to obtain a dry<br>
powder.<br>
The resulting powder is converted, after lubrication, into three-lobed<br>
pellets of the type prepared in Example 3.<br>
Calcination of the pellets at 500 °C for four hours leads to the<br>
formation of the catalyst, which contains approximately 1.56% by weight of<br>
cerium, (from chemical analysis) in the form of cerium molybdate.<br>
Comparison example 2<br>
The preparation of Comparison example 1 is repeated with the only<br>
difference that together with the molybdenum trioxide and the sodium<br>
molybdate, 418.6 kg of cerium carbonate and the corresponding quantity<br>
(271 g) of molybdenum trioxide are loaded.<br>
The cerium present in the powder after calcination is only 20% of the<br>
cerium present in the starting cerium compound.<br>
Example 5<br>
Catalytic tests<br>
A catalytic bed is used which is constituted by two layers: an upper layer of<br>
400 mm of ceramic rings and a lower layer of 700 mm of catalyst.<br>
The total inlet gas flow-rate is 1765 Nl/hour. The O2 content  of the<br>
mixture at inlet is 9.5%.<br>
The results of the test by using the catalyst of Comparison example 1<br>
are given in the following table:<br>
