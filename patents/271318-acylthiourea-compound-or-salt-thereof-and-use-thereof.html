Acylthiourea Compound or Salt Thereof, and Use Thereof<br>
Field of the Invention [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a novel acylthiourea compound or a salt thereof, and to use thereof.<br>
Background of the Invention [0002]<br>
The enzyme c-Met is a receptor tyrosine kinase identified as a proto-oncogene and exhibits its physiological function when bound to HGF serving as a ligand. In normal tissues, c-Met plays a role in regeneration, wound healing, and organ formation. However, in many cancer cells {kidney cell cancer, stomach cancer, lung cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, liver cell cancer, head and neck cancer, melanoma, etc.), occurrence of over-expression, mutation, or translocation of c-Met is promoted, leading to an excessively activated state (Non-Patent Document 1). Under such conditions, c-Met plays a role in cell proliferation, infiltration/metastasis, tumorigenesis, neovascularization, and anti-apoptosis (see, Non-Patent Documents 2, 3, and 4). In addition, many studies have revealed that over-expression and elevation in activation level of c-Met in cancer cells are negatively correlated to<br><br>
prognosis, and c-Met is known to be a factor associated with a poor prognosis of cancer (see Non-Patent Documents 5 and 6). [0003]<br>
Therefore, if a drug which specifically inhibits c-Met in cancer/tumor cells in which c-Met is activated through over-expression is administered, proliferation, infiltration, and metastasis of cancer cells would be inhibited more specifically and intensively, whereby the drug is expected to contribute to the treatment of cancer, prolongation of the life of patients, and enhancement in QOL. Meanwhile, in actual therapy, since the expression level and activation level of c-Met serve as indices for stratification of patients, the patients can receive appropriate therapy, which is highly preferred from an ethical viewpoint. [0004]<br>
Hitherto, there has been widely studied use of acylthiourea compounds as pharmaceutical agents or other agents (see, for example, Patent Documents 1 to 7). However, there has never been reported the acylthiourea compound of the present invention represented by formula (I), the compound having an aminocarbonyl group serving as a 6-position substituent of the quinoline ring and an alkoxy group serving as a 7-position substituent of the quinoline ring.<br>

Summary of the Invention Problems to be Solved by the Invention [0005]<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide an antitumor agent which exhibits excellent c-Met inhibitory effect and which mitigates side effects by virtue of selectively damaging to tumor cells in which c-Met is specifically expressed.<br>
Means for Solving the Problems<br>
[0006]<br>
The present inventors have carried out extensive studies in order to solve the aforementioned problem, and have found that, as compared with conventional compounds which have a c-Met inhibitory effect, an acylthiourea compound of the present invention represented by formula (I), the compound having an aminocarbonyl group serving as a 6-position substituent of the quinoline ring and an alkoxy group serving as a 7-position substituent of the quinoline ring, (1) has a c-Met inhibitory effect equivalent to or higher than that of the conventional compounds in in vitro studies, (2) exhibits higher selective damage to tumor cells in which c-Met is over-expressed or highly activated, as compared with tumor cells in which c-Met is expressed at low level and normal cells, and (3) mitigates side effects and exhibits potent tumor-regression in in vivo  studies using xenograft models.  In other words, the inventors have found that the acylthiourea compound represented by formula (I), which selectively acts on tumor cells in which c-Met is specifically expressed, mitigates side effects and is useful as an excellent antitumor agent. The present invention has been accomplished on the basis of this finding.<br>
[0007]<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an acylthiourea compound represented by formula {I):<br>
[0008]<br>
[F1]<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
[0009]<br>
(wherein each of R1 and R2, which may be the same or different, represents a hydrogen atom, an optionally substituted C1-6 alkyl group, an optionally substituted C3-10 cycloalkyl group, an optionally substituted C6-14 aromatic hydrocarbon group, or an optionally substituted saturated or unsaturated heterocyclic group, or R1 and R2 may form, together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, an optionally substituted nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring;<br>
R3 represents a C1-6 alkyl group; and<br>
each of R4, R5, and R6, which may be identical to or different from One another, represents a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, an optionally substituted C1-6 alkyl group, a C1-6 alkoxy group, a C1-6 alkylamino group, an optionally substituted aromatic hydrocarbon group, or an optionally substituted saturated or unsaturated heterocyclic group, or R5 and R6 may form a ring together with the phenyl ring to which they are attached) or a salt thereof.<br>
The present invention also provides a pharmaceutical agent containing, as an active ingredient, an acylthiourea<br>
compound represented by formula (I) or a salt thereof.<br>
The present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising an acylthiourea compound represented by formula (I) or a salt thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
The present invention also provides use of an acylthiourea compound represented by formula (I) or a salt thereof for producing an antitumor agent.<br>
The present invention also provides a method for treating cancer, comprising administering, to a subject in need thereof, an effective amount of an acylthiourea compound represented by formula (I) or a salt thereof.<br>
Effects of the Invention [0010]<br>
Patent Document 6 discloses a compound similar to the compound of the present invention, the disclosed compound having a quinoline ring and an acylthiourea structure. However, Patent Document 6 discloses no such a compound having an aminocarbonyl group as a 6-position substituent of the quinoline ring, which substituent is a characteristic feature of the present invention. As shown in the Test Examples described hereinbelow, the compound of the present invention, characterized by having an aminocarbonyl group as a 6-position substituent of the quinoline ring, exhibits in in vitro tests an inhibitory activity to c-Met kinase equivalent to or higher than that of the similar compound<br>
disclosed in Patent Document 6 (comparative compound 1). However, quite surprisingly, when administered at a dose at which comparative compound 1 would be toxic, the compound of the present invention exhibited no toxicity (i.e., loss of body weight) . Therefore, the dose of the compound can be increased, and a potent tumor reducing effect was observed in nude mice subjected to in vivo tests. [0011]<br>
As described above, the compound (I) of the present invention or a salt thereof has an excellent c-Met inhibitory action in in vitro tests, the c-Met inhibitory action having high selectivity to tumor cells in which c-Met is specifically expressed, and exhibits potent tumor reducing effect in in vivo tests. Thus, the compound of the invention is a useful antitumor agent mitigating side effects.<br>
Diseases treated through administration of a drug containing the compound of the present invention include, for example, malignant tumors such as head and neck cancer, esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, colon cancer, rectal cancer, liver cancer, gallbladder/bile duct cancer, biliary tract cancer, pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, uterine cancer, kidney cancer, bladder cancer, prostate cancer, testicular tumor, bone and soft tissue sarcoma, leukemia, malignant lymphoma, multiple myeloma, skin cancer, brain tumor, and mesothelioma. In addition, the compound of the invention is particularly effective for treatment of proliferative diseases involving<br>
differentiation induction and proliferation of cells (e.g., proliferative and immunologic malignant skin diseases involving cornification or inflammation such as psoriasis); is useful as immunosuppressor in the treatment of immunologic diseases such as rheumatism; and in transplant of organs.<br>

Test Example 1 c-Met inhibitory activity determination test (in  vitro)<br>
Inhibitory activity of compounds against c-Met kinase was determined through the following procedures. Method A) c-Met inhibitory assay using AlphaScreen™<br>
A biotinylated peptide including a phosphorylated site of Pyk2 (Tyr402)/ which is reported as a bio-substrate in Clin. Cancer Res. vol. 8, (2), pp. 620-7 (2002), was employed as a substrate. In the presence of the compound of the present invention, the substrate, c-Met {08-051, Carna bio<br>
Co., Ltd), and ATP {final concentration: 20 ^M) were added to a reaction buffer {60 mM HEPES (pH: 7.5), 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM<br>
MnCl2, 3 (iM Na3V04, and 1.25 mM DTT) . The mixture was allowed to react at room temperature for 20 minutes. EDTA was added to the reaction mixture to a final concentration of 50 mM, to thereby terminate reaction. A detection liquid, which had been prepared by protocol of AlphaScreen™ Phosphotyrosine<br>
(P-Tyr-100) Assay Kit (phosphotyrosine-recognizing antibody-bound, 6760620C, Perkin Elmer), was added to the reaction mixture. The reaction was done for one hour at room temperature. Thereafter, the fluorescence intensity from the reaction mixture was measured using a multi-label counter<br>
(Envision™, Perkin Elmer). The compound concentration that realizes 50% inhibition of formation of phosphorylated<br>
product was defined as IC50 (|^M) , and the results are shown in the following Tables.<br>
[0187] Method B) c-Met inhibitory assay using DeskTop Profiler<br>
A dephosphorylation enzyme inhibitor cocktail (PhosSTOP, #4906837, product of Roche) and a protease inhibitor cocktail<br>
(Complete, Mini, EDTA-free, #1836170; product of Roche) were added to a reaction buffer (100 mM HEPES {pH: 7.5), 10 mM<br>
MgCl2, 0.003% Brij-35, 0.04% Tween, and 1 mM DTT).  In the presence of the compound of the present invention, recombinant c-Met (purified product of Taiho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.), fluorescence-labeled c-Met substrate peptide (FL-Peptide 2, #760346, Caliper Life Sciences) {final<br>
concentration: 1.5 uM), and ATP (final concentration: 43 uM) were added thereto, and the mixture was allowed to react at<br>
28°C for 90 minutes. EDTA was added to the reaction mixture to a final concentration of 10 mM, to thereby terminate reaction. By use of DeskTop Profiler (#119900, Caliper Life Sciences), each fluorescence intensity of the substrate and that of the phosphorylated product was determined, whereby the amount of the formed phosphorylated product was determined. The compound concentration that realizes 50% inhibition of formation of phosphorylated product was defined<br>
as IC50 (uM), and the results are shown in the following Tables. [0188]<br>

Cell-proliferation inhibitory assay against NUGC4 cells (human gastric cancer cell strain in which c-Met is over-expressed and highly activated), in vitro  test<br>
NUGC4 cell suspension (in a 10% FBS-containing RPMI 1640 medium (product of Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd.) or a FBS-containing DMEM medium (product of Nacalai Tesque, Inc.)) was inoculated to each well of a 96-well (flat-bottom)<br>
microplate in an amount of 2xio3 cells (0.1 mL) , and the plate was incubated in an incubator under 5% C02 gas atmosphere at 37°C for one day. Each of the compounds of the present invention and comparative compound 1 was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide to a concentration of 3 0 mM. The solution was diluted with 10% FBS-containing RPMI 1640 or DMEM medium, to a final test compound concentration of 60, 20, 6, 2, 0.6, or 0.2 fiM. The thus-prepared test compound solution was added to each well of the NUGC4 cell culture plate at 0.1<br>
mL/well, and the plate was incubated in an incubator under 5%<br>
C02 gas atmosphere at 37°C for 3 days. After culturing, 25% aqueous glutaraldehyde solution (product of Nacalai Tesque,<br>
Inc.) was added to each well at 20 µl, and the plate was left to stand at room temperature for 20 minutes, whereby cells were fixed. Thereafter, the plate was washed with tap water and dried. Then, aqueous 0.05% Crystal Violet/20% methanol solution (product of Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd.) was<br>
added to each well at 100 |uL/well, and the plate was left to stand at room temperature for 2 0 minutes, whereby cells were stained. Thereafter, the plate was washed with tap water and dried. To each well, 0.05 M NaH2P04/ethanol (l/l=v/v) (100<br>
uL) was added, to thereby extract Crystal Violet. The absorbance of the extracted Crystal Violet was measured at 540 nm using a microplate reader, and the absorbance was employed as an index for living cell count. Percent inhibition was calculated by the following equation, and the<br>
50% inhibition test compound concentration (ICS0 (|uM) ) was calculated.<br>
Percent inhibition (%) = (C-T)/Cxl00 T: Absorbance of well to which a test compound was added C: Absorbance of well to which no test compound was added [0193]<br>

[0194]<br>
As apparent from Table 4, the compound of the present invention exhibited cell proliferation inhibitory activity-higher than that of comparative compound 1, against NUGC4<br>
(human gastric cancer cell strain in which c-Met is over-expressed and highly activated). Thus, the compound of the present invention has been confirmed to exhibit excellent antitumor activity.<br>
The same in vitro  cell proliferation inhibition test was performed against c-Met low expressing tumor cells (HCT-116), normal cells (HAOSMC {human aortic smooth muscle cell)), and normal cells (HMEC (human skin microvascular endothelial cell)) . Comparative compound 1 exhibited an IC50 of 15 to 24 (iM to these cell strains, whereas most of the compounds of<br>
the present invention exhibited an ICS0 of &gt;3Q uM. Therefore, the compounds of the invention have been confirmed to exhibit a cell proliferation inhibitory activity which is equal to or lower than that of comparative compound 1, against c-Met low expressing cell strains. In other words, as compared with comparative compound 1, the difference (ratio) between IC50 of the compound of the present invention against c-Met low expressing cells or normal cells and that against c-Met over-expressing cancer cells is considerably large. Based on this finding, the compound of the present invention has been confirmed to exhibit cell proliferation inhibitory activity with high cell specificity. [0195]<br>
Test Example 3<br>
Dose determination study for evaluation of antitumor effect (in vivo)<br>
In order to determine the dose for the evaluation of antitumor effect, each of the compounds of the present invention and comparative compound 1 was perorally administered to nude mice (n = 3 to 5/group) for 14 continuous days {once a day). The maximum tolerated dose was calculated based on the change in body weight of the mice.<br>
During the administration period, percent body weight change of mice (BWC%) was calculated. When a &gt;10% reduction in mean BWC was observed in a compound-administration group, the dose in that case was determined as a drug-toxicity expression dose. Thus, the half value of the toxicity<br>
expression dose was decided as a maximum tolerated dose.<br>
BWC of mice was calculated by the following equation, and the change in mean BWC of each group during the administration period is shown in Fig. 1.<br>
BWC (%)=([(body weight of mouse on the day of weight measurement)—(body weight of mouse at grouping)]/(body weight<br>
of mouse at grouping))x100 [0196]<br>
As apparent from Fig. 1, no decrease in body weight was observed in the comparative compound 1-administration (100 mg/kg) group during the administration period, but a &gt;10% decrease in BWC was observed in the comparative compound 1-administration (200 mg/kg) group. Thus, the toxicity expression dose of comparative compound 1 was determined as 200 mg/kg, and the maximum tolerated dose was determined as 100 mg/kg. In Test Example 4 {evaluation of antitumor effect), the dose of comparative compound 1 was set to 100 mg/kg.<br>
Meanwhile, no body weight loss was observed in the group administered the compound of the present invention (200 mg/kg). Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 1, no body weight loss was observed in the administration (400 mg/kg) group. Thus, the dose of the compound of the present invention was set to 400 mg/kg in Test Example 4 (evaluation of antitumor effect). [0197]<br>
Test Example 4 Evaluation of antitumor effect against subcutaneously<br>
xenograft models using human gastric cancer strain (NUGC4) (in vivo)<br>
Human gastric cancer cells (NUGC4) (obtained from ATCC) were subcutaneously transplanted to nude mice. When the tumor volume of tumor-formed nude mice reached about 100 to about 300 mm3, the mice were allocated into groups (5 or 6/group) by stratified randomized allocation such that the mean tumor volumes of each group were equalized (day 1). Each of the compounds of the present invention and comparative compound 1 was perorally administered once a day for 14 continuous days.<br>
Based on the results of Test Example 3, the dose of comparative compound 1 was adjusted to 100 mg/kg/day, which is the maximum tolerated dose during the 14-day administration period of Test Example 4 (i.e., a maximum dose which results in a 
In order to compare time-dependent changes in tumor proliferation profile among administered test compounds, the relative tumor volume (RTV) in comparison with a tumor volume at the time of allocation was calculated by the following equation. The changes in mean RTV of each group are shown in Fig. 2.<br>
RTV = {tumor volume on the day of tumor volume measurement)/{tumor volume at allocation)<br>
In the case where the mean RTV of an invention<br>
compound-administered group on the final evaluation day was smaller than that of the comparative compound 1-administration group and exhibited a statistical significance {Student-t test), the compound of the present invention was found to be significantly more effective than comparative compound 1, In Fig. 2, a statistical significance is marked with *. [0198]<br>
As apparent from Fig. 2, the compound of the present invention induces potent tumor reduction within one week from the start of administration, exhibiting more significant antitumor effect than that of comparative compound 1. [0199]<br>
As described hereinabove, the compound of the present invention exhibited a c-Met inhibitory effect which is equal to or higher than that of comparative compound 1 (Test Example 1), and exhibited excellent specificity in cell proliferation inhibitory effect (Test Example 2), indicating that the toxicity to non-targeted cells including normal cells is little. In the dose determination test employing nude mice, the compound of the present invention exhibited no decrease in body weight, even when it was administered at a dose of 400 mg/kg, which is higher than the toxicity expression dose (200 mg/kg) of comparative compound 1, indicating that the compound of the invention had low toxicity (Test Example 3). In addition, the compound of the present invention realized administration at a high dose (400<br>
mg/kg), which is greatly higher than the maximum tolerated dose {100 mg/kg) of comparative compound 1. Thus, the compound of the invention exhibited excellent tumor regression (antitumor effect) (Test Example 4).<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
