WASHING MACHINE<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a construction of a washing machine that cleanses, rinses and dehydrates clothes.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
A<br>
 structure of a conventional washing machine is described with reference to/the accompanying Fig. 6 and Fig. 7.<br>
Fig. 6 is a cross sectional view of the conventional washing machine, and Fig. 7 is a cross sectional view of an essential part of the same machine.<br>
In Fig. 6, body 101 of a washing machine has water tub 103 supported by suspension 102. In water tub 103, cleansing basket 104 doubling as a spin dryer (hereinafter referred to as basket 104) is installed rotatably. Basket 104 has a top opening, through which articles to be cleansed are loaded. On a bottom section of basket 104, agitator 105 (pulsator) is equipped rotatably. Basket 104 has numerous small holes on a side-wall.<br>
In Fig. 7, basket 104 is fixed to dryer shaft 107 journaled by bearing 106 disposed at a lower part of water tub 103. Agitator 105 is fixed at a first end of washing shaft 109 journaled by bearing 108 within hollow-dryer-shaft 107. A second end of washing shaft 109 is coupled with an output side of speed reduction mechanism 110.<br>
Motor bracket 111 is made of metal and shapes as a cup. Bracket 111 has an opening facing downwardly and is mounted to metal housing 112 of speed reduction mechanism 110. Stator 114 of motor 115 is press-fitted in an inner wall of bracket 111.    Motor 115 comprises rotor 113 and stator 114<br><br>
2<br>
facing with each other via an annular space in-between. Rotating magnetic field generated by stator 114 rotates rotor 113. Speed reduction mechanism 110 is aligned with motor 115 on the same axial line.<br>
Rotor 113 is constructed by rotor member 116 shaping as a cylinder with a bottom plate and magnet 117 affixed on rotor member 116. Rotor member 116 has an engaging hole 118 at the center of its bottom plate. Input shaft 119 of speed reduction mechanism 110 is engaged with hole 118.<br>
Clutch 120 transmits the rotating force of motor 115 either to dryer shaft 107 or to washing shaft 109 by switching. Clutch 120 comprises the following two elements: (a) clutch spring 180 disposed in a space provided in rotor 113 and (b) clutch driver 185 disposed outside bracket 111 for driving spring 180.<br>
The conventional washing machine having the construction discussed above operates as follows:<br>
In the cleansing and rinsing steps, clutch driver 185 releases clutch spring 180 so that the rotating force of motor 115 does not travel to dryer shaft 107. The rotating force of motor 115 travels only to agitator 105 via washing shaft 109, which provides the laundry with mechanical force. The laundry loaded in basket 104 thus undergoes the cleansing and rinsing steps.<br>
After the washing process, dehydrating step starts. In the dehydrating step, first, the water in basket 104 is discharged, and clutch driver 185 urges clutch spring 180 so that dryer shaft 107 is ready to receive the rotating force of motor 115. In other words, input shaft 119 of the speed reduction mechanism is linked with dryer shaft 107 by clutch spring 180 so that the rotating force of motor 115 is transmitted to basket 104 via dryer shaft 107.    Basket 104 is thus spun.<br>
The centrifugal force due to spinning of basket 104 extracts the water<br><br>
3<br>
contained in the laundry through the numerous holes punched on the side-wall of basket 104 to water tub 103.    The laundry is thus dehydrated.<br>
As such, the laundry automatically undergoes the steps of cleansing, rinsing and dehydrating.<br>
The conventional construction discussed above, however, has the following problem: Stator 114 is press-fitted into metal bracket 111, which is mounted to metal housing 112. If electrical insulation between stator 114 and the coil (not shown) winding around stator 114 deteriorates, the coil becomes conductive with speed reduction mechanism 110 via bracket 111, which degrades safety of the washing machine. <br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention addresses the problem discussed above, and aims to provide a washing machine where even if electrical insulation between a stator and its coil deteriorates, insulation between the coil and a speed reduction mechanism is still maintained so that safety of the washing machined is secured.<br>
The   washing   machine   of the   present   invention  comprises   the following elements:<br>
(a)	a dryer shaft for spinning a basket doubling as a washing basket<br>
and a spin-drying basket;<br>
(b)	a washing shaft for spinning an agitator disposed in the basket,<br>
and disposed on the same axial line of the dryer shaft;<br>
(c)	a motor for driving the dryer shaft and the washing shaft;<br>
(d)	a speed reduction mechanism for reducing a driving speed of the<br>
motor and then rotating the washing shaft;<br>
(e)	a clutch for switching the transmission of the motor driving force<br><br>
4<br>
either to the dryer shaft or to the washing shaft.<br>
The speed reduction mechanism is aligned with the motor on the same axial line via an insulator.<br>
This construction allows the insulation between the coil and the speed reduction mechanism to be still maintained even if the electrical insulation between the stator and its coil deteriorates, so that the washing machine of the present invention can secure the safety.<br>

Detailed Description of the Exemplary Embodiments Exemplary   embodiments   of  the   present   invention   are   described<br>
hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
(Exemplary Embodiment 1)<br>
Fig. 1 is a cross section of an essential part of a washing machine in<br><br>
5<br>
accordance with the first exemplary embodiment of the present invention, and Fig. 2 is a cross section of the same washing machine.<br>
In Fig. 2, body 21 of the washing machine includes therein water tub 23 supported by suspension 22 to prevent vibration in a dehydrating step. In tub 23, basket 24 doubling as a washing basket and a spin-drying basket is rotatably disposed. On the inner bottom of basket 24, agitator 25 for agitating laundry is disposed rotatably.<br>
Basket 24 is fixed to an upper end of dryer shaft 27 journaled by bearing 26 disposed under water tub 23, as shown in Fig. 1. In hollow-dryer-shaft 27, washing shaft 29 journaled by bearing 28 disposed also in hollow-dryer-shaft 27 is placed on the same axis of shaft 27. Agitator 25 is mounted to an upper end of washing shaft 29.<br>
A lower end of washing shaft 29 is coupled to an output side of speed reduction mechanism 30, and input shaft 35 of the speed reduction mechanism is fixed at the input side thereof.<br>
Motor bracket 31 made of metal e.g. iron plate, shapes as a cup, and its opening faces downwardly. Motor bracket 31 is mounted to speed reduction mechanism 30 located on an upper section of motor bracket 31. Stator 33 providing rotor 32 with rotational magnetic field is press-fitted into an inner wall of bracket 31. Motor 34 comprises stator 33 and rotor 32 facing each other via an annular space in-between. Input shaft 35 of the speed reduction mechanism is mounted to rotor 32, and speed reduction mechanism 30 is aligned with motor 34 on the same axial line.<br>
Rotor 32 includes first rotor member 37 to which magnet 36 is fixed, and second rotor member 38 fixed to shaft 35. First and second rotor members 37 and 38 are spaced in-between, and are integrated by resin 39. In other words, resin 39 insulates rotor members 37 from 38 by existing itself<br><br>
6<br>
in-between.<br>
Rotor bracket 31 includes cylindrical flange 70 at an approximate center of motor 34 in its axial direction. Bracket 31 and flange 70 are integrated by resin to form an insulator 40, which has an engaging hole 41 at an approximate center of motor 34 in its axial direction. Cylindrical section 43 of metal housing 42, one of elements of speed reduction mechanism 30, is engaged with hole 41.<br>
A plurality of burr-holes 44 are provided on housing 42. Reinforcing plate 45 is placed on insulator 40 which has been formed on motor 34.    Screw<br>
46	is extended through holes provided on both plates 45 and insulator 40.<br>
Screw 46 is mated into burr-hole 44 so that motor 34 is screwed to housing 42<br>
via insulator 40.    Motor 34 is thus aligned with speed reduction mechanism<br>
30 on the same axial line.<br>
Clutch 47 transmits the motor rotation to either dryer shaft 27 or washing shaft 29 by switching.    Clutch 47 comprises the following elements:<br>
(a)	clutch boss 82;<br>
(b)	clutch spring 80; and<br>
(c)	sleeve 84 for transmitting the force of a clutch driver 85 to clutch spring<br>
80 for driving the clutch 47.    Input shaft 35 shows a circle in its cross<br>
sectional view,  and a tip  section thereof is sided by shaving to form a<br>
quadrilateral so that clutch boss 82 having a hole mating with the shaved<br>
section is fixed to shaft 35.    A first end of clutch spring 80 winds around<br>
clutch boss 82 and a second end thereof winds around dryer shaft 27.    Clutch<br>
47	is disposed within motor bracket 31.<br>
Clutch driver 85 comprises the following elements:<br>
(a)	clutch claw 86;<br>
(b)	clutch lever 52;<br><br>
7<br>
(c)	clutch switcher (not shown) including, e.g. a geared motor for<br>
rotating clutch lever 52; and<br>
(d)	clutch lever spring 88.<br>
Motor bracket 31 is provided with hole 89, and clutch lever 52 is inserted into hole 89. Clutch switcher drives clutch driver 85 from outside so that clutch lever 52 can rotate. Motor cover 48 covers a lower opening of bracket 31.<br>
The washing machine including the construction discussed above in accordance with the first exemplary embodiment works as follows:<br>
In the cleansing and rinsing steps, clutch driver 85 releases spring 80 so that rotational force does not travel to dryer shaft 27. In other words, clutch lever spring 88 urges claw 86 to be engaged with sleeve 84 and to loosen clutch spring 80. As a result, slipping occurs between spring 80 and boss 82. The rotating force of motor 34 is thus shut off from being transmitted to dryer shaft 27, and only travels to agitator 25 via washing shaft 29, which provides the laundry with mechanical force. The laundry in basket 24 thus undergoes the cleansing and rinsing steps.<br>
After the cleansing and rinsing steps, spin-drying is taken place. In the spin-drying step, the clutch switcher rotates clutch lever 52 so that claw 86 comes off from sleeve 84, and spring 80 winds around boss 82. Then shaft 35 is coupled with dryer shaft 27 so that the rotating force of motor 34 travels to dryer shaft 27.   Basket 24 mounted to dryer shaft 27 is then rotated.<br>
Water contained in the laundry is extracted through numerous holes punched on a side-wall of basket 24 into water tub 23 due to centrifugal force generated by spinning of basket 24. The laundry is thus automatically dehydrated. As such, the laundry loaded into basket 24 automatically undergoes respective steps of cleansing, rinsing and dehydrating.<br><br>
8<br>
The specific structures utilized in this embodiment produce the following advantages: Washing shaft 29 and dryer shaft 27 are concentrically placed because of the hollow structure of dryer shaft 27. Speed reduction mechanism 30, clutch 47 and motor 34 are placed in this order from agitator 25. They are aligned on the same axial line so that motor 34 and speed reduction mechanism 30 are integrated, and the center of gravity of motor 34 and speed reduction mechanism 30 is located on the center line of basket 24 and water tub 23. This structure thus becomes free from unbalance, and can effectively restrain the vibration particularly in the dehydrating step.<br>
Since motor 34 is disposed to speed reduction mechanism 30 via insulator 40, insulation between motor 34 and speed reduction mechanism 30 can be secured due to insulator 40 even if the insulation between stator 33 and coil 75 winding around stator 33 deteriorates. As a result, safety of the washing machine can be improved.<br>
Insulator 40 is formed by integrating bracket 31 with resin, and motor 34 is mounted to speed reduction mechanism 30 via insulator 40. This structure strengthens insulator 40 and improves the assembling efficiency.<br>
Insulator 40 has an engaging hole 41 at an approximate center of motor 34 in its axial direction, and this hole 41 is engaged with cylindrical section 43 of housing 42, one of elements of speed reduction mechanism 30. This structure allows the aligning of the axial direction of the motor and the axial direction of speed reduction mechanism 30 to be achieved with ease and accuracy. Further, this structure allows the annular space between stator 33 and rotor 32 to have a constant width with more accuracy. As a result, motor 34 operates more efficiently, and magnetic flux between stator 33 and rotor 32 becomes uniform, which enables rotor 32 to spin smoothly. Abnormal noises of the motor can be thus prevented.<br><br>
9<br>
Bracket 31 has cylindrical flange 70 at an approximate center of motor 34 in its axial direction. Bracket 31 integrates flange 70 with resin to form insulator 40, which is engaged with cylindrical section 43 so that insulator 40 of bracket 31 can be fit into cylinder section 43. As a result, motor 34 and speed reduction mechanism 30 become stronger against the load in the radial direction.<br>
A plurality of burr-holes 44 are provided on housing 42, and screws 46 which extend through donut-shaped reinforcing plates 45 and insulator 40, mate burr-holes 44 so that motor 34 is screwed to housing 42. As a result, motor 34 is fixedly secured to housing 42, which contributes to improving the durability of the washing machine.<br>
If the insulation between magnet 36 and coil 75 somehow deteriorates, rotor members 37 and 38 can be still insulated because of the presence of resin 39 in-between. This structure secures the insulation between coil 75 and shaft 35, which prevents electric leakage from coil 75, to which a high voltage is applied, to speed reduction mechanism 30, dryer shaft 27 and washing shaft<br>
29.	As a result, the washing machine with extreme safety can be achieved.<br>
(Exemplary Embodiment 2)<br>
Fig. 3 is a cross section of an essential part of a washing machine in accordance with the second exemplary embodiment of the present invention. In Fig. 3, housing 49, one of elements constituting speed reduction mechanism<br>
30,	is provided with a plurality of holes 90.    Reinforcing plate 50 shaping as<br>
donut-like is also provided with a plurality of holes 93.    Motor bracket 31 is<br>
integrated with resin to form insulator 51, of which upper and lower sections<br>
are provided with ribs 95.    Ribs 95 are mated with holes 90 of housing 49 and<br>
holes 93 of plate 50 so that both are positioned.<br><br>
10<br>
Other structures are the same as the first exemplary embodiment. Bracket 31 is provided with hole 89 through which clutch lever 52 of clutch driver 85 extends so that lever 52 can rotate.<br>
The structure discussed above allows the positioning between speed reduction mechanism 30 and motor 34 as well as between motor 34 and reinforcing plates 50 to be established with ease. As a result, the assembling efficiency can be improved.<br>
(Exemplary Embodiment 3)<br>
Fig. 4 is a cross section of an essential part of a washing machine in accordance with the third exemplary embodiment of the present invention. In Fig. 4, clutch driver 85 includes clutch lever 52 that drives clutch driver 85. Lever 52 extends through hole 89 provided on insulator 53 that is integrated by motor bracket 31 with resin. Other structures are the same as the first exemplary embodiment.<br>
The structure discussed above allows lever 52 rotates free from contact to metal section of bracket 31, when the rotating force of motor is switched either to washing shaft 29 or dryer shaft 27. Therefore, a chance of electric leakage through lever 52 can be eliminated, even if insulation between stator 33 and coil 75 somehow deteriorates. As a result, the washing machine can be used in the safety circumstances.<br>
(Exemplary Embodiment 4)<br>
Fig. 5 is a cross section of an essential part of a washing machine in accordance with the fourth exemplary embodiment of the present invention. In Fig. 5, rotation detector 54 detects the rotation of motor 34, and includes Hall IC 56 at connector 55 of detector 54.    Hall IC 56 is mounted to be<br><br>
11<br>
opposite to magnet 36 of rotor 32 so that Hall IC 56 can detect changes in magnetic flux of magnet 36 due to the rotation of rotor 32. Detector 54 can thus detect the rotation of motor 34.    Detector 54 is provided with rib 57.<br>
Insulator 58 integrates motor bracket 31 with resin. Insulator 58 is provided with hole 59 for receiving rotation detector 54 and recess 60. Rib 57 of detector 54 is mated with recess 60 for positioning detector 54. Other structures are the same as the first exemplary embodiment.<br>
Since the mounting hole 59 for detector 54 is provided on insulator 58 formed to bracket 31, the structure discussed above prevents rotation detector 54 from being conductive with bracket 31 even if the insulation of detector 54 deteriorates. As a result, the washing machine can be used in the safety circumferences.<br>
Since rib 57 is provided on detector 54, and rib 57 is mated with recess 60 of insulator 58 for positioning detector 54, detector 54 is mounted to motor 34 with more accurate positioning. As a result, an accuracy of detector 54 can be improved.<br>
As discussed above, a washing machine of the present invention comprises the following elements:<br>
(a)	a dryer shaft for spinning a basket doubling as a washing basket<br>
and a spin-drying basket;<br>
(b)	a washing shaft for spinning an agitator disposed in the basket,<br>

motor to spin the washing shaft; and<br>
(e)	a clutch for transmitting the rotating force of the motor either to<br><br>
12<br>
the dryer shaft or the washing shaft by switching.<br>
The speed reduction mechanism and the motor are aligned on the same axial line via an insulator. The insulation between the motor and the speed reduction mechanism can be secured due to the presence of the insulator in-between, even if the insulation between a stator and a stator coil deteriorates. As a result, a washing machine with more safety and better assembling efficiency can be provided.<br><br>
