				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to laser shock peening of a part and to a tape,<br>
which includes an ablative medium for producing localized compressive residual<br>
stresses in the part.<br>
Laser shock peening (LSP) is a process for producing a region of deep<br>
compressive residual stresses over a surface area of a work piece such as a part of a<br>
turbine engine. Laser shock peening typically uses multiple radiation pulses from<br>
high power lasers. The pulses or "hits" produce shock waves on the part surface. The<br>
part surface is generally coated with a paint or tape, which functions as an ablation<br>
material. Some amount of the ablation material vaporizes from contact with the laser<br>
beam. The rapid vaporization produces a shock wave which travels into the metal,<br>
creating compressive residual stress through plastic deformation. A confining<br>
medium can be employed to direct the shock waves into the part. The confining<br>
medium comprises a transparent layer of material such as a transparent plastic or a<br>
curtain of water. The LSP process creates compressive stresses in the part, which<br>
considerably increase resistance to fatigue failure.<br>
Ablative tapes have been developed to provide the; LSP ablation<br>
material. The tapes can comprise an adhesive layer on one side of an ablative layer.<br>
However, an ablative tape typically used in an LSP process can degrade during use.<br>
The degradation may be due to repeated pulses of the laser beam to the same tape<br>
area. Degradation of the tape results in "burn spots" and damage to the underlying<br>
part surface. The part can be repeatedly re-taped to prevent same area pulse damage.<br>
However, re-taping is time consuming, labor-intensive and costly.<br><br>
There is need for an LSP tape process that requires decreased retaping.<br>
In addition, there is a need for an improved, resilient ablative tape for use in an LSP<br>
process.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention provides an improved ablative tape that withstands<br>
repeated application of laser pulses. The tape comprises an ablative medium<br>
comprising a polymer and dispersed metallic component.<br>
In an embodiment, the invention relates to a method for treating a<br>
surface of a substrate. In the method, a tape is applied onto a substrate surface. The<br>
ablative tape comprises an ablative medium comprising a polymer and dispersed<br>
metallic component. The tape is then irradiated to ablate the ablative medium.<br>
In another embodiment, the invention relates to an article, comprising<br>
a substrate and an ablative tape applied to the substrate. The ablative tape comprises<br>
a polymer and a dispersed metallic component.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Mannava et al., U.S. Pat. 5,674,328 teaches a method of laser shock<br>
peening a metallic part by firing a laser onto a surface of a work piece such as a<br>
turbine engine part, which has been adhesively covered by a tape having an ablative<br>
medium. The tape can be a self-adhering tape with a confinement medium, ablative<br>
layer and adhesive layer. Continuous movement is provided between the part and the<br>
laser beam while the laser beam is fired in repeated pulses onto the taped surface of<br>
the part. The pulses vaporize the ablative medium to form surface spots having deep<br>
compressive residual stresses that extend below the part surface. A confinement<br>
medium may be used to increase the depth of compressive residual stresses.<br>
The present invention relates to an improved ablative medium for a<br>
tape that can be used in Mannava et al. and other LSP processes. The medium has an<br>
improved robustness that advantageously accommodates multiple overlapping LSP<br>
laser hits to the same area. Typical prior art media can withstand one hit (1X) or two<br>
hits (2X) at the most to the same area. As a result, a sequence of shocks must be<br>
carefully controlled or the part must be repeatedly retaped. The medium of the<br>
invention can sustain up to 4X hits and greater without degradation. The improved<br>
robustness of the inventive medium results in a substantial improvement in time,<br>
labor and cost of an LSP process.<br>
These and other features will become apparent from the drawings and<br>
following detailed discussion, which by way of example without limitation describe<br>
preferred embodiments of the present: invention.<br>
FIGs. 1 and 2 illustrate a turbine engine fan blade 8 for laser shock<br>
peening (LSP) process, as embodied by the invention. The fan blade 8 is<br>
representative of various turbine components within the scope of the invention. The<br>
blade 8 forms a substrate for the LSP process. The substrate can be a superalloy,<br>
titanium alloy, steel or the like. As is known, the superalloy may comprise at least<br>
one of nickel-, cobalt-, or iron-based materials.<br><br>
The fan blade 8 is in an as-mounted position in a turbine. The fan<br>
blade 8 comprises an airfoil 34 that extends radially outward from a blade platform 36<br>
to a blade tip 38. The fan blade 8 also comprises a root section 40 that extends<br>
radially inward from platform 36 to a radially inward end 37. A blade root 42 is<br>
connected to the platform 36 by a blade shank 44. The airfoil 34 extends in a<br>
chordwise direction between a leading edge, LE, and trailing edge, TE, of the airfoil<br>
34.<br>
A chord, C, of the airfoil 34 is a line between the leading edge and the<br>
trailing edge at each cross-section, as illustrated in FIG 2. A pressure side 46 of the<br>
airfoil 34 is disposed to generally face a rotation direction, as indicated by arrow V<br>
(FIG. 1). A suction side 48 is disposed on the other side of the airfoil 34. A mean-<br>
line, ML is defined to generally extend midway between faces in a chordwise<br>
direction.<br>
The fan blade 8 further comprises a leading edge section 50, which<br>
extends along the airfoil 34 and the blade platform 36 to the blade tip 38. The leading<br>
edge 50 includes a first width, W1, that comprises nicks 52. Such nicks 52 are<br>
generally formed during use of the fan blade 8. The nicks 52 undesirably act as high<br>
cycle fatigue stress risers, from which cracks can propagate through the fan blade 8.<br>
Crack propagation is due to tensile stress fields generated from centrifugal forces and<br>
vibration during engine operation, which can lead to undesirable turbine component<br>
operation and possible turbine component failure. The pressure side 46 and suction<br>
side 48 comprise laser shock peened surfaces 54. Regions 56 exhibit deep<br>
compressive residual stresses. The regions 56 can be coextensive with the leading<br>
edge section 50 in a chordwise direction with the width W1.<br>
FIG. 3 is a schematic perspective view of the blade of FIG. i taped and<br>
mounted in a laser shock peening system and FIG. 4 is a partial cross-sectional and a<br>
partial schematic view of the setup in FIG. 3. Referring to FIG. 3 and FIG. 4, the fan<br>
blade 8 is shown mounted in a position to effect laser shock peening. The laser shock<br>
peening system comprises a generator 31 having an oscillator and a pre-amplifier, and<br><br>
a beam splitter, which feeds the pre-amplified laser beam into two beam optical<br>
transmission circuits. Each optical transmission circuit may comprise first and<br>
second amplifiers 30 and 32 and appropriate optics 35 to transmit and focus laser<br>
beam 2 onto ablative tape 59.<br>
Ablative tape 59 comprises an ablative medium 61 according to the<br>
invention. The ablative medium 61 comprises a polymer 23 and a dispersed metallic<br>
component 25. "Dispersed" in this application means widely spread through the<br>
polymer and does not necessarily mean (although it includes) finely divided or<br>
colloidal sized particles in the polymer. In fact, the metallic component can be in any<br>
form including in the form of a flake, particle, aggregate, film or layer. For example,<br>
a film with a pigmented plastic backing is excluded from the present invention. The<br>
term "metallic component" comprises metals in elemental form, alloys, molecules,<br>
other suitable metallic forms and combinations thereof with non-metallic<br>
components.<br>
Preferred metallic components are substantially opaque and are<br>
capable of being ionized to a plasma. These pigments include magnesium, calcium,<br>
strontium, zinc, titanium, scandium and other transition metal elements and<br>
compounds. Most preferred are elemental aluminum, aluminum alloys and aluminum<br>
compounds.<br>
The polymer of the ablative medium can comprise a thermoplastic<br>
polymer, such as a polyolefin. Preferably the polymer is a polypropylene,<br>
polyethylene polymer or copolymer thereof.<br>
The metallic component can be provided in the ablative medium in any<br>
amount, for example in an amount up to about 6 weight %. Further, in a preferred<br>
embodiment the ablative medium can additionally comprise carbon in an amount of<br>
not less than about 1 weight %. In one embodiment, the ablative composition<br>
comprises aluminum and carbon. The carbon can be present as a carbon black or<br>
other forms of elemental carbon. In this embodiment, the ablative medium can<br><br>
comprise about 1 to about 15 weight % aluminum and about 1 to about 15 weight %<br>
carbon. Desirably in this embodiment, the medium comprises about 3 to about 10<br>
weight % aluminum and about 3 to about 8 weight % carbon and preferably about 5<br>
to about 8 weight % aluminum and about 4 to about 6 weight % carbon.<br>
Also, a confinement medium 21 and an adhesive 60 can be included<br>
along with the ablative medium 61, as illustrated in FIG. 4. The confinement medium<br>
21 is generally transparent to the laser frequency. The medium provides a<br>
containment of the shock waves upon ablation of the ablative medium 61 by<br>
maintaining high plasma pressures for a period long enough to generate plastic<br>
deformation in the metal. While illustrated as a layer, the confinement medium 21<br>
can comprise a curtain of flowing water or a separate sheet of clear confinement<br>
material. An adhesive 60 can be provided as a component of the ablative tape 59 or<br>
an adhesive can be separately applied to the tape prior to application of the tape to a<br>
part in preparation for LSP. Or an adhesive layer can be separately applied directly<br>
onto the substrate over which the tape is adhered.<br>
The ablative tape 59, as described, has special use as a tape in laser<br>
shock peening (LSP) as described herein, where a same surface area is repeatedly<br>
ablated. The inclusion of the metallic component reduces depth of vaporization and<br>
thinning of tape material that can occur dunng repeated laser shock in the same spot.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 7, a higher percentage of the ablative medium thickness remains<br>
after repeated irradiation by the laser.<br>
The ablative tape 59, as embodied by the invention, can find desirable<br>
applications for use in laser shock peening (LSP) where a same surface area is<br>
repeatedly ablated. The inclusion of metallic elements, such as, but not limited to,<br>
aluminum, and aluminum and carbon, can reduce a depth of vaporization or removal<br>
of the tape material by the laser. In other words, a higher percentage of the tape's<br>
thickness remains after repeated irradiation by a laser<br><br>
Referring again to FIG. 3 and FIG. 4, the laser beam 2 that is used in<br>
the LSP, typically exhibits a peak power density on the order of magnitude of a<br>
gigawatt/cm2. The laser beam 2 can be fired through a transparent confinement<br>
medium, as discussed above, for example through one of a transparent layer and a<br>
curtain of flowing water. The ablative medium will be ablated to generate plasma.<br>
The plasma results in shock waves on the surface of the material. These shock waves<br>
are then redirected toward the underlying substrate by the confinement medium.<br>
Thereafter, the shock waves penetrate the substrate. The amplitude and quantity of<br>
the shock waves can determine the depth and intensity of the residual compressive<br>
stresses. Accordingly, the ablative tape 59 can protect the target surface of the<br>
substrate and assist in the generation of plasma.<br>
FIG. 5 and FIG. 6 show patterns of laser circular spots that represent<br>
several sequences of laser firing. As illustrated, each circular spot 58 possesses a<br>
diameter D. In each row 64 of spots 58 that extend along a row centerline 62, the<br>
spots 58 are spaced apart from each other by a first offset "01". Adjacent rows of<br>
spots 58 are spaced apart from each other by a second offset "02". Further, the firing<br>
sequence of adjacent rows are spaced apart from each other by a third offset "03"<br>
Thus, a pattern of spots 58 covers portions of the ablative tape 59. The pattern of<br>
spots includes areas that may be irradiated two, three or four times. For example,<br>
"A" of FIG. 5 represents an area of the ablative tape 59 that was irradiated four times.<br>
The use of an ablative tape 59, as embodied by the invention, prevents such<br>
repetitively irradiated areas from deterioration.<br>
These and other features will become apparent from the following<br>
detailed discussion, which by way of example without limitation describes preferred<br>
embodiments of the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
Several samples were prepared and irradiated to determine the degree<br>
of penetration of a laser beam. Samples of pigmented ablative media in tape form<br><br>
were made starting with metallic and carbon pigments in commercial form --<br>
concentrates in resin pellets. The concentrates were melted and mixed with molten<br>
pellets of the desired un-pigmented polymer resin using a Brabender mixer. The<br>
polymer was a polypropylene. The ablative tapes were applied onto a substrate and<br>
irradiated. In the LSP procedure, two spots were hit on each sample. One spot was h<br>
4 times, and thus represents about two to four times the severity that a conventional<br>
ablative tape is expected to survive. The other spot was hit until the tape was visuall<br>
judged to have failed, and this number of hits recorded. Compositions and results an<br>
given in TABLE 1.<br><br>
In the TABLE, standard a and standard b are known tapes without<br>
metallic component. The results of the peening processes are summarized in Fig. 7.<br>
FIG. 7 is a chart of remaining tape thickness from the peening operations for the<br>
samples 1-11. The chart shows original tape thickness on the right axis and<br>
remaining tape thickness on the left axis, both in µm.<br>
As indicated, ablative tapes as embodied by the invention, comprising<br>
at least one of aluminum or aluminum and carbon, provide desirable results by<br>
preserving tape thickness. The Example shows that an ablative medium according to<br><br>
the invention is suitable for preventing deterioration of an underlying substrate. The<br>
medium is also durable to repeated laser shocks. The medium prevents deterioration<br>
of the underlying substrate. This allows continuing peening and processing without<br>
requiring re-application of tape.<br>
While preferred embodiments have been described, the present<br>
invention is capable of variation and modification and therefore should not be limited<br>
