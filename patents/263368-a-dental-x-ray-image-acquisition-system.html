METHOD AND DEVICE FOR CONTROLLING THE DURATION OF THE EMISSION OF X-RAYS IN A<br>
DENTAL RADIOLOGY DEVICE<br>
Background of the invention<br>
	The present invention relates to a dental X-ray<br>
image acquisition system, to an X-ray generator, and to a<br>
command module for controlling an intra-oral sensor<br>
suitable for use in such a system.<br>
	In known manner, a dental X-ray image acquisition<br>
system-mainly comprises an X-ray generator and an intra-<br>
oral sensor that is sensitive to said X-rays, and that is<br>
associated with a command module for acquiring the X-ray<br>
image.<br>
	The X-ray generator is required to be fitted with<br>
control means, generally a button, enabling the operator<br>
to trigger the emission of X-rays in manual and<br>
deliberate manner.<br>
	Such an X-ray generator is also fitted with a timer<br>
enabling the operator to set a predetermined duration for<br>
X-ray emission, it being understood that the operator can<br>
also voluntarily stop the emission of X-rays by using the<br>
above-mentioned control means.<br>
	In a first known system, the starting and the end of<br>
acquisition by the sensor are under the control of the<br>
generator.<br>
	In another known system, in particular as described<br>
in US patent No. 5 331 166, X-ray sensitive pellets are<br>
integrated in the intra-oral sensor, said pellets being<br>
adapted to send a signal to the command module of the<br>
sensor which controls the starting and the stopping of<br>
digital image acquisition as a function of the intensity<br>
of said signal.<br>
	Also known, in particular from the disclosure of US<br>
patent No. 5 694 448, is an imaging system in which the<br>
output level from a charge-coupled device (CCD) sensor is<br>
continuously monitored so as to detect when the generator<br>
is emitting X-rays, i.e. whenever said level becomes<br><br>
2<br>
greater than a noise level. When such emission is<br>
detected, image acquisition proper is performed.<br>
	Given that the CCD sensor is read and emptied<br>
continuously in cyclical manner, in order to make a<br>
comparison with the noise level, a most unfavorable<br>
circumstance can arise during which no image is acquired<br>
even though X-rays have begun to be emitted by the<br>
generator.<br>
	In practice, 10% to 20% of the X-rays emitted by the<br>
generator can be lost in this way, and that is naturally<br>
harmful to the patient.<br>
	To sum up, none of the above-mentioned prior art<br>
systems is capable of optimizing the quantity of X-rays<br>
received by the patient since the practitioner can adjust<br>
the timer in intuitive manner only. In practice,<br>
practitioners prefer to use an overdose of X-rays in<br>
order to be sure of obtaining an image of good quality.<br>
Object and summary of the invention<br>
A main object of the present invention is thus to<br>
mitigate those drawbacks by proposing a dental X-ray<br>
image acquisition system comprising:<br>
•	an X-ray generator comprising means for triggering<br>
the emission of X-rays, a timer enabling an operator to<br>
set a predetermined duration for X-ray emission, and<br>
means for automatically stopping the emission at the end<br>
of the predetermined duration; and<br>
•	an intra-oral sensor responsive to X-rays,<br>
associated with a sensor command module, and adapted to<br>
acquire the image during said emission. In the system:<br>
•	the module comprises means for sending a command<br>
in application of at least one predetermined criterion to<br>
the generator to prevent, stop, or modify the power of X-<br>
ray emission before the end of the predetermined duration<br>
so as to control the quantity of X-rays emitted by the<br>
generator; and<br><br>
3<br>
• the generator includes means for receiving the<br>
stop command, the means for stopping the generator being<br>
adapted to prevent, stop, or modify the power of the<br>
emission on receiving the command.<br>
Thus, in accordance with the invention, X-rays are<br>
emitted by the generator only while the digital image is<br>
being integrated by the intra-oral sensor.<br>
The invention also provides an X-ray generator and<br>
an intra-oral sensor command module suitable for use in<br>
such a system.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the module<br>
possesses mean for interrupting or preventing X-ray<br>
emission in application of predetermined criterion as<br>
explained below.<br>
Naturally, when none of the criteria is satisfied,<br>
then the emission of X-rays is interrupted by the<br>
generator at the end of the predetermined duration as set<br>
by the operator. It should be observed that such a<br>
generator complies with regulations that merely require<br>
that the emission of X-rays should stop automatically in<br>
a manner that is initially programmed by the operator.<br>
Various conditions or criteria used by the command<br>
module for remotely interrupting or preventing the<br>
emission of X-rays by the generator are described below.<br>
Naturally, these criteria are not exclusive of one<br>
another.<br>
In a first embodiment, the module sends the command<br>
on detecting a malfunction of the intra-oral sensor.<br>
In a second embodiment, the module possesses means<br>
for detecting the type of intra-oral sensor to which it<br>
is connected and means for determining the appropriate<br>
duration for X-ray emission as a function of the sensor<br>
type. The command is then sent to the generator at the<br>
end of said duration.<br>
In a third embodiment, the command module determines<br>
the duration of X-ray emission as a function of the type<br><br>
4<br>
of resolution desired for the X-ray image, and sends the<br>
command to the generator at the end of said duration.<br>
In this embodiment, the command module may obtain<br>
the level of resolution from a remote device, e.g. a<br>
computer. Image resolution may also be programmed in the<br>
module itself.<br>
In a fourth embodiment, the module includes means<br>
for measuring the mean gain of a sequence of previously<br>
acquired images, and means for determining a quantity of<br>
X-ray emission that is adjusted as a function of said<br>
mean gain and as a function of a predetermined desired<br>
gain. In this embodiment, the command is sent to the<br>
generator to modify the quantity of X-rays emitted by the<br>
generator in compliance with said adjusted quantity.<br>
Brief description of the drawing<br>
Other characteristics and advantages of the present<br>
invention appear from the following description given<br>
with reference to accompanying Figure 1 which shows an<br>
embodiment that is not limiting in any way.<br>
Figure 1 is a diagram showing a dental X-ray image<br>
acquisition system 1 in accordance with the invention.<br>
The system 1 includes an X-ray generator 10 in<br>
accordance with the invention in a preferred embodiment.<br>
The X-ray generator 10 comprises an X-ray source 16<br>
and means 14, e.g. a button, for manually triggering or<br>
stopping the emission of X-rays by the source 16.<br>
The generator 10 also comprises a timer 18 enabling<br>
the operator to set a predetermined duration for the<br>
source 16 to emit X-rays.<br>
The generator 10 also has means, e.g. a<br>
microprocessor 12 in combination with the timer 18, for<br>
causing the emission of X-rays to be stopped<br>
automatically at the end of the predetermined duration.<br>
The acquisition system 1 also comprises an intra-<br>
oral sensor 30 that is sensitive to X-rays, e.g. of the<br><br>
5<br>
complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) or CCD<br>
type.<br>
The intra-oral sensor 30 is controlled by a control<br>
module 20 in accordance with the invention and is<br>
connected thereto by a wire 31.<br>
Images acquired by the sensor 30 are also conveyed<br>
by the wire 31 for first processing in the module 20.<br>
In the embodiment described herein, the module 20 is<br>
controlled by a microprocessor 21 adapted in particular<br>
to control the intra-oral sensor 30 and to receive<br>
digital image data coming from said intra-oral sensor via<br>
an inlet/outlet port 23.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the generator 10<br>
and the control module 20 have respective communications<br>
means 18, 22 serving in particular to enable the module<br>
20 to send a command to the generator 10.<br>
In a first variant embodiment, these communications<br>
means 18, 22 are means for wired communication.<br>
In a variant, these communications means may be<br>
constituted by wireless communications means, for example<br>
complying with the Bluetooth standard.<br>
On receiving such a command, the processor 12 of the<br>
generator 10 interrupts the emission of X-rays by the<br>
source 16, or modifies the quantity of X-rays being<br>
emitted.<br>
If the command is received while the source 16 is<br>
inactive, the processor 12 prevents any subsequent<br>
emission of X-rays by said source 16 until the operator<br>
voluntarily takes manual action.<br>
In the preferred embodiment described herein, the<br>
module 20 of the invention includes means 28 for<br>
communicating with an external system 40, e.g.<br>
constituted by a personal computer (PC) type computer.<br>
The personal computer 40 may be used in particular<br>
for displaying the digital images acquired by the intra-<br>
oral sensor 30.<br><br>
6<br>
In the preferred embodiment described herein, the<br>
operator may also use the remote system 40 for selecting<br>
a level of resolution (low resolution LR, high resolution<br>
HR) of the X-ray images acquired by the sensor 30, with<br>
the resolution level LR, HR being received by the control<br>
module 20 via its communications interface 28.<br>
In a variant (not shown) the resolution LR, HR can<br>
be programmed directly in the module 20.<br>
In the preferred embodiment described herein, the<br>
processor 21 of the control module 20 is adapted to<br>
detect a malfunction of the intra-oral sensor 30, e.g. by<br>
reading a register of the inlet/outlet port 23 provided<br>
for this purpose.<br>
On detecting a malfunction, the processor 21 sends<br>
the command to interrupt generating X-rays to the<br>
generator 10 via the communications means 22.<br>
In the preferred embodiment described herein, the<br>
processor 21 is also adapted to determine the type (T1 or<br>
T2) of the intra-oral sensor 30, e.g. by reading a<br>
register provided for this purpose in the inlet/outlet<br>
port 23.<br>
In the preferred embodiment described herein, the<br>
control module 30 has a non-volatile memory 26 in which<br>
there is stored a table T having as many columns as there<br>
are known types Tl, T2 of sensor 30 that might be<br>
controlled by the module 20, and as many rows as there<br>
are possible resolutions LR, HR for the X-ray images<br>
acquired by the sensor.<br>
In this example, the table T has two rows and two<br>
columns.<br>
The table T stores four values for each pair (sensor<br>
type: Tl, T2; and image resolution: HR, LR):<br>
•	a duration Di for X-ray emission by the generator<br>
10 for the corresponding type/resolution pair;<br>
•	a mean gain MGi measured for a previously acquired<br>
image sequence corresponding to said type/resolution<br>
pair;<br><br>
7<br>
• a desired gain Gi for the images acquired by said<br>
type/resolution pair; and<br>
• a step size Si for adjusting the duration Di when<br>
the mean gain MGi is different from the desired gain Gi.<br>
In the preferred embodiment described herein, for<br>
the first images acquired by an intra-oral sensor of a<br>
type Ti, with a resolution LR or HR, the processor 21 of<br>
the control module 20 reads the desired duration Di for<br>
X-ray emission from the table T.<br>
The control module 20 includes means for detecting<br>
the beginning of X-ray emission by the generator 10.<br>
Since these means do not form part of the invention,<br>
they are not described in detail herein. They may be<br>
constituted in particular by any of the prior art means<br>
mentioned in the introduction to this document, namely<br>
receiving an explicit command coming from generator 10,<br>
e.g. via the communications channel 31, or by detector<br>
means of the X-ray sensitive pellet type placed in the<br>
intra-oral sensor 30.<br>
In any event, the processor 21 of the control module<br>
20 is adapted to start a timer 24 for measuring the<br>
duration of X-ray emission from detection of the<br>
beginning of said emission.<br>
When said measured duration is equal to the duration<br>
Di stored in the table T, the processor 21 sends the<br>
command to the X-ray generator 10 to cause the generator<br>
10 to stop emitting X-rays.<br>
As described above, for each acquired image, the<br>
processor 21 updates the mean gain MGi of an image<br>
sequence acquired by a sensor type Ti and resolution LR<br>
or HR pair.<br>
Once a sufficient number of images have been<br>
acquired, when the mean gain MGi differs from the gain Gi<br>
desired for a particular type of image, the processor 21<br>
adjusts the duration Ti with a step of size Si. For<br>
example, if the desired equilibrium gain Gi is 6 decibels<br>
(dB), and if the measured mean gain MGi for the latest<br><br>
8<br>
images is a gain of 10 dB, then the processor 21<br>
increases the emission duration Di by a step Si, e.g. of<br>
5 milliseconds.<br>
In a variant, the module 20 sends a command to the<br>
generator 20 so that for the next acquisition it modifies<br>
the quantity of X-rays emitted in accordance with said<br>
adjusted quantity. The person skilled in the art will<br>
understand that modifying the step size Si amounts to<br>
adjusting the power at which the generator emits X-rays<br>
for constant duration of emission.<br><br>
