				<td>PROCESS FOR PREPARATION OF 3-(2-HYDROXY-5-METHYLPHENYL)-N,N-DIISOPROPYL-3-PHENYLPROPYLAMINE<br>
Technical (Field<br>
The invention belongs to the field of organic chemistry and relates to a novel efficient synthetic process for the preparation of 3-(2-hydroxy~5-methylphenyl)-N,N-diisopropyl-3-phenylpropylamine characterized by an easily obtainable 3-(2-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl)-3-phenylpropanol as a key intermediate.<br>
Background Art<br>
Several synthetic approaches for preparation of 3-(2-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl)-N,N-diisopropyl-3-phenylpropylamine have been described. Prior art literature describes ptseparation of racemic and enantiomerically pure product, which is obtained eitmer with the resolution of the enantiomers in the last step or the chiral synthesis.<br>
EP 325571 reveals a multiple step process for the preparation of 3-{2-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl)-N,N-diisopropyl-3-phenylpropylamine starting from 4-{-methoxy-5-methylphenyl)-6-methyi-3,4-dihydrocoumarin as the first intermediate. Lactone ring opening in trie basic medium with simultaneous esterification of carboxylic group and etherification of phenol hydroxyl leads to 3,3-diphenylpropionic acid ester. Subsequent reduction of the propionate intermediate, tosylation of alcohol moiety, substitution with diisopropylamine and deprotection of the phenol group yields 3-(2-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl)-N,N-diisopropyl-3-phenylpropylamine. Resolution of the enantiomers is achieved by fractional crystallisation using (+)-L-tartaric acid resulting in pure chiral crystalline tartarate. Also WO 03/01460 addresses the above process.<br>
According to WO 04/078700 the cleavage of the methyl ether protecting group from the phenol moiety by heating in a mixture of aqueous HBr and acetic acid<br><br>
facilitates the formation of the 3-(2-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl)-N,N-diisopropyl-3-phenylpropylamine dimer.<br>
US 5922914 teaches a four reaction steps process using 3,4-dihydro-6-methyl-4-phenyl-2-benzopyran-2-ol as a key intermediate. Amination with diisopropylamine proceeds in the presence of hydrogen at elevated pressure.<br>
There are known several approaches of enantioselective synthesis of enantiomers of 3-(2-hydrbxy-5-methylphenyl)-N,N-diisopropyl-3-phenylpropylamine.<br>
Multiple step process for the preparation of enantiomerically enriched (+)-R-3-(2-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl)-N,N-diisopropyl-3-phenylpropylamine relies on the synthesis of the enantiomerically enriched 3,4-dihydro-6-methyl-4-phenyl-2-benzopyran-2-one as disclosed in US 6310248. Enantiomerically enriched benzopyran-2-one intermediate is prepared by the 3-step process starting with enantioselective reduction of carbonyl group of 3-methyl-3-phenyl-1-inden-1-on followed by the sigmatropic rearrangement and Bayer-Villiger oxidation.<br>
US 6410748 reveals application of the bis-transitional metal (rhodium) catalyst for the insertion reaction in the preparation of enantiomerically enriched gem-diarylalkyl derivatives.<br>
Asymmetric synthesis of enantiomers of 3-(2-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl)-N,N-diisopropyl-3-phenylpropylamine was published in J. Organic Chem., 1998, 63, 8067 and comprises copper-assisted asymmetric conjugate addition of aryl Grignard reagent to phenylpropenoyl derivative of oxazolidinone used as a chiral auxiliary. Another approach was published in the Organic Process Research and Development (2002, 6, 379)<br>
3,4-dihydro-S-methyl-4-phenyl-2H-benzopyran-2-one is a known from WO 01/49649 and its use in a synthesis of a title compound is known from CZ 293791.<br><br>
Despite several described approaches towards 3-(2-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl)-N,N-diisopropyl-3-phenylpropylamine a need for shorter, less expensive and more industrially applicable processes performed under milder conditions still remains.<br>
Namely, 3-(2-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl)-N,N-diisopropyl-3-phenylpropylamine prepared from 3,4-dihydro-6-methyl-4-phenyl-2H-benzopyranon is a key starting compound for the preparation of tolterodine, (+)-(R)-3-{2-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl)-N,N-diisopropyl-3-phenylpropylamine, currently marketed as (+)-L-tartarate salt - an important urological drug, which acts as a nonsubtype selective muscarinic receptor antagonist. It is used for manufacturing of the medicament for treating the patients with overactive bladder showing symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, or urge incontinence and can be used for treating asthma, CODP and allergic rhinitis. Also its metabolite a 5-hydroxymethyl exhibits antimuscarinic activity.<br>

3,4-Dihydro-6-methyl-4-phenyl-2-benzopyran-2-one (compound of formula I) is readily accessible starting material. Surprisingly, we found that it can be transformed to 3-(2-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl)-N,N-diisopropyl-3-phenyl-propylamine (compound of formula VI) by faster and more convenient synthetic approach using less expensive and hazardous chemicals than previously known. The present invention reveals a short process performed under mild reaction conditions and therefore suitable for large scale production.<br>
The reductive opening of the lactone ring of the compound of formula I, but also those optionally substituted, can be achieved with variety of reducing agents and reaction conditions suitable for reduction of ester to alcohol group. It is preferred that the process is performed using complex metal hydride such as and preferably seleceted from lithium aluminum hydride and sodium borohydride, but also calcium aluminum hydride or lithium borohydride with or without the presence of an additive lor enhancement of reactivity such as LiBr, CoCl2, ZnCI2, AICI3, in an organic solvent for from 15 min to 24 h at the temperature in the range of -10 °C to 150 °C. In the preferred embodiment the reaction is performed with lithium aluminum hydride in the organic solvent preferably in an ether or aromatic hydrocarbon, such as tetrahydrofuran, ethyl ether, diisopropylether, metyl t-butylether, monoglyme, diglyme, dioxane, benzene, toluene, and the mixture thereof with the reaction time between 30 min and 8 h, even more preferably, in tetrahydrofuran solution in the temperature range between -5 °C to 30 °C. In an alternative embodiment, the optionally substituted compound of formula I is treated with sodium borohydride in an organic solvent as above or selected from the group of alcohols, polyols or glymes with or without an additive for enhancement of reactivity, preferably in 2 h to 8 h of reaction time and in the temperature ranges between 20 °C to 100 °C. After suitable workup and purification the 2-hydroxypheylpropanol derivative (compound of formula II) is obtained and used in the next step.<br>
In the proceeding step the compound of formula II having two hydroxyl moieties is transformed by treating with a reagent presenting at the same time activation of the alcohol moiety (hydroxyl group on the propyl chain) forming easily<br><br><br>
substitutable group (functioning as an activating group) on propyl chain and protection of the phenol group (functioning as a protecting group). The preferred reaction is esterifying. The suitable reagent is preferably an acid or its derivative and can be selected from the group of acids, acid halogenides or acid anhydrides yielding O-substituents, such as alkylcarboxy, arylcarboxy, sulphonyloxy, phosphoryloxy groups, preferably sulfonyloxy groups, preferably unsubstituted and substituted (C1C6)-alkansulfonyloxy, 10-camphorsulfonyloxy and arene-sulfonyloxy, yet more preferably trifluoromethanesulfonyloxy and C2-C4 sulfonyloxy groups, most preferably benzenesulfonyloxy or ethanesulfonyloxy groups. In the preferred embodiment, 2-hydroxypheylpropanol derivative (compound of formula II) is reacted with at least two equivalents of ethanesulfonyl chloride or benzenesullonyl chloride or anhydride in the presence of at least two equivalents of organic base, preferably tertiary amine or pyridine derivative, preferably triethylamine. The reaction mixture is preferably stirred until completion of the reaction. The choice of the solvent is not critical, and suitable solvents include, but are not limited to chlorinated solvents such as methylene chloride, chloroform or toluene or in some case even aqueous solvents. The reaction is usually performed from about -20 °C to 40 °C, preferably -5 °C to 30 °C, more preferably -20 °C to 10 °C . The reaction temperature may be also elevated in order to increase the reaction rate.<br>
Compounds of Formula III may be upon isolation and purification used in the next step. Alternatively compounds of Formula III can be used in next step without purification i.e. a single pot synthesis from compounds of Formula II to V or from III to V is envisaged. In case those and/or subsequent intermediates are not isolated and purified, it is advantageous to make and use less reactive compounds, such as benzenesulfonyloxy or ethanesulfonyloxy or propanesulfonyloxy or butanesulfonyloxy, or carboxyl or phosphoryl that is those where Y in the Formula III represents: R"- SO2- where R" is selected from C2-C4 alkyl, preferably C2H5, or C4H9; completely or partially fluorinated C1-C4 alkyl, preferably CF3 or C4F9or CF3-CH2; halogen, preferably F; NMe3(CH2); or Y represents R'-C6H4-SO2; where R' is H, or Br, Cl, or Y is R'"-CO, where R"' is an alkyl.<br><br><br>
The group attached to propyl chain of the compound of Formula III can be further selectively substituted with an amine of formula NHR1R2 where R1 and R2 can be same or different selected from H or optionally substituted C1-C4 alkyl; preferably diisopropylamine giving compound of Formula V. However if the amine is stericaly hindered such as diisopropylamine, it shows weak nucleophilic character for the substitution of activated ester groups. Thus, the reaction rate can be increased with use of aprotic polar solvents, elevated temperature and pressure. It is preferred that the reaction between compound of Formula III and diisopropylamine is performed in a polar aprotic solvent such as acetonitrile, DMA, DMF, THF, DMSO, 1-methylpyrrolidinone preferably acetonitrile. Alternatively the reaction can be performed in an organic solvent, which does not mix with water such as chlorinated solvents or aromatic solvents optionally using phase transfer catalysis. The reaction may be performed at temperatures above 50°C, preferably at above 70 °C more preferably at about 80 °C for up to 2 weeks, preferably for 4-8 days at elevated pressure, preferably in a pressure bottle (avtoclave) above normal pressure, preferably below 20 atm most preferably at about 3 atm.<br>
However if the group attached to propyl chain of the compound of Formula III is first converted into halo derivative, yielding compound of Formula IV, where halo is iodo and only in subsequent reaction step into amine derivative, the reaction times of both reactions are significantly shorter (i.e up to a day, preferably up to 6 hours) compared to those as described above. Alternatively steps from compound of Fomrual III via compound of Formula IV to compound of formula V may be performed as a combined step i.e. in a single pot synthesis. Also in that case overall reaction time is significantly shorter.<br>
Thus it is preferred that in the next step the compound of Formula III is reacted with a source of halogen, preferably sodium iodide or bromide, preferably under pressure, preferably in a suitable solvent such as be acetonitrile, DMF DMA. In that reaction the O-substituent of the propyl chain is substituted with a halogen. The reaction may be performed at temperatures above 50°C, but preferably bellow 200 °C, preferably at above 70 °C, more preferably above 80 °C, most preferably at temperatures at about 115 °C; for a period from few minutes up to<br><br><br>
about half a day, preferably from 2 to 6 hours. Formed compound of Formula IV, where Y is as above can be used in subsequent reaction steps without extensive purification.<br>
Halo substituent on the compound of Formula IV can now be further selectively substituted with an amine of formula NHR1R2 where R1 and R2 can be same or different selected from H or optionally substituted C1-C4 alkyl; preferably diisopropylamine givng compound of Formula V. It is preferred that the reaction between compound of Formula IV and amine is performed in a polar aprotic solvent such as acetonitrile, DMA, DMF, THF, DMSO, 1-methylpyrrolidinone preferably acetonitrile or alternatively the reaction can be performed in an organic solvent, which does not mix with water as described above. The reaction may be performed at temperatures above 50°C, but preferably bellow 200 °C, preferably at above 70 °C, more preferably above 80 °C, most preferably at about 115° for up to few hours, preferably for 2-6 hours days at elevated pressure, preferably in a pressure bottle (avtoclave) above normal pressure, preferably below 20 atm most preferably at about 3 atm. The obtained compound of formula V can be generally (and preferably in case of a tertiary amine) purified by acido - basic extraction.<br>
In case the reaction steps from compound of Formula III to Formula V are combined by performing reaction with amine in presence of sodium iodide, the molar amount of sodium iodide may be (and preferably are) lower than molar amount of starting compound of Formula III. The reaction conditions may be same as when aminating the compound of Formula IV.<br>
Although more reactive esters such as toluene sulfonyloxy or methylsulfonyloxy provide for quicker reaction times, especialy in case when performing the reaction in absence of sodium iodide, the use of less reactive esters such as benzenesulfdnyloxy or ethylsulfonyloxy is advantageous because less and lower amounts of side products are formed.<br>
Cleavage of the 0-substitutent such as alkylcarbonyl, sulphonyl, phosphonyl or phosphoryl ester group from the optionally substituted compound of formula V or<br><br><br>
its analog yields optionally substituted title compound of formula VI. In the preferred embodiment this compound is 3-(2-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl)-N,N-diisopropyl-3-phenylpropylamine. Generally, this cleavage can be achieved by hydrolysis by any method known in the art, for example using a suitable base or acid. In the preferred embodiment the base can be metal salt of an alkoxide or metal hydroxide in a solution of at least one alcohol, ether, amide, ketone or polar aprotic solvent or water or a mixture thereof. Suitable bases include but are not limited to sodium or potassium hydroxide, methoxide, ethoxide, propoxide, isopropoxide, t-butoxide and t-pentanoxide, with tertiary alkoxide being preferred. Suitable solvents include but are not limited to alcohols as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, t-butanol or t-pentanol; aprotic solvents as tetrahydrofurane, dioxane, acetonitrile, dimetylformamide, dimethylacetamide or water or a mixture thereof. The use of the same alkyl group in an alkoxide and solvent alcohol is preferred to prevent exchange of the groups, for example, potassium t-butoxide in t-butanol. Preferably, the reaction is carried out in a solution of t-butoxide in t-butanol with a few equivalents of water added. It is performed at the temperature from room temperature up to the boiling point of the solvent, preferably from about 40 °C to about 100 °C, with about 50 °C to about 70 oC being optimum, the maximum temperature being determined by the boiling point of the used solvent. The reaction mixture is maintained at the desired temperature until the reaction is substantially complete, usually 1 to 12 hours, and then it is cooled to room temperature.<br>
For the isolation of the product the following workup may be used: water is added to the reaction mixture and it is further stirred for some time. The product is extracted with a (with water) non-miscible organic solvent. The organic fraction is washed with water, dried with a drying agent and evaporated under vacuum to form 3-(2-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl-N,N-diisopropyl-3-phenylpropylamine (compound of formula V) which can be further treated with (+)-L-tartaric acid in order to achieve resolution of the enantiomers. The resolution of enatiomers will however mean to include also any other usual method. The following examples are offered to illustrate aspects of the present invention, and are not intended to limit or define the present invention in any manner.<br><br><br>
