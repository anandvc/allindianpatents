Further, the optically active amino acid (5) include salts such as a salt of hydrochloride, a salt of<br><br>
sulfuric acid and a salt of acetic acid of the above each compound.<br>
As the method for producing the optically active aminoalcohol (1) wherein the starting material is the optically active amino acid (5), when R1 in the formula (1) is a hydrogen atom, the reaction of the optically active amino acid (5) and a borohydride compound is exemplified (e.g. Tetrahedron Letters,33, 5517(1992), J. Org. Chem., 58, 3568(1993) and Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl., 28, 218(1989)).<br>
Herein, examples of the borohydride compounds include boron hydride and a complex of it and a compound which can be coordinated to it such as diborane and borane-tetrahydrofuran complex; a mixture comprising a metal borohydride and an acid; a mixture comprising a metal borohydride and a diester of sulfuric acid; and a metal borohydride.  When the ester of the optically active amino acid (R6 is a Cl-4 alkyl group) is used as the optically active amino acid (5), only the metal borohydride is preferably used as the borohydride compound.  When the optically active amino acid (R6 is a hydrogen atom) is used as the optically active amino acid (5), at least one borohydride compound selected from boron hydride and the complex of it and the compound which can be coordinated to it; the mixture comprising the metal borohydride and the<br><br>

Examples of the Grignard reagents include a Grignard reagent represented by the formula (6) (hereinafter, simply referred to as the Grignard reagent (6)):<br>
R1MgX        (6)<br>
wherein R1 is as defined above and X represents a halogen<br><br>
atom, and examples of the halogen atoms represented by X include a chlorine atom, a bromine atom and an iodine atom.<br>
Examples of the Grignard reagent (6) include methylmagnesium chloride, ethylmagnesium chloride, n-propylmagnesium chloride, isopropylmagnesium chloride, n-butylmagnesium chloride, isobutylmagnesium chloride, tert-butylmagnesium chloride, n-pentylmagnesium chloride, n-hexylmagnesium chloride, phenylmagnesium chloride, 3-methylphenylmagnesium chloride, 4-methylphenylmagnesium chloride, 2-methoxyphenylmagnesium chloride, 4-methoxyphenylmagnesium chloride, benzylmagnesium chloride, 4-methylbenzylmagnesium chloride, 4-methoxybenzylmagnesium chloride, 1-naphthylmethylmagnesium chloride and 2-naphthylmethylmagnesium chloride, and these compounds in which "chloride" is replaced with "bromide" or "iodide". When R1 represents the Cl-6 alkyl group and the compound in which two R1s, which are bonded to the same carbon atom, are bonded to form a ring together with the carbon atom to which they are bonded is desired, the Grignard reagent such as butane-1,4-dimagnesium dichloride, pentane-1,5-dimagnesium dichloride, hexane-1,6-dimagnesium dichloride and these compounds in which "chloride" is replaced with "bromide" or "iodide" may be used as the Grignard reagent.<br>
The configuration of the asymmetric center represented by * in the optically active aminoalcohol (1) obtained is<br><br>
the same as that of the optically active amino acid (5) used.<br>
In the diester compound represented by the formula (2) (hereinafter, simply referred to as the diester (2)), R3 and R4 are the same or different, and each represents a hydrogen atom or a Cl-3 alkyl group.  R5 represents a Cl-3 alkyl group and m represents an integer of 0 to 2 (preferably m=l).<br>
When m is 2 in the diester (2), R3 and R4 preferably represent hydrogen atoms.<br>
Examples of the diester (2) include dimethyl oxalate, diethyl oxalate, dimethyl malonate, diethyl malonate, dimethyl dimethylmalonate, diethyl dimethylmalonate, dimethyl diethylmalonate, diethyl diethylmalonate, dimethyl succinate and diethyl succinate.<br>
The amount of the diester (2) to be used is usually about 0.2 to 2 moles, preferably about 0.4 to 1 mole relative to 1 mole of the optically active aminoalcohol (1).<br>
Examples of the lithium compounds used in the reaction of the optically active aminoalcohol (1) and the diester (2) include lithium hydroxide; a lithium alkoxide such as lithium methoxide and lithium ethoxide; and a lithium halide such as lithium chloride.  The amount of them to be used is not particularly limited and it may be catalytic amount.  Typically, it is about 0.0005 to 0.5 mole relative<br><br>
to 1 mole of the diester (2).<br>
The reaction is usually carried out in the presence of a solvent.  Examples of the solvents to be used include aromatic hydrocarbon solvents such as toluene and xylene; aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents such as hexane, heptane and octane; halogenated hydrocarbon solvents such as chlorobenzene; and ether solvents such as tetrahydrofuran and dimethoxyethane.  These solvents may be used alone or by mixing two or more of them.  The amount of the solvent to be used is not particularly limited and it is usually about 2 to 500 parts by weight relative to 1 part by weight of the optically active aminoalcohol (1).<br>
The reaction temperature is not particularly limited<br>
and it is usually a range of about 20 to 150°C.  The reaction is preferably carried out while removing an<br>
alcohol produced as a by-product in the reaction represented by the formula (4) (hereinafter, simply referred to as the alcohol (4)):<br>
R5OH         (4)<br>
wherein R5 is as above, out the reaction system at a<br>
temperature which is a boiling point of the alcohol (4) and above.<br>
The present reaction is usually carried out under an atmospheric condition and may be carried out under a pressurized condition.  It can be also carried out under a<br><br>
reduced pressure in order to remove the alcohol (4) like the above.<br>
The present reaction is carried out by mixing the lithium compound, the optically active aminoalcohol (1), the diester (2) and if necessary in the presence of the solvent, and the mixing order is not particularly limited. For example, it may be carried out by adjusting a reaction temperature after mixing them at a time and by adding the diester (2) to a mixture of the lithium compound and the optically active aminoalcohol (1) whose temperature is adjusted to the reaction temperature.<br>
After completion of the reaction, for example, the optically active bisamidoalcohol compound represented by the formula (3) (hereinafter, simply referred to as the optically active bisamidoalcohol (3)) can be obtained by adding water to the reaction mixture, if necessary conducting extracting treatment using a water-insoluble organic solvent such as toluene and ethyl acetate, and concentrating the organic layer obtained.  When the product is precipitated from the reaction mixture, the product can be isolated by the operation such as filtration.  The optically active bisamidoalcohol (3) obtained can be further purified by a conventional method such as distillation and recrystallization.<br>

adjusted to 10°C.  To this suspension, 61.0 mL (61.0 mmol) of 1M borane-tetrahydrofuran complex was added dropwise over 30 minutes and the resulting mixture was stirred at the same temperature for 1 hour.  After that. The mixture<br>
was heated to an inner temperature of 65°C and stirred at the same temperature for 4 hours.  After the reaction<br>
mixture was cooled to 10°C,8 mL of methanol was added dropwise thereto over 20 minutes.  After reaction mixture was concentrated using an evaporator, 20 mL of 4M aqueous sodium hydroxide solution was added thereto and stirred at room temperature for 1 hour.  Next, the extraction was conducted by adding 40 mL of tert-butyl methyl ether and<br><br>
the organic layer obtained was dehydrated over sodium sulfate.  Sodium sulfate was removed by filtration and tert-butyl methyl ether was distilled away by atmospheric distillation.  Further, 2.82 g of (S)-tert-leucinol was<br>
obtained as a fraction of 70 to 75°C by reduced-pressure distillation (0.3 kPa). Yield: 79%.<br>
