				<td>This application is divided out of Indian Patent Application No. 2196 CAL 96<br>
since accepted under number 192212.<br>
The present invention concerns a lid with its knob, such as a lid for cooking<br>
vessels.<br>
There exist at present lids with a knob, some of which include a steam vent<br>
orifice, attached to the lid by a screw.<br>
The knobs have the drawback of increasing the overall size of the lids and<br>
making it difficult to stack them up.<br>
Furthermore, the knob is generally retained by a screw at the centre of the knob,<br>
the steam vent orifice being at the edge. It is then necessary to index the knob<br>
rotationally so that when it is screwed onto the lid the orifice in the knob and the steam<br>
vent hole in the lid line up.<br>
An aim of the present invention is to eliminate the constraints referred to above<br>
and to propose a lid and its knob that are very much simpler to fit and to use.<br>
The lid to which the invention is directed includes a knob, coupling means being<br>
adapted to fix the knob to the lid.<br>
The present invention provides a lid comprising<br>
a holding knob, coupling means for fixing the knob to the lid, said coupling<br>
means having a lug and a notch, said notch having an entry portion through which the<br>
lug enters the notch and a retaining portion for retaining the lug in the notch, the lug<br>
moving between the entry portion and the retaining portion of the notch when the knob<br>
and the lid are moved relative to each other, wherein<br>
the lid has a recessed part and a shoulder between the recessed part and the<br>
remainder of the lid;<br>
the holding knob has a portion of substantially complementary shape to said<br>
recessed part and a plane annular part around said complementary shape portion;<br>
said coupling means are attached to the plane annular part and the shoulder;<br>
said holding knob is adapted to be moved over the recessed part between the<br>
entry portion and the retaining portion of the notch, such that when the holding knob is<br>
removed nothing projects from the lid.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the coupling means comprise at least one lug<br>
and one notch having a portion through which the lug enters the notch and a portion for<br>
holding the lug engaged in a notch, the lug being mobile between the entry portion and<br>
the holding portion when the lid and the knob are displaced relative to each other.<br>
Accordingly, simply by relative displacement of the knob and the lid, the<br>
combination may be assembled or demounted. There is obtained in this way a<br>
removable knob having many advantages: it simplifies cleaning of the lid and it saves<br>
space for storage or transport, in particular by allowing stacking up of the lids after<br>
removing the knob.<br>
The lid and the knob also form a modular assembly, and a single knob can be<br>
used for different lids, regardless of the material or the shape of the lid.<br>
In one preferred version of the invention, the lid has a recessed part, the knob<br>
having a portion of substantially complementary shape to the recessed part and being<br>
adapted to be moved over the recessed part between the entry portion and the holding<br>
portion of the notch.<br>
The complementary shapes of the lid and the knob guide the knob when it is<br>
fitted to the lid.<br>
This facilitates the insertion of the lug into the notch and its locking in the notch.<br>
The lug is preferably mobile between the entry portion and the holding portion of<br>
the notch when the knob is rotated about a central axis of the knob.<br>
This mounting of the knob on the lid by rotation, bayonet fashion, provides a<br>
fixing that, although easily demountable, is very secure when the user manipulates the<br>
lid by means of the knob.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the invention, a lid knob is characterised in<br>
that it includes at least one lug adapted to be engaged in a notch in the lid.<br>
Other features and advantages of the invention will emerge further from the<br>
following description.<br>
In the accompanying drawings, which are provided by way of non-limiting<br>
example:<br>
- Figure 1A is a sectional view of a lid with knob constituting a first embodiment<br>
of the invention ;<br>
- Figure 1B is a bottom view of the knob from Figure 1A ;<br>
- Figure 1C is a top view of the lid from Figure 1A ;<br>
- Figure 2A is a partly sectional and partly<br>
elevational view of a lid with knob constituting a second<br>
embodiment of the invention;<br>
- figure 2B is a bottom view of the knob from<br>
figure 2A;<br>
- figure 2C is a bottom view of the lid from figure<br>
2A; and<br>
- figure 3 is a perspective view of a component<br>
illustrating a variant of the figure 2A embodiment.<br>
A first embodiment of the invention will first be<br>
described with reference to figures 1A, 1B and 1C.<br>
In accordance with the invention, a lid 1 includes<br>
a knob 10 removably fixed by coupling means comprising at<br>
least one lug 11 and one notch 21 in which the lug is<br>
engaged.<br>
As shown in figure 1C, the notch 21 has an entry<br>
portion 21a through which the lug 11 can pass and a<br>
holding portion 21b for holding the lug 11 engaged in the<br>
notch 21.<br>
The lug 11 has an enlarged end portion 11a that can<br>
pass through the orifice 21a of the notch and a body l1b<br>
of smaller cross-section than the end portion lla that<br>
can be moved into the holding portion 21b of the notch,<br>
the enlarged end portion lla of the lug not being capable<br>
of passing through the holding portion 21b of the notch,<br>
so fixing the knob to the lid.<br>
In this example, the fixing means comprise two<br>
identical lugs 11 and two corresponding notches 21.<br>
Fixing is achieved by rotating the knob 10 relative<br>
to the lid 1, the notches 21 being on a common circle<br>
concentric with the lid 1.<br>
Accordingly, when the knob 10 is rotated about its<br>
central axis 10a the lugs 11 are engaged with the notches<br>
21 and the knob is thus located at the centre of the lid,<br>
which provides a better distribution of the weight of the<br>
lid.<br>
The lid 1 includes a recessed part 24, the knob 10<br>
having a portion 14 of substantially complementary shape<br>
to this recessed part 24 and being adapted to be moved<br>
over this recessed part 24 between the entry portion 21a<br>
and the holding portion 21b of the notch 21.<br>
The recessed part 24 is pressed into the top<br>
surface of the lid 1 and is frustoconical in shape, the<br>
knob 10 having a frustoconical projection 14 of<br>
complementary shape to the recessed part 24.<br>
The lid 1 further includes a shoulder 25 between<br>
the frustoconical recessed part 24 and the remainder of<br>
the lid 1, and the knob 10 includes a plane part 15<br>
around the complementary frustoconical shape portion 14,<br>
the coupling means 11, 21 being attached to the plane<br>
annular portion 15 and the shoulder 25.<br>
The complementary frustoconical shapes of the knob<br>
10 and the lid 1 guide rotation of the knob when fitted<br>
to the lid.<br>
The lugs are fastened to the knob 10 and are<br>
disposed on the plane annular part 15.<br>
The notches are formed in the lid, in the shoulder<br>
25, so that when the knob 10 is removed there are no<br>
projecting parts of the lid 1.<br>
The knob 10 preferably further includes a steam<br>
vent orifice 12 at the centre and the lid 1 preferably<br>
includes a corresponding central opening 22 for venting<br>
cooking steam.<br>
In the second embodiment shown in figures 2A, 2B<br>
and 2C the coupling means are at the centre of the knob<br>
10 and the lid 1. Components identical to those of the<br>
first embodiment, identified by the same reference<br>
numbers in these figures, are not described again<br>
hereinafter.<br>
The knob 10 incorporates lugs 11 extending radially<br>
from its central vertical axis 10a.<br>
The two lugs 11 therefore form projections at. the<br>
end 16 of the knob 10, preferably opposite each other.<br>
The lid 1 includes an opening forming substantially circular notch, each entry<br>
portion 21a adapted to allow the insertion of a lug 11 on the knob 10 being in the form<br>
of an angular sector and each holding portion 21 b being in the form of another angular<br>
sector having a smaller radius than the entry portion 21a.<br>
Each lug 11 extends from the axis 10a of the knob 10 by a distance substantially<br>
equal to the radius of the angular sector formed by an entry portion 21a and greater<br>
than the radius of the angular sector formed by a holding portion 21b.<br>
In this embodiment, the notch has two opposite entry portions 21a adjacent two<br>
opposite holding portions 21b.<br>
When the knob 10 is fixed to the lid the lugs 11 pass through the entry portions<br>
21a and are then turned under the lid 1, under the holding portions 21 b of the notch 21.<br>
In this embodiment, the knob 10 can also be fitted to the bottom of the lid 1, by<br>
inserting the lugs 11 into the entry portions 21a and turning the lugs 11 on top of the lid<br>
1, on top of the holding portions 21b of the notch 21.<br>
The centre of the notch 21 in the lid includes an opening 22 for venting cooking<br>
steam and corresponding to a passage 12 in the knob 10 opening under the lid at its<br>
end 16 and having a steam vent orifice 17 on top of the lid.<br>
As shown in figure 3, the notch 21 may be formed in an insert 30 that is fixed in<br>
to an opening 22 into the lid and has a thickness greater than the thickness of the lid 1.<br>
The circular insert 30 may be clipped to the edges<br>
of the central opening 12 in the lid by means of elastic<br>
lugs 33, or glued or mechanically crimped in place.<br>
It avoids the sharp edge that: would be present if<br>
the notch 21 were formed directly in the lid and<br>
eliminates the constraint of the thickness of the lid.<br>
The insert has two notches 21 as described<br>
previously for fixing the knob. It may be made of metal<br>
or of a plastics material .<br>
The insert 3 0 may also incorporate two other<br>
notches 34 similar to the notches 21 and enabling the<br>
knob to be fixed to the bottom of the lid 1, in<br>
particular during storage of the latter.<br>
Each notch 34 can have an entry portion common to<br>
an entry portion 21a of the notches 21 and a holding<br>
portion disposed symmetrically to the holding portion 21b<br>
relative to the entry portion 21a. These holding<br>
portions of the notches 21 and 34 are inverted relative<br>
to each other within the thickness of the insert 30, i.e.<br>
the holding portion 21b of the notch 21 is in the bottom<br>
part of the insert 30 and the holding portion of the<br>
notch 34 is in the top part of the insert 30 when the<br>
latter is fixed to the lid 1.<br>
When the knob 10 is fixed to the lid 1 the lug 11<br>
passes through the entry portion 21a of the top part<br>
towards the bottom part of the insert 30, and is then<br>
turned under the holding part 21b. Conversely, when the<br>
knob 10 is fixed to the bottom of the lid the lug 11<br>
passes through the entry portion 21a of the bottom part<br>
towards the top part of the insert 30, and is then turned<br>
on top of the holding portion of the notch 34.<br>
Of course, many modifications may be made to the<br>
above examples without departing from the scope of the<br>
invention.<br>
For example, the knob may be fixed to the lid by<br>
movement of the knob across the lid in translation by<br>
virtue of straight notches.<br>
Moreover, by adding a non-return member to a lug of<br>
the knob, the knob may be fixed once and for all when it<br>
is locked to the lid for the first time, after passing a<br>
predetermined angular threshold.<br>
The knob 10 could be a different shape, for example<br>
a handle or a loop.<br><br>
