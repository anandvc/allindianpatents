				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process to introduce predetermined<br>
compressive strength of 300 MPa upto a depth of 0.25mm from peened<br>
surface on Low Pressure (LP) Fir-tree root blades of Steam Turbine operating<br>
at 3000 rpm to prevent failure during operation.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
In large capacity thermal power projects, normally 3 turbines namely high<br>
pressure (HP), intermediate pressure (IP) and low pressure (LP) exists. In HP<br>
and IP turbines blade heights are relatively small because of high pressure<br>
and temperature but in LP turbines blade heights are quite large because of<br>
low pressure and high specific volume of steam. In HP and IP turbines<br>
normally T-roots are used but in LP turbines because of high centrifugal<br>
stress, T-roots are insufficient and normally Fir-tree roots are used in moving<br>
blades. In HP and IP turbines because of low blade heights and less<br>
centrifugal force, chances of failure from root is negligible, however in LP<br>
turbines, due to high CF chances of failure from blade root is very high.<br>
Fir Tree roots of Steam Turbine blades have complex profile (Figure-1 and 2)<br>
on the root which is inserted in the Rotor of a turbine. These blades are<br>
subjected to 3000 RPM (50 Cycles per second), hence heavily stress part of<br>
turbine. There has been evidence of stress failure.<br>
-2-<br>
 <br>
Steam Turbine Blades are critical component and any blade failure may<br>
damage the total thermal set. There is a generic problem of cracking in the<br>
last stages of fir tree root blades and from the past data it has been<br>
concluded that most of the cracks occur in the top serration radius below the<br>
aerofoil. This problem is not limited to anyone manufacturer, turbine speed or<br>
operating condition and such failures are reported by several countries<br>
including US, Canada, UK, South Africa, Australia etc.<br>
Siemens, Germany has implemented Roller pressuring in their LP last stage<br>
blade to extend the life of blades.<br>
The difficulties envisaged to use the same process are:-<br>
i.        Long manufacturing cycle as it takes at least 4 months to get<br>
the blades back after Roller pressing to Siemens, Germany.<br>
ii.       Paying opportunity cost to Siemens,  Germany for Roller<br>
Pressing in case of urgent requirement of blades.<br>
iii.      Additional work of packing each and every blade for re-<br>
exporting.<br>
iv.      Completing paper formalities for excise and customs clearance.<br>
v.      To and fro transportation of heavy blades to Mumbai.<br>
vi.      Risk of misplacement/ damage of blades.<br>
To prevent such service failure and extend the blade service life, a special<br>
emphasis made by a dedicated technical team in BHEL was on the fina out<br>
the key points of failure and accordingly searching out various ways and<br>
means for remedical measure of such failure. One of such process is to<br>
introduce controlled shotpeening on the blade roots to introduce compressive<br>
residual stress of 300 MPa up to a depth of 0.25mm on the intersecting of<br>
both side top root flank.<br>
-3-<br>
 <br>
The last stage low pressure (LP) steam turbine blades are very highly stressed<br>
at the root region because of their size and weight. Cracking of blades at the<br>
first serration of the root resulting into failure of the blades has caused<br>
serious damage to some turbines. One of the main reasons of last stage blade<br>
failure is developing of Fretting stress &amp; stress corrosion cracking (SCC).<br>
Fretting is caused by small amplitude cyclical movement of two solid bodies in<br>
close contact and under pressure. The debris produced may not escape from<br>
their point of origin due to high pressure and small movement. Fretting<br>
causes shear peak by means of friction between the contact zones. The<br>
minute relative displacement of contact surface subsequently causes the<br>
rapture, which then oxidizes. The phenomenon of metallic fragment<br>
dislocation will accelerate under the influence of oxidized particles. Severe<br>
surface damage will soon appear due to the application of extreme stresses of<br>
moving parts and added stress due to friction. Fatigue micro-cracks will<br>
develop and propagate leading to eventual part rupture. The mode of failure<br>
usually observed is initiation of a stress corrosion crack (SCC) at the highly<br>
stressed region in the first (top) serration of the root and subsequent crack<br>
propagation by corrosion fatigue failure. The environment required for SCC to<br>
take place is provided by wet steam in the last stages of steam turbine.<br>
To increase fatigue and stress corrosion cracking resistance at the top<br>
serration of the root of advanced design LP Last stage blades, an extensive<br>
study reveals that a compressive residual stresses of 300 MPa up to a depth<br>
of 0.25 mm on top flank could be an effective solution. The above<br>
requirement could be achieved by using a sophisticated shot peening<br>
equipment. This operation resulted in the introduction of favourable<br>
compressive residual stress in top root flank Refer (Figure 5 to 9 )<br>
-4-<br>
 <br>
Shot Peening is widely recognized as a cost effective process to enhance the<br>
fatigue characteristics of metal parts. It is generally recognized that one of<br>
the reason for improvement on fatigue durability by shot peening is that the<br>
surface compression residual stress is increased. Shot peening is also applied<br>
to the improvement of stress corrosion cracking.<br>
Keeping this in mind it was envisaged that the required depth of compressive<br>
residual stress as required in Siemens advanced design LP blades for<br>
improving SCC and fatigue properties can also be obtained by controlled shot<br>
peening in the first (top) serration of the root without sacrificing other<br>
properties such as fretting resistance, surface finish, dimensional accuracy<br>
etc.<br>
The Shot peening was carried out to introduce compressive stresses, to a<br>
predetermined depth, in the Blade root of LP Fir tree to enhances fatigue<br>
strength, retard fretting and improve resistance to stress corrosion cracking<br>
and corrosion fatigue. The peening process consists of bombarding the<br>
exposed surface of fir tree root with a stream of hardened spherical metallic<br>
shots, delivered from a robotic controlled nozzle by applied air pressure.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to propose a process of to<br>
introduce compressive strength of LP Fir-tree blade root by shotpeening<br>
which eliminate the disadvantages of prior art.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose a process to introduce<br>
compressive strength of LP Fir-tree blade root by shot peening which<br>
increases the service life of the blade.<br>
-5-<br>
 <br>
A further object of the present invention is to propose a process to introduce<br>
the compressive strength of LP Fir-tree blade root by shot peening which<br>
reduces maintenance cost due to failure of blades.<br>
A still further object of the present invention is to propose a process to<br>
introduce the compressive strength of LP Fir-tree blade root by shot peening<br>
which prevents all of a sudden failure of blade.<br>
A yet further object of the present invention is to propose a process to<br>
introduce compressive strength of LP Fir-tree blade root by shot pinning<br>
which is economic compared to other process of remedy.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process to inroduce a predetermined<br>
compressive strength of 300 Mpa upto a depth of 0.25mm from the peened<br>
surface on fir-tree root blade for low-pressure steam turbine operating at<br>
3000 rpm. This process comprises bombarding a stream of hardened<br>
spherical steel shots through an air jet from a robotic controlled nozzle in a<br>
closed chamber. The hardened steel shots impinches the surface of the blade<br>
root for duration of 40-50 sec with an airjet of pressure 3 kg/m2 and increases<br>
the surface hardness as well as introduce compressive strength.<br>

impinching shots through robotic nozzle with a high pressure air jet having a<br>
pressure 3kg/m2. The blades shall be shot peened after complete root<br>
machining, flame hardening and stress relieving operations. Prior to shot<br>
peening, the blades are dried, free from grease, oil, soiling, corrosion and<br>
paint coating. All the edges shall be deburred and filleted as per the drawing<br>
specifications. The steel shots are injected through a nozzle having a diameter<br>
8mm and impinched shots generates compressive strength on the surface<br>
300 MPa upto a depth of 0.25mm as shown in Fig 5to 9.<br>
