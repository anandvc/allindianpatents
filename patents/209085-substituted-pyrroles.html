The compounds of formula I have antiproliferative activity, specifically, they inhibit cell division in G2/M phase of the cell cycle and are generally referred to as 'G2/M phase cell-cycle' inhibitors.<br>
The compounds of formula I are covered by formula I of U.S.P. 5.057,614 without bemg specifically disclosed as a group or individually. In addition, the above-mentioned activity o: the<br><br>
compounds of the present invention has nowhere been disclosed or made obvious in U.S.P,<br>
5,057,614 and, therefore, is surprising.<br>
Formula I above comprises the following three compounds:<br><br><br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs' means a compound that may be convened under physiological conditions or by solvolysis to any of the compounds of formula I or to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of said compounds.<br>
The compounds of formula I, as well as pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said compounds, are prepared by reactions represented in the following Schemes. The synthesis of each of these compounds is also described in Examples 1-3.<br>
Compound I-l can be prepared by reacting (l-methyl-6-nitro-lH-indol-3-yl)-oxo-acetyl chloride (3) with [l-(2,2-dimethyl-propionyl)-lH-indol-3yl]-3-ethanimidic acid 1-methyl-ethylester hydrochloride (7) and treating the reaction product with a base.<br>
Compound 1-2 can be prepared by reacting (l-methyl-lH-indol-3-yl)-oxo-acetyl chloride (17) with [l-(2,2-dimethyl-propionyl)-6-nitro-lH-indol-3-yl]-3-ethanimidic acid l-methyl-ethylester hydrochloride (19) and treating the reaction product with a base.<br>
Compound 1-3 can be prepared by reacting (l-methoxymethyl-lH-indol-3-yl)-oxo acetyl chloride (10) with (l-methyl-6-nitro-lH-indol-3-yl)-3-ethanimidic acid 1-methyleihylester hydrochloride (15) and treating the reaction product with an acid.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The antiproliferative activity of the compounds of the invention is demonstrated below. These effects indicate that the compounds are useful in treating cancer, in particular solid tumors.<br>
The estrogen receptor negative epithelial breast carcinoma line (MDA-MB-435) was purchased from American Type Cell Culture Collection (ATCC; Rockville, MD) and was grown in the medium recommended by ATCC. For analysis of the effect of the test compounds on growth of these cells, the cells were plated at 2000 cells per well in a 96-well tissue culture plate ('test plate"), and were incubated overnight at 37°C with 5% CO2.   The next day, the test<br>
compounds were dissolved in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to yield a 10 mM stock solution. Each compound was diluted with sterile distilled water to 1 mM and then was added to triplicate wells of a 96-well 'master plate" containing medium in a sufficient quantity to yield a final concentration of 40  The compounds were serially diluted in medium in the 'master plate." One-fourth final volume of the diluted compounds was transferred to duplicate "test plates." DMSO was added to a row of "control cells" such that the final concentration of DMSO in each well was 0.1%. The "test plates" were returned to the incubator and 3 days post addition of test compound one "test plate" was analyzed as described below. Similarly, 5 days after addition of test compound, the second "test plate" also was analyzed as described below.<br>
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tctrazolium bromide (thiazolyl blue; MTT) was added to each well to yield a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. The plate was then incubated at 37°C for 3 hours. The MTT-containing medium was then removed and 50 100%<br>
ethanol was added to each well to dissolve the resulting formazan metabolite. To ensure complete dissolution, plates were shaken for 15 minutes at room temperature. Absorbencies were read in a microtiter plate reader (Molecular Dynamics) at a wavelength of 570 nm with a 650 nm reference. Percent inhibition was calculated by subtracting the blank from all w ells, then subtracting the division of the average absorbance of each test triplicate by the average of the controls from 1.00. Inhibitory concentrations  (IC50 and IC90) were determined from the linear<br>
regression of a plot of the logarithm of the concentration versus the percent inhibition.<br><br>
The colon adenocarcinoma line SW480 and the colon carcinoma line HCT-116 also were obtained from the ATCC and were tested according to the same protocol provided above with the following modifications. Cell line SW480 was plated at 1000 cells per well and analyzed at 6 days post addition of the test compound. Cell line HCT-116 was plated at 750 cells per well and analyzed at 4 days post addition of test compound. For the MTT analysis, plates were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes prior to aspiration of the MTT-containing medium, and 100 !-il 100% ethanol was used to dissolve the formazan.<br><br><br><br>
For analysis of the effect of the compounds on cell cycle progression, MDA-MB-435 cells (ATCC; Rockville, MD) were plated at 1 x 10" cells/10 mis per 10 cm dish in the following growth medium: RPMI 1640 + 10% Heat-Inactivated Fetal Bovine Serum, 2 mM L-glutamine and 50 U/ml pen-strep (all from GIBCO/BRL, Gaithersburg, MD). The cells were incubated overnight at 37" C with 5% CO2. The next day, 10 p.1 of each of the compounds to be tested, in a 100% DMSO solution, was added to individual dishes to obtain 1/lOOOx final concentration of the stock solution. In addition, 10 100% DMSO was added to a control dish.<br>
The final concentration of DMSO in all plates, including the control, was 0.1%. The plates were returned to the incubator.<br>
Thereafter, at various periods of time, the medium in each plate was removed to a 50 ml centrifuge tube. The cell layer remaining in the dish was then washed with 5 ml of phosphate buffered saline (PBS; GIBCO/BRL). The PBS was removed and combined with the medium in the appropriate tube. The cells were trypsinized for 5 minutes at 37"" C, and the solution was collected and combined with the medium and PBS in the appropriate tubes. The tubes were then centrifuged for 5 minutes at 1200 rpm. The cells were fixed by removing the supemaiant. tapping the tube to distribute the pellet, then adding 5 mis of cold 70% ethanol while vonexing gently. The cells were then stored at -20" C for &gt;24 hours.<br><br>
The cell-containing tubes were taken out of freezer and allowed to sit at room temperature for 20-30 minutes. The tubes were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 minutes. The supernatant was removed, the pellets were washed with 5 ml PBS, and the tubes were centrifuged as above. Subsequently, the supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml PBS. Thereafter, 0.5 ml RNAse A (1 mg/ml in PBS) was added to each tube, and the lubes were incubated at 37° C for 15 minutes. 100 propidium iodide (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) (1 mg/ml in PBS) was added to each tube, and the tubes were then incubated at room temperature for 2-3 minutes. Each resulting solution was passed through a filter cap tube (Becton Dickinson, San Jose , CA, #2235).<br>
Samples were read in a FACSoit machine (Becton-Dickinson) using the manufacturer's CellQUEST program, and analyzed with the manufacturerfs ModFIT software. This measurement provides an indication of the percent of cells in each of the following phases: GO/Gl, DNA synthesis (S) and G2/M phases.<br><br>
The results of a cell cycle progression experiment analyzed at day 1 post addition of lest compounds I-l, 1-2 and 1-3 are summarized below in Table IV.<br><br>
The results summarized in Tables I-IV above demonstrate that compounds I-l. 1-2 and 1-3 have antiproliferative activity; specifically, they cause an accumulation of cells in the G2/m phase of the cell cycle.<br>
The pyrroles of formula I above and their aforementioned salts can be used as medicaments, for example, in the form of pharmaceutical preparations, which can be administered orally, for example, in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees. hard or soft gelatin capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions. They can also be administered rectally, for example, in the form of suppositories or parenterally, for example, in the form of injection solutions.<br><br>
For the manufacture of pharmaceutical preparations these compounds can be formulated with therapeutically inert, inorganic or organic carriers. Lactose, maize starch or derivatives thereof, talc, steric acid or its salts can be used as such carriers for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatin capsules. Suitable carriers for soft gelatin capsules are vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semi-solid or liquid polyols. Depending on the nature of the active substance no carriers are, however, generally required in the case of soft gelatin capsules. Suitable carriers for the manufacture of solutions and syrups are, water, polyols, saccharose, invert sugar and glucose. Suitable earners for injection are water, alcohols, polyols, glycerine, vegetable oils, phospholipids and surfactants, suitable carriers for suppositories are natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats and semi-liquid polyols.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations can also contain preserving agents, solubilizing agents, stabilizing agents, wetting agents, emulsifying agents, sweetening agents, coloring agents, flavoring agents, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, coating agents or antioxidants. They can also contain still other therapeutically valuable substances.<br>
As mentioned above, the pyrroles of formula I and their aforementioned salts can be used in the treatment or control of oncological disorders. The dosage can vary within wide limits and will, of course, be adjusted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In general, in the case of oral or parenteral administration to adult humans weighing about 70 kg, a daily dosage of about 10 mg to about 10,000 mg, preferably from about 200 mg to about 5,000 mg. more preferably to about 1000 mg, should be appropriate, although the upper limit may be exceeded when indicated. The daily dosage can be administered as a single dose or in divided doses, or for parenteral administration, it may be given as continuous infusion.<br><br>
