The present invention relates to a process for drying a flavouring agent paste obtained by thermal reaction of a pasty mixture comprising at least one free amino acid source and at least one reducing sugar.<br>
In such pastes, the flavours are bound to flavour carriers, in general natural or synthetic polysaccharides such as native starches, dextrins or vegetable fibres. The paste is then dried and the final dry cake is ground.<br>
Patent EP 0,030,327 describes a process for the preparation of a flavouring agent whose flavour carrier is maltodextrin. It is added at cold temperature after reaction of the paste and the whole drying operation is carried out under reduced pressure. During such drying, some flavouring agent pastes can behave in a disadvantageous manner. Some flavouring agent pastes, under the effect of being placed under vacuum, have in particular a tendency to squirt and/or to swell.<br>
Such an expansion can occur under the effect of gases which cannot escape from the paste which has become highly viscous under the drying conditions. Such an expansion highly limits the drying capacity of the oven since it is necessary to provide for spreading on the plates which takes into account the final volume of the cake. For some pastes, the spreading is only 5 kg of paste per m2 of plate.<br>
The present invention proposes to overcome these disadvantages.<br>
To this effect, in the process according to the present invention, a starch having a high gelatinization temperature is added to the paste as flavour carrier before it is dried. To dry it, it is preferably heated at 85-95°C for 20 minutes to 2 hours at atmospheric pressure, and the heating is continued at 70-95°C for 3 to 6 hours under reduced pressure.<br>
It was observed, surprisingly, that this process indeed made it possible to overcome the disadvantages of known processes without in any way<br><br>

Such an expansion highly limits the drying capacity of the oven since it is necessary to provide for spreading on the plates which takes into account the final volume of the cake. For some pastes, the spreading is only 5 kg of paste per n  of plate.<br><br>
The  present   invention  proposes   to  overcome   these disadvantages.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for preparing a dry flavouring agent paste comprising the steps of mixing atleast one free amino acid source, such as herein described, and atleast one reducing sugar, such as hereirv described, to form a pasty mixture; heating the pasty mixture to form a paste; adding a starch having a high gelatinization temperature to the paste as flavour carrier, heating the resulting paste to a tenperature of 85-95°C for 20 oinutes to 2 hours at atmospheric pressure and continuing the heating at 70-95°C for 3 to 6 hours under reduced pressure to obtain the dry flavouring agent paste.<br>
