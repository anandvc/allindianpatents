STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT RIGHTS<br>
[0001] This disclosure was produced pursuant to U.S. Government<br>
Contract No. DE-FC-04-03 AL67635 with the Department of Energy (DoE). The<br>
U.S. Government has certain rights in this disclosure.<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0002] This application claims the benefit of United States Provisional<br>
Patent Application No. 60/977,539, filed on October 4, 2007. The disclosure of<br>
the above application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0003] The present disclosure relates to particulate matter (PM) filters,<br>
and more particularly to power management of electrically-heated PM filters.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0004] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0005] Engines such as diesel engines produce particulate matter (PM)<br>
that is filtered from exhaust gas by a PM filter. The PM filter is disposed in an<br>
exhaust system of the engine. The PM filter reduces emission of PM that is<br>
generated during combustion.<br>
 <br>
[0006] Over time, the PM fitter becomes full. During regeneration, the<br>
PM may be burned within the PM filter. Regeneration may involve heating the<br>
PM filter to a combustion temperature of the PM. There are various ways to<br>
perform regeneration including modifying engine management, using a fuel<br>
burner, using a catalytic oxidizer to increase the exhaust temperature with after<br>
injection of fuel, using resistive heating coils, and/or using microwave energy.<br>
The resistive heating coils are typically arranged in contact with the PM filter to<br>
allow heating by both conduction and convection.<br>
[0007] Diesel PM combusts when temperatures above a combustion<br>
temperature such as 600 Â°C are attained. The start of combustion causes a<br>
further increase in temperature. While spark-ignited engines typically have low<br>
oxygen levels in the exhaust gas stream, diesel engines have significantly higher<br>
oxygen levels. While the increased oxygen levels make fast regeneration of the<br>
PM filter possible, it may also pose some problems.<br>
[0008] PM reduction systems that use fuel tend to decrease fuel<br>
economy. For example, many fuel-based PM reduction systems decrease fuel<br>
economy by 5%. Electrically heated PM reduction systems reduce fuel economy<br>
by a negligible amount. However, durability of the electrically heated PM<br>
reduction systems has been difficult to achieve. Also, power to electrically heat<br>
the PM can be significant.<br>
 <br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0009] In one example embodiment, a system is provided that includes<br>
a particulate matter (PM) filter with multiple zones, an electric heater and a<br>
control module. The electrical heater includes heater segments, which each<br>
correspond with a respective one of the zones. The electrical healer is arranged<br>
upstream from and is proximate with the PM filter. The control module<br>
selectively applies a first energy level to a first one of the zones via a first one <br>
the heater segments to initiate regeneration in the first zone. The control module<br>
also selectively applies a second energy level that is less than the first energy<br>
level to a second one of the zones via a second one of the healer segments to<br>
initiate regeneration in the second zone.<br>
[0010] In other features, a method is provided that includes providing a<br>
particulate matter (PM) filter with zones. An electrical heater that includes heater<br>
segments, which each correspond with a respective one of the zones, is<br>
arranged upstream from and proximate with the PM filter. A first energy level is<br>
selectively applied to a first one of the zones via a first one of the heater<br>
segments to initiate regeneration in the first zone. A second energy level that is<br>
less than the first energy level is selectively applied to a second one of the zones<br>
via a second one of the heater segments to initiate regeneration in the second<br>
zone.<br>
[0011] In still other features, a system is provided that includes a<br>
particulate matter (PM) filter with zones, an electric heater and a control module.<br>
The electrical heater includes heater segments, which each correspond with a<br>
 <br>
respective one of the zones. The electrical heater is arranged upstream from<br>
and proximate with the PM filter. A control module regenerates the zones by<br>
selectively applying a different energy level to each of the zones.<br>
[0012] Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the<br>
description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and<br>
specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0024] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses. It should be<br>
understood that throughout the drawings, corresponding reference numerals<br>
indicate like or corresponding parts and features.<br>
[0025] As used herein, the term module refers to an Application<br>
Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a processor (shared,<br>
dedicated, or group) and memory that execute one or more software or firmware<br>
programs, a combinational logic circuit, and/or other suitable components that<br>
provide the described functionality.<br>
[0026] The present disclosure increases input exhaust temperature<br>
before performing regeneration using an electrical heater to enable more robust<br>
PM filter regeneration. For example only, the inlet exhaust temperature may be<br>
 <br>
raised above maximum exhaust gas temperature at the PM filter encountered<br>
during normal operation and less than a soot oxidation temperature. The<br>
temperature of the exhaust gas entering an inlet of the PM filter may be<br>
increased by modifying engine management, using a fuel burner, using a<br>
catalytic oxidizer to increase the exhaust temperature with after injection of fuel,<br>
and/or other suitable approaches.<br>
[0027] For example only, the exhaust temperature may be raised to a<br>
temperature range between 340 to 540 degrees Celsius. This temperature range<br>
is lower than typical soot oxidation temperature but higher than the natural<br>
exhaust temperature. Typically, high efficiency engines operate cooler than about<br>
300 degrees Celsius.<br>
[0028] Once the exhaust gas temperature to the PM fitter is raised, the<br>
electrical heater activates heated zones, which causes a soot combustion wave<br>
to travel down the PM filter channel to clean the filter. This process continues<br>
until all of the heater zones are regenerated. When PM filter regeneration is run<br>
with an inlet exhaust temperature in this increased temperature range described<br>
herein, the combustion flamefronts are less likely to be extinguished. The<br>
increased inlet exhaust temperature also creates a smaller temperature delta,<br>
which reduces thermal stress forces on the PM filter.<br>
[0029] The electrical heater can be zoned or unzoned. The electrical<br>
heater may be in contact with or spaced from the PM filter. The heater<br>
selectively heats all or portions of the PM filter. The PM filter may be in contact<br>
with or mounted close enough to the front of the PM filter to control the heating<br>
 <br>
pattern. The length of the heater may be set to optimize the exhaust gas<br>
temperature.<br>
[0030] Thermal energy is transmitted from the electric heater to the PM<br>
filter. The PM filter may be heated by convection and/or conduction. The<br>
electrical heater may be divided in zones to reduce electrical power required to<br>
heat the PM filter. The zones also heat selected downstream portions within the<br>
PM filter. By heating only the selected portions of the filter, the magnitude of<br>
forces in the substrate is reduced due to thermal expansion. As a result, higher<br>
localized soot temperatures may be used during regeneration without damaging<br>
the PM filter.<br>
[0031] The PM filter may be regenerated by selectively heating one or<br>
more of the zones in the front of the PM filter and igniting the soot using the<br>
heated exhaust gas. When a sufficient face temperature is reached, the heater<br>
may be turned off and the burning soot then cascades down the length of the PM<br>
filter channel, which is similar to a burning fuse on a firework. The burning soot<br>
is the fuel that continues the regeneration. This process is continued for each<br>
heating zone until the PM filter is completely regenerated.<br>
[0032] The heater zones may be spaced in a manner such that thermal<br>
stress is mitigated between active heaters. Therefore, the overall stress forces<br>
due to heating are smaller and distributed over the volume of the entire<br>
electrically heated PM filter. This approach allows regeneration in larger<br>
segments of the electrically heated PM filter without creating thermal stresses<br>
that damage the electrically heated PM filter.<br>
 <br>
[0033] A largest temperature gradient tends to occur at edges of the<br>
zoned heaters. Therefore, activating one heater past the localized stress zone of<br>
another heater enables more actively heated regeneration volume without an<br>
increase in overall stress. This tends to improve the regeneration opportunity<br>
within a drive cycle and reduces cost and complexity since the system does not<br>
need to regenerate as many zones independently.<br>
[0034] Referring now to FIG. 1, an exemplary diesel engine system 10<br>
is schematically illustrated in accordance with the present disclosure. It is<br>
appreciated that the diesel engine system 10 is merely exemplary in nature and<br>
that the zone heated particulate filter regeneration system described herein can<br>
be implemented in various engine systems implementing a particulate fitter.<br>
Such engine systems may include, but are not limited to, gasoline direct injection<br>
engine systems and homogeneous charge compression ignition engine systems.<br>
For ease of the discussion, the disclosure will be discussed in the context of a<br>
diesel engine system.<br>
[0035] The engine system 10 includes a power distribution system 11<br>
that manages power to an electric heater 35. The power distribution system 11<br>
includes a control module 44, a power source 46, a power switch module 47 and<br>
the electric heater 35, which has heater segments that are associated with zones<br>
of a particulate matter (PM) filter 34. Example heater segments are shown in<br>
FIG. 4. The control module 44 includes a pulse width modulation (PWM) module<br>
49 that controls energy including power and duration of applied power to the<br>
heater segments. The power switch module 47 may be a power distribution box<br>
 <br>
that includes relays and/or switches 51, which are associated with the hotter<br>
segments. The control module 44 provides control signals to the switches as to<br>
allow power from the power source 46 to be transferred to the selected heater<br>
segments.<br>
[0036] A turbocharged diesel engine system 10 includes an engine 12<br>
that combusts an air and fuel mixture to produce drive torque. Air entran the<br>
system by passing through an air filter 14. Air passes through the air filter 14 and<br>
is drawn into a turbocharger 18. The turbocharger 18 compresses the teech air<br>
entering the system 10. The greater the compression of the air generally, the<br>
greater the output of the engine 12. Compressed air then passes through an<br>
cooler 20 before entering into an intake manifold 22.<br>
[0037] Air within the intake manifold 22 is distributed into cylinders 26.<br>
Although four cylinders 26 are illustrated, the systems and methods of the<br>
present disclosure can be implemented in engines having a plurality of cylinders<br>
including, but not limited to, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 and 12 cylinders. It is also<br>
appreciated that the systems and methods of the present disclosure can be<br>
implemented in a V-type cylinder configuration. Fuel is injected into the cylinders<br>
26 by fuel injectors 28. Heat from the compressed air ignites the air/fuel mixture.<br>
Combustion of the air/fuel mixture creates exhaust. Exhaust exits the cylinders<br>
26 into the exhaust system.<br>
[0038] The exhaust system includes an exhaust manifold 30, a diesel<br>
oxidation catalyst (DOC) 32, and a particulate filter (PM filter) assembly 34 with<br>
an inlet heater 35. The heater 35 may be zoned. Optionally, an EGR valve (not<br>
 <br>
shown) re-circulates a portion of the exhaust back into the intake manifold 22.<br>
The remainder of the exhaust is directed into the turbocharger 18 to drive a<br>
turbine. The turbine facilitates the compression of the fresh air received from the<br>
air filter 14. Exhaust flows from the turbocharger 18 through the DOC 32,<br>
through the heater 35 and into the PM filter assembly 34. The DOC 32 oxidizes<br>
the exhaust based on the post combustion air/fuel ratio. The amount of oxidation<br>
increases the temperature of the exhaust. The PM filter assembly 34 receives<br>
exhaust from the DOC 32 and filters any soot particulates present in the exhaust.<br>
The inlet heater 35 is in contact with or spaced from the PM filter assembly 34<br>
and heats the exhaust to a regeneration temperature as will be described below.<br>
[0039] A control module 44 controls the engine and PM filter<br>
regeneration based on various sensed and/or estimated information. The<br>
sensed information may come from the sensors 53 or may be estimated based<br>
on sensed information and operating state of the engine system 10.<br>
[0040] The sensors may include temperature sensors, engine sensors<br>
and modules, air-related sensors, and pressure sensors. The sensors may<br>
include sensors for determining exhaust flow levels, exhaust temperature levels,<br>
exhaust pressure levels, oxygen levels, intake air flow rates, intake air pressure,<br>
intake air temperature, engine speed, EGR, etc.<br>
[0041] The temperature sensors may include an intake temperature<br>
sensor, an engine coolant temperature sensor, an engine oil temperature sensor,<br>
exhaust gas temperature sensors, PM filter temperature sensors, an ambient<br>
temperature sensor, and may include other engine temperature sensors. The<br>
 <br>
intake air temperature sensor may generate an intake air temperature (IAT)<br>
signal. The engine coolant temperature sensor may generate an engine coolant<br>
temperature (ECT) signal. The engine oil temperature sensor may generate an<br>
engine oil temperature (TOIL) signal. The exhaust gas temperature sensors may<br>
generate inlet, internal and outlet exhaust temperature signals associated with a<br>
PM filter. The ambient temperature sensor may generate an ambient<br>
temperature (AMB) signal.<br>
[0042] The engine sensors and modules may include a cylinder air<br>
evaluation module, an engine output torque sensor or module, an engine load<br>
module, an engine runtime indicator, an engine speed sensor. The cylinder air<br>
evaluation module determines status of air within cylinders of an engine. The<br>
status may include, for example, flow rate and cylinder air mass. The cylinder air<br>
evaluation module determines the status based on air-related signals generated<br>
by the air sensors and engine output torque. The engine output torque may be<br>
directly or indirectly measured or estimated. The engine output torque may be<br>
directly measure via one or more sensors, such as a drive shaft torque sensor, a<br>
strain gauge, or other torque sensor. The engine output torque may be indirectly<br>
estimated based on engine operating parameters some of which are disclosed<br>
herein, for example, using a look-up table. The engine speed sensor, such as a<br>
camshaft, crankshaft, flywheel or transmission sensor, generates speed signal<br>
that is indicative of engine speed RPM. The control module can determined<br>
engine speed from the speed signal. Note that the engine speed may also be<br>
indirectly estimated based on engine operating parameters.<br>
 <br>
[0043] The air sensors may include an air flow sensor, a throttle<br>
position sensor, an intake air pressure sensor, and may include other air-related<br>
sensors. An air flow sensor may be a mass air flow (MAF) sensor that monitors<br>
the air flow rate through a throttle. The throttle position sensor is responsive to a<br>
position of a throttle plate and generates a throttle position signal TPS. The<br>
intake air pressure sensor generates a manifold absolute pressure (MAP) signal.<br>
[0044] The pressure sensors may be responsive to atmospheric<br>
pressure and may generate a barometric pressure BARO signal.<br>
[0045] More specifically, the control module 44 estimates loading of the<br>
PM filter assembly 34 based on the sensed and estimated information. When<br>
the estimated loading is at a predetermined level and the exhaust flow rate is<br>
within a desired range, current may be controlled to the PM filter assembly 34 via<br>
a power source 46 to initiate the regeneration process. The duration of the<br>
regeneration process may be varied based upon the estimated amount of<br>
particulate matter within the PM filter assembly 34.<br>
[0046] Current is applied to the heater 35 during the regeneration<br>
process. More specifically, the energy may heat selected zones of the heater 35<br>
of the PM filter assembly 34 for predetermined periods, respectively. Exhaust<br>
gas passing through the heater 35 is heated by the activated zones. The heated<br>
exhaust gas travels to the downstream filter of PM filter assembly 34 and heats<br>
the filter by convection and/or conduction. The remainder of the regeneration<br>
process may be achieved using the heat generated by the hearted exhaust<br>
passing through the PM filter.<br>
 <br>
[0047] Referring now to FIG. 2, an exemplary zoned inlet heater 35 for<br>
the PM filter assembly 34 is shown. The electrically heated PM fitter assembly<br>
34 is arranged spaced from or in contact with the PM filter assembly 34. The PIug<br>
filter assembly 34 includes multiple spaced heater zones including zone 1 (will<br>
sub-zones 1A, 1B and 1C), zone 2 (with sub-zones 2A, 2B and 2C) and zone 3<br>
(with sub-zones 3A, 3B and 3C). The zones 1, 2 and 3 may be activated during<br>
different respective periods.<br>
[0048] As exhaust gas flows through the activated zones of the heater,<br>
regeneration occurs in the corresponding portions of the PM fitter that initially<br>
received the heated exhaust gas (e.g. areas downstream from the activated<br>
zones) or downstream areas that are ignited by cascading burning soot. The<br>
corresponding portions of the PM filter that are not downstream from an activated<br>
zone act as stress mitigation zones. For example in FIG. 2, sub-zones 1A, 1B<br>
and 1C are activated and sub-zones 2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, and 3C act as stress<br>
mitigation zones.<br>
[0049] The corresponding portions of the PM filter downstream from<br>
the active heater sub-zones 1A, 1B and 1C thermally expand and contract during<br>
heating and cooling. The stress mitigation sub-zones 2A and 3A, 2B and 3B,<br>
and 2C and 3C mitigate stress caused by the expansion and contraction of the<br>
heater sub-zones 1A, 1B and 1C. After zone 1 has completed regeneration,<br>
zone 2 can be activated and zones 1 and 3 act as stress mitigation zones. After<br>
zone 2 has completed regeneration, zone 3 can be activated and zones 1 and 2<br>
act as stress mitigation zones.<br>
 <br>
[0050] Referring now to FIG. 3, another exemplary zoned inlet heater<br>
35" is shown. A center portion may be surrounded by a middle zone including a<br>
first circumferential band of zones. The middle portion may be surrounded by an<br>
outer portion including a second circumferential band of zones.<br>
[0051] In this example, the center portion includes zone 1. The first<br>
circumferential band of zones includes zones 2 and 3. The second<br>
circumferential band of zones comprises zones 1, 4 and 5 As with the<br>
embodiment described above, downstream portions from active zones are<br>
regenerated while downstream portions from inactive zones provide stress<br>
mitigation. As can be appreciated, one of the zones 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 can be<br>
activated at a time. Others of the zones remain inactivated.<br>
[0052] Referring now to FIG. 4, an exemplary resistive heater 200<br>
arranged adjacent to one of the zones (e.g. zone 3) from the first circumferential<br>
band of zones in FIG. 3 is shown. The resistive heater 200 may comprise one or<br>
more coils, heater segments, or conductive elements that cover the respective<br>
zone to provide sufficient heating. The resistive heater 200, as shown, includes<br>
three (3) heater segments 201, which are electrically conductive.<br>
[0053] Referring now to FIG. 5, the PM filter assembly 34 is shown in<br>
further detail. The PM filter assembly 34 includes a housing 200, a filter 202, and<br>
the zoned heater 35. The filter 202 may include a rear endplug 208. The heater<br>
35 may be arranged between a laminar flow element 210 and a substrate of the<br>
filter 202. An electrical connector 211 may provide current to the zones of the<br>
PM filter assembly 34 as described above.<br>
 <br>
[0054] As can be appreciated, the heater 35 may be in contact with or<br>
spaced from the fitter 202 such that the heating is convection and/or conduction<br>
heating. Insulation 212 may be arranged between the heater 35 and the housing<br>
200. Exhaust gas enters the PM filter assembly 34 from an upstream inlet 214<br>
and is heated by one or more zones of the PM filter assembly 34. The heated<br>
exhaust gas is received by the filter 202.<br>
[0055] Referring now to FIG. 6, heating within the PM filter assembly<br>
34 is shown in further detail. Exhaust gas 250 passes through the heater 35 and<br>
is heated by one or more zones of the heater 35. If spaced from the filter 202,<br>
the heated exhaust gas travels a distance "d" and is then received by the filter<br>
202. For example only, the distance "d" may be Â½" or less. The filter 202 may<br>
have a central inlet 240, a channel 242, filter material 244 and an outlet 246<br>
located radially outside of the inlet. The filter may be catalyzed. The heated<br>
exhaust gas causes PM in the filter to burn, which regenerates the PM filter. The<br>
heater 35 transfers heat by convection and/or conduction to ignite a front portion<br>
of the filter 202. When the soot in the front face portions reaches a sufficiently<br>
high temperature, the heater is turned off. Combustion of soot then cascades<br>
down a filter channel 254 without requiring power to be maintained to the heater.<br>
[0056] Referring now to FIG. 7, control begins in step 300. In step 304,<br>
control determines whether regeneration is needed. If step 308, control<br>
determines whether the input exhaust temperature to the PM filter is greater than<br>
a first temperature threshold TTH1. The first temperature threshold TTH1 may be<br>
greater than a normal exhaust gas temperature encountered during normal<br>
 <br>
engine operation and less than soot oxidation temperatures. For example only,<br>
the first temperature threshold TTH1 may be selected in the range between 340-<br>
540 degrees Celsius. For example only, the temperature threshold TTH1 may be<br>
selected in the range between 390-490 degrees Celsius. For example only, the<br>
temperature threshold TTH1 may be selected in the range between 430-470<br>
degrees Celsius. For example only, the temperature threshold TTH1 may be<br>
selected to be approximately 440-460 degrees Celsius. As used herein, the term<br>
"about" means +/- 5 degrees Celsius.<br>
[0057] If step 308 is false, the engine control module increases the<br>
exhaust temperature using any suitable approach in step 312. Control continues<br>
from steps 312 and 308 (if true) with step 316. If step 316 is true, control<br>
determines whether the PM filter temperature is greater than a second<br>
temperature threshold TTH1. If step 316 is true, control executes PM filter<br>
regeneration control. Control continues from steps 316 (if false) and step 320<br>
with step 324.<br>
[0058] For example only, regeneration temperature in the PM filter may<br>
be set to approximately greater than or equal to 600 degrees Celsius. For<br>
example only, regeneration temperature in the PM filter may be set to<br>
approximately greater than or equal to 700 degrees Celsius. For example only,<br>
regeneration temperature in the PM filter may be set to approximately greater<br>
than or equal to 800 degrees Celsius. In one embodiment a target temperature<br>
is set at 900 degrees Celsius. Heater segment temperatures may be set at<br>
approximately equal to or greater than the above stated temperatures.<br>
 <br>
[0059] Referring now to FIG. 8, exemplary steps for regenerating a<br>
zoned PM filter are shown. In step 400, control begins and proceeds to step 404.<br>
If control determines that regeneration is needed in step 404, control selects one<br>
or more zones in step 408.<br>
[0060] In step 412, control estimates energy sufficient to achieve a<br>
minimum filter face temperature. The estimated energy includes power and a<br>
heating period to apply a fixed or variable power level to the selected zone or to<br>
selected portions thereof. The estimated energy is based on at least one of<br>
power, including current and voltage, the predetermined period, exhaust flow and<br>
exhaust temperature. The estimated energy may also be based on the cross-<br>
sectional area associated with the heater segments, the number of zones,<br>
resistive characteristics associated with the zones, and other factors, some of<br>
which are described herein. The estimated energy level may be determined<br>
based on pressure drop across the PM filter from inlet to outlet, as is described<br>
below.<br>
[0061] The variation in flow distribution across the zones may be used<br>
to estimate the energy level to be supplied. The minimum face temperature<br>
should be sufficient to start the soot burning and to create a cascading effect.<br>
For example only, the minimum face temperature may be set to 700 degrees<br>
Celsius or greater. The power may be determined based on the predetermined<br>
period or vice versa.<br>
[0062] In step 416, control activates the heater for the selected zone<br>
based on the estimated energy and corresponding power and predetermined<br>
 <br>
period for application of that power. The heater segments associated with the<br>
selected zone are activated. As an example, a first energy level having an<br>
associated first power level is applied to the heater segments for a first<br>
predetermined period of time (duration of applied power). For example, the<br>
control module 44 may signal the power switch module 47 to provide power to<br>
the heater segments. A pulse width modulated signal may be generated by the<br>
control module 44 and provided to the power switch module 47 and adjusted to<br>
provide the determined energy level.<br>
[0063] In step 418, control determines whether the predetermined<br>
heating period is up. If step 418 is true, control determines whether additional<br>
zones need to be regenerated in step 420. If step 420 is true, control proceeds<br>
to step 422, otherwise control ends at step 428.<br>
[0064] In step 422, control selects another zone for regeneration. In<br>
step 424, control estimates energy to apply to the heater segments associated<br>
with the selected zone of step 422. The estimated energy level may be<br>
determined similar to the process of step 412. The estimated energy level is less<br>
than the energy level applied to a previously activated zone and/or the first zone<br>
activated in step 416. To provide a decreased energy level, power or the<br>
duration that the power is applied may be decreased. Control accounts for the<br>
number of regenerated and non-regenerated zones when determining flow<br>
distribution. Thus, a second or subsequent power level may be applied that is<br>
less than a previous and/or the first power level. As an alternative or in<br>
combination with a decrease in power a second or subsequent predetermined<br>
 <br>
time may be determined that is less than a previous and/or the first<br>
predetermined time. In step 426, control activates the selected zone of step 422<br>
by applying a corresponding power level for a duration of time to provide the<br>
energy level determined in step 424.<br>
[0065] The above-described steps are meant to be illustrative<br>
examples; the steps may be performed sequentially, synchronously,<br>
simultaneously, continuously, during overlapping time periods or in a different<br>
order depending upon the application.<br>
[0066] Referring now to FIG. 9, an example graph illustrating<br>
redistribution of flow during regeneration of a PM filter. The graph includes flow<br>
for each regenerative state during regeneration of a ftve (5) zones PM filter is<br>
shown. Five regenerative states are shown. For each of the five states five bars<br>
are shown. Each bar is associated with a particular zone of the PM fitter.<br>
[0067] The first state is associated with the PM filter prior to<br>
regeneration when the five zones are loaded or substantially loaded with soot.<br>
The second state is associated with when a first zone has been regenerated.<br>
Thus, the flow in the first zone increased, as shown. Since the flow in the first<br>
zone increases, the flow in the other zones decreases. The decrease in flow rate<br>
allows for application of a decreased energy level for regeneration of the non-<br>
regenerated zones. When a zone is regenerated, the lack of soot in that zone<br>
causes a drop in flow resistance leading to a higher flow. Zones that are<br>
generated later have the benefit of reduced flow, due to their high flow resistance<br>
 <br>
caused by the soot buildup. Reduced flow helps to transfer energy from an<br>
electric heater to exhaust gas and to the PM filter.<br>
[0068] The first zone regenerated may receive a maximum energy<br>
level and subsequent zones may receive a progressively less energy level. The<br>
distribution of energy and/or power may follow the distribution of flow.<br>
[0069] The third state is associated with when the first and second<br>
zones have been regenerated. Thus, the flow in the first and second zones<br>
decreases while the flow in the third, fourth and fifth zones decreases, as shown.<br>
The fourth and fifth states have similar progressive results as that of the third<br>
state.<br>
[0070] Referring now to FIG. 10, an example graph of energy input to<br>
each of the five zones of FIG. 9 is shown. The vertical axis is energy in<br>
percentage, where 100% corresponds to a maximum energy value. Five<br>
regenerative states are shown. For each of the five states two bars are shown.<br>
The first bar represents an example of when a uniform energy level is applied to<br>
each of the five zones. The second bar represents a progressively decreasing<br>
amount of energy that is applied to each of the five zones. The first state is<br>
associated with the PM filter prior to regeneration when the five zones are loaded<br>
or substantially loaded with soot. The second state is associated with when the<br>
first zone is regenerated. The third state is associated with when the second<br>
zone is regenerated. The fourth state is associated with when the third zone is<br>
regenerated. The fifth state is associated with when the fourth zone is<br>
regenerated.<br>
 <br>
[0071] The graphs of FIGs. 9 and 10 are examples of when the zones<br>
of a PM filter are modeled as separate linked PM fitters, each of which having<br>
approximately equal soot loading. Energy levels may be adjusted to account for<br>
unequal amounts of soot loading. The pressure drop across a PM filter for clean<br>
and loaded zones can be represented as a function of various factors. Primary<br>
factors may include flow and soot loading.<br>
[0072] For example, pressure drop of a clean PM filter may be<br>
represented as provided by equation [1]. The linear term represents the<br>
pressure losses due to channel flow and the Darcy's term for flow through a soot<br>
layer and a PM filter wall. The quadratic term represents the losses due to<br>
expansion and contraction at PM filter inlet and exit of the PM filter, and the 2nd<br>
order inertial losses through the wall.<br>
 <br>
Also provided as an example, pressure drop across a PM filter loaded with soot<br>
(cake layer) is provided by equation [2].<br>

[0073] It may be assumed that the zones of the PM filter have the<br>
approximately the same pressure drop. Thus, the flow adjusts such that the<br>
pressure drop through a clean section is the same as the pressure drop across a<br>
loaded section. Equations 1 and 2 may be used to calculate flow, as the zones<br>
are regenerated. Control may also account for temperature differences between<br>
the zones.<br>
[0074] To calculate the energy to apply to the zones, it may be<br>
assumed that the electric heater and/or heater segments are in steady state.<br>
The total energy put into the electric heater is proportional to the total energy<br>
transferred to the gas phase. Thus, energy is approximately equal to a constant<br>
multiplied by the flow rate further multiplied by the exhaust gas temperature.<br>
With increased flow rate, more energy is provided to the electric heater to heat<br>
up the exhaust gas to a predetermined temperature. Conversely, when flow rate<br>
decreases, due to there being another preferential pathway for the exhaust gas,<br>
 <br>
namely the cleaned section, a decreased amount of energy is provided to heat<br>
up the exhaust gas to the same predetermined temperature.<br>
[0075] The above-described embodiments reduce the amount of power<br>
drawn from a power source, such as a battery, during regeneration of a PM filter.<br>
The embodiments reduce power consumption of an electric heater used to<br>
regenerate a PM filter. The embodiments also improve substrate/PM filter<br>
durability as each zone of the PM filter receives the appropriate amount of<br>
energy for regeneration.<br>
[0076] The present disclosure tends to improve regeneration of PM<br>
filters. The approach described herein tends to reduce thermal delta and<br>
therefore improves substrate durability. Force due to thermal expansion and<br>
contraction is defined as ï¡ïTE(Area) where ï¡ is a coefficient of expansion, E is<br>
Young's Modulus, Area is perimeter area and is equal to ELD, and AT is the<br>
temperature delta. As can be appreciated, increasing exhaust gas temperature<br>
before using the electrical heaters reduces AT, which reduces force due to<br>
thermal expansion and contraction. The present disclosure also tends to provide<br>
more consistent heating patterns and to reduce flameout.<br>
[0077] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the foregoing<br>
description that the broad teachings of the present invention can be implemented<br>
in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this invention has been described in<br>
connection with particular examples thereof, the true scope of the invention<br>
should not be so limited since other modifications will become apparent to the<br>
 <br>
skilled practitioner upon a study of the drawings, the specification and the<br>
