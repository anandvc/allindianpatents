				<td>This invention related to an apparatus for power generation from ocean tides / Wave motion for converting the kinetic energy present in the ocean tides / Waves into a rotational movement for getting electricity.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION:-<br>
This Invention relates to power generation and more specifically to a novel and a new system of converting the Kinetic Energy present in the Ocean Tides / Waves into a rotational movement for getting Electricity.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:-<br>
There have been concerns regarding the limited resources of conventional combustible hydrocarbon fuel sources and the damaging emissions that result from their use. This has prompted a great deal of research work into use of sustainable non-polluting energy sources, such as Tides/ Waves, Wind Geo-Thermal, Solar etc.<br>
The waves are ultimately a product of Solar energy. Waves are one of the most concentrated and consistent sources of renewable energy. When compared to conventional fossil fuel generation, Wave energy offers the double benefits of near limitless free supply and a total lack of environmentally polluting emissions.<br>
Although the total amount of wave energy of the oceans is of immense proportions, each individual wave is of restricted length and of short duration and its energy content is little. Hence the successful utilization of wave energy needs solution of three problems. The first is the problem of capturing the energy of the waves and transferring it to installed machines. The second and more important problem is the consolidation of the energy of successive waves arising in a place. The third and most important is the consolidation of the energy of waves over a long distance of the coast.<br>
There is also a need to develop a simple system which has minimum parts and require minimum maintenance.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
A number   of different types of power generation systems have been proposed for commercial electrical generation. There are three basic systems for wave energy conversion.<br>
1.       Surge or Focussing  devices that channel the Ocean waves  into Reservoirs.<br><br>
2.	Surface followers that use floats or pitching devices that drive hydraulic pumps. And,<br>
3.	Oscillating water column systems that use the waves to compress air within a container.<br>
The mechanical power created from these systems either directly run a generator or transfer to a working fluid - Water or air which then drives a Turbine - Generator. The main deficiencies with wave driven air Turbine systems, is the restricted overall achievable energy efficiencies. This is primarily due to the limitations, firstly in the means of focusing the wave energy to maximum the wave displacement amplitude and secondly deficiencies inherent in the turbine designs.<br>
A number of prior art wave energy focusing devices have relived on planer reflection of the wave front and / or the wave front is channeled through a narrow opening so that the vertical displacement or amplitude of the wave is magnified. Some other focusing devices have various means to change the formation of the seabed. This disrupts the wave propagation and the amplitude of the wave is maximized at a predetermined location.<br>
In the surface followers that use floats or pitching devices, the floats or pitching devices are connected to ropes or cables and these in turn are connected to either to pumps or to ratchet mechanisms so as to turn electrical generators when the floats are either rising or falling.<br>
Also, the floats may drive hydraulic pumps or pistons and this kinetic energy is used to drive a turbine. Ex. Sea Power and Associates" wave Rider.<br>
Underwater turbines capture the movement of the Ocean"s currents and use this energy to drive slow moving blades. These in turn, power a generator like an under water Wind Mill. Example:- Blue energy"s Davis Hydro Turbine.<br>
Those devices having pulleys and cables near or below the water surface and connected to floats or paddles are subjected to the destructive and corrosive power, which sand and salt water have. Continued back and forth motion of a cable through a pulley in an under water environment will require frequent maintenance which may be very costley.<br>
All these above involves a lot of expenditure. The object of the present invention is to overcome all the disadvantages of the prior art and be a useful alternative thereof.<br>
In the present invention, the vertical movement of the waves is translated into a rotatory movement, so as to directly or indirectly drive a generator. In each<br><br>
unit of this invention, only a small height of the four pillars and the lower surface of the float are in contact with the sea water. Rest of all the equipment is above the water, thus over coming a number of problems seen in the prior art. The pillars that are in contact with the ocean water and the parts of the float that are in contact with the ocean water, only require regular maintenance.<br>
The British Patent GB 1515744 discloses a device for utilizing Wave Energy. However it has not been tried practically and this patent does not work as desired for the following reasons.<br>
1.	The two rack supports cannot freely slide the rack with gear teeth.<br>
2.	The continuous side way forces acting on the float would bend the rack and disengage it from the gear wheel.<br>
3.	The submerged spherical float would have wave energy acting equally on its upper and lower hemispheres. This would make the upward movement of the float with the wave, sluggish.<br>
4.	the spherical float is free to rotate on its axis i.e., the rack. Thus the wave energy forces acting on the float would rotate and dislodge the gear teeth of the rack from the wheel gear.<br>
5.	Gear box construction and its connection to a generator is not described.<br>
6.	There is no provision for interconnecting hundreds or thousands of these devices to run large generators.<br>
7.	There is no mechanism described to produce grid quality power.<br>
The US patent 4, 145, 885 dated March 27, 1979 discloses a device for utilizing Ocean Wave Energy. However, it has not been tried practically and this patent does not work as desired for the following reasons.<br>
1.	The shape of the float is not ideal for movement and its movement would be sluggish.<br>
2.	The rack alone supports the float and it would get bent due to the side way movement of the float. The rack needs to be very strong to prevent this and be of great length to accommodate high amplitude waves and tsumani waves. All these demand a sturdy and very long rack which would add up to heavy weight of the rack and the float may not be able to lift the rack.<br>
3.	The rack would hit the ceiling due to high amplitude waves and tsumani waves.<br>
4.	The rack hinges to the transverse arm which is pivoted. The rack at its hinge with the transverse arm would move in an arc when the float is lifted and thus would get bent.<br>
5.	The toothed wheel "42" needs to be of very great diameter to accommodate the movement of the rack.<br>
6.	The rack should have grooved wheels behind it to keep it coupled to the pinion gears.<br><br>
7.	the rack is supported by cylindrical structures on either side of bar gear teeth of the rack. This would cause sluggish movement of the rack due to friction.<br>
8.	The civil construction is difficult to withstand the waves.<br>
9.	There is no means to regulate the speed of the output shaft. This patent will not work as desired.<br>
The present invention overcomes all the problems cited above. This invention had been tried practically on Machilipatnam Coast, Krishna District, A.P India and Electric Power produced.<br>
This ocean wave energy conversion system is competitive with fossil fuels and is useful in large number of coastal areas throughout the world all through the year.<br>
OBJECTIVES OF THE INVENTION<br>
The objects of this invention is to provide an apparatus for harnessing the ocean wave energy efficiently.<br>
Another object of the invention is to construct the power generating system in the most appropriate location to maximize the effect of the ocean waves.<br>
One more object of the invention is to set up a power generating system expeditiously and economically.<br>
Furthermore, another object of the invention is to place all the generating systems out of the water much above the ocean surface.<br>
Further, the novel feature of this invention, the object and advantages will be known, in part in the following detailed description and in part will become apparent upon examination by those skilled in the art or through practice of the invention.<br>
The ocean and energy conversion system has a low initial investment cost, can be easily expandable to meet the rising demand for energy and also requires minimal maintenance.<br>
Further more, the objects and advantages of this invention will become apparent from the following description and the accompanying annexed drawings.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The apparatus for power generation from ocean tide / wave motion, is a system for harnessing the energy of ocean tides / waves to produce useful energy — electricity. This consists of a number of floats. (See Fig.3). Each float along with its gear system may be considered as a unit. Concrete pillars (A) (Fig. 1), built on the sea bed in 3 feet to 10 feet or more depth of the sea. Each float has centrifugal pumps to pump in or pump out water from it (E&amp;F) (See Fig. 3).The float has two frames, one above and one below the float. Each frame has, two wheels placed at right angles to each other, at each of the four corners of the frame. The wheels slide on the pillars enabling the float to move smoothly vertically up and down with the wave with in the confines of the four pillars. The inner shaft of a vertically placed hydraulic jack (G) (Fig.3) is connected to the gravitational center of the float. The outer socket of the hydraulic jack (G)(Fig 3) is connected to a rod(C) (Fig 4). The rod has on one side a bar with gear teeth (D) (Fig 4 ). The gear teeth of the bar engages a pinion gear on a horizontal shaft which is placed in the same direction as the waves incident on the float.(Z,G) (Fig 12)<br>
Type 1. (First Embodiment) Gearbox (Fig. 5, Fig.6)<br>
(See Fig 5) The horizontal shaft (Ff) has two free-wheels placed on the shaft in reverse directions, so that in which ever direction the shaft Ff is rotated, it gets engaged. Gears of the same size are mounted on each free wheel. One free wheel gear (J) engages a wheel gear of the same size on a second shaft (C). This second shaft I also has a second wheel gear which is unengaged (D).<br>
The second free wheel gear (K) engages a wheel gear (F) of the same size on a third shaft (G). the third shaft (G) also has another unengaged wheel gear (E). The two unengaged wheel gears (D) &amp; (E) on the second and third shafts engage each other as shown by arrows in fig. 5. The sizes of the wheel gears on the three shafts may also be such that they engage one another and all the three shafts moving on ball bearings, move in unison. All the three shafts(H,G,I) (Fig 8) with their wheel gears placed in a box and are lubricated by gear oil.<br>
Thus in whichever direction, the first shaft (H) having the free wheels is moved, the second and third shafts move in only one direction.<br>
When a number of units are there, one behind the other in a row, the second shaft connects with the corresponding 2nd shaft of the next unit behind or the third shaft connects with the corresponding third shaft of the next unit behind. Here , the same incident wave after lifting the first float, lifts the 2nd float behind and the third float behind etc., till all its energy is used in   lifting the<br><br>
floats. The units may be placed one immediately behind the other or at a distance between them. A number of units may be placed in several rows along the length of the coast.<br>
Type 2. (Second Embodiment) Gearbox (Fig.7,Fig.8)<br>
The gearbox has two compartments (A)&amp;(B) The horizontal shaft (H) has two sets (C) &amp; (D) of toothed wheels. The two sets of toothed wheels occupy one compartment each. The toothed wheels in a set may be of the same size or of different sizes.<br>
In compartment A, there is a shaft (I) on which a set of free-wheels (E), all placed in the same direction of movement are present. The set of toothed wheels (C) on shaft (H) move the set of toothed wheels (E) on shaft I, by chain loops. The shaft I has a gear "a" which moves the gear "b" on shaft J which in turn moves the gear "c" on shaft G.<br>
In compartment B, there is a shaft (K) on which are a set of free-wheels (F) all placed in the same direction (But in opposite direction to the free-wheels E on the shaft I in compartment A). Chain loops connect and move the toothed wheels D on shaft H and the free-wheels on shaft K. There is a gear "e" on the shaft K which moves the gear "f on shaft G. The fly wheel "i" is placed on shaft G.<br>
Type 3 (Third Embodiment) Gearbox (Fig.9, Fig.10)<br>
The horizontal shaft H   has two set (C )&amp; (D) of toothed wheels. The toothed wheels in a set may be of the same size or of different sizes.<br>
In the gearbox, there is another shaft G on which there is a set of free¬wheels (E) all placed in the same direction of movement. The set of toothed wheels C on shaft H move the set of free-wheels E on shaft G with chain loops.<br>
In the gearbox there is a third shaft K on which are a set of free wheels F, all placed in the same direction of movement (But in opposite direction to the movement of the free-wheels E on the shaft G) The set of toothed wheels D on shaft H move the set of free-wheels F on shaft K through chain loops. The shaft K has a gear "e" which moves the gear "f on shaft G. The fly wheel "i" is placed on shaft G.<br>
Type 4(Fourth Embodiment) Gearbox (Please see Fig.10 "a", 10 "b\ 10 "c\ 10<br>
"d\ 10 "e\ 10 T,10 "g",10 "h", 10 "i\ 10 "j")<br>
(See fig. 10 "a") The rod with the gear-teeth on its side (a.b) moves a pinion gear "Z\ The pinion gear "Z" is on a horizontal shaft (H). This horizontal<br><br>
shaft H slides up or down in the slots Ql and Q2 (Fig. 10 "C") of the plates J and K(Fig.lO"b").<br>
The Shaft of the pinion gear "Z" slides up in slots Ql and Q2 due to the upward motion of the rod with gear teeth "ab" (due to the upward push of the float) and engages the gear C only on the shaft G (and disengages the gear D on shaft I). The shaft G of the gear C has another gear E on it.<br>
The shaft H of the pinion gear Z slides down in the slots Ql and Q2 due to the down ward motion of the rod with gear teeth "ab" (due to the downward fall of the float) and engages the gear D only on the shaft I ( and disengages the gear C on shaft G). The shaft I of the gear D has another gear F on it.<br>
The size of gears E and F are bigger than gears C and D. The gears E and F engage each other.<br>
The flywheel "i" is on shaft G or I (Fig. 10 "b").<br>
Mechanism To Slide the Shaft H Up or Down In the Slots Ql and Q2 of The Plates J and K.   (Please see Fig. 10 "g") :--<br>
The shaft H has two more gears T and U on either side of the pinion gear z. These gears (T and U) may be on the inside or outside of the slots Ql and Q2 of the plates J and K. (See Fig. 10 "b").<br>
The size of the gear teeth of these gears (T and U) is of the same size as the size of the gear teeth on the pinion gear Z.<br>
Each of these gears (T and U) move up or down on small strips of bar gear teeth X and Y.<br>
The arrangement of the gears T and U on the strips of bar gear teeth X and Y are such that when the gear teeth of gears T and U step-off the gear teeth of the strips of bar gear teeth X and Y, the pinion gear Z engages and moves the gear<br>
C. The slots Ql and Q2 limit the further upward movement of the shaft H of the pinion gear Z. The two gears T and U are moved down on the small strips of gear teeth X and Y by the pinion gear Z (which in tern is moved down by the rod with gear-teeth "ab" due to the fall of the float). When the gears T and U step-off the small strips of gear teeth X and Y, the pinion gear Z engages and moves the gear D. The slots Ql and Q2 limit the further down ward movement of the shaft H of the pinion gear Z<br>
The weight of the shaft "H "(including the weights of pinion gear Z, the two other gears T and U and all the ball-bearings, etc. on it) is nullified by the following arrangement:<br><br>
Two ball-bearings kl and k2 are present on either side of the pinion gear Z. A horse-shoe shaped strip of plate L is attached to the sleeves on the outer cups of ball-bearings kl and k2. From the center of the horse-shoe shaped strip of the plate L, a counter weight "s" is suspended by a rope "r" passing over two pulleys (m and n).<br>
Mechanical Regulating System<br>
The speedometer cable of a speedometer is connected to the shaft of the generator. The pivot of the speedometer is connected on the same axis to two "volume regulating switches of a transistor radio" or "speed regulating switches of electric fans placed in reverse".<br>
At the neutral point of the speedometer pointer (i.e, the speed at which 50cycles/sec.electric power is given out by the generator),there is no power out put from the switches. Only one of the two switches gets operated in its direction of movement while the other comes to stay in the neutral position of her speedometer pointer. The power form the switches may be amplified if needed. The amplified power is connect to any of the following two valve regulating mechanisms.<br>
i) in one type of valve regulating mechanism an electrical coil is connected to the power from the two switches mentioned above, the coil has a shaft passing through it. this shaft closes or opens two valves placed one each on either side of the shaft, ii) In the second type a electric motor is connected to the two switches mentioned above. The shaft of the motor has a screw thread on it. This screw thread moves a gear in the right or left direction depending on the direction of rotation of the shaft of the motor. This gear has axial shaft with screw thread, which either opens or closes a valve. At the point when the valve is fully opened or fully closed power supply to the motor is cut off and gets connected in the reverse direction.<br>
(See Fig 14) On the power output shaft is placed a fly wheel (i) and a motor (y) which runs on compressed air or fluid of a compressor tank (n), so as to turn the shaft in the same direction as that of its rotation. The fly wheel has a brake system X, Y on it, (Fig. 15) to slow its speed if needed. This break system is connected to the compressor tank(n). The fly - wheel also has two pulley grooves on it to run pulley belts k, j (See Fig 15). When only one unit is used to produce power, (See Fig. 14) one pulley groove may be used through a pulley belt (p) and a counter to get the required speed to run a generator (1). Alternatively the generator (1) may also be run through a gear box "o" (to get the required speed), which is connected, to the same shaft as that of the fly wheel.<br><br>
The second pulley groove (k) on the fly wheel (i) is connected through a pulley belt to a compressor motor (m). The following - a) The break system on the fly - wheel is connected to the compressor tank (n), - b) The motor (y) on the shaft G is connected to the compressor tank n - c) The Hydraulic Jack is (Fig.4) connected to the compressor tank (n) and - d) The adjustment of the water level in the float with centrifugal pumps e &amp; f (Fig.3) placed on the float are connected to the compressor tank (n). They are all connected through a computer system or a mechanical regulating system to co-ordinate and regulate the speed required to run the generator.<br>
(There are also other types of regulating means for getting grid quality power, presently available in the market which can be employed in the present invention)<br>
(See Fig 21) The shaft of each last unit in a row towards the shore is connected to a long horizontal shaft placed at 90° (to the shafts) with 45° beveled gears (b, c). Thus all the power from the rows of the units is transferred to the horizontally place shaft. This horizontal shaft is connected to an electric generator (G) through a gear box (E) if needed, to produce grid quality power.<br>
Although the ocean wave energy conversion system and the method of using the same according to the prevent invention has been described in the foregoing specification with considerable details, it is to be understood that modifications may be made to the invention which do not exceed the scope of the appended claims and modified forms of the present invention done by others skilled in the art to which invention pertains will be considered infringements of this invention, when those modified forms fall within claimed scope of this invention.<br><br>
EXPERIMENTS<br>
Experiment I was carried out on Machilipatnam Beach (A.P, India) in July 2000. Only one float was used in the experiment. Instead of the concrete pillars. MS channels were used to guide the float. A 1 KVA Generator of 1500 RPM was used. Three bulbs of 100 Watts were placed in series. The bulbs lighted only for a few minutes, as the equipment was not strong enough to withstand the forceful ocean waves.<br>
Experiment 2 was carried out in November 2001 using prefabricated pillars made of concrete to withstand the force of the ocean waves. The result was almost similar as the gears in the gear - box did not withstand the force obtained there.<br><br><br>
