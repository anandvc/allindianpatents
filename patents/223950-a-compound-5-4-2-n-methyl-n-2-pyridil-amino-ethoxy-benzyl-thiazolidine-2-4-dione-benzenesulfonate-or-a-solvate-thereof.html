Furthermore, the invention provides the Benzenesulfonate or a solvate thereof in a pharmaceutically acceptable form, especially in bulk form, such form having good flow properties, especially good bulk flow properties.<br>
The invention also provides a process for preparing the Benzenesulfonate, characterised in that 5-[4-[2-(N-methyl-N-(2-pyridyl)amino)ethoxy]benzyl]thiazolidine-2,4-dione (Compound (l))or a salt thereof, preferably dispersed or dissolved in a suitable solvent, is reacted with a suitable source of benzenesulfonate ion, and the Benzenesulfonate or a solvate thereof is recovered.<br>
A suitable reaction solvent is an alkanol, for example propan-2-ol, or a hydrocarbon, such as toluene, a ketone, such as acetone, an ester, such as ethyl acetate, an ether such as tetrahydrofuran, a nitrile such as acetonitrile, or a halogenated hydrocarbon such as dichlorpmethane or water, or an organic acid such as acetic acid; or a mixture thereof.<br>
Conveniently, the source of benzenesulfonate ion is benzenesulfonic acid. The benzenesulfonic acid may be added as a solid or in solution, for example in water, ether, kelone, nitrile or a lower alcohol such as methanol, ethanol, or propan-2-ol, or a mixture of solvents.<br>
For example, a solution of benzenesulfonic acid in propan-2-ol or tetrahydrafuran (THF) may be added to a solution of Compound (I) in the same solvent.<br>
An alternative source of benzenesulfonate ion is provided by a base salt of benzenesulfonic acid for example ammonium benzenesulfonate, or the benzenesulfonic acid salt of an amine, for example ethylamine or diethylamine.<br>
The concentration of Compound (I) is preferably in the range 3 to 50% weight/volume, more preferably in the range 5 to 20%. The concentration of benzenesulfonic acid solutions are preferably in the range of 5 to 75% weight/volume.<br>
The reaction is usually carried out at ambient temperature or at an elevated temperature, for example at the reflux temperature of the solvent, although any convenient temperature that provides the required product may be employed.<br>
Solvates, such as hydrates, of the Benzenesulfonate may be. prepared according to conventional procedures, for example by crystallising or recrystallising from a solvent which provides or contains the solvate moiety, or by exposing the Benzenesulfonate to the solvate moiety as a vapour.<br>
Recovery of the required compound generally comprises crystallisation from an appropriate solvent, conveniently the reaction solvent, usually assisted by cooling. For example, the Benzenesulfonate may be crystallised from an ether such as tetrahydrofuran or an alkanol such as propan-2-ol. An improved yield of the salt can be obtained by evaporation of some or all of the solvent or by crystallisation at elevated temperature followed by controlled cooling. Careful control of precipitation temperature and seeding may be used to improve the reproducability of the product form.<br>
Crystallisation can also be initiated by seeding with crystals of the Benzenesulfonate but this is not essential.<br>
In our hands either Benzenesulfonate Form I, Form II or Form III or mixtures thereof is produced by the above mentioned process. To ensure formation of a particular polymorph in substantially pure form the crystallisation step is preferably seeded with seeds of the required polymorph. Accordingly, Benzenesulfonate Form I is suitably crystallised by seeding with seeds of Benzenesulfonate Form I. Benzenesulfonate Form II is suitably crystallised by seeding with seeds of Benzenesulfonate Form II. Benzenesulfonate Form III is suitably crystallised by seeding with seeds of Benzenesulfonate Form III.<br>
Compound (I) is prepared according to known procedures, such as those disclosed in EP-A-0 306 228 and WO 94/05659. The disclosures of EP-A-0 306 228 and WO 94/05659 are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Benzenesulfonic acid is a commercially available compound. When used herein the term "Tonser" is generally determined by Differential Scanning Calorimetry and has a meaning generally understood in the art, as for example expressed in Pharmaceutical Thermal Analysis, Techniques and Applications", Ford and Timmins, 1989 as "The temperature corresponding to the intersection of the pre-transition baseline with the extrapolated leading edge of the transition".<br>
When used herein in respect of certain compounds the term "good flow properties" is suitably characterised by the said compound having a Hausner ratio of less than or equal to 1.5, especially of less than or equal to 1.25. "Hausner ratio" is an art accepted term.<br>
When used herein the term 'prophylaxis of conditions associated with diabetes mellitus' includes the treatment of conditions such as insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, hyperinsulinaemia and gestational diabetes.<br>
Diabetes mellitus preferably means Type II diabetes mellitus. Conditions associated with diabetes include hyperglycaemia and insulin resistance and obesity. Further conditions associated with diabetes include hypertension, cardiovascular disease, especially atherosclerosis^ certain eating disorders, in particular the regulation of appetite and food intake in subjects suffering from disorders associated with under-eating, such as anorexia nervosa, and disorders associated with over-eating, such as obesity and anorexia bulimia. Additional conditions associated with diabetes include polycystic ovarian syndrome and steroid induced insulin resistance.<br>
The complications of conditions associated with diabetes mellitus encompassed herein includes renal disease, especially renal disease associated with the development of Type II diabetes including diabetic nephropathy, glomerulonephritis, glomerular sclerosis, nephrotic syndrome, hypertensive nephrosclerosis and end stage renal disease.<br>
As mentioned above the compound of the invention has useful therapeutic properties: The present invention accordingly provides the Benzenesulfonate for use as an active therapeutic substance.<br>
More particularly, the present invention provides the Benzenesulfonate for use in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of diabetes mellitus, conditions associated with diabetes mellitus and certain complications thereof.<br>
The Benzenesulfonate may be administered per se or, preferably, as a pharmaceutical composition also comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Suitable methods for formulating the Benzenesulfonate are generally those disclosed for Compound (I) in the above mentioned publications.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising the Benzenesulfonate and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefor. The Benzenesulfonate is normally administered in unit dosage form. The active compound may be administered by any suitable route but usually by the oral or parenteral routes. For such use, the compound will normally be employed in the form of a pharmaceutical composition in association with a pharmaceutical carrier, diluent and/or excipient, although the exact form of the composition will naturally depend .on the mode of administration.<br>
Compositions are prepared by admixture and are suitably adapted for oral, parenteral or topical administration, and as such may be in the form of tablets, capsules, oral liquid preparations, powders, granules, lozenges, pastilles, reconstitutable powders, injectable and infusable solutions or suspensions, suppositories and transdermal devices. Orally administrable compositions are preferred, in particular shaped oral compositions, since they are more convenient for general use.<br>
Tablets and capsules for oral administration are usually presented in a unit dose, and contain conventional excipients'such as binding agents, fillers, diluents, tabletting agents, lubricants, disintegrants, colourants, flavourings, and wetting agents. The tablets may be coated according to well known methods in the art.<br>
Suitable fillers for use include cellulose, mannitol, lactose and other similar agents. Suitable disintegrants include starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone and starch derivatives such as sodium starch glycollate. Suitable lubricants include, for example, magnesium stearate. ' Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable wetting agents include sodium lauryl benzenesulfonate.<br>
Solid oral compositions may be prepared by conventional methods of blending, filling, tabletting or the like. Repeated blending operations may be used to distribute the active agent throughout those compositions employing large quantities of fillers. Such operations are. of course, conventional in the art.<br>
Oral liquid preparations may be in the form of, for example, aqueous or oily suspensions, solutions, emulsions, syrups, or elixirs, or may be presented as a dry product for reconstitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may contain conventional additives such as suspending agents, for example sorbitol, syrup, methyl cellulose, gelatin, hydroxyethylcellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, aluminium stearate gel or hydrogenated edible fats, emulsifying agents, for example lecithin, sorbitan monooleate, or acacia; non-aqueous vehicles (which may include edible oils), for example, almond oil, fractionated coconut oil, oily esters such as esters of glycerine, propylene glycol, or ethyl alcohol; preservatives, for example methyl or propyl E-hydroxybenzoate or sorbic acid, and if desired conventional flavouring or colouring agents.<br>
For parenteral administration, fluid unit dose forms are prepared containing a compound of the present invention and a sterile vehicle. The compound, depending on the vehicle and the concentration, can be either suspended or dissolved. Parenteral solutions are normally prepared by dissolving the active compound in a vehicle and filter sterilising before tilling into a suitable vial or ampoule and sealing. Advantageously, adjuvants such as a local anaesthetic, preservatives and buffering agents are also dissolved in the vehicle. To enhance the stability, the composition can be frozen after filling into the vial and the water removed under vacuum.<br>
Parenteral suspensions are prepared in substantially the same manner except that the active compound is suspended in the vehicle instead of being dissolved and sterilised . by exposure to ethylene oxide before suspending in the sterile vehicle. Advantageously, a surfactant or wetting agent is included in the composition to facilitate uniform distribution o f the active compound.<br>
As is common practice, the compositions will usually be accompanied by written or printed directions for use in the medical treatment concerned.<br>
As used herein the term 'pharmaceutically acceptable' embraces compounds, compositions and ingredients for both human and veterinary use: for example the term 'pharmaceutically acceptable salt' embraces a veterinarily acceptable salt.<br>
The present invention further provides a method for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of diabetes mellitus, conditions associated with diabetes mellitus and certain complications thereof, in a human or non-human mammal which comprises administering an effective, non-toxic, amount of the Benzenesulfonate to a human or non-human mammal in need thereof.<br>
