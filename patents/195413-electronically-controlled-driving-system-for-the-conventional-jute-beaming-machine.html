				<td>This invention relates to an Electronically Controlled. Driving System for the conventional jute beaming machines. In order to have a good quality feed material weaver's beam driving system is electronically controlled to achieve the following objectives Viz-<br>
1) Preservation of tensile properties of warp yarn.<br>
2) Improvement in the quality of weaver's beam.<br>
3) Improvement in weaving productivity. 4) Improvement in fabric qualities.<br>
The age-old non-automatic beaming machines traditionally used in the jute industry are not, equipped with any device, which can control the variation of warp tension, maintain uniform compactness<br>
of yarn in the beam and avoid undue damage to the tensile_properties<br>
of yarn. As a result, it is found that in majority of jute mills<br>
the average qualities of weaver's beam are poor and efficiency of the loom shed is low. Sophisticated automatic machines are, however, presently available; but the huge capital and maintenance cost involved with these machines is not perhaps an economic proposition for the jute industry at the moment.<br>
Considering all these it has been thought worthwhile to modify the existing driving system of the jute beaming machine to an electronically controlled one, for producing much better quality of weaver's beam at a reasonably low cost.<br>
The designing drawing manufacturing and assembling of different components of the new electronic driving system have been completed.<br>
- 2 -<br><br>
The new system has been given a trial run under the actual production condition, for the purpose of this research and has shown good results. And so it would be a great advantage, if this newly developed system will be incorporated with the conventional (existing) Beaming machine running in_ma_iority of the Indian. Jute Mills .<br>
The new system comprises the following : viz<br>
1) Sensing device, 2) Monitoring device and 3) Driving device.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided : An electronically controlled driving system for the conventional jute beaming machine comprising of :<br>
sensing device; monitoring device and driving device; wherein the sensing device senses any variation in the linear speed of the warp sheet, the monitoring device receives and converts the pulses from the sensing device into current input for the driving device for controlling rotational speed of the weaver's beam in accordance with the change of yarn diameter of the weaver's beam.<br>
This invention will now be described in details with reference to the accompanying drawing. Fig 1 shows a schematic diagram of Jute Beaming Machine.<br>
The yarn from the yarn package(1) moves to the reed(2) and through it the warp sheet{3) passes through two starch rollers(4,5) to the drying cylinders(6,7,8). It passes through the said drying cylinders(6,7,8) to another reed(9). The warp sheet(3) next moves through the sensing device. In the sensing device there are two sensing rollers(10,ll), made of mild steel, placed one above the other. They are mounted on ball bearings for their free rotation in contact with the moving warp sheet(3) during operative condition of<br>
3<br><br>
the machine. One of these rollers is having a very thin (1 mm) serrated wheel at its one end. During rotation, the serrated wheel passes in-between the two poles i.e emitter and detector of the optical sensor (not shown) which can be a proximity sensor or an optical interrupter. Whenever the serrated wheel passes inbetween the emitter and detector of the optical sensor the serrated wheel interrupts the emitter of the sensor and the detector of the sensor detects the interrupts and therefore any variation in the linear speed of wrap sheet will vary the rotational speed of the serrated wheel and subsequently the pulse rate from the optical sensor will vary and this signal is send to the monitoring device(14), encased in a suitable closed box, mounted nearby for controlling the speed of the driving device.<br>
The second zone that is the Monitoring device now functions at this stage of the sensing rollers. In monitoring device there is only a monitoring unit(14) mounted on suitable frame work near the machine. The unit consists of electronic circuits equipped with (a) Pulse shaper (b) Amplifiers (c) Transistors (d) Resistors (e) Diode (f) Transformer (g) I.C. etc (not shown). The function of the Monitoring unit is to receive signals from the sensing device regarding the variation of linear speed of warp sheet. After that the Monitoring unit(14) converts that signal into control signals and sends it to the<br>
 driving device for taking necessary corrective actions to drive the<br>
weaver's beam(1.3) .<br>
The monitoring device provides set points for pulse rates from<br>
the sensor. The monitoring device is set to a particular pulse rate<br>
which is proportional to the required speed of the warp sheet from the<br>
yarn package. The monitoring device receives the pulses from the<br>
sensor and the frequency of the pulses varies in accordance with the<br>
 linear speed of warp sheet. The variation in pulse rate with reference<br>
to the set points due to the variation of the diameter of the weaver's<br>
beam(13) is monitored by the microcontroller of the monitoring device.<br>
A ' pulse shaper in the monitoring device receives the pulses from the<br>
sensor and the frequency of the pulses from the output of the pulse<br>
shaper is compared with the reference value of the pulse rate that is<br>
set in the monitoring device. The micro controller generates necessary<br>
output signal for controlling the thyristor output which subsequently<br>
controls the drive to the D.C. shunt motor of the driving zone by<br>
increasing or decreasing the current drive and thereby maintaining a<br>
constant linear speed of the wrap sheet. If the pulse rate is higher<br>
than the reference set point, the thyristor output is decreased and<br>
subsequently the current drive to the D.C. shunt motor is decreased to<br>
maintain a constant linear speed of the wrap sheet.<br>
4<br><br>
The last stage is the Driving device which consists of a D.C shunt motor(16) (1/2 HP, 220 Volts 1500 rpm) and the necessary gear driving arrangements comprising driving pully(15), v-belt, gear(12) and a train of intermediate gear-wheels mounted on intermediate shafts which imparts necessary drive to the weaver's beam(13) for exact speed which will vary with the changing yarn diameter due to continuous winding of warp yarn sheet on the weaver's beam(13). The input of the monitoring unit is connected to the detector of the optical sensor. The optical output signal is shaped by a pulse shaper of the monitoring unit and said pulse is fed to control circuit for producing necessary driving current which controls the rotational speed of the D.C. shunt motor. If the linear speed of the warp sheet increases due to increase in diameter of weaver's beam, the rotational speed of the D.C. shunt motor is decreased by decreasing the current input to the d.c. shunt motor from the control circuit so that the linear speed of the warp sheet(3) is maintained at a predetermined constant speed. The D.C. shunt motor(16) is connected to a pulley(15) which drives a machine pulley through a V-belt. The said machine pulley ultimately rotates the driving gears(12) of the weaver's beam(13) through a train of intermediate gear-wheels mounted on intermediate shafts. The D.C Shunt motor(16) can rotate both clockwise and anti-clockwise. The current drive for the motor is controlled by the Monitoring unit(14). As a result, the surface speed of the weaver's beam is kept constant all throughout the winding of warp sheet on the weaver's beam. In this way a weaver's beam is prepared maintaining a predetermined tension level on the sized (starch-added) warp sheet and an uniform yarn compactness is also obtained along the whole cross-sectional diameter of the weaver's beam.<br>
