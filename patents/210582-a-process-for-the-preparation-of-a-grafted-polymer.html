Grafting of Ethylenicallv Unsaturated Monomers onto Polymers<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of grafted polymers wherein in a first step A) a stable nitroxyl radical is grafted onto a polymer, which step comprises heating a polymer and a compound containing a NO-ether to above the melting point of the polymer, mixing and reacting the components at said temperature; and in a second step B) the grafted polymer of step A) is heated in the presence of an ethylenically unsaturated monomer or oligomer to a temperature at which cleavage of the nitroxyl-polymer bond occurs. Further subjects of the present invention are grafted polymers prepared by said process, the intermediate polymeric radical initiator, the use of the polymeric radical initiator and the use of NO-ethers for grafting polymers.<br>
Increasing activities have been directed towards chemical modifications of existing polymers in order to obtain functional and/or engineered new materials. Chemical modifications of existing polymers are important for at least two reasons: 1. They can be an inexpensive and rapid way of obtaining new polymers without having to search for new monomers; 2. they may be the only way to synthesize polymers with the intended new characteristics.<br>
An important chemical modification is the free radical grafting of reactive monomers, which involves reaction of a polymer with a vinyl-group containing monomer or mixture of monomers capable of forming grafts onto the polymer backbone. If the grafts are long, the modified polymer becomes a true graft copolymer, of which the properties will be very different from those of the original polymer substrate. When the grafts are short with less than , for example five moieties, most of the physical and or mechanical properties of the modified polymer substrate will be retained.<br>
*<br>
The advantages of free radical-grafting are further gained with the use of batch mixers or screw extruders as chemical reactors, which allow the free radical-grafting reaction to occur without solvents. This is for example described by G. H. Hu et al., in "Reactive Modifiers for Polymers", first edition, Btackie Academic &amp; Professional an Imprint of Chapman &amp; Hall, London 1997, chapter 1, pages 1-97.<br>
These free radical-grafting reactions are usually performed in the presence of a free radical source such as a peroxide and a reactive monomer, such as for example acrylic acid. However the use of free radical sources such as peroxides may cause undesired properties and lead to problems during processing (gel formation, crosslinking, molecular weight reduction) or during use. Typically the long term stability is reduced and/or the polymer cannot anymore be used in outdoor applications or in applications at elevated temperatures.<br><br>
«<br>
US-A-4 581 429 to Solomon et al., issued April 8,1986, discloses a free radical polymerization process which controls the growth of polymer chains to produce short chain or oligomeric homopolymers and copolymers, including block and graft copolymers. The process employs an initiator having the formula (in part) R'R"N-0-X, where X is a free radical species capable of polymerizing unsaturated monomers.<br>
Surprisingly it has now been found that with specific R'R"N-0-X compounds it is possible to produce a polymeric radical initiator by grafting the group R'R"N-0 to the polymer and to use this macroinitiator for further grafting reactions of olefinically unsaturated monomers,<br>
The polymerization processes and resin products of the present invention are useful in many applications, including a variety of specialty applications, such as for the preparation of grafted block copolymers which are useful as compatibiiizing agents for polymer blends or dispersing agents for coating systems.<br>
One subject of the present invention is a process for the preparation of a grafted polymer wherein in a first step<br>
A)	a stable nitroxyl radical is grafted onto a polymer, which step comprises heating a polymer<br>
and a nitroxyl-ether containing a group (=NO-X), wherein<br>
X is selected such, that cleavage of the 0-X bond occurs and a radical X is formed at about the melting temperature of the polymer; and in a second step<br>
B)	the grafted polymer of step A) is heated in the presence of an ethylenically unsaturated<br>
monomer or oligomer to a temperature at which cleavage of the nitroxyl-polymer bond occurs<br>
and polymerization of the ethylenically unsaturated monomer or oligomer is initiated at the<br>
polymer radical; maintaining said temperature for further polymerization and afterwards cooling<br>
down the mixture to a temperature below 60° C.<br>
The reaction mixture after step A) may also be cooled down to a temperature below 60° C before further reaction of step B) is performed.<br>
Optionally a free radical source is additionally present.<br>
The reaction mixture after step A) may also be cooled down to a temperature below 60° C before further reaction of step B) is performed.<br>

If an extruder is used the process may be descR1bed as reactive extrusion process. Examples of reactiv extrusion equipment and processes are given by G. H. Hu et al., in "Reactive Modifiers for Polymers", first edition, Blackie Academic &amp; Professional an ImpR1nt of Chapman &amp; Hall, London 1997, chapter 1, pages 1-97.<br>
Preferably, if an extruder is used, a reduced pressure of less than 200 mbar is applied duR1ng extrusion. Volatile byproducts are removed thereby.<br>

The reaction for step B) may be performed in any reactor suitable for mixing a polymer melt with a monomer. The degree of grafting depends on the reaction time, on the temperature used and the activity of the polymeR1c initiator.

If the reaction step B) is performed in an extruder, a reaction time of 2 to 20 minutes is preferred.<br>
The grafted polymers are useful in many applications such as compatibilizers in polymer blends or alloys, adhesion promoters between two different substrates, surface modification agents, nucleating agents, coupling agents between filler and polymer matR1x or dispersing agents.<br>
The process is particularly useful for the preparation of grafted block copolymers.<br>
Grafted block copolymers are, for example, grafted block copolymers of polystyrene and polyacrylate (e.g., poly(styrene-co-acrylate) or poly(styrene-co-acrylate-co-styrene). They are usefull as adhesives or as compatibilizers for polymer blends or as polymer toughening agents. Poly(methylmethacrylate-co- acrylate) diblock graft copolymers or poly(methylacrylate-co-acrylate-co-methacrylate) tR1block graft copolymers are useful as dispersing agents for coating systeme, as coating additives (e.g. rheological agents, compatibilizers, reactive diluents) or as resin component in coatings(e,g. high solid paints) Graft'block copolymers of styrene, (meth)acrylates and/or acrylonitR1le are useful for plastics, elastomers and adhesives.<br>
Furthermore, graft block copolymers of this invention, wherein the grafted blocks have polar monomers on a non polar polymer are useful in many applications as amphiphilic surfactants or dispersants for prepaR1ng highly uniform polymer blends.<br>
Thus, the present invention also encompasses in the synthesis novel graft block, multi-block,<br>
star, gradient, random, hyperbranched and dendR1tic copolymers.<br>
The polymers prepared by the present invention are particularly useful for following<br>
applications:<br>
adhesives, detergents, dispersants, emulsifiers, surfactants, defoamers, adhesion promoters,<br>
corrosion inhibitors, viscosity improvers, lubR1cants, rheology modifiers, thickeners, crossiinkers,<br><br>
paper treatment, water treatment, electronic mateR1als, paints, coatings, photography, ink mateR1als, imaging mateR1als, superabsorbants, cosmetics, hair products, preservatives, biocide mateR1als or modifiers for asphalt, leather, textiles, ceramics and wood.<br>
Because the present graft polymeR1zaton is a "living" polymeR1zation, it can be started and stopped practically at will. Furthermore, the polymer product retains the functional alkoxyamine group allowing a continuation of the polymeR1zation in a living matter. Thus, in one embodiment of this invention, once the first monomer is consumed in the initial polymeR1zing step a second monomer can then be added to form a second block on the growing graft polymer chain in a second polymeR1zation step. Therefore it is possible to carry out additional graft polymeR1zations with the same or different monomer(s) to prepare multi-block graft copolymers. Furthermore, since this is a radical polymeR1zation, graft blocks can be prepared in essentially any order.<br>
Consequently further subjects of the present invention are a polymeR1c radical initiator prepared according to step A) of the process without an additional free radical source and a polymeR1c radical initiator prepared according to step A) of the process with an additional free radical source.<br>
