LAUNDRY TREATMENT COMPOSITIONS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to laundry treatment compositions which comprise dye which is substantive to<br>
cotton.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
Dyes have been included in laundry treatment products for many years.  Perhaps the oldest  use of dyes is to add a substantive coloured dye to coloured clothes which require rejuvenation of colour for example a substantive blue dye. . for rejuvenation of denim.  These compositions usually contain a relatively high concentration of substantive dye. More recently non-substantive dyes have also been used to colour otherwise white laundry detergent compositions.  In-the case of particulate detergents this has been in. the form of so-called-speckles to add colour to an otherwise white  powder, however laundry detergent powders which are completely blue are also known.: When dyes have been -included in laundry treatment products in this way it was regarded as essential that non-substantive ciyes were used to prevent undesired staining of washed fabrics.<br>
It is also known that a small amount of blue or violet dye impregnated into an otherwise  white' fabric can appear to have enhanced whiteness as described in Industrial Dyes {K.Hunger ed Wiley-VCH 2003).  Modern white fabrics are sold with some dye in their material in order to enhance the<br><br><br>
whiteness at the point of sale of the garment.  This dye is often blue or violet though other colours ere used.  However-once these garments are worn and subsequent  washed with a detergent composition the dye is rapidly removed from the fabric often cue to dissolution by a surfactant solution. Dye is also lost by reaction with bleach in the wash and fading cue to light.  This results in £ gradual less of whiteness in addition to any other negative whiteness effects such as soiling.  In many cases this leads to the<br><br>
appearance  of a  yellow  colour on  the  cloth.<br>
Accordingly,   the present  invention provides  a  laundry treatment  composition  according  to  claim 1.<br>
DETAILED  DESCRIPTION  OF  INVENTION<br>
Unless  otherwise  stated,   ail  percentages or parts   are en a weight basis.<br>
*Laundry" treatment- compositions<br>
The present  invention  relates to compositions which are used to  treat   laundry  items   such   as  clothes.      Such  compositions are preferably  la'undry detergent  compositions  used  for washing   (especially  particulate detergents,   liquid detergents,    laundry  bars,   pastes,   gels  or   tablets),   laundry fabric  conditioners   used   for   softening   fabrics,   pre-treatment  products,   post-treatment  products,   tumble  dryer products,    ironing  products   etc.      Preferably treatment  products  which  are  applied  in  an  aqueous environment.<br><br>
he eyes may be incorporated into the treatment conducts in wide variety of ways.  For exar.pl e dves which are net<br>
 e spray dried when the treatment product is a particulate<br>
ietergent composition.  Another way cf incorcoretino dyes<br>
into particulate detergent products is to add them to<br>
:ranules which are post-added to the main detercent oovcer.<br>
in  this case there nay be a concentration of eve in the<br>
granules which could present the dancer cf spcttinc and eve<br>
iamage on the clothes to be treated.  This can be avoidsd i*i<br>
the concentration of eye in the' granules is less than 0.1%.<br>
for liquid products the dyes are simply added to the lieuid<br>
and blended in substantially homogeneously.<br><br>
secsuse" the dyes are substantive, only a 'small' amount required to provide the enhanced whiteness' effect hence preferably the treatment competition comprises from O.00.1 ;o 0.1 vt%, preferably from 0.0.CC5 to 0.05 wt% of the dye, nore preferably froia 0.001 to 0.01wt%, most preferably from 3.002 to 0.003 wt%-<br>
fhe dyes	:<br>
The  photostable dyes of the present invention"are unusual in that they are substantive to cotton.  It is preferred that the eye has a substactivity to cttton in a standard test rf greater tnan 7%, p-referbly. from 8to 80% ,more prete raly from 10 to 60%, most preferably from 15 to 40%   wherein the standard test is with a dye concentration such that the solution has an optical density cf approximately 1 (5 cm pathlength} at the maximum absorption cf the dye in the .<br><br>
visible wavelengths (400-700nm) a surfactant concentration ot   0.3 c/L  and under wash   condition?  of a   liquour  to cloth<br>
minutes, agitation time of 10 minutes-  Higher substantivities are preferred as this means less eye must be added to the formulation to achieve the effect.  This is creferred for reasons cf cost and also because excess levels-of dye in the formulation can lead  to an unacceptable level of dye colour in the wash liquor and  also in the powcer.<br>
A photostable five is a eye vnith does not quickly photodegrade in the presence of natural summer sunlight.  A photostable dye in the current context may be defined as a dye which, when on cotton, does not  degrade by more than 10% when subjected to 1 hour of irradiation by simulated Florida<br>
2	2<br>
sunlight (42 W/m in UV and 343 W/m in visible).<br>
It is preferable that the dyes have a blue and/or violet ghade.  This can mean that the peak absorption frequency cf the dyes absorbed oh  the cloth lies within the ranee cf from 540nm to 650nm, preferably from 570nm to 630ns.  This effect can advantageously be achieved by 2 combination or dyes, each of which not necessarily having a peak absorption within these preferred ranees but together procuce an effect on the human eye which is equivalent to a single eye witn a peak absorption within one cf the orererred range;.<br>
Organic dyes are described in Industrial Dyes Iviley-VCH 2003) .  A compilation of avaiarle eyes is the Colour Index published by Society of Dyer and Colourists and  American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists 2002<br><br><br>
(see http: //www, colour-index, org'   Suitable eves for the current application may be taken from any cf the chromophone<br>
quinophthaicre, azine, oxatine thiamine.  It is preferbly<br>
that the dye does not contain a reactive crcuo -such as fcuni<br>
in procion and rematci dyes.  Due to the wider ranee<br>
available azo, anthracutnone and triarvlmethane dves are<br>
preferred,  Azo dves are especially preferbly<br><br><br>
Dyes are conventionally defined as being reactive, disoerse,<br>
 direct, vat, sulphur, cationic, acid cr solvent* dyes.  For<br>
Che purposes of the present  invention, acid  and/or direct<br>
dyes are preferred.<br><br>
?or use in products which contain predominately anicnic<br>
surfactants, dyes containing acid groups are preferred.  For<br>
use in products which contain predominantly catior.ic<br>
Surfactants, dyes containing basic croups are preferred.<br>
This is to prevent precipitation between the dye and -<br>
surfactant.	<br>
Suitable dyes for use in products containing predominately anionic-surfactants include those listed in the Colour Index as Direct Violet Dyes (e.g. Direct Violet 1-103), Direct Blue dyes, Acid Blue and Acid Violet dyes.<br>
Suitable dyes for use in products containing predominately cationic surfactants include these listed in the Color Index as Basic Blue and Basic Violet Dyes.<br><br>
To avoid shade changes caused by pick or loss of a proton i-is preferred that the dye does not have 3 pKs or rKb at or near the pH   of the product.  Most preferably no cl-'.a :r pKs in the pH ranee of from 7 to 11.<br>
It is preferred that the dye has a high extinction coefficient, so that: a small amount of dye gives a large amount of colour.  Preferably the extinction coefficient at the maximum absorption of the dye is greater than 1000 mcl~ L cm"1, preferably greater than 10,000 mol-1 L cm"1, more preferably greater than 50,000 mcl-1 L cm"1.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
To determine the substantivity of a ranee- of dyes the following experiment was performed.  A stock   soluticn:  of I.5g/L of a base washing powder in water was created.  The washing powder contained 18% NaLAS, 73% salts {silicate, sodium tri-pciy-phosphate, sulphate, carbonate), 3% minors including perborate, flucrescer and enzymes, remainder impurities and  water. The solution  was  divided into  60ml aiiquots and dye added to this to give a solution of optical density of approximately 1 (5 cm pathlength) at the maximum absorption of the dye in the visible lengths, 4OO-7O0nm. The optical density was measured using a  "OV-visibie spectrometer.  1 piece of bleached, non-mercerised, hon-fiuorescent woven cotton cloth (ex Phoenic Calico} weighing 1. 3g was placed in the solution at room temperature {20DC) .-This clcth represents a slightly yellow cotton.  The cloth was left to soak for 45 minutes then the solution agitated for 10 mins, rinsed and dried.  Following this the optical density of the solution was re-measured and the amount of dye absorbed by the cloth calculated.  This experiment was repeated for each eye and 4 replicates were done per eye.<br>
The dyes used and the % deposition is given in table 1. Table 2 gives the maximum extinction coefficient, fmax/ -in the wash solution and the peak absorption wavelength in solution and en cotton.  All values are reported to 2 significant figures.<br><br>

where Z   is H or phenyl. The A ring is preferably substituted by a methyl and methoxy group at the positions indicated by arrows.The A ring may also be a naphthyl ring. The Y group is a benzyl or ngphthyl ring, which is substituted by sulphate group and may be mono or disubstituted by methyl croups.<br>
Non-limiting examples of these dyes are direct violet 5, 7, 11, 31, 51.  The invention also comprises compositions including a single dye of the structure of the first or second group, or mixtures thereof, the dye or mixture having the defined peak absorption wavelength.<br>
'Example 3<br>
The  experiment of example 1 was repeated except using dyes at lower concentrations, such that the optical density (5cm) was approximately 0.05 and 0.025 giving faintly coloured wash liquors (i.e. using dye levels 1/20 and l/40th of experiment 1).  Following washing and drying the increase in whiteness was measured by a reflectometer and expressed in Garze units.  The Genz values are accurate to +/- 5 units. The results are shown in the Table 3 below.<br><br><br>
