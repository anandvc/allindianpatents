				<td>Signature Recognition System and Method<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention is directed to signature recognition and authentication<br>
and, more particularly, to a signature recognition and authentication scheme<br>
employing unsupervised neural networks acting on vectors in high dimensional space.<br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
Various types of transactions require a party's signature as an indication of<br>
acquiescence to that transaction. For example, signatures are necessary for checks,<br>
credit cards and numerous types of legal documents. As a signature often is the only<br>
necessary indication of acquiescence to a transaction, forgery of signatures is of great<br>
concern.<br>
Early anti-forgery schemes required comparison by a person of an original<br>
signature kept on file and a newly executed signature on one of the aforementioned<br>
documents. Of course, such human intervention is terribly time consuming and often<br>
not reliable.<br>
With increasing computing power, electronic signature recognition and<br>
authentication systems have been developed. Such systems typically include an input<br>
device such as a digitizing pad or tablet to capture and digitally store the signature<br>
image and thereafter act on that stored image in various ways to compare the new<br>
signature to a previously-stored "authentic" signature.<br>
For example, U.S. Patent 5,745,598 to Shaw et al. discloses a method whereby<br>
a discrete cosine transform or orthogonal transform of the stored signature image is<br>
executed. A sequence of global parameters is generated and the image is divided into<br>
a plurality of strokes according to segmentation parameters based on the properties of<br>
the discrete cosine transform or orthogonal transform. A sequence of feature<br>
measurements also are generated and, thereafter, the global parameters, segmentation<br>
parameters and feature measurements are stored as representative of the signature.<br>
Comparisons are made based on the stored representative characteristics. The method<br>
disclosed by Shaw et al., however, is intended to be particularly useful for storing a<br>
limited amount of data on, for example, a magnetic card such that verification of<br>
signatures can be accomplished at autonomous sites, such as automatic teller<br>
machines. Because of the reduced amount of data characterizing any signature, there<br>
is, by definition, less reliability in verification.<br>
In U.S. Patent 5.559.895 to Lee et al., there is disclosed a writing pad with a<br>
graphics digitizer that converts the continuous lines of the signature into digitized<br>
dots. The digitized dots are then located with respect to a coordinate system, and<br>
horizontal and vertical coordinates are assigned to each dot. The dots are also<br>
assigned values with respect to time. The resulting data represent the simultaneous<br>
accumulation of both static and dynamic information. These data are used to calculate<br>
each feature of a set of features characterizing the signature. The database used to<br>
compare the current signature for the signatory (the person making the signature)<br>
consists of a mean and a standard deviation for each feature of the set. While such a<br>
system is an improvement over known electronic signature authentication/verification<br>
systems, this system is focused on the multi-terminal transaction problem and it too<br>
lacks, the reliability necessary for superior signature authentication and verification.<br>
U.S. Patent 5, 812,698 to Platt et al. discloses a handwriting recognition<br>
system that includes a preprocessing apparatus that uses fuzzy functions to describe<br>
the points of a stroke. The final identification of each character is performed by a<br>
neural network which operate on "sparse data structures" to identify the character's<br>
features. The Platt et al. system is directed to overall handwriting recognition, not<br>
signature recognition per se, and thus is deficient in the reliability of recognizing<br>
and/or authenticating a signature.<br>
Other systems for signature verification has also been devised in the prior art<br>
as well. For instance, U.S. Patent No. 5.442,715 to Gaborski et al. discloses a method<br>
and apparatus for cursive script recognition in which a digital signature is processed<br>
neural networks in a time series using moving windows and segmentation. U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,465,308 to Hutcheson et al. discloses a pattern recognition system where<br>
a two dimensional pattern is translated via Fourier transform into a power spectrum<br>
and the leading elements of this power spectrum are then used as a features vector and<br>
analyzed using a four layer neural network. U.S. Patent No. 5,553,156 to Obata et al.<br>
discloses a complex signature recognition apparatus which utilizes stroke oriented<br>
preprocessing and a fuzzy neural network to recognize and verify signatures. U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,680,470 to Moussa et al. discloses a signature verification system and<br>
method in which a signature is preprocessed for test features which may be compared<br>
against template signatures to verify the presence or absence of the test features using<br>
conventional statistical tools. U.S. Patent No. 5.828.772 to Kashi et al. discloses a<br>
method and apparatus for parametric signature verification using global features and<br>
stroke direction codes where the signature is decomposed into spatially oriented, time-<br>
ordered line segments. U.S. Patent No. 5,825,906 to Obata et al. discloses a signature<br>
recognition system including a preprocessing subsystem which extracts feature<br>
vectors, a recognition network which recognizes patterns and a genetic algorithm used<br>
to decide which features are worth considering.<br>
Other related technologies include Optical Character Recognition (OCR)<br>
systems and hardware for use in verification systems. For instance, U.S. Patent No.<br>
 5,742,702 to Oki discloses a neural network for character recognition and verification<br>
which translates characters into a matrix and identifies the characters using a neural<br>
network. U.S. Patent No. 5.774.571 to Marshall discloses a writing instrument with<br>
multiple sensors for biometric verification which includes pressure sensitive cells.<br>
However, these prior art systems fail to provide an effective and particularly<br>
reliable signature authentication/verification system which may be readily<br>
commercially implemented. Furthermore, with the increasing use of the Internet for a<br>
myriad of applications and transactions, verifying accurately and reliably a signature<br>
on-line is particularly desirable.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
In view of the desire to provide an effective and particularly reliable signature<br>
authentication/verification system, it is an object of the present invention to provide a<br>
signature authentication/verification method and apparatus that preferably employs<br>
self organized neural networks.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to minimize calculation time and<br>
computer memory resources preferably by implementing a predefined process portion<br>
that implements hierarchical iconic zooming to convert signature raw data. In an<br>
alternative embodiment, a "What/Where" network preferably replaces the hierarchical<br>
iconic zooming process.<br>
It is yet another object of the present invention to implement an unsupervised<br>
neural network to analyze the output of the hierarchical iconic zooming stage. It is<br>
still another object of the present invention to provide at least one stage of component<br>
integration wherein the response of the neural network is analyzed.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to implement an improved Pi<br>
neuron in a second stage of component integration whereby an improved response<br>
analysis can be performed.<br>
It is still another object of the present invention to implement in a signature<br>
authentication system a means for assessing overgeneralization and effectively<br>
counteracting the effects thereof.<br>
In accordance with the present invention there is provided a signature<br>
verification system that implements a unique combination of concepts to achieve the<br>
desired verification and authentication analyses. One concept is recursive zooming,<br>
which is a process that takes signature data and converts the same to a set of vectors<br>
in high dimensional space. Another concept is execution of a cumulative ortho-<br>
normalization process, a new method for calculating correlation ellipsoids or spheres<br>
that contain a group of points in high dimensional space. While many other concepts<br>
are described and combined to achieve the present invention, the two concepts<br>
mentioned immediately above, either alone or in combination with the other inventive<br>
features described herein have, to date, never been applied to a signature verification<br>
or authentication system.<br>
As discussed previously, the present invention is used to (1) verify and/or<br>
authenticate a user's signature against forgery and/or to (2) biometrically recognize<br>
and/or verify a particular person. The method and apparatus (system) of the present<br>
invention operates in two phases. In a first, or learning, phase, the system leams to<br>
recognize a user's signature. For this phase, the user provides several repeatable<br>
samples of his signature. The system then analyzes the samples, identifies significant<br>
characteristics thereof and leams both to recognize the signature itself and to<br>
distinguish the way it is written. In a second, or user verification, phase, the system<br>
determines if an input signature matches the samples obtained during the first, or<br>
learning, phase.<br>
Thus, in accordance with the present invention, it is significantly more<br>
difficult to successfully forge a signature since the forger not only must know how a<br>
signature looks, but also how the signature is written. Consequently, the system of<br>
the present invention also is very useful as a biometric authentication device and<br>
method.<br>
Generally, there are five main sub-systems comprising the present invention:<br>
input, recursive zooming, unsupervised neural network and components integrator.<br>
Each of these is discussed in brief below and is elaborated upon in the Detailed<br>
Description.<br>
(A) Input. The input component receives a signature using an input device,<br>
e.g. a mouse, pen or tablet, and generates a description of the signature. The<br>
description of the signature preferably is a listing of time and corresponding location<br>
in x-y coordinates of the input device.<br>
(B) Recursive zooming. The recursive zooming feature serves a plurality of<br>
purposes. The first preferably is to convert the signature to a standard form. This is<br>
desirable in that several signatures by the same person are almost never identical. For<br>
example, the signature may be smaller or larger, stretched or slightly rotated. To be<br>
able to recognize any of these "same" signatures it is desirable that the system ignore<br>
such discrepancies. By converting the signature to a format that does not depend on<br>
the signature size or rotation, the system can ignore these factors and therefore can<br>
more accurately compare signatures.<br>
Another feature derived from recursive zooming is conversion of the signature<br>
to a form that easily can be handled by a downstream neural network. Because<br>
unsupervised neural networks (implemented in the present invention) learn to<br>
recognize collections of vectors in high dimensional space, the present invention<br>
preferably represents the signature in such a collection. That is, the recursive<br>
zooming feature of the present invention converts the time/location representation into<br>
a collection of vectors in a high dimensional space.<br>
(C) Unsupervised neural network. Unsupervised neural networks are a<br>
collection of neurons that can learn to identify clusters of vectors in space, where each<br>
neuron identifies a cluster. The network preferably operates in at least two modes. In<br>
the learning mode the neurons learn to identify the clusters or a portion thereof, and in<br>
the response mode, each neuron responds to vectors that likely belong to the cluster it<br>
learned to recognize. In one preferable embodiment, ellipsoid neurons are used for<br>
recognizing ellipsoid clusters. In another preferred embodiment, bubble-shaped<br>
neurons are implemented for recognizing clusters that are circular.<br>
(D &amp; E) Component integrators, first and second stages. In the learning phase,<br>
the component integrators analyze the network response to the sample signature. In<br>
the verification stage, the component integrators compare the network response to the<br>
signature with the data collected during the learning process. If a "strong" match<br>
exists, the signature is deemed authentic. If not, the signature is deemed likely forged.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The following provides a detailed description of the preferred embodiments of<br>
the present invention, beginning first with definitions of terms that are used herein.<br>
Definitions<br>
Soft Computing - Soft computing is a method by which problems are solved when an<br>
algorithm is not available or can't be defined.<br>
Neural Networks - A Soft Computing system, which solves problems by using<br>
adaptive local resolution nodes. Each such node has input lines (in human neural cell<br>
called - "dendrites") and one output line (in human neural cell called - "axon"). The<br>
node learns to respond to input patterns, which are received in the input lines<br>
("dendrites").<br>
Self-Organized Neural Networks - A neural network, which learns to identify<br>
characteristics of input patterns and hidden correlation without external intervention.<br>
Intrinsic Geometry - A mathematical theory that deals with measurements of<br>
geometric objects such that the measurements do not depend on any coordinate<br>
system. Usually the values which are explored by Differential Geometry and by<br>
Einstein's General Theory of Relativity (Ricci Curvature=Rkjgkj) are Intrinsic Scalars.<br>
Intrinsic geometry can be represented by Tensors or Spinors (Gauge Theory) but it<br>
can be also represented by high order neurons, which use Tensors or Spinors . This<br>
also has significant value in the development of a new General Relativity theory<br>
based on Self-Organized Neural Networks.<br>
Generalization - The ability to recognize patterns which, differ from the leamt<br>
patterns but have common characteristics with the learnt ones. This is the most<br>
important merit of neural networks. It represents a type of data compression. It turns<br>
the neural networks into systems, which solve problems, which were not encountered<br>
before.<br>
"What / Where" neural network - A neural network in which there are at least two<br>
layers. Each layer is a neural network. The first layer is usually made of different<br>
sizes of receptive fields. These receptive fields can have different shapes but usually<br>
one common shape is used, such as a disk (filled circle). The input dendrites within a<br>
receptive field become the input of the first layer. This layer is called the "What"<br>
layer. Usually the "What" layer is made of High Order neurons, which form a Self-<br>
Organized Competitive Neural network. The "Where" network scans the original or<br>
processed pattern via receptive fields (or Input Mask - a predefined shape of<br>
connected pixels). It uses the "What" network as a look up table and therefore<br>
different areas on the pattern are identified by different "What" neurons. For<br>
generalization purposes the resolution of the "Where" network is less than the<br>
resolution of the pattern. The output of the "Where" network can become the input of<br>
the next "What / Where" layers. This description is typical as a unique interpretation<br>
of Infilight Soft Computing Ltd. and therefore may differ from common definitions.<br>
"Eigenvalues" of a BiLinear Form — the values of vectors V for which the .<br>
representation matrix A of the Bilinear Form is diagonal.<br>
"Eigenvectors" of a Bilinear Form — the base vectors in which the Bilinear<br>
representation matrix A of the Bilinear Form is diagonal.<br>
diagonalization - A process by which a Bilinear Form representation matrix A<br>
becomes diagonal.<br>
Principal Components - These are the "Eigenvectors" of the correlation matrix.<br>
High Order Principal Components - Vectors by which High Order Tensors can be<br>
partially diagonalized. Usually Tensors of third orders and above can not be<br>
diagonalized (a Tensor Aijk can not be presented as Akkk=l and for i ? j or i ? k or j ?<br>
k, Aijk = 0).<br>
Correlation Matrix - The matrix of random variables correlations for which Aij equals<br>
Exixj-Exi * Exj.<br>
Unbounded Growth - An unwanted phenomenon in which internal values of a neuron<br>
grow too much. This problem can cause a competitive neural network to become a<br>
one neuron network (because the other neurons never win/leam). This problem is also<br>
called degeneration.<br>
Pi-neuron - A neuron in which instead of using summations of input dendrites, a<br>
multiplication is used. This neuron is usually used as a statistical AND operator.<br>
Temporal summation neuron - A neuron that performs an integral operator on the<br>
input values. In our model we just use a first order neuron. In biology, such neurons<br>
exist in the Thalamus (an area in the mid-brain) and have important role in primitive<br>
biological functions. Important researches about pain and Temporal summation were<br>
done by Dr. Lautenbauscher in Germany. (Tonic Pain Evoked By Pulsating Heat:<br>

Next, the system of the present invention is described in detail.<br>
Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
The signature authentication/verification system of the present invention<br>
introduces a new concept for using an unsupervised neural network for signature<br>
authentication/verification. The invention comprises an adaptive cooperative system,<br>
which uses cooperation between different Unsupervised Neural Networks. The main<br>
process is divided into five stages. Each stage performs a main sub-process, shown in<br><br>
Figure 1. As shown in the illustrated example of Figure 1, the main process is divided<br>
into five stages or five sub-processes as follows:<br>
A - Signature sampling - The system samples a signature as depicted at<br>
reference numeral 100, Figure 1. Signature sampling is implemented via an input<br>
device that translates hand movements to locations. The most common devices are a<br>
mouse, mouse-like devices, pressure sensitive pads, tablets, styluses and/or electronic<br>
pens. The signature sampling sub-system collects the device data and generates a list<br>
of time/location pairs.<br>
It is noted that some input devices can also sense pressure. Though this<br>
information can be used for authentication, as different persons apply different<br>
pressure in the same place in a signature, a pressure variable is not relied upon by the<br>
present invention for reliable results since many input devices do not support pressure<br>
measurements. Oh the other hand, the system of the present invention.can be even<br>
further improved by the addition of a pressure measurement.<br>
Preferably, the input device provides information in sufficient detail to support<br>
the system of the present invention. Specifically, a preferable rate of information is at<br>
least about 40 samples per second. With lower sampling rates there typically is<br>
insufficient information to characterize a signature. Furthermore, the signature<br>
sampling process should take, on the order of, about one second or more.<br>
B - Predefined Process - The system translates the raw data into high<br>
dimension vectors, Figure 1, element 200. These vectors represent the biometric and<br>
geometric characteristics of the learned signature. The vectors represent a unique<br>
"What / Where" analysis, which differs from the concurrent Cooperating "What /<br>
Where" neural networks analysis. The method tends to extract Intrinsic Geometry<br>
correlations.<br>
More specifically, in the predefined process a recursive zooming process is<br>
implemented whereby time/location pairs generated by the signature sampling are<br>
reconstituted into a set of high dimensional vectors. All the results of the recursive<br>
zooming are relative to the sample signature. By using relative measurements,<br>
dependence on size and rotation is avoided.<br>
Each high dimensional vector is generated by recursively focusing on smaller<br>
and smaller details of the signature. Each step in the process looks at smaller details<br>
(defined by a shorter time span) and generates more coordinates in the vector.<br>
Various schemes can be devised for both the zooming in and coordinates generation.<br>
However, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the predefined process<br>
preferably generates 26 dimensional vectors using 13 iterations. Vectors are<br>
generated as follows:<br>
(a) The time period examined in the first iteration is between 50% and<br>
70% of the signature time (with steps of 2%);<br>
(b) The time period examined in the second to 13th iterations is 70% of<br>
the time period examined in the previous iteration; and<br>
(c) The time period in each iteration is either in the start of the time<br>
period of the previous iteration, or in its end (but not in the<br>
middle).<br>
Each iteration adds two coordinates to the vector. These coordinates are<br>
calculated from the difference along the X and Y axes between input device position<br>
at the start of the examined time period, and its position at its end. To avoid<br>
dependence on the size of the signature, the differences in locations are divided by the<br>
distance between the input device locations at the start and the end of the time period<br>
examined in the previous iteration. In addition, there preferably is provided a<br>
division-by-zero prevention algorithm. It should be noted that the above described<br>
percentage of time period examined and the number of iterations is merely an<br>
example of one embodiment of the present invention. Theoretically, higher<br>
percentages (of time period examined) and higher iterations may be used which will<br>
yield better results. However, such increase in percentages and iterations would<br>
require increased computing and system capacity. Thus, under present state of<br>
technology and economics, the above embodiment has been found to provide<br>
sufficiently accurate results considering the economic costs.<br>
C - Unsupervised High Order principal components extraction - The system<br>
learns the clusters, at reference numeral 300, which are formed by the thus generated<br>
vectors in a high dimension Real Numbers Space - Rn. The system uses principal<br>
components elliptic extraction in a unique method. The principal components<br>
("Eigenvectors" and "Eigenvalues" of the correlation matrix) are calculated using a<br>
geometric method of Cumulative Ortho-Normalization. This method saves the use of<br>
a correlation matrix and it's diagonalization. Moreover, the vectors of the principal<br>
ellipsoid main directions may not need double precision 8 bytes variables. Only the<br>
"Eigenvalues" require double variable types. The problem of unbounded growth of<br>
the ellipsoids is solved by a digital condition rather than using solutions such as Oja's<br>
solution or Linsker's model. This digital condition eliminates the use of punishment<br>
rules on "too big" neurons.<br>
In other words, in Figure 1, neurons 310 in unsupervised neural networks 300<br>
leam to recognize clusters of vectors in a high dimensional space. The generic<br>
learning scheme is that the vectors are fed into the network. The neuron closest to the<br>
added vector adds it to the cluster it recognizes, and modifies the location and size of<br>
the cluster to reflect the information gained from adding the new vector. The system<br>
uses a "standard" neural network, but with two variations. The first variation is an<br>
unbounded growth rule, which is used to prevent one neuron from growing too much<br>
so as to recognize all vectors as belonging to a single cluster. This rule is explained in<br>
more detail later herein.<br>
The second variation is a unique process that is used for finding the resultant<br>
ellipsoids. When using ellipsoid neurons, each neuron leams to identify an ellipsoid-<br>
shaped cluster. The problem is that the neuron has to find the ellipsoid's main<br>
directions and sizes.<br>
The standard approach to finding the ellipsoid main directions is to calculate<br>
the correlation matrix of the distributions of the vectors along each axis. The Eigen-<br>
vectors of this matrix are the ellipsoid main directions. The Eigen-values of the<br>
matrix are the variance of the vectors along each of the main directions. When taking<br>
the ellipsoid sizes to be twice the standard deviation along each of the main<br>
directions, the ellipsoid covers 95% of the vectors, thus defining the cluster.<br>
The major drawback of this approach is that whenever a new vector is entered<br>
to the network, the correlation matrix should be updated, and the Eigen-vectors should<br>
be found. For large matrices, however, this process is very time consuming.<br>
Thus, in accordance with the present invention, there is provided a method<br>
called Cumulative Ortho-Normalization which is a unique method to find the main<br>
directions and sizes of ellipsoids and/or spheres. The method is based on the<br>
observation that the average of all the points in one hemisphere of the ellipsoid points<br>
to the main direction. To account for all the vectors in the cluster, the Cumulative<br>
Ortho-Normalization method computes the average of all the vectors that are in one<br>
hemisphere and the reverse of the vectors in the other hemisphere. To find the other<br>
main directions of the ellipsoid, the process is repeated, but each time, the<br>
components that lie along the main directions found so far are subtracted from the<br>
vectors. Sizes are, again, computed as twice the standard deviation of the vector<br>
components along the main directions.<br>
To avoid the need to average all the vectors whenever a new vector is added to<br>
the network, the system assumes that the new point does not change the average by<br>
too much, thus, the system can rely on the directions and sizes found after the<br>
previous vector was added. The implication of this assumption is that the ellipsoid<br>
found is an approximation of the right ellipsoid. This approximation becomes better<br>
as the number of vectors increases. Several hundred vectors result in an<br>
approximation that is sufficient for all practical purposes.<br>
It should be noted that analysis of the clusters created by the recursive<br>
zooming sub-system shows that these clusters tend to be circular. As such, ellipsoid<br>
neurons have little advantage over circular/bubble-shaped neurons. Indeed, it has<br>
been found that an advantage of bubble-shaped neurons is that they are symmetrical<br>
and as a result, there is no need to find main directions, thus improving the learning<br>
time and reducing the amount of memory necessary to implement the system.<br>
Further, the radius of the balls is the standard deviation of the distance of the vectors<br>
for which a neuron won. Thus, such circular/bubble shaped neurons may be<br>
alternatively used in other embodiments of the present invention. The radius of the<br>
balls preferably is used only in the Component Integration - first stage process. This<br>
is possible due to the special nature of the clusters that are formed by the predefined<br>
process, i.e., recursive zooming. However, because ellipsoid neurons provide<br>
improved accuracy (although the improvement may be small), the embodiment using<br>
ellipsoid neurons are discussed in further detail. In this regard, it should be<br>
appreciated by a person skilled in the art that the teachings regarding the ellipsoid<br>
neurons may be readily applied to circular/bubble shaped neurons. In deed, the<br>
circular/bubble shaped neurons may be considered to be a special embodiment of the<br>
ellipsoid neurons discussed herein.<br>
D - Component Integration - first stage - Component integration 400 is a<br>
method for verifying that the geometric and biometric components of the learnt<br>
signature also exist in a compared signature.<br>
This method relies on three types of unique neurons as follows:<br>
D.1 - The Temporal Summation neuron, 410<br>
D.2 - The Average Temporal Summation neuron, 420<br>
D.3 - Pi-neuron, 430<br>
D.1) In the Component Integration - first stage, each temporal summation<br>
neuron 410 leams the relation between the number of vectors within an ellipsoid and<br>
the total number of vectors. It remembers the average of these ratios and the standard<br>
deviation.<br>
D.2) A second type of neuron, the average temporal summation neuron 420,<br>
learns the average distance of vectors within an ellipsoid. It leams the average of<br>
these averages and their standard deviation.<br>
D.3) The Pi-neuron 430 multiplies the statistical distance of the last two<br>
neurons.<br>
E - Component Integration - second stage - This neuron is an improved Pi-<br>
neuron 500 wherein, unlike a regular Pi-neuron that multiplies unprocessed values, it<br>
sorts its input dendrites in a descending order of intensities and finds the minimal<br>
sorted index for which the multiplication is less than one. The maximal worst case<br>
happens when this index has its greatest value. This means that too many Temporal<br>
Summation and Average Temporal Summation neurons report big standard<br>
deviations. Non-Dominant Characteristic Extractor means 510 is provided, which<br>
extracts the most deviated by multiplying the sorted values of standard deviation or<br>
variances.<br>
As a result of this analysis, the system calculates the abnormal deviation from<br>
the compared/learnt original signature.<br>
In a more generalized explanation, the purpose of the component integrator is<br>
to match the neural network response to a signature with the neural network response<br>
to the samples provided in the learning phase. For each signature, and for each<br>
neuron, the neuron response to the signature is calculated. The neuron response to a<br>
signature is represented using two numbers. The first number, which is named the<br>
"global response," is the percentage of the vectors the neuron responded to. The<br>
second number, the "local response," is the average of the distances from a vector the<br>
neuron responded to, and the center of the neuron.<br>
The component integrator measures by how much the response of a neuron to<br>
a signature deviates from the average response to the sample signatures. These<br>
numbers are then fed to an improved Pi neuron 500, whose result is the measure of<br>
matching between the signature and the samples provided in the learning phase.<br>
Improved Pi neurons are components that operate in two modes. In a learning mode<br>
they learn the number of significant inputs they have and in an operation mode, they<br>
output the multiplication of the significant inputs. A more detailed explanation of this<br>
aspect of the present invention follows.<br>
It is again noted that the above discusses merely one example of the present<br>
invention. The remainder of this disclosure is directed to a comprehensive<br>
mathematical discussion of each of the above sub-systems or components in<br>
accordance with one embodiment of the present invention and, ultimately, how the<br>
entire system functions as a whole unit, including the differences between learning<br>
and comparison.<br>
Mathematical and Comprehensive Description<br>
Again, the signature authentication system of the present invention comprises<br>
five sub-processes or sub-systems as follows:<br>
A - Signature sampling, 100.<br>
B - Predefined process - Biometric &amp; Geometric Analysis, 200.<br>
C - High Order principal components extraction process, 300.<br>
D - Component Integration - first stage process, 400.<br>
E - Component Integration - second stage process, 500.<br>
A- Signature sampling process<br>
Sampling in the present invention preferably is implemented with a personal<br>
computer 20 with any attached standard input pointing device, like devices 21, 22, 23,<br>
24 shown in Figure 2, or any other like device. An application running on personal<br>
computer 20 samples the human signature in real time (by using a high priority<br>
thread) at a sufficiently high constant rate, preferably approximately every 7<br>
milliseconds. In a preferred embodiment, the signature sampling process is initiated<br>
only when a click event occurs. The following three-dimensional values are sampled:<br>
• X — x coordinate.<br>
• Y - y coordinate.<br>
• At - derived from the constant sampling rate.<br>
These three-dimension vectors are buffered into a raw data array. Signatures can<br>
differ in the length of their raw data array. Incidentally, the click value may also be<br>
relied upon as an additional feature by calculating the distance between two<br>
discontinued points. Furthermore, and as mentioned previously, because many input<br>
pointing devices can not sample the pressure, pressure need not be monitored in a best<br>
mode of the present invention. However, using an appropriate device for sampling<br>
values of the pressure, a fourth dimension can be defined. And, an even more accurate<br>
signature authentication can be achieved by using this additional dimension.<br>
B - Predefined process - Biometrie &amp; Geometric Analysis.<br>
In this process the purpose is to convert the three dimensions raw data vectors<br>
to high dimensions vectors. In that specific application the conversion process<br>
translates the three dimensions vectors into 26 dimensions vectors. The conversion<br>
vectors are generated, by a hierarchical zooming on the time intervals of the signature.<br>
For example, a sampled signature consists of 201 points, 200 time intervals of 7<br>
milliseconds each. For such a signature, an array of 201 two-dimensional points is<br>
built. The time is included in the array index beginning from 0 up to 200.<br>
The first hierarchical zooming will be on the time interval from t0 to tmax- The<br>
system uses several segmentation rates as follows. Suppose that the segmentation rate<br>
equals to 0.7 and two intervals are chosen; one interval is between 0 milliseconds to<br>
140 milliseconds and the other is between 60 milliseconds to 200 milliseconds, as<br>
shown in Figure 3. These two time segments represent a single iteration. The rule<br>
implemented in the present invention for the segmentation preferably is as follows.<br>
First interval indices are:<br>
Interval I=I,a = (start index, start index + (end index - start index) x 0.7)<br>
Interval I=I,b = (end index - (end index - start index) x 0.7, end index)<br>
The segmentation process is a recursive process which repeats on each one of<br>
the parent intervals for 13 zooming iterations. This process can be thought of as a<br>
"What/Where" iconic conversion. Every iteration calculation is based on a single rate.<br>
A recursive iteration of the right branch is shown in Figure 4.<br>
For stability reasons, the process is repeated for different segmentation rates,<br>
once for 0.5 (i.e., no overlapping between the two intervals), the next for 0.52, the<br>
next for 0.54, and so on up to rate of 0.7. Each iteration records the two dimensional<br>
vectors, which are generated by subtracting the start point from the end point. The<br>
difference vectors are being divided by the length of a parent iteration vector<br>
(equipped with a "division by zero" prevention algorithm) in order to detect internal<br>
signature size invariant proportions. This process explores proportional geometric<br>
and biometric relations.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the zooming ratio is<br>
defined as the 13th root of 2/n where n is the number of distinct (x,y) points. This<br>
embodiment ensures that after 13 iterations, the time interval is between 2 successive<br>
samples. For example, assume the signature consists of 200 (x,y) points, then (2/200)<br>
to the power of 1/13 is about 0.7. This means that the intervals shrink by a factor of<br>
0.7 in each iteration. The instant embodiment is particularly desirable with relatively<br>
long signatures. Specifically, in such longer signatures, the last iteration, without the<br>
implementation of the instant scheme, would reach final intervals that are too long,<br>
whereby the system becomes insufficiently sensitive to local features of long<br>
signature curves.<br>
In accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention,<br>
however, the system truncates long signatures. This does not inhibit the verification<br>
process because in long signatures there are enough features such that instability at<br>
the end of the signature (due to unstable truncation) is compensated for. Accordingly,<br>
where other signature verification systems might implement more neurons, the<br>
present invention, with a limited number of neurons, achieves sufficient reliability<br>
based, possibly, only on a hand gesture resulting in three to five Latin letters.<br>
It is noted that in the present embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
number of neurons used is 32 and the dimension of the vector space which is analyzed<br>
by the neural network is 26. Each iteration of the recursive zooming generates a two<br>
dimension vector and 13 iterations are executed resulting in 13 x 2 = 26 dimensions.<br>
However, in alternative embodiments, different numbers of neurons and dimensions<br>
of vector space as well as a different number of iterations may also be used depending<br>
on the desired accuracy and the system capacity. Thus, the example discussed herein<br>
should not be considered as a limitation of the present invention but merely one<br>
example.<br>
The above process converts the three dimensions raw data vectors, into high<br>
dimensional vectors of 26 dimensions. The 26 dimensions are derived from the<br>
collections of 13 recursive intervals (zooming in), each interval's end - start vector<br>
has x &amp; y coordinates and these coordinates preferably are recorded into a buffer. The<br>
buffer becomes full each time the recursive process reaches the maximal depth 13.<br>
Each iteration fills two places in the buffer. In a preferred embodiment, when the<br>
buffer is full, i.e., has 26 values, it is written into a sequential records file. The entire<br>
recursive process preferably lasts only a few seconds.<br>
This process will not always generate the same vectors; however, the<br>
whole set of vectors can be represented as the unification of clusters of 26<br>
dimensional points. Points are not just sporadically scattered in R26. The fact<br>
that the clusters will not always repeat, is well treated by the "improved Pi<br>
neuron" which is the last processing phase of the neural network, discussed<br>
later. Indeed, the clusters' irrepeatability was the incentive for the improved<br>
Pi-neuron. The output file of the predefined process becomes the input of the<br>
neural network 300.<br>
In a human analogy, the predefined process acts like the early vision stages in<br>
the visual cortex of the vertebrates.<br>
C - High Order principal component extraction process.<br>
Principal component extraction is executed in an unsupervised neural network<br>
300 by a method which implements geometry to extract the main ellipsoid directions.<br>
Such neurons are known as Second Order Neurons. The neuron learns to identify<br>
clusters of high dimension points using a high dimension ellipsoid. Each neuron uses<br>
a dedicated ellipsoid. As an example, such an ellipsoid is shown in Figure 5. In this<br>
Figure it is readily seen that the described ellipsoid has two main directions<br>
(according to a flat two dimensions cluster of points).<br>
In the unsupervised neural network of the present invention, the neuron<br>
identifies close points, which form a cluster and gradually "moves" it's center point at<br>
a predefined rate to the middle of the cluster (the middle of the cluster is calculated by<br>
averaging it's points). This is done by competitive self-organization. The main<br>
directions of the ellipsoid are gradually updated with each new point that the neuron<br>
learns. This unique technique is described in the following paragraph.<br>
The ellipsoid main directions extraction is accomplished by the unique<br>
"Cumulative Ortho-Normalization" technique.<br>
Let V denote the difference vector between the position value of the neuron<br>
(center point of the ellipsoid) and a new learned value. Let P denote the position of<br>
the neuron in n dimensions (center point of the ellipsoid). Let U1, U2,... Un denote the<br>
main ellipsoid unit directions. And, let l1, l2,... ,ln denote the projection variances of<br>
the cluster points on the main ellipsoid directions. Each of these defined values is<br>
depicted in Figure 6.<br>
It is important to note that the 2 * ?l calculated value (where l represents the<br>
variance) counts for most (about 95%) of the sample space which is included in that<br>
range.<br>
Assume that the l values are the Eigenvalues of the correlation matrix. To<br>
refrain from using a conventional high time complexity correlation matrix and its<br>
diagonalization, the following new technique is employed whereby main directions<br>
extraction is simplified.<br>
The mathematical values of the l's are the variances of the projected distance<br>
along the Ui, i=l,2, ... n unit directions. An example for i=2 is shown in Figure 7. In<br>
the following section and associated figures, m will denote the number of learned<br>
vectors (samples).<br>
The UiS are set to initial values of a multiplication of the ordinary base in order<br>
to avoid too small ellipsoids. For example, U1=( 100,0,0,0,...), U2= (0,10,0,0.....),<br>
U3=(0,0,100,0,...),... etc.<br>
The updating process starts from i=l up to i=n, (in 26 dimensions n=26).<br>
U1 will serve as the highest main ellipsoid's direction; U2 will serve as the<br>
second ellipsoid's direction, etc.<br>
The term: [ V * <v u1> ] is added<br>
To: [m * l1 * U1 ] where m is the number of learnt vectors. (The<br>
old m * l1 * U1 is actually the square ellipsoid main direction).<br>
Let the new main square direction be denoted vector by Y, where<br>
Y=V*<v> + m*l1* U1.<br>
Another way to define Y is:<br>
Y= V * Sign(<v u>) * ||V|| + m * l1 * U1, where ||V|| is the norm of V.<br>
If the inner product <v u1>, which is a projection on U) is negative, then the<br>
added vector V * <v u1> points to the positive hemisphere direction which is<br>
pointed by U1. The positive hemisphere is all the Z vectors such that <z u1> &gt;= 0.<br>
If <v u1> is positive then the V * <v u1> vector is also in the positive<br>
hemisphere which is formed by U1. This means that summations will not cancel each<br>
other but will rather work in a cumulative manner. This is the basis for the<br>
Cumulative Ortho-Normalization technique.<br>
The new U1 vector will be U1 = Y/|Y|. Therefore, it will be a new unit vector.<br>
The new l1, is just calculated as: (m*l1 + <v>2)/(m+l), where m is the<br>
number of previous points that the neuron has learned. This means that a new squared<br>
sum is added to the old sum of square projections on the U1 direction. So m*l1 is<br>
actually the sum of all squares.<br>
l1 = Sum of square projections on the first main direction divided by the<br>
number of learned vectors (samples). The new m * l1* U1 vector is the new square<br>
main ellipsoid direction.<br>
The process then proceeds to U2....<br>
We add V * <v u2> to m * l2* U2.<br>
Again we have Y= V * <v u2> + m * l2* U2.<br>
Or, in another way, V * Sign (<v u2>) * ||V|| + m * l2 * U2.<br>
It is then preferable to keep Y perpendicular to the already calculated U1.<br>
Accordingly, a new vector Z=Y-<y u1>* U1 is calculated.<br>
By this the component of Y which is parallel to U1 is subtracted.<br>
Z is then normalized and a new U2 = Z/|Z|.<br>
Again, the new l2 will just be calculated as (m*l2 + <v z>2)/(m+l).<br>
In that way the square value of the projection on the new U2 is added to m*l2 and<br>
divided by ni+1 so l2 will just be the sum of squared projections divided by the<br>
number of learned vectors (samples).<br>
The process continues by adding V * <v u3> to m * l3* U3.<br>
Again we have Y= V * <v u3> + m * l3* U3.<br>
Or, in another way V * Sign (<v u3>) * ||V|| + m * l3 * U3.<br>
The projections are then subtracted on the previous main directions so:<br>
Z= Y - <y u1>* U1 - <y u2>* U2<br>
The new U3 unit vector will just be new U3 = Z/|Z|.<br>
Again, the new l3 will just be calculated as (m*l3 + <v z>2)/(m+l).<br>
This process continues until all the main ellipsoid directions are updated.<br>
After the last main direction is calculated, the process approaches its end.<br>
Additionally, a variable P is also kept. P is the average of the learned vectors<br>
and also an additional point, which is used as the neuron location. This may sound<br>
somewhat unusual, but evidently when using P for ellipsoid calculations and L<br>
(neuron location) for competition, the network differentiation is improved. The<br>
process also uses a rate by which L approaches P. According to the present invention,<br>
L does not move towards a new learned point but rather towards P, the average of all<br>
the learned points.<br>
While this duality might use additional memory, the advantages obtained thereby<br>
outweigh any apparent disadvantages.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, there is provided in the unsupervised neural<br>
network 300 unbounded growth prevention rules. By these rules there is eliminated<br>
the situation of one dominant winner ellipsoid (that learns too much data) or, on the<br>
other hand, becomes a degenerated ellipsoids. Each ellipsoid has a winning counter.<br>
Whenever the neuron wins, the counter is incremented. The Neural Network becomes<br>
less competitive if a winning neuron has over two times winnings over a close<br>
neighbor. At that stage the neighbor will be also updated for input vectors with<br>
distances which fulfill the condition,<br>
(Minimum Distance from Winning Neuron) / (Distance from Neighbor) &gt;=<br>
0.7.<br>
Whenever a neuron wins "too many times", the network behaves like a<br>
Kohonen network. The condition acts as a fortification of weak neurons and therefore<br>
acts as a constructive condition. It is important to say that it is a good condition for<br>
connected clusters but will not always be appropriate for data, which is scattered in Rn<br>
in disconnected clusters.<br>
To summarize the above, in the present high order principal components<br>
extraction process the topology of the signature is learned by the unsupervised second<br>
order ellipsoid neural network. The learned signature topology includes biometric and<br>
geometric characteristics.<br>
D - Component Integration - first stage process.<br>
After the second order neurons (High Order principal components) finish<br>
learning the topology of the data vectors in R26, the component integration 400 starts.<br>
All the sample signatures are sent to the system one by one again. The process<br>
uses the signatures and builds the grounds for the verification that geometric and<br>
biometric characteristics are preserved in future compared signatures.<br>
The second order ellipsoid neurons are kept fixed while two statistic<br>
measurements are learned for each signature and for each second order ellipsoid<br>
neuron as follows:<br>
The process learns the proportion r between the number of vectors within an<br>
ellipsoid and the total number of vectors. It learns the average value of r and the<br>
standard deviation of r. r is calculated in relation to the number of sample signatures.<br>
This process of calculating r is called Temporal Summation.<br>
A second process averages the distance of all the vectors within an ellipsoid.<br>
Distances are measured from the center of the ellipsoid. Here, let s denote this value.<br>
The process leams the average value of s and it's standard deviation when testing all<br>
the sample signatures, s is calculated in relation to the number of sample signatures.<br>
This process of calculating s is called Average Temporal Summation. These<br>
calculated values are then passed to conventional Pi-neurons 430.<br>
Thus, in summary, the accumulation of data which is performed by the<br>
Temporal Summation and the Average Temporal Summation is used as a means for<br>
extracting data out of the large numbers of vectors, not necessarily out of any<br>
preferred cluster/bubble. Even if the neurons miss the center of the cluster, the<br>
Temporal Summation and the Average Temporal Summation are useful.<br>
E - Component Integration - second stage process<br>
All the sample signatures are then passed to the improved Pi-neuron 500 one<br>
by one for further component integration. Referring to the last paragraph of the<br>
previous section, two values are calculated for each signature and for each second<br>
order neuron.<br>
A = (Average r - current signature sample r)2 / (Variance of r).<br>
B = (Average s - current signature sample s)2 / (Variance of s).<br>
The output value for each one of the ellipsoids is the multiplication A * B, where<br>
B - measures local structure deviations, and<br>
A - measures global structure deviations.<br>
The process treats these values as independent probabilities. This is one of the<br>
reasons for the multiplication. Another more basic idea is that A*B is usually more<br>
stable than A+B or A or B. This can be shown in experiment.<br>
For each second order neuron the result A*B is an input of the last neuron, the<br>
improved Pi-neuron 500. Again, it is a multiplication neuron.<br>
Let us denote the values of A*B of each ellipsoid as Xi such that i = 1,2,... k,<br>
where k equals to the number of neurons. The Xj values are sorted in descending<br>
order where X0 is the greatest value. The neuron starts multiplying the Xi values until<br>
the multiplication is less than 1. If no such condition is achieved, the signature is<br>
discarded.<br>
The first i which satisfies X0 * X1 * ... * Xi 
value of i is learned by the improved Pi-neuron 500. A value of 1 or 2 is added to<br>
Maximum i. The new i+1 or i+2 value is denoted by J.<br>
When the system compares a new signature, the Xj values are sorted and the<br>
multiplication up to index J is calculated. If the value of the multiplication is greater<br>
than 1, the system identifies the signature as a false one.<br>
The ideas behind the Improved Pi Neuron according to the present invention<br>
include (1) the multiplication is a means of verifying that signature characteristics<br>
simultaneously appear (multiplication is like the AND operator) and (2) it is<br>
preferable to avoid a multiplication of too many small values, which can cause false<br>
verifications.<br>
The multiplication allows deviations of the characteristics of the tested<br>
signature as long as there are still enough characteristics, which are unique to the<br>
person who owns the signature.<br>
Characteristics of the Improved Pi Neuron<br>
The number of required Xi, which is the number of second order neurons,<br>
depends on the signature complexity. For example, for signatures effected with a<br>
mouse, 20 neurons typically are sufficient. For long signatures, on the other hand,<br>
delivered via a digitizing pad, 32 to 40 neurons are more preferable.<br>
Assessment of Overgeneralization<br>
In addition to the above-described five major components 100,200, 300, 400<br>
and 500, the present invention preferably also implements a criteria for assessing<br>
Overgeneralization. Overgeneralization is a situation in which the irrepeatability or<br>
over-simplicity of the learnt signature can cause the system to accept false<br>
signatures as authentic. In general, if 1 out of, for example, 7 letters of a signature is<br>
spoiled, then the system should still reliably identify the signature. This desirable<br>
system characteristic is made possible by the compensation process which exists in<br>
the Improved Pi Neuron.<br>
If too many changes in the original signature are still accepted, then the system<br>
is termed as Overgeneralized. The standard deviation, which is learned by the<br>
Temporal Summation and Temporal Summation neurons, preferably should have<br>
small values in comparison with the average values. To make sure that no<br>
overgeneralization exists, it is sufficient that half of the Neurons of the Component<br>
Integration - First Stage 400 agree with the condition:<br>
Average * Average / Variance &gt; 50 (or other predefined threshold)<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the system requires that at least 10 (Temporal<br>
Summation &amp; Average Temporal Summation) neurons (out of 32 * 2 = 64) comply<br>
with such a condition. Stricter requirements can be imposed for at least 16 to 32<br>
neurons out of the 64 of the Component Integration - First Stage.<br>
It is important to note that the system of the present invention implements the<br>
instant special tool for the assessment of Overgeneralization, which tool is rarely, if<br>
ever, incorporated in other signature authentication systems. Indeed, the<br>
implementation of the tool is a direct result of the structure of the Component<br>
Integration process.<br>
Criterion for Canceling Overgeneralized Neurons<br>
As noted above, the signature verification system of the present invention<br>
preferably uses the following condition for canceling overgeneralized Temporal<br>
Summation and Average Temporal Summation neurons:<br>
Average * Average / Variance &gt; Predefined Threshold.<br>
That is, the variance preferably has to be relatively low. Table 1 presents statistical<br>
values of a neural network trained 10 times with different signatures. It is expected<br>
that the network contains no information.<br>
On the other hand, comparison with Table 2 of values of a network, which was<br>
trained with 10 repeated signatures of the same person, shows the way significant<br>
statistical values are represented by the neural network. The analysis shows the<br>
statistical basis of the component integration implementation. It also shows the<br>
justification for the criterion for the cancellation of overgeneralized neurons.<br>
The system of the present invention has two modes, one for updating the<br>
neural network weights (the learning mode) and one for comparing a new signature's<br>
features to the already learnt features (the comparing mode).<br>
The Learning Mode - Phase 1.<br>
• Signature sampling - The system samples a signature.<br>
• Predefined Process - The system translates the raw data into high dimension<br>
vectors.<br>
• Unsupervised High Order principal components extraction - The system<br>
learns the clusters, which are formed by these vectors in a high dimension Real<br>
Numbers Space - Rn.<br>
The Learning Mode - Phase 2.<br>
• Signature sampling - The system samples a signature.<br>
• Predefined Process - The system translates the raw data into high dimension<br>
vectors.<br>
• Unsupervised High Order principal components comparison - The process<br>
does not update the ellipsoid's main directions. It just feeds the next layer.<br>
• Component Integration - first stage - the averages of s and r and their<br>
variances are learned.<br>
The Learning Mode - Phase 3.<br>
• Signature sampling - The system samples a signature.<br>
• Predefined Process - The system translates the raw data into high dimension<br>
vectors.<br>
• Unsupervised High Order principal components comparison - The process<br>
does not update the ellipsoid's main directions. It just feeds the next layer.<br>
• Component Integration - first stage - the layer calculates A and B and their<br>
multiplication<br>
• Component Integration - second stage - The Improved Pi Neuron learns the<br>
index J<br>
By the above three stages, the learning process is concluded.<br>
The Comparison Mode<br>
This mode has only one stage as follows:<br>
• Signature sampling - The system samples a signature<br>
• Predefined Process - The system translates the raw data into high dimension<br>
vectors<br>
• Unsupervised High Order principal components comparison — The process<br>
does not update the ellipsoid's main directions; it just feeds the next layer<br>
• Component Integration - first stage - the layer calculates A and B and then-<br>
multiplication<br>
• Component Integration - second stage - The Improved Pi Neuron<br>
calculates the multiplication of A1*B1 * A2 * B2 *...* AJ* BJ up to and including<br>
index J. The multiplication is just one or two index numbers above the worst case<br>
maximal index<br>
The result of the multiplication should be less than 1. If it is greater than 1, it<br>
means that the new compared signature differs from the learned signatures. A result of<br>
between 1 and 100 is designated a gray range which usually means that some<br>
similarity exists but certainly not enough to be sure that the signature is not a forgery.<br>
Of course, the actual scale or criteria implemented will depend on specific<br>
requirements.<br>
In view of all of the foregoing, it is readily seen that the present signature<br>
authentication system is different from prior art systems. Specifically, The early<br>
preprocessing is executed by an algorithm and not by a neural network. This is done<br>
in order to reduce memory and disk space requirements. Furthermore, the preprocess<br>
implements a hierarchical iconic zooming process in order to convert the signature<br>
raw data coming from the signature sampling sub-process. In an alternative<br>
embodiment, the preprocess is replaced by a "What/Where" network if no biometric<br>
data is available. In the preferred embodiment, the signature raw data is converted to<br>
26 dimensions high order vectors.<br>
There are also important improvements in the neural networks aspect of the<br>
present invention. Specifically, (1) the data storage in the system preferably is solely<br>
in self organized neural networks. (2) In the second order neurons a geometric<br>
method of training/learning is used. No explicit diagonalization exists. There is no<br>
explicit use of a correlation matrix. By this, calculations become much faster. This is<br>
very important because self organized neural networks usually need many iterations<br>
and therefore are time consuming. (3) The second order neurons feed another layer of<br>
first order neurons. This concept is contradictory to the model in which high order<br>
neurons are the last "bus stop". (4) Pi (n) neurons are used in the Components<br>
Integration phase. This is not very common in neural networks, and heretofor<br>
unknown in signature authentication systems employing neural networks. (5) The<br>
last output Pi neuron that is used, is not an ordinary Pi neuron. It is a neuron which<br>
sorts the input values and then calculates the multiplication up to a "stability index".<br>
(6) Finally, the present invention implements cooperative unsupervised neural<br>
networks. In contrast, well-known prior art signature authentication solutions usually<br>
adopt supervised neural networks.<br>
It is noted that instant invention can be implemented fully either on a personal<br>
computer or mainframe type computer, or any combination thereof. Additionally,<br>
such computers preferably are connected in conventional manner to the Internet to<br>
facilitate on-line transactions.<br>
While the present invention has been described with reference to preferred<br>
embodiments, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes<br>
may be made and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without<br>
departing from the scope of the invention. For instance, as previously noted,<br>
circular/bubble shaped neurons may be used instead of elliptical neurons. In addition,<br>
many modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation or material to the<br>
teachings of the invention without departing from the essential scope thereof.<br>
Moreover, different numbers of dimensional vectors and different iterations may be<br>
used than the above discussed embodiment to increase accuracy or as required by<br>
system requirements. Therefore, it is intended that the invention not be limited to the<br>
