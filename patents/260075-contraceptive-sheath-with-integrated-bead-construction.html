CONTRACEPTIVE SHEATH WITH INTEGRATED BEAD CONSTRUCTION<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a tubular protective device or sheath for protection against<br>
the transfer of infectious matter during sexual intercourse. More particularly, the invention<br>
relates to a thin walled tubular protective device having a closed end and an open end<br>
wherein the device has a integral bead at its open end.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Condoms are devices that are used for both contraception and protection during<br>
sexual intercourse against the transfer of infectious matter such as bacterial and viral<br>
microbes that cause venereal diseases. The continued increase in the incidences of<br>
HIV/AIDS has caused various health organizations to encourage people to increase the<br>
use of condoms during sexual intercourse in or to prevent the further spread of the<br>
disease.<br>
Condoms comprise a thin tubular casing that is typically manufactured from<br>
natural rubber latex and that has an open end and a closed end. Traditional condoms are<br>
drawn over the penis before coitus. The casing of the condom has an inner diameter that<br>
is selected so that the condom fits tightly on the penis. At the open end of a condom an<br>
elastic, flexible ring or rolled portion of latex is usually provided. This ring portion is<br>
generally the same diameter as the tubular casing of the condom. This elastic ring portion<br>
serves primarily to secure the condom on the penis and to prevent leakage of semen for<br>
the interior of the condom. These elastic ring portions of a condom do not radially extend<br>
the open end of the condom. Indeed, the rings do not supply enough rigidity to alter the<br>
shape of the condom.<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2004/082540	PCT/GB2003/002503<br>
It is generally accepted that HIV/AIDS can only be transferred through contact<br>
with the earner's bodily fliud. During sexual intercourse such a transfer of HIV/AIDS<br>
occurs when skin-lesions of the earner contact the mucous membrane or skin of the<br>
carrier's partner or through transfer of the carriers semen. Such a transfer of HTV/AIDS<br>
may occur at the base of the penis and at the vulva. There is a risk that lesions in these<br>
areas can be caused to bleed during sexual intercourse. When using a standard condom,<br>
these areas are unprotected or unshielded by the condom, and consequently a condom<br>
does not offer full protection against the transfer of infectious matter such as HIV/ADDS.<br>
Numerous attempts have been made to design a condom or condom-like device<br>
that provides effective contraception and/or more protection against the transfer of<br>
infectious matter than the standard condom. A sampling of these attempts are described<br>
below.<br>
An article, "Outline For Successful Prophylactic Program" (Waterbury, Conn.:<br>
The Hemingway Press, 1934), the Gee Bee Company, 7â€”16, discloses a prophylactic<br>
device entitled, "The Gee Bee." This device is a loose fitting tubular prophylactic having<br>
a grooved outer ring. The grooved outer ring does not fonn a collar-shaped, outwardly<br>
extending portion at the open of the prophylactic. This invention does not disclose any<br>
description of a "female" embodiment having a means for retaining the closed end of the<br>
device in the vagina.<br>
German Patent Number 210,413 to Hollmann discloses a condom-like device<br>
having an outer ring. The outer ring of this invention radially extends the opening of the<br>
condom. This invention has no means for retaining the closed end of the device in the<br>
vagina.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 899,251 to Graham discloses an animal breeder's bag. The bag is a<br>
condom-like device for livestock that can be used to collect semen. The bag contains a<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2004/082540	PCT/GB2003/002503<br>
fixed inner band that is positioned at about the middle of the device. This position for the<br>
attachment of the band provides for a tube and a bag-like extension. The purpose of the<br>
band and cross strips is to collect semen in a pocket. A rubber frame can be made in<br>
various shapes, but is not disclosed as forming a collar-shaped, outwardly extending<br>
portion at the opening off the prophylactic. The band of this device is designed and<br>
positioned on the device in order to provide a semen collection bag. The band does not<br>
have a structure that is located at the closed end of the device to provide a retaining<br>
means such as is required for a "female condom".<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,004,591 to Freimark discloses a birth control device. This birth<br>
control device is a female condom made of a strong rubber, plastic, or other similar<br>
material. This condom has a rigid, ring-like rim that is bent or scalloped. This rim can be<br>
a wire. The rim is not adapted to radially extend the open end of this device because this<br>
device is a hard molded material and not flexible. The cross-sectional dimensions of this<br>
condom are disclosed as being sufficiently large to easily accommodate the average width<br>
of the penis with some additional clearance space. The primary function of this device is<br>
to prevent unwanted pregnancy. This device is useful in preventing the spread of<br>
venereal disease. This device provides no means at the vulva to prevent an exchange<br>
between partners of secreted fluids that can contain infectious agents. Additionally, this<br>
birth control device is intended for use by females, but includes no means to secure or<br>
maintain the device in the vagina.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,630,602 to Strickman et al. discloses a disposable contraceptive<br>
cervical barrier. The cervical barrier of this invention is similar to standard diaphragms in<br>
size and design. This cervical barrier contains various "cavities for cells" that can hold<br>
spermicidal lubricants. These spermicidal lubricants can also be placed in numerous<br>
grooves within the body of the cervical barrier. Urethane polymers are used to make the<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2004/082540	PCT/GB2003/002503<br>
device. The cervical barrier of this invention, unlike a condom, has no tubular side walls<br>
to prevent the exchange of secretion between partners that can contain a venereal disease.<br>
Retained sheaths or "female condoms" have been sold for some time. One type of<br>
such a device is disclosed in the Hessel et al. patents, U.S. Patents 4,735,621, 4,976,273,<br>
5,094,250, 5,490,519, and 5,623 946. In the principle embodiment discussed in these<br>
patents, the urethane ring at the open end of the tubular member is a separate unit from<br>
the urethane sheath itself. The sheath is then attached to the ring through for example a<br>
welding step. The Hessel patents also discuss that the ring can be formed by rolling the<br>
polymer material that forms the walls of the tubular structure from the open end, so as to<br>
form a ring of material. This ring of material can then be kept from unrolling by heating<br>
or using an adhesive.<br>
The Hessel patents while they mention use of natural rubber latex, never address<br>
the problems associated with such a construction. Specifically, while rolling a ring is<br>
theoretically possible it presents many challenges. Typical polymer materials used in the<br>
construction of contraceptive barriers (i.e., natural rubber latex or polyurethane) will rip<br>
upon rolling or are too sticking to be effectively rolled. Often when a material is rolled<br>
into a bead of sufficient size, air or moisture is captured in the bead and upon drying the<br>
air expands and moisture boils resulting in a rupture in the bead.<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2004/082540	PCT/GB2003/002503<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to a contraceptive barrier with an integral bead<br>
and methods for its manufacture.  By "integral bead" it is meant that the bead or ring at<br>
the open end of the device is constructed from the same sheet that makes up the barrier<br>
wall without any additional pieces. The device of the present invention is a contraceptive<br>
device that is inserted within the vagina and retained there during coitus. The device<br>
includes a barrier wall that forms a pouch. The pouch is generally tubular shaped with an<br>
open end and a closed end. The open end has a diameter greater than the pouch creating a<br>
trumpet shape or a flange at the open end. The diameter of the pouch is of a sufficient<br>
size to allow free movement of a penis during coitus. Around the outer edge of the open<br>
end is a bead that provides rigidity to the open end. The bead is an integral bead. The<br>
bead is formed by rolling the barrier wall of the pouch upon itself, until a bead of<br>
sufficient thickness to provide the needed rigidity is obtained. An adhesive material may<br>
be used to maintain the bead in the rolled position and keep it from unrolling.<br>
The device may also include a retaining member for keeping the device within the<br>
vagina during coitus. This retaining member is generally located at the closed end of the<br>
tubular pouch. It could take on many forms including a retaining ring or sponge.<br>
In the present invention the pouch is manufactured using a dipping process.<br>
Specifically, the present invention is preferably composed of a synthetic nitrile latex<br>
material. A former, of the appropriate shape, is dipped into a suspension of the synthetic<br>
nitrile latex to form a sheath. The sheath is then cured to allow cross linking to occur in<br>
the synthetic nitrile latex and make it sufficiently durable. Synthetic nitrile latex has the<br>
advantage of being relatively inexpensive, easy to work with and not subject to the<br>
allergic reactions often found with natural rubber latex. In addition, synthetic nitrile latex<br>
is significantly stronger than natural rubber latex and provides a better barrier against the<br>
5<br><br>
WO 2004/082540	PCT/GB2003/002503<br>
transmission of disease. In addition, synthetic nitrile latex has a higher modulus of<br>
elasticity than prior used natural rubber latex in condoms. This means the product will<br>
form a loose fitting liner in the vagina that will stay in place during intercourse. A natural<br>
rubber latex device, being more elastic and lower modulus material, is more likely to be<br>
dislodged.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The invention relates to an improved tubular protective device, such as a female<br>
condom like device or vaginal shield, and an improved method for manufacturing it.<br>
Exemplary embodiments of various structures of the present invention are shown in<br>
Figures 1 and 3-7. These devices have been shown to provide protection against the<br>
transfer of infectious matter, including HIV/AIDS and venereal diseases. The protection<br>
is enhanced because the tubular protection device has at its open end an outwardly<br>
extending collar that is supported by a rigid bead or ring like structure. The bead is<br>
desirably adapted to maintain the collar of the device in a radially extended or stretched<br>
condition. As a result, the bead has to be of sufficient size and rigidity to extend the<br>
collar. The collar is preferably of a dimension that covers the vulva completely and is<br>
relatively immovable during coitus. The tubular protective device preferably has a<br>
sufficiently large inner diameter to allow movement of a penis with respect to the walls of<br>
the tubular device. The walls of the tubular device are held in a relatively immoveable<br>
state or condition within and against the vaginal wall by a retaining mechanism. In one<br>
exemplary embodiment, the retaining mechanism is a ring like member that is either<br>
removable or integrally connected to the closed end of the tubular protective device.<br>
The flexible, thin wall tube of the invention is desirably cylindrical in shape<br>
having an open end and a closed end. The tube is preferably made of a synthetic polymer<br>
material. Particularly preferred are synthetic latex materials and in particular synthetic<br>
nitrile latex.<br>
The wall thickness of the tubular protective device can vary. Typically, thinner<br>
wall thicknesses for the device allow more sensitivity during coitus. However, the wall<br>
thickness must be sufficient to provide the necessary strength and prevent rupture.<br>
Moreover, it is preferred that the wall thickness be uniform throughout the device, some<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2004/082540	PCT/GB2003/002503<br>
variation in the wall thickness is however acceptable. Preferably, the wall thickness for<br>
the device-is between 50 and 70 microns.<br>
The internal or inner diameter of the tubular protective device in its uiistretched<br>
state is desirably of a sufficiently large dimension to permit movement of a penis with<br>
respect to the protective device during sexual intercourse. A tubular protective device<br>
having a large inner diameter functions as a liner for the vaginal wall or as a "vaginal<br>
pouch". In this situation, the device is relatively stationary to the vaginal wall and the<br>
glans is in direct contact with the surface against which it is moving. This structural<br>
arrangement, wherein the inner diameter of the tubular protective device is larger than a<br>
penis, provides greater sensitivity for both partners.<br>
Standards within the industry for condoms, typically, do not define the inner<br>
diameter of a condom, but define the acceptable width of the condom when it is laid flat<br>
on a surface. A condom having a width of about 47 millimeters to about 51 millimeter is<br>
considered, within the industry, to be form fitting. Contoured or loose fitting condoms<br>
have a width of about 50 millimeters to about 54 millimeters. For tin's invention an<br>
acceptable width is at least about 50 millimeters in an uiistretched state along the entire<br>
length of the tube. A desirable range for the width of the tubular protective device of this<br>
invention is between about 55 millimeters and about 85 millimeters.<br>
The collar-shaped, outwardly extending portion of the tubular protective device<br>
has a. mechanism for radially stretching or extending the collar, such as a bead or ring-like<br>
member. Furthermore, the bead serves to prevent the open end of the tubular protective<br>
device from being pushed into the vagina during sexual intercourse. As mentioned<br>
above, this mechanism for extending the collar or ring-like member, in the most desirable<br>
embodiments of the invention, is integral to the open end of the tubular protective device<br>
and is formed from the walls of the device. Such a structure is formed by rolling'the walls<br>
9<br><br>
WO 2004/082540	PCT/GB2003/002503<br>
of the device, from the open end of the tube so as to form a ring of material. Steps should<br>
be taken to maintain the structure of this ring and prevent it from unrolling.<br>
The diameter of the ring formed by the integral bead is desirably large enough to<br>
prevent the exchange of secretions between partners during sexual intercourse. In other<br>
words, the diameter of the ring formed by the integral bead is desirably large enough such<br>
that the vulva and the base of the penis are covered by the extended collar. The preferred<br>
embodiments of the invention have a first diameter for the tube of the device and a second<br>
diameter for the ring formed by the integral bead, wherein the second diameter is larger<br>
than the first diameter. Acceptable diameters for the ring formed by the integral bead of<br>
the device are at least about 50 millimeters and desirably between about 60 and about 75<br>
millimeters. Preferably, the collar is conically shaped and when a tubular protective<br>
device having an inner diameter of approximately 50 millimeters is used, the collar,<br>
supported by the integral bead, preferably, has an inner diameter of approximately 70<br>
millimeters.<br>
The integral bead must be of sufficient size and rigidity to support the collar. As a<br>
result, the integral bead of the present invention must be significantly larger than the ring<br>
formed on a standard condom, hi prior art device, a wire or plastic ring was used to<br>
provide this rigidity. The present invention eliminates the need for such a substructure.<br>
An embodiment of the manufacturing process for forming the product of the<br>
present invention is set forth in Figure 2. In this exemplary process, the tubular device is<br>
manufactured by first dipping a preheated (70Â°C) former (preferably ceramic) into a<br>
coagulant, such as calcium nitrate (CaNOs). Then the former, coated with the coagulant,<br>
is dried. The dried former is then dipped into a heated aqueous suspension of synthetic<br>
latex polymer material.   The coagulant allows the synthetic latex to better form on the<br>
former. The synthetic latex is then dried in an oven until substantially dry. In an<br>
10<br><br>
WO 2004/082540	PCT/GB2003/002503<br>
exemplary embodiment, the material is then leached in water. After the leaching process-<br>
it is allowed to air dry. The synthetic latex is then cured. After the synthetic latex is<br>
cured, the open end of the tubular device is rolled upon itself to form the integral bead.<br>
The bead is rolled to a substantial size in order to provide the rigidity. The integral bead<br>
is at least about 3-3.5 millimeter in cross section diameter. In general, this entails rolling<br>
about 130 to 190 millimeters of the tubular device upon itself. In one exemplary<br>
embodiment, at the last roll of the bead an adhesive is applied to the outer wall of the<br>
tubular device and rolled up into the bead. This adhesive keeps bead from unrolling.<br>
While any appropriate adhesive material could be used, in a particular embodiment the<br>
adhesive is the same synthetic latex that is used to form the tubular device. If the<br>
synthetic latex is used as the adhesive, it is advantageous to then further cure the device<br>
for a second time.<br>
In another exemplary embodiment the use of an adhesive may be avoided. In this<br>
embodiment the first cure of the synthetic latex is done at a temperature and for a time<br>
that allows only a partial cure , such that synthetic polymer retains the ability to bond<br>
with itself. The bead is then formed by rolling the open end of the tubular device upon<br>
itself. The device is then cured for a second time, completing the curing process,<br>
resulting in cross-linking within the bead and preventing it from unrolling.<br>
Insertion into the vagina of the tubular protective device of the invention can be<br>
done by either the man or the woman. The device can be inserted in the traditional<br>
manner wherein the male partner places the device over the penis before coitus. The<br>
female partner can insert the device by hand or by means of an insertion probe or<br>
applicator.<br>
The tubular protective deAdce has structure that prevents the unintentional removal<br>
or from slipping out of the device from the vagina once insertion into the female partner<br>
11<br><br>
WO 2004/082540	PCT/GB2003/002503<br>
has occurred. Prevention of unintentional removal is accomplished by a mechanism for<br>
retaining the device in the vagina. The mechanism for retaining can be fashioned in a<br>
variety of structures, but is desirably a circular elastic member such as an elastic ring.<br>
This member or ring can be placed internal or external to the wall at or essentially at the<br>
closed end of the tubular protective device. After being placed correctly in the vicinity of<br>
the uterus, the circular elastic member or elastic ring is maintained within the vagina in<br>
the same manner as a diaphragm.<br>
The mechanism for retaining the tubular device in a vagina can comprise one of<br>
many structures that are fixed or removable. Ring-like members can provide suitable<br>
mechanisms for retaining as discussed above. Ring-like members are made more suitable<br>
for use as retaining mechanisms when at least one segment of the ring is removed. Such<br>
embodiments, having a ring with an open segment, permit the ring-like member to be<br>
pinched or partially collapsed for easy insertion into the vagina. An open or collapsible<br>
retaining mechanism can be desirable in embodiments wherein the mechanisms for<br>
retaining is other than a ring-like member. Such embodiments can be in the form of ribs<br>
that are longitudinally molded into or extruded onto the closed end of the device as well<br>
as cap-like retaining mechanisms. Circular sponges located at the closed can also be<br>
effective retaining mechanism. Regardless of the structure adopted for the retaining<br>
mechanism, the retaining mechanisms must be structured such that it does not weaken the<br>
wall of the tubular protective device nor interfere with coitus,<br>
hi one exemplary embodiment, the retaining mechanism is a ring made of an<br>
elastic material that softens when heated to body temperature such as a polyurethane<br>
material. The ring is placed, unattached, at the closed end of the tubular device. The ring<br>
is of a size to hold the wall of the tubular device against the wall of the vaginal cavity.<br>
12<br><br>
*O 2004/082540	PCT/GB2003/002503<br>
The internal diameter of the ring is of sufficient size so as not to interfere with coitus.<br>
The fact that the ring softens at body temperature facilitates the removal of the device.<br>
Insertion of the tubular protective device into the vagina can be facilitated by<br>
enclosing the closed end of the device in a sheathing which is axially movable relative to<br>
the tubular protective device. During the insertion of the tubular protective device into the<br>
vagina, the sheathing is moved backwards and, thus, opens for insertion of the closed end<br>
of the tubular protective device. Such a sheathing is not typically present if a means for<br>
retaining the device in the vagina, such as an elastic ring, is present.<br>
A lubricant is, desirably, applied to the tubular protective device prior to or in<br>
connection with the insertion of the tubular protective device. The lubricant is applied at<br>
least to the inner side of the device in order to reduce friction during contact with the<br>
penis. If desired, a lubricant can also be applied to the exterior side of the device.<br>
Application of a lubricant to the exterior side of the tubular protective device can<br>
facilitate the insertion of the device into the vagina.<br>
Selection of a desirable lubricant can vary greatly. The selection of a lubricant<br>
depends, in part, upon the compatibility of the lubricant with the polymer synthetic latex<br>
used to manufacture the device. Desirable lubricants can include ointments, creams, or<br>
water-based mucilages or mucilage-like substances such as cellulose-based lubricants.<br>
The invention is described in more detail with reference to the figures that show<br>
desirable embodiments of the tubular protective devices according to the invention.<br>

transverse to the integral bead 3. The integral bead 3 is constructed entirely from rolling<br>
of tubular wall upon itself.<br>
FIG. 3 is an alternative embodiment of a tubular protective device 10 according to<br>
this invention. A ring-like member 11 is a fixed to the closed end of the tubular protective<br>
device 10. The ring-like member 11 has an open segment 12 for collapsing the ring-like<br>
member in order to facilitate insertion of the closed end of the tubular protective device.<br>
FIG. 4 is an alternative embodiment of a tubular protective device 15 according to<br>
this invention. This embodiment has two "opposing" crescent-shaped, ring-like members<br>
16A and 16B. Ring-like members 16A and 16B can be compressed, but provide uniform<br>
radial extension of the closed end of the tubular protective device 15. The uniform radial<br>
extension is desirable in order to ensure that the closed end is properly seated in the<br>
vagina in the same manner that a diaphragm is worn. Additionally, the ring-like members<br>
16A and 16B provide a "ribbed effect" for the tubular protective device 15. It is important<br>
to know that the terminal portion of the present ring-like members 16A and 16B are softly<br>
roundly so as to prevent uneven stress on the wall of the tubular protective device 15 or<br>
interference with coitus.<br>
FIG. 5 is an alternative embodiment of a tubular protective device 20 according to<br>
this invention. The closed end of this embodiment of the invention has longitudinal<br>
segments 21 positioned at the closed end to provide a means for retaining the tubular<br>
protective device 20. Desirably, these longitudinal segments 21 are molded or extruded to<br>
have a slight curvature along the longitudinal axis of the tubular protective device 20.<br>
This curvature enables the longitudinal segments 21 to radially extend the closed end of<br>
the tubular protective device 20. The spaces 22 in between the longitudinal segments 21<br>
enable the closed end to be compressed for insertion into a vagina.<br>
14<br><br>
WO 2004/082540	PCT/GB2003/002503<br>
FIG. 6 is an alternative embodiment of a tubular protective device 25 according to<br>
this invention. The closed end of tlois device has a star-shaped retaining means 26. The<br>
star-shaped retaining means 26 has a plurality of longitudinal extensions 27 which<br>
radially extend the closed end of the tubular protective device 25.<br>
FIG. 7 is an alternative embodiment of a tubular protective device 30 according to<br>
this invention. This embodiment has a cap-like portion 31 at the closed end of the tubular<br>
protective device 25. Cap-like portion 31 has an open segment 32 which can be<br>
compressed together for easy insertion of the closed end of the tubular protective device<br>
30. The cap-like portion 31 provides an effective retaining means, but its thickness can<br>
interfere with coitus during use of the tubular protective device 30. The cap-like portion<br>
31 can, optionally, have a plurality of open portions 32.<br>
Manufacture of the tubular protective device, consistent with the process set forth<br>
in Figure 2, is further described by the following example:<br>
Example 1<br>
Initially a synthetic latex compound is compounded in a conventional manner.<br>
The compounding step consists of mixing latex concentrate with stabilizer and a chemical<br>
dispersion agent in order to create a homogeneous substance appropriate for<br>
manufacturing the invention. A ceramic former in the desired shape is cleaned and pre-<br>
heated at 70Â°C for at least thirty minutes. The pre-heated former is dipped in to a<br>
coagulant (such as CaNC&gt;3) with about zero dwell time such that the surface of the former<br>
is coated with the coagulant. Care should be taken to ensure that the layer of coagulant is<br>
uniform over the surface of the former. The coagulant coated former is then dried in an<br>
oven for about one to two minutes at 120Â°C to 130Â°C. Once dry, the former is dipped in a<br>
suspension of synthetic latex (zero dwell time) at 26Â°C - 30Â°C. The synthetic latex coated<br>
former is then removed and dried in an oven at 90Â°C for about three minutes. This drying<br>
15<br><br>
WO 2004/082540	PCT/GB2003/002503<br>
process may result in a partial cure of the synthetic latex on the former. The latex coated<br>
former is then leached in water two to three minutes at a temperature of 65Â°C. This<br>
leaching removes-residual soluble material from the product. The leaching solution may<br>
include a biocide suspension in the water to further eliminate any potential germs. After<br>
leaching the synthetic latex coated former is allowed to dry at ambient temperature.<br>
The integral bead is then formed by rolling the open end of the synthetic latex<br>
upon itself while on the former. The former may be adopted with an annular groove to<br>
receive the bead when formed. A strip of wet synthetic latex may be applied to outside of<br>
sheath at the bottom of the integral bead. The integral bead is then rolled to encompass<br>
the wet synthetic latex. The device is subjected to a second cure for about 15 minutes at<br>
95Â°C to 120Â°C. This second cure creates cross linking bonds in the synthetic latex and<br>
both secures the bead an toughens the material.<br>
After the second cure the device is removed from the former. A polyurethane ring<br>
may be place is the closed end of the device. The product is then leak tested, lubricated<br>
and readied for packaging.<br>
Conclusion<br>
The present invention represents an improvement in both the structure and the<br>
methods for manufacturing female condoms. The present invention provide a device that<br>
