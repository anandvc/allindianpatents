3.	PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed: -<br><br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention relates to a liposome preparation which is adapted for use in drug delivery<br>
system.<br>
Background Art<br>
Recently/ a large number of investigations have been conducted on drug delivery system (DDS) for delivering and distributing a drug to the target lesion site at high efficiency with high safety. One such approach has been use of a closed vesicle such as liposome, emulsion/ lipid microsphere/ or nano particle for the transporter (carrier) of the drug. Use of such closed vesicle in making the DOS into practical application/ however, is associated with various problems which need to be overcome/ and critical challenges have been escape from the biologica, recognition mechanism for a foreign substance and in vivo control of the pharmacokinetics. In other words/ delivery of the closed vesicle to the target site at high selectivity is achieved only when -che stability of the closed vesicle in the blood is secured by eliminating capturing of the closed vesicle in the reticuloendothelial system (RES) such as liver and spleen and avoiding aggregation of the closed vesicle by the interaction (adsorption) with opsonin protein or plasma protein in the blood.<br>
One known method of obviating such problems is modification of the membrane with a hydrophilic macromolecule. Closed vesicle, and in particular, liposomes modified with a hydrophilic macromolecule have been developed for use in clinical practice since they have realized high retentivity in blood, and hence/ passive accumulation in the tissues having an increased vascular, permeability, for example, in the tumor tissue or in the inflammatory site (see Patent Documents 1 to 3 and Non-patent Documents 3 to 5). A typical preferable modifier used in such modification with the hydrophilic practice is a derivative of polyethylene glycol (PEG) produced by attaching a iipid such as a phospholipid or a cholesterol to the polyethylene glycol. An example of the commercially available versatile modifier is a derivative of polyethylene glycol produced by attaching a phospholipid such as diacylphosphatidyl ethanoiamine to the polyethylene glycol.<br>
The liposome which is subject to such modification is a closed vesicle formed from a J-ipid bilayer having an aqueous phase (an internal aqueous phase) encapsulated in its interior. Various liposomes having different layer structures are known in the art, and exemplary liposomes include unilamellar vesicles such as a small unilamellar vesicle (SUV) and a large unilamellar vesicle comprising a single layer of a lipid bilayer and a multilamellar vesicle (MLV) comprising two or more layers. Use of a liposome with a MLV structure for prevention of leakage of the encapsulated drug therein have been proposed (see Patent • Document 4).<br>
Encapsulation of the drug in the liposome as  + described above may be accomplished by various methods, and a method known in the art capable of encapsulating the drug at a high concentration is the method using ion gradient such as pH gradient (see Patent Documents 5 to 7 and Non- patent Document 6).

Disclosure of the Invention Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
Some of the drugs to be loaded in the liposome are unstable at a pH in the range higher than the neutral pH, and in such a case/ the internal aqueous phase of the liposome should be kept in acidic state whether the drug is encapsulated in the lipid bilayer or in the internal aqueous phase. When a weakly basic drug is to be encapsulated (loaded) in the liposome by using a pH gradient, the internal aqueous phase is brought to acidic condition at a pH of about 4 with a citrate buffer solution and heated to a temperature equal to or higher than the phase transition temperature of the main membrane component (for example, about 60°C). However/ when the interior of the liposome is kept in acidic condition/ and as the case may be/ exposed to a high temperature, there is a serious concern that the stability is impaired during the manufacture or storage by the deterioration of the liposome membrane. Focusing on this problem, the inventors of the present invention produced a series of liposome preparations in which a drug which needs to be kept in an acidic condition was loaded in a liposome having a membrane modified with a hydrophilic macromolecule, and evaluated such liposome preparations for their storage stability. It was then found that in some of the liposomes modified with the hydrophilic macromolecule, decomposition of the drug was likely to occur during the manufacture or the storage compared to the unmodified liposomes, and such decomposition of the drug/ in turn/ invited loss of the storage stability of the liposome preparation. In view of such finding, an object of the present invention is to provide a liposome preparation in which a high membrane stability and a high storage stability have been realized without losing the effect of membrane modification enabled by the use of the hydrophilic macromolecule when a drug should be kept in an acidic condition due to the requirement of the drug itself or due to the drug encapsulation method is loaded in a liposome having its membrane modified with a hydrophilic macromolecule.<br>
Means to Solve the Problems<br>
In view of the situation as described above the inventors of the present invention made further investigation on a liposome preparation which has been produced by using a phospholioid commonly used in the art for the main membrane component and further modifying its membrane with a hydrophilic macromolecule, and then encapsulating a drug which needs LO be kept in an acidic environment in its interior aqueous phase. It was then found that that lipid is hydrolyzed by the acidic environment of the internal aqueous phase, and the storage stability of the liposome preparation is thereby impaired. Based on such finding, the inventors further found that the liposome preparations which easily lose the storage stability are those having both the exterior and the interior surfaces of the membrane<br>
3 <br>
modified with the hydrophilic macromolecule. The inventors then gave thought to that the situation should be improved if only the exterior surface of the liposome were modified with the hydrophilic macromolecule, and confirmed that the liposome preparation having structure retains its storage stability even when the internal aqueous phase is under an acidic condition. The inventors also found that modification of the membrane with a basic compound (cationating agent) containing amino group, amidino group, or guanidino group has the effect of stabilizing the liposoma membrane even if the internal aqueous phase were under an acidic condition/ and a liposome preparation containing such basic compound as its membrane component exhibits excellent storage stability.

The liposome preparation of the present invention has an excellent storage stability since unnecessary components in terms of drug structure is adequately omitted in the internal aqueous phase which is maintained in acidic state due to the constraints as described above, and unnecessary hydrolysis of the lipid is thereby suppressed to suppress the decomposition of the drug during the manufacture and storage and enable stable loading of the drug at a high concentration while retaining the effect inherent to the membrane modification such as high blood retentivity, Owing to such properties/ the liposome preparation of the present invention is highly effective for treatment and/or diagnosis of a disease.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Next, the present invention is described in further detail.<br>
A liposome is a closed vesicle comprising a phospholipid bilayer, and it contains an aqueous<br>
phase (internal aqueous phase) in the interior space of the vesicle. A liposome preparation is<br>
a preparation accompanied such liposome as a carrier with a drug loaded therein.   As<br>
described above/ known liposomes include a unilamallar (monolayer) vesicle (EUV, LUV)<br>
-5-<br><br>
oomprising a single lipid bilayer and a multilamellar vesicle (MLV) comprising two or more lipid bilayers, and among these/ use of an LUV (large unilamellar vesicle) is particularly preferable and use of an SUV (small unilairnsllar vesicle) is also preferable.<br>
In the present invention, the unilsmeliar vesicle typically comprises at least 50%/ and preferably comprises at least 80-^ of the total vesicles constituting the liposome preparation. In the present invention, the liposome used for the loading of the drug contains an internal aqueous phase at a pH of up to 5, and the unilamellar lipid bilayer has a particular membrane modification structure in which only the exterior surface is selectively modified with a hydrophilic macromolecule.<br>
Such lipid bilayer contains at least a phospholipid as its main component. A phospholipid Is an amphipathic substance which generally contains a hydrophobic group comprising a long chain alkyl group and a hydrophilic group comprising a phosphoric acid group in one molecule. Exemplary phospholipids which may be used in the present invention include glycerophospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine (=lecithin), phosphaLidylglycerol/ phospha-cidic acid/ phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine and phosphaudylinocitol; sphingophospholipids such as sphingomyelin (Sphinqomyelin); natural or synthetic diphosphatidyl phospholipids such as cardiolipin, and derivatives thereof; and any of such phospholipid which has been hydrogenated by a method commonly used in the art (for example/ hydrogenated soybean phosphatidyl choline). The phospholipids as mentioned above is hereinafter occasionally referred to as "phospholipids".<br>
Among these, the preferred are hydrogenated phospholipids such as hydrogenated soybean phosphatidyl choline (HSPC) and sphingomyelins (SM).<br>
The liposome may contain either single phosphoiipid or a plurality of phospholipids as its main membrane component.<br>
The liposome used is preferably the one produced by using a phosphoiipid having a phase transition temperature which is higher than the temperature in the body (35 to 37°C) for the main membrane component since use of such phosphoiipid prevents unguarded leakage of the drug encapsulated in the liposome during the storage or in blood or in the body. Such liposome is preferably produced at a temperature higher than the phase transition temperature of the main membrane component since control of the liposome size is difficult at a temperature not exceeding the phase transition temperature of the main membrane component. For example/ when the phase transition temperature of the main membrane component is near 50°C, the manufacture is preferably carried out at approximately 50 to 60°C/ and more specifically, a manufacture at approximately 60 to 70°C is preferable. As long as the liposome of particular form according to the present invention can be produced, the liposome may also contain a membrane component other than the main membrane component as described above. For example/ it is preferable to prepare a lipid mixture from the phospholipid and a lipid other the phospholipid or a derivative of such lipid (hereinafter sometimes referred to as ^Additional iipid") to thereby form the membrane from such lipid mixture.<br>
Exemplary such additional lipids include a lipid which is free from the phosphoric acid/ and non-limiting examples include a glyceroglycolipid, a sphingoglycolipid, and a sterol such as cholesterol which is used as a stabilizer as will be described later/ and hydrogenated derivatives thereof. The liposome is preferably formed from a membrane of a lipid mixture containing additional lipids together with the phospholipid main membrane component.<br>
-6-<br><br>
In the entire membrane lipids constituting the lipid bilayer, the phospholipid which is the main membrane component typically constitutes 20 to 100% by mole, and preferably 40 to 10C% by mole,<br>
In the meanwhile, the additional lipid typically constitutes 0 to 80% by mole, and preferably 0 to 60% by mole of the entire membrane lipids.<br>
In the present invention/ the exterior side of the lipid bilayer as described above is<br>
selectively modified with a hydrophilic macromolecule. Exemplary non-limiting<br>
hydrophilic macromolecules include polyethylene glycol, polyglycerin, polypropylene<br>
glycol, Ficoll, polyvinyl alcohol, styrene - maleic anhydride alternating copolymer, divinyl<br>
ether- rnaleic anhydride alternating copolymer, polyvinylpyrrolidone,<br>
polyvinylmethylether, polyvinylmethyloxazoline, polyethyloxazoline, polyhydroxy,<br>
propyloxazoline,	polyhydroxypropylmethacrylamide,	polyumethacrylamide,<br>
polydimethylacrylamide, polyhydroxypropyi methacrylate, polyhydroxyethyl acrylate, hydroxymethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, polyaspartamide, and synthetic polyaruino acid.<br>
The hydrophilic macromolecule is preferably the one in which the end which is not bonded to the lipid has been alkoxylated (for example by methoxylation/ ethoxylation,or propoxylcition) in view of improving the storage stability.<br>
Among these/  the preferred are polyethylene glycol (PEG), polygiycerin (PG)/ and<br>
polypropylene glycol (PPG) in view of realizing prolonged retentivity of the liposome<br>
preparation in blood.<br>
PEG is not particularly limited for its molecular weight. PEG, however/ may typically have<br>
a molecular weight of 500 to 10/000 Daltons, preferably 1,000 to 7/000 Daltons/ and more<br>
preferably 2,000 to 5/000 Daltons.<br>
PG is not particularly limited for its molecular weight. PG/ however, may typically have a<br>
molecular weight of 100 to 10000 Daltons/ preferably 200 to 7000 Daltons, and more<br>
preferably 400 to 5000 Doitons.<br>
PPG is not particularly limited for its molecular weight. P?G/ however/ may typically have a molecular weight of 100 to 10/000 Daltons/ preferably 200 to 7,000 Daltons, and more preferably 1/000 to 5/000 Daltons.<br>
Among these/ the most preferable is polyethylene glycol in view of the remarkable versatility and its effect of realising prolonged retentivity in blood. Polyethylene qlycol is .1 straight chain macromolecule which has a repetitive unit of - (CH2CH2O),, - Since polyethylene glycol is a macromolecule having a amphipathic property/ namely/ since polyethylene glycol is soluble both in water and an organic solvent, and since it also has low toxicity, it is widely used for stabilizing drugs and in improving in vivo kinetics of the drugs. A carrier (such as liposome) modified with such polyethylene glycol known for the low toxicity having a drug loaded therein (for example, a liposome preparation) is highly safe. In the present invention, the term "retentivity in blood" means that the drug is still enclosed in its carrier, and the carrier having the drug enclosed therein is still present in the blood of the host to which it has been administered.<br>
As soon as the drug is released from the liposome, it will swiftly disperse into the blood to be exposed to the blood. When the carrier used is the one with prolonged retentivity in blood/ drug administration can be accomplished by using the drug of minimal dose.<br>
7<br><br>
In the present invention, the term "exposure" means that the drug released to the exterior from the carrier gives some action on the external environment. More specifically, the re-eased drug exerts its action (for example, an antitumor action) after approaching its target site and becoming in contact with such site. When the drug acts at the target site, the expected action of the drug, for example, a local action on the cells at the target site which are in the DNA synthesis phase of the cell cycle is realized at the very site. Such a liposome can be produced as will be described below by producing an unmodified liposome comprising a unilamellar vesicle having a lipid bilayer/ and thereafter selectively modifying the exterior surface of the lipid bilayer from the exterior side of the lipid bilayer with a hydrophilic macromolecule. When a derivative of the hydrophilic macromolecule is used for the modifier in introducing the hydrophilic macromolecule, the hydrophilic macromolecule will be distributed on the exterior surface of the lipid bilayer of the liposome since the hydrophobic moiety of the macromolecule will be embedded and stably held in the lipid bilayer and the hydrophilic moiety of the macromolecule will protrude outward from the exterior surface.<br>
The lipid (hydrophobic moiety) of the lipid derivative of the hydrophilic macromolecule is not particularly limited, and the examples include a compound having a hydrophobic domain (a hydrophobia compound) , Exemplary hydrophobic compounds include lipids such as the phospholipid and the additional lipid such as a sterol which constitute the lipid mixture as will be described below, or a straight chain aliphatic alcohol, a straight chain aliphatic amine, and a glycerin fatty acid ester. Among these, use of a phospholipid constitutes a preferable embodiment.<br>
The acyl chain included in the phospholpid is preferably a saturated fatty acid, and it may preferably have a length of Ci/I--C2o/ and more preferably/ a length of Ci6-Cig. Exemplary such acyl chains include dipalmitoyl, distearoyl, and palmitoyl stearoyl.<br>
The phospholipid is not particularly limited, and exemplary phospholipids are those having a functional group which can react with the hydrophilic macromolecule as described above. Examples of the phospholipid having a functional group reactive with the hydrophilic macromolecule include phosphatidyl ethanolamine having amino group, phosphatidylglycerol having hydroxy group, and phosphatidylserine having carboxy group. In the preferred embodiment, the phospholipid used is phosphatidylethanolamine.<br>
The lipid derivative of the hydrophilic macromolecule is derived from the hydrophilic: macromolecule and the lipid. Combination of the hydrophilic macromolecule and the lipid is not particularly limited, and any desired combination can be used depending on the intention of its use. Exemplary combinations include a derivative of a hydrophilic macromolecule formed by the bonding of at least one member selected from the phospholipid/ the additional iipid such as sterol, a straight chain aliphatic alcohol, a straight chain aliphatic amine, and a glycerin fatty acid ester and at least one member selected from PEG/ PG/ and PPG. When the hydrophilic macromolecule is PEG, the lipid is selected in the preferred embodiment from the phospholipid and the cholesterol. The lipid derivatives of PEG formed by such combination include phospholipid derivative of PEG and cholesterol derivative of PEG.<br>
The lipid derivative of the hydrophilic macromolecule can be designed to have a positive charge or a negative charge, or to be neutral by the selection of the lipid. For example/ when the lipid selected is DSPE, the resulting lipid derivative will have d negative charge due to the phosphate group/ whereas selection of the cholesterol for the lipid will lead to the<br>
-8-<br><br>
production of a neutral lipid derivative. The -ipid may be adequately selected depending on the intention of the lipid introduction.<br>
Among such lipid derivatives of the hydrophilic macromolecule, use of a phospholipid derivative of PEG is preferable in the present invention. An example of such phospholipid derivative of PEG is polyethylene glycol - distearoylphosphatidylethemoiamine (PEG-DSPE). Use of the PEG-DSPE is preferable since it is a readily available versatile compound. Such lipid derivative of the hydrophilic macromolecule may be used by a method known in the art. For example, a phospholipid derivative of PEG which is an example of the lipid derivative of the hydrophilic macromolecule may be synthesized, for example/ by catalytically reacting a phospholipid having a functional group which can react with the PEG with the PEG. Exemplary catalysts which may be used in such catalytic reaction include cyanuric chloride, carbodiimide, an acid anhydride, and glutaraldehyde. The phospholipid derivative of PEG is obtained by such reactions through formation of a covalent bond between the functional group and the PEG.<br>
In the present invention,, the liposome may contain such hydrophilic macromolecule or the lipid derivative of such hydrophilic macromolecule either alone or in combination of two or more.<br>
The modification rate of the membrane lipid (total lipid) by the lipid derivative of the hydrophilic macromolecu. Le is typically 0.1 to 20% by mole, preferably 0.1 to 5% by mole, and more preferably 0.5 to 5% by mole in terms of the modification rate in relation to the membrane lipid. When the drug encapsulated does not need prolonged retentivity in blood as in the case of a drug to be acted in liver/ the liposome preparation is preferably designed so that the modification rate is in the range of 0.25 to 5% by mole in view of improving the storage stability of the liposome preparation.<br>
The "total lipid" used herein is the total content of the lipids constituting the membrane other than the lipid derivative of the hydrophilic macromolecule, and more specifically, the "total lipid" includes both the phospholipid and the additional lipid. When another surface modifier is used/ such another surface modifier is also included in the "total lipid". The liposome surface modified with such lipid derivative of the hydrophilic macromolecule prevents adsorption of opsonin protein and the like in the plasma onto the surface of such liposome, and this in turn improves stability of the liposome in blood and avoids capturing of the liposome in the RES, thereby improving the delivery to the target tissue or the target cell.<br>
In the present invention/ the liposome is particularly produced under the conditions such that the hydrophilic macromolecule is distributed only on the exterior surface of the liposome, and the outer membrane of the lipid bilayer is selectively modified by a hydrophilic macromolecule. In such liposome, the hydrophilic macromolecule chain on the surface of the exterior membrane extends outwardly from the .liposome, while such hydrophilic macromolecule chain is substantially absent in the internal aqueous phase since the interior surface of the internal membrane of the lipid bilayer is not modified. Stability of the membrane is secured in the structure having such distribution of the hydrophilic macromolecule even if the internal aqueous phase is kept under an acidic condition compared to the structure having the hydrophilic macromolecule distributed on opposite surfaces of the exterior and interior surfaces of the bilayer. In addition, stability in blood is realized with a smaller amount of the hydrophilic macromolecule compared to the structure having the hydrophilic macromolecule on opposite surfaces of the exterior and interior surfaces of the bilayer.<br>
-9-<br><br>
In addition to the phospholipid, the additional lipid,, the hydrophilic macromolecule or its lipid derivative, the liposome of the present invention may also contain an additional membrane component which is compatible with the liposome as long as the membrane structure as described above is retained and at a content not adversely affecting the object of the present invention.<br>
Exemplary such additional membrane components include a surface modifier other than the hydrophilic macromolecule which brings change in the physical properties of the lipid to impart a desired property with the membrane of the carrier. Non-limiting examples of such additional surface modifier include a lipid having a compound other than the hydrophilic macromolecule bonded thereto.<br>
Exemplary non-limiting compounds other than the hydrophilic macromolecule include water-soluble polysaccharides such as glucuronic acid, sialic acid, dextran, pullulan/ amylose/ amylopectin, chitosan, mannan, cyclodextrin/ pectin/ and carageenan; compounds having an acidic functional group; and basic compounds having a basic functional group such as amino group, amidino group,- and guanidino group. Among such compounds/ the liposome of the present invention may have a basic compound incorporated therein as a substance which suppresses hydrolysis of the lipid. A lipid is generally known to undergo hydrolysis depending on the temperature and pK. A fatty acid ester at Sn-1 position and Sn-2 position is particularly susceptible to hydrolysis which produces a lysolipid and a fatty acid (see Grit et al., Chem.Phys. Lipids 64,3-18,1993). Such degradation products disturb original lipid composition resulting in an increased permeability of the lipid layer to thereby impair the stability of the liposome.<br>
Accordingly, when a drug which should be maintained in an acidic environment is to be retained in the internal aqueous phase, stability of the lipid in the acidic environment should be improved, in the present invention, hydrolysis of the lipid can be suppressed by incorporating a basic compound in the membrane to thereby impart positive charge with the liposome surface,<br>
The basic compound used is not particularly limited, and examples include amine compounds (including ammonium salts) such as octadecylamine (ODA)/ N-methyl-n-octadecylamine (MOD A)/ N/N-dimethyl-n-octadecylamine (DMODA), and stearyltrimethylammoniuin bromide (TMODA). A lipid derivative having quaternary ammonium salt such as TMODA is preferable in view of its capability of imparting a positive charge to the surface of the lipid layer at a low concentration.<br>
Further examples of the basic compound include DOTMA disclosed in JP-A 61-161246, DOTAP disclosed in JP-A 5-508626, Transfectam disclosed in JP"A 2-292246, TMAG disclosed in JP-A 4-108391, 3,5-dipentadecyloxybenzamine hydrochloride disclosed in WO 97/42166, DOSPA, TfxTM-50, DDAB, DC-CHOL/ and DMRIE.<br>
When the additional surface modifier is a substance comprising a lipid and a compound having a basic functional group bonded to the lipid, this substance is called a canonized lipid. The lipid moiety of the cationized lipid is stably held in the lipid bilayer of the liposome/ and the moiety of the basic functional group will be located on the surface of the membrane surface (on the surface of the outer membrane and/or on the surface of the inner membrane) of the lipid bilayer of the carrier. Modification of the membrane with the cationized lipid improves adhesion of the liposome membrane and the cell.<br>
In the present invention/ the interior aqueous layer of the liposome is at a pH of 5 or less, preferably at a pH of 2 to 5, more preferably at a pH of 3 to 5, and most preferably at a pH of<br>
-10-<br><br>

The desired amount of the drug loaded in the liposome varies depending on the type of the drug. However/ it is preferable that the drug can be loaded in the liposorae at a high loading efficiency . In the present invention, loading of the drug at a high concentration is realized by using ion gradient.<br>
Amount of the drug loaded in the liposome preparation of the present invention is preferably at least 0.05 mole drug / mole lipid/ and more preferably/ at least 0.1 mole drug / mole lipid in terms of the drug concentration in relation to the total lipid in the liposome iipid bilayer.<br>
The term "total lipid" includes ail lipids constituting the liposome lipid bilayer except for the<br>
iipid derivative of the hydrophilic macromolecule/ and more specifically,. The "total lipid"<br>
includes the phospholipid and the additional lipid, and when the liposome contains<br>
additional surface modifier, such additional surface modifier is also included in the "total<br>
lipid".<br>
In the present invention/ the term "loading" is basically used to designate the state in which<br>
the drug is encapsulated in the closed space of the liposome (carrier). However, it may also<br>
-11-<br><br>
include the state in which a part of the drug is confined in the membrane or the state in which the drug is attached to the exterior surface of the membrane.<br>
The liposome of the present invention preparation may also contain a pharmac&amp;utically acceptable stabilizer and/or antio^ idar.t depending on the administration route. Non-lird.tinq examples of the stabilizer include sugars such as glycerol, mannitol, sorbitol, lactose, and sucrose.

The stabilizer and/or the antioxidant used may be selected from those as described above and other agents depending on the dosage form . In addition/ the stabilizer and/or the antioxidant may be respectively used either alone or in combination of two or more. In view of preventing the oxidation,, the dispersion is preferably packaged by filling with nitrogen gas.

The liposome preparation of the present invention is not particularly limited for its size. However, when the liposome preparation is spherical or approximately spherical, its outer diameter is 70 nm to 140 nm, preferably 80 nm to 130 nm/ and more preferably 90 run to 120 nm in the case of the LUV/ and 40 nm to 140 nm/ preferably 50 to 130 nm/ and more preferably 60 to 120 nm in the case of the SUV.<br>
The liposome outer diameter is the average of the entire liposome preparation measured by dynamic light scattering and more specifically/ the liposome outer diameter was measured in the present invention with Setasizer (3000HS or S ZEM 5002 manufactured by Malvern Instruments).<br>
In the manufacture of the liposome preparation, the final sterilization is accomplished by filtration sterilization. For such filtration sterilization, the liposome should be well smaller than the bacterium used for the standard/ namely/ Brevundimonas diminut with the size of about 0.3 x 0.8 j^m since it is required in the sterilization that—th® liposome passes through the filter while the Brevundimonas diminut is trapped by the filter. Manufacture of such liposome having a diameter near 100 run is important also in view of improving the reliability of the filtration sterilization.<br>

-12-<br><br>
Next, preferable methods which may be used in manufacturing the liposome of particular structure according to the present invention are described- The manufacture methods/ however, are not limited to such methods.<br>
For example,, a liposome dispersion may be produced by mixing the membrane-constituting components such as the phospholipid in a flask by using an organic solvent such as chloroform, removing the organic solvent by distillation and vacuum drying the residue to form a thin layer on the interior surface of the flask/ adding the solution corresponding to the interior aqueous phase of the resulting Uposome to the flask, and vigorously agitating the flask content to form the liposome dispersion. The pH of the internal aqueous phase of the liposome may be adjusted by adding a pH adjusting agent to the solution of the internal aqueous phase to thereby adjust the pH to the desired pH* Next, the thus obtained liposome dispersion is centrifuged, and, the supernatant is purified by decantation to obtain the final liposome dispersion. The modification of the liposome surface with the hydrophilic macromolecule may be accomplished by the use of a derivative such as a phospholipid derivative or a cholesterol derivative of the polyethylene glycol (PEG)/ and such modification may be accomplished by adding the polyethylene glycol derivative or an aqueous solution of the polyethylene glycol derivative to the liposome dispersion produced as described above to thereby produce &amp; liposome having the PEG chain only on the exterior surface of the liposome.<br>
Alternatively, a liposome may be produced by producing a liposome containing a membrane-constituting lipici such as a phospholipid having a reactive functional group by the method commonly used in the art/ and thereafter adding a PEG having one activated end to the exterior solution of the liposome for binding of such PEG to the membrane-constituting lipid such as the phospholipid having the functional group.<br>
Furthermore, a liposome can be produced by mixing the components and injecting the mixture from a high pressure injection emulsifier at a high pressure. This method, is described in detail in Terada and Yoshimura/ et al. "Liposomes in life sciences", Springer-Verlag Tokyo (1S92), which is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
In the procedures as described above, various techniques are available for use in producing a liposome having the desired size ("Liposome Technology Liposome Preparation and Related Techniques" 2nd edition, edited by G, Gregoriadis, Vol. X-III, CRC Press) which is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
The lioosome dispersion may be forcedly passed through filters by using an extruder to thereby produce a dispersion containing unilamellar vesicles. This filtration is typically accomplished by using two or more filters respectively having different pore diameters/ which typically include a filter having a pore diameter larger than the desired diameter and a filter for last having a pore diameter adapted for producing the liposome having the desired diameter. The percentage of the unilamellar vesicle increases with the increase in the number of extrusion through the filters having different pore diameters/ and the liposome dispersion produced by such repeated filtration can be deemed as a dispersion substantially comprising unilamellar liposomes. The term "substantially comprising unilamellar liposomes" means that percentage of the unilamellar vesicles existing in the entire carriers (vesicles) constituting the liposome preparation is at least 50%/ and preferably at least 80%.<br>
The loading of the drug in such liposome may be accomplished/ for example/ by s method in which the lipid layer constituting the liposome is hydrated with an aqueous solution containing the drug to thereby load the drug in the liposome (passive loading), or by a method in which a   ion gradient is formed between the interior and the exterior of the<br>
-13-<br><br>
liposole layer so that the drug permeates through the liposome layer according to the ion gradient to become loaded in the liposome (remote loading) (see the documents cited as for the techniques for obtaining the liposome of the desired size,. USP 5192549, and USP 5316771}, The preferable method used in the present invention in producing the liposome preparation is the remote loading. This method is capable of realizing a high ratio of the drug to the lipid enabling the manufacture of a liposome preparation at a high loading weight which is useful in the clinical practice*<br>
This remote loading is accomplished by forming a pH gradient between the internal aqueous phase and the external aqueous phase. The pH gradient is formed, for example, by forming the liposome by the method as described above at a low pH/ and thereafter replacing the external aqueous phase.<br>
The gradient formed across the liposome layer, may be the one formed by Na+/k+ concentration gradient. The technique of introducing a drug in the preliminarily produced liposole by the remote loading by the Na+/k+ concentration gradient is described in US? 5077056, and the loading may be accomplished by referring to this document which is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
The formation of the ion gradient between the interior and the exterior of the liposome layer may be accomplished by using a concentration gradient of ammonium ion or a concentration gradient of an organic compound having protonatable amino group with-the higher pH on the interior side and the lower pK on the exterior side. The organic compound having protonatable amino group is preferably the one having a low molecular weight/ and exemplary non-limiting examples include methylamine, ethylamine, propylamine,-diethylamine,. ethylenediaruine/ and aminoethanol.<br>
The technique of introducing a drug in the preliminarily produced liposome by the remote loading by the concentration gradient of ammonium ion is described in USP 5192549, and the loading may be accomplished by referring to this document which is herein incorporated by reference. More specifically, a iiposome is preliminarily introduced in an aqueous buffer solution containing 0.1 to 0.3M ammonium salt (for example, ammonium sulfate)/ and a gradient of ammonium ion is formed by replacing the exterior medium with c medium free from the ammonium ion, for example sucrose solution. The ammonium ion in the interior will then be by equilibrated by ammonia and proton/ and the ammonia will disappear by dispersion through the lipid layer. With the disappearance of the ammonia/ the equilibration in the liposome continuously shift in the direction of the proton formation, and as result, the protons are accumulated in the liposome and a pH gradient is formed between the interior and the exterior of the liposome. When the drug is introduced in the dispersion of the liposomes having such pH gradient, the drug will be encapsulated in the liposome. The ammonium salt used in forming the ammonium ion gradient is not particularly limited/ and exemplary ammonium salts include ammonium sulfate, ammonium hydroxide, ammonium acetate/ ammonium chloride, ammonium phosphate, ammonium citrate/ ammonium succinate, ammonium lactobionate, ammonium carbonate/ ammonium tartrate/ and ammonium oxalate.<br>
The pH gradient between the interior and the exterior of the iiposome may s-lso 'be formed by using an ionophore. The technique of forming a ph gradient between the interior and the exterior of the liposome by using an ionophore and introducing the drug in the liposome by remote loading is described in USP 5837282, and the drug introduction may be accomplished by referring to this document which is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
-14-<br><br>
More specifically, the pH gradient formation between the interior and the exterior of the liposome and the subsequent, drug introduction by the remote loading may be carried out by the procedure as described below.<br>
A liposome dispersion is produced by mixing the membrane-constituting components such as the phospholipid in a flask by using an organic solvent such as chloroform, removing the organic solvent by distillation and vacuum drying the residue to form a thin layer on the interior surface of the flask/ adding an acidic buffer (for example/ a buffer solution at pH 4), and shaking the flask, Optionally/ the liposoire of the desired size is collected, and a pH gradient is formed by replacing the solution in the exterior of the liposome with an exterior aqueous phase by such means as gel filtration, or alternatively, by adjusting the pH of the exterior aqueous phase of the liposome Co a pH range near the neutral pH (for example, near pH 7 to 7.5) by means of an adequate pH adjusting agent. As described above, the modification of the liposome with the hydrophilic macromolecule may be conducted in the present invention either before or after the loading of the drug as long as the drug is loaded after forming the ur.ilameUar vesicle of the lipid bilayer, Parenteral administration routes of the liposome preparation include intravenous injection such as infusion (iv), intramuscular injection, intraperitoneal injection, and percutaneous injection/ and the administration route may be adequately selected depending on the age and the symptoms of the patient. More specifically, the liposome preparation may be administered, for example, by syringe injection or by infusion of the pharmaceutical composition. Alternatively/ the administration can be accomplished by inserting a catheter to the interior of the patient or host body/ for example, in a body lumen such as blood vessel/ and guiding the distal end of the catheter to the target site, and administering the liposome preparation through the catheter to the desired target site or the region on the vicinity of such site, or alternatively, to a site which is expected to the blood flow in the upstream of the target site. The liposome preparation of the present invention is administered to a patient suffering from a disease at an amount sufficient for healing or at least partial healing of the symptom associated with the disease. For example, the effective dose encapsulated in the liposome preparation is generally selected from the range of 0.01 mg to 100 mg per body weight of 1 kg per day. However, the liposome preparation of the present invention is not limited to such a dose. The liposome preparation may be administered either after the onset of the disease, or before the disease onset when the onset of the disease is expected for a preventive purpose so that symptom after the onset is ameliorated. The dosage period is adequately selected depending on the age and symptoms of the patient.<br>

Next, amount of the doxorubicin hydrochloride which corresponds to 20% by mole of the total lipid content of the liposome was calculated based on the SM concentration that was calculated in the quantitative determination of the SM and the required amount of the doxorubicin hydrochloride was weighed according to the calculation. A doxorubicin hydrochloride solution a^ 10 rr.g/mL was prepared using physiological saline. A predetermined, amount of the doxorubicin hydrochloride solution (10 mg/mL) was added to the liposome dispersion, and the mixture was adjusted to pH 7.4 using IN NaOH or saturated sodium hydrogenccarbonate, and the mixture was stirred at 65°C for 30 minutes to thereby introduce the doxorubicin hydrochloride in the liposome. The sample after the doxorubicin hydrochloride introduction was cooled in an ice bath. Gel filtration was conducted using a column (Sepharose 4 Fast Flow) fully substituted with physiological saline to remove the doxorubicin hydrochloride that had not been encapsulated in the liposome.<br>
Amount of the phospholipid in the liposome, amount of the doxorubicin hydrochloride encapsulated in the liposome, and the liposome size were measured by the same method as Example 1. The liposome produced is shown in Table 1.<br>

[Example 3]<br>
HSPC : Chol:3,5-dipentadecyloxybanzamine hydrochloride was dissolved in t-butanol at a molar ratio of 50/42/8, and the solution was freeze dried to obtain a lipid mixture. 300mM solution of citric acid and 300mM solution of trisodium citrate were mixed, and the solution was adjusted to pH 4 to thereby prepare a. solution for the internal aqueous phase.<br>
0.30 g of the iipid mixture was weighed/ and 5 ml of the solution of the internal aqueous phase was adjusted to pH 4 was added/ and the mixture was hydrated at 70°C ^for 10 minutes. Uniform dispersion of the lipid was realized by occasionally sonicating the mixture in a bath-type sonicator that had been heated to 55°C. Using an extruder (manufactured by Lipex Biomembranes) that has been maintained at a temperature of 73°C, the resulting lipid dispersion was passed 3 times through a filter having a pore diameter of 0.4 pm; 3 times through a filter having a pore diameter of 0.2 urn; and 10 times through a filter having a pore diameter of 0,1 um to obtain an LUV dispersion. The resulting iiposome had a size of 111-3 nm.<br>
The thus prepared liposome dispersion was subjected to gel filtration by adding to a column (Sepharose 4 Fast Flow having a diameter of 1.5 cm and a length of 25 cm)/ and eluting with physiological saline, and the exterior aqueous phase was substituted with physiological saline.<br>
PEGsooo-DSPE was dissolved in physiological saline to a concentration of 10 mg/mL, and this solution was added to the exterior aqueous phase so that the PEG5ooo~DSPE constitutes 0.75% by mole of the total lipid content of the liposome, and the mixture was incubated at 60°C for 30 minutes with stirring.<br>
Doxorubicin was dissolved in physiological saline to a concentration of 10 mg/mL, and this solution was added so that the doxorubicin constitutes 20% by mole of the total lipid content of the liposome, and adjusted to pH 7.4 using IN NaOH c'l: saturated sodium hydrogenccabonate. The solution was then incubated at 65°C for 30 minutes.<br>
In the procedure as described above/ the phospholipid of the liposome was quantitatively determined as in the case of Example 1.<br>
The liposome size was measured by diluting 100 uL of the liposome dispersion with physiological saline to 3 mL, and measuring average liposome diameter using Zetasizer S ZEM 5002 (Malvern Instruments). Amount o£ the doxorubicin encapsulated in the liposome<br>
-19-<br><br>
(the amount drug loaded = drug/lipid) was determined by measuring absorbance at 480 run with a spectrophotometer for a mixture of 0.1 mL of the doxorubicin liposome with 0.3 mL of IN HO and 3.6 mL of isopropanol. The amount of the doxorubicin was 0.12 mol/mol.<br>
[Test Example 1]<br>
PEG5ooo-ASPE (manufactured by NOF Corporation) was dissolved in each of the following 4 buffers to a concentration of 5 mg/mL, and the solution was heated at 65°C for 90 minutes. ?EG5ooc-DSPE was also dissolved in the same buffer to a concentration of 10 mg/mL, and the<br>
solution was stored at 40°C for 1 week.<br>
Buffer (I): ammonium sulfate (250mM)<br>
Buffer (2); L-Histidine (10mM)/ 10% sucrose, pH 6.5<br>
Buffer (3): citric acid (300mM), pH 4.0<br>
Buffer (4): citric acid (300mM), pH 7.5<br>
10 uL of the thus stored solution was spotted at a position 1 cm above the lower end of the<br>
silica gel thin layer of 20 cm x 20 cm. This silica gel thin layer was then placed in a glass<br>
container that had been preliminarily equilibrated with the developing solvent which was a<br>
mixed solution of chloroform/ methanol, and ammonia (28) (85:14:1) for development with<br>
the developing solvent for about 15 cm, and the degradation product was searched by<br>
iodine color development. The results of this thin layer chromatography (TLC) are shown in<br>
FIG. 1 to 2.<br>
FIG. 1 shows the results of the TLC for the PEGsooo-DSPE solution which had been heated<br>
to 65°C for 90 minutes, and<br>
FIG. 2 shows the results of the TLC for the PEG5ooo-DSPE solution which had been heated<br>
to 40°C for 1 week.<br>
Increase in the spot was not observed at the position of the degradation product (lyso-lipid)<br>
before and after the heating (see the spot of Lyso-PEG Std) for the PEG5ooo-DSPE that had<br>
been dissolved in the buffer at a pH of 5 or S ^ 06-09-22;05:37PM;ION higher whereas<br>
increase in the spot was evident in the case of the PEGsooo-DSPE that had been dissolved in<br>
the buffer st<br>
pH4.<br>
Test Example 1 shows the data of stability of the lipid derivative of a hydrophilic macromolecule (PEGsooo- DSFE) under ttuidic conditions. The data show that the PEG5ooo-DSPE is degraded when it is heated under acidic conditions (buffer (3)/ citric acid/ pH 4.0). This in turn means that, when the liposome is produced by a method in which the PEG5ooo-DSPE is kept under acidic buffer conditions as in the case of Comparative Example 1, the PEGsooo-DSPE is expected to degrade during the manufacture, or the storage* In the case of the liposome produced by the method of Comparative Example Ir the internal aqueous phase is acidic,, and the PEG5ooo-DSPE in the region in contact with the internal aqueous phase is also expected to lyze. The results are shown in Test Example 2.<br>
[Test Example 2] Comparison of degradation behavior between the liposomes of Example 1 and Comparative Example 1 The two types of liposomes produced in the Example 1 and the<br>
20<br><br>
Comparative Example 1 were stored at 40°C for 1 week or 2 weeks/ and the liposomes were then evaluated for their residual content of the PEGsooo-DSPE -by H?LC. The results are shown in FIG. 3 by the residual content of the PEGsooo-DSPE for the PEG iiposomes stored at4°C.<br>
The results of the Test Example 2 demonstrate that the residual content of the PEGsooo-DSPE decreased in the case of the liposome of the Comparative Example 1 indicating the degradation of the PEG&amp;OOO-DSPE whereas no significant change in the residual content was observed in the case of the liposome of the present invention produced in Example 1 in indicating the absence of the degradation of the PEGsooo-DSPE.<br>
When the degradation of the PEGsooo-DSPE is prevented, instabilization of the lipid bilayer, leakage of the drug introduced in the liposome, aggregation of the liposome/ decrease in the effect of preventing adsorption of the liposome to plasma protein or opsonin protein/ loss of liposome stability in blood, and the like associated with the degradation of the PEGsooo-DSPE are also prevented.<br>

Next/ amount of the doxorubicin hydrochloride was calculated based on the HSPC concentration that was calculated in the quantitative determination of the HSPC so that the ratio of the doxorubicin hydrochloride (Dox) to the total lipid (mole/mole) was 0.16 (Dox / total lipid (w/w) - O.IB). Based on the calculation, the required amount of the doxor'Jbicin hydrochloride was weighed. A doxorubicin hydrochloride solution at 10 mg/mL was prepared using 10% sucrose solution (pH 9*0). A predetermined amount of the doxorubicin hydrochloride solution (10 mg/mL) was added to the liposome dispersion/ and the mixture was stirred at 60°C for 60 minutes to thereby introduce the doxorubicin hydrochloride in the liposome* The sample after the doxorubicin hydrochloride introduction was cooled in an ice bath.

Zeta potential was measured as described below.<br>
About 2.5 mL of RO water was introduced in a 2.5 mL syringe. By pulling the plunger/ 20 y.L of the liposome dispersion and 20 ^li of Dulbecco's PBS were introduced from the tip of the syringe,, and air was removed by pushing the plunger.
