Protein Kinase Inhibitors<br>
Background of the invention<br>
This invention relates to compounds that inhibit the activity of protein kinases.<br>
Protein kinases are enzymes that catalyze the transfer of a phosphate group from<br>
ATP to an amino acid residue, such as tyrosine, serine, threonine, or histidine on a<br>
protein. Regulation of these protein kinases is essential for the control of a wide<br>
variety of cellular events including proliferation and migration. Specific protein<br>
kinases have been implicated in diverse conditions including cancer [Blume-Jensen,<br>
P., Nature, 411, 355 (2001)) Traxler, P. M., Exp. Opin. Then Patents, 8, 1599 (1998);<br>
Bridges, A. J., Emerging Drugs, 3, 279 (1998)]; restenosis [Mattsson, E., Trends<br>
Cardiovascular Medicine 5, 200 (1995)]; atherosclerosis [Raines, E. W., Bioessays,<br>
18, 271 (1996)]; angiogenesis [Shawver, L K., Drug Discovery Today, 2, 50 (1997);<br>
Folkman, J., Nature Medicine, 1, 27 (1995)] stroke [Paul, R., Nature Medicine 7, 222<br>
(2001)]; and osteoporosis [Boyce, J. Clin. Invest, 90,1622 (1992)].<br>
Tyrosine kinases (TK) are a class of protein kinases. The major family of<br>
cytoplasmic protein TKs is the Src family which consists of at least eight members<br>
(Src, Fyn, Lyn, Yes, Lck, Fgr, Hck and Blk) that participate in a variety of signaling<br>
pathways [Schwartzberg, P. L, Oncogene, 17, 1463 (1998)]. The prototypical<br>
member of this tyrosine kinase family is Src, which is involved in proliferation and<br>
migration responses in many cell types [Sawyer, T., Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs, 10,<br>
1327 (2001)]. Src activity has been shown to be elevated in breast, colon (-90%),<br>
pancreatic (&gt;90%) and liver (&gt;90%) tumors. Greatly increased Src activity is also<br>
associated with metastasis (&gt;90%) and poor prognosis. Antisense Src message<br>
impedes growth of colon tumor cells in nude mice [Staley, C. A., Cell Growth<br>
Differentiation, 8, 269 (1997)], suggesting that Src inhibitors could slow tumor growth.<br>
In addition to its role in cell proliferation, Src also acts in stress response pathways,<br>
including the hypoxia response. Nude mice studies with colon tumor cells expressing<br>
antisense Src message have reduced vascularization [Ellis, L. M., J. Biol. Chem.,<br>
273, 1052 (1998)], which suggests that Src inhibitors could be anti-angiogenic as well<br>
as anti-proliferative.<br>
Src disrupts E-cadherin associated cell-cell interactions [E. Avezienyte,<br>
Nature Cell Bio., 4, 632 (2002)]. A low molecular weight Src inhibitor prevents this<br>
disruption thereby reducing cancer cell metastasis [Nam, J.S.,. Clinical Cancer Res.,<br>
8,2340 (2002)].<br>
Src inhibitors may prevent the secondary injury that results from a VEGF-<br>
mediated increase in vascular permeability such as that seen following stroke<br>
[Eliceiri, B. P., Mol. Cell., 4, 915 (1999); Paul, R., Nat. Med. 7, 222 (2001)].<br>
Src also plays a role in osteoporosis. Mice genetically engineered to be<br>
deficient in Src production were found to exhibit osteopetrosis, the failure to resorb<br>
bone [Soriano, P., Cell, 64, 693 (1991); Boyce, B. F., J. Clin., Invest, 90, 1622<br>
(1992)]. This defect was characterized by a lack of osteoclast activity. Since<br>
osteoclasts normally express high levels of Src, inhibition of Src kinase activity may<br>
be useful in the treatment of osteoporosis [Missbach, M., Bone, 24,437 (1999)].<br>
Inhibitors of the NMDA (N-methyl-D-asparte) receptor could provide treatment<br>
of chronic neuropathic pain [Urban, L Drug Dev. Res., 54, 159 (2002)]. The activity<br>
of NMDA receptors is regulated by Src family kinases (SFKs) (Yu, X. M., Proc. Nat.<br>
Acad. Sci., U.S.A., 96, 7697 (1999) and a low molecular weight SFK inhibitor, PP2,<br>
decreases phosphorylation of the NMDA receptor NR2 subunit [Guo, W.J. Neuro.,<br>
22(14), 6208 (2002)]. SFK inhibitors therefore have potential in the treatment of<br>
neuropathic pain.<br>
Tyrosine kinases (TKs) are divided into two classes: the non-transmembrane<br>
TKs and transmembrane growth factor receptor TKs (RTKs) [Blume-Jensen, P.,<br>
Nature, 411, 355 (2001)]. Growth factors, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF),<br>
bind to the extracellular domain of their partner RTK on the cell surface which<br>
activates the RTK, initiating a signal transduction cascade that controls a wide variety<br>
of cellular responses including proliferation and migration. The overexpression of<br>
EGF and also of members of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFr) family,<br>
which includes EGF-r, erbB-2, erbB-3 and erbB-4, is implicated in the development<br>
and progression of cancer [Rusch, V., Cytokine Growth Factor Rev., 7,133 (1996),<br>
Davies, D. E., Biochem. Pharmacol., 51, 1101 (1996) and Modjtahedi, E., Int. J.<br>
Oncol., 4,277 (1994)]. Specifically, over expression of the receptor kinase product of<br>
the erbB-2 oncogene has been associated with human breast and ovarian cancers<br>
[Slamon, D. J., Science, 244, 707 (1989) and Slamon, D. J., Science, 235, 177<br>
(1987)]. Upregulation of EGFr kinase activity has been associated with epidermoid<br>
tumors [Reiss, M., Cancer Res., 51, 6254 (1991)]; breast tumors [Macias, A.,<br>
Anticancer Res., 7, 459 (1987)]; and tumors involving other major organs [Guliick,<br>
W.J., Brit. Med Bull., 47,87 (1991)].<br>
It is also known that deregulation of EGF receptors is a factor in the growth of<br>
epithelial cysts in the disease described as polycystic kidney disease [Du, J., Amer.<br>
J. Physiol., 269 (2 Pt 1), 487 (1995); Nauta, J., Pediatric Res., 37(6), 755 (1995);<br>
Gattone, V. H., Developmental Biology, 169(2), 504 (1995); Wilson, P. D., Eur. J.<br>
Cell Biol., 61(1), 131, (1993)]. The compounds of this invention, which inhibit the<br>
catalytic function of the EGF receptors, are consequently useful for the treatment of<br>
this disease.<br>
In addition to EGFr, there are several other RTKs including FGFr, the<br>
receptor for fibroblast growth factor (FGF); flk-1, also known as KDR, and flt-1, the<br>
receptors for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF); and PDGFr, the receptor for<br>
platelet derived growth factor (PDGF). The formation of new blood vessels, a<br>
process known as angiogenesis, is essential for tumor growth. Two natural<br>
angiogenesis inhibitors, angiostatin and endostatin, dramatically inhibited the growth<br>
of a variety of solid tumors. [O'Reilly, M. S., Cell, 79, 315 (1994); O'Reilly, M. S.,<br>
Nature Medicine, 2, 689 (1996); O'Reilly, M. S., Cell, 88, 277 (1997)]. Since FGF<br>
and VEGF are known to stimulate angiogenesis, inhibition of the kinase activity of<br>
their receptors should block the angiogenic effects of these growth factors. In<br>
addition, the receptor tyrosine kinases tie-1 and tie-2 also play a key role in<br>
angiogenesis [Sato, T. N., Nature, 376, 70 (1995)]. Compounds of the invention that<br>
inhibit the kinase activity of FGFr, flk-1, flt-1, tie-1 or tie-2 may inhibit tumor growth by<br>
their effect on angiogenesis.<br>
PDGF is a potent growth factor and chemoattractant for smooth muscle cells<br>
(SMCs). The renarrowing of coronary arteries following angioplasty is due in part to<br>
the enhanced proliferation of SMCs in response to increased levels of PDGF.<br>
Therefore, compounds that inhibit the kinase activity of PDGFr may be useful in the<br>
treatment of restenosis. In addition, since PDGF and PDGFr are overexpressed in<br>
several types of human gliomas, small molecules capable of suppressing PDGFr<br>
activity, have potential utility as anticancer therapeutics [Nister, M., J. Biol. Chem.<br>
266,16755 (1991); Strawn, L M., J. Biol. Chem. 269,21215 (1994)].<br>
Other RTKs that could potentially be inhibited by compounds of this invention<br>
include colony stimulating factor receptor, the nerve growth factor receptors (trka,<br>
trkB and trkC), the insulin receptor, the insulin-like growth factor receptor, the<br>
hepatocyte growth factor receptor and the erythropoietin-producing hepatic cell<br>
receptor (EPH).<br>
In addition to the RTKs there is another family of TKs termed the cytoplasmic<br>
protein or non-receptor TKs. The cytoplasmic protein TKs have intrinsic kinase<br>
activity, are present in the cytoplasm and nucleus, and participate in diverse<br>
signaling pathways. There are a large number of non-receptor TKs including Abl,<br>
Jak, Fak, Syk, Zap-70 and Csk. Inhibitors of Abl kinase are useful for the treatment<br>
of chronic myeloid leukemia as evidenced by STI-571, marketed as Gleevec<br>
[Kantarjian, H., N. Engl. J. Med., 346 (9), 645 (2110)].<br>
Two members of the cytoplasmic protein TKs, Ick and ZAP-70 are<br>
predominately expressed on T-cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Inhibitors of these<br>
kinases can suppress the immune system and therefore have possible therapeutic<br>
potential to treat autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, sepsis, and<br>
transplant rejection [Kamens, J. S., Current Opin. Investig. Drugs, 2, 1213 (2001);<br>
Myers, M., Current Pharm. Design, 3, 473 (1997)]. A low molecular weight Lck<br>
inhibitor is effective in preventing allograft rejection [Waegell, W. Transplant.<br>
Proceed. 34.1411 (2002).<br>
Besides TKs, there are additional kinases including those that phosphorylate<br>
serine and/or threonine residues on proteins. A major pathway in the cellular signal<br>
transduction cascade is the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway which<br>
consists of the MAP kinase kinases (MAPKK), including mek, and their substrates,<br>
the MAP kinases (MAPK), including erk [Seger, R., FASEB, 9, 726 (1995)]. When<br>
activated by phosphorylation on two serine residues by upstream kinases, such as<br>
members of the raf family, mek catalyzes the phosphorylation of threonine and<br>
tyrosine residues on erk. The activated erk then phosphorylates and activates both<br>
transcription factors in the nucleus and other cellular targets. Over-expression and/or<br>
over-activation of mek or erk is associated with various human cancers [Sivaraman,<br>
V. S., J. Clin. Invest, 99,1478 (1997)].<br>
As mentioned above, members of the raf family of kinases phosphorylate<br>
serine residues on mek. There are three serine/threonine kinase members of the raf<br>
family known as a-raf, b-raf and c-raf. While mutations in the raf genes are rare in<br>
human cancers, c-raf is activated by the ras oncogene which is mutated in a wide<br>
number of human tumors. Therefore inhibition of the kinase activity of c-raf may<br>
provide a way to prevent ras mediated tumor growth [Campbell, S. L, Oncogene, 17,<br>
1395(1998)].<br>
The cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks), including cdc2/cyclin B, cdk2/cyclin A,<br>
cdk2/cyclin E and cdk4/cyclin D, and others, are serine/threonine kinases that<br>
regulate mammalian cell division. Increased activity or activation of these kinases is<br>
associated with the development of human tumors [Garrett, M. D., Current Opin.<br>
Genetics Devel, 9, 104 (1999); Webster, K. R., Exp. Opin. Invest. Drugs, 7, 865<br>
(1998)]. Additional serine/threonine kinases include the protein kinases A, B, and C.<br>
These kinases are known as PKA or cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, PKB<br>
(Akt), and PKC, and all three play key roles in signal transduction pathways<br>
responsible for oncogenesis [Glazer, R. I., Current Pharm. Design, 4(3), 277 (1998)].<br>
Compounds capable of inhibiting the kinase activity of mek, erk, raf, cdc2/cyclin B,<br>
cdk2/cyclin A, cdk2/cyclin E, cdk4/cyclin D, PKA, PKB (Akt) or PKC may be useful in<br>
the treatment of diseases characterized by abnormal cellular proliferation, such as<br>
cancer.<br>
The serine/threonine kinase UL97 is a virion-associated protein kinase which<br>
is required for the replication of human cytomegalovirus [Wolf, D.G., Arch. Virology<br>
143(6), 1223 (1998) and He, Z., J. Virology, 71, 405(1997)]. Compounds capable of<br>
inhibiting the kinase activity of UL97 may be useful antiviral therapeutics. Since<br>
certain bacteria require the action of a histidine kinase for proliferation [Loomis, W.<br>
F., J. Cell Sci., 110, 1141 (1997)], compounds capable of inhibiting such histidine<br>
kinase activity may be useful antibacterial agents.<br>
Thieno[3,2-b]pyridines, thieno[2,3-b]pyridines and certain pyridine and<br>
pyrimidine derivatives have been noted as kinase inhibitors. These compounds differ<br>
both in nature and placement of substituents at various positions when compared to<br>
the compounds of this invention.<br>

In a preferred embodiment of this invention an inert solvent is a compound<br>
that does not react chemically with the compounds of this invention. A preferred inert<br>
solvent includes for example tetrahydro furan (THF).<br>
For purposes of this invention a reduced temperature is a temperature 
78°C. In a preferred embodiment this temperature is -78°C.<br>
For purposes of this invention an elevated temperature is a temperature of<br>
about 50° C to about 150° C.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention provides a method for the<br>
treatment or inhibition of a pathological condition or disorder in a mammal. The<br>
present invention accordingly provides to a mammal, a pharmaceutical composition<br>
that comprises a compound of this invention in combination or association with a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The compound of this invention may be<br>
provided alone or in combination with other therapeutically effective compounds or<br>
therapies for the treatment or prevention of a pathological condition or disorder in a<br>
mammal.<br>
The compounds are preferably provided orally or subcutaneously. The<br>
compounds may be provided by intralesional, intraperitoneal, intramuscular or<br>
intravenous injection; infusion; liposome-mediated delivery; topical; nasal; anal;<br>
vaginal; sublingual; uretheral; transdermal; intrathecal; ocular; or otic delivery. In<br>
order to obtain consistency in providing the compound of this invention it is preferred<br>
that a compound of the invention is in the form of a unit dose. Suitable unit dose<br>
forms include tablets, capsules and powders in sachets or vials. Such unit dose<br>
forms may contain from 0.1 to 100 mg of a compound of the invention and preferably<br>
from 2 to 50 mg. Still further preferred unit dosage forms contain 5 to 25 mg of a<br>
compound of the present invention. The compounds of the present invention can be<br>
administered orally at a dose range of about 0.01 to 100 mg/kg or preferably at a<br>
dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg. Such compounds may be administered from 1 to 6<br>
times a day, more usually from 1 to 4 times a day. The effective amount will be<br>
known to one of skill in the art; it will also be dependent upon the form of the<br>
compound. One of skill in the art could routinely perform empirical activity tests to<br>
determine the bioactivity of the compound in bioassays and thus determine what<br>
dosage is the effective amount to administer.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be formulated with conventional<br>
excipients, such as a filler, a disintegrating agent, a binder, a lubricant, a flavoring<br>
agent, a color additive, or a carrier. The carrier may be for example a diluent, an<br>
aerosol, a topical carrier, an aqueous solution, a nonaqueous solution or a solid<br>
carrier. The carrier may be a polymer or a toothpaste. A carrier in this invention<br>
encompasses any of the standard pharmaceutically accepted carriers, such as<br>
phosphate buffered saline solution, acetate buffered saline solution, water, emulsions<br>
such as an oil/water emulsion or a triglyceride emulsion, various types of wetting<br>
agents, tablets, coated tablets and capsules.<br>
When provided orally or topically, such compounds would be provided to a<br>
subject by delivery in different pharmaceutical carriers. Typically, such carriers<br>
contain excipients such as starch, milk, sugar, certain types of clay, gelatin, stearic<br>
acid, talc, vegetable fats or oils, gums, or glycols. The specific carrier would need to<br>
be selected based upon the desired method of delivery, for example, phosphate<br>
buffered saline (PBS) could be used for intravenous or systemic delivery and<br>
vegetable fats, creams, salves, ointments or gels may be used for topical delivery.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be delivered together with<br>
suitable diluents, preservatives, solubilizers, emulsifiers, adjuvants and/or carriers.<br>
Such compositions are liquids or lyophilized or otherwise dried formulations and<br>
include diluents of various buffer content (for example, Tris-HCI, acetate, phosphate),<br>
pH and ionic strength, additives such as albumins or gelatin to prevent absorption to<br>
surfaces, detergents (for example, TWEEN 20, TWEEN 80, PLURONIC F68, bile<br>
acid salts), solubilizing agents (for example, glycerol, polyethylene glycerol), anti-<br>
oxidants (for example ascorbic acid, sodium metabisutfate), preservatives (for<br>
example, thimerosal, benzyl alcohol, parabens), bulking substances or tonicity<br>
modifiers (for example, lactose, mannitol), covalent attachment of polymers such as<br>
polyethylene glycol, complexation with metal ions, or incorporation of the compound<br>
into or onto particulate preparations of hydrogels or liposomes, micro-emulsions,<br>
micelles, unilamellar or multilamellar vesicles, erythrocyte ghosts, or spheroplasts.<br>
Such compositions will influence the physical state, solubility, stability, rate of in vivo<br>
release, and rate of in vivo clearance of the compound or composition. The choice of<br>
compositions will depend on the physical and chemical properties of the compound<br>
capable of treating or inhibiting a pathological condition or disorder.<br>
The compound of the present invention may be delivered locally via a capsule<br>
that allows a sustained release of the compound over a period of time. Controlled or<br>
sustained release compositions include formulation in lipophilic depots (for example,<br>
fatty acids, waxes, oils).<br>
For purposes of this invention a pathological condition or disorder is linked to<br>
kinase molecules and inhibition of the signals generated by these molecules.<br>
Generated signals regulate a number of cellular functions such as cell growth,<br>
differentiation and cell death. The signals generated by these molecules have been<br>
implicated in initiation of tissue level responses, discussed in detail in the<br>
"Background of the Invention". The tissue level response triggers cellular damage or<br>
deregulated cellular growth. Deregulated cell growth occurs as a result of perturbed<br>
signals that moderate or alter cellular behaviour or function. One method of treating<br>
a pathological condition or disorder would be to intercept the generated signal before<br>
it reachs the tissue. As described in detail previously specific kinases are associated<br>
with cellular events that have been implicated in pathological conditions or disorders<br>
including, but not limited to, cancer, stroke, osteoporosis, polycystic kidney disease,<br>
autoimmune disease, rheumatoid arthritis, neuropathic pain, and transplant rejection.<br>
A pathological condition or disorder is mediated in a mammal when it is linked<br>
to kinase molecules as described above. For purpose of this invention a condition or<br>
disorder mediated in a mammal is one that effects or acts to alter the mammal's<br>
normal state.<br>
For purposes of this invention cancer is a cellular tumor. The natural course<br>
of the cancer is fatal. Metastasis develops as a result of adhesion of tumor cells to<br>
the vascular endothelium. As the tumor grows, cells are shed in the circulation and<br>
spawn an independent tumor nodule known as a metastasis.<br>
Throughout this application structures are presented with chemical names.<br>
Where any question arises as to nomenclature the structure prevails.<br>
The following experimental details are set forth to aid in an understanding of<br>
the invention, and are not intended, and should not be construed, to limit in any way<br>
the invention set forth in the claims that follow thereafter.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The compounds of this invention are conveniently prepared according to the<br>
following schemes: (1) from commercially available starting materials or: (2) from<br>
known starting materials which can be prepared as described in literature procedures<br>
or: (3) from new intermediates described in the schemes and experimental<br>
procedures. Optically active isomers may be prepared, for example, by resolving<br>
racemic derivatives or by asymmetric synthesis. The resolution can be carried out by<br>
methods known to those skilled in the art such as in the presence of a resolving<br>
agent, by chromatography, or combinations thereof.<br>
Reactions are performed in a solvent appropriate to the reagents and<br>
materials employed and suitable for the transformation being effected. It is<br>
understood by those skilled in the art of organic synthesis that the various<br>
functionalities present on the molecule must be consistent with the chemical<br>
transformations proposed. This may necessitate judgement as to the order of<br>
synthetic steps, protecting groups, if required, and deprotection conditions.<br>
Substituents on the starting materials may be incompatible with some of the reaction<br>
conditions. Such restrictions to the substituents which are compatible with the<br>
reaction conditions will be apparent to one skilled in the art. Reactions are run under<br>
inert atmospheres where appropriate.<br>
The preparation of the compounds and intermediates of this invention<br>
encompassed by formulas la and Ib is described as follows.<br>
As shown in Scheme 1, decarboxylation of a 3-amino-2-thiophenecarboxylate<br>

aminothiophenes of formula 2. This decarboxylation can also be performed in a base<br>
such as aqueous sodium hydroxide at elevated temperatures. Addition of ethyl<br>
(ethoxymethylene) cyanoacetate to compounds of formula 2, in a solvent such as<br>
toluene, provides the intermediate propenoate. Thermal cyclization of these<br>
intermediate propionates in a solvent system such as biphenyl and diphenyl ether<br>

these amidines to the anion of acetonitrile, generated at low temperature, preferably<br>
-78°C by the action of n-butyl lithium on acetonitrile, in a solvent such as<br>
tetrahydrofuran, provides 7-oxo-4,7-dihydrothieno[3,2-b]pyridine-6-carbonitriles of<br>

Cell Based Screen for Inhibitors of Raf and/or Mek Kinase.<br>
Materials<br>
Cell Lines: Human tumor cell lines LoVo which are known to be growth inhibited<br>
by low nM concentrations of a reference standard inhibitor of Ras and human<br>
adenocarcinoma cell line CaCo-2, which is known to be growth resistant to the<br>
same reference compound.<br>
Cell Media : RPMI 1640 with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum supplemented with L-<br>
glutamine and Pennicilin/Streptomycin.<br>
Compounds: Supplied usually as a 10 mM stock in 100% DMSO.<br>
Normal Saline: 150 mM NaCI+V<br>
Trichloroacetic Acid (TCA): 50% (w/v) in water<br>
Sulforhodamine B (SRB): 0.4% (w/v) in 1% Acetic Acid<br>
Tris Base: 10 mM in water<br>
Methods<br>
Cells are plated at 2000 cells per well for cell line LoVo, 1,750 cells for cell line<br>
BXPC3, 1,000 cells for cell line WM266-4 and 1500 cells for cell line CaCo-2 in<br>
96 well plates. Cells are plated in media (200 µl) and allowed to adhere<br>
overnight at 37°C. At 24 hours post plating, compounds are added directly at a<br>
volume of 0.5 µl. For the qualitative screen (compounds screened at 25 µM)<br>
compound is added directly to cells. For the quantitative screen, compound is<br>
first diluted in DMSO to generate concentrations of compound or reference<br>
standard of: 1, 5, 10 and 25 µM. It is advisable to make the dilutions in an<br>
identical 96 well plate so that compounds can be added using a multichannel<br>
micropipettor set at 0.5 µI. The cells are then incubated for four days after<br>
which the media is removed using a 12 well manifold by first tipping the plate<br>
forward at a 45 degree angle and then inserting the manifold in an upright<br>
orientation to prevent the tips of the manifold from disturbing cells at the bottom<br>
of the plate. 200 µl of normal saline is then added to each well using an 8 well<br>
multichannel pipettor, followed by the careful addition of 50µI of 50% TCA. The<br>
plates are then incubated for 2 hours at 4°C, after which the supernatant is<br>
removed using the same technique as above and the plated washed twice with<br>
200 µl water. The plates are then air dried and 50 µl of SRB stock solution is<br>
carefully added so that the entire bottom of each well is covered. This again<br>
can be used using an 8 well multichannel pipettor. The SRB is incubated with<br>
fixed cells for 15 minutes at room temperature after which the SRB is removed<br>
with the manifold as described above and the plates washed twice with 350 µl<br>
of 1% acetic acid per well each time. The plates are then air dried after which<br>
the bound SRB is released from protein by the addition of 200 µl of Tris base.<br>
Resolubilizing the SRB is aided by placing the plates on a rotator for 15-30<br>
minutes. The absorbance of each well is determined at 550 or 562 nm using a<br>
microtiter plate reader.<br>
Each compound or dilution thereof is performed in triplicate. Outliers are<br>
identified by visual inspection of the data. Each plate should have a "0" control<br>
(vehicle only).<br>
Qualitative screen: To calculate % inhibition of a compound at 25 µM, the<br>
following formula is used: 1- (experimental absorbance @ 25 µM compound/<br>
"0" control absorbance) x 100= % inhibition at 25 µM. Compounds having &gt;50%<br>
inhibition at 25µM are placed in the quantitative assay.<br>
Quantitative Assay: A standard curve is constructed by plotting the concentration of<br>
compound against the average absorbance calculated at that concentration. A curve<br>
is plotted and the concentration at which the curve passes through the 50% the<br>
absorbance mark seen in the "0" control well is the IC20 calculated for that compound.<br>
Multiple entries for a given compound indicate that it was tested multiple times. The<br>
results obtained for representative compounds of this invention are listed in Table 4.<br>
