				<td>MICRO COOLING DEVICE BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present: invention relates to a micro cooling device for discharging out unnecessary heat, and more particularly to a micro cooling device for an electronic product that generates unnecessary heat in spite of a small size of product, such as an integrated circuit device.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
Due to a large quantity of heat generated by an integrated circuit device like a recently developed central processing unit (CPU), the device itself and a system containing it tend to be degenerated in product reliability. Especially, in a semiconductor device, a variety of parameters are affected by the operation temperature so that their values are changed, thereby causing a problem in the device to deteriorate performances of the integrated circuit.<br>
One representative conventional method to solve the aforementioned problem is using' a fan to forcibly cool down the device. However, the aforementioned method has its own problems like a low cooling efficiency, introduction of additional heat generating source, such as a power source for the fan, and additional heat generated by the fan itself.<br>
Another method having a higher cooling efficiency is discharging heat by changing phases of a liquid material("coolant"). In other words, a liquid material used as a coolant is passing over a heat generating source and turning into gas to discharge heat with its vaporizing energy, which has been widely used in refrigerators and air conditioners. There is also a problem in the aforementioned method in that a variety of equipment should be additionally installed for<br>
condensing the vaporized(or gaseous) coolant, so that the bulkiness of the total system and power consumption are increased.<br>
Recently, a very small-sized cooling device, so called a heat pipe, has been developed by applying phase changes of a liquid material and natural convection phenomenon. Even if there are a various types of heat pipes, a double-pipe type of heat pipe having internal and external pipes is introduced as an efficient cooling device. In the double-pipe type, the coolant is filled in the external pipe, and the wall of the internal pipe has a plurality of fine holes to form a passage to the external pipe from the inside; of the internal pipe. When heat from a heat source is transferred to the external pipe, the coolant in the external pipe turns into gas by absorbing the heat, and the vaporized coolant is infused into the inside of internal pipe through the holes on the internal pipe. The gas in the internal pipe further moves to the opposite end of the internal pipe through differences in buoyancy and air pressure. At the opposite end of the internal pipe, the coolant is condensed into liquid. The liquid moves through the holes of the internal pipes to the external pipe and finally returns to the original place of the coolant.<br>
The heat pipe made in the aforementioned principle is small and has a favorable cooling efficiency. However, as the movement of the gas coolant inside the pipe is dependent on differences in buoyancy and air pressure and the movement of the liquid coolant is dependent on gravity, there is a limitation on the installation position or place of the heat pipe. Furthermore, since the heat pipe should be constructed in a structure in which the coolant is condensed at the opposite end of the heat generating source, as the size of the heat pipe gets smaller, its cooling efficiency gets lower and its performance gets poorer.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The aforementioned problems of the conventional cooling devices and to provide a micro cooling device which can be made very small, but with high cooling performances.<br>
In addition, it is another object of the present invention to provide a cooling device of high efficiency that has no restriction in installation position or place which is not influenced by gravity.<br>
In order to accomplish the aforementioned objects of the present invention, there is provided a cooling device which discharges out heat generated by a heat generating source, said device comprising: a coolant storing part for storing liquid coolant; a heat absorbing part comprising at least one micro channel and being positioned to be close to said heat generating source and connected to said coolant storing part, said liquid coolant being partly filled in said micro channel by surface tension and vaporized to be gaseous coolant in said micro channel when heat is absorbed from said heat generating source; a heat insulating part being adjacent to said heat absorbing part for preventing said heat absorbed by said heat absorbing part from transferring to other zones; a condensing part for condensing said gaseous coolant and being positioned apart from said heat absorbing part; a gas moving part being close to said heat absorbing part and said condensing part and being a passage through which said gaseous coolant moves from said heat absorbing part to said condensing part; and a housing in which at least said heat absorbing part is comprised.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Now, an embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic cross-sectional view for illustrating a cross-section of an XZ plane of a cooling device in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The cooling device 100 of the present invention includes a coolant storing part 102 to store liquid coolant (indicated by wave patterns in the drawing) and a heat absorbing part 106 which is positioned close to the coolant storing part 102 and neighboring the heat generating source(not shown). The heat absorbing part 106 includes a plurality of micro channels 114 (indicated by slant lines in the drawing). The coolant stored in the coolant storing part 102 is partly filled in the micro channels 114 by surface tension of each of the micro channels according to the capillary phenomenon.<br>
The cooling device 100 of the present invention further includes a gas<br>
moving part 104 positioned across from the coolant storing part 102 and separated<br>
I by the heat absorbing part 106. The cooling device  100 also includes a heat<br>
insulating part 108 placed adjacent to the heat absorbing part 106 for preventing heat from transferring to the other parts. The cooling device also includes a condensing part 110 positioned across from the heat absorbing part 106 and<br>
separated in Z-axis by the heat insulating part 108.<br>
Preferably, the coolant storing part. 102, the heat absorbing part 106, the gas moving part 104, the heat insulating part 108 and the condensing part 110 is formed in a housing 112, which forms an embodiment of the cooling device 100 of the present invention.<br>
In order to more clearly describe the geometrical structure of an embodiment of the present invention, Fig. 2 is shown for a cross-sectional view of the cooling device 100 in Fig. 1 seen from line a-a'. The cooling device 100 includes a coolant storing part 102 formed apart in the X-axis from the gas moving part 104 with the heat absorbing part 106 being inserted therebetween. As mentioned, a plurality of micro channels 114 are formed in the heat absorbing part 106.<br>
Next, operational processes of the cooling device 100 will be described with reference to Figs. 1 through 3. As shown in Fig. 1, a heat transferring direction is illustrated in block arrows 120 and 122. Heat generated by the external heat generating source (not shown) is conveyed to the heat absorbing part 106 of the cooling device 100. It is preferred that a thermal contact is kept between the external heat generating source and the external wall of the housing 112 of the cooling device 100 where the heat absorbing part 106 is neighbored.<br>
The housing 112 can be made of a variety of materials including semiconductor materials like silicon Si or Gallium Ga, layering materials like self-assembled mono-layer, metals like copper Cu or aluminum Al or either alloy, ceramics or crystalline materials like diamond. Especially, if the external heat generating source is a semiconductor device, the cooling device 100 of the present invention can be made of the same semiconductor material used for the semiconductor device. The cooling device 100 of the present invention, as will be described below, can be integrally manufactured as one of the following fabrication<br>
processes. Therefore, the cooling device 100 can be made in the same size (for instance, several or tens of square centimeters of area in XY plane) as the external heat generating source, so that the thermal resistance in the cooling device 100 of the present invention can be minimized.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, the heat transferred from the external heat generating source is absorbed at the heat absorbing part 106. As shown in Fig. 2, the heat absorbing part 106 has a plurality of micro channels 114, and the coolant stored in the coolant storing part 102 is filled up to a predetermined portion of the channels 114 according to the capillary phenomenon. This is illustrated in detail in Fig. 3. As shown in Fig. 3, which is an enlarged view for schematically illustrating one of the micro channels 114 of the heat absorbing part 106, the coolant fills from the coolant storing part 102 up to a position designated as "A" of the micro channel.<br>
The position "A" in which the coolant is filled depends on type of the coolant and dimension of the micro channels 114. Particularly, the type of coolant may be different according to the material of the housing 112 because the coolant may go through a chemical reaction with the surface of micro channels 114 or housing 112. In consideration of environment pollution, a non-CFC type of new coolant may be preferred. As a coolant compatible with the material of the housing 112, for instance, in the electronic products like integrated circuit, water H2O, or alcohol like methanol or ethanol may be preferably selected. The large thermal capacity of the aforementioned coolant and its small surface tension angle with a semiconductor device result in a great flow rate of the coolant to transfer great quantity of heat. Furthermore, there is no problems related to environment pollution. Even when there is a defect in the housing 112 (for instance, a fine crack on the surface of the housing), it is less probable that the coolant will be discharged out of the housing 112.<br>
In general, though there is surface tension in macroscopic system, an influence of the gravity force is superior. Therefore, it is difficult to efficiently take<br>
an advantage of the surface tension in macroscopic system. In order to make the influence of the gravity force negligible, the size of the system gets smaller. Thus, preferably, the width of each micro channels 114 suitable to the cooling device 100 of the present invention is approximately within a range of 1 nm to 1000 um, and the length of the channels 114 is approximately within a range of 0.5 to 5 cm. In addition, the cross-sectional surface of the each micro channel 114 may be formed in circle, oval, rectangle, square, multi-angular shape, etc. As described below, the cross-sectional area may get larger or smaller in a predetermined direction to control the magnitude of the surface tension between the internal wall of the channels 114 and coolant.<br>
As described above, if heat is applied from the external heat generating source to the micro channels 114 of the heat absorbing part 106 filled with coolant, fine bubbles are generated by evaporation of some coolant filled in the micro channels 114, so that there forms turbulence in the coolant. Such fine bubbles and turbulence in the coolant generate more fine bubbles (not shown) in the micro channels 114. These fine bubbles move to gas moving part 104 where no coolant is stored. Since the bubbles move only in a distance of only several millimeters, the influence of the gravity can be negligible. Therefore, even if the coolant storing part 102 and gas moving part 104 are respectively positioned at high and low places, the bubbles can move to the gas moving part 104 from the coolant storing part 102 due to the difference in pressure in the heat absorbing part 106. The movement of the bubbles is described in detail hereinafter.<br>
The aforementioned movement of the bubbles having a predetermined direction can be established by the nodes 116 formed on the internal surface of the micro channels 114 in the heat absorbing part 106. In other words, as! shown in Fig. 3, a plurality of nodes 116 are protruded on the internal surface of the micro channels 114 in a zone close to the coolant storing part 102. As the cross-sectional area of the micro channel 114 gets smaller to the direction toward the<br>
gas moving part 104 (that is, in the increasing direction of the X axis) in which the surface tension gets larger in such a direction. The aforementioned increase in the surface tension enables the coolant to have potential energy which causes coolant to move in the direction from the coolant storing part 102 to the gas moving part 104. In summary, according to the directional potential energy of the coolant, most of the bubbles generated in the coolant tend to move in an increasing direction of the X axis.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, the gas moving part 104 is formed as an empty space at first. The bubbles moved from the heat absorbing part 102 to the gas moving part 104 break into gases(gaseous coolant). As the gaseous coolant erupts out of the heat absorbing part 106, the gaseous coolant moves to the condensing part 110 due to the difference in pressure at the zone adjacent to the heat absorbing part 106 and the condensing part 106.<br>
As the number of the bubbles in a unit volume is increased, the cooling efficiency of the cooling device of the present invention is increased. Therefore, it is preferable to increase the possibility of generation of such bubbles. For example, a plurality of micro grooves (not shown) may be formed on the internal surface of the channels 114 in the heat absorbing part 106. Alternatively, a microwave generator (not shown) may be used to provide microwave energy to the cooling device 100 for finely vibrating the cooling device thereby increasing the possibility of bubble generation.<br>
Then, the gas coolant loses its vaporization energy in the condensing part 110 to change into liquid state coolant. In order to more efficiently carry out condensation of the coolant, a plurality of fins (not shown) may be mounted on the external surface of the housing 112 close to the condensing part 110. The aforementioned fins may be made in microscopic size. Further, for instance, if micro actuators are made together with the micro fins, the heat discharged out of the condensing part 110 can be recycled to circulate surrounding air. Or, if the fin<br>
is made of a thermoelectric device, the heat discharged out of the condensing part 110 can be transformed into electrical energy which can be used for other electronic devices. Furthermore, in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, the condensing part 110 may be formed bigger than that of the heat absorbing part 106 (for instance, about 10 times), so that convection of surrounding atmosphere can also be helpful for condensation of the gaseous coolant. Further, micro fins may be formed on the inside surface of the condensing part 110, thereby increasing the condensing efficiency of the coolant.<br>
In the condensing part 110, the gaseous coolant is condensed and collected into liquid coolant. When enough liquid coolant is collected, the liquid coolant moves to the coolant storing part 102 through the micro channels formed in the condensing part 110. The condensed coolant moves to the coolant storing part 102 under the same principle as described above. Similar to the structure of the heat absorbing part 106, the channels in the condensing part 110 may include a plurality of nodes 118 on the inside surface in a zone adjacent to the gas moving part 104. At this time, the nodes 118 are formed in an opposite direction to those 116 formed in the heat absorbing part 106. The coolant condensed into liquid returns to the coolant storing part 102, thereby completing the circulation of the coolant in the cooling device 100.<br>
As described above, the circulation of the coolant in the cooling device 100 of the present invention is carried out in itsei^ without external driving force, especially through the capillary phenomenon by surface tension of the liquid coolant, without any influence of gravity. As a plurality of micro channels 114 are included in the heat absorbing part 106, the surface tension is greater than gravity in such cases.<br>
As micro dynamics are applied in the present invention, there are a variety of methods to make the cooling device 100 of the present invention. For instance, there may be used MEMS(micro electro mechanical system) or SAM(self<br>
assembled mono-layer) method,  or a super-precision  structure manufacturing method using laser or plasma.<br>
Now, another embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to Fig. 4, which is a cross-sectional view for illustrating the XZ plane of the cooling device 100' in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. As shown in the drawing, the cooling device 100' can be formed in a multi-layered structure with expansion of the mono-layered structure of the cooling device 100.<br>
The coolant circulation of the cooling device 100' is described as below. The coolant turns into gas by the heat absorbed in the heat absorbing part 100' and the gaseous coolant begins to move by the same mechanism as described in the mono-layered structure of the cooling device 100. Then, the coolant, as much as what has flowed out of the coolant storing part 102,' re-fills from the condensing part 110' to the coolant storing part 102' according to the principle of continuity. The gaseous coolant turns into liquid coolant again at the condensing part 110' through the gas moving part 104', so that the amount of the coolant, which flowed into the coolant storing part 102' from the condensing part 110', is compensated. Thereby, the circulation of the coolant in the cooling device 100' is completed.<br>
As shown in the drawing, the cooling device 100' is different from the cooling device 100 in the multi-layered structure of the condensing part 110', but all the essential principles, such as circulation of the coolant, phase changes or heat generation, are the same in both cooling devices 100 and 100'. The multi-layered structure of the condensing part 110' includes a plurality of micro channels (slant zones) and is divided by the insulating part 108'. A plurality of nodes 118' are formed for inducing the directional characteristics of the coolant in the micro channels. Of course, such nodes may be formed in the internal surface of all the micro channels of the condensing part 110' to strongly keep a<br>
predetermined directional characteristics. Similarly in the mono-layered structure of the cooling device 100, nodes 116' may also be formed in the heat absorbing part 106' to induce the directional characteristics of the coolant.<br>
As described above, a plurality of layers of the condensing parts 110' are formed to improve the condensation efficiency of coolant, thereby improve cooling efficiency of the cooling device 100'.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a microscopic cooling device having a characteristic of a high efficient heat cooling, which also improves performances and reliability of products with the cooling device of the present invention.<br>
Having described specific preferred embodiments of the invention, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to those disclosed embodiments, and that various changes and modifications may be effected therein by one skilled in the art without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention as defined in the appended claims.<br>
For example, the subject matter of the present invention may be embodied in a cooling device which includes a separate housing for the coolant storing part or the condensing part interconnected with the heat absorbing part through tubes as the gas moving part. In this particular embodiment, the size of the separate housing can be larger than the heat absorbing part, so that the condensing efficiency can be increased.<br>
Alternatively, the above described parts of the cooling device of the present invention may be formed on a plane, so that the thickness of the cooling device can be reduced. In this particular embodiment, the heat absorbing part and the condensing part are formed on, for example, the XY plane, thermally insulated from each other by the insulation part which is also formed on the same XY plane,<br>
and connected with each other through coolant storing part and the gas moving part also formed on the same XY plane.<br>
