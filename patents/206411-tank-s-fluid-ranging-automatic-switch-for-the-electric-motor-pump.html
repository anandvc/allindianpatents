Field of Invention<br>
The invention relates to a self-activated switching device for automatic filling of a fluid tank. The invention more particularly pertains to a self-activated switching device which activates and de-activates a motor of a pumping set based on availability or otherwise of a fluid according to a pre-determined quantity of fluid in the fluid tank.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The switching systems typically used in operating the pump set filling fluid in fluid tanks generally comprise relay-type switches which are manually operated depending on fluid-availability in the tank. Monitoring the level of fluid in the tank is done by periodical manual inspection and accordingly the pump-set is activated or de-activated. Such a system generally lead to human failures and result in either overflowing of the fluid or shortage of fluid inside the tank. Further, the systems of the prior art having over-dependence on the operators activity, the fluid-filling normally commences only when the fluid-level in the tank reaches the lowest level. Again, the pumping set is put on "off' mode only when the fluid level reaches either the highest level of the tank or overflows. Thus, the pumping set is caused to operate continuously for longer period without intermittent rest pause, which reduces the operating life of the pump set.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to propose a self-activated switching device which eliminates use of any kind of human monitoring and also prevents wastage of fluid through overflow.<br>
Another object of the invention is to propose a self-activated switching device which totally eliminates requirement of a pump-operator.<br>
-3-<br>
A still further object of the invention is to propose a self-activated switching device which allows a periodic rest to the pump-set while maintaining always a required level of fluid in the tank, thereby increasing the working life of the pump-set and eliminating any possibility of sudden shortage of fluid in the tank.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to propose a self-activated switching device which is of simple mechanical construction without use of any electronic appliances and / or any. biasing member such that the device can be operated for a longer period without any regular maintenance.<br>
A further object of the invention is to propose a self-activated switching device which is easy to manufacture, cheap and can be used for all kinds of fluid-tanks including volatile inflammable fluid.<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a self-activating switching device for automatic activation and de-activation of an electric motor-pump set assigned to a fluid tank thereby filling the fluid-tank according to predetermined levels, the device comprising a magnetic shuttle member encapsuled in a Conductor connector; a fluid-ranging rod member rigidly connected at the centre of said magnetic shuttle member, the fluid-ranging rod member having a plurality of holes to match with several fluid levels designed at an interior of the fluid tank; two displaceable stoppers provided respectively at the selected highest and lowest levels in the fluid tank; a floating body member disposed on said rod member being capable of freely moving upwardly and downwardly between said stoppers; an iron piece rigidly connected to a cap portion for fixing the switching device under the ceiling of the fluid tank; a plurality of electric poles connected in series by means of electric wires to the motor of said electric motor-pump set; a magnetic attraction force (Fm) between the magnetic shuttle member and the iron piece being greater than a total weight (W) calculated considering weight (w) of the floating body and weight (M) of the rod<br>
-4-<br>
member with shuttle member; a rod-shaped member disposed between said electric poles; the force of buoyancy of the floating body being greater than that of the force of magnetic attraction between the shuttle member and the rod-shaped member, said device is automatically self-activated to place said electric motor to 'on' mode and / or 'off mode according to attaining the following relationships respectively.<br>
(a)  W + M &gt; Fm, and<br>
(b)  Fb &gt; Fm + M<br>
The self-activating switching device, which maintains the fluid level range in a fluid tank is fitted on the roof or under the ceiling of a fluid Tank, where fluid is filled by an electric motor pump. From the fluid tank, the switch device is connected by an electric circuit to the electric motor of a pumping set. In the tank, when the maximum height or over flow level of the fluid is achieved, this switch automatically breaks the electric supply circuit and stops the motor. Thus the pumping set stops further filling of the fluid into the tank. Again after discharge of the fluid, when the fluid reaches a fixed lowest level of the tank, the switch automatically connects the electric supply circuit and starts the motor which operate the pumping means for filling the fluid into the tank. Thus, a selected range of fluid levels can be automatically maintained in the tank. Simultaneously, the problems of over flow or sudden emptiness of the tank are over-come. During the receding level due to discharging of the fluid, the motor pump caused to remain stoppped or at rest, until the lowest fixed level reaches. So the motor pump gets time-gap to cool-down itself. There is no need of any operator to off or to on the switching device on a regular basis.<br>
The switching device does not have any biasing means or any separate electronic control means so its life and workability is very long lasting. This switch device comprises only two functioning constituents altogether. The inner constituent consists of a magnetic member acting as a shuttle between two iron stations whose basic function is to connect or disconnect the electric poles of the electric motor of the pumping set. The outer constituent consists of a rod-shaped member having a floating body, the floating body<br>
-5-<br>
being freely slidable over the rod.  The length of the rod is designed as per the desired range of the fluid levels at the tank.<br>
There are three functioning forces on this switch device.<br>
(i). The magnetic force of attraction (Fm), (ii) the force of buoyancy (Fb), and (iii) the<br>
weight (W) of the floating body and the weight (M) of the rod with magnetic shuttle<br>
member.<br>
The Switch functions automatically when:-<br>
(a)  W + M &gt; Fm; it makes the electric motor on for filling the fluid when the level is lowest.<br>
(b)  Fb &gt;Fm + M; it makes the electric motor off to stop filling the fluid when the level is highest.<br>
i.         This switch relieves the house holders as well as the industrial units from the<br>
problem of the over-flow or sudden emptiness of water or fluid in their tank. It is<br>
useful for both of them. ii.        As the filling of water or fluid in the tank is automatically controlled, so this<br>
switch saves the wastage of electric power as well as the wastage of fluid due to<br>
the over flow. iii.       In absence or presence of the owner, this switch keeps his tank full of water or<br>
fluid without his care so it saves his time and anxiety. iv.       There is no need of any operator to operate it, so it saves the wage or money of its<br>
owner. v.        It can be fitted either inside or outside of the tank and also to the adjacent of the<br>
tank, in case of the fluid being inflammable. vi.       Its construction is free from any electronic appliances, spring, lever etc.<br>

Detailed Description of the preferred embodiment of the invention<br>
The details of the switch device (20) including the construction and functioning will now be described with the reference to the accompanying drawings and figures; which are only illustrative, but are not in dimension and limitation. The principles, method, and features may be employed in various and numerous formations.<br>
A cap portion (1) with two nuts (2) and bolts (3) is provided to facilitate releasably fixing the switch device (20) under the ceiling of the fluid tank (21). An iron piece (4), coated thinly with water proof compound is rigidly fixed at the center of the cap portion (1). The inside vertical wall of the cap (1) is screw threaded so that it may be easily fitted or detached from the switch device (20).<br>
An outer body (5) of the switch device (20) having at the center of its bottom, a tube nozzle (6), whose outer wall is screw-threaded so that the switch device (20) may be fitted, if required, on the roof of the tank (21). A partition base plate (7) having a central hole diametered to match that of the nozzle (6) interposed into said outer body (5). A rod-shaped member (8) coated with thin water proof compound having a central hole is in registration with that of said tube nozzle (6) and partition base plate (7) is rigidly<br>
-7-<br>
connected at the center of the partition base plate (7). Two thick brass plates (9,10) oppositely spaced apart at an equidistant gap from a rod-shaped member (8) are rigidly fixed at the partition base plate (7). Two screws (11,12) are provided to connect electric wires with said conductors (10,9) respectively.<br>
A magnetic flat piece (13) coated with thin water proof compound are provided respectively with a hard non-conductor or insulator material ring (14) and a good conductor brass ring (15).<br>
At the center of the flat magnetic piece (13), a long straight and light non conductor rod (16) is firmly fixed. The straight rod (16) passes freely through the central holes of said nozzle (6), partition base plate (7) and said rod-shaped member (6,7,8). The rod (16) is the fluid ranging rod member, whose lower end goes up to the desired lowest fluid level in the tank (21). This fluid ranging rod (16) has plurality of holes for adjustment of different required heights of the fluid levels. Two displaceable stoppers (17,18) are inserted at the selected highest and the lowest fluid levels respectively.<br>
A floating body member (19) is provided such that the member (19) moves freely up and down over the ranging rod (16) in between the two stoppers (17,18). The floating body member (19) provides the main working forces to off and to on the switch device (20). When the fluid level is highest or at the over flow level, the force of buoyancy of the floating body at the stopper (17) makes the switch device (20) to stop the motor pump. When the fluid level is lowest or at the reserve level, the weight of the floating body (19) makes the switch device to start the operation of the motor pump.<br>
The total weight of the shuttle member (13) and the rod (16) with stopper (17,18) only, is lesser than that of the force of magnetic attraction between magnetic piece (13) and iron piece (4). While the total weight of the shuttle rod (16), the stoppers (17,18) along with the floating body (19) is greater than that of the magnetic force of attraction between the<br>
-8-<br>
magnetic piece (13) and the iron piece (4). The force of buoyancy of the floating body (19) is greater than that of the force of magnetic attraction between the iron piece (8) and the magnetic piece (13) and the weight of rod and disk with stoppers. The thickness of the brass pieces (9,10) are similar and are slightly greater than that of iron piece (8), so that they may hold the brass ring (15) well in contact under magnetic pressure of the iron piece (8) and the magnetic piece (13). The iron pieces (4,8) and the magnetic piece (13) are coated with thin layer of corrosion free insulated material. The space between the nozzle (6) and the partition base plate (7) and the length of nozzle (6) is such that it keeps the rod (16) erect. The space between the iron pieces (8,4) is such that the shuttle disc (13-16) after gaining a motion due to the magnetic break of the magnetic piece (13) and the iron piece (4) under the force of buoyancy of the floating body (19) reach to iron piece (4) easily.<br>
Working of the preferred embodiment.<br>
In side a fluid tank (21) the switch device (20) is fitted under the ceiling of the fluid tank (21) by means of nuts and bolts (2-3). Alternatively, the switch device can be fitted on the roof of the tank (21) by means of the nozzle (6). The length of the ranging rod (16) configured to extend up to the selected lowest reserve fluid level in side the tank. A floating body (19) is put on the rod (16). The stopper (18) is inserted tightly in to the rod's (16) hole at lowest level. Below the over flow level, the stopper (17) is inserted tightly in to the rod's (16) hole to cater for the highest selected level. The electric motor of the pumping set is connected in series, by electric wires with the electric poles (9,10) of the switch device respectively by means of screws (12,11). Now the switch device is ready for work.<br>
When the tank is empty, the switch remains in 'on' position because the metalic connector (15) connects electric poles (9,10) so that the electric motor starts and the pumping set begins to fill the fluid in to the tank. With the rise in the level of the fluid inside the tank, the floating body (19) begins to move up feely on the rod (16) without exerting any force on the rod (16). The rod with disk shuttle (13-16) remains stable due<br>
-9-<br>
to its weight and due to the magnetic attraction between the magnetic piece and the iron piece (13,8).<br>
As soon as the floating body (19) reaches the stopper (17),, the force of buoyancy begins to act on the stopper (17). When the force of buoyancy becomes greater than that of the weight of the rod-shuttle (13-6) and the force of magnetic attraction between the magnetic piece (13) and the iron piece (8), the body (19) shoots up the rod-shuttle (13-16) with a sudden jerk and the rod-shuttle (13-16) goes up to the iron piece (4). The force of magnetic attraction holds on the rod-shuttle (13-16). Thus the electric circuit breaks and the switch device goes to "off" position to stop the motor of the pumping set. At this stage of highest fluid level, further filing of the fluid stops.<br>
When due to discharge of the fluid, the level begins to receed, the floating body (19) also correspondingly goes downwards inside the tank. As soon as the lowest reserve level reaches, the weight of the body (19) acts on the stopper (18) and pulls down the rod-shuttle (13-16) from the magnetically-held position with the iron piece (40). The rod-shuttle (13-16) falls down with a sudden jerk under the gravitational force. Such a phenomenon gets the electric circuit connected to the electric poles (9,10) and the metallic connector (15) without any prolonged sparking and flikering. The motor starts and again the filling of the fluid begins. In this way the switch device automatically maintains the fluid level range inside the tank. It is to be understood that the present invention is by no means limited to the particular construction herein disclosed and / or shown in the drawings but also comprises any modification or equivalents within the scope of the disclosures.<br>
This Fluid Ranging Switch is totally automatic at every stage and there is no need of any manual operation at all at any stage. It keeps the motor pump off when the tank is full of fluid and also during discharge of the fluid too, until lowest level is arrived. So, provides<br>
-10-<br>
a complete rest to the motor during these periods. But as soon as the lowest fluid level comes, it starts the motor pump and keeps that working until over flow level is arrived. It automatically maintains the required quantity of the fluid inside the tank. There is no spring and lever systems, so the workability and durability of this switch is very long without any maintenance or overhauling etc. There is no prolonged momentary electric sparkings or flikerings between the contacting surfaces of the electric circuit poles. The magnetic force keep the contact firm and intact, so the motor remains safe from the danger of burning or shortage. The Force of Buoyancy, the force of attraction of the magnet and the weight of the floating mass are the three forces, which automatically operate this switch. The system of this switch is simple mechanical and it does not contain any electronic elements or appliances, such as resistor, capacitors, diode, transistor, relay, transformer etc, so it is not a complicated one. This switch can be fitted inside or outside of the tank or with some adjacent of the tank; particularly in the case of a volatile inflammable fluid.<br>
